Stanford grew up in [[Mexia, Texas]]. His father, James Stanford, is former mayor of Mexia and a member of the Board of Directors of [[Stanford Financial Group]]. His mother, Sammie (née Conn), is a nurse.  After his parents divorced in 1959, Stanford and his brother went to live with their mother.

==Career==
Stanford started in business in [[Waco, Texas]], opening a bodybuilding gym that failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/investing/wall_street_news_blog/archives/2009/02/stanfords_faile.html |title=Stanford's Failed Health Club |author=Matthew Goldstein |date=February 13, 2009 |work=BusinessWeek |quote=In 1983, a judgment debt of $31,800 was awarded against Stanford for back rent on a failed health club in Waco. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217190251/http://www.businessweek.com/investing/wall_street_news_blog/archives/2009/02/stanfords_faile.html |archivedate=February 17, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His first success in business came from speculating in real estate in Houston after the Texas oil bubble burst in the early 1980s;&lt;ref name="guardian20"/&gt; his father was his partner in this venture. The men made a fortune in the 1980s, buying up depressed real estate and selling it years later as the market recovered. After his father retired in 1993, Stanford took control of the company, which by then had 500 employees.&lt;ref name="TST-2Nov08"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Sunday Times |location=London |date=November 2, 2008|title=Profile: Allen Stanford; The Texan tycoon is throwing millions at the game from his West Indian base, but he is starting to irk the Establishment|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/cricket/article5062851.ece|first=Deirdre|last=Hipwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanford moved to the [[Caribbean Islands|Caribbean]] in the 1980s, first to [[Montserrat]], then to [[Antigua]].&lt;ref name="TST-2Nov08" /&gt;  With Stanford Finance, he started Guardian International Bank on the island of [[Montserrat]] in 1985; he moved it to [[Antigua]] during a British crackdown on Montserrat's [[Offshore bank|offshore-banking]] industry in the 1980s, renaming it [[Stanford International Bank]], an affiliate of Stanford Financial.&lt;ref name="Searcey 2009"/&gt;

Early in 2007, Stanford and [[Baldwin Spencer]], prime minister of [[Antigua and Barbuda]] and formerly an ally, began verbally feuding in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spencer, Stanford in war of words |date=February 27, 2007 |author=Rickey Singh |work=[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)|Barbados Daily Nation (newspaper)]] |url=http://www.nationnews.com/309840900756772.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226024122/http://www.nationnews.com/309840900756772.php |archivedate=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Antigua's Financial Services Regulatory Commission named a British firm, [[Vantis]] Business Recovery Services, the receiver for Stanford International Bank and Stanford Trust Company, the [[Associated Press]] reported.

Reports surfaced in early February 2009 that the SEC, the FBI, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, and the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]], a major U.S. private-sector oversight body, were investigating [[Stanford Financial Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/business/13stanford.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business|work=The New York Times|title=U.S. Agents Scrutinize Texas Firm|author=Julie Cresswell|date=February 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; questioning the consistently higher-than-market returns which Stanford International Bank claimed to make for its depositors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=aUtjE4_bm4oM&amp;refer=news|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|title=Billionaire Stanford's Firm Said to Face U.S. Probe|date=February 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former executive told SEC officials that Stanford presented hypothetical investment results as actual historical data in sales pitches to clients.&lt;ref name="bb0218"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aSz93D0yAbEE&amp;refer=home "Stanford Presented Hypothetical Data as Actual, Executive Says"], [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], February 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford claimed his certificates of deposit were as safe as, or safer than, U.S. government-insured accounts.&lt;ref name="cdclaim"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=a0XVjooQdppA&amp;refer=us Stanford Lured Clients With "No Worry" Promise, Rates], [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], February 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A leaked cable message from the U.S. Embassy in the [[Bahamas]] reported as early as 2006 that companies under Stanford's control were "rumored to engage in [[bribery]], [[money laundering]], and political manipulation".

On February 27, 2009, the SEC said that Stanford and his accomplices operated a "massive [[Ponzi scheme]]", misappropriating billions of dollars of investors' money and falsifying the Stanford International Bank's records to hide their fraud.

In June 2008, Stanford and the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] (ECB) signed a deal for five [[Twenty20]] internationals between England and a West Indies all-star XI, with a total prize fund of £12.27&amp;nbsp;million (US$20&amp;nbsp;million) to be awarded to the team that won the Championship.

'''Ambivalent sexism''' is a theoretical framework which posits that [[sexism]] has two sub-components: "hostile sexism" and "benevolent sexism". Hostile sexism reflects overtly negative evaluations and [[stereotype]]s about a [[gender]] (e.g., the ideas that women are incompetent and inferior to men). Benevolent sexism represents evaluations of gender that may appear subjectively positive (subjective to the person who is evaluating), but are actually damaging to people and [[gender equality]] more broadly (e.g., the ideas that women need to be protected by men). For the most part, [[Psychology|psychologists]] have studied hostile forms of sexism. However, theorists using the theoretical framework of ambivalent sexism have found extensive [[empirical evidence]] for both varieties. The theory has largely been developed by [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] Peter Glick and [[Susan Fiske]].

==General overview==
Sexism, like other forms of [[prejudice]], is a type of [[bias]] about a group of people. Sexism is founded in conceptualizations of one gender as being superior or having higher status than another gender in a particular domain, which can lead to [[discrimination]]. Research has indicated that stereotypes about socially appropriate [[gender role]]s for women and men are a driving factor in the endorsement of sexism.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00104.x |title=Hostile and Benevolent Sexism |year=1997 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=21 |pages=119–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patriarchy]], defined as men's power and "structural control over political, legal, economic, and religious institutions",&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"/&gt; is a feature of sexism and is related to hostile attitudes toward women. [[Anthropology|Anthropological]] research suggests that patriarchy is pervasive among the majority of human societies, such that women have been systematically discriminated against, [[Oppression|oppressed]], and [[Marginalization|marginalized]] by men throughout history.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"/&gt; Sexism maintains patriarchal [[social structure]]s and reinforces prescribed gender roles.

Typically, sexism is thought of as hostility toward women, perpetrated by men. However, both women and men can (and often do) endorse sexist beliefs about each other and themselves. In other words, men can express sexist attitudes about women or men, and women can express sexist attitudes about men or women. While sexism has historically disadvantaged women, there are negative consequences of sexism for both men and women.&lt;ref name="Roets, A. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/per.843 |title=Is Sexism a Gender Issue? A Motivated Social Cognition Perspective on Men's and Women's Sexist Attitudes Toward Own and Other Gender |year=2012 |last1=Roets |first1=Arne |last2=Van Hiel |first2=Alain |last3=Dhont |first3=Kristof |journal=European Journal of Personality |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=350–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rigid gender roles can be damaging to women and men alike, restricting opportunities and promoting gender-based prejudice. For the purposes of this article, sexism toward women will be the focus, as it is most relevant to the definition and study of ambivalent sexism.

Ambivalent sexism offers a multidimensional reconceptualization of the traditional view of sexism to include both subjectively benevolent and hostile attitudes toward women.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.491 |title=The Ambivalent Sexism Inventory: Differentiating hostile and benevolent sexism |year=1996 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=491–512}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "ambivalent" is used to describe the construal of sexism because this type of bias includes both negative and positive evaluations of women. The addition of a benevolent feature to definitions of gender-based prejudice was a major contribution to the study of sexism and field of psychology. Traditional conceptualizations of sexism focused almost entirely on overt hostility toward women. While historians, anthropologists, [[Feminist theory|feminist scholars]], and psychologists had previously suggested that sexism involves positive and negative evaluations of women, the majority of empirical research at the time evaluated only hostile expressions of sexism.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.56.2.109 |title=An ambivalent alliance: Hostile and benevolent sexism as complementary justifications for gender inequality |year=2001 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |journal=American Psychologist |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=109–18 |pmid=11279804}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI)—a scale which was developed by Glick and Fiske in 1996, and which assesses ambivalently sexist attitudes—marks a shift in how sexism is construed and scientifically measured. Glick and Fiske created the ASI to address a proposed deficiency in the measurement of sexism at the time.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"/&gt; They argue that previous scales assessing sexism do not adequately capture the ambivalent nature of gender-based prejudice toward women.

==Theoretical framework==

Glick and Fiske assert that hostile and benevolent sexism complement each other in reinforcing [[tradition]]al gender roles and preserving patriarchal social structures of women as subordinate to men. Both forms of sexism share the assumption that women are inferior and restrict women to a lower [[social status]]. Hostile sexism reflects [[misogyny]] (i.e., the hatred of women by men) and is expressed through blatant negative evaluations of women.&lt;ref name="Glick, P., Diebold, J., Bailey-Werner, B., &amp; Zhu, L., 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/01461672972312009 |title=The Two Faces of Adam: Ambivalent Sexism and Polarized Attitudes Toward Women |year=1997 |last1=Glick |first1=P. |last2=Diebold |first2=J. |last3=Bailey-Werner |first3=B. |last4=Zhu |first4=L. |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=1323–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of hostile sexism include beliefs about women as incompetent, unintelligent, overly emotional, and sexually manipulative. Benevolent sexism reflects evaluations of women that are seemingly positive. Examples of benevolently sexist attitudes include the reverence of women in wife, mother, and child caretaker roles, the romanticizing of women as objects of [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] affection, and the belief that men have a duty to protect women.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"/&gt; While benevolent sexism may not appear to be harmful to women on the surface, these beliefs are extremely caustic to gender equity and restrict women's personal, professional, political, and social opportunities. This is because these seemingly positive evaluations imply that (a) women are weak and need to be protected, (b) women should not deviate from traditional gender roles as mothers and caretakers, and (c) women should be idolized by men for their [[sexual purity]] and availability.

Because benevolently sexist attitudes appear positive, people often do not identify these beliefs as a form of gender-based prejudice. Furthermore, benevolent sexism may be seen by both men and women as reinforcing of the status quo, which some individuals may find comforting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312456369 |title=Why is Benevolent Sexism Appealing?: Associations with System Justification and Life Satisfaction |year=2012 |last1=Connelly |first1=K. |last2=Heesacker |first2=M. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=432–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social and cultural [[norm (social)|norm]]s may encourage benevolently sexist beliefs among women and men. A classic illustration of this is the endorsement of [[Chivalry#Modern manifestations and revivals|modern-day chivalry]] in interactions between women and men.&lt;ref name="Herzog, S. &amp; Oreg, S., 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5893.2008.00334.x |title=Chivalry and the Moderating Effect of Ambivalent Sexism: Individual Differences in Crime Seriousness Judgments |year=2008 |last1=Herzog |first1=Sergio |last2=Oreg |first2=Shaul |journal=Law &amp; Society Review |volume=42 |pages=45–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be considered traditional and polite for a man to insist that he holds a door open or carries a heavy object for a woman. However, this tradition is founded in historical representations of women as weaker than men. In these types of circumstances, people may find it difficult to distinguish between kindness, tradition, and benevolent sexism. Men and women often disagree on whether or not a specific incident should be considered sexist.&lt;ref name="Guteg, B. A., &amp; O'Conner, M., 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1995.tb01314.x |title=The Empirical Basis for the Reasonable Woman Standard |year=1995 |last1=Gutek |first1=Barbara A. |last2=O'Connor |first2=Maureen |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=51 |pages=151–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, women and men tend to show more agreement in classifying extreme and overt expressions of sexism.&lt;ref name="Guteg, B. A., &amp; O'Conner, M., 1995"/&gt; Hostile sexism is typically easier for people to identify as an expression of prejudice.&lt;ref name="Chisango, T. &amp; Javangwe, G., 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-012-0146-2 |title=Are People Better at Recognizing Ambivalent Sexism on the Basis of the Non-standard Profiles than the Standard ASI Ones? |year=2012 |last1=Chisango |first1=Tadios |last2=Javangwe |first2=Gwatirera |journal=Sex Roles |volume=67 |pages=69–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, women are rarely perceived by others in an entirely hostile or benevolent manner. In fact, people frequently report high levels of both benevolent and hostile sexism.&lt;ref name="Glick et al., 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.5.763 |title=Beyond prejudice as simple antipathy: Hostile and benevolent sexism across cultures |year=2000 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |last3=Mladinic |first3=Antonio |last4=Saiz |first4=José L. |last5=Abrams |first5=Dominic |last6=Masser |first6=Barbara |last7=Adetoun |first7=Bolanle |last8=Osagie |first8=Johnstone E. |last9=Akande |first9=Adebowale |last10=Alao |first10=Amos |last11=Brunner |first11=Barbara |last12=Willemsen |first12=Tineke M. |last13=Chipeta |first13=Kettie |last14=Dardenne |first14=Benoit |last15=Dijksterhuis |first15=Ap |last16=Wigboldus |first16=Daniel |last17=Eckes |first17=Thomas |last18=Six-Materna |first18=Iris |last19=Expósito |first19=Francisca |last20=Moya |first20=Miguel |last21=Foddy |first21=Margaret |last22=Kim |first22=Hyun-Jeong |last23=Lameiras |first23=Maria |last24=Sotelo |first24=Maria José |last25=Mucchi-Faina |first25=Angelica |last26=Romani |first26=Myrna |last27=Sakalli |first27=Nuray |last28=Udegbe |first28=Bola |last29=Yamamoto |first29=Mariko |last30=Ui |first30=Miyoko  |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=763–75 |pmid=11079240}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are individual differences in people's levels of benevolent and hostile sexism, such that a person can be rated highly on both, one, or neither dimension of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory. In addition, women are not immune from endorsing sexist beliefs about women. Extensive research supports the idea that it is common for women and men to support ambivalently sexist attitudes about women.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684311414832 |title=Ambivalent Sexism Revisited |year=2011 |last1=Glick |first1=P. |last2=Fiske |first2=S. T. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=530–5|pmc=3896071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, people find it difficult to believe that others can endorse both benevolent and hostile sexism.&lt;ref name="Chisango, T. &amp; Javangwe, G., 2012"/&gt; Research suggests that, when individuals are shown profiles of a benevolently sexist man and a man who endorses hostile sexism, they feel that it is very unlikely that one person can embody both forms of bias.&lt;ref name="Kilianski, S. E., &amp; Rudman, L. A., 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Wanting It Both Ways: Do Women Approve of Benevolent Sexism?|doi=10.1023/A:1018814924402 |year=1998 |last1=Kilianski |first1=Stephen E. |last2=Rudman |first2=Laurie A. |journal=Sex Roles |volume=39 |issue=5/6 |pages=333–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sub-components and dimensions==

Social psychologists have suggested that sexism may be inherently different from other forms of ambivalent prejudice, in that there is interdependency between women and men in social structures.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2011"/&gt; A central argument to the theory of ambivalent sexism is the idea that there is a complicated balance of power between men and women, such that men have structural power and women have dyadic power (stemming from dependence between two people). Dyadic power reflects the notion that men depend on women to fulfill certain goals, such as heterosexual [[intimacy]] and childbearing. Glick and Fiske assert that men's dependence on women is what fuels benevolently sexist attitudes, leading to idolization and the placing of women on a pedestal.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"/&gt; In other words, power relationships between men and women foster an ambivalent form of bias towards women.

Theoretically, each form of sexism is composed of three subcomponents: [[paternalism]], gender differentiation, and heterosexuality.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"/&gt; Paternalism reflects views of women as underdeveloped adults, providing justification for men to be authoritative and monitor, protect, and make decisions on women's behalf. Gender differentiation promotes the assumption that biological differences between males and females justify the strict adherence to socially prescribed gender roles. Heterosexuality—described as the most prominent cause of men's ambivalence toward women—reflects a tension between genuine desires for closeness and intimacy and a fear of women attaining power over men through sexual attraction.

Within hostile sexism (HS) and benevolent sexism (BS), the three subcomponents serve distinct functions. Dominative paternalism (HS) suggests that men should control women, while protective paternalism (BS) implies that men should protect and care for women. Competitive gender differentiation (HS) bolsters men's self-confidence (e.g., men are superior to women). Complementary gender differentiation (BS) places importance on traditional gender roles for women (e.g., mother &amp; wife) and assumes that men depend on women to fulfill these roles. Lastly, heterosexual hostility (HS) views women as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]] for men's pleasure and promotes the fear of women's capacity to manipulate men by engaging in or withholding sexual activity. Intimate heterosexuality (BS) romanticizes women as having sexual purity and views romantic intimacy as necessary to complete a man.

==Ambivalent Sexism Inventory==

Researchers typically measure ambivalent sexism at the individual level. The primary method used to measure an individual's endorsement of ambivalent sexism is the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), created by Glick and Fiske in 1996. The ASI is a 22-item [[Self-report inventory|self-report measure]] of sexism on which respondents indicate their level of agreement with various statements, which are placed on a 6-point [[Likert scale]].&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"/&gt; It is composed of two sub-scales that may be independently calculated for sub-scale scores or may be averaged for an overall composite sexism score. The first sub-scale is the hostile sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items designed to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of dominative paternalism, competitive gender differentiation, and heterosexual hostility, as previously defined. A sample item from the hostile sexism sub-scale is "Women are too easily offended." The second sub-scale is the benevolent sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items that aim to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy, as previously defined. A sample item from the benevolent sexism sub-scale is "Women should be cherished and protected by men."

Over fifteen years of additional research and replications support that this inventory possesses [[psychometric]] characteristics indicating that the measure is both empirically reliable and valid. Standard criteria in psychological research can be utilized to evaluate a scale.&lt;ref name="McHugh, M. C., &amp; Frieze, I. H., 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00097.x |title=The Measurement of Gender-Role Attitudes A Review and Commentary |year=1997 |last1=McHugh |first1=Maureen C. |last2=Frieze |first2=Irene Hanson |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=21 |pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using statistics, a [[Cronbach's alpha]] coefficient can be calculated to indicate whether items on a scale seem to be measuring the same psychological construct or dimension (demonstrating the retestability of a scale). Generally, researchers agree that a Cronbach's alpha coefficient above 0.80 suggests strong reliability in a scale. The ASI has consistently demonstrated this empirical reliability over time.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2011"/&gt; In addition, empirical evaluations of the ASI provide support for the validity of the scale, such that the inventory seems to effectively measure what it proposes to assess: a polarized attitude towards women, where both dimensions can be activated simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2011"/&gt;

The utility of the ASI is not limited to English speakers.&lt;ref name="Dardenne, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4074/S0003503306002041 |title=Structure latente et validation de la version française de l'Ambivalent Sexism Inventory : l'échelle de sexisme ambivalent |trans-title=Latent Structure of the French Validation of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory : Échelle de Sexisme Ambivalent |language=French |year=2009 |last1=Dardenne |first1=Benoit |last2=Delacollette |first2=Nathalie |last3=Grégoire |first3=Christine |last4=Lecocq |first4=Delphine |journal=L'Année psychologique |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=235–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is extensive support for the cross-cultural validity of the ASI. A cross-cultural study examining the theory of ambivalent sexism in 19 countries found that hostile and benevolent components of sexism are not culturally specific.&lt;ref name="Glick et al., 2000"/&gt; Furthermore, research suggests that ambivalently sexist attitudes towards men exist, such that hostile and benevolent attitudes toward men are found cross-culturally.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.5.713 |title=Bad but Bold: Ambivalent Attitudes Toward Men Predict Gender Inequality in 16 Nations |year=2004 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Lameiras |first2=Maria |last3=Fiske |first3=Susan T. |last4=Eckes |first4=Thomas |last5=Masser |first5=Barbara |last6=Volpato |first6=Chiara |last7=Manganelli |first7=Anna Maria |last8=Pek |first8=Jolynn C.

===Critiques===

While the ASI is widely used and accepted among researchers,&lt;ref name="Kilianski, S. E., &amp; Rudman, L. A., 1998"/&gt; one limitation of the ASI is that it is a self-reported measure.&lt;ref name="Sakalli-Ugurlu, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00223980209604825 |title=Turkish College Students' Attitudes Toward Women Managers: The Effects of Patriarchy, Sexism, and Gender Differences |year=2002 |last1=Sakalli-Ugurlu |first1=Nuray |last2=Beydogan |first2=Basak |journal=The Journal of Psychology |volume=136 |issue=6 |pages=647–56 |pmid=12523452}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social desirability]] is a common limitation of self-report measures in survey research; when participants in a research study complete a written self-report questionnaire, respondents are vulnerable to answering the items in a socially desirable manner. For this reason, some researchers employ variations of the ASI in their study designs that do not require self-reports. For example, Dardeene, Dumont, and Bollier (2007) transformed some items from the ASI into scenarios, presenting them to participants to induce conditions of both hostile and benevolent sexism.&lt;ref name="Dardenne, 2006"/&gt; Hebl, King, Glick, Singletary, and Kazama (2007) designed a field study in which they observed the sexist behaviors of others; they used the theory of ambivalent sexism and the ASI to generate items for their own measure to assess these observed behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.6.1499 |title=Hostile and benevolent reactions toward pregnant women: Complementary interpersonal punishments and rewards that maintain traditional roles |year=2007 |last1=Hebl |first1=Michelle R. |last2=King |first2=Eden B. |last3=Glick |first3=Peter |last4=Singletary |first4=Sarah L. |last5=Kazama |first5=Stephanie |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=1499–511 |pmid=18020792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of the ASI is that the labels of the two sub-constructs, "benevolent" and "hostile", are too abstract, do not generalize to certain languages, and may not be relevant to some cultures.&lt;ref name="Chisango, T. &amp; Javangwe, G., 2012"/&gt;

Lastly, findings from the Conn, Hanges, Sipe, and Salvaggio (1999) study suggest that other sexism scales may measure ambivalent attitudes towards women.&lt;ref name="Conn, A., Paul, H., Sipe, W., &amp; Salvaggio, A., 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/00131649921970242 |title=The Search for Ambivalent Sexism: A Comparison of Two Measures |year=1999 |last1=Conn |first1=A. B. |last2=Hanges |first2=P. J. |last3=Sipe |first3=W. P. |last4=Salvaggio |first4=A. N. |journal=Educational and Psychological Measurement |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=898–909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glick and Fiske originally proposed the theoretical framework of ambivalent sexism as filling a gap in the psychological literature and providing a novel tool for assessing a new dimension of sexism: benevolent sexism.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"/&gt; However, Conn and colleagues (1999), using [[confirmatory factor analysis]], showed that the Modern Sexism Scale (Swim, Aikin, Hall, and Hunter, 1995) captures ambivalent sentiments toward women, such that it identifies individuals that appear nonsexist but actually endorse sexist attitudes.&lt;ref name="Conn, A., Paul, H., Sipe, W., &amp; Salvaggio, A., 1999"/&gt; Results from this study suggest that, while both the Modern Sexism Scale and the ASI assess ambivalence toward women, the ASI is unique in its capabilities for separately measuring both hostile and benevolent attitudes. In addition, the ASI captures heterosexual intimacy and benevolent paternalism, whereas the Modern Sexism Scale does not.

==Empirical support==

While many individuals{{specify|date=July 2018}} endorse both benevolent and hostile sexism simultaneously, research{{by whom|date=July 2018}} suggests that people rated significantly higher in one of the two sub-components have distinct constellations of beliefs and patterns of behavior. In other words, someone who is high in benevolent sexism tends to show a different profile of attitudes than someone who is high in hostile sexism. The independence of these types of sexism in predicting human behavior indicates that the two are, in fact, discrete forms of bias on separate but related axes. Examples of research findings identifying disparate outcomes between benevolent sexism and hostile sexism are described below. In addition, the relationships between ambivalent sexism and a range of other related attitudes and behaviors are discussed.

===Attitudes toward sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, and rape===

Men who are ambivalently sexist (i.e., high in both benevolent and hostile sexism simultaneously) and men who are high in hostile sexism are more likely to tolerate the [[sexual harassment]] of women than men who are benevolently sexist.&lt;ref name="Russell, B. L., &amp; Trigg, K., 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/B:SERS.0000023075.32252.fd |title=Tolerance of Sexual Harassment: An Examination of Gender Differences, Ambivalent Sexism, Social Dominance, and Gender Roles |year=2004 |last1=Russell |first1=Brenda L. |last2=Trigg |first2=Kristin Y. |journal=Sex Roles |volume=50 |issue=7/8 |pages=565–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, hostile sexism is associated with acceptance of sexual harassment.&lt;ref name="Begany, J., &amp; Milburn, M., 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/1524-9220.3.2.119 |title=Psychological predictors of sexual harassment: Authoritarianism, hostile sexism, and rape myths |year=2002 |last1=Begany |first1=Joseph J. |last2=Milburn |first2=Michael A. |journal=Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=119–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the endorsement of hostile sexism is related to attitudes about [[intimate partner violence]] perpetrated by men towards women, such that people that are high in hostile sexism are more tolerant of intimate partner violence.&lt;ref name="Glick, P., Sakalli-Ugurlu, N., Ferreira, M., &amp; de Souza, M. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1471-6402.t01-1-00068 |title=Ambivalent Sexism and Attitudes Toward Wife Abuse in Turkey and Brazil |year=2002 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Sakalli-Ugurlu |first2=Nuray |last3=Ferreira |first3=Maria Cristina |last4=Aguiar De Souza |first4=Marcos |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=292–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benevolently sexist attitudes were not found to be a significant predictor of the tolerance of intimate partner violence. However, the endorsement of benevolent sexism was not a protective factor either. Lastly, men high in hostile sexism are more likely to rape women, whereas men that are high in benevolent sexism are more likely to [[Victim-blaming|blame a victim]] of rape for the attack.&lt;ref name="Viki &amp; Abrams, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |title=But She Was Unfaithful: Benevolent Sexism and Reactions to Rape Victims Who Violate Traditional Gender Role Expectations|doi=10.1023/A:1021342912248 |year=2002 |last1=Viki |first1=G. Tendayi |last2=Abrams |first2=Dominic |journal=Sex Roles |volume=47 |issue=5/6 |pages=289–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Close relationships and attraction===

Research has shown that sexist attitudes relate to preferences for certain characteristics in romantic partners.&lt;ref name="Sibley &amp; Overall, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684311401838 |title=A Dual Process Motivational Model of Ambivalent Sexism and Gender Differences in Romantic Partner Preferences |year=2011 |last1=Sibley |first1=C. G. |last2=Overall |first2=N. C. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=303–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that women with higher levels of benevolent sexism have more stereotypical preferences in men as romantic partners, such as financial security and resources. Men with higher levels of hostile sexism are more likely to value physical attractiveness in women as romantic partners. In addition, benevolent sexism tends to predict mate selection, whereas hostile sexism tend to predict subsequent marriage norms after pairing.&lt;ref name="Chen, Fiske, &amp; Lee, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9585-9 |title=Ambivalent Sexism and Power-Related Gender-role Ideology in Marriage |year=2009 |last1=Chen |first1=Zhixia |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |last3=Lee |first3=Tiane L. |journal=Sex Roles |volume=60 |issue=11–12 |pages=765–778 |pmid=24058258 |pmc=3777654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women find men high in benevolent sexism attractive, and rate men high in ambivalent sexism as less attractive.&lt;ref name="Bohner, Ahlborn, &amp; Steiner, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9665-x |title=How Sexy are Sexist Men? Women's Perception of Male Response Profiles in the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory |year=2009 |last1=Bohner |first1=Gerd |last2=Ahlborn |first2=Katrin |last3=Steiner |first3=Regine |journal=Sex Roles |volume=62 |issue=7–8 |pages=568–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in a recent research study on a particular aspect of benevolent sexism, protective paternalistic beliefs, women endorsed more protective paternalistic beliefs for men (toward women) in romantic versus work contexts. The endorsement of these beliefs in romantic contexts is thought to serve to reinforce and maintain such benevolent sexist behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312454842 |title=Prescription of Protective Paternalism for Men in Romantic and Work Contexts |year=2012 |last1=Sarlet |first1=M. |last2=Dumont |first2=M. |last3=Delacollette |first3=N. |last4=Dardenne |first4=B. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=444–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, benevolent sexism and hostile sexism are associated with beliefs that [[premarital sex]] is unacceptable for women.&lt;ref name="Sakalli-Ugurlu &amp; Glick, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00224490309552194 |title=Ambivalent sexism and attitudes toward women who engage in premarital sex in Turkey |year=2003 |last1=Sakalh‐Uğurlu |first1=Nuray |last2=Glick |first2=Peter |journal=Journal of Sex Research |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=296–302 |pmid=14533024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in the workplace===

While the consequences of hostile sexism in the workplace are more widely known and accepted, research has shown that benevolent sexism may have a more severe impact on a women's cognitive performance.&lt;ref name="Dardenne, 2006"/&gt; Dardenne, et al.(2006) suggested that hostile sexism can elicit anger or frustration in the target, which may increase her motivation to succeed or perform. Benevolent sexism, because of its seemingly positive evaluations and implicit attributions, is likely to hinder a woman's confidence and performance. The researchers showed that, in a typical team working environment, hostile sexism as well as benevolent sexism had consequences for the participant's performance. Masser and Abrams (2004) highlighted the fact that previous research has shown that benevolent sexism can have detrimental effects on a woman's performance evaluation if that woman violates social norms associated with certain sexist attitudes.&lt;ref name="Masser, B. M.&amp; Abrams, D., 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-004-5470-8 |title=Reinforcing the Glass Ceiling: The Consequences of Hostile Sexism for Female Managerial Candidates |year=2004 |last1=Masser |first1=Barbara M. |last2=Abrams |first2=Dominic |journal=Sex Roles |volume=51 |issue=9–10 |pages=609–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study showed that hostile sexism, but not benevolent sexism, hurt women's evaluations and recommendations for promotion.

Additionally, studies have shown that benevolent sexist attitudes lead to lower professional evaluations from men and women.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masser, B. M.&amp; Abrams, D., 2004"/&gt; Using an experimental design, Masser and Abrams (2004) found that individuals with hostile sexist attitudes rated women lower when applying for a male-dominant position. Additionally, high hostile sexist individuals recommend men to fill the available position more often than women. The authors argue that this is one of the main contributors to the [[glass ceiling]] effect.

===Help-seeking===

In a recent experimental study on the effects of benevolent sexism on [[help-seeking]] behaviors, researchers found that, when stereotypes of women as dependent were made salient, female college students were less willing to seek help. In addition, the more that help was sought, the worse women felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312457659 |title=Thanks, but No Thanks: Women's Avoidance of Help-Seeking in the Context of a Dependency-Related Stereotype |year=2012 |last1=Wakefield |first1=J. R. H. |last2=Hopkins |first2=N. |last3=Greenwood |first3=R. M. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=423–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, benevolent sexism appears to hold consequences towards women's help-seeking when certain benevolent sexist stereotypes are made salient.

=== Voting Behaviour ===
During the 2016 US Presidential Election, researchers connected ambivalent sexism to voting intentions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2016/10/10/a-basket-of-deplorables-a-new-study-finds-that-trump-supporters-are-more-likely-to-be-islamophobic-racist-transphobic-and-homophobic/|title=A ‘basket of deplorables’? A new study finds that Trump supporters are more likely to be Islamophobic, racist, transphobic and homophobic.|date=2016-10-10|newspaper=USAPP|last1=Blair |first1= Karen L. |language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a non-representative sample of US voters, predominantly male, ambivalent sexism was found to be the sole predictor of intending to vote for someone other than Hillary Clinton in the election. For every step up on the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, participants were 3.3 times more likely to be voting for someone other than Hillary Clinton. Of those not voting for Clinton, they were not necessarily being pulled over to the Trump campaign, but rather, many were intending to vote Third Party or were still undecided. While higher Islamophobia predicted a vote for Trump, lower Islamophobia and ''higher'' ambivalent sexism predicted being undecided or voting for a Third Party.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Women's endorsement of ambivalent sexism==

Both benevolent and hostile sexism are considered legitimizing ideologies, in that these attitudes provide the justification for social inequalities between men and women.&lt;ref name="Sidanius, Pratto, &amp; Bobo, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.998 |title=Social dominance orientation and the political psychology of gender: A case of invariance? |year=1994 |last1=Sidanius |first1=Jim |last2=Pratto |first2=Felicia |last3=Bobo |first3=Lawrence |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=998–1011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social dominance orientation]] (SDO; Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999) asserts that group-based inequalities are systematically reinforced by the disadvantaged group's adoption of the dominant group's ideology and social stratification.&lt;ref name="Sidanius &amp; Pratto 1999"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sidanius |first1=Jim |last2=Pratto |first2=Felicia |year=1999 |title=Social Dominance: An Intergroup Theory of Social Hierarchy and Oppression |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-62290-5}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research has consistently supported the validity of Social Dominance Theory,&lt;ref name="Gaucher, Frieser, &amp; Kay, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0022530 |title=Evidence that gendered wording in job advertisements exists and sustains gender inequality |year=2011 |last1=Gaucher |first1=Danielle |last2=Friesen |first2=Justin |last3=Kay |first3=Aaron C. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=101 |pages=109–28 |pmid=21381851 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the SDO model of structural oppression may be particularly apt to describe how patriarchy is perpetuated.&lt;ref name="Sibley et al, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9554-8 |title=Your Sexism Predicts My Sexism: Perceptions of Men's (but not Women's) Sexism Affects One's Own Sexism over Time |year=2008 |last1=Sibley |first1=Chris G. |last2=Overall |first2=Nickola C. |last3=Duckitt |first3=John |last4=Perry |first4=Ryan |last5=Milfont |first5=Taciano L. |last6=Khan |first6=Sammyh S. |last7=Fischer |first7=Ronald |last8=Robertson |first8=Andrew |journal=Sex Roles |volume=60 |issue=9–10 |pages=682–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have explored reasons for why women might [[Internalisation (sociology)|internalize]] ambivalently sexist attitudes towards women. Fischer (2006) found that women may develop benevolently sexist attitudes as a response to experiencing sexism themselves.&lt;ref name="Fischer, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2006.00316.x |title=Women's Benevolent Sexism As Reaction to Hostility |year=2006 |last1=Fischer |first1=Ann R. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=410–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-cultural research suggests that women's endorsement of benevolent sexism often reflects a culture of extreme hostile sexism among men in a given community.&lt;ref name="Glick et al., 2000"/&gt; Some researchers argue that, in cultures that are particularly hostile, women may internalize benevolent sexism as a protective mechanism.

'''Annigeri''' is a taluk of [[Dharwad district]] in the state of [[Karnataka]], [[India]], located 20&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Gadag]] en route to [[Hubli]] and 35&amp;nbsp;km from [[Hubli]].

==Introduction==
Annigeri ({{Lang-kn| ಅಣ್ಣಿಗೇರಿ}})is the [[place of birth]] of the famous [[Kannada]] poet [[Adikavi Pampa]] ({{Lang-kn| ಆದಿಕವಿ ಪಂಪ }}). It is well known for the black stone temple built by the [[Western Chalukya Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2201/stories/20050114000106500.htm |title=The Chalukyan magnificence |publisher= |accessdate=2008-08-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080717210433/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2201/stories/20050114000106500.htm |archivedate=17 July 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; known as Amruteshwara Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A temple of mythological figures supported by 76 columns, located in the [[Dharwad district]], and has a [[derasar]] dedicated to [[Parshva]], the 23rd [[Tirthankara]] in [[Jainism]].
Annigeri also has temples dedicated to '''Banashankari, Basappa, Gajina Basappa and Hanuman'''.
There is an ancient Lingayati temple near the railway station.

Annigeri has seven [[mosque]]s and two [[Lingayatism|Lingayati]] [[Matha]]s.

Annigeri was the last capital of the Chalukyas, Someshwara 4 (during 1184-89)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Annigeri comes under the core area of Western Chalukya architectural activity in the modern Karnataka state. The Amrtesvara Temple is the finest examples produced by the Kalyani Chalukyas ([[Western Chalukya architecture]]).

In 1157 the Kalachuris under [[Bijjala II]] captured [[Basavakalyan]] and occupied it for the next twenty years, forcing the Chalukyas to move their [[capital city]] to Annigeri in the present-day Dharwad district.

To Provide education at the primary and Vedic levels, Annigeri had five Brahmapuris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built in the [[Dharwad District]] in 1050 [[common era|CE]] with [[dravidian architecture|dravida]] articulation, and was the first temple made of [[soapstone]].

The large and black stone  Amruteshwar Temple is in the [[Kalyani Chalukyas]] style. The temple has a roof supported by 76 pillars and carvings of
mythological figures on its walls.

The Amruteshwara Temple was to be the prototype for later, more articulated structures such as the [[Mahadeva Temple (Itagi)]] at [[Itagi]]. Based on the general plan of the Amrtesvara Temple, the Mahadeva Temple was built in 1112 CE and has the same architectural components as its predecessor. There are, however, differences in their articulation.

During December and January, Amruteshwara temple is the venue of a festival.

'''Brian Ó Cuív''' (1916 – 14 November 1999) was a Celtic scholar who specialised in Irish history and [[philology]].

==Life==
Ó Cuív was professor of Celtic Studies at [[University College Dublin]] and later at the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]].&lt;ref name="http1999"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/1999/1114/9news.html |title=Nine News |publisher=RTÉ |date=14 November 1999 |accessdate=5 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040827060936/http://www.rte.ie/news/1999/1114/9news.html |archivedate=27 August 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His later years were devoted to the compilation of a catalogue of the Irish manuscripts in the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celt.dias.ie/publications/cat/b/b2-10-2.html |title=School of Celtic Studies – Catalogue of Irish manuscripts in the Bodleian Library at Oxford and Oxford College Libraries: Plates and Indexes |publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies: School of Celtic Studies |accessdate=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The completed catalogue was published after his death.

He married Emer de Valera, who would become the last surviving daughter of [[Éamon de Valera]], with whom he had nine children. She died in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0209/ichuive.html|title=Emer Í Chuív passes away aged 93|date=9 February 2012|accessdate=9 February 2012|work=RTÉ News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A son, [[Éamon Ó Cuív]], is a prominent Irish politician.&lt;ref name="http1999"/&gt;

==Surname==
Ó Cuív's surname was changed from ''Ó Caoimh'' ([[O'Keeffe]]) by his father, Shán Ó Cuív, a Cork journalist, who in the early 20th century, changed the spelling of his surname to conform with a simplified spelling system of his own invention which he called ''An Leitriú Shimplí''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O Cuiv – the spelling of my name. |url=http://www.dinglename.com/articles/article.asp?a=56|accessdate =19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter '[[v]]' is extremely rare in [[Irish language|Irish]] outside modern loanwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dáil Éireann – Volume 602 – 19 May 2005 – Priority Questions – Irish Language |url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0602/D.0602.200505190015.html |accessdate=19 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607095630/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0602/D.0602.200505190015.html |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The spelling of Irish|url=http://www.uni-due.de/DI/Spelling.htm|accessdate=19 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127151730/http://www.uni-due.de/DI/Spelling.htm|archivedate=27 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''capital call''' (also known as a draw down or a capital commitment) is a legal right of an [[investment firm]] or an [[insurance firm]] to demand a portion of the money promised to it by an investor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vcexperts.com/vce/library/encyclopedia/glossary_view.asp?glossary_id=225 Capital Call - Glossary - Encyclopedia - Library - VC Experts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524022133/http://vcexperts.com/vce/library/encyclopedia/glossary_view.asp?glossary_id=225 |date=May 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://companycrafters.onlinetech.net/Entry.aspx?Id=1292 capital call - Entrepreneurs Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526002111/http://companycrafters.onlinetech.net/Entry.aspx?Id=1292 |date=May 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A capital call fund would be the money that had been committed to the fund. The capital call is the act of actually transferring the promised funds to the investment target. A capital call agreement defines capital call terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://definitions.uslegal.com/c/capital-call/&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, when an investor buys into a [[real estate]] fund, that fund's managers may wait some time before using the investor's money to buy real estate, either because they are waiting for real estate prices to be favorable, or because they are researching new deals. When they are ready to  buy real estate, the fund managers issue a capital call, requiring investors who have [[Capital commitment|committed]] money to the fund to  transfer that money over.

The fund might also borrow funds instead of using the investor's money. This allows the fund to benefit from [[leverage (finance)|leverage]]. The financing of the real estate purchase is realized through borrowing from banks. When the fund has reached a certain level of [[rate of return|return]], capital calls are issued and the borrowing is paid off.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8348">The '''Center for Media and Public Affairs''' ('''CMPA''') is a self-described  [[nonpartisan]] and [[nonprofit]] [[research]] and educational organization that is affiliated with [[George Mason University]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]].  It was founded in 1985 by political scientists [[S. Robert Lichter]] and his ex-wife Linda Lichter. It published a newsletter called ''Media Monitor'' from 1987 to 2010.

==Research==
The CMPA conducts studies of the [[news]] and entertainment [[Mass media|media]]. Among its activities are a continuing [[analysis]] and [[tabulation]] of late night [[political jokes]],&lt;ref&gt;Political Humor in TV Talk Shows. In Schaefer, Todd and Thomas Birkland, eds. ''The Encyclopedia of Media and Politics in America'' Washington DC: CQ Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niven, D., Lichter, S.R., and Amundson, D: The Political Content of Late Night Comedy. ''Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics'', Vol. 8, No. 3 (Summer 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; an annual report on diversity among network news journalists,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Johnson, “Rising News Diversity Makes News,” USA Today, Feb. 29, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[content analysis]] of the nightly news on the major broadcast and cable news networks.

The results of the latter are compiled in the CMPA newsletter.  CMPA engages in [[health communication]] research, investigating the way in which [[science|scientific issues]] are conveyed in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Assessing Local Television News Coverage of Health Issues. Menlo Park, CA: Kaiser Family Foundation, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  CMPA also engages in [[survey research]] to determine the accuracy of media's reports of scientific opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Food for Thought: Reporting of Diet, Nutrition and Food Safety.  Washington, DC: International Food Information Council, December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

CMPA conducts [[social science|social scientific]] research on [[mass media|media coverage]] with the use of such techniques as [[content analysis]] and [[survey research]]. Its studies appear in [[academic journals]] and reference works as well as in popular media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;The Center for Media and Public Affairs. In Schaefer, Todd and Thomas Birkland, eds. ''The Encyclopedia of Media and Politics in America.'' Washington DC: CQ Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lichter, S.R: Ideological Bias. In Wolfgang Donsbach, ed., ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication.'' London: Blackwell/ICA, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lichter, S.R: "The Presidency and the Press -- Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush." In Stephen Vaughan, ed. ''The Encyclopedia of American Journalism''. New York: Routledge, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dye, T., Ziegler, H., and Lichter, S.R: American ''Politics in the Media Age''. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole, 1992. Fourth edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Stanley and Richard Niemi ''Vital Statistics on American Politics''. Washington D.C.: CQ Press, 2008, pp.183-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

CMPA's signature activity is its "rapid response" studies of media coverage of current issues, which appear quickly enough to influence ongoing [[debate|public debates]], such as [[election|presidential campaigns]], [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmation hearings, and major policy debates in [[United States Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Lichter, S.R: A Plague on Both Parties: Substance and Fairness in TV Election News. ''Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics''. Vol. 6, No. 3 (Summer 2001) 8-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farnsworth, S. and Lichter, S.R: The Mediated Congress. ''Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics'', Vol 10, no 2 (Spring 2005) 94-107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farnsworth, S. and Lichter, S.R: New Presidents and Network News. ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'', Vol 34, no 3 (September 2004) 674-690.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although CMPA avoids taking stands on political issues, its studies have sometimes become part of the public debate over the media's role in [[politics]] and [[society]]. For example, in 1992 a CMPA study found that the average length of a presidential candidate's [[soundbite]] on the evening news had dropped to less than ten seconds, down from 42 seconds in 1968. In response CBS adopted a policy requiring longer soundbites on the [[CBS Evening News]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard Kurtz, “Media Notes,” ''Washington Post'', July 7, 1992; Rick Schindler, “CBS Vows to Serve Up Chewier Sound Bites,” ''TV Guide'', July 18, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;[[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] note that the CMPA, along with several other nonpartisan non-profit organizations, help to police the media through the creation of  "flak," which they define as "negative responses to a media statement or program" and which they maintain is part of a project of "[[dominant ideology|disciplining]] the media." &lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky, ''Manufacturing Consent.'' New York: Pantheon, 2002, pp. 2, 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

CMPA studies of entertainment media have been used by members of the [[United States Congress]] such as Sen. [[Joe Lieberman]] (I-CT) in their efforts to reduce gratuitous violence and sex in television entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;David Hatch, “Every Four Minutes,” ''Electronic Media'', Sept. 27, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; CMPA's research on entertainment media has also included studies of how various groups have been portrayed on television, such as studies of Hispanic Americans' portrayals commissioned by the National Council of [[La Raza]] and the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;''Don't Blink: Hispanics in Television Entertainment.'' Washington, DC: National Council of La Raza, April 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media Monitor==
Media Monitor was the bi-monthly publication of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, which presented the central findings of one or more research studies on [[media monitoring]]. It was started in 1987 and last published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Monitor|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/media-monitor/oclc/556100519|work=WorldCat|accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a concise analysis of contemporary [[media coverage]] and the controversies that surround it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Major Findings|url=http://www.cmpa.com/files/1995-1.pdf|accessdate=August 10, 2015|work=Media Monitor|issue=IX|date=December 1995}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The research published was the result of quantitative [[content analysis]] of television, print, and radio [[news]].

==Funding==

The media watchdog group [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR) has challenged CMPA's non-partisan claim, based on the argument that much of its funding has come from conservative sources, and that its founder, Dr. [[S. Robert Lichter]], once held a chair in [[mass communications]] at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] and was a [[Fox News]] contributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2515|title=Study of Bias or Biased Study?|last=Press Release|date=May 14, 1992|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hart|first=Peter|author2=Steve Rendall|date=July–August 1998|title=Meet the Myth-Makers: Right-Wing Media Groups Provide Ammo for "Liberal Media" Claims|journal=Extra!|url=http://www.fair.org/extra/9807/myth-makers.html|access-date=2008-09-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511200412/http://www.fair.org/extra/9807/myth-makers.html#|archive-date=2008-05-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a ''Washington Post'' article referred to CMPA as "[[conservative]]," the ''Post'' published a "Clarification," which concluded, "The Center describes itself as nonpartisan, and its studies have been cited by both conservative and liberal commentators."&lt;ref&gt;"Clarification," ''Washington Post'', February 9, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Regional Center for the Promotion of Books in Latin America and Caribbean''' '''(CERLALC)''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish:]] ''Centro Regional para el Fomento del Libro en América Latina y el Caribe''''',''' {{lang-pt|Centro Regional para o Fomento do Livro na América Latina e no Caribe}}) is an [[intergovernmental organization]] sponsored by [[UNESCO]]. The organization's headquarters are located in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]. Its main goal is to foster favorable conditions for the development of reading communities in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]].

CERLALC has 21 member states and the organization aims its activities toward  book production and distribution; the promotion of reading and writing, the training of the actors of the book-publishing process and the stimulation and protection of intellectual creation. In this regard, it provides technical assistance in the formulation of public policies, generates knowledge, disseminates specialized information, develops and promotes training processes and promotes spaces for dialogue and cooperation.

== History ==
The establishment of CERLALC was part of [[UNESCO]]’s program for the promotion of books, which took place during UNESCO’s 14th general conference in Paris, in 1966. The original project included the creation of four centres for the promotion of book production in the world: Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Arab States. The result of this conference was the beginning of one of the most successful experiences in regional integration projects around the book.

On September 7th, 1967, the Colombian government requested UNESCO that the multilateral approaches for book promotion be extended to Latin America in the Program and Budget for the years 1969-1970. The request included the creation of a regional centre for the promotion of books in Latin America as a focal point for efforts aimed at promoting the free circulation and growth of regional book production and distribution.

Through Act 0253 of February 20th, 1970, the Colombian government gave authorization to four local organizations to create the first board of directors of the centre. These organizations were [[Instituto Caro y Cuervo]], Instituto Colombiano de Cultura, Colcultura , Instituto Colombiano para el Fomento de la Educación Superior, [[ICFES]] and Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje, [[National Training Service (Colombia)|SENA]]. The national organization was named Centro Regional para el Fomento del libro en América Latina, CERLAL. (The second “C” letter was added at a later date). The Ministers of Education and Foreign Affairs, along with the National Planning Department of Colombia, were also part of this board.

On March 3, 1970, the founding act was signed, while decree 2290 established the bylaws of CERLALC as a national organism. Following this, On April 23, 1971, in Bogotá, the Colombian government and UNESCO signed an international cooperation agreement whereby Colombia committed to transforming the organization created in 1970 into a Regional Centre. This instrument allowed the addition of all Spanish-speaking countries. The Colombian congress gave its approval through Law 27 of 1971. Gradually, in the first four years, several countries of the region joint the regional project. These active countries members  have been: Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Costa Rica, Chile, Ecuador, Panamá, Paraguay, República Dominicana, Uruguay and Venezuela.

The Agreement of International Cooperation between UNESCO and the Colombian government that governs until today, was signed in Paris on August 1, 1984 and ratified in Colombia by Law 65 of November 20, 1986. In this international agreement, the reach of the centre was extended to other geographic and linguistic areas, including the Caribbean region (Hence the second “C” letter) and to the countries of the Lusitanian Hispanic linguistic unit, even those outside geographical Latin America.

== Milestones ==

* During the 14th session of UNESCO's General conference, the working framework for strengthening book production and traffic throughout developing worlds was formalized. There was an expert assembly convened by UNESCO in 1969, advising the creation in Bogotá, of a Center for the Promotion of the Book in Latin America, helping as a focal point for cooperation to promote the free circulation and growth of production and regional distribution of books.
* In April 23, 1971 the Colombian government and UNESCO signed a mutual international cooperation agreement through which the Colombian government's pledge to turn the local Center, created in 1970, into a regional Center, was approved. When the restructuring was completed, the institution was entirely open to form any bond with all Spanish-speaking countries.
* On the same year, the first actions to promote the Center were undertaken, starting with several training and formation programs focused on publishing production, production seminars and seminars about production and distribution of books. In the same way, the Center, alongside with ALALC (Asociación Latinoamericana de Libre Comercio, the predecessor company to ALADI), developed some activities about information and regional integration.
* In 1975, the growth of the Latin American cooperation network reached an extension of 13 member states. The starting countries were Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Spain, Panama, Paraguay, Dominican Republic, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The network helped create book policies developed by Argentina and Colombia and supported by CERLALC. Additionally, the approach of the integration organisms helped enhance the common market of books, a blueprint for ISBN implementation, along with a number of co-edition and bibliographic database projects.
* In January 1977, the Colombian government and UNESCO renewed the agreement signed in 1971. It would be extended until December 31, 1982.
* In February 1979, in a seminar about Children's book publishing, there was a proposal, which suggested the creation and design of a Latin American co-edition publishing program, focused on children and young adults. The main purpose was to bring a new outreach for regional cultural diversity and broaden the quality of the bid sideways to save costs.
* In August of that same year, during the first Latin American co-edition assembly, the idea grew larger and, in March 1982, the group published its first edition of “Cuentos, mitos y leyendas de América Latina” with a print-run of 20.000 copies.
* In 1982, Cerlal reached an agreement with the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) to promote the use of this identifier in Latin America. The only available agencies were in Mexico (1977) and Brazil (1978), therefore the creation of agencies was encouraged in several countries such as Argentina (1982), Costa Rica (1983), Colombia (1984), Venezuela (1984), Ecuador (1986), Chile(1986), Cuba(1989) Uruguay(1990) and Peru (1995).
* Between 1984 and 1985, the Latin America Traveling Exhibition of Illustrations and Books for Children and Young People was introduced to the public. The CERLALC lead the way to garner greater attention and visibility over children's books, especially illustrated books. This presentation spread the work of graphic illustrators working in the area, increased awareness on the topic in the countries, and inspired the creation of academic programs on illustration.
* In 1988, CERLALC organized a first ISBN agencies meeting in Latin America. In this meeting, all beneficiary countries who had received support, were given a practical seminar on ISBN.
* In 1991, the first ISBN assigning software in Latin America was developed. Following this, in coordination with the ISBN agencies of Venezuela and Colombia, the first version of the Integrated Administration program of ISBN Agencies (PAII) was created.
* In 1993, the Guayaquil type law was drafted and, through this Book law, actions were pursued to promote publishing industries, granting tax exemptions and public purchases. Likewise, this law promoted the intellectual creation, reading promotion, and defense of copyright. It is important to mention this text became a mechanism for the homogenization of the national book legislations standing as an example of standards to Ibero-American lawmakers.
* In August 1994, CERLALC gathered a general meeting, all of the copyright chair holders from the main Latin America universities were invited at the request of UNESCO. In this meeting, UNESCO gave the attending professors relevant information about the UNITWIN program hosted by UNESCO chairs, to set up a network of university lecturers on copyright in the region. On 1995, began the implementation of UNITWIN UNESCO chair program on copyright and related rights in Latin America.
* In 1998, during the 8th Ibero-American Conference of Heads of State and Governments, the Ibero-American Integrated Sales book directory, or ''Repertorio Integrado de Libros en Venta en Iberoamérica'' (RILVI) was created. The main purposes were to collect all the relevant data about the ISBN records and titles linked to national ISBN agencies. The CERLALC was the promoter and main creator of the first regional inventory of editorial offers. On 2010, RILVI stopped being a summit feature program and was turned into a permanent CERLALC activity.
* In 1998, the Ibero-American Cooperation Program on Public Libraries or ''Programa Iberoamericana de Cooperación en materia de Bibliotecas Públicas'' (PICBIP) was created. During the same year, in November, in Cartagena de Indias was held the Ibero-American Encounter of National Managers of Public Libraries. The General Directorate of Books, Archives and Libraries of the Ministry of Education and Culture of Spain, organized and hosted this event, with the sponsorship of the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation or ''Agencia Española de Cooperación Internacional'' (AECI)  and the help of CERLALC. The main goal of this encounter was to start a steady funding mechanism to exchange data, experiences and allow the development of joint actions.
* In 2003, the XIII Summit of Ibero-American Presidents and Heads of State approved the Ibero-American Reading Plan (ILIMITA) at Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia.
* In September 2004, the first Meeting of National Reading Managers was held in Cartagena. In this meeting, the first white paper was presented to the 21 states of Ibero-America. This document included the reading political agenda, which included eleven main concerns about public reading policies. Note should also be taken on the presented recommendations to reach the settled goals, the actions and methods to promote reading throughout an integral perspective which involves the state-will and also to promote a stronger cooperation of different stakeholders on this subject.
* In 2006, the National Network of Reading Plans (Redplanes) was created by a group of entities and people concerned with supporting the search for strategies to streamline policy formulation, and its translation into concrete actions in favor of written culture.
* Also in 2006, a General Experts Assembly was held to discuss the implementation of public policies on copyright. The results of this event, organized by CERLALC, were included in the publication “Diagnosis of copyright in Latin America”. This document outlined the institutional reality of copyright in the region. Also, it highlighted the importance of having an observatory in charge to promote the measurement of the economic impact of creative industries in the region. The results showed that these industries were a key factor for the dissemination of specialized information on copyright. Therefore, it led to the subsequent creation of the Ibero-American Copyright Observatory (ODAI).
* In 2007, the RISBN software was developed. It was a partnership work between CERLALC and the Colombian Book Chamber to develop a software which provided an ease of request to ISBN online. This program would work with all available minimum metadata generated by ONIX.
* In 2010, CERLALC via Ibero-American Copyright Observatory, and a partnership with British council, published two documents named “Creative economy: An introductory guide” and “A practical guide to map the creative industries”. These documents remarked the importance of cultural goods and services in minimizing the impact of political polarization and economic inequality. Simultaneously, these documents gave general guidelines about public policies to measure the impact of creative industries on gross domestic product and job creation, as well as designing promotional strategies for industries protected by copyright in local economies.
* In 2011, a law model, consulted with a group of Ibero-American experts, was presented, its purpose was to give all Latin American countries a mechanism to achieve a formulation for the new book, reading culture and libraries laws. Also, this law model would help deal with the components of the sector in a balanced way, as well as making progress in the construction of reading societies.
* In 2011, the Ibero-American Cooperation Program in Public Libraries (PICBIP) evaluated the overall balance of its first decade, the results showed that the project's scope was limited. Following these results, the Iberbibliotecas Program was created, to contribute to the development and strengthening of public libraries in Latin America.
* In June 2013,CERLAC convened the Intergovernmental Panel “''Nueva Agenda por el libro y la lectura: Recomendaciones para Políticas Públicas en Iberoamerica''”  wherein were presented the further roads to action and suggestions to the local governments regarding book policies. Deputies from 17 states, members and agents from UNESCO, composed this panel during this event, CERLALC identified the most pressing needs of the region to accompany the implementation of the new agenda for books and reading.
* Between 2014 and 2015, there was an important online training course taken by 6.000 educative agents charged with tending to early childhood. The purpose of this course was the promotion of reading, children's literature, art, culture and expressive language skills. This training course was under the framework “''Fiesta de la Lectura''”, sponsored by Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar (ICBF), whose main aim was to guarantee the conditions for the development of communicative, expressive and reading skills in children from 0 to 6 years of age.
* In November 2015, CERLALC invited five Latin American subject experts on the early childhood sector. These special guests discussed topics related to education, reading culture, and comprehensive care regarding this children population. The attending experts were Eva Janovitz (Mexico), María Emilia López (Argentina), Patricia Pereira Leite (Brazil), Evelio Cabrejo (Colombia) and Yolanda Reyes (Colombia). The discussion highlighted once again the importance of several key aspects for making small children active subjects of practices around written and oral language. As a result, they established the main theoretical guidelines to promote the creation of the Ibero-American Observatory of Culture and Education for the Early Childhood (OPI).
* In 2016, the exhibition “''Contra Viento y Marea''” was held. In it, 150 successful projects from different Latin-American countries were collected. These projects presented government initiatives for the promotion of reading and democratic access to books between the end of the 19th century and the first decade of the 2000s. Besides this, CERLALC celebrated the 30th anniversary of the International Book Fair of Guadalajara, with Latin-America as a guest of honour at the book fair. The second edition of “''Contra Viento y Marea''” was held within the framework of the 30th celebration of Bogotá's Book Fair, 2017.
* In 2017, the VI Meeting of the Ibero-American Network of Policy Makers and Reading Plans was held. During the event, agents from 15 ''Redplanes'' member countries met with regional teams of institutions linked to the National Reading Plan of Chile. The Valparaíso Declaration emerged from this meeting; it reaffirms the importance of strengthening regulatory, legislative and budgetary frameworks to guarantee the continuity of the plans.
* In 2018, the Colombian government implemented a statute to safeguard orphaned literary works. They took into account the basis of a proposal by the CERLALC, presented in 2015 and endorsed by the Centre of academic and political spaces in 2018. The amendment to Law 23 of 1982 on copyright and related rights, made through Law 1915 of 2018, is a tool of special value for promoting the development of libraries in Colombia and implementing new strategies to promote access to a wide diversity of contents for users.

== Organizational structure ==
The CERLALC is composed by a council. This superior organism is in charge to approve all of the political guidelines which rule the CERLALC. The council meeting is biennial and it is composed (made-up) by:

== Action lines ==
To fulfil its main statements, CERLALC leads and supports local and regional actions in the following plans of action.

* '''Consultancy and technical help:'''  The Cerlalc offers a wide variety of services related to its member states. Among these services, it is possible to find design, upgrade and achievement of the publishing industrial policies, libraries systems, reading promotion and copyright.
* '''Investigation:''' The specialized knowledge creation is primarily deemed to inform and follow the consecution of public policies in the Ibero-American region. It also helps to foster strategic decisions with private, public and the civil society sectors around the development of reading societies.
* '''Formation:''' Cerlalc has set the backbone to promote the reading societies throughout programs which fulfill the vital need of technical help in the state members. These programs turn around the reading promotion, libraries and copyright. Besides, these courses, on-site and virtual, are a reliable option to reach general and specific objectives on joint projects.
* '''Publishing:'''The publishing activities are en route to give visibility and dissemination to the researches carried by the Center and its experts' advisors. In addition to the above,  the main focus of these projects is to build an international inventory, in order to develop thinking and the actors' labor of the region and the world.
* '''Projects:''' The articulation of these permanent programs requires cooperation between different sectors in Ibero-American societies. These programs integrate the public and private sectors to achieve the specific objectives that promote knowledge management closely aligned with the center's mission objectives and specialized programs.

== Headquarters ==
CERLALC's first headquarters was granted by Colombia's Ministry of Education. It was located in the historical center of Bogotá. Due to staff extension, a new headquarters was needed soon after. That is why in 1973, the CERLALC acquired its new and current main office.

Two different [[crucifix]]es, or strictly, wooden ''corpus'' figures for crucifixes, are attributed to the [[High Renaissance]]  master [[Michelangelo]], although neither is universally accepted as his.  Both are relatively small figures which would have been produced in Michelangelo's youth.

==Santo Spirito figure==
One is a [[polychrome]] wood sculpture possibly finished in 1492 which had been lost from view by scholars until it re-emerged in 1962; in 2001 new investigations appeared to confirm the attribution to Michelangelo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1444780.stm  Crucifix 'confirmed' as a Michelangelo]. [[BBC News]], 18 July 2001. Retrieved on 18  May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It was perhaps made for the [[high altar]] of the Church of [[Santo Spirito di Firenze|Santa Maria del Santo Spirito]] in [[Florence]], Italy. The work is especially notable for the fact that this Christ is naked.

== History ==
[[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] was a guest of the convent of Santa Maria del Santo Spirito (Florence) when he was seventeen years old, after the death of his protector [[Lorenzo de' Medici]]. Here he could make anatomical studies of the corpses coming from the convent's hospital; in exchange, he is said to have sculpted the wooden crucifix which was placed over the high altar. Today the crucifix is in the octagonal sacristy of the [[Santo Spirito, Florence|Basilica of Santa Maria del Santo Spirito]].

== Description ==
The nudity of the figure is true to the Gospels.  Christ's clothing being removed by Roman soldiers is offered as the fulfilment of {{bibleverse|Psalm|22:18|NIV}}, "They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture."  All of the Gospel writers suggest the nakedness, while John supplies the details:

{{cquote|Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.  They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, ‘They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots.’ These things therefore the soldiers did.}}

The [[INRI|sign attached to the cross]] includes Jesus' accusation inscribed in Hebrew, Greek and Latin. The wording translates "Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews".  All of the evangelists record this inscription, which varies slightly among them.  Here the artist favored the rendering from John's Gospel ({{bibleverse|John|19:19|NIV}}).

Also present is the spear wound inflicted into Jesus’ side by a Roman soldier.  His blood is seen here dripping from the wound on his right side.

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Virgin and Child (Durán Madonna) - Prado P02722.jpg|280px|thumb|''Durán Madonna'', c. 1435–38. 100 cm × 52 cm. Oil on oak wood. [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid. Frame not captured in this reproduction.]] 
'''''Durán Madonna''''' (also known as the '''''Madonna in Red''''' or '''''Virgin and Child in a Niche'''''&lt;ref&gt;Nosow, ix&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''Madonna Enthroned''''') is an oil on oak [[panel painting]] completed sometime between 1435 and 1438 by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Netherlandish painter]] [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. The painting derives from [[Jan van Eyck| Jan van Eyck's]] ''[[Ince Hall Madonna]]'' and was much imitated subsequently.&lt;ref name= "Panofsky 259"&gt;Panofsky p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Now in the [[Museo del Prado|Prado]], Madrid, it depicts a seated and serene [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] dressed in a long, flowing red robe lined with gold-coloured thread. She cradles the child Jesus who sits on her lap, playfully leafing backwards through a holy book or manuscript on which both figures' gazes rest. But unlike van Eyck's earlier treatment, van der Weyden not only positions his Virgin and Child in a Gothic [[apse]] or [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] as he had his two earlier madonnas (the ''[[Madonna Standing (van der Weyden)|Madonna Standing]]'' and the ''[[Virgin and Child Enthroned (van der Weyden)|Virgin and Child Enthroned]]''), but also places them on a projecting plinth, thus further emphasising their sculptural impression.&lt;ref name= "Panofsky 259"/&gt;

Christ appears much older than in most contemporary paintings of this kind. He is far from an infant, and is very realistically and physically rendered. He is shown as a small child, with none of the softness of usual 15th-century depictions of the Virgin and Child.&lt;ref name="N146"&gt;Nosow, 146&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is characterised by the sculptural look that van der Weyden often favoured, and for its similarity in colourisation to his c. 1435 ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'' (Madrid) and c. 1442–45 ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' (Berlin).

The painting was acquired by Pedro Fernández-Durán in 1899 at the [[Palace of Infante don Luis (Boadilla del Monte)|Palacio de Boadilla]], Madrid. He donated the work to the [[Museo del Prado]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="C50" /&gt;

==Description==
Mary is shown in a long, red, hooded robe and white headdress, with the Child Jesus in a white shirt seated on her lap. He curiously leafs through and crumples the pages of a book perched on his mother's knee. The book is placed at the very center of the panel, symbolising the centrality of the divine Word in Christian belief.&lt;ref name="N146" /&gt; According to the Prado, the book itself represents an allusion to the "Holy Scriptures that announce Christ's redemptive mission."&lt;ref name="prado"&gt;"[http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/virgin-and-child-1/ Virgin and Child]". [[Museo del Prado]]. Retrieved 13 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; An angel in dark grey dress hovers above Mary's head, holding a pearl-encrusted crown destined for her upon her assumption as [[Queen of Heaven]].&lt;ref name="N146" /&gt; Mary's long robe swirls around the pictorial space, obscuring her throne and eventually falling at the support by her feet.&lt;ref name="N146" /&gt; They are framed by a sculpted [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] or apse with Gothic [[tracery]] similar to that found in van der Weyden's ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]''.&lt;ref name="N145"&gt;Nosow, 145&lt;/ref&gt; The curved arches of the niche echo the lines of her figure as she bends protectively over the child. These curved lines and warm colours give the work its sense of internal harmony.&lt;ref name="N145" /&gt;

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Virgin and Child (Durán Madonna) - Prado P02722 (Detail).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Detail showing the restless child leafing through the parchments of the holy book.]]
Art-historical analysis in the early to mid 20th century placed little emphasis on Christ's older age for a "Virgin and Child" work of this period. Nor did it emphasise the significance of the manuscript or the rough manner in which Christ seems to energetically leaf through it, his play watched on by a near-indulgent&lt;!--hm--&gt; Mary. More recently, art historians such as [[Alfred Acres]] have questioned the significance of the child's freedom of movement and naturalistic portrayal in such a deliberately elegant and poised work—especially in the work of such a self-aware and compositionally involved painter as van der Weyden. Acres believes that the book is central to the understanding of the painting, and notes its perfect centrality in the panel; it is the focus of both figures' gazes and hands, and Christ is apparently leafing ''backwards'' through the pages, towards the beginning.&lt;ref name="A77"&gt;Acres, 77&lt;/ref&gt; While Christ's right hand holds a number of parchments scrunched together and he pays no attention to them, his more careful left hand is about to open the lower left corner of the open page. If it is reasonably assumed that the book held open on Mary's lap is facing towards her, it seems the child is leafing backwards through the pages. While holy books were often included in 15th-century northern depictions of the Virgin, they were usually associated with the idea of the Virgin as a representation of learning or wisdom; in no other contemporary painting are they turned through with such restless energy, not to mention being turned through from end to beginning.&lt;ref name="A79"&gt;Acres, 79&lt;/ref&gt; Acres suggests that the infant Christ is leafing back towards [[Book of Genesis|Genesis: 3]] describing the [[Fall of Man]], citing three other works where van der Weyden similarly articulates the [[Redemption (theology)|redemptive theme]], including the '' Madonna Standing'' panel in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] where the Madonna is flanked by figures of Adam and Eve.&lt;ref name= "A90"&gt;Acres, 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Panofsky 261"&gt;''c.f.'' Panofsky p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Virgin and Child (Durán Madonna) - detail2.jpg|thumb|290px|Detail showing the dark winged angel hovering under the Niche holding the crown above Mary's head.]]
Art historian [[Lorne Campbell (Art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] believes the painting was influenced by [[Robert Campin]]'s Frankfurt ''[[commons:File:Robert Campin - Virgin and Child - WGA14434.jpg|Virgin and Child]]'' both in [[ideal of feminine beauty|the ideal of feminine beauty]] it presents and for its elegant use of long folded draperies. Campbell notes that both works are composed from strong diagonal lines, with the main figures pushed out into the center foreground, in an almost [[trompe-l'œil]] manner.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 19&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ''Durán Madonna'' is often compared to van der Weyden's ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'', both for the colourisation of Mary's dress and for a sculptural look similar to the reliefs shown in the earlier triptych. In addition, the underdrawing of Mary's head is strikingly similar to that of the kindly, idealised Madonna in his ''Froimont Diptych'' (after 1460), now in the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen|Musée des Beaux-Arts]], [[Caen]].&lt;ref&gt;Hand et al., 259&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these strong similarities, attribution to van der Weyden is not doubted, although the work is known to have been frequently copied in Spain after it was relocated there&lt;ref name="C50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt; sometime in the 16th century.

The black overpaint behind the Virgin was probably added at the request of a later 18th-century seller, most likely in an attempt to fashion the piece as a genre work and downplay its religious theme. Research aided by X-ray has been inconclusive and has found no lost detail or drawing beneath the thick layers of paint.&lt;ref name="C50"&gt;Campbell, 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illusionary devices==
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Portrait Diptych of Laurent Froimont (left wing) - WGA25697.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Left wing of van der Weyden's ''Froimont Diptych'', after 1460. [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen|Musée des Beaux-Arts]], [[Caen]].]]

Van der Weyden often depicted lifelike and voluminous figures set in shallow sculptural spaces, in which they seemed cramped and larger than scale. The space filled by the figures is undefined and ambiguously located. Mary and the child are supported by a projecting [[corbel]], the three-dimensionality of which gives the disorienting impression that the figures are part of a [[relief]] in a much larger work of art. This gives the work a dizzying and dislocated perspective; its own unique sense of space and placement.&lt;ref&gt;Nosow, 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is an early example of van der Weyden's habit of rendering his figures with the appearance of [[polychrome]] sculptures, an effect here accentuated by the neutral background.&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt; Van der Weyden's tendency to blur the line between sculpture and paint in an illusionistic manner can be see most effectively in his  ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]''. Art historian Robert Nosow notes the architectural aspect of the gothic frame, and the manner in which the lines of the Virgin and child make them seem as if statues come to life.&lt;ref name="N145" /&gt; Art historian Shirley Neilsen Blum writes that the faux sculptural elements, "force[s] the viewer to continually confront the seemingly real presence of two media, sculpture and painting&amp;nbsp;... Rogier defies logic and therefore enhances the magical quality of the image. Divinity is stressed because it has transcended media definition."&lt;ref&gt;Blum, 103&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eoin McKiernan''', M.A., PhD, D.Litt. (10 May 1915 – 18 July 2004), was one of the major early scholars in the interdisciplinary field of Irish Studies in the United States and the founder of the Irish American Cultural Institute. He is credited with leading efforts to revive and preserve Irish culture and language in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Eoin McKiernan, 89, Led Efforts to Revive Irish Culture in the United States," Los Angeles Times, 22 July 2004. http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/22/local/me-passings22.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://irishamerica.com/2014/05/the-last-word-the-father-of-irish-studies/&lt;/ref&gt; A biography, Irish America Reawakening:  The Eoin McKiernan Story, describes his life's work in full.

Born John Thomas McKiernan in New York City, Dr. McKiernan adopted the old Irish form of his name, Eoin, early in his life. While in college, he won a scholarship to study Irish language in the [[Connemara Gaeltacht]] in the west of Ireland, galvanising his commitment to the language, a cause he championed throughout life. In 1938, he married Jeannette O'Callaghan, whom he met while studying Irish at the Gaelic Society in New York City. They raised nine children. In Jeannette's death (22 December 1996) he lost his greatest patron.

Dr. McKiernan attended seminary at Cathedral College and St. Joseph's in New York, leaving before ordination. He earned degrees in English and Classical Languages (AB, St Joseph College, NY, 1948), Education and Psychology (EdM, UNH, 1951), and American Literature and Psychology (PhD, Penn State, 1957). Later in life, McKiernan was awarded honorary doctorates from the National University of Ireland, Dublin [1969]; the College of St. Rose, Albany [1984]; Marist College, Poughkeepsie [1987]; and the University of St. Thomas, St. Paul [1996].

Passion for Irish culture was the dominant undercurrent of a distinguished teaching career in secondary (Pittsfield, NH, 1947–49) and university levels ([[SUNY Geneseo|State University of New York at Geneseo]], 1949–59, and University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, MN, 1959–72). McKiernan served as an officer of the National Council of College Teachers of English, was appointed by the Governor of NY to a State Advisory Committee to improve teacher certification standards, and served as a Consultant to the US Department of Education in the early 1960s.

Dr. McKiernan suggested to the Irish government in 1938 that a cultural presence in the United States would promote a deeper understanding between the two countries, but he eventually realised that if this were to happen, he would have to lead the way. His opportunity came in 1962, when he was asked to present a series on public television. Entitled "Ireland Rediscovered," the series was so popular that another, longer series, "Irish Diary," was commissioned. Both series aired nationwide. The enthusiastic response provided the impetus to establish the [[Irish American Cultural Institute]] (IACI, 1962). In 1972 he resigned from teaching to devote his energy entirely to the IACI.

Under Dr. McKiernan's direction, the IACI published the scholarly journal ''Eire-Ireland'', with subscribers in 25 countries, and the informational bi-monthly publication ''Ducas''. The IACI still sponsors the Irish Way (an immersion program for US teenagers); several speaker series (Irish Fortnight, the Luncheon Circle, Perceptions); a reforestation program in Ireland (Trees for Ireland); theatre events in both countries; and educational tours in Ireland.  He continued these educational Ireland tours well into his retirement; his daughter, Deirdre, now leads them.

Perhaps his most outstanding contribution was the awards given to the arts in Ireland, beginning with original prose and poetry in Irish, then expanding to include works in English, and ultimately, art and music. At his suggestion, the Institute financed the world premiere, in Springfield, MA, of [[A. J. Potter]]'s Symphony No. 2. Coming at a time when the Irish government had little funding available, these awards were, according to many recipients, life-saving. (''Irish Times'' 2 November 1971 (editorial), 24 January 1973, 21 September 1983, among others.)

Troubled by the biased reporting of events in Northern Ireland in the 1970s, Dr. McKiernan established an Irish News Service, giving Irish media and public figures direct access to American outlets. In the 1990s, he was invited by the Ditchley Foundation to be part of discussions aimed at bringing peace to that troubled area and was a participant [1992] in a three-day conference in London dealing with civil rights in Northern Ireland. Organized by Liberty, a London civil rights group, the conference was also attended by UN, European Community, and Helsinki representatives.

Dr. McKiernan also founded Irish Books and Media, which was, for forty years, the largest distributor of Irish printed materials in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=Uxo7KTBKkJQC&amp;pg=PA436&amp;lpg=PA436&amp;dq=irish+books+and+media&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7f-rjv96aA&amp;sig=EGLKMpao0oVA2V-Lzn6NVZxmU6o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5TkrVYfAM8WXNqWogKgG&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=irish%20books%20and%20media&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; In his eighth decade, he established Irish Educational Services, which funded children’s TV programs in Irish and provided monies for Irish language schools in Northern Ireland. ''Irish America'' magazine twice named him one of the Irish Americans of the year; in 1999, they chose him as one of the greatest Irish Americans of the 20th century.

Actively involved in matters of Irish interest well into his ninth decade, Dr. Eoin McKiernan died on 18 July 2004, in St. Paul, Minnesota, surrounded by his family. He was preceded in death by his wife, Jeannette, and is survived by their nine children, Deirdre, Kevin, Brendan, Nuala, Ethna, Fergus, Grania, Gillisa, and Liadan, as well as many grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nieces, and nephews.&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Eoin McKiernan RIP," The Irish Emigrant, 20 July 2004. http://www.emigrant.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37057&amp;Itemid=202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://irishecho.com/2011/10/mckiernan-brought-mlks-message-east/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/seamus-mckiernan/st-patricks-day-ireland_b_4976705.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://journalstar.com/niche/star-city-health/inspiration/strength-and-spirit-fuel-alex-mckiernan-s-rehab-journey/article_5249e8a8-8676-52b1-882c-2edc904dd63a.html&lt;/ref&gt; On his death, the Irish Times (20 July 2004), referred to him as the "US Champion of Irish culture and history . . . a patriarch of Irish Studies in the US who laid the ground for the explosion of interest in Irish arts in recent years.” &lt;ref&gt;"US champion of Irish history and culture dies."

An '''equitable right''' is a [[legal right]] guaranteed by [[Equity (law)|equity]] as opposed to a legal right which derives authority from a legal source. An example of an equitable right could be seen in [[Land law]], where mention is made of a beneficial interest i.e. vested interests in an estate which are protected by equity. In essence, a contributor to the purchase of a [[property]], has an equitable right to that property albeit not being the registered proprietor.

'''Euphuism''' is a peculiar mannered style of English [[prose]]. It takes its name from a prose romance  by [[John Lyly]]. It consists of a preciously ornate and sophisticated style, employing a deliberate excess of literary devices such as [[antitheses]], [[alliteration]]s, repetitions and  [[rhetorical question]]s. Classical learning and remote knowledge of all kinds are displayed. Euphuism was fashionable in the 1580s, especially in the [[Elizabethan]] court.

==''Euphues'' (1580)==
[[File:Campaspe.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''[[Campaspe (play)|Campaspe]]'' by John Lily, 1584]]

"Euphues" is the Greek for "graceful, witty". [[John Lyly]] published the works ''[[Euphues (1578)|Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit]]'' (1578) and ''Euphues and his England'' (1580). Both works illustrated the intellectual fashions and favourite themes of Renaissance society&amp;mdash;in a highly artificial and mannered style. The plots are unimportant, existing merely as structural elements on which to display conversations, discourses and letters mostly concerning the subject of love. Its essential features had already appeared in such works as [[George Pettie]]'s ''A Petite Pallace of Pettie his pleasure'' (1576), in [[sermon]] literature, and Latin tracts. Lyly perfected the distinctive rhetorical devices on which the style was based.

==Principles==
The euphuistic sentence followed principles of balance and antithesis to their extremes, purposely using the latter regardless of sense. John Lyly set up three basic structural principles:
#phrases of equal length that appear in succession;
#the balance of key verbal elements in successive sentences;
#the correspondence of sounds and syllables, especially between words that are already balanced against each other.

==Examples==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is virtue, yea virtue, gentlemen, that maketh gentlemen; that maketh the poor rich, the base-born noble, the subject a sovereign, the deformed beautiful, the sick whole, the weak strong, the most miserable most happy. There are two principal and peculiar gifts in the nature of man, knowledge and reason; the one commandeth, and the other obeyeth: these things neither the whirling wheel of fortune can change, neither the deceitful cavillings of worldlings separate, neither sickness abate, neither age abolish". (''Euphues, the Anatomy of Wit'')
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Is it not far better to abhor sins by the remembrance of others' faults, than by repentance of thine own follies?" (''Euphues, 1, lecture by the wise Neapolitan)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Can any treasure in this transitory pilgrimmage be of more value than a friend? In whose bosom thou mayest sleep secure without fear, whom thou mayest make partner of all thy secrets without suspicion of fraud, and partaker of all thy misfortune without mistrust of fleeting. Who will account thy bale his bane, thy mishap his misery, the pricking of thy finger the piercing of his heart" (Euphues)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"How frantic are those lovers which are carried away with the gay glistering of the fine face? The beauty whereof is parched with the summer's blaze and chipped with the winter's blast: which is of so short continuance, that it fadeth before one perceive it flourish". (Euphues' after-dinner speech to the 'coy' Neapolitan ladies on whether the qualities of the mind or the composition of the man are more worthy).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Time hath weaned me from my mother's teat, and age rid me from my father's correction". (Lucilla, considering her father's reaction in abandoning her fiance Philanthus for Euphues).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A sharp sore hath a short cure" (Euphues)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As they be hard to be won without trial of great faith, so are they hard to be lost without great cause of fickleness". (Euphues to Lucilla on the quality of 'fervency' in women).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But alas Euphues, what truth can there be found in a traveller? What stay in a stranger? Whose words and bodies both watch but for a wind, whose feet are ever fleeting, whose faith plighted on the shore, is turned to perjury when they hoist sail". (Lucilla to Euphues).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
Many critics did not appreciate Lyly's deliberate excesses. [[Philip Sidney]] and [[Gabriel Harvey]] castigated his style. 

Lyly's style, however, influenced Shakespeare, who satirised it in speeches by Polonius in ''[[Hamlet]]'' and the florid language of the courtly lovers in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]''; Beatrice and Benedick in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' also made use of it, as did Richard and Lady Anne in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. It was taken up by the Elizabethan writers [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]], [[Thomas Lodge]] and [[Barnabe Rich]]. [[Walter Scott]] satirised it in the character of Sir Piercie Shafton in ''The Monastery'', while [[Charles Kingsley]] defended ''Euphues'' in ''Westward Ho!''.

==Contemporary equivalents in other languages==
Euphuism was not particular to Britain, or a manifestation of some social structure and artistic opportunity unique to that country. There were equivalents in other major European languages, each of which was called by a different name: [[culteranismo]] in [[Spain]], [[Giovan Battista Marino|Marinismo]] in [[Italy]], and [[préciosité]] in [[France]], for example.

A '''figure painting''' is a work of [[fine art]] in any of the [[Painting#Painting media|painting media]] with the primary subject being the human figure, whether clothed or [[Nude (art)|nude]].
Figure painting may also refer to the activity of creating such a work. The human figure has been one of the constant subjects of art since the first stone age cave paintings, and has been reinterpreted in various styles throughout history.
==Depicting figures==
Unlike [[figure drawing]]s which are usually nudes, figure paintings are often [[historical]], [[mythological]], [[allegorical]] or [[Imagination|imaginary]] depictions that may have figures in appropriate costumes. A [[portrait painting]] is a figure painting that focuses on the creation of a likeness of a particular individual or group.

The nude has been a theme in [[Western art]] since [[classical antiquity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in Western Art and its Beginnings in Antiquity,  In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nuba/hd_nuba.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in the [[Renaissance]], after being largely absent during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance,  In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/numr/hd_numr.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- {{quotebox|source=Willem de Kooning|quote=Flesh is the reason oil paint was invented}} --&gt;
Oil paint historically has been the ideal media for depicting the figure. By blending and layering paint, the surface can become more like skin. "Its slow drying time and various degrees of viscosity enable the artist to achieve rich and subtle blends of color and texture, which can suggest transformations from one human substance to another."&lt;ref&gt;Scala, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Although working from [[Model (art)|live models]] is preferred, the length of time needed to complete a painting has led most modern painters to use photographs as references at least part of the time if not for the entire work.

Figure painting is not synonymous with [[figurative art]], which may depict real objects of any kind (including humans and animals).

'''''Girl Heroes: The New Force In Popular Culture''''' is a 2002 text by Susan Hopkins. It is a [[cultural analysis]] of the contemporary [[archetype]] of the girl hero in popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lumby|first=Catharine|title=Girl Power Besting the Net. "Girl Heroes: The New Force in Popular Culture" by Susan Hopkins |journal=Australian Book Review|date=November 2002|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2328/1473|quote="Girl Heroes" is a book that meditates deeply on the question of the image and objectification, and on what's at stake in the Nietzschean ideal of aesthetic subjectivity, a realm in which the divisions between illusion and reality, art and life, dissolve. Indeed, one of the things that makes this book so pleasurable to read is that the author has such a confident grasp of the ethical and broader philosophical terrain in which she's working that she's able to make it sound simple.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins argues for a link between the 1990s British band [[Spice Girls]], their vision of [[Girl Power|girl power]], and the creation of a new kind of "girl hero". Hopkins also explores the roles of figures such as [[supermodel]]s, [[magical girl]]s, [[Carmen Sandiego (character)|Carmen Sandiego]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Lara Croft]], [[Xena]], [[Dana Scully]], the [[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels (the 2000s version)]], [[Sabrina Spellman]], [[Mulan (Disney character)|Mulan]],  and [[Buffy Summers]].

She also draws comparisons between these images and earlier ones, such as [[Emma Peel]] of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', the 1970s television show ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'', [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and the ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' TV show of the 1970s, pointing out the relative independence of this archetype from male and parental support.

'''Grey Owl''' was the name British-born '''Archibald Belaney''' (September 18, 1888 – April 13, 1938) chose for himself when he started pretending to be a [[First Nations]] person. While he achieved fame as a conservationist during his life, after his death the revelation of his non-[[Indigenous peoples in the Americas|Native]] origins and other autobiographical fabrications negatively affected his reputation.

Born in England and migrating to Canada in the first decade of the 20th century, Belaney rose to prominence as a notable author, lecturer, and one of the "most effective apostles of the wilderness".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1185502 John Sugden, review of Donald B. Smith, ''From the Land of Shadows: The Making of Grey Owl''], ''American Indian Quarterly'', Summer 1991, accessed 4 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2018}} The pivotal moment of departure for his early conservation work was when he began his relationship with a young [[Iroquois]] woman named [[Anahareo|Gertrude Bernard]], who assisted in his transition from trapper to conservationist.&lt;ref&gt;Grey Owl, ''Pilgrims of the Wild,'' (Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2010), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In working with the National Parks Branch, Grey Owl became the subject of many films, and was established as the "'caretaker of park animals' at Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba" in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Smith, ''From the Land of Shadows: the Making of Grey Owl'', (Saskatoon: Western Prairie Books, 1990), 92&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his numerous articles, books, films and lectures, his views on conservation reached audiences beyond the borders of Canada, challenging people to re-evaluate their relationship with nature. His conservation views largely focused on humans' negative impact on nature through their commodification of nature's resources for profits, and a need for humans to develop a respect for the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Tina Loo, ''States of Nature: Conserving Canada's Wildlife in the Twentieth Century,'' (Vancouver: UBC Press ,2006), 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Archibald Stansfeld Belaney was born in September 1888, near [[Hastings]], [[Sussex]], England.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hayman, "Grey Owl's Wild Goose Chase", ''History Today'' 44.1 (1994): 43&lt;/ref&gt; Born to George Belaney and his wife Katherine (Kittie) Cox, he was mostly of English descent on both sides; his paternal grandfather had come from Scotland and married in England.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Billinghurst. ''The Many Faces of Archie Belaney, Grey Owl'', Vancouver: Grey Stone Books Douglas and McIntyre Publishing Group, 1999, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Smith. ''From the Land of Shadows: the Making of Grey Owl'', Saskatchewan: Western Producer Prairie Books, 1990, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Kittie was his father's second wife. Years before Archie's birth, George Belaney had emigrated to the United States with his then-wife Elizabeth Cox and her younger sister Katherine (Kittie). After Elizabeth's early death, George persuaded Kittie, not yet 20, to marry him, a marriage that would have been [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907|illegal in Britain]]. Within the year they returned to Britain in time for the birth of their son Archie. The family lived together near Hastings until Kittie became pregnant for a second time. George and Kittie Belaney left to return to the United States, where he abandoned her.&lt;ref&gt;Billinghurst, Ibid. 5, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Archie remained in England in the care of his father's mother Juliana Belaney and his father's two younger sisters, Julia Caroline Belaney and Janet Adelaide Belaney,&lt;ref&gt;1861, 1891, 1901, 1911 census&lt;/ref&gt; whom the boy would know as Aunt Carry and Aunt Ada. Kittie visited him a few times.

Belaney later told his publisher his father was Scottish. The Belaney name does have roots in Scotland. One of his biographers documented that Archie's paternal grandfather had moved from Scotland to England, where he became a successful merchant.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Smith. ''From the Land of Shadows the Making of Grey Owl'', Saskatchewan: Western Producer Prairie Books, 1990, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belaney boy attended [[Hastings Grammar School]], where he excelled in subjects such as English, French and chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B Smith. ''From the Land of the Shadows''. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; While outside school, he spent much time reading, or exploring St Helen's Wood near his home.&lt;ref&gt;Lovat Dickson, ''Half- Breed: The Story of Grey Owl'', London: Peter Davis, 1939, p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

As a boy, Belaney was known for pranks, such as using his [[grammar school]] chemistry to make small bombs.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B Smith. ''From the Land of the Shadows.'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; He called them  "Belaney Bombs".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascinated by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], Belaney read about them and drew them in the margins of his books. Belaney left Hastings Grammar School and started work as a clerk with a timber company located behind St Helen's Wood.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ibid, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; There Belaney and his friend George McCormick perfected the arts of knife throwing and marksmanship. Belaney turned his creativity to pursuits other than work. His last event there was lowering fireworks down the chimney of the timber company's office. The fireworks exploded and nearly destroyed the building. After the timber yard fired him, Belaney's aunts let him move to Canada, where he sought adventure.

==Emigration to Canada==
On March 29, 1906 Belaney boarded the ''SS. Canada'' and sailed from Liverpool, UK&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/archive/sheet/22&lt;/ref&gt; for Halifax, CA.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, op cit.&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated ostensibly to study agriculture. After a brief time in [[Toronto]], he moved to [[Temagami]] (''Tema-Augama''), Northern [[Ontario]], where he worked as a [[fur trapper]], a wilderness guide at [[Keewaydin (camp)|Keewaydin camp]], and a [[forest ranger]]. At first he began to sign his name as "Grey Owl".{{Citation need|date=November 2018}} Then he fabricated a Native identity, telling people that he was the child of a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] father and [[Apache Tribe|Apache]] mother. (See the [[Métis people (Canada)|Metis people of Canada]] and the [[North American fur trade]].) He claimed to have emigrated from the U.S. to join the ''[[Ojibwa]]'' in Canada.{{Citation need|date=July 2015}}

==Trapping==
Belaney went to [[Toronto]] to earn money in the retail industry with aims of travelling farther north. Before heading to [[Northern Ontario]] to stay with the Guppy family in [[Lake Timiskaming]], Belaney was keen to become a guide and continued to educate himself in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Donald B.|title=From the Land of Shadows: The Making of Grey Owl|year=1990|publisher=Prairie Books|location=Saskatoon|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before becoming a trapper, Belaney sought first-hand experience to learn the basic skills of a woodsman and apprenticed himself to Bill Guppy, who taught Belaney how to use snow-shoes and the basics of trapping, including how to place several types of trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Donald B.|title=From the Land of Shadows: The Making of Grey Owl|year=1990|publisher=Prairie Books|location=Saskatoon|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Guppy family, he moved to [[Lake Temagami]] (Tema-Augama), Northern Ontario, where he worked as a chore boy at the Temagami Inn. For two years, Belaney worked as a chore boy and also made a trip back to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Donald B.|title=From the Land of Shadows: The Making of Grey Owl|year=1990|publisher=Prairie Books|location=Saskatoon|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return to Lake Temagami, Belaney's fascination with the [[Anishinaabe]] people increased. Belaney set about studying their language and lore while conducting a relationship with [[Ojibwa]] co-worker Angele Egwuna. Egwuna furthered Belaney's knowledge of trapping and fish nets, and also provided access to a network of Ojibwe people.&lt;ref name="Smith 1990 42"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Donald B.|title=From the Land of Shadows: The Making of Grey Owl|year=1990|publisher=Prairie Books|location=Saskatoon|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belaney claims he passionately embraced the cause of the Ojibwe Indians, and that in turn the Ojibwe treated Belaney as one of their own. In 1909, Belaney spent a winter with the Ojibwa trappers, and said he had been adopted as an Ojibwa trapper.&lt;ref name="Smith 1990 42"/&gt; In Donald B. Smith's ''From the Land of Shadows'', it is said that Belaney's greatest lesson was the fragility of the environmental ecosystem, which was influential in forming his conservationist views. On August 23, 1910, he and Angele Egwuna married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Donald B.|title=From the Land of Shadows: The Making of Grey Owl|year=1990|publisher=Prairie Books|location=Saskatoon|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the armed forces==
Belaney enlisted with the Canadian Overseas Expeditionary Force (CEF) on May 6, 1915 during the [[First World War]]. His Regimental number with the CEF was 415259.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} On his attestation papers, he claimed to be born in [[Montreal]] on September 18, 1888, and listed no next of kin. When asked about his marital status, it appears some confusion may have occurred; the word 'yes' was written and then crossed out, then the word 'no' was written and crossed out, leaving his marital status unclear to the military at the time of enlistment. He stated his trade was a 'trapper' and that he previously served as a 'Mexican Scout' with the 28th Dragoons, although this is unclear since the U.S. was not in any significant military actions in the region (other than small operations, in which he could not have served; he would have had to serve between 1904 and 1915).{{clarify|date=March 2013}} Belaney joined the [[13th Battalion (Royal Highlanders of Canada), CEF|13th (Montreal) Battalion]] of the [[The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada|Black Watch]]. His unit was shipped to France, where he served as a [[sniper]]. His comrades accepted his self-presentation as Indian and generally praised his conduct. Belaney was wounded in January 1916, and then more seriously on April 24, 1916, with a shot through the foot. When the wounded limb developed [[gangrene]], Belaney was shipped to Britain for treatment.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

While doctors tried to heal his foot, they moved Belaney from one British [[Hospital|infirmary]] to another for a full year. In Britain, Belaney met again with childhood friend, Constance (Ivy) Holmes, and they married. Their marriage failed in a short time, without his having told Holmes that he was still married to Angele Egwuna, whom he had abandoned but not divorced.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sugden | first = John | title = Reviewed Work: ''From the Land of Shadows: The Making of Grey Owl'' by Donald B.

Belaney was shipped back to Canada in September 1917, where he received an honourable discharge on November 30, with a disability pension.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Early conservation work and change in identity==
[[File:Grey owl feeding beaver a jelly roll.jpg|left|thumb|Belaney/Grey Owl feeding Jelly Roll, his pet beaver.]]
In 1925, then 37-year-old Belaney (now calling himself "Grey Owl" and telling people he was Indigenous) met 19-year-old Gertrude Bernard (aka [[Anahareo]], or Pony), a [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] [[Iroquois]] woman who was to be very influential in his life. She encouraged him to stop trapping and to publish his writing about the wilderness. They had a passionate eight-year affair, beginning with their [[Anishinaabe]] wedding ceremony.&lt;ref name="jrank.org"&gt;[http://www.jrank.org/literature/pages/7405/Archibald-Stansfeld-Belaney.html "Archibald Stansfeld Belaney Biography – (1888–1938)"], JRank, accessed 4 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Native American Women p. 12"&gt;''Native American Women: A Biographical Dictionary'', ed. Gretchen M. Bataille &amp; Laurie Lisa, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Through her influence, he began to think more deeply about conservation. Anahareo encouraged his writing and influenced him by saving and raising a pair of beaver kits.

After accompanying Grey Owl on a trapline, Anahareo attempted to make him see the torture that animals suffered when they were caught in traps.&lt;ref name="Braz"&gt;{{cite book | last = Braz | first = Albert | chapter = St. Archie of the Wild. Grey Owl's Account of His 'Natural' Conversion | editor-last = Fiamengo | editor-first = Janice | editor-link = Janice Fiamengo | title = Other Selves: Animals in the Canadian Literary Imagination | pages = 206&amp;ndash;226 | publisher = University of Ottawa Press | location = Ottawa | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780776617701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anahareo could not convince Grey Owl until his pivotal moment of conversion from trapper to conservationist occurred involving beavers. According to Grey Owl's ''Pilgrims of the Wild'', he hunted down a beaver home where he knew a mother beaver to be and set a trap for her.&lt;ref name="Owl, Grey 1934. pg. 27-28"&gt;Owl, Grey. ''Pilgrims of the Wild.'' 1934. Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2010, pg. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; When the trap caught the mother beaver, Grey Owl began to canoe away to the cries of kitten beavers which greatly resemble the sound of human infants.&lt;ref&gt;Owl, Grey. ''Pilgrims of the Wild.'' 1934. Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2010, pg. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Anahareo begged Grey Owl to set the mother free, but he could not be swayed from his position because they needed the money from the beaver's pelt.&lt;ref name="Owl, Grey 1934. pg. 27-28"/&gt; The next day, Grey Owl went back for the baby beavers which the couple adopted.&lt;ref name="Owl, Grey 1934. pg. 27-28"/&gt; As Albert Braz stated in his article ''St. Archie of the Wild'', "Indeed, primarily because of this episode, Grey Owl comes to believe that it is 'monstrous' to hunt such creatures and determines to 'study them' rather than 'persecuting them further.{{' "}}&lt;ref name="Braz" /&gt;{{rp|212}}

Belaney's first journal article, "The Falls of Silence", was published under the name A.S. Belaney in ''Country Life'', the English sporting and society magazine. He also published articles on animal lore as "Grey Owl" in ''[[Forest &amp; Outdoors]]'', a publication of the [[Canadian Forestry Association]]. He became increasingly known in Canada and the United States. In 1928, the National Park Service made a film featuring Grey Owl and Anahareo, which showed them with two beavers which they had taken in as kits and raised after their mother was killed. Grey Owl wrote twenty-five articles for ''Canadian Forest and Outdoors'' magazine between 1930 and 1935, published while he was in the midst of writing his first book.&lt;ref&gt;Loo, Tina. ''States of Nature: Conserving Canada's Wildlife in the Twentieth Century.'' Vancouver: UBC Press, 2006, pg. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

His first book as Grey Owl was called ''The Men of the Last Frontier'', published in 1931, and it traced the devastating story of the beaver as well as posed some very valid concerns about the future of Canada and its forests. Beaver pelts had become such a hot commodity in Canadian industry that the beaver was on the verge of extinction when Anahareo helped him understand the desperate need for protecting the animal instead of trapping it.&lt;ref&gt;Owl, Grey. ''The Men of the Last Frontier.'' Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2011, pg. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Grey Owl in ''The Men of the Last Frontier'', trappers swarmed to the forests in higher numbers than ever before in 1930 because of the beaver's scarcity, and he argued that the only way to save this animal was to remove all of the trappers from the forests.&lt;ref&gt;Owl, Grey. ''The Men of the Last Frontier.'' Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2011, pg. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an extremely difficult feat however because their pelts were so valuable and the job economy was so poor in the 1930s that he described their role in the economy as "beavers [being] to the north what gold was to the west".&lt;ref&gt;Owl, Grey. ''The Men of the Last Frontier.'' Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2011, pg. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Though much of his focus in his writings were on the beaver, he also believed that this animal could be used as a symbol for the disappearing future of Canadian wilderness in a broader sense.&lt;ref name="Braz" /&gt;{{rp|206}} He believed that Canada's wilderness and vastly open nature was what made it unique from other countries of the world, and this was disappearing at an extremely fast rate due to consumerism and the modernist emphasis on capital.&lt;ref name="Braz" /&gt;{{rp|207}} He also discussed in ''The Men of the Last Frontier'' how the Canadian government and logging industry were working together to project a false image of forest preservation in order to gain possession of Canada's forests and rid them of their resources, burn down what remained, and attempt to replant "synthetic forests" in their places.&lt;ref&gt;Owl, Grey. ''The Men of the Last Frontier.'' Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2011, pg. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''The Men of the Last Frontier'' was a call of desperation for the people of Canada to awaken from their immobility and resist the destruction of their country as the forests were being turned into deserts for profit.&lt;ref&gt;Owl, Grey. ''The Men of the Last Frontier.'' Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2011, pg. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work with Dominion Parks Branch==
Grey Owl's relationship with [[Parks Canada]], known in the 1930s as Dominion Parks Branch, began when he published stories through the Canadian Forestry Association. His publications in Canadian Forest and Outdoors brought him into contact with Gordon Dallyn, the then editor of Canadian Forest and Outdoors, who introduced him to [[James Harkin]], the Parks Branch Commissioner.&lt;ref name="Donald B. Smith 1990"&gt;Donald B. Smith, ''From the Land of Shadows: the Making of Grey Owl'', (Saskatoon: Western Prairie Books, 1990), 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing similar concerns over wilderness conservation, the Parks Branch agreed to make a film with Grey Owl and Jelly Roll (his pet beaver) with the goal of "provid[ing] a living argument for conservation."&lt;ref name="Donald B. Smith 1990"/&gt; W. J. Oliver, who at the time was under contract with the Parks Branch, was the prominent cameraman of the films commissioned by Parks Branch; along with filming Grey Owl, Oliver also took many pictures of him looking "consciously Indian."&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Smith, ''From the Land of Shadows: the Making of Grey Owl'', (Saskatoon: Western Prairie Books, 1990), 101.&lt;/ref&gt; These photographs would be used as illustrations in both Grey Owl's books such as ''The Men of the Last Frontier'', and as publicity for his lecturing tours. The film received good reception from the Forestry Association. Thinking it would bring increased tourism to the national park which Grey Owl would be working at, along with serving as a platform where Grey Owl could promote his work, James Harkin offered Grey Owl a job at the [[Riding Mountain National Park]] in early 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Smith, ''From the Land of Shadows: the Making of Grey Owl'', (Saskatoon: Western Prairie Books, 1990), 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Grey Owl and Anahareo moved briefly (with their beavers) to a cabin in Riding Mountain National Park to find a sanctuary for them. Riding Mountain National Park was found to be an unsuitable habitat for the beavers, as a summer drought resulted in the lake water level sinking, and becoming stagnant.&lt;ref&gt;Lovat Dickson, "Wilderness Man: The Strange Story of Grey Owl", (Toronto: The Macmillan Company of Canada, 1973), 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the beavers and Grey Owl were unhappy with the situation, causing Grey Owl to search, with the support of the Dominion Parks Branch, for better living conditions.&lt;ref name="Lovat Dickson 1973"&gt;Lovat Dickson, "Wilderness Man: The Strange Story of Grey Owl", (Toronto: The Macmillan Company of Canada, 1973), 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The Parks Branch suggested [[Prince Albert National Park]], situated 450 miles north-west of Riding Mountain National Park.&lt;ref name="Lovat Dickson 1973"/&gt; Grey Owl and Anahareo found the park suitable for their needs as it was isolated, teeming with wildlife, heavily wooded, and Grey Owl had a favourable impression of the Superintendent of the Park, Major J.A. Wood.&lt;ref name="Lovat Dickson 1973"/&gt; The greater sized waterway of Prince Albert National Park was found to be a more suitable beaver habitat, as the lake at Riding Mountain National Park had a risk of freezing to the bottom during winter.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Smith, ''From the Land of Shadows: the Making of Grey Owl'', (Saskatoon: Western Prairie Books, 1990), 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grey Owl told his publisher and future biographer, [[Lovat Dickson]], the following story about his origins:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He was the son of a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] father and [[Apache]] mother. He claimed his father was a man named George MacNeil, who had been a [[Reconnaissance|scout]] during the 1870s [[Indian Wars]] in the southwestern United States. Grey Owl said his mother was Katherine Cochise of the [[Apache]], Jicarilla [[Band society|band]]. He further said that both parents had been part of the [[Wild Bill Hickok]] Western show that toured England. Grey Owl claimed to have been born in 1888 in Hermosillo, Mexico, while his parents were performing there.&lt;ref&gt;Lovat Dickson. ''Wilderness Man: The Strange Story of Grey Owl'', New York: Atheneum, 1973, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In the 1930s Grey Owl wrote many articles for the Canadian Forestry Association (CFA) publication ''Forests and Outdoors'', including the following:

His article, "A Description of the Fall Activities of Beaver, with some remarks on Conservation", was collected in Harper Cory's book ''Grey Owl and the Beaver'' (London: Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd, 1935).

In 1935–36 and 1937–38, Grey Owl toured Canada and [[UK|Britain]] (including Hastings) to promote his books and lecture about conservation. His popularity attracted large, interested audiences, as ''Pilgrims in the Wild'' at one point was selling 5,000 copies a month.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Grey Owl appeared in traditional [[Ojibwa]] clothing as part of his First Nations identity. Although his aunts recognised him at his 1935 appearance in Hastings, they did not talk about his true, British origins until 1937.

Between 1936 and his death he was informally visited at his base by the then Governor-General, [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|Lord Tweedsmuir]], an admirer of Grey Owl's writings on wildlife, an event photographed by [[Shuldham Redfern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Janet Adam|title=John Buchan and His World|year=1979|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|page=105|isbn=0-500-13067-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a publication tour of Canada, Grey Owl met Yvonne Perrier, a [[French Canadian]] woman. In November 1936 they married.

===Alcohol use===
Following his return from service in the [[First World War]], Belaney's use of alcohol increased, and it was not unusual for him to appear drunk in public.&lt;ref name="Dane Lanken 1999"&gt;Dane Lanken, "The Vision of Grey Owl," Canadian Geographic 119 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; On the ship back to Canada from his 1935 British tour, it was noted that he "drank heavily, ate only onions and was noticeably ill."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Unwin, "The Fabulations of Grey Owl," Canada's History 79, no. 2 (April 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive alcohol consumption compromised Grey Owl's position with the Dominion Parks Branch in Ottawa. He was supposed to meet a group of important governmental officials at the studio of [[Yousuf Karsh]], who had organised a dinner in his honour. However, as the dinner began, Grey Owl was absent. Karsh later found him "raising a drunken row in the bar."&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Smith, ''From the Land of Shadows: the Making of Grey Owl'', (Saskatoon: Western Prairie Books, 1990), 156.&lt;/ref&gt; This public display of a Parks Branch employee drunk in public caused James Harkin to have to defend Grey Owl's position within Parks Branch to the Assistant Deputy Minister Roy A. Gibson.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Smith, ''From the Land of Shadows: the Making of Grey Owl'', (Saskatoon: Western Prairie Books, 1990), 157.&lt;/ref&gt; His consumption of alcohol at Prince Albert National Park created more friction between himself and Parks Branch as he was seen to "indulge too freely in liquor."&lt;ref name="Dane Lanken 1999"/&gt;

==Death==
The tours were fatiguing for Grey Owl and his years of [[alcoholism]] weakened him.&lt;ref name="jrank.org"/&gt; In April 1938, he returned to Beaver Lodge, his cabin at Ajawaan Lake. Five days later, he was found unconscious on the floor of the cabin. Although taken to [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] hospital for treatment, he died of [[pneumonia]] on April 13, 1938. He was buried near his cabin.

His first wife Angele proved her marriage and, although she had not seen him for several years, inherited most of his estate.&lt;ref name="jrank.org"/&gt; After their deaths, Anahareo and Shirley Dawn (died June 3, 1984) in turn were buried at Ajawaan Lake.

==Marriages and families==
Belaney had relationships with at least five women.&lt;ref name="Grey Owl"&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=M1ARTM0012020  "Grey Owl"], ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'', accessed 4 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He deserted his first wife and child, later committing [[bigamy]] by marrying Constance Holmes in England.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} He had a daughter with his first wife and another with his third; and was known to have fathered a boy as well.

Women in Belaney's life:
*[[Angele Egwuna]] (Anishinaabe), married August 1910. Daughter Agnes Belaney.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
*A [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] woman, whose name appears to be unknown, with whom Belaney had a son. She died of [[tuberculosis]] soon after the boy was born and he was raised by her family.&lt;ref name="Grey Owl"/&gt;
*Constance (Ivy) Holmes, married in England in 1917. No children.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
*Gertrude Bernard (aka ''[[Anahareo]]'') (Mohawk), eight-year affair beginning when she was only 19, started in 1925.&lt;ref name="Native American Women p. 12"/&gt; Daughter Shirley Dawn, b. 1932. Separated 1936. She denied having known he was an imposter.&lt;ref name=Bernard&gt;Anahareo (Mar 28, 2014) ''Devil in Deerskins: My Life with Grey Owl''. Univ. of Manitoba Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Yvonne Perrier (French Canadian), "married" November 1936. No children.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== Exposure ==
Doubts about Grey Owl's supposed First Nation identity had been circulating and stories were published immediately after his death. The ''[[North Bay Nugget]]'' newspaper ran the first exposé the day of his death, a story which they had been holding for three years.&lt;ref name="Grey Owl"/&gt; This was followed up by international news organisations, such as ''[[The Times]]''. His publisher Lovat Dickson tried to prove Belaney's claimed identity, but had to admit that his friend had lied to him. His popularity and support for his causes led ''The Ottawa Citizen'' to conclude, "Of course, the value of his work is not jeopardized. His attainments as a writer and naturalist will survive."  This opinion was widely shared in the UK national press.&lt;ref name="Grey Owl"/&gt;

While his writings showed his deep knowledge and concern about the environment, Belaney's account of his origins as "Grey Owl" was fictional. The consequences of the revelation were dramatic. Publishers immediately ceased producing his books under the name "Grey Owl". In some cases his books were withdrawn from publication. This in turn affected the conservation causes with which Belaney had been associated, resulting in a decrease in donations.

==Conservationist views==
Initially, Grey Owl's efforts and conservation were focused towards the [[beaver]] up North; however, with the publication of The Men of the Last Frontier, his conservation efforts came to include all wild animals.&lt;ref name="Dickson 1973 219"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickson|first=Lovat|title=Wilderness Man: The Strange Story of Grey Owl|year=1973|publisher=The Macmillan Company of Canada|location=Toronto|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he had at one time been a [[fur trapper]], he came to believe that "the trap, the rifle, and poison" would some day result in "the Dwellers in the forest to come to an end too."&lt;ref name="Dickson 1973 219"/&gt; He expressed in ''Pilgrims of the Wild'' how our rush to exploit natural resources for commercial value overlooks "the capabilities and possibilities of the wild creatures involved in it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gnarowski|first=Michael|title=Pilgrims of the Wild|year=2010|publisher=Dundurn|location=Toronto, Canada|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this "commodification of all living things that was responsible for the destruction from the beaver."&lt;ref name="Loo 2006 113"&gt;{{cite book|last=Loo|first=Tina|title=States of Nature: Conserving Canada's Wildlife in the Twentieth Century|year=2006|publisher=UBC Press|location=Vancouver, British Columbia|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grey Owl expressed that if there were "temporary at least" protection for fur bearing animals, then we would "see the almost human response to kindness" from animals.&lt;ref name="Dickson 1973 219"/&gt; He called for people to remember "that you belong to nature, and not it to you."&lt;ref name="Loo 2006 113"/&gt; ''Men of the Last Frontier'' was first called ''The Vanishing Frontier'', and subsequently named ''Men of the Last Frontier'' by the publishers, which he felt "missed the entire point of the book" as he "spoke of nature, not men."&lt;ref name="Dickson 1973 218"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickson|first=Lovat|title=Wilderness Man: The Strange Story of Grey Owl|year=1973|publisher=The Macmillan Company of Canada|location=Toronto|pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changing of the title exemplified for him the conception of people "that man governs the powers of nature."&lt;ref name="Dickson 1973 218"/&gt;

==Posthumous recognition==
In 1972 the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) produced a documentary special on Grey Owl, directed by Nancy Ryley. In [[1999 in film|1999]], the film ''[[Grey Owl (film)|Grey Owl]]'' was released. It was directed by [[Richard Attenborough]] and starred [[Pierce Brosnan]]. The film received mixed reviews and received no theatrical release in the United States. In June 1997, the mayor of Hastings and the borough's [[Member of Parliament]] ([[Michael Jabez Foster|Michael Foster]]) unveiled a plaque in his honor on the house at 32 St. James Road, Hastings, East Sussex, where he was born.&lt;ref name="Grey Owl's Hastings"&gt;[http://www.1066.net/greyowl/today.htm Grey Owl's Hastings], 1066.net, accessed 19 Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=PE9dDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=grey+owl+36+St.+Mary%27s+Terrace&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gYLmXSRJT9&amp;sig=Yj648aD7jgNoB7moANvPODFLlWs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwia2Nu58andAhWCm4MKHXNzDFkQ6AEwB3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=grey%20owl%2036%20St.%20Mary's%20Terrace&amp;f=false The Canadian Guide to Britain, vol 1: England page 129]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ranger station at [[Hastings Country Park]], 4 miles to the east of Hastings, also has a [[commemorative plaque]] to Grey Owl. A full-size replica of his Canadian lakeside cabin is in [[Hastings Museum and Art Gallery|Hastings Museum]] at Summerfields. An exhibition of memorabilia and a commemorative plaque are at the house at 36 St. Mary's Terrace where he lived with his grandmother and aunts.&lt;ref name="Grey Owl's Hastings"/&gt;

The cabin he had built in the 1930s still stands in Prince Albert National Park and can be reached by foot (20 kilometer hike) or by canoe (a 16 km paddle).&lt;ref&gt; https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/sk/princealbert/activ/activ18&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Heart of Europe International Debating Tournament (HOE DT)''' is an annual [[debating]] [[tournament]] for [[secondary education|high school]]-level teams which is held in English.

==History==

The Heart of Europe Debating Tournament is a WSDC ([[World Schools Debating Championships]]) based international debate tournament founded by John L. Wickham and the students of Olomouc - Hejcin High School. Originally a competition for high school students of European countries that had previously participated in the KPDP (Karl Popper Debate Program) established by OSI ([[Open Society Institute]]), after some time it became a truly global competition for high school debaters. The first Heart of Europe Debating Tournament was held in Olomouc, Czech Republic in 2001. The event attracted participants from Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. In 2002, the tournament didn't take place because the organizers were not able to obtain the necessary funding. Nonetheless, a year later, in 2003, the second year of the tournament was held. It has been hosted in Olomouc, Czech Republic every time since then, being organised by Debate Club Olomouc throughout the years 2004–2009. Heart of Europe has lately become an annual event and has been organised by the Association of Debate Clubs of Olomouc Region since 2010.

The year 2010 was a real step-up for the tournament, having had 17 countries participate, including such exotic ones as [[South Africa]] and [[China]] that engaged in the Grand Final of this year.

In year 2011 there was really significant step in improvement of quality of the tournament. Organising Committee established cooperation withPalacky University Olomouc. All the dabetes took place in magnificent building of Faculty of Science. The tournament also received new visual style in this year and a lot of work on promotion was done, such as new social networks, photo and video documentation. New participating countries were Moldova, Montenegro, Russia, Singapore and Sweden.

Year 2012 was the greatest cornerstone in the history of the tournament. It was held by a new organization, Czech Debate Society, o. s.. For the first time, the tournament was also available online to participants all around the world because of the project "Heart of Europe accessible to everyone". What more, one additional new project was connected with the promotion of the tournament, The Czech Debate TV, with purpose to monitor debate and educational events and present educational videos. The tournament enjoyed fruitful partnerships with projects Debating Europe and The Office of the Government of the Czech Republic - European Affairs Information Department. In that year we have yet again welcomed several new nations, namely Chile, Nigeria, Macedonia, as well as it was the 5th anniversary of Jakub Kadlec' involvement with the tournament.

2013 was the 10th anniversary of Heart of Europe and the tournament got its mascot Herr Heart. The biggest innovation of Heart of Europe 2013 was a test run of the British Parliamentary track before the high school competition, which proved to be a success and will be repeated in the future. As for the staff, the Chief Adjudicator panel was changed – extended to include judges from all over the planet in order to increase its diversity. There were also new participating countries (such as Croatia or Ukraine) and new partnerships made, mainly the one with Debate Club Pandora in Kiev, which later resulted in CDS helping with organization at their tournament called Under Chestnut Trees. Other new partners and sponsors included ARGO, ČEZ or Deleo. In terms of cultural program, Heart of Europe newly included a talent show, where everyone was invited to showcase any skill other than debating. Several debaters and judges performed singing, playing an instrument, dancing as well as some acting and stand up comedy. The next addition was a thematic tour of the city, which was special that year because of historical costumes and props used to demonstrate the legends of Olomouc. Additionally, registration to the tournament was tied to a blood donorship initiative.

Year 2014 was most notable by the outstanding quality of the teams, even by the already quite high standard of the tournament - perhaps a result of multiple delegations spending several years prior to 2014 honing their skills at our tournament every year. The teams were also extraordinarily balanced. In the first break round, the last team to make the break from the 16th place defeated the first team, two members of which were still the best two speakers of the whole tournament. The team with the best two speakers was from South Africa, just like the team that ultimately won the whole tournament, only from an entirely different institution, thus also continuing the regular cycle of different continent winning each year. This was also the first year after the definitive retirement of the founder of the tournament, John L. Wickham, from the position of Chief Judge, making it a bit of an experiment in new organizational procedures. The new paradigm for the future of the tournament was decided to be a rotating position of a chief judge, open to new ascending debate stars, as well as experienced debate masters. New participating countries were Bermuda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bermuda took on all comers at the Heart of Europe youth debates|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20140726/NEWS/140729780&amp;source=RSS|website=www.royalgazette.com|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; China and Denmark. Czech Debate Society, o. s. has changed name to Czech Debate Society, z. s. in accordance with new civil code.

Heart of Europe 2016 had again grown in size in 2016 to 40 teams, including some new additions to participating states like Argentina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, India, Peru, Qatar, and Spain. One of the ongoing trends that became especially apparent this time was the increase in the skill and experience level of the participating debaters. In part, this was happening because larger portion of the debaters were returning ones who have previously participated at Heart of Europe. At the same time, more high level international debaters were attracted to the tournament by its rising significance in the world debating circuit over the last couple of years. The motions debated in qualification rounds covered a range of topics from education, through women’s rights, to global economics. The grand final debate dealt with the issue of residual European colonialism, and it happened between the teams from Canada and Denmark, with the Canadians taking the prize.


Heart of Europe International DT has become very popular during past years. There have been participants from countries such as Argentina, Belarus, Bermuda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, England, Estonia, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Israel, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, Palestine, Peru, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Scotland, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United States of America.

All debates in the tournament are in English. This is for practical reasons, but it means that many countries debate in what is for them a foreign language. This has not stopped a number of these teams being very successful. Special awards have been introduced for the highest-ranked teams made-up of English-as-a-second-language (ESL) and English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) speakers.

==Symbols==

From December 2012, Heart of Europe Debating Tournament has an official mascot – Herr Heart! Then Chief Adjudicator of the tournament, John Wickham, commented on it:

“''Introducing this mascot and promoting blood giving all around the world is another significant milestone for the Czech Debate Society and the tournament itself. It is in line with the tournament’s mission to develop cooperation among the youth and to foster cultural and social understanding and exchange. Herr Heart represents the sharpness, love for freedom and effort to help and to improve the neighbourhood, which is essential for debaters, as well as the hospitality and openness of organisers and the tournament itself.''”

John Wickham also explained the concept behind the logo for the HOEDT, saying that the heart in the middle of the Europe silhouette represents the central position of the place, from where the HOEDT helps spread freedom of speech, the centre of Europe which really is a crossroad of cultures. The logo also indicates the communication that will bring the students from various cultures closer to each other.

The colors chosen for the logo represent national colors of the country, as well as vitality and democracy. Herr Heart also brings a new motto, not just for our blood donor initiative, but for the tournament as a whole – Debate Is Life. Just like the blood is necessary to oxygenate the body, debating nurtures the mind, while it is literally saving lives even further through promoting peace and helping people of all ages and cultures live to the fullest. We at the HOEDT certainly live for the debate and that is why the debate lives here too.

==Format==

Heart of Europe Debating Tournament debates use a special format known as '[[World Schools Style Debating]]'. This is a combination of the [[debate#Parliamentary debate|British Parliamentary]] and [[Australia-Asia debate|Australia-Asian]] [[debate|debating]], designed to meet the needs of the tournament. Each debate comprises eight- minute speeches delivered by two three-member teams (the Proposition and the Opposition). Each speaker delivers an eight-minute speech; then both teams deliver a "reply speech" lasting four minutes, with the last word being reserved for the Proposition. Between the end of the first and the beginning of the last minute of an eight-minute speech, the opposing party may offer "points of information". The speaker may refuse these, but should take at least one or two points during his or her speech.

Originally the plan was to use KPDP style of debate at Heart of Europe Debating Tournament. However, '[[World Schools Style Debating]]' was used in many more countries for their national competitions, including Australia, Argentina, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Israel, New Zealand, South Africa, Slovenia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka and Wales, so the Organizing Committee has decided to use it.

The HOE DT normally takes place over the course of seven days. Each national team competes in eight preliminary debates: four '''prepared debates''' and four '''impromptu debates''' (for which teams have one hour to prepare). Once the eight preliminary rounds have been completed, the 16 best teams compete in knock-out debates (known as the Octofinals) culminating in a Grand Final. For each debate, three [[judge]]s (or more in later rounds) mark each debater on his or her style, content and strategy.

==British Parliamentary Track==
The British Parliamentary Track of the Heart of Europe international debating tournament was first introduced in 2013, the 10th anniversary of the event. It took place between 29 July and 1 August 2013 and it was an international debating competition for university students in the most common format for this type of contest – the British Parliamentary debating, involving 4 teams of two university students in a single debate, representing two governments (affirming the motion) and two oppositions (negating the motion). The Chief Judge was Martin Rezny from the Czech Republic and the winning team was from Sweden.

In 2014, BP track was led by one of the winners of last year's BP track, Alexander Mäkela from Sweden, who introduced a special kind of motion for the last preliminary round – a hypothetical fictional scenario. Given the positive reception of the motion (in this case dealing with alien invasion), the experiment will likely turn into a tradition in the future years. There were 12 teams participating and the winning team was once again from Sweden.

The BP Track in 2015 has almost doubled in size since previous year including two new nations (Thailand and Great Britain), and the Chief Judge was once again Martin Rezny from the Czech Republic. The fictional scenario motion was about zombie apocalypse this time around, and even the real world motions shifted towards more unusual topics, such as astrology or robotics. The positive reception of this focus will therefore likely also become a trend at this event. The winning team was from Great Britain, the best speaker being Duncan Crowe, who just weeks after this event became a finalist of the EUDC 2015 in Vienna as well.

==Chief Adjudication Team==
The Chief Adjudication Team (CAT) of HOEDT is selected by the Chief Judge with the help of the Chief Organizer. The number of members may vary, though an odd number is more practical in terms of the CAT assembling a functional judging panel. While the principles behind the selection of the CAT members may vary as well, the CAT should consist of experienced judges of international tournaments in appropriate debate formats. In 2013, a new convention was established by extending the CAT to 5 members, each ideally representing a different region of the world.

==The Goals==
The Goals of Heart of Europe Debating Tournament are:&lt;ref name="birtem"&gt;http://www.heart-of-europe.org/web/about/ About Heart of Europe Debating Tournament  – Heart-of-europe.org&lt;/ref&gt;
*to promote free speech;
*to nurture the skills of public speech and rhetorics;
*to develop cooperation among the youth;
*to advocate debate;
*to foster cultural and social understanding and exchange;
*to promote the Czech Republic and Olomouc Region;
*to contribute to education.

In order to further these aims, all participating countries agree that: 
*The team of any participating country may be required to debate any issue.
*The team of any participating country may be required to debate against the team of any other participating country.
*The team of any participating country is entitled to take part in the tournament on the same basis as any other participating country's team.

==EFL awards==

At Heart of Europe Debating Tournament special awards are presented each year to the best-performing English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) teams. These awards are open to teams from nations where English is not an official national language. To be eligible for the EFL award, a team must be predominantly made-up of students who do not come from English-speaking homes and who do not attend schools where English is used as a medium of instruction. 
The EFL award was instituted in 2010. Prior to that, there was just one award for teams from non-English-speaking countries. Before 2010, the HOE DT rules stipulated that teams who reached the semi-finals or Grand Final of the championship were not eligible to receive the ESL award. When the EFL award was introduced, the rules were changed to allow teams who reach the semi-finals (but not the Grand Final) to be able to receive the ESL or EFL award.

The term ‘hybrid institution’ is not yet well-established or clearly defined in academic literature. This article therefore begins by offering a definition of the term and a brief discussion of its origins. The article thereafter is structured as a series of examples which demonstrate some of the key characteristics, strengths and weaknesses of hybrid institutions. These examples are mostly limited to environmental issues, and have been selected for their value in introducing the concept of hybrid institutions, in that they encapsulate key themes. There remains a multitude of other examples, and contributions from both environmental and other fields are welcomed and encouraged.

==Definition and Origins==

===Definition===
The term ‘institution’ eludes precise definition, and its interpretation in academic literature varies. The dictionary definition: ‘an established law, custom, or practice’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J.P.|title=Environmental Governance|year=2012|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an oft-used and useful starting point. Theoretical discussions have highlighted a distinction between formal (laws, official rules, contracts, standards, procedures) and informal (shared values, behavioural norms, belief systems, codes of conduct, discourses) institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=March &amp; Olsen|first=G., P.,|title=The New Institutionalism: Organizational Factors in Political Life|journal=American Political Science Review|year=1984|volume=78|series=September|pages=734–49|doi=10.2307/1961840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=G|title=Policy community realism versus "new" institutionalist ambiguity|journal=Political Study|year=1990|volume=38|pages=470–484|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1990.tb01082.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powell &amp; Di Maggio (Eds)|first=W., P.,|title=The new institutionalism in organizational analysis|year=1991|publisher=Chicago University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction has emerged from what has been termed the ‘new institutionalism’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=March &amp; Olsen|first=G., P.,|title=The New Institutionalism: Organizational Factors in Political Life|journal=American Political Science Review|year=1984|volume=78|series=September|pages=734–49|doi=10.2307/1961840}}&lt;/ref&gt; which adopts a more critical approach to the study of institutions. Institutions are seen as key actors in guiding the political process, and are shaped by historical struggles, rules and procedures; rather than being merely the aggregation of individual motives. The apparent [[paradox]] at play here,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowndes|first=V|title=Varieties of New Institutionalism: A Critical Appraisal|journal=Public Administration|year=1996|volume=74|issue=2|pages=184–197|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9299.1996.tb00865.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; that institutions both shape political processes and are themselves the product of political processes, is explored further in the examples below.

The ‘new institutionalism’ is of value in defining what constitutes a ‘hybrid institution’, as it demonstrates “a concern with new arrangements for policy-making rather than a new look at old institutions”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan, A. and O’Riordan, T|title=Institutions for global environmental change|journal=Global Environmental Change|year=2003|volume=13|pages=223–28|doi=10.1016/s0959-3780(03)00005-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowdnes’ concept of the ‘disaggregated institution’ theorises the institutionalisation of relations between governmental and non-governmental actors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowndes|first=V|title=Varieties of New Institutionalism: A Critical Appraisal|journal=Public Administration|year=1996|volume=74|issue=2|pages=184–197|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9299.1996.tb00865.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing a useful starting point for conceptualising hybrid institutions. A hybrid institution is as an institution which exists between or across the boundaries of sectors, government departments, geographic units, or combines the governance regimes of “traditional dichotomies” such as the state and the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bobblio, cited in Gulbrandsen|first=J|title=Research institutes as hybrid organizations: central challenges to their legitimacy|journal=Political Science|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They represent a new institutional pluralism, blurring the boundaries between previously distinct policy entities by creating new formal and informal institutions. A definition which includes both formal and informal institutions may be considered problematic in that almost any dialogue or cooperation could be considered an informal hybrid institution. North’s distinction between ‘loosely’ and ‘thickly’ institutionalised policy environments is of use here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=North|first=D|title=Institutions, institutional change and economic performance|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where cooperation is limited, and not enshrined within official documents or a specific policy or contract (loose, informal institutionalisation), the hybrid can be said to be weak. Within ‘thickly’ institutionalised environments, with contracts, rules, joint appointments etc. the hybrid is strong. This distinction is examined further in examples below. Depending on the specific context, a strong or weak hybridisation may determine the legitimacy of the institution.

Institutional theorists stress the need to distinguish between institutions and organisations. Organisations are defined as “purposive entities”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=North|first=D|title=Institutions, institutional change and economic performance|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are “tangible ‘things’”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=North|first=D|title=Institutions, institutional change and economic performance|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which have remits, offices and staff”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan &amp; O'Riordan|first=A &amp; T|title=SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND CLIMATE CHANGE: APPLYING CULTURAL THEORY TO PRACTICE|journal=CSERGE Working Paper GEC 97- 1|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions on the other hand provide the rules, norms and settings within which organisations emerged. With hybrid institutions, such a distinction may be more difficult to draw, or perhaps not so necessary. If two existing organisations collaborate to form a joint department, bureau or agency, this new ‘tangible’ entity may meet the criteria of an organisation, but given its novelty and the specific conditions of its formation (being the result of an explicitly collaborative or ‘hybrid’ approach), it may be considered a hybrid institution. Treating ‘organisation’ and ‘institution’ synonymously is perhaps less problematic within the context of hybrid institutions.

While institutionalism relaxes the distinction between organizations and institutions, it is customary to see hybridity in terms of organisations. In practice, many hybrid arrangements exist on meso level as industries or organizational fields such as cleantech industry or innovations systems, as well as on system level (e.g. health policy). Further, in relational terms hybrids can be analysed in terms of single entities, dyads (group of two) or as triads (group of three). For instance global air travel consists of public, private and hybrid airline operators (single entity). The global airtravel is organized according to bilateral agreements (dyad) among public authorities, and global alliances consist of hybrid contracting among the partners in the alliances (triad)&lt;ref&gt;&gt;{{cite book|last=Johanson &amp; Vakkuri|first= JE. &amp; J.|title=Governing hybrid organisations|year=2017|publisher=Routledge|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
Hybrid institutions, although rarely discussed explicitly in the literature, have existed since the 1980s. The [[quangos]] established under the Thatcher Government, for instance, represent state-market institutional hybrids. Quangos also serve to demonstrate the [[neoliberal]] context within which the changes in institutional configurations are taking place (the ‘rolling back’ of the state and a more prominent role for the market). Moreover, the [[IPCC]] and its predecessor the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases (considered below), hybrids operating between science and politics, were first established over two decades ago.

The term itself was coined by administrative economist Oliver Williamson. His original use of the term to analyse modes of governance in the private sector conflates nicely with ideas of hybrid governance more generally. Williamson explored hierarchal governance within the firm, and (self)governance of single transaction markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williamson|first=O|title=Comparative Economic Organization: The Analysis of Discrete Structural Alternatives|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|year=1991|volume=36|pages=269|doi=10.2307/2393356}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williamson’s examination of the efficacy of hybrid modes of governance which combine the responsiveness, efficiency and low transaction costs of markets with the administrative and cooperative capacity within the firm resembles state-market hybrids to some extent.

==Type II Partnerships - An example of Public-Private Hybrid Institutions?==
[[Type II Partnerships]] were developed at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002. These partnerships exemplify a more general shift in governance practice that has been termed ‘The Partnership Movement’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andanova &amp; Levy|first=L., &amp; A.,|title=Franchising Global Governance: Making Sense of the Johannesburg Type II Partnerships|journal=Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development|year=2003/04|series=Key Issues and Themes|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby “transnational governance networks [...] bring together public, private and societal actors in an effort to institutionalise a set of ideas, practices, and norms”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andanova &amp; Levy|first=L., &amp; A.,|title=Franchising Global Governance: Making Sense of the Johannesburg Type II Partnerships|journal=Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development|year=2003/04|series=Key Issues and Themes|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; (emphasis added). There are clear links with [[network governance]] here, which studies the relationships between different (usually non-state) actors that work together on a particular issue or policy. The Type II Partnerships can be seen as an attempt to promote hybrid institutions between public and private actors. Whether or not these policy networks and partnerships were institutionalised, or were genuine hybrids, is debated within the literature. This debate provides a useful indirect critique of hybrid institutions.

===Genuine Hybridity?===
Although Type II Partnerships were conceived as public-private hybrids, the private sector is involved in just 20% of partnerships, and takes the lead in only 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bäckstrand|first=K|title=Civic Science for Sustainability: Reframing the Role of Experts, Policy-Makers and Citizens in Environmental Governance|journal=Global Environmental Politics|date=November 2003|volume=4|issue=3|doi=10.1162/152638003322757916|pages=24–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most partnerships are led by government agencies, NGOs, or existing international organisations, and the vast majority of funding comes from governments. Moreover, only 6% of partnerships involve actors from all the major categories set out: rich countries, poor countries, international organisations, NGOs, and industry. Thus, Type IIs should perhaps be considered state-non-state, rather than public-private hybrid institutions, if they can be considered hybrid institutions at all.

===Can Hybrid Institutions Produce Significant Changes?===
Because they develop out of existing institutional arrangements, hybrid institutions may be seen as reinforcing existing power structures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bäckstrand|first=K|title=Civic Science for Sustainability: Reframing the Role of Experts, Policy-Makers and Citizens in Environmental Governance|journal=Global Environmental Politics|date=November 2003|volume=4|issue=3|doi=10.1162/152638003322757916|pages=24–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving as a “reinvention of existing institutions”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andanova &amp; Levy|first=L., &amp; A.,|title=Franchising Global Governance: Making Sense of the Johannesburg Type II Partnerships|journal=Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development|year=2003/04|series=Key Issues and Themes|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which do not help address key institutional deficits in areas with the greatest need. This is another prominent criticism in literature on partnerships. Existing organisations seek legitimacy through successful initiatives and thus target areas which already enjoy a reasonable level of institutional capacity to boost their chances of success, meaning that weaker states and marginalised areas where the need for governance solutions is greatest are left out of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andanova &amp; Levy|first=L., &amp; A.,|title=Franchising Global Governance: Making Sense of the Johannesburg Type II Partnerships|journal=Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development|year=2003/04|series=Key Issues and Themes|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is rather perverse for an initiative geared toward [[sustainable development]].

===The Need for Strong Hybrid Institutions===
Although the partnerships have been criticised, a common criticism both of the Type IIs and multilateral policy more generally is the “minimal degree of institutionalisation”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bäckstrand|first=K|title=Civic Science for Sustainability: Reframing the Role of Experts, Policy-Makers and Citizens in Environmental Governance|journal=Global Environmental Politics|date=November 2003|volume=4|issue=3|pages487=|doi=10.1162/152638003322757916|pages=24–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; seen. This serves to promote strong hybrid institutions as a potential solution to the low “implementation record of [...] multilateral partnerships”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bäckstrand|first=K|title=Civic Science for Sustainability: Reframing the Role of Experts, Policy-Makers and Citizens in Environmental Governance|journal=Global Environmental Politics|date=November 2003|volume=4|issue=3|pages478=|doi=10.1162/152638003322757916|pages=24–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more successful partnerships, The Andean Biotrade Programme, demonstrates both genuine hybridity and strongly institutionalised outcomes. The governments of 5 Andean countries, rich donor states, local and international organisations, research institutions and local communities all came together to form a Regional Biodiversity Strategy. The Strategy contains agreements on biotrade, technological development for conservation and eco-finance, a “set of intersected [issues] that have been deadlocked at the governmental level by competing interests and power inequalities”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andanova &amp; Levy|first=L., &amp; A.,|title=Franchising Global Governance: Making Sense of the Johannesburg Type II Partnerships|journal=Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development|year=2003/04|series=Key Issues and Themes|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of the Type II Partnerships, strong hybrid institutionalisation is indicative of, indeed a “precondition”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bäckstrand|first=K|title=Civic Science for Sustainability: Reframing the Role of Experts, Policy-Makers and Citizens in Environmental Governance|journal=Global Environmental Politics|date=November 2003|volume=4|issue=3|pages490=|doi=10.1162/152638003322757916|pages=24–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; for success. By the same token, weak, informal institutionalism which demonstrates only “cosmetic or symbolic”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andanova &amp; Levy|first=L., &amp; A.,|title=Franchising Global Governance: Making Sense of the Johannesburg Type II Partnerships|journal=Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development|year=2003/04|series=Key Issues and Themes}}&lt;/ref&gt; arrangements does not bear positive results.

===Accountability===
Strong institutionalisation of partnerships in the form of monitoring procedures or implementation reviews, as well as helping ensure positive outcomes (legitimacy), also helps address a key requirement for institutions, accountability. New hybrid forms of governance make achieving accountability more difficult. Traditionally, (democratic) states are accountable to their voters, and private organisations to their members and shareholders. However, when numerous organisations act together, the picture is more complex. States are still ultimately acting on behalf of their citizens, but when acting in tandem with other sectors, or at the global level, the traditional “lines of accountability”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biermann &amp; Pattberg|first=F., &amp; P.,|title=Global Environmental Governance: Taking Stock, Moving Forward|journal=[[Annual Review of Environment and Resources]]|date=November 2008|volume=33|doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.33.050707.085733|pages=277–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; lengthen. Moreover, there is often ‘external’ accountability as well as internal, in that actors are accountable to the people in areas they affect as well as their own constituents and members. By having clear and transparent strategies, policy documents, and reporting procedures, hybrid institutions can ensure their legitimacy and accountability.

==Bridging Science and Politics – The IPCC==
The IPCC is both a scientific and a political institution. It consists of over 2000 scientists representing 154 countries, and was “conceived as an explicitly hybrid institution capable of producing a political consensus around scientific knowledge concerning the global climate”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J.P.|title=Environmental Governance|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|pages72=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (emphasis added). The success of the IPCC in establishing political consensus over a very complex issue, and the failings of its predecessor, the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases, again serve as a useful indication of the principles for success in hybrid institutions.

The IPCC, in its present form, is in many ways an exemplar hybrid institution. The institutional set-up is designed to achieve consensus and buy-in on a very complex issue. Each chapter must have a lead author from both the global north and south, to help ensure the report reflects the perspectives of both developed and developing countries. The final report must be unanimously agreed upon by both scientists and government representatives, resulting in a document which is “policy relevant but not policy prescriptive”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J.P.|title=Environmental Governance|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|pages72=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the partnerships discussed previously, the importance of achieving both a balance of input from different sectors, and rules which shape outcomes is evident; demonstrating need for strong, genuinely hybrid institutions.

Equally, some of the failings of the IPCC in its early forms, and its predecessor, demonstrate the failings of imbalanced hybrids. The quota rule which requires both north and south inputs for each chapter was introduced in response to criticism that the reports were western-centric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biermann &amp; Pattberg|first=F., &amp; P.,|title=Global Environmental Governance: Taking Stock, Moving Forward|journal=[[Annual Review of Environment and Resources]]|date=November 2008|volume=33|doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.33.050707.085733|pages=277–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases failed because it was too far removed from policy-making process. Without sufficient dialogue with policy-makers, the Advisory Group was viewed with suspicion for its lack of transparency and openness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J.P.|title=Environmental Governance|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|pages73=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance the Group failed to balance between scientific and political process and thus failed as a hybrid.

Some critics have argued that the IPCC produces ‘watered-down’ recommendations, because of the extent of political consultation. However, as illustrated, the political dialogue is necessary and has seen remarkable success in establishing consensus. A further criticism of the IPCC is that its formation was shaped by a northern political agenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wynne, B. In: Redclift, M. and Benton, T., (eds)|title=Scientific Knowledge and the Global Environment in  Social Theory and the Global Environment.|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages171=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by framing climate change in terms of ‘tolerable levels’, the moral and political issues over differential historical uses of the world’s resources were avoided. This argument reflects a wider critique of institutions as being the product of traditional power structures that perpetuate existing inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wynne, B. In: Redclift, M. and Benton, T., (eds)|title=Scientific Knowledge and the Global Environment in  Social Theory and the Global Environment.|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages171=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solutions that rest on hybrid institutions would be rejected by scholars such as Jordan &amp; O’Riordan who argue for a “universal shift”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan &amp; O'Riordan|first=A &amp; T|title=SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND CLIMATE CHANGE: APPLYING CULTURAL THEORY TO PRACTICE|journal=CSERGE Working Paper GEC 97- 1|year=1997|pages2=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the institutional arrangements for tackling climate change, as they serve to promote western interests at the expense of the developing world at present.

==The Designing of Dolly - A Clone and a Hybrid?==
Dolly the sheep was born on 7 February 1997 as the first animal cloned from adult cells. The institutional arrangements behind this scientific feat demonstrate the increasing “embeddedness”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frasman|first=M|title=Designing Dolly: interactions between economics, technology and science and the evolution of hybrid institutions|journal=Research Policy|date=February 2001|volume=30|issue=2|pages=263–273|doi=10.1016/s0048-7333(99)00103-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; of political, scientific, and economic processes at work in the production of knowledge. Dolly was a product of three intimately linked institutions: The Roslin Research Institute (government funded), PPL Therapeutics (private firm), and Edinburgh University. Formally, these are all separate entities, but in reality they are intertwined and should be considered hybrid institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frasman|first=M|title=Designing Dolly: interactions between economics, technology and science and the evolution of hybrid institutions|journal=Research Policy|date=February 2001|volume=30|issue=2|doi=10.1016/s0048-7333(99)00103-1|pages=263–273}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPL, whose involvement in funding the Dolly project was driven by potential commercial applications, was originally a ‘spin-off’ from the Roslin Institute. The Roslin institute was initially formed to take advantage of the strong biomedical department at Edinburgh University, and over 50 PhD students from the University were involved in the Dolly project. Such hybrid arrangements are increasingly important, “the hybridity that these institutes represent”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gulbrandsen|first=J|title=Research institutes as hybrid organizations: central challenges to their legitimacy|journal=Political Science|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; subverts views of a linear relationship between science and policy and demonstrates the required “intellectual pluralism and flexibility”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gulbrandsen|first=J|title=Research institutes as hybrid organizations: central challenges to their legitimacy|journal=Political Science|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in public science systems . Again, the neoliberal context is evident here, with state-funded entities having to engage with the private sector and demonstrate economic worthiness to maintain legitimacy.

===Between Stockholm and Lima===
In previous examples, successful institutions are defined by strong hybridity. However, hybridity which is too strong can challenge the legitimacy of academic-scientific-private hybrids. Gulbrandsen highlights the dilemma faced by Research Institutions in their engagement with the private sector and universities. [[Stockholm syndrome]], whereby hostages develop loyalty to their captors, is used to describe a scenario where the need for private funding jeopardises the neutrality of the research process in favour of a particular clients’ perspective. [[Lima syndrome]], whereby the captors develop an attachment to their hostages, applies where research bodies lose sight of their role in contributing to society and becoming preoccupied with esoteric academic debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gulbrandsen|first=J|title=Research institutes as hybrid organizations: central challenges to their legitimacy|journal=Political Science|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example shows that an implied relationship between success and strong hybridity does not apply in all contexts. Indeed, weak and informally institutionalised hybrids may be necessary to retain legitimacy in some cases.

==Hybrid Institutions and Resource Governance==
One of the few uses of the term hybrid institutions in academic literature which relates explicitly to governance is German &amp; Keeler’s discussion of hybridising governance of property regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=German &amp; Keeler|first=L., &amp; A.,|title="Hybrid institutions": Applications of common property theory beyond discrete tenure regimes|journal=International Journal of the Commons|year=2009|volume=4|doi=10.18352/ijc.108|pages=571}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ostrom]]’s theory of common pool resource management highlights the value of community-created institutions in the governing of a common resource&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ostrom|first=E.,|title=Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-40599-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (communication, rule-making, sanctions, conflict resolution etc.). German &amp; Keeler’s proposal is to extrapolate these successful principles and apply them across “diverse property regimes”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=German &amp; Keeler|first=L., &amp; A.,|title="Hybrid institutions": Applications of common property theory beyond discrete tenure regimes|journal=International Journal of the Commons|year=2009|volume=4|doi=10.18352/ijc.108|pages=571}}&lt;/ref&gt; for state-owned, private and communal resources, creating hybrid institutions that combine usually distinct governance regimes. The proposal is that the
combining technical and enforcement capacity of the state, the legal certainty of ownership, and the successful principles of self-organisation may help govern responses where property regimes are contentious or overlap, or where issues exist that do not respect discrete regimes of resource tenure (for example pests, weeds, or watercourse pollution).
This proposal argues for hybridity not between two sectors or organisations, but between previously distinct institutional configurations associated with separate modes of governance:

''"[T]he functioning of [these] hybrid institutions depends upon the creative combination of autonomous (market), self-organising (contractual) and state regulatory (hierarchical) '''approaches to governance'''”''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=German &amp; Keeler|first=L., &amp; A.,|title="Hybrid institutions": Applications of common property theory beyond discrete tenure regimes|journal=International Journal of the Commons|year=2009|volume=4|doi=10.18352/ijc.108|pages=571}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (emphasis added)

==A Hybrid Future==
As outlined previously, hybrid institutions are becoming more prominent amid moves away from traditional government towards modes of governance more appropriate for complex issues. For instance, a great deal of political faith is being placed on hybrid institutions for tackling climate change in the form of carbon markets. Carbon markets are very much hybrid institutions in that they rely on governments to set the “rules for participation”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biermann, Van Asselt, Boas, Massey, Pattberg|title=Climate Governance Post-2012 Options for EU Policy-Makin|journal=CEPS Policy Brief|date=November 2008|volume=177|pages2=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as setting the cap or baseline, monitoring, verification and, as seen in the recently announced Australian carbon tax, setting a minimum price for carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reuters|title=Australian Senate passes carbon tax|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/08/australia-senate-passes-carbon-tax|accessdate=9 December 2011|newspaper=Guardian UK|date=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only once carbon markets have been “crafted”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biermann, Van Asselt, Boas, Massey, Pattberg|title=Climate Governance Post-2012 Options for EU Policy-Makin|journal=CEPS Policy Brief|date=November 2008|volume=|pages5=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by political decisions does the market aspect enter into play. The complexity and hybridity of the institutional set-up of carbon markers will be further increased if proposals to link carbon markets from different regions of the world come to fruition.

Another proposal concerns the creation of a new, hybrid institution to better manage the overlaps between the UN Climate Regime and the WTO in areas such as border taxes on environmentally damaging goods, transfer of clean technologies, and trade liberalisation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biermann, Van Asselt, Boas, Massey, Pattberg|title=Climate Governance Post-2012 Options for EU Policy-Makin|journal=CEPS Policy Brief|date=November 2008|volume=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; institutionalising joint consideration of climate change and development. Currently these issues are addressed by the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE), however there are questions as to whether this is sufficient. Even the IPCC (which avoids prescriptive policy advice) has questioned whether the CTE is “an appropriate forum”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=IPCC|title=Climate Change 2001|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=435}}&lt;/ref&gt; for such discussions.

Hybrid institutions then, have the potential to “bring together expertise, [...] and broaden dialogues to overcome negotiation deadlocks”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biermann, Van Asselt, Boas, Massey, Pattberg|title=Climate Governance Post-2012 Options for EU Policy-Makin|journal=CEPS Policy Brief|date=November 2008|volume=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legitimacy and accountability of these relatively novel arrangements rests upon establishing the right degree of institutionalisation and balanced hybridity, both of which vary within different contexts.

The '''International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA)''' represents over 5,300 amusement-industry members in more than 100 countries worldwide and operates several global amusement-industry trade shows. Its annual IAAPA Attractions Exposition (IAE) in [[Orlando, Florida]] is recognized as the world's largest amusement trade show in the number of attendees and exhibitors and providing members insight into current amusement trends, laws, operations and industry methodology. IAAPA also helps to promote guest- and ride-safety guidelines in conjunction with [[ASTM International]] and assists its members to uphold the highest amusement-industry safety and professional standards.

IAAPA represents a variety of location-based entertainment facilities, including [[amusement park|amusement]] and theme parks, family entertainment centers, [[Video arcade|arcade]]s, [[museum]]s, [[water park]]s, [[aquarium]]s, [[Science museum#Science center|science center]]s, [[zoo]]s, and [[resort]]s. It also represents industry equipment manufacturers, distributors, operators, industry suppliers, and service providers.

== History ==

In 1990, IAAPA established an international council in expand its global reach and give advice and direction about programs and services for members outside the United States. The council and its operations committee were instrumental in recruiting international members and developing quality products and services. IAAPA also established the IAAPA Hall of Fame, with amusement-industry pioneers its first class of inductees.

The following year, the 73rd annual convention and trade show in [[Orlando, Florida]] had over 19,000 attendees. The IAAPA Expo was the largest amusement-industry exhibition in the world, offering trends in amusement and arcade equipment, food, beverage, park technology and entertainment.

In 2000 the association worked to counter negative publicity following high-profile amusement-ride incidents and surrounding amusement safety, publicizing the industry’s overall safety record. It established a ride-incident reporting system for its U.S. facilities with rides (releasing the initial results in 2003 through the [[National Safety Council]]), and helped facilitate independent scientific reviews of ride forces in 2002-03 indicating the inherent safety of rides for the general public. In 2000, IAAPA opened its first full-time overseas office (IAAPA Europe) in [[Brussels]].

The organization acquired the Asian Amusement Expo (AAE) in 2003, but canceled the event because of the [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|SARS]] outbreak in Asia. IAAPA maintained its focus on industry safety that year, establishing an international standards harmonization group to implement universal ride-safety criteria. In 2004, it helped spearhead the adoption of the [[ASTM International]] amusement-ride design and manufacture standard and the European standard for amusement machinery and structures.

Two years later, IAAPA joined the Travel Industry Association of America to produce "The Economic Impact of Domestic and Overseas Travelers Who Visit Amusement/Theme Parks and Other Attractions in the United States" on the importance of amusement, theme parks and other attractions to U.S. tourism and its wider economy. The association extended membership to casinos and resorts, since a number of facilities had incorporated amusement and entertainment features. To promote park safety, IAAPA made its ride incident reporting system mandatory for U.S. members and supported Europarks' efforts to implement a similar system for its members. IAAPA encouraged voluntary ride reporting by its global partners, supplying background materials.

In 2007 the association opened a new office in Europe with expanded programs and services and increased collaboration with Europarks on ride-safety reporting, and held its annual senior-level training program (the Institute for Executive Education) to the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]]. At its Attractions Expo, the association unveiled its institute for emerging leaders (later renamed the Institute for Attractions Managers) to recruit candidates for senior-level positions.

The following year, IAAPA acquired the Euro Attractions Show (EAS). It held its first Middle East safety conference in [[Dubai]] in February, and had its inaugural Attractions Safety Awareness Week to enhance understanding of the industry’s safety practices and record in June.

In 2010, the IAAPA Foundation was created as a [[501(c)(3) organization]] to fund the development of education programs and information resources for the global attractions industry. The following year, the association implemented its certification program to help raise amusement-industry standards. Its Institute for Executive Education was revived in conjunction with [[San Diego State University]], and IAAPA's first "Latin America State of the Industry Report" and "European Manifesto" were released. In September 2016, the association announced plans to move its headquarters from [[Alexandria, Virginia]] to Orlando in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-iaapa-headquarters-relocating-orlando-20160920-story.html|title=IAAPA intends to move world HQ to Orlando|last=Pedicini|first=Sandra|date=September 21, 2016|work=|access-date=January 31, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|via=|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://attractionsmagazine.com/iaapa-announces-plans-relocate-headquarters-orlando/|title=IAAPA announces plans to relocate headquarters to Orlando|last=|first=|date=September 21, 2016|work=|access-date=January 31, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|via=|newspaper=Attractions Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to hold its expo in Orlando until 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://patch.com/virginia/oldtownalexandria/international-association-moving-headquarters-alexandria|title=International Association Moving Headquarters from Alexandria|last=Barton|first=Mary Ann|date=September 21, 2016|work=|access-date=January 31, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|via=|newspaper=The Patch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2016/09/21/breaking-news-iaapa-to-move-global-hq-to-orlando.html|title=IAAPA to move global HQ to Orlando, extend annual expo|last=Bilbao|first=Richard|date=September 21, 2016|website=Orlando Business Journal|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''integration of Latin America''' has a history going back to [[Hispanic America|Spanish American]] and [[Brazil]]ian independence, when there was discussion of creating a regional [[Sovereign state|state]] or [[confederation]] of [[Latin America]]n nations to protect the area's newly won autonomy. After several projects failed, the issue was not taken up again until the late 19th century, but now centered on the issue of [[international trade]] and with a sense of [[pan-Americanism]], owing to the United States of America taking a leading role in the project. The idea of granting these organizations a primarily [[International relations|political]] purpose did not become prominent again until the post-[[World War II]] period, which saw both the start of the [[Cold War]] and a climate of international cooperation that led to the creation of institutions such as the [[United Nations]]. It would not be until the mid-20th century that uniquely Latin American organizations were created.

==19th-century precedents==
At the end of the [[Spanish American wars of independence|wars of independence]] (1808–1825), many new [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] states emerged in the [[Americas]] from the former [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies]]. The [[South America]]n independence leader [[Simón Bolívar]] envisioned various unions that would ensure the independence of [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] vis-à-vis the European powers—in particular the [[United Kingdom]]—and the expanding United States. Already in his 1815 [[Cartagena Manifesto]], Bolívar advocated that the Spanish American provinces should present a united front to the Spanish in order to prevent their being re-conquered piecemeal, though he did not yet propose a political union of any kind. During the wars of independence, the fight against Spain was marked by only an incipient sense of [[nationalism]]. It was unclear what the new states that replaced the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish monarchy]] should be. Most of those who fought for independence identified with both their birth provinces and Spanish America as a whole, both of which they referred to as their ''[[Homeland|patria]]'', a term which incorporates meanings contained today in the English words "[[fatherland]]" and "[[homeland]]".&lt;ref&gt;Chasteen, John Charles (2008). ''Americanos: Latin America's Struggle for Independence''. Oxford University Press, 160-161. {{ISBN|978-0-19-517881-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Bolívar made advances against [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalist forces]], he began to propose the creation of various large states and confederations, inspired by [[Francisco de Miranda]]'s idea of an independent state consisting of all of Spanish America, which Miranda variously called "Colombia", the "American Empire" or the "American Federation".&lt;ref&gt;Miranda, Francisco de. "Proyectos constitucionales de Miranda" in Rudolfo Cortés, Santos (ed.) (1960). ''Antología documental de Venezuela, 1492-1900: Materiales para la enseñanza de la historia de Venezuela''. Caracas, 163. {{OCLC|569544}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819, Bolívar was able to successfully create a nation called "Colombia" (today referred to as [[Gran Colombia]]) out of several Spanish American provinces; in 1825, he proposed joining it to [[Peru]] and [[Upper Peru]] in a confederation or state that he suggested be called the "Bolivian Federation" or "Bolivian Union" and which historians refer to as the "Andean Confederation", but this never came about.&lt;ref&gt;Bushnell, David (1970). ''The Santander Regime in Gran Colombia''. Westport: [[Greenwood Press]], 325-335. {{ISBN|0-8371-2981-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chasteen, ''Americanos'', 164-165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolívar to [[Antonio José de Sucre]] (1826) in Bolívar, Simon, Vicente Lecuna and Harold A. Bierck (1951). ''Selected Writings of Bolívar''. New York: Colonial Press, 590-592, 633-634. {{OCLC|8633466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other large states that emerged from the disintegration of the Spanish Monarchy also failed to prove long-lived. The [[Federal Republic of Central America]], created out of the former [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], ceased to exist in 1840. The [[United Provinces of South America]] was never viable and suffered from nearly constant civil war between its provinces and the capital, [[Buenos Aires]]. [[Argentina]] would not become united until the 1850s. The 1836 attempt to reunite the key regions of the former [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] in a [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] fell apart after three years. Only [[Mexico]], which consisted of the core areas of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] remained as a physically large state in Latin America. The other regional exception was the [[Empire of Brazil]], from which [[Portugal]] essentially declared independence in 1820 by demanding the return of the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|Portuguese king and court]] from [[Rio de Janeiro]].

Bolívar also proposed a separate league of the newly independent Spanish American republics, and to this end organized the Amphictyonic Congress or the [[Congress of Panama]] in 1826. Bolívar did not invite Brazil, since it was a monarchy and he saw it as a threat to the new republics' existence, nor did he invite the government at Buenos Aires, since the region lacked any real political unity to effectively be represented. Only after pressure was placed on him was the United States invited to the congress, but one representative died ''en route'' and the other arrived after deliberations were concluded. The United Kingdom was present only as an observer. The congress did draft a "Treaty of Union, League, and Perpetual Confederation", a pact of mutual defense and commerce, but only Gran Colombia ratified it. Gran Colombia itself fell apart in 1830. Because of these failed projects, Latin American politicians often speak of regional integration as "Bolivar's dream".

[[File:Pan American Union, Washington, DC in 1943.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Pan American Union headquarters building in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1943.]]
Sixty-three years after the Amphictyonic Congress, a [[wikt:secretariat|secretariat]], the Commercial Bureau of the American Republics, was created by eighteen American nations in 1889 at the First Pan-American Conference to promote trade in the western hemisphere. The Commercial Bureau began functioning on April 14, 1890. The bureau was renamed the International Commercial Bureau at the Second International Conference of 1901–1902. At the Fourth Pan-American Conference in 1910, the name of the organization was changed to the Union of American Republics and the International Commercial Bureau became the [[Pan-American Conference|Pan American Union]].

==20th century==
The experience of [[World War II]] convinced hemispheric governments that unilateral action by one nation could not ensure the territorial integrity of the American nations in the event of extra-continental aggression, in particular [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] or [[Communism|communist]] incursions. To meet the challenges of global conflict in the [[Cold War]] period and to contain conflicts within the hemisphere, they adopted a system of [[collective security]], the [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]], popularly known as the Rio Treaty, in 1947. The following year, at the Ninth International Conference of American States, headed by [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[George Marshall]], twenty-one member states pledged to fight communism in the Americas, and transformed the Pan American Union into the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS). The transition was smooth. The Director General of the Pan American Union, [[Alberto Lleras Camargo]], became the OAS's first [[Secretary General of the Organization of American States|Secretary General]] and the organization began functioning in December 1951.

[[File:Cumbre Iberoamericana 2007.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The 2007 Ibero-American Summit in [[Santiago, Chile]].]]
By the late twentieth century, many Latin American leaders saw a need for an alternative organization that was not dominated by the United States. The experience of dealing with the 1970s and 1980s communist insurgencies in [[Central America]] through the creation of the [[Contadora Group]], which did not include the United States, inspired the creation of the [[Rio Group]] in 1986. The Rio Group did not create a secretariat or permanent body and instead chose to rely on yearly summits of heads of states.

Latin America also reached out to Europe, in particular its former colonial [[Metropole|mother countries]], to create other regional organizations based around common languages and cultures. In 1991 the governments of [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]] and Spain organized the First Ibero-American Summits of Heads of State and Governments in [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], Mexico. The result was the creation of the [[Ibero-American Summit|Iberoamerican Community of Nations]], which holds yearly summits of its heads of state.

==Uniquely Latin American organizations==
Trade, not politics, also served as the principal issue around which various, uniquely Latin American regional organizations were formed after mid-century. On October 14, 1951, the governments of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua signed a new treaty creating the [[Central American Integration System|Organization of Central American States]] ''(Organización de Estados Centroamericanos'', or ''ODECA)'' to promote regional cooperation, integration and unity in Central America. This led to the creation of the [[Central American Common Market]], the [[Central American Bank for Economic Integration]], and the [[Secretariat for Central American Economic Integration]] (SIECA) nine years later on December 13, 1960.

Other regional [[trade bloc]]s were also established in this period. The Latin American Free Trade Association (ALALC) was formed by the 1960 Treaty of Montevideo, which was signed by Argentina, Brazil, [[Chile]], Mexico, [[Paraguay]], Peru, and [[Uruguay]]. The signatories hoped to create a common market in Latin America and offered tariff rebates among member nations. Its main goal was to eliminate all duties and restrictions on the majority of their trade within a twelve-year period. ALALC came into effect on January 2, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitter, Philippe C. (1964). ''Mexico and Latin American Economic Integration''. California: Institute of International Studies, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the [[European Communities]], in 1980 the ALALC was transformed into the [[Latin American Integration Association]] (ALADI) by the second Treaty of Montevideo to pursue the more ambitious goal of improving the economic and social development of the region through the establishment of the common market.

In 1969 the Andean Pact was founded by Chile, [[Bolivia]], Peru, [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]]. In 1973, the pact gained its sixth member, [[Venezuela]]. In 1976, however, its membership was again reduced to five when Chile withdrew. Venezuela announced its withdrawal in 2006, reducing the Andean Community to four member states. The name of the organization was changed to the [[Andean Community of Nations]] (CAN) in 1996. In 1985 the presidents of Argentina and Brazil signed the Argentina-Brazil Integration and Economics Cooperation Program. This eventually led to the founding of [[Mercosur]] by Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina in 1991 to promote free trade and the fluid movement of goods, people, and currency. Venezuela joined Mercosur in 2012&lt;ref name=VEN2&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/vnezuela-officially-welcomed-into-mercosur-trade-bloc-during-ceremony-in-brazil/2012/07/31/gJQAFyNtMX_story.html Venezuela officially welcomed into Mercosur trade bloc during ceremony in Brazil (31 July 2012)] Reuters.

Venezuela left the G3 in 2006 at the same time it left the CAN. In addition to these trade organizations, several [[Legislature|parliamentary]] organizations have been created.  Mercosur agreed in December 2004 to create a [[Mercosur Parliament]], which should begin functioning in 2010. A [[Latin American Parliament]] was created in 1987; this is located in [[Panama City]].

In December 2004 Mercosur and the Andean Community of Nations signed a reciprocal associate-member status agreement and issued the [[Cusco Declaration]] stating that they would create a political South American Community of Nations. The Declaration purposely invoked "Bolívar's dream," noting that it would be partially realizing his vision of uniting Latin America. The original name of the union was changed to the current one, the [[Union of South American Nations]] in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cd0WAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA324&amp;lpg=PA324&amp;dq=In+December+2004+Mercosur+and+the+Andean+Community+of+Nations+signed+a+reciprocal+associate-member+status+agreement&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v5tzya2nWw&amp;sig=Bifh5kjUnWxFH8irBAfKmT26Zf0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20December%202004%20Mercosur%20and%20the%20Andean%20Community%20of%20Nations%20signed%20a%20reciprocal%20associate-member%20status%20agreement&amp;f=false|title=Laying the BRICS of a New Global Order: From Yekaterinburg 2009 to eThekwini 2013|last=Kornegay|first=Francis A.|last2=Bohler-Muller|first2=Narnia|publisher=Africa Institute of South Africa|year=2013|isbn=0798304030|location=|page=324|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2011 ''Declaration de Lima'', the [[Pacific Alliance]] was established in 2012 by the founding members Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. {{As of|2015}}, Costa Rica is in the process of joining. While membership is currently exclusively Latin American, a potential membership application by Canada is being considered favorably by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Campbell|title=Canada called ‘a natural fit’ for Pacific Alliance|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canada-called-a-natural-fit-for-pacific-alliance/article12032919/|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=8 October 2013|date=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scoffield|first=Heather|title=Harper says it's 'too early' to decide whether to join Pacific Alliance|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/harper-says-it-s-too-early-to-decide-whether-to-join-pacific-alliance-1.1293172|work=The Canadian Press|publisher=Bell Media|accessdate=8 October 2013|date=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public support for Latin American integration ==
Public support for Latin American integration is generally high but has been declining in many South and Central American countries over time. According to one study based on [[Latinobarómetro]] data, 73 percent of Latin Americans support economic integration and 63 percent support political integration in Latin America.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deutschmann|first=Emanuel|last2=Minkus|first2=Lara|date=2018|title=Swinging Leftward: Public Opinion on Economic and Political Integration in Latin America, 1997–2010|url=http://doi.org/10.25222/larr.250|journal=Latin American Research Review|language=en|volume=53|issue=1|pages=38|doi=10.25222/larr.250|issn=1542-4278|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also found that in most Latin American countries (twelve out of seventeen), support for economic integration was lower in 2010 than in 1997 and support for political integration decreased in nearly all countries (fourteen out of seventeen) between 2002 and 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Support for economic and political integration is higher among men than among women and increases with educational level. Coinciding with the shift to the left in Latin American politics ([[pink tide]]), the political left surpassed the right—and, at least in the case of support for political integration, also the center—to become the political wing favoring integration most highly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This trend is a divergence from the picture found in Europe for [[Pro-Europeanism|support of European integration]], which is generally highest among the political center.

'''''Legends of Bikini Bottom''''' is an [[anthology series]] of six episodes in the American [[list of animated television series|animated television series]] ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', as part of its [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 7)|seventh season]]. As the name suggests, the episodes have plots involving things like monsters, magic and mythical creatures. The episode called "Trenchbillies" first premiered on the online [[social networking service]] [[Facebook]] on January 27, 2011 before airing on [[Nickelodeon]] on January 29, 2011. The four others, titled "Sponge-Cano!", "The Main Drain", "The Monster Who Came to Bikini Bottom" and "Welcome to the Bikini Bottom Triangle" premiered on Nickelodeon as part of an hour-long special on January 28, 2011. The decision to air the series online was aimed at attracting "the young and the restless hooked to the internet and the social media."

In addition to the regular series cast, [[Amy Sedaris]], [[Ginnifer Goodwin]] and [[Kristen Wiig]] were guest stars. Tie-in promotions were made with [[Burger King]], which released a toy line based on the series. ''Legends of Bikini Bottom'' became available on a DVD of the same name on November 16, 2010, alongside the episode called "The Curse of the Hex". The series received positive reviews from media critics upon release.

==Reception==
{{quotebox
|quote="I was wary of watching ''SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom'' because the cartoon hasn't been true to its original spirit in the last few seasons. Episodes have been missing that special ingredient, if you will, that they had in early seasons. Recent specials, such as "[[The Great Patty Caper|Mystery with a Twistery]]" and "[[The Clash of Triton|Clash of the Tritons]]" were too slick, over-reaching and had only moments of the old brilliance. However, the episodes on ''Legends of Bikini Bottom'' are hilarious and destined to become favorites."

''Legends of Bikini Bottom'' received positive reviews from media critics. Nancy Basile of [[About.com]] positively reacted to the series and gave it a 4 out of 5 rating.&lt;ref name=Basile&gt;{{cite web|last=Basile|first=Nancy|title='SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom'|url=http://animatedtv.about.com/od/spongebobsquarepants/fr/Legends-Of-Bikini-Bottom.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She cited her favorite episodes like "Welcome to the Bikini Bottom Triangle" and "The Main Drain".&lt;ref name=Basile/&gt; She said "Firstly, you know an episode will be funny when it's titled 'Bikini Bottom Triangle'. My children had no idea why I was laughing at the title frame."&lt;ref name=Basile/&gt; her favorite scenes from the episode were "Gary's booty, watching the old sea dog spit his story and figuring out why Patrick wears cuff links."&lt;ref name=Basile/&gt; In another episode called "The Main Drain", she said "I won't ruin the set up because it's just so funny, but my favorite line is, 'It's now or never.' You have to see it to know why."&lt;ref name=Basile/&gt;

In his review for the [[DVD Talk]], Paul Mavis said "''SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom'' is all-new, and therein lies what has {{sic|becoming}} increasingly routine: haphazard quality. Some are mildly amusing, and others blow their promising set-ups."&lt;ref name=Mavis&gt;{{cite web|last=Mavis|first=Paul|title=SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/46762/spongebob-squarepants-legends-of-bikini-bottom/|publisher=DVD Talk|accessdate=8 September 2013|date=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added "Still, 'The Main Drain' and 'Trenchbillies' are fairly funny, while the magical warrior dolphin in 'Sponge-Cano!' may be worth the price of admission alone here."&lt;ref name=Mavis/&gt;

Danielle Sullivan of [[Babble.com]] said "My 13-year-old still loves ''SpongeBob'' and his quirky underwater friends, and I have to admit that the show makes me laugh a lot. It’s one of those unique blends that appeals to kids and parents." Michelle Lincaster of AllVoices, on the airing of the series on Facebook, said "''SpongeBob SquarePants'' has a 16,000,000 fan following on Facebook so the premiere of ''The Legends of Bikini Bottom'' on Facebook shouldn't come as a surprise."&lt;ref name=AllVoices/&gt;

Jeff Robbins of the [[DVD Verdict]] was mixed on the series and said "''SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom'', get ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''."&lt;ref name=Verdict&gt;{{cite web|last=Robbins|first=Jeff|title=SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/legendsbikinibottom.php|publisher=DVD Verdict|accessdate=8 September 2013|date=12 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922024402/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/legendsbikinibottom.php|archivedate=22 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing "The Monster Who Came to Bikini Bottom", he said "What is also notable here is the episode's ending, which features a brilliant call-back to an earlier seen flashback (more shades of ''Lost'') that ties up the threads of the episode as well as any [[Larry David]] penned half-hour. This first short is ''SpongeBob'' at its best." Robbins called "The Main Drain" as "Not a good episode." and "Sponge-Cano!" as "A strong segment."&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt; In reviewing "The Curse of the Hex", Robbins said "Unfortunately, this lousy episode ends the disc on a sour note as a hagfish curses The [[Krusty Krab]]. The only notable aspect to this dull segment is that the hagfish is voiced by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''{{'}}s [[Kristen Wiig]], which, depending on your current view of the comedy institution, may make the episode more or less interesting. Either the writers got tired of attempting allusions to ''Lost'' by this point, or I simply got tired of looking for them."&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt;

They include some of the earliest attested manuscripts of existing texts (such as the ''[[I Ching]]''), two copies of the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'', a copy of ''[[Zhan Guo Ce]]'', works by [[Gan De]] and [[Shi Shen]] and previously-unknown medical texts, such as ''[[Wushi'er Bingfang]]'' (''Prescriptions for Fifty-Two Ailments'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hnmuseum.com/hnmuseum/eng/whatson/exhibition/mwd_2_5.jsp|title=The Treasure on Silk and Inscribed Slips|website=Hunan Provincial Museum|accessdate=17 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704032000/http://www.hnmuseum.com/hnmuseum/eng/whatson/exhibition/mwd_2_5.jsp|archivedate=4 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars arranged them into 28 types of silk books.

The texts were buried in tomb number three at Mawangdui (which was sealed in 168 BC), and were hidden until their late-20th-century discovery. Some were previously known only by title, and others are previously-unknown commentaries on the ''I Ching'' attributed to [[Confucius]]. In general, they follow the same sequence as the received versions, which were passed down by copying and recopying texts collected and collated during the fifth century AD. However, in some important aspects they differ noticeably from the received texts known before their discovery. 

The Chinese characters in the silk texts are often only fragments of the characters used in later traditional versions. Many characters are formed by combining two simpler characters: one indicating a general category of meaning, and the other to guide pronunciation. Where the traditional texts have both components, the silk texts frequently give only the phonetic half of the character. There are several hypotheses to explain this:
* The scribe may have been too lazy to write the full form of many characters.
* The earlier of two silk texts (or the text from which it was copied) may have been a scribe taking dictation as quickly as they could write. The scribe wrote down the part of each character that indicates its pronunciation, with the intention of later recopying the text with the appropriate meaning components for the abbreviated characters.
* In English, "dog" has two apparently-unrelated meanings: a carnivorous mammal, or to pursue with unflagging patience. English speakers do not write "dog (the mammal)", even in the sentence "The feral dog dogged the human invaders of its territory until they eventually left the area". A similar understanding may have been assumed in the ancient writings.
* It may have been a form of jargon; similar writing of partial characters are found in ancient Chinese musical ([[pipa]], guqin and [[guzheng]]) scores. Partial characters and their derivatives are building blocks for the writing systems of some historical (such as [[Khitan language|Khitan]] and [[Tangut language|Tangut]]) and modern languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

In addition to partial characters mentioned above, the two-silk texts sometimes use characters different from those in later versions. This is similar to the English "She flowered the table" compared with "She floured the table", and the older version provides insight into a text's original meaning.

==''Tao Te Ching''==
Most received versions of the ''Tao Te Ching'' are in substantial agreement, and most text is simple and straightforward. Occasionally two versions will have a [[homonym]], and a third text with a character which is a synonym for one of the first two characters is useful. 

[[D. C. Lau]] and Robert G. Henricks have made new translations of the ''Tao Te Ching'' based on the silk text, largely ignoring the received texts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/may/31/dc-lau-obituary|title=DC Lau obituary|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=31 May 2010|accessdate=17 July 2016|last=Ames|first=Roger T.|authorlink1=Roger T. Ames}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Henricks' translation compares received versions with the text found in the tomb. In 1990, [[Sinology|sinologist]] [[Victor H. Mair]] translated the Ma-wang-tui version; Mair considered this earliest-known version (by 500 years) more authentic than the most-commonly-translated texts. The two silk books are part of the Cultural Relics from the Mawangdui Tombs collection at the [[Hunan Provincial Museum]].

A '''member state of the Caribbean Community''' is a state that has been specified as a member state within the [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]] or any other Caribbean state that is in the opinion of the Conference, able and willing to exercise the rights and assume the obligations of membership in accordance with article 29 of the Treaty of Chaguaramas. Member states are designated as either [[More economically developed country]] (MDCs) or [[Less economically developed countries]] (LDCs). These designations are not intended to create disparity among member states.&lt;ref name="A1"&gt;{{cite news| first=| last=| title=Treaty of Chaguarmas| work= | date= 4 July 1973| url=http://cms2.caricom.org/documents/4905-original_treaty-text.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Community was established by mainly [[English language|English-]] (and [[English Creole]]) speaking Caribbean countries, but has since become a multilingual organisation in practice with the addition of [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] [[Suriname]] on 4 July 1995 and [[French language|French]] and [[Haitian Creole]] speaking [[Haiti]] on 2 July 2002. As of 4 July 2002 there are fifteen full members of the [[Caribbean Community]], four of which are founding members.

===Anguilla===
In July 1999, Anguilla once again became involved with CARICOM when it gained associate membership. Before this, Anguilla had briefly been a part of CARICOM (1974–1980) as a constituent of the full member state of [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]].

===The Bahamas (1973-1983)===
The Bahamas had begun [[Caribbean Free Trade Association#Membership|participating in the regional cooperation and integration movement]] when it began attending the Heads of Government Conferences of the Commonwealth Caribbean in 1966. This practice continued even after the establishment of CARIFTA, of which The Bahamas was never a member, with The Bahamas being involved in educational cooperation and Committees established to deepen financial cooperation among CARIFTA states and the Bahamas and to transform CARIFTA into the Caribbean Community. In particular, The Bahamas was even included in a Committee of Attorneys-General tasked with examining the legal implications of forming the Caribbean Community and to draw up a draft Treaty for its formation. In April 1973, at the final meeting of the commonwealth Caribbean Heads of Government before the establishment of the Caribbean Community, the Conference welcomed the upcoming independence of The Bahamas in July 1973 and looked forward to its participation in the Caribbean Community.&lt;ref name="1973 Conference"&gt;[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/8hgc_1973_communique.jsp 8th  Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Caribbean Countries, 9-12 April 1973, Georgetown, Guyana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319192005/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/8hgc_1973_communique.jsp |date=19 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1974, the Bahamas (as well as Haiti and Suriname) indicated that it would like to join the Community.&lt;ref name="Area Handbook for Jamaica"&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|title=Area Handbook for Jamaica|year=1976|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|location=|isbn=|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bh_sAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=late+1974+bahamas+indicated+caricom&amp;dq=late+1974+bahamas+indicated+caricom&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwip_YWijbTPAhVFqR4KHcSWBC8Q6AEIMjAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahamian involvement with the Caribbean Community and regional integration continued in the same form after independence and the establishment of CARICOM as had occurred since 1966, with The Bahamas attending the second meeting of the CARICOM Heads of Government Conference in 1975 and being involved in the setting up of a special Inter-Governmental Committee on university education.&lt;ref name="1975 Conference"&gt;[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/2hgc_1975_communique_.jsp 2nd Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community, 8-10 December 1975, Basseterre, St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806133333/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/2hgc_1975_communique_.jsp |date=6 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the original Treaty of Chaguaramas (In Chapter I, Article 2) provided for The Bahamas to automatically join the Caribbean Community and Common Market upon application,&lt;ref name="Caribbean integration: the formation of CARIFTA and CARICOM"&gt;{{cite book|last=LeVeness|first=Frank Paul|title=Caribbean integration: the formation of Carifta and the Caribbean Community|year=1974|publisher=Deptartment of Government and Politics, St. John's University|location=|isbn=|pages=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5oUnAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Bahamas+and+the+Market+automatically+upon&amp;dq=Bahamas+and+the+Market+automatically+upon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfyPqHvL3PAhWKpB4KHdJkCo4Q6AEIKDAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Bahamas being listed alongside the actual member states as being a state to which membership of the Community may be open to.&lt;ref name="A1"/&gt; The final Conference of the Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community and The Bahamas at which this informal participation by The Bahamas continued was November 1982 Conference in Jamaica.&lt;ref name="1982 Conference"/&gt; At the next Conference, The Bahamas was formally admitted as a member of the Community.&lt;ref name="1983 Conference"&gt;[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/4hgc_1983_communique.jsp 4th Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community, 4-8 July 1983, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806141305/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/4hgc_1983_communique.jsp |date=6 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dominican Republic===
The [[Dominican Republic]] cooperates with CARICOM (since 1992) under an umbrella organisation, [[CARIFORUM]], an economic pact between CARICOM and the Dominican Republic with the [[European Union|EU]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080411103346/http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/la/pub/12_en.pdf The EU and Cariforum]&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominican Republic became an Observer of CARICOM in 1982 and in 1991 it presented CARICOM with a request for full membership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/2005/08/23/sanders.shtml |title=Dominican Republic in CARICOM? |publisher=Caribbeannetnews.com |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2011-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116054943/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/2005/08/23/sanders.shtml |archivedate=2009-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; having first given consideration to joining the bloc in 1989.&lt;ref name="Expand CARICOM"&gt;[http://www.newsday.co.tt/news/0,180302.html Expand CARICOM to include French, Dutch and Spanish]&lt;/ref&gt;  It also has an unratified free trade agreement (from 2001) with CARICOM. Within the EPA between the region and the European Commission, the Dominican Republic is given means for dispute resolution with CARICOM member-states. Under Article 234, the [[European Court of Justice]] also carries dispute resolution mechanisms between CARIFORUM and the European Union states.&lt;ref name="jamaica-gleaner.com"&gt;[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20091008/letters/letters1.html "Letter: Privy Council and EPA"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821110351/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20091008/letters/letters1.html |date=2014-08-21 }}, October 8, 2009, ''Jamaica Gleaner''&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly useful to the Dominican Republic which is not a member of the Caribbean Court of Justice and therefore cannot use the CCJ for dispute resolution with states of CARICOM.

In 2005 the Foreign Minister of the Dominican Republic proposed for the second time that the government of the Dominican Republic wished to obtain full membership status in CARICOM. However, due to the sheer size of the Dominican Republic's population and its economy being almost as large as all the current CARICOM states combined and coupled with the Dominican Republic's checkered history of foreign policy solidarity with the CARICOM states, it is unclear whether the CARICOM states will unanimously vote to admit the Dominican Republic as a full member into the organisation. CARICOM has been working at great pains in trying to integrate with Haiti. It has been proposed that CARICOM may deepen ties with the Dominican Republic through the auspice of the [[Association of Caribbean States]] (ACS) instead, which is an organisation that stops just short of the Single market and economy which underpins CARICOM.

In July 2013, The President of the Dominican Republic, [[Danilo Medina]], indicated that his country was still interested in joining CARICOM and appealed to CARICOM leaders meeting in Trinidad for the 40th anniversary of CARICOM to admit his country into the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stabroeknews.com/2013/news/regional/07/06/dominican-republic-bids-again-to-join-caricom/ Dominican Republic bids again to join Caricom]&lt;/ref&gt; His bid drew the support of Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister and the then Chairwoman of CARICOM, [[Kamla Persad-Bissessar]], who addressed the others CARICOM heads of government by saying “The ongoing reform process in the community must be one that will make CARICOM not only more efficient and effective but more relevant as well. In this regard, may I urge you to consider expanding our membership to welcome the Dominican Republic into the CARICOM family.” It is not clear whether the CARICOM Heads of Government will agree, but the move could prove critical as the Dominican Republic increasingly allies itself both with Latin America and Central America, having become a full member state of the Central American Integration System in late June 2013 (it was previously an associate member).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribjournal.com/2013/07/04/trinidad-pm-urges-caricom-to-accept-dominican-republic-as-member/ Trinidad PM Urges CARICOM to Accept Dominican Republic as Member]&lt;/ref&gt; The call for the Dominican Republic to be admitted as a full member of CARICOM was given a boost by the position of the Prime Minister of Barbados, [[Freundel Stuart]], who confirmed that the Dominican Republic was re-committed  “to joining the movement at such time that it would be convenient for all the perceivable imperatives to be satisfied,” and that “I agree with the Prime Minister that the larger the bloc becomes, the more powerful the bloc becomes and the more diversified the areas for joint action and for integration.” Stuart also remarked that it was a healthy development when Suriname and Haiti joined the movement and that the Heads of Government want to quicken the momentum in the expansion of CARICOM to countries without British heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribjournal.com/2013/07/09/stuart-dominican-republic-committed-to-joining-caricom/ Stuart: Dominican Republic Committed to Joining CARICOM]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, CARICOM announced that it would "suspend consideration of the request by the Dominican Republic for membership of the Caribbean Community" in response to a [[2013 Dominican Republic-Haiti diplomatic crisis|Dominican court ruling]] which revoked citizenship from tens of thousands, mostly descendants from illegal immigrants from Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2013/pres265_13.jsp|title=CARICOM STATEMENT ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE RULING OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC ON NATIONALITY|date=2013-11-26|accessdate=2013-12-09|publisher=CARICOM|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214011658/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2013/pres265_13.jsp|archivedate=2013-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbean360.com/news/trinidad_tobago_news/1086823.html#axzz2mLoo6K4L|title=CARICOM defers Dominican Republic application amid row over court ruling|date=2013-11-27|accessdate=2013-12-09|last=Richards|first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French West Indies===
The [[French Republic]] extends to [[Overseas departments and territories of France|several islands]] in the Caribbean that are not associated with CARICOM, and are instead part of the [[European Union]]:  [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Saint-Martin]], [[Saint Barthélemy]] and [[French Guiana]].  The CARICOM-DR-EU [[Economic Partnership Agreements|Economic Partnership Agreement]] (EPA) presently provides these areas with access to CARICOM markets. It was announced during summer of 2012 that the outer region area of [[Martinique]],  was pushing for France to become an Associate Member.  Trepubhe Foreign Minister of France, [[Laurent Fabius]], agreed to France being an associate member of CARICOM.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} At the Thirty-Fourth Meeting of the Heads of Government Conference in July 2013, the Heads of Government received the report of the Technical Working Group (TWG) established to review and provide recommendations on the terms and conditions of Membership and Associate Membership of the Community. They also agreed that the applications for Associate Membership of France (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique) and the Kingdom of the Nertherlands (Curaçao and St. Maarten), would require further deliberation at the level of Heads of Government.&lt;ref name="34th Meeting Communique"&gt;[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/34hgc_2013_communique.jsp Communique issued at the Conclusion of the 34th Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government in July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, it was reported that representatives of the French Republic had begun discussion with CARICOM on their application for associate membership. Teams from French Guiana (led by the President of the French Guiana Regional Council, Rodolphe Alexandre) and from Martinique met with CARICOM's Secretary-General Irwin LaRocque on 22 January 2015 and 21 January 2015 respectively. A team from Guadeloupe is due to hold similar discussion in February 2015.&lt;ref name="French territories seek associate membership"&gt;[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/French-islands-seeking-associate-membership-within-CARICOM French territories seeking associate membership within CARICOM]&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussions focused on regional cooperation, the terms and conditions for associate membership and the overall relation between the French Republic and CARICOM. Rodolphe Alexandre said that support in French Guiana strongly agreed with convergence of the Caribbean in health, climate change, education, economics and issues of bio-diversity. He also noted that French Guiana had already engaged with individual Community member states on issues related to mining (in this case, with Suriname) and energy (Trinidad &amp; Tobago).&lt;ref name="French territories seek associate membership"/&gt;

===Haiti (1974-2002)===
The first attempt by Haiti to join CARICOM began on 6 May 1974, when Haiti officially applied for membership in the Community&lt;ref name="Haiti and CARICOM"/&gt; after Edner Brutus, the Haitian Minister of Foreign Affairs, sent a letter to William Demas, CARICOM's Secretary-General formally applying for membership.&lt;ref name="Profile of an Applicant"/&gt; Shortly after that request, Haiti lobbied for admission, dealing mostly with [[Percival J. Patterson]], then Jamaica’s minister of industry, commerce, and tourism. Patterson welcomed the initiative and promised Jamaica’s unconditional support. Despite Patterson’s efforts, the CARICOM secretariat did  not respond positively to the request, and CARICOM leadership decided to pursue a special type of relationship with Haiti.&lt;ref name="Haiti and CARICOM"/&gt; Haiti was later accepted as an observer&lt;ref name="Haiti and CARICOM"/&gt; in 1982 &lt;ref name="Development in Suspense"/&gt; following an application for closer relations with the Community.&lt;ref name="1982 Conference"&gt;[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/3hgc_1982_communique.jsp 3rd Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community, 16-18 November 1982, Ocho Rios, Jamaica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806133719/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/3hgc_1982_communique.jsp |date=6 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 3, 1997, almost 25 years later, CARICOM chairman and Prime Minister of Jamaica Percival J. Patterson announced that Haiti was to become the fifteenth member country of CARICOM&lt;ref name="Haiti and CARICOM"/&gt; after the Heads of Government, in accordance with Article 29 of the (Original) Treaty of Chaguaramas had unanimously agreed to it.&lt;ref name="July 1997 Communique"&gt;[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/18hgc_1997_communique.jsp Communique Issued at the Conclusion of the Eighteenth Heads of Government Conference, July 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806141554/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/18hgc_1997_communique.jsp |date=2015-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This announcement was made alongside Haitian President René Préval at an unscheduled joint press conference in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Technically, Haiti had joined the Caribbean Community but not the common market (similar to The Bahamas' membership). It was later announced that, in accordance with Article 29(2) of the Treaty of Chaguaramas,&lt;ref name="July 1997 Communique"/&gt; a CARICOM technical working group would visit Haiti to consult with the Haitian government on the terms and conditions of full membership in CARICOM. The decision to admit Haiti raised a host of technical issues, including Haiti’s CARICOM dues, the extent to which French would also become an official language of CARICOM, and the extent to which existing CARICOM provisions allowing for the unfettered movement of member nationals would apply to Haiti. In the interim, Haiti was invited to participate in the deliberations of CARICOM’s organs and bodies.&lt;ref name="Haiti and CARICOM"&gt;[http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/1998_tardieu.pdf Haiti and CARICOM: The Challenges of Regional Integration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="July 1997 Communique"/&gt;

At the Twentieth Heads of Government meeting, in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, the Heads of Government and Haiti exchanged notes agreeing on the terms and conditions under which Haiti would accede to Membership of the Community. The Heads of Government looked forward to the early deposit of an Instrument of Accession by Haiti to the Treaty of Chaguaramas.&lt;ref name="July 1999 Communique"&gt;[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/20hgc_1999_communique.jsp Communique Issued at the Conclusion of The Twentieth Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), 4-7 July 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618153346/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/20hgc_1999_communique.jsp |date=18 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten and the Netherlands===
Aruba is an observer of CARICOM, as was the [[Netherlands Antilles]] before its [[Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles|dissolution]] in 2010.  No official report has been published on the eligibility for observer status of the Caribbean [[Countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|countries]] [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]] and the three [[Caribbean Netherlands|special municipalities]] of the Netherlands formed by the split.

The [[Netherlands Antilles]] had applied for the status of associate membership in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000030/003019.htm |title=Netherlands Antilles policy towards the Caribbean is one of committed neighbour |publisher=Caribbeannetnews.com |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2011-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717071648/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000030/003019.htm |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and both Curaçao and Sint Maarten launched applications to become associate members in CARICOM after their secession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todaysxm.com/2012/02/15/committee-appointed-to-handle-caricom-application/|title=Committee appointed to handle Caricom application|date=2012-02-15|accessdate=2012-08-10|publisher=Today|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512105125/http://www.todaysxm.com/2012/02/15/committee-appointed-to-handle-caricom-application/|archivedate=2013-05-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, the [[Prime Minister of Sint Maarten]], Sarah Wescot-Williams said she was pleased that a working group had been set up in Caricom to examine St.&amp;nbsp;Maarten's request for associate membership and was looking forward to its report.&lt;ref name="Sarah pleased with progress on Caricom associate membership"&gt;[http://www.dutchcaribbeanlegalportal.com/constitutional-news/1748-sarah-pleased-with-progress-on-caricom-associate-membership Sarah pleased with progress on Caricom associate membership]&lt;/ref&gt; Former Caribbean Association of Industry and Commerce (CAIC) Secretary Ludwig Ouenniche said the St.&amp;nbsp;Maarten Chamber of Commerce, of which he also served as a board member, has been "aggressive in advising" the St.&amp;nbsp;Maarten government to move towards a closer relationship with CARICOM over the years due to the Chamber's membership in the CAIC. The benefits for St.&amp;nbsp;Maarten are vast, especially the ability to tap into funding and programmes not accessible now because of non-membership, he added. Caricom countries are benefiting from European Union funding and other sources of financing shut off to St.&amp;nbsp;Maarten because of its constitutional position as a country within the Dutch Kingdom; associate membership would clear this barrier. Among the benefits would be access to cheaper generic medication to treat, for example, HIV/AIDS thanks to Caricom agreements and programmes. What makes this move even more important is the benefit the country would be able to reap for the large number of people living in St.&amp;nbsp;Maarten who are originally from Caricom member countries; according to Ouenniche "some 65 per cent" of St.&amp;nbsp;Maarten's population is of Caricom origin.&lt;ref name="Ouenniche: Associate membership of Caricom ‘win-win’ situation for country"&gt;[http://www.thedailyherald.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19406:ouenniche-associate-membership-of-caricom-win-win-situation-for-country-&amp;catid=24:weekender&amp;Itemid=37 Ouenniche: Associate membership of Caricom ‘win-win’ situation for country]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, a delegation from Sint Maarten met with the Caricom Secretary-General to continue discussing the terms and conditions of the associate membership status that St. Maarten is seeking. The delegation also received information on the work, structure and ongoing reforms of the Secretariat and the Community. As an observer, St. Maarten has attended meetings of the COHSOD (Council for Human and Social Development) and participates in the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) and offers the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) curricula and examinations in its schools.&lt;ref name="CARICOM SG meets St. Maarten delegation"&gt;[http://today.caricom.org/2015/09/16/caricom-sg-meets-sint-maarten-delegation-on-associate-membership/]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, at the margins of an EU-Caribbean conference on sustainable energy in Bridgetown, Barbados, the Prime Minister of Sint Maarten, William Marlin, met with CARICOM's Secretary General Ambassador Mr. Irwin LaRocque to discuss the progress of Sint Maarten's application for associate membership and the potential for further, structured regional cooperation between CARICOM/CARIFORUM and the Caribbean [[Overseas Countries and Territories]] (OCTs) of the EU. Ambassador LaRocque informed Prime Minister Marlin that the associate membership applications of Sint Maarten, Curacao and Aruba were being attended to be a technical working group established specially for devising the terms and conditions of associate membership, as such terms had not been spelled out in the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas. LaRocque also noted that CARICOM was working on an enlargement policy for new member states to be submitted to the Heads of Government for agreement by the end of the year. Sint Maarten had officially applied for associate membership of CARICOM in January 2014 when it sent an official letter of interest. &lt;ref name="PM Marlin discusses associate membership"&gt;[http://smn-news.com/st-maarten-st-martin-news/23877-prime-minister-marlin-discusses-associate-membership-to-caricom-during-barbados-working-visit-2.html Prime Minister Marlin discusses Associate Membership to CARICOM during Barbados working visit]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suriname (1973-1996)===
In the 1973, around the time the Caribbean Free Trade Association was being transformed into CARICOM, Suriname was granted Liaison Status/Observer Status in the Association.&lt;ref name="Development in Suspense"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="CARIFTA and Caribbean Trade"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25612596?uid=3738312&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101223196697 CARIFTA and Caribbean Trade: An Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Externally Vulnerable Regional Integration"&gt;[http://www.richardbernal.net/Caricom_Externally_Vulnerable.pdf CARICOM: Externally Vulnerable Regional Integration]&lt;/ref&gt;

This marked the beginning of the re-engagement of Suriname and Anglophone Caribbean in terms of economic and political cooperation, following a period from 1926 to the 1960s when representatives from Suriname first attended the British Guiana and West Indian Labour Conferences (BGWILC) and then became members of the [[Caribbean Labour Congress]].&lt;ref name="International Labor Organizations: A History"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Robert|title=International Labor Organizations and Organized Labor in Latin America and the Caribbean: A History|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=|isbn=|pages=312|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wB_RzHeVWHMC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=british+west+indian+and+guianese+labour+congress+dutch+guiana+federation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dX-lJanl_9&amp;sig=_zAwnRWL4zcAU-uJJaf1NY7zVFY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIucvo7b3XAhVH5iYKHXlKCvcQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20west%20indian%20and%20guianese%20labour%20congress%20dutch%20guiana%20federation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="70th Anniversary of CLC"&gt;[http://bwu-bb.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=180:70th-anniversary-of-the-caribbean-labour-congressbarbados-conference&amp;catid=11:news&amp;Itemid=16 70th Anniversary of the Caribbean Labour Congress/Barbados Conference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Visions of Critchlow"&gt;[http://www.caribbeancongressoflabour.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Ashton-Chase-Vision-struggles-and-victories-of-Hubert-Nathaniel-Critchlow-1.pdf The Visions, Struggles and Victories of Hubert Nathaniel Critchlow]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Labour in the West Indies"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=William Arthur|title=Labour in the West Indies: The Birth of a Worker's Movement|year=1977|publisher=New Beacon Books|location=|isbn=|pages=104|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Labour_in_the_West_Indies.html?id=AegkAQAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History of Organized Labour in the West Indies"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Robert|title=A History of Organized Labor in the English-speaking West Indies|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=|isbn=|pages=485|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCmTbz1XdMwC&amp;pg=PA423&amp;lpg=PA423&amp;dq=caribbean+labour+congress&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zLVhuDP5nU&amp;sig=vGB_S-093FLEManQLNwAU3DLvGk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjuu4aV873XAhWE7SYKHa7nAgMQ6AEISDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=caribbean%20labour%20congress&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Labour Conferences had called for the establishment of a [[West Indies Federation|federation]] in the British West Indies, and eventually also led to the establishment of the CLC in 1945.&lt;ref name="International Labor Organizations: A History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History of Organized Labour in the West Indies"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="70th Anniversary of CLC"/&gt; The CLC itself was active until 1956, at which point it was dissolved following first a schism in the regional trade union movement that reflected the global split between the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] (WFTU) and the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] (ICFTU) in 1949, and secondly the establishment of a rival body, the Caribbean Division of [[ORIT]] (the ICFTU Inter American Regional Organisation of Workers) or CADORIT in 1952.&lt;ref name="International Labor Organizations: A History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History of Organized Labour in the West Indies"/&gt;

By then however the early drive of the BGWILC/CLC to promote economic and political cooperation among its delegates' member territories had lost steam, partly because of the successful achievement of a federation among some of the British West Indian territories in 1958 and because that very federation began to falter in 1961-1962. The prospects for economic integration of Suriname with the Anglophone Caribbean only briefly experienced a resurgence in 1964-1965 as [[Eric Williams]] had engaged in (ultimately failed) diplomacy to establish a [[Caribbean Economic Community]] encompassing all of the Anglophone Caribbean, the Dutch West Indies (Netherlands Antilles and Suriname) and the French West Indies.&lt;ref name="The Political History of CARICOM"&gt;{{cite book|last=Payne|first=Anthony|title=The Political History of CARICOM|year=2008|publisher=Ian Randle Publishers|location=|isbn=|pages=306|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iMi-VDn_XW4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA24&amp;lpg=RA1-PA24&amp;dq=eric+williams+%22caribbean+economic+community%22+suriname&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PGVZZebvQi&amp;sig=Ckl_5O3kRQBoOf9Doa8Q9VMpXUE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ34X3-73XAhVL6SYKHaZ1Ay8Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=eric%20williams%20%22caribbean%20economic%20community%22%20suriname&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conference agreed that they would seek to make a determination of the application at the next Inter-Sessional Meeting of the Conference.&lt;ref name="July 1994 Communique"/&gt; At that Inter-Sessional Meeting the Heads of Government agreed to approve the application by Suriname for membership in the Caribbean Community and Common Market with effect from the Sixteenth Meeting of the Conference, in July 1995, on terms and conditions agreed by both sides.&lt;ref name="February 1995 Communique"&gt;[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/6inthgc_1995_communique.jsp Communique Issued at the Conclusion of The Sixth Inter-Sessional Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community was held in Belize City, Belize on 16–17 February 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618153229/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/6inthgc_1995_communique.jsp |date=18 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 July 1995, The Conference formally admitted Suriname as the fourteenth Member of the Caribbean Community, following the deposit of the Instruments of Accession to the Treaty of Chaguaramas and the Common Market Annex. The instrument of Accession to the Common Market made provision for Suriname to implement the arrangements relating to the Common Market effective 1 January 1996.&lt;ref name="July 1995 Communique"&gt;[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/16hgc_1995_communique.jsp Communique Issued at the Conclusion of The Sixteenth Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community was held in Georgetown, Guyana on 4 – 7 July, 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618152745/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/16hgc_1995_communique.jsp |date=2015-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suriname's accession to the Community and the Common Market led to significant changes in Suriname's external trade policy as prior to accession, a multiple tariff regime ranging from 0 to 100 percent under the Brussels Tariff Nomenclature (BTN) classification system was in force. In preparation for CARICOM membership, this system was replaced in 1994 with the Harmonized System (HS) used as the basis for determining duty-free entry of goods of CARICOM origin and for applying the common external tariff. Suriname's 1996 entry into the free trade area was immediate with no major transition phase contemplated in the accession agreement apart from some exceptions granted under the Treaty of Chaguaramas and a few others negotiated by Suriname upon entry.&lt;ref name="Breaking from Isolation"/&gt;

===United States Virgin Islands===
In 2007, the U.S. Virgin Islands government announced it would begin seeking ties with CARICOM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandjournal.net/reportc.htm?section=caribbeannewsnow&amp;story=BVI-and-USVI-officials-identify-areas-of-mutual-interest&amp;id=673&amp;catid=29 "USVI, BVI leaders discuss areas of mutual interest"]&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time it was not clear what membership status the USVI would obtain should they join CARICOM with the most likely possibility being observer status, considering fellow U.S. Caribbean territory Puerto Rico's current observer status. In 2012, it was confirmed by the USVI Commissioner of Tourism, Beverly Nicholson-Doty, that the U.S. Virgin Islands government has been lobbying for observer status within CARICOM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmultimedia.org/radio/english/2012/02/us-virgin-islands-seeks-closer-cooperation-with-its-neighbours/ US Virgin Islands seeks closer cooperation with its neighbours]&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting of the Caribbean Tourism Organization in Martinique on October 19, 2013, the [[Governor of the United States Virgin Islands]] (USVI) [[John de Jongh]] said his administration has drafted legislation that will allow visitors from the CARICOM full members and associate members to enter that territory without a US visa. This comes as part of the USVI government’s plans to encourage more CARICOM nationals to visit the USVI.&lt;ref name="USVI To Waive Visa Restrictions For CARICOM Citizens"&gt;[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/latest/article.php?id=48760 US Virgin Islands To Waive Visa Restrictions For CARICOM Citizens]&lt;/ref&gt;

If successful the proposal would recreate the visa-free regime which existed for CARICOM nationals travelling to the USVI prior to 1975. At that time, the United States imposed visa requirements on Commonwealth Caribbean nationals travelling to the USVI, resulting in the 1975 Caricom Heads of Government Conference passing a resolution expressing concerning for the viability of the LIAT airline as a result of the new visa requirements and calling on the United States to revise the new visa policy and to implement the required measures arising from decisions at a meeting of Labour Departments and Ministries of English-speaking Caribbean countries in [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] to institute screening procedures in order regularize the immigration of CARICOM nationals to the USVI.&lt;ref name="1975 Conference"/&gt;

de Jongh said the proposal has received bi-partisan support in the US House of Representatives&lt;ref name="USVI visa waiver likely for Caricom nationals"&gt;[http://www.antiguaobserver.com/usvi-visa-waiver-likely-for-caricom-nationals/ USVI visa waiver likely for Caricom nationals]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as support the Senate and the Department of Homeland Security,&lt;ref name="USVI To Waive Visa Restrictions For CARICOM Citizens" /&gt; but admits he doesn't know how soon the regime could be implemented, noting the pace of legislation in the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref name="USVI To Waive Visa Restrictions For CARICOM Citizens" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USVI visa waiver likely for Caricom nationals" /&gt;

The governor is, however, confident of a positive outcome having already had discussions on the subject with officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security “to come up with a regime which they will feel comfortable with.”&lt;ref name="USVI visa waiver likely for Caricom nationals" /&gt;

de Jongh said the US Virgin Islands wants closer relations with the 15-member CARICOM grouping&lt;ref name="USVI Moving Toward Visa-Free Travel For CARICOM Nationals"&gt;[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/extra/article.php?id=3036 USVI Moving Toward Visa-Free Travel For CARICOM Nationals]&lt;/ref&gt; and wants an opportunity to share in the movement of Caribbean nationals throughout the region&lt;ref name="USVI To Waive Visa Restrictions For CARICOM Citizens" /&gt; and is convinced that making travel easier for Caricom countries' nationals will be beneficial to the territories.&lt;ref name="USVI visa waiver likely for Caricom nationals" /&gt;

“We recognise that with respect to sports tourism, sailing events and shopping, the region presents tremendous opportunity”, De Jongh told regional journalists.&lt;ref name="USVI visa waiver likely for Caricom nationals" /&gt;

The initiative by de Jongh is actually not new having been first launched in 2012,&lt;ref name="H.R. 5875 (112th): Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2012"&gt;[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr5875 H.R. 5875 (112th): Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; when de Jongh was quoted as saying that the “waivers would be specifically for individuals who are traveling for sporting events, medical services, and general tourism”.&lt;ref name="REGIONAL: USVI starts legislative measure aimed at removing visa requirement for CARICOM nationals"&gt;[http://bvinews.com/bvi/usvi-starts-legislative-measure-aimed-at-removing-visa-requirement-for-caricom-nationals/ REGIONAL: USVI starts legislative measure aimed at removing visa requirement for CARICOM nationals]&lt;/ref&gt;

de Jongh is further quoted as saying: “We fully believe that such a change would broaden our reach into neighboring Caribbean markets. The territory’s sporting events are growing in popularity and prestige, especially for competitions in volleyball, track, tennis, swimming and sailing. An amendment to the immigration bill would allow for easier travel for athletes, as well as for individuals seeking top-notch medical care or just looking for a great place for a vacation, that is close to home.”&lt;ref name="REGIONAL: USVI starts legislative measure aimed at removing visa requirement for CARICOM nationals" /&gt;

The bill was relaunched (entitled The Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2013)&lt;ref name="H.R. 1966: Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2013"&gt;[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr1966 H.R. 1966: Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives on May 14, 2013 and was referred to the House Judiciary's Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security.&lt;ref name="Summary: H.R.1966"&gt;[http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-bill/1966 "H.R.1966: Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2013"]&lt;/ref&gt; It was not enacted during the life of that Congress.&lt;ref name="Summary: H.R.1966"/&gt;

On April 29, 2015 the new [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives#The Virgin Islands and Guam|Virgin Islands delegate]], [[Stacey Plaskett]], reintroduced the identical bill (now entitled The Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2015) to the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="Summary: H.R.2116"&gt;[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr2116 H.R.2116: Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day it was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary and then on June 1, 2015 it was referred to the House Judiciary's Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security&lt;ref name="Summary: H.R.2116 Actions"&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2116/all-actions?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+2116%22%5D%7D All Actions H.R.2116 (Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2015) — 114th Congress (2015-2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the 2013 bill, this one also died during the life of the Congress, and the legislation was reintroduced by Plaskett in 2017 (The Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2017) in the next Congress.&lt;ref name="Summary: H.R.187"&gt;[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr187 H.R.187: Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R. 187"&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/187 House Bill: Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Delegate Plaskett, stated that the Bill (along with two others introduced by her) were geared towards improving the economy of the US Virgin Islands, with the special visa waiver program in particular aimed at boosting tourism by allowing the US Virgin Islands host more participants in seasonal regional sporting events and patients intending to access the US Virgin Islands' medical facilities without the need for visas.&lt;ref name="Plasket introduces visa-waiver legislation"&gt;[http://viconsortium.com/business/plaskett-introduces-legislation-granting-visa-waivers-to-caricom-countries/ Plasket introduces legislation granting visa waiver to Caricom countries]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plaskett Press Release on Visa Waiver bill"&gt;[https://plaskett.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/plaskett-introduces-new-legislation-aimed-improving-economic-conditions Plaskett Introduces New Legislation Aimed At Improving Economic Conditions In The Territory]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caricom nationals would still require a visa to travel to the U.S. mainland and other U.S. territories.&lt;ref name="USVI visa waiver likely for Caricom nationals" /&gt;

===Relationship to other supranational Caribbean organisations===
{{update|Anguilla|date=February 2012}} &lt;!-- It would also be nice if the flags were clickable and linked to country articles, otherwise you have to learn all the flags to make any sense of the diagram. --&gt;
Although the group has close ties with [[Cuba]], that nation was excluded due to lack of full democratic internal political arrangement.

{{more footnotes|date=October 2008}}

The '''Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard''' ('''METS''') is a [[metadata standards|metadata standard]] for encoding descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata regarding objects within a digital library, expressed using the [[XML]] schema language of the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C). The standard is maintained as part of the [[MARC standards]] of the [[Library of Congress]], and is being developed as an initiative of the [[Digital Library Federation]] (DLF).

==Overview==
METS is an XML Schema designed for the purpose of:
* Creating XML document instances that express the hierarchical structure of [[digital library]] objects.
* Recording the names and locations of the files that comprise those objects.
* Recording associated [[metadata]]. METS can, therefore, be used as a tool for modeling real world objects, such as particular document types.

Depending on its use, a METS document could be used in the role of [[Submission Information Package]] (SIP), Archival Information Package (AIP), or Dissemination Information Package (DIP) within the Open Archival Information System ([[OAIS]]) Reference Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems|title=Space Data and Information Transfer System -- Open Archival Information System -- Reference Model (ISO 14721:2012)|date=2012|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|location=Geneva|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital libraries vs traditional libraries===
Maintaining a library of digital objects requires maintaining metadata about those objects. The metadata necessary for successful management and use of digital objects is both more extensive than and different from the metadata used for managing collections of printed works and other physical materials. METS is intended to promote the preservation of, and interoperability between digital libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDonough|first=Jerome|date=April 2006 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2142/177 |title=METS: Standardized Encoding for Digital Library Objects|journal=International Journal on Digital Libraries |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=148–158 }} Available as a [https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/177/METS.pdf?sequence=2 PDF file] via ideals.illinois.edu. PDF p. 1, 20-21. Retrieved 17 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Where a '''traditional [[library]]''' may record descriptive metadata regarding a book in its collection, the book will not dissolve into a series of unconnected pages if the library fails to record structural metadata regarding the book's organization, nor will scholars be unable to evaluate the book's worth if the library fails to note, for example, that the book was produced using a [[Ryobi offset press]].
* The same cannot be said for a '''digital library'''. Without structural metadata, the page image or text files comprising the digital work are of little use, and without technical metadata regarding the digitization process, scholars may be unsure of how accurate a reflection of the original the digital version provides. 
* However, in a digital library it is possible to create an eBook-like PDF file or TIFF file which can be seen as a single physical book and reflect the integrity of the original.

===Flexibility and interoperability===
The open flexibility of METS means that there is not a prescribed vocabulary which allows many different types of institutions, with many different document types, to utilize METS. The customization of METS makes it highly functional internally, but creates limitations for interoperability. Interoperability becomes difficult when the exporting and importing institutions have used vocabularies. As a workaround for this problem the creation of institutional profiles has become popular. These profiles document the implementation of METS specific to that institution helping to map content in order for exchanged METS documents to be more usable across institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=J.|author2=Pearson, D. |author3=Williams, M. |author4=Yeadon, S. |title=The Australian METS Profile – A journey about metadata.|journal=D-Lib Magazine|date=2008|volume=14|issue=3/4|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march08/pearce/03pearce.html|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Lindsey|title=METS: A Survey of Recent Literature and Applications|journal=Library Philosophy and Practice|date=2011|volume=2011|series=ISSN 1522-0222|url=http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~mbolin/wagner.htm|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
As early as 1996 the [[University of California, Berkeley]] began working toward the development of a system that combined encoding for an outline of a digital object's structure with metadata for that object. In 1998 this work was expanded upon by the Making of America II project (MoAII). An important objective of this project was the creation of a standard for digital objects that would include defined metadata for the descriptive, administrative, and structural aspects of a digital object. A type of structural and metadata encoding system using an XML [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD) was the result of these efforts. The MoAII DTD was limited in that it did not provide flexibility in which metadata terms could be used for the elements in the descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata portions of the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDonough|first=Jerome|date=April 2006 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2142/177 |title=METS: Standardized Encoding for Digital Library Objects|journal=International Journal on Digital Libraries |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=148–158 }} Available as a [https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/177/METS.pdf?sequence=2 PDF file] via ideals.illinois.edu. PDF p. 2. Retrieved 17 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, a new version of the DTD was developed that used [[namespaces]] separate from the system rather than the vocabulary of the previous DTD. This revision was the foundation for the current METS schema, officially named in April of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Cundiff, M. V. (2004).

==Characteristics==
[[File:PARTSangles.jpg |thumb|upright=1.1 |Sections of a METS document]]
Any METS document has the following features:
* An open standard (non-proprietary)
* Developed by the library community
* Relatively simple
* Extensible
* Modular

==The 7 sections of a METS document==
* '''METS header''' metsHdr: the METS document itself, such as its creator, editor, etc.
* '''Descriptive Metadata''' dmdSec: May contain internally embedded metadata or point to metadata external to the METS document. Multiple instances of both internal and external descriptive metadata may be included.
* '''Administrative Metadata''' amdSec: Provides information regarding how files were created and stored, intellectual property rights, metadata regarding the original source object from which the digital library object derives, and information regarding the provenance of files comprising the digital library object (such as master/derivative relationships, migrations, and transformations). As with descriptive metadata, administrative metadata may be internally encoded or external to the METS document.
* '''File Section''' fileSec: Lists all files containing content which comprise the electronic versions of the digital object. &lt;tt&gt;file&lt;/tt&gt; elements may be grouped within &lt;tt&gt;fileGrp&lt;/tt&gt; elements to subdivide files by object version. Although this section is not required, it is typically included in most METS documents as it adds a level of functionality to the structure of the document.
* '''Structural Map''' structMap: Outlines a hierarchical structure for the digital library object, and links the elements of that structure to associated content files and metadata. The Structural Map is the only section required for all METS documents.
* '''Structural Links''' structLink: Allows METS creators to record the existence of hyperlinks between nodes in the Structural Map. This is of particular value in using METS to archive Websites.
* '''Behavioral''' behaviorSec: Used to associate executable behaviors with content in the METS object. Each behavior has a mechanism element identifying a module of executable code that implements behaviors defined abstractly by its interface definition.

==METS profiles==
A profile is expressed as an XML document. There is a schema for this purpose. The profile expresses the requirements that a METS document must satisfy.
A sufficiently explicit METS Profile may be considered a ''data standard''.

===METS profiles in use===
* Musical Score (may be a score, score and parts, or a set of parts only)
* Print Material (books, pamphlets, etc.)
* Music Manuscript (score or sketches)
* Recorded Event (audio or video)
* [[PDF]] Document
* Bibliographic Record
* Photograph
* Compact Disc
* Collection

The '''Monterozzi necropolis''' is an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[necropolis]] on a hill east of [[Tarquinia]] in [[Lazio]], [[Italy]]. The necropolis has about 6,000 graves, the oldest of which dates to the 7th century BC. About 200 of the gravestones are decorated with [[fresco]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etruscanplaces.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=63&amp;lang=en |title=Monterozzi, Etruscan Necropolis |work=Etruscanplaces.net |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monterozzi was designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2004, notable as ''the depiction of daily life in the frescoed tombs, many of which are replicas of Etruscan houses, is a unique testimony to this vanished culture''.
[[File:UrnesMonterozzi.jpg|thumb|Buildings now replace the surface mounds (tumuli) to protect the subterranean tombs. Foreground: early Villanovan tombs]]

==Description==
The burial ground dates from the Iron Age, or [[Villanovan]] period (9th century BC), up to Roman times.
From the Villanovan period simple round tombs carved from rock for cremation burials can be seen at the site.

Towards the end of the 8th c. BC, the first funerary chambers appeared as family tombs due to the rise to power of an aristocracy. These appeared on the surface as [[tumuli]], sometimes assuming impressive proportions to enhance the power and prestige of the nobles, as can be seen especially in the so-called King and Queen tombs. There were about 600 tumuli still visible in the 19th century, following which many were razed after excavation.

The tumuli usually covered subterranean chambers carved into the rock, containing [[sarcophagi]] and personal possessions of the deceased, and many of which have wall paintings.

The earliest sarcophagi are carved with the image of the deceased supine on the lid. The later and more numerous types show him or her reclining on the left side, facing the spectator and frequently holding a libation vessel; occasionally a man displays an inscribed scroll listing his ancestry and the magisterial offices he occupied. During the second half of the 4th century BC sculpted and painted sarcophagi of nenfro, marble and alabaster came into use. They were deposited on rock-carved benches or against the walls in the now very large underground chambers.

Sarcophagi were also decorated with reliefs of symbolic or mythological content, often derived from Tarentine models. Sarcophagi of this type, which continue until the second century, are found in such numbers at Tarquinia that they must have been manufactured locally. The walls of the tomb-chambers of the late period are painted with underworld demons escorting the dead on their journey to the beyond, scenes in the nether world, processions of magistrates and other symbols of the rank of the eminent members of the families buried there.

Among the most notable painted tombs famous for the artistic quality of their frescoes are:
*the [[Tomb of the Leopards]] has some of the best preserved frescoes
*the [[Tomb of the augurs|Tomb of the Augurs]]
*the [[Tomb of Hunting and Fishing]] 
*the [[Tomb of the Triclinium]] 
*the [[Tomb of the Blue Demons]]
*the [[Tomb of the Bulls]], the earliest tomb decorated with complex frescoes dated to either 540–530&amp;nbsp;BC or 530–520&amp;nbsp;BC. It is one of the rare Etruscan tombs which have erotic frescoes
*the [[Tomb of the Whipping]]. It is also one of the rare Etruscan tombs which have erotic frescoes. 
*the [[Tomb of Orcus]] is notable for having the only known pictorial depiction of the Etruscan [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]] [[Tuchulcha]]

'''''Music Forum''''' was an [[academic journal]] (published in the form of a book series) specializing in [[music theory]] and [[musical analysis|analysis]], with a particular focus on [[Schenkerian analysis|Schenkerian theory and analysis]]. It was published between 1967 and 1987.

According to [[David Carson Berry]], ''Music Forum'' (''MF'') was "[f]ounded and edited jointly by [[Felix Salzer]] and William J. Mitchell," and was "published sporadically" from its debut in 1967 "until its sixth volume ... in 1987, the year after Salzer's death. As the editors proclaimed in the inaugural volume, ''MF'' was to have 'a definite and unifying point of view' traceable to Schenker's ideas (and their extensions). Although many of the articles in ''MF'' would address tonal music of the period studied by Schenker himself, the goal was also to publish the work of those 'who recognize the more universal values that lie dormant in [Schenker's] ideas and are capable of providing valuable insights into earlier and later music.' Whereas Schenker-influenced studies of twentieth-century or 'post-tonal' music had become relatively frequent following Salzer's ''Structural Hearing'' (1952), similar approaches to 'pre-tonal' music had been nearly non-existent since Salzer's ''Sinn und Wesen der abendlandischen Mehrstimmigkeit'' (1935), which was not widely available in the U.S. One of ''MF'''s legacies was changing that, as five such articles appeared in its initial two volumes ...."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Carson Berry]], "Schenkerian Theory in the United States: A Review of Its Establishment and a Survey of Current Research Topics," ''Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft für Musiktheorie'' 2/2–3 (2005), 110-111 (online version at http://www.gmth.de/zeitschrift/artikel/206.aspx).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Obstructionism''' is the practice of deliberately delaying or preventing a process or change, especially in politics.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-cobuild/obstructionism&lt;/ref&gt;

==As workplace aggression==
An obstructionist causes problems. Neuman and Baron (1998) identify obstructionism as one of the three dimensions that encompass the range of [[workplace aggression]]. In this context, obstructionism is "behaviors intended to hinder an employee from performing their job or the organization from accomplishing its objectives.".&lt;ref&gt;Neuman, J.H., &amp; Baron, R.A. (1998). Workplace violence and workplace aggression: Evidence concerning specific forms, potential causes, and preferred targets. ''Journal of Management'', 24, 391–419.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
Obstructionism or policy of obstruction denotes the deliberate interference with the progress of a legislation by various means such as [[filibuster]]ing or slow walking which may depend on the respective parliamentary procedures.

===As political strategy===
Obstructionism can also take the form of widespread agreement to oppose policies from the other side of a political debate or dispute.

===Mass media===
In September 2010, [[Jon Stewart]] of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' announced the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]], an event dedicated to ending political obstructionism in [[United States|American]] [[mass media]].
{{quote|"We're looking for the people who think shouting is annoying, counterproductive, and terrible for your throat; who feel that the loudest voices shouldn't be the only ones that get heard; and who believe that the only time it's appropriate to draw a Hitler mustache on someone is when that person is actually Hitler. Or Charlie Chaplin in certain roles."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rallytorestoresanity.com/: Rally to Restore Sanity website – (September 18, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Tactics===
The most common tactic is the [[filibuster]] which consists of extending the debate upon a proposal in order to delay or completely prevent a vote on its passage. 

Another form of parliamentary obstruction practiced in the United States and other countries is called "slow walking". It specifically refers to the extremely slow speed with which legislators walk to the podium to cast their ballots. For example, in [[Japan]] this tactic is known as a "cow walk", and in Hawaii it's known as a "Devil's Gambit". Consequently, slow walking is also used as a synonym for obstructionism itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r107:S05JN2-0010: U.S. SENATE BUSINESS – (Senate – June 05, 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Famous obstructionists===
[[John O'Connor Power]], [[Joseph Gillis Biggar|Joe Biggar]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Movement for Reform – 1870–1914, © M.E. Collins 2004; The Educational Company (Edco)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Hugh O'Donnell]], and [[Charles Stewart Parnell]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]]; all were famous for making long speeches in the [[British House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Alvin Home Rule: An Irish History 1800—2000 p. 39-42, Phoenix Press (2003). {{ISBN|0-7538-1767-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Cardinal Cullen, 6 August 1877, The O'Donoghue, MP for County Kerry, denounced the obstruction policy: "It is Fenianism in a new form."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Cardinal Cullen from The O'Donoghue, 6 August 1877. Cardinal Cullen papers, Section 329/3&lt;/ref&gt; The tactic deadlocked legislation and 'the autumn Session of 1882 was entirely devoted to the reform of the Rules of Procedure with a view to facilitating the despatch of business.'&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor Power, John, The Anglo-Irish Quarrel: A Plea for Peace, 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Leslie Ward's "Spy" cartoon of John O'Connor Power appeared in ''Vanity Fair''{{'}}s "Men of the Day" series, 25 December 1886, and was captioned "the brains of Obstruction".

Two other famous obstructionists are [[Jesse Helms]] and Mme Flemington.&lt;ref&gt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article6234343&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Newt Gingrich]] brought obsturctionism to the United States Congress "crippling the congress" in an attempt to make the minority rule.  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenation.com/article/how-newt-gingrich-crippled-congress/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Boehner]] "chalks up his theatrical obstructionism to the reality of being minority leader" further developing obstructionist tactics. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/26/AR2010102607150.html?noredirect=on&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mitch McConnell]] has been accused of obstructionism for his tactics during the [[Obama administration]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/courts/news/2016/07/14/141210/mitch-mcconnell-a-legacy-of-obstruction/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chuck Schumer]] has been labeled as obstructionist for similar tactics during the current [[Trump administration]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/30/chuck-schumer-obstructionist-talking-out-both-side//&lt;/ref&gt;

{{linguistics}}
An '''orthography''' is a set of [[convention (norm)|conventions]] for [[writing]] a [[language]]. It includes norms of [[spelling]], [[hyphen]]ation, [[capitalization]], [[word|word breaks]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], and [[punctuation]].

Most significant languages in the modern era are written down, and for most such languages a standard orthography has been developed, often based on a [[standard language|standard variety]] of the language, and thus exhibiting less [[dialect]] variation than the spoken language. Sometimes there may be variation in a language's orthography, as between [[American and British English spelling differences|American and British spelling]] in the case of [[English orthography]]. In some languages orthography is regulated by [[List of language regulators|language academies]], although for many languages (including English) there are no such authorities, and orthography develops in a more organic way. Even in the latter languages, a significant amount of consensus arises [[natural language|naturally]], although a maximum of consistency or standardization occurs only when [[linguistic prescription|prescriptively]] imposed according to [[style guide]]s.

== Etymology and meaning ==
The English word ''orthography'' dates from the 15th century. It comes from the [[French language|French]] ''orthographie'', from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''orthographia'', which derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ὀρθός ''orthós'', "correct", and γράφειν ''gráphein'', "to write".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=orthography&amp;searchmode=none orthography], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthography is largely concerned with matters of [[spelling]], and in particular the relationship between [[phoneme]]s and [[grapheme]]s in a language.&lt;ref&gt;Seidenberg, Mark S. 1992. "Beyond Orthographic Depth in Reading: Equitable Division of Labor." In: Ram Frost &amp; Leonard Katz (eds.). ''Orthography, Phonology, Morphology, and Meaning'', pp. 85–118. Amsterdam: Elsevier, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, Mark. 2007. "Lexicography for Your Friends." In Terry Crowley, Jeff Siegel, &amp; Diana Eades (eds.). ''Language Description, History and Development: Linguistic Indulgence in Memory of Terry Crowley.'' pp. 395–406. Amsterdam: Benjamins, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt; Other elements that may be considered part of orthography include [[hyphen]]ation, [[capitalization]], [[word|word breaks]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], and [[punctuation]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulmas, Florian. 1996. ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems''. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Orthography thus describes or defines the set of symbols used in writing a language, and the rules regarding how to use those symbols.

Most [[natural language]]s developed as oral languages, and [[writing system]]s have usually been crafted or adapted as ways of representing the spoken language. The rules for doing this tend to become [[standardization|standardized]] for a given language, leading to the development of an orthography that is generally considered "correct". In [[linguistics]] the term ''orthography'' is often used to refer to any method of writing a language, without judgment as to right and wrong, with a scientific understanding that orthographic standardization exists on a spectrum of strength of convention. The original sense of the word, though, implies a dichotomy of correct and incorrect, and the word is still most often used to refer specifically to a thoroughly standardized, [[prescriptive linguistics|prescriptively]] correct, way of writing a language. A distinction may be made here between [[emic and etic|''etic'' and ''emic'']] viewpoints: the purely descriptive (etic) approach, which simply considers any system that is actually used—and the emic view, which takes account of language users' perceptions of correctness.

==Units and notation==
Orthographic units, such as letters of an [[alphabet]], are technically called [[grapheme]]s. These are a type of [[abstraction]], analogous to the [[phoneme]]s of spoken languages; different physical forms of written symbols are considered to represent the same grapheme if the differences between them are not significant for meaning. For example, different forms of the letter "b" are all considered to represent a single grapheme in the orthography of, say, English.
 
Graphemes or sequences of them are sometimes placed between angle brackets, as in {{angbr|b}} or {{angbr|back}}. This distinguishes them from phonemic transcription, which is placed between slashes ({{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/bæk/}}), and from [[phonetic transcription]], which is placed between square brackets ({{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[bæk]}}).

== Types ==
The [[writing systems]] on which orthographies are based can be divided into a number of types, depending on what type of unit each symbol serves to represent. The principal types are ''[[logogram|logographic]]'' (with symbols representing words or [[morpheme]]s), ''[[syllabary|syllabic]]'' (with symbols representing syllables), and ''[[alphabet]]ic'' (with symbols roughly representing [[phoneme]]s). Many writing systems combine features of more than one of these types, and a number of detailed classifications have been proposed. Japanese is an example of a language that can be written in all three: logographic [[kanji]], syllabic [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]], and alphabetic [[romaji]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koda|first1=Keiko|last2=Zehler|first2=Annette M.|title=Learning to Read Across Languages|date=Mar 3, 2008|publisher=Routledge|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Correspondence with pronunciation==
Orthographies that use [[alphabet]]s and [[syllabary|syllabaries]] are based on the principle that the written symbols ([[grapheme]]s) correspond to units of sound of the spoken language: [[phoneme]]s in the former case, and [[syllable]]s in the latter. However, in virtually all cases, this correspondence is not exact. Different languages' orthographies offer different degrees of correspondence between spelling and pronunciation. [[English orthography]], for example, is highly irregular, whereas the orthographies of languages such as [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] represent pronunciation much more faithfully, although the correspondence between letters and phonemes is still not exact. [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] orthographies are remarkably consistent: approximation of the principle "one letter per sound".

An orthography in which the correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are highly complex or inconsistent is called a ''[[deep orthography]]'' (or less formally, the language is said to have ''irregular spelling''). An orthography with relatively simple and consistent correspondences is called ''shallow'' (and the language has ''regular spelling'').

One of the main reasons for which spelling and pronunciation deviate is that [[sound change]]s taking place in the spoken language are not always reflected in the orthography, and hence spellings correspond to historical rather than present-day pronunciation. One consequence of this is that many spellings come to reflect a word's [[morphophonemic]] structure rather than its purely phonemic structure (for example, the English regular past tense [[morpheme]] is consistently spelled ''-ed'' in spite of its different pronunciations in various words). This is discussed further at {{slink|Phonemic orthography|Morphophonemic features}}.

The [[syllabary]] systems of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ([[hiragana]] and [[katakana]]) are examples of almost perfectly shallow orthographies—the kana correspond with almost perfect consistency to the spoken syllables, although with a few exceptions where symbols reflect historical or morphophonemic features: notably the use of ぢ ''ji'' and づ ''zu'' (rather than じ ''ji'' and ず ''zu'', their pronunciation in standard Tokyo dialect) when the character is a voicing of an underlying ち or つ (see [[rendaku]]), and the use of は, を, and へ to represent the sounds わ, お, and え, as relics of [[historical kana usage]].

The Korean ''[[hangul]]'' system was also originally an extremely shallow orthography, but as a representation of the modern language it frequently also reflects morphophonemic features.

For full discussion of degrees of correspondence between spelling and pronunciation in alphabetic orthographies, including reasons why such correspondence may break down, see [[Phonemic orthography]].

===Defective orthographies===
An orthography based on the principle that symbols correspond to phonemes may, in some cases, lack characters to represent all the phonemes or all the phonemic distinctions in the language. This is called a [[defective orthography]]. An example in English is the lack of any indication of [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. Another is the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''th'', which represents two different phonemes (as in ''then'' and ''thin''). A more systematic example is that of [[abjad]]s like the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] alphabets, in which the short vowels are normally left unwritten and must be inferred by the reader.

When an alphabet is borrowed from its original language for use with a new language—as has been done with the [[Latin alphabet]] for many languages, or Japanese [[Katakana]] for non-Japanese words—it often proves defective in representing the new language's phonemes. Sometimes this problem is addressed by the use of such devices as [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] (such as ''sh'' and ''ch'' in English, where pairs of letters represent single sounds), [[diacritic]]s (like the [[caron]] on the letters ''š'' and ''č'', which represent those same sounds in [[Czech language|Czech]]), or the addition of completely new symbols (as some languages have introduced the letter ''[[w]]'' to the Latin alphabet) or of symbols from another alphabet, such as the [[rune]] ''[[Thorn (letter)|þ]]'' in Icelandic.

After the classical period, Greek developed a lowercase letter system that introduced [[diacritic]] marks to enable foreigners to learn pronunciation and in some cases, grammatical features. However, as pronunciation of letters changed over time, the [[diacritic]] marks were reduced to representing the stressed syllable. In Modern Greek typesetting, this system has been simplified to only have a single accent to indicate which syllable is stressed.&lt;ref&gt;Bulley, Michael. 2011. "Spelling Reform: A Lesson from the Greeks". ''English Today'', 27(4), p. 71. {{doi|10.1017/S0266078411000575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phonetic reversal''' is the process of reversing the [[phonemes]] or [[Phone (phonetics)|phones]] of a [[word]] or [[phrase]]. When the reversal is identical to the original, the word or phrase is called a [[phonetic palindrome]]. Phonetic reversal is not entirely identical to [[backmasking]], which is specifically the reversal of [[recorded sound]]. This is because [[pronunciation]] in [[Speech communication|speech]] causes a reversed [[diphthong]] to sound different in either direction (e.g. ''eye'' {{IPA|[aɪ]}} becoming ''yah'' {{IPA|[jɑː]}}), or differently articulate a [[consonant]] depending on where it lies in a word, hence creating an imperfect reversal.

Backmasking involves not only the reversal of the order of phonemes or phones, but the reversal of the [[allophonic]] realizations of those phonemes. Strictly speaking, a reversal of phonemes will still result in allophones appropriate for the new position; for example, if a word with a final /t/ is reversed so that the /t/ is initial, the initial /t/ will be aspirated in line with the conventional allophonic patterns of [[English phonology]].

According to proponents of [[reverse speech]], phonetic reversal occurs unknowingly during normal speech.

==Examples==
*In the 1974 album ''[[Rock Bottom (album)|Rock Bottom]]'', the track ''Little Red Riding Hood Hit the Road'' presented the chord progression along with [[Robert Wyatt]]'s singing being both phonetically reversed at one middle point of the song, which turned the track's harmonics to be reversed from the beginning although Robert Wyatt restarted to sing normally, causing an original and disturbing effect.
*In 1982, John Wright of [[NoMeansNo]] sang phonetically reversed lyrics on the backing vocal to the "Rich Guns" track on the band's first album, ''Mama''.
*In the [[Film in 1984|1984]] [[American film]] ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'', lead character [[Wolfgang Mozart]] claims to [[Constanze Weber]] that "[in [[Salzburg]]] everything goes backwards". He then proceeds to deliver a series of phonetically reversed phrases, many of them vulgar, which she must guess by reversing them out loud.
*In the television drama ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', the [[Man from Another Place]]'s character's speech was phonetically reversed. 
*''[[The Simpsons]]'' used the technique to [[parody]] ''Twin Peaks'' in the episode "[[Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)]]".
*Singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist Jim Ure is better known by his phonetically reversed (first) name [[Midge Ure]].
*[[Kate Bush]] used phonetic reversal in her songs "Watching You Without Me" (1985) and "Leave it Open" (1982).
*The English rock band [[Radiohead]] used the effect on the song "Like Spinning Plates", released on their 2001 album [[Amnesiac (album)|''Amnesiac'']]. Singer [[Thom Yorke]] sang the lyrics backwards; this recording was in turn reversed to create "backwards-sounding" vocals.&lt;ref name="culturelab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturelab.co.uk/site/templates/issue1/radioazitem_culturelab_noflash.html|title=The A-Z of Radiohead|last=Eshun|first=Kodwo|year=2002|publisher=Culture Lab|accessdate=1 April 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010703111201/http://www.culturelab.co.uk/site/templates/issue1/radioazitem_culturelab_noflash.html|archivedate=3 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A specific recording of the phrase "In the mix" exists that is a phonetic palindrome, and is often used by [[Turntablist]] [[DJs]] for this reason.
*In the 2008 monster film ''[[Cloverfield]]'', after the credits, a broken sound recording can be heard of Rob saying "...help us...", as at the end, he and his girlfriend were trapped under a bridge. If reversed, it sounds like Rob saying "...it’s still alive..."
*In 2007, backwards speaking radio sensation "Backwards Dave" (David Klempfner) beat the Guinness World Record Holder, David Fuhrer aka "Mr Backwards" in a backwards-speaking competition live on Triple J.&lt;ref name="definatis"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHB71xAPaA8| title= Backwards Dave Vs Mr Backwards| accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Dave performed on ''Australia's Got Talent'' saying "Does Australia Have Talent?" in phonetic reversal.&lt;ref name="definations"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxcjKEslSKg| title= Backwards Dave on Australia's Got Talent| accessdate=2011-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Backwards Dave appeared on Channel 7's ''Sunrise'', an Australian TV show.&lt;ref name="definationss"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa8w5CB3TTg| title= Backwards Dave on Sunrise| accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*During the opening theme song for ''[[Gravity Falls]]'', a whisper is heard saying, "I'm still here." However, if one reverses it, it says, "Three Letters Back", which is a clue to the ending credits code. The whisper is changed to "Switch the A with Z" in Double Dipper, "26 Letters" in Bottomless Pit, "Key Vigenere" in Scary-Oke, and "Not What He Seems" in the episode with this title (while still using the Vigenere cipher).

In [[political philosophy]] and [[ethics]], '''political authority''' describes any of the moral principles legitimizing differences between individuals' [[rights]] and [[duties]] by virtue of their relationship with the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/authority/ |title=Authority |last=Christiano |first=Tom |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |date=19 March 2013 |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |access-date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political authority grants members of a [[government]] the [[right to rule]] over citizens using [[coercion]] if necessary (i.e., [[political legitimacy]]), while imposing an [[obligation]] for the citizens to obey government orders (i.e., political obligation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huemer |first=Michael |date=January 2013 |title=[[The Problem of Political Authority: An Examination of the Right to Coerce and the Duty to Obey]] |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=5–7 |isbn=978-1137281654 |author-link=Michael Huemer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central question in political philosophy is "To what extent is political authority legitimate?" Views range from political authority having no legitimacy ([[philosophical anarchism]]) to political authority being virtually unlimited in scope ([[totalitarianism]]).&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

 --&gt;{{DISPLAYTITLE:Politics of ''Harry Potter''}}
There are many published theories about the '''politics of the''' '''''Harry Potter''''' books by [[J. K. Rowling]], which range from them containing criticism of racism to anti-government sentiments. According to ''Inside Higher Ed'', doctoral theses have been devoted to the Harry Potter books.&lt;ref&gt;McLemee, Scott [http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/07/18/mclemee ''Pottering Around''] Inside Higher Ed, 18 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several university courses centred on analysis of the Potter series, including an upper division [[political science]] course.&lt;ref&gt;

''Time'' magazine noted the political and social aspects of Harry Potter in their 2007 [[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]] issue where Rowling placed third behind politicians [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Al Gore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gibbs |first=Nancy |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/1,28804,1690753_1695388_1695436,00.html |title=Time Magazine |work=Time |date=19 December 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912150656/www.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/1,28804,1690753_1695388_1695436,00.html |archivedate=12 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Harry Potter''{{'}}s potential social and political impact was called similar to the 19th-century phenomenon of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s popular, but critically maligned book, ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', which fuelled the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement leading up to the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.metrosantacruz.com/metro-santa-cruz/05.23.07/harry-potter-0721.html Readers Of the World, Unite: Metro Santa Cruz] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224001339/http://www.metrosantacruz.com/metro-santa-cruz/05.23.07/harry-potter-0721.html |date=24 December 2008 }}

When asked about the politics and message in ''Harry Potter'', Rowling explained, "I wanted Harry to leave our world and find exactly the same problems in the wizarding world. So you have the intent to impose a [[hierarchy]], you have [[bigotry]], and this notion of purity, which is this great fallacy, but it crops up all over the world. People like to think themselves superior and that if they can pride themselves in nothing else they can pride themselves on perceived purity. [...]. It wasn't really exclusively that. I think you can see in the [[Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] even before it's taken over, there are parallels to [[regime]]s we all know and love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edward |url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/10/20/j-k-rowling-at-carnegie-hall-reveals-dumbledore-is-gay-neville-marries-hannah-abbott-and-scores-more |title=J. K. Rowling at Carnegie Hall Reveals Dumbledore is Gay; Neville Marries Hannah Abbott, and Much More |publisher=The-leaky-cauldron.org |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said, "You should question authority and you should not assume that [[the establishment]] or [[News media|the press]] tells you all of the truth."&lt;ref&gt;

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' compared [[Neville Chamberlain]] to Rowling's [[Cornelius Fudge]], saying both were eager to help their constituents look the other way to avoid war. "Throughout the '30s, Chamberlain, fearing that Churchill was out for his job, conducted a campaign against his fellow Tory. Chamberlain tried evading war with Germany, and ridiculed Churchill as a 'warmonger'. He used ''[[The Times]]''—the government's house organ—to attack Churchill and suppress dispatches from abroad about the Nazis that would have vindicated him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Last | last=Jonathan | title=History according to Harry | date=15 July 2005 | url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB112139373085986556 | work =Wall Street Journal | pages =W.13 | accessdate =24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling confirmed Chamberlain was her inspiration in the Spanish newspaper magazine ''XLSemanal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=J.

Rowling also told the Dutch newspaper ''de Volkskrant'' that [[Voldemort]] was modeled on Hitler and Stalin, as a megalomaniac and paranoid figure, and that she was influenced by the Second World War, which is "anchored in all our minds": discussing Draco Malfoy, she claimed "Draco Malfoy does indeed stand for that type of boy. He wouldn’t have killed Dumbledore, he couldn’t. As long as things are imaginary, okay, but once it becomes reality, the thing becomes more difficult.", on the other hand, "No, that I gave him that light blonde hair is not because I wanted to make him into a scary Nazi. You give your characters the appearance that you find attractive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=New Interview with J. K.

==Education versus indoctrination==
''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' noted that the post-[[11 September 2001 attacks|9/11]] generation's "ideas about war, about leadership, about the dangers of consolidation of power and of dictatorship, about the importance of dissent, and about heroism and sacrifice, have been shaped at least in part by Rowling," and that their concept of [[freedom of speech]] has been influenced by Rowling's weathering of her books' routine challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20152943_20153269_20161218_27,00.html The Top 25 Entertainers of the year] Entertainment Weekly&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] joined in the political fray over Harry Potter character [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s outing by asking if it was part of a "gay agenda" to indoctrinate children. He called J. K. Rowling a [[wiktionary:provocateur|provocateur]] for telling fans about Dumbledore's sexuality after the books were written. His guest, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' Senior Editor Tina Jordan, called his "indoctrination" claims "a shallow argument", saying "indoctrination is a very strong word" because "we all know gay people, whether we know it or not."&lt;ref&gt;''The O'Reilly Factor'', Fox News Channel.  23 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly continued the following day saying that the real problem is Rowling is teaching "tolerance" and "parity for homosexuals with heterosexuals". His guest [[Dennis Miller]] said that tolerance was good and didn't think you could indoctrinate a child into being gay.&lt;ref&gt;''The O'Reilly Factor'', Fox News Channel.  24 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zenit News Agency|Zenit]], a news agency dedicated to promoting the message of the Catholic Church, accused Rowling of betraying her readers by disclosing Dumbledore's sexuality, and said Rowling is the wealthiest woman in Britain thanks to the lack of political, social or moral propaganda in her books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-20892?l=english |title=Benedict XVI's Pep Talk; A Potter Betrayal |publisher=Zenit.org |date=2 November 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331105044/http://www.zenit.org/article-20892?l=english |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of [[Human Life International]], an American-based Roman Catholic activist pro-life organisation, taking a negative view of the books and "their literary offspring", said that Harry Potter indoctrinates young souls in the language and mechanics of the [[occult]] and said that Rowling's portrayal of Dumbledore socialises if not indoctrinates young people into tolerance of gays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2007/nov/07110611.html |title=HLI Head Says Harry Potter Indoctrinates Young Souls in Language and Mechanics of Occult |publisher=Lifesite.net |date=6 November 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Berkeley Beacon]]'' said that one parent's perception of [[indoctrination]] is another's education, in their article, ''No Politics in Harry Potter'', which countered charges that Rowling promoted homosexuality in her books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.berkeleybeacon.com/media/storage/paper169/news/2007/11/01/Opinion/No.Politics.In.Harry.Potter-3072191.shtml|title=No politics in Harry Potter – Opinion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105084221/http://media.www.berkeleybeacon.com/media/storage/paper169/news/2007/11/01/Opinion/No.Politics.In.Harry.Potter-3072191.shtml|archivedate=5 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing the controversy, Rowling told the BBC that "Christian fundamentalists were never my base" and thought it ridiculous to question if a gay person could be a [[moral compass]] in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10473639"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10473639 |title=Rowling says goodbye to Potter with fairy tales |date=2 November 2007 |agency=[[Reuters]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the values and morality of her characters Draco and Dudley, Rowling explained that both were indoctrinated with their parents' beliefs. "The moment Draco got what he thought he wanted, to become a Death Eater, and given a mission by Lord Voldemort, as he did in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,'' reality finally hit him," Rowling said, because his dream was "so very different". She said that there was a real moral cowardice to Draco, but that he was not wholly bad.&lt;ref name="mtv.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1572399/20071019/story.jhtml |title=MTV |publisher=MTV |date=19 October 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racism, mistreatment of minorities and totalitarianism==

When asked about the theme of racism and if her books have changed how people think, Rowling said, "I do not think I am pessimistic but I think I am realistic about how much you can change deeply entrenched prejudice, so my feeling would be that if someone were a committed racist, possibly ''Harry Potter'' is not going to have an effect."&lt;ref name="raincoast"&gt;[http://www.raincoast.com/press-releases/2005/0718-hbp-press-conference.html Transcript of the Harry Potter Children's Press Conference Weekend] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018214907/http://www.raincoast.com/press-releases/2005/0718-hbp-press-conference.html |date=18 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in a post-''Deathly Hallows'' webchat about [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s future, Rowling said, "Hermione began her post-Hogwarts career at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures where she was instrumental in greatly improving life for house-elves and their ilk. She then moved to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement where she was a progressive voice who ensured the eradication of oppressive, pro-pureblood laws."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomsbury.com/jkrevent/ Webchat with J. K. Rowling, 30 July 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525033940/http://www.bloomsbury.com/jkrevent/ |date=25 May 2007 }} www.bloomsbury.com&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]'', Rowling responded to queries about metaphors in the books for [[ethnic cleansing]]: "Well, it is a political metaphor. But... I didn't sit down and think, &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;I want to recreate [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, in the—in the wizarding world. Because—although there are—quite consciously overtones of Nazi Germany, there are also associations with other political situations. So I can't really single one out."&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/20001720/page/4/ Harry Potter: The final chapter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014014450/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/20001720/page/4/ |date=14 October 2007 }}. MSNBC. Retrieved 9 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling also compared her character [[Voldemort]] to paranoid [[megalomania]]cs like [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=sue |url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/11/19/new-interview-with-j-k-rowling-for-release-of-dutch-edition-of-deathly-hallows |title=New Interview with J. K. Rowling for Release of Dutch Edition of "Deathly Hallows" |publisher=The Leaky Cauldron |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2007 book tour Rowling further discussed the topic, stating "It wasn't really exclusively that. I think you can see in the Ministry even before it's taken over, there are parallels to regimes we all know and love." She prefaced the remark, saying "People like to think themselves superior and that if they can pride themselves in nothing else they can pride themselves on perceived purity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edward |url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/10/20/j-k-rowling-at-carnegie-hall-reveals-dumbledore-is-gay-neville-marries-hannah-abbott-and-scores-more |title=The Leaky Cauldron |publisher=The Leaky Cauldron |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowling stated on her website that the ''Harry Potter'' phrases 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' compared to "some of the real charts the Nazis used to show what constituted 'Aryan' or 'Jewish' blood. I saw one in the Holocaust Museum in Washington when I had already devised the 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' definitions, and was chilled to notice the similarity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=58 J.

[[Christopher Hitchens]] noted in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the [[lightning discharge|lightning bolt]]—the shape of the scar which [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry]] received as a result of [[Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s curse, now considered to be [[emblem]]atic of the series—is also the symbol of Sir [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[British Union of Fascists]], a prominent group of Nazi sympathisers during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name = "Hitchens"&gt;Hitchens, Christopher. The Boy Who Lived, published 12 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis themselves, in their SS, [[Runic insignia of the Schutzstaffel|made use of the symbol too]]. In the same article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/books/review/Hitchens-t.html|title=Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J. K. Rowling - Books - Review|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|date=12 August 2007|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens noted that "The prejudice against bank-monopoly goblins is modeled more or less on anti-Semitism and the foul treatment of elves is meant to put us in mind of slavery".

J. K. Rowling mentions in an article that Mosley was married to [[Diana Mitford]], sister of her heroine, [[Jessica Mitford]]. Jessica, after whom Rowling named her daughter, never forgave Diana's Nazi sympathies.&lt;ref name="itgirl"&gt;J. K. Rowling: "The First It Girl." Sunday Telegraph&lt;/ref&gt; Oswald and Diana married in 1936, in the Berlin home of Nazi chief [[Joseph Goebbels]] with Adolf Hitler as a guest. J. K. Rowling also noted that Mitford's other sister [[Unity Mitford|Unity]], to whom Jessica was closest in youth, became an arch-fascist and favourite of Adolf Hitler's.&lt;ref name="itgirl" /&gt;

Jessica's story may have thus inspired a part of Harry's story: [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Black]] (analogue to Diana Mosley) married a Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy (Oswald Mosley). Her sister, [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] (Unity Mitford), was herself a Death Eater, and a favourite of Lord Voldemort (Adolf Hitler). [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]] (Jessica Mitford) married the Muggle-born [[Ted Tonks]] against her family's wishes (as Jessica eloped with her cousin [[Esmond Romilly]]) and was blasted out of the [[Black Family|family-tree tapestry]]. These parallels were noted in the American communist newspaper ''[[People's Weekly World]]''.&lt;ref name = "Albano" /&gt;

In an act commemorating [[the Holocaust]], actor [[Daniel Radcliffe]], whose mother is Jewish, donated his first pair of [[Harry Potter]] glasses to an art exhibition inspired by a famous World War II photo of a mangled mountain of spectacles of victims of ethnic cleansing. Radcliffe's ''Potter'' co-star [[Jason Isaacs]], who played [[Lucius Malfoy]] in the films, himself a Jewish Briton, was due to participate in the commemorations on National [[Holocaust Memorial Day]], leading a service at [[Liverpool]]'s Philharmonic Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/jewish-world-voldemort-s-sidekick-turns-jewish-psychiatrist-in-film-on-nazi-era-1.268520|title=Jewish World / Voldemort's Sidekick Turns Jewish Psychiatrist in Film on Nazi Era|first=The|last=Forward|date=31 January 2018|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aviva Chomsky]] (daughter of famed academic [[Noam Chomsky]]) in the ''[[Providence Journal]]'' suggests that ''Harry Potter'' is a parable on immigration rights, noting that US "immigration, citizenship and naturalization laws are based explicitly on discrimination on the basis of national origin. Where you were born, and what passport you carry, determine whether you have the right to come here, to visit, to work, or to live here."&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Aviva: [http://www.projo.com/opinion/contributors/content/CT_chomsky12_09-12-07_9L6TPDP.1544d8d.html Harry Potter and immigration].

==Evils of war==
On the ''Harry Potter'' series, Rowling said on her United States book tour in October 2007, "I very consciously wanted to show what is one of the great evils of war, which is that totally innocent people are slaughtered... Another great evil of war is that children lose their families."&lt;ref&gt;

==Progressive values and diversity==
''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine said in 2005, "Rowling adapts an inherently conservative genre for her own [[progressivism|progressive]] purposes. Her [[Hogwarts]] is [[secularism|secular]] and [[wiktionary:Sexual|sexual]] and multicultural and [[multiracial]] and even sort of [[multimedia]], with all those talking ghosts."&lt;ref name = "Großman"&gt;Grossman, Lev J. K. Rowling, Hogwarts and all Time, 17 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; To mark the French publication of ''Deathly Hallows'', prominent French center-left paper ''[[Libération|Liberation]]'' devoted the front cover and two more pages to answering the question "Why Harry Potter is of the Left".&lt;ref name="Harry Potter seen as left-wing hero"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-arts-harrypotter/harry-potter-seen-as-left-wing-hero-idUSL261941720071026|title=Harry Potter seen as left-wing hero|date=26 October 2007|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, responding to a question from a child about [[Dumbledore]]'s love life, Rowling revealed, "I always saw Dumbledore as gay." Filling in a few more details, she said, "Dumbledore fell in love with Grindelwald.... Don't forget, falling in love can blind us. [He] was very drawn to this brilliant person. This was Dumbledore's tragedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrett |first=Annie |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2007/10/rowling-outs-du.html |title=Entertainment Weekly |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=20 October 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melissa Anelli, webmaster of the fan site [[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]], told The Associated Press, "Jo Rowling calling any Harry Potter character gay would make wonderful strides in tolerance toward homosexuality.... By dubbing someone so respected, so talented and so kind, as someone who just happens to be also homosexual, she's reinforcing the idea that a person's gayness is not something of which they should be ashamed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21407911/ |title=MSNBC |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the ensuing controversy, Rowling said, "I know that it was a positive thing that I said it, for at least one person, because one man 'came out' at Carnegie Hall."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/269527 Rowling knew early on Dumbledore was gay] The Star&lt;/ref&gt; ''Entertainment Weekly''{{'}}s [[Mark Harris (journalist)|Mark Harris]] said "her choice to make a beloved professor-mentor gay in a world where gay teachers are still routinely slandered as malign influences was, I am certain, no accident." Harris also says that there is a drastic underrepresentation of gays in the population, and it is a failure of decency and nerve on the entertainment industry— "including the tremendous number of gay producers, writers, and executives who sacrifice their convictions so they don't look too ''strident'' or ''political.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris |first=Mark |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20154416,00.html |title=Dumbledore: A Lovely Outing |publisher=Ew.com |date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Think Progress]], a [[Progressivism|progressive]] news site, conservative blogs say{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}&lt;!---What is it now? Are conservative blogs saying this or is it TP saying that they say? If the former is correct, then report it, if not, it is a false claim and should be discarded.

Baggett, who coauthored the book ''Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts'', says he was taken aback not only by Rowling's announcement, but by the fact that it came on the heels of her confirming many Potter fans' belief that the series had Christian themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/bal-to.dumbledore23oct23,0,5228256.story |title=Albus Dumbledore cast in a new light |publisher=Baltimoresun.com |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830065623/http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/bal-to.dumbledore23oct23,0,5228256.story |archivedate=30 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Slate Magazine'' quotes an attendee of the book talk who said, "It was clear that JKR didn't plan to out Dumbledore. She just cares about being true to her readers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wickman |first=Forrest |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2176455/ |title=Bloggers on Stephen Colbert's presidential run. – By Laurel Wamsley – Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Thomas of the ''Orlando Sentinel'' said that upon reflection, Dumbledore was gay from the beginning, and that this neatly explains the behaviour of his character and his relationship with Grindelwald. Thomas notes the skill Rowling displays in writing a gay character without having to put a gay label on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_columnist_mikethomas/2007/10/so-dumbledore-i.html |title=So Dumbledore is Gay |publisher=Blogs.orlandosentinel.com |date=23 October 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522041646/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_columnist_mikethomas/2007/10/so-dumbledore-i.html |archivedate=22 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Reuters, Rowling was surprised over the fuss and declined to say whether her "outing" of Dumbledore might alienate those who disapprove of homosexuality. "It has certainly never been news to me that a brave and brilliant man could love other men. He is my character. He is what he is and I have the right to say what I say about him," she said. Reaction has been mainly supportive on fans' Web sites, such as [[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]] and [[MuggleNet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ian&amp;nbsp;Bremmer |url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&amp;storyID=2007-10-23T152444Z_01_N23210446_RTRUKOC_0_US-ARTS-ROWLING.xml&amp;pageNumber=0&amp;imageid=&amp;cap=&amp;sz=13&amp;WTModLoc=NewsArt-C1-ArticlePage2 |title=Dumbledore brave, brilliant; why not gay: Rowling |publisher=Today.reuters.com |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025041215/http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&amp;storyID=2007-10-23T152444Z_01_N23210446_RTRUKOC_0_US-ARTS-ROWLING.xml&amp;pageNumber=0&amp;imageid=&amp;cap=&amp;sz=13&amp;WTModLoc=NewsArt-C1-ArticlePage2 |archivedate=25 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[David Thewlis]] ([[Remus Lupin]]) said that he was surprised about Dumbledore's sexuality, because while he was filming ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' director [[Alfonso Cuarón]] had the idea that "Lupin was gay, and he described my character like a 'gay junkie'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=sue |url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/10/25/video-interview-with-david-thewlis-on-dumbledore-revelation-and-more |title=The Leaky Cauldron |publisher=The Leaky Cauldron |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic fantasy author Regina Doman wrote an essay titled "In Defense of Dumbledore", in which she argued that the books actually support Catholic teaching on homosexuality because Dumbledore's relationship with the dark wizard Grindelwald leads to obviously terrible results, as he becomes interested in dark magic himself, neglects his responsibilities towards his younger sister and ultimately causes her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Defense of Dumbledore|author=Regina Doman|work=therambleronline.com|year=2007|url=http://therambleronline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=181&amp;Itemid=1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224111126/http://therambleronline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=181&amp;Itemid=1|archivedate=24 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Florida ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]''{{'}}s book reviewer Chauncey Mabe says that it was wrong for Rowling to disclose Dumbledore's [[sexual orientation]]. Mabe was clear that this was not due to Dumbledore's being gay, but to his own objections to authors continuing to talk about their books after they are written. He called for Rowling to "please be quiet, please" in "public gatherings", which is contrary to the massive popularity of Rowling's book talks and her fans' thirst for more information about characters in the Harry Potter books. Mabe notes that 1,000 children attended the "reading" before they were given autographed books. Robin Berkowitz, ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'' Entertainment Editor says of Rowling's comments, and other revelations she might make about her characters "We don't need to know any of them to appreciate the books fully," "Don't ask, don't spell" a reference to the U.S. military's former policy on homosexuality, [[Don't ask, don't tell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/features/arts/offthepage/blog/2007/10/dont_ask_dont_spell_1.html |title=Don't ask, don't spell |publisher=Weblogs.sun-sentinel.com |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sentiments are mirrored by Jeffrey Weiss in his article, "Harry Potter and the author who wouldn't shut up", published in the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/DN-rowlingcolumn_1024gl.State.Edition1.2292bdc.html Harry Potter and the author who wouldn't shut up] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025084037/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/DN-rowlingcolumn_1024gl.State.Edition1.2292bdc.html |date=25 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Washington Post]]''{{'}}s Michael Gerson says "tolerance is one of the main themes of the Harry Potter books. In a marvelous social comparison, [[lycanthropy]] is treated as a kind of chronic disease, with [[werewolves]] subject to discrimination as if they had AIDS."&lt;ref name="Harry Potter's Secret"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/25/AR2007102502233.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 |title=Harry Potter's Secret |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2 April 2012 |first=Michael |last=Gerson |date=26 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social activism==
According to [[Philip Nel]] of [[Kansas State University]], the Potter series can be seen as "political novels that critique racism and racial superiority. Rowling, who worked for [[Amnesty International]], evokes her social activism through Hermione's passion for oppressed elves and the formation of her "Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/potter/2001-11-16-analysis.htm |title='Potter' inspires academic analysis |work=USA Today |date=16 November 2001 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dobby the house elf]] has been compared to the labour lawyer [[Dobby Walker]] who introduced Rowling's heroine, Jessica Mitford, to the [[Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;*Morag Traynor, Is Dobby a Communist?

Hermione is depicted as starting a campaign to emancipate the enslaved [[House elves]], using the methods of real-world campaigns on social and political issues such as badges with slogans. She persists in this campaigning also when it is considered quixotic even by her close friends and not much appreciated even by most of the House elves themselves. But in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', the campaign turns out to have had enormous unforeseen results, with House elves joining the struggle and making several indispensable contributions to Voldemort's final defeat and saving the main protagonists' lives. Rowling said in an early interview that Hermione and her political conscience about the rights of elves was fairly autobiographical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Evan | last=Solomon | title=J. K. Rowling Interview | date=13 July 2000 | url =http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0700-hottype-solomon.htm | work =CBCNewsWorld: Hot Type | accessdate =9 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subversive and anarchistic message==
Gerson of the ''Washington Post'' also described what he considered to be the very [[subversive]] nature of the Harry Potter books in the answer they offer to death. Voldemort believes that death must be mastered and "beaten". In contrast, Harry accepts the necessity of his own death for the sake of love. Gerson also suggests that some will ask the book series about tolerance also be a book series about religion. He answers that many others "believe – not in spite of their faith but because of it – that half-bloods, werewolves and others should be treated with kindness and fairness. Above all, believers are called to love, even at the highest cost."&lt;ref name="Harry Potter's Secret"/&gt;

In a 1999 interview with Rowling, ''[[The Guardian]] Unlimited''{{'}}s Joanna Carey said, "JK Rowling is every bit as witty and subversive as you'd expect. Rowling described her admiration of Jessica Mitford since age 14, her time at [[Exeter University]] "not quite the chance to be the 'radical' I planned", and said the later books dealing with Harry's hormones, and deaths would be unlike other children's series like the [[The Famous Five (novel series)|Famous Five]]. Carey suggested a parallel between Harry Potter and [[Prince Harry]] which Rowling laughs off saying a friend said never let the press make you discuss the [[royal family]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,3822242,00.html|title=Who doesn't know Harry?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Morone, a political science professor at [[Brown University]], wrote in the liberal ''[[American Prospect]]'' in 2001, "Magical headmaster Albus Dumbledore practically awards bonus points for breaking rules. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is unruly, even slightly anarchic. Harry's classmate Hermione 'had become a bit more relaxed about breaking the rules,' writes Rowling near the end of ''Philosopher's Stone'', 'and she was much nicer for it.' There's more than a touch of anarchy when all the students sing to their own tune. In her books, the kids are the central agents of their own lives. They make choices. Weigh judgments. Wrestle with freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=cultural_phenomena_dumbledores_message |title=Cultural Phenomena: Dumbledore's Message |publisher=Prospect.org |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isabelle Smadja of ''[[Le Monde]]'' wrote that Harry Potter is the first fictional hero of the anti-[[globalism|globalist]], anti-capitalist, pro-[[Third World]], "[[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|Seattle]]" generation. She wrote that "Examination of the text suggests that they are, in fact, a ferocious critique of [[consumerism|consumer society]] and the world of [[free enterprise]]."&lt;ref name = "Lichfield"&gt;[http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=132&amp;fArticleId=2138008 French go potty over Harry's politics], Lichfield, John.

==Conservative objections to liberal and socialist values==
The right-wing U.S. [[John Birch Society]] has objected to Rowling's books and her public statements. In his article for the John Birch Society's magazine ''The New American'', [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] Communications Director Steve Bonta compared ''Harry Potter'' negatively to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', saying, "The Potter books read in places like diatribes against the modern middle class, especially whenever Harry confronts his ludicrously dysfunctional and downright abusive adopted family, [[Dursley family|the Dursleys]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=[[Tolkien]]'s Timeless Tale |author= Steve Bonta |journal=The New American |date=28 January 2002 |volume=18 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of conservative and sexist themes==
The critic [[Anthony Holden]] wrote in ''[[The Observer]]'' on his experience of judging ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' for the [[1999 Whitbread Awards]]. His overall view of the series was very negative—"the Potter saga was essentially patronising, very conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly [[nostalgic]] for a bygone Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,335923,00.html|work=The Observer |title=Why Harry Potter doesn't cast a spell over me|date=25 June 2000 | location=London | first=Anthony | last=Holden | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' echoed this interpretation and stated that "despite all of the books' gestures to multiculturalism and gender equality, Harry Potter is a conservative; a paternalistic, One-Nation [[Tory]], perhaps, but a Tory nonetheless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Adams |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/18/harrypotter.jkjoannekathleenrowling |title=Quidditch quaintness |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2 April 2012 |location=London |date=18 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salon.com]] critic Christine Schoefer has also criticised the books as [[sexist]], claiming that the series presents a [[patriarchal]] world filled with stereotypes and adherence to "the conventional assumption that men do and should run the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Salon.com| url=http://archive.salon.com/books/feature/2000/01/13/potter/index.html| title=Harry Potter's girl trouble| first=Christine| last=Schoefer| accessdate=20 June 2006| date=12 January 2000| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705003943/http://archive.salon.com/books/feature/2000/01/13/potter/index.html| archivedate=5 July 2006| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an interviewer suggested her books portrayed a conservative world, Rowling replied, "So I'm told repeatedly. The two groups of people who are constantly thanking me are [[Wicca]]ns and [[boarding school]]s. And really, don't thank me. I'm not with either of them. [[New Age|New ageism]] leaves me completely cold, and [my daughter] would never go to boarding school. I went to a [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]]."&lt;ref name = "Hattenstone"&gt;Hattenstone, Simon. [http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0700-guardian-hattenstone.htm "Harry, Jessica and me"], The Guardian, 8 July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowling says she gets frustrated with the "conservative world thing". She made Hogwarts a boarding school so that action could happen in the middle of the night and to create a sense of community among the characters. Harry also reflects the modern world, she argues, in that he is [[mixed race]] — [[James Potter|his father]] being [[pure-blood (Harry Potter)|pure-blood]], [[Lily Potter|his mother]] being [[Blood purity (Harry Potter)#Muggle-born|Muggle-born]]."&lt;ref name = "Hattenstone" /&gt; She also says her feminist conscience is saved by [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], "who's the brightest character" and is a "very strong female character".&lt;ref name="O"&gt;[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/0101-oprah.html J. K. Rowling's Books That Made a Difference] ''O, The Oprah Magazine'' January 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neoliberal and capitalist values==
In an article published in prominent French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'', literary scholar Ilias Yocaris argued that ''Harry Potter'' "probably unintentionally ... appears as a summary of the social and educational aims of [[neoliberal]] capitalism." According to Yocaris' analysis, all life at [[Hogwarts]] is dominated by a culture of competition: "competition among students to be prefect; competition among [[Hogwarts houses]] to gain points; competition among sorcery schools to win the Triwizard tournament; and, ultimately, the bloody competition between the forces of Good and Evil." The [[free market]] plays a prominent and positive role, while the state (the [[Ministry of Magic]]) is presented as inefficient and bureaucratic. In this "pitiless jungle", education only aims to "give students an immediately exploitable practical knowledge that can help them in their battle to survive," while artistic subjects and social sciences are useless or absent. Yocaris concludes that "like [[Orwellian]] [[totalitarianism]], this capitalism tries to fashion not only the real world, but also the imagination of consumer-citizens," producing literature that suggests that no alternative is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DA153AF93BA25754C0A9629C8B63 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713175400/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DA153AF93BA25754C0A9629C8B63 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 July 2012 |title=Harry Potter, Market Wiz. |author=Yokaris, Ilias |work=New York Times |date=18 July 2004 |accessdate=2 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article published in ''[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]'', Michael Ostling also argued that the series depicts a modern capitalist and [[consumer society|consumerist]] society, where the role of [[gadget]]ry is played by magic.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Potter and the Disenchantment of the
World. By Michael Ostling. Journal of Contemporary Religion, Vol. 18, No. 1, 2003. pp. 3–23 [http://www.ic.arizona.edu/ic/soc3173/readings/OstlingPotter.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The article by Yocaris provoked the response by Isabelle Smadja cited previously.

==Class distinctions==
''[[O: The Oprah Magazine]]'' noted that Rowling admires [[Roddy Doyle]] and [[Jane Austen]], saying "both of whom write about class distinctions," and asked if the reason Rowling wrote about class was a conscious decision. Rowling replied, "kids are acutely aware of money—before they're aware of class. A kid isn't really going to notice how another kid holds his knife and fork. But a kid will be acutely aware that he doesn't have pocket money. Or that he doesn't have as much pocket money. I think back to myself at 11. Kids can be mean, very mean. So it was there in Ron not having the proper length robes, you know? And not being able to buy stuff on the trolley. He's got to have sandwiches his mum made for him, even though he doesn't like the sandwiches. Having enough money to fit in is an important facet of life—and what is more conformist than a school?"&lt;ref name="O" /&gt;

==Anti-government interpretation==
Some political commentators have seen J. K. Rowling's portrayal of the [[bureaucracy|bureaucratised]] Ministry of Magic and the oppressive measures taken by the Ministry in the later books (like making attendance at Hogwarts School compulsory and the "registration of [[Blood purity (Harry Potter)|Mudbloods]]" with the Ministry) as an allegory [[anti-statism|criticising the state]].&lt;ref&gt;

The ''[[People's Weekly World]]'', the newspaper of the [[Communist Party USA]], claims the books draw you "into the politics of the wizarding world—the 'Educational Decrees' from the toad-like Ministry of Magic representative, the high-level connections of 'war criminals' from the last rise of Voldemort, the {{sic|predjudice}} against 'mudbloods' and 'half-breeds.'" They suggest connections "to the world we live in, to the similarities and differences between the [[Cornelius Fudge|Fudge administration]] and the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]".&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Jennifer. ''People's Weekly World Newspaper'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211350/http://www.pww.org/article/view/3750/1/171/ "Harry Potter and the irresistible read"], 10 July 2003. Archived from [http://www.pww.org/article/view/3750/1/171/ the original] on 27 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Jean-Claude Milner claimed "Harry Potter is a war machine against the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]]ite-[[Tony Blair|Blair]]ist world and the 'American Way of Life'" in France's ''[[Libération]]''.&lt;ref name="Harry Potter seen as left-wing hero"/&gt;

[[University of Tennessee]] law professor Benjamin Barton discusses [[libertarianism|libertarian]] aspects of ''Harry Potter'' in his paper ''Harry Potter and the Half-Crazed Bureaucracy'', published in the ''[[Michigan Law Review]]''. Barton says, "Rowling's scathing portrait of government is surprisingly strident and effective. This is partly because her critique works on so many levels: the functions of government, the structure of government, and the bureaucrats who run the show. All three elements work together to depict a Ministry of Magic run by self-interested bureaucrats bent on increasing and protecting their power, often to the detriment of the public at large. In other words, Rowling creates a [[public interest|public-interest]] scholar's dream—or nightmare—government."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michiganlawreview.org/archive/104/6/Barton.pdf ''Harry Potter and the Half-Crazed Bureaucracy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810010003/http://www.michiganlawreview.org/archive/104/6/Barton.pdf |date=10 August 2007 }} Michigan Law Review&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowling describes the beloved wizard Dumbledore as [[Machiavellian]] and says "I wanted you to question Dumbledore. It is right to question him, because he was treating people like puppets, and he was asking Harry to do a job that most men twice his age wouldn't have been able to do."&lt;ref name="mtv.com"/&gt;

==Characters compared to George Bush, Tony Blair, and Saddam Hussein==
''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine asked [[Alfonso Cuarón]], director of the third film based on Rowling's ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' if the villainous wizard Voldemort still reminded him of [[George W. Bush]]. Cuarón confirmed, "In combination with [[Saddam]]. They both have selfish interests and are very much in love with power. Also, a disregard for the environment. A love for manipulating people. I read books four and five, and Fudge is similar to Tony Blair. He's the ultimate politician. He's in denial about many things. And everything is for the sake of his own persona, his own power. The way the Iraq thing was handled was not unlike the way Fudge handled affairs in book four."&lt;ref&gt;
*Pierce, Nev. Reel Life – 28 July 2003 BBC
*Carla Power and Devin Gordon, ''Caution: Wizard at Work.'' Newsweek magazine, 4 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Slate Magazine]]'' also says Rowling takes jabs at the Bush and Blair administrations suggesting the Ministry of Magic's security pamphlet recalls the much-scorned [[Operation TIPS]] (Terrorism Information and Prevention System). The author also suggests that [[Azkaban]], the wizard penitentiary, is a stand-in for [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]].&lt;ref name="osama"&gt;Turner, Julia When Harry Met Osama; Terrorism comes to Hogwarts. 20 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowling has never confirmed these interpretations in ''Harry Potter''; however, when the then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Gordon Brown]] once asked her to endorse the Labour Party while Tony Blair was Prime Minister, Rowling refused.&lt;ref name="accio-quote"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/0201-edwards-telegraph.html |title=2001 |publisher=Accio Quote! |date=18 February 2001 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling attacked the Blair government's policy on single parent families. She said that [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] could do "a good deal more" and then donated £500,000 to the One Parent Families charity to set an example.&lt;ref name="accio-quote" /&gt; Rowling said that Brown's measures for children 'would have made a real difference to my family's life' when she was poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/politics/story/0,,1879661,00.html |work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Who will have the last word? | date=24 September 2006 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair stepped down shortly before the release of Rowling's seventh book, and Brown was appointed Prime Minister. Rowling subsequently donated £1 million to the Labour Party during the 2010 general election which Labour lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jk-rowling-donates-pound1m-to-labour-936434.html|title=JK Rowling donates £1m to Labour|last=Woodcock|first=Andrew|date=20 September 2008|work=The Independent |accessdate=15 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education reform in ''The Order of the Phoenix''==
Teachers have hailed ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' as a "blistering satire on years of politically motivated interference in the running of schools".&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Stephen Rowling causes umbrage with her Umbridge... Scotsman&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowling describes her character [[Dolores Umbridge]], the Ministry-appointed headmistress of Hogwarts and under-secretary to the minister, Cornelius Fudge, saying "She has good contacts at the Ministry. She is one of those people, and they do exist in real life, who will always side with the established order. As far as she is concerned authority cannot be wrong so she doesn't question it, and I would go as far as to say that whatever happened and whoever took over at the Ministry, Umbridge would be there, she likes power. So she is going to side with the people who give her the authority."&lt;ref name="raincoast" /&gt;

Andrew Slack, founder of the [[Harry Potter Alliance]], says in ''[[In These Times]]'', "Harry Potter supersedes news about genocide, men assess their 'worth' by their paychecks, women's bodies are treated as commodities and our educational system preoccupies itself not with stimulating children's curiosity but rather getting them to efficiently regurgitate information on standardised tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Slack | title=Harry Potter and the Muggle Activists | date=26 October 2007 | url =http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3365/harry_potter_and_the_muggle_activists/ | work =In These Times | accessdate =20 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungarian Secretary of State for Education [[Rózsa Hoffmann]] and her reforms have often been compared to Dolores Umbridge and her actions in the novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hirszerzo.hu/velemeny/2011/3/10/20110310_vegre_fontos_dolgok|title=Végre a fontos dolgokkal foglalkoznak (nem)|author=Ceglédi Zoltán|date=10 March 2011|accessdate=22 August 2012|publisher=Hírszerző|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fóti Péter|url=http://www.foti-peter.hu/umbridge.html|date=June 2010|title=Professzor Umbridge céljai és eszközei|accessdate=22 August 2012|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogol.hu/comment.php?log=3830324|author=Scott J.

==Anti-terrorism==
The Capitalism Magazine website says that, "With a long-term war in progress and threats of further terrorist attacks on American soil," ''Harry Potter'' isn't mere escapism and "shows a world in which happiness can be achieved, villains can be defeated, and the means of success can be learned."&lt;ref&gt;Durante, Dianne. Thank You, Harry Potter! 22 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' magazine says that by ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', "Harry is embroiled in a borderless, semi-civil war with a shadowy, hidden leader whose existence the government ignored until disaster forced the issue and who is supported by a secret network of sleeper agents willing to resort to tactics of shocking cruelty. The kids who grew up on Harry Potter—you could call them [[Generation X|Generation Hex]]—are the kids who grew up with the pervasive threat of terrorism, and it's inevitable that on some level they'll make a connection between the two."&lt;ref name = "Großman" /&gt;

''Slate Magazine''{{'}}s Julia Turner compares ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' to the [[War on Terror]] in the context of the fight against [[Osama bin Laden]] saying Voldemort takes up terrorism by destroying bridges, murdering innocents, and forcing children to kill their elders. She also notes the parallels in the community's response saying [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]]'s shop makes a mint selling Shield Cloaks and the new [[Rufus Scrimgeour|Minister for Magic]] jails an innocent man, hoping to stave off panic and create the impression that he's taking action.&lt;ref name="osama" /&gt;

Rowling said "I've never thought, 'It's time for a post-9/11 Harry Potter book,' no. But what Voldemort does, in many senses, is terrorism, and that was quite clear in my mind before 9/11 happened.... but there are parallels, obviously. I think one of the times I felt the parallels was when I was writing about the arrest of [[Stan Shunpike]], you know? I always planned that these kinds of things would happen, but these have very powerful resonances, given that I believe, and many people believe, that there have been instances of persecution of people who did not deserve to be persecuted, even while we're attempting to find the people who have committed utter atrocities. These things just happen, it's human nature. There were some very startling parallels at the time I was writing it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Melissa | last=Anelli |author2=Emerson Spartz | title=The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet interview Joanne Kathleen Rowling: Part Two | date=15 July 2005 | url =http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-2.htm | work =The Leaky Cauldron | accessdate =9 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic [[Steven Fielding (political historian)|Steven Fielding]] argues in  ''A State of Play: British Politics on Screen, Stage and Page, from Anthony Trollope to The Thick of It'' that the changing portray of the Ministry of Magic – from incompetent to authoritarian – reflects Rowling's views on the [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;Fielding.

The site evolved into kidSPEAK!, a forum for children to tackle censorship in general, and to fight for Harry Potter specifically.

===The Harry Potter Alliance===
{{Main article|Harry Potter Alliance}}
Andrew Slack, an actor/comedian and Harry Potter aficionado, co-founded the [[Harry Potter Alliance]] to highlight the crisis in [[Sudan]] and social inequities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0707/5039.html |title=Harry Potter as a political force |publisher=Politico.com |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[In These Times]]'' featured Slack in 2007, in an article about [[Muggle]] Activists where Slack said, "The Harry Potter parallel to [[Darfur]] is simple: With both the Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet (the Wizarding World's mainstream news source) in denial that Voldemort has returned and evil is afoot, Harry and his underground rebel group, '[[Dumbledore's Army]],' work with the adult group, '[[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|The Order of the Phoenix]],' to awake the world. We in the Alliance seek to be Dumbledore's Army for the real world, working with anti-genocide organisations, such as 'Fidelity Out of Sudan' and the '[[Genocide Intervention Network]],' to wake our governments, corporations and media up to the fact that 'never again' means 'never again.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Slack |first=Andrew |url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3365/harry_potter_and_the_muggle_activists/ |title=Harry Potter and the Muggle Activists |publisher=Inthesetimes.com |date=26 October 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine asked about [[The Harry Potter Alliance]], Rowling said, "It's incredible, it's humbling, and it's uplifting to see people going out there and doing that in the name of your character. What did my books preach against throughout? Bigotry, violence, struggles for power, no matter what. All of these things are happening in Darfur. So they really couldn't have chosen a better cause."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gibbs |first=Nancy |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/1,28804,1690753_1695388_1695436,00.html |title=Time Magazine Person of the Year |work=Time |date=19 December 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912150656/www.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/1,28804,1690753_1695388_1695436,00.html |archivedate=12 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling awarded [[The Harry Potter Alliance]] a Fan Site Award in December 2007.

In February 2010, the HPA ran a massive fundraiser to support those in dire need after the tragic event of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti earthquake]]. Live webcasts were held in which celebrities (especially those a part of the Harry Potter Fandom) performed and encouraged viewers to donate money. Donations came through an auction that did not guarantee you the prize. Some items that were up for bid were: a signed set of the Harry Potter books, a guitar signed by actor [[Tom Felton]], handmade earrings from actress [[Evanna Lynch]], and a one thousand word story about whatever the winner wishes it to be written by [[Maureen Johnson]] and [[John Green (author)|John Green]]. The webcasts were rather successful, garnering over $125,000. The original plan of Helping Haiti Heal was to have three plane fulls of aid (each one dubbed: Harry, Hermione, and Ron) shipped off to Haiti. As of June the same year, five planes were sent to Haiti, Harry, Hermione, Ron, DFTBA (Don't Forget To Be Awesome) and the last being Dumbledore. On 28 June, there was a livestream video celebrating the landing of Dumbledore. Evanna Lynch was present at the stream and even answered questions asked by fans. [[Ophelia Dahl]], the daughter of the late British author [[Roald Dahl]] was also present since she worked with Partners in Health, who the Harry Potter Alliance teamed up with for Helping Haiti Heal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standwithhaiti.org/haiti/news-entry/our-partners-in-health-the-harry-potter-alliance-wizards-with-a-cause/ |title=Our partners in health: The Harry Potter Alliance, wizards with a cause &amp;#124; Partners In Health |publisher=Standwithhaiti.org |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, [[The Harry Potter Alliance]] had a campaign for people to send in their books to the Mississippi Delta which went to [[Rwanda]]. As of June, when the campaign ended, they donated over 40,000 books. In July 2010, The Harry Potter Alliance won $250,000 in the [[Chase Community Giving]] contest. The money will go towards literacy, LGBT rights, and online community building.

===Wal-Mart Watch===
{{Main article|Walmart Watch}}
Wal-Mart Watch uses parodies of Harry Potter to compare [[WalMart]] to Lord Voldemort and draws analogies between House elves and forced labour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://walmartwatch.com/potter/ Harry Potter and the Dark Lord WaldeMart].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stop Big Media===
Stop Big Media gained support from "Rocking Out Against Voldemedia", a compilation of ten original songs by ten Harry Potter-themed "Wizard Rock" bands. Andrew Slack and [[The Harry Potter Alliance]] compare [[media consolidation]] in the U.S. to the control of the Ministry of Magic over the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' in the ''Harry Potter'' books, saying "Once Voldemort took over every form of media in the Wizarding World, Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix formed an independent media movement called "Potterwatch". Now the HP Alliance and Wizard Rock have come together to fight for a Potterwatch movement in the real world to fight back against Big VoldeMedia from further pushing out local and foreign news, minority representation, and the right to a Free Press."&lt;ref&gt;

A worldwide campaign to "save Harry Potter from the clutches of the Coca-Cola Company" was launched by the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest.

'''Public humanities''' is the work of engaging diverse publics in reflecting on heritage, traditions, and history, and the relevance of the [[humanities]] to the current conditions of civic and cultural life. Public humanities is often practiced within federal, state, [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] and community-based cultural organizations that engage people in conversations, facilitate and present lectures, exhibitions, performances and other programs for the general public on topics such as history, philosophy, popular culture and the arts. 

Workers within the public humanities endeavor to create physical and virtual spaces where the public can engage in conversation, learning and reflection about issues and ideas.  Public humanities projects include exhibitions and programming related to historic preservation, oral history, archives, material culture, public art, cultural heritage, and cultural policy. The [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] notes that public humanities projects it has supported in the past include "interpretation at historic sites, television and radio productions, museum exhibitions, podcasts, short videos, digital games, websites, mobile apps, and other digital media."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neh.gov/divisions/public|title=Division of Public Programs|website=National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many practitioners of public humanities are invested in ensuring the [[accessibility]] and relevance of the humanities to the general public or [[community group]]s.

The American Council of Learned Societies' National Task Force on Scholarship and the Public Humanities suggests that the nature of public humanities work is to teach the public the findings of academic scholarship: it sees "scholarship and the public humanities not as two distinct spheres but as parts of a single process, the process of taking private insight, testing it, and turning it into public knowledge."&lt;ref name="Quay1989" /&gt; Others suggest a more balanced understanding of the ways in which history, heritage and culture are shared between the academy and the public, drawing on the notion of [[shared historical authority]].

Subfields of the public humanities include [[public history]], [[public sociology]], [[public folklore]], [[public anthropology]], [[public philosophy]], [[historic preservation]], [[museum studies]], [[museum education]], [[cultural heritage management]], [[community archaeology]], [[public art]], and [[public science]].

== Programs in Public Humanities ==
Several universities have established programs in the public humanities (or have otherwise expressed commitments to public humanities via the creation of centers, degrees, or certificate programs with investments in various forms of "public" work), including:

*[http://www.bishopg.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx Bishop Grosseteste University], Lincoln, UK, whose newly created [http://www.bishopg.ac.uk/study/courses/Pages/sociology.aspx BA Sociology degree] has deliberately been placed within a School of Humanities, and will be delivered by members of a research cluster wherein the idea of "public sociology" (i.e. a sociology that engages audiences beyond the academy in cultural, literary and sociology debate) is activeliy cultivated and fostered. 
*[[Brown University]], whose [http://www.brown.edu/Research/JNBC/index.html John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage] supports public humanities programs and offers a master's degree in public humanities. Brown's public humanities program emphasizes practice, balanced with theory and a ground in a field of study.
*[[Michigan State University]], whose [https://web.archive.org/web/20070612220838/http://www.cal.msu.edu/phc/index.php?phc Public Humanities Collaborative] "provides a gathering place, a commons, where faculty, students, and outreach professionals can collaborate with community groups to build strong campus-community partnerships and enhance public understanding of liberal arts for democracy."

*[[Rutgers University–Newark|Rutgers University-Newark]], whose Public Humanities track in the [https://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/graduate-program-american-studies/ma-program American Studies MA program] "is designed to ground students in the history, theory and methods of the public humanities, and in a foundation in nonprofit management, and bring it all together with project-based courses, an internship and capstone, preparing students for careers in cultural and community institutions."
*[[University of Michigan|University of Michigan - Ann Arbor]], whose [https://www.rackham.umich.edu/publicscholarship/ Rackham Program in Public Scholarship] supports students by facilitating collaborative scholarly and creative endeavors that engage communities and co-create public goods while enhancing graduate students’ professional development through grants, summer workshops, and semester-long learning initiatives
*[http://www.sheffield.ac.uk University of Sheffield, UK] The University of Sheffield, UK offers an *MA in Public Humanities] [http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/faculty/arts-and-humanities/interdisciplinary/ma/public-humanities] with pathways in [[Digital humanities]], Public Engagement and Cultural Heritage.. The course combined modules taught by experts in their field with project work with external partners and dissertation research
*[[University of Western Ontario]], where a new program called [http://www.uwo.ca/publichumanities/ The Public Humanities @ Western] "is "designed to enhance the Faculty of Arts and Humanities’ commitment to the promotion of innovative forms of publicly engaged knowledge creation, experiential learning, and campus-community collaboration."
*[[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], whose [http://www.humanities.wisc.edu/ Center for the Humanities] is the primary vehicle on the campus for interdisciplinary work in the humanities, has a public scholarship program, [http://humanities.wisc.edu/public-projects/public-humanities-exchange/about-public-humanities-exchange Public Humanities Exchange] that supports collaborative work between humanities grad students and the community.
*[[The Walter Chapin Simpson Center for the Humanities]] at the [[University of Washington]] offers a [http://depts.washington.edu/uwch/programs/curriculum/certificate-in-public-scholarship Certificate in Public Scholarship].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2861">'''Ramón Eduardo Ruiz''' (September 9, 1921 – July 6, 2010) was an American historian of [[Mexico]] and [[Latin America]].  He was the author of fifteen books on [[History of Mexico|Mexican]] and [[Latin American history]] and in 1998 he was awarded the US [[National Humanities Medal]].

Ruiz was born in [[San Diego, California]] as the son of a former member of the [[Mexican Navy]] who left that country during the [[Mexican revolution]].  He served as a Pacific [[B-29]] pilot in the [[Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]].  He earned his bachelor's degree from [[San Diego State University]] in 1947, his master's from [[Claremont Graduate University]] in 1948, and his doctorate from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1954. Ruiz taught at the [[University of Oregon]], [[Smith College]], and the [[University of California, San Diego]].

Born to a Mexican family living and working in the United States but never became an U.S citizen. He was very proud of his religion which made him take more interest in wanting to know about the Mexican border. He is the author of 15 books giving knowledge about Mexico and Latin America. When he released the Mexican Revolution in 1980 he caused a controversial issues standing at writing in the new republic it was the first statement by an American historian of Mexico that the real revolution was not a triumph of the people at large, but a long violent specifically bourgeois reform which crushed other popular upspring for the sake of better business. He also brought up the issue of the border such as the North American Free trade agreement and lurid accounts of Mexican drugs lords, killings, and political corruption. Ruiz argued the exchange of goods and services of the dynamics of border economics. Ramon was a civic and community activist, he was one of the early protestors of the Vietnam war and supported the late chicano leader, Cesar Chavez, in his efforts improve the lives and welfare of migrant from workers.

{{Other uses}}

'''Regulation''' is an abstract concept of management of [[complex systems]] according to a set of rules and trends. In [[systems theory]], these types of rules exist in various fields of [[biology]] and [[society]], but the term has slightly different meanings according to context. For example:
* in biology, [[gene regulation]] and [[metabolic regulation]] allow living organisms to adapt to their environment and maintain [[homeostasis]];
* in [[government]], typically regulation means stipulations of the [[delegated legislation]] which is drafted by [[subject-matter expert]]s to enforce a [[statutory instrument]] ([[primary legislation]]);
* in business,  [[industry self-regulation]] occurs through [[self-regulatory organization]]s and [[trade association]]s which allow industries to set and enforce rules with less government involvement; and,
* in psychology, [[self-regulation theory]] is the study of how individuals regulate their thoughts and behaviors to reach goals.

== Social ==

Regulation in the social, political, and economic domains can take many forms: [[law|legal]] restrictions promulgated by a [[government]] authority, contractual obligations (for example, contracts between insurers and their insureds&lt;ref&gt;Marcos Antonio Mendoza, "Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Risk Management Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions", 21 Conn. Ins. L.J. 53, (2014) http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2573253&lt;/ref&gt;), [[social control|social regulation]] (e.g. [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s), co-regulation, third-party regulation, certification, accreditation or market regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Faur, David, Regulation and Regulatory Governance, Jerusalem Papers in Regulation and Governance, No.1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[State (polity)|State]]-mandated regulation is government intervention in the private market in an attempt to implement [[policy]] and produce outcomes which might not otherwise occur,&lt;ref name="Orbach"&gt;Orbach, Barak, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2143385 What Is Regulation? 30 Yale Journal on Regulation Online] 1 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from consumer protection to faster growth or technological advancement. The regulations may prescribe or proscribe conduct ("command-and-control" regulation), calibrate incentives ("incentive" regulation), or change preferences ("preferences shaping" regulation). Common examples of regulation include controls on market entries, [[price]]s, [[wage]]s, [[development approvals]], [[pollution]] effects, [[employment]] for certain people in certain [[Industry|industries]], standards of production for certain [[good (economics)|good]]s, the military forces and [[Tertiary sector of industry|services]]. The [[economics]] of imposing or removing regulations relating to [[market (economics)|market]]s is analysed in [[regulatory economics]].

Power to regulate should include the power to enforce regulatory decisions. Monitoring is an important tool used by national regulatory authorities in carrying out the regulated activities.&lt;ref&gt;Eraldo Banovac. Monitoringgrundlagen der kroatischen Regulierungsbehörde für Energie. EW − das Magazin für die Energie Wirtschaft, Vol. 103, No. 1-2, 2004, pp. 14-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries (in particular the Scandinavian countries) industrial relations are to a very high degree regulated by the labour market parties themselves (self-regulation) in contrast to state regulation of minimum wages etc.&lt;ref&gt;Anders Kjellberg (2017) [http://portal.research.lu.se/ws/files/23904978/Kjellberg_FSNumhauserHenning_Self_Regulation_State_Regulation.pdf ”Self-regulation versus State Regulation in Swedish Industrial Relations”] In Mia Rönnmar and Jenny Julén Votinius (eds.) ''Festskrift till Ann Numhauser-Henning''. Lund: Juristförlaget i Lund 2017, pp. 357-383&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons===

{{weasel|date=March 2018}}
Regulations may create costs as well as benefits and may produce unintended reactivity effects, such as defensive practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|author2=Fischer, Michael Daniel |title=Reactivity and reactions to regulatory transparency in medicine, psychotherapy and counselling|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=1 February 2012|volume=74|issue=3|pages=289–296|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035|pmid=22104085|url=http://eureka.sbs.ox.ac.uk/4314/1/McGivern_G___Fischer_M_D__%282012%29_Reactivity_and_Reactions_to_Regulatory_Transparency_in_Medicine_Psychotherapy_and_Counselling_%28Authors%27_version%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficient regulations can be defined as those where total benefits exceed total costs.

Regulations can be advocated for a variety of reasons, including:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

*[[Market failure]]s - regulation due to inefficiency. Intervention due to what economists call [[market failure]].
**To constrain sellers' options in markets characterized by [[monopoly]]
**As a means to implement collective action, in order to provide [[public good]]s
**To assure adequate [[information]] in the market
**To mitigate undesirable [[externality|externalities]]
*Collective desires - regulation about collective desires or considered judgments on the part of a significant segment of [[society]]{{vague|date=February 2013}}
*Diverse experiences - regulation with a view of [[censorship|eliminating]] or [[sensitivity training|enhancing]] opportunities for the formation of diverse preferences and beliefs{{vague|date=February 2013}}
*Social subordination - regulation aimed to increase or reduce social subordination of various social groups{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
*[[Endogenous]] preferences - regulation intended to affect the development of certain preferences on an aggregate level{{vague|date=February 2013}}
*[[Professional conduct]] - the regulation of members of [[professional bodies]], either acting under [[statutory power|statutory]] or [[contractual powers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Harris |first= Brian |author2=Andrew Carnes |title= Disciplinary and Regulatory Proceedings |publisher= Jordans |date=February 2011 |isbn= 978-1-84661-270-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Interest group]] transfers - regulation that results from efforts by self-interest groups to redistribute wealth in their favor, which may be disguised as one or more of the justifications above.
The study of formal (legal or official) and informal (extra-legal or unofficial) regulation constitutes one of the central concerns of the [[sociology of law]].

=== History ===

Regulation of businesses existed in the [[ancient history|ancient]] early Egyptian, Indian, Greek, and Roman civilizations. Standardized weights and measures existed to an extent in the ancient world, and gold may have operated to some degree as an international currency. In China, a national currency system existed and paper currency was invented. Sophisticated law existed in [[Ancient Rome]]. In the European [[Early Middle Ages]], law and standardization declined with the Roman Empire, but regulation existed in the form of norms, customs, and privileges; this regulation was aided by the unified Christian identity and a sense of honor in regard to [[contract]]s.&lt;ref&gt;John Braithwaite, Péter Drahos. (2000). ''Global Business Regulation''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Beginning in the late 19th and 20th century, much of regulation in the United States was administered and enforced by [[regulatory agency|regulatory agencies]] which produced their own [[administrative law]] and procedures under the authority of statutes. Legislators created these agencies to allow experts in the industry to focus their attention on the issue. At the federal level, one of the earliest institutions was the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] which had its roots in earlier state-based regulatory commissions and agencies. Later agencies include the [[Federal Trade Commission]], [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], [[Civil Aeronautics Board]], and various other institutions. These institutions vary from industry to industry and at the federal and state level. Individual agencies do not necessarily have clear [[Enterprise life cycle|life-cycles]] or patterns of behavior, and they are influenced heavily by their leadership and staff as well as the [[organic law]] creating the agency. In the 1930s, lawmakers believed that unregulated business often led to injustice and inefficiency; in the 1960s and 1970s, concern shifted to [[regulatory capture]], which led to extremely detailed laws creating the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6839">'''''Sheilaism''''' is a shorthand term for an individual's system of religious belief which co-opts strands of multiple religions chosen by the individual usually without much theological consideration. The term derives from a woman named Sheila Larson, who is quoted by [[Robert N. Bellah]] et al. in their book ''Habits of the Heart'' as following her own "little voice" in a faith she calls "Sheilaism".{{sfn|Bellah|Madsen|Sullivan|Swidler|1985|p=221}}

==History==
In chapter 9 of their 1985 book ''Habits of the Heart'', [[Robert N. Bellah]], Richard Madsen, William M. Sullivan, [[Ann Swidler]], and Steven M. Tipton discuss how religion in America has moved from being highly public and unified, as it was in [[colonial New England]], to extremely private and diverse. To demonstrate the shift, they quote a young nurse, to whom they gave the name Sheila Larson:
{{quote|I believe in God. I'm not a religious fanatic. I can't remember the last time I went to church. My faith has carried me a long way. It's Sheilaism. Just my own little voice&amp;nbsp;... It's just try to love yourself and be gentle with yourself. You know, I guess, take care of each other. I think He would want us to take care of each other.}}

Bellah et al. suggest that Sheilaism creates the logical possibility "of over 220 million American religions, one for each of us," and they see Sheilaism as "a perfectly natural expression of current American religious life".{{sfn|Bellah|Madsen|Sullivan|Swidler|1985|p=221}} Oddrun M.&amp;nbsp;H. Bråten wrote:
{{quote|Radically individualistic religion like "Sheilaism" may seem very different from, for example, fundamentalist religion, which is also characteristic of our time, but they both emphasise personal religious experience (spirituality). "Sheilaism" is rooted in an attempt to transform external authority to internal meaning. Some may prefer to choose a religion of external authority (Bellah 1985: 235) for this purpose. That religion in principle is a choice, is a result of the religious freedom gained in the western world through [[secularization]]: a central trait of western modernity ([[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Taylor]] 2004: 185, Taylor 2007, see also chapter 2).{{sfn|Bråten|2013|p=171}}}}

The coinage quickly became a touchstone for [[sociology of religion|sociologists of religion]] who repeatedly reference it.{{sfn|Wood|2009|p=241}} One sociologist summed it up as "spiritual [[bricolage]]".{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|p=498}} Sheilaism even has worked its way into more mainstream culture.

The columnist Don Kahle concluded that Sheila "has a code of ethics, but it's no longer connected to a sacred text or an observing deity. It's personal&amp;nbsp;– and unpublished. Sheila abides by Sheilaism. Sheilaism is good for Sheila, but it doesn't build community. Nobody but Sheila knows what are the codes of Sheilaism. Often Sheila doesn't know herself until something 'doesn't feel right'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kahle |first=Don |date=26 October 2007 |title=Will Downtown Progress Be Thwarted? Blame Sheila |url=http://www.dksez.com/if-downtown-plan-gets-thwarted-blame-sheila/ |newspaper=The Register-Guard |location=Eugene, Oregon |page=A13 |issn=0739-8557 |access-date=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Bellah et al. saw Sheilaism as a form of self-absorption that caused a disaffiliation with communities. Their perspective was very much in line with the prevailing view of sociologists since the 1960s who saw such highly individualized religious experience as proof of a larger decline in the importance of religion in the United States as a whole.{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|p=498}} In later comments, Bellah summed up the problem with Sheilaism: "she has made the inner trip and hasn't come back out again, so to speak."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bellah |first=Robert |year=1986 |title=Habits of the Heart: Implications for Religion |url=http://www.robertbellah.com/lectures_5.htm |type=lecture |location=Hartford, Connecticut |publisher=Hartford Seminary |access-date=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural critic [[Hal Niedzviecki]] juxtaposes Sheilaism with Judyism, the joke religion created by comedian [[Judy Tenuta]]. Whereas Tenuta is poking fun at the idea of an individualist religion, even titling a book ''The Power of Judyism'', Niedzviecki laments the fact that Sheilaists take the idea seriously. "Sheilaism permeates our individualistic conformity and continues to demand that our institutions dramatically change to accept us as we want to be."{{sfn|Niedzviecki|2006|p=49}}

Recent scholarship has re-evaluated Sheilaism, noting that even those who claim a particular organized denomination and regularly attend church often have highly individualized perceptions of their faith.{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|p=500}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16399">[[File:Hendrick Goltzius, Dutch (active Haarlem) - Sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus (Without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus Would Freeze) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Hendrik Goltzius]], 1600&amp;ndash;03, the Philadelphia "pen painting"]]
[[File:Mikro020.jpg|thumb|''Mikrokosmos'' emblem book, 1579: "Venus is left shivering in front of a makeshift fire while Bacchus and Ceres wander away".&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus''', [[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Without [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Bacchus]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] freezes'',&lt;ref&gt;Or "grows cold" "chills" etc&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Liber]] was an alternative Roman name for Bacchus, as the older local wine god for Rome&lt;/ref&gt;  is a quotation from the Roman comedian [[Terence]] (c. 195/185 – c. 159 BC) that became a proverb in the [[Early Modern period]].  Its simplest level of meaning is that love needs food and wine to thrive.  It was sometimes shown in art, especially in the period 1550–1630, in [[Northern Mannerism]] in [[Prague]] and the [[Low Countries]], as well as by [[Rubens]].&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the concentration of images by the [[Haarlem Mannerists]] reflects the patronage of the powerful brewers of [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref&gt;Santos, especially p. 21 onwards&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proverb==
The phrase derives from Terence's comedy ''[[Eunuchus]]'', in which Chremes says to Pythias in the fifth scene of the fourth act (732), ''verbum hercle hoc verum erit "sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus"'' (That saying, "Without Ceres and [[Liber]], Venus freezes" is absolutely true!"). Thus the phrase was probably a well-known proverb at the time as well. Chremes makes use of it to declare how Pythias seems even more beautiful than usual to him during the rowdy partying after a large meal.&lt;ref&gt;Erasmus, 178&lt;/ref&gt; Liber, the son of Ceres and god of human prosperity (and also of wine), was later replaced with Bacchus. The phrase is found in a similar form in [[Cicero]],&lt;ref&gt;''Rhetorica ad Herennium'' 4.32.43&lt;/ref&gt; who quotes it as an example of the stylistic device of [[metonymy]].&lt;ref&gt;''De nat. deor.'' 2.23.60, cited after Gerd Hagenow: [http://www.rhm.uni-koeln.de/121/Hagenow.pdf ''Der nicht ausgekehrte Speisesaal''] (PDF; 3,5&amp;nbsp;MB), note 7&lt;/ref&gt; In later times it was universally attributed to Terence.

In the Middle Ages, [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] used it in his work, ''Dialogus miraculorum'' to warn against luxury and frivolty and to advocate an ascetic lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;''Dialogus miraculorum'' 112&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] quoted it in this sense as well, in a 1518 sermon against the [[Seven Deadly Sins]].&lt;ref&gt;WA 1,519&lt;/ref&gt; With the arrival of [[Renaissance humanism]], the proverb was included with a broader sense in various compilations, such as the ''[[Adagia]]'' of [[Erasmus]].&lt;ref&gt;Adagia 1297 = II.3.97&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest German use is in a compilation from Klagenfurt dating to 1468: ''An wein und brot Leidet Venus not'' (Without wine and bread, Venus is not in good stead).&lt;ref&gt;Singer, pp. 453f.&lt;/ref&gt; Further German variants include:
* ''Ohne Wein und Brot ist Venus tot.'' (Without wine and bread, Venus is dead)
* ''Ohn Speis und Trank ist Venus krank.'' (Without cheer and ale, Venus is frail)
* ''Ohne Kost und ohne Wein kann die Liebe nicht gedeihn.'' (Without food and without wine, love cannot shine)&lt;ref&gt;Publius Terentius Afer: ''Lustspiele'', translated by Christian Victor Kindervater. Leipzig: Frommann, 1799, p. 175 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=znw9AAAAcAAJ Digitised])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shakespeare]]'s line in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', "Dost thou think because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale", may be an inverted reference.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Twelfth Night]]'' 2.1.123, [[Sir Toby Belch]] to [[Malvolio]]; see Erasmus, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subject in art ==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Venus frigida (KMSKA).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Venus Frigida]]'', Rubens 1615, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp. Venus and Cupid are freezing, as a [[satyr]] arrives with a fruit bowl]]
Depictions in art divide into those showing Venus, typically with an accompanying [[Cupid]], either "freezing", without food and drink (or much in the way of clothing), or more comfortable when supplied with them, usually by the other gods in person.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter type is more common, but [[Bartholomeus Spranger]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] are among the artists who used both types.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218–219&lt;/ref&gt; Like the ''[[Feast of the Gods (art)|Feast of the Gods]]'', another subject popular among the Northern Mannerists, the subject offers the combination of a relatively obscure classical reference and the opportunity for plentiful nudity.  The subject appears in paintings, drawings and prints, and compositions are often copied between these media, and between artists.

Initially the depiction of this motif were closely tied to text and was found mostly in [[emblem book]]s, with the first appearance in the ''Picta poesis'' of 1552, by [[Barthélémy Aneau]].&lt;ref&gt;Santos, fig. 3, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Mikrokosmos'', an emblem book of 1579 by the Dutch poet [[Laurentius Haechtanus]] may be the first depiction of the shivering Venus, as Ceres and Bacchus walk away.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218&lt;/ref&gt;  The Latin text makes clear that the motif is to be understood as a warning against excessive feasting and drinking because they stimulate sexual desire.

''Explain, [[Cythera (island)|Cytheran]] Venus, and Cupid too:''
''Why do you warm your own feet, warm your own hands?''
''Perhaps because eloquent [[Iacchos]] is not helping you?''
''Isn't dusty Ceres around either?''
''Where sobriety reigns, harmful lust freezes''
''and no war is waged against the curier.''&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the moderate man&lt;/ref&gt;
''Wherever powerful drunkeness and excess reign,''
''the mother of adultery begins her ruthless war.''

[[File:Abraham Bloemaert Sine Baccho et Cenere friget Venus.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Bloemaert]], early 17th century]] 
The motif was especially favoured in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries in the Netherlands and in the circle of [[mannerist]] artists at the court of [[Emperor Rudolf II]] in [[Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinz, pp. 380–394&lt;/ref&gt;

Early examples of the motif as the subject of an independent painting are Spranger's pair of paintings of about 1590,&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, 126-129&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hans von Aachen]]'s ''Bacchus, Ceres und Amor'' (1598), all painted for Rudolf II.  The Spranger was turned into a print in Amsterdam in about 1597 by [[Jan Harmensz Muller]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1508822&amp;partId=1 British Museum], ''Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus'' (Without Bacchus and Ceres, Venus grows cold), object listing&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hendrik Goltzius]] produced at least 10 versions of the subject,&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 219&lt;/ref&gt; including a monumental work in the unusual technique of pen and limited colour on canvas, here highly effective (illustrated here).  This was also (probably) in Rudolf's collection, then in the royal collections of Sweden and England, and is now in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/85733.html Phildalephia  Museum of Art]; [http://articles.philly.com/1991-11-24/news/25768376_1_art-museum-engraving-european-art "The Picture That Spurred A Splendid Exhibition"], by Edward J. Sozanski, Inquirer Art Critic, November 24, 1991, philly.com (''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; A different work on the subject in the same technique is in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], which includes a self-portrait by Goltzius in the background.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/05/arts/art-view-in-those-days-it-paid-to-be-clever.html Review in ''New York Times''] of exhibition in Philadelphia in 1992; Santos, 34–35, fig. 28&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wtewael Sine Cerere.jpg|thumb|left| [[Cabinet painting]], about 1605, by [[Joachim Wtewael]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.pdf.N08404.html/f/3/N08404-3.pdf lot notes], [[Sotheby's]], New York. Sale "Important Old Master Paintings Including European Works of Art", 24 Jan 2008, Lot 3&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Especially in Goltzius' version, the undertones of danger and the moral point of the [[allegory]] are still clear, although the motif later moved far from a narrow moral message about personal moderation.&lt;ref&gt;Hinz, pp. 380–394&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the print versions carry the proverb text, which it was presumably felt needed stating for a wider public.  Reference to the motif is uncertain in some works, or groups of works,&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 20&lt;/ref&gt; but it is at least arguable that any combination of the three gods, with or without Amor, carries a reference to it, as there is no other context that brings this particular group together.  Two different sets of prints by Goltzius showed each of the three gods in turn; in one set, engraved by [[Jan Saenredam]], each is surrounded by worshippers.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 16–18, figs 8–10 and 15–17; Bull, 219&lt;/ref&gt; Two late paintings by [[Joachim Wtewael]] show half-length portraits of Bacchus and Ceres, and it is presumed that a Venus is missing to complete the set; another small painting by Wtewael shows the three gods, and Amor, together.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, J.; Helmus, L.  &amp; Wheelock Jr. A.  (2015) ''Pleasure and Piety: The Art of Joachim Wtewael'', last two entries, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|9780691166063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubens employed the motif repeatedly in different ways, including the visibly freezing ''[[Venus frigida]]'', a version with [[Cupid|Amor]] who desperately attempts to start a fire, and one with Venus at the ''Moment maßvollen Erwärmens und ruhigen Erwachens'' (Moment of modestly warming and quietly waking) in which she hesitantly accepts a wine cup from Bacchus.&lt;ref&gt;Hinz, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; Italian artists rarely depicted it, whether because it came from the mainly northern tradition of emblem books or because the subject had less resonance in a warmer climate.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 219&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions are a painting by [[Pietro Liberi]] and a print by [[Agostino Carracci]] after one by Goltzius.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1459994&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Sine+Cerere+et+Baccho+friget+Venus&amp;page=1 British Museum, object page]; Santos, fig. 5, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[baroque]] period the motif no longer appears often.

===Haarlem brewers' propaganda===
[[File:RubensVenusCupidBacchusandCeres.jpg|thumb|Rubens 1612/13, Staatliche Museen, [[Kassel]]]]
The [[Calvinist]] [[Dutch Republic]] had complex and conflicted attitudes to both sex and alcohol.  Several prominent painters had problems with drink, and the issues were discussed by the biographer and artist [[Karel van Mander]], as part of much wider discussions in Dutch culture.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, especially 21–28&lt;/ref&gt;  A paper of 2012 by R. de Mambro Santos discusses the motif in this context, and proposes that the depiction of the subject was greatly affected by the big brewers of [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref&gt;Santos, especially p. 21 onwards&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Santos, van Mander can be seen to connect excessive drinking with wine, while beer is presented in his writings and art as a safer and more wholesome product.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Bacchus, as by extension the god of all alcoholic drinks, and Ceres, as the goddess covering the raw materials, were symbolic of [[beer]], and a metaphor used by van Mander placed Venus and Cupid as representing the transformative process of actual brewing, by boiling the ingredients; the fire appearing in many images was a further necessity for brewing.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 30–36&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Santos, at the period when the subject is found in the art of the [[Haarlem Mannerists]], "the economic life of Haarlem was mainly based on the production of beer", and brewers dominated the government of the city, having "assumed the role previously played by the nobility as a leading group in the administration of the town".&lt;ref&gt;Santos, pp. 27–28, each quoted in turn&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Brouwershofje]],  an [[almshouse]] complex in the city, has more information on the Haarlem brewers' guild.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular Jan Mathijsz Ban was a leading brewer, a friend of artists and a significant collector, spending many weeks touring Italy with Goltzius.  With another brewer, he was the dedicatee of the central part of van Manders' ''[[Schilder-boeck]]''.  Van Mander praises the taste and knowledge of the Haarlem brewers at various points,&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; and "Both Van Mander’s text and Goltzius’ images present Bacchus as a sober, elegant divinity, a gentle and polite god not associated at all with excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages", contrary to much previous imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lord Byron==

[[Lord Byron]] expanded on the proverb in ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' Canto II, sections 169–170:
:''... some good lessons''
:''Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus''
:''Without whom Venus will not long attack us.''
:''While Venus fills the heart (without heart really''
:''Love, though good always, is not quite so good),''
:''Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli, &amp;ndash;''
:''For love must be sustain'd like flesh and blood, &amp;ndash;''
:''While Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly.''

'''Somali studies''' is the scholarly term for research concerning [[Somali people|Somalis]] and [[Greater Somalia]]. It consists of several disciplines such as [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]], [[historiography]] and [[archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;Somali Studies, by Lidwien Kapteijns, 1994  pg 581 - The Journal of African History, Vol. 35, No. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The field draws from old [[Somali literature|Somali chronicles]], records and oral literature, in addition to written accounts and traditions about Somalis from explorers and geographers in the [[Horn of Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. The Somali Studies International Association is the primary organization for Somalist scholars. ''Bildhaan'', ''Somali Studies'', ''Horn of Africa'' and the ''Anglo-Somali Society Journal'' likewise serve as the field's main periodicals. Since 1980, prominent Somalist scholars from around the world have also gathered annually to hold the ''International Congress of Somali Studies''.

==History==
The academic platform that would become Somali studies has its formal origins with religious, linguistic and historical research done by 18th and 19th century Somali [[scholar]]s, such as [[Uways al-Barawi]] and Shaykh Aidarus. However, Somalis since antiquity have exchanged ideas with polities in [[North Africa]], [[West Asia]], [[South Asia]] and as far as [[East Asia]]. Through early 20th century scholars like [[Osman Yusuf Kenadid]] and the polymath [[Musa Haji Ismail Galal]], other disciplines such as anthropology, sociology and archaeology would eventually form part of Somali studies.

Kenadid published many works on various subjects related to Somali history and science, including textbooks on the [[Somali language]], [[astronomy]], [[geography]] and Somali [[philosophy]]. He borrowed significantly from the vast ancient Somali cultural repository, working towards a renaissance of this rich past.&lt;ref name="Twotsl"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wasaaradda Warfaafinta iyo Hanuuninta Dadweynaha|title=The Writing of the Somali Language|year=1974|publisher=Ministry of Information and National Guidance|pages=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-GwAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galal later documented the Somali [[Astrology|astrological]], [[Meteorology|meteorological]] and [[Calendar|calendrical]] systems. He devoted two major works to traditional Somali science, ''The terminology and practice of Somali weather lore, astronomy, and astrology'' (1968) and ''Stars, seasons and weather in Somali pastoral traditions'' (1970), both of which are regarded as classics in Somali studies.

==Fields of study==
===Archaeology===
[[File:Sada mire.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Sada Mire]] Somali Archaeologist]]
One of the earliest examples of [[archaeology]] in Somalia can be traced back to the 19th century when [[George Revoil]] a [[French people|French]] [[explorer]] excavated several ancient sites in northern Somalia where he found large quantities of [[glass]] and [[pottery]], including [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Arab seafaring in the Indian Ocean in ancient and early medieval times By George Fadlo Hourani pg 138&lt;/ref&gt; After independence, Somali government officials in collaboration with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[British people|British]] archaeologists began excavating various parts of Somalia during the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Africa in Soviet studies - Page 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Azania Volumes XI by British Institute in Eastern Africa - History - 1975 Page 117&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1975, [[Neville Chittick]] led a British-Somali archaeological expedition in the northern half of Somalia. Financed by the Somali authorities, the reconnaissance mission found numerous examples of historical [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] and structures, including ancient coins, pottery, [[drystone]] buildings, [[cairn]]s, [[mosque]]s, walled [[Enclosure (archaeology)|enclosures]], [[standing stone]]s and [[Monument|platform monuments]]. Many of the finds were of pre-Islamic origin and associated with ancient settlements described by the 1st century ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', among other documents.&lt;ref name="Ncaaroth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chittick|first=Neville|title=An Archaeological Reconnaissance of the Horn: The British-Somali Expedition|year=1975|pages=117–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropology===
Somali anthropology studies the way of life of the Somali people. Somalist anthropologists have in various books and papers documented traditional Somali social systems such as the ancient [[Xeer]] ([[customary law]]) and the [[clan]] system, and examined their role within Somali society. In the field of [[Islam in Somalia|Somali Islamic studies]], scholars like [[I.M. Lewis]], [[Said Sheikh Samatar]] and [[Lee V. Cassanelli]] have written on the traditional Muslim structure of Somali society in books such as ''A Pastoral Democracy: A Study of Pastoralism and Politics Among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa'' (1961), ''Oral poetry and Somali nationalism: the case of [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan|Sayyid Mahammad 'Abdille Hasan]]'' (1982) and ''The Shaping of Somali Society: Reconstructing the History of a Pastoral People, 1600 to 1900'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;(Review) ''Oral poetry and Somali nationalism: the case of Sayyid Mahammad 'Abdille Hasan (1982) by John William Johnson pg 601 - Research in African Literatures, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enrico Cerulli]] and [[Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi]] in their respective works ''Somalia: scritti vari editi ed inediti'' (1957) and ''Culture and Customs of Somalia'' (2001) have also summarized the origins and [[ethnogenesis]] of the Somali people.

===Linguistics===
In terms of [[linguistics]], Somali studies examines the inter-relationships between the [[Somali language]] and other related [[Afro-Asiatic languages]]. Somali is by far the best documented language from the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of Afro-Asiatic,&lt;ref&gt;Agaw, Cushitic and Afroasiatic: the personal pronoun revisited by DL Appleyard  Journal of Semitic studies - Page 196&lt;/ref&gt; with academic studies of it dating from before 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/b14r67j54k377r7g/ A software tool for research in linguistics and lexicography: Application to Somali]&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists such as [[Bogumil Witalis Andrzejewski]], Giorgio Banti, Annarita Puglielli, Cabdalla Cumar Mansuur, [[Mohamed Haji Rabi]], [[Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi]] and [[Martin Orwin]] are considered among the foremost scholars on the study of the Somali language&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maanhadal.com/articles/The_Traveller.html The Traveller to Legendary Lands WardheerNews interview with Shiela Andrzejewski]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/13450393/The-Internet-Medium-and-Poetry-Transmission The Internet Medium and Poetry Transmission by Abdisalam M. Issa-Salwe]&lt;/ref&gt; and the relation it has to the tongues spoken by related neighboring ethnic groups, such as the [[Afar people|Afar]]s, [[Oromo people|Oromo]]s and [[Beja people|Beja]]s. Mustafa Abdullahi Feiruz also focuses on the standardization of written Somali, and Somali language's links with [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;Afmaal: Proceedings of the conference on the 40th anniversary of Somali Orthography. Djibouti, 17-21 December 2012; (ed) A M Ismail, A O Mansur&lt; Synab A. – page 49-60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.somalistudies.org/etc/final_program.pdf Somali Studies International Congress - Djibouti- Phase II - December 13th, 14th, 15th 2007]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
[[File:Cawoabdi1.jpg|thumb|right|Somali studies scholar Cawo Mohamed Abdi.]]The primary organization overseeing the field is the Somali Studies International Association.&lt;ref name="ICSS"&gt;Somali Studies International Association, ''Proceedings of the 1st International Congress of Somali Studies: held in Mogadishu, Somalia, 6–13 July 1980 : papers received, 20 January 1982'', (Scholars Press: 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journals==
*''Bildhaan'' - an international journal of Somali Studies
*''SOMALI STUDIES'' – A Peer-Reviewed Academic Journal for Somali Studies
*''Horn of Africa'' - an independent journal
*''Anglo-Somali Society Journal''

==Conferences==
Since its inaugural gathering in [[Mogadishu]] between July 6-13th, 1980, the ''International Congress of Somali Studies'' has been held to discuss developments in the field.&lt;ref name="ICSS"/&gt; The 10th Congress was held in [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti City]] in December 2007. The triennial ''Somali Studies Conference'' also brings together some scholars and specialists in Somali studies.

==Award ceremonies==
Since the early 1970s, the ''Academy of Somali Studies'' began to hold professional award-winning [[poetry]] competitions after having been inspired by the traditional poetry competitions annually held throughout Somalia. The ''Somali Studies Association'' recognizes Somali scholars whose work concerning Somali studies stands out with the ''Musa Galaal award'', a prize named after the Somali polymath [[Musa Haji Ismail Galal]]. In 1994, Charles L. Geshekter, Professor of History at [[California State University, Chico]], created an endowment for this award. Geshekter's mother and Musa Galaal (1914–1980) were friends. A financial prize is also awarded annually.

The '''Student politics of Bangladesh''' encompasses the activities and culture among [[Bangladesh]]i [[student]]s, mostly from the [[tertiary education|tertiary level of education]], as part of the support they demonstrate for [[political party|political parties]] at the national level.

== Current Situation ==
Student politics in Bangladesh is reactive, confrontational, and violent. [[Student organization]]s act as armaments of the political parties they are part of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The student wings of ruling parties run [[campus|campuses]] and [[residence hall]]s through [[crime]] and violence. They control access to amenities in residence halls, favoring fellow [[party member]]s and loyal pupils; eat for free from nearby [[restaurant]]s, and help themselves to products from shops nearby; practice [[extortion]]; and take money from [[freshman|freshmen]]. Further, they put pressure on [[teacher]]s for payment in exchange for supporting to school administration their hiring and [[tenure|retention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Tennessee Division of Archaeology''' (TDOA) is a division of the [[Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation]] responsible for managing prehistoric archaeological sites on lands owned by the U.S. state of [[Tennessee]], conducting archaeological excavations and research, informing the public about Tennessee’s prehistoric past, and coordinating with other state agencies regarding archaeological preservation issues.

The TDOA has two main divisions. The ''Technical Assistance Group'' is responsible for the protection of archaeological sites and artifacts on all lands owned or controlled by the state. This group also provides technical assistance for state agencies (including [[List_of_Tennessee_state_parks|State Parks]]), law enforcement, municipalities, development communities, and the general public. Assistance is offered to public and private entities on legal and technical aspects of prehistoric Native American cemetery relocation and related concerns. This group also conducts research and publishes reports on archaeological subjects, some of which are available for free download via the Division of Archaeology website.  ''The Site File and Review Group'' maintains accurate records on all known archaeological sites in the state, and coordinates with state agencies to assess impacts of proposed activities on known or suspected sites. This group also provides expertise to the [[Tennessee_Historical_Commission|State Historic Preservation Office]] by reviewing all federally funded projects within Tennessee to determine their impact on archaeological resources. The TDOA presently employs eight [[archaeologists]], a site files coordinator, and an administrative secretary at the Nashville location. An auxiliary storage facility is located at [[Pinson Mounds]] State Park near [[Jackson, Tennessee]].

Each January, the TDOA, in conjunction with the [[Middle Tennessee State University]] Department of Sociology and Anthropology, co-sponsors the ''Current Research in Tennessee Archaeology'' meeting. The meeting is open to the public and features presentations by both professional and avocational archaeologists.

'''''The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation''''', written by [[John M. Hobson]] in 2004, is a [[book]] that argues against the [[historical]] [[theory]] of the [[Great Divergence|rise of the West]] [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|after 1492]] as a "virgin birth",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hobson | first = John M. | title = The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 5 July 2004 | pages = 11, 102, 296 | isbn = 978-0-521-54724-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KQN85hrJyT4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rather as a product of Western interactions with more technically and socially advanced [[Eastern world|Eastern civilization]].

The text reinterprets [[Eurocentric]] ideas of Europe's contributions to world development. For example, it provides evidence that a complex system of [[global trade]] existed long before [[Mercantilism|Mercantilist Europe]], that social and economic theories in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] came from encounters with new cultures rather than with [[Renaissance|Greek and Roman heritage]], and that modern European hegemony resulted from situational advantages rather than from inherent superior traits.

==Key ideas==

* Many inventions critical to European progress were Chinese innovations.
* Europeans appropriated many Eastern resources such as land, labour and markets through imperialism.
* European powers did not create world trade, but rather used American silver to integrate into bustling Indian and Chinese markets.
* The belief that European hegemony derived from free trade, reasoned rule, and democracy is a patriotic myth. European powers won trading rights by force, and Britain developed the industrial revolution under harsh regulations.
* Cultural movements and ideas were spurred by contact with the outside world, particularly with the East.

==Response==

A reviewer for the Culture Mandala wrote Hobson's work "complements and builds on the insights of [[Andre Gunder Frank|Frank]], [[Fernand Braudel|Braudel]] and others to illustrate in great detail both how substantial China's historical achievement has been and how much the West has distorted history to serve the purpose of its imperial civilizing mission".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Little | first = Reg | title = Review of John M. Hobson The Eastern origins of Western civilization | journal = The Culture Mandala | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | date = December 2007 | url = http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cm/vol7/iss1/6/ | issn = 1322-6916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Hall of [[McGill University]], writing in the English Historical Review, claims that Hobson's work is prone to wild exaggerations and "tends to cite only those parts of an author’s work that agree with his argument, and misses out whole realms of scholarship". Hobson, Hall continues, "tends to give us bad sociology," and his construct of Eurocentrism is "often a straw man." Generally, Hall remarks that Hobson makes "odd claims," such as asserting that "[[Adam Smith]] depended upon Chinese intellectual discoveries". Hall claims that Hobson's "general picture seems to fail".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, John A. Review of &lt;u&gt;The Eastern Origins of Western Civilization&lt;/u&gt;. ''English Historical Review'', Vol CXIII No. 495, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Helvecia (2).JPG|right|thumb|270px|entrance of the tomb]]

The '''[[Thracian]] tomb "Helvetia"''' mound near [[Shipka (town)|Shipka]], [[Bulgaria]], was built in the middle of the 4th century BC.

== Construction ==

The walls of the tomb's entrance corridor are made of stone. After this corridor an antechamber is followed by a rectangular chamber with a unique covered ceiling. The ceiling is bent by the walls of both rooms, crossed by a horizontal zone. This marks the transition from the double-pitched, to the semi-cylindrical, ceiling of chambers in Thracian architecture. The floor of the tomb is plastered, and the walls of the antechamber and the other rooms were covered with a coating. Through the horizontal and vertical grooves, they were covered by large [[marble]] blocks. The chamber had a stone door that locked from the inside. Opposite the entrance, a ritual stone bed was located in the room. The last funeral that occurred in the antechamber is believed to be that of a [[horse]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2101">'''Tonadilla''' was a Spanish musical [[song]] form of theatrical origin; not danced. The genre was a type of short, satirical musical comedy popular in 18th-century [[Spain]], and later in [[Cuba]] and other Spanish colonial countries.

It originated as a song type, then dialogue for characters was written into the tonadilla, and it expanded into a miniature opera lasting from 10 to 20 minutes. It drew its personages from everyday life and included popular and folk music and dance, and [[vernacular]] language. The tonadilla also influenced the development of the [[zarzuela]], the characteristic form of Spanish musical drama or comedy.

The first tonadilla is ascribed to Luis Misson in 1757.&lt;ref&gt;The NATS bulletin: the official magazine of the National Association of Teachers of Singing (U.S.) - 1971 p41 "Four years after the establishment by Luis Misson of the tonadilla escenica in 1757, Pablo Esteve, a Catalan, came to Madrid and wrote his first tonadilla."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ethel Rose Peyser, Marion Bauer How opera grew: from ancient Greece to the present day- 1956  - Page 225 "They make a colorful basis for a national opera, like the tonadilla, invented in 1757 by Luis Misson of Madrid. The first tonadilla was a duet between the landlady and a needy Bohemian. All tell of simple scenes of popular life and are very ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Notable composers of tonadillas in Spain included [[Blas de Laserna]], [[Pablo Esteve]] and [[Jacinto Valledor]].

The tonadilla was particularly popular in [[Cuba]] where more than 200 stage tonadillas were sung between 1790 and 1814, the year in which they began to be displaced from [[Havana]] programs, finding new life in the Cuban provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945].

'''Tuscarora''', sometimes called '''Skarò˙rə̨ˀ''', is a Southern [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian language]] of the [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora people]], spoken in southern [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], North Carolina and northwestern [[New York (state)|New York]] around [[Niagara Falls]], in the [[United States]]. The historic homeland of the Tuscarora was in eastern [[North Carolina]], in and around the [[Goldsboro, North Carolina|Goldsboro]], [[Kinston, North Carolina|Kinston]], and [[Smithfield, North Carolina|Smithfield]] areas.  Some Tuscaroras still live in this region, having migrated to present day Robeson County, NC.  The name ''Tuscarora'' ({{IPAc-en|t|ʌ|s|k|ə|ˈ|r|ɔːr|ə}} {{respell|tus|kə|ROR|ə}})&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Tuscarora}}&lt;/ref&gt; means "hemp people," after the [[Indian hemp]] or [[milkweed]] which they use in many aspects of their society. ''Skarureh'' refers to the long shirt worn as part of the men's regalia, hence "long shirt people".

Tuscarora is a [[Endangered language|severely endangered]] language.  As of the mid-1970s, only about 52 people spoke the language on the [[Tuscarora Reservation, New York|Tuscarora Reservation]] ([[Lewiston, New York]]) and the [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation]] (near [[Brantford, Ontario]]). The [https://web.archive.org/web/20080210175746/http://www.nw.wnyric.org/tuscarora/tuscaroraschool/index.html Tuscarora School in Lewiston] has strived to keep the language alive, teaching children from pre-kindergarten to sixth grade.  However, the only native speakers are older adults.

The Tuscarora language can appear complex to those unfamiliar with it, more in terms of the [[grammar]] than the sound system.  Many ideas can be expressed in a single word.  Most words involve several components that must be considered before speaking (or writing).  It is written using mostly symbols from the [[Roman alphabet]], with some variations, additions, and [[diacritic]]s.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===

Tuscarora has four oral vowels, one nasal vowel, and no diphthongs.  The vowels can be either short or long, which makes a total of eight [[oral vowel]]s, {{IPA|/i ɛ a u iː ɛː aː uː/}}, and two [[nasal vowel]]s, {{IPA|/ə̃ ə̃ː/}}. Nasal vowels are indicated with an [[ogonek]], long vowels with a following colon, {{angbr| : }}, and {{IPA|/ɛ/}} (which may actually be {{IPA|[æ]}}) with {{angle bracket|e}}.
{| class="wikitable" style=text-align:center
|-
! 
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Central vowel|Central]]
! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| {{IPA|/i/ /iː/}}
| 
| {{IPA|/u/ /uː/}}
|-
! [[Open-mid vowel|Open-mid]]
| {{IPA|/ɛ/ /ɛː/}}
| {{IPA|/ə̃/ /ə̃ː/}}
| 
|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| {{IPA|/a/ /aː/}}
| 
| 
|}

The /ə̃/ is often rather written ''ę.''  Thus in the official writing system of Tuscarora, the vowels are ''a e i u ę.''

===Consonants===
The Tuscarora language has ten symbols representing consonants, including three stops ({{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, and {{IPA|/ʔ/}}), three fricatives ({{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/θ/}}, and {{IPA|/h/}}), a nasal ({{IPA|/n/}}), a rhotic ({{IPA|/ɾ/}}), and two glides ({{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}).  These last four can be grouped together under the category of resonants. (Mithun Williams, 1976)  The range of sounds, though, is more extensive, with palatalization, aspiration, and other variants of the sounds, that usually come when two sounds are set next to each other.

| '''w''' {{IPA|[w]}}
|
|}

There may also be the phonemes {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/f/}}, although they probably occur only in loan words&lt;!--anyone know?--&gt;. The phonemic consonant cluster {{IPA|/sj/}} is realized as a [[postalveolar]] fricative {{IPA|[ʃ]}}.

====Stops====
Tuscarora has three stops: {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/k/}}, and {{IPA|/ʔ/}}; in their most basic forms: {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[k]}}, and {{IPA|[ʔ]}}.  {{IPA|[kʷ]}} could be considered separate, although it is very similar to {{IPA|/k/+/w/}}, and can be counted as a variant phonetic realization of these two sounds.  Each sound has specific changes that take place when situated in certain positions.  These are among the phonetic (automatic) rules listed below.  Since, in certain cases, the sounds {{IPA|[ɡ]}} and {{IPA|[d]}} are realized, a more extended list of the stops would be {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[k]}}, {{IPA|[ɡ]}}, and {{IPA|[ʔ]}}.  In the written system, however, only ''t, k,'' and'' ′ ''are used.  {{IPA|/k/}} is aspirated when it directly precedes another {{IPA|/k/}}.

====Fricatives and affricates====
The language has two or three fricatives: {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/θ/}}, and {{IPA|/h/}}.  {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/θ/}} are distinguished only in some dialects of Tuscarora.&lt;ref&gt;A Grammar of Tuscarora, by Marianne Mithun Williams, VI.C.1.b&lt;/ref&gt; Both are pronounced {{IPA|[s]}}, but in some situations, {{IPA|/s/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ʃ]}}. {{IPA|/h/}} is generally {{IPA|[h]}}. There is an affricate is {{IPA|/ts/}}.{{fix|text=is this the same as the {{IPA|t͡ʃ}}?}}

====Resonants====
Resonants are {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/ɾ/}}, {{IPA|/w/}}, {{IPA|/j/}}.  A rule (below) specifies pre-aspiration under certain circumstances.  The resonants can also become voiceless fricatives (as specified below).  A voiceless {{IPA|/n/}} is described as "a silent movement of the tongue accompanied by an audible escape of breath through the nose."&lt;ref&gt;A Grammar of Tuscarora, by Marianne Mithun Williams, VI.C.1.c&lt;/ref&gt;  When {{IPA|/ɾ/}} becomes a voiceless fricative, it often sounds similar to {{IPA|/s/}}.

===Automatic rules===
*V = a vowel
*C = a consonant
*R = a resonant
*&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt; = the beginning or end of a word
*Ø = sound is dropped

{{IPA|/s/}} followed by {{IPA|/j/}} or sometimes {{IPA|/i/}} often becomes {{IPA|[ʃ]}}.

Used here is a type of [[linguistics|linguistic]] notation.  Aloud, the first bullet point would read, "{{IPA|/s/}} becomes {{IPA|[ʃ]}} when preceded by {{IPA|/t/}}."

==Morphology==
===Verbs===
The basic construction of a [[verb]] consists of
#Prepronominal Prefixes
#Pronominal Prefixes
#The Verb Base
#Aspect Suffixes
in that order.  All verbs contain at least a pronominal [[prefix]] and a verb base.

====Prepronominal prefixes====
These are the very first prefixes in a verb.  Prepronominal prefixes can indicate
*[[Grammatical tense|tense]]
*direction
*location
In addition, these can mark such distinctions as dualic, contrastive, partitive, and iterative.  According to [[Marianne Mithun|Marianne Mithun Williams]], it is possible to find some semantic similarities from the functions of prepronominal prefixes, but not such that each morpheme is completely explained in this way.

====Pronominal prefixes====
As it sounds, pronominal prefixes identify [[pronouns]] with regards to the verb, including person, number, and gender.  Since all [[verbs]] must have at least a subject, the pronominal prefixes identify the subject, and if the verb is [[transitive verb|transitive]], these prefixes also identify the object.  For example:

Tuscarora word: ''rà:weh''&lt;br&gt;
Translation: He is talking.&lt;br&gt;
Breakdown: masculine + 'talk' + serial&lt;br&gt;
The ''rà'' is the masculine pronominal prefix, indicating that a male person is the subject of the sentence.

On account of various changes in the evolution of the language, not all of the possible combinations of distinctions in person, number, and gender are made, and some pronominal prefixes or combinations thereof can represent several acceptable meanings.

====Verb base====
The verb base is, generally, exactly what it sounds like: it is the barest form of the verb.  This is a verb stem that consists solely of one verb root.

Verb stems can be made of more than just a verb root.  More complex stems are formed by adding modifiers.  Roots might be combined with many different kinds of [[morphemes]] to create complicated stems.  Possibilities include reflexive, inchoative, reversive, intensifier, and distributive morphemes, instrumental, causative, or dative case markers, and also incorporated noun stems.  The base may be further complicated by ambulative or purposive morphemes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Grammar Tuscarora'' by [[Marianne Mithun]] Williams&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aspect suffixes====
Aspect suffixes are temporal indicators, and are used with all [[indicative]] verbs.  "Aspect" is with respect to duration or frequency; "tense" is with respect to the point in time at which the verb's action takes place.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Three different aspects can be distinguished, and each distinguished aspect can be furthermore inflected for three different tenses.  These are, respectively, punctual, serial, or perfective, and past, future, or indefinite.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;!-- Punctual, serial, and perfective mean.... --&gt;

===Nouns===
[[Nouns]], like verbs, are composed of several parts.  These are, in this order:
#the pronominal prefix
#the noun stem
#the nominal suffix

Nouns can be divided two ways, formally and functionally, and four ways, into formal nouns, other functional nouns, possessive constructions, and attributive suffixes.

====Formal nouns====
=====Pronominal prefix and noun gender=====

The pronominal prefix is very much like that in verbs.  It refers to who or what is being identified.  The prefixes vary according to the gender, number, and "humanness" of the noun.  Genders include:
*Neuter
*Masculine Singular
*Feminine-Indefinite Human Singular
*Indefinite Human Dual
*Indefinite Human Plural
The prefixes are:
*Neuter
**ò-
**à:w-
*Masculine Singular
**ra-
**r-
*Feminine-Indefinite Human Singular
**e-
**ę́-
*Indefinite Human Dual Nouns
**neye-
*Indefinite Human Plural Nouns
**kaye-

=====Noun stem=====
Most stems are simple noun roots that are morphologically unanalyzable.  These can be referred to as "simplex stems."  More complex stems can be derived from verbs this is commonly done as: &lt;br&gt;
(verb stem) + (nominalizing morpheme).&lt;br&gt;
The process can be repeated multiple times, making more complex stems, but it is rarely the case that it is repeated too many times.

=====Nominal suffix=====
Most nouns end in the morpheme ''-eh''.  Some end in ''-aʔ'', ''-ęʔ'', or ''-ʔ''.

====Other nominals====
=====Other functional nominals=====

In addition to the formal nouns mentioned above, clauses, verbs, and unanalyzable particles can also be classified as nominals.  Clausal nominals are such things as sentential subjects and compliments.  Verbal nominals usually describe their referents.

Unanalyzable particles arise from three main sources which overlap somewhat.
*[[onomatopoeia]]
*onomatopoeia from other languages
*other languages
*verbal descriptions of referents
Onomatopoeia, from Tuscarora or other languages, is less common than other words from other languages or verbal descriptions that turned to nominals.  In many cases a pronominal prefix has dropped off, so that only the minimal stem remains.

=====Possessive constructions=====
Ownership is divided into [[alienable and inalienable possession]], each of which type has its own construction.  An example of inalienable possession would be someone's body part—this cannot be disputed.  An example of alienable possession would be a piece of paper held by someone.

=====Attributive suffixes=====
Attributive suffixes come in many forms:
*[[Adjective|Adjectival]]
*[[Locative]]
*Characterizer
*Populative
*Customary
*Intensifier
*Decessive
*[[Diminutives]]
*Augmentives

A [[diminutive]] indicates something smaller; an augmentive makes something bigger.  A simple example would be a diminutive suffix added to the word "cat" to form a word meaning "small cat."  A more abstract example would be the diminutive of "trumpet" forming "pipe."  Both diminutives and augmentives have suffixes that indicate both smallness and plurality.  A (certain) diminutive can be added to any functional nominal.  Augmentives usually combine with other morphemes, forming more specific stems.

Attributive suffixes can be added to any word that functions as a nominal, even if it is a verb or particle.

==Syntax==
===Word order===

The basic word order in Tuscarora is [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]] (subject–verb–object), but this can vary somewhat and still form grammatical sentences, depending on who the agents and patients are. For example:&lt;ref&gt;''A Grammar of Tuscarora'' by Marianne Mithun (Williams)&lt;/ref&gt;
If two nouns of the same relative "status" are together in a sentence, the SVO word order is followed.  Such is the case, for example, in a Noun-Predicate-Noun sentence in which both nouns are [[grammatical person|third person]] [[Zoic (linguistics)|zoic]] (non-human) singular.  If one is of a "superior" status, it can be indicated by a pronominal prefix, such as ''hra'', and as such SVO, VSO, ''and'' OSV are all grammatically correct.  The example given in ''Grammar Tuscarora'' is:
*SVO
wí:rę:n wahrákęʔ tsi:r&lt;br&gt;
(William he-saw-it dog.)
*VSO
wahrákęʔ wí:rę:n tsi:r&lt;br&gt;
(he-saw-it William dog.)
*OSV
tsi:r wí:rę:n wahrákęʔ &lt;br&gt;
(dog William he-saw-it.)

In all cases, the translation is "William saw a dog."  [[Marianne Mithun|Mithun]] writes:
"[I]t is necessary but not sufficient to consider the syntactic [[case role]]s of major constituents.  In fact, the order of sentence elements is describable in terms of ''functional deviation from a syntactically defined basic order''." (Emphasis added.)

A sentence that is ambiguous on basis of its containing too many ambiguous arguments is:&lt;br&gt;
tsya:ts wahrá:nę:t kę:tsyęh&lt;br&gt;
George he-fed-it fish&lt;br&gt;
This could be translated either as "George fed the fish" or "George fed it fish."

===Case===

Tuscarora appears to be a [[nominative-accusative language]].
Tuscarora has a [[Grammatical case|case]] system in which syntactic case is indicated in the verb.  The main verb of the sentence can indicate, for example, "[[aorist]]+[[Grammatical person|1st-person]]+objective+human+'[[Transitive verb|transitive-verb]]'+punctual+[[Dative case|dative]]."  (In this case, a sentence could be a single word long, as below in Noun Incorporation.) [[Objective case|Objective]] and [[Dative case|dative]] are indicated by [[morpheme]]s.

===Noun incorporation===

Tuscarora definitely incorporates nouns into verbs, as is evident from many examples on this page.  This is typical of a [[polysynthetic language]].  In Tuscarora, one long verb can be an entire sentence, including subject and object.  In fact, theoretically any number of arguments could be incorporated into a verb.  It is done by raising nominals realized as noun stems.  Datives are not incorporated.

Examples are as follows:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
'''''nękheyaʔtsiʔrá:’nihr'''''&lt;br&gt;
Breakdown:
n + ę + k + h + ey + aʔ + tsiʔr + aʔn + ihr&lt;br&gt;
dualic + future + 1st-person + objective + human + reflexive + 'fire' + 'set'&lt;br&gt;
Translation: ''I'll set my fire on him.'' or ''I'll sting him.''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''''waʔkhetaʔnaratyáʔthahθ'''''&lt;br&gt;
Breakdown: waʔ + k + h + e + taʔnar + a + tyáʔt + hahθ &lt;br&gt;
aorist + 1st-person + objective + human + 'bread' + joiner + 'buy' + dative-punctual &lt;br&gt;
Translation: ''I bought her some bread.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''''yoʔnaʔtshárhę''''' &lt;br&gt;
Breakdown: yo + ʔn-aʔ-tshár + h + ę &lt;br&gt;
non-human-objective + 'door' + 'cover' + perfective &lt;br&gt;
Translation: ''The door is closed.''

==Relations==
Tuscarora is a Northern Iroquoian language.  This branch of Iroquois includes [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], [[Oneida language|Oneida]], [[Onondaga language|Onondaga]], [[Seneca language|Seneca]], and [[Cayuga language|Cayuga]] along with Tuscarora and its historic neighbor,  [[Nottoway Tribe#Language|Nottoway]].   

[[Wallace Chafe]] posits that a larger language, reconstructed as "[[Proto-Northern-Iroquois]]," broke off into "[[Proto-Tuscarora-Cayuga]]," and then broke off onto its own, having no further contact with Cayuga or any of the others.&lt;ref&gt;Chafe, Wallace. "How To Say They Drank In Iroquois". ''Extending the Rafters: Interdisciplinary Approaches To Iroquoian Studies'', ch. 17. State University of New York Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, Lounsbury (1961:17) classed Tuscarora, along with Laurentian, Huron-Wyandot, and Cherokee as the "peripheral" Iroquoian languages &amp;mdash; in distinction to the five "inner languages" of the Iroquois proper.  Blair Rudes, who did extensive scholarship on Tuscarora and wrote a Tuscarora Dictionary, concurred with Lounsbury, adding Nottoway and Susquehannock (which Lounsbury ignored in his comparisons) to the list of "peripheral" Iroquoian languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rudes |first1=Blair A. |title=A Sketch of the Nottoway Language from a Historical-Comparative Perspective |journal=International Journal of American Linguistics |date=January 1981 |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=27–49 |doi=10.1086/465672}}&lt;/ref&gt;
