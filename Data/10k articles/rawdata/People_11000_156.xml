'''Akena p'Ojok''' is a former influential [[Uganda]]n politician who held various government positions in the 1980s, including Minister of Power, Posts and Telecommunications. He was a prominent figure of [[Uganda National Liberation Front|Uganda National Liberation Front/Army]] that helped remove [[Idi Amin]] and was involved in the power struggles that followed.

P'Ojok, an ethnic [[Acholi]], was born in Pupwonya, a rural community near [[Atiak]] trading centre in [[Kilak County]], [[Amuru District]].

During the rule of Idi Amin, p'Ojok fled to [[Kenya]], settling in [[Nairobi]], where he became the chief engineer of the Kenyan Electricity Utility company.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Together with [[Yonna Kanyomozi]], [[Ephraim Kamuntu]], [[Richard Kaijuka]] and other prominent Ugandans living in exile, p'Ojok founded the [[Save Uganda Movement]] (SUM), one of the anti-Idi Amin organizations that subsequently united under the banner of [[Uganda National Liberation Front]] (UNLF) with groups having a reciprocal aim who, together with [[Tanzania]]n armed forces, removed Idi Amin in 1979.

During the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]], p'Ojok was the Vice Chairman of the military coalition that composed to form the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA, the military faction of UNLF) and [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]], which resulted in Amin's overthrow. He later became the Vice President of UNLF,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} which ''de facto'' ruled Uganda immediately after Idi Amin. Akena p'Ojok was chosen to become the [[President of Uganda]] after [[Yusuf Lule]] (who was President after Idi Amin) however, following [[The Moshi Conference]], [[Godfrey Binaisa]] was instead appointed as President.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

When political parties were being formed in preparation for the [[Elections in Uganda#General elections December 1980|1980 General Elections]], p'Ojok vied for leadership of [[Uganda Patriotic Movement]] (UPM),{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} but [[Yoweri Museveni]] was instead chosen for the post. Akena p'Ojok then joined [[Uganda People's Congress]] (UPC), and became [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Gulu]] West Constituency, having beaten his main competitor, [[Anthony Ochaya]] of the [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party]]. Uganda People's Congress won the elections (which were largely believed to have been rigged). Akena p'Ojok became the Minister of Power Posts and Telecommunications, and later held various positions as [[Minister (government)|Cabinet Minister]] in the government of UPC's [[Milton Obote]].

In 1985, Obote's government was deposed in a coup led by [[Tito Okello]] and [[Bazilio Olara-Okello]]. In 1986, in the aftermath of the chaos which followed the coup, Yoweri Museveni's [[National Resistance Army]], which had been fighting against Obote's government for six years, seized power. P'Ojok declined several personal offers from Museveni to join his government{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and in 1987 was arrested and charged with treason for allegedly amassing weapons to overthrow the government. There is no record of his being found guilty of the charges, but he was sent to prison. In 1990 he was released by presidential [[pardon]] of Museveni, after which he left Uganda and settled in the [[United Kingdom]].

In early 2005 a congregation of [[Acholi]] elders approached p'Ojok and asked him to represent the Acholi in [[Uganda People's Congress]], an offer which he declined.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Since the 1990s, p'Ojok has lived with his wife and children on the outskirts of [[London]].

'''Arnail François''', [[marquis]] '''de Jaucourt''', ''[[Count of the Empire|comte]] de l'Empire'' (14 November 1757{{snd}}5 February 1852) was a French [[French nobility|aristocrat]] and politician.

==Biography==

===Military career and Revolution===
Jaucourt was born in Tournon ([[Seine-et-Marne]]) of a [[Protestant]] family, protected by [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé]], whose [[Dragoon]] [[regiment]] he entered at the age of fifteen. He became [[colonel]] of his regiment, and made himself known for his welcoming of the [[French Revolution]] and his affiliation with the [[Feuillant (political group)|Feuillants]].

A deputy to the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] in 1791, elected by the ''[[Départment in France|départment]]'' of Seine-et-Marne, he generally voted with the minority. As his views came to be considered too moderate by his colleagues, he resigned in 1792, and was soon after arrested on suspicion of being a [[reactionary]]. [[Anne Louise Germaine de Staël|Madame de Staël]] obtained his release from [[Louis Pierre Manuel]] just before the [[September Massacres]]. He subsequently accompanied [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]] on his mission to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], returning to France after the execution of [[List of French monarchs|King]] [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Jaucourt, Arnail François, Marquis de|volume=15|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consulate and First Empire===
Jaucourt took refuge in [[Switzerland]] to escape the [[Reign of Terror]], and returned only after [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s [[18 Brumaire|18 Brumaire coup]] and the establishment of the [[French Consulate]], entering the [[tribunate]], of which he was the president for a short period.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1803, Jaucourt entered the [[Senate of France|French Senate]], and next year, upon the establishment of the [[First French Empire|First Empire]], he became attached to the household of [[Joseph Bonaparte]]. He accompanied Joseph to the [[Kingdom of Naples]], and was created a [[count]] of the Empire by Napoleon.

===Restoration, July Monarchy, and later years===
During the following years, Jaucourt distanced himself from the imperial cause, and, with the [[Bourbon Restoration]] he became [[Minister of State]] and a [[Peerage of France|Peer of France]]. After the outcome of the [[Hundred Days]] (during which he stood by [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]), he was [[List of Naval Ministers of France|Naval Minister]] in July–September 1815, but held no further office. He devoted himself to the support of the Protestant interest in France,&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; and tried to reduce the effects of the [[Second White Terror|White Terror]].

A member of the upper house after the [[July Revolution]] and throughout the reign of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] (the ''[[July Monarchy]]''), he was driven into private life by the establishment of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], but lived to see the [[French coup of 1851|1851 coup]] and to rally to the government of [[Napoleon III of France|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]], dying in [[Paris]] the next year.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22073">'''Ceaușima''' ({{IPA-ro|t͡ʃe̯a.uˈʃima}}) is a [[Romanian language|Romanian]] [[neologism]] sarcastically comparing the policies of former [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist]] leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] to the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear attack on Hiroshima]].&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, Note 3, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; This [[portmanteau]] term was coined in the 1980s to describe the huge urban areas of [[Bucharest]] that Ceaușescu ordered torn down during the final few years of his tenure.  Significant portions of the historic center of Bucharest were demolished to accommodate standardized apartment blocks and government buildings, including the grandiose [[Centrul Civic]] and the palatial [[Palace of the Parliament|House of the Republic]].

The term has also been used to describe other actions of Ceaușescu not linked to the demolition of Bucharest, such as intense pollution in the [[Transylvania]]n city of [[Copșa Mică]].

== Systematization ==
{{Main|Systematization (Romania)}}
Ceaușescu considered it necessary to his program of [[Systematization (Romania)|systematization]] to demolish vast portions of the historic and central parts of Bucharest and replace them with giant representation buildings and high-density standardized apartment blocks. The latter was rooted in the ideology of "edifying the multilaterally developed socialist society" and it was considered an epitome of the [[Leninism|Leninist]] formula of the "fight between old and new" (''see [[Historical materialism]]'').

Started in 1974, and implemented some six years later, the program implied a comprehensive nationwide campaign of demolition, resettlement, and reconstruction. Historian [[Dinu C. Giurescu]] writes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The urban systematization conducted by the communist regime has destroyed 29 traditional towns to 85-90% and also has heavily mutilated other 37 cities, including Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, "De la "Sistematizare" la Planul Urbanistic. Ceaușescu redivivus", in ''Formula AS'' 716, 8–15 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The main target of the systematization was Bucharest.

[[File:Blocuri Titan.jpg|thumb|Apartment blocks in Titan]]
The triggering event of systematization in Bucharest was the [[1977 Vrancea earthquake|major earthquake of 1977]], which predominantly struck edifices built before [[World War II]] (preceded by another major earthquake, that of November 10, 1940), while the structures dating from the communist era held out well. This was interpreted by the communist regime as a proof of its superiority over the [[Kingdom of Romania|pre-war regimes]], and led to a paradigm change in its urban development policy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Up to that time, the communist regime had concentrated on the clearance and redevelopment of slums like ''[[Floreasca|Groapa Floreasca]]'' or ''Groapa lui Ouatu'' (1950s) as well as on new high-density urban settlements in the suburbs, such as ''[[Bucureștii Noi]]'' (1950s), ''Balta Albă'' (later ''[[Titan, Bucharest|Titan]]''), ''[[Berceni, Bucharest|Berceni]]'', ''[[Giurgiului]]'' or ''[[Drumul Taberei]]'' (1960s), while the city remained basically untouched. The impacts of the earthquake, more severe in the central city, provided both ideological and technical arguments for urban intervention in historical Bucharest.

The immediate consequences of this new urban policy were the demolition of monuments like ''[[Enei Church]]'' (founded 1611, rebuilt 1723; with murals by [[Gheorghe Tattarescu]]), the [[Neo-gothic architecture|Neo-gothic]] ''Casa Cerchez'' or the elegant ''Baia Centrală'' [[Public bathing|public bath house]] and the suppression of the Authority for the National Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Mărgineanu, pp.125-136&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most pervasive consequence was the commitment of Ceaușescu to accomplish his earlier vision of the monumental [[Centrul Civic]] ("civic centre"), which would concentrate and symbolize the emblems of his power.

[[File:LocatieParlementspaleis.png|thumb|Location of the House of the People in the map of Bucharest.]]
Though the decision to build the new civic centre in the very heart of Bucharest was made in 1978, it took some six years for Ceaușescu to impose a wide-ranging reshaping. During that period, interventions in historical Bucharest, like rebuilding the traditional [[Calea Moșilor]] with uniform concrete [[apartment block]]s, were still carried out respecting the pre-existing urban configuration. This can be explained by the significant opposition the project encountered from a majority of leading experts.&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p.23, 56, 126&lt;/ref&gt; To realize his project, Ceaușescu brought together some 400 [[urban planning]] professionals, visiting them at least once a week during the 1980s and providing what the press called "valuable instructions" (''indicații prețioase'') in front of a large scale model of Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Leahu, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Ceaușescu succeeded in quelling disagreement and opposition expressed by authoritative architects, art historians and intellectuals, a coherent reshaping project never came to light. Instead, through what was largely a step-by-step approach, the implementation of [[Palace of the Parliament|Casa Republicii]] ("House of the Republic"), now ''Palatul Parlamentului'', ("Palace of the Parliament") could be imposed. The subsequent opening of the oversized Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism was but the consequence of architectural requirements aiming at creating a congruent perspective to the colossal House of the People.&lt;ref&gt;Leahu, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; The final result was compared to both the [[Pyongyang]] of [[Kim Il Sung]]&lt;ref&gt;Behr, p.165&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Welthauptstadt Germania|Germania]].&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p.114-116; Verdery, p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

After the project had been officially finalised, the frequent interventions of Ceaușescu continued to modify the situation on the ground, leading mostly to further demolitions.&lt;ref&gt;Leahu, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

The mass destructions in Bucharest began in 1983 and continued up until late 1988. Construction was very intense during the first year, so that in June 1984 the Ceaușescus could inaugurate the workings of what would become the House of the People.&lt;ref&gt;''Evenimentul Zilei''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of demolition==
The destroyed urban areas extended over several informal districts (''cartiere''), some of exceptional architectural and/or historical significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pruteanu.ro/4doarovorba/emis704leahu.htm ''Acuarele Bucureștiului Pierdut'' ("Watercolours of Lost Bucharest"), painted by Gheorghe Leahu - with comments by George Pruteanu] - accessed online 7 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Since both the urban project and its execution were much of a trial-and-error process, demolitions were often arbitrary.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;"Ca să poată 'coordona' imensul măcel edilitar, tovarășului i s-a montat, la Sala Giulești, o instalație nemaivăzută în lume: o machetă cît toate zilele, de 12/12 m, a întregului București, peste care s-a amenajat un pod rulant și acționat electric, unde tovarășul și tovarășa se plimbau înainte și înapoi, înarmați cu niște baghete lungi din vîrful cărora se nășteau indicațiile". Leahu, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; However, a certain west to east pattern of demolition can be ascertained: the western area of ''Uranus'' as well as approximately 92% of the adjoining eastern area of [[Văcărești, Bucharest|Văcărești]] were destroyed, while the areas situated farther east like [[Dudești, Bucharest|Dudești]] and [[Theodor Speranția]] were demolished only along the large boulevards which had to be created there.

===Uranus area===
{{Main|Dealul Spirii}}
The Uranus district was the foremost target of the flattening, since it had an exceptional geographic value, being situated on the most prominent height of Bucharest; this was where the House of the People was to be placed. The height on which the Uranus city district was located, called [[Dealul Spirii]], was radically reshaped in order to make it bear the House of the People. Another height belonging to the Uranus area, of lesser dimensions, was the ''Mihai Vodă'' Hill.

The destruction of the Uranus area reached the shore of the [[Dâmbovița River]] (''[[Splaiul Independenței]]'') on the north side, the streets ''Hașdeu'' and ''Isvor'' on the east side, ''Sabinelor'' and ''[[Calea Rahovei]]'' streets on the south side, cutting a straight line of some 1,200 meters on the north-south axis through a dense urban area along the streets ''Bateriilor'' and ''Logofătul Nestor''. Other important streets of the Uranus district were: Uranus, Mihai Vodă, Puțul cu Apă Rece, Cazărmii, Militari, Schitul Maicilor, Banul Mihalcea, Meteorilor, Minotaurului, Arionoaia. The entire demolished area covered approximately 154 hectares.

The Uranus neighbourhood is remembered for its  special atmosphere; the area was both residential and monumental: many elegant houses and villas, as well as some low-density apartments blocks constructed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coexisted with salient historical and architectural monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ici.ro/romania/ro/bucuresti/bu_nomore2.html ''Album cu fotografii din București: Bucureștiul dispărut'' (2/4)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102183249/http://www.ici.ro/romania/ro/bucuresti/bu_nomore2.html |date=2006-11-02 }} (photographs of some of the lost buildings)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the fortified [[Mihai Vodă Monastery]], founded by the [[Wallachia]]n prince [[Michael the Brave]] in 1589-1591, and housing the State Archives since 1866, was pulled down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ici.ro/romania/images/bucuresti/oldb04.jpg Photo of the demolished ''Mănăstirea Mihai Vodă''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031191119/http://www.ici.ro/romania/images/bucuresti/oldb04.jpg |date=2006-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the entire ''Mihai Vodă'' Hill has been leveled to open the view on the House of the People, while the Mihai Vodă Church&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ici.ro/romania/images/bucuresti/oldb03.jpg Photo of Mihai Vodă Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209030731/http://www.ici.ro/romania/images/bucuresti/oldb03.jpg |date=2006-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was moved to a new location nestled between concrete blocks of flats.

[[File:Biserica Sfantul Spiridon 1860.jpg|thumb|The Saint Spiridon church in 1860. This is the New Saint Spiridon church, which still exists, not the demolished Old Saint Spiridon church.]]
Among other edifices of cultural and/or historical significance torn down in the Uranus area were: the Central Military Museum, the old Arsenal, the [[Art deco]] [[Stadionul Republicii|Stadium of the Republic]] (1926), the Army Theatre, Casa Demetriade, the Operetta Theatre, the higher education Institute for Physical Education, the Athletes' Hospital,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ici.ro/romania/images/bucuresti/oldb19.jpg Photo of the Athletes' Hospital] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031191251/http://www.ici.ro/romania/images/bucuresti/oldb19.jpg |date=2006-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Lahovary Fountain, and the "Isvor" open air bath.&lt;ref name="Clădiri publice..."&gt;''Clădiri publice...''&lt;/ref&gt; Among the churches torn down in the Uranus district were included: the Albă Postăvari Church (donated in 1568 by a Doamna Caplea), the Spirea Veche Church (founded by a doctor Spiridon Christofi in 1765), the Isvorul Tămăduirii Church (a [[guild]]s' foundation of 1794), and the Old Saint Spiridon Church (1668).

The demolition of the churches was done with the approval of the Romanian Orthodox Church leaders. For instance, in 1989, Bishop [[Nifon Mihăiță|Nifon]] answered the questions of western reporters by claiming the churches demolished had not much historical interest and they were too close to others.&lt;ref&gt;Craig R. Whitney, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/15/world/stalinist-rumania-closes-in-on-itself.html?pagewanted=all Stalinist Rumania Closes In on Itself]", ''[[New York Times]]'' July 15, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Relocating churches and cutting them off from their architectural and cultural context to be reinserted into a narrowing neighbourhood is another expression of the strategy that created "Ceaușima". Some examples of churches that were relocated: the Saint Ilie Rahova Church (1745), the [[Schitul Maicilor Church]] (1726), the [[Domnița Bălașa Church]] (founded in 1751 by Bălașa Lambrino, daughter of [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]]), the [[Sfântul Ioan Nou Church]] (18th century) and the entire outstanding monastic complex of [[Antim Monastery]] (1713–1715). A similar type of urban intervention cut entire quarters out of their surroundings. Thus, the city area located south of the Dâmbovița between ''Podul Isvor'' and ''[[Piața Unirii]]'' and up to Antim Monastery was hedged in by a large triangle of standardized concrete blocks of flats.

===Piața Unirii===
{{Main|Piața Unirii}}
The creation of the huge Boulevard of Socialism's Victory imposed additional demolitions in areas adjacent to the Uranus district. Piața Unirii was doubled in size. Excepting the [[Art nouveau]] metal structure of the Halele Unirii allegedly built by [[Gustave Eiffel]],&lt;ref&gt;Derer&lt;/ref&gt; the most notable demolition in this area was the [[Brâncovenesc Hospital]] (''Așezămintele Brâncovenești'' – Brâncoveanu's Foundations, founded in 1835 by Safta Brâncoveanu) – an architectural monument and one of the most venerable, most ample and best-equipped medical institutions of Bucharest and Romania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vmr.ro/pg5-1404.htm ''[[Viața Medicală]]'', 14 (744) anul XVI]; [http://www.bucurestiulvechi.ro/bigpics/img010.jpg Watercolour of ''Așezămintele Brâncovenești''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311044000/http://www.bucurestiulvechi.ro/bigpics/img010.jpg |date=2007-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Văcărești area===
{{Main|Văcărești, Bucharest}}
[[File:Strada Haiducul Bujor, Bucuresti - 1959.jpg|200px|thumb|Strada Haiducul Bujor, connecting Calea Văcărești and Strada Olteni (1959 photograph)]]
Located eastwards of Piața Unirii, the [[Văcărești, Bucharest|Văcărești]] area definitely belonged to the old Bucharest. The demolished area was located between ''Calea Călărașilor'' on the north, the shore of the Dâmbovița on the west and south sides, and ''Mircea Vodă'' and ''Calea Văcăreștilor'' streets in the east. The architecture of the area was eclectic, bearing witness to successive cultural and historical strata, which resulted in a mixture of 18th- to 19th-century edifices (inns, stores) and more recent buildings from the early 20th century. Other significant streets of this area were: Căuzași, Olteni, [[Iuliu Barasch]], Banul Mărăcine, Sf. Ioan Nou, Mămulari, Sfânta Vineri, Negru Vodă, Haiducul Bujor, Clucerul Udricani, Pitagora. The total area razed covered approximately 66 hectares.

Among the most notable destroyed edifices were: the Sfânta Vineri-Herasca Church (founded in 1645), Olteni Church (1696), the historical Vechea Agie (Old Police Prefecture), the Paediatrics Hospital, the Mina Minovici Forensic Institute, Al. I. Cuza College, a monumental Courthouse, the historical Town Hall of the former [[Sectors of Bucharest|Blue Sector]], several old inns and stores (underneath a UU-shaped commercial complex dating from the mid-19th century) and other characteristic edifices.&lt;ref name="Clădiri publice..."/&gt; Unlike in the Uranus area, a very few buildings could be rescued; these included two [[synagogue]]s in Mămulari Street, the little Udricani Church and the neighbouring [[State Jewish Theater (Romania)|State Jewish Theatre]], formerly the Barașeum Theatre, on Iuliu Barasch Street.

===Dudești area===
{{Main|Dudești, Bucharest}}
[[Dudești, Bucharest|Dudești]] is situated eastwards of Văcărești. Before the 1980s, its boundaries ran along ''Matei Basarab'' and ''Labirint'' streets on the north, ''Popa Nan'' and ''Th. Speranța'' streets on the east side, ''Moruzi Voevod'' and ''Papazoglu'' streets in the south, ''Olteni'' and ''Mircea Vodă'' streets on the west side. The central axis of the district ran along the streets ''Calea Dudești'' and ''Avraam Goldfaden'', with other important streets being ''Traian, Nerva Traian, Bradului, and Dr. Popper''.

While the central part of the district has been completely bulldozed to clear the way for the Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism, its northern and southern sections suffered to a lesser extent. The urban texture of the district was characteristic of housing patterns of the late 19th-early 20th century, consisting of family houses set along old tree-lined streets. Neo-classical ornaments, typical for middle class residences, were more frequent in the northern zone of the neighbourhood, while more modest dwelling structures prevailed in the southern area, where [[lower middle class]]es lived. Both the Dudești and Văcărești neighbourhoods were also notable for a traditional and significant [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish presence]].&lt;ref&gt;Since Jewish dwelling in Bucharest was not separated or segregated, a compact Jewish quarter did not develop. Nevertheless, up to the early 1960s, a rather large portion of the old city was home for many Bucharest Jews. This area was approximately located along the streets ''Calea Dudești'', ''Goldfaden'' (named after [[Abraham Goldfaden]]) and ''Căuzași'' up to the street ''Sf. Ioan Nou'' in the east and ''Calea Călărașilor'', ''Anton Pann'' and ''Dr. Popper'' in the north. (Ciuciu)&lt;/ref&gt; The total area razed covered approximately 110 hectares.

===Theodor Speranția area===
The [[Theodor Speranția]] area was a residential area from the [[interwar period]], mixing middle with lower class dwelling structures. As in the case of Dudești, this neighbourhood was only partially erased. The total demolished surface was of approximately 50 hectares.

==Summarizing "Ceaușima"==

{{See also|History of Bucharest}}
The areas completely destroyed amounted to some {{convert|380|ha}}. In fact, the destroyed urban substance was more considerable, if isolated building clusters and town spots are added, such as the partial demolition of Știrbei Vodă street. Another outstanding example is the destruction of the vast monastic complex of Văcărești (1722) and of the [[Pantelimon, Bucharest|Pantelimon Monastery]] (1750). Overall, the bulldozed area was approximately five kilometres long by one kilometre wide.&lt;ref name="Danta, p.175"&gt;Danta, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the largest peacetime urban destructions at the hands of humans in recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;Iosa, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bombing of Bucharest in World War II|bombardments in Bucharest]] and the [[1977 Bucharest earthquake|1977 earthquake]] together caused only 18% of the damage produced by the demolition campaign in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Drăgulin, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the 500 hectares accounted as "Ceaușima", 250 hectares were urban districts of historical significance, representing some 20–25% of historic Bucharest.&lt;ref name="Danta, p.175"/&gt;

Among other destroyed monuments were 27 [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] churches (counting eight relocated churches), six [[synagogue]]s and Jewish temples, and three [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;Moraru, p.31-40&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chamber of Horrors''' was one of the attractions at [[Madame Tussauds]] in London, being an exhibition of [[Wax museum|waxwork]]s of notorious murderers and other infamous historical figures. The gallery first opened as a 'Separate Room' in [[Marie Tussaud]]'s 1802 exhibition in London and quickly became a success as it showed historical personalities and artifacts rather than the freaks of nature popular in other waxworks of the day. It closed permanently in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://inews.co.uk/essentials/now-can-play-sherlock-holmes/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early days==
[[Image:Chamber of Horrors 1849.jpg|thumb|right|The Chamber of Horrors in 1849 by [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]]]]
The forerunner of Tussaud's ''Chamber of Horrors'' was the ''Caverne des Grands Voleurs'' (the Cavern of the Great Thieves) which had been founded by Dr [[Philippe Curtius]] as an adjunct to his main exhibition of waxworks in Paris in 1782. Here Curtius displayed wax figures of notorious French criminals who had been executed, as well as members of the French royal family and aristocracy who had been [[guillotined]] during the [[French Revolution|Revolution]].

When [[Marie Tussaud]] moved to London in 1802 to set up her own exhibition at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] she brought some of these figures with her and set them up in a separate gallery; and when later she toured her exhibits around the country she maintained this division in her exhibition using a 'Separate Room' to display them in.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Pauline ''Madame Tussaud's Chamber of Horrors: Two Hundred Years of Crime'' Grafton Books (1987) pg 13 {{ISBN|0-586-06507-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibits at this time included the heads of [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]], as well as [[Madame du Barry]],  [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]], [[Maximilien de Robespierre|Robespierre]], [[Jacques Hébert|Hébert]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier|Carrier]] and [[Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville|Fouquier-Tinville]] in addition to models of a [[guillotine]] and the [[Bastille]] and the Egyptian [[mummy]] from Curtius' collection.

In 1835 Madame Tussaud set up a permanent exhibition in London, and here the 'Separate Room' became the 'Chamber of Horrors'. At this time her exhibits included [[Edward Despard|Colonel Despard]], [[Arthur Thistlewood]], [[Red Barn Murder|William Corder]] and [[Burke and Hare]], in addition to those listed above. The name 'Chamber of Horrors' is often credited to a contributor to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1845, but Marie Tussaud appears to have originated it herself, using it in advertising as early as 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1886 the exhibits included [[Burke and Hare]], [[Murders at Stanfield Hall|James Bloomfield Rush]], [[Charles Peace]], [[William Marwood]], [[Percy Lefroy Mapleton]], [[Mary Ann Cotton]], [[Israel Lipski]], [[Franz Muller]], [[William Palmer (murderer)|William Palmer]] and [[Marie Manning (murderer)|Marie Manning]].&lt;ref&gt;''Guide Book to Madame Tussauds'' (1886)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other exhibits have included [[Edward Despard|Colonel Despard]], [[Arthur Thistlewood]], [[Red Barn Murder|William Corder]], [[Florence Maybrick]], [[Mary Pearcey]], [[George Chapman (murderer)|George Chapman]], [[Hawley Harvey Crippen]], [[Henri Désiré Landru|Henri Landru]], [[Buck Ruxton]], [[Richard Hauptmann|Bruno Hauptmann]], [[John Christie (murderer)|John Christie]], [[John George Haigh]], [[George Joseph Smith]] and [[Charles Manson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/17/photos-madame-tussauds-chamber-of-horrors_n_3606909.html 'Creepy Historic Photos From Madame Tussauds 'Chamber of Horrors' - ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' 17 July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Chamber==
This part of the exhibition was in the basement of the building and included wax heads made from the [[death mask]]s of victims of the [[French Revolution]] including [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]], [[Maximilien de Robespierre|Robespierre]], [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]], who were modelled by Marie Tussaud herself at the time of their deaths or execution, and more recent figures of murderers and other notorious criminals.

The Chamber of Horrors was renovated in 1996 at a cost of $1.5 million,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MADAME+TUSSAUD'S+NEW+HORRORS.-a083957086 'Madame Tussaud's New Horrors' - Daily News and Wire Services 91996)]&lt;/ref&gt; bringing to life the history of crime and punishment over the last 500 years and including items from [[Newgate Prison]] and featuring replicas of instruments of torture displayed amid a recording of actors' groans and screams. An innovation in recent years was to have actors in macabre make-up and costumes lurch at customers from the dark shadows and recesses of prison cells, where some cells were occupied with waxwork figures and others had the doors ajar, giving the impression that a dangerous maniac was on the loose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jimhillmedia.com/contributors1/b/andrea_monti/archive/2003/12/30/1311.aspx 'When it comes to frightful times, you can't hold a candle to Madam Tussauds Wax Museum' - Jim Hill Media (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; Historical characters displayed included [[Vlad the Impaler]], [[Genghis Khan]], [[Guy Fawkes]] and [[Adolf Hitler]]. For murderers of negligible fame, there was no waxwork figure of [[Jack the Ripper]] in the Chamber of Horrors, in accordance with Madame Tussaud's policy of not modelling persons whose likeness is unknown. Instead he was portrayed as a shadow.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Figures of [[Jimmy Savile]] and [[Gary Glitter]] were destroyed rather than being relocated to the Chamber of Horrors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/567003/Jimmy-Savile-Gary-Glitter-waxwork-destroyed-Tussauds 'Savile's waxwork 'too evil' for Tussauds' Chamber of Horrors that includes Hitler' - [[Daily Express]] 9 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Visiting the exhibit was optional and not recommended for young children or pregnant women.

The chamber closed until further notice on 11 April 2016, due to many complaints from families with young children and has since been replaced by a new attraction named the Sherlock Holmes Experience.&lt;!-- Commercial site (unusable as a citation) looks like the only confirmation. --&gt;

'''Dalem Seganing''' was a king of [[Bali]] who reigned in the first half of the 17th century, his exact dating being still uncertain. He belonged to a dynasty which originated from [[Majapahit]] on [[Java]], and ruled from the palace ([[puri]]) of [[Gelgel, Indonesia|Gelgel]].

== Accession to the throne ==

Dalem Seganing is briefly mentioned as king in the religious texts ''Usana Bali'' and ''Rajapurana Besakih''. However, most of the surviving details of his reign come from the [[Babad Dalem]], a chronicle from the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;I Wayan Warna, ''Babad Dalem; Teks dan Terjemahan''. Denpasar: Dinas Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Daerah Tingkat I Bali.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the younger son of the Gelgel ruler [[Dalem Baturenggong]] and the daughter of Dukuh Seganing. He loyally supported his elder brother, king [[Dalem Bekung]], whose reign was beset by rebellions and abortive warfare. According to some versions he took royal powers even before the death of his incapable brother.&lt;ref&gt;I B. Rai Putra, ''Babad Dalem''. Denpasar: Upada Sastra 1991, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; He might have been the [[Balinese people|Balinese]] king who met the first [[Netherlands|Dutch]] visitors to the island in 1597. Dalem Seganing was assisted in his reign by two chief ministers, the brothers Kiyayi Agung and Kiyayi Ler (Lor). The latter is possibly identical with 'Kijloer', the supreme Balinese minister at the time of the 1597 visit. According to a Dutch text, "This Kijloer is, besides the king, the uppermost of the entire Island of Bali, and no-one may come to the king in the palace as he wishes, except this Kijloer".&lt;ref&gt;V.E. Korn, ''Het adatrecht van Bali''. 's-Gravenhage: Naeff 1932, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reign ==

The reign of Dalem Seganing was briefly troubled by a rebellion by the nobleman Pinatih, an event dated in 1605 by a Balinese text. However, the minister Kiyayi Agung was able to persuade Pinatih to lay down arms. For the rest, the chronicles praise the age of Dalem Seganing as peaceful and successful.&lt;ref&gt;C.C. Berg, ''De middeljavaansche historische traditië''. Santpoort: Mees 1927, pp. 156-7.&lt;/ref&gt; His death is dated 1623 in a text, but it has also been suggested that he died in 1651. He had 14 sons of whom [[Dalem Di Made]] succeeded to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;H. Creese, 'Balinese Babad as Historical Sources', ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' 147 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late historical text ''Babad Buleleng'' (1920), the founder of the [[Buleleng]] kingdom in North Bali, [[Gusti Panji Sakti]], is claimed to be a son of Dalem Seganing.&lt;ref&gt;P. Worsley, ''Babad Buleleng; A Balinese Dynastic Genealogy''. The Hague: M. Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt; The same paternity is claimed for Dewa Manggis I, the ancestor of the kings of [[Gianyar]].&lt;ref&gt;Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung, ''Kenangan Masa Lampau''. Jakarta: Yayasan Obor Indonesia 1993, p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== External threats and trade relations ==

From external, in particular Dutch sources, it can be seen that the Gelgel kingdom on Bali was relatively stable and powerful in the first half of the 17th century. The rulers claimed a loose suzerainty over [[Blambangan]] in East [[Java]], [[Lombok]], and [[Sumbawa]]. However, the warlike activities of the [[Makassar]] kingdom of [[South Sulawesi]] deprived the Gelgel ruler of his interests in Sumbawa in c. 1618-19, and jeopardized his hold on Lombok.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. de Graaf, 'Lombok in de 17e eeuw', ''Djåwå'' 21 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dutch East Indies Company]] (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC) was interested in Bali for economic and strategical reasons, as being a [[Hindu]] realm that was opposed to the [[Muslim]] [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] kingdom on [[Java]]. Among the items coveted by the VOC were [[rice]], [[cattle]] and [[slave]] women, and a trading post was briefly established in c. 1620. It was quickly withdrawn, though, and Balinese trade with the outside world was henceforth carried out by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] private traders, [[China|Chinese]], and various [[Indonesia]]n groups.&lt;ref&gt;W.A. Hanna, ''Bali Chronicles''. Singapore: Periplus 2004, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Dalem Seganing was married to a daughter of Kiyayi di Ler, minister in Gelgel; and with Gusti Luh Made, a daughter of Gusti Ketut Bebengan. He also had a number of co-wives and mistresses. The king sired 14 sons and a daughter:
* [[Dalem Di Made]], who succeeded as King of Bali
* Dewa Kaleran (Dewa Anom)
* Dewa Karangasem
* [[Dewa Cawu]]
* Dewa Blayu
* Dewa Sumerta
* Dewa Pamregan
* Dewa Lebah
* Dewa Sidan
* Dewa Kabetan
* Dewa Pasawahan
* Dewa Kulit
* Dewa Bedahulu
* Gusti Mambal, adopted as son by the minister Kiyayi di Ler Pranawa
* Dewa Randa Guwang, daughter.

Scarr received a Bachelor's and Master's degrees in English and Rhetoric and Public Address from the [[University of Florida]], and taught high school English, public speaking and debate. Afterwards she became a scuba instructor in [[Florida]] in 1974 and began her diving career on the island of [[San Salvador Island|San Salvador]]. Dee arrived [[Bonaire]] in 1980 and started working in the Bonaire National Marine Park, and in 1982 she created the diving program Touch the Sea, in which special care for the area is taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Legends and Heroes of Scuba Diving|url=https://www.sportdiver.com/keywords/living-legends/living-legends#page-10|accessdate=16 November 2017|agency=Sport Diver|date=21 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 she married David Batalsky. Between 1988 and 1991, Scarr and her workmates tied more than 600 sponges back onto pilings beneath Bonaire's Old Pier in Touch the Sea's Sponge Reattachment Project. In the mid-90's she surveyed Bonaire's harbor area, removing trash, establishing misused areas and informing the Bonaire Marine Park to educate misusers. The first major recognition of Scarr's work was in 1991, when she was the second recipient of the PADI-SeaSpace Environmental Awareness Award, after [[Jacques Cousteau|Jacques Yves Cousteau]].&lt;ref name=SD&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scubadiving.com/article/news/bonaires-dee-scarr-receives-coveted-nogi-award-dema-show-2008|title=Bonaire's Dee Scarr Receives Coveted Nogi Award At DEMA Show 2008|last=|first=|date=27 October 2008|work=Scuba Diving|access-date=16 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.divefriendsbonaire.com/2017/07/interview-dee-scarr/|title=It’s all about feeling a connection to the underwater world.

Scarr was recognized and inducted into the Inaugural Roster 2000 of the [[Women Divers Hall of Fame]] at the Beneath the Sea Exposition at the Meadowlands Exposition Center, New Jersey, on 25 March 2000. She was also an inaugural member of the Women Divers Hall of Fame and SSI's Platinum Pro Divers, those with more than 5000 dives; Scarr has logged over 7000 dives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dee Scarr|url=http://www.bonairereporter.com/news/2000Issues/04-11-00/page2.htm|accessdate=16 November 2017|agency=The Bonaire Reporter|date=12-18 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; After realizing that dive training agencies didn't provide critical information about living coral to their students, she founded Action in Behalf of Coral in 2005. In 2006 she was awarded Captain Don Stewart's Accolade Award for "making knowledge of the sea fun and spreading desire in others to learn and become themselves part of our sea.", in 2007 she was awarded the Boston Sea Rovers Diver of the Year Award, the Beneath the Sea Diver of the Year Award for Environment and the Underwater Club of Boston's Paul Revere Spike. In 2008, at the 49th Annual [[NOGI Awards]] Gala, she received the [[Academy of Underwater Arts and Sciences]] (AUAS) NOGI Award for Distinguished Service, one of the oldest and most prestigious award in the diving industry.&lt;ref name=SD/&gt;&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt; 

Dee has written three books: ''Touch the Sea'', about interactions with marine animals, ''The Gentle Sea'', about undersea creatures likely to be encountered by divers, and a children's book, ''Coral's Reef''. For more than a decade Scarr wrote monthly articles about marine animals and their behaviors for Dive Training magazine, and currently writes for The Bonaire Reporter about marine animals. She was the photographer for the original Guide to the Bonaire Marine Park and contributed to the second edition of the guide.&lt;ref name=SD/&gt;&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1394">'''Elizabeth Crofts''' is an imposter known for her involvement in one event in 1554 known as "the bird in the wall". Reports indicate that Crofts who was a serving maid was paid or volunteered to pretend to be a heavenly messenger against the marriage of [[Mary I of England]] and [[Philip II of Spain]].&lt;ref name=hfm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prescott|first1=H.F.M.|title=Mary Tudor|date=2012|isbn=1780225016|page=XV}}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She was smuggled into a hollow wall on [[Aldersgate Street]] where she declaimed disinformation regarding the Queen, her marriage and Catholicism whilst her accomplices moved amongst the crowd interpreting and encouraging it. Within 24 hours they had reputedly gathered a crowd of 17,000 people. It is thought that Sir [[Anthony Knyvett (1507–1554)|Anthony Knyvett]] may have been involved.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Daniel Hahn, ‘Crofts, Elizabeth (b. c.1535)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6725, accessed 7 Dec 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the wall had been knocked down Crofts was arrested and revealed her story. Some of her accomplices were arrested and punished but generally it was felt that Crofts was not responsible for her actions.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

'''Francisco Macabulos y Soliman''' (September 17, 1871 - April 30, 1922) was a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] patriot who led the [[Katipunan]] revolutionary forces during the [[Philippine Revolution]] against [[Spain]] in 1896.

==Biography==
He was born in [[La Paz, Tarlac|La Paz]], [[Tarlac]] to Alejandro Macabulos of [[Lubao, Pampanga|Lubao]], [[Pampanga]] and Gregoria Soliman. He organized the first Katipunan group there after he was inducted into the secret society by [[Ladislao Diwa]] in 1896. When the revolution broke out in 1898, he liberated [[Tarlac]] and established town councils in areas he liberted.

Macabulos refused to honor the [[Pact of Biak-na-Bato]], which called for a truce with the Spanish colonial government, and continued operations in Central Luzon. But on January 14, 1898, he disbanded his troops and accepted amnesty after receiving P14,000 as part of Spanish reparations to Filipino revolutionaries. Macabulos distributed the money to his men.

However, he resumed operations against the Spanish and on April 17, 1898, an assembly of citizens representing the town councils Macabulos established, calling themselves representatives of Central Luzon, met and drafted a provisional constitution. They created a government that was to exist until a revolutionary government is established. Macabulos' government was headed by a general executive committee, consisting of a president, vice president, secretary of interior, secretary of war and a secretary of the treasury.

Macabulos dissolved his government after the [[First Philippine Republic]] was created by the [[Malolos Constitution]], which he also signed. He also led his men to free nearby provinces, like [[Pangasinan]] where he led revolutionists in the [[Battle of Dagupan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5934">{{More footnotes|date=March 2008}}'''Frederick C. Cuny''' (born November 14, 1944 in [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[disaster relief]] specialist who was active in many [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] projects around the world from 1969 until his [[forced disappearance]] in [[Chechnya]] in 1995.

==Life and career==
In 1952 Cuny moved with his family to [[Texas]]. He had a passion for flying and hoped to become a fighter pilot. He studied [[engineering]] at [[Texas A&amp;M University]], specializing in problems in [[developing country|developing countries]], and urban planning at the University of Houston. Unable to pass his language requirements, Cuny could not go on to Officers' Candidate School, thus ending his dream of life as an officer in the military. However, he became increasingly involved in [[social issues|cause]]s such as the problems of local [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[migrant worker]]s.

Cuny became an accomplished [[civil engineer]], working on large construction projects such as a [[radar]] installation at [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport]]. At some point he became dissatisfied and decided to become a [[disaster relief]] specialist who used his training in engineering to do humanitarian work. Cuny was hired by organizations such as the [[United Nations]] and private foundations to design and carry out relief plans. Cuny was able to maintain the autonomy to devise solutions his way and became increasingly active as a policy adviser. Cuny's overriding goal was to institute a radical restructuring of the way the disaster relief system operated throughout the world.

==Humanitarian work==

In 1971 he founded the non-profit Intertect Relief and Reconstruction Corp. of [[Dallas]], Texas, a relief mission technical assistance and training company. In Dallas, is where he met Jean Parker, who helped start his company and she worked with him as a disaster mitigation specialist for many years. His company became the major disaster relief agency, Interworks. Cuny also founded the Center for the Study of Societies in Crisis which became known as the [[Cuny Center]] after his death. He worked in countries such as [[Biafra]], [[Guatemala]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Iraq]], [[Somalia]], and [[Croatia]]. At the end of his life he was working closely with [[George Soros]]' [[Open Society Institute]], and was instrumental in the early stages of founding the [[International Crisis Group]], which seeks to institutionalize the [[knowledge base]] of relief experts. Cuny was named a [[MacArthur Fellow]] in 1995, but disappeared before he could officially receive his award.

==Disappearance==

In April 1995, Cuny and his team of two [[Russia]]n [[Red Cross]] doctors and an interpreter disappeared in [[Chechnya]] while seeking to negotiate a [[ceasefire]]. Cuny's family believes that although they were in contact with the Chechen forces under [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]] who were meant to pass them on for safe keeping, they were arrested and executed under the orders of Rizvan Elbiev (Elbiyev), a local Chechen rebel [[counterintelligence]] commander.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cuny/kill/ "Who killed Fred Cuny"], ''Frontline'', Sherry Jones&lt;/ref&gt; It is suspected that the Russians, antagonised by Cuny's published criticism of the war, disseminated [[propaganda]] that Cuny and his team were Russian [[spy|spies]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/18/world/russian-role-seen-in-aid-worker-s-death.html "Russian Role Seen in Aid Worker's Death"], ''The New York Times'', ALESSANDRA STANLEY, August 18, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/spy-or-savior "Spy or Savior?"], ''The Nation'', George Kenney, July 8, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Their remains were never found.

==Political campaigns==
During the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2014|2014 Midterm elections]], Rothblatt ran as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate against incumbent [[Bill Posey]] in [[Florida's 8th congressional district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ballotpedia.org/Florida%27s_8th_Congressional_District_elections,_2014|title=Florida's 8th Congressional District |author=  |date= |website= |publisher=Ballotpedia |access-date=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothblatt qualified for the ballot through the petition method by gathering 4,936 signatures; the minimum required was 4,834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://election.dos.state.fl.us/candidate/CanPetSig.asp?account=60345|title=Candidates Petition Signatures, 2014 General Elections |author=  |date= |website= |publisher= Florida Division of Elections |access-date=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues of concern to Rothblatt were [[technological unemployment]], protecting family values, promoting education, protecting the environment, developing space, and human rights.&lt;ref name = dfa/&gt;&lt;ref name =powers&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2014-08-18/news/os-congressional-gabriel-rothblatt-20140817_1_congressional-candidate-martine-rothblatt-religion |title=Congressional candidate has faith in technology |author=Scott Powers |date=August 18, 2014 |website= |publisher=Orlando Sentinel |access-date=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The candidates' debates covered [[Obamacare]], [[abortion debate|abortion]], military action, [[environmentalism]], [[renewable energy]], [[same-sex marriage]], and the [[government shutdown]]; and according to Posey the debates demonstrated their ideological differences.&lt;ref name = berman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2014/10/17/politics-innocent-question-creates-bit-stir/17456693/|title=On Politics: Innocent question creates a bit of a stir |author=  |date=October 17, 2014 |website= |publisher=Florida Today |access-date=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/os-election-congress-d8-posey-rothblatt-20141007-story.html|title=Space exploration remains final frontier in 8th District congressional race |author=Scot Powers|date=October 13, 2014|website= |publisher=Orlando Sentinel|access-date=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothblatt's belief in transhumanism and his family ties were both regularly covered by the media. Jessica Roy, from [[Time (magazine)|Time]], reported that Rothblatt's status as a member of Terasem may be just as difficult for his campaign as being a Democrat in the Republican majority district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/66536/terasem-trascendence-religion-technology/ |title=The Rapture of the Nerds|author=Jessica Roy |date=April 17, 2014 |website= |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a campaign event, [[gubernatorial]] candidate [[Charlie Crist]] introduced Rothblatt by saying “Gabriel is the messenger that God sent."&lt;ref name = howley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2014/09/25/charlie-crist-goes-on-the-offensive-in-melbourne/16209687/|title=Charlie Crist goes on the offensive in Melbourne |author=Dave Berman|date=September 25, 2014 |website=Florida Today |publisher= |access-date=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other opinions of his campaign were more critical. Katie Prill, from the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]], wrote "his radical ideas are too extreme for Florida families."&lt;ref name = powers/&gt;  Posey's spokesman, George Cecala, stated that, "It all comes down to the real issue, and that is Bill Posey is a conservative and Gabriel Rothblatt is a liberal.&lt;ref name = powers/&gt; Posey won the election with the majority of the vote; however, [[Neely Tucker]] from the ''[[Washington Post]]'' called Rothblatt's campaign "a respectable debut,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/martine-rothblatt-she-founded-siriusxm-a-religion-and-a-biotech-for-starters/2014/12/11/5a8a4866-71ab-11e4-ad12-3734c461eab6_story.html|title=Martine Rothblatt: She founded SiriusXM, a religion and a biotech.

===SpacePAC===
Rothblatt was supported by SpacePAC, a [[Political Action Committee]] (PAC) founded by his parents.&lt;ref name = powers/&gt; Under campaign finance laws, PACs are not permitted to collaborate with the candidate.&lt;ref name = powers/&gt; Due to these restrictions, the Rothblatts were not permitted to discuss the campaign together until the election was over.&lt;ref name = powers/&gt; The PAC drew criticism from an editorial page of the ''[[New York Times]]'' due to the family relationship between the founders of the PAC and Rothblatt's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/opinion/the-custom-made-super-pac-.html?_r=0|title=The Custom-Made ‘Super PAC’ |author=  |date=August 3, 2014|website= |publisher= [[New York Times]] |access-date=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that Rothblatt did not know that his parents were setting up the PAC until he saw yard signs promoting his candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/07/18/relatives-fund-candidate-super-pacs-rothblatt/12824361/|title=Some candidates' super PACs are a family affair|author=Fredreka Schouten and Christopher Schnaars| date=July 18, 2014 |website= |publisher= [[USA Today]] |access-date=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Patrick, from [[Watchdog.org]], Posey knew of the family relationship between Rothblatt and the PAC, but Posey declined to comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://watchdog.org/161806/democratic-super-pac/ |title=Democratic candidate gets $225,000 boost from sole super PAC donor, his dad |author=William Patrick |date=July 29, 2014|website= |publisher= [[Watchdog.org]]  |access-date=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Berman, from ''[[Florida Today]]'', reported that even with the support of SpacePAC, Posey's campaign had far more funds than Rothblatt's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/10/10/numbers-look-good-brevard-democrats/17050817/ |title=Numbers don't look good for Brevard Democrats |author=Dave Berman|date=October 10, 2014|website= |publisher= Florida Today |access-date=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Leary, from the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' reported that SpacePAC was not the first PAC to be set up by a wealthy parent to support their child's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/florida-congressional-candidate-gets-super-pac-boost----from-his-father/2195089|title=Florida congressional candidate gets Super PAC boost |author= Alex Leary|date=October 28, 2014|website= |publisher=Tampa Bay Times|access-date=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rao '''Godji I''' was the [[Raja|Rao]] of [[Cutch State|Cutch]] belonging to the [[Jadeja]] [[Rajput]] dynasty, who ruled [[Princely State of Cutch]] from 1715 to 1718.

==Life==
Godji I was a son of Rao [[Pragmalji I]]. He led a force sent by his father to restore throne of Tamachi, the sixth in descent from their ancestor Hala, who was driven from [[Halar]]. After the death of Pragmalji, he succeeded in 1715 and ruled for a short period of three years. He desposed Haloji, the son of Pragmalji's elder brother Nagulji, of his estate of [[Mundra]]. Haloji, unable to resist, retired to Abdasa, and there founded the towns of [[Kothara, Kutch|Kothara]], Kotri, and Nagarchi. His descendants are known as Halani Jadejas. He died in 1718 and was succeeded by his son [[Deshalji I]].{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 2015 |page=137-138}}

'''Iiro Viinanen''' (born September 27, 1944, [[Kuopio]], [[Finland]]) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] politician. Viinanen graduated as an engineer from a Tampere institute in 1967 and as a [[Diplomi-insinööri|M.Sc. Tech.]] from [[Helsinki University of Technology]] in 1974 . He was a Member of the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish Parliament (Eduskunta / Riksdagen)]] from 1983 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=

He served as the [[Minister of Finance (Finland)|Minister of Finance]] from 1991 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://valtioneuvosto.fi/tietoa/historiaa/hallitukset-ja-ministerit/raportti/-/r/v9l/13 |title=Council of State - Ministers of Finance|publisher=Valtioneuvosto.fi |accessdate=12 January 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During his term as a minister, Finland went through its worst recession in history. As the Minister of Finance in [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]] [[Esko Aho's cabinet]] he led strict budget discipline. He stated that unless budget is cut, Finland can no longer borrow money from foreign countries. Reactions towards his actions caused either strong approval or strong disapproval. Some felt he saved the treasury and some felt he ruined the Finnish welfare state.

In 1996 he was appointed CEO of [[OP Financial Group|Pohjola Insurance]]. At the end of the 1990s he was a board member of [[Nokia]], [[Kone]], [[UPM-Kymmene]], [[YIT]], [[Finnair]], and [[Orion corporation|Orion]]. He served as a vice chairman of Nokia from 1996 to 2000.

He was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] in 2000, forcing him to retire.

'''Jack Pfefer''' (also commonly spelled as "Pfeffer"; December 10, 1894 - September 13, 1974) was a [[professional wrestling]] promoter during the early-to-mid 1900s.  He pioneered an earlier form of [[sports entertainment]], as he was one of the first promoters to visualize the pro wrestling business in the mold of theater. However, he developed an infamous reputation when he exposed the sport's inner secrets to the mainstream press in a spiteful attack that nearly destroyed the entire industry.

==Early life==
Jacob Pfefer was born near [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] on December 10, 1894. He grew up under the control of the Russian Empire; and it was during this period when the Czars issued numerous decrees against [[Jews]], resulting in a series of pogroms that killed thousands amidst increased [[anti-Semitism]]. He therefore left as part of the era’s mass Eastern European emigration following [[World War I]], thus escaping the [[Holocaust]] by hiding in the boiler room of a ship to the United States.&lt;ref name=god57&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p.57.&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in the United States in 1921 while working as the manager for a touring acting company. With a propensity for theatrical drama, Pfefer subsequently found himself interested in the budding pro wrestling industry; and by 1924, he had begun promoting a band of Eastern European heavyweights as exotic contenders to the American champions (who would always emerge victorious over the foreign challengers in the end). Over the next five years, Pfefer gradually established himself among the region’s top booking agents; and then in 1929, he eventually relocated to [[New York City]].

==New York promoter==
Upon arriving in the [[Big Apple]], Jack Pfefer quickly aligned himself with renowned New York promoter [[Jack Curley]], who then ranked among the most powerful men in the entire wrestling business. Following the break-up of the famed [[Gold Dust Trio]] in the late 1920s, Curley initiated an alliance with several of the East Coast’s top bookers, including [[Toots Mondt]] and [[Ray Fabiani]]; and he subsequently formed an industry “Trust” that enabled the various regions to share their elite grappling talent. Pfefer performed as the group’s main talent manager, and he was primarily responsible for scouting potential European grapplers while also overseeing the organization’s financial books. Over the next few years, the Trust rode its incredibly popular centerpiece superstar, [[Jim Londos]], to record profits while Pfefer helped lead one of the greatest periods in New York’s rich wrestling history. Moreover, as Curley’s health began to decline, Pfefer began to position himself among the eventual heirs to the New York wrestling throne.

==Exposing the work==
Then in 1932, a contractual dispute caused an eventual rift between Curley and Londos; and the New York territory quickly deteriorated without its top drawing card. Pfefer therefore abandoned Curley in favor of Londos’ group in early 1933; but later that November, a peace accord was signed between Curley’s East Coast promotion and the [[Tom Packs]]/[[Jim Londos]] alliance that was dominating in the Midwest. The agreement subsequently extended the Trust’s influence throughout all of North America, with Curley, Packs, Mondt, Fabiani, Ed White, and [[Paul Bowser]] all agreeing to share the profits evenly. As a result, Jack Pfefer consequently found himself without any allies, as he was stuck on the outside looking in on the industry’s powerful new coalition. Ostracized by his fellow wrestling peers, a bitter Pfefer looked to exact revenge, and he therefore arranged an interview with Dan Parker, who was the sports editor for the New York Daily Mirror. Pfefer subsequently took the unprecedented step of revealing most of pro wrestling’s secrets and inner workings, freely admitting the sport’s “fakery” and theatrics. Although fans had long suspected that pro wrestling was worked, Pfefer had introduced a feeling of cynicism among the mainstream press that they were being used as promotional “chumps” by Curley and his associates; and in a now-famous headline, the November 19, 1934 [[New York Daily News]] covered an impending [[Jim Londos]] vs. [[Everett Marshall]] bout by proclaiming, "Londos and Marshall meet at Garden tonight for 26th time. Score - Londos 26, Marshall 0."

As a result of Pfefer’s stunning admission, pro wrestling had suddenly become a laughingstock, and sportswriters no longer covered its results since it was no longer deemed to be “legitimate competition.” Furthermore, with the nation immersed in the [[Great Depression]], pro wrestling gates plummeted in New York; and in October 1934, [[Ring Magazine]] proclaimed the end of “honest-to-goodness wrestling matches.” With the New York territory in shambles, Pfefer then began promoting light-heavyweights along with [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] booker [[Al Haft]] and Charlie &amp; Willie Johnson. Moreover, Pfefer again plotted against his former partners when he paid [[Dick Shikat]] to shoot on the Trust’s new champion [[Danno O'Mahoney]]; and on March 2, 1936, Shikat betrayed Curley en route to “stealing” the championship. The Trust subsequently filed an injunction against Shikat; but before the trial ever got started, Toots Mondt paid Pfefer $17,000 to double-cross Haft and his champion, [[Ali Baba (wrestler)|Ali Baba]], by maneuvering the title onto [[Dave Levin (wrestler)|Dave Levin]] on April 24, 1936. Pfefer then sold Levin’s contract to Curley and Mondt in order to re-establish his industry ties; however, the Trust ultimately blew up when the other promoters refused to work alongside Pfefer, thus ending the alliance as each territory began promoting its separate titleholders.

==Later career==
Jack Pfefer never retracted his stance that wrestling was more entertainment than competition; and he therefore distinguished himself from his peers by presenting shows as a form of theater, with exaggerated storylines and bizarre performers. He was renowned for his booking of “freak” characters, most notably including the [[French Angel]] ([[Maurice Tillet]]) and the [[Swedish Angel]] (Nils Filip "Phil" Oloffson [1906-1974]), whom Pfefer promoted based on their hideous looks. Moreover, Pfefer initiated numerous innovations, including such novelties as feature tag team bouts and midget wrestling. He also possessed a great eye for young talent, as he was instrumental in launching the career of [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]]; and he also served as a chief promoter of women’s grappling, booking the likes of [[Mildred Burke]] and the [[Fabulous Moolah]] over several decades. It was also Pfefer who helped the legendary [[Sam Muchnick]] promote his first show in 1945; and in subsequent years, he constantly shifted his base of operations, running territories in [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Boston]], and on the West Coast while solidifying his place among the industry’s top marketers. However, while working as an agent for promoter [[Fred Kohler]] in the 1960s, Pfefer was largely blamed for ruining the Chicago territory when he booked a number of sound-alike performers like “Bummy Rogers”, “Hobo Brazil,” and  "Bruno Sanmartino", thus repelling most of the industry’s top-flight talent. Nonetheless, he continued booking matches until 1967; and then on September 13, 1974, Jack Pfefer died at age 79 while at a [[Massachusetts]] nursing home. To this day, he remains one of the sport’s most controversial figures, yet he is also acknowledged among its most imaginative promoters.

==Personal life==

Pfefer was close friends with many of the wrestling personalities he worked with and had a habit of sending gifts to their families. [[Stu Hart]] took a great liking to him and asked him to be the [[Godparent|godfather]] of Hart's tenth child and seventh son, [[Ross Hart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Hornbaker | first = Tim | title = National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly That Strangled Pro Wrestling | publisher = ECW Press | year = 2007  | location =     | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 978-1550227413| page = 252 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Karo was born in Toledo, Spain in 1488.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; In 1492, aged four years old, he was forced to [[Spanish expulsion|flee Spain]] with his family and the rest of Spanish Jewry as a result of the [[Alhambra Decree]] and subsequently settled in the [[Kingdom of Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Carsten L. |last=Wilke |title=Histoire des Juifs Portugais |location=Paris |publisher=Chandeigne |year=2007 |isbn=9782915540109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[History of the Jews in Portugal#Portugal|expulsion of the Jews from Portugal]] in 1497, the Ottomans invited the Jews to settle within [[Ottoman Empire|their empire]]. Karo went with his parents to [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopolis]], then a city under Ottoman rule. In Nikopol, he received his first instruction from his father, who was himself an eminent [[Talmudist]]. He married, first, Isaac Saba's daughter, and, after her death, the daughter of [[Hayyim Albalag]], both of these men being well-known Talmudists.

Between 1520 and 1522 Karo settled at [[Edirne]]. He later settled in the city of [[Safed]], [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman Galilee]], where he arrived about 1535, having en route spent several years at [[Salonica]] (1533) and [[Istanbul]].

==Rabbinic career==
For a short while he lived in Nikopol, but decided to make his way to the [[Land of Israel]] so that he could immerse himself in [[Holiness of Palestine|its sanctity]] and complete his written works. Passing through Salonica, he met the great [[kabbalist]] [[Joseph Taitazak]]. He continued his journey to the Holy Land via Egypt and eventually settled in [[Safed]].

At Safed he met [[Jacob Berab]] and was soon appointed a member of his rabbinical court. Berab exerted great influence upon him, and Karo became an enthusiastic supporter of Berab's plans for the restitution of ''[[semicha]]'' (rabbinical ordination) which had been in abeyance for over 11 centuries. Karo was one of the first he ordained and after Berab's death, Karo tried to perpetuate the scheme by ordaining his pupil [[Moses Alshech]], but he finally gave up his endeavors, convinced that he could not overcome the opposition to ordination. Karo also established a ''[[yeshiva]]'' where he taught [[Torah]] to over 200 students.

A Yemenite Jewish traveler, [[Zechariah Dhahiri|Zechariah (Yaḥya) al-Dhahiri]], visited Rabbi Karo's ''[[yeshiva]]'' in Safed, in ''circa'' 1567 CE&lt;ref&gt;The date of al-Dhahari's visit to the Land of Israel is alluded to in Chapter Twenty-Five of al-Dhahiri's book, ''Sefer Ha-Musar''. There, he writes: "Now, in Tiberius there was the wise man, [Rabbi Eliezer] Ben Yochai, in whose generation he was of singular character; in the year, ''et '''ha-keves''' he-eḥad'' = את '''הכב"ש''' '''ה''''אחד, I moved on from there into the village of Kanah, the city of Jonah, the son of Amitai, and from there to Shechem and to Jerusalem, and Hebron the place of my fathers." The year is denoted in Hebrew characters, in the form of a biblical verse (i.e., "the one '''lamb'''" – Exo. 29:39), each Hebrew character having a numerical value. The year given is highlighted as הכב"ש ('''ה''' = 5; '''כ''' = 20; '''ב''' = 2; '''ש''' = 300), which, being rearranged, is actually השכ"ב (327), believed to have been the abbreviated form of the year, without the millennium.  By adding the numerical value of the first letter of the next word, '''ה''' in the word האחד, it brings us to the millennium 5; that year being 5,327 ''anno mundi'', or what was then 1567 CE. Thus is it explained in Yehuda Ratzaby's 1965 edition of ''Sefer HaMusar'', p. 287, who relied upon the date of 1567, based upon Yaari's calculations. Mordechai Yitzhari, however, in his 2008 edition of ''Sefer Ha-Musar'', p. 162, for reasons unexplained, appends the date of 1565. It should be pointed out here that if we were to strictly apply the numerical values in the word השכ"ב alone, with the view that it already includes the millennium of 5, the year of al-Dhahiri's visit to the Land of Israel would have been in 1562 CE.&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote of his impressions on this wise:&lt;ref&gt;Zachariā Al-Ḏāhrī, ''Sefer Hammusar'' (ed. Yehuda Ratzaby), Ben-Zvi Institute, Jerusalem 1965 (Hebrew), pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I journeyed from Syria, the province, through Upper Galilee, unto the city of Safed, the land of Canaan. … I then came into the city, and lo! Within her dwelt the Divine Presence, for within her there is a large community, frowardness being removed far from them, about fourteen thousand in number! In eighteen seats of learning they had come to study the Talmud. There, I saw the light of the Law, and the Jews had light. They surpassed all other communities. … Then it was that I knew my estimable worth, based on all my strength and ability, and lo! I had been deficient in several matters. Now, 'that which is lacking cannot be numbered' &lt;small&gt;(Eccl. 1:15)&lt;/small&gt;. I made myself inconspicuous in her midst, while my thoughts were languorous. Within the synagogues and ''midrashic'' study halls I had come to hear the expositors who expound upon a certain matter in several ways, seeing that they know every secret thing, from the walls of the ceiling, all the way down to its foundation – but, especially, the great luminary, even the wise man, Rabbi Joseph Karo, from whose seat of learning the wise men of Safed do not quit themselves, for in his heart the Talmud is stored, after he had sat down in learning for seven years, within a confined chamber. Now, aside from several branches of wisdom, within his heart are sealed, both, revelations and mysteries.

I went one Sabbath to his seat of learning, to see his honourable and glorious magnanimity. I sat down by the entrance, alongside the doorpost of the gate, while my cogitations from foolishness were sorely gripped by fear. Now, that wise man the elder sat upon a chair, and with his mouth he did amplify the subject matter. By an utterance he would draw man away from his burthen caused by the vicissitudes of time, in drawing him nigh unto the faithful God. He would then clothe him, as it were, in sumptuous apparel fit for those who are free, by his recital of the verse: 'The Law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul' &lt;small&gt;(Ps. 19:7)&lt;/small&gt;. He then deliberated on a certain matter by explicating its plain and esoteric sense. Before him were seated about two-hundred very admirable and distinguished pupils, sitting upon benches. When he had finished his words of wisdom, he gestured to a certain disciple opposite him to speak. … Now, when that wise man (i.e., Rabbi Joseph Karo) heard the words of that disciple, he was astonished by his eloquence of speech who had given plausible arguments about the soul, and he then raised him up and exalted him above all the pupils that were with him. … I stayed there awhile, until the wise man (i.e., Rabbi Joseph Karo) had gestured to his pupils to stand up, and then gave order to each one to learn a [[Mishna]]. So they went their way, the pupils who were there gathered and the wise man (i.e., Rabbi Joseph Karo).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Al-Dhahiri|first=Yaḥya (Zechariah)|title=Sefer Ha-Musar|publisher=Benei Baraq 2008 (Hebrew), pp. 58, 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When Jacob Berab died, Karo was regarded as his successor, and together with Rabbi [[Moshe of Trani]] he headed the Rabbinical Court of Safed. In fact, by this time, the Rabbinical Court of Safed had become the central rabbinical court in all of [[Old Yishuv]] (southern [[Ottoman Syria]]), and indeed of the [[diaspora]] as well. Thus there was not a single matter of national or global importance that did not come to the attention and ruling of the Safed Beth Din. Its rulings were accepted as final and conclusive, and Karo's halachic decisions and clarifications were sought by sages from every corner of the diaspora. Rabbi Joseph Karo was also visited in Safed by the great Egyptian scholars of his day, Rabbi [[Radbaz|David ibn Abi Zimra]] and Rabbi [[Yaakov Castro]]. He came to be regarded as the leader of the entire generation.

[[File:ציון רבי יוסף קארו.JPG|thumb|250px|Karo's grave in Safed]]

In a dramatic testimonial, Rabbi [[Shlomo Alkabetz]] testified that in Salonica, Karo had become one of the rare individuals who merited to be instructed by a ''maggid''—a private angelic teacher who revealed to him many kabbalistic teachings. The maggid exhorted Karo to sanctify and purify himself, and he revealed to him events that would take place in the future. In ''Shaarei Kedusha'', Rabbi [[Chaim Vital]] explains that visitation by a maggid is a form of Divine Inspiration (ruach hakodesh). The teachings of the maggid are recorded in his published work titled ''Maggid Meisharim'', although Rabbi [[Chaim Joseph David Azulai]] notes that only about one fiftieth of the manuscript was ever published, (see Works). However, in numerous places in ''Maggid Meisharim'' it is stated that, "I am the Mishna that speaks in your mouth," indicating that the Oral Torah itself (of which the Mishna is the fundamental part) spoke within him. (However, these two explanations are not necessarily contradictory—in the merit of the Mishna Karo constantly reviewed, he was worthy of an angelic teacher).

The Maggid promised him that he would have the merit of settling in the [[Land of Israel]], and this promise was fulfilled. Another promise, that he would merit to die a martyr's death sanctifying God's Name like [[Solomon Molcho|Rabbi Shlomo Molcho]] had merited, did not transpire for an unspecified reason.

His reputation during the last thirty years of his life was greater than that of almost any other rabbi since [[Maimonides]]. The Italian [[Azariah dei Rossi]], though his views differed widely from Karo's, collected money among the rich Italian Jews for the purpose of having a work of Karo's printed; and [[Moses Isserles]] compelled the recognition of one of Karo's decisions at [[Kraków]], although he had questions on the ruling.

When some members of the community of [[Carpentras]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], believed themselves to have been unjustly treated by the majority in a matter relating to taxes, they appealed to Karo, whose letter was sufficient to restore to them their rights (Rev. Etudes Juives 18:133–136). In the East, Karo's authority was, if possible, even greater. His name heads the decree of excommunication directed against Daud, [[Joseph Nasi]]'s agent; and it was Karo who condemned [[Azariah dei Rossi|Dei Rossi]]'s ''Me'or Enayim'' to be burned.  Several funeral orations delivered on that occasion have been preserved (Moses Albelda, ''Darash Mosheh''; Samuel Katzenellenbogen, ''Derashot''), as well as some elegies from Karo's passing.

==Published works==
[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Jewish Encyclopedia e9 327-0.jpg|thumb|250px|Title page of Karo's ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'']]
Karo published during his lifetime:
* ''[[Shulchan Aruch#Beth Yosef|Beth Yosef]]'' (בית יוסף), a commentary on ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'', the current work of [[halakha|Jewish law]] in his days. In this commentary Karo shows an astounding mastery over the Talmud and the legalistic literature of the Middle Ages. He felt called upon to systematize the laws and customs of Judaism in face of the disintegration caused by the Spanish expulsion.
* ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' (שולחן ערוך), a condensation of his decisions in ''Beth Yosef''. Finished in 1555, this code was published in four parts in 1565. The work was not accepted without protest and criticism, but after the lapse of a century, and in consequence of certain revisions and amplifications, it became the almost unquestioned authority of the whole Jewish world.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/q/qaro.html |title=Qaro |work=Encyclopædia Britannica 1911 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Kesef Mishneh'' (כסף משנה) ([[Venice]], 1574–75), a commentary of ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' by [[Maimonides]];

After his death there appeared:
* ''Bedek ha-Bayit'' (בדק הבית) (Salonica, 1605), supplements and corrections to ''Beth Yosef'';
* ''Kelalei ha-Talmud'' (כללי התלמוד) (Salonica, 1598), on the methodology of the [[Talmud]];
* ''Avkath Rochel'' (אבקת רוכל) (Salonica, 1791), [[Responsa]]
* ''Maggid Meisharim'' (מגיד מישרים) (Lublin, 1646), and supplements ([[Venice]], 1646)
* ''Derashot'' (דרשות) (Salonica, 1799), speeches, in the collection 'Oz Tzaddikim'.

Karo also left a commentary upon the [[Mishnah]], as well as supercommentaries to [[Rashi]]'s and [[Nahmanides]]' commentaries on the [[Torah]], which have not been preserved.

==''Maggid Meisharim''==
Karo's literary works are considered among the masterpieces of [[rabbinic literature]]. The ''Maggid Meisharim'' (1646, ''Preacher of Righteousness''), another major work, a strange and mystical diary, is a kind of diary in which Karo during a period of fifty years recorded the nocturnal visits of an angelic being, his heavenly mentor, the personified [[Mishna]] (the authoritative collection of Jewish Oral Law). His visitor spurred him to acts of righteousness and even asceticism, exhorted him to study the Kabbala, and reproved him for moral laxities.

The discussions treat of various subjects. The maggid enjoins Karo to be modest in the extreme, to say his prayers with the utmost devotion, to be gentle and patient always. Especial stress is laid on asceticism; and Karo is often severely rebuked for taking more than one glass of wine, or for eating meat. Whenever Karo did not follow the severe instructions of his maggid, he suddenly heard its warning voice. His mentor also advised him in family affairs, told him what reputation he enjoyed in heaven, and praised or criticized his decisions in religious questions. Karo received new ideas from his maggid in regard to the Kabbala only; such information was in the nature of sundry cabalistic interpretations of the [[Pentateuch]], that in content, though not in form, remind one of the theories of Karo's pupil, [[Moses ben Jacob Cordovero]].

The present form of the ''Maggid Meisharim'' shows plainly that it was never intended for publication, being merely a collection of stray notes; nor does Karo's son Judah mention the book among his father's works (Introduction to the Responsa). It is known, on the other hand, that during Karo's lifetime the kabalists believed his Maggid to be actually existent (compare Vital-Calabrese, ''Sefer ha-Gilgulim'', pp.&amp;nbsp;119, 142, [[Vilna]], 1885). The ''Maggid Meisharim'', furthermore, shows a knowledge of Karo's public and private life that no one could have possessed after his death; and the fact that the maggid promises things to its favorite that were never fulfilled—e.g., a martyr's death—proves that it is not the work of a forger, composed for Karo's glorification.

However, according to Shlomo ben Aderet's responsa 548 it would seem the book was forged.

'''Kamel Fathi Ghilas''' (born 9 March 1984) is an Algerian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[forward (association football)|forward]].

==Club career==
===Early years===
Born in [[Marseille]], [[France]],&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11"/&gt; Ghilas started his career in amateur football, with ES Vitrolles. At the age of 19 he joined [[AS Cannes]] in the [[Championnat National]], quickly breaking into the [[Glossary of association football terms#F|first team]] and featuring mostly as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]].

Ghilas established himself as a starter in the 2004–05 season, going on to lead the team in scoring by netting seven times in 31 appearances. The following year he contributed with 13 as the [[French Riviera]] club narrowly missed out on promotion to [[Ligue 2]], finishing two points behind [[FC Libourne-Saint-Seurin]] for the third and final spot.

===Vitória Guimarães===
Ghilas signed for [[Vitória S.C.]] from Portugal in the summer of 2006, penning a two-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=273522|title=Ghilas assinou por 2 anos|trans-title=Ghilas signed for 2 years|newspaper=[[Record (newspaper)|Record]]|language=Portuguese|date=15 June 2006|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2006–07 Liga de Honra|his first year]] he ranked first in goals scored in his team, helping to a return to the [[Primeira Liga]] after one year out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=337831|title=Ghilas: "Não estou cansado"|trans-title=Ghilas: "I am not tired"|newspaper=Record|language=Portuguese|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghilas made his debut in the competition on 19 August 2007, starting in a 1–1 home draw against [[Vitória F.C.|Vitória de Setúbal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmrtv.pt/desporto/195-vitoria-comeca-liga-bwin-com-empate-caseiro-1-1|title=Vitória começa Liga Bwin com empate caseiro (1–1)|trans-title=Vitória start Bwin League with home draw (1–1)|publisher=Guimarães TV|language=Portuguese|date=20 August 2007|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored six times in a further 20 league appearances to help the side [[2007–08 Primeira Liga|finish a best-ever third]] and [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League|qualify]] to the [[UEFA Champions League]]; however, following a contract dispute, he left the [[Minho Province]] club as a [[free agent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=343507|title=Direcção desiste da renovação de Ghilas|trans-title=Board of directors give up on Ghilas renewal|newspaper=Record|language=Portuguese|date=20 May 2008|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celta===
On 12 July 2008, [[Celta de Vigo]] announced the signing of Ghilas from Vitória,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/edicion/marca/futbol/2a_division/celta/es/desarrollo/1145429.html|title=El Celta se adelanta al Arsenal y ficha a Kamel Ghilas|trans-title=Celta get ahead of Arsenal and sign Kamel Ghilas|newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|language=Spanish|date=12 July 2008|accessdate=12 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the player penning a three-year contract worth [[Euro|€]]300,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=349963|title=Ghilas no Celta de Vigo para tentar a subida|trans-title=Ghilas in Celta de Vigo to attempt promotion|newspaper=Record|language=Portuguese|date=13 July 2008|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goals for the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicians]] on 28 September in a 2–1 home win over [[CD Tenerife]], in what was [[2008–09 Segunda División|the season]]'s first win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/edicion/marca/futbol/2a_division/cronica/es/desarrollo/1169841.html|title=El Celta consigue su primera victoria|trans-title=Celta get first win|newspaper=Marca|language=Spanish|date=28 September 2008|accessdate=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July 2009, a fee of [[Pound sterling|£]]1.7&amp;nbsp;million was agreed for Ghilas to transfer to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in the [[Premier League]] – the move was set to be completed pending on the player agreeing personal terms and passing a medical. However, the transfer broke down in the 11th hour, with conflicting reports on the grounds: the English claimed he had failed the medical, whereas the Spaniards claimed that Blackburn had attempted to renegotiate the transfer fee and player's wages at the last minute; they attempted to disprove Rovers' claims by playing him in a [[Exhibition game|friendly]] the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atlantico.net/noticia/84036/celtadevigo/fichajes/ghilas/blackburnrovers/|title=La venta de Ghilas se rompe|trans-title=The sale of Ghilas breaks down|publisher=Atlántico|language=Spanish|date=31 July 2009|accessdate=31 July 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803182725/http://www.atlantico.net/noticia/84036/celtadevigo/fichajes/ghilas/blackburnrovers|archivedate=3 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kamran Mirza''' ({{lang-fa|کامران ميرزا}}; July 22, 1856 – April 15, 1929) was the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Prince]] of [[Qajar Dynasty]] and third surviving son of [[Nasser al-Din Shah]]. He was brother of [[Mass'oud Mirza Zell-e Soltan]] and [[Mozzafar al-Din Shah]]. He is also the progenitor of Kamrani Family. He might have been Prime minister of Iran for a few days in April–May 1909, but this is not clearly referenced. Kamran Mirza also served as Iran's [[Commander-in-Chief of the Iranian Armed Forces|Commander-in-Chief]], appointed in 1868 for the first time, and [[Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics (Iran)|minister of war]] from 1880 to 1896 and from 1906 to 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kamran-mirza-nayeb-al-saltana Kamran Mirza Nayeb-al-Saltana]  on [[Encyclopædia Iranica]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

His mother, Monir al-Saltaneh, was the daughter of the architect to the crown. Due to Nasser-ed-Din Shah's dislike of Mozaffar-ed-Din Mirza, he was the Shah's favored son for the succession but on account of the non-[[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] origin of his mother, like his other brother [[Mass'oud Mirza Zell-e Soltan]], Kamran Mirza was not eligible for succession to the throne.

He was educated by private tutors and at the Imperial Military College in Tehran. In 1862, when he was 6, [[Nasser al-Din Shah]] appointed him as the governor of [[Tehran]] with the stewardship of Pasha Khan Amin ol-Molk. He styled ''Na'eb es-Saltaneh'', Vice Regent, in 1867 before the Shah's trip to [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and was given the title ''Amir Kabir'', grand commander, the highest rank in the Qajar military, by his father in 1869. He was governor of [[Tehran]] 1862–1863 and 1875–1876, governor of [[Qazvin]] and [[Gilan]] 1878–1884, Mazandaran 1878–1884, Minister for War from 1869 to 1873, 1884, 1896.

The star of Kamran Mirza's fortunes plummeted, but it was not entirely eclipsed, after the assassination of Nasser al-Din Shah in 1896. His daughter, [[Malekeh Jahan]], married to Mohammad Ali Mirza who later crowned as [[Mohammad Ali Shah]]. During the Constitutional Revolution he established the pro-court society. He was minister of war in 1908. In the reign of his grandson, [[Ahmad Shah Qajar|Ahmad Shah]] He was Governor-General of Khorasan from 1916 to 1917.

Kamran Mirza Nayeb es-Saltaneh died in [[Tehran]] on April 15, 1929 and was buried in [[Qom]].The [[Kamranieh]] district in the [[North Tehran]] belonged to him. He received the Order of the Royal Portrait, Temssaal-e Homayouni, from his father.

==Storylines==
The eldest child and daughter of [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) and [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]), Lauren moves to [[Walford]] with her parents and younger sister, [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) in July 2006. In 2007, Lauren discovers that her father is having an affair with her half-brother [[Bradley Branning]]'s ([[Charlie Clements]]) fiancée, [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), after accidentally filming them kissing on her video camera. Lauren burns the footage onto a DVD and it is played on Christmas Day, exposing Max and Stacey's affair and resulting in the breakdown of Max and Tanya's marriage. Romantically involved with [[Peter Beale]] ([[Thomas Law]]), Max disapproves of their relationship and demands Peter end the romance but ends up throttling him when they meet secretly in the cafe. Shortly after, Max is left comatose, following a hit-and-run. It is revealed that Lauren is responsible but Tanya confesses to the crime and is imprisoned, pleading guilty to attempted murder. This distresses Lauren who confesses to the police and is found guilty of [[grievous bodily harm|GBH with intent]], and is sentenced to two years under supervision.

In 2008, paedophile [[Tony King (EastEnders)|Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]), stepfather to her best friend, [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), starts grooming her to replace Whitney. When Tony's paedophilia is revealed, Lauren is shocked to learn about his intentions. Unnerved, Lauren dumps Peter, who tells his friends that he and Lauren had a sexual experience in the allotments. However, the couple plan a reunion and Lauren tells him she is ready to have sex, but Max bans them from seeing each other. Lauren leaves Walford when the extent of Max's debt is revealed by bailiffs who remove the family's possessions. She returns briefly at Christmas, and dumps Peter again before seeing him kiss [[Zsa Zsa Carter]] ([[Emer Kenny]]), causing a catfight between her, Zsa Zsa and Whitney. She attends Bradley's funeral after he falls from the roof of [[The Queen Victoria]] pub (The Vic), while attempting to evade arrest by the police for the murder of [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb]]). She celebrates her sixteenth birthday at a party in [[R&amp;R (EastEnders)|R&amp;R]] [[nightclub]], where her uncle [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) is shot by [[List of EastEnders characters (2010)#Kylie|Kylie]] ([[Elarica Gallacher]]). After attending Abi's birthday dinner, Lauren informs her father that she is going  to spend the summer at a summer camp in the United States.

Lauren (now played by [[Jacqueline Jossa]]) returns from America earlier than expected, after being expelled from school for smoking cannabis. She reveals that she has a new boyfriend, [[Edward Brooks (EastEnders)|Edward Brooks]] (Luke Striffler), but they split up because of the distance. Lauren attends her cousin [[Billie Jackson]]'s ([[Devon Anderson]]) birthday party and as a present, she gives him alcohol and he is found dead of alcohol poisoning the next morning. Billie's mother, [[Carol Jackson|Carol]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) attacks Lauren, blaming her for encouraging Billie to drink. Lauren suspects that Max killed Archie after he tells her that Bradley was not the culprit and she notes his violent tendencies when he confronts [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]) for making crude sexual remarks after she rejects his attempt to proposition her. Lauren confronts Max and he tells her that he is not the killer but knows who is; after seeing Max and Stacey together, Lauren realises that Stacey is the killer and tricks a confession out of her, which she records on her mobile phone. Lauren threatens to go the police, but agrees to keep quiet after discovering that Archie raped Stacey. However, on Christmas Day, Lauren hands [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) the recording and Stacey flees after Janine exposes her. Lauren develops a crush on Whitney's half-brother, [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]), and they begin an affair. However, the relationship is threatened when Tanya finds out and the relationship ends when he flees after killing [[Rob Grayson]] ([[Jody Latham]]), who had been sexually exploiting Whitney for financial gain. 

Lauren discovers that Max and Tanya are having an affair, despite Tanya now being married to [[Greg Jessop]] ([[Stefan Booth]]), Lauren threatens to kill Max unless the affair ends, but it secretly continues. The affair is soon exposed, causing Max to leave Walford. Lauren is angered by Tanya's actions, but is devastated to learn that Tanya has been diagnosed with [[cervical cancer]]. Lauren promises to support her but struggles to cope with her mother's illness. She starts drinking excessively and almost ends [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G. Hawkins]]) and [[Jodie Gold]]'s ([[Kylie Babbington]]) relationship by having sex with Darren in the car lot - hours before the wedding. She also casually dates [[Tyler Moon]] (Tony Discipline) until realising Whitney is still in love with him. Max returns to Walford, and when Lauren learns that Tanya has stopped her treatment, begs him to stay and reveals her illness so he stays. Lauren's rebellion continues and after she gets drunk at [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]]' ([[Pam St. Clement]]) funeral, she is berated by her parents and given a private consultation with a GP. Lauren withdraws from school, and is employed at the car lot. She resumes drinking and tries to conceal this from her parents. Her drinking is so heavy that Lucy tells her to go home but Lauren ignores her, insisting that she is fine. Lucy loses her and she is found passed out in the street. Lauren tells her parents her drink was spiked before stating she is mature enough to make decisions. She then decides to move out. On her 18th birthday, a drunken Lauren belatedly arrives at a family party, organised by Tanya. After being sick, Lauren admits to her parents that she is uncontrollable and promises not to drink any more. She moves back home after not being able to cope with the laziness of her housemates. Lauren and Lucy (now played by [[Hetti Bywater]]) go on a night out where a drunken Lauren shares a kiss with a stranger, Dan, who drags her into his car. After Lucy manages to drag her out, they argue and Lauren storms off. Lucy finds her unconscious and takes her to hospital but Lauren discharges herself. Lauren returns home to find Lucy has already told Max, Tanya and Ian everything. Angry, Lauren argues with her family and leaves, meeting Dan. After she rejects his advances, Lauren goes to Lucy's house and Lucy tells her that she does not want anything more to do with her.

Lauren meets her cousin, [[Joey Branning]] ([[David Witts]]), and is attracted to him. Her friendship with Lucy begins to improve after Ian disappears and Lauren helps find him. Joey and Lucy start dating but Lauren learns  that Joey had cheated with Whitney, and urges her to tell Lucy. Lucy ends the relationship and the girls take revenge by handcuffing him to playground equipment. Lauren decides to free him so he does not lose his job, and he tells her she is jealous that she did not get a kiss, so she slaps him. Joey is working at R&amp;R when he sees Lauren flirting with a group of men so he throws them out and takes Lauren home. Lauren drunkenly kisses Joey but he rejects her. The following day, Joey explains that he rejected her because she was drunk and they kiss again. Lauren realises she cannot be with her cousin, so resists. Eventually, sexual tension mounts between them and they start a secret relationship. Joey's father [[Derek Branning]] ([[Jamie Foreman]]) finds out when he sees Joey and Lauren passionately kissing in the car lot office. Derek threatens Lauren so she and Joey plan to leave Walford. As they drive away in Derek's car, a drunk Lauren loses control of the car and crashes into a shop. Derek helps rescue them from the burning building and makes Joey take the blame for the crash. At the hospital, Lauren tells Tanya about her relationship with Joey and Derek blackmails Joey to end it. Heartbroken and distraught, Lauren continues to drink and Tanya realises that Joey is still in love with Lauren. Lauren later drunkenly reveals her relationship with Joey to the rest of her family. Joey leaves Walford after Derek dies but returns and reunites with Lauren, where Lucy witnesses them kissing. When trying to justify her relationship, Lauren is shocked when Lucy calls her selfish and undeserving of Joey's love, so Lauren considers telling the police the truth about the car crash, but Joey convinces her not to. Lauren and Joey's relationship is publicly revealed, though people start to accept it. Lauren discovers that Tanya has lied about missing a hospital appointment, and as Tanya refuses to talk, Lauren starts drinking again. Lauren destroys her mother's wedding gown and cake before Tanya and Max remarry. She later bonds with Max's secret wife, [[Kirsty Branning]] ([[Kierston Wareing]]), upsetting Tanya.

Lauren finds out that Kirsty is pregnant, unaware that Kirsty is lying. At a party, Lucy spikes Lauren's drink so she drunkenly reveals that Kirsty is pregnant. Lauren falls out with Joey, who breaks up with her over her behaviour. She applies for a job as a waitress with Whitney at [[Ian Beale]]'s ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) new restaurant but Lucy gets Joey to be Lauren's test customer so Lauren will fail. Whitney gets the job but purposely withdraws so that Lauren gets the job instead. She tries to make Joey jealous by kissing Tyler, who is engaged to Whitney, but it fails and Whitney ends their friendship and Lucy offers the job to Whitney. Lauren's drinking gets worse, though she believes she is not alcohol and tricks her step-grandmother [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) to give her money, which she uses to buy alcohol. Tanya is angry when she discovers this. Lauren then steals £20 from her grandmother's purse and when Tanya discovers this, she compares her to her aunt, [[Rainie Cross]] ([[Tanya Franks]]). Disgusted, Lauren attempts to buy more alcohol but Kirsty refuses to serve her, following Tanya's wishes. Lauren walks outside and confides in Joey but Lucy sees this and starts intimidating Lauren so she punches Lucy and smashes the café window. Lauren is arrested but Lucy decides not to press charges. Ian gives Lauren her waitress job back, but is sacked on the opening night for getting drunk and spills drink on a guest. Tanya and Max find bottles in Lauren's bedroom and decide to keep her locked in the house. She believes Lauren is showing no signs of withdrawal but Lauren reveals she has been drinking vodka from a water bottle, so Tanya realises she is addicted. Tanya keeps Lauren locked in her room but her withdrawal leads her to climb out of the window and Lauren says that nobody can stop her from drinking if she wants to. The next day, Tanya tells Lauren to leave after she destroys Abi's revision notes, and she stays with Max and Kirsty. Tanya asks Peter (now played by [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) to spend time with Lauren, but their date is sabotaged by Lucy, so Lauren gets drunk again and leaves with a group of strangers. When she returns, her skin and eyes are yellow and she collapses in pain, so she is taken to hospital and diagnosed with [[alcoholic hepatitis]]. She is warned that she could die if she doesn't stop drinking. Lauren returns and sees Joey so tries to find him. She confronts Lucy over her relationship with Joey, but Lucy refuses to answer, so Lauren concludes that they are together and tries to get a drink but is refused service. Tanya takes her home, where she admits that she cannot cope with her parents'  onxtant arguing. Ultimately, Tanya blames herself and takes Lauren to a clinic in Exeter, believing a change of scene could help.

Lauren, now a [[recovering alcoholic]], returns to Walford and dislikes how people treat her, until Abi reminds her of the hurt she caused. Lauren reconciles and is heartbroken to discover that Joey slept with Whitney while she was away. Lauren leaves, taking a drink with her but chooses not to drink it. She attends counselling and meets [[Jake Stone (EastEnders)|Jake Stone]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]). She sees that he is married but learns that is separated. Lauren falls in love with him but finds out that he is still married to [[Sadie Young]] ([[Kate Magowan]]), they split up but resume their affair, Max catches them and orders Lauren to end the relationship. Later that day, Joey asks Lauren to leave Walford with him but she decides to stay and resumes her affair with Jake.  They are caught by [[Bella Young]] (Isobelle Molloy) when she walks in on Lauren getting dressed. Understanding how Bella feels, Lauren ends the affair. When Sadie learns of this, Lauren attempts to apologise to her but learns that Sadie and Bella have left. She tries to persuade Jake not to drink again but he angrily throws a bottle of wine at Lauren and injuring her face; however, she forgives him before he leaves Walford. Lauren is stunned to see Stacey in The Vic, Stacey tells Lauren she is not staying but they meet again at Dot's house. Cora decides to call the police, but Lauren stops her and makes amends with Stacey as they talk about Bradley. She overhears Max and Stacey talking about a recent kiss they had and is agitated, asking her to stay away from Max. She overlooks what she heard when Stacey reveals she is waiting for the police to arrest her for murdering Archie because she wants to clear Bradley's name. Lauren avoids Jake when he returns to Walford as he has fallen off the wagon and is staying on Ian Beale's sofa.

Lucy asks Lauren to go into business with her. Although initially reluctant, Lauren agrees and they set up "LB Lettings". Lauren becomes suspicious that Lucy is dating Jake when he sets up the website for their business and Lucy begins arranging secret meetings. Lucy soothes her anxieties but she is seeing Max. Soon after, Lucy is found dead and Lauren is devastated. She leans on Peter for support in her grief, and is tempted to drink again but Cora talks her out of it. Determined to overcome her grief, Lauren starts up the business again and finds an email from someone wanting to meet on the night Lucy died. Believing Lucy went instead of her, Lauren tells the police but is not taken seriously, so she arranges to meet them herself. She is shocked when the person is revealed to be Jake and he chases her through Walford to try and stop her from going to the police. However, she does and he is arrested, although Lauren clearly has doubts if he did kill Lucy.

When Peter falls out with his girlfriend, [[Lola Pearce]] ([[Danielle Harold]]), Lauren comforts him and they kiss. However, Peter feels bad for cheating on Lola and leaves, but it is clear Lauren has feelings for him. Jake is released when evidence clears him of any involvement and makes peace with Lauren before leaving. Lauren starts dating [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) after they have a one night stand but is shocked when Peter breaks up with Lola and tells Lauren he loves her after kissing her again. Lauren tells him that she wants to be with Dean and Peter vows to wait for her. When Peter is about to visit New Zealand, Lauren ends her relationship with Dean and tells Peter she loves him. Lauren and Peter later begin to get paranoid when they are followed. When they get a car registration, DS Summerhayes finds that it is a police car signed out to [[List of EastEnders characters (2014)#DS Cameron Bryant|DS Cameron Bryant]] ([[Glen Wallace]]) but she tells everyone that the registration number belongs to a reporter. On Halloween night, she encounters a mysterious person in a Halloween mask who follows her throughout the evening. This is later revealed to be Abi.

Peter asks Lauren to [[Proposal (marriage)|marry]] him. Lauren accepts, but after finding out that Peter was [[drug dealing|selling drugs]] to Lucy, she tells him that she cannot marry him.&lt;ref name="EastEnders episode"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04tlnnt | title=BBC One EastEnders | work=[[BBC]] | accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On New Year's Day 2015, Max's girlfriend [[Emma Summerhayes]] ([[Anna Acton]]) is killed in a car accident after meeting someone who she thinks killed Lucy. Although Max tears up Emma's case notes, Lauren finds most of the pages and puts them together, suspicious about who killed Lucy. Lauren asks Peter to marry her and he accepts.&lt;ref name="Marriage"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-01-27/eastenders-spoilers-lauren-asks-peter-to-marry-her---first-look-pictures | title=Lauren asks Peter to marry her | work=[[Radio Times]] | date=27 January 2015 | accessdate=7 February 2015 | author=Brown, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after finding a previously torn off piece of a page from Emma's case files and trying to use Emma's phone, Lauren starts to doubt if she should marry Peter and drinks most of a half-bottle of whisky in Max's office. When Lauren nearly faints, Stacey buys her a test and discovers that Lauren is pregnant. Stacey confronts her about it but Lauren reveals that she knows who killed Lucy, but refuses to divulge the identity to the police. When Stacey calls the police, she is upset at her inability to keep a secret but hands in most of Emma's case files, while keeping the torn-off piece. She writes a card addressed to Jane, saying that Lucy was killed at home, and abruptly leaves to book an abortion. However, during the consultation, Peter interrupts her and offers to support her through all her issues. Lauren says she is confused and that she knows what happened to Lucy, leading him to discover the truth about the murder at home. When Peter decides to emigrate to New Zealand, he asks Lauren to go with him. She initially refuses, planning to join Tanya in Devon but after he tells her that his brother [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington) is Lucy's killer, she changes her mind and decides to go to New Zealand. They dispose of Emma's remaining evidence and SIM card, deciding not to tell the police about Bobby being Lucy's killer. She says goodbye to Max and Abi and leaves with Peter, taking an outfit for their unborn child with them.

A heavily pregnant Lauren returns for Max's murder trial, saying she knows who killed Lucy. As she threatens to tell everyone about Bobby, her waters break. She later gives birth to a baby boy who she names [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Louie|Louie]], in honour of Peter's great-grandmother, [[Lou Beale]] ([[Anna Wing]]). Lauren convinces Abi to stop Max from going to prison and tells [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) that she is going to tell the truth but Max is found guilty, thanks to Phil bribing the jury foreman. Max is sentenced to 21 years imprisonment. Max discovers Lauren knew that he was innocent and disowns her. Lauren makes a statement to the Police claiming that Bobby killed Lucy but they do not believe her and she returns to New Zealand with Louie, vowing to come back and clear Max's name.

In May 2016, Bobby puts Jane in a coma and confesses to killing Lucy, so Ian's mother [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) telephones Lauren and tells Ian that she and Peter are returning. However, when Lauren arrives with Louie, Ian is surprised to see his stepson [[Steven Beale]] ([[Aaron Sidwell]]) instead of Peter. Lauren tries to reconcile with an angry Abi, who is furious that Lauren did not tell her that Bobby killed Lucy. Lauren and Steven try to make Ian understand their relationship and why Peter has not returned. When Max is due to have a court hearing following Bobby's confession, Lauren and Abi write a letter saying they will wait for him in the pub, asking Stacey to deliver it. Stacey returns, saying she missed the hearing but passed the letter to his solicitor. Max is released but does not meet Lauren, so she goes home. The letter is returned and she runs outside to see Max leaving in a taxi. Lauren helps Abi get her job back in The Vic and decides to party with her friends. Lauren catches Abi and Lee and assumes that Abi is making a move on him, however Abi drunkenly reveals that she and Lee previously had sex. Lauren promises not to tell Whitney even though Steven tells her to. That same day, Lauren helps Whitney do a pregnancy test, which is positive. Lauren later warns Lee that she knows about his sex with Abi but says she will not say anything because it would mean ruining Whitney's happiness. When Whitney does eventually find out about Lee's unfaithfulness, Lauren supports her. She later starts a business as a web designer, with her first client being [[Belinda Peacock]] ([[Carli Norris]]). Steven is annoyed when Lauren buys a new laptop following a burglary at the Beales' restaurant. Steven tells Lauren he needed a way to pay debts and she promises not to tell Ian the truth about the burglary as long as they are honest with each other in future.

Lauren is excited when Louie says his first word: "mama". Steven gets him to say "dada" and records a video. Lauren sends it to Peter, which upsets Steven as he sees himself as Louie's father, but Lauren says Peter will always be Louie's father. When Jane discovers Steven has been stealing money from the restaurant, he explains he borrowed it to pay Peter's debts as he is drinking heavily and getting into fights, and Lauren does not know the whole truth. When Lauren learns this, she is angry that he was not honest and considers visiting Peter. Steven says he wanted to protect her and Louie, and going to New Zealand out of guilt or pity will be a mistake, so she decides not to go. Lauren starts to worry that her relationship with Steven has become stale but she does manage to seduce him until they are interrupted. While visiting Max at work, Lauren meets [[Josh Hemmings]] ([[Eddie Eyre]]) and they share an attraction. Lauren insists on meeting up with him to see what happens. Josh suggests that Lauren apply for a job at the company he works for, Weyland &amp; Co, where Max also works. Lauren is shocked that Josh is one of the interviewers as she thought he worked on the photocopier, so she leaves but Josh follows; she slaps him for lying but they kiss. Meanwhile, Steven is eager for a baby with Lauren but she would rather concentrate on her career, so Steven starts piercing holes in his condoms. Lauren reaches the final two for the job and Max asks Josh not to employ Lauren, and he makes sure someone else gets the job, however, Josh visits Lauren at home and offers her a different job, and he meets Steven and realises Lauren is in a relationship and has a child. Thanks to Abi, Steven becomes paranoid about Lauren and Josh's relationship and starts tracking Lauren's whereabouts via a mobile app. Lauren finds out she is pregnant, and books an appointment to discuss an abortion, soon after revealing her intentions to Abi, as she is not ready to have a second child. Max tells a disbelieving Lauren that Josh is engaged, then Josh admits he is getting married in November. Lauren surprises and annoys Abi by arranging a secret Father's Day visit from Oscar for Max, neglecting to tell Abi about it. However, this drives Abi to reveal the abortion to Steven, though he decides not to confront Lauren. Lauren tells Josh that she loves Steven but admits that there are no "fireworks", and tells Josh that she will not cheat on him, unaware that Steven has been spying on her with a secret camera. Unaware that Abi and Steven have embarked on an affair, Lauren realises she does not love Steven and plans on returning to New Zealand to make amends with Peter. However, Steven learns about her plans and lies to her that he has an inoperable brain tumour. Lauren is wracked with guilt and decides to remain in Walford. In another desperate attempt to keep her, Steven spontaneously proposes to her in the Queen Vic, which she accepts. Lauren then resigns from Weyland &amp; Co and starts planning her and Steven's wedding, however, after a fire which he started at Ian's restaurant, he dies. Lauren is devastated. Abi tries to tell her that she is pregnant with Steven's baby but Lauren misinterprets it as gloating about her own abortion, so Abi says that she wishes Lauren died instead and that she never deserved Steven's love, causing Lauren to start drinking again. On the day of Steven's funeral, Lauren finds out he lied about having a brain tumour and destroys his wreaths. When she finds out that Steven has been cremated, she refuses to scatter his ashes. Abi decides to leave Walford to visit Tanya and when Lauren learns of this, she asks if she and Louie can join her. Abi agrees and they leave Walford together; unbeknownst to Lauren, Abi is secretly taking Steven's ashes with her.

Lauren returns and moves back in with Ian and asks Josh for her job back. Josh accepts and flirts with Lauren but she rejects him again, but after numerous attempts, Lauren eventually gives into temptation and kisses Josh. When Josh's former fiancee, [[List of EastEnders characters (2017)#Imogen|Imogen]] (Alexandra Sinclair) arrives unexpectedly at the office, she belittles Lauren and tells her that Josh dislikes children. To confirm this, Lauren asks Josh if he would like to spend time with her and Louie; he reluctantly accepts, but implies that they should go as a couple instead which displeases Lauren. Josh later tries to declare his love for he and asks why they cannot be together; she explains that they are different people and that she is a recovering alcoholic. Ian's mother [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) advises Lauren to move on from Steven and pursue Josh, which she does and they start a relationship. Lauren discovers Weyland &amp; Co's Project Dagmar, a plan to develop Albert Square into luxury apartments, and photographs a scale model. She threatens to publicise the project but her boss [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]), who is also Josh's father, convinces Lauren that the project has fallen through due to investors dropping out at the last minute and she deletes the photo. Josh confirms this, having only just heard about the project. However, it emerges that this was a lie and that Weyland &amp; Co have bought several properties in Albert Square and are evicting business owners. Lauren refuses to give an eviction notice to Ian, so is fired. She discovers that Max is involved in the plan to con the residents. James destroys Max's contract, revealing that he has also been manipulated, but Josh gives Lauren a copy as he is entitled to his share. Lauren asks Max for the truth or she will destroy the copy, but he destroys it himself, saying that he knew about Abi's affair with Steven and her pregnancy and that his plan was to exact revenge on those who abandoned him. Later, Josh tells Lauren that he can stop the development by revealing that James bribes members of Walford Council. Josh asks Lauren to stall James and Fi at a press launch so he can get evidence of the bribes, so she chains herself to their property, but is arrested for breach of the peace. Lauren is cautioned and released, and then kisses Josh when he says he has left Weyland, though his plan has failed. Josh is offered a new job in Glasgow and Lauren agrees to move there with him. Ian disapproves of her relationship with Josh when he catches them kissing which causes Lauren to slap Ian, but Kathy convinces him that Josh is not like his father. On Christmas Day, Max gives Lauren a thoughtful Christmas present and she tells him that he needs medical help. Tanya returns to take Lauren and Abi away from Walford, revealing that Max killed Steven and tried to kill Jane. Lauren and Abi reject Max. Max goes to the roof of the Vic where he plans to kill himself by jumping off, but Lauren and Abi climb on to the ledge to try and stop him. As Max agrees to come down, Lauren slips and she and Abi both fall off. They are taken to hospital, where Lauren has surgery on her pelvis, which is fractured, and Abi has a CT scan and is declared brain-stem dead. When Lauren starts physiotherapy, she becomes frustrated with not being told the truth about Abi and breaks down when she sees her. Lauren slaps Max for lying to her about Abi's condition and is devastated by Abi's death. Lauren is distraught when Abi's life support is withdrawn.

Before Abi's funeral, Lauren lies to Max that it has already taken place because Tanya does not want him there, however, he realises it is a lie. On the day of the funeral, Lauren tells Whitney about her planned move to Scotland with Josh and Whitney asks her to be sure that she actually loves him or if she is only with him because he is good with Louie. After the service, she sees Max going into the chapel and tells him that she needs to leave, before hugging him and crying. Lauren then takes Louie from Josh and walks away without him. Cora later reveals that Lauren has moved to New Zealand, possibly reuniting with Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a861337/eastenders-lauren-branning-peter-beale-back-together|title=Has EastEnders just revealed that Lauren Branning and Peter Beale reconciled off-screen?|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|first=Justin|last=Harp|date=10 July 2018|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like her mum, she is a quick judge of character but can also be sardonic, cynical and dry, just like her dad."|source=—The BBC describes Lauren played by Jossa (2010)&lt;ref name="EastEnders Profile" /&gt;}} Lauren is described by the BBC website as an "outsider" and "doesn't care what people think".&lt;ref name="EastEnders Profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters/lauren-branning.shtml|title=Lauren Branning played by Jacqueline Jossa|year=2010|work=EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues: "Lauren is very quick on the uptake and picks up on everything going on around her but knows it doesn't pay to have loose lips. She's learnt the hard way that secrets destroy people. And this has made her vulnerable."&lt;ref name="EastEnders Profile" /&gt;

Lauren Branning was introduced in 2006 by executive producer [[Kate Harwood]]. She and her immediate family—father [[Max Branning|Max]] ([[Jake Wood]]), mother [[Tanya Branning|Tanya]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) and sister [[Abi Branning|Abi]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]])—are an extension of the popular and long-running Jackson/Branning clan, who have appeared in the series since 1993. It was announced in May 2006 that Lauren would be played by actress [[Madeline Duggan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=Branning children cast in 'EastEnders'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a33429/branning-children-cast-in-eastenders.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=27 January 2012|date=25 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Duggan was replaced by Jacqueline Jossa, with Duggan's final scenes airing on 23 June 2010.&lt;ref name="NewActress" /&gt;

In August 2010, it was announced that the character would be returning later in the year, now played by [[Jacqueline Jossa]].&lt;ref name="NewActress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a257215/new-actress-to-play-lauren-in-enders.html|title=New actress to play Lauren in 'Enders|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=6 August 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi (UK) Ltd]]|accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of her casting in the show, Jossa said "I was so excited when I got the call to say I'd got the part in ''EastEnders''. I've always been a massive fan of the show and it's a dream come true. The character of Lauren Branning will be really fun to play and there are some exciting things coming up".&lt;ref name="NewActress"/&gt; Kirkwood said "I'm delighted to welcome Jacqueline Jossa to Albert Square. Jacqueline's portrayal of Lauren has all the classic Branning qualities of toughness, cynicism and sensitivity. Jacqueline is set to be at the heart of Walford drama for some time to come".&lt;ref name="NewActress"/&gt; It was reported that Lauren's return would show a more grown-up side to the character, who will cause trouble but also show a softer side as she attempts to find love.&lt;ref name="NewActress" /&gt;

Jossa's first appearance was on 27 September 2010.&lt;ref name="First Jossa Episode"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a275192/ryan-and-janine-face-a-big-crisis.html |title=Ryan and Janine face a big crisis |last=Kilkelly |first=Daniel |date=September 2010 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |accessdate=9 September 2010 |location=London |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sccQNOO8?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a275192/ryan-and-janine-face-a-big-crisis.html |archivedate= 9 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jossa said that when she first got the part of Lauren, she "worried unnecessarily".&lt;ref name="Worried Role"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=26 January 2012|title='EastEnders' Jacqueline Jossa: 'I worried over soap role'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a362315/eastenders-jacqueline-jossa-i-worried-over-soap-role.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]|accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talking to ''PA'', Jossa said that working with Joyner and Wood was not as scary as she thought.&lt;ref name="Worried Role" /&gt; She commented: "There was less pressure than I thought there was going to be. When I first started I got really scared and worked up, thinking everyone's going to hate me. They've been there four years and then I'm coming in to be their daughter - it was a bit surreal. And then two weeks later I felt completely comfortable, everyone was cracking jokes and I thought, 'Oh... I built it up a bit!'"&lt;ref name="Worried Role" /&gt;

===Storyline development===
Lauren's primary storylines concerned a school girl romance with [[Peter Beale]] ([[Thomas Law]]), a friendship with the delinquent [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Melissa Suffield]]), and being caught in the middle of her warring parents, who separated in the serial in 2007 when Tanya discovered Max was cheating on her with [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), Lauren's half brother [[Bradley Branning|Bradley]]'s wife. In the storyline, Lauren played an integral part in the discovery of the affair; as a result of a practical joke, Lauren unwittingly recorded Max and Stacey kissing on video camera, and sent the recording to Bradley as a Christmas present in December 2007 as means of revenge on her father.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a82113/in-pictures-tanya-slaps-stacey-in-fit-of-rage.html|title=In Pictures: Tanya Slaps Stacey In A Fit Of Rage|last=Green|first=Kris|date=21 December 2007|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=12 December 2009|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a change of heart, the recording was seen by the entire Branning family on Christmas Day, an episode that drew 13.9 million viewers, 55.3% of the total audience share.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1573673/BBC-wins-Christmas-Day-ratings-battle.html|title=BBC Wins Christmas Day Ratings Battle|last=Martin|first=Nicole|date=26 December 2007|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=12 December 2009|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character became involved in one of ''EastEnders''' most controversial storylines in 2008, when she was [[child grooming|groomed]] by a [[paedophile]], [[Tony King (EastEnders)|Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]).&lt;ref name="Revoir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1056737/Scores-complaints-EastEnders-shows-scenes-paedophile-grooming-teenager.html|title=Scores of Complaints as EastEnders Shows Scenes Of A Paedophile Grooming A Teenager|last=Revoir|first=Paul|date=17 September 2008|publisher=Mail Online|accessdate=12 December 2009|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tony King had been introduced in September 2008 as the fiancé of Lauren's cousin [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). However, in a plot twist, it was revealed that Tony was already in a sexual relationship with Bianca's 15-year-old stepdaughter [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]). After losing interest in Whitney, Tony turns his attentions to 14-year-old Lauren. An insider said: "He has got away with abusing Whitney for years but it seems one young girl isn't enough."&lt;ref name="Gould"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/latest/2008/09/28/eastenders-paedophile-tony-king-is-set-to-strike-again-115875-20758414/|title=EastEnders Paedophile Tony King Is Set To Strike Again|last=Gould|first=Lara|date=28 September 2008|publisher=Sunday Mirror|accessdate=12 December 2009|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/317408-enders-tony-sets-sights-on-new-victim|title=Enders' Tony Sets Sights On New Victim?|date=19 September 2008|website=Metro|accessdate=12 December 2009|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, it was announced that Lauren is to have a relationship with already established character, [[Ryan Malloy]].&lt;ref name="Ryan Relationship"&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies|first=Rebecca|title='EastEnders' Ryan to have teen affair?|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a317032/eastenders-ryan-to-have-teen-affair.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=27 January 2012|date=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An ''EastEnders'' insider commented: "Sparks will fly when Ryan and Lauren begin their relationship. Max is certainly someone not to mess with. He's already very protective of his daughters and Ryan isn't exactly his favourite person after his relationship with Stacey, who Max will always hold a torch for."&lt;ref name="Ryan Relationship" /&gt;

Jossa explained that upon Lauren finding out about Tanya's cancer, viewers see a different side to Lauren.&lt;ref name="New Side"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' Lauren will change, says Jacqueline Jossa|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a340361/eastenders-lauren-will-change-says-jacqueline-jossa.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told ''[[Inside Soap]]'': "Immediately, there's a change in her - with Tanya so sick, Lauren has to grow up. You'd expect her to dive into the drink again or something like that, but she's right there for Tanya from the minute she finds out what's going on."&lt;ref name="New Side" /&gt; She continues: "Tanya is still convinced she'll be fine, but then she finds out that the cancer has begun to spread. Tanya's really vulnerable at that point and it's Lauren who's saying, 'We're going to fix this and everything will be fine'. She's there for her mum the whole time - shopping, cooking, cleaning, looking after Abi and Oscar. She really wants to help Tanya and actually enjoys the responsibility."&lt;ref name="New Side" /&gt;

===Alcoholism===
In January 2012, Jossa praised her storyline in which Lauren starts [[binge drinking]] due to the stress of her mother suffering from cancer. Jossa commented on the storyline saying that teenagers should take binge drinking more seriously.&lt;ref name="Binge Drinking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jossa: Take teen drinking seriously |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5jVwwQ2HNCRn7HrBOSqEczbIpwNXg?docId=N0099971327406389394A |work=[[Google News]] |publisher=[[The Press Association]] |accessdate=12 February 2012 |date=24 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65OkAg9iK?url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5jVwwQ2HNCRn7HrBOSqEczbIpwNXg?docId=N0099971327406389394A |archivedate=12 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She said: "It's good ''EastEnders'' have done the storyline. It highlights that teenagers who people label irresponsible could be doing it to deal with worries they are keeping to themselves. What they actually need is help or someone to talk to. At first to Lauren drinking was a laugh. Then it became a way of forgetting - she has carried the burden of keeping her mum's illness secret."&lt;ref name="Binge Drinking" /&gt; Speaking about Lauren's love life, Jossa added: "I always want Lauren and Fatboy to get together. They would make such a cute couple."&lt;ref name="Binge Drinking" /&gt;

Jossa predicted in November 2012 that Lauren will revert to her old ways after her latest relationship break-up.&lt;ref name=Setback&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' Jacqueline Jossa expects Lauren alcohol setback|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a439946/eastenders-jacqueline-jossa-expects-lauren-alcohol-setback.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=9 December 2012|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if Lauren would start drinking again, Jossa said that Lauren did not really stop and that alcohol is her "comfort blanket".&lt;ref name=Setback /&gt; Executive Producer [[Lorraine Newman]] said that Lauren's binge drinking will "come to a head" in Spring 2013.&lt;ref name="Newman Troubled"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodacre|first=Kate|title='EastEnders' Lauren Branning is very troubled, says executive producer|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a447872/eastenders-lauren-branning-is-very-troubled-says-executive-producer.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman commented "Lauren's obviously very troubled. A huge amount of what we're seeing now is to do with what's been going on with her parents for such a long time. It's a tough one covering the issue of binge drinking because inevitably, in order for it to have sufficient impact, it has to go on for a considerable amount of time. There's a real danger that it will become unpalatable and that you won't have too much empathy for the character."&lt;ref name="Newman Troubled" /&gt; Newman also added that the binge drinking storyline will come to a conclusion in 2013.&lt;ref name="Newman Troubled" /&gt;

In March 2013, it was revealed that Lauren is to have her drink spiked by her friend Lucy Beale.&lt;ref name="Spiked"&gt;{{cite web|last=Daniels|first=Colin|title='EastEnders' Lauren Branning 'has drink spiked'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a469580/eastenders-lauren-branning-has-drink-spiked.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauren gave up her binge drinking to save her relationship with Joey but Lucy cannot stand seeing them happy together and decides she wants Joey back after a brief fling.&lt;ref name=Spiked /&gt; Lucy spikes Lauren's drink and Lauren becomes extremely drunk and makes a fool of herself.&lt;ref name=Spiked /&gt; Joey dumps Lauren as he thinks she has drinking behind her back and Lauren's life spirals out of control.&lt;ref name=Spiked /&gt; An insider told the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' "It's going to be emotional to watch Lauren go through it all again as she's already been through so many battles with the bottle."&lt;ref name=Spiked /&gt; Hetti Bywater said that she will continue her scheming until she gets Joey back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|title='EastEnders' Hetti Bywater: 'Lucy will keep scheming until she gets Joey'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a473840/eastenders-hetti-bywater-lucy-will-keep-scheming-until-she-gets-joey.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Joey Branning===
In September 2012, Alison Rowley of ''Digital Spy'' said that Lauren will fall in love with her cousin [[Joey Branning]] ([[David Witts]]).&lt;ref name="Joey Love"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowley|first=Alison|title='EastEnders': Lauren Branning falls for cousin Joey|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a404754/eastenders-lauren-branning-falls-for-cousin-joey.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=9 September 2012|date=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ''EastEnders'' insider told the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' that it will be a huge storyline across the autumn.&lt;ref name="Joey Love" /&gt; The insider said "Lauren hits the booze and shows her vulnerable side to Joey. He's there for her and feels very protective. The more time they spend together the more they start to realise their feelings for each other are not just that of cousins."&lt;ref name="Joey Love" /&gt; As the chemistry between the pair intensifies, they try to hide the relationship from their parents. The insider said that it is a powerful force and that the attraction between them is so strong that it will take something huge to "stop them jumping into bed".&lt;ref name="Joey Love" /&gt; Daniel Kilkelly later revealed that Lauren and Joey will be in a "horrifying" car crash.&lt;ref name="Car Crash"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' car crash details revealed|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a405239/eastenders-car-crash-details-revealed.html#article_continue|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=11 September 2012|date=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming for scenes begun on 10 September and is thought that the on-location filming will continue through the week.&lt;ref name="Car Crash" /&gt; The details of the storyline are being kept under wraps but the ''Daily Mail'' reports that Lauren will joyride her uncle [[Derek Branning]]'s ([[Jamie Foreman]]) car but it goes horribly wrong and their lives are left hanging in the balance when Lauren loses control of the car and goes through a shop window.&lt;ref name="Car Crash" /&gt; An insider commented "Everyone is really excited about these scenes. It's going to be a huge storyline for us in a few weeks' time, so it's definitely one for the fans to watch out for."&lt;ref name="Car Crash" /&gt; The storyline will reportedly air in November 2012 and is said to be one of the show's biggest moments of the year.&lt;ref name="Car Crash" /&gt;

Lauren is later dumped by Joey after Derek blackmails him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Lauren and Joey face terrible danger|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a438899/lauren-and-joey-face-terrible-danger.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=21 November 2012|date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witts said that Joey will find life "really hard" after dumping Lauren.&lt;ref name="Joey dump"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' David Witts: 'It's hard for Joey to dump Lauren'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a439869/eastenders-david-witts-its-hard-for-joey-to-dump-lauren.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=21 November 2012|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derek suggests to Joey that if he tells the police that he was driving the car that drunken Lauren crashed, she can avoid a prison sentence.&lt;ref name="Joey dump" /&gt; Joey agrees to the deception to help Lauren but is later horrified when Derek threatens to tell the police the truth unless he gets his own way.&lt;ref name="Joey dump" /&gt; Speaking to ''[[Soaplife]]'', Witts said "Joey must either move in with Derek and be a respectful and loving son, or dump Lauren. If Joey takes either of those options, Derek won't tell the police that Lauren was driving the car. Joey's love for Lauren is massive, but not quite as massive as his hatred for Derek. He decides to become the villain and lie that he never loved her. He'll take the flack because that will make it easier for her to move on without him."&lt;ref name="Joey dump" /&gt; Witts also added that it will be "really hard" as he keeps making out to Lauren that he is not interested.&lt;ref name="Joey dump" /&gt; Witts also said that Joey would be making a mistake if he told Lauren about Derek's blackmail.&lt;ref name="Joey dump" /&gt; He commented "She's very headstrong and she'd say that she doesn't care about getting into trouble with the law. It would all end in tears. Everyone would find out as Lauren's the sort of person who'd blurt everything out, and it would cause even more of a mess. Joey very much thinks he's doing the right thing."&lt;ref name="Joey dump" /&gt; Tony Discipline said that he does not mind watching Jossa's, his real-life girlfriend's scenes and that he supports the Joey and Lauren plot commenting "I don't find it strange to watch - it is part of the job. We always support each other and Jacqueline always asks me how it looks. But it is part of our job."&lt;ref name="Discipline Support"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' Tony Discipline: 'I support Lauren, Joey plot'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a444856/eastenders-tony-discipline-i-support-lauren-joey-plot.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Departure ===
On 10 September 2017, it was announced that Jossa had been axed from the show by executive consultant [[John Yorke (producer)|John Yorke]], along with [[Lorna Fitzgerald]]. An official spokesperson said: "We can confirm Jacqueline and Lorna will be leaving. They have been wonderful to work with and we wish them all the best for the future."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1893">'''Lieven Gevaert''' ([[Antwerp]], 28 May 1868 – [[The Hague]], 2 February 1935) was a [[Flanders|Flemish]] industrialist. His father died when he was only three years old. He started his career in the company he founded together with his mother in 1889, which produced photographic paper according to traditional methods. In 1894, he founded the company [[Gevaert &amp; Co]], which in 1920, was transformed to [[N.V Gevaert Photo-producten]], merged in 1964 with Agfa AG to become Gevaert-Agfa NV and later [[Agfa-Gevaert]] NV.

Already at an early age, he felt socially responsible and wanted to advance the status of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in Belgium. His personal ideas were strongly influenced by the social encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891) and the writings of [[Lodewijk De Raet]]. He supported several [[Flanders|Flemish]] initiatives as a manager, but stayed outside politics. His main objectives were the introduction of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as a business language, and the foundation of a sound Dutch-speaking education as a means to establish a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] elite. In 1926, when the ''Vlaamsch Handelsverbond'' ([[Vlaams Economisch Verbond]], VEV) was founded, Gevaert was its first chairman. Later, he founded the Sint-Lievenscollege in Antwerp, where he lived on [[Belgiëlei]].

He came to prominence in 2006 after appearing on the [[Channel 4]] series ''[[Rock School]]'', which saw [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] vocalist and bassist [[Gene Simmons]] make a rock band at Lil' Chris' school. Later that year he released the single "[[Checkin' It Out]]", which charted at number 3, and a [[Lil' Chris (album)|self-titled album]]. In 2008 he hosted his own series, ''[[Everybody Loves Lil' Chris]]''. He took his own life in March 2015 at his home in [[Lowestoft]] after a period of depression.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/lil-chris-found-hanging-at-his-home-by-a-friend-following-battle-with-depression-inquest-hears-10212505.html 'Lil Chris 'found hanging at his home by a friend' following battle with depression, inquest hears' - [[The Independent]] 29 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-32512624 'Singer Lil' Chris died by hanging, inquest hears' - [[BBC News]] 29 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hardman was born in [[Lowestoft]], [[Suffolk]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestry.co.uk/cgi-bin/sse.dll?rank=1&amp;new=1&amp;MSAV=1&amp;gss=angs-g&amp;gsfn=Christopher+James+&amp;gsln=Hardman&amp;msbdy=1990&amp;msbpn__ftp=Lowestoft%2c+Suffolk%2c+England&amp;msbpn=87552&amp;msbpn_PInfo=8-%7c0%7c0%7c3257%7c3251%7c0%7c0%7c0%7c5285%7c87552%7c0%7c&amp;cpxt=1&amp;catBucket=rstp&amp;uidh=rc8&amp;cp=11&amp;pcat=ROOT_CATEGORY&amp;h=14275731&amp;recoff=3+4+5&amp;db=ONSBirth84&amp;indiv=1&amp;ml_rpos=1 England and Wales Birth Index 1916-2005 - Christopher James Hardman - [[Ancestry.com]] - pay to view]&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Ian Hardman, a slaughterhouse worker, and Karen Elizabeth Hardman (née Clarke), a supermarket worker.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt; He had an older  sister, Hannah, and a younger brother, Nathan.

He gained the nickname 'Lil' Chris' because his height was 4'11" at age 15. He was the shortest boy in his year at [[East Point Academy|Kirkley High School]].&lt;ref name=Perrone&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/lil-chris-graduate-of-televisions-rock-school-whose-star-burned-brightly-for-a-few-years-10137189.html  Perrone, Pierre 'Lil' Chris: Graduate of television's 'Rock School' whose star burned brightly for a few years' - ''[[The Independent]]'' 28 March 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===''Rock School''===
Hardman rose to prominence in January 2006 at the age of 15 after appearing in series two of [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Rock School]]''.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lusher |first=Adam |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510864/Chris-is-a-David-in-a-Goliath-world.html |title='Chris is a David in a Goliath world' |publisher=Telegraph |date=19 February 2006 |accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show saw [[Gene Simmons]] (from the band [[Kiss (band)|KISS]]) try to form a [[Rock music|rock]] [[Musical ensemble|band]] out of a class of children attending [[Kirkley High School]] (now [[East Point Academy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/music/microsites/R/rockschool/index.html |title=Music |publisher=Channel 4 |date= |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the series, Hardman was immediately seen as a contender for the band after revealing that he could sing, play guitar, drum and write songs. Eventually Hardman was selected as frontman and lead singer in the line-up for the group (now named "Hoax UK" after the slogan on Hardman's  [[cap]]). In the final episode the group went on to open for [[Judas Priest]], [[Rob Zombie]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] at a concert in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[California]].&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--lead container name--&gt;Rock School: after graduation |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/suffolk/content/articles/2006/05/09/chris_hardman_upraw_first_releases_feature.shtml |title=Suffolk – Entertainment – Rock School: after graduation |publisher=BBC |date=25 September 2006 |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solo career===
A week after the performance, Hardman was contacted by record producers [[Ray Hedges]] and Nigel Butler, who appeared in ''Rock School'' to help the class with songwriting. Hardman went on to sign a record contract with [[RCA Records]] and released his debut single "[[Checkin' It Out]]" in September 2006 which reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; After performing a cover of [[Justin Timberlake]]'s "[[SexyBack]]" on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Live Lounge]], Hardman then released his debut album ''[[Lil' Chris (album)|Lil' Chris]]'' in December 2006. On 14 October 2006 he appeared in the Big Gig at [[Wembley Arena]] before 20,000 [[Girl Guides]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.last.fm/event/1424604+Girlguiding+UK+Big+Gig+2006   The Big Gig 2006 on the Last.fm website]&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to promote and release singles from his album throughout 2007, as well as performing as a supporting act for [[McFly]] on their 24 date ''Up Close and Personal'' tour throughout the UK. Hardman also took part in [[BBC Three]]'s ''[[Celebrity Scissorhands]]'' and made guest appearances in episodes of [[CBBC]]'s ''[[SMart]]'' and ''[[TMi]]''. He also appeared on the ''[[The Weakest Link (UK game show)|Weakest Link]]'' in 2007 but refused to sing in front of [[Anne Robinson]] when asked by the hostess. He was voted off in round 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=andiee2990|title=The Weakest Link - Celebrity Edition - Part 4|date=22 January 2008|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pSxOG_6TUI|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More television work followed in 2008, including appearances on ''[[Hider in the House]]'', ''[[Dani's House]]'' and ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]''. Hardman also compered the [[4Music]] stage of the [[T4 on the Beach]] music festival in July 2008. In October and November 2008 (after a successful pilot earlier in the year) he hosted ''[[Everybody Loves Lil' Chris]]'' on the [[T4 (Channel 4)|T4]] strand of Channel 4 on Saturday mornings. The show was a mixture of celebrity interviews, live music performances and various 'challenges' that he undertook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a131576/lil-chris-everybody-loves-lil-chris.html |title=Lil' Chris ('Everybody Loves Lil' Chris') – TV Interview |publisher=Digital Spy |date=3 October 2008 |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airing of the show coincided with the release of Hardman's second album ''[[What's It All About (Lil' Chris album)|What's It All About]]'' in October 2008. He also supported [[Alphabeat]] on their ''Wolfbaggin''' tour, throughout the UK.

Throughout 2009, Hardman made celebrity appearances as a [[DJ]], visiting various venues around the UK. These included Zanzibar Club in [[Leicester]] in May 2009, and Tramps Nightclub in [[Worcester]] in August 2009. In October 2009 Hardman made a guest appearance on the [[BBC1]] [[game show]] ''[[Hole in the Wall (UK game show)|Hole in the Wall]]'', and also featured in an episode of the second series of the [[CBBC]] comedy show ''[[Sorry, I've Got No Head]]''. During December 2009 to January 2010, he presented the making of ''Remo Skilla's'' music video, ''Stoosh'', which was posted on [[YouTube]].

From 18 June to 14 July 2012, Hardman starred in ''[[Loserville: The Musical]]'' at the [[West Yorkshire Playhouse]] in [[Leeds]] in the role of Francis Weir.&lt;ref name=loser&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loservillethemusical.com/people.php |title=Loserville : Lead Characters / Cast / Creative |location=51.510015,-0.128177 |publisher=Loservillethemusical.com |date= |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wyp.org.uk/what%27s-on/2012/loserville/ |title=Loserville |publisher=[[West Yorkshire Playhouse]] |accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical transferred to the [[Garrick Theatre]] in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] from October 2012 to January 2013, with understudy [[Ashley Luke Lloyd]] playing the role of Francis Weir for the majority of the London run due to the indisposition of Hardman.&lt;ref name=loser /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/2015/obituary-chris-hardman/ Chris Hardman Obituary - ''[[The Stage]]'' 2 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wintergardensblackpool.co.uk/news_more.asp?news_id=14 Cast Biography for Ashley Luke Lloyd - [[Winter Gardens, Blackpool|Blackpool Winter Gardens]] website - 5 November 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117215445/http://www.wintergardensblackpool.co.uk/news_more.asp?news_id=14 |date=17 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19357719 |title=Busted star's Loserville musical set for West End - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Loserville'' closed Hardman briefly worked for [[Anglian Home Improvements]], selling their products door to door in Lowestoft.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mobile.twitter.com/cjhardman/status/564958036960485377 Hardman on [[Twitter]] - 10 February 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, he announced via Twitter that he was working on a new album, his first since 2008. Hardman issued a new single for Christmas 2013 called "Christmas Number One (#FeedEmYellowSnow)" with Lloyd Wilkinson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://officialchrishardman.co.uk/studio-finishing-off-the-xmas-single-with-lloyd-wilkinson/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002042/http://officialchrishardman.co.uk/studio-finishing-off-the-xmas-single-with-lloyd-wilkinson/ |date=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and set off on a Christmas tour with Tom Mann and Giles Potter, from 2013's ''[[The X Factor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://officialchrishardman.co.uk/tour/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002440/http://officialchrishardman.co.uk/tour/ |date=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour was called The Lil' Chris-tmas tour. On 3 December 2013, the Official Chart Company listed "Christmas Number One (#FeedEmYellowSnow)" as a contender for the Christmas Number One spot on 22 December 2013,&lt;ref name=occ&gt;{{cite web|last=Lane |first=Dan |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-2013-christmas-number-1-contenders-revealed-2638 |title=The Official 2013 Christmas Number 1 contenders revealed! |publisher=Officialcharts.com |date=16 December 2013 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the single failed to chart.

In 2014 Hardman launched MAML, his own alternative clothing label incorporating his own designs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mamlattire.bigcartel.com/about-maml  Hardman's MAML Attire website]&lt;/ref&gt; The range was available for several months online and from a store in Hardman's home town of  [[Lowestoft]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.facebook.com/MAMLattire  MAML Attire - Sales Page on [[Facebook]]]&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to write new material with producer Guy Barnes, which he hoped would be released in the summer of 2014, but by this time Hardman had no management or record label or distribution in place, so it was planned to release his summer anthem 'Louder' with other songs on an [[Extended play|EP]] in 2015.&lt;ref name= Barnes&gt;Keegan, Simon (30 March 2015).

Paramedics were called to his home, but they were unable to revive him and they declared him dead at the scene.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; Suffolk Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.&lt;ref name="BBC 32038895"/&gt; Tributes were given by people such as boxer [[Anthony Ogogo]], who had attended the same [[Kirkley High School|school]], and [[Gene Simmons]].&lt;ref name="BBC 32038895"/&gt; On 29 April 2015, It was reported that the cause of death was [[suicide by hanging]].                A statement issued by his family on 30 March 2015 paid tribute to him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Chris was a huge personality who will be missed by everyone who knew him. He was a hugely creative person who used this side of his personality to make others smile, to cheer people up, and to make others feel better. If he wasn’t bringing joy through music he was telling jokes or pulling pranks. He was the sunshine on a rainy day, and could make friends the minute he walked into a room, making everyone smile with his gorgeous, cheeky face.

A real people person, he would always take the time to stop and talk, no matter who or when, and we are proud that he was so well thought of by all who knew him. So many commented on what a lovely, well brought up person he was, so polite and kind and a pleasure to know.

Chris had struggled with mental health issues and depression in recent years. He was committed to helping others find better ways of overcoming this illness and publicly said he wished to find a cure. Despite this, his concern was always his family and his friends, whose happiness was his priority."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hardman’s memorial service was held in [[Gorleston]], near his home town of [[Lowestoft]], on 8 April 2015 and was a private event for family and friends only; this short service consisted of speeches without hymns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/lil-chris-funeral-today-beloved-5479007 'Lil' Chris funeral today: Beloved Chris Hardman laid to rest in touching ceremony' - [[Daily Mirror]] - 8 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day a private funeral was held in Lowestoft.

'''Marshall Herff Applewhite Jr.''' (May&amp;nbsp;17, 1931&amp;nbsp;– March 26, 1997), also known as '''Bo''' and '''Do''',{{efn|name=dough}} among other names,{{efn|name=name}} was an American [[cult]] leader who founded what became known as the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]] religious group and organized their [[mass suicide]] in 1997, claiming the lives of thirty-nine people.

A native of [[Texas]], Applewhite attended several universities and, as a young man, served in the [[United States Army]]. After finishing school at [[Austin College]], he taught music at the [[University of Alabama]]. He later returned to Texas, where he led choruses and served as the chair of the music department at the [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)|University of St. Thomas]] in [[Houston]]. He left the school in 1970, citing emotional turmoil. His father's death a year later brought on severe depression. In 1972, he developed a close friendship with [[Bonnie Nettles]], a nurse; together, they discussed [[mysticism]] at length and concluded that they were called as divine messengers. They operated a bookstore and teaching center for a short while, and then began to travel around the U.S. in 1973 to spread their views. They only gained one convert. In 1975, Applewhite was arrested for failing to return a rental car and was jailed for six months. In jail, he further developed his theology.

After Applewhite's release, he traveled to California and Oregon with Nettles, eventually gaining a group of committed followers. Applewhite and Nettles told their followers that they would be visited by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]]s who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that he and his followers would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he came to believe that their bodies were the mere containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from [[Christian eschatology]], the [[New Age movement]], and American [[popular culture]].

The group received an influx of funds in the late 1970s, which it used to pay housing and other expenses. In 1985, Nettles died, leaving Applewhite distraught and challenging his views on physical ascension. In the early 1990s the group took more steps to publicize their theology. In 1996, they learned of the approach of [[Comet Hale–Bopp]] and rumors of an accompanying spaceship. They concluded that this spaceship was the vessel that would take their spirits on board for a journey to another planet. Believing that their souls would ascend to the spaceship and be given new bodies, the group members committed mass suicide in their mansion. A [[media circus]] followed the discovery of their bodies. In the aftermath, commentators and academics discussed how Applewhite persuaded people to follow his commands, including suicide. Some commentators attributed his followers' willingness to commit suicide to his skill as a manipulator, while others argued that their willingness was due to their faith in the narrative that he constructed.

==Early life and education==
Marshall Herff Applewhite Jr. was born in [[Spur, Texas]],{{sfn|Associated Press, March 28, 1997}} on May&amp;nbsp;17, 1931, to Marshall Herff Applewhite Sr. (1901–1971) and his wife Louise (née Winfield; 1901–1988).&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=TXbirthindex&amp;gss=angs-d&amp;new=1&amp;rank=1&amp;msT=1&amp;gsfn_x=1&amp;gsln=applewhite&amp;gsln_x=1&amp;MSAV=0&amp;uidh=ff5&amp;gl=&amp;gst=&amp;hc=50&amp;fh=50&amp;fsk=BEFpYewIgAAiTQAHYtM-61- Texas Birth Index, online at ancestry.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He had three siblings.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=355|Steinberg|1997|Harris|1997}} The son of a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], Applewhite became very religious as a child.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=355|Raine|2005|2pp=102–3}}

After leaving the University of Alabama, Applewhite moved to [[Houston]], Texas, in 1965 to teach at the [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)|University of St. Thomas]].{{sfnm|Raine|2005|1p=103|Chryssides|2005|2p=355|Zeller, "Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics"|2010|p=39}} His students regarded him as an engaging speaker and a stylish dresser.{{sfnm|Zeller|2006|1p=77|Bearak|1997}} He served as chair of the music department; he also became a locally popular singer, serving as the choral director of an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church and performing with the [[Houston Grand Opera]].{{sfnm|Zeller, "Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics"|2010|1p=39|Davis|2000|2p=245|Associated Press, March 28, 1997}} In Texas, he was briefly [[coming out|openly gay]] but also pursued a relationship with a young woman, who left him under pressure from her family, greatly upsetting him.{{sfnm|Raine|2005|1p=103|Bearak|1997}} He resigned from the University of St. Thomas in 1970, citing depression and other emotional problems.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=355|Urban|2000|2p=276}} [[Robert Balch]] and David Taylor, sociologists who studied Applewhite's group, speculate that this departure was prompted by another affair between Applewhite and a student.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2003|p=215}} The president of the university later recalled that he was often mentally jumbled and disorganized near the end of his employment.{{sfn|Hall|2000|pp=150–1}}

In 1971, Applewhite briefly moved to New Mexico, where he operated a [[delicatessen]]. He was popular with customers but decided to return to Texas later that year.{{sfnm|Hall|2000|1p=151|Bearak|1997}} His father died around that time; the loss took a significant emotional toll on him, causing severe depression.{{sfnm|Lewis|2003|1p=111|Davis|2000|2p=245}} His debts mounted, forcing him to borrow money from friends.{{sfn|Bearak|1997}}

==Introduction to Nettles and first travels==
In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an interest in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] and [[Biblical prophecy]].{{sfnm|Lewis|2003|1p=111|Raine|2005|2p=103}}{{efn|name=meetcute}} The two quickly became close friends;{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=111}} he later recalled that he felt like he had known her for a long time and concluded that they had met in a past life.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|pp=44 &amp; 48}} She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]], persuading him that he had a divine assignment.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=210}}{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=43}} By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including [[astrology]].{{sfnm|1a1=Balch|1a2=Taylor|1y=2002|1p=210|2a1=Zeller|2y=2006|2p=77}} He also had had several visions, including one in which he was told that he was chosen for a role like that of Jesus.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=210}} In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates that he had a [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic episode]] around this time.{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=102}}

Applewhite soon began to live with Nettles. Although they cohabited, their relationship was not a sexual one,{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=355}} fulfilling his longtime wish to have a deep and loving, yet [[Platonic love|platonic]], relationship.{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=50}} She was married with two children, but after she became close with Applewhite, her husband divorced her, and she lost custody of her children.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=211}} Applewhite permanently broke off contact with his family as well.{{sfn|Steinberg|1997}} He saw Nettles as his [[soulmate]], and some of his acquaintances later recalled that she had a strong influence on him.{{sfnm|1a1=Urban|1y=2000|1p=276|2a1=Balch|2a2=Taylor|2y=2002|2p=210}} Raine writes that Nettles "was responsible for reinforcing his emerging delusional beliefs",{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=103}} but psychiatrist [[Robert Jay Lifton]] speculates that Nettles' influence helped him avoid further psychological deterioration.{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=306}}

Applewhite and Nettles opened a bookstore known as the Christian Arts Center, which carried books from a variety of spiritual backgrounds.{{sfnm|Zeller, "Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics"|2010|1p=40|Hall|2000|2p=152}} They also launched a venture known as Know Place to teach classes on mysticism and theosophy.{{sfn|Zeller, "Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics"|2010|p=40}}{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=45}} They closed these businesses a short time later.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=152}} In February 1973, they resolved to travel to teach others about their beliefs and drove throughout the Southwest and Western U.S;{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|pp=355–6}}{{sfn|Lalich, "Using the Bounded Choice Model"|2004|pp=228–9}}{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', "Heaven's Gate: A Timeline"|1997}} Lifton describes their travels as a "restless, intense, often confused, peripatetic spiritual journey".{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=308}} While traveling, they had little money and occasionally resorted to selling their blood or working odd jobs for much-needed funds. They subsisted solely on bread rolls at times, often camped out, and sometimes did not pay their lodging bills.{{sfn|Bearak|1997}}{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', "Heaven's Gate: A Timeline"|1997}} One of their friends from Houston corresponded with them and agreed to accept their teachings. They visited her in May 1974, and she became their first convert.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=153}}

While traveling, Applewhite and Nettles pondered the life of [[St.&amp;nbsp;Francis of Assisi]] and read works by authors including [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[R.&amp;nbsp;D. Laing]], and [[Richard Bach]].{{sfnm|1a1=Zeller|1y=2006|1p=78|2a1=Bearak|2y=1997}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=123}} They kept a [[King James Version]] of the Bible with them and studied several passages from the [[New Testament]], focusing on teachings about [[Christology]], [[asceticism]], and [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]].{{sfn|Zeller, "Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics"|2010|pp=42–3}} Applewhite also read science fiction, including works by [[Robert A.&amp;nbsp;Heinlein]] and [[Arthur C.&amp;nbsp;Clarke]].{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=306}} By June 1974, Applewhite and Nettles' beliefs had solidified into a basic outline.{{sfn|Zeller, "Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics"|2010|p=40}} They concluded that they had been chosen to fulfill biblical prophecies, and that they had been given higher-level minds than other people.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=355}} They wrote a pamphlet that described Jesus' [[reincarnation]] as a Texan, a thinly veiled reference to Applewhite.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=211}} Furthermore, they concluded that they were the [[two witnesses]] described in the [[Book of Revelation]] and occasionally visited churches or other spiritual groups to speak of their identities,{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=356|Zeller, "Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics"|2010|2p=40}} often referring to themselves as "The Two", or "The UFO Two".{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=123}}{{sfn|Urban|2000|p=276}} They believed that they would be killed and then restored to life and, in view of others, transported onto a spaceship. This event, which they referred to as "the Demonstration", was to prove their claims.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=211}} To their dismay, these ideas were poorly received.{{sfn|Bearak|1997}}

==Arrest and proselytism==
In August 1974, Applewhite was arrested in [[Harlingen, Texas]], for failing to return a car that he had rented in Missouri.{{sfn|Bearak|1997}}{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', "Heaven's Gate: A Timeline"|1997}} He was extradited to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St.&amp;nbsp;Louis]] and jailed for six months.{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', "Heaven's Gate: A Timeline"|1997}}{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=356}} At the time, he maintained that he had been "divinely authorized" to keep the car.{{sfn|Bearak|1997}} While jailed, he pondered theology and subsequently abandoned discussion of [[occult]] topics, in favor of extraterrestrials and evolution.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=356}}

After Applewhite's release, he and Nettles resolved to contact extraterrestrials and they sought like-minded followers. They published advertisements for meetings, where they recruited disciples, whom they called "crew".{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=356}} At the events, they purported to represent beings from another planet, the Next Level, who sought participants for an experiment. They claimed that those who agreed to take part in the experiment would be brought to a higher evolutionary level.{{sfnm|Goerman|2011|1p=60|Chryssides|2005|2p=357}} He and Nettles referred to themselves as "Guinea" and "Pig".{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=357}} Applewhite described his role as a "lab instructor"{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=252}} and served as the primary speaker, while Nettles occasionally interjected clarifying remarks or corrections.{{sfnm|Lifton|2000|1p=307|Balch|1995|2p=154}} The two seldom personally spoke with attendees, only taking phone numbers with which they could contact them.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2003|p=213}} They initially named their organization the Anonymous Sexaholics Celibate Church, but it soon became known as the Human Individual Metamorphosis.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|pp=356–7}}

Applewhite believed in the [[ancient astronaut]] hypothesis, which claimed that extraterrestrials had visited humanity in the past and placed humans on Earth and would return to collect a select few.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=117}} Parts of this teaching bear similarities to the [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] Christian concept of [[Unconditional election|election]], likely owing to Applewhite's Presbyterian upbringing.{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=53}} He often discussed extraterrestrials using phrases from ''[[Star Trek]]'' and stated that aliens communicated with him through the show.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1pp=359–62|Lifton|2000|2p=321}}

Applewhite and Nettles sent advertisements to groups in California and were invited to speak to [[New Age]] devotees there in April 1975.{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', "Heaven's Gate: A Timeline"|1997}}{{sfnm|1a1=Bearak|1y=1997|2a1=Partridge|2y=2006|2p=51}} At this meeting, they persuaded about half of the 50 attendees to follow them.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=129}} They also focused on college campuses, speaking at [[Cañada College]] in August.{{sfn|Lalich, "Using the Bounded Choice Model"|2004|pp=228–9}}{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', "Heaven's Gate: A Timeline"|1997}} At a meeting in Oregon in September 1975, they saw further recruitment success—about 30 people left their homes to follow the pair, prompting interest from media outlets.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=104}} The coverage was negative: commentators and some former members mocked the group and leveled accusations of [[brainwashing]] against Applewhite and Nettles. Balch and Taylor state that Applewhite and Nettles eschewed pressure tactics, seeking only devoted followers.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|pp=213–4}}

Benjamin E.&amp;nbsp;Zeller, an academic who studies new religions, notes that Applewhite and Nettles' teachings focused on salvation through individual growth and sees this as similar to currents in the era's New Age movement. Likewise, the importance of personal choice was also emphasized.{{sfn|Zeller|2006|pp=82–3}} Applewhite and Nettles denied connection with the New Age movement, viewing it as a human creation.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=31}} [[Janja Lalich]], a sociologist who studies cults, attributes their recruitment success to their eclectic mix of beliefs and the way that they deviate from typical New Age teachings: discussing literal spaceships while retaining familiar language.{{sfn|Lalich, "Using the Bounded Choice Model"|2004|pp=229–31}}{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=64}} Most of their disciples were young and interested in occultism or otherwise lived outside of mainstream society.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2003|1p=104|2a1=Balch|2a2=Taylor|2y=2002|2p=213}} They came from a variety of religious backgrounds, including [[Eastern religion]]s and [[Scientology]].{{sfn|Lalich, "Using the Bounded Choice Model"|2004|pp=228–9}} Most were well versed in New Age teachings, allowing Applewhite and Nettles to convert them easily.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=118}} Applewhite thought that his followers would reach a higher level of being, changing like a [[caterpillar]] becoming a [[butterfly]];{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=106}} this example was used in almost all of their early literature.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=125}} Applewhite contended that this would be a "biological change into a different species, casting his teachings as scientific truth in line with secular naturalism."{{sfn|Zeller, "Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics"|2010|p=41}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|pp=117 &amp; 122}} He emphasized to his early followers that he was not speaking metaphorically, often using the words "biology" and "chemistry" in his statements.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|pp=127 &amp; 130}} By the mid-1970s, he attempted to avoid the use of the term "religion", seeing it as inferior to science.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=129}} Although he dismissed religion as unscientific, he sometimes emphasized the need for faith in the aliens' abilities to transform them.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|pp=131, 133–4 &amp; 136}}

==Nomadic lifestyle==
[[File:Ottheinrich Folio289r Rev6B.jpg|thumb|upright|A depiction of a scene from the [[Book of Revelation]], which Applewhite believed described interactions between humans and extraterrestrials]]
By 1975, Applewhite and Nettles had taken the names "Bo" and "Peep".{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=357}} They had about 70&amp;nbsp;followers and saw themselves as shepherds tending a flock.{{sfnm|1a1=Balch|1a2=Taylor|1y=2002|1p=213|2a1=Bearak|2y=1997}} Applewhite believed that complete separation from Earthly desires was a prerequisite of [[Ascension (mystical)|ascension]] to the Next Level and emphasized passages in the New Testament in which Jesus spoke about forsaking worldly attachments.{{sfnm|1a1=Balch|1a2=Taylor|1y=2002|1p=211|2a1=Zeller, "Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics"|2y=2010|2p=45}} Members were consequently instructed to renounce: friends, family, media, drugs, alcohol, jewelry, facial hair, and sexuality.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=357}} Furthermore, they were required to adopt biblical names. Applewhite and Nettles soon told them to adopt two-syllable names that ended in "ody" and had three consonants in the first syllable,{{sfn|Lalich, "Using the Bounded Choice Model"|2004|pp=232–5}} such as Rkkody, Jmmody, and Lvvody;{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=219}} Applewhite stated that these names emphasized that his followers were spiritual children.{{sfn|Lalich, "Using the Bounded Choice Model"|2004|pp=232–5}} Applewhite, Nettles, and their followers lived what religious scholar [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James Lewis]] describes as a "quasi-nomadic lifestyle".{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=111}} They usually stayed at remote campgrounds and did not speak about their beliefs.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=213}} Applewhite and Nettles ceased having public meetings in April 1975,{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', "Heaven's Gate: A Timeline"|1997}} and spent little time teaching doctrine to their converts.{{sfn|Wessinger|2000|p=234}} The leaders also had little contact with their dispersed followers, many of whom renounced their allegiance.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=357}}

Applewhite and Nettles feared that they would be assassinated,{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=111}} and taught their followers that their deaths would be similar to those of the two witnesses of the Book of Revelation.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=114}}{{efn|name=rev11}} Balch and Taylor believe that Applewhite's prison experience and early rejection by audiences contributed to this fear.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=212}} Applewhite and Nettles later explained to their followers that the former's treatment by the press was a form of assassination and had fulfilled their prophecy.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=215}} Applewhite took a [[materialism|materialistic]] view of the Bible, seeing it as a record of extraterrestrial contact with humanity.{{sfn|Zeller, "Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics"|2010|pp=38 &amp; 43}} He drew heavily from the Book of Revelation, although he avoided traditional theological terminology and took a somewhat negative tone towards Christianity.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|pp=359–62}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|pp=124 &amp; 133}} He only lectured about a small number of verses and never tried to develop a system of theology.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=365}}

By early 1976, Applewhite and Nettles had settled on the names "Do" and "Ti";{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=357}} Applewhite stated that these were meaningless names.{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=51}} In June 1976, they gathered their remaining followers at [[Medicine Bow National Forest]] in Southeastern Wyoming, promising a UFO visit.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=357|Bearak|1997}} Nettles later announced that the visit had been cancelled. Applewhite and Nettles then split their followers into small groups, which they referred to as "Star Clusters".{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=357}}

From 1976 to 1979, the group lived in campgrounds, usually in the [[Rocky Mountains]] or Texas.{{sfn|Bearak|1997}} Applewhite and Nettles began to place greater demands on their followers' heretofore loosely structured lives, which improved membership retention.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=246}} They typically communicated with their disciples in writing or through assistants.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2003|p=230}} Increasingly, they emphasized that they were the only source of truth—the idea that members could receive individual revelations was rejected in an attempt to prevent schisms.{{sfnm|1a1=Zeller|1y=2006|1p=84|2a1=Balch|2a2=Taylor|2y=2002|2p=226}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=137}} Applewhite also sought to prevent close friendships among his followers, fearing that this could lead to insubordination.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=257}} Applewhite and Nettles insisted that their followers practice what they referred to as "flexibility": strict obedience to their often shifting requests.{{sfn|Davis|2000|pp=246 &amp; 255}} The two leaders limited the group's contacts with those outside the movement, even some who may have been interested in joining, ostensibly to prevent infiltration from hostile parties. In practice, this made their followers completely dependent upon them.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=248}} Applewhite instructed his disciples to be like children or pets in their submission—their sole responsibility was to obey their leaders.{{sfn|Davis|2000|pp=251 &amp; 7}} Members were encouraged to constantly seek Applewhite's advice and often ask themselves what their leaders would do when making a decision.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=216}} To his followers, he did not seem dictatorial:{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=259}} many of them found him laid back and fatherly.{{sfnm|Lifton|2000|1pp=309–10|Lalich, "Using the Bounded Choice Model"|2004|2pp=233–5}} In his 2000 study of the group, Winston Davis states that Applewhite mastered the "fine art of religious entertainment", noting that many of his disciples seemed to enjoy their service.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=259}} Applewhite organized seemingly arbitrary rituals that were intended to instill a sense of discipline in his followers; he referred to these tasks as "games".{{sfn|Balch|1995|p=156}} He also watched science-fiction television programs with the rest of the group.{{sfn|Daniels|1999|p=210}} Rather than issue direct commands, he attempted to express his preferences and nominally offer his disciples a choice.{{sfn|Lalich, "Using the Bounded Choice Model"|2004|pp=232–5}} He emphasized that students were free to disobey if they chose, in what Lalich dubs the "illusion of choice".{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=83}}

==Housing and control==
In the late 1970s, the group received a large sum of money, possibly an inheritance of a member or donations of followers' income.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=357|Bearak|1997}} This capital was used to rent houses, initially in [[Denver]] and later in [[Dallas]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}} Applewhite and Nettles had about 40&amp;nbsp;followers then and lived in two or three houses: the leaders usually had their own house.{{sfn|Bearak|1997}} The group was secretive about their lifestyle, covering their windows.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}} Applewhite and Nettles arranged their followers' lifestyles as a [[Recruit training|boot camp]] that would prepare them for the Next Level. Referring to their house as a "craft", they regimented the lives of their disciples to the minute.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=216}} Students who were not committed to this lifestyle were encouraged to leave; departing members were given financial assistance.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=216}} Lifton states that Applewhite wanted "quality over quantity" in his followers, although he occasionally spoke about gaining many converts.{{sfn|Lifton|2000|pp=309 &amp; 320}}

Applewhite and Nettles sometimes made sudden, drastic changes to the group.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=365}} On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|pp=216–7}} Lalich sees this as a way that they increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=90}} Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.{{sfn|Lifton|2000|pp=308–9}}

In 1980, Applewhite and Nettles had about 80&amp;nbsp;followers,{{sfn|Zeller|2006|p=91}} many of whom held jobs, often working with computers or as car mechanics.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}} In 1982, Applewhite and Nettles allowed their disciples to call their families.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=217}} They further relaxed their control in 1983, permitting their followers to visit relatives on [[Mother's Day]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}} They were only allowed short stays and were instructed to tell their families that they were studying computers at a [[monastery]]. These vacations were intended to placate families by demonstrating that the disciples remained with the group of their own accord.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=217}}

==Nettles' death==
In 1983, Nettles had an eye surgically removed as a result of cancer diagnosed several years earlier. She lived for two more years, dying in 1985. Applewhite told their followers that she had "traveled to the Next Level" because she had "too much energy to remain on Earth", abandoning her body to make the journey.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}}{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=217}} His attempt to explain her death in the terms of the group's doctrine was successful, preventing the departure of all but one member. Applewhite became very depressed.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=217}} He claimed that Nettles still communicated with him, but he suffered from a crisis of faith. His students supported him during this time, greatly encouraging him.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=218}} He then organized a ceremony in which he symbolically married his followers; Lalich views this as an attempt to ensure unity.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=92}} Applewhite told his followers that he had been left behind by Nettles because he still had more to learn—he felt that she occupied "a higher spiritual role" than he did.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=92}}{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=214}} He began identifying her as "the Father" and often referred to her with [[Gender-specific and gender-neutral pronouns|male pronouns]].{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=62}}{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=78}}

Applewhite began to emphasize a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as he needed the guidance of the Next Level. Zeller notes that this naturally ensured that there would be no possibility of the group's continuing if Applewhite were to die.{{sfn|Zeller|2006|p=88}} A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation;{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=56}} he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ.{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=62}} Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator.{{sfn|Zeller|2006|p=88}} Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but, in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=138}}

After Nettles' death, Applewhite also altered his view of ascension: previously, he had taught that the group would physically ascend from the Earth and that death caused reincarnation, but her death—which left behind an unchanged, corporeal body—forced him to say that the ascension could be spiritual.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2003|1p=113|2a1=Balch|2a2=Taylor|2y=2002|2p=209}} He then concluded that her spirit had traveled to a spaceship and received a new body and that he and his followers would do the same.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=113}} In his view, the Biblical heaven was actually a planet on which highly evolved beings dwelt, and physical bodies were required to ascend there.{{sfnm|1a1=Balch|1a2=Taylor|1y=2002|1p=209|2a1=Zeller, "Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics"|2y=2010|2p=44}} Applewhite believed that once they reached the Next Level, they would facilitate evolution on other planets.{{sfn|Wessinger|2000|p=233}} He emphasized that Jesus, whom he believed was an extraterrestrial, came to Earth, was killed, and bodily rose from the dead before being transported onto a spaceship.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=106}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=126}} According to Applewhite's doctrine, Jesus was a gateway to heaven but had found humanity unready to ascend when he first came to the Earth.{{sfnm|Raine|2005|1p=106|Woodward|1997}} Applewhite then decided that there was an opportunity for humans to reach the Next Level "every two millennia", and the early 1990s would therefore provide the first opportunity to reach the Kingdom of Heaven since the time of Jesus.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=363}} Zeller notes that his beliefs were based on the Christian Bible but were interpreted through the lens of belief in alien contact with humanity.{{sfn|Zeller, "Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics"|2010|p=35}}

Applewhite taught that he was a [[walk-in]], a concept that had gained popularity in the New Age movement during the late 1970s. Walk-ins were said to be higher beings who took control of adult bodies to teach humanity. This concept informed Applewhite's view of resurrection: he believed that his group's souls were to be transported to a spaceship, where they would enter other bodies.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=114–6}} Applewhite abandoned the metaphor of a butterfly in favor of describing the body as a mere container,{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=107}} a vehicle that souls could enter and exit.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=141}} This dualism may have been the product of the Christology that Applewhite learned as a young man;{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=59}} Lewis writes that the group's teachings had "Christian elements [that] were basically grafted on to a New Age matrix".{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=106}} In a profile of the group for ''[[Newsweek]]'', Kenneth Woodward compares his dualism to that of ancient [[Christian Gnosticism]], although Peters notes that his theology departs from Gnosticism by privileging the physical world.{{sfnm|Peters|2003|1p=247|Woodward|1997}}

In the wake of Nettles' death, Applewhite became increasingly paranoid, fearing a conspiracy against his group.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=226}} One member who joined in the mid-1980s recalled that Applewhite avoided new converts, worrying that they were infiltrators.{{sfn|Miller|1997}} He feared a government raid on their home and spoke highly of the Jewish defenders of [[Masada]] in ancient Israel who showed total resistance to the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Zeller|2011|p=186}} Increasingly, he began to discuss the Apocalypse,{{sfn|Zeller|2006|pp=85–6}} comparing the Earth to an overgrown garden that was to be recycled or [[Reboot (computing)|rebooted]] and humanity to a failed experiment.{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1pp=358 &amp; 366|Grünschloß|2003|2p=28}} In accordance with the garden metaphor, he stated that the Earth would be "spaded under".{{sfn|Goerman|2011|p=61}} Woodward notes that Applewhite's teaching about the Earth's recycling is similar to the cyclical perspective of time found in Buddhism.{{sfn|Woodward|1997}} Applewhite also utilized New Age concepts,{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=106}} but he differed from that movement by predicting that apocalyptic, rather than utopian, changes would soon occur on Earth.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=118}} He contended that most humans had been brainwashed by [[Lucifer]], but that his followers could break free of this control.{{sfnm|Raine|2005|1p=114|Davis|2000|2p=244}} He specifically cited sexual urges as the work of Lucifer.{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=108}} In addition, he stated that there were evil extraterrestrials, whom he referred to as "Luciferians", who sought to thwart his mission.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}} He argued that many prominent moral teachers and advocates of [[political correctness]] were actually Luciferians.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=250}} This theme emerged in 1988, possibly in response to the lurid [[alien abduction]] stories that were proliferating at the time.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=218}}

==Obscurity and evangelism==
In the late 1980s, the group kept a low profile; few people knew it still existed.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=218}} In 1988, they mailed a document that detailed their beliefs to a variety of New Age organizations.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=219}} The mailing contained information about their history and advised people to read several books, which primarily focused on Christian history and UFOs.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=143}}{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=102}} With the exception of the 1988 document, Applewhite's group remained inconspicuous until 1992,{{sfnm|Zeller, "Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics"|2010|1p=41|Chryssides|2005|2p=358}} when they recorded a 12-part video series which was broadcast via satellite.{{sfnm|1a1=Zeller|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=Balch|2a2=Taylor|2y=2002|2p=219}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=149}} This series echoed many of the teachings of the 1988 update, although it introduced a "universal mind" of which its hearers could partake.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=150}}{{sfn|Peters|2003|p=247}}

Over the course of the group's existence, several hundred people joined and left.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=42}} In the early 1990s, their membership dwindled, numbering as few as 26;{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=220}} these defections gave Applewhite a sense of urgency.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=219}} In May 1993, the group took the name "Total Overcomers Anonymous". They then spent $30,000 to publish a full-page advertisement in ''[[USA Today]]'' that warned of catastrophic judgment to befall the Earth.{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', "Heaven's Gate: A Timeline"|1997}}{{sfnm|1a1=Chryssides|1y=2005|1p=358|2a1=Balch|2a2=Taylor|2y=2002|2p=219}} Its publication led about 20&amp;nbsp;former members to rejoin the group.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}} This, along with a series of public lectures in 1994, caused membership to double from its nadir at the beginning of the decade.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=220}} By this time, Applewhite did not regiment his disciples' lives as strictly as he had and spent less time with them.{{sfn|Miller|1997}}{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=95}}

In the early 1990s, Applewhite posted some of his teachings on the Internet, but he was stung by the resulting criticism.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=260}} That year, he first spoke of the possibility of suicide as a way to reach the Next Level.{{sfn|Wessinger|2000|p=238}} He explained that everything "human" had to be forsaken, including the human body, before one could ascend.{{sfn|Zeller|2006|p=87}} The organization was then renamed "Heaven's Gate".{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=113}} Davis speculates that this rejection may have encouraged him to attempt to leave Earth.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=260}}

From June to October 1995, the group lived in a rural part of New Mexico.{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', "Heaven's Gate: A Timeline"|1997}}{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=113}} They purchased {{convert|40|acre|sqkm}} and built a compound—which they referred to as the "Earth ship"—using tires and lumber;{{sfnm|Urban|2000|1p=276|Raine|2005|2p=113}} Applewhite hoped to establish a monastery.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=220}} This proved to be a difficult endeavor, particularly for the aging Applewhite:{{sfn|Raine|2005|p=113}} he was in poor health and, at one point, feared that he had cancer.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=221}} Lifton notes that Applewhite's active leadership of the group probably led to severe fatigue in his last years.{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=311}} The winter was very cold, and they abandoned the plan.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=220}} Afterwards, they lived in several houses in the [[San Diego]] area.{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', "Heaven's Gate: A Timeline"|1997}}

The group increasingly focused on the suppression of sexual desire; Applewhite and seven others opted for [[surgical castration]].{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}} They initially had difficulty finding a willing surgeon, but eventually found one in [[Mexico]].{{sfnm|Lifton|2000|p=305|Jones|2007}} In Applewhite's view, sexuality was one of the most powerful forces that bound humans to their bodies and thus hindered their efforts to evolve to the Next Level; he taught that Next Level beings had no [[reproductive organs]] but that Luciferian beings had [[gender]]s.{{sfnm|Urban|2000|1p=286|Grünschloß|2003|2p=26}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=145}} He also cited a verse in the New Testament that said there would not be marriage in heaven.{{sfn|Wessinger|2000|p=239}}{{efn|name=angels}} In addition, he required members to adopt similar clothing and haircuts, possibly to reinforce that they were a non-sexual family.{{sfn|Raine|2005|pp=109–10}}

==Mass suicide==
[[File:Comet Hale-Bopp Death Valley.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Comet Hale–Bopp]] over California in April 1997]]
In October 1996, the group rented a mansion in [[Rancho Santa Fe, California]].{{sfn|''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', "Heaven's Gate: A Timeline"|1997}}{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}} That year, they recorded two video messages in which they offered their viewers a "last chance to evacuate Earth".{{sfn|Zeller|2006|p=86}} Around the same time, they learned of the approach of [[Comet Hale–Bopp]].{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=358}} Applewhite now believed that Nettles was aboard a spaceship trailing the comet, and that she planned to rendezvous with them.{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=60}} He told his followers that the vessel would transport them to an [[empyrean]] destination, and that there was a government conspiracy to suppress word of the craft.{{sfnm|1a1=Balch|1a2=Taylor|1y=2002|1p=209|2a1=Zeller|2y=2011|2p=177}} In addition, he stated that his deceased followers would be taken by the vessel as well, a belief that resembled the Christian [[pretribulation rapture]] doctrine.{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=61}} It is not known how he learned of the comet or why he believed that it was accompanied by extraterrestrials or why he should have believed the dead Nettles would be with them.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}}{{efn|name=art}}

In late March 1997, the group isolated themselves and recorded farewell statements.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=359}} Many members praised Applewhite in their final messages;{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=98}} Davis describes their remarks as "regurgitations of Do's gospel".{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=243}} Applewhite recorded a video shortly before his death, in which he termed the suicides the "final exit" of the group and remarked, "We do in all honesty hate this world".{{sfnm|Urban|2000|1p=279|Partridge|2006|2p=55}} Lewis speculates that Applewhite settled on suicide because he had said that the group would ascend during his lifetime and thus appointing a successor was unfeasible.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=113}}

Religious scholar [[Catherine Wessinger]] posits that the suicides began on March&amp;nbsp;22.{{sfn|Wessinger|2000|p=230}} Most members took [[barbiturate]]s and alcohol and then placed bags over their heads. They wore [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes and black uniforms with patches that read "Heaven's Gate [[Away team (Star Trek term)|Away Team]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Balch|1a2=Taylor|1y=2002|1p=209|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|2p=27}} A bag that contained a few dollars and a form of identification was placed beside most bodies.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=27}} The deaths occurred over three days; Applewhite was one of the last four to die. Three assistants helped him commit suicide, then killed themselves.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=224}} An anonymous tip led the sheriff's department to search the mansion;{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=28}} they found 39 bodies there on March&amp;nbsp;26.{{sfnm|Lewis|2003|p=103|Associated Press, March 28, 1997}} It was the largest group suicide involving U.S. citizens since the 1978 mass suicide of 920 Americans in [[Jonestown]], [[Guyana]].{{sfnm|Wessinger|2000|1p=229|Daniels|1999|2p=204}} Applewhite's body was found seated on the bed of the mansion's master bedroom.{{sfn|Jones|2007}} [[Medical examiner]]s determined that his fears of cancer had been unfounded, but that he suffered from [[coronary atherosclerosis]].{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=311}}

The deaths provoked a [[media circus]],{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=30}} and Applewhite's face was featured on the covers of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''Newsweek'' on April&amp;nbsp;7.{{sfn|McCutcheon|2003|pp=104–5}} His final message was widely broadcast; Hugh Urban of [[Ohio State University]] describes his appearance in the video as "wild-eyed [and] rather alarming".{{sfn|Urban|2000|p=275}}

==Analysis==
Although many popular commentators, including psychologist [[Margaret Singer]],{{sfn|Monmaney|1997}} speculate that Applewhite brainwashed his followers, many academics have rejected the "brainwashing" label as an oversimplification that does not express the nuances of the process by which the followers were influenced.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=241}} Lalich speculates that they were willing to follow Applewhite in suicide because they had become totally dependent upon him, and hence were poorly suited for life in his absence.{{sfn|Lalich, "Using the Bounded Choice Model"|2004|pp=237–9}} Davis attributes Applewhite's success in convincing his followers to commit suicide to two factors: he isolated them socially and cultivated an attitude of complete religious obedience in them.{{sfn|Davis|2000|p=242}} Applewhite's students had made a long-term commitment to him, and Balch and Taylor infer that this is why his interpretations of events appeared coherent to them.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=227}} Most of the dead had been members for about 20&amp;nbsp;years,{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=28}} although there were a few recent converts.{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=42}}

Lewis argues that Applewhite effectively controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=126}} Richard Hecht of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], echoes this sentiment, arguing that members of the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them.{{sfn|Monmaney|1997}} In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they saw it as a way to demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=181}}

Urban writes that Applewhite's life displays "the intense ambivalence and alienation shared by many individuals lost in late twentieth-century capitalist society".{{sfn|Urban|2000|p=270}} He notes that Applewhite's condemnations of contemporary culture bear similarities to those of [[Jean Baudrillard]] at times, particularly their shared nihilist views.{{sfn|Urban|2000|pp=291–2}} Urban posits that Applewhite found no way other than suicide to escape the society that surrounded him and states that death offered him a way to escape its "endless circle of seduction and consumption".{{sfn|Urban|2000|p=271}}

While covering the suicides, several media outlets focused on Applewhite's sexuality;{{sfn|Dahir|1997|pp=35–7}} the ''[[New York Post]]'' dubbed him "the Gay Guru".{{sfn|Lippert|1997|p=31}} Gay rights activist [[Troy Perry]] argued that Applewhite's repression, and society's rejection, of same-sex relationships ultimately led to his suicide. This idea has failed to gain support among academics.{{sfn|Dahir|1997|pp=35–7}} Zeller argues that Applewhite's sexuality was not the primary driving force behind his asceticism, which he believes resulted from a variety of factors, though he grants sexuality a role.{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=122}}

Lalich states that Applewhite fit "the traditional view of a charismatic leader",{{sfn|Lalich, ''Bounded Choice''|2004|p=43}} and [[Evan Thomas]] deems him a "master manipulator".{{sfn|Goerman|2011|p=58}} Lifton compares Applewhite to [[Shoko Asahara]], the founder of [[Aum Shinrikyo]], describing him as "equally controlling, his paranoia and megalomania gentler yet ever present".{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=306}} [[Christopher Partridge]] of [[Lancaster University]] states that Applewhite and Nettles were similar to [[John Reeve (religious leader)|John Reeve]] and [[Lodowicke Muggleton]], who founded [[Muggletonianism]], a millennialist movement in 17th century England.{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=50}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9425">{{for|a family name inherited from one's mother (and maternal grandmother, etc.)|Matriname}}
A '''matronymic''' is a [[personal name]] based on the [[given name]] of one's mother, grandmother, or any female ancestor. It is the female equivalent of a [[patronymic]]. Around the world, '''matronymic surnames''' are far less common than [[patronymic surname]]s. In some cultures in the past, matronymic last names were often given to children of unwed mothers. Or if a woman was especially well known or powerful, her descendants might adopt a matronym based on her name.

==Terminology in English==

The word ''matronymic'' is first attested in English in 1794 and originates in the [[Greek language|Greek]] μήτηρ ''mētēr'' "mother" (&lt;small&gt;[[Genitive case|GEN]]&lt;/small&gt; μητρός ''mētros'' whence the [[combining form]] μητρo- ''mētro''-),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|mh/thr|μήτηρ|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  ὄνυμα ''onyma'', a variant form of ὄνομα ''onoma'' "name",&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|o)/noma|ὄνομα|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the suffix [[wikt:-ικός|-ικός]] -''ikos'', which was originally used to form adjectives with the sense "pertaining to" (thus "pertaining to the mother's name"). The Greek word μητρωνυμικός ''mētrōnymikos''&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|mhtrwnumiko/s|μητρωνυμικός|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; was then borrowed into Latin in a partially Latinised form (Greek ''mētēr'', dialectally ''mātēr'', corresponds to Latin ''mater''),&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|mater|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ''matronomicus''. These words were a source for coining the English ''matronymic'' as the female counterpart to ''patronymic'' (first attested in English in 1612).&lt;ref&gt;"matronymic, n. and adj.". OED Online, 3rd edition. March 2018. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records an English noun ''patronym'' in [[free variation]] with the noun ''patronymic'', it does not, however, record a corresponding noun ''matronym''.

More rarely, English speakers use forms based wholly on Greek: the noun ''metronym'' (first attested in 1904); and the noun and adjective ''metronymic'' (first attested in 1868).&lt;ref&gt;"metronymic, n. and adj."; "metronym, n.". ''OED Online'', 3rd edn. March 2018. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These are, for example, the forms used in the 2016 ''The Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland'', ed. by Patrick Hanks, Richard Coates, Peter McClure (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==
===India===
The matrilineal communities in South and North-East India, like the [[Bunt (community)|Bunts]] and [[Khasi_people|Khasi]], have family names which are inherited from their mother. Matronymic names are common in Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/2594/12/12_chapter%203.pdf Mother's name becoming common in naming conventions in Kerala (page 201)], shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in; accessed May 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Daughters take the names of their mothers as the second part of their name.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

===Indonesia===
The [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] of [[Indonesia]] are the largest group of people who use this naming system. People of [[Enggano Island]] also use a matronymic system. They also have family name/surname (marga).

===Philippines===
[[Filipino name]]s legally have the [[maiden name]] of the child's mother as a [[middle name]] as opposed to Anglo-American use of secondary or tertiary given names. Filipino children born to [[unwed mother]]s, if not claimed by the father nor adopted by anyone else, automatically bear their mother's maiden name and sometimes middle name.

===Vietnam===
Some [[Vietnamese names]] also function this way, as less of a "tradition" than a style or trend, in which the mother's maiden name is the child's middle name.

==Europe==

===England===
Although many English matronyms were given to children of unwed mothers, it was not unusual for children of married women to also use a matronymic surname. For instance, it was traditional during the Middle Ages for [[posthumous birth|children whose fathers died before their births]] to use a matronym, and it was not unheard of for children to be given a matronym if the father's name was foreign, difficult to pronounce, or had an unfortunate meaning. A child of a strong-minded woman might also take a matronym, as might a child whose name would otherwise be confused with that of a cousin or neighbour. There are even instances where royal houses used matronymics to strengthen claims to the English throne  – for example, Princess Matilda's eldest son was known as [[Henry FitzEmpress]] (-[[fitz]] meaning "son of" from Latin ''filius''). Common English matronyms include Beaton, Custer, Tiffany, Parnell, Hilliard, Marriott, Ibbetson, Babbs, and Megson.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, William Dodgson. ''The Story of Surnames''. London, George Routledge &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1932. No ISBN.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
In the old Finnish system, women were standardly given matronyms, while men were given patronyms, for example, Ainontytär (female) or Pekanpoika (male). Since the 19th century the system of inherited family names has been used, however, and today nearly all Finns have inherited surnames.

===France===
Family names derived from matronyms are found in [[France]], especially in [[Normandy]]: Catherine, Marie, Jeanne, Adeline. In medieval Normandy ([[Duchy of Normandy]]), a matronym might be used when the mother was of greater prominence than the father or the basis for a claim of inheritance, such as in the cases of [[Henry II of England|Henry FitzEmpress]] and [[Robert FitzWimarc]].

===Iceland===
{{see|Icelandic name}}
Some [[Iceland]]ic people, like [[Heiðar Helguson]], have matronyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_life/?cat_id=16571&amp;ew_0_a_id=302030|title=In the Name of the Father|first=Iceland|last=Review|date=5 March 2008|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland and Wales===
Matronymics appear in medieval Celtic tales such as ''[[Cath Maige Tuired]]'' and the Fourth Branch of the [[Mabinogi]] (the children of [[Dôn]]).

===Netherlands===

Matronymics are accepted in the Netherlands but are generally written as given names on identity cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nvb/naam/eindigtop/zoon|title=NVB : voornaam eindigt op 'zoon'|first=Meertens|last=Instituut|website=www.meertens.knaw.nl|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
Family names derived from matronyms are also found in [[Romania]], especially in the region of [[Moldavia]]. Examples include: Aioanei, Ababei, Acatrinei, Ailincăi.

===Russia===
Family names derived from matronyms are also found in [[Russia]]. Examples include: Katin, Mashkov, Annushkin. [[Oleg Yaroslavich]], 12th century prince of Galich, was known as Oleg Nastasyich during his life to distinguish his claim from that of his half-brother Vladimir.

==Middle East==
===Arabic===
An example of an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] matronymic is the name of [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] in the Qur'an, ‘Īsá ibn Maryam, which means Jesus the son of Mary. The book ''Kitāb man nusiba ilá ummihi min al-shu‘arā’'' (The book of poets who are named with the lineage of their mothers) by the 9th-century author Muḥammad ibn Ḥabīb is a study of the matronymics of Arabic poets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/594132|publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 62, No. 3 (September 1942), pp. 156-71|title=Muḥammad Ibn Ḥabīb's "Matronymics of Poets"|last=Levi della Vida|first= Giorgio|pages=156–71|author2=Ḥabīb, MuḥAmmad Ibn|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=62|issue=3|year=1942|jstor=594132|last3=Habib|first3=Muhammad Ibn}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exist other examples of matronymics in historical Arabic.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atensubmissions.nexiliscom.com/6-2006LoP.shtml|title=Brickbat's - May 2006 LoP Page|first=Linda M.|last=Miku|website=atensubmissions.nexiliscom.com|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish===
Most characters in the [[Bible]] are referred to with a patronymic. However, [[Abishai (Bible)|Abishai]], [[Joab]], and [[Asahel]] – the sons of [[Zeruiah]], sister or stepsister of [[King David]] – are invariably referred to as "Sons of Zeruiah" and the name of their father remains unknown. Also the Biblical Judge [[Shamgar]] is referred to with the matronymic "Son of [[Anat]]".{{cn|date=May 2017}}

There are indications of a Jewish history of matronymic names. Specifically, in East European Jewish society, there appeared various matronymic family names such as [[Rivlin]] (from [[Rivka]]/[[Rebecca]]), [[Sorkin]] (from [[Sarah]]), [[Zeitlin]] (from Zeitl), [[Rochlin]] (from [[Rachel]]), [[Feiglin]] (from [[Feige]]), and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/474406|publisher=JSTOR: The Biblical World, Vol. 36, No. 6 (Dec., 1910 ), pp. 407-14|title=Traces of the Matronymic Family in the Hebrew Social Organization|last=Cross|first= Earle Bennett|pages=407–14|journal=The Biblical World|volume=36|issue=6|year=1910|jstor=3141456}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain Jewish prayers and blessings, matronyms are used, e.g., "Joseph ''ben'' (son of) Miriam".{{cn|date=May 2017}}

After working as a fashion model during her teenage years, she first gained notice for her role as [[Allison MacKenzie]] in the television [[soap opera]] ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'' and gained further recognition for her subsequent short-lived marriage to [[Frank Sinatra]], whom she married at age 22. An early film role, as Rosemary in [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), saw her nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress]].

Farrow's first leading film role was in ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), which was a critical and commercial success at the time and continues to be widely regarded as a classic of the horror genre. Her performance garnered numerous awards, including the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress]], and established her as a leading actress. Film critic and author Stephen Farber described her performance as having an "electrifying impact... one of the rare instances of actor and character achieving a miraculous, almost mythical match". Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] called the film "brilliant", and noted, "A great deal of the credit for this achievement must go to Mia Farrow, as Rosemary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19680729/REVIEWS/807290301/1023|author=Ebert, Roger|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=July 29, 1968|title=Rosemary's Baby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''Rosemary's Baby'', Farrow was to be cast as Mattie in ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' and was keen on the role. However, prior to filming she made ''[[Secret Ceremony]]'' in England with [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Robert Mitchum]]. While filming, Mitchum told her about ''True Grit'' director [[Henry Hathaway]] having a reputation for being rude to actresses. Farrow asked producer [[Hal Wallis]] to replace Hathaway. Wallis refused; Farrow then quit the role, which was then given to [[Kim Darby]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Ronald L. (2003), ''Duke: The Life and Image of John Wayne'', University of Oklahoma Press, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Secret Ceremony'' divided critics, but has gone on to develop a devoted following. Farrow's other late 1960s films include ''John and Mary'', opposite [[Dustin Hoffman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Happy ending for Mia |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19691211&amp;id=u8hUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=z5ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6494,2092771&amp;hl=sv |newspaper=The Age |publisher=Google News Archive |date=December 11, 1969 |accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She appeared in director [[Robert Altman]]'s cult classic ''[[A Wedding]]'' (1978). In 1977, she played the title role in ''[[The Haunting of Julia]]''. Farrow appeared in several made-for-television films in the 1970s, most notably portraying the title role in a musical version of ''[[Peter Pan]]'' (1976).

In the 1980s and early 1990s, Farrow's relationship with director [[Woody Allen]] resulted in numerous film collaborations. She appeared in nearly all of Allen's films during this period, including leading roles in ''[[Zelig]]'', ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]'', ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]'', ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', ''[[Radio Days]]'' and ''[[Alice (1990 film)|Alice]]'' (1990). Farrow played Alura, mother of Kara ([[Helen Slater]]), in ''[[Supergirl (1984 film)|Supergirl]]'' (1984) and voiced the title role in the animated film ''[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]'' (1982). She narrated several of the animated ''[[Stories to Remember]]''. Allen said that the way she played her character in ''Broadway Danny Rose'' was a "very, very brave thing for her to do," as she had to play her role without ever using her eyes.{{sfn|Allen|1993|p=147}}

Citing the need to devote herself to raising her young children, Farrow worked less frequently during the 1990s. Nonetheless, she appeared in leading roles in several films, including the Irish film ''[[Widows' Peak]]'' (1994), ''[[Miami Rhapsody]]'' (1995) and ''[[Reckless (1995 film)|Reckless]]'' (also 1995). She appeared in several independent features and made-for-television films throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s and wrote an autobiography, ''What Falls Away'', in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/02/23/reviews/970223.23harrist.html| title=Intimate Strangers|author=Harrison, Kathryn|publisher=Books, ''The New York Times''|date=February 23, 1997|accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrow appeared as Mrs. Baylock, the [[Satanism|Satanic]] nanny, in the remake of ''[[The Omen (2006 film)|The Omen]]'' (2006).

====Sexual abuse allegations against Allen====
{{main|Woody Allen sexual assault allegation}}
Farrow said that on August 4, 1992, Dylan Farrow, then aged seven, told Farrow that she had been sexually abused by Allen in their Connecticut home earlier that day. Farrow reported this to their pediatrician, who reported the allegations to authorities. Allen was informed of the accusations on August 6. A week later, on August 13, Allen sued for full custody of his biological son, Satchel, and two of Farrow's adopted children, Dylan and Moses, with whom Allen had assumed a parental role.&lt;ref name="slate-deeper"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winter|first1=Jessica|title=Woody Allen and Dylan Farrow: Just the Facts|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/culturebox/2014/02/woody_allen_and_dylan_farrow_digging_deeper_into_misleading_coverage.html|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229124214/http://www.slate.com/articles/life/culturebox/2014/02/woody_allen_and_dylan_farrow_digging_deeper_into_misleading_coverage.html|archive-date=December 29, 2014|date=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Custody"&gt;{{cite news|title=Allen Loses to Farrow in Bitter Custody Battle|author=Marks, Peter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/02/23/reviews/farrow-verdict.html|work=The New York Times|date=June 8, 1993|accessdate= November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1993, the lead doctor of Yale–New Haven Hospital Child Sexual Abuse Clinic's investigation into the allegations, Dr. John Leventhal, gave sworn testimony via a deposition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Orth|first1=Maureen|title=10 Undeniable Facts About the Woody Allen Sexual-Abuse Allegation|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2014/02/woody-allen-sex-abuse-10-facts|accessdate=February 9, 2015|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|date=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that, in his opinion, Dylan "either invented the story under the stress of living in a volatile and unhealthy home or that it was planted in her mind by her mother" because of the "inconsistent" presentation of the story by Dylan.&lt;ref&gt;Perez-Pena R. (May 4, 1993). [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html "Doctor Cites Inconsistencies In Dylan Farrow's Statement"], ''The New York Times''; accessed October 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The doctor did not meet with Dylan before giving his testimony, and instead delivered his findings based on interviews conducted by others.&lt;ref name="slate-deeper" /&gt;

The team's findings were criticized by the presiding judge, and later by other experts in the field, who found their behavior unusual for making conclusive statements about innocence and guilt, instead of reporting on behavior, for refusing to testify in court when asked, and for destroying all their notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | first=Andy| last=Thibault| url = http://www.andythibault.com/columns/CT%20Magazine%20-%20Apr%2097.htm | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120719083243/http://www.andythibault.com/columns/CT%20Magazine%20-%20Apr%2097.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-07-19 | title = Woody, Mia and Frank Maco | publisher = Connecticut Magazine | date = April 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Wilk stated that the investigating team's behavior had "resulted in a report which was sanitized and, therefore, less credible" and that its recommendations and statements had "exceed[ed] its mandate". He concluded, "I am less certain, however, than is the Yale-New Haven team, that the evidence proves conclusively that there was no sexual abuse."&lt;ref name="Custody"/&gt;

In his final decision, in June 1993, Justice Wilk stated that he found "no credible evidence to support Mr. Allen's contention that Ms. Farrow coached Dylan or that Ms. Farrow acted upon a desire for revenge against him for seducing Soon-Yi. Mr. Allen's resort to the stereotypical 'woman scorned' defense is an injudicious attempt to divert attention from his failure to act as a responsible parent and adult."&lt;ref name="slate-deeper" /&gt; He rejected Allen's bid for full custody and denied him visitation rights with Dylan, stating that even though the full truth of the allegations may never be known, "the credible testimony of Ms. Farrow, Dr. Coates, Dr. Leventhal and Mr. Allen does, however, prove that Mr. Allen's behavior toward Dylan was grossly inappropriate and that measures must be taken to protect her".&lt;ref name="Custody"/&gt;

In September 1993, the state's attorney, Frank Maco, announced he would not pursue Allen in court for the molestation allegations, despite having "probable cause", citing his and Farrow's desire not to traumatize Dylan further.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | first= Melinda| last= Henneberger| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/25/nyregion/connecticut-prosecutor-won-t-file-charges-against-woody-allen.html | title = Connecticut Prosecutor Won't File Charges Against Woody Allen | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = September 25, 1993| accessdate = January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Dylan Farrow publicly renewed her claims of sexual abuse against Allen, in an open letter published by [[Nicholas Kristof]], a friend of Farrow, in his ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' blog.&lt;ref name="Open Letter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1&amp;|title=An Open Letter From Dylan Farrow|work=The New York Times|series="On the Ground" (Nicholas Kristof blog)|date=February 1, 2014|accessdate=February 3, 2014|author=Farrow, Dylan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/02/dylan-farrow-woody-allen-abuse-allegations|title=Dylan Farrow, adopted daughter of Woody Allen, alleges he abused her|date=February 2, 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Catherine Shard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-26005565|title=Woody Allen accused of sex abuse by adopted daughter|date=February 2, 2014|work=[[BBC]]|archive-url=http://archive.is/y8dPh|archive-date=February 2, 2014|publisher=British Broadcasting Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen repeated his denial of the allegations.&lt;ref name="Allen reply to Dylan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/allen-rejects-39-untrue-disgraceful-39-sex-abuse-232731191.html#75X0c2d|title=Woody Allen rejects 'untrue and disgraceful' sex abuse claims|publisher=AFP|date=February 3, 2014|accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen-SundayReview2014"&gt;{{cite news|first=Woody|last=Allen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/woody-allen-speaks-out.html|title=Woody Allen Speaks Out|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 7, 2014|accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mickey Green''' (born 1942 in [[Holloway, London]])&lt;ref&gt;https://www.standard.co.uk/news/pimpernel-who-chose-drugs-trade-6305077.html&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[English people|English]] [[gangster]] and [[drug lord]] who has also held [[Ireland|Irish]] nationality. A convicted armed robber he has allegedly been one of Britain's leading drug dealers for many years and is said to be worth at least £75 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/magazine/3715205.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

The gangster's surname is often spelt in newspapers as 'Greene'&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/old-style-villain-is-revealed-as-uks-most-wanted-man-1106880.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

Green was the leader of the "Wembley Mob" which specialized in armed robbery in the 1970s. For a number of years he has been wanted by police in several countries around the world for suspected drug smuggling. Gangland sources have described him as a main suspect in the murders of London criminal figures [[Gilbert Wynter]] and [[Solly Nahome]]. His ability to evade arrest has led to him being nicknamed the pimpernel. He is said to have first become involved with drugs during the early 1980s shortly after his release from prison, for armed robbery. He has been suspected of having a number of detectives on his payroll and of being an associate of the [[Clerkenwell crime syndicate|Adams Brothers]]. 

Although owning pubs and other property in [[Wembley]], [[West Hampstead]], [[Dublin]] and [[Marbella]], he has been evading authorities for more than twenty years operating in countries including [[Morocco]], [[France]] and the [[United States]] where he cooperated with organized crime figures running cocaine in from Colombia until his arrest by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] while residing in a [[Beverly Hills]] mansion formerly owned by musician [[Rod Stewart]]. He was later released without facing a trial.

In 1998, following the arrest of British drug trafficker [[Michael Michael]] during [[Operation Draft]], Green was one of sixty others implicated in a £150 million cocaine trafficking ring [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-811197-details/Britain's+biggest+supergrass/article.do] and would later be arrested by police at the Ritz hotel in [[Barcelona, Spain]]. Although held in custody for several months, he was again released and returned to his villa on the southern coast of Spain. As of 2002, he was wanted by authorities in Ireland as they suspected he tampered with a jury at a prior inquest and his assets in the Republic of Ireland were seized by the Irish [[Criminal Assets Bureau]]. As of November, 2007 he is understood to be living in and around the [[Marbella]] area.

'''Mohammed Jaber Al-Ansari''', is a prominent [[Bahrain]]i [[philosopher]] and political thinker, and an influential proponent of [[rational thinking]] in the 20th-century [[Arab World]]. He played a pivotal role in establishing the previously peripheral [[Persian Gulf]] region as an integral contributor to modern Arabic thought, on equal footing with other parts of the Arab World. His early work as a [[literary historian]], and critic, instigated wide literary activity in his native Bahrain and in its surrounding Persian Gulf region. Al-Ansari was one of the early Arab intellectuals to delve into studying the [[East Asia]]n experiences and draw comparisons with the Arab World.

== Life and work ==
Al-Ansari was born in [[Bahrain]] in 1939 (then a [[British protectorate]]). Al-Ansari's first philosophical interests were shaped during the [[Nasser]]ite 1950s, when the Arab World was in the midst of its struggle against [[colonialism]] and the fight for the creation of [[Pan-Arab Unity]]. Al-Ansari started to publish soon after he obtained his BA from the [[American University in Beirut]] in 1962. His early work covered historical and contemporary literary work in his native Bahrain and its neighboring countries. Compiled in one volume titled "Glimpses at the Gulf" (لمحات من الخليج), the volume sheds light on previously little known authors in this region because of its distance from the centers of Arab literary activity (essentially [[Cairo]] and [[Beirut]] were most Arabic publication originated.)   

In 1969, Al-Ansari co-founded Bahrain's Literary Association (أسرة الأدباء والكتاب) and became its first President. In the same year, he was appointed to the [[State Council of Bahrain|State Council]] (Bahrain's first national cabinet) which oversaw the country’s transition to independence from [[Great Britain]]. In 1971, Al-Ansari gave up his cabinet position to pursue his intellectual and academic career. 
 
Al-Ansari received his Ph.D. in 1979. His [[dissertation]] which was published later in a volume titled Arabic Though and the Struggle of Opposites formed the base for his first intellectual project. The volume reveals Al-Ansari’s strategy of thinking and brings to light the main philosophical themes that he resonated in his later work. 

In the following year, he published his major work, ''Transformation of Thought and Politics in the Arab East 1930-1970'' (تحولات الفكر والسياسة في المشرق العربي 1930-1970), which won him the [[Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science]] Award. This significant work had a profound impact on the re-orientation of the Twentieth Century Persian Gulf from a mere receiver of Arab intellectual products into a competent contributor to the philosophical, cultural and political discourse in the wider Arab World.

Al-Ansari moved to Paris in 1981, where he participated in the creation of [[L'Institut du Monde Arabe]] (The Arab World Institute).  In 1983, Al-Ansari moved back to his Bahrain to become of one of the founders of the [[Arabian Gulf University]] where he became the Dean of the Higher Education Faculty until 2005. 

In 1984, His Majesty the [[King of Bahrain]] (then the Crown Prince) retained Al-Ansari as his Cultural and Scientific Advisor, a position Al-Ansari still holds today.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.bna.bh/?ID=53670&lt;/ref&gt;  

Al-Ansari resides in Bahrain with his wife Aysha. He has three daughters and nine grand children. He is currently Professor of Islamic Civilization and Modern Thought at the Arabian Gulf University.

== Principal contributions ==

Professor Al-Ansari work encompasses two parallel intellectual projects: 

# Studying the Arab society's intellectual superstructure (criticism of Thought):  demonstrated in three books. The first one was his Ph.D. dissertation Arabic Though and the Struggle of Opposites and two complementary volumes Diagnosis of the In-decision Syndrome in Arab Life and Querying Defeat.
# Studying Arab society's intellectual infrastructure (criticism of Arab political conduct/reality):  this project consisted of three volumes:  The Political Composition of Arabs, and The Arab Political Quandary and The Arabs and Politics: Where is the Fault?

In his criticism of Arabic Thought, Al-Ansari promotes an indigenous [[methodology]] to interpret and understand the internal mechanisms adopted by Arab intellectuals in their diagnoses of the issues facing Arab societies throughout history. Al-Ansari coined the term ‘Arabic Syncretism’ to portray Arab intellectuals’ endeavors to reconcile the dialectical relationships formed between [[philosophy]] and [[religion]], [[faith]] and [[reason]], East and West etc.  He concludes by exposing the inherent instability of this [[Syncretism]] because of its tendency to ferment a culture of deferment and ‘in-decision’. Throughout his work on this project, Al-Ansari uncovers the inability of Arabic Syncretism to sustain itself in the face of crises. This is further demonstrated through in-depth case studies of the rise and fall of the [[Nasserite]] ([[Egypt]]) and [[Ba'ath]] ([[Levant]]) experiments in twentieth century [[Arab Mashreq]]. 

Al-Ansari's study of the Arab's political reality aims to rise above the rhetorical and ideological clutter prevalent in the Arab World to establish a rational sociological approach to understanding [[Arab politics]]. In his rational style, Al-Ansari traces the socio-political history of the Arabs and dissects the compositions and dynamics of the various phases in this history. Al-Ansari, asserts that the Arabs’ political [[:wikt:quandary|quandary]] is a major impediment to their overall progress in the modern World as it was in their past. In Al-Ansari’s view, the Arab peoples despite their long and rich history never had the opportunity to develop a stable, institutionalized State. One reason for this is the constant influence of nomadic (as opposed to the settled) elements of the [[Arab society]], the constant movement of the center of power and the failure to dismantle no-state loyalties (e.g. tribal loyalties) on the continuity of a stable and civil structure of the state. The direct impact of this is the absence of indigenous Arabic political traditions which in turn have an indirect impact on the possibilities for a natural progression to [[Democracy|democratic rule]].

===Pace Environmental Litigation Clinic===
In 1987, Kennedy founded the Environmental Litigation Clinic at Pace University School of Law, where he served for three decades as the clinic's supervising attorney and co-director, and as Clinical Professor of Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.pace.edu/pace-environmental-litigation-clinic|title=Pace Environmental Litigation Clinic - Pace Law School|author=|date=|website=www.law.pace.edu|accessdate=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy obtained a special order from the New York State Court of Appeals that permitted his 10 clinic students–second- and third-year law students–to practice law and to try cases against Hudson River polluters in state and federal court, under the supervision of Kennedy and his co-director, Professor Karl Coplan. The clinic's full-time clients are Riverkeeper and Long Island Soundkeeper.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F., Solow, Steven P. (1993). "Environmental Litigation as Clinical Education: A Case Study". University of Oregon Journal of Environmental Law and Litigation Volume 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waterkeepers Alliance===
In June 1999, as Riverkeeper's success on the Hudson began inspiring the creation of Waterkeepers across North America, Kennedy and a few dozen Riverkeepers gathered in Southampton, Long Island to found the Waterkeeper Alliance, which now serves as the umbrella group for the 320 licensed Waterkeeper programs located in 38 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Waterkeeper Alliance. "Local Waterkeepers". Waterkeeper.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  As President of the Alliance, Kennedy oversees its legal, membership, policy and fundraising programs. The Alliance states that it is dedicated to promoting "swimmable, fishable, drinkable waterways, worldwide,"&lt;ref&gt;"Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Honored at Water's Edge Gala". (2014). Stroudcenter.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  and also serves as a clearinghouse, approving new Keeper programs and licensing use of the trademarked "Waterkeeper," "Riverkeeper," "Soundkeeper," "Lakekeeper," "Baykeeper," "Bayoukeeper," "Canalkeeper," "Coastkeeper," etc. names.&lt;ref&gt;Wilke, Chris (March 19, 2012) "The Clean Water Act – A Story of Activism and Change". Read the Dirt.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy and his environmental work have been the focus of several films including ''The Hudson Riverkeepers(1998)''&lt;ref&gt;"The Hudson Riverkeepers (1998)".

IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York City Watershed Agreement===
Beginning in 1991, Kennedy represented environmentalists and New York City watershed consumers in a series of lawsuits against New York City, New York State, and upstate watershed polluters. Kennedy authored a series of articles and reports&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, David K. and Kennedy, Jr., Robert F. (September 1991). The Legend of City Water: Recommendations For Rescuing the New York City Water Supply. The Hudson Riverkeeper Fund.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F. (August 22, 1989). "New York City's Water: Down the Drain". The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F. (February 7, 1992). "Drinking From Sewers". The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/about/cpc/990237.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; alleging that New York State was abdicating its responsibility to protect the water repository and supply. In 1996, he helped orchestrate the $1.2 billion New York City Watershed Agreement, which [[New York Magazine]] recognized in its cover story, "The Kennedy Who Matters."&lt;ref&gt;Wechsler, Pat (Nov 27, 1995). "The Kennedy Who Matters". New York Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;  This agreement, which Kennedy negotiated on behalf of environmentalists and New York City watershed consumers, is regarded as an international model in stakeholder consensus negotiations and sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Schneeweiss, Jonathan (1997).

===Kennedy &amp; Kevin Madonna===
In 2000, Kennedy and environmental lawyer Kevin Madonna founded the environmental law firm, Kennedy &amp; Madonna, LLP, to represent private [[plaintiffs]] against polluters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kennedy-madonna-1zcf.squarespace.com/team/|title=Team|author=|date=|website=Kennedy &amp; Madonna, LLP|accessdate=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The firm litigates environmental contamination cases on behalf of individuals, non-profit organizations, school districts, public water suppliers, Indian tribes, municipalities and states. In 2001, Kennedy &amp; Madonna organized a team of prestigious plaintiff law firms to challenge pollution from industrial pork and poultry production.&lt;ref&gt;"Farmers Worried by Suits Targeting Hog Producers". January 7, 2001. Des Moines Register. P.9.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, the firm was part of a legal team that secured a $70 million settlement for property owners in Pensacola, Florida whose properties were contaminated by chemicals from an adjacent [[Superfund]] site.&lt;ref&gt;"ConocoPhillips agrees to $70M settlement for former Fla. facility". April 7, 2004 EENews.net.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy &amp; Madonna is profiled in the HBO documentary Mann v. Ford&lt;ref&gt;"Mann V. Ford (2010). IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt;  that chronicles four years of litigation brought by the firm on behalf of the [[Ramapough Mountain Indians|Ramapough Mountain Indian Tribe]] against the [[Ford Motor Company]] over the dumping of toxic waste on tribal lands in northern New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/mann-v-ford/synopsis.html|title=Mann v. Ford: Synopsis|author=|date=|website=HBO|accessdate=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to a monetary settlement for the tribe, the lawsuit contributed to the community's land being re-listed on the federal Superfund list, the first time in the nation's history that a de-listed site was re-listed.&lt;ref&gt;Strunsky, Steve (October 14, 2006). "Superfund Site Is Relisted, and Inquiry Begins". New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007 Kennedy was one of three finalists nominated as "Trial Lawyer of the Year" by Public Justice for his role in the $396 million jury verdict against [[DuPont]] for contamination from its [[Spelter]], West Virginia zinc plant.&lt;ref&gt;"DuPont Fined $196.2M In Class-Action Suit". October 19, 2007. CBSNews.com.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, the firm was part of the trial team that secured a $670 million settlement on behalf of over 3,000 residents from Ohio and West Virginia whose drinking water was contaminated with the toxic chemical, C8, which was released into the environment by [[DuPont]] in [[Parkersburg]], West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Rinehart, Earl (February 13, 2017). "DuPont to pay $670 million to settle C8 lawsuits". The Columbus Dispatch.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Kennedy became counsel to the Morgan &amp; Morgan PA|Morgan &amp; Morgan P.A. law firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forthepeople.com/attorneys/robert-f-kennedy-jr/ | title=Attorney Robert F. Kennedy, Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The partnership arose from the two firms' successful collaboration on the case against SoCalGas Company following the [[Aliso Canyon gas leak]] in California.&lt;ref&gt;Cruz, Nancy (February 18, 2016) "Porter Ranch Gas Leak With Attorney Robert F. Kennedy". KTLA5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, Kennedy and his partners sued Monsanto in federal court in San Francisco, on behalf of plaintiffs seeking to recover damages for [[non-Hodgkins lymphoma]], that, the plaintiffs allege, were a result of exposure to Monsanto's [[glyphosate]]-based herbicide, Roundup. Kennedy and his team also filed a class action lawsuit against [[Monsanto]] for failing to warn consumers about the dangers allegedly posed by exposure to Roundup.&lt;ref&gt;Stecker, Tiffany (June 29, 2017). "Monsanto's Foes Are Branching Out". Environment, Health &amp; Safety.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, Kennedy and his partners filed a class-action lawsuit against [[Columbia Gas of Massachusetts]] alleging negligence following [[Merrimack Valley gas explosions|gas explosions]] in three towns north of Boston. Of Columbia Gas, Kennedy said “as they build new miles of pipe, the same company is ignoring its existing infrastructure, which we now know is eroding and is dilapidated.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://gazette.com/mass-families-file-class-action-days-after-gas-explosions/article_f1b671b8-bc7c-11e8-ae39-4787469086e9.html | title=Mass.

===Cleantech and renewable energy infrastructure entrepreneurship===

In 1998, Kennedy, Chris Bartle and John Hoving created a bottled-water company, Keeper Springs, which donated all of its profits to Waterkeeper Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Winters Lauro, Patricia (June 3, 1999). "Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is pushing supermarkets to sell a new brand of bottled water, with a twist". The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, Kennedy and his partner sold the brand to [[Nestlé]] in exchange for a donation to local Waterkeepers.&lt;ref&gt;"Nestle Waters Announces Partnership with Waterkeeper Alliance". May 22, 2014. Nestle Waters.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy served as a Venture Partner and Senior Advisor at [[VantagePoint Capital Partners]], one of the world's largest cleantech [[venture capital]] firms.  Among other activities, VantagePoint was the original and largest pre-[[IPO]] institutional investor in [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]]. VantagePoint also backed BrightSource Energy and Solazyme, amongst others. Kennedy serves as a board member and counselor to several of Vantage Point's portfolio companies in the water and energy space, including Ostara, a Vancouver-based company that markets the technology to remove phosphorus and other excessive nutrients from wastewater, transforming otherwise pollution directly into high grade fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;Wesoff, Eric (May 31, 2012) "Ostara Nutrient Recovery Wins $14.5M From VantagePoint et al.".

===Minority and poor communities===
In his first case as an environmental attorney, Kennedy represented the NAACP in a lawsuit against a proposal to build a garbage transfer station in a minority neighborhood in Ossining, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin, Tessa (April 7, 1991) "Expanded Recycling Site Upsets an Ossining Neighborhood". The New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/07/nyregion/expanded-recycling-site-upsets-an-ossining-neighborhood.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, he successfully sued Westchester County, New York, to reopen the Croton Point park, which was heavily used primarily by poor and minority communities from [[the Bronx]].&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Susan (July 2, 1990).

===International and indigenous rights===
Beginning in 1985, Kennedy helped develop NRDC's international program for environmental, energy, and human rights. He worked on environmental issues across the Americas, and traveled regularly to Canada and Latin American to assist Indigenous tribes to protect their traditional homelands and to oppose large-scale energy and extractive projects in remote wilderness areas.&lt;ref&gt;Brancaccio, David (January 21, 2005). "Science and Health: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.". PBS NOW. http://www.pbs.org/now/science/kennedy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Kennedy assisted the [[Pehuenche]] Indians in Chile in a partially successful campaign to stop the construction of a series of dams on Chile's iconic [[Biobío River]]. That campaign derailed all but one of the proposed dams.&lt;ref&gt;Bowermaster, Jon.  (November 1992). "Last Run Down the Bio Bio". Town and Country Travel. http://www.earthriver.com/library/conservation/11-conservation/town-and-country&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1992, he assisted the [[Cree]] Indians of northern Quebec in their campaign against [[Hydro-Québec]] to halt construction of some 600 proposed dams on eleven rivers in [[James Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Mark (April 20, 1994). "Cree Chief Wins Environmental Prize For Anti-Dam Effort". The Christian Science Monitor. https://www.csmonitor.com/1994/0420/20042.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Kennedy and NRDC, working with the indigenous rights organization [[Cultural Survival]], clashed with other American environmental groups in a dispute about the rights of Indians to govern their own lands in the [[Oriente (Ecuador)|Oriente]] region of Ecuador.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Kane, Joe (September 27, 1993). "With Spears from All Sides".

Between 1996 and 2000, Kennedy and NRDC helped Mexican commercial fishermen to halt [[Mitsubishi]]'s proposal to build a salt facility in the [[Laguna San Ignacio]], a gray whale breeding, calving and nursery area in Baja, Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Matt (November 28th, 2001). "The Unlikely Environmentalists".

===Military and Vieques===
Kennedy has been a critic of environmental damage by the US military.&lt;ref&gt;Zukowski, Dan (June 22, 2017). "'An Act of War': RFK Jr. Puts U.S. Military and CAFOs on Blast for Trashing America's Waterways".

In an October 2001 ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'' article titled "Why Are We In Vieques?" Kennedy described how he sued the United States Navy on behalf of fishermen and residents of the Island of [[Vieques]], an island off Puerto Rico, to stop weapons testing, bombing, and the continuation of other military exercises on the Island. Kennedy argued that those activities were unnecessary for military preparedness, and that the Navy had illegally destroyed several endangered species, polluted the Island's waters, injured the health of Island residents and damaged the Island's economy.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F. (October, 2001). "Why Are We In Vieques?". Outside https://www.outsideonline.com/1819831/why-are-we-vieques&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested for trespassing at [[Camp Garcia Vieques]], the [[United States Navy]] training facility, where he and others were protesting the use of a section of the island for training. Kennedy served 30 days in a maximum security prison in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhouse, Steven (July 16, 2001). "He's in Charge, in Demand, in Prison". The New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/16/nyregion/he-s-in-charge-in-demand-and-in-prison.html&lt;/ref&gt; The trespassing incident forced the suspension of [[live-fire exercise]]s for almost three hours.&lt;ref&gt;"US Navy resumes Vieques war games". August 2, 2001. BBC News http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1470871.stm&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuits and protests by Kennedy, and hundreds of Puerto Ricans who were also imprisoned, eventually forced the termination of naval bombing in Vieques announced by president George Bush in 2001, and enacted in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez, Raymond (June 15, 2001).

In a 2003 article for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Kennedy wrote, "The federal government is America's biggest polluter and the Department of Defense is the government's worst offender. According to the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], unexploded ordnance waste can be found on 16,000 military ranges across the U.S. and more than half may contain biological or chemical weapons. In total, the Pentagon is responsible for more than 21,000 potentially contaminated sites and, according to the EPA, the military may have poisoned as much as 40 million acres, a little larger than Florida."&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F., (May 16, 2003).

===Factory farms===
For almost twenty years, Kennedy and his Waterkeepers waged a legal and public relations battle against pollution by factory farms.&lt;ref&gt;Waterkeeper Alliance (April 11, 2017). "Court Orders EPA to Close Loophole, Factory Farms Required to Report Toxic Pollution". Ecowatch.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s, he rallied opposition to factory farms among small independent farmers, convened a series of "National Summits" on factory meat products, and conducted press conference whistle stop tours across North Carolina, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Ohio and in Washington DC.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn Niman, Nicolette (February 17, 2009). Righteous Porkchop: Finding a Life and Good Food beyond Factory Farms. Published by William Morrow. p.336 {{ISBN|0061466492}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Beginning in 2000, Kennedy sued factory farms in North Carolina, Oklahoma, Maryland, and Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Nicolette G., et al., Waterkeeper Alliance (November 21, 2000) Notice of Intent to Sue for Violations of the Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery act, and Clean Air act; Letter to Samuel Hill et al., Brown's of Carolina, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote numerous articles on the subject, arguing that factory farms produce lower quality, less healthy food, and are harmful to independent family farmers by poisoning their air and water, reducing their property values, and using extensive state and federal subsidies to impose unfair competition against smaller farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F. (April 26, 1999). "I Don't Like Green Eggs and Ham!". Newsweek.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F. and Schaeffer, Eric (September 20, 2003). "An Ill Wind from Factory Farms".

In 1995, Premier [[Ralph Klein]] of Alberta declared Kennedy persona non grata in the province due to Kennedy's activism against Alberta's large-scale hog production facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Shelagh, host, and Carty, Bob, reporter (Feb 12, 2001). "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. warns Canada about Pollution from Pork Industry".

===Oil, gas, and pipelines===
Kennedy has been an advocate for a global transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;Ruf, Cory (May 25, 2013). "Robert Kennedy Jr. on his crusade for a 'green' economy". CBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Overheard with Evan Smith. (May 5, 2011). "Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. – Fossil Fuels". PBS.org&lt;/ref&gt;  He has been particularly critical of the oil industry. He began his career at Riverkeeper during the time that the organization discovered that Exxon was using its oil tankers in order to steal fresh water from the Hudson River for use in its Aruba refinery and to sell to Caribbean Islands. Riverkeeper won a $2 million settlement against Exxon and lobbied successfully for a state law outlawing the practice.&lt;ref&gt;AP (April 26, 1984). "Exxon is Sued by New York over Use of Hudson Water". The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his first environmental cases, Kennedy filed a lawsuit against [[Mobil Oil]] for polluting the Hudson.&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, John; Kennedy Jr., Robert F. (1997).

Kennedy helped lead the battle against fracking in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;AP (March 02, 2013). "New York fracking held as Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. talk health, AP sources say". Syracuse.com.&lt;/ref&gt;  He had been an early supporter of natural gas as viable bridge fuel to renewables, and a cleaner alternative to coal.&lt;ref&gt;Isensee, Laura (October 28, 2009). "Robert Kennedy Jr: solar and natural gas belong together". Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he said he turned against this controversial extraction method after investigating its cost to public health; climate and road infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Cusick (October 3, 2013). "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. calls natural gas a 'catastrophe'". StateImpact Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt;  As a member of Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]]'s fracking commission, Kennedy helped engineer the Governor's 2013 ban on fracking in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;AP (March 02, 2013).

"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Visits Standing Rock on #NoDAPL Day of Action". Indian Country Today.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy claims that the only reason the oil industry is able to remain competitive against renewables and electric cars is through massive direct and indirect subsidies and political interventions on behalf of the oil industry. In a June 2017 interview on EnviroNews, Kennedy said about the oil industry, "That's what their strategy is: build as many miles of pipeline as possible. And what the industry is trying to do is to increase that level of infrastructure investment so our country won't be able to walk away from it.&lt;ref&gt;Zukowski, Dan (June 26, 2017). "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Talks Tesla, Electric Big Rigs and the Impending Death of Fossil Fuels". EnivroNews.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy has promoted replacing coal energy with renewable energy, which, he argues, would thereby reduce costs and greenhouse gases while improving air and water quality, the health of the citizens, and the number and quality of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Staff writer (2015). "At Pennsylvania Coal Mine, Feds Come to Rescue after State Fails". Waterkeeper Magazine Vol. 11. Issue 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2011, film producer Bill Haney televised his award-winning film, [[The Last Mountain]], co-written by Haney and Peter Rhodes, depicting Kennedy's fight to stop [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] mountain top removal mining.&lt;ref&gt;The Last Mountain (2011) IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear power===
Kennedy has been an opponent of conventional nuclear power, arguing that it is unsafe and not economically competitive.&lt;ref&gt;Zukowski, Dan (June 23, 2017). "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: 'I love James Hansen, but he is wrong on [the nuclear power issue]'". EniroNews.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Jon (June 22, 2011). "Interview: Robert F.

His thirty-year battle to close [[Indian Point Energy Center|Indian Point]] nuclear power plant in New York ended in victory in January 2017, when Kennedy signed onto an agreement with New York State Governor, Andrew Cuomo, and [[Entergy]], the plant's operator, to close the plant by 2021.&lt;ref&gt;Admin (April 4, 2017).

(TV movie 2004). IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydro===
Kennedy has been an outspoken opponent of dams, particularly of dam projects that affect indigenous communities.

In 1991, Kennedy helped lead a campaign to block Hydro-Quebec from building the James Bay Hydro-project, a massive dam project in northern Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Truehart, Charles (April 7, 1994). "Quebec Power Company Finds Its High-Voltage Plans Short-Circuited". Washington Post.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was credited with mobilizing US political leaders and persuading New England lawmakers and New York officials, including New York Governor Mario Cuomo, to walk away from New York's multibillion-dollar contract with Hydro-Quebec. These actions helped to kill the project.&lt;ref&gt;Cardinale, Anthony and Vogel, Michael et al. (October 5, 1991). "Massive Quebec Power Project Reshapes Earth, Stirs Ecology Fears".

His campaigns helped block dams on Chile's Bio Bio&lt;ref&gt;Bowermaster, Jon (November 1992). "Last Run Down the Bio Bio". Town and Country.&lt;/ref&gt;  and Futaleufu rivers in 1990 and 2016 respectively. In 2003, he mounted an ultimately unsuccessful battle against the building of a dam on the [[Macal River]] in Belize. Kennedy termed the [[Chalillo Dam]] "a boondoggle," and brought a high-profile legal challenge against a Canadian power company, [[Fortis Inc.]], the monopoly owner of Belize's electric utility.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;Guynup, Sharon (June 7, 2002).

In 2004, Kennedy met with Provincial officials and brought foreign media and political visitors to Canada to protest the building of dams on Quebec's [[Magpie River (Quebec)|Magpie River]].&lt;ref&gt;"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the river along with numerous leaders of conservation organizations". August 02, 2004.

In November 2017, the Spanish hydroelectric syndicate, Endesa, announced its decision to abandon [[HydroAysen]], a massive project to construct dams on dozens of Patagonia's rivers accompanied by thousands of miles of roads, power lines and other infrastructure. Endesa returned its water rights to the Chilean government.

===Cape Wind===
In 2005, Kennedy clashed with national environmental groups over his opposition to a wind farm off [[Cape Cod]]. Taking the side of Cape Cod's commercial fishing industry, Kennedy argued that the [[Cape Wind Project]] in [[Nantucket Sound]] was a costly [[boondoggle]].  This position angered some environmentalists, and brought Kennedy criticism by industry groups and Republicans{{who|date=October 2017}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radioequalizer.blogspot.com/2007/07/rfk-jr-tirade-air-america-john-stossel.html|title=The Radio Equalizer: Brian Maloney: RFK Jr Tirade, Air America, John Stossel, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Little, Amanda (Jan 13, 2006).

==Personal views==

===Political criticisms===
Throughout the presidency of George W. Bush, Kennedy was a persistent critic of Bush's environmental and energy policies. He accused Bush of defunding and corrupting federal science projects.&lt;ref&gt;Griscom, Amanda (October/November 2004). "Environmental Justice". Mother Earth News.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy's February 2004 article in [[The Nation]], "The Junk Science of George W. Bush,"  in which he wrote, "The Bush Administration's first instinct when it comes to science has been to suppress, discredit or alter facts it doesn't like," has been recognized by Project Censored among top censored stories in their 2005 compilation.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Peter and Huff, Mickey (June 9, 2010). Analysis of Project Censored: Are We A Left-Leaning, Conspiracy-Oriented Organization?". ProjectCensored.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Kennedy was also critical of Bush's hydrogen car proposal, which he characterized as a gift to the fossil fuel industry disguised as a green automobile.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F. (February 16, 2003). "A Bad Element". The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy wrote an article titled, "Crimes Against Nature" about Bush's environmental record.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F. (November 24, 2003). "Crimes Against Nature". Rolling Stone.&lt;/ref&gt;  The article, which was featured in the November 24, 2003 issue of [[Rolling Stone]], was subsequently expanded into Kennedy's New York Times best-selling book of the same name, published by [[HarperCollins]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Jr., Robert F. (2004). Crimes Against Nature: How George W. Bush and His Corporate Pals Are Plundering the Country and Hijacking Our Democracy. HarperCollins. {{ISBN|0060746882}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy's opposition to the environmental policies of the Bush administration earned him recognition as one of Rolling Stone's "100 Agents of Change" on April 2, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/26754176/the_rs_100_agents_of_change/4|title=News|author=|date=|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mercurynews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2010/10/14/robert-f-kennedy-jr-advocates-for-green-power/|title=Robert F.

During an October 2012 telephone interview with [[Politico]], Kennedy called on environmentalists to direct their dissatisfaction towards the [[U.S. Congress]] rather than President [[Barack Obama]]. Kennedy reasoned that Obama "didn't deliver" due to having a partisan U.S. Congress "like we haven't seen before in American history."&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, Darius (October 12, 2012). "RFK Jr. to greens: Not Obama's fault". Politico.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also accused politicians who failed to act on climate change policy as serving special interests and, selling out the public trust. He accused [[Koch family|Charles and David Koch]], the owners of Koch Industries, Inc., the nation's largest privately owned oil company, of subverting democracy and for "making themselves billionaires by impoverishing the rest of us."&lt;ref&gt;Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (2015) "What State Attorneys General can do about Climate-Change Deniers" Letter from the President Waterkeeper Magazine Vol. 11. Issue 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy has spoken of the Koch Brothers as leading "the apocalyptical forces of Ignorance and Greed."&lt;ref&gt;Spear, Stefanie (September 10, 2015). "Koch Brothers: Apocalyptical Forces of Ignorance and Greed, Says RFK Jr.". EcoWatch.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2014 People's Climate March, Kennedy said, "American politics is driven by two forces: One is intensity, and the other is money. The Koch brothers have all the money. They're putting $300 million this year into their efforts to stop the climate bill. And the only thing we have in our power is people power, and that's why we need to put this demonstration on the street."&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Amy (September 22, 2014). "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: "The Only Thing We Have in Our Power is People Power". Democracy Now.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food allergies===
Kennedy was a founding board member of the Food Allergy Initiative. His son Conor suffers from anaphylaxis peanut allergies. Kennedy wrote the foreword to The Peanut Allergy Epidemic, in which he and the authors link increasing food allergies in children to certain vaccines that were approved beginning in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F. (June 6, 2017). Foreword for The Peanut Allergy Epidemic: What's Causing It And How To Stop It. Third Edition. by Heather Fraser, New York: Skyhorse Publishing. {{ISBN|1510726314}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Views on autism and vaccines ===
Kennedy has been a long-term advocate for reducing mercury exposures from industry and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Travers, Julia (June 16, 2017). "America's Mercury Crisis: 'Fish consumption is dangerous now' – Robert Kennedy Jr. Weighs in". Interview with Emerson Urry. ''EnviroNews''. https://www.environews.tv/061617-science-fiction-nightmare-robert-kennedy-jr-americas-mercury-loaded-fish-crisis/&lt;/ref&gt; and is an outspoken opponent of the inclusion of the mercury-based preservative, [[thimerosal]], in vaccines.

In June 2005, Kennedy authored an article in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[Salon.com]] titled ''[[Deadly Immunity]]'' alleging a government conspiracy to conceal a connection between thimerosal and the epidemic of childhood [[neurodevelopmental disorders]], including [[autism]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F. (June 16, 2005). "Deadly Immunity". ''Rolling Stone''. https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/deadly-immunity-20110209/&lt;/ref&gt; The article contained five factual errors, leading Salon.com to issue corrections.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Lauerman, Kerry (January 16, 2011). "Correcting our Record". Salon. http://www.salon.com/2011/01/16/dangerous_immunity/&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy argued that the errors were insignificant and that some were made by Salon during the editing process.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F.

World Mercury Project. https://worldmercuryproject.org/uncategorized/salons-retraction-deadly-immunity-article-real-reason-behind/&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later, on January 16, 2011, Salon retracted the article completely.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; According to Salon, the retraction was motivated by accumulating evidence of errors and [[scientific fraud]] underlying the vaccine-autism claim.&lt;ref&gt;Oransky, Ivan (January 16, 2011) "Salon retracts 2005 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. piece on alleged autism-vaccine link".

Kennedy Jr. was inadvertently broken during our redesign in the spring of 2010. (We did not remove the story from the site, as some have incorrectly alleged, nor ever contemplated doing so.)"''.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In May 2013, Kennedy delivered the keynote address at the AutismOne / [[Generation Rescue]] conference.&lt;ref name="Slate_2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Plait|first1=Phil|authorlink1=Phil Plait|title=Robert F.

In April 2015, Kennedy participated in a Speakers' Forum to promote the film, [[Trace Amounts]], which links autism to mercury in vaccinations.&lt;ref&gt;Trace Amounts: Autism, Mercury, and the Hidden Truth". (2014). FAZE Films. http://traceamounts.com/&lt;/ref&gt; At a screening of the film, Kennedy described the autism epidemic as a "holocaust."&lt;ref&gt;White, Jeremy B. (April 7, 2015).

On December 14, 2016, Kennedy launched the World Mercury Project (WMP), an advocacy group with the mission to end exposures to mercury and other toxic metals in medicine and in industry.&lt;ref&gt;"Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Launches The World Mercury Project" (November 16, 2016).

On January 10, 2017, incoming [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Sean Spicer]] confirmed that Kennedy and [[President-elect]] [[Donald Trump]] met to discuss a position in the Trump Administration. Kennedy accepted an offer made by Trump to become the chairman of the Vaccine Safety Task Force. A spokeswoman for Trump's transition said that no final decision had been made.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-to-meet-with-proponent-of-debunked-tie-between-vaccines-and-autism/2017/01/10/4a5d03c0-d752-11e6-9f9f-5cdb4b7f8dd7_story.html Phillip, Abby; Sun, Lena H. and Bernstein, Lenny (January 10, 2017) "Vaccine skeptic Robert Kennedy Jr. says Trump asked him to lead commission on 'vaccine safety'".

On February 15, 2017, Kennedy and actor [[Robert De Niro]] gave a press conference at the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] in Washington D.C., in which they accused the press of acting as propagandists for the $35 billion vaccination industry and refusing to allow debates on vaccination science. They offered a $100,000 reward to any journalist or other citizen who could point to a study showing that it is safe to inject mercury into babies and pregnant women at levels currently contained in flu vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;Walia, Arjun (February 15, 2017). "A $100,000 Message From Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &amp; Robert De Niro To American Journalists &amp; Scientists". Collective-Evolution. http://www.collective-evolution.com/2017/02/15/a-100000-message-from-robert-f-kennedy-jr-robert-de-niro-to-american-journalists-scientists/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Professor Craig Foster, the challenge is "not science. It is a carefully constructed 'contest' that allows its creators to generate the misleading outcome they presumably want to see". The challenge is unwinable, the judges are De Niro and Kennedy. The $50 fee to apply would go to the WMP, something that vaccine supports are wary to do when they feel that the challenge itself is rigged towards the anti-vax stance. Finding a winner of the challenge would completely go against the aims of Kennedy, De Niro and WMP. If the applicant disputes the "initial denial of a challenge submission" then a panel of independent scientists would be consulted, with the applicant paying half of the $400 per hour rate to evaluate the claim. The contest asks for one single study that shows the safety of thimerosal in vaccines, yet science does not allow for one study to determine anything as factual. Foster states that "Proving that something is safe is importantly different than proving that something is harmful". Foster claims that the challenge is nothing more than "celebrity-generated pseudoscience" and the public should consider vaccines safe.&lt;ref name="Craig Foster"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Foster |first1=Craig |title=The $100,000 vaccine challenge: Another method of promoting anti-vaccination pseudoscience |journal= Vaccine|date=2017 |volume=35 |issue=32 |pages=3905–3906 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17307892?via%3Dihub |accessdate=11 July 2018|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.06.012 |pmid=28624304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on the murder of Martha Moxley===
In January 2003, Kennedy wrote a controversial article in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' titled "A Miscarriage of Justice" about the 1975 [[murder of Martha Moxley]] in Greenwich, Connecticut. In the article, Kennedy insists that Michael Skakel's indictment "was triggered by an inflamed media, and that an innocent man is now in prison." Skakel and Kennedy are first cousins, as Kennedy's mother and Skakel's father are siblings. Kennedy's article presents the argument that there is more evidence suggesting that Kenneth Littleton, the Skakel family's live-in tutor, killed Moxley. He also calls Dominick Dunne the "driving force" behind Skakel's prosecution.&lt;ref name="RFKjr"&gt;{{cite web |first=Robert F. Jr |last=Kennedy |authorlink=Robert F.

===Views on JFK assassination and the Warren Commission===
On the evening of January 11, 2013, [[Charlie Rose]] interviewed Robert Kennedy Jr. and his sister Rory at the Winspear Opera House in Dallas. This was part of Mayor Mike Rawlings' hand-chosen committee's year long program of celebrating the life and presidency of John F. Kennedy. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that he was convinced that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was not solely responsible for the assassination of his uncle, President John F. Kennedy; and said his father [[Robert Kennedy]] was "fairly convinced" that others besides Oswald were involved in his brother's assassination and privately believed the [[Warren Commission]] report was a "shoddy piece of craftsmanship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/rfk-children-speak-about-assassination-dallas-0|title=RFK children speak about assassination in Dallas|work=The Big Story|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/05/26/who-killed-bobby-kennedy-his-son-rfk-jr-doesnt-believe-it-was-sirhan-sirhan/?utm_term=.aaea62dd477d|title=Who killed Bobby Kennedy?

===Views on U.S. foreign policy===
Kennedy has written extensively on foreign policy issues, beginning with a 1974 Atlantic Monthly article titled, "Poor Chile," discussing the overthrow of Chilean President, [[Salvador Allende]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F. (February 1974). "Poor Chile". Atlantic Monthly.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy also wrote editorials against the execution of Pakistan President [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] by General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr. Robert F. (February 25, 1979). "Plea to Pakistan". The Washington Post.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F. (February 23, 1979). "Legacy at Stake in Pakistan". The Boston Globe.&lt;/ref&gt;    In 1975, he published an article in The Wall Street Journal, criticizing the use of assassination as a foreign policy tool.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F. (Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (December 16, 1975) "Politics and Assassinations". The Wall Street Journal&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, he wrote an article for the [[Los Angeles Times]] decrying President Bush's use of torture as anti-American.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F. (December 17, 2005). "America's anti-torture tradition".

January 4, 2005 - December 30, 2005. by Senator Edward M. Kennedy. P.2054&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article titled "Why the Arabs Don't Want Us in Syria," published in [[Politico]] in February 2016, Kennedy referred to the "bloody history that modern interventionists like [[George W. Bush]], [[Ted Cruz]] and [[Marco Rubio]] miss when they recite their narcissistic trope that Mideast nationalists 'hate us for our freedoms.' For the most part they don't; instead they hate us for the way we betrayed those freedoms — our own ideals — within their borders."&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F. (February 23, 2016). "Why the Arabs Don't Want Us in Syria". Politico.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy blames the Syrian war on a pipeline dispute. He cites wiki-leaks documents alleging that the CIA led military and intelligence planners to foment a [[Sunni]] uprising against [[Syria]]'s president, [[Bashar al-Assad]], following his rejection of a proposed [[Qatar-Turkey pipeline]] through Syria in 2009, well before the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Jr., Robert F. (February 25, 2016). "Syria: Another Pipeline War". EcoWatch.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, Kennedy wrote an article for Rolling Stone exploring President John F.

===Political endorsements===
Kennedy served on the National Staff and as a State Coordinator for Edward M. Kennedy for President from 1979 to 1980. Prior to that he had served on Senator Kennedy's 1970 and 1976 Massachusetts Senatorial Campaigns. He was a co-founder and a former board member of the New York League of Conservation Voters.&lt;ref&gt;Brancaccio, David (January 21, 2005). "Science and Health: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.". PBS NOW.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York League of Conservative Voters. June 18, 2014. NYLCV Letterhead.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy endorsed and campaigned extensively for Vice President Al Gore during the 2000 Presidential Campaign for Election.  Kennedy openly opposed his friend Ralph Nader's Green party presidential campaign, predicting that Nader's effect could sink the Gore campaign and put George W. Bush into the White House.  In the 2004 American presidential election, Kennedy endorsed John Kerry, noting his strong environmental record.&lt;ref&gt;elch, Craig (October 29, 2003). "RFK Jr. blasts Bush, champions Kerry". The Seattle Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy has been critical of the integrity of the voting process.  In June 2006 he published an analysis in Rolling Stone magazine purporting to show that GOP operatives stole the 2004 election for President George W Bush.  Kennedy's conclusions were strongly attacked by [[Farhad Manjoo]] in a June 3, 2006 Salon.com article.&lt;ref&gt;Manjoo, Farhad (June 03, 2006). "Was the 2004 election stolen? No" Salon.com.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in a critical response to Monjoo's attack, historian Eric Zuesse argued that Kennedy's analysis had been correct.&lt;ref&gt;Zuesse, Eric (October 25, 2016). "How the 2004 Presidential 'Election' Was Stolen by George W. Bush". Washington's Blog.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy has written frequent warnings about the ease of election hacking and the dangers of voter purges and voter ID laws.  He wrote the introduction and a chapter in Billionaires and Ballot Bandits, a 2012 book on election hacking by investigative journalist [[Greg Palast]].&lt;ref&gt;Greg Palast (Author) Ted Rall (Illustrator).

===Political aspirations===
Kennedy first considered running for political office in 2000, when New York Senator Moynihan announced he would not seek re-election to the [[List of United States Senators from New York|U.S. Senate seat]] formerly held by Kennedy's father.&lt;ref&gt;Bumiller, Elizabeth (November 24, 1998). "Putting Family Life Ahead of a Senate Seat". The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;  His father was elected to the same seat in 1964, and held it for 41 months, until his death in 1968.

In 2005, Kennedy considered running for New York Attorney General. The possibility of a matchup against his then brother-in-law Andrew Cuomo generated media interest. Kennedy again decided not to run, despite being considered the frontrunner if he were to run.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Jonathan P. (Jan 25, 2005). "Robert Kennedy Won't Run for State Attorney General". The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2008, Kennedy announced that he did not wish to be appointed to the U.S. Senate by New York Governor David Paterson. He felt that it would take too much time away from his family.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Jonathan P. (December 2, 2008). "Robert F. Kennedy's Son Not Interested in Senate Seat". The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media work==
Kennedy co-hosts the ''[[Ring of Fire (radio program)|Ring of Fire]]'' radio program alongside [[Mike Papantonio]],&lt;ref&gt;Spear, Stefanie (May 31, 2013). "RFK, Jr. Exposes Climate Criminals on Ring of Fire Radio". EcoWatch.&lt;/ref&gt; even though Kennedy suffers from [[spasmodic dysphonia]], a disorder that makes speech difficult, and causes the voice to [[:wikt:quaver|quaver]].&lt;ref name=LCox&gt;Cox, Lauren (July 3, 2008). "Kennedy's Voice Draws Attention to Rare Disorder". ABC News.&lt;/ref&gt; The show provides progressive news and commentary.

Kennedy has written two books and several articles on environmental issues. His articles have appeared in publications such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside magazine]]'', and ''[[The Village Voice]]''.

==Personal life==

=== General interests ===
Kennedy is a licensed master [[Falconry|falconer]], and has trained hawks since he was 11. He breeds hawks and falcons and is also licensed as a raptor propagator and a wildlife rehabilitator.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinowitz, Susan. (December 10, 2014). "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – The Bird Rehabilitator". Pet Place.&lt;/ref&gt; He holds permits for Federal Game Keeper, Bird Bander, and Scientific Collector. He was President of the New York State Falconry Association from 1988 to 1991. In 1987, while serving on Governor Mario Cuomo's New York State Falconry Advising Committee, Kennedy authored the examination to qualify apprentice falconers given by New York State. Later that year he wrote the ''New York State Apprentice Falconer's Manual'',  which was published by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and continues in use today.&lt;ref&gt;News Staff (February 15, 2002). "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to speak at Syracuse University". Syracuse University News.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy is also a whitewater kayaker. His father introduced him and his siblings to whitewater kayaking during early trips down the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green]] and [[Yampa River]]s in Utah and Colorado, the [[Columbia River]], the [[Middle Fork Salmon River|Middle Fork Salmon]] in Idaho, and the Upper Hudson Gorge. From 1976 to 1981, Kennedy was a partner and guide at a white water company, "Utopian," based in West Forks, Maine. He organized and led several "first-descent" white-water expeditions to Latin America including three to hitherto unexplored rivers: the [[Apurímac River|Apurimac]], Peru, in 1975; the [[Atrato]], Colombia, in 1979; and the [[Caroní River|Caroni]],Venezuela, in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Collier, Peter and Horowitz, David (1984). The Kennedys: An American Drama. Published by Summit Books. p. 576. {{ISBN|0671447939}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He made an early descent of [[Great Whale River]] in Northern Quebec, in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;Bowermaster, Jon (May 1993). "Sacrificial People–Will Quebec's Indians be Driven from Their Land?". Conde Nast Traveller.&lt;/ref&gt; and has made many trips to Patagonia, Chile to run the Biobío River, the Futaleufú and other whitewater rivers.

In 2015, he took two of his sons to the Yukon to visit [[Mount Kennedy]] and run the [[Alsek River]], a whitewater river fed by the [[Alsek Glacier]], which flows off Mt. Kennedy. Mt. Kennedy was the highest unclimbed peak in Canada, when the Canadian Government named it for the assassinated American president, in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Jourdan, Michael (August 5, 2015). "Mountain Tribute to JFK Evoked by Kennedy Trip to Yukon". National Geographic.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy's father, Robert Kennedy, was the first to climb Mt. Kennedy in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Robert (April 9, 1965). "Our Climb Up Mt. Kennedy". Life.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriages and children===
Kennedy married Emily Ruth Black (b. 1957) on April 3, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;UPI (April 4, 1982). "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Weds Law Classmate". The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;  They had two children: Robert Francis "Bobby" Kennedy III (b. 1984) and Kathleen Rose Kennedy (b. 1988). The couple separated in 1992 and divorced in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Dan (March 28, 1994). "Chronicle". The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 1994, Kennedy married Mary Kathleen Richardson (1959–2012) aboard a research vessel on the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref&gt;Brozan, Nadine (April 20, 1994). "Chronicle". The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;  They had four children: John Conor Richardson Kennedy (b. 1994), Kyra LeMoyne Kennedy (b. 1995), William Finbar "Finn" Kennedy (b. 1997), and Aidan Caohman Vieques Kennedy (b. 2001). On May 12, 2010, Kennedy filed for divorce from Mary; three days later she was charged with drunken driving. On May 16, 2012, Mary was found dead in a building on the grounds of her Mount Kisco, New York, home.  The Westchester County Medical Examiner ruled the death to be a suicide due to asphyxiation from hanging.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Christine. (May 17, 2012). "Police: Mary Kennedy Committed Suicide". The Bedford Daily Voice.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy married his third wife, actress-director [[Cheryl Hines]], on August 2, 2014, at the [[Kennedy Compound|Kennedy compound]] in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;McNeil, Liz (August 2, 2014). "Cheryl Hines Marries Robert F. Kennedy Jr.". People.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
In 1983, at age 29, Kennedy was arrested in a [[Rapid City, South Dakota]] airport for [[heroin]] possession after a search of his carry-on bag uncovered the drug, following a near overdose in flight.&lt;ref&gt;AP (February 18, 1984). "Robert Kennedy Jr. Admits He Is Guilty In Possessing Heroin". The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy entered a guilty [[plea]] to  Presiding Judge Marshall P. Young, who sentenced him to two years' [[probation]] and 1,500 hours of [[community service]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff writer (March 17, 1984). "Kennedy Son Given Probation in Drug Case". The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;   Following his arrest, Kennedy  entered a drug treatment center and left employment as a government prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;Leibovich, Mark (June 25, 2006). "Another Kennedy Living Dangerously". The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Kennedy hired William Wegner to work for Riverkeeper. He was a fishery scientist and falconer who had been sentenced to five years in prison; he served three years after pleading guilty to federal criminal charges for smuggling bird eggs from Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, Bob (April 2, 1996). "Bird Smuggler Sentenced to Prison". Los Angeles Times.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, Robert Boyle, Riverkeeper's founder and former president, fired Wegner, citing his criminal conviction, but Kennedy re-hired Wegner, believing he should be given a second chance. A majority of the Riverkeeper Board supported Kennedy's decision, but seven members joined Boyle in resigning.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Sam (May 22, 2017). "Robert H. Boyle, a Watchdog of the Hudson River, Dies at 88" The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, ''The New York Post'' released excerpts from Kennedy's 2001 diary, in which Kennedy described multiple affairs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2013/09/08/rfk-jr-s-sex-diary-of-adultery/|title=RFK's sex diary: His secret journal of affairs - New York Post|date=September 8, 2013|work=New York Post|accessdate=October 23, 2014|first1=Isabel|last1=Vincent|first2=Melissa|last2=Klein}}&lt;/ref&gt; and penned his opinions about public figures.&lt;ref name="New York Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2013/09/09/diary-bombshell-rfks-secret-slams-against-al-sharpton-jesse-jackson-and-gov-cuomo/|title=Diary bombshell: RFK's slams against Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson and Gov.

===Health===
Kennedy suffers from [[spasmodic dysphonia]], a disorder that makes speech difficult, and causes the voice to [[:wikt:quaver|quaver]].&lt;ref name=LCox/&gt;

===Selected awards and recognition===
Over the course of his career, Kennedy has received numerous awards in his name and on behalf of organizations and causes that he has championed.

'''Ron Smith''' (born 8 April 1951) is an American [[small arms]] designer and President of [[Smith Enterprise Inc.]] Smith is most famous for developing the [[Vortex Flash Hider]] for use on a variety of small arms and developing the major upgrades and refinements found on the [[M14 rifle]], particularly the [[Mk 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle|United States Navy Mark 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle]].&lt;ref name=Janes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutshaw|first= Charles Q|title=New-era M14 alleviates reliability issues|journal=Jane's International Defence Review|volume=39|year=2006|publisher=Jane's Information Group|page=87|ISSN= 0020-6512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Smith became a Certified Journeyman in Ordnance and Metallurgy at age 22 in California in the San Francisco Bay Area working at his father's facility in 1972, trained by immigrant German, Austrian, Hungarian, French and Czechoslovakian craftsmen and ordnance manufacturers. In 1979 he became co-owner with his father and the company relocated to Mesa, Az and became Western Ordnance International (dba Smith Enterprise).&lt;ref name=DLong/&gt; The company produced over 500,000 M16 bolt carriers 60,000 M16 bolts, M14 receivers and building M14 and M16 rifles as well as M1911 handgunss, ANS/PVS5 night vision goggles for Lorton, ITT, and Varo of Garland, Texas.&lt;ref name="Warner1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Warner|title=Gun Digest|date=July 1986|publisher=DBI Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-0-87349-001-6|pages=297–299|chapter=Colt's Double Eagle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith served in the [[US Army]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]] for a total of 16 years of active duty. While serving in the Army, Smith was stationed in South Korea as a [[Staff Sergeant]] and chief of a [[M109 howitzer|M109A3 Howitzer]] battery. He was certified with nuclear credentials to man the nuclear M109A3 in preparation for a possible invasion by [[North Korea]].

==Western Ordnance==
Smith was a partner at Western Ordnance, a firearms manufacturing firm that specialized in rifles such as the [[M1 Garand]] and M14. Western Ordnance was founded in 1979 by Smith's father, Richard Smith, in [[Mesa, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book|title=The Classic M1 Garand: An Ongoing Legacy For Shooters and Collectors |last=Thompson |first=Jim |page=16 |publisher= [[Paladin Press]]|location=Boulder, Colorado|ISBN=9781581602609|year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Western Ordnance, Smith was the first person to design and field a commercial [[flash suppressor]]. Smith would also invent a [[sound suppressor]] that could be rebuilt as opposed to being obsolete after firing a number of rounds.&lt;ref name=DLong&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mini-14: The Plinker, Hunter, Assault, and Everything Else Rifle|first=Duncan |last=Long|publisher= Paladin Press|edition=11|year= 1987|page=87|ISBN=978-0873644075|location=Boulder, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He developed the first full size double action 1911 on a Series 70 frame for [[Colt's Manufacturing Company]] that later became the [[Colt Double Eagle]].&lt;ref name="Warner1986"/&gt;

==Smith Enterprise Inc.==

'''Clotilde Mela Rosa Luciano''', better known as '''Rosita Melo''' (July 9, 1897&amp;nbsp;– August 12, 1981), was an [[Argentine]]-[[Uruguayan people|Uruguayan]] pianist, composer and poet. She is the author of the famous [[Creole Waltz]] ''"Desde el alma"'' for which she is known as the first widely recognized female [[Rioplatense Spanish|Rioplatense Hispanic]] composer in the world.

==Family Life==
Rosita was born in [[Montevideo]] on July 9, 1897, as the youngest child of [[Italians|Italian]] immigrants Michele Mela and Rosa Luciano de Mela.&lt;ref name="barriodeflores"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barriodeflores.com.ar/personalidades/rosita_melo/rosita_melo.htm|title=Rosita Melo - Personalidades del barrio de Flores - El Portal del barrio de Flores -|publisher=barriodeflores.com.ar|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was baptized at the cathedral of Montevideo. Shortly after, the family migrated to Argentina in 1900. They settled in [[Buenos Aires]] when Rosita was three years old. On February 23, 1922, she married the young poet and writer Victor Piuma Vélez who would write the lyrics for all her compositions.

==Musical influence==
Rosita showed a great talent for music. At the age of four she could already play the piano by ear. Once in primary school, she never gave up her music studies.&lt;ref name="rositamelo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rositamelo.com/biogeng.doc|title=TRADUCCIÓN|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later studied piano in Buenos Aires and ultimately became a professor of piano and concert at the prestigious Thibaud-Piazzini [[music school|conservatory]].

==Works==
Throughout her life, she created a body of work that includes [[tango (dance)|tango]], [[waltz]], classical and Creole waltzes, [[pasodoble]]s, [[polkas]] and [[March (music)|marches]]. Among them: "Oración", "Tatita" and "Aquel entonces" as well as the waltzes "Yo te adoro", "Por el camino", "Una lágrima para papá", "Cuando de ti ya lejos" and "Aquellos catorce años".&lt;ref&gt;http://danzadetango.com/articulos-03.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The poems of Rosita were published in newspapers and cultural magazines of her time. Her poems were published in the book "Antología de poetas jóvenes" ("Anthology of Young Poets") alongside those of [[Alfonsina Storni]] and other famous contemporary poets. She gave many concerts of both [[classical music|classical]] and [[popular music]] in different cultural centers in Buenos Aires, earning medals and awards.
She was appointed as a representative of music in a ceremony held at the [[Teatro Colón]] in Buenos Aires.

&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Desde el Alma]] --&gt;

In 1911, at the age of 14, Rosita Melo composed her first and now world-famous Boston-style Creole waltz ''"Desde el Alma"'' (''"From the Soul"'').&lt;ref name="clubdetango"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clubdetango.com.ar/articulos/rosita1.htm|title=CLUB DE TANGO&amp;nbsp; &amp;#124;&amp;nbsp; Rosita Melo - Bajo el signo del vals|publisher=clubdetango.com.ar|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources date the composition between 1911 and 1917.
Rosita is quoted saying it was the work of an adolescent.

The waltz's theme is dedicated to the love of a mother.

Her husband, Victor Piuma Vélez, would write the first set of lyrics for it, years later.

By 1921, [[Roberto Firpo]] had recorded four instrumental waltzes of Rosita.&lt;ref name="clubdetango"/&gt;
In 1948, [[Homero Manzi]] wanted to include the waltz in the movie ''"Pobre mi madre querida"'', but with different lyrics rewritten by himself which would be sung by [[Hugo del Carril]].

Vélez and Melo initially opposed the idea, and requested that if Manzi wrote new lyrics, Vélez's name should be included as co-author. Manzi ultimately agreed, the lyrics became famous and the waltz, already a classic by the time, became universally famous.

Manzi's lyrics remain the most famous ones and are often reinterpreted in different versions of the song when performed by other musicians:

{{cita|Soul, if they have hurt you so much

Why do you refuse to forget?

Why do you prefer

to cry for what you've lost

to look for what you've wanted

to call for what has died?

You live needlessly sad

and I know that you never deserved

to redeem with sorrow

the blame of being good,

as good as you were, for love.

It was what once began

what later ceased to be.

What at the end, for the fault of a mistake

was a bitter night for the heart.

Forget those letters!

Come back to your old dream.

Together with the pain

that opens a wound

life arrives, bringing love.

You live needlessly sad

and I know that you never deserved

to redeem with sorrow

the blame of being good,

as good as you were, for love&lt;ref name="planet-tango"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planet-tango.com/lyrics/desdelma.htm|title=Vals Desde el alma|publisher=planet-tango.com|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Death==
After her husband passed away in 1976, Rosita Melo died in Buenos Aires on August 12, 1981 and was buried at the "Rincón de las Personalidades" ("Corner of Personalities") in the [[Chacarita Cemetery]] there. Her two daughters had a monument erected in her memory there.

'''Sister Outsider''' is a poetry duo that specializes in [[slam poetry]] or [[spoken word]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salazar|first1=Alejandra|title=Slam Poets Sister Outsider Fight With Their Words|url=http://stanfordartsreview.com/slam-poets-sister-outsider-fight-with-their-words/|work=Stanford Arts Review|date=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominique Christina and [[Denice Frohman]] are both [[Women of the World Poetry Slam]] Champions. Their collaboration has brought them success over the last two years as they have been to over 90 universities, colleges, conferences, and many other spaces across the United States. Inspired by the life of [[Audre Lorde]], their premise is to encourage students and people across all generations to understand the power of art. They believe art can be a form of activism and expression that goes well beyond the page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sisteroutsiderpoetry.com/who-we-are|website=Sister Outsider Poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from their vivid performances, Sister Outsider also offers workshops to help students with their poetry writing as well as the delivery aspect to slam poetry.

== Poetry == 
Christina and Frohman specialize in poetry about injustice amongst marginalized communities, people of color, and LGBTQ communities. Through poetry they break the silence and use it as a tool for social change on poverty issues and stereotypes amongst these communities . They stand against such margins of violent and unhealthy culture by going by the slogan, "We Exist. We Resist." Their use of spoken word and personal stories spark conversation and encourage discussion on political and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sisteroutsiderpoetry.com/who-we-are|website=Sister Outsider Poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ability to incorporate activism with writing is what makes this duo inspiring.

== Reviews ==
“Before Sister Outsider left the Wabash campus, students were already discussing how best to go about bringing them back again. Sister Outsider provided the campus with an extremely engaging and entertaining evening of stellar performances during an evening show that was filled to capacity. Thank you Sister Outsider, for providing such needed and appreciated work.”

'''-Professor Perez, History Dept., ShOUT &amp; Unidos Por Sangre Student Org. Advisor, Wabash College'''

“Sister Outsider’s performance to packed audience at Dartmouth College was inspiring in its honesty, integrity and ability to use the spoken word as a platform for education, communication, and social change. Their performance and workshops provided a space for all students to think critically, question, and challenge the status quo. For students who feel outside the norm or at the margins of acceptance, Sister Outsider’s poetry and message reinforces the fact that their presence, position, and voice are equal in both legitimacy and importance. The strength of their poetry reminds everyone that no one should apologize for her/his place in the world, but rather demand the rights their humanity affords.”

'''-Dr. Fluri, Director, Women's and Gender Studies Program, Dartmouth College'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sisteroutsiderpoetry.com/what-they-say1|title=What They Say - Sister Outsider Poetry|website=www.sisteroutsiderpoetry.com|access-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanley De Brath''' (10 October 1854 – 20 December 1937) was a British [[civil engineer]], [[Parapsychology|psychical researcher]] and spiritualist.&lt;ref name="Geni"&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Stanley-De-Brath-M-Inst-C-E/5520318834300076090 "Stanley De Brath, M.Inst.C.E."] Geni.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Brath was born in [[Sydenham|Sydenham, Kent]]. He worked as a civil engineer in [[India]] for 17 years.&lt;ref name="Geni"/&gt; He was most well known for his book ''Psychic Philosophy as the Foundation of a Religion of Natural Law'', published in 1896. [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] had written an introduction for the book and considered it of "great lucidity, a philosophy of the universe and of human nature in its threefold aspect of body, soul, and spirit". The book was expanded in 1908 and endorsed by Wallace in a prefatory note.&lt;ref name="Fichman"&gt;Fichman, Martin. (2004). ''An Elusive Victorian: The Evolution of Alfred Russel Wallace''. University of Chicago Press. pp. 302-303. {{ISBN|978-0226246130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brath was a [[Christian]] and believed that both Christianity and [[spiritualism]] were compatible.&lt;ref name="Fichman"/&gt;

Brath also translated a number of [[Parapsychology|psychical research]] books into English. He translated [[Charles Richet]]'s ''Thirty Years of Psychical Research'' (1923).&lt;ref name="Geni"/&gt;

He was the editor of ''Psychic Science'' a journal published by the [[British College of Psychic Science]].&lt;ref name="Geni"/&gt;

His books were criticized by the [[scientific community]]. The sociologist [[Guy Benton Johnson]] ridiculed ''Psychical Research, Science, and Religion'' in a review as an anti-scientific work and only "grand-reading if you have a sense of humor."&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Benton Johnson|Johnson, Guy B]]. (1927). ''Reviewed Work: Psychical Research, Science, and Religion. by Stanley de Brath''. ''[[Social Forces]]'' 5: 531-532.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''steel detailer''' is a person who produces detailed drawings for [[fabrication (metal)|steel fabricators]] and steel erectors.  The detailer prepares detailed plans, drawings and other documents for the manufacture and erection of steel members ([[column]]s, [[Beam (structure)|beams]], [[brace (architecture)|braces]], [[truss]]es, [[stairway|stairs]], [[handrail]]s, [[joist]]s, [[metal decking]], ''etc.'') used in the construction of [[building]]s, [[bridge]]s, industrial plans, and [[nonbuilding structure]]s.  A steel detailer's projects are usually commercial, residential, public, industrial or municipal; low-rise residential projects..

Steel detailers (usually simply called ''detailers'' within their field) work closely with [[architect]]s, [[structural engineering|engineers]], [[general contractor]]s and steel fabricators.  They usually find employment with steel fabricators, engineering firms, or independent steel detailing companies.  Steel detailing companies and self-employed detailers [[subcontract]] primarily to steel fabricators and sometimes to general contractors and engineers.

==Training and certification==

===USA===
[[Academic degree|Collegiate degree]] programs specific to structural steel detailing are rare to nonexistent in the U.S., but more general degree and certification programs may be found with curricula pertaining to design, manual or computer-aided drafting in general, or specific computer-aided drafting software.  A college degree is not required to become a steel detailer in the U.S.  Training is usually provided on the job, with a new trainee usually needing about five years of practice under an experienced detailer to become proficient with all of the requirements of the trade. Practitioners of this occupation in the U.S. may range from degreed, and possibly licensed, civil/structural engineers to those with little or no formal academic training who nevertheless possess extensive industry experience.

Certification of structural steel detailers is not required in the [[United States]].  The [[National Institute of Steel Detailing]] (NISD) offers a selection of certification programs for steel detailers and detailing companies, but these are strictly voluntary.

===Canada===
In Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada there are College courses specifically for Steel Detailing.  Vancouver Community College Downtown Campus has been offering a Steel Detailing Certificate for many years.  It is approximately a one-year program.  BCIT (British Columbia Institute of Technology) also offers training.  Many of the most well trained Steel Detailers in British Columbia have attended these institutions.

==Responsibilities==

A steel detailer prepares two primary types of drawings: [[erection drawings]] and [[shop drawings]].

Erection drawings are used to guide the steel erector on the construction site ("in the field") as to where and how to erect the fabricated steel members.  These drawings usually show dimensioned plans to locate the steel members, and they often also show details with specific information and requirements, including all work that must be done in the field (such as [[bolted joint|bolting]], [[welding]] or installing [[wedge anchor]]s).  Since the erection drawings are intended for use in the field, they contain very little specific information about the fabrication of any individual steel member; members should already be completed by the time the erection drawings are used.

Shop drawings, also called detail drawings, are used to specify the exact detailing requirements for fabricating each individual member (or "piece") of a structure, and are used by the steel fabricator to fabricate these members. Complete shop drawings show material specifications, member sizes, all required dimensions, welding, [[bolted joint|bolting]], surface preparation and [[paint]]ing requirements, and any other information required to describe each completed member.  The shop drawings are intended for use by the fabrication shop, and thus contain little or no information about the erection and installation of the steel members they depict; this information belongs in the erection drawings.

The detailer must comply with the requirements of the design drawings and with all industry standards and protocols, such as those established by the [[American Institute of Steel Construction]] (AISC) and the [[American Welding Society]] (AWS).  The detailer is usually not responsible for design, including structural strength, stiffness, and stability (which are the responsibility of the structural engineer), major dimensions of the structure and compliance with relevant [[building code]]s (which are the responsibility of the architect).  A detailer is generally required to submit his drawings to the structural engineer and/or architect for review prior to the release of drawings for fabrication.  However, to complete his drawings,  an experienced steel detailer usually suggests connections subject to the approval of the structural engineer in cases where the structural drawings have insufficient information. In these situations, the steel detailer is guided by his experience and knowledge of existing engineering codes such as the Steel Construction Manual published by AISC.

In the case of non-building structures there is typically no architect, and detail drawings are reviewed exclusively by the structural engineer of record. This design review ideally assures engineering accuracy and compliance with the design intent.

==Techniques==

Traditionally, steel detailing was accomplished via manual drafting methods, using pencils, paper, and [[Technical drawing tools|drafting tools]] such as a parallel bar or [[drafting machine]], triangles, templates of circles and other useful shapes, and mathematical tables, such as tables of logarithms and other useful calculational aids. Eventually, hand held calculators were incorporated into the traditional practice.

Today, manual drafting has been largely replaced by [[computer-aided design|computer-aided drafting]] (CAD). A steel detailer using computer-aided methods creates his drawings on a [[computer]], using [[computer software|software]] specifically designed for the purpose, and printing out his drawings on paper only when they are complete.  Many detailers would add another classification for those using 3-D Modeling applications specifically designed for steel detailing, as the process for the production of drawings using these applications is markedly different from a 2-D drafting approach. The detailer literally builds the project in 3D before producing detailed shop drawings from the model. 

Structural steel detailing requires skills in [[technical drawing|drafting]], [[mathematics]] (including [[geometry]] and [[trigonometry]]), [[logic]], [[reasoning]], spatial visualization, and communication.  A basic knowledge of general engineering principles and the methods of structural and miscellaneous steel fabrication, however acquired, is essential to the practice of this discipline. A computer-aided detailer also requires skills in using computers and an understanding of the specific CAD software he is to use.

A detailer's drawings generally go through several phases. If there is any unclear information that would prevent the detailer from creating or completing the drawings accurately, a request for information(RFI)&lt;ref name=Tekla-Basic-Concepts&gt;[http://www.tekla.com/international/solutions/building-construction/Pages/basic-concepts.aspx Steel Detailing Concepts and Terminology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528033316/http://www.tekla.com/international/solutions/building-construction/Pages/basic-concepts.aspx |date=2008-05-28 }}, Tekla Structures&lt;/ref&gt; is sent to the relevant trades(typically the general contractor, architect or structural engineer) before proceeding. If the required information is not needed immediately, then the detailer may opt to list the questions on the drawings. Following creation of the drawing, the detailer must usually (as described above) submit a copy of the drawing to the architect and engineer for review ("approval"). Copies of the drawing may be sent to other recipients at this time as well, such as the general contractor, for informational purposes only. The drawing must also be checked for accuracy and completeness by another detailer (for this purpose, the "checker"). To keep track of changes during the drawing creation [[workflow]], the revisions are identified by incrementing an associated number or letter code which should appear in the drawing revision block. Comments arising from approval and corrections made during checking must be resolved, and the original drawing must be updated accordingly (or "scrubbed"). After this, the drawing may be released to the fabricator and/or erector for use in construction.

[[File:Trauco.jpg|thumb|Artist's representation of the Trauco]]

In the traditional [[Chilota mythology]] of [[Chiloé]], the '''Trauco''' is a humanoid creature of small stature - similar to a [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] or [[goblin]] - who lives in the deep forests. It has an ugly face, and legs without feet.

== Legend ==
The '''Trauco''' is a mythical entity who inhabits the woods of [[Chiloé]], an island in the south of [[Chile]]. It has a powerful magnetism that attracts young and middle-aged women. According to myth, the Trauco's wife is the wicked and ugly '''Fiura'''. The trauco carries a small stone-headed hatchet that he uses to strike trees in the forest to symbolize his sexual potency.

Whomever the Trauco chooses will go to him, even if she is sleeping, and fall enraptured at his feet. No woman can resist his magical attraction; all have sexual intercourse with him. Some men of Chiloé fear the Trauco, as his gaze can be deadly.

When a single woman is pregnant and no one steps forward as the father, people assume that the Trauco is the father. Because the Trauco is irresistible, the woman is considered blameless. The Trauco is sometimes invoked to explain sudden or unwanted pregnancies, especially in unmarried women.

== Media ==

The Trauco appears in [[The Luke Coles Book Series]] by [[Josh Walker (author)|Josh Walker]] where he functions as an antagonist in some of the subplots.

'''Tyrone Tootoosis''' (May 9, 1958 – February 12, 2017) was a Plains Cree storyteller, activist, culture keeper and dancer. He was born on May 9, 1958 on the [[Samson Indian Reserve No. 137|Samson Reserve]] in Alberta, Canada and raised on the [[Poundmaker Cree Nation|Poundmaker Cree Nation Reserve]] in Saskatchewan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62134610|title=Saskatchewan First Nations : lives past and present|date=2004|publisher=Canadian Plains Research Center, University of Regina|others=Thompson, Christian, 1954–, University of Regina. Canadian Plains Research Center.|isbn=0889771618|location=Regina|oclc=62134610}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Tootoosis family and was a descendent of Yellow Mud Blanket, a brother of [[Pîhtokahanapiwiyin]], also known as Chief Poundmaker. His grandfather was [[John Tootoosis]], was an activist for First Nations rights and founder of the Saskatchewan Indian Federation and he was the first born son of Wilfred Tootoosis,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/tyrone-tootoosis-was-a-walking-library-and-a-keeper-of-cree-culture/article34261220/|title=Tyrone Tootoosis was 'a walking library' and a keeper of Cree culture|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; a historian and storyteller and Irene B. Tootoosis. He was married to Winona Wheeler, a professor of Indigenous studies at the [[University of Saskatchewan]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Actor [[Gordon Tootoosis]] was his uncle.

Tootoosis dedicated his life to revitalizing Cree culture and had a close relationship with his grandfather John Tootoosis, learning the culture and traditions of his people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/tyrone-tootoosis-funeral-1.3985021|title='He did so much for all First Nations': Hundreds honour Tyrone Tootoosis|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He recorded the stories and voices of Elders. Following the tradition of his family, he became a culture keeper for his community&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and was a storyteller, historian, [[pow wow]] dancer and social activist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He worked to develop the [[Wanuskewin Heritage Park]] and the Saskatchewan Native Theatre Company, now named the Gordon Tootoosis Theatre Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gtnt.ca/|title=Gordon Tootoosis Nikaniwin Theatre {{!}} Transformation through Indigenous performances|website=www.gtnt.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following in the traditions of his uncle Gordon Tootoosis, Tootoosis appeared in several films, including &amp;nbsp;''DreamKeeper''&amp;nbsp;(2003),&amp;nbsp;''Wapos Bay: Long Goodbyes''&amp;nbsp;(2011) and&amp;nbsp;''Christmas at Wapos Bay''&amp;nbsp;(2002). Tootoosis played Poundmaker, his great-great-granduncle, in the TV mini-series, ''Big Bear'' (1998).

Tootoosis' storytelling had significant impact.

==Early life and background==
Marchetti was born in [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 21| issue = 1| pages = 12| last = Warner| first = John S.| title = The Marchetti Case; New Case Law| url= https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80S01268A000200020024-4.pdf| journal = Studies in Intelligence| date = 1977}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1951 to 1953, he served as a corporal in U.S. Army Intelligence in France and Germany.{{sfn|Warner|1977|p=1}} Returning to the U.S. after his military service, he enrolled in [[Pennsylvania State University]], where he majored in Russian area studies, graduating with a bachelor's degree in history in 1955.{{sfn|Warner|1977|p=1}} 

==Career in the Central Intelligence Agency==
After a few months working as an analyst at the National Security Agency, Marchetti joined the CIA in October 1955.{{sfn|Warner|1977|p=1}} He began his career as an analyst in the Office of Research and Reports, eventually serving a tour of duty in the Office of National Estimates (ONE).{{sfn|Warner|1977|p=2}}

From ONE, Marchetti moved to the Office of Planning, Programming, and Budgeting in 1966, where he worked for over two years.{{sfn|Warner|1977|p=2}} Beginning in July 1968, he served for nine months as special assistant to [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Deputy Director]] [[Rufus Taylor]].{{sfn|Warner|1977|p=2}} His final position in the Agency was on the Planning, Programming, and Budget Staff of the [[National Photographic Interpretation Center]].{{sfn|Warner|1977|p=2}} Among other projects with which he was involved, Marchetti worked on setting up the [[Pine Gap]] [[satellite ground station]] near [[Alice Springs]] in Central [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pilger, John, ''A Secret Country'', Vintage Books, London, 1992, {{ISBN|9780099152316}}, pp. 185, 197-98, 210, 216, 225, 353, 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1969, Marchetti resigned from the CIA.{{sfn|Warner|1977|p=2}}

==Writing career==
After leaving the CIA, Marchetti began a writing career. His first work was a novel called ''The Rope-Dancer,'' published in 1971. The plot involves an officer in the "National Intelligence Agency" who becomes a spy for the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0028-7504| last = Barnet| first = Richard J.| title = The CIA's New Cover| accessdate = 2018-11-26| date = 1971-12-30| url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1971/12/30/the-cias-new-cover/}}&lt;/ref&gt; During public appearances promoting his novel, Marchetti announced that he was writing a non-fiction work on the agency, and in March 1972 he completed a draft of an article for Esquire magazine which according to a later CIA account, included "names of agents, relations with named governments, and identifying details of ongoing operations."{{sfn|Warner|1977|p=2}} CIA received a copy of the article and an outline of Marchetti's book which he had submitted to a publisher, and decided to seek an injunction against publication.{{sfn|Warner|1977|p=2}}

On December 12, 1972, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] denied Marchetti's appeal challenging a CIA policy that former employees must submit materials to the Agency for approval prior to publication.
&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune; December 12, 1972"&gt;{{cite news |date=December 12, 1972 |title=Author to Defy Court on Book Ban |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1972/12/12/page/27/article/author-to-defy-court-on-book-ban |work=Chicago Tribune |volume=125 |issue=347 |edition=Final |publisher=Chicago Tribune Company |at=Section 1A, page 7 |access-date=July 31, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marchetti said he planned to continue with his book.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune; December 12, 1972"/&gt;

In 1974, Marchetti's book was published as ''[[The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence]] |last1=Marchetti |first1=Victor |last2=Marks |first2=John D. |authorlink2=John D. Marks |year=1974 |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |isbn=978-0-394-48239-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, co-written with [[John D. Marks]], was harshly critical of the CIA. Before publication, the CIA demanded that Marchetti remove 399 passages, but Marchetti resisted and only 168 passages were [[censorship|censored]].&lt;ref&gt; Marchetti, Victor and John D. Marks. 1974. [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/342587.The_CIA_And_The_Cult_Of_Intelligence "The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence."] New York, NY: Dell Publishing Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source-inline|date=September 2014}} It is the first book the federal government of the United States ever went to court to censor before its publication. The publisher ([[Alfred A. Knopf]]) chose to publish the book with blanks for censored passages and with boldface type for passages that were challenged but later uncensored.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 1976 Marchetti published ''Foreign and Military Intelligence''{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} and in 1978 he published an article about the [[JFK assassination]] in the [[far-right]] newspaper of the [[Liberty Lobby]], ''[[The Spotlight]].'' Marchetti, a proponent of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories#Organized crime conspiracy|organized crime and the CIA conspiracy]] theory, claimed that the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] revealed a CIA memo from 1966 that named [[E. Howard Hunt]], [[Frank Sturgis]] and [[Gerry Patrick Hemming]] in the JFK assassination. Marchetti also claimed that [[Marita Lorenz]] offered sworn testimony to confirm this. The HSCA reported that it had not received such a memo and rejected theories that Hunt was involved in a plot to kill Kennedy.&lt;ref name="Miami Herald; February 2, 1985"&gt;{{cite news |last=Doig |first=Stephen K. |date=February 2, 1985 |title=Ex-CIA agent admits he used JFK 'rumors' |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP91-00587R000100610022-2.pdf |work=Miami Herald |location=Miami |page=2B |access-date=April 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[E. Howard Hunt]] sued the Liberty Lobby and Marchetti for [[defamation]] and won $650,000 in damages. Liberty Lobby appealed the case with lawyer, [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]]. On February 1, 1985, Marchetti stated that key parts of his of articles were based upon rumors that he heard from ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' columnist Bill Corson and that he had no corroboration of Corson's story.&lt;ref name="Miami Herald; February 2, 1985"/&gt; Corson had provided an earlier deposition stating that he not discussed the rumors with Marchetti.&lt;ref name="Miami Herald; February 2, 1985"/&gt; Marchetti, Liberty Lobby and Lane won the appeal in 1985.&lt;ref name="Miami Herald; February 7, 1985"&gt;{{cite news |last=Doig |first=Stephen K. |date=February 7, 1985 |title=Hunt-JFK article 'trash' but not libelous, jury finds |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90-00806R000100650001-8.pdf |work=Miami Herald |location=Miami |page=1A |access-date=April 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting afterward, two jurors rejected that the conspiracy theories offered by Lane influenced the verdict.&lt;ref name="Miami Herald; February 7, 1985"/&gt; Lane wrote a book, ''[[Plausible Denial]]'', to describe the unfolding of that historic trial.

==Death==
Marchetti suffered from dementia in his last years. He died at his home in [[Ashburn, Virginia]] at the age of 88.&lt;ref&gt;Schudel, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vsevolod Sergeyevich Solovyov''' ({{lang-ru|Всеволод Серге́евич Соловьёв}}; {{OldStyleDate|January 1|1849|January 1}} &amp;ndash; {{OldStyleDate|November 20|1903|October 20}}) was a Russian historical [[novelist]]. His most famous work is ''Chronicle of Four Generations'' (five volumes, 1881–86), an account of the fictional Gorbatov family from the time of [[Catherine the Great]] to the mid-nineteenth century. Solovyov's "atmosphere of nostalgia for the vanished age of the nobility" helps explain his "posthumous popularity among Russian émigrés."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Ungurianu, ''Plotting History: The Russian Historical Novel in the Imperial Age'' (Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2007: {{ISBN|0-299-22500-3}}), pp. 132, 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oldest son of the historian [[Sergei Solovyov]] and brother of the [[philosopher]] [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], Vsevolod turned to writing historical fiction in 1876 with ''Princess Ostrozhskaya''. He visited [[Paris]] in 1884 where he met [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky|Blavatsky]] and mixed with other people in the Paris [[occult]] scene, such as [[Juliette Adam]], [[Vera Jelikovsky]], Blavatsky's sister, and [[Emilie de Morsier]]. By 1886 he had become a bitter and disillusioned enemy of the founder of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/bo/academic/subjects/history/history-ideas-and-intellectual-history/modern-priestess-isis "A Modern Priestess of Isis"]. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He abandoned his plans to promote theosophy in Russia and denounced Blavatsky as a failed spy of the [[Okhrana]]. At the time he was intimately involved with [[Yuliana Glinka]], who worked for [[Pyotr Rachkovsky]], Paris head of the Okhrana.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Of his later novels, the best known are ''The Magi'' (1889) and ''The Great Rosicrucian'' (1890), dealing with [[Mysticism|mystics]] of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century.

Great fires occurred during the summer of 1868 setting the woods ablaze. Goldring's re-creation comprised [[Endcliffe Park]] 38.3 acres (15.5 hectares), Bingham Park 60.54 acres (24.5 hectares), Whiteley Woods 28.42 acres (11.5 hectares), Forge Dam 23.48 acres (9.5 hectares), and Porter Clough 17.8 acres (7.2 hectares). Porter Brook are all part of the [[Sheffield Round Walk]], completed shortly after [[World War II]].
: Endcliffe Park was laid out by Goldring in 1885 when Endcliffe Wood was purchased by [[Sheffield City Council|City of Sheffield]]. Many features in naturally occurring [[gritstone|Millstone Grit]], such as stepping-stones across Porter Brook, were incorporated and in 1887 a Jubilee Monument was erected commemorating the Golden Jubilee of [[Queen Victoria|Victoria of the United Kingdom]]. In 1891 he added a tennis pavilion and lodge in the fashionable [[Art Nouveau]] style located at the park entrance, [[Hunter's Bar]]. Further extensions to Endcliffe Park were made in 1888 and 1929.

'''William Whitaker Reed''' (January 23, 1816 - August 21, 1891)  was a [[Tennessee]] native and a pioneer in the settlement of [[Bell County, Texas|Bell County]], [[Texas]].
 
==Early life==
William Whitaker Reed was born in [[Bedford County, Tennessee|Bedford County]] near [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]].

==Texas colonist==
In 1833, William Whitaker Reed traveled with his parents, Michael and Martha Reed, to [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], [[Louisiana]], the launching point in the preparation for immigration to [[Mexican Texas|colonial Texas]]. They found, however, that [[English American|Anglo]] immigration had been suspended by the government of [[Mexico]]. Furthermore, the area in which the Reeds planned to settle was in dispute between partisans of the [[empresario]]s [[Sterling C. Robertson]] and [[Stephen F. Austin]]. Nevertheless, Reed and his brother-in-law, William Crain Sparks, explored territory in what is now [[Bell County, Texas|Bell County]] south of [[Temple, Texas|Temple]], [[Texas]]. The two selected lands along the south bank of the [[Little River (Texas)|Little River]] for various family members near what is now the community of [[Salado, Texas|Salado]]. Robertson gained control of the colony in 1834 while Austin was imprisoned on false charges in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name=brochure&gt;Brochure "William Whitaker Reed House", 1850, Visitors Center, [[Salado, Texas|Salado]], [[Texas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texas Revolution==
When the [[Texas Revolution]] began in 1835, William Whitaker Reed joined the [[Texian Army]] and served under Captain L. H. Mabbett.  In April 1836, Reed, who was just 20 years of age, was among those who dug the mass grave to hold the burned and charred remains of the 344 men under [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[James Fannin]] who were massacred on orders of [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]] at [[Goliad massacre|Goliad]] west of [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref name=marker&gt;[[Texas Historical Commission]], Marker No. 11730&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt;

==Homesteading in Texas==
After the war, William Whitaker Reed returned to his homestead. In 1841, he wed the former Emeline Cobb (1825-1890), the seventh of eleven children of Stancil Cobb (1792-1851) and the former Mila Reed (1793-1864). The couple had ten children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robsgenealogy.net/cobb/p89.htm|title=William Whitaker Reed|publisher=robsgenealogy.net|accessdate=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was settled, deserted, then resettled several times by the founding pioneers. In 1850, five years after Texas statehood Reed participated in the election of a [[Commissioners' Court|commissioners' court]] to organize Bell County. That same year, he was elected the first county [[sheriff]] and served two terms.&lt;ref name=marker/&gt;
 
The house which Reed built in 1850 was restored and relocated in 2008 as the Salado Visitor's Center. The structure is made of hand-hewn oak logs cut from the bottoms of the Little River. Larger than most frontier cabins, it is designed in the [[Dogtrot house|dogtrot]] style, with two main rooms separated by an open breezeway. Fireplaces made of native [[limestone]] provided heat and cooking. The house was windowless except for small openings from which to fire a gun. It was designed for both shelter and security at a time when attacks from [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]], was a recurring threat. Through successive generations, members of the Reed family protected and preserved the 1850 homestead and made possible its current use.&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt;

==Death==
William Whitaker Reed died at the age of seventy-five a year after the passing of his wife. They are interred on Reed family land.&lt;ref name=marker/&gt;

'''Yehoshua Hankin''' ({{lang-he-n|יהושע חנקין}}, 1864 – 11 November 1945) was a [[Zionism|Zionist]] activist who was responsible for most of the major land purchases of the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist Organization]] in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Mandatory Palestine]].

==Early life==
Hankin was born in [[Kremenchuk]], [[Russian Empire]], and moved to [[Rishon LeZion]] with his parents in 1882.

==Land purchases==
In 1887 his family moved to [[Gedera]], where he became friendly with local [[Arab]]s, helping him negotiate the purchase of land. Hankin's first purchase was the land of [[Rehovot]], acquired in 1890. A year later he bought the land that later became the settlement and city of [[Hadera]]. He then purchased territories for the [[Palestine Jewish Colonization Association|Jewish Colonial Association]] in the [[Galilee]].

In 1888 Hankin married Olga Belkind (1852–1943) in [[Gedera]]. She was a woman twelve years his senior, who would become his partner in all his endeavors. Their marriage remained childless.&lt;ref&gt;http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/belkind-hankin-olga&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, when the Zionist organization sent [[Arthur Ruppin]] and set up the [[Palestine Land Development Company]], Hankin joined. In 1909 or 1910, Hankin completed his first major purchase in the [[Jezreel Valley]]. He bought some  10,000 dunams (10&amp;nbsp;km²) of land in Al-Fuleh, which became the home of [[Merhavia (moshav)|Merhavia]]. This purchase also marked the start of bitter disputes between Arabs and [[Jew]]s over the rights of tenant farmers who had been evicted, and regarding the employment of Jewish or Arab watchmen for the land.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In his article, ''Buying the Emek''{{ref|1}}, [[Arthur Ruppin]] described the vicissitudes of this purchase:

:''In order to execute this plan the [[Jaffa]] office communicated with Messrs. Kalvariski and Joshua Hankin. The latter, then a young man of twenty-five had already demonstrated his skill in such negotiations in the acquisition of land for the colonies Rehoboth and Hederah. By energetic work he succeeded, in 1891, in reaching an agreement with large owners in the Emek Jezreel and the Plain of [[Acre, Israel|Acco]] for the purchase of 160,000 dunams [160 km²] at 15 francs per dunam [15,000 franc/km²]....Before the consummation of the agreement, however the Turkish Government, alarmed by the increasing inflow of Russian Jews, prohibited Jewish immigration entirely. This blow proved disastrous for the negotiations. The Russian societies formed for the purposes of purchasing land were dissolved, failed to send in the money they had promised, and the entire magnificent project fell through...It was only in 1910 that Hankin -- who, in the meanwhile, had purchased land in Lower Galilee for the ICA -- resumed his negotiations for land in the Emek.''

Because of the reluctance of Zionist organizations to pay for land, Hankin frequently agreed to purchase lands and then convinced the Jewish agency or others to finance the "done deal." As Ruppin notes:

:''Authorized by a Russian Jew, Elias Blumenfeld, to arrange for the purchase of 1,000 dunams [1 km²] on which he, Blumenfeld, intended to establish a farm with his own means, Hankin concluded an agreement for a stretch of 9,500 dunams [9.5 km²] in Fule, later Merchavia [Al-Ful in Arabic]. He hoped that the ICA, in whose employ he was at that time, would buy the remainder of the land. When, however, the ICA refused to do so, he inquired of me, who was then the director of the [[Palestine Bureau]] of the Zionist Organization, whether the Zionists would be prepared to purchase this land. Even before that it had occurred to me, whenever, going from [[Haifa]] to [[Nazareth]], I had viewed the broad expanse of the [[Jezreel Valley|Emek Yizrael]], that, because of its proximity to Haifa, its excellent railroad and highway connections, and the ease with which its soil could be cultivated, this land would be preeminently suited for Jewish colonization.''

:''But it was no simple matter to obtain the money for this purchase. Only the fact that [[Franz Oppenheimer]] was just then seeking land for the co-operative colonization society he had recently organized, and the simultaneous appearance of some private purchasers, made it possible to carry through this project. 3,500 dunams [3.5 km²] were taken over by the National Fund for the co-operative colonies, and the rest by the Palestine Land Development Company.''

During [[World War I]], Hankin was exiled by the Turks to [[Anatolia]]. Returning to Palestine, he soon resumed his work where he had left off. In 1920, he concluded a deal with the [[Sursock family|Sursuk family]] of [[Beirut]] for purchase of 60,000 dunams (60&amp;nbsp;km²) of land in the Jezreel Valley. He negotiated for this land when he had in fact not a penny to finance the purchase. The chairman of the [[Jewish National Fund]], Nehemiah De Lieme, refused to pay for the land, arguing that it was beyond the budget of the Fund, but he was overruled by the Zionist organization and in particular [[Chaim Weizmann]]. This tract became home to numerous new [[kibbutz]]im and other settlements, including [[Nahalal]], [[Ginegar]], [[Kfar Yehezkel]], [[Geva]], [[Ein Harod]], [[Tel Yosef]] and [[Beit Alfa]]. Half of this land was unirrigated and considered of low value, but the remainder contained about 500 Arab tenant farmers. These latter, though reimbursed above and beyond the requirements of the law, continued to complain of dispossession.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Subsequently, Hankin was involved in large scale purchases of land in and around Acco. In 1927, Hankin proposed an ambitious 20 year land purchase plan to the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]], a plan that was never carried out in full. In 1932 he became head of the Palestine Land Development Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From New Zion to Old Zion: American Jewish Immigration and Settlement in Palestine, 1917-1939|last=Glass|first=Joseph B.|page=150|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hankin understood the necessity to plan for Arab as well as Jewish settlement, and apparently intended to do so. In July 1930 he wrote:

:''...Had we desired to disregard the interests of such workers of the land as are dependent, directly or indirectly, upon lands of the landlords, we could have acquired large and unlimited areas, but in the course of our conversation I have pointed out to you that this has not been our policy and that, when acquiring lands, it is our ardent wish not to prejudice or do harm to the interests of anybody. (Quoted by Sir John Hope Simpson in his report{{ref|2}} of 1930 ).''

==Death==
Hankin died in [[Tel Aviv]] and was buried in the [[Galilee]] next to his wife Olga, at the house ("Bet Hankin") he had built for themselves at [[Well of Harod|Ein Harod]] on [[Mount Gilboa]].
