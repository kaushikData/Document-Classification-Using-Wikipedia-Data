The '''1930 FIFA World Cup''' was the inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]], the world championship for [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national]] [[association football]] teams. It took place in Uruguay from 13 to 30 July 1930. [[FIFA]], football's international [[Sport governing body|governing body]], selected Uruguay as host nation, as the country would be celebrating the centenary of its [[Constitution of Uruguay|first constitution]], and the [[Uruguay national football team]] had successfully retained their football title at the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Summer Olympics]]. All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, [[Montevideo]], the majority at the [[Estadio Centenario]], which was built for the tournament.

Thirteen teams (seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America) entered the tournament. Only a few European teams chose to participate because of the difficulty of travelling to South America. The teams were divided into four groups, with the winner of each group progressing to the semi-finals. The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by [[France national football team|France]] and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], who defeated [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 4–1 and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] 3–0, respectively. [[Lucien Laurent]] of France scored the first goal in World Cup history, while US goalkeeper [[Jimmy Douglas (American soccer)|Jimmy Douglas]] posted the first official "[[clean sheet]]" in the tournament.

[[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], Uruguay, the United States and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] each won their respective groups to qualify for the semi-finals. In the final, hosts and pre-tournament favourites Uruguay defeated Argentina 4–2 in front of a crowd of 68,346&amp;nbsp;people, and became the first nation to win the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].

The first World Cup was the only one without [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification]]. Every country affiliated with FIFA was invited to compete, and given a deadline of 28 February 1930 to accept. Plenty of interest was shown by nations in the Americas; [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]], [[Chile national football team|Chile]], [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]], [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] all entered. A total of seven South American teams participated, more than in any subsequent World Cup Finals. However, because of the long and costly trip by ship across the Atlantic Ocean, and the length of absence required for players,&lt;ref name="FIFAhistory"/&gt; very few European teams were inclined to take part. Some refused to countenance travel to South America in any circumstances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Chris |title=World Cup Stories: The History of the FIFA World Cup |publisher=Interact |year=2006 |location=Ware |isbn=978-0-9549819-2-1 |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and no European entries were received before the February deadline. In an attempt to gain some European participation, the Uruguayan Football Association sent a letter of invitation to [[The Football Association]], even though the British [[Home Nations]] (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) had resigned from FIFA at the time. This was rejected by the FA Committee on 18 November 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.premiumtv.co.uk/page/BigRead/0,,11442~1034860,00.html |title=Uruguay 1930 |work=Fourfourtwo magazine |accessdate=20 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819173027/http://www.fourfourtwo.premiumtv.co.uk/page/BigRead/0%2C%2C11442~1034860%2C00.html |archivedate=19 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months before the start of the tournament, no team from Europe had officially entered.&lt;ref name=FIFA1930&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/pwc/1930.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426212450/http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/pwc/1930.html |archivedate=26 April 2006 |title=FIFA World Cup&amp;nbsp;– Classic Moments from FIFA World Cup History |work=FIFA |accessdate=14 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
FIFA president [[Jules Rimet]] intervened, and eventually four European teams made the trip by sea: [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], [[France national football team|France]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]], and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]. The Romanians, managed by [[Constantin Rădulescu (footballer, born 1896)|Constantin Rădulescu]] and coached by their captain [[Rudolf Wetzer]] and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following the intervention of newly crowned [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol&amp;nbsp;II]]. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers to ensure that the players would still have jobs upon their return.&lt;ref&gt;Seddon, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender [[Manuel Anatol]] nor the team's regular coach [[Gaston Barreau]] could be persuaded to make the trip.&lt;ref name="goldblatt_248"&gt;Goldblatt (2008), p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgians participated at the instigation of German-Belgian FIFA vice-president [[Rodolphe Seeldrayers]].&lt;ref name=g249&gt;Goldblatt (2008), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian]] team were picked up when the boat docked in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 29 June before arriving in Uruguay on 4 July.&lt;ref name=FIFA1930/&gt; Yugoslavia travelled via the mail steamship ''Florida'' from [[Marseille]].&lt;ref name="Marca"/&gt;

In the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] there were doubts about their participation at first. Since the Croatians decided to boycott the national team, King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]] did not want to finance the whole idea, but in the end they found a solution. [[Belgrade]] football association officials decided to round up only domestic ([[Serbian people|Serbian]]) star players, mainly from two rival Belgrade clubs, [[OFK Beograd|BSK]] and [[SK Jugoslavija]], with an additional three Serbs who played for French clubs ([[Ivan Bek]] among them). 
Therefore, the Yugoslavia team was exclusively made up of Serbian players; and with the two biggest stars of the team, [[Blagoje Marjanović]] ("Moša") and [[Aleksandar Tirnanić]] ("Tirke"), both from BSK, they were ready for a trip to South America to represent Yugoslavia in the World Cup. The Yugoslavians were the youngest team in the World Cup; with an average age of 21 years and 258 days. After their first match, against Brazil, they received a new nickname "The Ich-es" or "Ichachos" (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) by the Uruguayan press; referring to most of the player's surnames that ended up with the "-ić" or "-vić" suffix, which is quite common for Serbian last names. They achieved the joint–biggest success in both [[Football Association of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] and [[Football Association of Serbia|Serbian]] subsequent World Cup footballing history, by earning fourth place, a result that would be repeated in [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mencompwc/51/97/55/171012-statisticalkit-fifaworldcup-milestonesfactsfigures-statusafterfwc2010.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521092116/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mencompwc/51/97/55/171012-statisticalkit-fifaworldcup-milestonesfactsfigures-statusafterfwc2010.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2013 |publisher=[[FIFA]] |title=FIFA World Cup: Milestones, facts &amp; figures.

==Venues==
{{main|FIFA World Cup hosts}}
Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, Hungary and Uruguay all lodged applications to host the event.&lt;ref name="FIFAhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/first-fifa-world-cup.html |title=History of FIFA&amp;nbsp;– The first FIFA World Cup |work=FIFA |accessdate=14 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1930"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1632000/1632201.stm |title=World Cup History&amp;nbsp;– Uruguay 1930 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=11 April 2002 |accessdate=14 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Uruguay's bid became the clear selection after all the other countries withdrew their bids.

All matches took place in [[Montevideo]]. Three stadiums were used: [[Estadio Centenario]], [[Estadio Pocitos]], and [[Estadio Gran Parque Central|Estadio Parque Central]]. The Estadio Centenario was built both for the tournament and as a celebration of the centenary of Uruguayan independence. Designed by Juan Scasso,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldblatt |first=David |title=The Ball is Round: A Global History of Football |publisher=Penguin |location=London |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-101582-8 |page=248 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was the primary stadium for the tournament, referred to by Rimet as a "temple of football".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunning |first1=Eric |last2=Malcolm |first2=Dominic |title=Sport |page=46 |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-415-26292-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a capacity of 90,000, it was the largest football stadium outside the British Isles.&lt;ref name=g249/&gt; The stadium hosted 10 of the 18&amp;nbsp;matches, including both semi-finals and the final. However, a rushed construction schedule and delays caused by the rainy season meant the Centenario was not ready for use until five days into the tournament.&lt;ref name="G16"&gt;Glanville, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Early matches were played at smaller stadiums usually used by Montevideo football clubs [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]] and [[Peñarol]], the 20,000 capacity Parque Central and the Pocitos.

==Match officials==
Fifteen referees participated in the tournament: four Europeans – two Belgians ([[Henri Christophe (referee)|Henri Christophe]] and [[John Langenus]]), a Frenchman, and a Romanian ([[Constantin Rădulescu (footballer, born 1896)|Constantin Rădulescu]], also the Romanian team coach),&lt;ref name="FIFA-coaches-refs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://es.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mencompwc/01/17/75/48/s25factsyouneedtoknowaboutthefifaworldcup_10-00556_104_en_es.pdf |title=25 datos sobre la Copa Mundial de la FIFA |format=PDF |accessdate=20 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eleven from the Americas – among them six Uruguayans. In order to eliminate differences in the application of the Laws of the Game, the referees were invited to one short meeting to iron out the most conflicting issues arising from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elfutbolmundial.com.ar/uruguay30.html |title=I Campeonato "Uruguay 1930" |accessdate=20 August 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123060848/http://www.elfutbolmundial.com.ar/uruguay30.html |archivedate=23 November 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the refereeing appointments, the two that attracted most attention were that of [[Gilberto de Almeida Rêgo]] in the match between Argentina and France, in which the Brazilian referee blew for full-time six minutes early, and that of the Bolivian [[Ulises Saucedo]]'s in the Argentina and Mexico encounter, which Argentina won 6–3. During the game Saucedo, who was also the coach of Bolivia,&lt;ref name="FIFA-coaches-refs"/&gt; awarded three penalties.

==Format and draw==
The 13 teams were drawn into four groups, with Group 1 containing four teams, and the others containing  three. Each group played a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format, with the four group winners progressing to the knockout semi-final stage.

Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, and the United States were [[Seed (tennis)|seeded]], and were kept apart in the draw,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanville |first=Brian |title=The Story of the World Cup |page=17 |publisher=Faber |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-571-22944-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which took place in Montevideo once all the teams arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-201_10e_fwcdraw-history_8842.pdf |title=History of the World Cup draw |work=FIFA |accessdate=14 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there were no qualifying games, the opening two matches of the tournament were the first World Cup games ever played, taking place simultaneously on 13 July 1930; France beat Mexico 4–1 at the [[Estadio Pocitos]], while the United States defeated Belgium 3–0 at the same time at the [[Estadio Gran Parque Central]]. France's [[Lucien Laurent]] was the scorer of the first World Cup goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lucien Laurent: The World Cup's First Goal Scorer |work=CBC Sports |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/the-world-cup-s-1st-goal-scorer-1.825335 |accessdate=14 June 2014 |last=Molinaro |first=John F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tournament summary==

===Group 1===
{{Quote box |width=26% |align=right |quote=We were playing Mexico and it was snowing, since it was winter in the southern hemisphere. One of my team mates centred the ball and I followed its path carefully, taking it on the volley with my right foot. Everyone was pleased but we didn't all roll around on the ground&amp;nbsp;– nobody realised that history was being made. A quick handshake and we got on with the game. And no bonus either; we were all amateurs in those days, right to the end.|source=&lt;small&gt;'''[[Lucien Laurent]]'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="fifa-franchecomte"/&gt;}}
The first group was the only one to contain four teams: Argentina, Chile, France and Mexico. Two days after France's victory over Mexico, they faced group favourites Argentina. Injuries hindered France; goalkeeper [[Alex Thépot]] had to leave the field after 20&amp;nbsp;minutes, and Laurent, after a fierce tackle by [[Luis Monti]], spent most of the match limping. However, they held out for most of the match, only succumbing to an 81st-minute goal scored from a Monti [[direct free kick|free kick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freddi |first=Cris |title=Complete Book of the World Cup 2006 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=2006 |isbn=0-00-722916-X |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game featured an officiating controversy when referee [[Gilberto de Almeida Rêgo|Almeida Rêgo]] erroneously blew the final whistle six minutes early, with Frenchman [[Marcel Langiller]] clear on goal; play only resumed after protests from the French players.&lt;ref name="Glanville18"&gt;Glanville, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Although France had played twice in 48 hours, Chile had yet to play their first match. They faced Mexico the following day, gaining a comfortable 3–0 win.&lt;ref name="Crouch6"&gt;Crouch, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

France's final match, against Chile, featured the first [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] of the World Cup . The first goalkeeper to save a penalty was Alex Thépot of France on 19 July 1930, saving from Chile's [[Carlos Vidal]] in the 30th minute of the match.&lt;ref name="virginmedia1"&gt;[http://www.fifaworldcup.webspace.virginmedia.com/1930_fifaworldcup.htm Millingstein's History of World Cup] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222012747/http://www.fifaworldcup.webspace.virginmedia.com/1930_fifaworldcup.htm |date=22 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina's second match, against Mexico, three [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]s were awarded. During the same match on 19 July 1930 Mexico's Oscar Bonfiglio Martínez saved another penalty at the 23rd minute of the match against Argentina's Fernando Paternoster.&lt;ref name="virginmedia1"/&gt; [[Guillermo Stábile]] scored a [[hat-trick]] in his international debut&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1930 Golden Boot&amp;nbsp;– Guillermo Stabile |work=Sky Sports |url=http://home.skysports.com/worldcup/historyarticle.aspx?hlid=373666 |accessdate=20 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829040743/http://home.skysports.com/worldcup/historyarticle.aspx?hlid=373666 |archivedate=29 August 2006 }} (archive.org mirror)&lt;/ref&gt; as Argentina won 6–3, despite the absence of their captain [[Manuel Ferreira (footballer)|Manuel Ferreira]], who had returned to Buenos Aires to take a law exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seddon |first=Peter |title=The World Cup's Strangest Moments |publisher=Robson |location=London |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-86105-869-0 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualification was decided by the group's final match, contested by Argentina and Chile, who had beaten France and Mexico, respectively. The game was marred by a brawl sparked by a foul on Arturo Torres by Monti.&lt;ref name="Glanville18"/&gt; Argentina won 3–1 against their neighbours and advanced to the semi-finals.

===Group 2===
The second group contained Brazil, Bolivia and Yugoslavia. Brazil, the group seeds, were expected to progress, but in the group's opening match, unexpectedly lost 2–1 to Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="Glanville19"&gt;Glanville, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Going into the tournament Bolivia had never previously won an international match. For their opener they paid tribute to the hosts by wearing shirts each emblazoned with a single letter, spelling "Viva Uruguay" as the team lined up.&lt;ref name="f5"/&gt; Both of Bolivia's matches followed a similar pattern, a promising start gradually transforming into heavy defeat. Against Yugoslavia, they held out for an hour before conceding, but were four goals down by the final whistle.&lt;ref name="Crouch6"/&gt; Misfortune played its part; several Bolivian goals were disallowed.&lt;ref name="f5"&gt;Freddi, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Against Brazil, when both teams had only pride to play for, the score was 1–0 to Brazil at half-time. Brazil added three more in the second half, two of them scored by the multi-sportsman [[Preguinho]].&lt;ref&gt;Freddi, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--There was considerable confusion during the match when, for 45&amp;nbsp;minutes, the teams were attired in the same colours. [[Ulises Saucedo]]'s Bolivia side finally changed into an alternate [[kit (association football)|kit]] at half-time. --&gt; Yugoslavia qualified for the semi-finals.

===Group 3===
Hosts Uruguay were in a group with Peru and Romania. The opening match in this group saw the first player expulsion in the competition, when Plácido Galindo of Peru was [[sent off|dismissed]] against Romania. The Romanians made their man advantage pay; their 3–1 win included two late goals. This match had the smallest crowd of any in World Cup history. The official attendance was 2,459, but the actual figure is generally accepted to be around 300.&lt;ref&gt;Freddi, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of construction delays at Estadio Centenario, Uruguay's first match was not played until five days into the tournament. The first to be held at the Centenario, it was preceded by a ceremony in honour of the Uruguayan centenary celebrations. The Uruguayan team spent the four weeks preceding the match in a training camp, at which strict discipline was exercised. Goalkeeper [[Andrés Mazali]] was dropped from the squad for breaking a curfew to visit his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Freddi, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred years to the day of the creation of Uruguay's first constitution, the hosts won a tight match against Peru 1–0.&lt;ref name="Almeida, p. 125"&gt;Almeida, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Spectators praised Peru's defense, and this turned out to be the only tournament match in which Uruguay scored only one goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jaime |last=Pulgar-Vidal Otálora |title=Peru en El Mundial del 30 |publisher=Jaimepulgarvidal.blogspot.com |url=http://jaimepulgarvidal.blogspot.com/2007/02/peru-en-el-mundial-del-30.html |date=24 February 2007 |accessdate=21 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HkG7EIve?url=http://jaimepulgarvidal.blogspot.com/2007/02/peru-en-el-mundial-del-30.html |archivedate=29 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was viewed as a poor performance by the Uruguayan press, but lauded in Peru.&lt;ref name="Almeida, p. 125"/&gt; Uruguay subsequently defeated Romania with ease, scoring four first half goals to win 4–0.

===Group 4===
The fourth group contained Belgium, Paraguay and The United States. The American team, which contained a significant number of new [[cap (sport)|caps]], were reputedly nicknamed "the shot-putters" by an unnamed source in the French contingent.&lt;ref name="BBC1930"/&gt; They beat their first opponents, Belgium, 3–0. The ease of the victory was unexpected; Uruguayan newspaper ''Imparcial'' wrote that "the large score of the American victory has really surprised the experts".&lt;ref name="Almeida"&gt;{{cite book |last=Almeida |first=Rony J. |title=Where It All Began |page=91 |publisher=Lulu |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4116-7906-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgian reports bemoaned the state of the [[association football pitch|pitch]] and refereeing decisions, claiming that the second goal was [[Offside (association football)|offside]].&lt;ref name="Almeida"/&gt; The group's second match, played in windy conditions,&lt;ref&gt;Freddi, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; witnessed the first tournament [[hat-trick]], scored by [[Bert Patenaude]] of the United States against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]]. Until 10 November 2006, the first hat-trick that FIFA acknowledged had been scored by [[Guillermo Stábile]] of [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], two days after Patenaude; however, in 2006 FIFA announced that Patenaude's claim to being the first hat-trick scorer was valid, as a goal previously assigned to teammate [[Tom Florie]] was reattributed to Patenaude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/107/499/ |title=American Bert Patenaude credited with first hat trick in FIFA World Cup history |work=FIFA |accessdate=14 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/30f-hattrick.html |title=The first World Cup hat trick |work=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] (RSSSF) |accessdate=3 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104223953/http://www.rsssf.com/tables/30f-hattrick.html |archivedate=4 November 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the United States having secured qualification, the final match in the group was a [[dead rubber]]. Paraguay beat Belgium by a 1–0 margin.&lt;ref name="Crouch6"/&gt;

===Semi-finals===
The four group winners, [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], Yugoslavia, [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and the United States, moved to the semi-finals. The two semi-final matches saw identical scores. The first semi-final was played between the US and Argentina on a rain-drenched pitch. The United States team, which featured six British-born players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after ten minutes to a broken leg as the match became violent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A history of the World Cup: 1930–2006 |first=Clemente Angelo |last=Lisi |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2007 |ISBN=0-8108-5905-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yX3l3vrNZSwC |pages=16–17 |accessdate=26 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1–0 half-time lead. In the second half, the strength of the United States team was overwhelmed by the pace of the Argentinian attacks, the match finishing 6–1 to Argentina.&lt;ref name="Crouch11"/&gt;

In the second semi-final there were shades of the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] match between Yugoslavia and Uruguay. Here, though, Yugoslavia took a surprise lead through [[Đorđe Vujadinović|Vujadinović]]. Uruguay then took a 2–1 lead. Then shortly before half-time Yugoslavia had a goal disallowed by a controversial offside decision.&lt;ref name="Glanville19"/&gt; The hosts scored three more in the second half to win 6–1, [[Pedro Cea]] completing a hat-trick.&lt;ref name="Crouch11"/&gt;

===Third and fourth place===
The now-traditional [[third place play-off]] was not established until [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]], so the format of the 1930 World Cup is unique in not distinguishing between the third and fourth placed teams. Occasional sources, notably a FIFA Bulletin from 1984, incorrectly imply that a third-place match occurred and was won 3–1 by Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/30full.html |title=World Cup 1930 finals |work=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] (RSSSF) |accessdate=14 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602224814/http://www.rsssf.com/tables/30full.html |archivedate=2 June 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts differ as to whether a third-place match was originally scheduled. According to a 2009 book by Hyder Jawad, Yugoslavia refused to play a third-place match because they were upset with the refereeing in their semi-final against Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;Jawad, Hyder (2009); ''Four Weeks In Montevideo: The Story of World Cup 1930'', (Seventeen Media &amp; Publishing), p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the championship, the captains of the United States team ([[Tom Florie]])&lt;ref name="Florie medal"&gt;Florie medal – [https://books.google.com/books?id=h13PPDl1Le4C&amp;q=medal+florie#v=snippet&amp;q=medal%20florie&amp;f=false Where the Legend Began]&lt;/ref&gt; and Yugoslavia ([[Milutin Ivković]])&lt;ref name="Moša medal"&gt;Marjanović medal – [http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Magazin/Sacuvana-medalja-Mose-Marjanovica.lt.html Sačuvana medalja Moše Marjanovića] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017013954/http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Magazin/Sacuvana-medalja-Mose-Marjanovica.lt.html |date=17 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both received bronze medals. Yet a FIFA technical committee report on the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] included full retrospective rankings of all teams at all previous World Cup finals; this report ranked the United States third and Yugoslavia fourth, due to a better goal difference on otherwise identical records,&lt;ref name="F279"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Permanent Table |chapterurl=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/technicaldevp/50/09/00/fwc%5fmexico%5f1986%5fen%5fpart4%5f279.pdf#page=45 |title=FIFA World Cup México '86&amp;nbsp;– Technical Report |year=1986 |page=230 |accessdate=11 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a practice since continued by FIFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/worldcup/uruguay1930/awards/index.html |title=Final Tournament Standings |publisher=FIFA |work=1930 FIFA World Cup Uruguay |accessdate=14 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the son of Kosta Hadži, the chief of Yugoslav delegation at the 1930 World Cup and the vice-president of the [[Football Association of Yugoslavia]] at the time, claimed that Yugoslavia, as a team, has been awarded one bronze medal, which has been kept by Hadži himself and his family for the following 80 years. According to this source, Yugoslavia was placed third because of the semi-finals loss to the eventual champions, Uruguay.&lt;ref name="Bronze medal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Sport/sportske-price/Medalja-iz-doma-Hadzijevih-svedochi-da-smo-bili-treci-na-Mundijalu.sr.html |script-title=sr:Медаља из дома Хаџијевих сведочи да смо били трећи на Мундијалу |publisher=[[Politika]] |accessdate=1 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503051629/http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Sport/sportske-price/Medalja-iz-doma-Hadzijevih-svedochi-da-smo-bili-treci-na-Mundijalu.sr.html |archivedate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |language=Serbian |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bronze medal2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Reportaza/194796/Jos-uvek-sjaji-bronza-iz-Montevidea |language=Serbian |title=Još uvek sjaji bronza iz Montevidea |publisher=[[Blic]] |accessdate=25 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623154744/http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Reportaza/194796/Jos-uvek-sjaji-bronza-iz-Montevidea |archivedate=23 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resounding wins for Uruguay and Argentina in the semi-finals meant the final was a repeat of the matchup in the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics#Gold medal match|1928 Olympic final]], which Uruguay had won 2–1 after a replay.

The final was played at the [[Estadio Centenario]] on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the [[La Plata Basin]] as the Argentine supporters crossed the river with the war cry ''Victoria o muerte'' ("victory or death"), dispelling any uncertainty as to whether the tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate,&lt;ref name="Glanville19"/&gt; and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10–15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before [[kick-off (association football)|kick-off]], let alone reach the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;Goldblatt, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Freddi, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The gates were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full,&lt;ref name="Glanville19"/&gt; the official attendance 93,000.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-201_02e_fwc-origin_8816.pdf |title=FIFA World Cup Origin |website=FIFA |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615195236/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-201_02e_fwc-origin_8816.pdf |archive-date=15 June 2010 |dead-url=yes |access-date=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second.&lt;ref name="BBC1930"/&gt; Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness.&lt;ref name="Crouch11"&gt;Crouch, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats on the eve of the match. The referee was Belgian [[John Langenus]], who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety.&lt;ref name="Glanville20"&gt;Glanville, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.&lt;ref&gt;Goldblatt, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

The hosts scored the opening goal through [[Pablo Dorado]], a low shot from a position on the right.&lt;ref name="Freddi12"&gt;Freddi, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina, displaying superior passing ability, responded strongly. Within eight minutes they were back on level terms; [[Carlos Peucelle]] received a Ferreira through-ball, beat his [[marking (association football)|marker]] and equalised.&lt;ref name="Freddi12"/&gt; Shortly before half-time leading tournament goalscorer Guillermo Stábile gave Argentina a 2–1 lead. Uruguay captain Nasazzi protested, maintaining that Stábile was offside, but to no avail.&lt;ref name="Glanville20"/&gt; In the second half Uruguay gradually became ascendant. Shortly after Monti missed a chance to make the score 3–1, Uruguay attacked in numbers, and [[Pedro Cea]] scored an equaliser.&lt;ref name="Freddi12"/&gt; Ten minutes later a goal by [[Santos Iriarte]] gave Uruguay the lead, and just before full-time Castro made it 4–2 to seal the win.&lt;ref name="Glanville20"/&gt; Langenus ended the match a minute later, and Uruguay thus added the title World Cup winners to their mantle of Olympic champions. Jules Rimet presented the [[Jules Rimet Trophy|World Cup Trophy]], which was later named for him, to the head of the Uruguayan Football Association, [[Raúl Jude]].&lt;ref name="Freddi13"&gt;Freddi, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day was declared a national holiday in Uruguay;&lt;ref name="origin"/&gt; in the Argentinian capital, [[Buenos Aires]], a mob threw stones at the Uruguayan consulate.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco Varallo]] (who played as a forward for Argentina) was the last player of the final to die, on 30 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ole.com.ar/boca-juniors/gol-luto_0_326367514.html |title=El gol está de luto |newspaper=[[Olé (sports newspaper)|Olé]] |language=Spanish |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

France, Yugoslavia and the United States all played [[friendly match|friendlies]] in South America following the competition. Brazil played France on 1 August, Yugoslavia on 10 August and the United States on 17 August,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paginas.terra.com.br/esporte/rsssfbrasil/sel/brazil192332.htm |title=Seleção Brasileira (Brazilian National Team) 1923–1932 |work=RSSSF Brazil |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814114450/http://paginas.terra.com.br/esporte/rsssfbrasil/sel/brazil192332.htm |archivedate=14 August 2007 |accessdate=20 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Argentina hosted Yugoslavia on 3 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rsssf.com/tablesa/arg-intres.html#matches |title=Argentina national Team archive |work=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] |accessdate=14 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603163633/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/arg-intres.html |archivedate=3 June 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uruguay's aggregate goal difference of +12 over four games, at an average of +3 per match, remains the highest average goal difference per match of any World Cup champion, and the second highest of any World Cup Finals participant, after Hungary in [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]].

The '''2nd All-Africa Games – Lagos 1973''' were played from January 7, 1973, to January 18, 1973, in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]].

After the success of the first African Games, the organizing bodies awarded the second games to [[Bamako]], [[Mali]] to be held in 1969. A military coup disrupted the plans and the organizers moved the games to [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]] to be held in 1971. The games were postponed once again and finally opened in January 1973. A torch was lit in [[Brazzaville]] a week before the games and transported to [[Lagos]] as a symbol of the continuity of the games.

Security again was very tight at the games. This time in response to the massacre of Israeli athletes at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich Olympic Games]] just four short months before.

Sports heroes from around the world including [[Abebe Bikila]], [[Pelé]], [[Muhammad Ali]], and [[Jesse Owens]] were invited to attend the opening ceremonies.

[[Ben Jipcho]], [[Kenya]]'s 3000 meter silver medalist at the Munich Olympics, tied the world record in the steeplechase with a run of 8:20.8. [[Tanzania]]'s newcomer [[Filbert Bayi]] stunned the veteran favorite [[Kip Keino]] in the 1500 meters in 3:37.18.

African nations continued to put pressure on [[South Africa]] which was not invited to participate due to their apartheid policies. [[Rhodesia]] was also not invited.

At the closing ceremonies the torch was passed to [[Algiers]], Algeria to begin preparations for the IIIrd [[All-Africa Games]] in 1978.

The '''2015 China Victory Day parade''' was a [[military parade]] held along [[Changan Avenue]], [[Beijing]], on 3 September 2015 to celebrate the 70th anniversary of [[Victory over Japan Day]] of [[World War II]]. The commemoration was the first high-profile military parade held to celebrate an occasion other than the [[National Day of the People's Republic of China]]. 12,000 troops of the People's Liberation Army participated in the parade, in addition to over 1,000 troops from 17 different countries, also about 850,000 "Citizen Guards" were mobilised to guard the city. [[Xi Jinping]] inspected the troops. Premier [[Li Keqiang]] was the [[master of ceremonies]] and [[Song Puxuan]] was the chief commander of the parade.

{{see also|Second Sino-Japanese War}}
The 70th Anniversary of V-day parade marked the first time that China held a military parade other than the National Day, and the first to celebrate the end of World War II.&lt;ref name=20150821guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/21/chinese-second-world-war-parade-xi-jinping|title='Old-school tub-thumping': 12,000 Chinese troops prepare for WW2 parade|author=Tom Phillips|work=The Guardian|date=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, China held parades primarily on October 1, the country's national day. The most prominent renditions of the parade were held in 1959, 1984, 1999, and [[60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China|2009]], presided over respectively by then leaders Mao Zedong, [[Deng Xiaoping]], [[Jiang Zemin]], and [[Hu Jintao]]. The 70th anniversary parade was also the first major parade since [[Xi Jinping]] took power as the [[President of the People's Republic of China]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] . The prevailing theme was to be "peace and victory".&lt;ref name=20150821guardian/&gt; Xi Jinping had attended the [[2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade]] in May as the guest-of-honour of Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]], and Putin returned the favour at this parade.&lt;ref name=20150703reuters&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/03/us-china-eu-japan-idUSKCN0PD0U520150703|title=European Union leaders unlikely to attend China's World War Two parade, envoy says}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preparations and restrictions ==
National leadership placed considerable importance on being able to put the best foot forward and do away with distractions. Bloomberg reported that the central government once again intervened in the stock market to ensure stability ahead of the anniversary; there were traffic curfews and closures of public facilities including seven parks and some hospitals.&lt;ref name=20150901bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-01/xi-s-big-military-parade-sets-china-s-spin-machine-in-overdrive|title=Chinese Military Parade Sets Spin Machine into Overdrive|date=1 September 2015|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Line 1, Beijing Subway]], which passes underneath Changan Avenue, was shut down; 256 bus-lines in Beijing were placed under tight transport restrictions from September 2–4.&lt;ref name=20150901bloomberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.163.com/15/0902/11/B2GNHRHV00014JB6.html|title=北京256条公交线路9月2日至4日采取临时运营措施|language=zh|publisher=人民网（北京）}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of the parade, hospitals restricted most of their activities beyond emergencies, the stock markets were closed.&lt;ref name=20150901bloomberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.163.com/15/0831/01/B2AGCJ1500014AED.html|title=北京阅兵当日协和等医院停门诊 急诊24小时开诊|language=zh|publisher=京华时报(北京)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20150902forbes/&gt; Areas in the city centre were placed under martial law, and 850,000 "citizen guards" were deployed to ensure security within the city.&lt;ref name=20150821guardian/&gt; The city authorities sent in trained macaques and falcons to make sure the skies over central Beijing were free of birds that would [[bird strike|put the flypast at risk]].

== Leaders in attendance ==

===Chinese leaders===
[[Xi Jinping]], who holds the posts for the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]], [[President of the People's Republic of China]], and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], was the central figure of the day's events.

General [[Song Puxuan]], Commander of the [[Northern Theater Command]], greeted Xi in front of Tiananmen at the start of the parade during the inspection segment, declaring the readiness of the troops for the marchpast.

Atop [[Tiananmen]], Xi Jinping wore a [[Mao suit]], as was customary for leaders inspecting troops at military parades; his wife ( there is no 'first lady' in China ) [[Peng Liyuan]] wore a red dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.163.com/15/0903/09/B2J1KLTB0001124J.html|title=习近平着中山装 彭丽媛着红裙亮相}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining political figures wore business suits. Xi delivered the keynote address at the parade with a surprise announcement of a plan to cut 300,000 personnel from the Chinese military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.163.com/api/15/0903/10/B2J49NTL0001124J.html|title=习近平宣布裁军30万|language=zh|publisher=中国网(北京)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other members of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]], [[Zhang Dejiang]], [[Yu Zhengsheng]], [[Liu Yunshan]], [[Wang Qishan]], and [[Zhang Gaoli]], watched the parade on top of Tiananmen Gate.

== Criticisms ==
Taiwan's [[Mainland Affairs Council]], President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] and his [[Kuomintang]] objected to the event and what they see as the Communist Party usurping credit for leading the Chinese defence against Japan during World War II.&lt;ref name=20150905chinatimes&gt;http://www.chinapost.com.tw/editorial/taiwan-issues/2015/09/05/445029/Lien-Chan.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20150828straits&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wwii-parade-beijing-reaches-out-to-kmt-veterans|title=WWII parade: Beijing reaches out to KMT veterans|date=28 August 2015|work=The Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, former Chairman of the Kuomintang [[Lien Chan]] also attended the parade, ostensibly in his personal capacity, sparking controversy at home.&lt;ref name=20150905chinatimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=20150828straits/&gt; Whilst [[Tsai Ing-wen]], leader of the Taiwanese opposition, criticised Lian for failing to represent the views of the majority of Taiwanese, observers noted that Lien had considerable business interests on the mainland he sought to protect, likewise the Kuomintang also had interests on the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storm.mg/article/63953 連戰參加中國閱兵 蔡英文：和台灣人民的觀感背道而馳]，风传媒.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setn.com/News.aspx?PageGroupID=6&amp;NewsID=92974 連戰閱兵是煙霧彈？名嘴爆：是為了國民黨在中國的黨營事業]，三立新闻网.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setn.com/News.aspx?NewsID=92914&amp;PageGroupID=6 天塌下來都要去！連戰不怕罵 赴陸閱兵為保家族企業？]，三立新闻网.&lt;/ref&gt; Hong Kong commentator Frank Ching added that Lien Chan's presence at the ceremony undermined the KMT, as China appeared to erase the role of the Nationalists in defending China.&lt;ref name=20150908ejinsight&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20150908-how-china-tried-to-rewrite-history-with-military-parade/|title=How China tried to rewrite history with military parade|work=EJ Insight|date=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other pundits said that the main object of the parade was to rewrite history and elevate the Communist Party's position in ending the war.&lt;ref name=20150902forbes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2015/09/02/mainland-hong-kong-stock-markets-shut-for-v-day-holiday/|title=Mainland, Hong Kong Stock Markets Shut For V-Day Holiday|author=Russell Flannery|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20150904harbourtimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harbourtimes.com/2015/09/04/hks-wartime-past-still-matters-alternate-histories/|title=HK's Wartime past still matters: Alternate histories - Hong Kong - Politics, Policy, Government &amp; Diplomacy|work=Harbour Times|date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20150908ejinsight/&gt;

[[Kyodo News Agency]] cited a US department of State spokesman that United States objected the President of Sudan Bashir to attend the parade in the news conference held on August 31, 2015. He stated that China should consider about the international society's worry as a UN security council member with inviting or assisting someone who is wanted under the document of warrant signed by ICC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=美国国务院竟反对中国邀请苏丹总统出席抗战阅兵|url=http://www.guancha.cn/america/2015_09_01_332634_s.shtml|website=观察者}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Veterans ===
Surviving soldiers from the Second World War joined the parade for the first time. They had fought under various commands, including the [[New Fourth Army]], the [[National Revolutionary Army]], and the [[Eighth Route Army]], with most over 90 years old then. Some of the passed warriors' widows marched in place of their late husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.163.com/15/0902/02/B2FOO75J00014JB6.html|title=日籍八路军等40余名日本老兵抵京参加纪念活动|language=zh|publisher=环球时报-环球网(北京)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides Chinese soldiers, some surviving airmen of [[United States Air Force]] who had fought alongside Chinese forces also joined the veterans column. The veterans rode in open-top buses at the start of the parade and were escorted by the People's Armed Police Motorcycle Escort Squadron.

===Marchpast columns===
==== Colour party ====
The [[color guard]] consisted of 207 men and women from the [[Beijing Garrison Honor Guard Battalion|PLA Honor Guard Battalion]], who escorted the [[Colours, standards and guidons#People.27s Republic of China|national military colours]]. This marked the first occasion of female service personnel forming part of the [[honor guard]] during a national parade. Their first public presentation occurred during the state visit of the President of Turkmenistan to Beijing in May 2015, where for the first time they used the Type 56 ceremonial rifle.

==== Representative companies from CPC units of the Second Sino-Japanese War ====
The Communist Party of China's hero squads consisted of detachments that traced their lineage to units that participated in the war against Japan, which included the "Langya Mountain Five Hero Squad" (狼牙山五壮士), "[[Battle of Pingxingguan|Battle of Pingxingguan Hero Squad]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://v.163.com/zixun/VB1DM9C42/VB1LCQOTI.html|title="平型关大战突击连"英模部队方队亮相}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "[[Hundred Regiments Offensive|Hundred Regiments Offensive Hero Squad]]". Representative detachments from each [[PLA military region|Chinese military region]] participated in the parade, led by soldiers carrying standards used by the predecessor units.

These represented the following CPC formations during the war against Japan:

* [[Eighth Route Army]]
* [[New Fourth Army]]
* [[Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army]]
* Southern China guerrilla organizations under CPC control

==== People's Armed Police ====
A detachment of the [[People's Armed Police]] also participated in the parade, the unit having previously been part of the PLA. The unit's lineage, through the [[114th Division (People's Republic of China)|114th Division]] of the [[38th Group Army|38th Army]], can also be traced to regiments that fought during the war.

==== Foreign contingents ====

Groups from 17 countries were sent to take part in the military parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.163.com/15/0903/11/B2J70IES00014JB6.html|title=17个外军参阅部队走过北京天安门|language=zh|publisher=中国新闻网(北京)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marching in alphabetical order these were:

==After the parade==
The Parade began at 10:09 and ended at 11:40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.163.com/special/yuebing_zhibo/|title=抗战胜利70周年大阅兵}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the parade, Xi Jinping held a reception of the visiting international dignitaries.

China's [[Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of National Defence]] spokesman Yang Yujun said that the cuts to the size of the military would include personnel not trained for battle.

According to his opinion, China will modify the 'command system' by simplifying its management structure. China's one-star general Xu Guangyu also said that the China's [[People's Armed Police]] will be reformed appropriately.

For historical reasons, China's military structure emphasizes the army and land forces.

The '''Afropunk Festival''' (commonly referred to as '''Afropunk''' or '''Afropunk Fest''') is an annual arts festival that includes live music, film, fashion, and art produced by black artists. The festival made its first debut at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] (BAM) in 2005, and has since expanded to other parts of the world. Originally co-founded by [[James Spooner]] and Matthew Morgan, the festival was inspired by Spooner's 2003 documentary film ''[[Afro-Punk (film)|Afro-Punk]], which'' spotlighted black punks across America and later culminated in a series of live shows entitled "The Liberation Sessions" co-curated by Spooner and Morgan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.villagevoice.com/2013/08/21/afropunk-started-with-a-documentary-ten-years-two-websites-and-eight-festivals-later/ ''AfroPunk Started With a Documentary''], Village Voice&lt;/ref&gt; The festival originally sought to provide black people an opportunity to build community within the predominantly white [[punk subculture]] and to provide a stage for black alternative performers that were not acknowledged in the mainstream and stood outside hip hop, R&amp;B, soul, etc.&lt;ref name="Giorgis" /&gt; To attract a wider audience, the festival shifted to include [[soul music]] and [[hip hop]], which expanded its target demographic, attracting headliners including [[Ice Cube]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], and [[Gary Clark, Jr.]].&lt;ref name="Giorgis"&gt;{{cite news |first=Hannah |last=Giorgis |date=August 26, 2015 |title=Gentrifying Afropunk |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/lenny-kravitz-lauryn-hill-grace-jones-to-headline-afropunk-nyc-20150602 |accessdate=September 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Musical performers now represent a variety of genres, primarily known to reflect African-American culture.

Afropunk's changes to its diverse cultural showcase has allowed for the festival to build its masses to 60,000 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/is-the-afropunk-festival-no-longer-punk-813|title=Is Afropunk Fest No Longer Punk?|last=Josephs|first=Brian|date=August 17, 2015|website=VICE|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to festival alterations that deviated from the original Afropunk culture, former co-founder, James Spooner made the decision to end his involvement in 2008. Soon after, Jocelyn Cooper was introduced to the festival as co-organizer, broadening Afropunk Fest to Atlanta, Paris, London, and Johannesburg, South Africa.

== History ==

=== 2003-2005 ===
James Spooner debuted his 66-minute documentary film ''Afro-Punk'' in 2003. It explores the lives of black youth within a white punk subculture with the aim of expanding notions of blackness and reclaiming rock's roots by providing a platform for black artists that were not given the opportunity elsewhere. Growing up bi-racial, on the streets of New York City, Spooner discovered and connected with the punk music scene and its culture but also felt alienated from both his white peers in the scene and the black community outside the scene. After examining the world of hardcore punk in America at the time, and noticing the lack of people of color, along with the absence of dialogue around race despite its activist leanings, he began to question what it means to be black within alternative scenes. Digging deeper into the subject of race became the inspiration for his documentary. Traveling throughout the United States and abroad, Spooner followed the lives of four African Americans who submerged and dedicated their lives to the punk rock scene and its values. Through exclusive interviews with punks and various punk rock bands including, [[Fishbone]], [[24-7 Spyz]], and [[Dead Kennedys]], Spooner's documentary covered issues of loneliness, exile, inter-racial dating, and the double lives people of color lead within a predominately white sub-cultured community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.villagevoice.com/2013/08/21/afropunk-started-with-a-documentary-ten-years-two-websites-and-eight-festivals-later/ ''AfroPunk Started With a Documentary''], Village Voice&lt;/ref&gt;

Spooner toured the film throughout the United States and the world, screening it over 300 times and garnering followers and building community. He then created a message board to connect alternative black people from around the world. Soon after he held shows to foster that community. Shows included Bad Brains Tributes, The Double Consciousness Rock series at CBGBs, a west coast tour and screening with Ricky Fitts, and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nylon.com/articles/afropunk-punk-roots-2017 ''Looking for The Punk That's Gone Missing''], Nylon Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Spooner was later interested in having the black fronted rock band Stiffed perform after one of his screenings. He contacted Santi White's manager, Matthew Morgan, who thought that the opportunity would be a vehicle to get Santi signed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/08/21/james-spooner-afropunk|title=The True Story of How Afropunk Turned A Message Board Into A Movement|last=Kameir|first=Rawiya|date=21 August 2015|website=The Fader|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After success with Spooner's film and the live events, the two began to collaborate on a party called the Liberation Sessions, which promoted black artistry via music and film. Two years later, they would go on to create the Afropunk Music and Film Festival from 2005 to 2008 in conjunction with the Brooklyn Academy of Music.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thebridgebk.com/how-brooklyns-afropunk-fest-grew-from-indie-to-global/ ''How Brooklyn's AfroFest Became A Global Brand''], The Bridge Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AFROPUNK.com ===
After being featured at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], [[American Black Film Festival]], and the Pan African Film &amp; Arts Festival, ''AfroPunk'' began receiving multiple awards and forms of recognition from all over the world. With ''Afro-Punk''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s rising notability, Spooner mobilized the black punk rock community he had created on Afropunk.com's message board. The message board gained thousands of members with common interests: black punk rock music and values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefader.com/2015/08/21/james-spooner-afropunk ''The True Story of How AfroPunk Turned a Message Board Into a Movement''], Fader Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, 2018, Lou Constant-Desportes, founding editor-in-chief of AFROPUNK.com, announced his resignation citing "performative 'activism' dipped in consumerism and '[[woke]]' keywords used for marketing purposes," as well as "lies, gaslighting, disrespect, victim-blaming, exploitation, not to mention overworked, undervalued and underpaid staff being kept in precarious situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Darville |first=Jordan |url=https://www.thefader.com/2018/09/05/afropunk-editor-resigns-cites-performative-activism-employee-mistreatment-open-letter |title=AFROPUNK editor resigns, cites “performative activism,” employee mistreatment |work=Fader |date=2018-09-05 |accessdate=2018-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2005-2008 ===
Afropunk, the festival, was created as a safe space for black alternative-minded punks to freely express themselves and build a community with one another. The festival was free and was supported by The Brooklyn Academy of Music. As the festival grew larger, reaching larger demographics, the presence of punk culture began to shift toward a larger audience, focusing more on neo-soul, pop, or hip hop performances. Along with the notable change in the festival's focused genre, the festival also began charging admission prices. As Afropunk became scantily punk, moving away from its origins and original demographic, James Spooner also departed. During Afropunk's fourth festival, a rap-reggea-punk band performed a cover of [[Buju Banton]]'s, "Boom Bye Bye," which caused controversy with the black queer community, one of Afropunk's core target demographic groups. Spooner jumped on stage and denounced the song and its presence at the festival. Disheartened with how Morgan was deviating from Afropunk's original values, and transitioning the festival more towards a mainstream audience, James Spooner departed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ny.racked.com/2015/8/20/9180091/afropunk-festival-history ''How AfroPunk Became a Full Blown Movement''], Racked Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 - Present ===
After James Spooner's departure in 2008, music industry veteran, Jocelyn Cooper joined Matthew Morgan in 2009. As the former head of A&amp;R at Universal, Cooper transitioned into Afropunk's music festival by aiding in the development of their sponsorships and directing Multiply, Afropunk's marketing, content, and advertising agency. With Cooper's involvement, she's was able to secure brand partnership deals with [[MillerCoors]], [[Toyota]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and [[Pantene]]. As Jocelyn developed relationships with major companies, giving her the opportunity to broaden Afropunk across seas, she was able to expand the Brooklyn-based summer festival from 2,500 attendees to 90,000 among multiple cities, including Atlanta in 2015 and Paris and London in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3043954/jocelyn-cooper|title=Jocelyn Cooper|last=Naasel|first=Kenrya|date=11 May 2015|website=Fast Company|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; New to the roster for its 2017 festival tour will include Johannesburg, South Africa.

=== Criticisms ===
Having emerged from political punk roots, Afropunk Fest has faced criticism throughout its history,&lt;ref&gt;[https://mg.co.za/article/2017-05-19-00-afropunks-growing-gains-and-pains ''AfroPunk's Growing Pains''], Mail &amp; Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; including backlash over booking choices such as MIA (a non black performer who critiqued the Black Lives Matter Movement),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/12/aim-and-mias-provocative-pop ''M.I.A.'s Provocative Pop''], The New Yorker&lt;/ref&gt; Ice Cube (a rapper with past accusations of misogyny),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ice-cube-defends-misogyny-in-nwa-lyrics_us_55ce1c35e4b055a6dab03267 ''Ice Cube Justifies Lyrics...''], Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt; Tyler the Creator (a performer with a history of homophobia and lyrics normalizing rape),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/08/odd-future-tyler-creator-rape ''Rappers and Rape''], The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; along with others. Attendees have also critiqued the values of Afropunk's organizers surrounding LGBQT concerns, treatment of employees, and its corporate leanings. Some attendees critique the festival for appealing to white audiences&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.teenvogue.com/story/cultural-appropriation-ally-afropunk ''How to be a Good Ally at AfroPunk'']&lt;/ref&gt;, including an instance of attendees being removed from an area of the festival for wearing a homemade t-shirt critical of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theroot.com/couple-thrown-out-of-afropunk-for-protest-t-shirt-quest-1828793292 ''Couple Thrown Out Of AfroPunk VIP''], The Root&lt;/ref&gt; In August of 2018, Afropunk's Editor-In-Chief resigned after over a decade of work for Afropunk citing mistreatment and a corporate agenda he labeled "performative activism".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thefader.com/2018/09/05/afropunk-editor-resigns-cites-performative-activism-employee-mistreatment-open-letter ''AFROPUNK Editor Resigns'']&lt;/ref&gt; There are also lawsuits and other reports of abuse that have been circulating the festival. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vibe.com/2018/10/afropunk-festival-staff-reports-abuse/ ''Festival Staff Abuse, Vibe Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2661">'''Bakitone International''' is a non-profit organization based in Athens, Greece that maintains a network of almost 1000 international classical [[music competitions]] around the world. Bakitone International represents interests of [[European Broadcasting Union]] members at the international level in the field of classical music since 2010.

In 2009 Bakitone International has opened branches in [[Moscow, Russia]], [[Shanghai, China]] and [[Los Angeles, USA]]. The organization has quickly earned international acclaim amongst young artists, as well as famous musicians, such as [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]], [[Daniel Pollack]] and [[Yuri Bashmet]].

The '''Battle of Damascus''' ({{lang-ar|معركة دمشق}}), also known as '''Operation Damascus Volcano''' ({{lang-ar|عملية بركان دمشق}}), started on 15 July 2012 during the [[Syrian Civil War]]. It is unclear who started the battle. Thousands of rebels infiltrated [[Damascus]] from the surrounding countryside. Following this, according to some reports, the opposition forces launched an operation to capture the capital, while according to other reports, the military learned of the large-scale rebel operation beforehand and made a preemptive strike. Some reports even suggested the rebels launched the operation prematurely due to their plans being discovered by the security forces.

After the rebels initially captured half a dozen districts and killed four high-ranking government ministers in a bombing, opposition forces were forced to retreat following a military counter-attack, leaving the army in control of the capital after three weeks of fighting. It was the first time tanks and helicopters had been deployed in central Damascus and left parts of the city as a warzone.

On 15 July, fierce fighting was reported in some quarters of central Damascus as the army moved in to dislodge rebels. The rebels fighting were the ones who were routed from Douma and other suburbs and fled to Damascus itself.

After the bombing, the Free Syrian Army claimed that army troops had withdrawn from the Midan district. However, less than an hour later, state TV claimed to be broadcasting live footage of clashes in the neighborhood. According to Al-Jazeera, the military shelled the district. Early in the evening, opposition activists reported that Midan was raided by the military.

Opposition activists claimed that Syrian army commander Mohammad al-Bardan defected to the rebel side along with his soldiers&lt;ref name=nowlebanon/&gt; and Al Arabiya reported that soldiers from 3rd Armored Division were withdrawing from several Damascus districts and leaving their tanks behind following the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4257524,00.html|title=Celebrations, defections follow Damascus blast|work=ynet|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not independently confirmed or relayed by other news media.

As before, this report could not be independently verified due to restrictions placed on the journalists.&lt;ref name=nowlebanon/&gt; A monitoring group, SOHR, reported that 60 soldiers had been killed on the third and fourth day of fighting.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/07/20127189355415804.html|title=Damascus blast 'kills' top Assad officials|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The security forces gave residents 48 hours to flee the fighting area. One military source told that the army exercised restraint in its response in Damascus but that after the bombing, they would use all their weapons to finish the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=420619|title=Hundreds flee Damascus fighting, NGO says|date=10 August 2012|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721070021/http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=420619#|archive-date=21 July 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military counter-attack===
[[File:Damascus Checkpoint.jpeg|thumb|Syrian soldier manning a checkpoint with a [[PK machine gun]]]]
On 19 July, the military launched an offensive to push back rebel forces that infiltrated Damascus.&lt;ref name=freshoffensive&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18897773|title=Syria conflict: Fresh offensive against rebels|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 October 2014|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damascus residents reported ongoing shelling of several districts, including Midan and Kafr Souseh. Residents were meanwhile arming themselves, with many citizens fleeing districts which were hit by ongoing battles. The army removed its checkpoints around Midan district and the ancient Old City for reasons unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/07/19/uk-syria-crisis-idUKBRE86H18C20120719|title=Rebels keep pressure on Assad, fight near government buildings|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014|work=Reuters|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, opposition groups accused the Syrian army in massacring 100 civilians that had been shot and killed by security forces gunfire during a funeral procession in al-Sayida Zainab on the outskirts of Damascus. However, later reports by opposition groups revised the toll to at least 60. Meanwhile, the FSA reportedly shelled [[Damascus International Airport]] with mortars 20 times.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/07/19/227178.html|title=Around 100 Syrians in a mass funeral killed by Assad regime: opposition group|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216184209/http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/07/19/227178.html#|archive-date=16 December 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=freshoffensive/&gt;

It was reported that the president, [[Bashar al-Assad]], was in the coastal city of Latakia, directing the fighting in Damascus. However, it was unclear if he traveled there from Damascus before or after the bombing attack. One opposition official stated that they had information he may have been in Latakia for days.

An activist based in the eastern Damascus district Mezze said in interview with [[The Guardian]] that rebels had taken control over the Midan and Qaboun districts with fighting raging in Kafr Souseh and Mezze. He also claimed three tanks were destroyed in Kafr Souseh by the FSA.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/jul/19/syria-crisis-aftermath-damascus-assassinations-live#block-25|title=The Guardian Middle East Live Blog 19.7.2012|author=Matthew Weaver|work=the Guardian|accessdate=25 October 2014|location=London|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A man claiming to be a civilian from Midan said  "Midan is back to normal. There were some militias who tried to control the neighbourhood, but the army came in. The [rebel] fighters were from outside Midan. Now it is free of all military opposition presence." In regards to the reported executions he said "I can't confirm or deny it. But I don't think execute is the right word. These people are fighters. They are not civilians. If they were killed it doesn't mean they were executed, and they were not captured and then killed. They were killed during the operation." He also added that Mezzeh was not fully under government control, with the eastern orchard being a hideout for rebels. He added "People are being encouraged to come back to Damascus. There's been a big media campaign by al-Jazeera and al-Arabiya making people believe that the whole area was under rebel control, but they only controlled some streets." Asked about Assad's whereabouts he said "I know he is in Damascus. The new minister of defence took the oath of office in the presidential palace with the president. This is the same room they have used for years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/jul/23/syria-damascus-aleppo-battles-live|title=Syria crisis: chemical weapon warning - 23 July 2012|author=Matthew Weaver|work=the Guardian|accessdate=25 October 2014|location=London|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other civilians were terrified for Government reprisals to speak openly in front of a camera. Alex Thompson stated that in his journey to Midan terrified locals told him that "They used cannons, mortar, machine guns, tanks, they used helicopters – they use everything against us." Others said that the pro-Government militia, shabiba, massacred a family of sixteen in the district. Thompson claimed that the incident resembled the same "story we heard of Al-Houla" with "The familiar pattern of heavy shelling and bombardment followed by militia going house to house looting and massacring." Thompson described a scene in Midan of pulverised buildings and bodies lying on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.channel4.com/alex-thomsons-view/battle-midan/2389|title=After the battle of Midan|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the retreat of rebel forces from much the city, fighting continued.

Following the battle, the FSA stated that they were to conduct guerrilla hit-and-run attacks against security forces in the capital in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2012-08-05/syria-forces-vow-decisive-battle/56809400/1|title=Syrian forces vow 'decisive' showdown for Aleppo|work=USATODAY.COM|accessdate=25 October 2014|date=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 August, the Syrian army clashed with rebels in the heart of Damascus near the Syrian central bank according to state TV and residents. An explosion was followed by fighting which appeared to be spreading, said the resident, who asked not to be named for fear of arrest. "The explosion was huge. There has been fighting for the past half an hour along Pakistan Street. I am very close.

[[File:Beautiful Joe By Marshall Saunders.jpg|thumb|right]]

'''Beautiful Joe''' was a [[dog]] from the town of [[Meaford, Ontario]], whose story inspired the bestselling 1893 [[novel]] '''''Beautiful Joe''''', which contributed to worldwide awareness of [[animal cruelty]].

==The real Beautiful Joe==
The real Beautiful Joe was an [[Airedale terrier|Airedale-type]] dog. He was medium-sized, brown, and described as likely being part [[bull terrier]] and part [[fox terrier]]. He was also described as a [[Mixed-breed dog|mongrel]], a cur, and a mutt. He was originally owned by a local [[Meaford, Ontario|Meaford]] man, who cruelly abused the dog to the point of near death, and even cut off his [[ears]] and [[tail]]. Walter Moore, father of Louise Moore, rescued the dog in 1890, from what likely would have been a violent and painful death. In 1892, [[Margaret Marshall Saunders]] (1861&amp;ndash;1947), first learned about Beautiful Joe when she visited her brother and his wife, Louise Moore. Saunders was so touched by Joe's story that she wrote a [[novel]]-length, [[fictional]]ized, [[autobiographical]] version of it, entitled ''Beautiful Joe''. Margaret Saunders relocated the story to a small town in [[Maine]] and changed the family's name from Moore to Morris to win a literary contest sponsored by the American Humane Education Society. The book was first [[publish]]ed in 1893. By 1900, over 800,000 copies sold in the U.S., 40,000 in Canada and 100,000 in the United Kingdom.

Saunders chose to write ''Beautiful Joe'' as an "[[autobiography]]" and tell the story from Beautiful Joe's viewpoint, and in her imagined version of Beautiful Joe's own words. While it was not the first book to tell a story from an animal's viewpoint – ''[[Black Beauty]]'' by [[Anna Sewell]] was already on its way to becoming classic literature by then – it was still an uncommon narrative device. This unusual viewpoint allowed the reader into Beautiful Joe's mind, and inarguably led the reader to feel more sympathy toward the [[narrator]] than if the material had been presented in a straightforward and documentative manner. Also, Saunders believed that she would not be taken seriously as a writer using the obviously female name Margaret Saunders, so she wrote using the variant name Marshall Saunders.

==Fame and legacy==
Saunders submitted her story to a writing contest being run by the [[Humane Society]] in 1893. It won, and the following year it was published as a novel.  The response was tremendous; both the book and its subject received worldwide attention. It was the first Canadian book in history to sell over a million copies, and by the late 1930s had sold over 7 million copies worldwide. In 1902, a sequel, ''Beautiful Joe's Paradise'', was published. In 1934, Saunders was granted Canada's highest [[civilian]] award at the time, [[Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] or C.B.E. In 1963, the official Beautiful Joe Park was named in Meaford, next to the Moore house where Beautiful Joe was rehabilitated by Louise Moore. A '''Beautiful Joe Heritage Society''' was formed in 1994 to preserve Joe's legacy and ultimately establish the Moore residence as a [[museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beautifuljoe.org/project.cfm Future Projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413192334/http://www.beautifuljoe.org/project.cfm |date=2008-04-13 }} from BeautifulJoe.org Accessed April 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection with ''Black Beauty''==
Saunders did not avoid comparison of her work to the similarly themed ''[[Black Beauty]].'' Indeed, she makes reference to ''Black Beauty'' in the very first page of ''Beautiful Joe'', not referring to it by name but writing [from Joe's viewpoint] "I have seen my mistress laughing and crying over a little book that she says is a story of a horse's life". Joe goes on to say that he will write the story of a dog's life, to similarly please his owner. Thus, within the context of the book at least, ''Beautiful Joe'' is directly inspired by ''Black Beauty''.

==Electoral system==
The elections for the 47 seats of the National Assembly were planned to be held in two rounds: In the first round, voters would have voted for a party. The two parties with the largest share of the national vote would then have been able to field candidates in the 47 constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=0fc17dd6-a4cd-4ccc-9dd4-e0fc571d7c02&amp;&amp;Headline=Caretaker+PM+appointed+in+Bhutan |title=Caretaker prime minister appointed in Bhutan |date=3 August 2007 |publisher=Indo-Asian News Service |work=Hindustan Times |accessdate=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as only two parties successfully registered for the election, the election was held in one round.&lt;ref name = "BBC-Bhutan-election"/&gt;

==Background==

===Mock elections===
On 21 April 2007, a [[mock election]] was held to prepare the population of Bhutan for the imminent change to democracy. These elections were held in all 47 National Assembly constituencies and at 869 polling stations with around 1,000 voters at each one of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=28cf6a1b-2ac2-429d-a56e-fbc4564dacf6&amp; Bhutan set for mock elections on April 21] Hindustan Times, 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The parties "contesting" the election were the [[Druk]] Blue Party, the Druk Green Party, the Druk Red Party and the Druk Yellow Party (with ''Druk'' being [[dzongkha]] for "thunder dragon"), each of them representing certain values as their "party manifesto": yellow for traditional values, red for industrial development, blue for fairness and accountability, and green for the environment. The two parties winning the most votes were to proceed to a run-off election scheduled for 28 May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6578421.stm Bhutan holds fake national poll] BBC News, 21 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Election observers were present from the [[United Nations]] and from [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21592367-2703,00.html Bhutan's election dummy run] The Australian, 21 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The two leading parties, Druk Yellow Party and Druk Red Party, put up randomly chosen high school students as candidates in the 47 constituencies in the second round on 28 May 2007. The Druk Yellow Party swept the vote and won 46 of the 47 constituencies. Turnout in the second round was 66%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/News/article/219222 Bhutan mock poll votes for tradition] The Star, 30 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

283,506 people had registered to vote, though it is considered likely that a total of 400,000 would have been eligible to register as voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiaenews.com/asia/20070528/53749.htm Encouraging turnout in Bhutan's historic mock polls] India eNews, 28 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schedule==
The election procedure began with the submission of the letters of intent, lists of candidates, copies of election manifestos and audited financial statements by the two political parties contesting the elections to the election commission followed by the release of the party manifestos by them on 22 January 2008.&lt;ref name="assembly elections"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=9739 |title=March is on to Assembly Elections |work=Kuensel Newspaper |date=19 January 2008 |accessdate=11 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 31 January to 7 February 2008 both political parties submitted the nomination papers for their candidates for the 47 constituencies. The candidates, whose nominations were accepted, started campaigning in their constituencies from 7 February. The election campaign ended at 9:00 on 22 March. The last date for receiving the postal ballots was 18 February. The elections were held on 24 March from 09:00 to 17:00 followed by the counting of ballots on the same day. The results were declared on 25 March.&lt;ref name="assembly elections" /&gt;

All eligible voters were allowed to register with the election commission until 20 February 2008 for the inclusion of their names in the voters list which was updated to include those eligible voters who were eighteen years old on or before 1 January 2008. The final electoral roll was published on 5 March 2008.&lt;ref name="assembly elections" /&gt;

Turnout reached nearly 80% by the time the polls closed, and the [[Bhutan Peace and Prosperity Party]] reportedly won 44 seats, with the [[People's Democratic Party (Bhutan)|People's Democratic Party]] winning only three seats (Phuentsholing in Chhukha, Goenkhatoe-Laya in Gasa and Sombeykha in Haa). The PDP's leader, [[Sangay Ngedup]], who was also the ruling king's uncle, lost his own constituency by 380 votes. Reportedly, there were few differences between the platforms of the two parties, which might explain the unexpectedly uneven results; analysts were worried that the small representation of the opposition might have obstructed the functioning of the newly founded democratic system, but this does not to appear to have happened, as power peacefully changed hands after the People's Democratic Party won the [[Bhutanese National Assembly election, 2013|2013 National Assembly elections]]. Both parties had pledged to follow the king's guidelines of "pursuing [[Gross National Happiness]]", and both party leaders had previously served in governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/world/asia/25bhutan.html |first=Somni |last=Sengupta |date=5 March 2008 |accessdate=20 November 2008 |title=Heavy Turnout in First Bhutan Election |work=The New York Times| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130301080749/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/world/asia/25bhutan.html| archivedate=1 March 2013| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another attempt to explain the BPPP's large-scale victory is that it is apparently the more royalist of the two parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/international/erdrutschsieg_der_royalisten_bei_den_wahlen_in_bhutan_1.694585.html Erdrutschsieg der Royalisten in Bhutan (International, NZZ Online)] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

An explanation popularly given by Bhutanese in the days leading up to the election for the lack of support for the People's Democratic Party was that it would encourage corruption and be contrary to the King's request for the Bhutanese to form a popular government to elect leadership having (as was popularly believed about the PDP) strong personal ties to both the King and Bhutanese business.

'''''Boomerang!''''' is a 1947 American [[crime]] [[film noir]] based on the true story of a vagrant who was accused of murder, only to be found not guilty through the efforts of the prosecutor. It stars [[Dana Andrews]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Karl Malden]], [[Arthur Kennedy]] and [[Jane Wyatt]].

The film was directed by [[Elia Kazan]], based on a story (written by [[Fulton Oursler]], credited as "Anthony Abbot") in ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' and was shot largely in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] after Kazan was denied permission to film in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], where the actual events occurred.&lt;ref name=bsis&gt;"'Boomerang!,' shot in Stamford, to be screened in Bridgeport", ''The Advocate'' of Stamford, Connecticut, October 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[semidocumentary]] also contains voice-overs by [[Reed Hadley]]. The film was entered into the [[1947 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4223/year/1947.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Boomerang! |accessdate=February 19, 2011|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Father Lambert (Wyrley Birch), a priest, is shot dead on a Bridgeport, Connecticut street at night. The police, led by Chief Robinson ([[Lee J. Cobb]]), fail to immediately find the murderer. It soon becomes a political hot potato, with the police accused of incompetence, and the city's reform-minded administration comes under attack. Robinson and the prosecutor Henry Harvey ([[Dana Andrews]]) come under severe pressure by political leaders to find the killer or bring in outside help.

After strenuous efforts yield nothing, a vagrant ex-serviceman, John Waldron ([[Arthur Kennedy]]), is apprehended and identified in a [[Police lineup|lineup]]. He is interrogated for two days by police until, deprived of sleep, he confesses. The evidence seems solid, and a gun in his possession is believed to be the gun that was used in the shooting. 

Harvey, however, is not convinced. He questions Waldron, investigates the evidence and the witnesses. Harvey then risks his reputation and incurs the wrath of the police and the public in proposing that the defendant is innocent, while he and his wife ([[Jane Wyatt]]) are also being threatened by a businessman named Harris ([[Ed Begley]]). In court, even though he is the prosecutor, Harvey lays out the flaws in the case before the judge, and indicates he intends to dismiss the charges. The judge suspects Harvey's motives; Harvey's relationship with Chief Robinson is strained; and a mob unsuccessfully attempts to impose their own justice on Waldron.

A sub-plot involving Paul Harris and a property under consideration for sale to the city—at a price Harris desperately needs to keep himself afloat—also has a prominent place in the film.  Harris tries to blackmail Harvey by threatening to destroy his wife, a planning committee member, unless he supports the sale and sits idle, allowing Waldron to be convicted. 

At a preliminary hearing, Harvey once again presents evidence that would lead to Waldron's exoneration. When a reporter gets wind of the double-dealing and threatens Harris with exposure, Harris commits suicide in the courtroom.

The film ends with a narration that the murder was never solved, and the real Henry Harvey was [[Homer Cummings]] who rose to the position of U.S. Attorney General.

==Background==
===Factual basis===
The film is based on an actual murder case in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] in 1924. While walking near the Lyric Theatre in downtown Bridgeport, the Rev. Hubert Dahme ("Father George Lambert" in the film) was fatally shot behind the left ear by a gun fired at close range. Those in the theatre were so shocked that no one thought to call for an ambulance until 10 minutes had passed. Two hours later, the priest was pronounced dead at St. Vincent's Hospital in Bridgeport.&lt;ref name=bsis/&gt; A vagrant and discharged soldier, [[Harold Israel]], was indicted for the murder. Israel confessed to the crime, and a .32 revolver was found in his possession that police believe was used in the murder. [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]] state's attorney [[Homer Cummings]] conducted a thorough investigation and found Israel innocent of the crime. Cummings (named "Henry Harvey" in the film) later became [[Attorney General]] of the [[United States]] under [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. The ''Morning Record'' was the name used in the film for the ''Bridgeport Post'' (now the ''[[Connecticut Post]]'').&lt;ref name=bsis/&gt;

===Filming locations===
Almost all of the film was shot in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], except for the courtroom scene shot in [[White Plains, New York]].&lt;ref name=dr&gt;Russell, Don, "'Roles' in movies are nothing new for city: Kazan used Stamford in the '40s", editorial page column in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', Stamford edition, page A10, April 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Stamford locations:&lt;ref name=dr/&gt;
* The [[South End of Stamford]], particularly at Saint Luke's Chapel. 
* Old Town Hall, particularly the Police Department offices and the stairway leading up from them to the courtroom.
* The Altschul home on Den Road in Stamford (for a meeting of leading citizens). 
* For a scene in which the pastor was killed, the movie used the front and sidewalk of the Plaza Theatre, which stood on Greyrock Place (a driveway leading into the [[Stamford Town Center]] Mall is at that location now).
* The former offices of ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]]'' of Stamford, the local daily newspaper, on Atlantic Street. Some members of the ''Advocate'' editorial staff members were used in a scene about the news breaking that the priest killer had been caught.

The movie premiered at the Palace Theatre in Stamford on March 5, 1947, with Kazan and Andrews in attendance. (Kazan later filmed ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'' which takes place in [[Darien, Connecticut]], adjacent to Stamford, and which also included the actress Jane Wyatt.)&lt;ref name=bsis/&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
When first released film critic [[Bosley Crowther]] discussed the filmmaking, writing the "...style of presentation has resulted in a drama of rare clarity and punch."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9506E5D8103EEE3BBC4E53DFB566838C659EDE Crowther, Bosley]. ''The New York Times'', film review, March 6, 1947.  Last accessed: Last accessed: February 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The staff at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a positive review and wrote, "''Boomerang!'' is gripping, real-life melodrama, told in semi-documentary style. Lensing was done on location at Stamford, Conn, the locale adding to realism. Based on a still unsolved murder case in Bridgeport, Conn, plot is backed up with strong cast...All the leads have the stamp of authenticities. The dialog and situations further the factual technique. Lee J. Cobb shows up strongly as chief detective, harassed by press and politicians alike while trying to carry out his duties. Arthur Kennedy is great as the law's suspect."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117789437.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 ''Variety''.] Film Review, March 5, 1947.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7363">A '''card not present transaction''' ('''CNP''', '''MO/TO''', '''Mail Order / Telephone Order''', '''MOTOEC''') is a [[payment card]] transaction made where the cardholder does not or cannot physically present the card for a merchant's visual examination at the time that an order is given and payment effected. It is most commonly used for payments made over [[Internet]], but also mail-order transactions by mail or [[fax]], or over the [[telephone]].

Card not present transactions are a major route for [[credit card fraud]], because it is difficult for a merchant to verify that the actual cardholder is indeed authorizing a purchase.

If a fraudulent CNP transaction is reported, the [[acquiring bank]] hosting the [[merchant account]] that received the money from the fraudulent transaction must make restitution to the cardholder - this is called a [[chargeback]]. This is opposed to a card present transaction, when the issuer of the card is liable for restitution.&lt;ref name=cents&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=$9 Here, 20 Cents There and a Credit-Card Lawsuit |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/business/22digi.html?_r=1&amp;src=me&amp;ref=business |quote=If a credit card is physically swiped in the transaction, the bank that issued the card is on the hook for fraudulent charges. If it is a phone or Internet purchase — called a card-not-present transaction — the bank that hosted the merchant account that received the ill-gotten charges must make restitution, said Ms. Litan, the Gartner analyst. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 21, 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-24 | first=Randall | last=Stross}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the greater risk, some card issuers charge a greater transaction fee to merchants who routinely handle card not present transactions.

The [[card security code]]&lt;ref name="pc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crn" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2018|reason=Sources don't mention security codes etc.}} (commonly CVV2) system has been set up to reduce the incidence of credit card fraud arising from CNP.

==Mail-order fraud==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
If a card is not physically present when a customer makes a purchase, the merchant must rely on the cardholder, or someone purporting to be so, presenting card information indirectly, whether by mail, telephone or over the Internet.

[[Shipping companies]] may guarantee delivery of goods to a location, but they are normally not required to check identification and they are usually not involved in processing payments for the merchandise. A common preventive measure for merchants is to allow shipment only to an address approved by the cardholder, and merchant banking systems offer simple methods of verifying this information. Before this and similar countermeasures were introduced, mail order [[Carding (fraud)|carding]] was rampant as early as 1992. A ''carder'' would obtain the credit card information for a local resident and then intercept delivery of the illegitimately purchased merchandise at the shipping address, often by staking out the porch of the residence.

Small transactions generally undergo less scrutiny, and are less likely to be investigated by either the card issuer or the merchant. CNP merchants must take extra precaution against fraud exposure and associated losses, and they pay higher rates for the privilege of accepting cards. Fraudsters bet on the fact that many fraud prevention features are not used for small transactions.

Merchant associations have developed some prevention measures, such as single-use card numbers, but these have not met with much success. Customers expect to be able to use their credit card without any hassles, and have little incentive to pursue additional security due to laws limiting customer liability in the event of fraud. Merchants can implement these prevention measures but risk losing business if the customer chooses not to use the measures.

==Fraud==
{{main|Carding (fraud)}}
The United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] uncovered an operation running from 2006 to 2010 that netted more than $10 million in fraudulent charges on [[Credit card|credit]] and [[debit cards]]. The perpetrators used more than 100 [[merchant account]]s that they had created to do the billing.&lt;ref name=cents/&gt;&lt;ref name=pc&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=FTC Says Scammers Stole Millions, Using Virtual Companies |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/199952/ftc_says_scammers_stole_millions_using_virtual_companies.html |quote=The scammers stayed under the radar by charging very small amounts — typically between $0.25 and $9 per card — and by setting up more than 100 bogus companies to process the transactions. ... According to the FTC, the fraudsters charged 1.35 million credit cards a total of $9.5 million, but only 78,724 of these fake charges were ever noticed. |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PCWorld]] |date=June 27, 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each merchant account was attached to an [[Employer Identification Number]] belonging to a real merchant with a similar-sounding name.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;&lt;ref name=crn/&gt;

Each merchant account was tied to an 800-number from CallMe800.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; Each account was also tied to a website they had created. They also rented physical addresses from companies which rent [[virtual offices]], such as [[IWG plc|formerly Regus]], for each merchant account. These virtual office companies, which did not know of and were otherwise not involved in the [[Confidence trick|scam]], would then forward any mail received at the virtual office to Earth Class Mail, a [[digital mailroom]] service that scanned mail from the physical address of the merchant account and forwarded it as a [[PDF]] to [[email]] accounts that the scammers had established.&lt;ref name=cents/&gt;&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; The scammers also ensured that when they checked their online merchant accounts, that they used an [[IP address]] located near the billing address so as not to arouse suspicion.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;

A charge of $9 was processed on about one million credit cards over the four-year period.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; Each card was billed a single time. Credit card companies only investigate if the charge is more than $10 because it costs about that much to run an investigation. Then the money was moved to bank accounts in Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Kyrgyzstan where the money could not be traced or recovered. The perpetrators experimented with a 20-cent charge and that generated more suspicion than the $9 charge.&lt;ref name=cents/&gt; Only about 10 percent of the fraudulent charges were ever reported or contested by the card owner that was billed.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;&lt;ref name=crn&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=FTC Cracks Down On Micropayment Credit Card Scam |url=http://www.crn.com/news/security/225701708/ftc-cracks-down-on-micropayment-credit-card-scam.htm |quote=Altogether, the thieves charged a total of $9.5 million from a total of 1.35 million compromised cards over a period of four years starting in 2006.

'''''Casus foederis''''' (or '''''casus fœderis''''')  is derived from the [[Latin]] for "case for the alliance". In [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] terms, it describes a situation in which the terms of an alliance come into play, such as one nation being attacked by another.

=== War of the Pacific ===
{{see also|Treaty of Defensive Alliance (Bolivia–Peru)}}
In the [[War of the Pacific]], Bolivia invoked ''casus foederis'' to bring Peru into the war after Chile reinvaded Bolivia's coast. In 1879 Chilean armed forces occupied the port city of Antofagasta, after a Bolivian threat to confiscate the Chilean Antofagasta Nitrate Company's property. Peru attempted to mediate, but when Bolivia announced that a state of war existed, the situation deteriorated. Bolivia called on Peru to activate their secret mutual defense pact, whereas Chile demanded that Peru immediately declare its neutrality. On April 5, Chile declared war on both nations. The following day, Peru responded by acknowledging the casus foederis.

===World War I===
In [[World War I]], the treaties between [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], and [[Romania]], which purported to require Italy and Romania to come to Austria's aid if Austria was attacked by another nation, were ignored by both Italy or Romania because, as [[Winston Churchill]] wrote, "the casus fœderis had not arisen" since the attacks on Austria had not been "unprovoked."&lt;ref&gt;Winston Churchill, The World Crisis at 572 (Abridged -- Free Press 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

===NATO===
[[North Atlantic Treaty#Article 5|Article 5]] of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty]] governs mutual defense in the event of an attack on a member nation. It has been invoked only once: on September 12, 2001, in response to the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2006/issue2/english/art2.html Invoking Article 5] ''NATO Review.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chairing of the Bard''' ({{Lang-cy| Cadeirio'r Bardd}}) is one of the most important events in the [[Wales|Welsh]] [[eisteddfod]] tradition.  The most famous chairing ceremony takes place at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]], and is always on the Friday afternoon of Eisteddfod week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northwest/sites/eisteddfod/pages/history.shtml|title= Eisteddfod History|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= BBC|publisher= |access-date= 7 January 2014|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winners are referred to as ''[[Prifardd|Y Prifardd]]'' (literally "The Chief Bard").  The custom of chairing the bard is, however, much older than the modern eisteddfod ceremony, and is known to have taken place as early as 1176.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/896/|title= The Chairing Ceremony|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=  National Museum of Wales|publisher= |access-date= 7 January 2014|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Llew Jones]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/national-eisteddfod-celebrates-100th-anniversary-9806080|title= National Eisteddfod celebrates the 100th anniversary of the birth of celebrated writer T. Llew Jones|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= Wales Online|publisher= |access-date= 6 April 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A new bardic chair is specially designed and made for each eisteddfod and is awarded to the winning entrant in the competition for the "[[awdl]]", poetry written in a strict metre form known as [[cynghanedd]].  It is possible for the chair to be withheld, if the standard of entries is not considered high enough by the judges.  This was the case in 1889, when a chair made for a minor eisteddfod at [[Bagillt]], in Flintshire, was not awarded.  The chair in question made news in 2006, when it was returned to Wales after being acquired by a local Welsh society in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/6033639.stm |title= Bardic chair returns to village|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= BBC News|publisher= |access-date= 6 April 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happened most recently in 2013 at the Eisteddfod in [[Denbighshire]], [[Gwynedd]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-23638996&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Eisteddfod ceremony is presided over by the [[Archdruid]], who reads the judges' comments before announcing the identity of the bard, using only the [[nom de plume]] that the winner has used to submit the work.  Up to this point, no one knows the true identity of the bard, who is asked to stand and is then escorted to the stage.  Local children perform a dance to honour the new bard.

In 1917, [[Hedd Wyn]] (Ellis Humphrey Evans) was awarded the Chair for his [[ode]] "Yr Arwr" ("The Hero"). On 6 September 1917, when the ceremony of Chairing of the Bard took place at the National Eisteddfod, held at [[Birkenhead Park]], [[England]], the adjudicators announced that the winning entry had been submitted under the pseudonym ''[[Fleur de Lys]]''.  After the trumpets had summoned the winner three times to stand forth from the audience, [[Archdruid]] [[Evan Rees (Dyfed)|Dyfed]] announced that he had been killed in action six weeks earlier. The winner's chair was then draped in a black sheet, and was thus delivered to the parents of Hedd Wyn. That year's eisteddfod is now referred to in the [[Welsh language]] as "''Eisteddfod y Gadair Ddu''" ("The Eisteddfod of the Black Chair").

The chair from that ceremony, which was made by a Belgian carpenter, Eugeen Vanfleteren (1880–1950), who had fled to Britain when Belgium was invaded and had settled in Birkenhead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dehandschutter|first= Lieven|year=2001|title= Hedd Wyn. A Welsh tragedy in Flanders|publisher= Vormingscentrum Lodewijk Dosfel (Gent, Flanders, Belgium|page= 47|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is on display at Yr Ysgwrn, the poet's former home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-20857039 |title=BBC News – Wales honours: Libyan Mahdi Jibani MBE for medical and interfaith work |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-12-29 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winning the "double" of bardic chair and [[Crowning of the Bard|crown]] at the same eisteddfod is a feat that has only been performed a handful of times in the history of the eisteddfod.  [[Alan Llwyd]] and [[Donald Evans (Welsh poet)|Donald Evans]] have each performed the double twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.llgc.org.uk/blog/?p=6837|title= The Chairing of the Bard.|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= National Library of Wales|access-date= 6 April 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first woman to win the Chair at the National Eisteddfod was [[Mererid Hopwood]] in 2001; she went on to win the crown at a later eisteddfod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.museumwales.ac.uk/957/|title= Some facts and figures regarding Gorsedd ceremonies|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= National Museum Wales|access-date= 6 April 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8887">'''Common law offences''' are [[crime]]s under [[English criminal law]] and the related criminal law of other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. They are offences under the [[Common law#History|common law]], developed entirely by the [[law courts]], and therefore have no specific bases in [[statute]].

==Australia==
Under the [[criminal law of Australia]] the [[Criminal Code Act 1995]] (Cth) abolished all common law offences at the federal level.&lt;ref name="aph"&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/law/crimlaw.htm#history History of Australian Criminal Law], Parliament of Australia Library {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330101954/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/law/crimlaw.htm#history |date=March 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Australian Capital Territory]], the [[Northern Territory]], [[Queensland]], [[Tasmania]] and [[Western Australia]] have also abolished common law offences, but they still apply in [[New South Wales]], [[South Australia]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Although some common law offences still exist in New South Wales, many common law offences- for example nightwalking, riot, rout, affray, keeping of bawdy houses, champerty and maintainence, eavesdropping and being a common scold- have been abolished in that State.

==Canada==
In [[Canada]] the consolidation of criminal law in the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], enacted in 1953, involved the abolition of all common law offences except [[contempt of court]] (preserved by section 9 of the Code).

==England and Wales==
In [[England and Wales]], the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]]'s programme of codification of the criminal law included the aim of abolishing all the remaining common law offences and replacing them, where appropriate, with offences precisely defined by statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/legislating-the-criminal-code/|title=Legislating the Criminal Code - Law Commission|website=www.lawcom.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/criminal-law-a-criminal-code/|title=Criminal Law: A Criminal Code - Law Commission|website=www.lawcom.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common law offences were seen as unacceptably vague and open to development by the courts in ways that might offend the principle of certainty. However, neither the Law Commission nor the [[UK Parliament]] have completed the necessary revisions of the law, so common law offences still exist. In [[English law|England and Wales]] common law offences are punishable by unlimited fines and unlimited imprisonment.

Extant common law offences are listed at {{slink|English criminal law|Common law offences}}, and those that have been abolished or redefined as statutory offences are listed at {{slink|History of English criminal law|Common law offences}}.

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]] all common law offences were abolished under the [[Crimes Act 1961]], with the exception of [[contempt of court]] and of offences tried by [[court martial|courts martial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328048.html|title=Crimes Act 1961 No 43 (as at 28 September 2017), Public Act 9 Offences not to be punishable except under New Zealand Acts – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The notion that common law offenses could be enforced in federal courts was found to be unconstitutional by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin]]'', 11 U.S. 32 (1812). Some have argued that they are inconsistent with the prohibition of [[ex post facto]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/19155586/Common-Law-Crimes-Are-Unconstitutional-as-Ex-Post-Fact-Laws Common Law Crimes Are Unconstitutional as Ex Post Facto Laws], Anthony J. Fejfar (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the state level, the situation varies.  Some states, such as [[New Jersey]], have abolished common law crimes (see ''[[State v. Palendrano]]''), while others have chosen to continue to recognize them. In some states, the elements of many crimes are defined mostly or entirely by common law, i.e., by prior judicial decisions. For instance, [[Michigan]]'s penal code does not define the crime of [[murder]]: while the penalties for murder are laid out in statute, the actual elements of murder, and their meaning, is entirely set out in case law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= People v. Aaron|vol= 409|reporter= Mich.|opinion=672 |pinpoint= 713 |court=[[Michigan Supreme Court]] |date=1980 |url= https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5726386068390560061&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr |accessdate= 2 April 2018 |quote="In Michigan, murder is not statutorily defined."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|type=Mich.

{{2010 Winter Olympics}}
A number of '''concerns and controversies at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]''' in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, surfaced before and during the Games, and which received media coverage.

== Safety ==

=== Death of Georgian athlete Nodar Kumaritashvili ===
{{Main|Nodar Kumaritashvili}}

Hours before the opening ceremony, [[Nodar Kumaritashvili]] of Georgia was killed during a training run for the [[luge]] after he was thrown from his sled and struck a steel pillar at high speed, near the end of the course.&lt;ref name="bbc-crash"/&gt; The [[International Luge Federation]] called an emergency meeting after the accident, and all other training runs were cancelled for the day.&lt;ref name="bbc-crash"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympic_games/vancouver_2010/8513595.stm|title=Olympic luger Nodar Kumaritashvili dies after crash|date=February 12, 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=February 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|Vancouver Olympics Organizing Committee]] (VANOC) was criticized after members of the media assumed that VANOC was the governing body that conducted a prompt 12-hour investigation into the luger's death, which put the blame on the luger. In fact, it was the [[International Luge Federation]] (ILF) which conducted the investigation. The ILF has stated that it will investigate the crash and issue a report around the end of March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Metreveli|first=Irakli|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/oly2010lugegeokumaritashvilifuneral/print|title=Track controversy hangs over Georgian luger's funeral|publisher=[[Yahoo! News]]|date=February 20, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the [[Whistler Sliding Centre]], which has recorded some of the fastest speeds in luge history, was the site of several non-fatal accidents during training runs leading up to the start of the games.&lt;ref name="bbc-crash"/&gt; For more than a year prior to the Olympics, luge competitors had complained that the track was too fast and the turns were too dangerous. Athletes had nicknamed turn 13 the "50-50" turn for their chances of getting through it without crashing. Kumaritashvili was killed on turn 16, the last turn of the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Linda|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/columnists/linda-robertson/story/1478096.html|title=At Winter Olympics, grief before Opening Ceremonies|newspaper=[[Miami Herald]]|date=February 19, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the height of the wall Kumaritashvili surmounted was increased, with added wooden panels and padding. Officials also ordered changes to the layout of the final turn of the Whistler luge track, making it slower and safer, and moved the men's and women's luge starts down the track.&lt;ref name="luge track"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/luge/news/story?id=4911258|title=Officials insist track is safe|date=February 13, 2010|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumaritashvili's teammate, [[Levan Gureshidze]], did not race. He was on the official start list for the first run but withdrew, telling other racers he could not go on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/luge/news/story?id=4911258 |title=Olympians slide with heavy hearts |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He instead flew back to Georgia to mourn the loss of his fallen teammate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/luge/news/story?id=4920689 Luger Nodar Kumaritashvili's body returns to hometown in Georgia - ESPN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the starting gates were changed, competitors have complained that the junior starting position enters the main track with a turn that is too tight, causing sledders problems at the beginning of their runs.&lt;ref name=Slot/&gt; Some have also complained that slowing the course has decreased the challenge and forced them to adjust their strategy.{{Who|date=March 2010}}

Eleven months before the death of Kumaritashvili, [[Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|VANOC]] chief executive officer John Furlong started to be concerned that an athlete could get "badly injured or even worse" on the luge track.&lt;ref name="Globe1"&gt;{{Cite news|title=VANOC feared injury 'or worse' year before luger's fatal crash|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/british-columbia/vanoc-feared-injury-or-worse-year-before-lugers-fatal-crash/article1896694/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=February 6, 2011|accessdate=February 7, 2011|location=Toronto|first1=Rod|last1=Mickleburgh|first2=Jeff|last2=Blair}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC1"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Fatal luge track worried VANOC: CBC probe |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2011/02/06/vanoc-luge-track406.html |publisher=CBC News |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208124354/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2011/02/06/vanoc-luge-track406.html |archivedate=February 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Josef Fendt, who is the President of the [[International Luge Federation]], stated in a letter to the designer of the luge track that luge track was recording "historic sled speeds" that the speeds were nearly 20 kilometres an hour faster than the track designer had anticipated.&lt;ref name="Globe1"/&gt; John Furlong received a copy of the letter and asked for the situation to be looked at by the "legal guys".&lt;ref name="Globe1"/&gt; Svein Romstad, general secretary of the [[International Luge Federation]], stated that the [[International Luge Federation]] "would have sought major changes to the Whistler track if it had known ahead of time that speeds would be so much higher than calculated."&lt;ref name="Globe1"/&gt; A memo dated January 30, 2006 stated that, in March 2005, the [[International Luge Federation]] wanted major changes to six curves on the luge track including curves 15 and 16, where Kumaritashvili's problem began.&lt;ref name="CBC1"/&gt; Kumaritashvili's father became angry after reports showed that VANOC didn't act on their own concerns about the luge track's safety.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar1"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Luger's father angry VANOC didn't act on track dangers|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/olympics/article/934543--luger-s-father-angry-vanoc-didn-t-act-on-track-dangers?bn=1|publisher=Toronto Star|date=February 7, 2011|accessdate=February 7, 2011|first=Randy|last=Kman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family of Kumaritashvili received an insurance payout worth $150,000 from the VANOC.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar1"/&gt;

VANOC broke some rules in regards to the luging and bobsleigh track. [[International Luge Federation]] states that "the length for a luge track must not exceed {{convert|1350|m|feet}}."&lt;ref name="CBC2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Deadly luge track may have stretched the rules |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2011/02/10/f-luge-death-notebook.html |publisher=CBC News |date=February 10, 2011 |accessdate=February 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214095642/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2011/02/10/f-luge-death-notebook.html |archivedate=February 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[G-force]] was critical in the accident that killed Kumaritashvili.&lt;ref name="CBC2"/&gt; The rules of the [[Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing|International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation]] states that a g-force of 5 is the limit for the track.&lt;ref name="CBC2"/&gt; A g-force of 5.02 is possible for male lugers on the track in [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]].&lt;ref name="CBC2"/&gt; The rules of the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation also states that "to prevent the deterioration of the ice during warm, sunny periods, the finish straight should be shaded or covered."&lt;ref name="CBC2"/&gt; Part of what was to be considered in the shading of the finish straight was the safety of the athlete.&lt;ref name="CBC2"/&gt; The final straight was where the accident took place.&lt;ref name="CBC2"/&gt; Since the investigation and currently, sliders no longer start at the upper start area, they start {{convert|190|m}} downhill at the lower start: C1.

The [[President of Georgia]], [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], thanked the hosts for the way that they handled Kumaritashvili's death which included a moment of silence and a tribute at the opening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/winter-olympics/7293583/Winter-Olympics-2010-Vancouver-so-passionate-to-embrace-Games-says-Seb-Coe.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first1=Sebastian | last1=Coe | title=Winter Olympics 2010: Vancouver so passionate to embrace Games, says Seb Coe | date=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other safety concerns ===

Given Kumaritshvili's death on the 12th, other safety issues on speed for other events were raised at these games, most notably at the Sliding Centre.&lt;ref name=yhoo022210&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/news;_ylt=AqjD6LtIXohlZ09PrTIJXcSNsbV_?slug=ap-weighingtherisk&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns&amp;print=1 |title=Critical safety reviews lie ahead after Olympics |date=February 21, 2010 |first1=David |last1=Crary |first2=Stephen |last2=Wilson |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Yahoo! Sports |accessdate=February 22, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another noted injury took place in the [[Alpine skiing at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Women's downhill|women's downhill]]. The course was labelled as extremely difficult for skiers and most training runs were cancelled due to weather conditions. This resulted in several accidents during the competition event where [[Sweden at the 2010 Winter Olympics|Sweden]]'s [[Anja Pärson]] was badly bruised following a jump prior to the finish line of the event on February 17.&lt;ref name=yhoo022210 /&gt;

In [[Cross-country skiing at the 2010 Winter Olympics|cross-country skiing]], Slovenian skier [[Petra Majdič]] was severely injured after a fall during a practice run on the [[Cross-country skiing at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Women's sprint|sprint track]]. The fall led to Majdič sliding off the course and falling down a rocky slope. Despite having broken ribs and a collapsed lung, Majdič completed the women's sprint event and took the bronze medal. Slovenia filed a protest with the IOC about the safety of the course, but it was dismissed.&lt;ref name=nbc030110&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news-features/news/newsid=432093.html |title=Majdic won bronze with collapsed lung |date=February 21, 2010 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=NBCOlympics |accessdate=March 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310002944/http://www.nbcolympics.com/news-features/news/newsid%3D432093.html |archivedate=March 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety at LiveCity Vancouver ===

Dozens were injured and sent to hospital when a barricade erected at LiveCity Yaletown collapsed. Canadian rock band [[Alexisonfire]] played a free concert at LiveCity [[Yaletown]] on Tuesday, February 16. Ten seconds into the band's first song, the crowd of hundreds surged forward, which caused a section of the barricade to collapse, sending dozens to the ground. The band stopped playing immediately, and asked the crowd to step back. While Vancouver Police and on-site medical team controlled the situation, the crowd was informed that the show was cancelled, and they dispersed quickly and co-operatively.&lt;ref name=Safety&gt;{{cite news |last=Woo |first=Andrea |url=https://vancouversun.com/opinion/More+than+injured+crowd+topples+fence+Yaletown+LiveCity/2573504/story.html |title=Twenty people injured as crowd topples fence at Yaletown LiveCity |newspaper=[[Vancouver Sun]] |date=February 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221060322/http://www.vancouversun.com/opinion/More%2Bthan%2Binjured%2Bcrowd%2Btopples%2Bfence%2BYaletown%2BLiveCity/2573504/story.html |archivedate=February 21, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports indicate at least 20 people were injured with 10 being taken to hospital. On February 17 the band issued the following statement: "We are sincerely sorry that people were injured. We want to thank the security team, paramedics and police for their quick reaction. We especially want to thank our fans for cooperating and not making a bad situation worse." A representative for LiveCity Vancouver added "When the incident occurred, everyone acted quickly, professionally, and took appropriate action. The security and on-site emergency medical response teams provided immediate assistance and care, the band kept people calm, and the crowd dispersed safely."&lt;ref name=Safety/&gt;

== Bilingualism ==

The opening ceremony was criticized for a perceived lack of appropriate representation of French-speaking Canadians, in spite of Canada's status as a bilingual country. One who raised objections was the Secretary General of [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|La Francophonie]], [[Abdou Diouf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vivezvancouver.radio-canada.ca/vivezvancouver/CultureSociete/2010/02/12/004-francais_place.shtml|title=Déception chez les observateurs|date=February 12, 2010 |publisher=Radio-Canada|accessdate =February 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quebec Premier [[Jean Charest]] said the ceremony failed to respect and reflect the Francophone community in Canada.&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/02/14/olympics-french-charest-moore.html |title=Olympics need more French: heritage minister |date=February 14, 2010 |publisher=CBC |accessdate=February 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216151710/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/02/14/olympics-french-charest-moore.html |archivedate=February 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], the [[Minister of Canadian Heritage]], [[James Moore (Canadian politician)|James Moore]], was "disappointed" by the low representation of French during the ceremony.&lt;ref name="moore"/&gt;&lt;ref name=OC15Feb2010&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen|title=Heritage minister 'disappointed' by lack of French|first1=Mike|last1=Barber|first2=Jeff|last2=Lee|date=February 15, 2010|page=A5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.canoe.ca/infos/quebeccanada/archives/2010/02/20100214-173645.html|title=Comme la neige, le français se fait rare à Vancouver|date=February 14, 2010 |publisher=TVA|accessdate =February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian Member of Parliament [[Richard Nadeau]] of the [[Bloc Québécois]] sees rather a lack of political will to promote [[Official bilingualism in Canada|Canadian bilingualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberpresse.ca/le-droit/dossiers/vancouver-2010/201002/14/01-949646-un-manque-de-volonte-deplore-le-depute-richard-nadeau.php|title=Un manque de volonté, déplore le député Richard Nadeau|date=February 14, 2010 |publisher=TVA|accessdate =February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the 25,000 volunteers, only 15% of them speak French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberpresse.ca/sports/vancouver-2010/201002/14/01-949640-seuls-15-des-25000-benevoles-parlent-le-francais.php|title=Seuls 15% des 25 000 bénévoles parlent le français|date=February 14, 2010 |publisher=TVA|accessdate =February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|Commissioner of the Official Languages]], [[Graham Fraser]], was very disappointed by the lack of presence of French. He also said, "I had the impression of watching a show designed and produced in English with a French song. Even l'''Hymne du Nord'' from the poet [[François-Xavier Garneau]] has been translated into English to be read by the actor [[Donald Sutherland]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberpresse.ca/sports/vancouver-2010/201002/14/01-949639-le-francais-aussi-rare-que-la-neige-a-vancouver.php|title=Le français aussi rare que la neige à Vancouver|date=February 15, 2010 |publisher=cyberpresse|accessdate =December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VANOC, however, defended the case and said that they had made "a very deliberate focus and effort to ensure a strong celebration of Quebec culture and language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VANOC defends French content of opening ceremony|date=February 15, 2010|first=Rod|last=Mickleburgh|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|page=A6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also said that there was a significant amount of French in the opening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Not everyone happy with amount of French content at kickoff|date=February 15, 2010|first=Jeff|last=Lee|newspaper=The Vancouver Sun|page=A2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Atkins]], the artistic director of the opening ceremonies, said that the ceremonies did celebrate francophone Canada.&lt;ref name=French&gt;{{cite news|title=Political bigwigs and languages commissioner decry lack of French at Games|date=February 14, 2010|first=Dene|last=Moore|agency=Canadian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of the French include the speeches, the [[Olympic Hymn]], and the officials' oath. [[John Furlong (Canadian)|John Furlong]], VANOC CEO, [[Presidents of the International Olympic Committee|IOC President]] [[Jacques Rogge]], and [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Michaëlle Jean]] all addressed the crowd in English and French.&lt;ref name=French/&gt; [[Measha Brueggergosman]] performed the English version of the Olympic Hymn, but [[Dave Pierce]], the music director for the games, had his associate, Donovan Seidle, compose and arrange it to have some of the stanzas performed in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=Sounds of Vancouver 2010: Opening Ceremony Commemorative Album|medium=CD|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Verrault]], a speed-skating official, took the [[Olympic oath|officials' oath]] in French.

In his official report on the 2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony, Graham Fraser identified two causes for the lack of french in it. The first was lack of understanding. The commissioner said that "it was apparent that, in several areas, the official language requirements in the multi-party agreement signed by the organizing committee and [[Canadian Heritage]] were rather vague and unclear". He also stated the secrecy traditionally given to the opening ceremony prevented the commissioner from making sure that Canada's linguistic duality was well-showcased in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/497219/jo-vancouver-rapport-graham-fraser|title=Graham Fraser remet son rapport final|last=Radio-Canada|date=|website=Radio-Canada.ca|language=fr-ca|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent such mistake for future major events held in Canada, such as the [[2015 Pan American Games|2015 Panamerican Games]], "official language requirements must be specific and clear to ensure that organizing committees grasp the importance of linguistic duality, understand their official languages obligations and plan adequately." In early 2011, the [[Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages]] published guide in early 2011 based on the lessons learned at the Vancouver Games to help federal institutions and organizing committees of future large-scale sporting events to better understand, plan, implement, and monitor their activities toward the full respect and inclusion of English and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.officiallanguages.gc.ca/en/news/releases/2010/2010-12-14|title=Commissioner looks forward after linguistic shortfalls of the 2010 Olympic Games|date=|website=www.officiallanguages.gc.ca|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, one year following the Vancouver games, [[John Furlong (sports administrator)|Furlong]] discussed the language controversy in the Olympics in his book ''Patriot Hearts: Inside the Olympics that Changed a Country''. Furlong said he had received praise from Fraser before the opening ceremony because of the large amount of bilinguals in his staff. He added that he had attempted to have the Quebec Anthem ''[[Mon Pays]]'' sang at the ceremony as well, but were shot down by the [[Gilles Vigneault|song's author]]. Furlong defended his refusal to apologise for the perceived lack of french in the opening ceremony. He alleged that, when discussing the place of French at the Olympics, "Mr. Fraser pointed fingers from a distance but rarely pitched in with ideas or support."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/vancouver-olympic-ceo-john-furlongs-book-recalls-language-controversy/article565307/|title=Vancouver Olympic CEO John Furlong's book recalls language controversy|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser answered these criticism, saying that his office had given him precise indications and ideas to promote linguistic duality during the games, which were implemented. He said that, overall, the services in the Games were provided in both official languages, and that the absence of french was mostly in the cultural program, and this was the only part he took issue with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/furlongs-explanation-for-lack-of-french-at-2010-games-criticized/article565652/|title=Furlong's explanation for lack of French at 2010 Games criticized|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the release of Furlong's book on the 2010 Games, [[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]] editor André Pratte wrote a severe opinion piece on the lack of French in the opening ceremony, noting that "just trying is not good enough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/article/937665--no-medal-for-bilingualism|title=No medal for bilingualism - thestar.com|last=Pratte|first=André|date=February 12, 2011|work=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's ski jumping ==

The IOC voted in 2006 not to include women's ski jumping in the 2010 Games on the grounds that the sport was not yet developed enough and did not meet basic criteria for inclusion. The members of the Canadian Women Ski Jumping Team filed a grievance with the Canadian Human Rights Board citing gender discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2008-01-18-2335162792_x.htm |title=Groups to press IOC to allow women's ski jumping in 2010 Olympics|date=January 18, 2008|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=August 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to lobby group Women's Ski Jumping USA, a group composed of "some of the top women ski jumpers", filed a Statement of Claim with the Supreme Court of British Columbia suing the Vancouver Olympic Organizing Committee for excluding women ski jumpers from the Vancouver games claiming that their rights were violated according to the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Women ski jumpers suing for 2010 Olympic spot |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/amateur/story/2008/05/21/ski-jump-lawsuit.html |publisher=[[CBC Sports]] |date=March 23, 2008 |accessdate=January 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531002734/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/amateur/story/2008/05/21/ski-jump-lawsuit.html |archivedate=May 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 10, 2009, the Supreme Court ruled against the group, stating that though the women were being discriminated against,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvolympics.ca/ski-jumping/news/newsid=12739.html#no+female+flight+2010?cid=rssctv |title=CTV Olympics – No female flight in 2010: B.C. court rejects ski jump bid |publisher=Ctvolympics.ca |date=July 10, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109131020/http://www.ctvolympics.ca/ski-jumping/news/newsid%3D12739.html#no+female+flight+2010?cid=rssctv |archivedate=January 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the issue is an International Olympic Committee responsibility, and thus is not governed by the Charter, and finally, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms did not apply to VANOC, with the term, "In other words, VANOC is not under a duty to distribute equally what it has no power to provide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2009/07/10/bc-olympic-women-ski-jump-decision.html |title=CBC – NFemale ski jumpers lose Olympic battle |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=July 10, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714160644/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2009/07/10/bc-olympic-women-ski-jump-decision.html |archivedate=July 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Athletes' Village ==

[[File:Whistlerolyvillage.PNG|thumb|[[Whistler Olympic Village|Whistler Athletes' Village]] (more athletes stayed there than at the village in Vancouver)]]

The [[2010 Olympic Village|athletes' village]] located at Southeast False Creek was originally planned to be a model sustainable community, with state-of-the-art energy efficiency provisions, and a mix of market and [[Public housing|social housing]], at one third market, one third social housing and one third subsidized middle income housing. The city of Vancouver would break even through the sale of market housing. However, a new city council in 2005 dropped the provisions for subsidized middle income housing and then sold the lands to a private developer for [[Canadian dollar|C$]]193 million.&lt;ref&gt;Kear, M. (2007) "Spaces of transition—spaces of tomorrow: making a sustainable future in Southeast False Creek", in: ''Vancouver Cities''; Vol. 24, No. 4, pp. 324–334&lt;/ref&gt; Further controversy erupted when the private developer and its associated investment company backed out of the project, forcing the city of Vancouver to bear the liability, which resulted in the resignation of a city planner in protest and saw the city seek special legislation making changes to its charter to allow it to borrow money to finance completion of the project.&lt;ref name="Mackin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mackin |first=Bob |url=https://thetyee.ca/Blogs/TheHook/Olympics2010/2009/06/19/OlympicVillageReports/ |title=''Vancouver releases secret Olympic Village documents'', Bob Mackin, ''The Tyee'', June 19, 2009 |publisher=Thetyee.ca |date=June 19, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bctrialofbasi-virk.blogspot.com"&gt;[http://bctrialofbasi-virk.blogspot.com/search?q=fortress Speech by [[Corky Evans]] in the BC Legislature, Thursday, January 29, 2009, from BC [[Hansard]], Legislature Raids/Basi-Virk Trial webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading up to the Olympics, the [[International Olympic Committee]] had ordered the removal of a two-story high Australian [[Boxing Kangaroo]] flag which had been draped over a balcony in the athletes' village. The IOC ordered the flag to be taken down because they believed the image to be too commercial as it is a registered trademark (albeit of the Australian Olympic Committee).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/decision-on-boxing-kangaroo-ridiculous/story-e6frfku0-1225826968149 Decision on boxing kangaroo 'ridiculous'] – news.com.au, February 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The order for removal was later withdrawn after IOC president [[Jacques Rogge]] met with AOC president [[John Coates (sports administrator)|John Coates]].&lt;ref name=decision2&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/boxing-kangaroo-to-fly-at-aussie-village/story-e6freuyi-1225827883050 Boxing kangaroo to fly at Aussie village] – ''The Daily Telegraph'', February 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opening ceremonies content ==

On August 22, 2008, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' reported that the [[Premiership of Stephen Harper|government]] of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] mandated that the content of the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremonies]] reflect its agenda as a condition of its contribution of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]20 million to fund the event. This was widely criticized as government interference with the arts and exercising ideological control. However, VANOC vice-president of communications Renée Smith-Valade said the government was not bringing politics into the 2010 games and did not have veto power over any part of the Olympic ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ottawa aims to put its stamp on 2010 Games: Vancouver opening ceremony must help Harper government 'achieve its domestic and international branding goals,' memo says |date=August 22, 2008 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |last=Matas |first=Robert |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/article705918.ece |accessdate=August 22, 2008 |location=Toronto |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722061734/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/article705918.ece |archivedate=July 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security violation ==

A mentally ill man from British Columbia was able to use a homemade all-access pass at the opening ceremonies to clear several layers of security at BC Place Stadium and get close to [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]], who authorities say the man had an infatuation with. Before he could reach Biden, however, he was stopped by two plainclothes Mounties, who escorted him away. The man will not face charges, but has been committed to a psychiatric facility. The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) said it has not implemented any change in security at the Olympics following the breach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvolympics.ca/news-centre/newsid=44595.html#man+infatuated+with+u+s+vp+breaches+2010+security?cid=rssctv |title=Man infatuated with U.S. VP breaches security |publisher=CTVOlympics.ca |accessdate=February 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220073757/http://www.ctvolympics.ca/news-centre/newsid%3D44595.html#man+infatuated+with+u+s+vp+breaches+2010+security?cid=rssctv |archivedate=February 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cooptation of lines from national anthem ==

VANOC used lines from the [[O Canada|Canadian national anthem]] to serve as the official slogans for the games ("with glowing hearts" in English and "des plus brilliants exploits" in French) and trademarked their use. However, VANOC stated it would only challenge usage of the lines in the case of [[ambush marketing]], where an attempt is made to "create a specific, unauthorized commercial association with the 2010 Winter Games".&lt;ref name=VANOCProtect/&gt; The anthem itself is in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name=VANOCProtect&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vancouver2010.com/en/about-vanoc/the-vancouver-2010-brand/protecting-the-brand/-/32798/1i3nwix/index.html | title = Protecting the Brand | accessdate = November 22, 2008 | work = Vancouver 2010 | publisher = Vanoc | location = Vancouver, British Columbia }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="olympicmotto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/09/25/bc-vancouver-olympics-trademark-o-canada.html |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=January 7, 2009 |title=Olympic mottoes borrow lines from O Canada |date=January 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106174018/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/09/25/bc-vancouver-olympics-trademark-o-canada.html |archivedate=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- sponsors such as Macdonald's and Visa also coopted lines from the anthem for their advertising campaigns --&gt;

== Trademark enforcement ==

VANOC also began protecting its brand as contractually obligated by the International Olympic Committee and its marketing partners, filing lawsuits against residents attempting to register domain names related to the games, and preventing Vancouver author [[Kari-Lynn Winters]] from portraying the Olympics in a work of fiction.&lt;ref name=ibby&gt;Givens, Cherie (2008).

The [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] also passed laws granting protection for various terms surrounding the games.&lt;ref name="olympicmotto"/&gt;

In June 2009, the Olympics Resistance Network accused the Vancouver 2010 Integrated Security Unit's (VISU) Joint Intelligence Group of "abusive and unlawful conduct" after allegedly harassing VANOC opposition activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympics protesters ask 2010 security to stop 'abusive and unlawful conduct' |first=Lora |last=Grindlay |publisher=The Province |date=June 25, 2009 |url=https://theprovince.com/news/Olympics+protestors+2010+security+stop+abusive+unlawful+conduct/1729031/story.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216181406/http://www.theprovince.com/news/Olympics%2Bprotestors%2B2010%2Bsecurity%2Bstop%2Babusive%2Bunlawful%2Bconduct/1729031/story.html |archivedate=February 16, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns over policing methods have also been raised because of the head of Olympic security, RCMP Asst.

== Foreclosure of Whistler resort owner Intrawest ==

Creditors holding $1.4 billion in debt on Intrawest, the owners of the [[Whistler Blackcomb|Whistler Blackcomb Resort]], were reported on January 20, 2010, as being ready to foreclose on the resort as part of the creditor, investment bank [[Lehman Brothers]], attempting to recover debts owed it by major creditors, including [[Fortress Investment Group|Fortress Investments]], the owner of Intrawest and Whistler Blackcomb since 2006. Despite guarantees from VANOC and the Canadian government of $50 million to keep Intrawest afloat during the Games, there were doubts that the Canadian government would be forthcoming. A private source connected to [[Wesley Edens]], owner of Fortress Investments, has said that Edens may exercise his right in that circumstance to prevent the Games from happening at the resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kosman |first=Josh |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/intrawest_foreclosure_threat_to_15qRjmzgdwLCkGfNdhdwjI |title=''Intrawest foreclosure a threat to Olympics'', Josh Kosman and Mark deCambre, ''New York Post'', January 20, 2010 |publisher=Nypost.com |date=January 20, 2010 |accessdate=February 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; VANOC sources say this is unlikely to happen since the creditors would have no reason to diminish the value of the resort that would be enhanced by hosting a prestige event, and also because of the short time-frame of the impending Games relative to the length of the legal proceedings of any auction of Fortress' assets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2010/01/20/sports/sports-us-olympics-vancouver-intrawest.html?_r=1&amp;scp=6&amp;sq=vancouver&amp;st=cse ''Vancouver Downplays Ski Venue Dispute'', Reuters, January 20, 2010, as published in the ''New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; Fortress is also the company which backed out of the original funding arrangements for the Athletes' Village in Vancouver, and the re-financing of that project by emergency legislation and the involvement of Fortress' subsidiary, Millennium.&lt;ref name="Mackin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bctrialofbasi-virk.blogspot.com"/&gt;

== Failure of ice resurfacers ==

The [[Speed skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Men's 500 metres|men's 500 metres]] speed skating event was delayed for over an hour at the [[Richmond Olympic Oval]] when both [[ice resurfacer]]s experienced mechanical failures and a third ice machine was unable to resurface the ice properly. At least one skater withdrew from the race because of the delay and other racers stated that the delay hurt their race times.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Bonnie, "[http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/speedskating/news/story?id=4917326 Davis withdraws after first run]", ''[[ESPN]]'', February 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ice resurfacers at the games were supplied by Olympia, an official sponsor of the games. The [[Resurfice Corporation|Olympia Celletwi]] model is the first pollution-free, nickel-cadmium, battery-powered ice resurfacer and was selected as a part of the games "green" efforts. Following the failures, a traditional natural gas powered resurfacer built by [[Ice resurfacer|Zamboni]] was brought in from [[Calgary]].

== Ticketing ==

About 28,000 tickets for spectator places along the slopes of a number of outside events were recalled for safety reasons; ticket holders were reimbursed but had difficulty or were not able to gain access to tickets at comparable prices to these events.&lt;ref name=spiegelol&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/wintersport/0,1518,678465,00.html |author=spiegelonline sport |title=Möge das Wirrwarr gewinnen.|language=German |date=February 18, 2010 |accessdate=February 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors were also upset by a twenty dollar charge to attend ceremonies to honor medal-winning athletes.&lt;ref name=spiegelol/&gt; Traditionally, these ceremonies had been free of charge.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Organizers also expressed concern about blocks of VIP tickets going unused leaving conspicuous empty seats at events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://vancouversun.com/Olympic+tickets+going+unused/2572915/story.html |title=VIP Olympic tickets going unused |date=February 15, 2010 |publisher=Vancouver Sun |accessdate=February 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225091633/http://www.vancouversun.com/Olympic%2Btickets%2Bgoing%2Bunused/2572915/story.html |archivedate=February 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Officiating errors ==

Observers and participants reported that several starter errors occurred during the February 16 [[Biathlon at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Men's pursuit|men's biathlon pursuit]]. Competitors [[Jeremy Teela]] and [[Jean-Philippe Leguellec]] were started too early, before racers who were seeded higher than them. Teela stated that the early start threw-off his strategy, contributing to his missing two targets in his first two shooting range stops. Teela said, "We have a couple more races this week. Hopefully the organizers figure this problem out and they make the races fair."&lt;ref name=Error&gt;{{cite news|last=Gustus|first=Lauren|agency=[[Gannett News Service]]|url=http://militarytimes.com/news/2010/02/gns_army_teela_olympics_021610/|title=Starter error frustrates biathletes, guardsman|newspaper=[[Military Times]]|date=February 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starter confusion was also present during the [[Biathlon at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Women's pursuit|women's pursuit]] earlier that day. This time both [[Liudmila Kalinchik]] and [[Anna Carin Olofsson-Zidek]] were held back and had to start several seconds too late. U.S. coach Per Nilsson stated that he had never seen an Olympic biathlon as poorly managed as the February 16 women's race.&lt;ref name=Slot&gt;{{cite news|last=Slot|first=Owen|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/olympics/article7031487.ece|title=The Calamity Games in Vancouver still finding ways to blunder|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=February 18, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Error/&gt;

Norbert Baier, technical delegate for the International Biathlon Union, called it the worst day of his career and took full responsibility, stating that the mistakes were their fault.&lt;ref name="IBU1"/&gt; He also noted that similar incidents have previously occurred on the World Cup circuit in Europe.

== Olympic flame ==

The opening ceremony was stalled while organizers recovered from mechanical problems which prevented the pillars forming the cauldron for the torch lighting from completely rising out of the stadium floor as planned. However this was soon fixed as seen in the Closing Ceremony, where they made a joke out of it. An Engineer Mime climbed out of the stage as if he had just fixed it and he pretended to pull it up. [[Speed skater]] [[Catriona Le May Doan]], who was supposed to have lit the 4th pillar, came out from the floor to finally get the chance to light it.&lt;ref name="mishaps"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/vancouver2010/news/2010/02/15/12883441-sun.html|title=Mishaps plague games|last=MACKIN|first=BOB |date=February 15, 2010|work=Toronto Sun|accessdate=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Own The Podium - 2010 ==

[[Own the Podium|Own the Podium - 2010]], or ''À nous le podium en 2010!'' in French, is a Canadian sport technical program launched in January 2005 to prepare Canada to become the top winter sporting nation in the world by the 2010 Winter Olympics.

=== Indigenous people ===

There is opposition to the Olympics amongst some [[indigenous people]] and their supporters. Although the [[Lil'wat]] branch of the St'at'imc Nation is a co-host of the games, a splinter group from the [[Seton Lake First Nation|Seton]] band known as the St'at'imc of Sutikalh, who have also opposed the Cayoosh Ski Resort, fear the Olympics are bringing unwanted tourism and real estate sales to their territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warriorpublications.com/?q=node/22|title=Sutikalh Re-occupation Camp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/1738 |title=It's all about the Land|publisher=The Dominion}}&lt;/ref&gt; On another front, local aboriginal people as well as Canadian [[Inuit]] expressed concern over the choice of an [[inukshuk]] as the symbol of the Games, with some Inuit leaders such as former [[Nunavut]] Commissioner [[Peter Irniq]] stating that the inukshuk is a culturally important symbol to them. He said that the "Inuit never build inuksuit with head, legs and arms. I have seen inuksuit build [sic] more recently, 100 years maybe by non-Inuit in Nunavut, with head, legs and arms.

=== Protests ===

In 2006, environmental protests at Eagleridge Bluffs in [[West Vancouver]] over the building of a new highway resulted in the arrest of over 20 people, and jail time for two local women, [[Betty Krawczyk]] and [[Harriet Nahanee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police move in to end protest on Bluffs.|date=May 29, 2006|publisher=Vancouver Sun|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=76a51906-0e2f-408e-ba97-ed60f2714c2a&amp;p=1|access-date=February 18, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604124243/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=76a51906-0e2f-408e-ba97-ed60f2714c2a&amp;p=1#|archive-date=June 4, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eagleridgebluffs.ca/ |title=The Coalition to Save Eagleridge Bluffs at Horseshoe Bay |accessdate=March 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harriett Nahanee, an elderly woman, died shortly after incarceration from medical conditions thought to be exacerbated by her time in jail.

As with Vancouver's Expo 86 which led to the displacement of hundreds of residents in the Downtown Eastside area of the city, or Expo 2010 where 18,000 families were displaced from the Shanghai area, the 2010 Olympics had a similar effect of displacing and criminalizing poor communities, while corporate sponsors of the 'games' made billions and billions of dollars of profit at the expense of peoples' lives and homes.&lt;ref&gt;https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/expo-86-when-vancouver-wooed-the-world-30-photos-30-years-later&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cosplay Mania''' is an annual [[cosplay]]-centered convention usually held in the final quarter of the year in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="Event Info"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cosplay.ph/microsites/cosmania/wp/event-info/ | title = Cosplay Mania Event Information | publisher = Cosplay Mania | accessdate = 2011-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention features various events related to [[cosplay]] and features rookie and veteran cosplayers, costumers and cosplay enthusiasts.  Below are the mainstay activities, some of them unique to the event:

* '''Solo and Group Cosplay''' - this activity provides a competitive venue for cosplayers. The competition welcomes cosplayers from Anime / Manga / Games / Comics / Movies / Western Animation genres.  Rules normally vary per year regarding age limitations, genre, or in the case of group cosplay, the number of members involved.
*
* '''Meet and Greet''' - Con-goers are given the opportunity to meet the event's invited International Cosplayer Guests as well as popular artists from Japan and other countries.
*
* '''JAM (Japanese Anime Music) Concert''' - introduced in 2014, it is a concert where invited artists and musically-inclined cosplayer guests perform Japanese-inspired songs.
*
* '''Cosplay TORCH (Tournament of Champions)''' - introduced in 2010, it is a national cosplay competition where tournament legs are held in selected major cities in the Philippines.  Usually held in [[SM Supermalls]], it is a pair competition with winners of each leg taking the finals at the Cosplay Mania event.  In the 2011 Tournament, the winning pair will become the official Philippine representatives to join the [[Anime Festival Asia]] convention's Regional Cosplay Championship in Singapore.

Cosplay Mania is created and hosted by Cosplay.ph,&lt;ref name="Website Info"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cosplay.ph/faq.php?cat_id=2 | title = About Cosplay.ph | publisher = Cosplay.ph | accessdate = 2011-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Philippine-based cosplay website and organization.

==History==

===2008===
The first event was held in Megatrade Hall 3 in [[SM Megamall]], Mandaluyong City on October 12, 2008.  Its theme was "Plan... Build... Cosplay!" which revolved around three main activities: Workshops, Costume Building Contest and the Cosplay competition for individual and group.&lt;ref name="Cosplay Mania 2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cosplay.ph/microsites/cosmania/wp/2008/09/30/687/ | title = Cosplay Mania 2008 Press Release | publisher = Cosplay.ph | accessdate = 2011-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable cosplayer Jin Joson and her group the Tux Team&lt;ref name="Jin Joson Behindinfinity"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://behindinfinity.deviantart.com/ | title = Behindinfinity DeviantArt | publisher = Deviantart.com | accessdate = 2011-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; were invited to be part of the workshop tutorials as well as judge for the cosplay competition.&lt;ref name="Behindinfinity Journal"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://behindinfinity.deviantart.com/journal/21210359/ | title = Cosmania 2008 Report | publisher = Deviantart.com | accessdate = 2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009===
With the theme "Bigger and Better", the event incorporated both Megatrade Hall 2 and 3 and opened on September 13, 2009.  Introduced the Cosplay Museum exhibit as well as the Mech Cafe.&lt;ref name="Mech Cafe"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cosplay.ph/microsites/cosmania/wp/2009/09/05/mecha-maids-and-mayhem-at-the-cosplay-mania-2009-mech-cafe/ | title = Mecha, Maids, and Mayhem at the Cosplay Mania 2009 Mech Cafe! | publisher = Cosplay.ph | accessdate = 2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This event introduced the inclusion of an onstage LED [[Video wall]] backdrop to help enhance the catwalk experience of cosplayers joining Project Cosplay as well as giving those competing in the group cosplay category the option to use digital visual effects to augment their performances.

===2010===
Cosplay Mania 2010 marked the year where a few major event changes were made.  First was the move to a new location, from SM Megamall in Mandaluyong City, to [[SMX Convention Center]] beside [[SM Mall of Asia]] in Pasay City.  The second is having the event as two days instead of just one, October 2 to 3.  The last was the change of their title brand from calendar year 2010 to Roman number X, which became the reoccurring promotional symbol to represent the move to SMX Convention Center as well as the event's theme of "A Decade of Cosplay", where the event celebrated 10 years of cosplaying in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="10 years of cosplay"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zenhonbuph.net/2010/10/cosplay-mania-celebrates-10-years-of-philippine-cosplay/ | title = Cosplay Mania celebrates 10 years of Philippine cosplay | publisher = zenhonbuph.net | accessdate = 2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This also introduced the first nationwide cosplay competition called the Cosplay Tournament of Champions (TORCH), where winners of tournament legs from SM Cagayan De Oro, SM Clark, SM Davao, SM Cebu, SM Davao and SM Manila converge for the finals at SMX Convention Center.

The event also invited International Cosplayer guests Clive Lee and Jesuke of Singapore to be part of the celebration and become part of the judges panel for Project Cosplay and TORCH.&lt;ref name="Tournament of Champions (TORCH)"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cosplay.ph/microsites/cosmania/wp/2010/09/14/international-guests-to-grace-cosplay-mania-x/ | title = International guests to grace Cosplay Mania X | publisher = Cosplay.ph | accessdate = 2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also introduced a cosplay-centric activity called Cosplay Checkmate,&lt;ref name="Cosplay Checkmate"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cosplay.ph/microsites/cosmania/wp/2011/08/25/team-cosplay-checkmate/ | title = Cosplay Checkmate | publisher = Cosplay.ph | accessdate = 2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; a variation of [[Human Chess]] where participants in costumes play chess pieces in a life-size chess board, but would act out in character in a choreographed fight scene when the pieces interact.  This version however has no Knight pieces.

===2011===
The event's theme was "Epic" due to its major changes in its format.  It was still held [[SMX Convention Center]] beside SM Mall of Asia in Pasay City on October 1 and 2 but has now occupied 3 function rooms, namely Function Room 3, 4 and 5, making the floor area a total of over 5,200 square meters.  The floor plan was changed to a new format, separating into the Stage Area at Function Room 5 where the bands and cosplay activities are held, the Fiesta Hall at Function Room 4 where dealers/sellers are located, and Function Room 3 as an open hall for visitors to socialize.  The Stage and Fiesta hall has entrance fees while the open hall is free for all.

The event held its first ticketing system that involved distribution through SM Ticketing services that made pre-selling of tickets available in all [[SM Supermalls]] nationwide.  This was in response to the long lines that plagued its past events when ticket sales were sold on the day itself.&lt;ref name="Cosplay Mania X Event Report"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://magnetic-rose.net/2010/10/cosplay-mania-x-day-1-event-report/ | title = ''Cosplay Mania X boasts of a record-breaking headcount, with a line that stretched almost an entire city block.'' Cosplay Mania X Day 1 Event Report | publisher = magnetic-rose.net | accessdate = 2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This year's event introduced its first partnership with [[Anime Festival Asia]] where the winning pair of Cosplay Mania's Cosplay second Tournament of Champions (TORCH II) will become the official Philippine representatives to join AFA's Regional Cosplay Competition, performing against other cosplay teams from Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore.&lt;ref name="TORCH II"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/life-and-times/6210-an-epic-in-disguise | title = An epic in disguise | publisher = manilatimes.net | accessdate = 2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine Team, represented by Amado Carl Hernandez (AC) and Zhel, won this year's AFA's Regional Cosplay Competition.&lt;ref name="TORCH II Winners"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20111114-310547.html | title = Asia crowns its best cosplayers | publisher = asiaone.com | accessdate = 2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event also invited International Cosplayer Guests Pinky Lu Xun of Indonesia, YukiGodbless and JiakiDarkness of Thailand, and returning guest Clive Lee of Singapore, all of whom became judges for the event's TORCH, Project Cosplay and Costume Building Contest.&lt;ref name="Special Guests"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cosplay.ph/microsites/cosmania/wp/category/guests-and-exhibitors/special-guests/ | title = Cosplay Mania 2011 Special Guests | publisher = Cosplay.ph | accessdate = 2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosplay Mania also hosted Cosplay Appreciation Day, where cosplayers are invited to register upon entering Function Room 3, in an attempt to set a Guinness World Record of the number of cosplayers attending an event.&lt;ref name="Cosplay Appreciation Day"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cosplay.ph/microsites/cosmania/wp/2011/08/25/philippine-cosplay-appreciation-day/ | title = Philippine Cosplay Appreciation Day | publisher = Cosplay.ph | accessdate = 2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable international partnerships that graced the event included [[Bandai]], [[Gunpla]] Japan, [[Crypton Future Media]] and CosplayGen.

===2012===
This year's event is still held at [[SMX Convention Center]] beside SM Mall of Asia in Pasay City, but with the dates moved to September 29 and 30, occupying Function Room 3, 4 and 5.  The floor plan also retained last year's format, separating into the Stage Area at Function Room 5 and the Dealer Area at Function Room 4, both as paying areas.  Function Room 3 is still assigned as a free hall.

The event will again host the finals of the Cosplay Tournament of Champions (TORCH) where the winning pair will represent the Philippines in Anime Festival Asia's (AFA) Regional Cosplay Competition in Singapore.

This year's roster of invited International Cosplayer Guests include renowned Japanese cosplayers KANAME☆&lt;ref name="International Cosplay Guest Kaname"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cosplay.ph/microsites/cosmania/wp/?p=142 | title = International Cosplay Guest Kaname | publisher = Cosplay.ph | accessdate = 2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Reika&lt;ref name="International Cosplay Guest Reika"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cosplay.ph/microsites/cosmania/wp/?p=483 | title = International Cosplay Guest Reika | publisher = Cosplay.ph | accessdate = 2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as returning Singaporean guest cosplayer Jesuke.  A Premium Pass was introduced that would give visitors the opportunity to attend Kaname and Reika's Meet and Greet closed-door activities. The limited sales of the passes is separate from the regular convention ticket sales.

Cosplay Mania will again host Cosplay Appreciation Day, where cosplayers are invited to register upon entering Function Room 3, to again attempt to set the Guinness World Record of the number of cosplayers attending an event.

New activities are being introduced in this year's event: 
* '''SM Cyberzone Cosplay Grand Prix''' - a partner event of TORCH where only gaming character cosplays are allowed to compete.
* '''Cosplay Checkers''' - replacing the Cosplay Chess but retaining the cosplay concept.
* '''Cosplay Videos Caught on Tape''' - contest where cosplayers submit their best videos of themselves.
* '''4Koma Contest''' - cosplayers submit four-panel comics using their cosplay photographs.  The format is based on a popular type of [[Manga]] called a [[Yonkoma]].
* '''Guest Meet and Greet''' - an activity where one can meet Kaname or Reika in person through a limited sale of Premium Passes.  The activity includes a handshake, autograph signing and a photo opportunity given to each Premium Pass attendee, as well as freebies.  Each Meet and Greet Guest is assigned a scheduled day, with Reika on September 29 and Kaname on September 30.
* '''Photobomb Contest''' - a stage activity where pre-selected groups of con-goers would try to block each other's faces from being shown prominently in the photograph taken from a digital camera setup off-stage.  
* '''Facepalm-the-Music''' - two pre-selected contestants try to be the first to guess the title of the music played onstage.  What makes this different from other music-guessing games is that the "buzzer" is a person (an official event volunteer who is fully aware of the nature of the game) where the contestants have to be the first to "tap the buzzer" by palming the volunteer's face as soon as they recognize the music.  The human buzzer then points to the contestant who they believe tapped them first.

With the event theme "Overdrive", this year's event is still held at [[SMX Convention Center]] beside SM Mall of Asia in Pasay City, on October 5 and 6, occupying Function Room 3, 4 and 5.  The floor plan also retained last year's format, separating into the Stage Area at Function Room 5 and the Dealer Area at Function Room 4, both as paying areas.  Function Room 3 is still assigned as a free hall.

The event will again host the finals of the''' Cosplay Tournament of Champions (TORCH)''' where the winning pair will represent the Philippines in Anime Festival Asia's (AFA) Regional Cosplay Competition in Singapore.

'''Cosplay Mania '13 Guests'''

This year marked the event's most number of guests invited, with 10 guests featuring Jesuke, Vic, Starpolaris Reiko and Viospace from Singapore, Pinky, Orochi and Shinji (Endless Illution) from Indonesia, and returning Japanese cosplayers guests KANAME☆ and Reika, with a new guest Goldy Marg, a well-known mecha and armor cosplayer from Japan.  All of them were introduced weekly in a series of Guest Reveals presented on Cosplay Mania's Facebook page.

The '''Meet and Greet Premium Pass''' were available to KANAME☆, Reika and Goldy with a limited sales of 100 passes per guest is separate from the regular convention ticket sales.

This year introduces the application of '''Cosplay.ph's CRS, or Cosplay Ranking System''', where cosplayers who will join the event's contests are required to apply.  This system would help designate the beginner and veteran ranking as to improve fairness in Cosplay.ph held competitions.

Returning activities are being introduced again this year: 
* '''SM Cyberzone Cosplay Grand Prix''' - a partner event of TORCH where only gaming character cosplays are allowed to compete.
* '''4Koma Contest''' - cosplayers submit four-panel comics using their cosplay photographs.  The format is based on a popular type of [[Manga]] called a [[Yonkoma]].
* '''Guest Meet and Greet''' - an activity where one can meet Kaname, Reika and Goldy in person through a limited sale of Premium Passes.  
* '''Facepalm-the-Music''' - two pre-selected contestants try to be the first to guess the title of the music played onstage. 
New activities being introduced this year:
* '''Cosplay Solo Showdown''' - improving the '''Project Cosplay Solo contest''', the contestants are separated through the '''Cosplay Division Classification (CDC)''', designed to address this problem by creating classifications or Classes that can be used to define distinct Cosplay Divisions. There are five Classes that are based on competitor age and costume composition: Junior, Agility, Hybrid, Assault and Titan. This new system addresses the issue of classifying cosplayers' costumes through source material (e.g. cloth cosplay versus armor cosplay), which was often difficult of materials are often equally mixed.  The CDC will be used to organize competitors in respective groups for the purposes of organization, order of appearance on-stage and/or to determine special awards.
* '''Head to Head LIVE''' - Cosplay.ph's The Cosplay Show introduced an on-the-spot helmet making contest, which is now being introduced as an event activity.  It is sponsored by '''High Sierra'''.
* '''Early Bird Raffle''' - attendees who bought their tickets before the event are entitled to a raffle, prizes which includes a BROTHER Printer and Sony PSP's

'''New Mascot'''

Cosplay Mania also introduced their new mascot '''Cosima Karin''' that would represent the event's fun-loving ambiance and cosplay-centric atmosphere.  She is accompanied by '''DotPeach''', the official mascot of '''Cosplay.ph''', the company behind the convention and who had long since represented the event.

Ten guests were invited, with returning guests featuring Jesuke Jes and Vic Kumiko from Singapore, Pinky Lu Xun from Indonesia, Orochi X from Australia and Japanese cosplayers guests KANAME☆ and Reika.

Inui Tatsumi will be partnered with Orochi X to share one session together, while Vampy's two sessions will be accompanied with Jesuke and Pinky respectively.

'''Cosplay Mania JAM Concert'''

As part of the evolution theme, the event introduced '''JAM (Japanese Anime Music)''', a two-day concert held at Function Room 5 which starts at 7pm.  The concert featured Japanese singer [[Aya Ikeda]], who sang songs from the anime [[Pretty Cure]], and '''Loverin Tamburin''', a band that covers a variety of anime songs but best known for "Aishitageru" (愛したげる), the opening song for the anime [[Makai Senki Disgaea]]. The concert will also be accompanied by local anime cover band '''Moonspeak''' and '''Ninja Tuna'''.  Japanese cosplayers KANAME☆ and Reika will be having collaborative singing performance with Moonspeak.  It should be noted that this would be KANAME☆'s first ever singing performance in a convention.

Aya Ikeda also had her own Meet and Greet session prior to the concert, but also held her own handshake and merchandise selling session after her performance on Cosplay Mania JAM Day 2. Loverin Tamburin also initiated their own Meet and Greet but free of charge, giving away free posters for signing as well as the selling of their music CD's.

The "'''Druid's Prayer'''" ({{lang-cy|Gweddi'r Derwydd}}) or "'''Gorsedd Prayer'''" (''Gweddi'r Orsedd'') is a [[prayer]] composed by [[Iolo Morganwg]] which is still a staple in the ritual of both [[gorsedd]]au and [[Neo-Druidism]]. Neo-Druids sometimes substitute the words ''y Dduwies'' ("the Goddess") for the original ''Duw'' ("God").

==Versions in ''Barddas''==
In the volume ''Barddas'' by Iolo Morganwg (edited and compiled by Reverend [[John Williams (archdeacon)|John Williams]] ''ab Ithel''), there are six versions of the Gorsedd Prayer, both in Iolo's original [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and in [[English language|English]] translation (the word gwynvyd, roughly corresponding to "heaven" is left untranslated).

===Version One===
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}

'''Llyma Weddi'r Orsedd, a elwir Gweddi'r Gwyddoniaid (O Lyfr Mawr Margam)'''&lt;br /&gt;
Duw dy nerth, ag yn nerth Dioddef;&lt;br /&gt;
A dioddef dros y gwir, ag yn y gwir pob goleuni;&lt;br /&gt;
Ag yngoleuni pob Gwynfyd, ag yngwynfyd Cariad,&lt;br /&gt;
Ag ynghariad Duw, ag yn Duw pob daioni.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Rev. John: ''Barddas'' p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-2}}

'''The Gorsedd Prayer, called the Prayer of the Gwyddoniaid (From the Great Book of Margam)'''&lt;br /&gt;
God, impart Thy strength;&lt;br /&gt;
And in strength, power to suffer;&lt;br /&gt;
And to suffer for the truth;&lt;br /&gt;
And in the truth, all light;&lt;br /&gt;
And in light, gwynvyd;&lt;br /&gt;
And in gwynfyd, love;&lt;br /&gt;
And in love, God;&lt;br /&gt;
And in God, all goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Rev. John: ''Barddas''  p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;
{{col-end}}

===Version Two===
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}

'''Llyma weddi'r Orsedd o Lyfr Trehaearn Brydydd Mawr'''&lt;br /&gt;
Dyro Dduw dy Nawdd;&lt;br /&gt;
Ag yn Nawdd, Pwyll;&lt;br /&gt;
Ag ymhwyll, Goleuni;&lt;br /&gt;
Ag yngoleuni, Gwirionedd;&lt;br /&gt;
Ag yngwirionedd, Cyfiawnder;&lt;br /&gt;
Ag ynghyfiawnder, Cariad;&lt;br /&gt;
Ag ynghariad, Cariad Duw;&lt;br /&gt;
Ag ynghariad Duw, pob Gwynfyd.
::::Duw a phob Daioni.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Rev. John: ''Barddas''  pp. 360-362&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-2}}

'''The Gorsedd Prayer, from the Book of Trahaiarn the Great Poet'''&lt;br /&gt;
Grant, God, Thy protection;&lt;br /&gt;
And in protection, reason;&lt;br /&gt;
And in reason, light;&lt;br /&gt;
And in light, truth;&lt;br /&gt;
And in truth, justice;&lt;br /&gt;
And in justice, love;&lt;br /&gt;
And in love, the love of God;&lt;br /&gt;
And in the love of God, gwynfyd.&lt;br /&gt;
::::God and all goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Rev. John: ''Barddas''  pp. 361-363&lt;/ref&gt;
{{col-end}}

===Version Three===
The below version is that usually adopted by various druidic groups, notably the ''Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids'' (OBOD) albeit in a different fashion.

{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}

'''Llyma weddi'r orsedd o Lyfr arall'''&lt;br /&gt;
Dyro Dduw dy Nawdd;&lt;br /&gt;
Ag yn nawdd, nerth;&lt;br /&gt;
Ag yn nerth, Deall;&lt;br /&gt;
Ag yn Neall, Gwybod;&lt;br /&gt;
Ac yngwybod, gwybod y cyfiawn;&lt;br /&gt;
Ag yngwybod yn cyfiawn, ei garu;&lt;br /&gt;
Ag o garu, caru pob hanfod;&lt;br /&gt;
Ag ymhob Hanfod, caru Duw.&lt;br /&gt;
::::Duw a phob Daioni.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Rev. John: ''Barddas''  p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-2}}

'''The Gorsedd Prayer, from another Book'''&lt;br /&gt;
Grant, O God, Thy protection;&lt;br /&gt;
And in protection, strength;&lt;br /&gt;
And in strength, understanding;&lt;br /&gt;
And in understanding, knowledge;&lt;br /&gt;
And in knowledge, the knowledge of justice;&lt;br /&gt;
And in the knowledge of justice, the love of it;&lt;br /&gt;
And in that love, the love of all existences;&lt;br /&gt;
And in the love of all existences, the love of God.&lt;br /&gt;
::::::God and all goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Rev. John: ''Barddas''  p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Christian''' (3 March 1758 &amp;ndash; 29 March 1823) was an English judge and law professor. He was the older brother of [[Fletcher Christian]], leader of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]].

==Life==
Edward Christian was one of the three sons of Charles Christian of Moorland Close and of the large [[Ewanrigg|Ewanrigg Hall]] estate in [[Dearham]], Cumberland, an [[attorney-at-law]] descended from [[Manx people|Manx]] gentry, and his wife Ann Dixon.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn Christian, ''Fragile Paradise: The discovery of Fletcher Christian, Bounty mutineer''; 2nd ed. (U.S.A.: Bounty Books, 2005), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p11907.htm#i119066 Charles Christian] at thepeerage.com, accessed 28 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles's marriage to Ann brought with it the small property of Moorland Close, "a quadrangle pile of buildings ... half castle, half farmstead."&lt;ref name=Alexander60&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bounty |author=Anderson |pages=60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles died in 1768 and Edward's mother Ann proved herself irresponsible with money. By 1779, Ann had run up a debt of nearly £6,500 (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|6500|1779}}}} today),&lt;ref name=Alexander60 /&gt; and faced the prospect of [[debtors' prison]]. Moorland Close was lost and Ann and her younger children were forced to flee to the Isle of Man, where English creditors had no power. The three elder Christian sons managed to arrange a £40 (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|40|1779}}}} today) per year annuity for their mother, allowing the family to live in genteel poverty.  His mother Ann died on the Isle of Man in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Captain Bligh and Mister Christian |author=Hough |page=56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian attended [[St Bees School]] and went up to [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]] in 1775, but migrated to [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] in 1777, graduating as third [[wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]] in 1779.&lt;ref name=Venn&gt;{{acad|id=CHRN775E|name=Christian, Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While at Cambridge he forged a friendship with [[William Wilberforce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Hague| first = William| authorlink = William Hague| title = William Wilberforce: The Life of the Great Anti-Slave Trade Campaigner| publisher = [[Harper Perennial]]| year = 2008| isbn = 978-0-00-722886-7 |page = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted to [[Gray's Inn]] on 5 July 1782.&lt;ref name="Christian family history"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.thepeerage.com/p11907.htm#i119070|title= Christian family history |accessdate=28 December 2008 |work=thepeerage.com |date= 7 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1788 Christian was appointed [[Downing Professor of the Laws of England]], although the chair was only founded along with [[Downing College, Cambridge|Downing College]] in 1800. He held the professorship in conjunction with a fellowship of Downing until his death in 1823. He was also law professor at the [[East India Company College]] from 1806 to 1818.&lt;ref name=Venn /&gt;&lt;ref name="Christian family history"/&gt;

Christian was Chief Justice of the [[Isle of Ely]] and was one of the presiding judges at the [[Ely and Littleport riots 1816|Ely and Littleport riot]] Special Commission assizes at [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Warren|first=Philip|title=Report of the trials for rioting at Ely and Littleport 1816:Originally printed c.1816 by Hatfield and Twigg, England|year=1997|page=1|publisher=Philip Warren|isbn=0-9531530-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
In 1794, Stephen Barney, counsel to the mutineer [[William Muspratt]], at the urging of Edward Christian, published his version of the ''Minutes of the Bounty [[Court-Martial]]'', and included an ''Appendix'' written by Edward Christian. In it, Edward did not try to excuse his brother Fletcher's conduct, but citing his interviews with several of the people involved (none directly), and listing the names and addresses of several prominent people as witnesses to these interviews, he recounted several of the excesses of [[William Bligh]], Commander of the Bounty. At the time of the publication of the ''Minutes'' and ''Appendix'', the public's only published source of information about the mutiny were Bligh's own ''A Narrative of the Mutiny on the Bounty'', published in 1790, and ''A Voyage to the South Sea'', published in 1792. With the publication of the ''Appendix'', the tide of public opinion began to turn against Bligh. Indeed, Bligh responded by publishing ''An Answer to Certain Assertions Contained in The Appendix to a Pamphlet, entitled...'' etc., etc., to which, Edward Christian promptly published ''A Short Reply to Capt. William Bligh's Answer'', which only served to fan the flames.

The process was aided by the efforts of the family of [[Peter Heywood]], a midshipman on the ''Bounty'', and others, but many attribute the source of William Bligh's bad reputation, to this day, to Edward Christian's ''Appendix''. It is believed by many that Edward Christian's impetus for both the ''Minutes'' and the ''Appendix'', were a letter from, and a subsequent meeting with, Peter Heywood, after the latter's pardon.

'''''Equivocation''''', written by [[Bill Cain]], is a play about telling the truth in difficult times. It proposes the question: what if the government commissioned [[William Shakespeare]] (known as Shagspeare in the play) to write the definitive history of a national crisis, the [[Gunpowder Plot]], as one of his plays.

==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
London. 1605. A room. Sir [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] has called for Master William Shagspeare (Shag for short) to commission a play for King James. After reading what it is he should write about, Shag quickly rejects the offer, but is overpowered by Cecil and is forced to take the commission. The scene suddenly turns into one of Shag's plays as actors (Nate, Armin, Richard, and Sharpe) come out performing a scene from ''King Lear'', which Sharpe claims is unplayable. Shag breaks up the argument and tells them how Cecil called upon him, and how he has been commissioned to write a true history of the Gunpowder Plot. Shag tells them he's wary, since current events have never been done on the stage, but his actors claim he's "the man for the job". With that, Shag begins to write.

Enter Judith, Shag's daughter, who looks at the darker aspects of life. After asking him how many people he's killed off in his new play, she gives him clothing to go change into. There is obvious tension between the two. While Shag changes off stage, Judith gives a soliloquy to the audience about how she hates both plays and soliloquies. Shag reenters, scolding her for messing with his work. Shag asks Judith how her twin brother is doing, and she reminds him that her brother is dead. She tells him to ask about her, in which he replies, "You're always the same." When Judith exits Shag's work comes to life. A scene unfolds, in Shakespearean tongue, of three conspirators (played by Nate, Richard, and Sharpe) meeting with the Jesuit priest [[Henry Garnet]] (played by Armin) about how they plan on blowing up Parliament. After playing out the whole scene all the actors and Shag, with the exception of Sharpe, agree that it just doesn't work. Sharpe then suggests that they change the ending and blow up Parliament, and is immediately berated by Richard about how it is a terrible idea to put on a play about blowing up a king in the presence of the king. Nate and Armin mention how they don't understand how thirteen gentlemen could go about digging a tunnel under Parliament without getting caught, which gets Shag thinking.

Shag makes a trip back to see Cecil, who is annoyed that Shag has yet to finish the play. Shag tells Cecil he wants to know about the dirt ("Dirt? What dirt?"), which Cecil refuses to tell him of. After arguing some more, Shag tells Cecil how there is (in the story) no plot, to which Cecil, outraged, replies, "It is treason to say so!" When Shag says how he was just giving literary criticism, Cecil realizes his misunderstanding and acts like he said nothing. Shag also apologizes to Cecil for portraying Cecil's father as Polonius in Hamlet. He then asks to interview [[Thomas Wintour]], a conspirator in the Gunpowder Plot. Cecil agrees.
The next scene unfolds to show Wintour being suspended, with guards telling him how exactly he's going to be executed. Shag meets with Wintour, who at first refuses to speak with him. Shag is about to leave but when he sees how Wintour can't even write a letter to his wife because his hands are so damaged, Shag agrees to write Wintour's wife a letter if Wintour helps him. Wintour tells Shag of how Robert Catesby called a meeting to first start the plot. Catesby tells Wintour how Cecil gave him the gunpowder, supposedly for a military expedition on the continent. He also tells him of a room underneath Parliament where the deed can be done. Astonished, Shag asks Wintour about Garnet's role in this. Wintour informs him how Garnet was never in on the plan. Wintour, Catesby, and the other conspirators turn back into Shag's actors, who are just as astonished by the new play as Shag is. Richard tells them they can't do the show because it is far too dangerous to perform, but Shag insists. Richard realizes why Shag wants to do this so badly and tells Shag, "Helping someone else's son won't bring back yours."

Cecil then arrives at the Globe, wanting a word with Shag. He tells Shag how he has gotten his hands on a copy of the new script and does not deem it worthy to be performed. When Shag asks how he got a copy, Cecil insinuates there might be one or more moles in his theatre company. He then takes the letter Wintour wrote to his wife away from Shag. Wintour's execution is announced. Shag begs for them to let him live, but Cecil will not comply. Wintour recites a poem before being hung, and then is cut down (while he is still alive), cut open, and then has his head cut off. At the final moments of the first act Cecil says, "Behold! The head of a traitor!" and holds up Wintour's severed head. Suddenly, the eyes of Wintour open and he whispers, "Thou liest." Blackout.

===Act 2===
The second act starts in a courtroom at the trial of the Jesuit priest, [[Henry Garnet]]. Prosecutor [[Edward Coke]] asks Garnet if he knew the conspirators of the plot, which he denies, but he then affirms knowing [[Robert Catesby]], Thomas Wintour, and all of the other accused except [[Guy Fawkes]], explaining that he did not know them as conspirators. When Cecil challenges him to answer using plain "yes" and "no", he tells of a hypothetical scenario in which the King was seeking shelter from the Spanish in Coke's house, asking whether he would tell the Spanish the King was inside—betray the King or deliberately lie. Coke, trapped by Garnet's words, ends the trial and orders that Garnet be removed to his cell.

Later, Shag comes to Garnet's cell disguised as a jailor, which Garnet quickly sees through. He tells Garnet he has come to learn to equivocate—to tell the truth in his play without getting caught at it. Garnet gives him the same hypothetical scenario and asks him what the Spanish are ''really'' asking, but Shag can't figure it out.

==Productions==

The play was first produced at the [[Oregon Shakespeare Festival]] in Ashland, Oregon. It premiered April 15, 2009, and closed on October 31, 2009.

[[Seattle Repertory Theatre]] in partnership with [[Oregon Shakespeare Festival]] presented the play in Seattle from 18 November through 13 December 2009.

[[Garry Hynes]] directed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/theater/reviews/03equivocation.html|title=If He Can, Above all, To His Own Self Be True|date=March 3, 2010|work=New York Times|author=Charles Isherwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was produced by Circa Theatre, Wellington, New Zealand where it ran from 24 May to 21 June 2014. At the time the Sheila Winn National Shakespeare competition was being held, and student groups attending or competing were encouraged to attend the performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circa.co.nz/site/Shows/Equivocation Equivocation] at Circa.co.nz&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been produced at [[Bard on the Beach|Bard on the Beach Shakespeare Festival]] in Vancouver, Canada – being performed for a fixed run from July 2, 2014 to September 27, 2014.

The play was part of the 2014 season at Will Geer's [[Theatricum Botanicum]] in Topanga, California, with Ted Barton, Alan Blumenfeld, Dane Oliver, Franc Ross, Taylor Jackson Ross, and Paul Turbiak in Mike Peebler's production hailed by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as a "Critics' Choice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-equivocation-at-will-geers-theatricum-botanicum-20140909-story.html|title=An inventive, lively 'Equivocation' at Theatricum Botanicum|date=September 9, 2014|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was produced as part of the 2015 season at the Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey, directed by Paul Mullins. Cast included James Michael Reilly (Shag), Rob Krakovski (Richard/Garnet), Kevin Isola (Armin and others), Matthew Stucky (Sharpe/Tom Wintour/James), Dominic Comperatore (Nate/Cecil), and Therese Barbato (Judith). &lt;ref&gt;http://shakespearenj.org/OnStage/current/Equivocation/Equivocation_cast.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breaking up the roles==

''Equivocation'', though it has many roles, was never intended to have a large cast. The intention was always to have six actors. Because of this, four of the six actors are meant to carry the weight of the show by taking on ten or more roles each.

* [[Anthony Heald]] – William Shagspeare
* Christine Albright – [[Judith Quiney|Judith]], Shag's daughter
* Jonathan Haugen – Nate/Cecil/Ensemble
* Richard Elmore – Richard/Henry Garnet/Ensemble
* John Tufts – Sharpe/Thomas Wintour/King James/Ensemble
* Gregory Linington – Armin, the script keeper/Sir Edward Coke/Robert Catesby/Ensemble

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33590">The occupants of the [[Channel Islands]] became involved in European events of 1938–39 only as distant and worried listeners to the radio and readers of newspapers. The declaration of War by Britain on 3 September 1939 increased the concern. However, life in the islands continued much as normal. By spring 1940 the islands were advertising themselves as holiday destinations.

On 10 May 1940, the [[Phoney War ]] ended and Belgium and the Netherlands were invaded. Little did the islanders imagine their homes would be under German occupation for five years, before liberation on 9 May 1945.

When it became clear that the [[Battle of France]] was lost, time was limited for anyone to evacuate, even so 25,000 people went to England, roughly 17,000 from [[Guernsey]],&lt;ref name=HH/&gt; 6,000 from [[Jersey]] and 2,000 from [[Alderney]] in the ten days before the German troops landed at the end of June 1940. Most civilians who were evacuated went to England.

== Volunteers and early evacuees ==
The [[National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939]] passed on 3 September 1939 enforced full conscription on all males between 18 and 41, however it only applied to the United Kingdom and had no effect in the independent Channel Islands. A number of men, especially those who had served in the [[Royal Guernsey Militia]] or the [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey]] as well as men who had been in the [[Officers' Training Corps]] at [[Victoria College, Jersey]] and [[Elizabeth College, Guernsey]] travelled to England, volunteered and were swiftly taken into the armed services, the Jersey militia men leaving as an organised unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lempriére |first=Raoul |title=History of the Channel Islands |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd |ISBN=978-0709142522}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|217}}

By mid May 1940 the news was not good; Germans were fighting in France and individuals as well as whole families were making plans and taking the ferry to England. Even so, holidaymakers were still coming to the islands. By the beginning of June, the [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuation of Dunkirk]] was the main topic of conversation, resulting in more people considering leaving the Channel Islands. Paris surrendered without a fight on 14 June.

Not knowing that on 15 June the British Army commanders had decided the Channel Islands were not defensible, the islanders were surprised to see the resident army units quickly depart on ships, with all of their equipment, the islands were being abandoned.&lt;ref name="PTAPO"&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Tabb |title=A peculiar occupation |publisher=Ian Allan Publishing |isbn=978-0-7110-3113-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50}} The "Channel Islands had been demilitarised and declared...

== June 1940 evacuees ==

=== School children ===
On 19 June the Guernsey local paper published announcements that plans were well in hand to evacuate all the children from the island, telling parents to go to their schools that evening to register and to prepare to send the children away the next day.&lt;ref name="DL"&gt;{{cite book |first=Derek |last=Laine |title=Experiences of a world war II Guernsey evacuee in Cheshire |publisher=Betley local history (2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} Some schools asking that the child and their suitcase be brought so it could be checked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strappini |first=Richard |title=St Martin, Guernsey, Channel Islands, a parish history from 1204 |date=2004 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers were told they were expected to travel with their children bringing assistants to help, mothers volunteered.

Some schools decided to relocate in total whereas others had their children scattered amongst local schools all over England, Scotland and Wales. 5,000 schoolchildren evacuated from Guernsey and 1,000 stayed with 12 teachers.&lt;ref name="RLE"&gt;{{cite book |first=Roy |last=Lowe |title=Education and the Second World War: Studies in Schooling and Social Change |publisher=Routledge, 2012 |isbn=978-1-136-59015-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|193}} Amongst those who stayed were a number from the Castel school, who through a misunderstanding about the boat departure time, missed the sailing.&lt;ref name="PG90"&gt;{{cite book |last=Girard |first=Peter |title=More of Peter Girard's Guernsey: A Second Miscellany of Guernsey's History and Its People |publisher=Guernsey Press |ISBN=978-0902550421 |date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|158}}

In Jersey there was no instruction to schools, people could decide themselves if they, or their children, should evacuate. Only 1,000 evacuated with 67 teachers, many travelling with their parents, the remaining 4,500 would remain for the occupation with 140 teachers.&lt;ref name=RLE/&gt;{{rp|193}}

=== Other evacuees ===
Mothers with children below school age were authorised to go on the first ships, as were men of military age.&lt;ref name=DL/&gt;{{rp|41}}

In Jersey, where the school children were on two weeks holiday to help with the potato harvest, everyone who wished to leave was asked to register, queues quickly appeared, with 23,000 eventually registering.&lt;ref name=SHCII/&gt;{{rp|81}} The civil service could not cope and scared of potential riots with desperate people trying to get on ships, announcements that it was best to stay in the island resulted in only about 1,000 Jersey children being evacuated with their parents and 67 teachers.

As soon as the majority of the first wave had departed, ships were made available for anyone else who wished to depart, however with the fear of ships being mobbed, riots amongst travellers and in the empty towns, with looting of empty houses and shops, as had happened in France on the Channel coast, the authorities pushed the message that 'staying was best', with posters saying “Don’t be yellow, stay at home”,&lt;ref name="MleP"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Le Page |title=A Boy Messenger's War: Memories of Guernsey and Herm 1938-45 |publisher=Arden Publications (1995) |isbn=978-0-9525438-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} (the "patriot" responsible for this poster fled to England).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Chapman |title=Chapel and Swastika: Methodism in the Channel Islands During the German Occupation 1940-1945 |publisher=ELSP |ISBN=978-1906641085}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}} This led to confusion and disorder, especially in Jersey where the authorities did not think it necessary to evacuate children, therefore it was safe for adults to stay.

The reasons why people stayed or evacuated were personal, ranging from fear of the unknown to noble thoughts of continuing the fight with England. Only a few people were put under pressure to either evacuate or stay, often due to their important jobs.

The island authorities assumed that all locals who particularly feared a German occupation would leave the islands, such as people of the [[History of the Jews in Guernsey|Jewish]] [[History of the Jews in Jersey|faith]]. Some certainly did, however it came as a surprise to find out later that others had decided not to leave or who were barred from entering the United Kingdom, because they were "aliens", resulted in around 20 people the Germans would define as "Jewish" becoming trapped in the islands.

Houses, cars and businesses were abandoned by those evacuating. Some locked their front doors, some did not, reasoning that someone would break the door to get in anyway. Some gave away pets, others just released them, many put them down. Some gave away furniture and belongings, some gave it to someone for safe storage,&lt;ref name=DL/&gt;{{rp|40}} others simply walked away, leaving dirty dishes in the sink and food on the table. The withdrawal of cash from banks was limited to £20 per person. People could take just one suitcase.

The [[Lieutenant Governor of Jersey]] and [[Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey]] left their islands on board ships on 21 June 1940, the day France surrendered.

=== Ships ===
[[File:SS Viking in Steam Packet service..JPG|thumb|300px|SS ''Viking'' in Steam Packet service.]]
Ships urgently needed to evacuate soldiers from France in [[Operation Ariel]], were diverted to help civilians in the Channel Islands. Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] requested an [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|armistice]] on 17 June and on 19 June nearby [[Cherbourg]] was captured by German forces.

25 ships took people from Guernsey on 21 June alone,&lt;ref name=SHCII/&gt;{{rp|82}} ships like the [[SS Viking (1905)|SS ''Viking'']], built 1905, served as [[HMS Vindex (1915)|HMS ''Vindex'']] until 1918. Requisitioned in 1939 as a troopship, she transported 1,800 schoolchildren from Guernsey to Weymouth.&lt;ref name=DL/&gt;{{rp|47}} Eighteen ships sailed on 21 June from Jersey including the [[SS Shepperton Ferry|SS ''Shepperton Ferry'']] carrying military stores and 400 evacuees. Evacuation ships stopped on 23 June,&lt;ref name=SHCII/&gt;{{rp|82}} when ships sailed for England empty.&lt;ref name=CIOR39/&gt;{{rp|139}} The regular cargo boats and ferries were asked to resume normal service and six evacuation ships were sent to [[Alderney]] on 23 June,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coysh |first=Victor |title=Maritime Alderney |publisher=Guernsey Press |ISBN=0902550438 |date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} where previous ships had docked and left almost empty of passengers. 90% of all Channel Island evacuees were taken to [[Weymouth Harbour, Dorset]].&lt;ref name=CIOR39/&gt;{{rp|140}}

Several ships including the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] SS ''Isle of Sark'', the normal cross channel ferry, were docked in [[St Peter Port]] harbour on 28 June when the [[Luftwaffe]] arrived and six [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers attacked Guernsey. Lewis machine guns on the ships opened fire, to no visible effect. The bomb damage was mainly to the harbour where lorries loaded with tomatoes for export were lined up, 34 people died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/91/a3992691.shtml |title=The Bombing of Guernsey Harbour 28th June 1940 |publisher=BBC |date=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar attack occurred in Jersey where nine died. That night the ''Isle of Sark'' sailed for England with 647 refugees, she was the last ship to sail, its Captain, Hervy H. Golding being awarded an OBE for his actions that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/guernsey/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8379000/8379301.stm |title=The story of an evacuation hero |publisher=BBC |date=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that Guernsey was loading ships with tomatoes rather than people indicates the lack of panic; ships from Guernsey and Jersey designated to carry evacuees were sometimes packed, but others did not sail to their full capacity.&lt;ref name=SHCII/&gt;{{rp|80–81}} No hospital ship had arrived to take the elderly and sick away.&lt;ref name=SHCII/&gt;{{rp|84}} Several ships, including the [[Saint Peter Port Lifeboat Station|Guernsey lifeboat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rnli.org.gg/lifeboat-timeline/lifeboat-timeline-1900-1999/harold-hobbs |title= Report of Service on the 29th day of June 1940 |publisher=RNLI}}&lt;/ref&gt; were machine gunned by German aircraft however with enemy aircraft and submarines operating in the Channel, it was lucky that no evacuation ship was sunk.

=== Aircraft ===

R.A.F. units moved from [[Dinard]] in France to Jersey on 15 June, [[No. 17 Squadron RAF]] and [[No. 501 Squadron RAF]] flying sorties until 19 June, in support of the evacuation from Cherbourg, when the aircraft flew to England and the ground support units were evacuated on the [[SS Train Ferry No. 1]].&lt;ref name="CIOR39"&gt;{{cite book |title=Channel Islands Occupation Review No 39 |publisher=Channel Islands Occupation Society |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|137}} Other military planes were using the Islands, on 17 June 1940, a [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide]] DH.89 plane arrived in Jersey from [[Bordeaux]] evacuating ''Général de brigade'' [[Charles de Gaulle]] from France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles |last=De Gaulle |title=The complete war memoirs of Charles de Gaulle |isbn=0-7867-0546-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed for lunch whilst waiting for the plane to be refuelled, before flying on to London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Channel Islands Occupation Review No 39 |publisher=Channel Islands Occupation Society |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

319 people evacuated the islands on five civilian [[de Havilland Express]] DH-86 aircraft, between 16 and 19 June, landing in Exeter.&lt;ref name="SHCII"&gt;{{cite book |first= Simon |last=Hamon |title=Channel Islands Invaded: The German Attack on the British Isles in 1940 Told Through Eye-Witness Accounts, Newspapers Reports, Parliamentary Debates, Memoirs and Diaries |publisher=Frontline Books, 2015 |isbn=978-1-4738-5160-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evacuees in the UK ==

Four fifths of the children and altogether almost half the population of Guernsey were transported to England so scarcely a family was undivided. À la perchoine."]]

=== Schools ===
Upon arrival in England, the Guernsey school children were met with mountains of jam sandwiches, bread and butter and tea,&lt;ref name=SHCII/&gt;{{rp|82}} before being given a medical and put on crowded blacked out trains, machines most island children had never seen before,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strappini |first=Richard |title=St Martin, Guernsey, Channel Islands, a parish history from 1204 |date=2004 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be transported north. 5,000 Guernsey children with their teachers and 500 mothers who became teaching assistants.
* [[Elizabeth College, Guernsey]] sent initially to Oldham, moved on to [[Great Hucklow]] in Derbyshire
* Intermediate School for Boys merged with [[Oldham Hulme Grammar School]] 
* Intermediate School for Girls went to [[Rochdale]]
* [[Ladies' College]] went to [[Denbigh]] in Wales
* Forest and St Martin's Schools set up in Cheadle Hulme in Cheshire
* Other primary schools managed to keep pupils together and established themselves in several small communities.&lt;ref name=PGE/&gt;

Most Alderney and Jersey school children were scattered, attending different local schools, except [[Victoria College, Jersey]] pupils who congregated at [[Bedford School]]&lt;ref name="PGE"&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Gosden |title=Education in the Second World War: A Study in Policy and Administration |publisher=Routledge, 2013 |isbn=978-1-134-53055-7 |pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years to come, children leaving school at the normal age of 14 went into occupations including war industries and would join the Home Guard, 17 year old girls could join the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service|ATS]] or [[Women's Land Army|WLA]].&lt;ref name="HH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyinanhour.com/2011/10/18/guernsey-evacuees-world-war-two/ |title=The Experiences of Guernsey Evacuees in Northern England, 1940 – 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Families ===
[[File:Channel Island Evacuees Try on American Clothing in Marple, Cheshire, England, 1940 D742.jpg|thumb|Channel Island evacuees try on American clothing in Marple, Cheshire, England, 1940]]

Some reception centres run by [[The Salvation Army]] and [[Royal Voluntary Service|WVS]] helpers were surprised to discover that Channel Islanders could speak English, having arranged for translators to be available, islanders answering questions put to them in French with their own local [[Patois]] which the translators could not understand.&lt;ref name=HH/&gt; Some ignorant people asked if they had sailed across the Mediterranean and why were they not wearing grass skirts.&lt;ref name=MAHF/&gt;{{rp|143}}

Stockport had received at least 1,500 refugees and would years later erect a blue plaque to commemorate the event,&lt;ref name=HH/&gt; others went to Bury, Oldham, Wigan, Halifax, Manchester, Glasgow and many other towns.

Some mothers travelling with children whose husbands either stayed in the islands or had joined the armed services initially found attempts were tried to take their children away as it was considered they could not possibly look after them with their husbands away.&lt;ref name=MAHF/&gt;{{rp|143}}

Women whose husbands were still in the islands were told they were not allowed to rent accommodation, so found they had to match up with a woman whose husband was in the armed services and share a house.&lt;ref name=GMfe/&gt; Not being able to live on the public assistance monies, one mother would look after the children whilst another mother went out to work, sometimes both worked, one doing a night shift and the other a day shift.&lt;ref name=GMfe/&gt;

Some houses were not good, previously condemned, damp or bug ridden. Others used empty shops as nothing else was available.&lt;ref name=HH/&gt; If children or families had relatives in the UK, they tended to drift, with their single suitcase of belongings to them, to seek assistance. Some evacuees had brought an elderly relative with them.&lt;ref name=EC2ww/&gt; Islanders were not shy in volunteering for [[Air Raid Precautions]] (ARP), [[Auxiliary Fire Service]] (AFS), [[Home Guard]] or [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] (VAD) duties in their spare time.

People in the North of England generally rallied to help the evacuees. They were very generous, helping with clothes and shoes, arranging picnics, providing free tickets to cinemas and football matches, lending furniture and donating money for Christmas presents for children.&lt;ref name=HH/&gt;

=== Safety ===
Just because thousands had managed to cross the English Channel safely did not mean they would have a safe war. Children from Manchester had recently been evacuated to Canada, as that city was not considered safe, they were replaced by Channel Island children.&lt;ref name=HH/&gt;

Those that joined the armed forces were subject to the usual war risks, those that worked in the UK, whether in war industries or elsewhere were, just like the children, subject to the risk of bombing.&lt;ref name=DL/&gt;{{rp|15}}

Some of the Channel Island children, like some of the 1,500,000 British children&lt;ref name=DL/&gt;{{rp|ii}} that were evacuated from cities in 1939, would suffer mistreatment and abuse, physical, mental and sexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-1362571/Julie-Summers-talks-evacuees-Second-World-War-life-changing-experiences.html |title='We didn't know where we belonged': Former child evacuees of the Second World War recall their experiences |publisher=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are stories of extorting child labour, stealing the rations of the children, beatings, etc., but they were in the minority, and most were rescued by inspectors.&lt;ref name=GMfe/&gt; For a few, being fostered was a better life than they had had at home.

The psychological damage changed many evacuees, especially children and especially those deprived of their parents, teachers, siblings and friends for five years. Some put up with, even though they hated the experience, most of the children had nobody to talk to about problems and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Marten |title=Children and War: A Historical Anthology |publisher=NYU Press, 2002 |isbn=978-0-8147-5667-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|275–6}} It was not unusual to blame evacuee children if there was vandalism or something went missing. Most were content and more than a few children formed long lasting friendships with loving caring families that looked after them.

== Contact and communications ==
[[File:1941 Red Cross letter1.jpg|thumb|160px|December 1941 Red Cross letter from England]]
[[File:1941 Red Cross letter2.jpg|thumb|160px|Red Cross letter reply April 1942]]
Channel Island refugees were not able to write or receive letters to people at home, as their homes were now occupied by the enemy.

=== Red Cross messages ===
Everyone who left the islands left behind friends and relatives. With the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|islands under German occupation]] communications were severed. In 1941 the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Red Cross]] message system, which was designed primarily for use by captured soldiers was, following negotiations, allowed to include civilians in the Channel Islands. In May 1941, the first 7,000 arrived in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strappini |first=Richard |title=St Martin, Guernsey, Channel Islands, a parish history from 1204 |date=2004 |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was initially limited to 10 words per letter, but was later changed to 25, which was the standard for POWs. The rules changed over the years; at one point islanders were not permitted to write to relatives, but could write to friends. The number of messages one could send were limited, and replies had to be on the back of the original message. Messages might take months, although a few arrived in weeks. All messages were routed via the International Red Cross headquarters in Geneva, which dealt with 24 million messages during the war. The islands dealt with around 1 million. Each message sent cost 6d.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/About-us/Who-we-are/Museum-and-archives/Historical-factsheets/Channel-Islands-relief-in-the-Second-World-War |title=Delivering relief to the Channel Islands in the Second World War |publisher=Red Cross UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To islanders, this tiny link was a saviour. Although slow and limited, it kept vital contacts and reduced fear of the unknown. However, not all messages were good; they included notices like "Baby Mary died last December." One family who had two boys in England received a message saying "Your son died in England."&lt;ref name=GMfe/&gt; Messages ceased shortly after 6 June 1944, when the islands were cut off and isolated.

=== Societies ===
The Jersey Society, which had been founded in London in 1896, acted as a link for Jersey evacuees during the war. The society accumulated over 1,000 books published during the war to restock the island libraries after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.gg/about |title=Our History |publisher=Guille Allez Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 90 local "Channel Island Societies" were established in England, with weekly meetings and arranged social events, including card games and dances.&lt;ref name=EC2ww/&gt; Welfare committees were established to help islanders, allowing the evacuees to maintain contact, talk about their news, gain mutual support and allow children to play together.&lt;ref name=HH/&gt; Islanders serving in the forces would attend meetings when possible.&lt;ref name=EC2ww/&gt;

The [[Guernsey Society]] was formed in 1943 to represent the interests of the island to the British Government during the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|German Occupation]], and to establish a network for Guernsey evacuees in the [[United Kingdom]].
[[File:CI Monthly Review.jpg|thumb|200px|CI Monthly Review]]

Lapel badges were produced to help islanders recognise other evacuees.&lt;ref name="EC2ww"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://evacueesofworldwartwo.wordpress.com/the-evacuee-clubs-of-second-world-war-britain/ |title=The 'Evacuee Clubs' of Second World War Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

20 Upper Grosvenor Street was the contact address for Islanders in London; it provided a legal bureau and held records of where 30,000 Channel Islanders could be found. A room called ''Le Coin'' became a home from home for anyone passing through the capital wanting to meet other Islanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Asa |last=Briggs |title=The Channel Islands: Occupation &amp; Liberation, 1940-1945 |publisher=Trafalgar Square Publishing |ISBN=978-0713478228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}}

=== ''Monthly Review'' ===
The Stockport and District Society was founded in January 1941 when 250 prospective members attended the first meeting. They decided to publish the ''Channel Island Monthly Review'', despite a ban on new periodicals in August 1940, due to paper shortages. The first edition, a four-page sheet, appeared in May 1941. It quickly became popular amongst the thousands of Channel Island people living in the UK. The Review was threatened with closure in May 1942 after questions in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1942/may/12/channel-island-monthly-review |title=Channel Island Monthly Review |publisher=Hansard vol 122 cc991-2 |date=12 May 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It did not close, and the 20-24 page ''Review'' was published with up to 5,000 copies a month posted out to subscribers, including service people, all over the world.&lt;ref name=HH/&gt;

The ''Review'' included a collection of articles and poetry relevant to Channel Island people and personal comments received from Red Cross messages that might affect other islanders, such as births, marriages and deaths, as well as greeting messages.

Following the [[Deportations from the German-occupied Channel Islands]] in September 1942 the December edition of the Review published lists of the deportees and their contact details so Red Cross messages could be sent to them.

The Methodist church tried to keep track of their island members in England, introduce them to English Methodists and to provide them with advice, some money, winter clothing and employment.&lt;ref name="chapel"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Chapman |title=Chapel and Swastika: Methodism in the Channel Islands During the German Occupation 1940-1945 |publisher=ELSP |ISBN=978-1906641085}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|172-182}}

Many Channel Islanders had emigrated to Canada over the years and these got together to help their homeland evacuees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exodus2013.co.uk/guernsey-evacuees-and-kind-canadians-during-the-second-world-war/ |title=Guernsey evacuees and kind Canadians during the Second World War}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philippe William Luce founded the Vancouver Society for the 500 Channel Islanders who lived in the area, who collected many thousands of dollars and hundreds of crates of clothing and shoes to send to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://guernseyevacuees.wordpress.com/canada-helped-the-evacuees/ |title=How CANADA helped British Evacuees |publisher=Guernsey Evacuees |accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A "Foster Parent Plan for Children Affected by War" was originally created in 1937 to help children in the Spanish Civil War, with Americans adopting a child and providing money for education and clothing. Participants included film stars. Eleanor Roosevelt adopted three children in 1942. One, Paulette, was a Guernsey evacuee who referred to her as "Auntie Eleanor who lived in the White House."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americacomesalive.com/2014/02/25/eleanor-roosevelt-foster-parent-world-war-ii-refugees/#.VrCB2Cjt1US |title=Eleanor Roosevelt: Foster Parent for World War II Refugees |publisher=America comes alive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC recorded island children singing for a Christmas 1942 radio broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/00/a8849000.shtml  |title= One small suitcase - Part Five |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC also produced a film [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-15960347 of the evacuees] showing a rally on 19 June 1943 in the [[Belle Vue Stadium]] in Manchester that was attended by 6,000 islanders.&lt;ref name=EC2ww/&gt;

The British Government had opened up an evacuation account for each of the Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey, to which certain costs could be charged, such as the cost of the evacuation ships, rail travel and the education costs of children. There were concerns over helping Channel Island private schools with their costs as British private schools received no help when evacuated from cities.&lt;ref name=PGE/&gt;

== Service and death ==
From the people who had left the Channel Islands in 1939-40 and been evacuated in 1940, over 10,000 islanders served with Allied forces.&lt;ref name="JM"&gt;{{cite book |first=Joe |last=Mière |title=Never to be forgotten |publisher=Channel Island Publishing |isbn=978-0-9542669-8-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|294}}

== Return ==
People began to return in July and August 1945, with some children taking their northern accents with them.&lt;ref name=HH/&gt;

Children who had not seen their parents for five years often did not recognise them.&lt;ref name=HH/&gt; The adults who had stayed in the islands looked old, tired, thin and wore old clothes. A few children never adjusted to the return, as the trauma of separation was too great.&lt;ref name="GMfe"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gillian |last=Mawson |title=Guernsey Evacuees: The Forgotten Evacuees of the Second World War |publisher=The History Press, 2012 |isbn=978-0-7524-9093-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For UK foster parents, the trauma of losing the children they had looked after and grown to love could be just as bad.&lt;ref name=GMfe/&gt; Some children and families kept contact and many held fond memories and grateful thanks for the people of the north who showed so much kindness.&lt;ref name=HH/&gt; The Mayor of Bolton had threatened the islands with another invasion after liberation, as so many Lancashire holidaymakers would want to see the islands they had heard so much about.&lt;ref name=EC2ww/&gt;

Not all evacuees returned. Families who had owned no property in the islands had found jobs and houses, and some youngsters had found employment and love in their evacuation towns.&lt;ref name="MAHF"&gt;{{cite book |first= Maggie |last=Andrews |title= The Home Front in Britain: Images, Myths and Forgotten Experiences Since 1914 |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan, 2014 |isbn=978-1-137-34899-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|146}} Some who did return found the men they had left in the islands had formed a relationship with another woman. No doubt the reverse applied, with women finding a new partner. Women who had become used to working found no jobs available in the islands apart from scrubbing floors.&lt;ref name=MAHF/&gt;{{rp|147}}

Many adults returned at the same time as the school children; however, some who had volunteered for the armed services were demobbed in 1946. The meetings of families could be equally traumatic, with wives and husbands meeting again for the first time in five years and discovering they had lived very different lives which were hard to talk about. Those who had been evacuated were told that it was tougher in the islands.&lt;ref name=MAHF/&gt;{{rp|148}} Alderney residents were not allowed to return to their island until December 1945.

The islands ended the war with a debt of £9,000,000, which the UK Government hoped would be repaid. &lt;ref name="PKCIW"&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=King |title=The Channel Islands War |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd |edition=First |date=1991 |isbn=978-0-7090-4512-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|108}} This was roughly the total value of every house in the Channel Islands and included the evacuation accounts. A generous gift from the UK government of £3,300,000 was used to recompense islanders who had suffered losses and the cost of maintaining the evacuees, estimated at £1,000,000, was written off by the government.&lt;ref name="GALOG"&gt;{{cite book |first=Darryl |last=Ogier |title=The Government and Law of Guernsey |publisher= States of Guernsey |isbn=978-0-9549775-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|214}}

The '''FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1962''' took place February 18–25, 1962 in [[Zakopane]], [[Poland]]. Zakopane became the second city to host the world championships three times (1929, 1939), joining [[Lahti]], [[Finland]] (1926, 1938, and 1958). Women's 5&amp;nbsp;km and the ski jumping individual normal hill made their event debuts at these championships.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5859">The '''Great Compression''' refers to "a decade of extraordinary [[wage compression]]" in the United States in the early 1940s. During that time [[economic inequality]] as shown by [[wealth distribution]] and [[income distribution]] between the rich and poor became much smaller than it had been in preceding time periods. The term was reportedly coined by [[Claudia Goldin]] and [[Robert Margo]]&lt;ref name=Noah&gt;[http://img.slate.com/media/3/100914_NoahT_GreatDivergence.pdf The Great Divergence. By Timothy Noah]| slate.com&lt;/ref&gt; in a 1992 paper,&lt;ref name=Goldin_Margo&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/qjecon/v107y1992i1p1-34.html The Great Compression: The Wage Structure in the United States at Mid-century], Goldin &amp; Margo, ''Quarterly Journal of Economics''. Volume (Year): 107 (1992)
Issue (Month): 1 (February). pp. 1–34&lt;/ref&gt; and is a takeoff on the [[Great Depression]], an event during which the Great Compression started.

(2003). Income inequality in the United States: 1913–1998. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118(1), 1–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saez"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/TabFig2005prel.xls|title=Saez, E. (October, 2007). Table A1: Top fractiles income shares (excluding capital gains) in the U.S., 1913–2005.|accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to economists [[Thomas Piketty]] and [[Emmanuel Saez]], analysis of personal income tax data shows that the compression ended in the 1970s and has now reversed in the United States, and to a lesser extent in Canada, and England where there is greater [[income inequality metrics]] and [[wealth concentration]].  In France and Japan, who have maintained [[progressive taxation]] there has not been an increase in inequality.  In Switzerland, where progressive taxation was never implemented, compression never occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/piketty-saezAEAPP06.pdf Piketty and Saez.  The evolution of top incomes:  An international comparison.]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] gives credit for the compression not only to progressive income taxation but to other [[New Deal]] and [[World War II]] policies of President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. From about 1937 to 1947 highly progressive taxation, the strengthening of unions of the New Deal, and the wage and price controls of the [[National War Labor Board (1942–1945)|National War Labor Board]] during World War II, raised the income of the poor and working class and lowered that of top earners.  Krugman argues these explanation are more convincing than the conventional [[Kuznets curve]] cycle of inequality driven by market forces because a natural change would have been gradual and not sudden as the compression was.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul]], ''[[The Conscience of a Liberal]]'', pp. 7–8, 47–52&lt;/ref&gt; 

Explanation for the length of the compression's lasting have attributed to the lack of immigrant labor in the US during that time (immigrants often not being able to vote and so support their political interests) and the strength of unions, exemplified by [[Reuther's Treaty of Detroit]]—a landmark 1949 business-labor bargain struck between the [[United Auto Workers]] union and [[General Motors]]. Under that agreement, UAW members were guaranteed wages that rose with productivity, as well as health and retirement benefits. In return GM had relatively few strikes, slowdowns, etc. Unions helped limit increases in executive pay. Further, members of Congress in both political parties significantly overlapped in their voting records and relatively more politicians advocated centrist positions with a general acceptance of New Deal policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Krugman]], ''The Conscience of a Liberal'', pp. 134, 138&lt;/ref&gt; 

The end of income compression has been credited to "impersonal forces", such as technological change and globalization, but also to political and policy changes that affected institutions (e.g., unions) and norms (e.g., acceptable executive pay). Krugman argues that the rise of "movement conservatism"—a "highly cohesive set of interlocking institutions that brought Ronald Reagan and [[Newt Gingrich]] to power"—beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s brought lower taxes on the rich and significant holes in the [[social safety net]]. The relative power of unions declined significantly along with union membership, and executive pay rose considerably relative to average worker pay.&lt;ref name=Krugman&gt;[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/introducing-this-blog/ introducing this blog] (see graph), Paul Krugman&lt;/ref&gt; The reversal of the great compression has been called "the [[Great Divergence (inequality)|Great Divergence]]" by Krugman and is the title of a ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' article and book by [[Timothy Noah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://img.slate.com/media/3/100914_NoahT_GreatDivergence.pdf The Great Divergence By Timothy Noah]&lt;/ref&gt;  Krugman also notes that era before the Great Divergence was one not only of relative equality but of economic growth far surpassing the "Great Divergence".&lt;ref&gt;
*2.7%/average annual growth of real income of typical family for the postwar boom, from 1947 to 1973; compared to 
*0.7%/annual income growth for the modern era of reasonable growth with rising inequality, from 1980 until the present. (The era of stagflation from 1973-1980 had no growth). [[Paul Krugman]], ''The Conscience of a Liberal'', pp. 54–55)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Handspring, Inc''' was a maker of [[Palm OS]]–based Visor- and Treo-branded [[personal digital assistant]]s. In 2003, the company merged with [[Palm, Inc.]]'s hardware division.

==History==
The company was founded in June 1998 by [[Jeff Hawkins]], [[Donna Dubinsky]], and [[Ed Colligan]], the original inventors of the [[PalmPilot]] and founders of Palm, Inc., after they became unhappy with the direction of the company after its acquisition by [[3Com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica/whomade/dubinsky_hi.html | title=Who Made America?: Donna Dubinsky | work=[[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their Visor line of PDAs synced by USB, which was significantly faster than Palm's RS232 serial sync.  The Springboard expansion slot provided GPS navigation, cameras, music players, cell phone service, and most of the functions of a "smart phone".  

In June 2000, during the [[dot-com bubble]], the company became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]]. Shares rose 35% on the first day of trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2000/06/21/deals/chinaunicom/ | title=Handspring jumps in debut | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=June 21, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the company merged with Palm, Inc.'s hardware division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eweek.com/mobile/news-analysis-roundup-palm-acquires-handspring | title=News Analysis Roundup: Palm Acquires Handspring | work=[[eWeek]] | date=June 9, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Visor and Visor Deluxe====
[[File:Handspring Visor Deluxe Black.jpg|thumb|Handspring Visor Deluxe Black]]
Handspring first introduced the '''Visor Solo''', which was black and contained 2MB of onboard memory. The '''Visor Deluxe''' had the option of translucent colored models, and had 8MB of onboard memory. The Visor and Visor Deluxe used Palm OS 3.1H running on a [[Freescale DragonBall]] processor, a modified version of the OS from Palm that included an enhanced datebook, a city time graphical world clock, and an advanced calculator. Unlike the Palm Pilot, the Visor's [[IrDA]] port was placed on the side of the device to make room for the [[Springboard Expansion Slot]]. The Visor and Visor Deluxe weight is 5.4 oz. Their dimensions are 4.8" x 3.0" x 0.7". The display is 2.25 inches square with diagonal span of 3.0 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cnet.com/products/palm-visor-solo/specs/ | title=Palm Visor Solo Specs | work=[[CNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cnet.com/products/palm-visor-deluxe-blue/specs/ | title=Palm Visor Deluxe Specs | work=[[CNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Visor Prism====
[[File:Handspring Visor Prism.jpg|thumb|Handspring Visor Prism]]
When Handspring released the Visor Prism, it was flashlight-bright and the first Palm OS handheld to have a 16-bit color display (65,536 colors); the contemporary model (IIIc) produced by Palm only had an 8-bit color display (256 colors). Like Palm's IIIc, Prism's color screen turned nearly pitch black in sunlight. Prism's cobalt-blue-only case (and cradle, which required an attached AC charger, as USB cables could not supply power at the time) was a departure for a PDA line known for a broad array of colored cases. Prism's power came from a rechargeable lithium ion battery, rather than two AAA batteries like previous Visors. However, despite the shoehorn-like contoured back to support the rechargeable battery, it did have the Visor [[Springboard Expansion Slot|Springboard slot]]; the infrared port was again on the side. The Prism featured Palm OS 3.5.2H3, and weighed 6.9 oz. The dimensions were 4.8" × 3.0" × 0.8" with the display measuring the same as other Visors (2.25 inches square with diagonal span of 3.0 inches). The highest OS upgrade is OS 3.5.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cnet.com/products/handspring-visor-prism-handheld-palm-os-3-5-2/specs/ | title=Handspring Visor Prism Specs | work=[[CNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Visor Platinum====
[[File:Handspring Visor Platinum.jpg|thumb|Handspring Visor Platinum]]

The Visor Platinum was similar to the Visor Deluxe. Apart from shell color, the exterior of the devices were indistinguishable. The Visor Platinum was available only in a silver (platinum) or black colored shell, as opposed to the Visor Deluxe's many color choices. The Platinum included a 33-MHz [[Motorola]] DragonBall VZ processor while the Deluxe only supported a 16 or 20-MHz chip. More, the Visor Deluxe used OS 3.1H while the Visor Platinum used OS 3.5.2H. At the time of the release of the Platinum, it sported the fastest processor for a [[Palm OS]] device. Like all Visors, the Platinum contained a microphone, intended to be used for Springboard slot-based cell phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cnet.com/products/handspring-visor-platinum-handheld-palm-os-3-5-2/specs/ | title=Handspring Visor Platinum Specs | work=[[CNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Visor Edge====
[[File:Handspring Visor Edge Red.jpg|thumb|Handspring Visor Edge Red]]
Released in March 2001, the slim Visor Edge featured an MC68VZ328 DragonBall CPU clocked at 33MHz. The 160×160-pixel, 4-bit grayscale (16 shades of gray) display was standard for most Palm PDAs. However, at the time it was the thinnest and lightest Visor, sizing in at 4.7" x 3.1" x 0.44" and weighing 4.8 ounces with the display measuring the same 2.25 inches square with diagonal span of 3.0 inches as other Visors. It was packed with 8MB RAM and Handspring's latest version of the Palm OS, version 3.5.2H. Available in three colors, Metallic Blue, Metallic Silver, and Metallic Red, it was also eye catching. The built-in rechargeable Lithium-ion battery generally lasted two to four weeks on a charge. However, due to its size, the standard Springboard slot was accessed through a slide-on sleeve rather than a built-in slot. Nevertheless, this still allowed the Visor Edge to access the Springboard Modules available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cnet.com/products/handspring-visor-edge-handheld-palm-os-3-5-2-series/specs/ | title=Palm Visor Edge Specs | work=[[CNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visor Neo===
[[File:Handspring Visor Neo Blue.jpg|thumb|Handspring Visor Neo Blue]]
Released in September 2001, the Neo featured an MC68VZ328 DragonBall processor clocked at 33MHz. It had 8MB DRAM, an IrDA-compliant infrared interface, and Handspring's standard Springboard slot. Neo sported a  160×160-pixel, 4-bit grayscale (16 shades of gray) display. The 4.8" × 3.0" × 0.7" unit, weighing in at 5.4 ounces, came in sleek, translucent Blue, Red, or Smoke-grey colored case. It used Handspring's modified version of the Palm OS, version 3.5.2H3. Power came from two AAA batteries that would last up to two months. This model had a lower price, with which Handspring was hoping to attract new users. The display of all Visors measured 2.25 inches square with diagonal span of 3.0 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cnet.com/products/handspring-visor-neo-handheld-palm-os-3-5-2/specs/ | title=Handspring Visor Neo Specs | work=[[CNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visor Pro===
[[File:Handspring Visor Pro.jpg|thumb|Handspring Visor Pro]]
Released in September 2001, the Visor Pro was Handspring's last model in its Visor series of PDAs. The 4.8" × 3.0" × 0.7" unit was powered by an MC68VZ328 DragonBall processor clocked at 33MHz. Weighing 5.7 ounces, the unit came with 16 MB RAM, a built-in microphone, and Handspring's Springboard slot. It had a 4-bit grayscale (16 grays), backlit, monochrome display. Its power supply came from a rechargeable lithium-ion battery.

===Handspring Treo===
In early 2002, Handspring ceased production of the Visor line, replacing it with a line of handhelds that were to be more "communication-centric" in nature; these would be sold under the name '''Treo'''. Except for the [[Treo 90]], all Treo devices were [[smartphones]] with integrated cellular phones, and nearly all featured built-in keyboards to enhance [[e-mail]] and [[SMS]] functionality. The Treo line met with success, attributed in large part to Handspring's in-house VisorPhone software, which was tightly integrated with the Palm OS. The Springboard feature was no longer available on the Treo line, with Handspring favoring slimmer designs that left no room for the large slots necessary to support Springboard cartridges; peripheral technologies such as [[Secure Digital Input Output|SDIO]] would soon render the Springboard platform obsolete. Additionally, technological advances meant that much of the functionality provided by Springboard modules, such as additional memory, a camera, MP3 player, Wi-Fi antenna, and GPS, could now be integrated into the handheld itself at reduced cost.

====Treo 180 / 180g====
The first models of the series, the [[Treo 180]] and 180g were released in February 2002 as monochrome-screen GSM phones; the 180 had an integrated [[thumb keyboard]], while the 180g had a Graffiti writing area in lieu of the keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cnet.com/products/handspring-treo-180g-steel-blue-gsm-smartphone/specs/ | title=Treo 180 / 180g Specs | work=[[CNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treo 90====
Handspring followed the Treo 180 with the [[Treo 90]] in April 2002. The Treo 90 was the only Treo that was not a [[smartphone]], as it did not have mobile telephony capabilities. At the time of release, it was the physically smallest Palm OS device on the market. The Treo 90 pioneered features such as a color screen and an [[SD card]] slot, which are found on all subsequent Treo models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cnet.com/products/palm-treo-90/specs/ | title=Treo 90 Specs | work=[[CNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treo 270 / Treo 300====
The [[Treo 270]] and Treo 300 were twin models; the former worked using [[GSM]] networks, while the latter was a [[CDMA]] phone, released by [[Sprint Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cnet.com/products/handspring-treo-270-steel-gray-gsm-smartphone/specs/ | title=Treo 270 Specs | work=[[CNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treo 600====
The [[Treo 600]] was the first Treo to be rebranded as a [[Palm, Inc.]] product after Palm's acquisition of Handspring, as the PalmOne Treo 600. At the time, the GSM version of the phone was one of the few quad-band phones available in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cnet.com/products/palm-treo-600-verizon-wireless/specs/ | title=Treo 600 Specs | work=[[CNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born at [[Kjelvik]] in [[Finnmark]], Norway. His parents were Martin Kyllingmark (1879-1916) and Sigridur Sæmundsdottir (1892-1963).
He received an education at the Army Command School in 1934 and the Flyvåpen Flying School in 1937. He had a career in the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]] between in 1940 and 1943-1945. He rose to the rank of [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] in 1944 and [[major]] in 1945&amp;ndash;1954. He had been a member of [[Milorg]] during the [[German occupation of Norway]], and received the [[Defence Medal 1940–1945]].&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite web|url =https://snl.no/H%C3%A5kon_Kyllingmark|title=Håkon Kyllingmark|publisher =Store norske leksikon|author= Knut Are Tvedt|accessdate= April  1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyllingmark was a principally of the  wholesale company H. Kyllingmark A / S from  1945-1965. He was involved in local politics in [[Svolvær]] from 1945 to 1947 and 1951 to 1963. He was elected to the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] from [[Nordland]] in 1954, and was re-elected on six occasions. From August to September 1963 he was [[Minister of Defence (Norway)|Minister of Defence]] during the short-lived centre-right [[cabinet Lyng]]. While he held this position [[Moy Herborg Regina Nordahl]] took his seat in parliament. He was later [[Minister of Transport and Communications (Norway)|Norwegian Minister of Transport]] from 1965 to 1971 during the [[cabinet Borten]]. His seat was filled by [[Bodil Aakre]], [[Leif Kolflaath]] and [[Andreas Grimsø]] alternately.

'''Joe Magarac''' is a pseudo-legendary American [[folk hero]].  He is presented to readers as having been the protagonist of tales of oral folklore told by [[steelworker]]s in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], which later spread throughout the [[Rust Belt|industrial areas of the Midwestern United States]]. 

==Origin==
Magarac first appeared in print in a 1931 [[Scribner's]] Magazine article by Owen Francis, who said he heard the story from Croatian immigrant steelworkers in Pittsburgh area [[steel mills]]. 

However, field research in the early 1950s failed to uncover any traces of an [[oral tradition]] about the character, meaning that Joe Magarac, like [[Big Steve]] and [[Febold Feboldson]], probably belongs in the category of "[[fakelore]]," or stories told folk-tale style that did not actually spring from authentic [[folklore]].&lt;ref name="Pennsylvania Folklore, or is it Fakelore?"&gt;[http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/JoeMagarac.html "Pennsylvania Folklore, or is it Fakelore?"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilley"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gilley | first = Jennifer |author2=Stephen Burnett | title = Deconstructing and Reconstructing Pittsburgh's Man of Steel: Reading Joe Magarac against the Context of the 20th-Century Steel Industry | journal = The Journal of American Folklore | volume = 111 | issue = 442 | pages = 392–408 | doi = 10.2307/541047 |date=November 1998 | jstor=541047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
[[File:JoeMagaracNovel.jpg|left|thumb|225x225px|The cover of "Joe Magarac and his U.S.A. Citizen Papers".]]
Joe Magarac, whose name means "donkey" in Serbian and Croatian&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.croatia.org/crown/articles/9492/1/Joe-Magarac-a-legendary-Croatian-steel-worker-in-the-USA.html|title=Joe Magarac, a legendary Croatian steel worker in the USA|website=www.croatia.org|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is variously described as Hungarian, Serbian, Croatian, or Bohemian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/690904693|title=The Civil War era and Reconstruction : an encyclopedia of social, political, cultural, and economic history|last=Snodgrass|first=Mary Ellen|date=2011|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=|isbn=9780765682574|location=Armonk, NY|pages=|chapter=Labor Songs|oclc=690904693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Magarac stories were told in many industrial cities of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], though his home was always Pittsburgh. &lt;!-- Commenting this section out because I cannot find a reference but don't want to remove it. In [[Racine, Wisconsin]], he was described as a [[Czech Americans|Czech]] to children in [[Czech American|Bohemian]] families.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}--&gt; Magarac has been depicted as a patron saint for steelworkers. He was reputed to be able to do the work of 29 men, because he worked 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jaha.org/edu/discovery_center/work/folk_hero.html|title=Larger than Life Folk Heroes- Making a Living  - Johnstown Heritage Discovery Center|website=www.jaha.org|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He lived at Mrs. Horkey's boarding house and was physically made of steel. He was allegedly born inside—or on the outside of—an ore mountain and rose out of an ore mine to help steelworkers. He would appear at critical moments to protect steelworkers, for example to stop the falling of a 50-ton crucible on a group of steelworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jaha.org/edu/discovery_center/work/folk_hero.html|title=Larger than Life Folk Heroes- Making a Living  - Johnstown Heritage Discovery Center|website=www.jaha.org|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===
Magarac won the beautiful Mary Mestrovich's hand in marriage in a weight-lifting contest, but he allowed her to marry her true love Pete Pussick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jaha.org/edu/discovery_center/work/folk_hero.html|title=Larger than Life Folk Heroes- Making a Living  - Johnstown Heritage Discovery Center|website=www.jaha.org|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Magarac's Fate ===
His fate is debated as well. While one version of the tale states that he melted himself down in a [[Bessemer converter|Bessemer furnace]] for material to build a new mill, another states that he is still alive. The second version suggests that he is waiting at an abandoned mill, waiting for the day that the furnace burns again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/education/s_556895.html|title=Visitor brings steel man tall tale to life for Pine students|last=Wills|first=Rick|date=March 13, 2008|work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|access-date=October 6, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether Magarac is still living often rests on his ability to change from steel into human form. In the comic "[[Joe Magarac and His USA Citizen Papers|Joe Magarac and His U.S.A. Citizen Papers]]" written by Irwin Shapiro and illustrated by James Daugherty, in which Magarac is a superhuman immigrant made of steel. He is melted down into steel and becomes part of the US Capitol Building; after hearing politicians discussing immigration, Magarac returns to human form and goes to war against Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://constellations.pitt.edu/entry/steel-man-reaches-out-across-time|title=The Steel Man Reaches Out Across Time {{!}} www.constellations.pitt.edu|website=constellations.pitt.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Joe_Magarac_and_His_U_S_A_Citizen_Papers.html?id=wcEqAAAAYAAJ|title=Joe Magarac and His U.S.A.

==Legacy==
[[File:Manchester-bridge.jpg|alt=image of Manchester Bridge in Pittsburgh|thumb|The portal on the Manchester Bridge in Pittsburgh featured Magarac on one end and another folk figure, the coal miner Jan Volkanik, on the other.]]
Pittsburgh's local amusement park, [[Kennywood]], had a depiction of Joe Magarac as a scene for the Olde Kennywood Railroad.  During the slow moving, historic and culturally entertaining ride, Joe Magarac was depicted with a red-hot steel beam, bending it into shape for the amusement park's steel coasters. In 2009, the statue was donated to [[US Steel| US Steel Corporation]] and has since been re-erected at the entrance to the company's [[Edgar Thomson Works]].&lt;ref name="Pennsylvania Giants"&gt;[http://www.agilitynut.com/giants/pa.html Pennsylvania Giants], accessed 10/27/12&lt;/ref&gt;

In downtown Pittsburgh the 300 Sixth Avenue Building displays a polychrome frieze of Magarac, and the garden adjacent to the [[Children's Museum of Pittsburgh]] hosts sculptures of Magarac and other figures, designed by sculptor [[Charles Keck]] and rescued from the [[Manchester Bridge (Pittsburgh)|Manchester Bridge]] when it was razed in 1970.

One version of the Magarac story was recorded in song by [[The New Christy Minstrels]] on their 1964 [[Columbia Records]] release ''Land of Giants'':  "We're gonna build a railroad down to Frisco and back, and way down to Mexico. Who's gonna make the steel for that track? It's Joe... Magarac."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/joe-magarac-mt0031399492|title=Joe Magarac - The New Christy Minstrels {{!}} Song Info {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Tell Tall Tales!

A large statue of Joe Magarac pouring molten steel is a prominent landmark in the city of Steelport in ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]''.  The statue is also highlighted in ''[[Saints Row IV]]'' as a weapon which the player uses to fight a giant energy drink mascot.

'''Jonas Ekfeldt''' is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] music producer and singer. In 1996, using the name '''Robin Cook''', he released the single "I Won't Let the Sun Go Down" (a cover of [[Nik Kershaw]]'s debut "[[I Won't Let the Sun Go Down on Me]]") followed by "[[Comanchero (song)|Comanchero]]" and the album ''Land of Sunshine'' in 1997.

Ekfeldt sang and produced "I Won't Let the Sun Go Down" and all subsequent releases under the name Robin Cook, but appointed Manuel Manci to front and perform, thinking he himself lacked time. The truth of who really was the singer was kept secret until Swedish newspaper ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' ran an article&lt;ref&gt;Björn Solfors. [http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/musik/article10299565.ab "Robin Cook - en ny bluff"] (in Swedish). ''[[Aftonbladet]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s webpage, 20 August 2002. Retrieved 2 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002. Yet another single was released in 2002 under the name Robin Cook, titled "Susanna" with Ekfeldt on the cover.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23716">In [[World War II]], in Nazi-occupied [[Czechoslovakia]], the '''Lidice massacre''' was a complete destruction of the village of [[Lidice]], in the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], now in the [[Czech Republic]], in June 1942 on orders from [[Adolf Hitler]] and ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]]. 

In reprisal for the [[Operation Anthropoid|assassination of Reich Protector]] [[Reinhard Heydrich]] in the late spring of 1942,{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=280}} all 173 males over 15 years of age from the village were executed on 10 June 1942.&lt;ref name=Kaplan241/&gt; Another 11 men who were not in the village were arrested and executed soon afterwards, along with several others already under arrest.&lt;ref name=Kaplan241/&gt; The 184 women and 88 children were deported to concentration camps; a few children considered racially suitable for [[Germanisation]] were handed over to SS families and the rest were sent to the [[Chełmno extermination camp]] where they were gassed to death.&lt;ref name=Kaplan241/&gt; 

The Associated Press, quoting German radio received in New York, said: "All male grownups of the town were shot, while the women were placed in a concentration camp, and the children were entrusted to appropriate educational institutions." &lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, Nazis Blot Out Czech Village; Kill All Men, Disperse Others, 11 June 1942&lt;/ref&gt; About 340 people from Lidice died because of the German reprisal (192 men, 60 women and 88 children) and after the war ended, only 153 women and 17 children returned.&lt;ref name=Kaplan241&gt;Jan Kaplan and Krystyna Nosarzewska, ''Prague: The Turbulent Century'' p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Assassination of Heydrich===
{{Main article|Operation Anthropoid}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-039-44, Heydrich-Attentat.jpg|thumb|Heydrich's car at the scene of the attack.]]
From 27 September 1941, [[SS]]-''[[Obergruppenführer]]'' and General of Police Reinhard Heydrich had been Acting ''[[Reichsprotektor]]'' of the [[Nazi]] Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.&lt;ref name="Kaplan214"&gt;Jan Kaplan and Krystyna Nosarzewska, ''Prague: The Turbulent Century'' p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; This area of the former Czechoslovakia had been occupied by Nazi Germany since 5 April 1939.&lt;ref name="Kaplan214"/&gt;

On the morning of 27 May 1942, Heydrich was being driven from his country villa at [[Panenské Břežany]] to his office at [[Prague Castle]]. When he reached the Kobylisy area of [[Prague]], his car was attacked (on behalf of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile) by the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] and [[Czech Republic|Czech]] soldiers [[Jozef Gabčík]] and [[Jan Kubiš]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan241"/&gt; These men, who had been part of a team trained in Great Britain, had parachuted into [[Bohemia]] in December 1941 as part of Operation Anthropoid. 

After Gabčík's [[Sten gun]] jammed, Heydrich ordered his driver, SS-''[[Oberscharführer]]'' Klein, to stop the car. When Heydrich stood up to shoot Gabčík, Kubiš threw a modified [[anti-tank]] grenade at Heydrich's car.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, Wolfgang, ''Britische Spezialwaffen 1939–1945: Ausrüstung für Eliteeinheiten, Geheimdienst und Widerstand'', p. 72 {{ISBN|3-8423-3944-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion wounded Heydrich and Kubiš.{{sfn|Williams|2003|pp=145–147}} Heydrich sent his driver, Klein, to chase Gabčík on foot and in an exchange of fire, Gabčík shot Klein in the leg, below the knee. Kubiš and Gabčík managed to escape the scene.{{sfn|Williams|2003|p=147}} On 4 June Heydrich, having refused to be operated on by non-Germans, died in [[Bulovka Hospital]] in Prague from [[septicaemia]] caused by pieces of upholstery and his clothing entering his body when the bomb exploded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.cz/images/id_7001_8000/7419/assassination-en.pdf |title=Assassination&amp;nbsp;— Operation Arthropoid, 1941–1942 |last=Burian |first=Michal |author2=Aleš  |format=PDF |year=2002 |publisher=Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic |accessdate= 25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reprisals===
Late in the afternoon of 27 May, SS-''[[Gruppenführer]]'' [[Karl Hermann Frank]] proclaimed a state of emergency and a curfew in Prague.&lt;ref name="Kaplan239"&gt;Jan Kaplan and Krystyna Nosarzewska, ''Prague: The Turbulent Century'' p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone who helped the attackers was to be executed along with their family.&lt;ref name="Kaplan239"/&gt; A search involving 21,000 men began and 36,000 houses were checked.&lt;ref name="Kaplan239"/&gt; By 4 June, 157 people had been executed as a result of the reprisals but the assassins had not been found and no information was forthcoming.&lt;ref name="Kaplan239"/&gt;

The mourning speeches at Heydrich's funeral in [[Berlin]] were not yet over, when on 9 June, the decision was made to "make up for his death". Karl Hermann Frank, Secretary of State for the [[Nazi Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], reported from Berlin that the ''[[Führer]]'' had commanded the following concerning any village found to have harboured Heydrich's killers:&lt;ref name="Kaplan246"&gt;Jan Kaplan and Krystyna Nosarzewska, ''Prague: The Turbulent Century'' p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

#Execute all adult men
#Transport all women to a concentration camp
#Gather the children suitable for Germanisation, then place them in SS families in the Reich and bring the rest of the children up in other ways
#Burn down the village and level it entirely

==Massacre==

===Men===
[[Horst Böhme (SS officer)|Horst Böhme]], the [[Sicherheitspolizei|SiPo]] chief for the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], immediately acted on the orders.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=280}} Members of the ''[[Ordnungspolizei]]'' and SD (''Sicherheitsdienst'') surrounded the village of Lidice, blocking all avenues of escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/history/article106440451/Nicht-die-SS-Polizisten-mordeten-in-Lidice.html |title=NS-Massaker : Nicht die SS, Polizisten mordeten in Lidice – Nachrichten Kultur – Geschichte – DIE WELT |publisher=Welt.de |accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazi regime chose this village because its residents were suspected of harbouring local resistance partisans and were falsely associated with aiding Operation Anthropoid team members.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Gordon, ''Loyalty is my Honor'' p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19480624&amp;id=1T4aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FyUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4604,4187475&amp;hl=fr|title=The Love Letter That destroyed Lidice|last=Wechsberg|first=Joseph|date=24 June 1948|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=20|access-date=25 May 2016|via=Google News Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lidice - pietni akt.jpg|thumb|Post-war memorial ceremony to honour victims]]
All men of the village were rounded up and taken to the farm of the Horák family on the edge of the village. Mattresses were taken from neighbouring houses where they were stood up against the wall of the Horáks' barn to prevent ricochets.&lt;ref name="Kaplan246"/&gt; The shooting of the men commenced at about 7.00&amp;nbsp;am. At first the men were shot in groups of five, but Böhme thought the executions were proceeding too slowly and ordered that ten men be shot at a time. The dead were left lying where they fell. This continued until the afternoon hours when there were 173 dead.&lt;ref name="Kaplan239"/&gt; Another 11 men who were not in the village that day were arrested and murdered soon afterwards as were eight men and seven women already under arrest because they had relations serving with the Czech army in exile in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Kaplan246"/&gt; The only adult man who survived this tragedy was František Saidl (1887–1961), who had been arrested at the end of 1938, because on 19 December 1938 he accidentally killed his son Eduard Saidl. He was imprisoned for four years and had no idea about this massacre. He found out when he returned home on 23 December 1942.

===Women and children===
A total of 203 women and 105 children were first taken to Lidice village school, then the nearby town of [[Kladno]] and detained in the grammar school for three days. The children were separated from their mothers and four pregnant women were sent to the same hospital where Heydrich died, forced to undergo abortions and then sent to different concentration camps. On 12 June 1942, 184 women of Lidice were loaded on trucks, driven to Kladno railway station and forced into a special passenger train guarded by an escort. On the morning of 14 June, the train halted on a railway siding at the [[concentration camp]] at [[Ravensbrück]]. The camp authorities tried to keep the Lidice women isolated, but were prevented from doing so by other inmates. The women were forced to work in leather processing, road building, textile and ammunition factories.&lt;ref name="Shilka Publishing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Russell|title=A Ray of Light: Reinhard Heydrich, Lidice, and the North Staffordshire Miners|date=2016|publisher=Shilka Publishing|isbn=9780995513303|url=https://www.shilka.co.uk/heydrich-lidice/|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighty-eight Lidice children were transported to the area of the former textile factory in Gneisenau Street in [[Łódź]]. Their arrival was announced by a telegram from [[Horst Böhme (SS officer)|Horst Böhme]]'s Prague office which ended with: ''the children are only bringing what they wear. No special care is desirable.''{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The care was minimal and they suffered from a lack of hygiene and from illnesses. By order of the camp management, no medical care was given to the children. Shortly after their arrival in Łódź, officials from the Central Race and Settlement branch chose seven children for [[Kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany|Germanisation]].&lt;ref name="Lynn H. Nicholas p 254"&gt;Lynn H. Nicholas, ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 254 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few children considered racially suitable for Germanisation were handed over to SS families.&lt;ref name="Kaplan246"/&gt;

The furore over Lidice caused some hesitation over the fate of the remaining children but in late June [[Adolf Eichmann]] ordered the massacre of the remainder of the children.&lt;ref name="Lynn H. Nicholas p 254"/&gt; However Eichmann was not convicted of this crime at his trial in Jerusalem, as the judges deemed that "... it has not been proved to us beyond reasonable doubt, according to the evidence before us, that they were murdered." &lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah 1963 "Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil" p. 207 &lt;/ref&gt; On 2 July, all of the remaining 82 Lidice children were handed over to the Łódź [[Gestapo]] office, who sent them to the [[Chelmno extermination camp]] {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=off}} away, where they were gassed to death in [[Magirus]] [[gas van]]s. Out of the 105 Lidice children, 82 died in Chełmno, six died in the German [[Lebensborn]] orphanages and 17 returned home.

===Lidice===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1993-020-26A, Lidice, Ort nach Zerstörung.jpg|thumb|Destruction of Lidice]]
The village was set on fire and the remains of the buildings destroyed with explosives. All the animals in the village—pets and [[Working animal|beasts of burden]]—were slaughtered as well. Even those buried in the town cemetery were not spared; their remains were dug up, looted for gold fillings and jewellery, and destroyed.&lt;ref name="Kaplan241"/&gt; A 100-strong German work party was then sent in to remove all visible remains of the village, re-route the stream running through it and the roads in and out. They then covered the entire area the village had occupied with topsoil and planted crops. A film was made of the process by Franz Treml, a collaborator with German intelligence. Treml had run a [[Zeiss-Ikon]] shop in Lucerna Palace in Prague and after the Nazi occupation, he became a film adviser for the [[Nazi Party]].

===Further reprisals===

The small Czech village of [[Ležáky]] was destroyed two weeks after Lidice after [[Gestapo]] agents found a radio transmitter there of an underground team who parachuted in with Kubiš and Gabčík. Men and women of the village were shot and the children were sent to concentration camps or [[Aryanization (Nazism)|"Aryanised"]]. The death toll resulting from the effort to avenge the death of Heydrich is estimated at over 1,300 people.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=285}} This count includes relatives of the partisans, their supporters, Czech elites suspected of disloyalty and random victims like those from Lidice.

==Commemorations==

===International response===

[[File:Lidice shall live.jpg|thumb|British poster commemorating Lidice]]
[[File:Ben Shahn Lidice poster.jpg|thumb|Poster by [[Ben Shahn]], ''The is Nazi Brutality'', referencing the massacre at Lidice.]]
Nazi propaganda had openly, and proudly, announced the events in Lidice, unlike other massacres in occupied Europe which were kept secret.&lt;ref name="nuremberg_trial_proceedings_vol_8"&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/02-22-46.asp "Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Vol. 8"]. 22 February 1946&lt;/ref&gt; The information was instantly picked up by Allied media. In September 1942, coal [[miner]]s in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Staffordshire]] in Great Britain led by [[Barnett Stross]], a doctor, who in 1945 became a local MP, founded the organisation ''Lidice Shall Live'' to raise funds for the rebuilding of the village after the war.&lt;ref name="Shilka Publishing"/&gt;

Soon after the razing of the village, towns in various countries were renamed, [[San Jerónimo Lídice]] in [[Mexico City]], Barrio Lídice and its hospital in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], [[Lídice de Capira]] in Panama and towns in [[Brazil]] so that the name would live on in spite of Hitler's intentions. A neighbourhood in [[Crest Hill, Illinois]] was renamed from Stern Park to Lidice. There is a shrine at Lidice park on Prairie Avenue in Crest Hill; the original shrine was at the end of Kelly Avenue at Elsie Street. A square in the English city of [[Coventry]], devastated by [[Coventry Blitz|Luftwaffe bombing]], is named after Lidice. An alley in a very crowded area of downtown [[Santiago]], [[Chile]] is named after Lidice and one of the buildings has a small plaque that explains its tragic story. A street in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]] is named to commemorate the massacre and the [[Lidice Memorial]] in [[Phillips, Wisconsin]] was built in memory of the village.

In the wake of the massacre, [[Humphrey Jennings]] directed ''[[The Silent Village]]'' (1943), using amateur actors from a Welsh mining village, [[Cwmgiedd]], near the small [[South Wales]] town of [[Ystradgynlais]]. An American film was made in 1943 called ''[[Hitler's Madman]]'' but it contained a number of inaccuracies in the story. A more accurate British film, ''[[Operation Daybreak]]'', starring [[Timothy Bottoms]] as Kubiš, [[Martin Shaw]] as Čurda and [[Anthony Andrews]] as Gabčík, was released in 1975.

American poet [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] wrote a book-length verse play on the massacre, ''The Murder of Lidice'', which was excerpted in the 17 October 1942, edition of ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Edna St. Vincent Millay|author2=Franklin P Adams (intro.)|authorlink1=Edna St. Vincent Millay|authorlink2=Franklin Pierce Adams|title=The Murder of Lidice|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1942oct17-00003|website=UNZ.org - Periodicals, Books, and Authors|accessdate=30 October 2016|archiveurl=http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev|archivedate=17 October 1942|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; a larger version of which was published in the 19 October 1942 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, and published in full as a book later that year by Harper.&lt;ref&gt;Millay, Edna St. Vincent. ''The Murder of Lidice''. New York: Harper: 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the connections between Lidice and Stoke-on-Trent were brought to new generations as Artbay owner Alan Gerrard discovered and championed the story of Barnett Stross while researching the history of mining in North Staffordshire. A commemoration service was organised by Fentonians Alan Gerrard, Cheryl Gerrard, Glenn Parkes and others at Fenton Cenotaph on 10 June 2011.&lt;ref name="Lidice Commemorative Gathering Fenton 2010 - Pics Video and Listen again "&gt;[http://www.6towns.co.uk/2011/06/lidice-commemorative-gathering-pics-video-and-listen-again/ 6 Towns Radio - Lidice Commemorative Gathering Pics, Video and Listen Again]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was covered as an international live radio broadcast by local community radio station [[6 Towns Radio]]. In 2013, ''[https://lidiceshalllive.wordpress.com/ Lidice – A Light Across The Sea]'', a documentary film project featuring the story of Lidice and its link to Stoke-on-Trent, was made by Staffordshire firm Inspired Film and Video. The research carried out by Alan Gerrard was shared with the film's makers, and it featured original compositions by music students at [[Keele University]].

In the month of June, 2017, in order to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the Lidice massacre, Vic Carnall - Stoke-on-Trent-based violinist, pianist, and composer, and, also, Founder and present-day Chairperson of VJ Concerts - wrote his Opus 17, for solo piano.   A copy of this original work, entitled "In Memoriam: the Village of Lidice (Czechoslovakia / June, 1942)", now resides in the Lidice Memorial archives.

There is a memorial sculpture and small information panel commemorating the Lidice massacre, in Wallanlagen Park in [[Bremen]], Germany.

===Local response and the new Lidice===

[[File:Memorial lidice children (2007)-commons.JPG|thumb|left|Memorial to the murdered children of Lidice]]
Czech composer [[Bohuslav Martinů]] composed his ''Memorial to Lidice'' (an 8-minute orchestral work) in 1943 as a response to the massacre. The piece quotes from the Czech ''[[St Wenceslas Chorale]]'' and in the climax of the piece, the opening notes (dot-dot-dot-dash = ''V'' in Morse code) of [[Beethoven's 5th Symphony]].&lt;ref&gt;Mihule J. Liner note to Supraphon CD 11 1931-2 001, which includes the work played by the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by [[Karel Ančerl]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Women from Lidice who survived imprisonment at Ravensbrück returned after the Second World War and were rehoused in the new village of Lidice that was built overlooking the original site. The first part of the new village was completed in 1949. Two men from Lidice were in the United Kingdom serving in the [[Royal Air Force]] at the time of the massacre. After 1945 [[Pilot Officer]] Josef Horák and [[Flight Lieutenant]] Josef Stříbrný returned to Czechoslovakia to serve in the [[Czech Air Force|Czechoslovak Air Force]]. 

After the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]] the new Communist government would not allow them to apply to be housed in the new Lidice, because they had served in the forces of one of the western powers. Horák and his family returned to Britain and the RAF; he died in a flying accident in December 1948.&lt;ref name="czech_hero"&gt;David Vaughan. [http://www.radio.cz/en/article/30570 "Josef Horak, a twentieth-century Czech hero"]. ''[http://www.radio.cz Český Rozhlas]''. 24 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

A sculpture from the 1990s by Marie Uchytilová, overlooks the site of the old village of Lidice. Entitled "[[Memorial to the Children Victims of the War, Lidice|The Memorial to the Children Victims of the War]]" it comprises 82 [[bronze]] statues of children (42 girls and 40 boys) aged 1 to 16, to honour the children who were murdered at [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]] in the summer of 1942. A cross with a crown of thorns marks the mass grave of the Lidice men. Overlooking the site is a memorial area flanked by a museum and a small exhibition hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lidice-memorial.cz/to2000_en.aspx |title=Lidice Memorial: History |publisher=Lidice-memorial.cz |date=10 July 1945 |accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial area is linked to the new village by an avenue of [[Tilia|linden]] trees. In 1955 a "Rosarium" of 29,000 [[rose]] bushes was created beside the avenue of lindens overlooking the site of the old village. In the 1990s the Rosarium was neglected but after 2001 a new Rosarium with 21,000 bushes was created.&lt;ref name="lidice_memorial"&gt;[http://www.lidice-memorial.cz/to2000_en.aspx "The History of Lidice Memorial Before Year 2000"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53920">The people on this list are or were survivors of [[Nazi Germany]]'s attempt to exterminate the Jews in Europe before and during [[World War II]]. A state-enforced persecution of [[Jews]] in Nazi-controlled Europe lasted from the introduction of the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1933 to [[Hitler]]'s defeat in 1945. Although there were many [[victims of the Holocaust]], the ''International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims'' (ICHEIC) defines a [[Holocaust survivor]] as, "Any Jew who lived for any period of time in a country that was ruled by the Nazis or their allies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barkat|first1=Amiram|title=Who Counts as a Holocaust Survivor?|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/who-counts-as-a-holocaust-survivor-1.119868|website=Haaretz|accessdate=21 July 2017|language=en|date=18 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The United States Holocaust Museum (USHMM) gives a broader definition "The Museum honors as a survivor any person who was displaced, persecuted, and/or discriminated against by the racial, religious, ethnic, social, and/or political policies of the Nazis and their allies between 1933 and 1945. In addition to former inmates of concentration camps and ghettos, this also includes refugees and people in hiding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/remember/office-of-survivor-affairs|title=Office of Survivor Affairs — United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|website=www.ushmm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, as well as Jews, this includes [[Romani people]] (Gypsies), those who were persecuted for political reasons such as [[Communists]], those who were persecuted for religious reasons (such as [[Pastor Niemoller]]), and [[homosexuals]] (gays) and those of other sexual orientations. It includes those who were actually in hiding in Nazi-occupied countries. The latter includes [[Hidden Children]], who were hidden to escape the Nazis.

Most especially, in contrast to the ICHEIC definition, it includes [[refugees]], who fled from their homeland to escape the Nazis, and never lived in a Nazi-controlled country.

The ICHEIC definition was created for the purpose of resolving some insurance claims. Over time, the classes of insurance claims have greatly expanded.

This list does not include [[refugees]], since it is created on the basis of the restricted ICHEIC definition. There were many many eminent refugees (too many to mention). Refugees include the unaccompanied children of the [[Kindertransport]], which includes Physics [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Arno Allan Penzias]]. Refugees also include the unaccompanied [[One Thousand Children]], which includes Physics Nobel Laureate [[Jack Steinberger]]. (Somewhat inconsistently the refugee Kindertransport Nobel Laureate [[Walter Kohn]], a Nobel Laureate in chemistry, is listed below.)

It was created by Dr. Charles Lund, Senior Surgeon at [[Boston City Hospital]], and Dr. Newton Browder, based on their experiences in treating over 300 burn victims injured at the [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] in Boston in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Lurid CC, Browder NC. "The estimation of areas of burns." ''Surg Gynecol Obstet'' 1944; 79: 352-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[Wallace rule of nines]], the Lund and Browder chart takes into consideration of age of the person,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=ABC of burns: Initial management of a major burn: II—assessment and resuscitation | author=Hettiaratchy, S.

The '''Opéra-Théâtre de Metz Métropole''' is a 750-seat [[opera house]] and [[theatre]] located on the Petit-Saulcy island in [[Metz]], capital of the [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] region, [[France]]. It is the oldest opera house working in France and one of the oldest in [[Europe]]. It is also one of the last possessing its own [[costume]] [[Atelier Method|atelier]]s in France.

==Construction and architecture==
[[File:Metz_Theatre_nuit.jpg|thumb|left|Opera-Theater of Metz Metropole by night.]]
In 1732, [[Charles Louis Auguste Fouquet|Duke de Belle-Isle]], governor of the [[Three Bishoprics]] and [[Benefactor (law)|benefactor]] of Metz, decided the urban planning of the Petit-Saulcy island (then used to stock firewoods, and occasionally for horse-fairs), in order built in Metz a modern square in a context of the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The island was drained and the embankments and four bridges were built, connecting the medieval town to the island. The edification of the opera house was conducted by Messin architect Jacques Oger. Adjacent to the opera house, the urban planning included also the construction of the [[Intendant#France|Royal Intendant]] palace by architect Barthélemy Bourdet.

The construction of the opera house extended from 1732 to 1752, the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] interrupting the works during 8 years. The [[Tuscany]]-influenced [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-Classical]] building is finally inaugurated with a public ball on February 3, 1752. The duke of Belle-Isle described it as "one of the most beautiful France's opera-theater" at his time, seating 1,382.

During the [[French Revolution]], the [[guillotine]] for the executions was erected on the parvise of the opera house, the Comedy Square. In 1858, local sculptor [[Charles Pêtre]], then member of the [[Metz#The Metz School|School of Metz]] artistic movement, adorned its facade with allegories of the [[Tragedy]], the [[Artistic inspiration|Inspiration]], the [[Lyric Poetry]], the [[Comedy]], and the [[Music]]. The most recent restoration took place between 1981 and 1982 remodeling the interior of the opera house to improve comfort and sightlines. The performance hall had been reduced to 750 seats in 1963.

==Performance and cultural policy==
In the few years after its inauguration it staged several plays from the classic repertoire of the time, including those by [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Pierre Corneille]], and [[Molière]], whereas towards the end of the [[ancien regime]] more contemporary plays by [[Voltaire]], [[Marivaux]], [[Diderot]], and [[Beaumarchais]]. As far as opera was concerned, [[opéra comique]]s by [[Grétry]], and [[Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny|Montsigny]] were staged, as well as operas of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]].

Nineteenth century performances represented the work of both the major dramatists of the era (e.g., ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]] appearing just after its [[Paris]] [[premiere]]) and the major opera composers such as [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], and [[Donizetti]], as well as the [[grand opera]]s of [[Meyerbeer]], [[Fromental Halévy]], and [[Daniel Auber]]. During the season 1894-95, the theatre was presenting 187 events, of which 135 were in French and 52 in German.

The Metz Opera-Theater is fused in a unique [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] artistic pole with the [[Opéra national de Lorraine|National Opera of Lorraine]]. Today, the Opera-Theater features annually around sixty performances, including plays, choreographies, and lyric poetry.

'''''Seascape with Sharks and Dancer''''' is a 1974 play by [[Don Nigro]]. The story focuses on a young man, Ben, who saves a young woman named Tracy from the ocean outside his beach house. The struggle between his more tolerant approach to life and her fear of human relationships becomes the main conflict in the play.

This fine work in the Pendragon cycle of plays enjoyed a sold out, critically acclaimed production at the world famous [[Oregon Shakespeare Festival]].&lt;ref name=french&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samuelfrench.com/p/3841/seascape-with-sharks-and-dancer|title=Seascape with Sharks and Dancer|website=Samuel French | accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally produced at the Theatre Barn at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, in the spring of 1974, directed by Marya Bednerik.&lt;ref name=french /&gt; 

== Plot summary ==
The play begins on the night librarian/aspiring writer Ben rescues a beautiful naked woman, Tracy, from the ocean and brings her into his [[Cape Cod]] beach house to recuperate. Tracy claims it was not a suicide attempt but that she was [[dancing]] in the ocean. Ben doubts this but does his best to take care of her. Soon the two find that they have conflicting personalities, but try to work through them and gradually get closer to one another.  Ben is fascinated and amused by her feisty behavior and eccentric sense of humor and falls for her. Tracy's first impulse is to break their connection, out of fear of the pain of loving someone and then inevitably losing them. As the story continues we see them struggling to find a way to save their difficult relationship, which is constantly threatened by Tracy's serious trust issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/los-angeles/article/BWW-Reviews-SEASCAPE-WITH-SHARKS-AND-DANCER-examines-the-push-and-pull-in-relationships-200101019|title=BWW Reviews: SEASCAPE WITH SHARKS AND DANCER Examines the Push and Pull in Relationships|website=broadwayworld.com|last1=Barrett|first1=Shari}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a crisis involving the possibility of an unexpected pregnancy, Tracy is finally able to reveal the origins of her fear of attachment in her childhood horror at the meaningless suffering of innocent creatures. The indifference of the universe to the suffering of the innocent is embodied for her in the eyes of the sharks in the ocean. The relationship with Ben has brought to the surface all of her deepest anxieties and fears.&lt;ref name=french /&gt; 

== Themes ==

=== Love and Trust ===
"Seascape With Sharks and Dancer" looks at [[love]] and [[trust (emotion)|trust]] in a very unconventional way.  Although Ben and Tracy care about each other, and Ben outwardly shows his love for Tracy, past events in her life make it difficult for her to trust him.  She is constantly torn between her need for love and her fear of the pain it causes. In finally trusting Ben enough to open up to him and share her deepest and most secret fears, she's taken an important step towards creating a lasting relationship with him. But whether any trust between men and women is actually possible remains, at the end of the play, an open question. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of American Literature of the Sea &amp; Great Lakes|date=November 2000|publisher=Greenwood Press|page=405|last1=Gidmark|first1=Jill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7005">The '''Spring Racing Carnival''' is the name of an Australian [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing]] series held annually in [[Melbourne]] during October and November.

==The Carnival and its status in the wider community==
Although racing in [[Australia]] is held every day except [[Christmas]] Day, the [[Group One]] races in [[Melbourne]] are held almost exclusively throughout the carnival, which is traditionally placed between the [[Australian rules football|football]] and [[cricket]] seasons.  During the winter (where football is dominant), and summer (where cricket is dominant), racing takes a 'back seat' position in relation to the cricket or football in terms of [[mass media|media]] coverage and attendances.  However, in spring and autumn, the mass media turns its attention to the racing.  There is also an Autumn Racing Carnival, a time where Group One races are also held.

==Sweeps==
The carnival, and particularly the [[Melbourne Cup]] attracts the interest of many people otherwise uninterested in horse racing, and special forms of very low-stake gambling are often used for this event.  One common form for groups such as office staff is the "sweep", where each participant adds a small fee to a "pot" and draws the name of a horse like a raffle.  Prize money is distributed to the person who draws the winning horse (occasionally smaller prizes are awarded to placegetters and the last-placing horse).  A more complex and high-stakes form of the sweep is the "Calcutta", often held as a fundraising event for community organisations, which begins as in the sweep (though usually with a much higher initial stake), but which allows ticket holders to trade their tickets through an auction system.

==Special guests==
For the fashion part of the Spring Racing Carnival many special judges have come to the races.
2003: [[Paris Hilton]]
2004: [[Carson Kressley]]
2005: [[Eva Longoria]]
2006: [[Andrea Bowen]]

==Carnival race meetings==

'''Summer services''' ({{lang-fi|suviseurat}}, {{lang-sv|sommarmötet}}, {{lang-ru|Большое Летнее Собрание}}) is the annual meeting of the Finnish [[Lutheran]] movement known as [[Conservative Laestadianism|Conservative Laestadians]]. In addition to the primary Finnish gathering, similar meetings are arranged in North America, Sweden and Russia.

==Suviseurat in Finland==
'''Summer services''' (Finnish: '''Suviseurat''') is a large gathering of Laestadians in [[Finland]]. The event occurs every year at the end of June.  It is organized and hosted  by a Finnish [[Conservative Laestadianism]] association known as the Suomen rauhanyhdistysten keskusyhdistys (SRK). Summer services are among the most visited Finnish summer festivals and the largest spiritual meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Suomen ev.lut. kirkko: [http://www.evl.fi/sanasto/selitysL.htm#LESTADIOLAISUUS Aamenesta öylättiin – lestadiolaisuus] {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summer services are attended by tens of thousands of visitors from Finland, Russia, [[Estonia]], Sweden, Norway, United States, Canada and many other countries. The number of visitors reaches its peak usually on Saturday night, when the services have 80,000 simultaneous visitors.

Summer services take place over the course of four days, usually a Friday through Monday. The program consist mainly of sermons, [[Hymns and Songs of Zion|hymns and songs of Zion]]. The Summer services areas is about 100 hectares (270 acres).  The size of the event requires the need for loudspeakers to carry sermons to all of the listeners. On Saturday [[Eucharist#Lutheran|Holy Communion]] is offered and in the evening there is a presentation which is mainly for younger listeners. A gathering for pastors is also held during the Summer services.

The Summer Services take place in a different location every year. 2019 summer services in [[Muhos]] are 111th in order. Services were held in for the first time in 1906 with [[Oulu]] being the host city.

Recently, sermons have been broadcast via the Internet into many languages.&lt;ref&gt;SRK: [http://www.suviseurat.fi/2003/index.php_section=Piilo.Tervehdys_en.html SRK SUMMER SERVICES IN MUHOS JUNE 27-30, 2003 - BULLETIN]. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SRK: [http://www.suviseurat.fi/2007/hist-en.html The SRK Summer Services] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070630093239/http://www.suviseurat.fi/2007/hist-en.html |date=2007-06-30 }}. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summer services in North America==
[[image:Perhon juhlaportti.JPG|thumb|right|Festival gate of Perho summer services in 2005]]
Summer services in North America are arranged by members of the [[Laestadian Lutheran Church]].

They take place every year during the first weekend of July. They are mostly attended by North American guests, but some guests come from [[Finland]], [[Ecuador]], [[Togo]], and elsewhere.

The service schedule consists of devotional speeches and [[Songs and Hymns of Zion]].  The purpose of the services is to invite all people to hear the Word of God.  The core of the proclamation is the message of Jesus as the redeemer of sins and the call to repentance.

'''Super Bowl LVII''', the 57th [[Super Bowl]] and the 53rd [[AFL–NFL merger|modern-era]] [[National Football League]] (NFL) championship game, will decide the league champion for the 2022 NFL season. The game is scheduled to be played on February 5, 2023 at [[State Farm Stadium]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]] (with the exact date pending potential changes to the NFL calendar). It will be the fourth Super Bowl hosted by the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]], with the last one being [[Super Bowl XLIX]] in 2015, also held at State Farm Stadium (then University of Phoenix Stadium). The game will be televised nationally by [[Fox NFL|Fox]].&lt;ref name=sb57sitechosen&gt;{{cite web|last1=Teope|first1=Herbie|title=Arizona, New Orleans chosen as Super Bowl hosts|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000933935/article/arizona-new-orleans-chosen-as-super-bowl-hosts|publisher=NFL.com|accessdate=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Host-selection process==
A new process was introduced to select hosting sites for the Super Bowl, which began with [[Super Bowl LVI]]. The previous process that allowed teams to submit bids for the hosting rights was discarded. In its place, the league unilaterally chooses a single hosting site for each game, not allowing other teams to bid; the chosen team then puts together a proposal that is voted upon at the league's owner's meetings.

Arizona was the first team chosen under this process; its proposal was accepted unanimously on May 23, 2018.&lt;ref name=sb57sitechosen/&gt;

== Broadcasting ==
Super Bowl LVII will be broadcast by [[Fox NFL|Fox]], as part of the annual cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL. It is the last game in the league's current [[NFL on television|television contracts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hipes|first1=Patrick|title=Update: NBC, CBS And Fox Score Nine-Year NFL Extensions Taking Them To 2022|url=http://deadline.com/2011/12/nbc-and-nfl-extend-deal-through-2022-205160/|accessdate=May 26, 2018|work=Deadline.com|date=December 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6376">[[File:Fontana Drawing Giovanni e Paulo 1654.jpg|thumb|[[Carlo Fontana]]'s 1654 sketch of the theatre's floor plan]]
The '''Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo''' (often written as '''Teatro SS. Giovanni e Paolo''') was a theatre and [[opera house]] in [[Venice]] located on the Calle della Testa, and takes its name from the nearby [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice|Basilica of Santi Giovanni e Paolo]], Venice. Built by the [[Grimani]] family in 1638, in its heyday it was considered the most beautiful and comfortable theatre in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Rosand (2007) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre played an important role in the development of opera and saw the premieres of several works by [[Francesco Cavalli]], as well as [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]'s ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]'' and ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]''.
==History==
[[File:Anna Renzi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anna Renzi]] who sang Ottavia in the premiere of ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'']]
The [[Grimani]] family originally built the theatre as a wooden structure on the Fondamenta Nuove around 1635. It was then rebuilt on a grander scale using both stone and wood in 1638 when it moved to the nearby Calle della Testa. It was built primarily for the performance of spoken drama, but from the very beginning operas were also performed there. In fact, the new theatre was inaugurated on 20 January 1639 with the premiere performance of [[Francesco Manelli]]'s opera ''La Delia o sia La sera sposa del sole''.&lt;ref&gt;Casaglia&lt;/ref&gt; The librettist of ''La delia'', [[Giulio Strozzi]], became primarily based at the nearby [[Teatro Novissimo]] but returned to SS. Giovanni e Paolo for the 1642–1643 season, bringing with him the singers [[Barbara Strozzi]] and [[Anna Renzi]] (who sang Ottavia in the premiere of ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'') and the pioneering set designer [[Giacomo Torelli]]. According to Rosand, it may have been at Santi Giovanni e Paolo that Torelli developed his machinery for changing several sets simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Rosand (2007) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1654 the theatre was remodelled specifically as an opera house by the architect [[Carlo Fontana]] in one of his earliest commissions, and became the first fully developed horseshoe-shaped opera house in Italy,&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth (1985) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; a design which remained essentially unchanged for over two centuries. Its magnificent interior could seat about 900 people with five tiers of [[Box (theatre)|boxes]] and additional seating on the U-shaped floor (or ''platea'') in front of the stage. The theatre was described in 1663 by an observer as having:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...marvellous scene changes, majestic and grand appearances [of performers] ... and a magnificent flying machine; you see, as if commonplace, glorious heavens, deities, seas, royal palaces, woods, forests...&lt;ref&gt;Ringer (2006) p. 217 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Marco Faustini]]&lt;ref&gt;Marco Faustini's brother [[Giovanni Faustini]] was a well-known librettist, who for a time was also the impresario of two smaller Venetian opera houses, the [[Teatro San Cassiano]] and the [[Teatro San Moisè]].&lt;/ref&gt; became the theatre's [[impresario]] in 1660, and for the next fifteen years the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo and the Teatro di San Salvatore a San Luca (owned by the [[Vendramin]] family) were to be the dominant opera houses in Venice, each putting on two new operas every year.

By 1700, the Grimani family had built two more theatres in Venice, the [[Teatro San Samuele]] and the [[Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo]]. An economic crisis made the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo increasingly difficult to maintain, and it finally closed in 1715.&lt;ref&gt;Todarello (2006) p. 348. The Grimani family went on to build a fourth opera house, the [[Teatro San Benedetto]], in 1755.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premieres==

Wimbledon is one of the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tennis tournaments, the others being the [[Australian Open]], the [[French Open]] and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. Since the Australian Open shifted to [[hardcourt]] in 1988, Wimbledon is the only major still played on [[grass court|grass]].

The tournament traditionally took place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the last Monday in June and culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday and Sunday at the end of the second week. However recent changes to the tennis calendar have seen the event moved back by a week to begin in early July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wimbledon Championships moved back a week from 2015|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/18913701|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enhanced UK grass court season announced for 2017|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2016-04-07/enhanced_uk_grass_court_season_announced_for_2017.html|publisher=Wimbledon|accessdate=26 June 2017|date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place.

Wimbledon traditions include a strict dress code for competitors and Royal patronage. [[Strawberry#Uses|Strawberries and cream]] is traditionally consumed at the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wimbledon's strawberries and cream has Tudor roots|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/surrey/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8756000/8756132.stm|agency=BBC|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, fans consumed 34,000 kg of English strawberries and 10,000 litres of cream. The tournament is also notable for the absence of sponsor advertising around the courts. In 2009, Wimbledon's [[Centre Court]] was fitted with a [[retractable roof]] to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain.

== History ==
[[File:Spencer gore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Spencer Gore (sportsman)|Spencer Gore]], the winner of the [[1877 Wimbledon Championship|inaugural Wimbledon Championship]].]]

=== Beginning ===
The [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club]] is a private club founded on 23 July 1868, originally as "The All England Croquet Club". Its first ground was at Nursery Road off Worple Road, Wimbledon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/4462679.Anyone_for_a_game_of_sphairistik___/ "Anyone for a game of sphairistiké?"] 41, ''[[The Northern Echo]]'', 27 June 2009, accessed 8 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, [[Tennis|lawn tennis]], a game devised by Major [[Walter Clopton Wingfield]] a year or so earlier as an outdoor version of [[court tennis]] and originally given the name ''Sphairistikè'', was added to the activities of the club. In spring 1877, the club was renamed "The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club" and signalled its change of name by instituting the first Lawn Tennis Championship. A new code of laws, replacing the code administered by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], was drawn up for the event. Today's rules are similar except for details such as the height of the net and posts and the distance of the service line from the net.

The inaugural [[1877 Wimbledon Championship]] started on 9 July 1877 and the Gentlemen's Singles was the only event held. It was won by [[Spencer Gore (sportsman)|Spencer Gore]], an old Harrovian [[Rackets (sport)|rackets]] player, from a field of 22. About 200 spectators paid one shilling each to watch the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/1877.html|title=1877 Wimbledon Championships|accessdate=5 October 2010|publisher=Wimbledon.org|first=Ron|last=Atkin|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221222928/http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/1877.html|archivedate=21 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawns at the ground were arranged so that the principal court was in the middle with the others arranged around it, hence the title "[[Centre Court]]".{{efn|A Centre Court did not yet exist during the first four years of the championship.&lt;ref name=little&gt;{{cite book|last=Little|first=Alan|title=Wimbledon Compendium 2011|year=2011|publisher=All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club|location=London|isbn=978-1-899039-36-4|pages=9, 102|author=|edition=21st}}&lt;/ref&gt;|name=centrecourt}} The name was retained when the Club moved in 1922 to the present site in Church Road, although no longer a true description of its location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Malin Lundin|title=Throwback Thursday: The New Wimbledon|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2015-03-12/20150312_throwback_thursday_twins_in_tennis.html|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1980 four new courts were brought into commission on the north side of the ground, which meant the Centre Court was once more correctly described. The opening of the new No. 1 Court in 1997 emphasised the description.
[[File:1884 wimbledon ladies program.jpg|thumb|Ladies [[1884 Wimbledon Championships|Championship, 1884]]. First prize, awarded to [[Maud Watson]], was a silver flower-basket worth 20 [[guinea (British coin)|guineas]].]]
By 1882, activity at the club was almost exclusively confined to lawn tennis and that year the word "croquet" was dropped from the title. However, for sentimental reasons it was restored in 1899.

In 1884, the club added [[List of Wimbledon ladies' singles champions|Ladies' Singles]] and [[List of Wimbledon gentlemen's doubles champions|Gentlemen's Doubles]] competitions. [[List of Wimbledon ladies' doubles champions|Ladies' Doubles]] and [[List of Wimbledon mixed doubles champions|Mixed Doubles]] events were added in 1913. Until 1922, the reigning champion had to play only in the final, against whomever had won through to challenge him/her. As with the other three ''Major or Grand Slam'' events, Wimbledon was contested by top-ranked amateur players, professional players were prohibited from participating. This changed with the advent of the [[History of tennis|open era]] in 1968. No British man won the singles event at Wimbledon between [[Fred Perry]] in 1936 and [[Andy Murray]] in 2013, while no British woman has won since [[Virginia Wade]] in 1977, although [[Annabel Croft]] and [[Laura Robson]] won the Girls' Championship in [[1984 Wimbledon Championships|1984]] and [[2008 Wimbledon Championships|2008]] respectively. The Championship was first televised in 1937.

Though properly called "The Championships, Wimbledon", depending on sources the event is also known as "The All England Lawn Tennis Championships", "The Wimbledon Championships" or simply "Wimbledon". From 1912 to 1924, the tournament was recognized by the [[International Lawn Tennis Federation]] as the "World Grass Court Championships".

=== 21st century ===
Wimbledon is considered the world's premier tennis tournament and the priority of the Club is to maintain its leadership. To that end a long-term plan was unveiled in 1993, intended to improve the quality of the event for spectators, players, officials and neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Long Term Plan|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/about/long-term-plan|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=4 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315213309/http://www.wimbledon.com/about/long-term-plan|archivedate=15 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stage one (1994–1997) of the plan was completed for the 1997 championships and involved building the new No. 1 Court in Aorangi Park, a broadcast centre, two extra grass courts and a tunnel under the hill linking Church Road and Somerset Road. Stage two (1997–2009) involved the removal of the old No. 1 Court complex to make way for the new Millennium Building, providing extensive facilities for players, press, officials and members, and the extension of the West Stand of the Centre Court with 728 extra seats. Stage three (2000–2011) has been completed with the construction of an entrance building, club staff housing, museum, bank and ticket office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wimbledon.com/heritage/history/championships-history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601051854/http://www.wimbledon.com/heritage/history/championships-history|date=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new retractable roof was built in time for the 2009 championships, marking the first time that rain did not stop play for a lengthy time on [[Centre Court]]. The Club tested the new roof at an event called ''A Centre Court Celebration'' on Sunday, 17 May 2009, which featured exhibition matches involving [[Andre Agassi]], [[Steffi Graf]], [[Kim Clijsters]] and [[Tim Henman]]. The first Championship match to take place under the roof was the completion of the fourth round women's singles match between [[Dinara Safina]] and [[Amélie Mauresmo]].  The first match to be played in its entirety under the new roof took place between [[Andy Murray]] and [[Stanislas Wawrinka]] on 29 June 2009. Murray was also involved in the match completed latest in the day at Wimbledon, which ended at 11:02&amp;nbsp;pm in a victory over [[Marcos Baghdatis]] at Centre Court in the third round of the 2012 Championships. The 2012 Men's Singles Final on 8 July 2012, between [[Roger Federer]] and Murray, was the first singles final to be partially played under the roof, which was activated during the third set.{{efn|name=monday_final|To date only four finals were played on a Monday due to rain: [[1919 Wimbledon Championships|1919]], [[1922 Wimbledon Championships|1922]], [[1988 Wimbledon Championships|1988]] and [[2001 Wimbledon Championships|2001]].}}

A new 4000-seat [[No. 2 Court]] was built on the site of the old No. 13 Court in time for the 2009 Championships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/articles/2009-06-11/200906111244725616916.html New Court No. 2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620004403/http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/articles/2009-06-11/200906111244725616916.html |date=20 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A new 2000-seat [[No. 3 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 3 Court]] was built on the site of the old No. 2 and No. 3 Courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wimbledon.org/2010/03/26/the-new-court-3 |title=The New Court 3 |publisher=Blog.wimbledon.org |accessdate=14 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803031905/http://blog.wimbledon.org/2010/03/26/the-new-court-3/ |archivedate=3 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2011, the All England Club transferred all of its assets relating to The Championships to a separate though wholly owned subsidiary, The All England Lawn Tennis Club (Championships) Limited, also known as AELTC. Since that time, the Club's activities have been conducted separately from those of The Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/about_aeltc.html |title=About the AELTC |publisher=The All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2018, it was announced that a tie-break will be played if the score reaches 12&amp;ndash;12 in the final set of any match; this will apply to all competitions including in qualifying, singles and doubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/45913728|title=Wimbledon: Final set tie-breaks to be introduced in 2019|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 October 2018|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2018-10-19/aeltc_announces_introduction_of_final_set_tiebreak.html|title=AELTC announces introduction of final set tie-break|publisher=Wimbledon|date=19 October 2018|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In related statement, it was announced that starting at the 2019 Championships; Quad Wheelchair competitions would become a permanent event.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2018-11-09/aeltc_announces_referee_designate_and_championships_enhancements.html|title=AELTC announces Referee Designate and Championships enhancements

== Events ==
Wimbledon consists of five main events, four junior events and seven invitation events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/championships/competing |title=Wimbledon Event Guide |publisher=wimbledon.org |accessdate=12 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811091625/http://www.wimbledon.com/championships/competing |archivedate=11 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Main events ===

* Gentlemen's Wheelchair Doubles (4 pairs)&lt;ref name="Wheelchair"&gt;There are no age limits for the Wheelchair Doubles events.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ladies' Wheelchair Doubles (4 pairs)&lt;ref name="Wheelchair" /&gt;

=== Match formats ===
Matches in the Gentlemen's Singles and Gentlemen's Doubles are best-of-five sets; all other events are best-of-three sets.  Up to and including the 2018 tournament, a tiebreak game is played if the score reaches 6–6 in any set except the fifth (in a five-set match) or the third (in a three-set match), in which case a two-game lead must be reached. From the 2019 tournament onwards, a final set tiebreak game is played if the score in the final set reaches 12-12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/45913728 |title=Wimbledon: Final set tie-breaks to be introduced in 2019 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=19 October 2018 |website=BBC Sport |publisher= |accessdate=19 October 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All events are [[single-elimination tournament]]s,{{efn|name=single_elimination|In a single-elimination tournament, a losing player or team is eliminated from the tournament.}} except for the Gentlemen's, Senior Gentlemen's and the Ladies' Invitation Doubles, which are [[round-robin tournament]]s.

Until 1922, the winners of the previous year's competition (except in the Ladies' Doubles and Mixed Doubles) were automatically granted [[Bye (sports)|byes]] into the final round (then known as the challenge round). This led to many winners retaining their titles in successive years, as they were able to rest while their opponent competed from the start of the competition. From 1922, the prior year's champions were required to play all the rounds, like other tournament competitors.

== Schedule ==
Each year the tournament began on the last Monday in June, two weeks after the [[Queen's Club Championships]], which is one of the men's major warm-up tournaments, together with the [[Gerry Weber Open]], which is held in [[Halle, North Rhine-Westphalia|Halle, Germany]], during the same week. It was announced that the [[2017 Wimbledon Championships|2017 tournament]] would begin on Monday 3 July.&lt;ref name="dates"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dates|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/dates.html|website=Wimbledon|publisher=AELTC|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other grass-court tournaments before Wimbledon are [[Eastbourne International|Eastbourne]], England, and [[Rosmalen Grass Court Championships|Rosmalen]] in the Netherlands, both combining mixed events. The other women's warm-up tournament for Wimbledon is [[Birmingham Classic (tennis)|Birmingham]], also in England. The only grass-court tournament scheduled after the Championships is the [[Hall of Fame Tennis Championships]] at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], USA, which takes place the week after Wimbledon.

Wimbledon is scheduled for 14 days, beginning on a Monday and ending on a Sunday. Before 1982 it ended a day earlier, with the women's singles final on the Friday and the men's singles final on the Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/17/sports/wimbledon-switches-to-sunday-men-s-final.html Wimbledon Switches To Sunday Men's Final], [[New York Times]], October 17, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The five main events span both weeks, but the junior and invitational events are held mainly during the second week.  Traditionally, unlike the other three tennis Grand Slams, there is no play on the "Middle Sunday", which is considered a rest day.  However, rain has forced play on the Middle Sunday four times, in 1991, 1997, 2004 and 2016. On the first of these four occasions, Wimbledon staged a "People's Sunday", with unreserved seating and readily available, inexpensive tickets, allowing those with more limited means to sit on the show courts.

The second Monday at Wimbledon is often called "Manic Monday", because it is the busiest day with the last-16 matches for both men's and women's singles, where fans have a pick of watching on a single day, any of the best 32 players left; which is also unique in a Grand Slam singles competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/wimbledon-2017-manic-monday-what-is-it-court-times-roger-federer-andy-murray-rafael-nadal-novak-a7833151.html |title=Wimbledon 2017: What is Manic Monday |date=July 12, 2017|work=The Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2015, the championships have begun one week later than in previous years, extending the gap between the tournament and the [[French Open]] from two to three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wimbledon Championships moved back a week from 2015|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/18913701|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 September 2012|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally the [[Stuttgart Open]] men's tournament converted to a grass surface and was rescheduled from July to June, extending the grass court season.

== Players and seeding ==
Both the men's and ladies' singles consist of 128 players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ: Facts and Figures|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336574376496.html|publisher=Wimbledon|accessdate=27 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419022018/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336574376496.html|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players and doubles pairs are admitted to the main events on the basis of their international rankings, with 104 direct entries into the men's and 108 into the ladies' competitions. Both tournaments have 8 [[Wild card (sports)#Professional tennis|wild card]] entrants, with the remainder in each made up of qualifiers. Since the 2001 tournament, 32 players have been given [[Seed (sports)|seedings]] in the Gentlemen's and Ladies' singles, 16 teams in the doubles events. The system of seeding was introduced during the [[1924 Wimbledon Championships]]. This was a simplified version allowing countries to nominate four players who were placed in different quarters of the draw. This system was replaced for the [[1927 Wimbledon Championships]] and from then on players were seeded on merit. The first players to be seeded as no. 1 were [[René Lacoste]] and [[Helen Wills]].&lt;ref name=compendium2013&gt;{{cite book|last=Little|first=Alan|title=2013 Wimbledon Compendium|edition=23rd|date=2013|publisher=The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|location=London|pages=163, 164, 200|isbn=978-1-899039-40-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee of Management decide which players receive wildcards. Usually, wild cards are players who have performed well during previous tournaments or would stimulate public interest in Wimbledon by participating. The only wild card to win the Gentlemen's Singles Championship was [[Goran Ivanišević]] in 2001. Players and pairs who neither have high enough rankings nor receive wild cards may participate in a qualifying tournament held one week before Wimbledon at the [[Bank of England]] Sports Ground in [[Roehampton]]. The singles qualifying competitions are three-round events. From 2019 singles qualification will increase to 128 players and no doubles qualification will occur. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Previously the same-sex doubles competitions lasted for only two rounds. There is no qualifying tournament for Mixed Doubles. The furthest that any qualifier has progressed in a Singles tournament is the semi-final round: [[John McEnroe]] in 1977 (Gentlemen's Singles), [[Vladimir Voltchkov]] in 2000 (Gentlemen's Singles), and [[Alexandra Stevenson]] in 1999 (Ladies' Singles).

Players are admitted to the junior tournaments upon the recommendations of their national tennis associations, on their [[International Tennis Federation]] world rankings and, in the case of the singles events, on the basis of a qualifying competition. The Committee of Management determines which players may enter the four invitational events.

The Committee seeds the top players and pairs on the basis of their rankings, but it can change the seedings based on a player's previous grass court performance. Since 2002 a seeding committee has not been required for the Gentlemen's Singles following an agreement with the ATP. While the seeds are still the top 32 players according to rankings, the seeding order is determined using the formula: ATP Entry System Position points + 100% points earned for all grass court tournaments in the past 12 months + 75% points earned for the best grass court tournament in the 12 months before that.&lt;ref name=seedingexplained&gt;{{cite news |last=Tebbutt |first=Tom |date=16 June 2010 |title=Explaining Wimbledon's seeding method |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/more-sports/explaining-wimbledons-seeding-method/article4322158/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |access-date=17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of the entrants are unseeded. Only two unseeded players have won the Gentlemen's Singles: [[Boris Becker]] in 1985 and [[Goran Ivanišević]] in 2001. In 1985 there were only 16 seeds and Becker was ranked 20th; Ivanišević was ranked 125th when he won as a Wild Card entrant, although he had previously been a finalist three times, and been ranked no. 2 in the world; his low ranking was due to having been hampered by a persistent shoulder injury for three years, which had only just cleared up. In 1996, the title was won by [[Richard Krajicek]], who was originally unseeded (ranked 17th, and only 16 players were seeded) but was promoted to a seeded position (still with the number 17) when Thomas Muster withdrew before the tournament. No unseeded player has captured the Ladies' Singles title; the lowest seeded female champion was [[Venus Williams]], who won in 2007 as the 23rd seed; Williams was returning from an injury that had prevented her playing in previous tournaments, giving her a lower ranking than she would normally have had. Unseeded pairs have won the doubles titles on numerous occasions; the 2005 Gentlemen's Doubles champions were not only unseeded, but also (for the first time ever) qualifiers.

== Grounds ==
[[File:cmglee London Wimbledon Championships venue aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the grounds]]
{{Main|All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club}}

Since 2001, the courts used for Wimbledon have been sown with 100% [[ryegrass|perennial ryegrass]]. Prior to 2001 a combination of 70% ryegrass and 30% [[Creeping Red Fescue]] was used. The change was made to improve durability and strengthen the sward to better withstand the increasing wear of the modern game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wimbledon – Grass Courts|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/news/media-centre/grass-courts|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wimbledon grass |url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336575251545.html |publisher=Wimbledon Championship |accessdate=7 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507105351/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336575251545.html |archivedate= 7 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main show courts, [[Centre Court]] and [[No. 1 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 1 Court]], are normally used for only two weeks a year, during the Championships, but play can extend into a third week in exceptional circumstances. The remaining 17 courts are regularly used for other events hosted by the Club. The show courts were in action for the second time in three months in 2012 as Wimbledon hosted the tennis events of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]]. One of the show courts is also used for home ties of the GB teams in the [[Davis Cup]] on occasions.

Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam event played on grass courts. At one time, all the Majors, except the French Open, were played on grass. The [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] abandoned grass in 1975 and the Australian Open in 1988.

The principal court, [[Centre Court]], was opened in 1922 when the Club moved from Worple Road to Church Road. The Church Road venue was larger and was needed to meet the ever-growing public demand.
[[File:Wimbledon order of play.jpg|thumb|left|The order of play for all courts is displayed on boards around the grounds]]
Due to the possibility of rain during Wimbledon, a retractable roof was installed prior to the 2009 Championship. It is designed to close/open in about 20 minutes and will be closed primarily to protect play from inclement (and, if necessary, extremely hot) weather during The Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336573017483.html |title=Wimbledon – Centre Court roof |publisher=[[AELTC]] |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the roof is being opened or closed, play is suspended. The first time the roof was closed during a Wimbledon Championship match was on Monday 29 June 2009, involving [[Amélie Mauresmo]] and [[Dinara Safina]]. The first full match played and completed under the roof featured [[Andy Murray]] and [[Stan Wawrinka]], played on the same date. 

The court has a capacity of 15,000. At its south end is the Royal Box, from which members of the Royal Family and other dignitaries watch matches. Centre Court usually hosts the finals and semifinals of the main events, as well as many matches in the earlier rounds involving top-seeded players or local favourites.

The second most important court is [[No. 1 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 1 Court]]. The court was constructed in 1997 to replace the old No.1 Court, which was adjacent to Centre Court.  The old No.1 Court was demolished because its capacity for spectators was too low. The court was said to have had a unique, more intimate atmosphere and was a favourite of many players. The new No.1 Court has a capacity of approximately 11,000. Construction on a new retractable roof on the No.1 Court began after the 2017 Championships and is set to be completed in 2019. The capacity of the stadium is also set to rise by 900 taking the total capacity up to 12,400.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skysports.com/tennis/news/12110/10259950/wimbledon-reveals-plans-for-new-look-70m-no-1-court&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009, a new [[No. 2 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 2 Court]] is being used at Wimbledon with a capacity for 4,000 people. To obtain [[planning permission]], the playing surface is around 3.5m below ground level, ensuring that the single-storey structure is only about 3.5m above ground level, and thus not affecting local views.&lt;ref name="Wim 18"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aeltc.com/cms/media/pressreleases/no2_24_04_07.aspx |title=Tickets – 2013 Wimbledon Championships Website – Official Site by IBM |publisher=[[AELTC]].com |date=|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to build on the current site of Court 13 were dismissed due to the high capacity of games played at the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]]. The old No.2 Court has been renamed as [[No. 3 Court (Wimbledon)|No.3 Court]]. The old No.2 Court was known as the "Graveyard of Champions" because many highly seeded players were eliminated there during early rounds over the years, including [[Ilie Năstase]], [[John McEnroe]], [[Boris Becker]], [[Andre Agassi]], [[Pete Sampras]], [[Martina Hingis]], [[Venus Williams]], [[Serena Williams]] and [[Maria Sharapova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wimbledontennis.wordpress.com/2009/05/26/how-the-graveyard-of-champions-got-its-name/ |title=How the ‘Graveyard of champions’ got its name |publisher=Blog.wimbledon.org |accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court has a capacity of 2,192 + 770 standing. In 2011 a new No.3 Court and a new Court 4 were unveiled on the sites of the old No.2 and 3 courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aeltc.com/cms/debentures/about/longtermplan.aspx |title=Wimbledon Debentures – About Debentures – The Long Term Plan |publisher=[[AELTC]].com |accessdate=26 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608080457/http://www.aeltc.com/cms/debentures/about/longtermplan.aspx |archivedate=8 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wimbledon court No. 1.JPG|thumb|View from seats of Wimbledon Court No. 1]]
Because of the summer climate in southern England, Wimbledon employs 'Court Attendants' each year, who work to maintain court conditions. Their principal responsibility is to ensure that the courts are quickly covered when it begins to rain, so that play can resume as quickly as possible once the referees decide to uncover the courts. The court attendants are mainly university students working to make summer money. Centre Court is covered by full-time groundstaff, however.

At the northern end of the grounds is a giant television screen on which important matches are broadcast. Fans watch from an area of grass officially known as the [[Aorangi Terrace]]. When British players do well at Wimbledon, the hill attracts fans for them, and is often renamed after them by the press: [[Greg Rusedski]]'s followers convened at "Rusedski Ridge", and [[Tim Henman]] has had the hill nicknamed [[Henman Hill]]. As both of them have now retired and [[Andy Murray]] is the number 1 British player, the hill is occasionally referred to as "Murray Mound" or "[[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]]", as a reference to his Scottish heritage and the Scottish rugby ground of the same name, but this has largely failed to catch on – the area is still usually referred to as Henman Hill. None of these nicknames are official.

=== Bank of England Sports Centre ===

The qualifying matches, prior to the main draw, take place at the Bank of England Sports Ground, in [[Roehampton]], {{convert|3.6|mi|km|1}} from the All-England Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/qualifying.html |title=Qualifying – Information on The Championships Qualifying Competition |publisher=Wimbledon |accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditions ==
[[File:Wimbledon Court 10 2004 RJL.JPG|thumb|Court 10 – on the outside courts there is no reserved seating]]

Social commentator Ellis Cashmore describes Wimbledon as having "a [[David Niven]]-ish propriety", conforming to the standards of behaviour common in the 1950s. Writer [[Peter York]] sees the event as representing a particular white and affluent type of Britishness, describing the area of Wimbledon as "a southern, well off, late-Victorian suburb with a particular social character". Cashmore has criticised the event for being "remote and insulated" from the changing multicultural character of modern Britain, describing it as "nobody's idea of all-things-British".&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/06/25/sport/tennis/tennis-wimbledon-preview-york-olympics-identity/index.html|title=Game, set and match: What Wimbledon says about the British – CNN.com|first=By James Montague|last=CNN|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ball boys and ball girls ===
In the championship games, [[ball boy]]s and girls, known as BBGs, play a crucial role in the smooth running of the tournament, with a brief that a good BBG "should not be seen. They should blend into the background and get on with their jobs quietly."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/core/Content/displayPrintable.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/06/29/ftballs29.xml&amp;site=6&amp;page=0 Strawberries, cream and BBGs]. ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London), 29 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1947 ball boys were supplied by Goldings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldonian.org/wimbledon/goldings_ballboys.htm |title=Goldings Ballboys |publisher=Goldonian.org |date=26 June 2004 |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only [[Barnardos]] school to provide them. Prior to this, from the 1920s onwards, the ball boys had been provided by [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|The Shaftesbury Children's Home]].
[[File:Wimbledon ballgirl 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Wimbledon ball girl at the net, 2007]]
Since 1969, BBGs have been provided by local schools. As of 2008 they are drawn from schools in the London boroughs of [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]], [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]], [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], and [[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth]], as well as from [[Surrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ball Boys and Ball Girls|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/ball_boys_and_ball_girls.html|website=www.wimbledon.com|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, Wandsworth Boys Grammar School in Sutherland Grove, Southfields and Mayfield Girls School on [[West Hill, Wandsworth|West Hill]] in Wandsworth, both now defunct, were the schools of choice for selection of BBGs. This was possibly owing to their proximity to the club. BBGs have an average age of 15, being drawn from the school years [[Year Nine|nine]] and [[Year Ten|ten]].&lt;ref name="Official Site"&gt;[http://www.aeltc.com/CMS/BBG/background.aspx Official Site] Ballboys and Ballgirls Background Information&lt;/ref&gt; BBGs will serve for one, or if re-selected, up to five tournaments, from Year Nine to Year Thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336572473808.html Official Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507113749/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336572473808.html |date=7 May 2013 }} About the Ball Boys and Girls&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2005, BBGs work in teams of six, two at the net, four at the corners, and teams rotate one hour on court, one hour off, (two hours depending on the court) for the day's play.&lt;ref name="Official Site" /&gt; Teams are not told which court they will be working on the day, to ensure the same standards across all courts. With the expansion of the number of courts, and lengthening the tennis day, as of 2008, the number of BBGs required is around 250. From the second Wednesday, BBGs are told to leave the Championships, leaving around 80 on the final Sunday. Each BBG receives a certificate, a can of used balls, a group photograph and a programme when leaving. BBG service is paid, with a total of £120-£180 being paid to each ball boy
or girl after the 13-day period depending on the number of days served. Every BBG keeps all of their kit, typically consisting of three or four shirts, two or three shorts or [[skorts]], track suit bottoms and top, twelve pairs of socks, three pairs of wristbands, a hat, water bottle holder, bag and trainers. Along with this it is seen as a privilege, and seen as a valuable addition to a school leaver's [[curriculum vitae]], showing discipline. BBG places are split 50:50 between boys and girls, with girls having been used since 1977, appearing on centre court since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Wimbledon – Behind the scenes – Ball boys and ball girls|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/behind_the_scenes/201205091336567795051.html|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prospective BBGs are first nominated by their school [[headteacher]], to be considered for selection. To be selected, a candidate must pass written tests on the rules of tennis, and pass fitness, mobility and other suitability tests, against initial preliminary instruction material. Successful candidates then commence a training phase, starting in February, in which the final BBGs are chosen through continual assessment. As of 2008, this training intake was 600. The training includes weekly sessions of physical, procedural and theoretical instruction, to ensure that the BBGs are fast, alert, self-confident and adaptable to situations. As of 2011, early training occurs at the Wimbledon All England Lawn Tennis Club Covered Courts, to the side of the Grounds, and then moves to outside courts (8, 9, 10) the week before the Championships for a feel of the grass court.

=== Colours and uniforms ===
[[File:Wimbledon Grojean 2004 RJL.JPG|thumb|[[Sébastien Grosjean]] takes a shot on Court 18 during the [[2004 Wimbledon Championships|2004 Championships]].]]
Dark green and purple are the traditional Wimbledon colours. However, all tennis players participating in the tournament are required to wear all-white or at least almost all-white clothing, a long-time tradition at Wimbledon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Game and All Set for a Match: Wimbledon and our Inner Tennis Player|url=http://www.thegreenrooms.net/research-and-articles/game-and-all-set-for-a-match-wimbledon-and-our-inner-tennis-player/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140115104417/http://www.thegreenrooms.net/research-and-articles/game-and-all-set-for-a-match-wimbledon-and-our-inner-tennis-player/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 January 2014|publisher=The Green Rooms|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=clothing_guidelines|Guidelines regarding the prominently-white clothing rule include no solid mass of colouring; coloured trims not to exceed 1&amp;nbsp;cm; shirt or dress backs to be totally white; all other items of clothing, including shorts, shirts, caps, headbands, socks, and shoe uppers to be predominantly white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/clothing_and_equipment.html | work=Wimbledon | title=Clothing and equipment | access-date=12 July 2016 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712041512/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/clothing_and_equipment.html | archivedate=12 July 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Wearing white clothing with some colour accents is also acceptable, provided the colour scheme is not that of an identifiable commercial brand logo (the outfitter's brand logo being the sole exception). Controversy followed [[Martina Navratilova]]'s wearing branding for "Kim" cigarettes in 1982. Green clothing was worn by the chair umpire, linesmen, ball boys and ball girls until the 2005 Championships; however, beginning with the 2006 Championships, officials, ball boys and ball girls were dressed in new navy blue- and cream-coloured uniforms from American designer [[Ralph Lauren]]. This marked the first time in the history of the Championships that an outside company was used to design Wimbledon clothing; the contract with [[Polo Ralph Lauren]] ended in 2015.

=== Referring to players ===
By tradition, the "Men's" and "Women's" competitions are referred to as "Gentlemen's" and "Ladies'" competitions at Wimbledon. The junior competitions are referred to as the "Boys'" and "Girls'" competitions.

Prior to 2009 female players were referred to by the title "Miss" or "Mrs" on scoreboards. As dictated by strict rule of etiquette, married female players are referred to by their husbands' names: for example, [[Chris Evert]] appeared on scoreboards as "Mrs. J. M. Lloyd" during her marriage to [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]], since [[Coverture#Outside the legal realm|"Mrs. X" essentially designates the wife of X]]. This tradition has continued at least to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;"Mrs. P-Y Hardenne" is used to describe Justine Henin. See {{cite web |url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/roll_of_honour/ladies-singles.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507103844/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/roll_of_honour/ladies-singles.html |archivedate=7 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time during the 2009 tournament, players were referred to on scoreboards by both their first and last names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why has Wimbledon dropped 'Miss'?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8126223.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|date=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title "Mr" is not used for male players who are professionals on scoreboards but the prefix is retained for amateurs, although chair umpires refer to players as "Mr" when they use the replay challenge. The chair umpire will say "Mr &lt;surname&gt; is challenging the call..." and "Mr &lt;surname&gt; has X challenges remaining."   However, the umpires still say Miss/Missus &lt;surname&gt; when announcing the score of the Ladies' matches.

If a match is being played with two competitors of the same surname (e.g. Venus and Serena Williams, Bob and Mike Bryan), the chair umpire will specify to whom they are referring by stating the player's first name and surname during announcements (e.g. "Game, Miss Venus Williams", "Advantage, Mike Bryan").

=== Royal family ===
[[File:The Royal Gallery at Centre Court, Wimbledon.jpg|thumb|right|The Royal Gallery at Centre Court, Wimbledon]]
Previously, players bowed or curtsied to members of the [[British Royal Family|royal family]] seated in the Royal Box upon entering or leaving Centre Court. However, in 2003, All England Club president [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]] decided to discontinue the tradition. Now, players are required to bow or curtsy only if The [[Prince of Wales]], or [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] is present,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336583247824.html |title=Wimbledon – The Royal Box |publisher=[[AELTC]] | website=www.wimbledon.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; as was in practice during the 2010 Championships when the Queen was in attendance at Wimbledon on 24 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Eden |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/andymurray/7728927/Advantage-Andy-Murray-as-the-Queen-visits-Wimbledon.html |title=Advantage Andy Murray as the Queen visits Wimbledon |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=15 May 2010 |accessdate=26 July 2010 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524010028/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/andymurray/7728927/Advantage-Andy-Murray-as-the-Queen-visits-Wimbledon.html |archivedate=24 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 27 June 2012, Roger Federer said in his post-match interview that he and his opponent had been asked to bow towards the Royal Box as Prince Charles and his wife were present, saying that it wasn't a problem for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://espn.go.com/tennis/wimbledon12/story/_/id/8101137/wimbledon-2012-roger-federer-wins-prince-charles | work=ESPN | title=Roger Federer advances to 3rd round | date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Services stewards ===
Prior to the Second World War, members of the [[Brigade of Guards]] and retired members of the [[Royal Artillery]] performed the role of stewards. In 1946 the AELTC offered employment to wartime servicemen returning to civilian life during their demobilisation leave. Initially, this scheme extended only to the Royal Navy, followed by the Army in 1947 and the Royal Air Force in 1949. In 1965 London Fire Brigade members joined the ranks of stewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ArmyWestMidlands/posts/590494050995421 |title=Follow my blog as a steward at Wimbledon |publisher=Army West Midlands }}&lt;/ref&gt; The service stewards, wearing uniform, are present in Centre Court and No.'s 1, 2, 3, 12 and 18 courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hamilton |first=Leigh |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/wimbledon-fans-show-pride-in-armed-forces |title=Wimbledon fans show pride in Armed Forces |work=Defence News |date=2 July 2010 |accessdate=10 July 2016 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, 595 Service and London Fire Brigade stewards attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/faq_and_facts_and_figures.html |title=Wimbledon – Facts and Figures |publisher=[[AELTC]] | website=www.wimbledon.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only enlisted members of the Armed Forces may apply for the role, which must be taken as leave, and half of each year's recruits must have stewarded at Wimbledon before. The AELTC pays a subsistence allowance to servicemen and women working as stewards to defray their accommodation costs for the period of the Championships. The Service Stewards are not to be confused with the 185 Honorary Stewards.

=== Tickets ===
[[File:WimbledonResaleTicket2016.jpg|thumb|right|Wimbledon operates a ticket resale system where returned Show Court tickets can be purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ticket Resale Kiosk|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/ticket_resale_kiosk.html|website=www.wimbledon.com|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All proceeds go to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ticket Resale – where does it go?|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2015-07-27/ticket_resale_where_does_it_go.html|website=www.wimbledon.com|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=21 August 2016|date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The majority of centre and show court tickets sold to the general public have since 1924 been made available by a public ballot that the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club holds at the start of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballot|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/tickets/201205091336562669724.html|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=25 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219172911/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/tickets/201205091336562669724.html|archivedate=19 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ballot has always been substantially oversubscribed. Successful applicants are selected at random by a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tickets|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/tickets/index.html|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent figures from 2011 suggested there were four applicants to every ballot ticket. Applications must be posted to arrive at the AELTC by the last day of December in the year prior to the tournament. Seats and days are allocated randomly and ballot tickets are not transferrable.

The All England Club, through its subsidiary The All England Lawn Tennis Ground plc, issues [[Debentures]] to tennis fans every five years to raise funds for capital expenditure. Fans who invest thus in the club receive a pair of tickets for every day of the Wimbledon Championships for the five years the investment lasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeltc.com/cms/debentures/about/About.aspx |title=Wimbledon Debentures – About Debentures – About Wimbledon Debentures |publisher=[[AELTC]].com |accessdate=26 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723005314/http://www.aeltc.com/cms/debentures/about/About.aspx |archivedate=23 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only debenture holders are permitted to sell on their tickets to third parties and demand for debentures has increased in recent years, to such an extent that they are even traded on the [[London Stock Exchange]].

Wimbledon and the French Open are the only Grand Slam tournaments where fans without tickets for play can queue up and still get seats on the three show courts on the day of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rolandgarros.fft-tickets.com/uk/information/ticket-info/evening-visitors |title=Evening Visitors &amp;#124; Le site officiel de la billetterie Roland-Garros 2013 |publisher=Rolandgarros.fft-tickets.com |date=|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sequentially numbered queue cards were introduced in 2003. From 2008, there is a single queue, allotted about 500 seats for each court. When they join the queue, fans are handed queue cards. Anyone who then wishes to leave the queue temporarily, even if in possession of a queue card, must agree their position with the others nearby in the queue and/or a steward.

To get access to the show courts, fans will normally have to queue overnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.nationmultimedia.com/natee/2007/07/16/entry-1 |title=Natee's Blog |publisher=Blog.nationmultimedia.com |date= |accessdate=6 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714160621/http://blog.nationmultimedia.com/natee/2007/07/16/entry-1 |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by fans from all over the world and, although considered vagrancy, is part of the Wimbledon experience in itself. The All-England Club allows overnight queuing and provides toilet and water facilities for campers. Early in the morning when the line moves towards the Grounds, stewards walk along the line and hand out wristbands that are colour-coded to the specific court. The wrist band (and payment) is exchanged at the ticket office for the ticket when the grounds open. General admission to the grounds gives access to the outer courts and is possible without queuing overnight. Tickets returned by people leaving early go on sale at 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm and the money goes to charity. Queuing for the show courts ends after the quarter finals have been completed.

At 2.40pm on Day Seven (Monday 28 June) of the [[2010 Wimbledon Championships|2010 Championships]], the one-millionth numbered Wimbledon queue card was handed out to Rose Stanley from South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Championships  – Day Nine Diary|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2010/06/Wimbledon/Wimbledon-Diary-Day-Nine.aspx?|website=www.atpworldtour.com|publisher=ATP|date=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=John Martin|title=For Many Wimbledon Fans, the Waiting Is Not the Hardest Part|url=http://straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/03/for-many-wimbledon-fans-the-wait-is-worth-it/|website=straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times|date=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sponsorship ===
Wimbledon is notable for the longest running sponsorship in sports history due to its association with [[Slazenger]] who have supplied all tennis balls during the tournament since 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At 113 Years and Counting, Slazenger Maintains the Longest Sponsorship in Sports|url=http://www.sesponsorshipgroup.com/sponsorship-figures/2015/11/3/at-113-years-and-counting-slazenger-maintains-the-longest-sponsorship-in-sports|publisher=S&amp;E Sponsorship Group|date=4 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617070504/http://www.sesponsorshipgroup.com/sponsorship-figures/2015/11/3/at-113-years-and-counting-slazenger-maintains-the-longest-sponsorship-in-sports|archivedate=17 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1935 Wimbledon has a sponsorship association with the [[Robinsons (drink)|Robinsons]] fruit drink brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wimbledon and Robinsons: charting 79 years of a fruitful relationship|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/1300801/wimbledon-robinsons-charting-79-years-fruitful-relationship#|publisher=Campaign|date=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It operated under a [[Restricted Service Licence]]. Presenters included Sam Lloyd and Ali Barton. Typically they worked alternate four-hour shifts until the end of the last match of the day. Reporters and commentators included Gigi Salmon, Nick Lestor, Rupert Bell, Nigel Bidmead, Guy Swindells, Lucie Ahl, Nadine Towell and Helen Whitaker. Often they reported from the "Crow's Nest", an elevated building housing the Court 3 and 4 scoreboards which affords views of most of the outside courts. Regular guests included Sue Mappin. In later years Radio Wimbledon acquired a second low-power FM frequency (within the grounds only) of 96.3 FM for uninterrupted Centre Court commentary, and, from 2006, a third for coverage from No. 1 Court on 97.8 FM. Hourly news bulletins and travel (using [[Radio Data System|RDS]]) were also broadcast.

Beginning with the [[2018 Wimbledon Championships|2018 tournament]], an in-house operation known as Wimbledon Broadcasting Services (WBS) has served as the official host broadcaster of the tournament, replacing [[BBC Sport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/wimbledon-to-launch-in-house-host-broadcaster|title=Wimbledon to launch in-house host broadcaster|access-date=2018-07-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1937 the [[BBC]] has broadcast the tournament on television in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sarah Kirkham|title=Throwback Thursday: The first Wimbledon on television|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2015-02-05/throwback_thursday_the_first_wimbledon_on_television.html|website=www.wimbledon.com|publisher=[[All England Lawn Tennis Club|AELTC]]|date=5 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205210241/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2015-02-05/throwback_thursday_the_first_wimbledon_on_television.html|archivedate=5 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=bbccoverage|During the first year of television coverage in 1937 the BBC used two cameras at the Centre Court to transmit matches for a maximum of half an hour a day. The first match to be broadcast was between [[Bunny Austin]] and [[George Lyttleton-Rogers]].&lt;ref name=little2013&gt;{{cite book|last=Little|first=Alan|title=Wimbledon Compendium 2013|year=2013|publisher=All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club|location=London|isbn=978-1-899039-40-1|page=483|author=|edition=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The matches covered are primarily split between its two main terrestrial channels, [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]], and their Red Button service. This can result in live matches being moved across all 3 channels. The BBC holds the broadcast rights for Wimbledon until 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/bbc-all-england-club-wimbledon-2024 |title=BBC and All England Club extend contract to broadcast Wimbledon until 2024 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=17 November 2016 |accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the days of [[British Satellite Broadcasting]], its sports channel carried extra coverage of Wimbledon for subscribers. One of the most notable British commentators was [[Dan Maskell]], who was known as the BBC's "voice of tennis" until his retirement in 1991. [[John Barrett (tennis)|John Barrett]] succeeded him in that role until he retired in 2006. Current commentators working for the BBC at Wimbledon include British ex-players [[Andrew Castle]], [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]], [[Tim Henman]], [[Greg Rusedski]], [[Samantha Smith (tennis)|Samantha Smith]] and [[Mark Petchey]]; tennis legends such as [[John McEnroe]], [[Tracy Austin]], [[Boris Becker]] and [[Lindsay Davenport]]; and general sports commentators including [[David Mercer (broadcaster)|David Mercer]], [[Barry Davies]], [[Andrew Cotter]] and [[Nick Mullins]]. The coverage is presented by [[Sue Barker]] (live) and [[Claire Balding]] (highlights). Previous BBC presenters include [[Des Lynam]], [[David Vine]], [[John Inverdale]] and [[Harry Carpenter]].

The Wimbledon Finals are obliged to be shown live and in full on terrestrial television (BBC Television Service, ITV, Channel 4, or Channel 5) by government mandate. Highlights of the rest of the tournament must be provided by terrestrial stations; live coverage (excepting the finals) may be sought by satellite or cable TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/PDF/sport_on_television.pdf |title=Coverage of Sport on Television |format=PDF |publisher=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport|DCMS]] |accessdate=26 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415173542/http://www.culture.gov.uk/PDF/sport_on_television.pdf |archivedate=15 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC was forced to apologise after many viewers complained about "over-talking" by its commentary team during the TV coverage of the event in 2011. It said in a statement that views on commentary were subjective but that they "do appreciate that over-talking can irritate our audience". The BBC added that it hoped it had achieved "the right balance" across its coverage and was "of course sorry if on occasion you have not been satisfied". [[Tim Henman]] and [[John McEnroe]] were among the ex-players commentating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC sorry for 'over-talking' Wimbledon commentators|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14026985|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wimbledon was also involved in a piece of television history, when on 1 July 1967 the first official [[colour television]] broadcast took place in the UK. Four hours live coverage of the [[1967 Wimbledon Championships|1967 Championships]] was shown on BBC Two, which was the first television channel in Europe to regularly broadcast in colour. Footage of that historic match no longer survives, however, the Gentlemen's Final of that year is still held in the BBC archives because it was the first Gentlemen's Final transmitted in colour. Since 2007, Wimbledon matches have been transmitted in [[High-definition television|high-definition]], originally on the BBC's free-to-air channel [[BBC HD]], with continual live coverage during the tournament of Centre Court and Court No. 1 as well as an evening highlights show ''[[Today at Wimbledon]]''.  Coverage is now shown on BBC One and Two's HD feeds. Beginning 2018, all centre court matches are televised in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra-high-definition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techradar.com/how-to/wimbledon-in-4k-the-best-ways-to-catch-the-tennis-action-in-ultra-hd|title=Wimbledon in 4K: the best ways to catch the tennis action in Ultra HD|work=TechRadar|access-date=2018-07-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC's opening theme music for Wimbledon was composed by [[Keith Mansfield]] and is titled "Light and Tuneful". A piece titled "A Sporting Occasion" is the traditional closing theme, though nowadays coverage typically ends either with a montage set to a popular song or with no music at all. Mansfield also composed the piece "World Champion", used by NBC during intervals (change-overs, set breaks, etc.) and at the close of broadcasts throughout the tournament.

==== Ireland ====
In Ireland, [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] broadcast the tournament during the 1980s and 1990s on their second channel [[RTÉ Two]], they also provided highlights of the games in the evening. The commentary provided was given by Matt Doyle a former Irish-American professional tennis player and Jim Sherwin a former RTÉ newsreader. Caroline Murphy was the presenter of the programme. RTÉ made the decision in 1998 to discontinue broadcasting the tournament due to falling viewing figures and the large number of viewers watching on the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/1998/0708/98070800158.html|title=Tennis – set for change?|date=8 July 1998|work=The Irish Times |accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2005 until 2014 [[TG4]] Ireland's Irish-language broadcaster provided coverage of the tournament. Live coverage was provided in the [[Irish language]] while they broadcast highlights in English at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2009/0620-1.asp |title=TG4'S SUCCESSFUL TENNIS COVERAGE TO CONTINUE WITH WIMBLEDON 2009 |date=20 June 2009 |publisher=TG4 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218210514/http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2009/0620-1.asp |archivedate=18 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Wimbledon moved to pay TV broadcaster [[Setanta Sports]] under a 3-year agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setanta.com/ie/big-summer-of-sport-on-setanta/|title=Big summer of sport on Setanta|work=Setanta Sports|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612105325/http://www.setanta.com/ie/big-summer-of-sport-on-setanta/|archivedate=12 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its successor, [[Eir Sport]], currently hosts broadcasting rights in Ireland.

==== Americas ====
In the United States, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] began showing taped highlights of the Wimbledon Gentlemen's Singles Final in the 1960s on its ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' series. [[NBC]] began covering Wimbledon in 1969, with same-day taped (and often edited) coverage of the Gentlemen's Singles Final. In 1979, the network began carrying the Gentlemen's and Ladies' Singles Finals live. For the next few decades, Americans made a tradition of [[NBC]]'s "Breakfast at Wimbledon"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/our-history#decade_5|title=NBC Sports establishes “Breakfast at Wimbledon”|last= |first= |date= |website=NBC Sports History Page|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; specials at weekends. Live coverage started early in the morning (the US being a minimum of 5 hours behind the UK) and continued well into the afternoon, interspersed with commentary and interviews from [[Bud Collins]], whose tennis acumen and (in)famous patterned trousers were well known to tennis fans in the US. Collins was sacked by [[NBC]] in 2007, but was promptly hired by [[ESPN]], the cable home for The Championships in the States. For many years NBC's primary Wimbledon host was veteran broadcaster [[Dick Enberg]].

From 1975 to 1999, premium channel [[HBO]] carried weekday coverage of Wimbledon. Hosts included [[Jim Lampley]], [[Billie Jean King]], [[Martina Navratilova]], [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]] and [[Barry MacKay]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;HBO Guides, program schedules, 1975 to 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, weekday coverage in the United States was exclusively handled by [[ESPN2]] during the tournament's first week.  During the tournament's second week it was split between ESPN2 and NBC.  ESPN's online service [[ESPN3]] provides full coverage of courts not televised using BBC graphics and commentary. Since the 2012 tournament, all live coverage, including the Finals, has been exclusively on ESPN and ESPN2, marking the second major tennis championship (after the Australian Open) available in the United States exclusively on pay television (although taped highlights from the tournament are presented at weekend afternoons on sister network [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/espn-reaches-deal-to-carry-wimbledon/ | work=The New York Times | first=Richard | last=Sandomir | title=ESPN Reaches Deal to Carry Wimbledon | date=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taped coverage using the world feed is aired in primetime and overnights on [[Tennis Channel]] and is branded ''Wimbledon Primetime''.

In [[Canada]], coverage of Wimbledon is exclusively carried by [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and [[RDS Info|RDS]], which are co-owned by Bell Media and ESPN.

In [[Mexico]], the [[Televisa]] family of networks has aired Wimbledon since the early 1960s.  Presently, most weekend matches are broadcast through [[Canal 5 (Televisa Network)|Canal 5]] with the weekday matches broadcast on the [[Televisa Deportes Network]].  As Mexico is six hours behind the U.K., some Canal 5 affiliates air the weekend matches as the first program of the day after [[sign-on]].  Although Mexico had begun broadcasting in colour in 1962, Wimbledon continued to air in black and white in Mexico until colour television came to the United Kingdom in 1967.

In most of the remainder of Latin America, Wimbledon airs on [[ESPN Latin America|ESPN]], as do the other Grand Slam tournaments. In Brazil, [[SporTV]] has exclusive rights to the broadcast.

==== Other countries ====
In several European countries, Wimbledon is shown live on [[Eurosport 1]], [[Eurosport 2]] and the Eurosport Player. Although there are some exceptions, as in Denmark, where the Danish channel [[TV3 Sport]] and Viaplay, holds the rights to show Wimbledon until 2019. In the [[Netherlands]] Center Court is shown live on [[Eurosport 1]] and all other courts are shown live on the Eurosport Player. But Court One is covered live on [[Ziggo Sport]]/[[Ziggo Sport Select]].

In [[Australia]], the free-to-air [[Nine Network]] covered Wimbledon for almost 40 years but decided to drop their broadcast following the 2010 tournament, citing declining ratings and desire to use money saved to bid on other sports coverage. In April 2011, it was announced that the [[Seven Network]], the host broadcaster of the Australian Open, along with its sister channel [[7Two]] would broadcast the event from 2011. Pay television network [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports Australia]] also covers the event. In [[India]] and its Subcontinental region, it is broadcast on [[Star Sports]].

Coverage is free-to-air in [[New Zealand]] through [[TVNZ One]], beginning each night at 11 pm (midday in London).  In 2017 their new channel, [[TVNZ Duke]] (also free-to-air), carried an alternative to the main feed, including (for example) matches on outside courts involving New Zealand players.

[[Fox Sports Asia]] holds broadcasting rights across Southeast Asia.

Most matches are also available for viewing through internet betting websites and other live streaming services, as television cameras are set up to provide continuous coverage on nearly all the courts.

== Trophies and prize money ==

=== Trophies ===
[[File:Wimbledon trophies.jpg|thumb|The Ladies' (top) and Gentlemen's singles trophies]]
The Gentlemen's Singles champion is presented with a silver gilt cup 18.5&amp;nbsp;inches (about 47&amp;nbsp;cm) in height and 7.5&amp;nbsp;inches (about 19&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter. The trophy has been awarded since 1887 and bears the inscription: "All England Lawn Tennis Club Single Handed Championship of the World". The actual trophy remains the property of the All England Club in their museum, so the champion receives a three-quarter size replica of the Cup bearing the names of all past Champions (height 13.5 inches, 34cm).&lt;ref name="wimbledon_trophies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trophies|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/trophies.html|website=www.wimbledon.com|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ladies' Singles champion is presented with a sterling silver salver commonly known as the "[[Venus Rosewater Dish]]", or simply the "Rosewater Dish". The salver, which is 18.75&amp;nbsp;inches (about 48&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter, is decorated with figures from mythology.  The actual dish remains the property of the All England Club in their museum, so the champion receives a miniature replica bearing the names of all past Champions. From 1949 to 2006 the replica was 8 inches in diameter, and since 2007 it has been a three-quarter size replica with a diameter of 13.5 inches.&lt;ref name="wimbledon_trophies" /&gt;

The winner of the Gentlemen's Doubles, Ladies' Doubles, and Mixed Doubles events receive silver cups. A trophy is awarded to each player in the Doubles pair, unlike the other [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments where the winning Doubles duo shares a single trophy. The Gentlemen's Doubles silver challenge cup was originally from the Oxford University Lawn Tennis Club and donated to the All England Club in 1884. The Ladies' Doubles Trophy, a silver cup and cover known as The Duchess of Kent Challenge Cup, was presented to the All England Club in 1949 by The Duchess of Kent. The Mixed Doubles Trophy is a silver challenge cup and cover presented to the All England Club by the family of two-time Wimbledon doubles winner S.H. Smith.&lt;ref name="wimbledon_trophies" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wimbledon – Behind the Scenes – Trophies|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/behind_the_scenes/201205091336568697615.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721073058/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/behind_the_scenes/201205091336568697615.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 July 2018|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prize money ===
Prize money was first awarded in [[1968 Wimbledon Championships|1968]], the year that professional players were allowed to compete in the Championships for the first time. Total prize money was £26,150; the winner of the men's title earned £2,000 while the women's singles champion received £750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336574569863.html |title=The Championships, Wimbledon – Prize Money history |publisher=wimbledon.org |accessdate=2 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714151733/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336574569863.html |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=BP Year Book of World Tennis|year=1969|publisher=Ward Lock &amp; Co.

Before 2007, among grand slam tournaments, Wimbledon and the French Open awarded more prize money in men's events than in women's events. In 2007, Wimbledon changed this policy, awarding the same amounts per event category to both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/guide/prizemoney.html |title=The Championships, Wimbledon 2009 – 2009 Prize money |publisher=[[AELTC]]2009.wimbledon.org |accessdate=26 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612100018/http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/guide/prizemoney.html |archivedate=12 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision has been controversial because women generally spend considerably less time playing on court than men (except in mixed doubles) owing to their wins being based upon best of three sets, whereas men's are based upon best of five sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Galway racing tips |url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/some-are-more-equal-than-others-1784792.html |title=Some are more equal than others... – Lifestyle, Frontpage |work=The Irish Independent  |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/the-big-question-should-women-players-get-paid-as-much-as-men-at-wimbledon-405067.html |work=The Independent | location=London | title=The Big Question: Should women players get paid as much as men at Wimbledon? | first=Paul | last=Newman | date=23 June 2006 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a total of £12,500,000 in prize money was awarded with the singles champions receiving £850,000 each, an increase of 13.3 percent on 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/guide/prizemoney.html |title=2009 Championships Prize Money |publisher=[[AELTC]]2009.wimbledon.org |accessdate=14 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612100018/http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/guide/prizemoney.html |archivedate=12 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 total prize money increased to £13,725,000, and the singles champions received £1,000,000 each. A further increase of 6.4% in 2011 resulted in a total prize money amount of £14,600,000. Both male and female singles champions prize money increased to £1,100,000, a rise of 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2011/04/Other/Wimbledon-Prize-Money-Increase.aspx |title=Wimbledon Increase Prize Money |publisher=ATP Tour |date=19 April 2011 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 Championships offered total prize money of £16,060,000, an increase of 10.0% from 2011.

[[Sergiy Stakhovsky]], a member of the [[Association of Tennis Professionals#Structure|ATP Player Council]] and who was at the time ranked 68th, was among the most vocal in the push for higher pay for players who bow out in the earlier rounds. In an interview Stakhovsky intimated that it is not uncommon for lower-ranked players to be in the negative, for certain tour events, if their results weren't stellar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sport.lb.ua/tennis/2012/04/04/144337_sergey_stahovskiy_bolshie.html |script-title=ru:Сергей Стаховский: большие заработки теннисистов — это иллюзия Источник |work=LB.ua |date=4 April 2012 |author=Eugene Shvets |trans-title=Sergiy Stakhovsky: big earnings tennis players – it is an illusion |language=Russian |accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This issue gained the attention of the men's "[[Big Four (tennis)|Big Four]]"—Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, [[Andy Murray]], and Rafael Nadal—as well as the Championships.

In 2013 total prize money was further increased by about 40% from 2012 to £22,560,000. The losers in the earlier singles rounds of the tournament saw a highest 62% increase in their pay while the total prize money of the doubles increased by 22%. The prize money for participants of the qualifying matches saw an increase of 41%. [[Sergiy Stakhovsky]], a member of the  [[Association of Tennis Professionals#Structure|ATP Player Council]], was the loudest voice for this increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The top guns rake it in from sponsors, but £23,500 minimum prize at Wimbledon will help us humans, says world No 117 and Players' Council rep Stakhovsky|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-2345610/Wimbledon-2013-Sergiy-Stakhovsky-says-23-500-minimum-prize-money-help-lesser-players--EXCLUSIVE.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|accessdate=25 June 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail|location=London|first=Alex|last=Kay|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wimbledon announces 40 per cent prize money increase for 2013 Championships|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2013/04/17/Wimbledon-2013-Prize-Money-Increase.aspx|publisher=ATP World Tour|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 prize money was £1,880,000 each for the Gentlemen's and Ladies' Singles winners, £340,000 each pair for the Gentlemen's and Ladies' Doubles winners, and £100,000 per pair for the Mixed Doubles winners.

In 2016, the total prize money of £28,100,000 was a 5% increase on the 2015 prize money.

In 2017, the total prize money rose by 12.5% to £31,600,000, with the Gentlemen’s and Ladies’ Singles Champions each receiving £2.2 million, a 10% increase from £2.0 million in 2016.&lt;ref name="prize-money-2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Championships, Wimbledon – Prize Money per Programme |url=http://www.wimbledon.com/pdf/prize_money_2017.pdf |publisher=All England Lawn Tennis Club |accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Théâtre du Marais''' has been the name of several [[theatre]]s and theatrical [[:wikt:troupe|troupes]] in [[Paris]], [[France]]. The original and most famous theatre of the name operated in the 17th century. The name was briefly revived for a [[French revolution|revolutionary]] theatre in 1791, and revived again in 1976. The present-day Théâtre du Marais operates at 37, rue Volta in the [[3rd arrondissement of Paris]].

==First incarnation (1634–1673){{Anchor|17c}}==
[[File:Théâtre du Marais detail Gomboust map Paris 1652.jpg|thumb|The Théâtre du Marais on the 1652 Gomboust map of Paris&lt;br&gt;{{Coord|48.86016|2.36135}}]]

The Théâtre du Marais was founded in 1634, at which time there had been only one [[theatre company]] in Paris, the ''[[comédiens du Roi]]'' ("[[comedy|comedians]] of the King"), at the [[Hôtel de Bourgogne (theatre)|Hôtel de Bourgogne]].  The actors [[Charles Lenoir]] and [[Montdory]] decided to create their own troupe, and situated it in the fashionable [[Le Marais]] district of Paris, where they converted the [[Jeu de Paume]] des "Maretz", an unused tennis court on the Vieille Rue du Temple opposite the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], into a theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2000, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new theatre's [[repertory]] was made up mainly of [[farce]]s by [[Jodelet]] and works by [[Pierre Corneille]]; Corneille debuted ''[[Le Cid]]'' there in 1637.  The actor [[Floridor]] entered the troupe in 1640, and quickly became a major star.

In 1643, the theatre was heavily damaged by a fire, and closed until its restoration was completed in October 1644. Upon its reopening, due to its technical innovations as a new theatre and being the first theatre to add a proscenium arch, it increasingly developed spectacular sets, with machinery helping to depict shipwrecks and cataclysms.  [[Marie Champmeslé]] and [[Champmeslé|her husband]] entered the troupe in 1669.  Competition with the ''comédiens du Roi'' lasted until 1673, when the Théâtre du Marais was dissolved to join with [[Molière]]'s troupe, forming the ''[[troupe du Roi]]'' at the [[Théâtre Guénégaud]], and eventually part of the [[Comédie-Française]].

==Second incarnation (1791–1807)==

A new Théâtre du Marais was founded in 1791.  It was built using materials recovered from the [[storming of the Bastille]], and presented revolutionary spectacles.  The house playwright was [[Pierre Beaumarchais]].  This theatre was forced to close in 1807 by [[Napoleon]], and it was destroyed in 1812 to make room for the construction of [[public baths]].

==Third incarnation (1976–present)==

The current Théâtre du Marais was founded by [[Jacques Mauclair]] in 1976.  It temporarily closed in 1999, but was reopened as part of the [[Cours Florent]] in May 2000.

Some, such as Carlton and Gaunt have labelled them the ''British Civil Wars''.{{sfn|Carlton|1994}}{{sfn|Gaunt|1997}} }} {{efn|Trevor Royle published his 2004 book under different titles.

The [[English Civil War]] proper has become the best-known of these conflicts; it included the abolition of the monarchy and the execution of the kingdom's monarch, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], by the English parliament in 1649.

The history of these wars is often extended to include the uprisings and conflicts that continued through the 1650s until the [[Restoration (England)|English Restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660, and sometimes to include [[Thomas Venner|Venner's]] uprising the following year. The wars were the outcome of broadly set tensions over religious and civil issues. Religious disputes centred on whether religion was to be dictated by the monarch or by choice, the conscience of the individual, with many people feeling that they ought to have freedom of religion (freedom of conscience). The related civil question was settling the extent to which the king's rule was to be constrained by parliament—in particular the right to raise taxes and armed forces without consent of the parliament.

The wars also had elements of national conflict, as Ireland and Scotland rebelled against England's primacy within the Three Kingdoms. The broad and durable victory of the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]]—ultimately (under [[Oliver Cromwell]] and the Army) overcoming the king, the Irish and the Scots, and then outlasting the Cromwellian Protectorate itself—helped establish the future of Great Britain and Ireland as a constitutional monarchy with political power centred on the Parliament in London.

These  wars included the [[Bishops' Wars]] of 1639 and 1640; the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]; [[Confederate Ireland]], 1642–1649; the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Scottish Civil War]] of 1644–1645; and the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] in 1649 (collectively the Eleven Years War or [[Irish Confederate Wars]]); and the [[First English Civil War|First]], [[Second English Civil War|Second]] and [[Third English Civil War|Third]] [[English Civil War]]s of 1642–1646, 1648–1649 and 1650–1651.

== Background ==
===General===
After 1541, monarchs of England styled their Irish territory as also a [[Kingdom of Ireland|Kingdom]]—replacing the [[Monarchy of Ireland#Lordship of Ireland: 1198–1542|Lordship of Ireland]]—and ruled there with the assistance of a separate [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]], while [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] integrated [[Wales]] more closely into the [[Kingdom of England]]. Scotland, the third separate kingdom, was governed by the [[House of Stuart]].

Via the [[English Reformation]], King Henry VIII made himself head of the Protestant [[Church of England]] and outlawed [[Catholicism]] in [[England and Wales]]. In the course of the 16th century [[Protestantism]] became intimately associated with [[national identity]] in England: English folk in general saw Catholicism as the national enemy, especially as it was embodied in the rivals [[France]] and [[Spain]]. But Catholicism remained the religion of most people in Ireland; for many Irish it was a symbol of native resistance to the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest/reconquest of Ireland]] in 1541.

In the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] the [[Protestant Reformation]] was a popular movement led by [[John Knox]]. The Scottish Parliament legislated for a national [[Presbyterian]] church—namely the  [[Church of Scotland]] or the "[[Kirk]]"—and the Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] was forced to abdicate in favour of her son [[James VI of Scotland]]. James grew up under a regency disputed between Catholic and Protestant factions; when he took power he aspired to be a "universal King" favouring the English [[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] system of bishops appointed by the king. In 1584, he introduced bishops into the Church of Scotland, but met with vigorous opposition, and he had to concede that the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]] would continue running the church without his say.

The personal union of the three kingdoms under one monarch came about when King James VI of Scotland succeeded Elizabeth I to the English throne in 1603, when he also became King James I of England and of Ireland. In 1625, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] succeeded his father, and marked three main concerns regarding England and Wales: how to fund his government, how to reform the church, and how to limit (the English) Parliament's interference in his rule. At that time he showed little interest in his other two kingdoms, Scotland and Ireland.&lt;ref name="OpenU" /&gt;

===Scotland ===
{{See also|Bishops' Wars}}
[[File:Riot against Anglican prayer book 1637.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The spark—riot in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], Edinburgh, reputedly started by [[Jenny Geddes]]]]

James VI remained Protestant, taking care to maintain his hopes of succession to the English throne. He duly became [[James VI and I#Accession in England|James I of England]] in 1603 and moved to London. His diplomatic and political skills now concentrated fully in dealing with the English Court and [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]—at the same time running Scotland by writing instructions to the [[Privy Council of Scotland#History|Privy Council of Scotland]] and controlling the [[Parliament of Scotland]] through the [[Lords of the Articles]]. He contravened the sovereign authority of the Scottish General Assembly and stopped it from meeting, then increased the number of bishops in the Church of Scotland. In 1618 he held a General Assembly and pushed through ''Five Articles'' of Episcopalian practices, which were widely boycotted. 

After his death in 1625, James was succeeded by his son Charles I, who was crowned in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], [[Edinburgh]]—the Scottish coronation—in 1633, with full [[Anglican]] rites. Charles was less skillful or restrained than his father; his attempts to enforce Anglican practices in the [[Church of Scotland]] created opposition that reached a flashpoint when he introduced the [[Book of Common Prayer]]. His confrontation with the Scots came to a head in 1639, when he tried and failed to coerce Scotland by military means, the [[Bishops' wars]].

=== England ===
:''See also the [[English Civil War]] ([[English Civil War#Background|Background]]).''

Charles shared his father's belief in the [[Divine Right of Kings]], and his persistent assertion of this standard seriously disrupted relations between the Crown and the English Parliament. The Church of England remained dominant, but a powerful [[Puritan]] minority, represented by about one third of Parliament, began to assert themselves; their religious precepts had much in common with the Presbyterian Scots.

The English Parliament and the king had repeated disputes over taxation, military expenditures and the role of parliament in government. While James I had held much the same opinions as his son regarding [[Royal Prerogative|royal prerogatives]], he had discretion and charisma enough to often persuade Parliamentarians to his thinking. Charles had no such skill in political or human management; faced with multiple crises during 1639–1642, he failed to prevent his kingdoms from sliding into civil war. When Charles approached the Parliament to pay for a campaign against the Scots, they refused; they then declared themselves to be permanently in session—[[the Long Parliament]]—and soon presented Charles a long list of civil and religious grievances requiring his remedy before they approved any new legislation.

=== Ireland ===

Meanwhile, in the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (proclaimed such in 1541 but only fully conquered for the Crown in 1603), tensions had also begun to mount. [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth]],  Charles I's [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], angered Roman Catholics by enforcing new taxes while denying them full rights as subjects; he further antagonised the native Irish Catholics by repeated initiatives to confiscate and transfer their lands to English colonists. Conditions became explosive in 1639 when Wentworth offered Irish Catholics some reforms in return for them raising and funding an Irish army (led by Protestant officers) to put down the Scottish rebellion. The idea of an Irish Catholic army enforcing what many saw as already tyrannical government horrified both the Scottish and the English Parliaments, who in response threatened to invade Ireland.

== Wars ==
{{See also|Bishops' War|Irish Rebellion of 1641|English Civil War|Irish Confederate Wars|Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms}}

Modern historians have emphasised the lack of inevitability of the civil wars, noting that the sides resorted to 'violence first' in situations marked by mutual distrust and paranoia. Charles' initial failure to quickly end the [[Bishops' Wars]] informed the antagonists that force could serve them better than negotiation.

In Ireland, alienated by English Protestant domination and frightened by the rhetoric of the English and Scottish Parliaments, a small group of Irish conspirators launched the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], ostensibly in support of the "King's Rights". The rising featured widespread assaults on Protestant communities in Ireland. In England and Scotland, rumours spread that the killings had the king's sanction, which, for many, foreshadowed their own fate if the king's Irish troops landed in Britain. Thus the English Parliament refused to pay for a royal army to put down the rebellion in Ireland; instead Parliament decided to raise its own armed forces. The king did likewise, rallying those [[Cavalier|Royalists]] (some of them members of Parliament) who believed their fortunes were best served by loyalty to the king.

[[File:The armies embrace.jpg|thumb|The English and Scots armies lovingly embrace each other]]

The [[English Civil War]] ignited in 1642. Scottish [[Covenanters]] (as Presbyterians there called themselves) joined forces with the English Parliament in late 1643 and played a major role in the Parliamentary victory. Over more than two years the king's forces were ground down by the efficiency of those of Parliament, including the [[New Model Army]], backed as they were by the financial muscle of the [[City of London]]. On 5 May 1646 at Southwell, Charles I surrendered to the Scottish army besieging [[Newark-on-Trent]]. What remained of the English and Welsh Royalist armies and garrisons surrendered piecemeal over the next few months.{{sfn|Atkinson |1911|pp=403–417}}

Meanwhile, the rebellious Irish Catholics formed their own government—[[Confederate Ireland]]—intending to help the Royalists in return for religious toleration and political autonomy. Troops from England and Scotland fought in Ireland, and Irish Confederate troops mounted an expedition to Scotland in 1644, sparking the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Scottish Civil War]]. There, the Royalists gained a series of victories in 1644–1645, but were crushed after the main Covenanter armies returned to Scotland upon the end of  the first English Civil War.

The Scots handed Charles over to the English and returned to Scotland, the English Parliament having paid them a large sum for their expenses in the English campaign. After his surrender, Charles was approached by the Scots, the Presbyterians in the English Parliament, and the ''[[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandee]]s'' of the New Model Army, all attempting to reach an accommodation with him and among themselves that would gain the peace while preserving the crown. But now, a breach between the New Model Army and Parliament widened day by day, until the Presbyterians in Parliament, with allies among the Scots and the remaining Royalists, saw themselves strong enough to challenge the Army, which began the [[Second English Civil War]].{{sfn |Atkinson|1911|p=417}}

The New Model Army vanquished the English Royalist and Parliamentarians, and their Scottish [[Engager]] allies. On account of his secret machinations with the Scottish Engagers, Charles was charged with treason against England.{{sfn|Gardiner|1906|p=371}} Subsequently, the Grandees and their civilian supporters would not reconcile with the king or the Presbyterian majority in Parliament. The Grandees acted; soldiers were used to [[Pride's purge|purge]] the English Parliament of those who opposed the Army. The resultant [[Rump Parliament]] of the [[Long Parliament]] then passed enabling legislation for [[Trial of Charles I|putting Charles I on trial for treason]]. He was found guilty of treason against the English commons and was executed on 30 January 1649.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|pp=417–418}}

After the execution of King Charles I the Rump Parliament passed a series of acts declaring England a republic and that the House of Commons—without the House of Lords—would sit as the legislature and a [[Council of State (England)|Council of State]] would act as the executive power. In the other two kingdoms the execution of Charles caused the warring parties to unite, and they recognised [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as king of Great Britain, France and Ireland, which would lead to a [[Third English Civil War]].

To deal with the threat to the English Commonwealth posed by the two kingdoms (Ireland and Scotland), the Rump Parliament first charged  Cromwell to invade and subdue Ireland. In August 1649, he landed an English army at [[Rathmines]]  shortly after the [[Siege of Dublin (1649)|Siege of Dublin]] was abandoned by the Royalists following the [[Battle of Rathmines]]. Then, in late May 1650, Cromwell left one army to continue [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|the Irish conquest]] and returned to England and to take command of a second English army preparing to invade Scotland. On 3 September 1650, he defeated the Scottish Covenanters at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)|Battle of Dunbar]]; his forces then occupied Edinburgh and Scotland south of the [[River Forth]]. Cromwell was advancing the bulk of his army over the Forth towards [[Stirling]], when [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], commanding a Scottish Royalist army, stole the march on the English commander and invaded England from his base in Scotland. Cromwell divided his forces, leaving part in Scotland to complete the conquest there, then led the rest south in pursuit of Charles.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|pp=418–420}}

The Royalist army failed to gather much support from English Royalists as it moved south into England; so, instead of heading directly towards London and certain defeat, Charles aimed for [[Worcester]] in hopes that Wales and the West and Midlands of England would rise against the Commonwealth. This didn't happen, and one year to the day after the Battle of Dunbar the New Model Army and English militia regiments vanquished the last Royalist army of the English Civil War at the [[Battle of Worcester]], on 3 September 1651. It was the last and most decisive battle in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|pp=420–421}}

==Aftermath==
Having defeated all organized opposition, the Grandees of the Parliamentary New Model Army and their civilian supporters dominated the politics of all three nations for the next nine years (see [[Interregnum (1649–1660)]]). As for England, the Rump Parliament had already decreed it was a republic and a [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]; but Ireland and Scotland were now ruled by military governors, even as constituent representatives from both nations were seated in the Rump Parliament of [[the Protectorate]]—all which were dominated by [[Oliver Cromwell]], the Lord Protector.  When Cromwell died in 1658, control of the Commonwealth became unstable, until. in early 1660,  General [[George Monck]], commanding English occupation forces in Scotland, ordered his troops from the [[Coldstream]] barracks,   marched them south into England, and seized control of London by February 1660.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt; There he accumulated allies and  agreements among the English and London establishments including the newly constituted [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]], to which Monck was elected a member.{{sfn|Henning|1983|p=}} First a [[Royalist]] campaigner, then a Parliamentary soldier, he now contrived for the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] of the monarchy; [[George_Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle#Restoration of the monarchy|Monck arranged]] that the Convention Parliament would invite Charles II to return as king of the three realms—which was done by act of Parliament on 1 May 1660.

The Wars of the Three Kingdoms pre-figured many of the changes that ultimately would shape modern Britain; but ''in the short term'', the conflicts actually resolved little for the kingdoms and peoples of the times. The [[Commonwealth of England|English Commonwealth]] did achieve a notable compromise between monarchy and a republic, even one that survived destabilizing issues for nearly the  next two hundred years. In practice, Oliver Cromwell exercised political power through his control over Parliament's military forces, but his legal position—and provisions for his succession—remained unclear, even after he became [[Lord Protector]]. None of the several constitutions proposed during this period were realized. Thus the Commonwealth and Protectorate of the Parliamentarians—the wars' victors—left no significant new forms of government in place after their time.

Still, ''in the long term'', two abiding legacies of British democracy were established during this period:

* after the execution of King Charles I for [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]], no future British monarch could expect their subjects would tolerate perceived [[despotism]]—'the divine rights of kings' was no more;{{sfn|Jane|1905|pp=376–377}}
* the excesses of the New Model Army, particularly that of the [[Rule of the Major-Generals]], left an abiding mistrust of military dictators and military rule that persists until today among peoples of British descent or national association.{{efn|"Around the rule of the Major-Generals there has grown a legend of military oppression which obscures the limits both of their impact and of their unpopularity" {{harv|Worden|1986|p=134}} }}
English Protestants experienced religious freedom during the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]], but there was none for English Roman Catholics. During the term of their control, the Presbyterian partisans abolished the [[Church of England]] and the [[House of Lords]]. Cromwell [[Oliver Cromwell#Return to England and dissolution of the Rump Parliament: 1651–53 |denounced the Rump Parliament]] and dissolved it by force,{{sfn|Cromwell|1939|p=501}} but he failed to establish an acceptable alternative. Nor did he and his supporters move in the direction of popular democracy, as the more radical Parliamentarians (the [[Levellers]]) wanted.

During the Interregnum, the New Model Army occupied Ireland and Scotland. In Ireland, the new government confiscated almost all lands belonging to Irish Catholics as punishment for the rebellion of 1641; harsh [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] also restricted this community. Thousands of Parliamentarian soldiers settled in Ireland on confiscated lands. The Commonwealth abolished the Parliaments of Ireland and Scotland. In theory, these countries had representation in the English Parliament, but as this body never held real powers, representation was ineffective. When Cromwell died in 1658 the Commonwealth fell apart—but without major violence. Historians record that adroit politicians of the time,  [[George_Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle#Critiques of his character|especially George Monck]],{{sfn|Burnet|1753|p=}} prevailed over the looming crisis; Monck in particular was deemed the [[George Monck#Restoration of the monarchy|victor ''sine sanguine,'' i.e., "without blood"]], of the Restoration crisis.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;{{sfn|Pepys|1660|loc=[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Diary_of_Samuel_Pepys/1660/March#16th Entry for 16 March 1660]}} And in 1660, Charles II was restored as king of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

Under the [[Restoration (England)|English Restoration]] the political system returned to the constitutional position of before the wars. Although Charles II's [[Declaration of Breda|Declaration of Breda, April 1660,]] offering reconciliation and forgiveness, had promised a general pardon for crimes committed during the English Civil War,    the new régime executed or imprisoned for life those directly involved in the [[regicide]] of Charles I. Royalists dug up Cromwell's corpse and performed a [[posthumous execution]]. Those religious and political radicals held responsible for the wars suffered harsh repression. Scotland and Ireland regained their Parliaments and some Irish retrieved confiscated lands; the New Model Army was disbanded. However, the issues that had caused the wars—religion, the powers of Parliament vis-á-vis the king, and the relationships between the three kingdoms—remained unresolved, postponed actually, to re-emerge as matters fought over again leading to the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. Only after this later time did the larger features of modern Britain foreshadowed in the civil wars emerge permanently, namely: a Protestant [[constitutional monarchy]], and with a strong [[standing army]] under civilian control.

[[Image:William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle and 11th Baron Morley by John de Critz.jpg|right|thumb|200px|William Parker, Baron Monteagle, c. 1615]]
'''William Parker, 13th Baron Morley, 4th Baron Monteagle''' (1575{{snd}}1 July 1622) was an English peer, best known for his role in the discovery of the [[Gunpowder Plot]]. In 1605 Parker was due to attend the opening of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]. He was a member of the [[House of Lords]] as [[Baron Monteagle|Lord Monteagle]], the title on his mother's side.&lt;ref name="Britannia" /&gt; He received a letter: it appears that someone, presumably a fellow Catholic, was afraid he would be blown up.   The so-called Monteagle letter survives in the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] (SP 14/216/2), but its origin remains mysterious.

==Early life==
William was the eldest son of [[Edward Parker, 12th Baron Morley]] (died 1618), and of Elizabeth Stanley, daughter and heiress of [[William Stanley, 3rd Baron Monteagle]] (died 1581).&lt;ref name="Britannia"/&gt; He had both a younger brother, Charles and a younger sister, Mary.

William's father was a [[recusant]], but appears to have been in favour at court; he was one of the noblemen who tried [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. However, William was allied with many Roman Catholic families, and during the reign of [[Queen Elizabeth I]] was in sympathy with their cause.  His wife, the daughter of Sir [[Thomas Tresham (died 1605)|Thomas Tresham]], came from a well-known Roman Catholic family. His sister married [[Thomas Habington]], also a Roman Catholic.
He was knighted while with [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]] in Ireland in 1599, and in 1601 he took part in the latter's rebellion in London. He was punished by imprisonment and a fine of £8,000.

Having close ties with the extremist Catholic faction during Queen Elizabeth I's rule, and a hand in organising [[Robert and Thomas Wintour|Thomas Winter]]'s mission to Spain in 1602, William Parker later declared to be "done with all formal plots"&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;Nicholls, Mark. "Parker, William, Thirteenth Baron Morley and Fifth or First Baron Monteagle (1574/5-1622)." Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. By H. C. G. Matthew and Brian Harrison. Vol. 42. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2004. 752–53. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; after [[King James I]] took the throne. Parker even went as far as writing a letter to his new king with a promise to follow the state religion. Like some reformers, Parker blamed his childhood for his previous wrongdoings, stating: "I knew no better."&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt;

==Gunpowder Plot==

===Background===
When King James I began his reign, English Catholics had hoped that the persecution felt for over 45 years under his predecessor Queen Elizabeth would finally end.&lt;ref name=Fraser&gt;Fraser, Antonia. Faith and Treason: The Story of the Gunpowder Plot. New York: Doubleday,  1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Though more tolerant than others before him, James was still faced with plots and schemes by priests and rebels trying to end the mistreatment of Catholics through force (Fraser 63). To please the Protestants, who were distressed over the growing strength of the Catholic religion, James proclaimed his detestation for Catholics in England.&lt;ref name=Fraser /&gt; Once again priests were expelled, fines were taxed, and Catholics went back to living a hidden life.

But some Catholics weren't so accepting of the secretive nature in which they had to practice their faith. In 1604 [[Robert Catesby]], a devout Catholic with a magnetic personality, recruited friends and rebels to meet and discuss his plot to blow up the House of Lords in an attempt to reestablish Catholicism in England.&lt;ref name=Gardiner&gt;Gardiner, Samuel Rawson, and John Gerard. What Gunpowder Plot Was. London, NY: Longmans,  Green, 1897. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Those present at that first meeting with Catesby were [[Thomas Wintour]], [[John and Christopher Wright|John Wright]], [[Thomas Percy (Gunpowder Plot)|Thomas Percy]] and [[Guy Fawkes]].&lt;ref name=Gardiner /&gt; With the imminent threat of plague, Parliament postponed re-opening until November 5, 1605, which gave the plotters ample time to lease out a small house in the centre of London where Fawkes would live under the alias “Jhon Jhonson” as Thomas Percy's servant while gathering the gunpowder necessary (Fraser 174). By March 1605, the 36 barrels of gunpowder were moved to the newly leased out cellar directly under the House of Lords.&lt;ref name=Gardiner /&gt;

On 26 October an anonymous letter warned Lord Monteagle to avoid the opening of Parliament.&lt;ref name=Fraser /&gt; This letter was possibly sent by Monteagle's brother-in-law, Francis Tresham.  In any event it caused enough suspicion that on the night of 4 November the undercroft beneath the House of Lords was searched by guards, where Guy Fawkes was found in possession of matches and gunpowder was found hidden under coal.&lt;ref name=Gardiner /&gt; After intense torture in the Tower of London Fawkes gave his true name and those of his fellow conspirators.&lt;ref name=Gardiner /&gt; All but one of the plotters pleaded not guilty but nevertheless the seven were found guilty of high treason and each were executed on 30 and 31 January.&lt;ref name=Fraser /&gt;

===The Monteagle Letter===
On 26 October 1605, while sitting at supper at his house in [[Hoxton]], London, he received a letter warning of the Gunpowder Plot.&lt;ref name="Britannia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannia.com/history/w-parker.html | title=William Parker, Baron Morley &amp; Monteagle | work=Britannia | accessdate=October 2013 | author=O'Brien, Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is believed by some historians that he authored the letter himself to win acclaim and favour with the King.&lt;ref name=Fraser /&gt;
Fraser posits that the note was from someone who wanted to protect Parker (either his family, such as his sister Mary Habington, or a friendly conspirator). Had it been a conspirator, such as Francis Tresham, the writer would also have intended to end the plot before it began; Parker had been too clear in his politics to assume he would remain quiet about the plot.&lt;ref name=Fraser /&gt; The argument against  Mary Habington having sent the letter is that the letter was too clumsy, and that there were far better ways to discreetly deliver the information, had it come from her. As for a conspirator, Parker benefited too richly &amp;mdash; and the conspirators too terribly &amp;mdash; for that to be the case.&lt;ref name=Fraser /&gt;{{rp|154}}

After deciphering the letter, Parker rushed to Whitehall and showed it to [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], who then showed it to the King. On 4 November, Parker joined Thomas Howard in searching the basement of Parliament, where they found the stash of gunpowder and explosives.&lt;ref name=Britannia /&gt; For his service in protecting the crown, Monteagle was rewarded with 500 pounds and 200 pounds' worth of lands.&lt;ref name=Fraser /&gt;{{rp|154}}

==Later life and death==
In 1609, William Parker invested in the second [[Virginia Company]] and became a member of the council. He had shares in the East India and North West Companies as well.&lt;ref name=Fraser /&gt; Parker used his influence to protect his brother-in-law, Thomas Habington, from the possible consequence of death, after harbouring the forbidden priests at [[Hindlip Hall|Hindlip]]. Although Habington was condemned, his wife's pleas to her brother secured his reprieve.&lt;ref name=Fraser /&gt; Despite revealing the Gunpowder Plot, Parker seems to have retained some connections to the Catholic community. His eldest son of six children, Henry Lord Morley, was also a known Catholic&lt;ref name=Fraser /&gt; and in 1609, he was suspected of sheltering students from [[Colleges of St Omer, Bruges and Liège|St. Omer's seminary]].&lt;ref name=Britannia /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British History Online. "Calendar of State Papers Domestic, James I, 1603 – 1610" p.533&lt;/ref&gt; Monteagle gave permission for his oldest daughter Frances Parker to become a nun, although not willing, at first, to grant her request. He eventually surrendered to his physically handicapped daughter's appeal "in respect that she was crooked, and therefore not fit for the world."&lt;ref name=Fraser /&gt;

By his marriage with Elizabeth Tresham, daughter of [[Thomas Tresham (died 1605)|Sir Thomas Tresham]], he had six children: three sons, three daughters.&lt;ref name=Britannia /&gt; The eldest son, Henry, succeeded him as 14th Baron Morley and 5th Baron Monteagle. These baronies fell into abeyance when Henry's son Thomas died in about 1686.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  His oldest daughter, Frances, was a nun; the second, Catherine, married [[John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers]]; and the youngest, Elizabeth, married Edward Cranfield, and was the mother of [[Edward Cranfield]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Through Catherine, he was the 5x great-grandfather of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]&lt;ref&gt;https://gw.geneanet.org/frebault?lang=en&amp;pz=henri&amp;nz=frebault&amp;ocz=0&amp;m=A&amp;p=elizabeth&amp;n=clayton&amp;siblings=on&amp;notes=on&amp;t=T&amp;v=6&amp;image=on&amp;marriage=on&amp;full=on&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Parker was summoned to parliament as Baron Morley and Baron Monteagle in 1618 after the death of his father. He died on 1 July 1622 at [[Great Hallingbury]] in Essex and was reported to have received the last rites of the Roman Catholic Church before his death.&lt;ref name=Britannia /&gt;
