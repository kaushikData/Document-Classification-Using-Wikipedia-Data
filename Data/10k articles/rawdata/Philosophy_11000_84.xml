'''Arnold James Freeman''' (24 March 1886 – 8 March 1972) was a British writer, philosopher, [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophist]], adult educator, actor, director, Fabian Socialist, Labour Party candidate and co-founder of the [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] magazine, ''The Golden Blade''. He was the founder and first Warden of the Sheffield Educational Settlement.

==Early years==
Freeman came from a middle-class, non-conformist background, the family involved in importing tobacco and manufacturing cigars. At various times they lived in different houses within the Hoxton area of London. He is the brother of Sir [[Ralph Freeman (1880–1950)|Ralph Freeman]] consulting engineer for the Sydney Harbour Bridge and of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] M.P. [[Peter Freeman (politician)|Peter Freeman]]. He and his brothers all attended [[Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School|Haberdashers' Aske's School]]. On completing school in 1905, Arnold went on to study at [[St John's College, Oxford]] where, being a committed Socialist, he joined the [[Fabian Society]]. He was a vegetarian and engaged in social work from an early age, having been a member of the Highbury Quadrant [[Congregationalist church]].

He and his sister Daisy spent a year at the [[Quaker]] Settlement in [[Woodbrooke]], Birmingham and thereafter he began to do extramural work in tutorial classes for the Universities of Sheffield, London and Oxford. He also began lecturing at the same time he started to teach History and Economic History for the [[Workers' Educational Association]], gradually expanding this into a concern with human nature and human idealism as expressed through Literature, Art and Philosophy. Particularly his work in Sheffield brought him into the mining areas of South Yorkshire.&lt;ref name="Sheffield"&gt;[http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/special/shefed The Sheffield Educational Settlement Papers University of Sheffield Library retrieved 2014.09.13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Sheffield Settlement==

In 1918 he became founding Warden of the Sheffield Educational Settlement in Shipton Street, Upperthorpe, Sheffield at first under the YMCA and later under a Council that included notable local figures. It was part of the University [[Settlement movement]], which "sought to bring education, improvement and hope to the lives of the poor and socially disadvantaged in the decades before the development of the Welfare State following the Second World War. The early decades of the Sheffield Settlement coincided with the serious hardship of the post-First World War era, typified by the Depression and mass unemployment."&lt;ref name="Sheffield" /&gt;

Its stated mission was "to establish in the City of Sheffield the Kingdom of God". 
:"By the Kingdom of God we mean streets along which it is a pleasure to walk; homes worthy of those who live in them; workplaces in which people enjoy working; public-houses that are centres of social and educational life; kinemas that show elevating films; schools that would win the approval of Plato; churches made up of men and women indifferent to their own salvation; an environment in which people "may have life and have it abundantly". By "Education" we mean everything by means of which people may become more spiritual; everything that enriches human beings, with That which described in three words is Beauty, Truth and Goodness, and described in one word as GOD."

==Encounter with Anthroposophy==

On a visit to Germany in 1913, Freeman had had a brief meeting with [[Rudolf Steiner]] which had left no strong impression, as he describes in Thou Eye Among the Blind. In 1921, however, he described a second encounter: 
:“Very shortly afterwards I came across an article of Dr. Steiner’s in the [[Hibbert Journal]]. It was a translation of an essay that originally appeared in the ''Soziale Zukunft'' in Switzerland. It bore the bleak title "Spiritual Life: Civil Rights: Industrial Economy”. This article made an immediate and profound impression upon me. I underwent something like an instantaneous conversion. Here was a thinker altogether greater than the Shaws and the Webbs and the Wellses. Here was somebody who saw all round the social problem. What Steiner had to say in this connection led me to consider what he had to say in other connections. It swiftly came about that for me there was now only one question in my life: “How can I help that man?” For me and others like me this question knocks insistently at their hearts.”

In 1922 he was co-organiser together with Professor [[Millicent Mackenzie]] of the large public conference "Spiritual Values in Education and in Social Life", run predominantly at [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford|Manchester College]] whose principal, Dr [[L.P. Jacks]] was another sympathiser and where Rudolf Steiner was able to put forward his ideas to a group of British educators. This conference marked the beginning of the establishment of [[Waldorf education|Steiner-Waldorf education]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orgprints.org/18835/1/Paull2011OxfordEJES.pdf Rudolf Steiner and the Oxford Conference John Paull European Journal for Educational Studies 3(1) 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner in Britain by Crispian Villeneuve. Temple Lodge Press 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-906999-03-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These convictions caused some conflict amongst some members of the Settlement's Council but it was Freeman's main aim to achieve spiritual values through education. He had come to Sheffield as a University tutor, and members of the University's staff played a major role in the work of the Settlement, though it had no formal association with the University. There were a lot of activities besides: courses of handicrafts, rambles, camping expeditions and involving the membership in the performance of plays. “The Settlement's Little Theatre put on a great variety of productions by the best serious dramatists, with some of whom Freeman corresponded. He never compromised over the quality of the work selected for presentation. Several notable local people, including industrialists, supported the work with donations, and a number of people later active in the public life of the city were associated with the Settlement.”&lt;ref name="Sheffield" /&gt;

In 1923 Freeman stood as a Labour Parliamentary candidate in the Hallam constituency.

When Freeman retired in 1955 at the age of 69 the Wardenship went to Christopher Boulton, an anthroposophist and lover of theatre. In 1961 the Shipton Street Settlement, along with its Little Theatre, vanished. In its place Christopher Boulton founded a Rudolf Steiner Settlement where the Merlin Theatre and the Arnold Freeman Hall still flourish. The [[Sheffield Repertory Company]] also started with the plays its members presented at the Little Theatre before they became independent in 1923.

Arnold Freeman died in 1972

'''Arnold Geulincx''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɣøːlɪŋks}}; 31 January 1624 – November 1669) was a [[Flemings|Flemish]] [[philosopher]]. He was one of the followers of [[René Descartes]] who tried to work out more detailed versions of a generally [[Cartesian philosophy]]. [[Samuel Beckett]] cited Geulincx as a key influence and [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] because of Geulincx's emphasis on the powerlessness and ignorance of the [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brill.nl/product_id26303.htm Arnold Geulincx Ethics With Samuel Beckett's Notes]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} publisher's page for a recent (2006) publication of Geulincx's ''Ethics''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Geulincx was born in [[Antwerp]]. He studied at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]] and was made professor of philosophy there in 1646. He lost his post in 1658, possibly for religious reasons, or (as has been suggested) a combination of unpopular views and his marriage in that year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geulincx.org/biography/land.html&lt;/ref&gt; Geulincx then moved north to the [[University of Leiden]] and converted to [[Calvinism]]. Initially he gave private lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Willem Frijhoff, Marijke Spies, ''Dutch Culture in a European Perspective: 1650: Hard-won Unity'' (2004), p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed reader in [[logic]] there in 1662 and extraordinary professor in 1665. He died in [[Leiden]] in 1669, leaving most of his works, all written in Latin, to be published after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB9|wstitle=Geulincx, Arnold|volume=10|year=1879}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were edited by [[Cornelis Bontekoe]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geulincx.org/bibliography/shorthistory.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://history-modern-philosophy.interferometr.ostroda.pl/page70.html{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==

Despite Geulincx's thesis that God cannot act without an instrumentality of variety, he was strongly attacked in the early eighteenth century, for example by [[Ruardus Andala]] and [[Carolus Tuinman]], as a [[Spinozist]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiep van Bunge (editor), ''The Early Enlightenment in the Dutch Republic, 1650-1750: Selected Papers of a Conference, Held at the Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolfenbüttel 22–23 March 2001'' (2003), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism had originated from [[Christian Thomasius]] in 1710.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geulincx.org/research/devlee.html&lt;/ref&gt; The attack from Andala was on behalf of the 'true' Cartesians, classing Geulincx as pernicious, with [[Burchardus de Volder]], [[Jean Leclerc (theologian)|Jean LeClerc]], [[Frederik van Leenhof]], [[Pontiaan van Hattem]] and [[Willem Deurhoff]]. Geulincx was also attacked by the Pietist [[Joachim Lange]], as part of a campaign against [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]; and regarded with [[Pierre Bayle]] as insidiously anti-Christian by [[Johann Franz Buddeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Irvine Israel]], ''Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650-1750'' (2002), p. 484, p. 551 and p. 635.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

Geulincx summarized his philosophy in the phrase, "''ita est, ergo ita sit''" ("it exists, therefore it is so"). He believed in a "pre-established harmony" as a solution to the [[mind-body problem]], dying 25 years before [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s better&amp;ndash;remembered formulation of the idea. In Leibniz's philosophy, the doctrine of pre-established harmony was linked with optimism, the notion of this world as the "best of all possible worlds".  But Geulincx made no such linkage.

The [[occasionalism]] of Geulincx is ethical rather than cosmological in its inception. The first tract of his ''Ethics''&lt;ref&gt;Land's ed. of the Opera, The Hague, 1891-93.&lt;/ref&gt; is a study of what in his terms are the [[cardinal virtues]]. Virtue according to Geulincx is the love of God and of Reason (III, 16-17; 29). The cardinal virtues are the properties of virtue which immediately flow from its very essence and have nothing to do with externals: [[diligence]], [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]], [[justice]], [[humility]] (III, 17). Humility divides his view of the world into two parts: one, the understanding of our relation to the world; and the other, the concept of our relation to God. Humility consists in the knowledge of self and the forsaking of self. I find in myself nothing that is my own but to know and to will. I therefore must be conscious of all that I do, and that of which I am not conscious is not the product of my own [[causality]]. Hence the universal principle of causality--''quod nescis quo modo fiat, non facis''—if you do not know how a thing is done then you do not do it. He also states a form of this principle in his ''Metaphysica vera''.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/occasionalism/#DesCarOccLouDeLaForGerDeCorArnGeu&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the movements of my body take place without my knowing how the nervous impulse passes to the muscles and there-causes them to contract I do not cause my own bodily actions. "I am therefore a mere spectator of this machine. In it I form naught and renew naught, I neither make anything here nor destroy it. Everything is the work of someone else" (III, 33). This one is the Deity who sees and knows all things. The second part of Geulincx's philosophy is connected with Occasionalism as the effect with the cause. Its guiding principle is: Where you can do nothing there also you should desire nothing (III, 222). This leads to a [[mysticism]] and [[asceticism]] which however must not be taken too seriously for it is tempered by the obligation of caring for the body and propagating the species.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11195b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

All published in Latin, the works appearing in his lifetime were:
 
*''Quaestiones Quodlibeticae'' (1653) with later edition ''Saturnalia'';
*''Disputatio medica inauguralis de febribus'' (1658);
*''Logica fundamentis suis restituta'' (1662)
*''Methodus inveniendi argumenta'' (1663)
*''De virtute'' (1665).
* ''Opera philosophica'' Edited by J. P. N. Land, The Hague, Martinum Nijhoff, 1891-1893 (3 vol.)

The ''De virtute'' was the first part of the ''Ethica'', which ran to six parts when published posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Garber, Michael Ayers, ''The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-century Philosophy'' (2003), Volume II p. 1430.&lt;/ref&gt;

Students seeking English editions of Geulincx's works will find:

*''Metaphysics'', trans. Martin Wilson, Christoffel Press, 1999.
*''Ethics'', trans. Martin Wilson, Brill, 2006.

==Influence==

He is cited by [[Samuel Beckett]], whose character [[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]] remembers the "beautiful Belgo-Latin of Arnold Geulincx", and in particular the gloomy nostrum (frequently repeated by Beckett to inquisitive critics) ''Ubi nihil vales, ibi nihil velis'' (roughly, 'Where you are worth nothing, there you should want nothing'). In the novel ''[[Molloy (novel)|Molloy]]'' (1950), Beckett's eponymous character describes himself as "I who had loved the image of old Geulincx, dead young, who left me free, on the black boat of Ulysses, to crawl towards the East, along the deck".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett, ''Molloy'' (London: Picador, 1979), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Geulincx is also mentioned in Beckett's short story, "The End."

A citation of Geulincx's method of ''despectus sui'' appears in the 'Third Essay' of [[Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Genealogy of Morals]]''.

'''Autoconstructive evolution''' is a process in which the entities undergoing evolutionary change are themselves responsible for the construction of their own offspring and thus for aspects of the evolutionary process itself.  Because [[biological evolution]] is always autoconstructive, this term mainly occurs in [[evolutionary computation]], to distinguish [[artificial life]] type systems from conventional [[genetic algorithms]] where the GA performs replication artificially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ekárt|first=Anikó|date=2014-03-01|title=Emergence in genetic programming|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10710-013-9199-4|journal=Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=83–85|doi=10.1007/s10710-013-9199-4|issn=1389-2576}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Miller |first=Julian F. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFJROKdtvC0C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=Autoconstructive&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiV2t2vwrDWAhVKKyYKHc_1DYA4ChDoAQglMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Autoconstructive&amp;f=false |title=Cartesian Genetic Programming  |date=2011 |pages=10 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=3642173101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Rahim|first=Adzni Abdul|title=A parametric study on reproductive competence in auto-constructive artificial life|date=2008|degree=Masters|publisher=Universiti Malaysia Sabah|url=http://eprints.ums.edu.my/9406/|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.563.9564|title=Proceedings of the Evo20 Workshop, AISB|last=Ryser-welch|first=Patricia|last2=Miller|first2=Julian F.|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=A review of hyper-heuristic frameworks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahim|first=A.

The '''Cainites''', or '''Cainians''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Καϊνοί ''Kainoi'', Καϊανοί ''Kaianoi''),&lt;ref&gt;The name is variously written; Καϊνοί (Hippol. ''Ref''. viii. 20; Theodoret, ''Haer. Fab''. i. 15); Caini (Praedest. ''Cod''.); Καϊανισταί (Clem. Alex. ''Strom''. vii. 17), Καϊανοί (Epiphanius, ''Haer''. 38; Origen, ''contra Celsum'', iii. 13, but his translator Gelenius gives Cainani); Caiani (Philast. 2; Augustin. ''Haer''. 18, Praedest. 18, ''codd''.); Gaiana haeresis (Tertullian ''de Praescrip''. 33, and ''de Bapt.'' 1), but Jerome writing with a clear reference to the latter passage of Tertullian has Caina (''Ep''. 83, ''ad Oceanum'', and ''contra Vigilantium''). Elsewhere he seems to have Cainaei (''Dial. adv. Lucifer''. 33); but many MSS. here have Chaldaei. So also Cainaei (Pseudo-Tertullian, 7), Cainiani (Praedest. ''Codd''.). Irenaeus (i. 31) describes the doctrines of the sect, but gives them no title.&lt;/ref&gt; were a [[gnosticism|Gnostic]] and [[Antinomianism|Antinomian]] sect who were known to venerate [[Cain]] as the first victim of the [[Demiurge]], the deity of the [[Tanakh]], who was identified by many groups of Gnostics as [[evil]]. &lt;!--Unsourced: They venerated Cain, on the basis that by creating murder Cain allowed men to deny it, and thus have a greater chance at redemption from [[Original Sin]].--&gt; The sect following was relatively small. They were mentioned by [[Tertullian]] and [[Irenaeus]] as existing in the eastern [[Roman Empire]] during the 2nd century. One of their purported religious texts was the ''[[Gospel of Judas]]''.

==History==
The oldest source is to be found in Irenaeus, [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXXI.|''adv. Haer''. i. 31]].

===Cain and Abel===

He tells us that the Cainites regarded Cain as derived from the higher principle. They claimed fellowship with [[Esau]], [[Korah]], the men of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]], and all such people, and regarded themselves as on that account persecuted by the Creator. But they escaped injury from him, for [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] used to carry away from them to herself that which belonged to her.

Epiphanius (''[[Panarion|Haer]]''. 38) characteristically gives a much longer account, in substantial harmony with what Irenaeus says. He appears to have had some source of information independent of Irenaeus. He speaks of [[Abel]] as derived from the weaker principle—a statement which bears the marks of authenticity.

===Redemption===
[[File:Blake-Abel.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Blake]], ''The Body of [[Cain and Abel|Abel]] Found by Adam and Eve'', c. 1825. Watercolour on wood.]]

The account given by Irenaeus is unduly curt and the text not quite secure, but it is not difficult to form a general estimate of the sect from it, especially with the assistance of other sources. Like other Gnostics, the Cainites drew a distinction between the Creator and the Supreme God. They identified the Creator with the God of the Jews. They viewed him and those whom he favoured with undisguised hostility; redemption had for its end the dissolution of his work. They claimed kinship with those to whom he showed antagonism in his book, the Old Testament, and shared themselves in the same hostility. Nevertheless, he was the weaker power, who could do them no permanent harm, for Sophia, the Heavenly Wisdom, drew back to herself those elements in their nature which they had derived from her.

Presumably, then, they thought of a division of mankind into two classes—the [[Pneumatic (Gnosticism)|spiritual]] and the [[hylics|material]], the latter belonging to the realm of the Creator and deriving their being from him, but doomed to dissolution, while the former class contained the spiritual men, imprisoned, it is true, in bodies of flesh, but yet deriving their essential being from the highest Power, opposed by the Creator and his minions, but winning the victory over them as Cain did over Abel.

===Judas===
{{Details|Gospel of Judas}}
[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -31- - Kiss of Judas.jpg|right|thumbnail|"The Kiss of Judas" is a traditional depiction of Judas by [[Giotto di Bondone]], c. 1306. Fresco in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]], [[Padua]].]]

They regarded [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] the traitor as having full cognizance of the truth. He therefore, rather than the other disciples, was able to accomplish the mystery of the betrayal, and so bring about the dissolution of all things both celestial and terrestrial. The Cainites possessed a work entitled ''The Gospel of Judas,'' and Irenaeus says that he had himself collected writings of theirs, where they advocated that the work of Hystera should be dissolved. By Hystera they meant the Maker of Heaven and Earth.

There is no doubt that they applauded the action of Judas in the betrayal, but our authorities differ as to the motive which prompted him. The view that Judas through his more perfect ''Gnosis'' penetrated the wish of Jesus more successfully than the others, and accomplished it by bringing him to the Cross through which he effected redemption, is only one of them.

Epiphanius also says that Judas forced the [[archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]], or rulers, against their will to slay Christ, and thus assisted us to the salvation of the Cross. Philaster, on the other hand, assigns the action of Judas to his knowledge that Christ intended to destroy the truth—a purpose which he frustrated by the betrayal.

===Transmigration===
[[File:Codex Tchacos p33.jpg|thumb|right|First page of the [[Gospel of Judas]] (Page 33 of [[Codex Tchacos]]).]]

So far as the moral character and conduct of the Cainites is concerned, there is no doubt that Irenaeus intended to represent them as shrinking from no vileness, but rather as deliberately practising it. He states that they taught, as did [[Carpocrates]], that salvation could be attained only by passing through all experience. Whenever any sin or vile action was performed by them, they asserted that an angel was present whom they invoked, claiming that they were fulfilling his operation. Perfect knowledge consisted in going without a tremor into such actions as it is not lawful even to name.

Carpocrates, we are told, defended this practice by a theory of transmigration. It was necessary to pass through all experiences, and hence the soul had to pass from body to body till the whole range of experience had been traversed. If, however, this could all be crowded into a single lifetime, then the transmigration became unnecessary. We have no ground to suppose that the Cainites held such a view, but they seem to have professed the belief that this fullness of experience was essential to salvation. We have no substantial justification for doubting the truth of Irenaeus' account, though accusations of immorality urged against heretics should always be received with caution. [[G.R.S. Mead]] (''Fragments of a Faith Forgotten'', 1900, p.&amp;nbsp;229) thinks that originally they were ascetics, while N. Lardner (''History of Heretics'', bk. ii. ch. xiv. [= Works, 1829, viii. 560]) questions whether a sect guilty of such enormities ever existed. But there is no valid reason to deny the generally accepted view that the Gnostic attitude to matter did lead to quite opposite results. To some it would seem a duty to crush the flesh beneath the spirit by the severest austerity, but the premise might lead to a libertine as well as to an ascetic conclusion.

'''Christian philosophy''' is a development in [[philosophy]] that is characterised by coming from a [[Christian tradition]].

== Hellenistic philosophy and early Christian philosophy ==
{{Main|Christianity and Hellenistic philosophy}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
[[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenism]] is the traditional designation for the Greek culture of the Roman Empire in the days of Jesus, Paul, and for centuries after. Classical philosophies of the Greeks had already expired and diluted beyond recognition except for small bands of continuators of the traditions of the Pythagoreans, of Plato, and Aristotle (whose library was lost for centuries). The new philosophies of the Hellenistic world were those of the Cynics, Skeptics, and increasingly the Stoics; it's these philosophers who bring us into the world of Hellenistic philosophy. Slowly, a more integral and rounded tendency emerged within Hellenism, but also in certain respects in opposition at times to it in regard to one philosophical problem or another, or an ensemble of problems. Here are some of those thinkers most closely associated with Hellenistic Christian philosophies, listed more or less in chronological order:

* [[Justin Martyr]]: Christian apologist and philosopher whose work often focused on the doctrine of the [[Logos]] and argued that many [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Platonism|Platonic]] philosophical ideas were similar to ideas in the Old Testament
* [[Tertullian]]: Tertullian was a philosopher before he converted to Christianity; after that change of direction he remained a prolific writer in the second century A.D., and is commonly called the "Father of the Western Church." He was the first church father to use the term ''[[Trinity|Trinitas]]'' in reference to the Godhead and developed the doctrine of [[traducianism]], or the idea that the soul was inherited from the parents, the idea that God had corporeal (although not fleshly) existence, and the doctrine of the authority of the gospels. He fought voraciously against [[Marcionism]], and considered Greek philosophy to be incompatible with Christian wisdom. Toward the end of his life, he joined the heterodox sect of [[Montanism]], and thus has not been canonized by the Catholic Church.
* [[Irenaeus of Lyons]]: Irenaeus is best known for his writings arguing for the unity of God, and against [[Gnosticism]]. He argued that [[original sin]] is latent in humanity, and that it was by Jesus' incarnation as a man that he "undid" the original sin of Adam, thus sanctifying life for all mankind. Irenaeus maintained the view that Christ is the Teacher of the human race through whom wisdom would be made accessible to all.
* [[Clement of Alexandria]]: Theologian and apologist who wrote on Greek philosophy, using ideas from pagan literature, Stoic and Platonic philosophy, and Gnosticism to argue for Christianity
* [[Origen]]: Origen was influential in integrating elements of [[Platonism]] into [[Christianity]]. He incorporated Platonic [[idealism]] into his conceptions of the Logos, and the two churches, one ideal and one real. He also held a strongly Platonic view of God, describing him as the perfect, incorporeal ideal. He was later declared a heretic for subscribing to the "too Platonistic" doctrine of the preexistence of the soul. Despite this, Origen is a [[Church Fathers|Church Father]]{{sfn|Grafton|2011|page=222}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Runia|first1=David T.|title=Philo and the Church Fathers: A Collection of Papers|date=1995|publisher=E.

* [[Augustine of Hippo]]: Augustine developed classical Christian philosophy, and the whole of Western thought, largely by [[Influence of Hellenic philosophy on Christianity|synthesizing Hebrew and Greek thought]]. He drew particularly from [[Plato]], the [[Neoplatonism]] of [[Plotinus]], and Stoicism, which he altered and refined in light of [[divine revelation]] of Christian teaching and the Scriptures. Augustine wrote extensively on many religious and philosophical topics; he employed an allegorical method of reading the Bible, further developed the doctrine of [[hell]] as endless punishment, original sin as inherited guilt, [[divine grace]] as the necessary remedy for original sin, [[baptismal regeneration]] and consequently [[infant baptism]], inner experience and the concept of "[[self (spirituality)|self]]", the moral necessity of human [[free will]], and individual [[doctrine of election|election]] to salvation by eternal [[predestination]]. He has been a major influence in the development of Western theology and his thought, and in particular his works, ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' and ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'',  laid the foundations for [[Western Philosophy]], influencing many of philosophers and making him one of the most influential figures in the history of philosophy.
* [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]: father of trinitarian orthodoxy involved in the formation of the [[Nicene Creed]], who vehemently opposed [[Arius]], the bishop of Alexandria who held that Christ was a created being, and his following.
* [[Dioscorus of Aphrodito]]
* [[Gaius Marius Victorinus]]
* [[Nemesius]]
* [[John Chrysostom]]
* [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]]
* The [[Cappadocian Fathers]]: [[Gregory of Nyssa]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], and [[Basil the Great]].

==Medieval Christian philosophy==
{{Catholic philosophy}}
{{see also|Scholasticism|History of science in the Middle Ages}}
* [[Peter Abelard]] (1079-1143): Abelard was a leading 12th-century philosopher and theologian, best known for his association with [[conceptualism]] and his development of the [[moral influence theory of atonement]].
* [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (1033-1109): Anselm is best known for the [[ontological argument]] for God's existence, i.e.: God is that than which nothing greater can be conceived. But to exist is greater than not to exist. If God does not exist then he wouldn't be "that than which nothing greater can be conceived." Therefore, God exists. Anselm's argumentation was used as a theological directive for conceptualizing divine perfection. He was one of the first Western thinkers to directly engage the reintroduction of Aristotle to the West. However, he didn't have all of Aristotle's works and those he had access to were from Arabic translations and Islamic commentaries. Also developed the [[satisfaction theory of atonement]].
* [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225-1274): Aquinas was the student of [[Albert the Great]], a brilliant Dominican experimentalist, much like the Franciscan, [[Roger Bacon]], of Oxford in the 13th century. Aquinas synthesized [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] with Christianity. He believed that there was no contradiction between faith and secular reason, but that they complemented each other epistemically. He thought Aristotle had achieved the pinnacle of human striving for truth apart from divine revelation and thus adopted Aristotle's philosophy as a framework in constructing his theological and philosophical outlook. Thomas Aquinas was a professor at the prestigious [[University of Paris]], a contemporary of [[Bonaventure]], a Franciscan Professor at the University of Paris whose approach differed significantly from Aquinas' in favor of the more traditional Augustinian Platonism. Widely accepted as one of the most influential figures in the history of philosophy, his philosophy is the foundation for [[Thomism]]. His most famous work is ''[[Summa Theologica]]''
* [[William of Ockham]] (1287-1347): philosopher and theologian who developed [[Ockham's razor]] and wrote extensively on metaphysics, ontology, epistemology, theology, logic, and politics
* [[John Duns Scotus]] (1266-1308): John Duns Scotus is known as the "subtle doctor" whose hair-splitting distinctions were important contributions in scholastic thought and the modern development of logic. Scotus was also a Professor at the University of Paris, but not at the same time as Aquinas. Along with Aquinas, he is one of the two giants of [[Scholastic philosophy]]

* [[Jacobus Arminius]] (1560–1609) preacher, theologian, and church court operative.
* [[Francis Bacon]] English philosopher, statesman, scientist, jurist, orator, and author.
* [[Jean Bodin]] (1530–1596) French legal scholar and political philosopher, he wrote widely in a number of areas
* [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (1466–1536) not a philosopher strictly speaking; indeed, he wrote excoriatingly about philosophers. He consolidated the space of [[Humanism]] in the late Medieval scholarship of letters, and came to represent its acme. He was a leader of the development of the humanities into a department of European scholarly activities. He bent his studies to recovery and exegesis of the Hebrew Bible's ancient languages and began building the first critical text, and the New Testament became a formal scholarly text. He wrote about issues relevant to the Catholic Church. He spent six years in an Augustinian monastery; he was a joyful satirist; and became most famous for his book ''[[The Praise of Folly]]''.
* [[Hugo Grotius]] (1583–1645) his early work on the law of the seas was outdistanced by ''On the law of war and peace'' (1625).
* [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) not strictly a philosopher, he knew something of [[William of Occam]] and nominalist epistemology from an earlier era of European thought. He had also studied some philosophical materials of Augustine of Hippo, and did not follow Thomas Aquinas. Luther followed Erasmus in developing a critical text of the Biblical manuscripts.
* [[John Calvin]] (1509–1564) dogmatician ([[systematic theology]]), as exhibited in his ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'', and an [[exegesis|exegete]] who over time translated the Bible from the "original languages" in the form of his grand series of Commentaries on all but one of its books (the [[Book of Revelation]], which provided a problem to him in its metaphory, not yielding robustly to his binomial formula of letter and spirit: either literal, or figurative). He courageously tried to avoid [[allegory|allegorizing]], which had had a long history ever since [[Philo of Alexandria]] had interpreted the [[Pentateuch]] in an allegorical fashion that de-literalized and over-metaphorized (into symbolic systems) many passages of the ancient manuscripts of the Bible (now and developingly a ''critical text'' itself). Calvin tried to distance himself from the allegorical method of Christian interpretation of the Bible, attempted distance certainly from the method's primacy, while facing in the Gospels "the parabolic message of the Cross" (Leon Morris, etc.). Not strictly a philosopher, he had a major impact on the quest for a Protestant philosophy (see Jacob Klapwijk, "John Calvin" in the volume he edited with Griffioen and Groenewoud, ''Bringing into Captivity Every Thought'' (Eng trans 1991; pp 241–266)). Calvin's seed begat [[Reformational philosophy]] 450 years after he planted it.
* [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–1499) influential Italian humanist philosopher who revived Neoplatonism and was a leader in the [[Renaissance]]; translated all of Plato's and Plotinus' works into Latin, as well as many Neoplatonic authors and the Corpus Hermeticum. He also wrote many commentaries on Plato and Christian authors as Pseudo Dyonisius.
* [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] (1463–1494) Italian philosopher who was a major figure in the Renaissance; at the age of 23 he proposed 900 theses on religion, natural philosophy and magic, writing the ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'', which was a central text in [[Renaissance humanism]] and has been called the movement's manifesto
* [[Huldrych Zwingli]] (1484–1531) leading Reformer who was influenced by a party in his church congregation to de-metaphorize the understanding of the Lord's Supper into a memorial only (no real presence, and no communion of saints, therefore no eschatological community of saints composed of the believers at the Communion Table).

In most cases, these writers reference something in an earlier philosopher, without adding to the ongoing problem-historical shape of Western philosophical knowledge. Between Calvin, and Arminius, born four years before Calvin's death, a [[Protestant scholasticism]] took from various loci and authorities of the Western Middle Ages. It begins already with Luther's colleague [[Philip Melanchthon]], who turned from Luther's ''sola Scriptura'' to  philosophical theology; but Protestant Scholasticism's Reformed variants are diverse. There were no real alternatives until [[Herman Dooyeweerd]] and [[D. H. Th. Vollenhoven]] in the last century.

'''Cosmology''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] κόσμος, ''kosmos'' "world" and -λογία, ''-logia'' "study of") is the study of the [[Chronology of the universe|origin, evolution, and eventual fate]] of the [[universe]]. [[Physical cosmology]] is the scientific study of the universe's origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and its [[ultimate fate of the universe|ultimate fate,]] as well as the [[Laws of science|scientific laws]] that govern these areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9988-instant-expert-cosmology.html "Introduction: Cosmology – space"]. ''New Scientist''. 4 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cosmology'' was first used in English in 1656 in [[Thomas Blount (lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]]'s ''Glossographia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Cosmology (Routledge Revivals): Historical, Philosophical, and Scientific Foundations of Modern Cosmology |first1=Norriss S. |last1=Hetherington |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-317-67766-6 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EP9QAwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=EP9QAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116 Extract of page 116]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1731 taken up in Latin by [[German philosophy|German philosopher]] [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], in ''Cosmologia Generalis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wraparound Universe |first1=Jean-Pierre |last1=Luminet |publisher=CRC Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4398-6496-8 |page=170 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PeDqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=PeDqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 Extract of page 170]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religious cosmology|Religious]] or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on [[Mythology|mythological]], [[Religion|religious]], and [[Esotericism|esoteric]] literature and traditions of [[creation myth]]s and [[eschatology]].

Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as [[Astronomy|astronomers]] and [[Physics|physicists]], as well as [[Philosophy|philosophers]], such as [[Metaphysics|metaphysicians]], [[Philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]], and [[Philosophy of space and time|philosophers of space and time]].  Because of this shared scope with [[philosophy]], [[theory|theories]] in physical cosmology may include both [[science|scientific]] and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be [[hypothesis|tested]]. Cosmology differs from astronomy in that the former is concerned with the Universe as a whole while the latter deals with individual [[celestial object]]s. Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the [[Big Bang]] theory, which attempts to bring together [[observational astronomy]] and [[particle physics]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cosmology "Cosmology"] Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; more specifically, a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]], known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.

[[Astrophysics#Theoretical astrophysics|Theoretical astrophysicist]] [[David Spergel|David N. Spergel]] has described cosmology as a "historical science" because "when we look out in space, we look back in time" due to the finite nature of the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=[[David Spergel|David N. Spergel]] |title= Cosmology Today |journal=Daedalus |date=Fall 2014|volume=143|issue=4 |pages=125–133| doi = 10.1162/DAED_a_00312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physics]] and [[astrophysics]] have played a central role in shaping the understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment. [[Physical cosmology]] was shaped through both mathematics and observation in an analysis of the whole universe. The universe is generally understood to have begun with the [[Big Bang]], followed almost instantaneously by [[cosmic inflation]]; an [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] from which the universe is thought to have emerged [[Age of the universe|13.799 ± 0.021]] [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] years ago.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2015|title=Planck 2015 results.

Cosmological parameters (See Table 4 on page 31 of PDF)|arxiv=1502.01589|bibcode=2016A&amp;A...594A..13P|author=Planck Collaboration|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201525830|volume=594|issue=13|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|pages=A13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cosmogony]] studies the origin of the Universe, and [[cosmography]] maps the features of the Universe.

In [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s [[Encyclopédie]], cosmology is broken down into uranology (the science of the heavens), aerology (the science of the air), geology (the science of the continents), and hydrology (the science of waters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=  |title=Detailed Explanation of the System of Human Knowledge

Metaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of humans in the universe in relationship to all other entities. This is exemplified by [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s observation that a man's place in that relationship: "He who does not know what the world is does not know where he is, and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not know who he is, nor what the world is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The thoughts of Marcus Aurelius Antonius viii. 52 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15877/15877-h/15877-h.htm#viii._52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical cosmology===
{{Main|Physical cosmology}}
Physical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the study of the physical origins and evolution of the Universe. It also includes the study of the nature of the Universe on a large scale. In its earliest form, it was what is now known as "[[celestial mechanics]]", the study of the [[celestial sphere|heavens]]. Greek philosophers [[Aristarchus of Samos]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Ptolemy]] proposed different cosmological theories. The [[geocentric]] [[Ptolemaic system]] was the prevailing theory until the 16th century when [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and subsequently [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]], proposed a [[heliocentric]] system. This is one of the most famous examples of [[epistemological rupture]] in physical cosmology.

[[File:PIA17993-DetectorsForInfantUniverseStudies-20140317.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Evidence of [[gravitational waves]] in the [[Big Bang|infant universe]] may have been uncovered by the microscopic examination of the [[focal plane]] of the [[BICEP2]] [[radio telescope]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317" /&gt;]] 
[[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', published in 1687, was the first description of the [[law of universal gravitation]]. It provided a physical mechanism for [[Kepler's laws]] and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the [[Copernican principle]]—that the bodies on earth obey the same [[physical law]]s as all the celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.

Modern scientific cosmology is usually considered to have begun in 1917 with [[Albert Einstein]]'s publication of his final modification of [[general relativity]] in the paper "Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity" (although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]]). General relativity prompted [[cosmogony|cosmogonists]] such as [[Willem de Sitter]], [[Karl Schwarzschild]], and [[Arthur Eddington]] to explore its astronomical ramifications, which enhanced the ability of [[astronomy|astronomers]] to study very distant objects. Physicists began changing the assumption that the Universe was static and unchanging. In 1922 [[Alexander Friedmann]] introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter. Around the same time (1917 to 1922) the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] took place, with early cosmologists such as [[Heber Curtis]] and [[Ernst Öpik]] determining that some [[nebula]]e seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own.

{{Physical cosmology}}
In parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax. Mount Wilson astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]] championed the model of a cosmos made up of the [[Milky Way]] [[star system]] only; while [[Heber D. Curtis]] argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The debate was resolved when [[Edwin Hubble]] detected [[Cepheid Variables]] in the [[Andromeda galaxy]] in 1923 and 1924. Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way&lt;!-- and has galaxies of their own--&gt;&lt;!--Somebody's editing mistake - check.--&gt;.

Subsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the [[cosmological constant]], introduced by Einstein in his 1917 paper, may result in an [[expanding universe]], depending on its value. Thus the [[Big Bang]] model was proposed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] priest [[Georges Lemaître]] in 1927 which was subsequently corroborated by [[Edwin Hubble]]'s discovery of the [[Redshift|red shift]] in 1929 and later by the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] in 1964. These findings were a first step to rule out some of many [[Non-standard cosmology|alternative cosmologies]].

Since around 1990, several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation. These advances include observations of the microwave background from the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]], [[WMAP]] and [[Planck spacecraft|Planck]] satellites,  large new galaxy [[redshift survey]]s including [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dfGRS]] and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]], and observations of distant [[supernovae]] and [[gravitational lensing]]. These observations matched the predictions of the [[cosmic inflation]] theory, a modified [[Big Bang]] theory, and the specific version known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.  This has led many to refer to modern times as the "golden age of cosmology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Guth]] is reported to have made this very claim in an [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]] interview [http://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_guth.html EDGE]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmology deals with the world as the totality of space, time and all phenomena. Historically, it has had quite a broad scope, and in many cases was founded in religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crouch |first1=C.

It is distinguished from religious cosmology in that it approaches these questions using philosophical methods like [[dialectic]]s. Modern metaphysical cosmology tries to address questions such as:&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck/publications#Planck2015|title=Publications - Cosmos|website=www.cosmos.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* What is the origin of the Universe? What is its first cause? Is its existence necessary? (see [[monism]], [[pantheism]], [[emanationism]] and [[creationism]])
* What are the ultimate material components of the Universe? (see [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]], [[hylomorphism]], [[atomism]])
* What is the ultimate reason for the existence of the Universe? Does the cosmos have a purpose? (see [[teleology]])
* Does the existence of consciousness have a purpose? How do we know what we know about the totality of the cosmos? Does cosmological reasoning reveal metaphysical truths? (see [[epistemology]])

| Einstein and De Sitter, 1932
| Expanding flat space
''k'' = 0 ; Λ = 0
Critical density
| Curvature constant ''k'' = 0. Said to be infinite (but ambiguous). "Unbounded cosmos of limited extent". Expands forever. "Simplest" of all known universes. Named after but not considered by Friedmann. Has a [[deceleration parameter|deceleration term]] ''q'' = 1/2, which means that its expansion rate slows down.
|-
| The original [[Big Bang]] (Friedmann-Lemaître)
| [[Georges Lemaître]] 1927–29
| Expansion
Λ &gt; 0 ; Λ &gt; |Gravity|
| Λ is positive and has a magnitude greater than gravity. Universe has initial high-density state ("primeval atom"). Followed by a two-stage expansion. Λ is used to destabilize the universe. (Lemaître is considered the father of the big bang model.)
|-
| [[Oscillating universe]] (Friedmann-Einstein)
| Favored by [[Alexander Friedmann|Friedmann]], 1920s
| Expanding and contracting in cycles
| Time is endless and beginningless; thus avoids the beginning-of-time paradox. Perpetual cycles of big bang followed by big crunch. (Einstein's first choice after he rejected his 1917 model.)

[[William H. McCrea]], 1930s
| Kinematic expansion without space expansion
| Rejects general relativity and the expanding space paradigm. Gravity not included as initial assumption. Obeys cosmological principle and [[special relativity]]; consists of a finite spherical cloud of particles (or galaxies) that expands within an infinite and otherwise empty flat space. It has a center and a cosmic edge (surface of the particle cloud) that expands at light speed. Explanation of gravity was elaborate and unconvincing.

| Steady-state
| [[Fred Hoyle]] 1948
| Expanding, steady state; but unstable
| Matter creation rate maintains constant density. But since matter creation rate must be exactly balanced with the space expansion rate the system is unstable.

| Cellular universe, expanding by means of matter–antimatter annihilation
| Based on the concept of [[plasma cosmology]]. The universe is viewed as "meta-galaxies" divided by [[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]] and thus a bubble-like nature. Other universes are formed from other bubbles. Ongoing cosmic matter-[[antimatter]] [[annihilation]]s keep the bubbles separated and moving apart preventing them from interacting.

|-
| [[Cosmic inflation]]
| [[Alan Guth]] 1980
| [[Big Bang]] modified  to solve [[horizon problem|horizon]] and [[flatness problem]]s
| Based on the concept of hot inflation. The universe is viewed as a multiple quantum flux – hence its bubble-like nature. Other universes are formed from other bubbles. Ongoing cosmic expansion kept the bubbles separated and moving apart.

'''David Wiggins''' [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 8 March 1933) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ethics|moral]] [[philosopher]], [[metaphysics|metaphysician]], and philosophical [[logician]] working especially on [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] and issues in meta-ethics.

== Biography ==
David Wiggins was born in 1933 in London, the son of Norman and Diana Wiggins (née Priestley)&lt;ref&gt;'Who's Who 2012, London, A. &amp; C. Black, London : 2012, 2466)&lt;/ref&gt;. He attended St Paul's School before reading philosophy at [[Brasenose College, Oxford]] where he obtained a first class degree.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=S. G.|editor1-last=Brown|editor1-first=Stuart|title=Dictionary of Twentieth Century British Philosophers|chapter=Wiggins, David (1933-)|date=2005|publisher=Thoemmes|page=1123}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tutor was [[J. L. Ackrill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Professor J.L. Ackrill| work = Obituary| publisher = Times Newspapers
| date = 2007-12-20 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3074592.ece | accessdate =2008-06-19  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his National Service, he joined the Civil Service and was appointed Assistant Principal in the Colonial Office, 1957-8. He left the Civil Service and was Jane Eliza Proctor Visiting Fellow, Princeton University, 1958-9. Returning to Oxford, he was Lecturer, 1959, then Fellow and Lecturer, 1960-7, at New College. After that, he was Chair of Philosophy at [[Bedford College, London]], 1967-80; Fellow and Praelector in Philosophy at University College, Oxford, 1981-9; and Professor of Philosophy at Birkbeck College, University of London, 1989-94; and Wykeham Professor of Logic and Fellow of New College, Oxford, 1994-2000.&lt;ref&gt;'Who's Who 2012, London, A. &amp; C. Black, London : 2012, 2466)&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Wiggins was made a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1978. He was also President of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1999 to 2000 . He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1992.

== Philosophical work ==

Wiggins is well known for his work in metaphysics, particularly identity. In his ''Sameness and Substance'' (Oxford, 1980), he proposed [[conceptualist realism]], a position according to which our conceptual framework maps reality.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Ferner, ''Organisms and Personal Identity: Individuation and the Work of David Wiggins'', Routledge, 2016, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to philosopher Harold Noonan:

:The most influential part of Wiggins's work has been in metaphysics, where he has developed a fundamentally Aristotelian conception of substance, enriched by insights drawn from Putnam (1975) and Kripke (1980). His works also contain influential discussions of the problem of personal identity, which Wiggins elucidates ''via'' a conception that he calls the "Animal Attribute View."&lt;ref&gt;Noonan, H., 2005.  "David Wiggins."  In ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Macmillan. [http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3446802122/wiggins-david-1933.html (excerpt)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also made an influential contribution to ethics. His 2006 book, ''Ethics.  Twelve Lectures on the Philosophy of Morality'' defends a position he calls "moral objectivism".

He has written widely on other areas including philosophy of language, epistemology, aesthetics and political philosophy.

A Festschrift, ''Essays for David Wiggins'' was published in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Lovibond|editor1-first=Sabrina|editor2-last=Williams|editor2-first=S.G.|title=Essays for David Wiggins: Identity, Truth and Value|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Defamation''', '''calumny''', '''vilification''', or '''traducement''' is the communication of a [[False accusation|false statement]] with the intent of harming the reputation of, depending on the law of the country, an [[individual]], [[business]], [[Product (business)|product]], [[Social group|group]], [[government]], [[religion]], or [[nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Business Law Today: The Essentials|last = LeRoy Miller|first = Roger|publisher = South-Western Cengage Learning|year = 2011|isbn = 1-133-19135-5|location = United States|pages = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[common law]], to constitute defamation, a claim must generally be false and must have been made to someone other than the person defamed.&lt;ref&gt;False:
*Ron Hankin, ''Navigating the Legal Minefield of Private Investigations: A Career-Saving Guide for Private Investigators, Detectives, And Security Police'',  Looseleaf Law Publications, 2008, p. 59. "There are five essential elements to defamation: (1) The accusation is false; and (2) it impeaches the subject's character; and (3) it is published to a third person; and (4) it damages the reputation of the subject; and (5) that the accusation is done intentionally or with fault such as wanton disregard of facts."
*Roger LeRoy Miller, Gaylord A. Jentz, ''Business Law Today: The Essentials'', Cengage Learning, 2007, p. 115. "In other words, making a negative statement about another person is not defamation unless the statement is false and represents something as a fact (for example, 'Vladik cheats on his taxes') rather than a personal opinion (for example, 'Vladik is a jerk')."
*Michael G. Parkinson, L. Marie Parkinson, ''Law for advertising, broadcasting, journalism, and public relations'', Routledge, 2006, p. 273. "Simplifying a very complicated decision, the court said that because the plaintiff must prove a statement is false in order to win an action in defamation, it is impossible to win an action in defamation if the statement, by its very nature, cannot be proven false."
*Edward Lee Lamoureux, Steven L. Baron, Claire Stewart, ''Intellectual property law and interactive media: free for a fee'', Peter Lang, 2009, p. 190. "A statement can only be defamatory if it is false; therefore true statements of fact about others, regardless of the damage rendered, are not defamatory (although such comments might represent other sorts of privacy or hate speech violations). Defamation may occur when one party (the eventual defendant if a case goes forward) writes or says something that is false about a second party (plaintiff) such that some third party "receives" the communication, and the communication of false information damages the plaintiff".&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[common law]] jurisdictions also distinguish between spoken defamation, called '''slander''', and defamation in other media such as printed words or images, called '''libel'''.&lt;ref&gt;Linda L. Edwards, J. Stanley Edwards, Patricia Kirtley Wells, ''Tort Law for Legal Assistants'', Cengage Learning, 2008, p. 390. "Libel refers to written defamatory statements; slander refers to oral statements. Libel encompasses communications occurring in 'physical form'... defamatory statements on records and computer tapes are considered libel rather than slander."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[False light]] laws protect against statements which are not technically false, but which are misleading.&lt;ref name=martin&gt;[http://netlaw.samford.edu/Martin/AdvancedTorts/falselight.htm False light] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227000000/http://netlaw.samford.edu/Martin/AdvancedTorts/falselight.htm |date=February 27, 2008 }} by Professor Edward C. Martin – [[Cumberland School of Law]], [[Samford University]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- US-specific? --&gt;

In some [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, defamation is treated as a [[crime]] rather than a [[civil wrong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawreform.ie/publications/data/volume8/lrc_61.html |title=The Law Reform Commission of Ireland – Consultation Paper on the Civil Law of Defamation (see item 360 in bold) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808095835/http://www.lawreform.ie/publications/data/volume8/lrc_61.html |archive-date=8 August 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] ruled in 2012 that the libel law of one country, the Philippines, was inconsistent with Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], as well as urging that "State parties [to the Covenant] should consider the decriminalization of libel".&lt;ref name=2012UNHCRlibel&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/16100-libel-law-violates-freedom-of-expression--un-rights-panel|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509133717/http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/16100-libel-law-violates-freedom-of-expression--un-rights-panel|archivedate=9 May 2013|title=Libel law violates freedom of expression – UN rights panel|publisher=The Manila Times|date=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Defamation#Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], defamation of the state, or a past or present ruler, is punishable under [[Terrorism in Saudi Arabia|terrorism]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/saudi-arabia-passes-anti-terror-law-banning-defamation-1.1267892|title=Saudi Arabia passes anti-terror law, banning defamation|website= Gulf News |access-date= March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who defames another may be called a "defamer", "libeler", "slanderer", or rarely "famacide".

The term "Libel" is derived from Latin "libellus" (literally, "small book' or "booklet").

== Overview ==
As of 2017, at least 130 [[UNESCO]] Member States retained criminal defamation laws.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=261065&amp;set=005B0BC365_3_169&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) Office of the Representative on Freedom of the Media issued a report on criminal defamation and anti-blasphemy laws among its Member States, which found that defamation is criminalized in nearly three-quarters (42) of the 57 OSCE participating States. Many of the laws pertaining to defamation include specific provisions for harsher punishment for speech or publications critical of heads of state, public officials, state bodies and the State itself. The OSCE report also noted that [[blasphemy]] and religious insult laws exist in around one third of OSCE participating States;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Griffen, Scott. 2017. Defamation and Insult Laws in the OSCE Region: A Comparative Study. Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www&lt;/nowiki&gt;. osce.org/fom/303181?download=true&gt;. Accessed 23 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; many of these combine blasphemy and/or religious insult with elements of [[hate speech]] legislation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In Africa, at least four Member States decriminalized defamation between 2012 and 2017. The ruling by the [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights|African Court of Human and Peoples’ Rights]] in Lohé Issa Konaté v. the Republic of Burkina Faso set a precedent in the region against imprisonment as a legitimate penalty for defamation, characterizing it as a violation of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights|African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights]] (ACHPR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]) and the treaty of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS).

Countries in every region have moved to advance the criminalization of defamation by extending legislation to online content. [[Cybercrime]] and [[anti-terrorism laws]] passed throughout the world have led to [[blog]]gers appearing before courts, with some serving time in prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[United Nations]], OSCE, [[Organization of American States|Organisation of American States]] (OAS) and [[African Union Commission|African Commission]] on Human and Peoples’ Rights Special Rapporteurs for Freedom of Expression stated in a joint declaration in March 2017 that ‘general prohibitions on the dissemination of information based on vague and ambiguous ideas, including “false news” or “non-objective information”, are incompatible with international standards for restrictions on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]]…and should be abolished.’&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Types==

===Slander===
The [[common law]] origins of defamation lie in the [[tort]]s of "slander" (harmful statement in a transient form, especially speech) and "libel", each of which gives a common law right of action.

''Defamation'' is the general term used internationally, and is used in this article where it is not necessary to distinguish between "slander" and "libel". Libel and slander both require publication.&lt;ref&gt;50 Am.Jur.2d libel and slander 1–546&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental distinction between libel and slander lies solely in the ''form'' in which the defamatory matter is published. If the offending material is published in some fleeting form, as by spoken words or sounds, sign language, gestures or the like, then it is slander.

===Libel===
Libel is defined as defamation by written or printed words, pictures, or in any form other than by spoken words or gestures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/libel | title = Libel | accessdate = 2010-11-08 | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law of libel originated in the 17th century in England. With the growth of publication came the growth of libel and development of the [[tort]] of libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Trial of john peter zenger for libel | journal = The CQ Researcher | year = 1981 | first = R | last = Benenson| id = | url = http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=11&amp;sid=8c6a668e-4c1b-4bf5-82fe-1dcf50286c1b%40sessionmgr13&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=21213343  | accessdate = 2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cases involving libel====
An early example of libel is the case of [[John Peter Zenger]] in 1735. Zenger was hired to publish ''New York Weekly Journal''. When he printed another man's article that criticized [[William Cosby]], who was then British [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|Royal Governor]] of [[Province of New York|Colonial New York]], Zenger was accused of [[Seditious libel|Seditious Libel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Trial of John Peter Zenger for libel | journal = EBSCOhost | year = 2009| id = | url = http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=11&amp;sid=8c6a668e-4c1b-4bf5-82fe-1dcf50286c1b%40sessionmgr13&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=21213343 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The verdict was returned as ''Not Guilty'' on the charge of seditious libel, because it was proven that all the statements Zenger had published about Cosby had been true, so there was not an issue of defamation. Another example of libel is the case of ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'' (1964). The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] overruled a State court in [[Alabama]] that had found ''The New York Times'' guilty of libel for printing an advertisement that criticized Alabama officials for mistreating student [[civil rights]] activists. Even though some of what ''The Times'' printed was false, the Court ruled in its favor, saying that libel of a public official requires proof of [[actual malice]], which was defined as a "knowing or reckless disregard for the truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Patterson | first1 = T | title = The American Democracy | publisher = New York: McGraw-Hill | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proving libel====
There are several things a person must prove to establish that libel has taken place. In the United States, a person must prove that 1) the statement was false, 2) caused harm, and 3) was made without adequate research into the truthfulness of the statement. These steps are for an ordinary citizen. For a celebrity or public official, a person must prove the first three steps, ''and'' that the statement was made with the intent to do harm or with reckless disregard for the truth,&lt;ref&gt;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; which is usually specifically referred to as "[[actual malice]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cstl-cla.semo.edu/sexton/fall2010/10/index.htm | title = Us political systems | last = Sexton | first = Kevin | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal defamation==
{{See also|Defamatory libel}}

Many nations have criminal penalties for defamation in some situations, and different conditions for determining whether an offense has occurred.  [[ARTICLE 19]], a British free expression advocacy group, has published global maps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.article19.org/defamation/map.html |title=Map showing countries with criminal defamation laws |publisher=Article19.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; charting the existence of criminal defamation law across the globe, as well as showing countries that have special protections for political leaders or functionaries of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[ARTICLE 19]] [http://www.article19.org/advocacy/defamationmap/overview.html statements] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418225239/http://www.article19.org/advocacy/defamationmap/overview.html |date=April 18, 2009 }} on criminalized defamation&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be regional statutes that may differ from the national norm.  For example, in the United States, defamation is generally limited to the living.  However, there are nine states (Idaho, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kansas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Nevada]], [[North Dakota]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Utah]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]) that have criminal statutes regarding defamation of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/idstat/Title18/T18CH48SECT18-4801.htm Idaho Code § 18-4801], [http://law.onecle.com/georgia/16/16-11-40.html Georgia Code – Crimes and Offenses – Title 16, Section 16-11-40] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830171747/http://law.onecle.com/georgia/16/16-11-40.html |date=2011-08-30 }}, [http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=78544 Louisiana Revised Statute § 14:47], [http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-200.html#NRS200Sec510 Nevada Revised Statutes § 200.510], and NO PLACE IN THE LAW: THE IGNOMINY OF CRIMINAL LIBEL IN AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE by Gregory C. Lisby, 9 Comm. L. &amp; Pol'y 433 footnote 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) has also published a detailed database on criminal and civil defamation provisions in 55 countries, including all European countries, all member countries of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/documents/rfm/2005/03/4361_en.pdf |title=OSCE Report – Libel and Insult Laws: a matrix on where we stand and what we would like to achieve |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216000503/http://www.osce.org/documents/rfm/2005/03/4361_en.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 ruling on a complaint filed by a broadcaster who had been imprisoned for violating Philippine libel law, the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] held that the criminalization of libel without provision of a public figure doctrine – as in Philippine criminal law – violates [[freedom of expression]] and is inconsistent with Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].&lt;ref name=2012UNHCRlibel /&gt;

===Early cases of criminal defamation===

Questions of group libel have been appearing in common law for hundreds of years. One of the earliest known cases of a defendant being tried for defamation of a group was the case of Rex v. Orme and Nutt (1700). In this case, the jury found that the defendant was guilty of libeling several subjects, though they did not specifically identify who these subjects were. A report of the case told that the jury believed that “where a writing … inveighs against mankind in general, or against a particular order of men, as for instance, men of the gown, this is no libel, but it must descend to particulars and individuals to make it libel.” &lt;ref&gt;Rex v. Orme and Nutt, 1700&lt;/ref&gt; This jury believed that only individuals who believed they were specifically defamed had a claim to a libel case. Since the jury was unable to identify the exact people who were being defamed, there was no cause to identify the statements were a libel.

Another early English group libel which has been frequently cited is King v. Osborne (1732).  In this case, the defendant was on trial “for printing a libel reflecting upon the Portuguese Jews.” The printing in question claimed that Jews who had arrived in London from Portugal burned a Jewish woman to death when she had a child with a Christian man, and that this act was common. Following Osborne’s anti-Semitic publication, several Jews were attacked. Initially, the judge seemed to believe the court could do nothing since no individual was singled out by Osborne’s writings. However, the court concluded that “since the publication implied the act was one Jews frequently did, the whole community of Jews was defamed.”  &lt;ref&gt;King v. Osborne, 1732
&lt;/ref&gt; Though various reports of this case give differing accounts of the crime, this report clearly shows a ruling based on group libel. Since laws restricting libel were accepted at this time because of its tendency to lead to a breach of peace, group libel laws were justified because they showed potential for an equal or perhaps greater risk of violence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kallgren|first=Edward|year=1953|title=Group Libel|journal=California Law Review|volume=41|pages=290–299|jstor=3478081}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, group libel cases are criminal even though most libel cases are civil torts.

==History==
From early times, people have comprehended defamatory and injurious statements made in a public manner (''convicium adversus bonos mores'').

The Praetorian Edict, codified circa 130 A.D., declared that an action could be brought up for shouting at someone contrary to good morals: "qui, adversus bonos mores convicium cui fecisse cuiusve opera factum esse dicitur, quo adversus bonos mores convicium fieret, in eum iudicium dabo."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Digest]]'' [http://webu2.upmf-grenoble.fr/Haiti/Cours/Ak/Corpus/d-47.htm#10 47. 10. 15. 2.]&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the essence of the offense lay in the unwarrantable public proclamation.  According to [[Ulpian]], not all shouting was actionable. Drawing on the argument of [[Marcus Antistius Labeo|Labeo]], he asserted that the offense consisted in shouting contrary to the morals of the city ("adversus bonos mores huius civitatis") something apt to bring in disrepute or contempt ("quae... ad infamiam vel invidiam alicuius spectaret") the person exposed thereto.&lt;ref&gt;''Digest'' [http://webu2.upmf-grenoble.fr/Haiti/Cours/Ak/Corpus/d-47.htm#10 47. 10. 15. 3–6.]&lt;/ref&gt; Any act apt to bring another person into disrepute gave rise to an ''actio injurarum''.&lt;ref&gt;''Digest'' [http://webu2.upmf-grenoble.fr/Haiti/Cours/Ak/Corpus/d-47.htm#10 47. 10. 15. 25.]&lt;/ref&gt; In such a case the truth of the statements was no justification for the public and insulting manner in which they had been made. But even in public matters, the accused had the opportunity to justify his actions by openly stating what he considered necessary for public safety to be denounced by the libel, and proving his assertions to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/blume&amp;justinian/Book%209PDF/Book9-36.pdf |title=Book 9, Title 36. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515075030/http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/blume%26justinian/Book%209PDF/Book9-36.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second head included defamatory statements made in private, and in this case the offense lay in the content of the imputation, not in the manner of its publication. The truth was therefore a sufficient defense, for no man had a right to demand legal protection for a false reputation.

Roman law was aimed at giving sufficient scope for the discussion of a man's character, while it protected him from needless insult and pain.  The remedy for verbal defamation was long confined to a civil action for a monetary penalty, which was estimated according to the significance of the case, and which, although vindictive in its character, doubtless included practically the element of compensation.  But a new remedy was introduced with the extension of the criminal law, under which many kinds of defamation were punished with great severity.  At the same time increased importance attached to the publication of defamatory books and writings, the ''libri'' or ''libelli famosi'', from which we derive our modern use of the word libel; and under the later emperors the latter term came to be specially applied to anonymous accusations or [[pasquil]]s, the dissemination of which was regarded as particularly dangerous, and visited with very severe punishment, whether the matter contained in them were true or false.

In [[Anglo-Saxon England]], slander was punished by cutting out the [[tongue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=hjI3BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=mutilation+tongue+slander+mutilation+england&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E3_lD2iapi&amp;sig=jmWhegNP5FxHLvTl-Zv0cUfzFXs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBmoVChMInLPtlem5xwIVxLgUCh2pZAPB#v=onepage&amp;q=mutilation%20tongue%20slander%20mutilation%20england&amp;f=false |title=Capital and Corporal Punishment in Anglo-Saxon England |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defenses==
Even if a statement is defamatory, there are circumstances in which such statements are permissible in law.

===Truth===
{{See also|Substantial truth}}
In many legal systems, adverse public statements about legal citizens presented as fact must be proven false to be defamatory or slanderous/libellous.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Proving adverse public character statements to be true is often the best defense against a prosecution for libel or defamation. Statements of opinion that cannot be proven true or false will likely need to apply some other kind of defense. The use of the defense of justification has dangers, however; if the defendant libels the plaintiff and then runs the defense of truth and fails, he may be said to have aggravated the harm.

Another important aspect of defamation is the difference between fact and opinion. Statements made as "facts" are frequently actionable defamation. Statements of opinion or pure opinion are not actionable. Some jurisdictions decline to recognize any legal distinction between fact and opinion. To win damages in a libel case, the plaintiff must first show that the statements were "statements of fact or mixed statements of opinion and fact" and second that these statements were false. Conversely, a typical defense to defamation is that the statements are opinion, relying on [[opinion privilege]]. One of the major tests to distinguish whether a statement is fact or opinion is whether the statement can be proved true or false in a court of law. If the statement can be proved true or false, then, on that basis, the case will be heard by a jury to determine whether it is true or false. If the statement cannot be proved true or false, the court may dismiss the libel case without it ever going to a jury to find facts in the case.

Under [[English common law]], proving the truth of the allegation was originally a valid defense only in civil libel cases. Criminal libel was construed as an offence against the public at large based on the tendency of the libel to provoke [[breach of peace]], rather than being a crime based upon the actual defamation ''per se''; its veracity was therefore considered irrelevant. Section 6 of the [[Libel Act 1843]] allowed the proven truth of the allegation to be used as a valid defense in criminal libel cases, but only if the defendant also demonstrated that publication was for the "Public Benefit".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In some systems, however, notably the [[Philippines]], truth alone is not a defense.&lt;ref name=RPdefamation&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also necessary in these cases to show that there is a well-founded [[public interest]] in the specific information being widely known, and this may be the case even for [[public figure]]s.  Public interest is generally not "what the public is interested in", but rather "what is in the interest of the public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In a 2012 ruling involving Philippine libel law, the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] commented, "Penal defamation laws should include defense of truth."&lt;ref name=2012UNHCRlibel /&gt;

===Privilege and malice===
Privilege provides a complete bar and answer to a defamation suit, though conditions may have to be met before this protection is granted.
Privilege is any circumstance that justifies or excuses a prima facie tort. It can be said that privilege recognizes a defendant's action stemmed from an interest of social importance – and that society wants to protect such interests by not punishing those who pursue them. Privilege can be argued whenever a defendant can show that he acted from a justifiable motive. While some privileges have long been recognized, the court may create a new privilege for particular circumstances – privilege as an affirmative defense is a potentially ever-evolving doctrine. Such newly created or circumstantially recognized privileges are referred to as residual justification privileges.

There are two types of privilege in the common law tradition:
*"[[Parliamentary privilege|Absolute privilege]]" has the effect that a statement cannot be sued on as defamatory, even if it were made maliciously; a typical example is evidence given in court (although this may give rise to different claims, such as an action for malicious prosecution or perjury) or statements made in a session of the legislature (known as 'Parliamentary privilege' in Commonwealth countries).
*"[[Qualified privilege]]" may be available to the journalist as a defense in circumstances where it is considered important that the facts be known in the public interest; an example would be public meetings, local government documents, and information relating to public bodies such as the police and fire departments. Another example would be that a professor – acting in good faith and honesty – may write an unsatisfactory letter of reference with unsatisfactory information. Qualified privilege has the same effect as absolute privilege, but does not protect statements that can be proven to have been made with malicious intent.

===Other defenses===
Defenses to claims of defamation include:
*'''[[Mistake of fact|Statements made in a good faith and reasonable belief that they were true]]''' are generally treated the same as true statements; however, the court may inquire into the reasonableness of the belief.  The degree of care expected will vary with the nature of the defendant: an ordinary person might safely rely on a single newspaper report, while the newspaper would be expected to carefully check multiple sources.
*'''Opinion''' is a defense recognized in nearly every jurisdiction. If the allegedly defamatory assertion is an expression of opinion rather than a statement of fact, defamation claims usually cannot be brought because opinions are inherently not [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]]. However, some jurisdictions decline to recognize any legal distinction between fact and opinion.  The United States Supreme Court, in particular, has ruled that the First Amendment does not require recognition of an [[opinion privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.]]'', 497 U.S. 1 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mere vulgar abuse''' is an insult that is not necessarily defamatory because it is not intended to be taken literally or believed, or likely to cause real damage to a reputation. Vituperative statements made in anger, such as calling someone "an arse" during a drunken argument, would likely be considered mere vulgar abuse and not defamatory.
*'''[[Fair comment|Fair comment on a matter of public interest]]''', arguments made with an honest belief in their soundness on a matter of public interest (such as regarding official acts) are defendable against a defamation claim, even if such arguments are [[Soundness|logically unsound]]; if a [[reasonable person]] could honestly entertain such an opinion, the statement is protected.  In the US fair comment is a common law defense, and it has been argued has been superseded by constitutional defences.
*'''[[Consent]]''' is an uncommon defense and makes the claim that the [[petitioner|claimant]] consented to the dissemination of the statement.
*'''[[Innocent dissemination]]''' is a defense available when a [[defendant]] had no actual knowledge of the defamatory statement or no reason to believe the statement was defamatory.  Thus, a delivery service cannot be held liable for delivering a sealed defamatory letter.  The defense can be defeated if the lack of knowledge was due to [[negligence]].
*Claimant is '''incapable of further defamation''' – e.g., the claimant's position in the community is so poor that defamation could not do further damage to the plaintiff. Such a claimant could be said to be "libel-proof", since in most jurisdictions, actual damage is an essential element for a libel claim.  Essentially, the defense is that the person had such a bad [[reputation]] before the libel, that no further [[damages|damage]] could possibly have been caused by the making of the statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://speechandprivacy.com/post/68909405839/what-is-a-libel-proof-plaintiff |title=What is a Libel Proof Plaintiff? |author=David N. Lowry |date=May 25, 2011 |work=Exceptions |accessdate=November 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606230712/http://speechandprivacy.com/post/68909405839/what-is-a-libel-proof-plaintiff |archivedate=June 6, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Statute of limitations]]. Most jurisdictions require that a lawsuit be brought within a limited period of time. If the alleged libel occurs in a mass media publication such as a newspaper or the Internet, the statute of limitations begins to run at the time of publication, not when the plaintiff first learns of the communication.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Arthur Alan Wolk v. Walter Olson]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''No Third-party communication''': If an employer were to bring an employee into a sound-proof, isolated room, and accuse him of embezzling company money, the employee would have no defamation recourse, since no one other than the would-be plaintiff and would-be defendant heard the false statement.
*'''No actual injury''': If there ''is'' third-party communication, but the third-party hearing the defamatory statement does not believe the statement, or does not care, then there is no injury, and therefore, no recourse.
*'''Slander per-se:''' is an exception to Slander (presume general damages). Slander per-se states that an individual has: 1. A loathsome disease, 2. Business improprieties, 3. Committed a crime or have been in prison for a crime, 4. Committed sexual improprieties/impotent.

In addition to the above, the defendant may claim that the allegedly defamatory statement is not actually capable of being defamatory—an insulting statement that does not actually harm someone's reputation is ''[[prima facie]]'' not libelous. Also, the '''public figure''' doctrine, also called the absence of malice rule, may be used as a defense.

===Public figure doctrine (absence of malice)===
In the United States, special rules apply in the case of statements made in the press concerning public figures, which can be used as a defense.  A series of court rulings led by ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'', 376 U.S. 254 (1964) established that for a [[public official]] (or other legitimate public figure) to win a libel case in the United States, the statement must have been published knowing it to be false or with reckless disregard to its truth (also known as [[actual malice]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'', 376 U.S. 254 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under United States law, libel generally requires five key elements:  the plaintiff must prove that the information was published, the plaintiff was directly or indirectly identified, the remarks were defamatory towards the plaintiff's reputation, the published information is false, and that the defendant is at fault.

The [[Associated Press]] estimates that 95% of libel cases involving news stories do not arise from high-profile news stories, but "run of the mill" local stories like news coverage of local criminal investigations or trials, or business profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stylebook.fredericksburg.com/APtxt/Libel.html|title=FOREWORD|website=stylebook.fredericksburg.com|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Media liability insurance is available to newspapers to cover potential damage awards from libel lawsuits.

==Freedom of speech==
Defamation laws may come into tension with [[freedom of speech]], leading to censorship or [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effects]] where publishers fear lawsuits. Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights permits restrictions on freedom of speech when necessary to protect the reputation or rights of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#C.Art10|title=European Convention on Human Rights and its Five Protocols|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdictions resolve this tension in different ways, in particular in determining where the burden of proof lies when unfounded allegations are made.  The power of the internet to disseminate comment, which may include malicious comment, has brought a new focus to the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5230776.stm |title=BBC News, reporting the comments of Professor Michael Geist, July 31, 2006 |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-07-31 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a broader consensus against laws that ''criminalize'' defamation.  Human rights organizations, and other organizations such as the [[Council of Europe]] and [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], have campaigned against strict defamation laws that criminalize defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ilia|last=Dohel |url=http://merlin.obs.coe.int/iris/2006/10/article1 |title=IRIS 2006–10:2/1: Ilia Dohel, Office of the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media.

One notable case was ''[[Lingens v. Austria]]'' (1986).

====Azerbaijan====
In [[Azerbaijan]], the crime of defamation (Article 147) may result in a fine up to "500 times the amount of [[list of minimum wages by country|minimum salaries]]", public work for up to 240 hours, correctional work for up to one year, or imprisonment of up to six months. Penalties are aggravated to up to three years of prison if the victim is falsely accused of having committed a crime "of grave or very grave nature" (Article 147.2). The crime of insult (Article 148) can lead to a fine of up to 1000 times the minimum wage, or to the same penalties of defamation for public work, correctional work or imprisonment.

In a 2015 case, a Saudi writer was arrested for defaming a former ruler of the country. Reportedly, under a [2014] counterterrorism law, "actions that 'threaten Saudi Arabia’s unity, disturb public order, or defame the reputation of the state or the king' are considered acts of terrorism. The law decrees that a suspect can be held incommunicado for 90 days without the presence of their lawyer during the initial questioning."&lt;ref name="Saudi writer arrested"&gt;{{cite news|first=Linah |last=Alsaafin |title=Saudi writer arrested for insulting long-dead king|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-writer-arrested-insulting-king-175970668#sthash.wGGUZRFv.dpuf|accessdate=1 June 2016|agency=Middle East Eye|publisher=Middle East Eye|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Korea====
{{see also|Cyber defamation law#South Korea}}
{{tone |section |date=March 2013}}
In Korea true and false statements are punishable criminally and civilly with defamation; any words harming another can be considered illegal and may be punishable with fines and imprisonment up to seven years.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kyu Ho Youm &amp; Ahran Park, "South Korea," in Carter-Ruck on Libel and Privacy 1343–47 (Alastair Mullis &amp; Cameron Doley eds., 6th ed. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; 

South Korea is the only country in the world where an individual can be found criminally liable and imprisoned for damaging another's reputation by publically revealing true facts.

Defamation is covered by several laws in Korea, civil law, traditional criminal law and modern internet criminal law-under the "Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Data Protection, etc." (Internet and email related laws) – 2005 CHAPTER IX Article 61 (Penal Provisions). Korean defamation varies significantly from Western laws and in general by country and by case. As image and "public [[Face (sociological concept)|face]]" are very important in East Asia, it is not difficult to file a police report for "loss of face" (defamation) in Korea. Even middle school students are active with cases.
#Any person who has defamed any other person by alleging openly true facts through information and communications networks [anyone stating true comments by internet and email] with the purpose of slandering him shall be subject to imprisonment with or without prison labor for not more than 3 years or by a fine not exceeding 20 million won.
#Any person who has defamed any other person by alleging openly false facts via information and communications networks [anyone stating false comments on the internet and email] with the purpose of slandering him/her shall be subject to imprisonment with prison labor for not more than 7 years or the suspension of disqualification for not more than 10 years, or by a fine not exceeding 50 million won [approximately US$50,000].

In addition to this criminal law, in Korea one can also sue for damages with civil actions. Generally, criminal actions proceed civil ones with Korean police as judicial investigators.

As of June 2010, Korean courts were still hearing cases and individuals frequently fined a few thousand dollars for true facts. International "comity" procedure or "intent" appear not key in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/PrivLRes/2005/2.html Korea's Defamation Law-Act on Promotion of Info &amp; Communications Network Utilization &amp; Data Protection, etc.] Whon-Il Park, Kyung Hee Univ.&amp; S.

In the former [[Soviet Union]], defamatory insults "could only constitute a criminal offense, not a civil wrong".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u4Y7l-vNpv4C&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=%22civil+law%22+defamation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4BnccesfWu&amp;sig=XJpSZcMTxNYfO14mcgpRi8DqFPk&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;ei=aIIaS-bkDM7klAf3tqzyCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Copyright, Defamation and Privacy in Soviet Civil Law] (LEVITSKY, Serge L.)

====Nepal====
Defamation  Act, 1859

====Philippines====
Title thirteen of the [[Revised Penal Code of the Philippines]] addresses ''Crimes Against Honor''. Chapter one of that title addresses libel and slander. Libel is defined as "public and malicious imputation of a crime, or of a vice or defect, real or imaginary, or any act, omission, condition, status, or circumstance tending to cause the dishonor, discredit, or contempt of a natural or juridical person, or to blacken the memory of one who is dead". Slander is defined as oral defamation. Slander by deed is defined as "any act not included and punished in this title, which shall cast dishonor, discredit or contempt upon another person". Penalties of fine or imprisonment are specified for these crimes and for the threat of libel.&lt;ref name=RPdefamation /&gt; A notable characteristic of these crimes under Philippine law is the specification that they apply to imputations both real and imaginary.

In 2012, the Philippines enacted Republic Act 10175, titled ''[[Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012]]''. Essentially, this Act provides that libel is criminally punishable and describes it as: "Libel – the unlawful or prohibited act as defined in Article 355 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, committed through a computer system or any other similar means which may be devised in the future." Professor Harry Roque of the University of the Philippines has written that under this law, electronic libel is punished with imprisonment from 6 years and one day to up to 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/davao/opinion/2012/09/21/lee-cybercrime-prevention-act-2012-244029|title=Lee: The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012|work=Sun*Star – Davao|date=September 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/2012/09/20/cybercrime-law-and-freedom-of-expression/|title=Cybercrime law and freedom of expression|author=Harry Roque, Jr.|work=Manila Standard|date=September 20, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922014156/http://manilastandardtoday.com/2012/09/20/cybercrime-law-and-freedom-of-expression/|archivedate=September 22, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/2012/09/12/republic-act-no-10175/|title=Republic Act No. 10175|work=Official Gazette|publisher=Office of the President of the Philippinest|date=September 12, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928011916/http://www.gov.ph/2012/09/12/republic-act-no-10175/|archivedate=September 28, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2012|9|30}}, five petitions claiming the law to be unconstitutional had been filed with the Philippine Supreme Court, one by Senator [[Teofisto Guingona III]].

In Greece, the maximum prison term for defamation, libel or insult is five years, while the maximum fine is €15,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/documents/rfm/2005/03/4361_en.pdf OSCE Report on Defamation laws in Europe and North America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216000000/http://www.osce.org/documents/rfm/2005/03/4361_en.pdf |date=February 16, 2010 }} (see page 68, items 6 and 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

The crime of insult (Article 361, § 1, of the Penal Code) may lead to up to one year of imprisonment and/or a fine, while unprovoked insult (Article
361-A, § 1) is punished with at least three months in prison. In addition, defamation may result in up to two months in prison and/or a fine, while aggravated defamation can lead to at least 3 months of prison, plus a possible fine (Article 363) and deprivation of the offender's [[civil and political rights|civil rights]]. Finally, disparaging the memory of a deceased person is punished with imprisonment of up to 6 months (Penal Code, Article 365).

====Ireland====
Individuals are protected under the Defamation Act 2009 which came into force on the first of January 2010. This 2009 Act repeals the Defamation Act 1961, which had, together with the underlying principles of the common law of tort, governed Irish defamation law for almost half a century. The 2009 Act represents significant changes in Irish law, as many believe that it previously attached insufficient importance to the media's freedom of expression and weighed too heavily in favour of the individual's right to a good name.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The Act has a one-year limitation period which can be extended to two years in exceptional circumstances.

====Italy====
In Italy, there used to be different crimes against honor. The crime of injury (Article 594 of the penal code) referred to the act of offending someone's honor in their presence and was punishable with up to six months in prison or a fine of up to €516. &lt;!-- the word "determined" is ambiguous/incomprehensible: If the offense referred to the attribution of a determined fact and was committed before many persons, the penalties were doubled.--&gt; The crime of defamation (Article 595, Penal Code) refers to any other situation involving offending one's reputation before many persons, and is punishable with a penalty of up to a year in prison or up to €1032 in fine, doubled to up to two years in prison or a fine of €2065 if the offense consists in the attribution of a determined fact. When the offense happens by the means of the press or by any other means of publicity, or in a public demonstration, the penalty is of imprisonment from six months to three years, or a fine of at least €516. Both of them were "a querela di parte" crimes, that is, the victim had the right of choosing, in any moment, to stop the criminal prosecution by withdrawing the "querela" (a formal complaint), or even prosecute the fact only with a civil action with no "querela" and therefore no criminal prosecution at all. However, beginning from 15 January 2016, injury is no longer a crime, but a tort, while defamation is still considered a crime like before.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.altalex.com/index.php?idnot=36774 Italian Penal Code]
(see Articles 594–595)&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Article 31 of the Penal Code establishes that crimes committed with [[malfeasance in office|abuse of power]] or with abuse of a profession or [[art]], or with the violation of a duty inherent to that profession or art, lead to the additional penalty of a temporary [[ban (law)|ban]] in the
exercise of that profession or art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/documents/rfm/2005/03/4361_en.pdf OSCE Report on Insult Laws in Europe and North America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216000000/http://www.osce.org/documents/rfm/2005/03/4361_en.pdf |date=February 16, 2010 }} (see page 79, item 8)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.altalex.com/index.php?idnot=2005 Italian Penal Code] (see Article 31)&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberately false accusations of defamation, as with any other crime, lead to the crime of [[Calunnia|calumny]] (Article 368, Penal Code), which, under the Italian legal system, is defined as the crime of falsely accusing, before the authorities, one of a crime it didn't commit.

As to the trial, judgment on the legality of the evidence fades into its relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title= Commento alla decisione della Corte europea dei diritti dell'uomo di ricevibilità del ricorso n. 48898/99|journal=Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online|date=2001| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89289653}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, defamation is mostly dealt with by lodging a civil complaint at the District Court. Article 167 of book 6 of the [[Civil Code]] holds:  "When someone is liable towards another person under this Section because of an incorrect or, by its incompleteness, misleading publication of information of factual nature, the court may, upon a right of action (legal claim) of this other person, order the tortfeasor to publish a correction in a way to be set by court." If the court grants an injunction, the defendant is usually ordered to delete the publication or to publish a rectification statement.

====Norway====
In Norway, defamation is a crime punished with imprisonment of up to 6 months or a fine (Penal Code, Chapter 23, § 246). When the offense is likely to harm one's "good name" and reputation, or exposes him to hatred, contempt or loss of confidence, the maximum prison term goes up to one year, and if the defamation happens in print, in broadcasting or through an especially aggravating circumstance, imprisonment may reach two years (§ 247). When the offender acts "against his better judgment", he is liable to a maximum prison term of three years (§ 248). According to § 251, defamation lawsuits must be initiated by the offended person, unless the defamatory act was directed to an indefinite group or a large number of persons, when it may also be prosecuted by public authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/Doc/DH-MM(2003)006rev_fr.asp#P1252_117790 |title=European Council – Defamation Laws (English) – Section Norway |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/1690/file/c428fe3723f10dcbcf983ed59145.htm/preview |title=Norwegian Penal Code (English version) |publisher=Legislationline.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the new Penal Code, decided upon by the Parliament in 2005, defamation will cease to exist as a crime. Rather, any person who believes he or she has been subject to defamation will have to press civil lawsuits. The Penal Code has not taken effect as of 2010, and there are no set date for this.

====Poland====
In Poland, defamation is a crime that consists of accusing someone of a [[misconduct|conduct that may degrade]] him in [[public opinion]] or expose him "to the loss of confidence necessary for a given position, occupation or type of activity". Penalties include fine, limitation of liberty and imprisonment for up to a year (Article 212.1 of the Criminal Code). The penalty is more severe when the offense happens through the [[mass media|media]] (Article 212.2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/Doc/DH-MM(2003)006rev_fr.asp#P1327_125657 |title=European Council – Defamation Laws (English) – Section Poland |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the insult is public and aims at offending a group of people or an individual because of his or their [[nationality]], ethnicity, race, religion or lack of religion, the maximum prison term is 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/documents/rfm/2005/03/4361_en.pdf OSCE Report on Defamation Laws in Europe and North America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216000000/http://www.osce.org/documents/rfm/2005/03/4361_en.pdf |date=February 16, 2010 }} (see page 117, item 6)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portugal====
In Portugal, defamation crimes are: "defamation" (article 180 of the Penal Code; up to six months in prison, or a fine of up to 240 days), "injuries" (art. 181; up to 3 months in prison, or a fine up to 120 days), and "offense to the memory of a deceased person" (art. 185; up to 6 months in prison or a fine of up 240 days). Penalties are aggravated in cases with publicity (art. 183; up to two years in prison or at least 120 days of fine) and when the victim is an authority (art.184; all other penalties aggravated by an extra half). There is yet the extra penalty of "public knowledge of the court decision" (costs paid by the defamer) (art. 189 of Penal Code) and also the crime of "incitation of a crime" (article 297; up to 3 years in prison, or fine).&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.aacs.pt/legislacao/codigo_penal.htm Portuguese Penal Code] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217230903/http://www.aacs.pt/legislacao/codigo_penal.htm |date=December 17, 2009 }} (articles 180 to 189)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} {{cite web|url= http://www.dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2007/09/17000/0618106258.pdf |title=Portuguese Penal Code (official version) }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(641&amp;nbsp;KB)}} (full text)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
In Spain, the crime of calumny (Article 205 of the Penal Code) consists of offending one's reputation knowing the falsity of the offense, or with a reckless [[contempt]] for truth. Penalties for cases with publicity are imprisonment from six months to two years or a fine of 12 to 24 months-fine, and for other cases only a fine of 6 to 12 months-fine (Article 206). Additionally, the crime of injury (Article 208 of the Penal Code) consists of hurting someone's  [[dignity]], depreciating his reputation or injuring his [[self-esteem]], and is only applicable if the offense, by its nature, effects and circumstances, is considered by the general public as strong. Injury has a penalty of fine from 3 to 7 months-fine, or from 6 to 14 months-fine when it's strong and with publicity. According to Article 216, an additional penalty to calumny or injury may be imposed by the judge, determining the publication of the judicial decision (in a newspaper) at the expenses of the defamer.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Penal/lo10-1995.l2t11.html Penal Code of Spain] (Articles 205 to 216)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/Doc/DH-MM(2003)006rev_fr.asp#P1668_166180 |title=European Council – Laws on Defamation (English) – Section Spain |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
In Sweden, the criminal offense of denigration (''ärekränkning'') is regulated in Chapter 5 of the Criminal Code. Article 1 regulates defamation (''förtal'') and consists of pointing out someone as a criminal or as "having a reprehensible way of living", or of providing information about him "intended to cause exposure to the disrespect of others". The penalty is a fine.&lt;ref name=swedenlaw&gt;[http://www.legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/1700/file/4c405aed10fb48cc256dd3732d76.pdf Swedish Penal Code (English version)] (see Chapter 5)&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally not a requirement that the statements are untrue, it is enough if they statements are meant to be vilifying.&lt;ref name=jobbet&gt;Ström, E. [http://arbetsplatskonflikt.av.gu.se/1akut/19kraenkningar.html "Om att utsättas för kränkningar på jobbet"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430055718/http://arbetsplatskonflikt.av.gu.se/1akut/19kraenkningar.html |date=April 30, 2010 }} (in Swedish) Department of Work Science, University of Gothenburg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frigyes, Paul [http://www.journalisten.se/kronika/21455/i-vaentan-pa-juryn "I väntan på juryn..."] ''Journalisten'' November 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 2 regulates [[Aggravation (legal concept)|gross]] defamation (''grovt förtal'') and has a penalty of up to 2 years in prison or a fine. In judging if the crime is gross, the court should consider whether the information, because of its content or the scope of its dissemination, is calculated to produce "serious damage".&lt;ref name=swedenlaw /&gt; For example, if it can be established that the defendant knowingly conveyed untruths.&lt;ref name=jobbet /&gt;
Article 4 makes it a crime to defame a deceased person according to Article 1 or 2.&lt;ref name=swedenlaw /&gt; Most obviously, the paragraph is meant to make it illegal to defame someone's parents as a way to bypass the law.&lt;ref name=jobbet /&gt;

Article 3 regulates other insulting behavior (''förolämpning''), not characterized under Article 1 or 2 and is punishable with a fine or, if it is gross, with up to six months of prison or a fine.&lt;ref name=swedenlaw /&gt; While an act of defamation involves a third person, it is not a requirement for insulting behavior.&lt;ref name=jobbet /&gt;

Under exemptions in the Freedom of the Press Act, Chapter 7, both criminal and civil lawsuits may be brought to court under the laws on denigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/Doc/DH-MM(2003)006rev_fr.asp#P1693_167820 |title=European Council – Laws on Defamation (English) – Section Sweden |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Switzerland====
In Switzerland, the crime of wilful defamation is punished with a maximum term of three years in prison, or with a fine of at least 30 days' fine, according to Article 174-2 of the Swiss Criminal Code. There is wilful defamation when the offender knows the falsity of his/her allegations and intentionally looks to ruin the [[reputation]] of one's victim (see Articles 174-1 and 174-2).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/311_0/a174.html Swiss Penal Code – Calumny] (Article 174)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Swiss criminal code in English [https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19370083/index.html#a174])&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, defamation is punished only with a maximum monetary penalty of 180 daily penalty units (Article 173-1).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/311_0/a173.html Swiss Penal Code – Defamation] (Article 173)&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to a deceased or absent person, there is a  [[Period of prescription|limitation]] to enforce the law up to 30 years (after the death).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/311_0/a175.html Swiss Penal Code – Defamation and calumny against a deceased or absent person] (Article 175)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of the internet, and also intranets (closed computer networks), defamatory statements may be communicated on webpages or internal memos, without reaching the attention of the courts. Such "closet defamation" may be used to conceal other criminal or negligent acts.

{{update|section|inaccurate=yes|date=September 2017}}
{{Main|English defamation law}}

Modern libel and slander laws (as implemented in many, but not all, [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations) in the United Kingdom, and in the [[Republic of Ireland]] are originally descended from English defamation law. The history of defamation law in England is somewhat obscure. Civil actions for damages seem to have been relatively frequent so far back as the reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (1272–1307),{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} though it is unknown whether any generally applicable criminal process was in use. The first fully reported case in which libel is affirmed generally to be punishable at common law was tried during the reign of [[James I of England|James I]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}  From that time, both the criminal and civil remedies have been in full operation.

English law allows actions for libel to be brought in the High Court for any published statements alleged to defame a named or identifiable individual or individuals (under English law companies are legal persons, and allowed to bring suit for defamation&lt;ref name="indiana1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&amp;context=fclj |first1=Douglas W. |last1=Vick |first2=Linda |last2=Macpherson|title=An Opportunity Lost: The United Kingdom's Failed Reform of Defamation Law |journal=Federal Communications Law Journal |issue=3 |volume= 49|date=1 April 1997 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5AA0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA385&amp;lpg=PA385&amp;dq=%22english+law%22+individual+corporation+defamation#v=onepage&amp;q=%22english%20law%22%20individual%20corporation%20defamation&amp;f=false |title=The Law of Torts: A Treatise on the English Law of Liability for Civil Injuries |author= John William Salmond |publisher=Stevens and Haynes |year=1907 |accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lexology1"&gt;{{cite web|first=Sam|last=Howard |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=405621d2-ac5c-48b4-92d0-b161421b7476 |title=Defamation of corporate entities in England |publisher=Lexology |date= 15 March 2007|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in a manner that causes them loss in their trade or profession, or causes a reasonable person to think worse of them. Allowable defences are justification (the truth of the statement), fair comment (whether the statement was a view that a reasonable person could have held), absolute privilege (whether the statements were made in Parliament or in court, or whether they were fair reports of allegations in the public interest) and qualified privilege (where it is thought that the freedom of expression outweighs the protection of reputation, but not to the degree of granting absolute immunity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/Legal%20Guide_defamation.pdf|first= Mayer|last= Brown|title= A4ID Defamation Guide|publisher= Advocates for International Development|year= 2013|accessdate= 14 August 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140209044821/http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/Legal%20Guide_defamation.pdf|archivedate= 9 February 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An offer of amends is a barrier to litigation. A defamatory statement is presumed to be false unless the defendant can prove its truth. Furthermore, to collect compensatory damages, a public official or public figure must prove actual malice (knowing falsity or reckless disregard for the truth).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  A private individual must only prove negligence (not using due care) to collect compensatory damages.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} To collect punitive damages, all individuals must prove actual malice.

Criminal libel was abolished on 12 January 2010 by section 73 of the [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2009/ukpga_20090025_en_6 |title=Coroners and Justice Act 2009 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2010-08-17 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were only a few instances of the criminal libel law being applied.  Notably, the Italian anarchist [[Errico Malatesta]] was convicted of criminal libel for denouncing the Italian state agent Ennio Belelli in 1912.

Libel law in England and Wales was reformed by the [[Defamation Act 2013]].

=====Scotland=====
In [[Scots law]], as in other jurisdictions that base themselves on the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition, there is no distinction between libel and slander, and all cases are simply defamation.  The equivalent of the defence of justification is "veritas".

===South America===

====Argentina====
In [[Argentina]], the crimes of calumny and injury are foreseen in the chapter "Crimes Against Honor" (Articles 109 to 117-bis) of the Penal Code. Calumny is defined as "the false imputation to a determined person of a concrete crime that leads to a lawsuit" (Article 109). However, expressions referring to subjects of public interest or that are not [[Logical assertion|assertive]] don't constitute calumny. Penalty is a fine from 3,000 to 30,000 [[Argentine peso|pesos]]. He who intentionally dishonor or discredit a determined person is punished with a penalty from 1,500 to 20,000 pesos (Article 110).

He who publishes or reproduces, by any means, calumnies and injuries made by others, will be punished as responsible himself for the calumnies and injuries whenever its content is not correctly attributed to the corresponding source. Exceptions are expressions referring to subjects of public interest or that are not assertive (see Article 113). When calumny or injury are committed through the press, a possible extra penalty is the publication of the judicial decision at the expenses of the guilty (Article 114). He who passes to someone else information about a person that is included in a personal database and that one knows to be false, is punished with six months to 3 years in prison. When there is harm to somebody, penalties are aggravated by an extra half (Article 117 bis, §§ 2nd and 3rd).&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.infoleg.gov.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/15000-19999/16546/texact.htm#16 Argentine Penal Code (official text) – Crimes Against Honor] (Articles 109 to 117-bis)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
In [[Brazil]], defamation is a crime, which is prosecuted either as "defamation" (three months to a year in prison, plus fine; Article 139 of the Penal Code), "calumny" (six months to two years in prison, plus fine; Article 138 of the PC) and/or "injury" (one to six months in prison, or fine; Article 140), with aggravating penalties when the crime is practiced in public (Article 141, item III) or against a state employee because of his regular duties. Incitation to hatred and violence is also foreseen in the Penal Code (incitation to a crime, Article 286). Moreover, in situations like [[bullying]] or moral constraint, defamation acts are also covered by the crimes of "illegal constraint" (Article 146 of the Penal Code) and "arbitrary exercise of discretion" (Article 345 of PC), defined as breaking the law as a [[vigilante]].&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Decreto-Lei/Del2848compilado.htm Brazilian Penal Code (official text)]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chile====
In [[Chile]], the crimes of calumny and slanderous allegation ''(injurias)'' are covered by Articles 412 to 431 of the Penal Code. Calumny is defined as "the false imputation of a determined crime and that can lead to a public prosecution" (Article 412). If the calumny is written and with publicity, penalty is "lower imprisonment" in its medium degree plus a fine of 11 to 20 "vital wages" when it refers to a crime, or "lower imprisonment" in its minimum degree plus a fine of 6 to 10 "vital wages" when it refers to a [[misdemeanor]] (Article 413). If it is not written or with publicity, penalty is "lower imprisonment" in its minimum degree plus a fine of 6 to 15 "vital wages" when it's about a crime, or plus a fine of 6 to 10 "vital wages" when it's about a misdemeanor (Article 414).&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.servicioweb.cl/juridico/Codigo%20Penal%20de%20Chile%20libro2.htm Chilean Penal Code, Book II] (see Articles 412 to 431)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite web|url= http://documents.scribd.com/docs/27edl5w48zk905llll5s.pdf |title=IEstudiosPenales.com.ar – Penal Code of Chile }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(578&amp;nbsp;KB)}} (see pages 75–78)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Article 25 of the Penal Code, "lower imprisonment" is defined as a prison term between 61 days and five years. According to Article 30, the penalty of "lower imprisonment" in its medium or minimum degrees carries with it also the suspension of the exercise of a public position during the prison term.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.servicioweb.cl/juridico/Codigo%20Penal%20de%20Chile%20libro1.htm Chilean Penal Code, Book I] (see Articles 25 and 30)&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 416 defines ''injuria'' as "all expression said or action performed that dishonors, discredits or causes contempt". Article 417 defines broadly "''injurias graves''" (grave slander), including the imputation of a crime or misdemeanor that cannot lead to public prosecution, and the imputation of a vice or lack of morality, which are capable of harming considerably the reputation, credit or interests of the offended person. "Grave slander" in written form or with publicity are punished with "lower imprisonment" in its minimum to medium degrees plus a fine of 11 to 20 "vital wages". Calumny or slander of a deceased person (Article 424) can be prosecuted by the spouse, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, siblings and [[inheritance|heirs]] of the offended person. Finally, according to Article 425, in the case of calumnies and slander published in foreign newspapers, are considered liable all those who from Chilean territory sent articles or gave orders for publication abroad, or contributed to the introduction of such newspapers in Chile with the intention of propagating the calumny and slander.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.biblioteca.jus.gov.ar/CP-chile.html Biblioteca.jus.gov.ar – Penal Code of Chile] (see articles 416–417 and 424–425)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
{{Main|Canadian defamation law}}

As is the case for most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions, Canada follows English law on defamation issues (except in [[Quebec]] where the private law is derived from French civil law).  In common law, defamation covers any communication that tends to lower the esteem of the subject in the minds of ordinary members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy v. LaMarsh'' (1970), 73 W.W.R. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Probably true statements are not excluded, nor are political opinions.  Intent is always presumed, and it is not necessary to prove that the defendant intended to defame.  In ''[[Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto]]'' (1995), the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] rejected the ''actual malice'' test adopted in the US case ''New York Times Co. v. Sullivan''. Once a claim has been made, the defendant may avail themselves of a defense of justification (the truth), fair comment, responsible communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Grant v.

Publishers of defamatory comments may also use the defense of innocent dissemination where they had no knowledge of the nature of the statement, it was not brought to their attention, and they were not negligent.

In Quebec, defamation was originally grounded in the law inherited from France. To establish civil liability for defamation, the plaintiff must establish, on a balance of probabilities, the existence of an injury (fault), a wrongful act (damage), and of a causal connection (link of causality) between the two.  A person who has made defamatory remarks will not necessarily be civilly liable for them.  The plaintiff must further demonstrate that the person who made the remarks committed a wrongful act. Defamation in Quebec is governed by a reasonableness standard, as opposed to strict liability; a defendant who made a false statement would not be held liable if it was reasonable to believe the statement was true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Société Radio-Canada c.

Regarding defamation on the internet, in 2011 the Supreme Court of Canada held that a person who posts hyperlinks on a website which lead to another site with defamatory content is not publishing that defamatory material for the purposes of libel and defamation law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Crookes v.

=====Criminal defamation=====
In Canada, the ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'' specifies the following as criminal offences:

* [[Blasphemous libel]], punishable with a maximum term of two years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CCC|296}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provision is being repealed by the Canadian government, as of early 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/department-justice/news/2017/06/cleaning_up_the_criminalcodeclarifyingandstrengtheningsexualassa.html|title=Cleaning up the Criminal Code, Clarifying and Strengthening Sexual Assault Law, and Respecting the Charter - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Department of Justice|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Defamatory libel]], defined as "matter published, without lawful justification or excuse, that is likely to injure the [[reputation]] of any person by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or that is designed to insult the person of or concerning whom it is published",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CCC|298}}&lt;/ref&gt; receives the same penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CCC|301}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A "libel known to be false" is an [[indictable offence]], for which the prison term is a maximum of five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CCC|300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal portion of the law has been rarely applied, but it has been observed that, when treated as an indictable offence, it appears to arise from statements made against an agent of the Crown, such as a [[police officer]], a [[corrections officer]], or a [[Crown attorney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Mann|first= Arshy|date= September 29, 2014|title= The trouble with criminal speech|url= http://canadianlawyermag.com/5299/The-trouble-with-criminal-speech.html| work= Canadian Lawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the most recent case, in 1994 Bradley Waugh and Ravin Gill were charged with criminal libel for publicly accusing six prison guards of the racially motivated murder of a black inmate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to an [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] official report on defamation laws issued in 2005, 57 persons in Canada were accused of defamation, libel and insult, among which 23 were convicted – 9 to prison sentences, 19 to [[probation]] and one to a fine. The average period in prison was 270 days, and the maximum sentence was 1460 days of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/fom/41958 LIBEL AND INSULT LAWS: A MATRIX ON WHERE WE STAND AND WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE], OSCE, 9 March 2005 (at page 40)&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Main|United States defamation law}}
The origins of U.S. defamation law pre-date the [[American Revolution]]; one famous 1734 case involving [[John Peter Zenger]] sowed the seed for the later establishment of truth as an absolute defense against libel charges. The outcome of the case is one of [[jury nullification]], and not a case where the defense acquitted itself as a matter of law, as before the Zenger case defamation law had not provided the defense of truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Trial of John Peter Zenger|url=https://www.nps.gov/feha/learn/historyculture/the-trial-of-john-peter-zenger.htm|website=National Park Service|accessdate=31 October 2017|date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the First Amendment of the [[U.S. Constitution]] was designed to protect freedom of the press, for most of the history of the United States, the [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] neglected to apply the First Amendment to libel cases involving media defendants. This left libel laws, based upon the traditional common law of defamation inherited from the English legal system, mixed across the states. The 1964 case ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'' dramatically altered the nature of libel law in the United States by elevating the fault element for public officials to actual malice—that is, public figures could win a libel suit only if they could demonstrate the publisher's "knowledge that the information was false" or that the information was published "with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 US 254, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L.

Later the Supreme Court held that statements that are so ridiculous to be clearly not true are protected from libel claims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hustler Magazine v.

Defamation law in the United States is much less plaintiff-friendly than its counterparts in European and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]]. A comprehensive discussion of what is and is not libel or slander under United States law is difficult, as the definition differs between different states and is further affected by federal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defamation FAQs|url=http://www.medialaw.org/topics-page/defamation-faqs|website=Media Law Resource Center|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states codify what constitutes slander and libel together, merging the concepts into a single defamation law.&lt;ref name="defperse"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bossary|first1=Andrew|title=Defamation Per Se: Be Prepared to Plead (and Prove!)

=====Civil defamation=====
Although laws vary by state, in the United States a defamation action typically requires that a plaintiff claiming defamation prove that the defendant:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Defamation: Libel and Slander|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/defamation.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=31 October 2017|date=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#made a false and defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff;
#shared the statement with a third party (that is, somebody other than the person defamed by the statement);
#if the defamatory matter is of public concern, acted in a manner which amounted at least to negligence on the part of the defendant; and
#caused damages to the plaintiff.

American writers and publishers are protected{{Clarify|date=June 2015}} from foreign libel judgments not compliant with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|US First Amendment]], or [[libel tourism]], by the [[SPEECH Act]], which was passed by the [[111th United States Congress]] and signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Dana|title=The SPEECH Act Provides Protection Against Foreign Libel Judgments|url=http://www.dros.tech/index.cgi/en/20/https/apps.americanbar.org/litigation/litigationnews/mobile/firstamendment-SPEECH.html|website=Litigation News|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the New York State 2008 Libel Terrorism Protection Act (also known as "Rachel's Law", after [[Rachel Ehrenfeld]] who initiated the state and federal laws).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shapiro|first1=Ari|title=On Libel And The Law, U.S. And U.K. Go Separate Ways|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/03/21/394273902/on-libel-and-the-law-u-s-and-u-k-go-separate-ways|accessdate=31 October 2017|agency=Parallels|publisher=National Public Radio|date=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the New York state law and the federal law were passed unanimously.

Defenses to defamation that may defeat a lawsuit, including possible [[summary judgement|dismissal before trial]], include the statement being one of [[opinion privilege|opinion]] rather than fact or being "[[fair comment]] and criticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opinion and Fair Comment Privileges|url=http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/opinion-and-fair-comment-privileges|website=Digital Media Law Project|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truth is always a defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Franklin|first1=Mark A.|title=The Origins and Constitutionality of Limitations on Truth as a Defense in Tort Law|journal=Stanford Law Review|date=1963|volume=16|page=789|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/stflr16&amp;div=59&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Defamation ''per se''======
Most states recognize that some categories of statements are considered to be defamatory ''per se'', such that people making a defamation claim for these statements do not need to prove that the statement was defamatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dancingwithlawyers.com/freeinfo/libel-slander-per-se.shtml |title=Dancing With Lawyers |publisher=Dancing With Lawyers |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an action for defamation ''[[Illegal per se|per se]]'', the law recognizes that certain false statements are so damaging that they create a presumption of injury to the plaintiff's reputation, allowing a defamation case to proceed to verdict with no actual proof of damages. Although laws vary by state, and not all states recognize defamation ''per se'', there are four general categories of false statement that typically support a ''per se'' action:&lt;ref name="defperse"/&gt;
#accusing someone of a crime;
#alleging that someone has a foul or loathsome disease;
#adversely reflecting on a person's fitness to conduct their business or trade; and
#imputing serious sexual misconduct.
If the plaintiff proves that such a statement was made and was false, to recover damages the plaintiff need only prove that someone had made the statement to any third party. No proof of special damages is required. However, to recover full compensation a plaintiff should be prepared to prove actual damages.&lt;ref name="defperse"/&gt;

As with any defamation case, truth remains an absolute defense to defamation ''per se''. This means that even if the statement would be considered defamatory ''per se'' if false, if the defendant establishes that it is in fact true, an action for defamation ''per se'' cannot survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defamation|url=http://www.dmlp.org/book/export/html/1813|website=Digital Media Law Project|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conception of what type of allegation may support an action for defamation per se can evolve with public policy. For example, in May 2012 an appeals court in New York, citing changes in public policy with regard to [[homosexuality]], ruled that describing someone as [[gay]] is not defamation.&lt;ref name=NYGayRuling&gt;{{cite news|title=Label of Gay Is No Longer Defamatory, Court Rules|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/nyregion/court-rules-calling-someone-gay-is-not-defamatory.html|accessdate=June 3, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 31, 2012|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Record awards======

The record libel verdict in the United States was rendered in 1997 against [[Dow Jones]] in favor of MMAR Group Inc., awarding $222.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peterson |first=Iver |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/21/business/firm-awarded-222.7-million-in-a-libel-suit-vs-dow-jones.html |title=New York Times, "Firm Awarded $222.7 Million In a Libel Suit Vs.

=====Criminal defamation=====
Less than half of U.S. states have criminal defamation laws, and the applicability of those laws is limited by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the laws are rarely enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Defamation Laws in North America|url=https://cpj.org/reports/2016/03/north-america.php|website=Committee to Protect Journalists|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the federal level, there are no criminal defamation or insult laws in the United States. However, on the state level, 17 states and 2 territories have criminal defamation laws on the books: [[Florida]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Florida Statutes]], § 836.01–836.11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Idaho]],&lt;ref&gt;Idaho Code, § 18-4801-18-4809&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kansas]],&lt;ref&gt;Kansas Statute Annotated, §21-4004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louisiana]],&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana R.S., 14:47&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michigan]],&lt;ref&gt;Michigan Compiled Laws, § 750.370&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minnesota]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Minnesota Statutes]]. § 609.765&lt;/ref&gt;[[Mississippi]],&lt;ref&gt;Mississippi Code Annotated, §97-3-55&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montana]],&lt;ref&gt;Montana Code Annotated, § 13-35-234&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nevada]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Nevada Revised Statutes]] §§ 200.510–200.560&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Hampshire]],&lt;ref&gt;New Hampshire Revised Statute Annotated, § 644:11&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Mexico]],&lt;ref&gt;New Mexico Statute Annotated, §30-11-1&lt;/ref&gt; [[North Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina General Statutes, § 14–47&lt;/ref&gt; [[North Dakota]],&lt;ref&gt;[[North Dakota Century Code]], § 12.1-15-01&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oklahoma]],&lt;ref&gt;Oklahoma Statutes, tit. 27 §§ 771–781&lt;/ref&gt; [[Utah]],&lt;ref&gt;Utah Code Annotated, § 76-9-404&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia]],&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Code Annotated, § 18.2-417&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wisconsin]],&lt;ref&gt;Wisconsin Statutes, § 942.01&lt;/ref&gt; [[Puerto Rico]]&lt;ref&gt;Puerto Rico Laws, tit. 33, §§ 4101–4104&lt;/ref&gt; and [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Virgin Islands Code, Title 14, § 1172)&lt;/ref&gt; Three additional states had such laws in 2005;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/documents/rfm/2005/03/4361_en.pdf OSCE – Libel and Insult Laws: A Matrix on Where We Stand and What We Would Like to Achieve] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216000000/http://www.osce.org/documents/rfm/2005/03/4361_en.pdf |date=February 16, 2010 }} (see page 171; report on the United States provided by HELLER, Dave, from the Media Law Resource Center)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colorado]]'s law&lt;ref&gt;Colorado Revised Statutes, § 18-13-105 - repealed in 2012&lt;/ref&gt; was repealed in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.splc.org/blog/splc/2012/04/prompted-by-college-students-case-colorado-repeals-criminal-libel-law|title=Student Press Law Center|website=www.splc.org|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]'s was repealed in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/dispo.aspx?cite=9.58.010|title=Chapter 9.58.010 RCW Dispositions:  LIBEL AND SLANDER|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia's]] [[Georgia Code|O.C.G.A.]] § 16-11-40 was repealed in 2015&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2016/title-16/chapter-11/article-2/section-16-11-40/]&lt;/ref&gt;

======Group Defamation======
Group libel has been on many occasions shown to be found by United States courts to be a crime which was punishable under common law. There were three notable early cases in United States law which found group libel to be a criminal offense. The first of these cases was ''State v. Brady'' (1890). The holding of this court found that "The law is elementary that a libel need not be on a particular person, but may be upon a family, or a class of persons, if the tendency of the publication is to stir up riot and disorder, and incite to a breach of the peace."&lt;ref&gt;''State v. Brady'', 1890&lt;/ref&gt; This holding is similar to that of ''King v. Osborne'', in that the court found the prevention of riots to take priority over the protection of speech.

''Jones v. State of Texas'' (1897) took place a few years after Brady and held a similar view on group libel. This case was, however, different in that it concerned the defamation of streetcar conductors in Galveston. The court still sided with the state, saying that "It therefore would be a violation of our statute to libel any sect, company, or class of men without naming any person in particular who may belong to said class".&lt;ref&gt;''Jones v. State of Texas'', 1897&lt;/ref&gt; Going further than strictly outlawing libel against a religious or racial group, the Jones court found that libel against any group, even a class of workers, had potential to lead to violence between groups.

''People v. Spielman'' (1925) upheld same statute as the one in ''Beauharnais''. In this case, publications defamed members of the Knights of Columbus, falsely assigning an oath to them. In this case the defendant was found guilty of a libel on both "the membership of the American Legion and certain named members of that organization".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The holding that individual members were libeled relied on doctrine from the Osborne case. Though these individual members were not named in the publication, their ties to the legion gave them adequate claim to a criminal libel offense. These three cases played a large role in solidifying the American conception of group libel law as it was interpreted in the ''Beauharnais'' case.

Though the common law interpretation of group libel law has generally been referred to in United States court cases prior to the case of ''Beauharnais v. Illinois'', the courts have not always taken this stance. There are two notable group libel cases prior to ''Beauharnais'' where the court went contrary to the holding of Osborne. This first of these cases was ''Drozda v. State'' (1920). This case examined an instance of libel on the leaders of a Bohemian national organization. The court dismissed their claim, stating that "A government or other body politic, a corporation, religious system, race of people, or a political party, are not subject to criminal libel. Nor could a publication referring generally to any of these be made specific or libelous."&lt;ref&gt;''Drozda v. State'', 1920&lt;/ref&gt; This judge believed that since the libel in question was directed towards "those people whom you call leaders", there was not sufficient evidence that those claiming to have been libeled against actually had any comments directed towards them.

The court in ''People v. Edmonson'' (1930) also denied claims to an apparent case of group libel. In this case, the defendant was accused of libel towards the Jewish community. The judge sided with the defendant, writing that "such an indictment cannot be sustained under the laws of this State, and that no such indictment as one based upon defamatory matter directed against a group or community so large as 'all persons of the Jewish Religion' has ever been sustained in this or any other jurisdiction". The judge further said that "when one realizes how many forms of religion might consider themselves libeled and seek legal redress, where our laws so extended, and when we reflect on how our courts might, in such event, find themselves forced into the position of arbiters of religious truth, it is apparent that more would be lost than could be gained by attempting to protect the good name of a religion by an appeal to the criminal law".&lt;ref&gt;''People v. Edmondson'', 1930&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the judge finds that it would be unreasonable to expect courts to take on the responsibility of deciding whether statements towards a religion should or should or should not be considered libel. Though group libel generally favored the Osborne holding prior to the Beauharnais case, there is also a well documented record of United States courts taking a position which more closely resembles that of the Orme and Nutt holding.

======''Beauharnais v. Illinois''======

''Beauharnais v. Illinois'' is one of the better known cases of group libel in the United States judicial system. Joseph Beauharnais was arrested in 1950 for distributing leaflets in Chicago. Within these leaflets, Beauharnais called upon the Chicago government to take action to address "the constant and continuous invasion, harassment and encroachment by the Negro". An Illinois law outlawed the distribution of any material which "portrays depravity, criminality, unchastity, or lack of virtue of a class of citizens, of any race, color, creed or religion which said publication or exhibition exposes the citizens of any race, color, creed or religion to contempt, derision, or obloquy or which is productive of breach of the peace or riots".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;''Beauharnais v. Illinois'', 1952&lt;/ref&gt; Beauharnais disagreed with this law, and believed that his publications should be viewed as protected speech rather than group libel.

In a 5–4 decision, the court found Beauharnais guilty of libel. In his majority opinion, Justice Frankfurter wrote that Beauharnais' comments provoked hostility, and, given Illinois' history of racial tensions, should be outlawed.

Justice Black, in his dissent, stated that he believed that the statute could be abused to protect speech that otherwise should not be protected. However Frankfurt disagreed and said that "Every power may be abused, but the possibility of abuse is a poor reason for denying Illinois the power to adopt measures against criminal libels sanctioned by centuries of Anglo-American law."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Group libel laws, according to Frankfurt, played an important role in the history of common law, and its existence prevents speech that could lead to violence from being recognized as protected speech.

Though the ''Beauharnais'' case seemed to set a strong precedent protecting criminal group libel laws at the time, subsequent cases took a stance which more strongly favors speech protections. ''R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul'' (1992) is one of the most notable of these cases. In St. Paul, Minnesota, it was a crime to place something in public which could cause "anger, alarm, or resentment ... on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, or gender". Representing the unanimous court that held the ordinance invalid on its face, Justice Scalia explained and qualified the categorical exclusions for defamation, obscenity, and fighting words. These categories of speech are not "entirely invisible to the Constitution", but instead "can, consistently with the First Amendment, be regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable content".&lt;ref&gt;''R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, Scalia believed that the St. Paul law was a clear case of viewpoint-based discrimination, and therefore unconstitutional.

The Court in ''Virginia v. Black'' (2003) held in a 7–2 decision that its opinion in ''R. A. V.'' did not make it unconstitutional for a state to prohibit burning a cross with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons because it prevents intimidation rather than discriminate on the basis of a defendant’s beliefs. In her opinion, Justice O'Connor wrote that "as a factual matter it is not true that cross burners direct their intimidating conduct solely to racial or religious minorities. ... The First Amendment permits Virginia to outlaw cross burning done with the intent to intimidate because burning a cross is a particularly virulent form of intimidation. Instead of prohibiting all intimidating messages, Virginia may choose to regulate this subset of intimidating messages".&lt;ref&gt;Virginia v. Black, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; She clarified that "a State may choose to prohibit only those forms of intimidation that are most likely to inspire fear of bodily harm".

Justice Thomas dissented to this holding, giving similar to arguments made for prohibiting flag burning. He wrote that all cross burning should be exempt from the 1st amendment "due to the historical association of cross-burning with terrorism".

Justice Souter had his own opinion, defending all cross burning, even those acts which are committed to cause fear because of ''R. A. V.'', citing a problem with "the statute's content-based distinction".

While common law has traditionally interpreted group libel laws in a way which protects against defamation, subsequent United States court holdings such as that in ''R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul'' (1992) and ''Virginia v. Black'' (2003) have taken a stance that is more protective of free speech.

Crimes of calumny, defamation and slanderous allegation ''(injurias)'' have been abolished in the Federal Penal Code as well as in 15 states. These crimes remain in the penal codes of 17 states, where penalty is, in average, from 1.1 years (for ones convicted for slanderous allegation) to 3.8 years in jail (for those convicted for calumny).&lt;ref&gt;[http://periodistas.scyma.info/?q=node/1 Delitos de injuria, difamación y calumnia en los códigos penales de México]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721232755/http://periodistas.scyma.info/?q=node%2F1 |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australasia===

====Australia====
[[Law in Australia|Australian law]] tends to follow the English law of defamation, though there are differences introduced by statute and by the implied constitutional limitation on governmental powers to limit speech of a political nature established in ''[[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|25|1997|litigants=Lange v Australian Broadcasting Company |parallelcite=(1997) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 520 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, uniform defamation laws were introduced across Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/sessionalview/sessional/act/2005-77.pdf |title=''Defamation Act 2005'' (NSW).|publisher=legislation.nsw.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws made a number of changes to the common law position, including:

* Abolishing the distinction between [[libel]] and [[slander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/sessionalview/sessional/act/2005-77.pdf |title=''Defamation Act 2005'' (NSW) s 7.|publisher=legislation.nsw.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Providing new defences including that of triviality, where it is a defence to the publication of a defamatory matter if the defendant proves that the circumstances of publication were such that the plaintiff was unlikely to sustain any harm.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/sessionalview/sessional/act/2005-77.pdf|title=''Defamation Act 2005'' (NSW) s 24.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=legislation.nsw.gov.au|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The defences against defamation may be negated if there is proof the publication was actuated by malice.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On 10 December 2002, the [[High Court of Australia]] delivered judgment in the Internet defamation case of ''[[Dow Jones v Gutnick]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|56|2002|litigants=Dow Jones and Company Inc v Gutnick |link=Dow Jones v Gutnick |parallelcite=(2002) 210 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 575 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The judgment established that internet-published foreign publications that defamed an Australian in their Australian reputation could be held accountable under Australian defamation law. The case gained worldwide attention and is often said, inaccurately, to be the first of its kind. A similar case that predates ''Dow Jones v Gutnick'' is ''[[Berezovsky v Michaels|Berezovsky v Forbes]]'' in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Law Lords Department |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldjudgmt/jd000511/bere-1.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817003348/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldjudgmt/jd000511/bere-1.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2000-08-17 |title=House of Lords – Berezovsky v. Michaels and Others Glouchkov v. Michaels and Others (Consolidated Appeals) |publisher=Parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the various common law jurisdictions, some Americans have presented a visceral and vocal reaction to the ''Gutnick'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.barrons.com/public/article/SB109848511439553629.html |title=Letter From the Editor – Barron's Online |publisher=Online.barrons.com |date=2004-10-25 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the decision mirrors similar decisions in many other jurisdictions such as England, Scotland, France, Canada and Italy.

Uniform defamation law reform came into effect in Australia on 1 January 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Huan Linda. [http://www.stephens.com.au/StephensLawyersConsultants2196/Page/24043/TheUniformDefamationLaws2006.aspx The Uniform Defamation Laws Reform 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219034046/http://www.stephens.com.au/StephensLawyersConsultants2196/Page/24043/TheUniformDefamationLaws2006.aspx |date=2017-02-19 }} at Stephens Lawyers &amp; Consultants, Melbourne, 2006. Retrieved 1 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; severely restricting the right of corporations to sue for defamation (see e.g. ''Defamation Act 2005'' (Vic), s 9). This makes defamation laws across states and territories similar. The only corporations excluded from the general ban are not-for-profit corporations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Newsletter ordered to pay RSPCA $100,000 for libel|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/newsletter-ordered-to-pay-rspca-100000-for-libel-20111130-1o62n.html#ixzz1gT1SB2mD|accessdate=14 December 2011|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or those with fewer than ten employees and not affiliated with another company.  Corporations may, however, still sue for the tort of [[injurious falsehood]], where the burden of proof is greater than for mere defamation, because the plaintiff must show that the defamation was made with malice and resulted in economic loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Jack Herman |author2=David Flint |url=http://www.presscouncil.org.au/pcsite/fop/auspres.html |title=Australian Press Council – Press Law in Australia |publisher=Presscouncil.org.au |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112041621/http://www.presscouncil.org.au/pcsite/fop/auspres.html |archivedate=2010-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 reforms also established across all Australian states the availability of truth as an unqualified defense; previously a number of states only allowed a defense of truth with the condition that a public benefit existed. The defendant needs to prove that the defamatory imputations are substantially true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; Australian Law Reform Commission, 1979 |url=http://www.efa.org.au/Issues/Censor/defamation.html |title=Electronic Frontiers Australia: civil liberties online |publisher=Efa.org.au |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers for plaintiffs often use the initial high expense of lodging a defense to their advantage, demanding the immediate payment of tens of thousands of dollars from potential defendants. Even though a plaintiff may have little chance of winning defamation action, or even having the courts accept the case, the unpredictable outcomes of such cases usually sees defence lawyers asking for large payments before any legal work begins, and advising clients to pay the out-of-court demands.

The law as it currently stands in Australia was summarized in the 2015 case of Duffy v Google by [[Malcolm Blue|Justice Blue]] in the [[Supreme Court of South Australia]].&lt;ref name="Duffy v Google"&gt;{{cite AustLII|SASC|170|2015|litigants=Duffy v Google Inc |pinpoint=158 |courtname=auto |date= 27 October 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=The tort can be divided up into the following ingredients:
*the defendant participates in publication to a third party of a body of work;
*the body of work contains a passage alleged to be defamatory;
*the passage conveys an imputation;
*the imputation is about the plaintiff;
*the imputation is damaging to the plaintiff’s reputation.&lt;ref name="Duffy v Google"/&gt;{{rp|para 158}}}}

A more recent case in defamation law was ''Hockey v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited'' [2015], heard in the Federal Court of Australia.&lt;ref name="2015 FCA 652"&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|652|2015|litigants=Hockey v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This judgment was significant as it demonstrated that tweets, consisting of even as little as three words, can be defamatory, as was held in this case.&lt;ref name="2015 FCA 652"/&gt;

====New Zealand====
New Zealand received English law with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in February 1840. The current Act is the Defamation Act 1992 which came into force on the 1 February 1993 and repealed the Defamation Act 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1992/0105/latest/whole.html ''Defamation Act 1992'' New Zealand] as at 1 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand law allows for the following remedies in an action for defamation: compensatory damages; an injunction to stop further publication; a correction or a retraction; and in certain cases, punitive damages. Section 28 of the Act allows for punitive damages only when a there is a flagrant disregard of the rights of the person defamed. 

As the law assumes that an individual suffers loss if a statement is defamatory, there is no need to prove that specific damage or loss has occurred.  However, Section 6 of the Act allows for a defamation action brought by a corporate body to proceed only when the body corporate alleges and proves that the publication of the defamation has caused or is likely to cause pecuniary loss to that body corporate.

The following defences are allowed: 
* Truth — where the defendant proves that the words were true, or not materially different from the truth; or where all or any of the matter contained in a publication taken as a whole was in substance true, or was in substance not materially different from the truth.
* Honest opinion – where a defendant must prove that the opinion expressed is the defendant’s genuine opinion. The defence of honest opinion shall not necessarily fail if the defendant was motivated with malice.
* Absolute privilege – regarding the publication of proceedings in Parliament, and judicial proceedings and other legal
matters.

===Religious law===
The Hebrew term [[lashon hara]] is the [[halakha|halakhic]] term for derogatory speech about another person.&lt;ref name="jewfaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/speech.htm|title=Judaism 101: Speech and Lashon Ha-Ra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lashon hara'' differs from defamation in that its focus is on the use of true speech for a wrongful purpose, rather than falsehood and harm arising. By contrast, ''hotzaat shem ra'' ("spreading a bad name"), also called ''hotzaat diba'', consists of untrue remarks, and is best translated as "slander" or "defamation". ''Hotzaat shem ra'' is worse, and consequently a graver sin, than ''lashon hara''.&lt;ref name="jewfaq"/&gt;

In [[Roman Catholic]] theology there are seen to be two sins, that of lying and that of impinging on a person's right to a reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Slander}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be closed to [[detraction]], the [[sin]] of revealing previously unknown faults or sins of another person to a third person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-02-17|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04757a.htm|title=Detraction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related torts==
Some jurisdictions have a separate [[tort]] or delict of "[[verbal injury]]", "[[intentional infliction of emotional distress]]", "outrageousness", or "convicium", involving the making of a statement, even if truthful, intended to harm the claimant out of malice; some have a separate tort or delict of "[[invasion of privacy]]" in which the making of a true statement may give rise to liability: but neither of these comes under the general heading of "defamation". Some jurisdictions also have the tort of "[[false light]]", in which a statement may be technically true, but so misleading as to be defamatory. There is also, in almost all jurisdictions, a tort or delict of "[[misrepresentation]]", involving the making of a statement that is untrue even though not defamatory. Thus a surveyor who states a house is free from risk of flooding has not defamed anyone, but may still be liable to someone who purchases the house relying on this statement.  Other increasingly common claims similar to defamation in U.S. law are claims that a famous trademark has been diluted through tarnishment, see generally [[trademark dilution]], "[[Tortious interference|intentional interference with contract]]", and "negligent misrepresentation".

Criminal laws prohibiting protests at funerals, [[sedition]], false statements in connection with elections, and the use of profanity in public, are also often used in contexts similar to criminal libel actions.

The boundaries of a court's power to hold individuals in "contempt of court" for what amounts to alleged defamatory statements about judges or the court process by attorneys or other people involved in court cases is also not well established in many common law countries.

'''Ferdinand Fellmann''' (born 1939) is a German philosopher. After the expulsion of his family in 1946 out of Hirschberg (now [[Jelenia Góra]], [[Poland]]) Fellmann grew up in Hameln/Weser (Germany).

==Biography==
Fellmann studied at the [[University of Münster]] and the [[University of Pavia]], promoted by the “Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes” (German National Merit Foundation).  He graduated from his studies in English and Romance Languages and Literature in 1959. From 1962–1965 Fellmann continued his studies in Giessen (Germany). He studied there under his most influential professors: Professor of Romance Languages and Literature, Hans Robert Jauss, and Professor of Philosophy, [[Hans Blumenberg|Blumenberg]]. Due to the conflict between Jauss, a former SS-Man, and [[Hans Blumenberg|Blumenberg]], who was a victim of persecution by the Nazi Regime, Fellmann sought out to find his own way of thinking. In 1967 Fellmann completed his doctorate in Bochum  and in 1973 he finished his postdoctoral lecture qualification (“Habilitation”) in Münster. A representation of his relation to [[Hans Blumenberg|Blumenberg]] can be found in the ''Journal Information Philosophie'' (2008, Issue 3, 49-54).

Fellmann was appointed Professor of Philosophy in 1980. In 1985, he occupied the position of Guest Professor in Naples (Italy) and translated texts of [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Giambattista Vico]], and [[Benedetto Croce]]. Later he moved away from historicism and towards systematic themes. In opposition to the dominance of analytic philosophy at the German universities, Fellmann remained devoted to continental (“alteuropäisch”, old European) philosophical tradition. In 1994 he was appointed “Gründungsprofessor” of philosophy at Chemnitz University of Technology, where he worked on synthesizing idealistic and materialistic forms of thought. His concept of philosophy as practical orientation appears in his book entitled ''Orientierung Philosophie: was sie kann, was sie will'' [Orientation Philosophy: What You Can, What You Want To], first published in 1998. Several of Fellmann's colleagues opposed the book, calling it destructive to academic tradition. After being emeritus professor in 2005, Fellmann served as a Visiting Professor in Vienna (Austria) and Trento (Italy). He currently lives in Münster. As unconventional thinker, he does not belong to any particular philosophical community. In his homepage he  ironically refers to himself as the  Accademico di nulla accademia, “Academic of no Academy”.

==Academic work==
Fellmann's thought developed from the Philosophy of History to Philosophical Anthropology. Man is always in the focus of his interest, but the perspective is always changing from upside down from the idea of history to bottom up from the human world of life. There are four distinguished phases:

'''1. Philosophy of history'''

Fellmann's entrance into academic discussion followed from the publication of his book, ''Das Vico-Axiom: Der Mensch macht die Geschichte'' [The Vico-Axiom: The man makes the history] (1976). Contrary to the influential, idealistic conception of history presented in Hegel's philosophy of spirit, Fellmann interprets Giambattista Vico's'' The New Science'' in light of cultural anthropology. Thus, man is the only originator of history, however, he cannot govern the course of history with will or consciousness. Fellmann's conception of history was strongly attacked by the Idealists as well as by the Materialists. For the Idealists, his conception of history was too naturalistic, and the Marxists accused his work of being a “spätbürgerlicher” revisionism. Currently, Fellmann interprets philosophy of history formally as the theory of historical consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Fellmann, F. (2015) Historisches Bewusstsein in der postmodernen Lebenswelt [Historical Consciousness in the Postmodern Lifeworld], in: St. Haas, Cl. Wischermann (ed.):  Die Wirklichkeit der Geschichte [The Reality of History]. Stuttgart (Franz Steiner Verlag), 113-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2. Phenomenology and hermeneutics'''

In the 1980s Fellmann shifted his focus to the phenomenological account of the theory of consciousness. In ''Phänomenologie als ästhetische Theorie'' (1989) he interprets [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]'s teachings of phenomenological ideation (“Wesensschau”) with the example of the photographic snapshot as a case of aesthetic perception of the general in the particular. A further development of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] as a general media theory by Fellmann is presented in his book ''Phänomenologie zur Einführung'' (3. edition 2015). In his theory of mental imagery (“Bildbewusstsein”), Fellmann turns against the popular dogma of the exclusively linguistic construction of the world. In many essays, he works out the logic of the image as an autonomous, symbolic form, located between sign and language.&lt;ref&gt;''Innere Bilder im Licht des imagic turn'', in: Klaus Sachs-Hombach (ed.): Bilder im Geiste. Philosophy and Representation, vol. 3, Amsterdam – Atlanta, GA (Rodopi) 1995, 21-38.&lt;/ref&gt; He explains the primate of image consciousness in his book, ''Symbolischer Pragmatismus: Hermeneutik nach [[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey]]'' (1991), as an “imagic turn” (different from the current “pictorial turn”) — indicating by this term that images possess a magical dimension that cannot be completely resolved in intentionality. In a recent article Hermes und Pandora Fellmann shows how the mythical background still is present in modern hermeneutic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Fellmann, F. (2017) Hermes und Pandora. Perspektiven philosophischer Hermeneutik. Article in press.&lt;/ref&gt;

3.'''Philosophy of life, art of living'''

Insight into the limitations of  the epistemological theory of consciousness led Fellmann after 1990 to a turning point in his thinking towards a modern [[philosophy of life]]. In his book ''Lebensphilosophie. Elemente einer Theorie der Selbsterfahrung'' (1993) it is clearly recognizable that he does not believe that the destruction of reason forms the core of “Lebensphilosophie”. Rather, he sees that man as a rational being will always have to deal with uncontrollable desires and emotions that frustrate reasonable intentions. These emotions cannot and should not be transformed into reasons, because they offer humans stability and support in behaviour. This approach to [[Philosophy of life]] led Fellmann to an ethic with strong utilitarian and hedonistic traits. In ''Die Angst des Ethiklehrers vor der Klasse. Ist Moral lehrbar?'' (2000) and in ''Philosophie der Lebenskunst zur Einführung'' (2009), he makes clear that  practical ethics can only be developed on the foundation of a realistic idea of human life. Fellmann has recently translated a key text of Confuzius into German to underpin his view of life through an intercultural perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Konfuzius, Das Buch von Maß und Mitte, übers. und eingeleitet von F. Fellmann, Stuttgart 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''4. Philosophical anthropology'''

Fellmann's philosophical anthropology has found its provisionally definite expression in a widely discussed book'' Das Paar. Eine erotische Rechtfertigung des Menschen'' [The Couple: An erotic Justification of Man] (2005). In analogy to the Pauline doctrine of justification (''justificatio sola fide''), Fellmann interprets justification as an emotional bonding with a loved one that cannot be replaced by rational reasons.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of Fellmann’s concept of erotic justification from a theological point of view see Ingolf Dalferth, Mehr als Zwei. Von der Logik der Relation zur Hermeneutik des Drittten, in: Archivio di Filosofia/Archives of Philosophy LXXIV, Pisa/Roma 2006, 123–137.&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect Fellmann's concept of emotional justification opposes the epistemic conception of justification and truth held by Jürgen Habermas.&lt;ref&gt;Compare Jürgen Habermas, ''Truth and Justification'', MIT Press 2003 with ''Das Paar. Eine erotische Rechtfertigung des Menschen'', Berlin (Parerga) 2005, Kap. 2:  Rechtfertigung - ein vergessener Begriff (Justification – a forgotten concept).&lt;/ref&gt; In Fellmann's view epistemic justification of single actions is not sufficient to support man as a being in constant need of  justification of his contingent existence. He reconstructs erotic love in terms of genetic phenomenology being the source of self-consciousness, a position that he recently sought out to underpin through socio biology.&lt;ref&gt;Fellmann, F. (2009) Das Paar als Quelle des Selbst. Zu den soziobiologischen Grundlagen der philosophischen Anthropologie, Deutsche Zeitschrift für Philosophie 57/5, 745-756.&lt;/ref&gt; In his later essays, Fellmann argues that the „eccentric positionality“ of man's self-consciousness is the outcome of his exceptional sexuality, namely the constant erotic susceptibility apart from procreation.&lt;ref&gt;Fellmann, F. (2010) The Origin of Man Behind the Veil of Ignorance: A Psychobiological Approach. Biological Theory 5(3), 240-245.&lt;/ref&gt; His attempt to connect biology and philosophy has been acclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;Fellmann, F. (2013) Emotional Selection and Human Personality. Biological Theory, 8 (1),  64-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Especially the hypothesis of emotional selection and the step from sexuality to eroticism as essential for the process of hominization is currently discussed by both parties as controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Fellmann, F. (2016). Eroticism: Why it Still Matters. Psychology, 7, 976-983. https://dx.doi.org/10.4236/psych.2016.77098&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fellmann, F., &amp; Walsh, R. (2016). From Sexuality to Eroticism: The Making of the Human Mind. Advances in Anthropology, 6, 11-24. https://dx.doi.org/10.4236/aa.2016.6100&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellmann's philosophical position is outstanding in German academic tradition by his attempt to transform the fundamental questions of metaphysics and ontology into anthropological descriptions and practical devices. His work shows a sound historical knowledge reformulated in the scope of a realistic reconstruction of the human world of life including the various forms of symbolic representation. Thus, he avoids a naturalistic reduction balancing out transcendental idealism and pragmatic realism. The philosopher to whom Fellmann refers in most of his texts is [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], the father of modern [[Philosophy of Life]], regarding the world as Will and Representation.&lt;ref&gt;Fellmann, F. (2016). Vom Cogito zur Lebenswelt. Drehkreuz Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer und die Deutung der Existenz, hg. Th. Regehly, D. Schubbe, Stuttgart, 9-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fellmann, F.

Russell]], who co-wrote the screenplay with [[Jeff Baena]].

A self-named "existential comedy", ''I ♥ Huckabees'' follows a couple of detectives ([[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Lily Tomlin]]), hired to investigate the meaning of the life of their clients ([[Jude Law]], [[Jason Schwartzman]], [[Mark Wahlberg]], and [[Naomi Watts]]). As the different investigations cross paths, their rival and nemesis ([[Isabelle Huppert]]) tries to drag their clients into her own views on the meaning of their lives. It also features the screen debuts of [[Jonah Hill]] (in a minor role) and [[Ger Duany]].

==Plot==
Albert Markovski is a young man who heads the local chapter of an environmental group, the "Open Spaces Coalition". One of their current projects is an attempt to stop the building of a new Huckabees store, a chain of "[[Big-box store|big-box]]" department stores. Albert is a rival of Brad Stand, a shallow power executive at Huckabees. Brad infiltrates Open Spaces and charismatically displaces Albert as the leader. Dawn Campbell is Brad's live-in girlfriend and the face and voice of Huckabees; she appears in all of the store's commercials.

After seeing the same conspicuous stranger three times, Albert contacts two [[Existentialism|existential]] detectives, Bernard, and Vivian Jaffe. The detectives offer Albert their optimistic brand of existentialism—they name it ''universal interconnectivity'' (which has some tenets of [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] philosophies)—and spy on him, ostensibly to help him solve the coincidence. Bernard and Vivian introduce Albert to Tommy Corn, an obsessively anti-petroleum firefighter. Tommy is assigned to Albert as his '[[Other (philosophy)|other]]'.

Tommy grows dissatisfied with the Jaffes, feeling that they are not helping him. Seeking out other possibilities, Tommy ends up abandoning and undermining the Jaffes by introducing Albert to Caterine Vauban, a former student of the Jaffes who espouses a seemingly opposing [[Nihilism|nihilistic]]/[[Absurdism|absurdist]] philosophy. She teaches them to disconnect their inner beings from their daily lives and their problems, to synthesize a non-thinking state of "pure being." Being lifted from their troubles, they wish to keep that feeling forever, yet she tells them that it is inevitable to be drawn back to the human drama, and to understand that the core truth of that drama is misery and meaninglessness.

In order to prove her point, Caterine takes Albert to go and have sex in the woods, leaving Tommy behind. Tommy finds out about the two of them being together and feels hurt. Caterine tells him that they found each other through all of the human suffering and drama. Tommy rejects this idea and leaves them, furious and lost. Meanwhile, in Brad's further attempts to undercut Albert, he and Dawn meet with and are influenced by Bernard and Vivian. In the following days, Brad and Dawn rethink their entire lives: Dawn rejects the modeling world and looks for deeper meaning, while Brad realizes that his whole ascent on the corporate ladder is meaningless, as he has lived his whole life just trying to please others and not himself.

All the storylines collide when Brad's house catches fire. While the fire trucks get stuck in a traffic jam, Tommy comes on his bicycle to put out the fire, which incidentally trapped Dawn inside. As he saves her life, the two fall in love. Meanwhile, Brad despairs at the destruction of his house, the symbol of his material success. Albert attains a sort of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] when he synthesizes the two opposing outlooks of the Jaffes and Vauban to realize the cosmic truth of everything. Brad, meanwhile, is fired from Huckabees, leaving him rudderless. Albert reveals to Brad that he burned Brad's jet skis, and the fire spread to the house. Albert understands that he and Brad are no different, that everything really is inextricably connected, but that these connections necessarily arise from the often senselessly painful reality of human existence. Having realized this, he refers Brad to Caterine, hoping she will help him as she did Albert and Tommy. Albert and Tommy talk later about everything that has happened. As the two talk, Caterine and the Jaffes watch them, concluding that they can close both of their cases.

===Director commentary===
In an interview with the [[SuicideGirls]] website, director Russell said in response to the question "How do you describe ''I Heart Huckabees''?": {{cquote|Here’s how I described it to the people who financed the movie: Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin are existential detectives who you could hire to investigate the meaning of your life.

==Production==
Before directing his first feature, ''[[Spanking the Monkey]]'', Russell intended to make a film  "about a guy who sits in the back of a Chinese restaurant with microphones on every table to surreptitiously listen to everybody’s conversations, then write perversely personal fortunes for each of the people." &lt;ref name="AFIindie"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidlin|first1=Charlie|title=AFI: David O. Russell Talks Immediacy Of Film, Says ''I Heart Huckabees'' Is His Least Favorite Movie &amp; More|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/11/afi-david-o-russell-talks-immediacy-of-film-says-i-heart-huckabees-is-his-least-favorite-movie-more-91774/|website=Indiewire|accessdate=21 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321171235/http://www.indiewire.com/2013/11/afi-david-o-russell-talks-immediacy-of-film-says-i-heart-huckabees-is-his-least-favorite-movie-more-91774/|archivedate=March 21, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitting a [[writer's block]], Russell could not figure out how to make the film work. In the meantime Russell was called for [[jury duty]], after which he stopped writing the film. Ideas in the script stayed with him though and they would later form the basis for the Huckabee script.&lt;ref name="AFIindie"/&gt; The final idea came to Russell in a dream where "This female detective she was not following me for criminal reasons, but she was following me for spiritual and metaphysical reasons." Russell, who makes a habit of writing his dreams down, knew instantly upon reading his summary of the dream that this was the story he wanted to pursue.&lt;ref name="filmfour"&gt;{{cite web|title=David O Russell on I Heart Huckabees|url=http://www.film4.com/special-features/interviews/david-o-russell-on-i-heart-huckabees|website=Film4|accessdate=21 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321165625/http://www.film4.com/special-features/interviews/david-o-russell-on-i-heart-huckabees|archivedate=March 21, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, two videos were leaked onto [[YouTube]] portraying on-set arguments between Russell and Tomlin, in which among other things he called her sexist names. When the ''[[Miami New Times]]'' asked Tomlin about the videos, she responded, "I love David. There was a lot of pressure in making the movie—even the way it came out you could see it was a very free-associative, crazy movie, and David was under a tremendous amount of pressure. And he's a very free-form kind of guy anyway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What a Character. She's had her brush with online infamy.

===Soundtrack===
{{Main|I Heart Huckabees (soundtrack)}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
[[Jon Brion]] provided the score and seven original songs for the film. His unique methods for writing previous film scores (''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]'', ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'') involved very close collaboration with the director. Through this process, David O. Russell was able to sit in the same room with Brion and watch an early cut of the film. Russell described what he wanted to portray and Brion would compose music to Russell's descriptions. The process can be seen on a featurette on the film's special edition DVD.

David O. Russell, while working with Brion, had come across Brion's first solo album, ''[[Meaningless (album)|Meaningless]]''. Russell has mentioned that Brion's album asks similar questions to the ones Russell was trying to ask with ''I Heart Huckabees''. In particular, Russell notes that the questions on ''Meaningless'' are closer to the questions directed from Caterine Vauban's negative and dark point of view.

Many cues used in the film feature a [[Chamberlin]], a keyboard instrument from the 1950s that replicates instrumental sounds using recorded tape.

===Marketing===
In an advertising campaign for the film, four fictional websites were created. They were portrayed as if they were actual websites involving the characters and organizations featured in the film. Each website had a link called "Disclaimer" at the bottom that leads to FOX Searchlight's [https://web.archive.org/web/20041001090202/http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/huckabees/ official website] for the film. Websites were rendered inactive a few months after release, each now redirecting to FOX Searchlight's website.

'''Ideocracy''' (a [[portmanteau word]] combining "ideology" and ''kratos'', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for "power") is "governance of a state according to the principles of a particular (political) ideology; a state or country governed in this way".&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[government]] based on a [[monism|monistic]] [[ideology]] — as distinct from an [[authoritarian]] state which is characterized by strong central power and limited political freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Piekalkiewicz | first1=Jaroslaw | last2=Penn | first2=Alfred Wayne | title=The Politics of Ideocracy | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Politics_of_ideocracy.html?id=xC6FAAAAMAAJ | location=Albany | publisher=State University of New York Press | year=1995 | isbn=978-0791422984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Backes | editor1-first=Uwe | editor2-last=Kailitz | editor2-first=Steffen | title=Ideokratien im Vergleich: Legitimation – Kooptation – Repression | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cyVcAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=ideokratien+im+vergleich&amp;hl=de | location=Göttingen | publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht | year=2013 | isbn=978-3525369623}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ideocratic state can either be [[totalitarian]]—citizens being forced to follow an ideology—or [[populist]] (citizens voluntarily following an ideology).&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Wayne Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Every government has ideological bases from which assumptions and policies are drawn, but ideocracies are governments wherein one dominant ideology has become deeply ingrained into politics and, generally, politics has become deeply ingrained into all or most aspects of society. The ideology of an ideocracy presents itself as an absolute, universal, and supreme system for understanding social life, much as a [[god]] in a [[monotheism|monotheistic belief system]].

==Analysis==

[[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]] used the term ''ideocracy'' in 1936, and it was given added currency by [[Nicholas Berdyaev]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Wayne Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', pp. 20, 182.&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|date=December 2017}}

An ideocracy may take a [[totalitarian]] form, reliant on force, or a [[populist]] form, reliant on the voluntary support of true believers. The totalitarian form contains six components; 1) [[ideology]], 2) a single party typically with one leader, 3) a terroristic police, 4) a monopoly of communications, 5) a monopoly of weaponry, 6) a centrally directed or [[planned economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Wayne Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Piekalkiewicz and Penn, in addition, an ideocracy such as a strict Islamic state or Nazi Germany, will suppress [[Academic freedom|scientific research and knowledge]] if it conflicts with the ideology,&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Wayne Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;
Piekalkiewicz and Penn, argue that every state is either organic (the organized expression of a community, within which all individuals are dependent and subsumed, as the fingers belong to the body), or mechanical/pragmatic (an artificial concept in which individuals have rights against the state and are co-equal). As [[Adlai Stevenson II]] has said, "Since the beginning of time governments have been engaged in kicking people around. The astonishing achievement in modern times is the idea that citizens should do the kicking".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Rupert Emerson]], ''From Empire to Nation'', Beacon Press, 1963, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ideocracies derive [[political legitimacy]], in the view of Piekalkiewicz and Penn, from one of the following ideological sources:  nation, race, class, or culture.&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; They also believe that ideocrats will [[Scapegoating|project their own feelings of guilt onto groups of people]]—Jews, communists, capitalists, heretics—as forces undermining the ideocracy. These [[scapegoat]]s symbolize the forces that true believers must combat within themselves. Blame for failures of policy is diverted away from the ideocrats onto the scapegoats, who are subjected to mob attacks, terrorism, [[show trial]]s, and stylized punishments.&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Wayne Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', pp. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; In Hitler's Germany the drive to exterminate the Jews eventually took priority over every other goal.&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Wayne Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens of [[Pluralist democracy|pluralist]] states may emigrate freely, but those who leave an ideocracy may be branded as traitors.&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Wayne Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological aspects==

Individuals within ideocracies develop an [[authoritarian personality]], say Piekalkiewicz and Penn, in order to succeed or survive. Long after the collapse of the ideocracy, these individuals remain resistant to [[democratization]].&lt;ref&gt; Piekalkiewicz and Penn , p 190-1 &lt;/ref&gt; They develop a [[closed mind]] in which their self-realization within the ideocracy overrides the hostility of the 'heretical' outside world. Simple slogans are adopted and repeated as signs of conformity and loyalty. &lt;ref&gt; Piekalkiewicz and Penn p 44-5 &lt;/ref&gt; Those who disbelieve the ideology are [[fatalistic]], supporting the system because they feel powerless to change it, or [[Machiavellian]], cynically exploiting the system for their own ends. Both groups develop a form of [[doublethink]]&lt;ref&gt; Piekalkiewicz and Penn, p 52-5 &lt;/ref&gt;

A small minority of [[self-actualisers]], tolerant of ambiguity, are able to resist the monistic belief system and continue to search long-term for new ideas and complex answers.&lt;ref&gt; Piekalkiewicz and Penn , p56 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Inception, stabilization and evolution==

According to Piekalkiewicz and Penn, ideocracies rise and fall in the following manner;

===Inception===
a) Civil war:  As in the USSR, China, Cuba, Yugoslavia. In order to establish the ideocracy, there must be a ruthless charismatic leader:  a Lenin, Mao, Castro, Tito.&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Wayne Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', pp. 128, 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

b) Takeover:  Usually a political party with a determined leader ("the leader is the movement")&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Wayne Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; takes power by [[coup d'état]], which creates a [[bandwagon effect]]:&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Wayne Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  as in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Wayne Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', pp. 20, 182.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Wayne Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

c) In an isolated colony:  e.g., White South Africa, and the [[Puritans]] of [[New England]]&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Wayne Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stabilization===

This usually takes 10-15 years. The leader is no longer a Prophet, but is now deified. There is a [[purge]] of followers, and bureaucratization of the state and party.&lt;ref&gt; Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'' p 140-1 &lt;/ref&gt; The economy is nationalized, and totally mobilized in support of the ideocracy.&lt;ref&gt; Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'' p142'4 &lt;/ref&gt; There will be scapegoating of enemies and terrorizing of [[dissident]]s.&lt;ref&gt; Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'' p145 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===

a) Self-destruction. One or more of the following may cause decline. The ideocracy may split into 'warring camps'. It may be ended by a military coup, as in [[Peronist]] [[Argentina]]. There may be a popular rebellion. The economy may stagnate, as demands exceed ability. There may be external attacks by other states which fear the spread of the ideology,&lt;ref&gt; Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'' p149-53 &lt;/ref&gt;

b) Peaceful erosion. A new generation matures which is less fervent and more tolerant of pluralism. Technological developments and artistic expression (for example, the plays of [[Vaclav Havel]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]) erode faith in the ideology. The leadership become a less-effective self-serving, careerist elite.&lt;ref&gt; Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'' p154-61 &lt;/ref&gt;

c) Regeneration may prevent or postpone collapse. The ideology is rethought and adapted, or replaced by a completely new set of ideals.&lt;ref&gt; Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'' p163 &lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Poland, communist ideocracy failed in 1980, the recognition of [[Lech Walesa]]'s [[Solidarity]] Trade Union leading to a military coup and authoritarian military rule. Romanian communism ended abruptly in 1989 and again the military took over, trying and executing [[Nicolae Ceaușescu|Ceaușescu]].&lt;ref&gt; Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', p 221 &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Piekalkiewicz and Penn described [[Pharaonic Egypt]], ancient [[Babylon]], the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca]] empires, [[Sparta]], the [[Islamic empire]], [[Imperial Russia]] and [[Imperial China]] as ideocracies&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, SUNY Press, 1995, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and cite [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s [[Yugoslavia]],&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Peronist [[Argentina]], &lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iraq]] under [[Saddam]],&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; the USSR, [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]]'s Portugal, Albania, the [[Warsaw pact]] countries,&lt;ref&gt; Piekalkiewicz and Penn, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Imperial Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; as among those that rose and fell in the 20th century. Both Catholic and Protestant extremists in [[Northern Ireland]] sought ideocratic solutions, but were thwarted by British troops.&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, p. 116-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Uwe Backes]] and [[Steffan Kailitz]], the [[USSR]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Uwe Backes]] and [[Steffan Kailitz]], eds., ''Ideocracies in Comparison'', Taylor and Francis, 2015, chapter six.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy under [[Fascism]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Uwe Backes]] and [[Steffan Kailitz]], eds., ''Ideocracies in Comparison'',  Taylor and Francis, 2015, chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Uwe Backes]] and [[Steffan Kailitz]], eds., ''Ideocracies in Comparison'', Taylor and Francis, 2015, chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany)&lt;ref&gt;[[Uwe Backes]] and [[Steffan Kailitz]], eds., ''Ideocracies in Comparison'', Taylor and Francis, 2015, chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; all rose and fell as ideocracies during the 20th century.

The Populist form of ideocracy has been an important force in Latin American political history, where many [[charismatic leader]]s have emerged since the beginning of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Guillermo A. O'Donnell, ''Bureaucratic authoritarianism: Argentina, 1966–1973, in comparative perspective''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4639">'''Igor Markovich Yefimov''' or '''Igor Efimov''' (Russian: И́горь Ма́ркович Ефи́мов; born August 8, 1937, [[Moscow]]) is an American philosopher, historian, writer and publisher of Russian origin. Some of his works were published under the pen name '''Andrei Moscovit'''. Together with {{ill|Boris Vakhtin|ru|Вахтин, Борис Борисович}}, [[Sergei Dovlatov]], {{ill|Vladimir Gubin|ru|Губин, Владимир Андреевич}}, and {{ill|Vladimir Maramzin|ru|Марамзин, Владимир Рафаилович}}, he founded the [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] writers' group "Townspeople" ({{ill|Gorozhane|ru|Горожане (литературная группа)}}), whose works circulated in [[samizdat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cornwell|first1=Neil|title=Reference Guide to Russian Literature|date=2013|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=Hoboken|isbn=9781134260706|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the founder of Hermitage Publishers; a company specializing in Russian writers.

== Biography ==
In 1960, he graduated from the [[Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University|Leningrad Polytechnic Institute]]. He then attended the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute]]; graduating in 1973. He joined the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] in 1965. He originally wrote stories for children and pieces for Soviet radio and television as well as screenplays. It was not known until after he left the Soviet Union, in 1978 by way of Austria, that he had written ''Practical Metaphysics'' and ''Metapolitics'' under the pseudonym Andrei Moscovit.

After arriving in the United States, he worked for [[Ardis Publishing]] until 1981, when he established his own company to print works, both contemporary and classic, that could not be published in the USSR. The writers who were first presented by Heritage include [[Sergei Sergejewitsch Awerinzew|Sergei Averintsev]], [[Vasily Aksyonov]], [[Friedrich Gorenstein|Fridrikh Gorenstein]], [[Lev Losev]], [[Anatoly Naiman]], [[Ernst Neizvestny]] and {{ill|Mark Popovsky|ru|Поповский, Марк Александрович}}.

Since 1991, most of his works have appeared in Russia. Many originally appeared in the literary journal ''[[Zvezda (magazine)|Zvezda]]'' (Star). In 2005, he published ''The Noble Prankster'', a memoir of [[Joseph Brodsky]]. This was followed by a new work of philosophy, ''The Shameful Mystery of Inequality''. Five of his works are available in English and a book on the [[Assassination of President Kennedy]] was published in France.

All the critics who have written about Yefimov have noted the philosophical nature of his prose; Brodsky described him as belonging "to the great Russian tradition of philosophical writers in the vein of [[Alexander Herzen|Herzen]]."&lt;ref&gt;Panconesi, Emiliano, and Irina Dvisova, [http://circolorosselli.it/040510CV.htm "La letteratura riabilitata: da Nabokov e Cvetaeva a Solženicyn e Brodskij"]. In Proc. Conf. ''Circolo di Cultura Politica Fratelli Rosselli'', Florence, 2004. Retrieved on 9 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his books also have another characteristic, noted by {{ill|Yakov Gordin|ru|Гордин, Яков Аркадьевич}} in his foreword to the Russian edition of the novel ''Arkhivy Strashnogo Suda'' (The Judgment Day Archives): "The real hero of Yefimov's prose has always been human passion. To put it in other words - will in arousal."

It is a code based on the [[Declaration of Geneva]] and the main goal is to establish the ethical principles of the physicians worldwide, based on his duties in general, to his patients and to his colleagues.

==History==
After the approval of the [[Declaration of Geneva]], the II General Assembly of the [[World Medical Association]] analysed a report on "War Crimes and Medicine". This prompted the [[World Medical Association|WMA]] Council to appoint another Study Committee to prepare an International Code of Medical Ethics, which after an extensive discussion, was adopted in 1949 by the III General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wma.net/en/60about/70history/index.html|title=History|date=15 June 2009|work=wma.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206154153/http://www.wma.net/en/60about/70history/index.html|archivedate=6 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31998">'''International legal theory''' comprises a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches used to explain and analyse the content, formation and effectiveness of [[public international law]] and institutions and to suggest improvements. Some approaches center on the question of compliance: why states follow international norms in the absence of a coercive power that ensures compliance. Other approaches focus on the problem of the formation of international rules: why states voluntarily adopt international legal norms, that limit their freedom of action, in the absence of a world legislature. Other perspectives are policy oriented; they elaborate theoretical frameworks and instruments to criticize the existing rules and make suggestions on how to improve them. Some of these approaches are based on domestic [[legal theory]], others are [[interdisciplinary]], while others have been developed expressly to analyse international law.

== Classical approaches to international law ==
=== Natural law ===
Many early international legal theorists were concerned with [[axiom]]atic truths thought to be reposed in [[natural law]]. 16th century natural law writer, [[Francisco de Vitoria]], a professor of [[theology]] at the University of [[Salamanca]], examined the questions of the [[just war]], the Spanish authority in the [[Americas]], and the rights of the Native American people.

=== Eclectic or Grotian approach ===
[[Hugo Grotius]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[theologian]], [[humanism|humanist]] and [[jurist]] played a key role in the development of modern international law. In his ''[[De jure Belli ac Pacis Libri Tres]]'' ("Three Books on the Law of War and Peace") of 1625, and drawing from the [[Bible]] and from the [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine's]] [[just war]] theory, he argued that nations as well as persons ought to be governed by universal principle based on [[morality]] and [[Divine retribution|divine justice]]. Drawing, though, from domestic [[contract law]], he argued that relations among polities ought to be governed by the law of peoples, the ''[[jus gentium]]'', established by the consent of the community of nations on the basis of the principle of ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'', that is, on the basis of the observance of commitments. On his part, [[Christian von Wolff]], contended the international community should be a world superstate (''civitas maxima''), having authority over the component member states. [[Emmerich de Vattel]] rejected this view and argued instead for the equality of states as articulated by 18th century natural law. In ''Le droit des gens'', Vattel suggested that the law of nations was composed of custom and law on the one hand, and natural law on the other.

During the 17th century, the basic tenets of the Grotian or [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] school, especially the doctrines of legal equality, territorial sovereignty, and independence of states, became the fundamental principles of the European political and legal system and were enshrined in the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]].

=== Legal positivism ===
The early [[legal positivism|positivist]] school emphasized the importance of custom and treaties as sources of international law. Early positivist scholar [[Alberico Gentili]] used historical examples to posit that positive law (''jus voluntarium'') was determined by general consent. Another positivist scholar, [[Richard Zouche]], published the first manual of international law in 1650.

Legal positivism became the dominant legal theory of 18th century and found its way into international legal philosophy. At the time, [[Cornelius van Bynkershoek]] asserted that the bases of international law were customs and treaties commonly consented to by various states. [[John Jacob Moser]] emphasized the importance of state practice in international law. [[Georg Friedrich von Martens]], published the first systematic manual on positive international law, ''Precis du droit des gens moderne de l'Europe''.  During the 19th century, positivist legal theory became even more dominant due to [[nationalism]] and the [[Hegelian]] philosophy. International [[Commercial law]] became a branch of domestic law: [[private international law]], separate from public international law. Positivism narrowed the range of international practice that might qualify as law, favouring [[rationality]] over [[morality]] and [[ethic]]s. The 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]] marked the formal recognition of the political and international legal system based on the conditions of Europe.

Modern legal positivists consider international law as a unified system of rules that emanates from the states' will. International law, as it is, is an "[[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]" reality that must be distinguished from law "as it should be." Classic positivism demands rigorous tests for [[law|legal]] [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Extralegal arguments, i.e., arguments that have no textual, systemic or historical basis on the law, are deemed irrelevant to legal analysis. There is only hard law, no [[soft law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruno Simma]] and Andreas L.Paulus "Symposium on method in International Law: The Responsibility of Individuals for Human Rights Abuses in Internal Conflicts: A Positivist View" 93 American Journal of International Law 302  (April, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms of positivist international legal theory include its rigidity, its focus on state consent, without allowing for interpretation, and the fact that it does not allow moral judgements regarding a State's conduct as long as it follows international norms.

== International relations – international law approaches ==

Legal scholars have drawn from the four main schools of thought in the areas of [[political science]] and [[international relations]]:  [[Realism in International relations|realism]], [[Liberal international relations theory|liberalism]], [[Institutional liberalism|institutionalism]], and [[Constructivism in international relations|constructivism]] to examine, through an [[interdisciplinary]] approach, the content of legal rules and institutions, to explain why and how legal institutions came to be and why they are effective.&lt;ref&gt;Abbot, Kenneth W. "Symposium on Method in International Law: International Relations Theory, International Law and the Regime Governing Atrocities in Internal Conflicts." (1999): 361-378&lt;/ref&gt; These methods have led some scholars to reconceptualize international law in general.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne-Marie Slaughter]]; Andre S. Tulumello; Stepan Wood, International Law and International Relations Theory: A New Generation of Interdisciplinary Scholarship, 92 American Journal of International Law 367-397 (1998) at p. 369: "We identify three ways that lawyers are using materials and insights from IR theory:to diagnose substantive problems and frame better legal solutions; to explain the structure or function of particular international legal rules or institutions; reconceptualize or reframe particular institutions or international law generally."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Realism ===
[[Realism in International relations|Realism]] contends that, in an anarchic international system, states main objective is for survival that obligates them to maximize their relative power in order to preserve their territory and existence. Since international cooperation is possible only inasmuch as it responds to the states' self-interest in maximizing their power and prospects for survival, states do not pursue cooperation on the basis of normative commitments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans J. Morgenthau]], Positivism, Functionalism, and International Law, 34 American Journal of International Law 260 (1940)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Realist legal scholars, states adopt only international legal norms that either enhance their power, formalize the subordination of weaker states, or that they intend to violate deliberately to their own advantage.&lt;ref&gt;[[William C. Bradford]], [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=555894 In The Minds of Men: A Theory of Compliance with the Laws of War] (2004) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; International Law may thus address only  peripheral matters that do not impact the states´ power or autonomy. Consequently, for realists, international law is a "tenuous net of breakable obligations"&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Hoffmann]], Conditions of World Order 364 (1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Realist approach, some scholars have proposed an "enforcement theory" according to which international legal norms are effective insofar as they "publicize clear rules, enhance monitoring of compliance, and institutionalize collective procedures for punishing violations, thereby enhancing the [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrent]] and coercive effects of a stable [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[William C. Bradford]], [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=555894 In The Minds of Men: A Theory of Compliance with the Laws of War] (2004) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the role of [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] and [[International sanctions|sanctions]] is underlined. Morrow, for instance, notes that:
{{quote|International politics in modern times generally recognizes no authority above the nation-state. Agreements among states are enforceable only by the agreeing states themselves. This assumption of anarchy poses a paradox for agreements to limit violence during wartime. (...) Reciprocity serves as the main tool to enforce agreements in international politics. Enforcement of an agreement is devolved to the parties themselves. Damaged parties have the option to respond with retaliatory sanctions to a violation of an agreement. The threat of reciprocal sanctions may be sufficient to deter violations, and so agreements can be enforced in international politics.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Morrow, [http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/fordcenter/conferences/conflict_fall08/morrow11-8-08.pdf The Laws of War as an International Institution], p. 1 (2008) See also: James D. Morrow, Laws of War, Common Conjectures, and Legal Systems in International Politics, 31 Journal of Legal Studies 41 (2002): "International Law must be self-enforcing to be effective. Successful self-enforcement of law among states requires either that they must be willing to live up to their legal obligations regardless of what others do or that reciprocity must deter violations."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Liberalism ===
Based on the [[Liberal international relations theory]], some scholars argue that the states' stance towards international law is determined by their domestic politics and, in particular, by the aggregation of the preferences of key domestic individuals and groups toward the [[rule of law]]. Thus, [[Liberal democracy|democratic states]], having a [[representative government]], are more likely than non-democratic states to accept the legal regulation of both domestic and international politics, and more likely to accept and observe international law. Furthermore, democratic societies are linked by a [[Complex interdependence|complex net of interstate, transnational and transgovernmental relations]] so that both their foreign policy bureaucracies and their [[civil society|civil societies]] are interested in promoting and strengthening transnational cooperation through the creation and observance of international legal norms.&lt;ref&gt;[[William C. Bradford]], [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=555894 In The Minds of Men: A Theory of Compliance with the Laws of War] (2004) p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the adoption of and the compliance with international legal norms among democratic states should be easier and more peaceful than the observance of international law among non-democratic states. In this regard, [[Anne-Marie Slaughter|Slaughter]] notes that:
{{quote|Agreements concluded among liberal States are more likely to be concluded in an atmosphere of mutual trust, a precondition that will facilitate any kind of enforcement. In particular, however, the assumptions that these are agreements reached with the participation of a network of individuals and groups in the participating States, and that these States are committed to the rule of law enforced by national judiciaries should lead to more 'vertical' enforcement through domestic courts. This mode of enforcement contrasts with the traditional 'horizontal' mode involving [[State responsibility]], [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]], and countermeasures.&lt;ref&gt;Anne-Marie Slaughter, International Law in a World of Liberal States, 6 European Journal of International Law (1995) p. 532.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Rational choice and game theory ===
This approach to law applies [[theories]] or [[economics]] to identify the legal implications of maximizing behavior inside and outside of markets. Economics is the study of rational choice under limited conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hawley, Frederick Barnard. "The Definition of Economics".The American Economic Review, Vol. 3, No. 3. (September 1913), 606-609 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1804421]&lt;/ref&gt; Rational choice is the assumption that individual actors seek to maximize their preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Hawley 1913, 606-609&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the economic theory employed here is [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] traditional economics. Economic techniques include price theory, which evaluates strategic interaction between actors.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, David. Human Rights in International Relations (Cambridge University Press 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Transaction cost economics, which incorporates cost of identifying actors, negotiating, and costs of enforcing agreements into price theory. [[Game Theory]] can demonstrate how actors with maximizing behavior might fail to take action increase join gain.&lt;ref&gt;"Game Theory." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 13 Mar. 2008  [http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9109420]&lt;/ref&gt; Public choice applies economic tools to problems outside of markets.
These tools are used to describe and evaluate law. Using these tools, laws are tested for economic efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1149277|title=International Law: The Trials of Global Norms|journal=Foreign Policy|first=Steven R.|last=Ratner|date=1 January 1998|publisher=|issue=110|pages=65–80|doi=10.2307/1149277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic theories are also used to propose changes in the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Druzin|first=Bryan|year=2014|title=Opening the Machinery of Private Order: Public International Law as a Form of Private Ordering|url=https://works.bepress.com/bryan_druzin/10/|journal=Saint Louis University Law Journal|volume=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach urges the adoption of laws that maximize wealth.
Potential application of this approach would begin with a text-based interpretation. A secondary concern is whether or not an actual "market" context is functioning well. Thirdly, ways to improve the imperfect market are proposed.
This approach could be used to analyze general legal questions, because this approach provides highly specified rules and provides the rationale for using them.
This approach relies on assumptions that [[perfect competition]] exists, and that individuals will behave to maximize their preferences. The empirical presence of these conditions is often difficult to determine.

=== International legal process ===
The classic International Legal Process is the method of studying how international law is practically applied to, and functions within international policy, as well as the study of how international law can be improved.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell, Mary Ellen. "Symposium on Method in International Law". The American Society of International Law American Journal of International Law, 1999), 334.&lt;/ref&gt; "It concentrates not so much on the exposition of rules and their content as on how international legal rules are actually used by the makers of foreign policy".&lt;ref name="O'Connell (1999), 334"&gt;O'Connell (1999), 334.&lt;/ref&gt; ILP was developed in response to the "[[legal realism|realists]] from the discipline of international relations",&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell (1999), 336.&lt;/ref&gt; who realized with the beginning of the [[Cold War]] how little international law played a role in international affairs. ILP was made a legitimate theory in the 1968 casebook International Legal Process, by Chayes, Ehrlich and Lowenfeld, in which the American legal process method was adapted to create an international legal process.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell (1999), 335.&lt;/ref&gt; ILP describes the way international legal processes work, and the formal and informal ways that foreign offices incorporate international law.&lt;ref name="O'Connell (1999), 334" /&gt; ILP also measures the extent to which individuals are held accountable for abuses in international conflicts.&lt;ref name="O'Connell (1999), 337"&gt;O'Connell (1999), 337.&lt;/ref&gt; While ILP recognizes that international law does not force decision makers' actions, it suggests that international law serves as a justification, constraint, and organizing device.&lt;ref name="O'Connell (1999), 337" /&gt; Criticism of ILP's lack of normative qualities in its method resulted in the emergence of a new ILP.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell (1999), 338.&lt;/ref&gt;
The New International Legal Process (NLP) incorporates both law as a process and as the values of each society respectively. Unlike the American Legal System, it considers normative values other than democracy, such as "…[[feminism]], [[republicanism]], law and economics, [[liberalism]] as well as human rights, peace and protection to the environment."&lt;ref&gt;O’Connell (1999), 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The NLP is unique in its flexibility in adapting to the evolution of values. This component of the method is important in order to resolve the changing of legal standards over time. The NLP
shows its true departure from the ILP by addressing what happens in the situation of conflict, as well as what should be happening.

== Policy oriented perspectives ==
=== New Haven School ===
The New Haven School is a policy-oriented perspective on international law pioneered by [[Myres S. McDougal]], [[Harold Lasswell|Harold D. Lasswell]], and [[W. Michael Reisman]].&lt;ref&gt;Reisman, Michael. "The View from the New Haven School of International Law" International Law in Contemporary Perspective (Foundation Press, New York, NY 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Its intellectual antecedents lie in sociological [[jurisprudence]] of [[Roscoe Pound]] and the reformist ambitions of the [[Legal realism|American Legal Realists]]. From the standpoint of the New Haven approach, jurisprudence is a theory about making social choices. International law itself reflects the expectations of relevant community members about stable patterns of behavior created by assertions of control by legal authorities.  The primary jurisprudential and intellectual tasks are the prescription and application of policy in ways that maintain community order and simultaneously achieve the best possible approximation of the community's social goals.&lt;ref&gt;Reisman (2004), 2&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] social goals or values of the New Haven approach include maximizing shared community values, such as wealth, enlightenment, skill, well-being, affection, respect and rectitude.&lt;ref&gt;Reisman (2004), 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The teleological goal of New Haven School jurisprudence is the interpretation of international law as a system of creating minimum world public order, with continued progress toward the development of shared values into an optimum order.

=== Critical Legal Studies ===
[[Critical Legal Studies]] (CLS) emerged as a legal theory in America during the 1970s. It exists to this day as a method of analyzing international law from a highly theoretical perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, Richard &amp; Zasloff, Jonathan. "Power and International Law" 100 AM. J. Int'l L. 64, 64 – 87 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The method proposes that the nature of international law is limited because it is determined by language, which is biased and still stuck in the conventional structures of politics and power.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Malcolm N. "International Law" (5th ed. 2003) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Critical Legal scholars argue that those structures of power can be found within the binaries that exist in legal language&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg &amp; Zasloff (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; (man vs. woman, majority vs. minority, etc.). Recognizing the political aspect of international law, these scholars also argue that universality is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of this method suggests that this radical practice is impossible to put into application. It was successful, however, in pushing forward other approaches to international law ([[feminism|feminist]], [[cultural relativism|cultural relativist]], etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Lillich, Richard B. "International Human Rights: Problems of Law, Policy, and Practice" (4th ed. 2006) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; because of its deep analysis of language, and all the imbalance that it reveals.

=== Central case approach ===
The central case approach is a method of looking at human rights situations. This approach recognizes the existence of certain universal rights.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, Tai-Heng. "The Central Case Approach to Human Rights." ''[[Pacific Rim Law &amp; Policy]]'' 13:257 (2004), 260.&lt;/ref&gt; It begins analyzing a human rights issue by constructing a hypothetical ideal situation in which those rights are applied, a standard against which to compare an actual situation. The central case approach then investigates to what extent, and in what ways the actual situation deviates from the ideal (or the central case).&lt;ref name="Cheng(2004), 260"&gt;Cheng(2004), 260.&lt;/ref&gt;
The central case approach allows for more complexity than the traditional binary method of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng(2004), 258.&lt;/ref&gt; In binary terms, human rights are simply violated or they are upheld.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng(2004), 257.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not allow for degrees of severity of a [[human rights]] violation, which creates a deceptively simplistic view of a situation.

[[John Finnis]] developed the concept of a central case as it applied to assessing legal systems;&lt;ref&gt;Finnis, John. "Natural Law and Natural Rights." 9-11 (H.L.A. Hart ed., 1986)(1996)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tai-Heng Cheng]] was the first to apply it to human rights. If used by decision-makers, the central case approach could be effective in preventing human rights abuses. It takes into account a society's political and social situations in addition to specific human rights abuses.&lt;ref name="Cheng(2004), 260" /&gt; This enables it to detect trends of human rights abuses, and the reasons behind these trends. The depth of a central case analysis exposes the different degrees of human rights abuses that occur, allowing policy makers to focus on the most severe cases and patterns of abuse with more urgency.
The central case approach provides an accurate and flexible picture of situations that are in a state of change.&lt;ref name="Cheng(2004), 261"&gt;Cheng(2004), 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas a binary appraisal would conclude whether a human right had been violated at one point in time, the central case approach can detect shifting political and social conditions and patterns that give a more nuanced view of the state of human rights.&lt;ref name="Cheng(2004), 261" /&gt;

=== Feminist legal theory ===
Feminist legal theory critiques current [[legal writing|legal vocabulary]] and practice by arguing it is [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], presenting men as the norm and women as a deviation from the norm. Feminist theorists propose to change legal language to make it more inclusive of women, or to rethink law completely, so it is possible to promote broader social goals of justice and equality. Feminist methods seek to expose the biases from which international law is written and particularly the notion that women are more vulnerable than men and need special protection under the law. Feminist theorist [[Hilary Charlesworth]] criticizes the dialogue of women as victims in need of protection from both men and international law. Additionally, she argues that the irony of the dominant language is that while it aims to especially protect women, the emphasis is on the protection of her honor and not on the protection of her social, cultural and economic rights.

=== LGBT legal theory ===
[[LGBT|Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender/Transsexual]] (LGBT) International Law Theory is a critical school of thought that continues to develop as the shortcomings of international law are realized, in regard to the [[wikt:integration|integration]] of [[queer theory]] into international law theory. While human rights conventions have recently begun to generalize in regard to equality and its recipients, in the past, any discussions of [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] have gone largely untouched. The movement of LGBT International Law Theory centers on the inclusion and awareness of LGBT rights (and protection of persons), as well as the integration of queer theory within the realm of international law.
As LGBT theory has become more prominent in scholarly works, [[international court]]s and [[international organization|international law organizations]] (particularly the [[European Union]] Council and the [[United Nations]]) have considered [[workplace discrimination]] on the basis of sexuality, issues stemming from the definition of family in regard to [[civil union|homosexual unions]], the position of
[[transsexualism|transsexuals]] in the question of sexual orientation, the need for recognition of LGBT rights in regard to general health advocacy and the [[HIV/AIDS]] crisis, the inclusion of and LGBT advocacy group within the UN (with advisor status), and the ongoing active persecution of people engaging in homosexual acts, among other issues.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Douglas.  "Human Rights And Sexual Orientation in International Law."  11 November 2005.  International Gay and Lesbian Law Association&lt;/ref&gt;
According to scholar [[Nancy Levit]], the challenges for gay legal theory are twofold: to move away from the frailties of both formal equality and antisubordination theories, and to develop ways of representing sexual minorities that will make them more acceptable, if not valuable, in a broader cultural context, that is the critical body of LGBT International Law Theory.&lt;ref&gt;Levit, Nancy. "A Different Kind of Sameness: Beyond Formal Equality and Antisubordination Principles in Gay Legal Theory and Constitutional Doctrine" (Ohio State Law Journal, Vol. 61, 2000) p. 867.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International law in Ancient Rome ===
The idea of international law in Roman times is a complicated one. For, not only does the [[Roman Republic]] and following empire itself dominate a long period of time in history, but also the very debate over whether or not the term "international law" is an applicable term is not yet decided.&lt;ref&gt;Lesaffer, Randall. "Argument from Roman Law in Current International Law: Occupation and Acquisitive Prescription" Volume 16, Number 1 (European Journal of International Law 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars and authors define international law as "the law governing relations between sovereign, territorial states."&lt;ref name="Lesaffer (2005), 25-58"&gt;Lesaffer (2005), 25-58&lt;/ref&gt;
Any attempt to find a similar parallel in [[Roman law]] would find a logical starting point in the [[ius gentium]] (the laws of nations).&lt;ref&gt;Mousourakis, George "The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law" (Ashgate Publishing company, 2003), 22&lt;/ref&gt; The ius gentium began as a Roman recognition of like legal practices and institutions (such as [[slavery]]) that was found at that time in most states.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis (2003), 23"&gt;Mousourakis (2003), 23&lt;/ref&gt; This brand of law was in fact [[private law]] in itself and mainly dictated the way in which the Roman state was to deal with individual foreigners, not entire states.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis (2003), 23" /&gt; However, when [[citizenship]] was granted to all free men in the empire in 212 A.D. ius gentium ceased to cling to its original definition and instead was applied to states as a whole.&lt;ref name="Lesaffer (2005), 25-58" /&gt; Some semblance of modern international law can therefore be found in this shift. The actual extent of these origins and their relevance to modern law is a topic that has not yet been approached in any depth.

=== Third World ===
[[Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL)]] is a critical approach to international law that is not a "method" in the strict sense of questioning "what the law is". Rather, it is an approach to law that is unified by a particular set of concerns and analytical tools with which to explore them. It is an approach that draws primarily from the history of the encounter between international law and colonized peoples. TWAIL shares many concepts with [[post-colonial]] studies, [[feminist theory]], [[Critical legal studies]], [[Marxist theory]] and [[critical race theory]]. TWAIL scholarship prioritizes in its study the power dynamic between the [[First World]] and [[Third World]] and the role of international law in legitimizing the subjugation and oppression of Third World peoples. TWAIL scholars try to avoid presenting the "Third World" as a unified, coherent place but rather use the term to indicate peoples who have the shared experience of underdevelopment and marginalization.

Contemporary TWAIL scholarship has it origins in works of jurists such as B. S. Chimni, [[Georges Abi-Saab]], [[F. Garcia-Amador R.P. Anand]], [[Mohammed Bedjaoui]], and [[Taslim O. Elias]]. Over the years, several Western scholars have been sympathetic to the Third World's position and made important contributions to this body of scholarship, and these include, scholars such as [[C.H. Alexandrowicz]], [[Richard Falk]], [[Nico Schrijver]] and [[PJ.I.M. de Waart]]. [[David Kennedy (jurist)|David Kennedy]] and [[Martti Koskenniemi]] have also contributed support in their own work. TWAIL as a loose network of scholars has had several conferences thus far.

'''James K.&amp;nbsp;A. Smith''' (born 1970) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[philosopher]] who is currently Professor of Philosophy at [[Calvin College]], holding the Gary &amp; Henrietta Byker Chair in Applied Reformed Theology &amp; Worldview. He is a notable figure associated with [[radical orthodoxy]], a theo-philosophical movement within [[postmodern Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Blog Comment at Women in Theology|url=http://womenintheology.org/2013/10/23/resisting-the-kingdom-women-in-the-gym-theological-optimism-and-the-liturgical-deformation-of-inclusion/#comment-8345}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work is undertaken at the borderlands between philosophy, theology, ethics, aesthetics, science, and politics. Drawing from [[continental philosophy]] and informed by a long Augustinian tradition of theological cultural critique—from [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[John Calvin]] to [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and [[Abraham Kuyper]]—his interests are in bringing critical thought to bear on the practices of the church and the church's witness to culture, culminating in the need to interpret and understand what he has called "cultural liturgies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Desiring the Kingdom: Worship, Worldview, and Cultural Formation |url=http://www.calvin.edu/january/2010/smith.htm|work=January Series at Calvin College|publisher=Calvin College|accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Smith was born in 1970 in [[Embro, Ontario]].&lt;ref name=ContempAuth&gt;{{cite web|title=James K.A. Smith|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CH1000175851&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=kirk10507&amp;it=r&amp;p=LitRC&amp;sw=w|work=Contemporary Authors Online|publisher=Gale|accessdate=10 June 2013|location=Detroit|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his undergraduate studies at the [[University of Waterloo]] and [[Emmaus Bible College (Iowa)|Emmaus Bible College]]. He earned a [[Master of Philosophy]] degree in [[philosophical theology]] in 1995 at the [[Institute for Christian Studies]]&lt;ref name=ContempAuth /&gt; where he studied under [[James Olthuis]].&lt;ref name="Smith 2005, p. xiii"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=James K.&amp;nbsp;A. |year=2005 |title=Jacques Derrida: Live Theory |location=London |publisher=Continuum |page=xiii |isbn=978-0-8264-6280-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to receive a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1999 from [[Villanova University]]&lt;ref name=ContempAuth /&gt; where he was advised by {{citation needed span |date=February 2018 |text=the noted deconstructionist}} [[John D. Caputo]].&lt;ref name="Smith 2005, p. xiii"/&gt; After teaching for a short time at [[Loyola Marymount University]], Smith accepted his current position at [[Calvin College]].

He currently resides in [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]].

==Work==
{{Original research section|date=May 2014}}
As a former proponent of [[radical orthodoxy]], Smith's claim is that it is actually ''theology'' or, more specifically, the story told by the church that is capable of countering modernism. His popular-level work largely aims at educating evangelicals regarding postmodernism and radical orthodoxy. Though he is critical of the [[emergent church]] movement, it should be said that he is at the same time sympathetic to much that could be described as part of that movement. It seems that a primary concern in his work is to expose certain postmodern philosophical claims (and certain ecclesial attempts to work with them) as not actually postmodern enough, pointing out instead that they too have accepted the agenda set by the enlightenment.  This is seen in his warnings that the emergent tendency away from historic ecclesial tradition is a grave mistake, and that putting down roots, committing to a community for the long haul, and engaging the deep discourses within historic Christian orthodoxy are in fact the truly post- or counter-modern practices for the church today.

Given his training in [[continental philosophy]] and in the theology of the [[Reformed]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] traditions, his intellectual interests are a natural fit. Smith's research topics range from the continental philosophy of religion to urban altruism to the relationship between science and theology.

'''Jean-Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert'''&lt;ref&gt;His last name is also written as '''D'Alembert''' in English.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|æ|l|ə|m|ˈ|b|ɛər}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/d'alembert "Alembert, d'"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ batist lə ʁɔ̃ dalɑ̃bɛːʁ|lang}}; 16 November 1717 – 29 October 1783) was a French mathematician, [[mechanics|mechanician]], [[physicist]], philosopher, and [[music theorist]]. Until 1759 he was co-editor with [[Denis Diderot]] of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. [[D'Alembert's formula]] for obtaining solutions to the [[wave equation]] is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Alembert|1747a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Alembert|1747b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Alembert|1750}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The wave equation is sometimes referred to as [[d'Alembert's equation]].

==Early years==
Born in Paris, d'Alembert was the [[illegitimate child|natural son]] of the writer [[Claudine Guérin de Tencin]] and the chevalier [[Louis-Camus Destouches]], an [[artillery]] officer. Destouches was abroad at the time of d'Alembert's birth. Days after birth his mother left him on the steps of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Saint-Jean-le-Rond de Paris|fr|3=Église Saint-Jean-le-Rond de Paris}} church. According to custom, he was named after the [[patron saint]] of the church. D'Alembert was placed in an [[orphanage]] for [[child abandonment|foundling]] children, but his father found him and placed him with the wife of a [[glazier]], Madame Rousseau, with whom he lived for nearly 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1906|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She gave him little encouragement. When he told her of some discovery he had made or something he had written she generally replied, 

{{quote|You will never be anything but a philosopher - and what is that but an ass who plagues himself all his life, that he may be talked about after he is dead.&lt;ref&gt;''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge'', Vol I, London, Charles Knight, 1847, p.417.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Destouches secretly paid for the education of Jean le Rond, but did not want his [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] officially recognised.

==Studies and adult life==
D'Alembert first attended a private school. The chevalier Destouches left d'Alembert an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] of 1200 [[French livre|livres]] on his death in 1726. Under the influence of the Destouches family, at the age of twelve d'Alembert entered the [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] [[Collège des Quatre-Nations]] (the institution was also known under the name "Collège Mazarin"). Here he studied philosophy, law, and the arts, graduating as ''[[Bachelor of Arts|baccalauréat en arts]]'' in 1735.

In his later life, d'Alembert scorned the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] principles he had been taught by the [[Jansenism|Jansenists]]: "physical promotion, innate ideas and the vortices". The Jansenists steered d'Alembert toward an [[ecclesiastical]] career, attempting to deter him from pursuits such as poetry and [[mathematics]]. Theology was, however, "rather unsubstantial fodder" for d'Alembert. He entered law school for two years, and was nominated ''[[Lawyer|avocat]]'' in 1738.

He was also interested in medicine and mathematics. Jean was first registered under the name "Daremberg", but later changed it to "d'Alembert". The name "d'Alembert" was proposed by [[Frederick the Great| Frederick the Great of Prussia]] for a suspected (but non-existent) moon of Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Ley, Willy. 1952. Article "Moon of Venus" in ''Galaxy Science Fiction July 1952''. MDP Publishing Galaxy Science Fiction Digital Series, 2016.

==Career==
[[File:Alembert - Nouvelles expériences sur la résistance des fluides, 1777 - 14723.jpg|thumb|''Nouvelles expériences sur la résistance des fluides'']]
{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Scientists}}
In July 1739 he made his first contribution to the field of mathematics, pointing out the errors he had detected in ''[[Analyse démontrée]]'' (published 1708 by [[Charles-René Reynaud]]) in a communication addressed to the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des Sciences]]. At the time ''L'analyse démontrée'' was a standard work, which d'Alembert himself had used to study the [[foundations of mathematics]]. D'Alembert was also a [[Latin]] scholar of some note and worked in the latter part of his life on a superb translation of [[Tacitus]], for which he received wide praise including that of [[Denis Diderot]].

In 1740, he submitted his second [[science|scientific]] work from the field of [[fluid dynamics|fluid mechanics]] ''Mémoire sur la réfraction des corps solides'', which was recognised by [[Alexis Clairault|Clairaut]]. In this work d'Alembert theoretically explained [[refraction]].

In 1741, after several failed attempts, d'Alembert was elected into the Académie des Sciences.  He was later elected to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]] in 1746&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hankins|1990|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27alembert%27%29| title= Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher = Royal Society| accessdate= 3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1743, he published his most famous work, ''Traité de dynamique'', in which he developed his own [[D'Alembert's principle|laws of motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Alembert|1743}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ''Encyclopédie'' was organised in the late 1740s, d'Alembert was engaged as co-editor (for mathematics and science) with Diderot, and served until a series of crises temporarily interrupted the publication in 1757. He authored over a thousand articles for it, including the famous ''[[Preliminary Discourse]]''. D'Alembert "abandoned the foundation of [[Materialism]]"&lt;ref name=lange&gt;[[Friedrich Albert Lange]], ''[[History of Materialism and Critique of its Present Importance]]'', "[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and Materialism"&lt;/ref&gt; when he "doubted whether there exists outside us anything corresponding to what we suppose we see."&lt;ref name=lange/&gt; In this way, d'Alembert agreed with the [[Idealism|Idealist]] [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] and anticipated the [[transcendental idealism]] of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In 1752, he wrote about what is now called [[D'Alembert's paradox]]: that the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] on a body immersed in an [[viscosity|inviscid]], [[incompressible]] [[fluid]] is zero.

In 1754, d'Alembert was elected a member of the [[Académie des sciences]], of which he became Permanent Secretary on 9 April 1772.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academie-francaise.fr/immortels/base/academiciens/fiche.asp?param=219 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531092038/http://www.academie-francaise.fr/immortels/base/academiciens/fiche.asp?param=219 |date=31 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1757, an article by d'Alembert in the seventh volume of the ''Encyclopedia'' suggested that the Geneva clergymen had moved from [[Calvinism]] to pure [[Socinianism]], basing this on information provided by [[Voltaire]]. The Pastors of Geneva were indignant, and appointed a committee to answer these charges. Under pressure from [[Jacob Vernes]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and others, d'Alembert eventually made the excuse that he considered anyone who did not accept the Church of Rome to be a Socinianist, and that was all he meant, and he abstained from further work on the encyclopaedia following his response to the critique.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith Richardson|1858|pages=8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1781.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music theories==
D'Alembert's first exposure to music theory was in 1749 when he was called upon to review a ''Mémoire'' submitted to the Académie by [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]. This article, written in conjunction with [[Diderot]], would later form the basis of Rameau's 1750 treatise ''Démonstration du principe de l'harmonie''. D'Alembert wrote a glowing review praising the author's deductive character as an ideal scientific model. He saw in Rameau's music theories support for his own scientific ideas, a fully systematic method with a strongly deductive synthetic structure.

Two years later, in 1752, d'Alembert attempted a fully comprehensive survey of Rameau's works in his ''Eléments de musique théorique et pratique suivant les principes de M. Rameau''.&lt;ref name="CT"&gt;{{harvnb|Christensen|1989|p=415}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasizing Rameau's main claim that music was a mathematical science that had a single principle from which could be deduced all the elements and rules of musical practice as well as the explicit Cartesian methodology employed, d'Alembert helped to popularise the work of the composer and advertise his own theories.&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; He claims to have "clarified, developed, and simplified" the principles of Rameau, arguing that the single idea of the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|corps sonore|fr}}'' was not sufficient to derive the entirety of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernard|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Alembert instead claimed that three principles would be necessary to generate the major [[musical mode]], the minor mode, and the identity of [[octaves]]. Because he was not a musician, however, d'Alembert misconstrued the finer points of Rameau's thinking, changing and removing concepts that would not fit neatly into his understanding of music.

Although initially grateful, Rameau eventually turned on d'Alembert while voicing his increasing dissatisfaction with [[J. J. Rousseau]]'s ''Encyclopédie'' articles on music.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', 2nd ed., s.v. "Alembert, Jean le Rond d'"&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a series of bitter exchanges between the men and contributed to the end of d'Alembert and Rameau's friendship. A long preliminary discourse d'Alembert wrote for the 1762 edition of his ''Elémens'' attempted to summarise the dispute and act as a final rebuttal.

D'Alembert also discussed various aspects of the state of music in his celebrated ''Discours préliminaire'' of [[Diderot]]'s ''Encyclopédie''. D'Alembert claims that, compared to the other arts, music, "which speaks simultaneously to the imagination and the senses," has not been able to represent or imitate as much of reality because of the "lack of sufficient inventiveness and resourcefulness of those who cultivate it."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Alembert|1995|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted musical expression to deal with all physical sensations rather than merely the passions alone. D'Alembert believed that modern ([[Baroque]]) music had only achieved perfection in his age, as there existed no classical [[Greeks|Greek]] models to study and imitate. He claimed that "time destroyed all models which the ancients may have left us in this genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Alembert|1995|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He praises Rameau as "that manly, courageous, and fruitful genius" who picked up the slack left by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] in the French musical arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Alembert|1995|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
D'Alembert was a participant in several Parisian [[Salon (gathering)|salons]], particularly those of [[Marie Thérèse Rodet Geoffrin]], of the [[Madame du Deffand|marquise du Deffand]] and of [[Julie de Lespinasse]]. D'Alembert became infatuated with [[Jeanne Julie Éléonore de Lespinasse|Mlle de Lespinasse]], and eventually took up residence with her.

==Death==
He suffered bad health for many years and his death was as the result of a [[urinary bladder]] illness. As a known [[Infidel|unbeliever]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Israel|2011|p=115}}: "D'Alembert, though privately an atheist and materialist, presented the respectable public face of 'la philosophie' in the French capital while remaining henceforth uninterruptedly aligned with Voltaire."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Force|Popkin|1990|p=167}}: "Unlike the French and English deists, and unlike the scientific atheists such as Diderot, d'Alembert, and d'Holbach, such English scientists as David Hartley and Joseph Priestley presented their scientific theories as evidence for their scriptural views."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horowitz|1999|pages=52–53}}: "In positive theory there was a wide divergence between Voltaire's panpsychic deism and Diderot's physiological materialism, or d'Alembert's agnostic positivism and Helvetius' sociological materialism."&lt;/ref&gt; D'Alembert was buried in a common [[unmarked grave]].

==Legacy==
In France, the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] is known as the d'Alembert/[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] theorem, as an error in d'Alembert's proof was caught by Gauss.

He also created his [[ratio test]], a test to see if a [[series (mathematics)|series]] converges.

The [[D'Alembert operator]], which first arose in D'Alembert's analysis of vibrating strings, plays an important role in modern theoretical physics.

While he made great strides in mathematics and physics, d'Alembert is also famously known for incorrectly arguing in ''Croix ou Pile'' that the [[probability]] of a coin landing heads increased for every time that it came up tails. In gambling, the strategy of decreasing one's bet the more one wins and increasing one's bet the more one loses is therefore called ''the [[D'Alembert system]]'', a type of [[Martingale (betting system)|martingale]].

In [[South Australia]], a small inshore island in south-western [[Spencer Gulf]] was named'' Ile d'Alembert'' by the French explorer, [[Nicolas Baudin]] during his [[Nicolas Baudin's expedition to Australia|expedition to New Holland]]. The island is better known by the alternative English name of [[Lipson Island]]. The island is a conservation park and seabird rookery.

==Fictional portrayal==
[[Diderot]] portrayed d'Alembert in "Le rêve de D'Alembert" ("[[D'Alembert's Dream]]"), written after the two men had become estranged. It depicts d'Alembert ill in bed, conducting a debate on materialist philosophy in his sleep.

''D'Alembert's Principle'', a novel by [[Andrew Crumey]] (1996), takes its title from [[D'Alembert's principle]] in physics. Its first part describes d'Alembert's life and his infatuation with [[Julie de Lespinasse]].

'''John Cottingham''' (born 1943) is an English philosopher. The focus of his research has been early-modern philosophy (especially [[René Descartes|Descartes]]), the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[moral philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reading.ac.uk/philosophy/about/staff/j-g-cottingham.aspx University of Reading: John Cottingham (Accessed 7 April 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fest"&gt;Athanassoulis, Nafsika and Vice, Samantha eds. (2008) ''The Moral Life: Essays in Honour of John Cottingham'', Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; He is a Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the [[University of Reading]], Professorial Research Fellow at Heythrop College, University of London, and Honorary Fellow of [[St John’s College, Oxford]]. He is also a current Visiting Professor to the [[Department of Philosophy, King's College London|Philosophy Department]] at [[King's College London|King's College, London]].

Cottingham has served as editor of the journal [[Ratio (journal)|Ratio,]] president of the [[Aristotelian Society]], of the [[British Society for the Philosophy of Religion]], of the [[Mind Association]] and as Chairman of the [[British Society for the History of Philosophy]]. A Festschrift with responses by Cottingham, ''The Moral Life'', was published by Palgrave in 2008.&lt;ref name="fest" /&gt;

Cottingham was educated at Merchant Taylors’ School near [[London]], and [[St John’s College, Oxford]].

== Research ==

===Descartes===
Cottingham introduced trialism as an alternative interpretation of the mind-body dualism of Descartes. Although composed of two substances, mind and body, the human being possesses distinctive attributes in its own right (including sensations, passions, emotions), and these form a third category, that cannot be reduced to thought or extension.&lt;ref&gt;Cottingham, John (1985) ‘Cartesian Trialism’, Mind, XCIV No. 374, April, pp. 218-30. Reprinted in ''René Descartes, Critical Assessments'', ed. G. Moyal (London: Routledge, 1991). Vol. III, pp. 236-248, and Cottingham, ''Cartesian Reflections'', ch. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Cottingham has also argued that Descartes’s view of animals as ‘machines’ does not have the reductionistic implications commonly supposed.&lt;ref&gt;Cottingham, John, ‘A Brute to the Brutes? Descartes’ Treatment of Animals’, Philosophy Vol. 53 (1978), pp. 551-59; repr. in Cottingham, ''Cartesian Reflections'', ch. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Cottingham has explored the importance of Descartes as  a moral philosopher, with a comprehensive picture of the good life that draws both on his scientific work (in physiology and psychology) and also on the theistic outlook that informs all his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Cottingham, John, ''Cartesian Reflections'', chs 1, 12, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Cottingham is co-editor and translator of the three-volume Cambridge edition of ''The Philosophical Writings of Descartes''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff and D. Murdoch (eds), ''The Philosophical Writings of Descartes'', vols I and II (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), and  vol. III, ''The Correspondence'', by the same translators plus A. Kenny (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral philosophy and philosophy of religion===
Cottingham criticizes a putative psychological impoverishment of contemporary moral  philosophy, and argues that any plausible theory of a good and integrated life for human beings needs to draw on the insights available from a broadly [[psychoanalytic]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Cottingham, John, ''Philosophy and the Good Life'', ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  His work on partiality defends the importance of self-concern as a central ingredient in virtue.&lt;ref&gt;See Cottingham ‘The ethics of self-concern’, Ethics 101 (July 1991), pp. 798-817, ‘Partiality and the Virtues’, in R. Crisp (ed.), ''How Should One Live? Essays on the Philosophy of Virtue'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 57-76, and ‘Impartiality and Ethical Formation,’ in B. Feltham and J. Cottingham (eds), ''Partiality and Impartiality: Morality, Special Relationships and the Wider World'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 65-83.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''On the Meaning of Life'', he addresses the relationship between moral, aesthetic and religious modes of awareness in constituting a meaningful life.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Meaning of Life'' (London: Routledge, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Cottingham’s more recent work in the philosophy of religion argues for the primacy of the moral and spiritual aspects of religious allegiance over theoretical and doctrinal components.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spiritual Dimension: Religion, Philosophy and Human Value'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John D. Caputo''' (born October 26, 1940) is an American philosopher who is the Thomas J. Watson Professor of Religion Emeritus at [[Syracuse University]] and the David R. Cook Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at [[Villanova University]]. Caputo is a major figure associated with [[Postmodern Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Camilleri|first=René|title=Reinvent the Church|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20091018/religion/reinvent-the-church.277934|accessdate=August 20, 2012|newspaper=Times of Malta|date=October 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continental Philosophy of Religion, as well as the founder of the theological movement known as [[Postmodern Christianity#Weak Theology|weak theology]]. Much of Caputo's work focuses on [[hermeneutics]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[deconstruction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arlandson|first=James|title=The Deconstructed Jesus|url=http://www.americanthinker.com/2007/04/the_deconstructed_jesus.html|accessdate=August 20, 2012|newspaper=[[American Thinker]]|date=April 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[theology]].

==Education==
Caputo received his B.A. in 1962 from [[La Salle University]], his M.A. in 1964 from [[Villanova University]] and his Ph.D. in philosophy in 1968 from [[Bryn Mawr College]].

==Work==
Caputo is a specialist in contemporary [[continental philosophy]], with a particular expertise in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[hermeneutics]], and [[deconstruction]]. Over the years, he has developed a [[deconstructive]] [[hermeneutics]] that he calls [[radical hermeneutics]], which is highly influenced by the thought of the French philosopher, Jacques Derrida. Additionally, Caputo has developed a distinctive approach to religion that he calls [[Postmodern Christianity#Weak Theology|weak theology]]. Recently, his most important work has been to rebut the charges of [[relativism]] made against deconstruction by showing that deconstruction is organized around the affirmation of certain unconditional ethical and political claims.

Caputo has a special interest in continental approaches to the philosophy of religion. Some of the ideas Caputo investigates in his work include the "religion without religion" of [[Jacques Derrida]]; the "theological turn" taken in recent French phenomenology by [[Jean-Luc Marion]] and others; the critique of [[ontotheology]]; the dialogue of contemporary philosophy with [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Paul of Tarsus]]; and medieval [[metaphysics]] and [[mysticism]]. In the past, Caputo has taught courses on [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Emmanuel Lévinas]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], and [[Jacques Derrida]].

==Positions held==

Caputo taught philosophy at Villanova University from 1968 to 2004.  He was appointed the David R. Cook Professor of Philosophy at [[Villanova University]] in 1993. Caputo was the Thomas J. Watson Professor of Religion at [[Syracuse University]], where he taught in both the departments of philosophy and religion from 2004 until his retirement in 2011.  He is emeritus professor at both Villanova University and Syracuse University and continues to write and lecture in both the United States and Europe. He is active in the [[American Philosophical Association]], the [[American Academy of Religion]], the [[Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy]] and he chairs the board of editors for the Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory.

'''Jordi Camí''' ([[Terrassa]], 1952) is Professor of Pharmacology (specialist in Clinical Pharmacology) at [[Pompeu Fabra University]], General Director of the [[Barcelona Biomedical Research Park]] (PRBB), and Director of the [[Pasqual Maragall Foundation]].

His main research activity has been focused, during more than 20 years, in the Neurosciences field, particularly in the Clinical pharmacology of Drug abuse. He specialized in the evaluation of the effects of the simultaneous consumption of different drugs ([[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[cocaine]], [[THC]]) in humans, and the clinical and pharmacological effects of [[MDMA]] (ecstasy).  One of the first Detoxification Units for heroin addicts in Spain was created in 1981 at the Hospital del Mar of Barcelona under his responsibility. In 1988 he was the founder member and first President of the Spanish Society of Drug Addictions (SET).

Between 1985 and 2005, he was the Director of the Municipal Institute of Medical Research in Barcelona (IMIM), a university institute that he promoted and reorganized until it reached one of the first positions in biomedical research production in the health sector. During this time, he was the promoter of the official accreditation of the Antidoping Laboratory of IMIM by the [[International Olympic Committee]] for antidoping control (official antidoping laboratory in the Olympic Games of Barcelona 1992).

His academic activity has been developed between the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) and the Pompeu Fabra University (UPF), holding different positions in both universities (Vice-chancellor’s delegate, Dean and Chairman of Department). Between 1997 and 2002 he was responsible for the conception and development of the Health and Life Sciences studies at Pompeu Fabra University, studies which include a degree in Human Biology and a Biomedicine PhD given in English. Later, he promoted the creation of new research centres as the Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG) or the Center of Regenerative Medicine in Barcelona (CMRB), and especially he led to the creation of the [[Barcelona Biomedical Research Park]] (PRBB), a centre that he directs since 2005. The PRBB includes, at present, seven research public centres that assemble more than 1,400 people (40% of scientific staff are foreigners) and in which biomedical research takes place from a molecular to a populational perspective, all in an exceptional environment nearby Hospital del Mar of Barcelona.

Camí is author of more than 150 publications and several monographs related to drug abuse, bibliometrics and science policy, he has directed 15 PhD theses. He is also the author of the “Code of Good Scientific Practices” adopted since 2001 by all scientists belonging to the PRBB centres. He was the editor and founder of the Quark magazine (Science, Medicine, Communication and Culture) (1995-2005). Member of the "Institut d'Estudis Catalans". Among the different prizes received, two stand out: the honourable mention of the Research Award Reina Sofía in 1990 and the Narcís Monturiol medal to scientific and technological merits, awarded by the Catalan Government, in 2000. Among others institutions he served as member of the Health Advisory Council of the Spanish Ministry of Health and member of its Executive Committee from 2005 to 2012, as well as member of the Spanish Bioethics Committee from 2007 to 2012. 

Currently he is driven by promoting scientific projects to better understand cognition, memory and its related diseases. He is interested in the intersection between science and politics, as well as between science and ethics. He like the motto of Dau al Set like creativity, surrealism and the world of magicians and illusionists.

'''Léon Brunschvicg''' ({{IPA-fr|leɔ̃ bʁœ̃svik|lang}}; 10 November 1869 – 18 January 1944) was a [[France|French]] [[Idealism|Idealist]] [[philosopher]]. He co-founded the ''[[Revue de métaphysique et de morale]]'' with [[Xavier Leon]] and [[Élie Halévy]] in 1893.

==Life==
He was born into a [[Jewish]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Zuccotti, ''The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews'', University of Nebraska Press (1999), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Venita Datta, ''Birth of a National Icon: The Literary Avant-Garde and the Origins of the Intellectual in France'', SUNY Press (1999), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1895–1900 he taught at the [[Lycée Pierre Corneille (Rouen)|Lycée Pierre Corneille]] in [[Rouen]].&lt;ref name="LyCo6"&gt;[http://lgcorneille-lyc.spip.ac-rouen.fr/spip.php?article6 Lycée Pierre Corneille de Rouen - History]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897 he completed his [[thesis]] under the title ''{{lang|fr|La Modalité du jugement}}'' (''The Modalities of Judgement''). In 1909 he became professor of philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]].  He was married to [[Cécile Brunschvicg|Cécile Kahn]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bu.univ-angers.fr/EXTRANET/CAF/catalogue/Brunschvicg.html Visages du f&amp;eacute;minisme r&amp;eacute;formiste - C.

Forced to leave his position at the Sorbonne by the Nazis, Brunschvicg fled to the south of France, where he died at the age of 74. While in hiding, he wrote studies of [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], and [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] that were printed in Switzerland. He composed a manual of philosophy dedicated to his teenage granddaughter entitled ''Héritage de Mots, Héritage d'Idées'' (''Legacy of Words, Legacy of Ideas'') which was published posthumously after the liberation of France. His reinterpretation of Descartes has become the foundation for a new [[idealism]].

Brunschvicg defined philosophy as "the mind's methodical self-reflection" and gave a central role to judgement.

The publication of Brunschvicg's oeuvre has been recently completed after unpublished materials held in Russia were returned to his family in 2001.

He was born in [[Saint-Barnabé, Quebec]], in 1938, and is mostly known for his book on the French philosopher [[Albert Camus]] ''Albert Camus, An Analysis of his thought'' (Albert Camus. Analyse de sa pensée).&lt;ref&gt;[http://classiques.uqac.ca/contemporains/melancon_marcel_j/albert_camus_1976/albert_camus_1976.html Marcel J. Mélançon, Albert Camus. Analyse de sa pensée. Suisse: Les Éditions universitaires Fribourg, 1976&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He has mostly worked together with the biologist Richard D. Lambert.

Professor Melançon teaches in the Department of Philosophy in the [[Université du Québec à Chicoutimi]] and he is a researcher in bioethics funded by [[SSHRC]] (''Fonds de la recherche en santé du Québec-FRSQ'') and the "''Programme de soutien des chercheurs de collège''" ([[PSCC]]).

He is also Associate Professor in the Department of Religion and Ethics at the same university where he is co-director of a graduate program in bioethics.

He received a master's degree in experimental medicine with a specialty in genetics from [[Université Laval]] in Québec, and a doctorate in philosophy from the [[University of Fribourg]] in Switzerland.

Professor Melançon has authored more than two books and some articles on ethical issues in genetics, with particular reference to genetic testing and screening. He is currently the Director of an inter-institutional and interdisciplinary group ([[GÉNÉTHIQ]]) in Quebec representing researchers in genetics, ethics, sociology and law, and co-director of the ethics division of the Clinical Ethics Network funded by the FRSQ.

Professor Melançon is a founding member of the [[Canadian Bioethics Society]] where he served as vice-president from 1986 to 1988. He is also a member of various bioethics committees and, also, a member of the [[NCEHR]] Committee on Evaluation.

'''McCarthyism''' is the practice in the United States of making accusations of [[subversion]] or [[treason]] without proper regard for evidence.&lt;ref name="authentichistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cold War Home Front: McCarthyism|url=http://www.authentichistory.com/1946-1960/4-cwhomefront/1-mccarthyism/|website=AuthenticHistory.com|publisher=AuthenticHistory.com|accessdate=21 May 2016|ref=authentichistory}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to U.S. senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] (R-Wisconsin) and has its origins in the period in the United States known as the [[Red Scare#Second Red Scare (1947–57)|Second Red Scare]], lasting from the late 1940s through the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Storrs|first=Landon R.

What would become known as the McCarthy era began before McCarthy's term in 1953. Following the [[First Red Scare]], in 1947 President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] signed an [[executive order]] to screen federal employees for association with organizations deemed "Totalitarian, Fascist, Communist or subversive", or advocating "to alter the form of Government of the United States by unconstitutional means." In 1949 a high-level [[United States Department of State|State Department]] official was convicted of [[perjury]] in a case of espionage, and the Soviet Union tested an [[atomic bomb]]. The [[Korean War]] started the next year, raising tensions in the United States. In a speech in February 1950, Senator McCarthy presented an alleged list of members of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] working in the State Department, which attracted the press' attention. The term "McCarthyism" was published for the first time in a [[political cartoon]] by [[Herblock]] in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that same year. The term has taken on a broader meaning, describing the excesses of similar efforts. In the early 21st century, the term is used more generally to describe reckless, unsubstantiated accusations, as well as [[Demagogy|demagogic]] attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries.

During the McCarthy era, hundreds of Americans were accused of being communists or communist sympathizers; they  became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or [[private industry]] panels, committees and agencies. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, academics and labor union activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence, and the level of threat posed by a person's real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was sometimes exaggerated. Many people suffered loss of employment or destruction of their careers; some were imprisoned. Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts that were later overturned,&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Yates v. United States]]'' (1957) and ''[[Watkins v. United States]]'' (1957): Fried (1997), pp. 205, 207.&lt;/ref&gt; laws that were later declared unconstitutional,&lt;ref&gt;For example, California's "Levering Oath" law, declared unconstitutional in 1967: Fried (1997), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; dismissals for reasons later declared illegal&lt;ref&gt;
For example, ''Slochower v. Board of Education'' (1956): Fried (1997), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Lawsuit|actionable]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Faulk vs. AWARE Inc., et al.'' (1962): Fried (1997), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; or extra-legal procedures, such as informal blacklists, that would come into general disrepute.

The most notable examples of McCarthyism include the so-called investigations conducted by Senator McCarthy, and the hearings conducted by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC).

==Origins==
[[File:Herblock1950.jpg|thumb|[[Herbert Block]] (also known as Herblock) coined the term ''McCarthyism'' in this ''[[Washington Post]]'' cartoon of March 29, 1950.]]

President Harry S. Truman's [[Executive Order 9835]] of March 21, 1947, required that all federal civil service employees be screened for "loyalty." The order said that one basis for determining disloyalty would be a finding of "membership in, affiliation with or sympathetic association" with any organization determined by the attorney general to be "totalitarian, Fascist, Communist or subversive" or advocating or approving the forceful denial of constitutional rights to other persons or seeking "to alter the form of Government of the United States by unconstitutional means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Robert J |first=Goldstein |year=2006 |title=Prelude to McCarthyism: The Making of a Blacklist |magazine=Prologue Magazine |location=Washington, DC |publisher=National Archives and Records Administration |url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2006/fall/agloso.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical period that came to be known as the McCarthy era began well before Joseph McCarthy's own involvement in it. Many factors contributed to McCarthyism, some of them with roots in the First Red Scare (1917–20), inspired by Communism's emergence as a recognized political force and widespread social disruption in the United States related to unionizing and anarchist activities. Thanks in part to its success in organizing labor unions and its early opposition to [[fascism]], and offering an alternative to the ills of capitalism during the [[Great Depression]], the Communist Party of the United States increased its membership through the 1930s, reaching a peak of about 75,000 members in 1940–41.&lt;ref&gt;Weir (2007), pp. 148–49.&lt;/ref&gt; While the United States was engaged in [[World War II]] and allied with the [[Soviet Union]], the issue of anti-communism was largely muted. With the end of World War II, the [[Cold War]] began almost immediately, as the Soviet Union installed Communist [[puppet régime]]s in areas it had occupied across Central and Eastern Europe. The United States backed anti-communist forces in [[Greek Civil War|Greece]] and [[Chinese Civil War|China]].

Although the [[Igor Gouzenko]] and [[Elizabeth Bentley]] affairs had raised the issue of Soviet espionage in 1945, events in 1949 and 1950 sharply increased the sense of threat in the United States related to Communism. The Soviet Union [[Soviet atomic bomb project|tested an atomic bomb]] in 1949, earlier than many analysts had expected, and raising the stakes in the Cold War. That same year, [[Mao Zedong]]'s Communist army gained control of mainland China despite heavy American financial support of the opposing [[Kuomintang]]. Many US policy people did not fully understand the situation in China, despite the efforts of China experts to explain conditions. In 1950, the [[Korean War]] began, pitting U.S., U.N., and South Korean forces against Communists from North Korea and China.

During the following year, there was evidence of increased sophistication in Soviet Cold War espionage activities in the West. In January 1950, [[Alger Hiss]], a high-level State Department official, was convicted of perjury. Hiss was in effect found guilty of espionage; the statute of limitations had run out for that crime, but he was convicted of having perjured himself when he denied that charge in earlier testimony before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. In  Britain, [[Klaus Fuchs]] confessed to committing espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union while working on the [[Manhattan Project]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] during the War. [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] were arrested in 1950 in the United States on charges of stealing atomic bomb secrets for the Soviets and were executed in 1953.

Other forces encouraged the rise of McCarthyism. The more conservative politicians in the United States had historically referred to progressive reforms, such as [[Child labor laws in the United States|child labor laws]] and [[women's suffrage]], as "Communist" or "Red plots", trying to raise fears against such changes.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1990), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; They used similar terms during the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]] when opposing the [[New Deal]] policies of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Many conservatives equated the New Deal with [[socialism]] or Communism, and thought the policies were evidence of too much influence by so-called Communist policy-makers in the Roosevelt administration.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley (1995), p. 141; Fried (1990), pp. 6, 15, 78–80.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the vaguely defined danger of "Communist influence" was a more common theme in the rhetoric of anti-Communist politicians than was espionage or any other specific activity.

[[File:Joseph McCarthy.jpg|thumb|upright|Senator Joseph McCarthy]]
McCarthy's involvement in these issues began publicly with a speech he made on [[Lincoln Day]], February 9, 1950, to the Republican Women's Club of [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]. He brandished a piece of paper, which he claimed contained a list of known Communists working for the State Department. McCarthy is usually quoted as saying: "I have here in my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department."&lt;ref&gt;Griffith (1970), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; This speech resulted in a flood of press attention to McCarthy and helped establish his path to becoming one of the most recognized politicians in the United States.

The first recorded use of the term ''McCarthyism'' was in a [[political cartoon]] by ''[[Washington Post]]'' editorial cartoonist [[Herbert Block]] (aka Herblock), published on March 29, 1950. The cartoon depicted four leading Republicans trying to push an elephant (the traditional symbol of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]) to stand on a platform atop a teetering stack of ten tar buckets, the topmost of which was labeled "McCarthyism". Block later wrote that there was 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"nothing particularly ingenious about the term, which is simply used to represent a national affliction that can hardly be described in any other way. If anyone has a prior claim on it, he's welcome to the word and to the junior senator from Wisconsin along with it. I will also throw in a set of free dishes and a case of soap."&lt;ref&gt;Block (1952), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Institutions==
A number of anti-Communist committees, panels, and "loyalty review boards" in federal, state, and local governments, as well as many private agencies, carried out investigations for small and large companies concerned about possible Communists in their work force.

In Congress, the primary bodies that investigated Communist activities were the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], the [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]], and the [[United States Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]]. Between 1949 and 1954, a total of 109 investigations were carried out by these and other committees of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1990), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 1954, the [[United States Senate]] voted 65 to 22 to condemn McCarthy for "conduct that tends to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute".

In the federal government, President [[Harry Truman]]'s [[Executive Order 9835]] initiated a program of loyalty reviews for federal employees in 1947. It called for dismissal if there were "reasonable grounds&amp;nbsp;... for belief that the person involved is disloyal to the Government of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Constitution of the Truman Presidency and the Post–World War II Era| editor1-first=Martin|editor1-last=Fausold|editor2-first=Alan|editor2-last=Shank | first=Donald R.|last=McCoy| year = 1991| work= The Constitution and the American Presidency| publisher = SUNY Press| page = 116 | isbn = 978-0-7914-0468-3 | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

When President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] took office in 1953, he strengthened and extended Truman's loyalty review program, while decreasing the avenues of appeal available to dismissed employees. [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]], Chairman of the Civil Service Commission [[Loyalty Review Board]], referred to the new rules he was obliged to enforce as "just not the American way of doing things."&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1990), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], scientific director of the [[Manhattan Project]] that built the first atomic bomb, then working as a consultant to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], was stripped of his security clearance after a [[Oppenheimer security hearing|four-week hearing]]. Oppenheimer had received a top-secret clearance in 1947, but was denied clearance in the harsher climate of 1954.

Similar loyalty reviews were established in many state and local government offices and some private industries across the nation. In 1958, it was estimated that roughly one out of every five employees in the United States was required to pass some sort of loyalty review.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1958).&lt;/ref&gt; Once a person lost a job due to an unfavorable loyalty review, it could be very difficult to find other employment. "A man is ruined everywhere and forever," in the words of the chairman of President Truman's Loyalty Review Board. "No responsible employer would be likely to take a chance in giving him a job."&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (1998), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] started keeping a list of organizations that it deemed subversive beginning in 1942. This list was first made public in 1948, when it included 78 items. At its longest, it comprised 154 organizations, 110 of them identified as Communist. In the context of a loyalty review, membership in a listed organization was meant to raise a question, but not to be considered proof of disloyalty. One of the most common causes of suspicion was membership in the [[Washington Bookshop Association]], a left-leaning organization that offered lectures on literature, classical music concerts and discounts on books.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1990), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

====J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI====
[[File:Hoover-JEdgar-LOC.jpg|upright|thumb|[[J. Edgar Hoover]] in 1961]]

FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] designed President Truman's loyalty-security program, and its background investigations of employees were carried out by FBI agents. This was a major assignment that led to the number of agents in the Bureau being increased from 3,559 in 1946 to 7,029 in 1952. Hoover's sense of the Communist threat and the standards of evidence applied by his bureau resulted in thousands of government workers losing their jobs. Due to Hoover's insistence upon keeping the identity of his informers secret, most subjects of loyalty-security reviews were not allowed to cross-examine or know the identities of those who accused them. In many cases they were not even told what they were accused of.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (1998), pp. 211, 266 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoover's influence extended beyond federal government employees and beyond the loyalty-security programs. The records of loyalty review hearings and investigations were supposed to be confidential, but Hoover routinely gave evidence from them to congressional committees such as HUAC.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (2002), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1951 to 1955, the FBI operated a secret "[[Responsibilities Program]]" that distributed anonymous documents with evidence from FBI files of Communist affiliations on the part of teachers, lawyers, and others. Many people accused in these "blind memoranda" were fired without any further process.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (1998), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI engaged in a number of illegal practices in its pursuit of information on Communists, including burglaries, opening mail and illegal wiretaps.&lt;ref name=C312&gt;Cox and Theoharis (1988), p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the left-wing [[National Lawyers Guild]] were among the few attorneys who were willing to defend clients in communist-related cases, and this made the NLG a particular target of Hoover's. The office of this organization was burgled by the FBI at least fourteen times between 1947 and 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (1998), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other purposes, the FBI used its illegally obtained information to alert prosecuting attorneys about the planned legal strategies of NLG defense lawyers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The FBI also used illegal undercover operations to disrupt Communist and other dissident political groups. In 1956, Hoover was becoming increasingly frustrated by [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decisions that limited the Justice Department's ability to prosecute Communists. At this time he formalized a covert "dirty tricks" program under the name [[COINTELPRO]].&lt;ref name=C312/&gt; COINTELPRO actions included planting forged documents to create the suspicion that a key person was an FBI informer, spreading rumors through anonymous letters, leaking information to the press, calling for [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] audits, and the like. The COINTELPRO program remained in operation until 1971.

Historian [[Ellen Schrecker]] calls the [[FBI]] "the single most important component of the anti-communist crusade" and writes: "Had observers known in the 1950s what they have learned since the 1970s, when the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] opened the Bureau's files, 'McCarthyism' would probably be called 'Hooverism'."&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (1998), pp. 239, 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congress===
====House Committee on Un-American Activities====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pete Seeger]] --&gt;
{{main|House Un-American Activities Committee}}
The House Committee on Un-American Activities – commonly referred to as the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) – was the most prominent and active government committee involved in anti-Communist investigations. Formed in 1938 and known as the Dies Committee for [[Martin Dies Jr.|Rep. Martin Dies]], who chaired it until 1944, HUAC investigated a variety of "activities," including those of German-American Nazis during World War II. The Committee soon focused on Communism, beginning with an investigation into Communists in the [[Federal Theatre Project]] in 1938. A significant step for HUAC was its investigation of the charges of espionage brought against [[Alger Hiss]] in 1948. This investigation ultimately resulted in Hiss's trial and conviction for perjury, and convinced many of the usefulness of congressional committees for uncovering Communist subversion.

HUAC achieved its greatest fame and notoriety with its investigation into the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood film industry]]. In [[Hollywood blacklist#The blacklist begins (1947)|October 1947]], the Committee began to subpoena screenwriters, directors, and other movie industry professionals to testify about their known or suspected membership in the Communist Party, association with its members, or support of its beliefs. It was at these testimonies that what became known as "the $64,000 question" was asked: "Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party of the United States?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=8RxLbr0QPdgC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=mccarthyism+64+dollar+question#v=onepage&amp;q=mccarthyism%2064%20dollar%20question&amp;f=false | title=The Performance of Power: Theatrical Discourse and Politics | publisher=[[University of Iowa Press]] | author=Case, Sue-Ellen; Reinelt, Janelle G. (editors) | year=1991 | pages=153 | isbn=9781587290343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first film industry witnesses subpoenaed by the Committee were ten who decided not to cooperate. These men, who became known as the "[[Hollywood Ten]]", cited the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s guarantee of free speech and free assembly, which they believed legally protected them from being required to answer the Committee's questions. This tactic failed, and the ten were sentenced to prison for [[contempt of Congress]]. Two of the ten were sentenced to six months, the rest to a year.

In the future, witnesses (in the entertainment industries and otherwise) who were determined not to cooperate with the Committee would claim their [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] protection against self-incrimination. While this usually protected them from a contempt of Congress citation, it was considered grounds for dismissal by many government and private industry employers. The legal requirements for Fifth Amendment protection were such that a person could not testify about his own association with the Communist Party and then refuse to "name names" of colleagues with Communist affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1990), pp. 154–55; Schrecker (2002), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus many faced a choice between "crawl[ing] through the mud to be an informer," as actor [[Larry Parks]] put it, or becoming known as a "Fifth Amendment Communist"—an epithet often used by Senator McCarthy.&lt;ref name="SIN"&gt;{{cite web| title = See it Now: A Report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (transcript)| publisher = CBS-TV| date = March 9, 1954| url = http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/murrowmccarthy.html| accessdate = 2007-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Senate committees====
In the Senate, the primary committee for investigating Communists was the [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]] (SISS), formed in 1950 and charged with ensuring the enforcement of laws relating to "espionage, sabotage, and the protection of the internal security of the United States." The SISS was headed by Democrat [[Pat McCarran]] and gained a reputation for careful and extensive investigations. This committee spent a year investigating [[Owen Lattimore]] and other members of the [[Institute of Pacific Relations]]. As had been done numerous times before, the collection of scholars and diplomats associated with Lattimore (the so-called [[China Hands]]) were accused of "losing China," and while some evidence of pro-communist attitudes was found, there was nothing to support McCarran's accusation that Lattimore was "a conscious and articulate instrument of the Soviet conspiracy". Lattimore was charged with perjuring himself before the SISS in 1952. After many of the charges were rejected by a Federal Judge and one of the witnesses confessed to perjury, the case was dropped in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1990), pp. 145–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthy headed the [[United States Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] in 1953 and 1954, and during that time used it for a number of his Communist-hunting investigations. McCarthy first examined allegations of Communist influence in the [[Voice of America]], and then turned to the overseas library program of the State Department. [[Card catalogs]] of these libraries were searched for works by authors McCarthy deemed inappropriate. McCarthy then recited the list of supposedly pro-communist authors before his subcommittee and the press. Yielding to the pressure, the State Department ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves "material by any controversial persons, Communists, [[fellow traveler]]s, etc." Some libraries actually burned the newly forbidden books.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith (1970), p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthy's committee then began an investigation into the [[United States Army]]. This began at the [[United States Army Signal Corps|Army Signal Corps]] laboratory at [[Fort Monmouth]]. McCarthy garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the Army researchers, but ultimately nothing came of this investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Stone (2004), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthy next turned his attention to the case of a U.S. Army dentist who had been promoted to the rank of major despite having refused to answer questions on an Army loyalty review form. McCarthy's handling of this investigation, including a series of insults directed at a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], led to the [[Army–McCarthy hearings]], with the Army and McCarthy trading charges and counter-charges for 36 days before a nationwide television audience. While the official outcome of the hearings was inconclusive, this exposure of McCarthy to the American public resulted in a sharp decline in his popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1990), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; In less than a year, McCarthy was censured by the Senate and his position as a prominent force in anti-communism was essentially ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://research.archives.gov/description/1157557 |title=Senate Resolution 301: Censure of Senator Joseph McCarthy |author=[[83rd United States Congress|83rd U.S. Congress]] |date=July 30, 1954 |publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Administration |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blacklists===
On November 25, 1947 (the day after the House of Representatives approved citations of contempt for the [[Hollywood Ten]]), [[Eric Johnston]], President of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], issued a press release on behalf of the heads of the major studios that came to be referred to as the [[Waldorf Statement]]. This statement announced the firing of the Hollywood Ten and stated: "We will not knowingly employ a Communist or a member of any party or group which advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States[...]" This marked the beginning of the [[Hollywood blacklist]]. In spite of the fact that hundreds would be denied employment, the studios, producers and other employers did not publicly admit that a blacklist existed.

At this time, private loyalty-review boards and anti-communist investigators began to appear to fill a growing demand among certain industries to certify that their employees were above reproach. Companies that were concerned about the sensitivity of their business, or who, like the entertainment industry, felt particularly vulnerable to public opinion made use of these private services. For a fee, these teams would investigate employees and question them about their politics and affiliations.

At such hearings, the subject would usually not have a right to the presence of an attorney, and as with HUAC, the interviewee might be asked to defend himself against accusations without being allowed to cross-examine the accuser. These agencies would keep cross-referenced lists of leftist organizations, publications, rallies, charities and the like, as well as lists of individuals who were known or suspected communists. Books such as ''[[Red Channels]]'' and newsletters such as ''Counterattack'' and ''Confidential Information'' were published to keep track of communist and leftist organizations and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1997), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Insofar as the various blacklists of McCarthyism were actual physical lists, they were created and maintained by these private organizations.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}{{explain|date=August 2016}}

===Laws and arrests===
{{see also|Smith Act trials of communist party leaders}}
Efforts to protect the United States from the perceived threat of Communist subversion were particularly enabled by several federal laws. The Alien Registration Act or [[Smith Act]] of 1940 made it a criminal offense for anyone to "knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise or teach the [...] desirability or propriety of overthrowing the Government of the United States or of any State by force or violence, or for anyone to organize any association which teaches, advises or encourages such an overthrow, or for anyone to become a member of or to affiliate with any such association".

Hundreds of Communists and others were prosecuted under this law between 1941 and 1957. Eleven leaders of the Communist Party were convicted under the Smith Act in 1949 in the [[Foley Square trial]]. Ten defendants were given sentences of five years and the eleventh was sentenced to three years. The defense attorneys were cited for [[contempt of court]] and given prison sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1997), pp. 13, 15, 27, 110–12, 165–68.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, twenty-three other leaders of the party were indicted, including [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], a founding member of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. Many were convicted on the basis of testimony that was later admitted to be false.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1997), pp. 201–02.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1957, 140 leaders and members of the Communist Party had been charged under the law, of whom 93 were convicted.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Daniel, "Smith Act", in
{{cite book | author = Paul Finkelman (ed.) | year = 2006 | title = Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties | publisher = CRC Press | page = 1488 | isbn = 0-415-94342-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[McCarran Internal Security Act]], which became law in 1950, has been described by scholar Ellen Schrecker as "the McCarthy era's only important piece of legislation"&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (1998), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; (the Smith Act technically predated McCarthyism). However, the McCarran Act had no real effect beyond legal harassment. It required the registration of Communist organizations with the [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] and established the [[Subversive Activities Control Board]] to investigate possible Communist-action and Communist-front organizations so they could be required to register. Due to numerous hearings, delays and appeals, the act was never enforced, even with regard to the Communist Party of the United States itself, and the major provisions of the act were found to be unconstitutional in 1965 and 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1990), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|Immigration and Nationality, or McCarran–Walter, Act]] was passed. This law allowed the government to deport immigrants or naturalized citizens engaged in subversive activities and also to bar suspected subversives from entering the country.

The [[Communist Control Act of 1954]] was passed with overwhelming support in both houses of Congress after very little debate. Jointly drafted by Republican [[John Marshall Butler]] and Democrat [[Hubert Humphrey]], the law was an extension of the Internal Security Act of 1950, and sought to outlaw the Communist Party by declaring that the party, as well as "Communist-Infiltrated Organizations" were "not entitled to any of the rights, privileges, and immunities attendant upon legal bodies." While the Communist Control Act had an odd mix of liberals and conservatives among its supporters, it never had any significant effect.

The Act was successfully applied only twice: in 1954 it was used to prevent Communist Party members from appearing on the New Jersey state ballot, and in 1960 it was cited to deny the CPUSA recognition as an employer under New York State's unemployment compensation system. The ''[[New York Post]]'' called the act "a monstrosity", "a wretched repudiation of democratic principles," while ''[[The Nation]]'' accused Democratic liberals of a "neurotic, election-year anxiety to escape the charge of being 'soft on Communism' even at the expense of sacrificing constitutional rights."&lt;ref&gt;McAuliff (1978), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Repression in the individual States ===
In addition to the Federal laws and responding to the worries of the local opinion, several [[U.S. state|states]] enacted anti-Communist statutes.

By 1952, several states had enacted statutes against [[criminal anarchy]], [[criminal syndicalism]] and sedition, banned from public employment or even from receiving public aid Communists and "subversives," asked for loyalty oaths from public servants, and severily restricted or even banned the Communist party; in addition, six states, among them [[California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://todayinclh.com/?event=california-creates-un-american-activities-committee|title=California Creates Un-American Activities Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=Today in Civil Liberties History|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities]]) had equivalents to the HUAC.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ta2kvLpA3BoC&amp;pg=PA107|title=Freedom Under Fire: U.S. Civil Liberties in Times of War|last=Linfield|first=Michael|date=1990|publisher=South End Press|isbn=9780896083745|location=|page=|pages=107–11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these states had very severe, or even extreme, laws against Communism. In 1950, [[Michigan]] enacted life imprisonment for subversive propaganda; the following year, [[Tennessee]] enacted [[death penalty]] for advocating the violent overthrow of the government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Death penalty for membership of the Communist party was discussed in [[Texas]] by Governor [[Allan Shivers]], who described it as "worse than murder."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.texasobserver.org/so-long-to-the-communist-threat/|title=So Long to the Communist Threat|last=Richards|first=Dave|date=2009-08-19|work=The Texas Observer|access-date=2017-07-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nc4mlgcCRa4C&amp;pg=PA87|title=Deep in the Heart: The Texas Tendency in American Politics|last=McEnteer|first=James|date=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780275983062|location=|page=87|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Municipalities and counties also enacted anti-Communist ordinances: [[Los Angeles]] banned any Communist or "Muscovite model of police-state dictatorship" from owning any arm and [[Birmingham, Alabama]] and [[Jacksonville, Florida]] banned any Communist from being within the city's limits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Popular support==
[[File:Unholy three.png|thumb|Flier issued in May 1955 by the Keep America Committee urging readers to "fight communistic world government" by opposing public health programs]]

McCarthyism was supported by a variety of groups, including the [[American Legion]] and various other anti-communist organizations. One core element of support was a variety of militantly anti-communist women's groups such as the [[American Public Relations Forum]] and the [[Minute Women of the U.S.A.]]. These organized tens of thousands of housewives into study groups, letter-writing networks, and patriotic clubs that coordinated efforts to identify and eradicate what they saw as subversion.&lt;ref&gt;Nickerson, Michelle M., "[http://www.oah.org/pubs/magazine/conservatism/nickerson.html Women, Domesticity, and Postwar Conservatism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030310181508/http://www.oah.org/pubs/magazine/conservatism/nickerson.html |date=March 10, 2003 }}", ''OAH Magazine of History'' 17 (January 2003). {{ISSN|0882-228X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although far-right radicals were the bedrock of support for McCarthyism, they were not alone. A broad "coalition of the aggrieved" found McCarthyism attractive, or at least politically useful. Common themes uniting the coalition were opposition to internationalism, particularly the [[United Nations]]; opposition to [[social welfare provision]]s, particularly the various programs established by the [[New Deal]]; and opposition to efforts to reduce inequalities in the [[social structure of the United States]].&lt;ref name=R21&gt;Rovere (1959), pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

One focus of popular McCarthyism concerned the provision of [[public health]] services, particularly [[vaccination]], [[mental health]] care services and [[fluoridation]], all of which were denounced by some to be communist plots to poison or brainwash the American people.  Such viewpoints led to collisions between McCarthyite radicals and supporters of public health programs, most notably in the case of the [[Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act|Alaska Mental Health Bill]] controversy of 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Marmor, Judd, Viola W. Bernard, and Perry Ottenberg, "Psychodynamics of Group Opposition to Mental Health Programs", in {{cite book | author= Judd Marmor | title=Psychiatry in Transition | publisher=Transaction | year=1994 | edition=2nd | pages = 355–73 | isbn = 1-56000-736-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William F. Buckley Jr.]], the founder of the influential conservative political magazine ''[[National Review]]'', wrote a defense of McCarthy, ''McCarthy and his Enemies'', in which he asserted that "McCarthyism ... is a movement around which men of good will and stern morality can close ranks."&lt;ref&gt;Buckley (1954), p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, as Richard Rovere points out, many ordinary Americans became convinced that there must be "no smoke without fire" and lent their support to McCarthyism. The [[Gallup poll]] found that at his peak in January 1954 50% of the American public supported McCarthy, while 29% had an unfavorable opinion.  His support fell to 34% in June 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Griffith|title=The Politics of Fear: Joseph R.

(McCarthy himself was a Catholic.) He had very little support among union activists and Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Herman|title=Joseph McCarthy: Reexamining the Life and Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIibZoDyADEC&amp;pg=PA160|year=2000|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=160–61|isbn=9780684836256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayals of Communists==
Those who sought to justify McCarthyism did so largely through their characterization of Communism, and American Communists in particular. Proponents of McCarthyism claimed that the [[Communist Party USA|CPUSA]] was so completely under Moscow's control that any American Communist was a puppet of the Soviet and Russian intelligence services. This view is supported by recent documentation from the archives of the [[KGB]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Andrew  | first = Christopher  |author2=Vasili Mitrokhin  | title = The Sword and the Shield  | publisher = Basic Books  | year = 1999  | location = New York  | pages = 108, 110, 122, 148, 164, 226, 236–37, 279–80, 294–306 | isbn = 0-465-00310-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as post-war decodes of wartime Soviet radio traffic from the [[Venona Project]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Haynes  | first = John  |author2=Harvey Klehr  | title = Venona – Decoding Soviet Espionage in America  | publisher = Yale University  | year = 1999  | location = Connecticut  | pages = 221–26 | isbn = 0-300-07771-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  showing that Moscow provided financial support to the CPUSA and had significant influence on CPUSA policies. J. Edgar Hoover commented in a 1950 speech, "Communist members, body and soul, are the property of the Party."

This attitude was not confined to arch-conservatives. In 1940, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] ejected founding member [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], saying that her membership in the Communist Party was enough to disqualify her as a civil libertarian. In the government's prosecutions of Communist Party members under the Smith Act (see above), the prosecution case was based not on specific actions or statements by the defendants, but on the premise that a commitment to violent overthrow of the government was inherent in the doctrines of Marxism–Leninism. Passages of the CPUSA's constitution that specifically rejected revolutionary violence were dismissed as deliberate deception.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (1998), pp. 161, 193–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, it was often claimed that the Party did not allow any member to resign, so a person who had been a member for a short time decades previously could be considered as suspect as a current member. Many of the hearings and trials of McCarthyism featured testimony by former Communist Party members such as [[Elizabeth Bentley]], [[Louis F. Budenz|Louis Budenz]], and [[Whittaker Chambers]], speaking as expert witnesses.&lt;ref name=Witness&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Chambers  | first = Whittaker | authorlink = Whittaker Chambers  | title = Witness  | publisher = Random House  | year = 1952  | location = New York  | page = 799 | isbn = 978-0-8488-0958-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (1998), pp. 130–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims of McCarthy==

It is difficult to estimate the number of victims of McCarthy. The number imprisoned is in the hundreds, and some ten or twelve thousand lost their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (1998), p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases simply being subpoenaed by HUAC or one of the other committees was sufficient cause to be fired.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (2002), pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those who were imprisoned, lost their jobs, or were questioned by committees did in fact have a past or present connection of some kind with the Communist Party.

But for the vast majority, both the potential for them to do harm to the nation and the nature of their communist affiliation were tenuous.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (1998), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; After the extremely damaging "[[Cambridge Spy Ring|Cambridge Five]]" spy scandal ([[Guy Burgess]], [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]], [[Kim Philby]], [[Anthony Blunt]], et al.), suspected [[homosexuality]] was also a common cause for being targeted by McCarthyism. The hunt for "sexual perverts", who were presumed to be subversive by nature, resulted in over 5,000 federal workers being fired, and thousands were harassed and denied employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sears|first1=Brad|last2=Hunter|first2=Nan D.|last3=Mallory|first3=Christy|title=Documenting Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in State Employment|date=September 2009|publisher=The Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy at UCLA School of Law|location=Los Angeles|pages=5–3|url=https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/5_History.pdf#page=3|quote=From 1947 to 1961, more than 5,000 allegedly homosexual federal civil servants lost their jobs in the purges for no reason other than sexual orientation, and thousands of applicants were also rejected for federal employment for the same reason. During this period, more than 1,000 men and women were fired for suspected homosexuality from the State Department alone—a far greater number than were dismissed for their membership in the Communist party. The Cold War and anti-communist efforts provided the setting in which a sustained attack upon gay men and lesbians took place. The history of this 'Lavender Scare' by the federal government has been extensively documented by historian David Johnson. Johnson has demonstrated that during this era government officials intentionally engaged in campaigns to associate homosexuality with Communism: 'homosexual' and 'pervert' became synonyms for 'Communist' and 'traitor.' LGBT people were treated as a national security threat, demanding the attention of Congress, the courts, statehouses, and the media.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio (1998), pp. 41–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Many have termed this aspect of McCarthyism the "[[Lavender scare]]".&lt;ref&gt;David K. Johnson, ''The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government''. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009.), pg 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An interview with David K.

In popular discourse, communists and homosexuals were often conflated. Both groups were perceived as hidden subcultures with their own meeting places, literature, cultural codes, and bonds of loyalty. Both groups were thought to recruit to their ranks the psychologically weak or disturbed. And both groups were considered immoral and godless. Many people believed that the two groups were working together to undermine the government.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homosexuality was classified as a psychiatric disorder in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Patrizia Gentile 2010. pg 65"&gt;Gary Kinsman and Patrizia Gentile. ''The Canadian War on Queers: National Security as Sexual Regulation''. Vancouver: UBC Press, 2010, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the context of the highly politicised Cold War environment, homosexuality became framed as a dangerous, contagious social disease that posed a potential threat to state security.&lt;ref name="Patrizia Gentile 2010. pg 65"/&gt; As the family was believed to be the cornerstone of American strength and integrity,&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedy and Madeline Davis. ''Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold''. New York: Routledge, 1993, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; the description of homosexuals as "sexual perverts" meant that they were both unable to function within a family unit and presented the potential to poison the social body.&lt;ref name="Patrizia Gentile 2010. pg 8"&gt;Kinsman and Gentile, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This era also witnessed the establishment of widely spread FBI surveillance intended to identify homosexual government employees.&lt;ref&gt;John D'Emilio and Estelle B. Freedman. ''Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America'', 3rd ed. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

The McCarthy hearings and according "sexual pervert" investigations can be seen to have been driven by a desire to identify individuals whose ability to function as loyal citizens had been compromised.&lt;ref name="Patrizia Gentile 2010. pg 8"/&gt; McCarthy began his campaign by drawing upon the ways in which he embodied traditional American values in order to become the self-appointed vanguard of social morality.&lt;ref&gt;David K. Johnson, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations of alleged homosexual behavior marked the end of McCarthy's political career.&lt;ref&gt;David K. Johnson, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Cinema of the United States|film industry]], more than 300 actors, authors and directors were denied work in the U.S. through the unofficial [[Hollywood blacklist]]. Blacklists were at work throughout the entertainment industry, in universities and schools at all levels, in the legal profession, and in many other fields. A port security program initiated by the Coast Guard shortly after the start of the [[Korean War]] required a review of every maritime worker who loaded or worked aboard any American ship, regardless of cargo or destination. As with other loyalty-security reviews of McCarthyism, the identities of any accusers and even the nature of any accusations were typically kept secret from the accused. Nearly 3,000 seamen and longshoremen lost their jobs due to this program alone.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (1998), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the notable people who were blacklisted or suffered some other persecution during McCarthyism are listed here:

In 1953, Robert K. Murray, a young professor of history at Pennsylvania State University who had served as an intelligence officer in World War II, was revising his dissertation on the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare of 1919–20]] for publication until [[Little, Brown and Company]] decided that "under the circumstances ... it wasn't wise for them to bring this book out." He learned that investigators were questioning his colleagues and relatives. The University of Minnesota press published his volume, ''Red Scare: A Study in National Hysteria, 1919–1920'', in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Organization of American Historians: [http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2003nov/murray.html Lee W. Formwalt, "Robert Murray's Two Red Scares," in OAH Newsletter, November 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904174256/http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2003nov/murray.html |date=September 4, 2013 }}, accessed January 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reactions==
The nation was by no means united behind the policies and activities that have come to be associated with McCarthyism. There were many critics of various aspects of McCarthyism, including many figures not generally noted for their liberalism.

For example, in his overridden [[veto]] of the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] of 1950, President Truman wrote, "In a free country, we punish men for the crimes they commit, but never for the opinions they have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Truman, Harry S.|date=September 1950| url=http://trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=883| title=Veto of the Internal Security Bill| accessdate=2006-08-07| publisher=Truman Presidential Museum and Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truman also unsuccessfully vetoed the [[Taft–Hartley Act]], which among other provisions denied [[trade union]]s [[National Labor Relations Board]] protection unless union leaders signed [[affidavit]]s swearing they were not and had never been Communists. In 1953, after he left office, Truman criticized the current Eisenhower administration:

{{quote|It is now evident that the present Administration has fully embraced, for political advantage, McCarthyism. I am not referring to the Senator from Wisconsin. He is only important in that his name has taken on the dictionary meaning of the word. It is the corruption of truth, the abandonment of the due process law. It is the use of the big lie and the unfounded accusation against any citizen in the name of Americanism or security. It is the rise to power of the demagogue who lives on untruth; it is the spreading of fear and the destruction of faith in every level of society.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty (2005), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On June 1, 1950, Senator [[Margaret Chase Smith]], a Maine Republican, delivered a speech to the Senate she called a "[[Declaration of Conscience]]". In a clear attack upon McCarthyism, she called for an end to "character assassinations" and named "some of the basic principles of Americanism: The right to criticize; The right to hold unpopular beliefs; The right to protest; The right of independent thought". She said "freedom of speech is not what it used to be in America", and decried "cancerous tentacles of 'know nothing, suspect everything' attitudes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Smith, Margaret Chase |date=June 1, 1950 |url=http://www.mcslibrary.org/program/library/declaration.htm |title=Declaration of Conscience |accessdate=2006-08-04 |publisher=Margaret Chase Smith Library |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008025315/http://www.mcslibrary.org/program/library/declaration.htm |archivedate=October 8, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Six other Republican senators—[[Wayne Morse]], [[Irving Ives|Irving M. Ives]], [[Charles W. Tobey]], [[Edward John Thye]], [[George Aiken]], and [[Robert C. Hendrickson]]—joined Smith in condemning the tactics of McCarthyism.
[[File:Welch-McCarthy-Hearings.jpg|right|thumb| [[Joseph N. Welch]] (left) and Senator McCarthy, June 9, 1954]]

[[Elmer Davis]], one of the most highly respected news reporters and commentators of the 1940s and 1950s, often spoke out against what he saw as the excesses of McCarthyism. On one occasion he warned that many local anti-Communist movements constituted a "general attack not only on schools and colleges and libraries, on teachers and textbooks, but on all people who think and write [...] in short, on the freedom of the mind".&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1990), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision in ''[[Adler v. Board of Education of New York]]'', thus approving a law that allowed state loyalty review boards to fire teachers deemed "subversive". In his dissenting opinion, Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote: "The present law proceeds on a principle repugnant to our society—guilt by association.[...] What happens under this law is typical of what happens in a police state. Teachers are under constant surveillance; their pasts are combed for signs of disloyalty; their utterances are watched for clues to dangerous thoughts."&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1997), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward r murrow challenge of ideas screenshot 2.jpg|thumb|Broadcast journalist [[Edward R. Murrow]]]]
One of the most influential opponents of McCarthyism was the famed CBS newscaster and analyst [[Edward R. Murrow]]. On October 20, 1953, Murrow's show ''[[See It Now]]'' aired an episode about the dismissal of [[Milo Radulovich]], a former reserve Air Force lieutenant who was accused of associating with Communists. The show was strongly critical of the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]]'s methods, which included presenting evidence in a sealed envelope that Radulovich and his attorney were not allowed to open.

On March 9, 1954, ''See It Now'' aired another episode on the issue of McCarthyism, this one attacking Joseph McCarthy himself. Titled "A Report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy", it used footage of McCarthy speeches to portray him as dishonest, reckless and abusive toward witnesses and prominent Americans. In his concluding comment, Murrow said:

{{quote|We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men.&lt;ref name=SIN/&gt;}}

This broadcast has been cited as a key episode in bringing about the end of McCarthyism.&lt;ref&gt;Streitmatter (1998), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1954, McCarthy was also under attack in the [[Army–McCarthy hearings]]. These hearings were televised live on the new [[American Broadcasting Company]] network, allowing the public to view first-hand McCarthy's interrogation of individuals and his controversial tactics. In one exchange, McCarthy reminded the attorney for the Army, [[Joseph N. Welch|Joseph Welch]], that he had an employee in his law firm who had belonged to an organization that had been accused of Communist sympathies. In an exchange that reflected the increasingly negative public opinion of McCarthy, Welch rebuked the senator: "Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?"&lt;ref&gt;Doherty (2005), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
In the mid- and late 1950s, the attitudes and institutions of McCarthyism slowly weakened. Changing public sentiments heavily contributed to the decline of McCarthyism. Its decline may also be charted through a series of court decisions.

A key figure in the end of the blacklisting of McCarthyism was [[John Henry Faulk]]. Host of an afternoon comedy radio show, Faulk was a leftist active in his union, the [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]]. He was scrutinized by AWARE, Inc., one of the private firms that examined individuals for signs of communist "disloyalty". Marked by AWARE as unfit, he was fired by [[CBS Radio]]. Almost uniquely among the many victims of blacklisting, Faulk decided to sue AWARE in 1957 and finally won the case in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | author = Faulk, John Henry  | title = Fear on Trial  | publisher = University of Texas Press  | year = 1963  | isbn = 0-292-72442-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this court decision, the private blacklisters and those who used them were put on notice that they were [[Legal liability|legally liable]] for the professional and financial damage they caused. Although some informal blacklisting continued, the private "loyalty checking" agencies were soon a thing of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1997), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the Faulk verdict, many in Hollywood had decided it was time to break the blacklist. In 1960, [[Dalton Trumbo]], one of the best known members of the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]], was publicly credited with writing the films ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]'' and ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''.

Much of the undoing of McCarthyism came at the hands of the Supreme Court. As [[Richard Rovere]] wrote in his biography of Joseph McCarthy, "[T]he United States Supreme Court took judicial notice of the rents McCarthy was making in the fabric of liberty and thereupon wrote a series of decisions that have made the fabric stronger than before."&lt;ref&gt;Rovere (1959), p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; Two Eisenhower appointees to the court—[[Earl Warren]] (who was made Chief Justice) and [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]]—proved to be more liberal than Eisenhower had anticipated, and he would later refer to the appointment of Warren as his "biggest mistake".&lt;ref&gt;Sabin (1999), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the Supreme Court heard the case of ''[[Slochower v. Board of Education]]''. Harry Slochower was a professor at Brooklyn College who had been fired by New York City for invoking the Fifth Amendment when McCarthy's committee questioned him about his past membership in the Communist Party. The court prohibited such actions, ruling "...we must condemn the practice of imputing a sinister meaning to the exercise of a person's constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment.[...] The privilege against self-incrimination would be reduced to a hollow mockery if its exercise could be taken as equivalent either to a confession of guilt or a conclusive presumption of perjury."&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1997), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1956 ''Cole v. Young'' ruling also greatly weakened the ability to discriminate in the federal civilian workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/351/536/|title=Cole v. Young 351 U.S. 536 (1956)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key decision was in the 1957 case ''[[Yates v. United States]]'', in which the convictions of fourteen Communists were reversed. In Justice Black's opinion, he wrote of the original "Smith Act" trials: "The testimony of witnesses is comparatively insignificant. Guilt or innocence may turn on what Marx or Engels or someone else wrote or advocated as much as a hundred years or more ago.[...] When the propriety of obnoxious or unfamiliar view about government is in reality made the crucial issue, [...] prejudice makes conviction inevitable except in the rarest circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1997), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1957, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of ''[[Watkins v. United States]]'', curtailing the power of HUAC to punish uncooperative witnesses by finding them in contempt of Congress. Justice Warren wrote in the decision: "The mere summoning of a witness and compelling him to testify, against his will, about his beliefs, expressions or associations is a measure of governmental interference. And when those forced revelations concern matters that are unorthodox, unpopular, or even hateful to the general public, the reaction in the life of the witness may be disastrous."&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1997), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/354/178.html full text] (http://caselaw.findlaw.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 1958 decision in ''[[Kent v. Dulles]]'', the Supreme Court halted the [[State Department]] from using the authority of its own regulations to refuse or revoke passports based on an applicant's communist beliefs or associations.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1997), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repercussions==
The political divisions McCarthyism created in the United States continue to make themselves manifest, and the politics and history of anti-Communism in the United States are still contentious. Portions of the massive security apparatus established during the McCarthy era still exist. [[Loyalty oath]]s are still required by the [[California Constitution]] for all officials and employees of the [[government of California]] (which is highly problematic for [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Jehovah's Witness]]es whose beliefs preclude them from pledging absolute loyalty to the state).&lt;ref&gt;Paddock, Richard C. (May 11, 2008), [http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-05-11/news/17152368_1_loyalty-oath-wendy-gonaver-speech-and-religious-freedom "Loyalty oath poses ethical dilemmas"], ''San Francisco Chronicle''&lt;/ref&gt; At the federal level, a few portions of the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] remain in effect.

A number of observers have compared the oppression of liberals and leftists during the McCarthy period to recent actions against suspected terrorists, most of them Muslims. In ''The Age of Anxiety: McCarthyism to Terrorism'', author Haynes Johnson compares the "abuses suffered by aliens thrown into high security U.S. prisons in the wake of 9/11" to the excesses of the McCarthy era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Johnson, Haynes | title = The Age of Anxiety: McCarthyism to Terrorism | publisher =Harcourt | year =2005 | page = 471 | isbn = 0-15-101062-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, [[David D. Cole]] has written that the [[USA PATRIOT Act|Patriot Act]] "in effect resurrects the philosophy of McCarthyism, simply substituting 'terrorist' for 'communist.'"&lt;ref&gt;Cole, David, "[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20011217/cole National Security State]", ''The Nation'' (December 17, 2001). See also Cole, David, "The New McCarthyism: Repeating History in the War on Terrorism", ''Harvard Civil Rights–Civil Liberties Law Review'' 38, no. 1 (Winter 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

From the opposite pole, conservative writer [[Ann Coulter]] devotes much of her book ''[[Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism|Treason]]'' to drawing parallels between past opposition to McCarthy and McCarthyism and the policies and beliefs of modern-day liberals, arguing that the former hindered the anti-Communist cause and the latter hinder the [[War on Terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Coulter, Ann | title = Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism | publisher = Three Rivers Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-4000-5032-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other authors who have drawn on a comparison between current [[Anti-terrorism legislation#United States|anti-terrorism policies]] and McCarthyism include [[Geoffrey R. Stone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =  Geoffrey R. Stone | title =America's new McCarthyism | newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=October 17, 2004 | url =http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-10-17/news/0410170323_1_democratic-dominance-mccarthyism-partisan | accessdate = January 3, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ted Morgan (writer)|Ted Morgan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Morgan, Ted | title = Reds: McCarthyism in Twentieth-Century America | publisher =Random House | year =2004 | page = 597 et seq.| isbn = 0-8129-7302-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Jonah Goldberg]].&lt;ref name=Goldberg&gt;{{cite web|author=Goldberg, Jonah| title =  Two Cheers for "McCarthyism"?| publisher = National Review Online| date = February 26, 2003| url = http://www.nationalreview.com/goldberg/goldberg022603.asp| accessdate = 2007-01-25| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061210062004/http://www.nationalreview.com/goldberg/goldberg022603.asp &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;| archivedate = 2006-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthyism also attracts controversy purely as a historical issue. Through declassified documents from Soviet archives and [[Venona project]] decryptions of coded Soviet messages, it has become known that the Soviet Union engaged in substantial espionage activities in the United States during the 1940s.  It is also known that the [[Communist Party USA]] was substantially funded and its policies controlled by the Soviet Union, and there are accusations that CPUSA members were often recruited as spies.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Joshua, [http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=exhuming_mccarthy "Exhuming McCarthy"], ''American Prospect'' 10, no. 43 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of some contemporary commentators, these revelations stand as at least a partial vindication of McCarthyism.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Aaronovitch]] [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00t7hhf McCarthy: There Were Reds Under the Bed] ''[[BBC Radio 4]]'' airdate 9 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Some feel that there was a genuinely dangerous subversive element in the United States, and that this danger justified extreme measures.&lt;ref name="Goldberg" /&gt; Others, while acknowledging that there were inexcusable excesses during McCarthyism, argue that some contemporary historians of McCarthyism underplay the depth of Soviet espionage in America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Radosh, Ronald| title = The Persistence Of Anti-Anti-Communism| publisher = FrontPageMagazine.com| date = July 11, 2001| url = http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=1491| archive-url = https://archive.is/20120730190931/http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=1491| dead-url = yes| archive-date = July 30, 2012| accessdate = 2009-02-27| authorlink = Ronald Radosh}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the undemocratic nature of the CPUSA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Haynes  | first = John Earl  | authorlink = John Earl Haynes  | title = Reflections on Ellen Schrecker and Maurice Isserman's essay, "The Right's Cold War Revision"  | url =http://www.johnearlhaynes.org/page47.html  | postscript = &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter concern being shared by some [[Trotskyites]] who felt that they, and anti-Stalin socialists in general, were persecuted by the CPUSA.&lt;ref name="Trotskyites"&gt;Shannon Jones [http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/mar1999/crim-m24.shtml Account of McCarthy period slanders socialist opponents of Stalinism] [[International Committee of the Fourth International]] 24 March 1999&lt;br /&gt;''Any serious assessment of McCarthyism must consider fore and center the criminal role played by the Stalinist Communist Party, which, by associating socialism with terrible crimes against the working class, helped create the political climate in which red-baiting could flourish.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposing view holds that, recent revelations notwithstanding, by the time McCarthyism began in the late 1940s, the CPUSA was an ineffectual fringe group, and the damage done to U.S. interests by Soviet spies after World War II was minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | author= Theoharis, Athan  | title = Chasing Spies: How the FBI Failed in Counter-Intelligence But Promoted the Politics of McCarthyism in the Cold War Years  | publisher = Ivan R.

===Later use of the term===
Since the time of McCarthy, the word ''McCarthyism'' has entered American speech as a general term for a variety of practices: aggressively questioning a person's patriotism, making poorly supported accusations, using accusations of disloyalty to pressure a person to adhere to conformist politics or to discredit an opponent, subverting [[civil and political rights]] in the name of national security, and the use of [[demagoguery]] are all often referred to as ''McCarthyism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenthal |first=Jack |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/07/books/president-vs-demagogue.html |title=President vs. Demagogue |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 7, 1984 |accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boot |first=Max |url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/joseph-mccarthy-by-arthur-herman-9160 |title=Joseph McCarthy by Arthur Herman |journal=Commentary |date=April 2000 |accessdate=April 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721122049/http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/joseph-mccarthy-by-arthur-herman-9160 |archivedate=July 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/articles/7603.html|author=What Qualifies as Demagoguery? |title=What Qualifies as Demagoguery? |publisher=History News Network |date=October 19, 2004 |accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCarthyism can also be synonymous with the term [[Witch-hunt#Figurative usage|witch-hunt]], both referring to [[mass hysteria]] and [[moral panic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=VCE_7C6YnboC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=mccarthyism+witch+hunt&amp;ots=BbbFAM9HBl&amp;sig=WVxwtebf5EfwG_Z34sknZHXo5FY#v=onepage&amp;q=mccarthyism%20witch%20hunt&amp;f=false|title=Congressional Theatre: Dramatizing McCarthyism on Stage, Film, and Television|last=Murphy|first=Brenda|date=2003-11-13|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521891660|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The 1951 novel ''[[The Troubled Air]]'' by [[Irwin Shaw]] tells the story of the director of a (fictional) radio show, broadcast live at the time, who is given a deadline to investigate his cast for alleged links to communism. The novel recounts the devastating effects on all concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openroadmedia.com/ebook/the-troubled-air/|title=The Troubled Air|publisher=Open Road Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1952 [[Arthur Miller]] play ''[[The Crucible]]'' used the [[Salem witch trials]] as a metaphor for McCarthyism, suggesting that the process of McCarthyism-style persecution can occur at any time or place. The play focused on the fact that once accused, a person had little chance of exoneration, given the irrational and circular reasoning of both the courts and the public. Miller later wrote: "The more I read into the Salem panic, the more it touched off corresponding images of common experiences in the fifties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Arthur |date=October 21, 1996 |url= http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1996/10/21/1996_10_21_158_TNY_CARDS_000373902 |title=Why I Wrote The Crucible |publisher=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1976 film ''[[The Front]]'' starring [[Woody Allen]] dealt with the McCarthy-era [[Hollywood blacklist]]. The film was made by those blacklisted, producer and director [[Martin Ritt]], written by [[Walter Bernstein]], with actors [[Zero Mostel]], [[Herschel Bernardi]], [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]], [[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]], [[Lloyd Gough]], and [[Joshua Shelley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/mccarthy/blacklist.html|title="The Hollywood Blacklist"|last=Georgakas|first=Dan|website=www.english.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 film ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'' by [[George Clooney]] starred [[David Strathairn]] as broadcast journalist [[Edward R. Murrow]] and contained archival footage of McCarthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4949041|title='Good Night and Good Luck': Murrow vs. McCarthy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Guilty by Suspicion]]'' is a 1991 American drama film about the Hollywood blacklist, McCarthyism, and the activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Written and directed by Irwin Winkler, it starred [[Robert De Niro]], [[Annette Bening]], and [[George Wendt]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14577">'''Moral realism''' (also '''ethical realism''' or '''moral Platonism''')&lt;ref&gt;Russ Shafer-Landau (ed.), ''Oxford Studies in Metaethics, Volume 10'', Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; is the position that [[ethical]] [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s express [[proposition]]s that refer to objective features of the world (that is, features independent of subjective opinion), some of which may be true to the extent that they report those features accurately. This makes moral realism a non-[[moral nihilism|nihilist]] form of [[Cognitivism (ethics)|ethical cognitivism]] (which accepts that ethical sentences express propositions and can therefore be evaluated as true or false) with an [[ontological]] orientation, standing in opposition to all forms of moral [[anti-realism]] and [[moral skepticism]], including [[ethical subjectivism]] (which denies that moral propositions refer to objective facts), [[error theory]] (which denies that any moral propositions are true); and [[non-cognitivism]] (which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all). Within moral realism, the two main subdivisions are [[ethical naturalism]] and [[ethical non-naturalism]].

Many philosophers claim that moral realism may be dated back at least to Plato as a philosophical doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;''Plato's Moral Realism: The Discovery of the Presuppositions of Ethics'', by John M. Rist (Jul 15, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;
and that it is a fully defensible form of moral doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''Moral Realism as a Moral Doctrine'', (New Directions in Ethics), by Matthew H. Kramer&lt;/ref&gt; A survey from 2009 involving 3,226 respondents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The PhilPapers Surveys|url=https://philpapers.org/surveys/index.html|website=philpapers.org|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 56% of philosophers accept or lean towards moral realism (28%: anti-realism; 16%: other).&lt;ref&gt;[https://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl?affil=Target+faculty&amp;areas0=0&amp;areas_max=1&amp;grain=coarse PhilPapers survey, 2009], under the heading 'Meta-ethics'&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable examples of robust moral realists include David Brink,&lt;ref name=Brink&gt;Brink, David O., Moral Realism and the Foundations of Ethics (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McDowell]], [[Peter Railton]],&lt;ref name=Railton&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Railton | first1 = Peter | year = 1986 | title = Moral Realism | url = | journal = Philosophical Review | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 163–207 | doi=10.2307/2185589}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Sayre-McCord]],&lt;ref name=McCord&gt;Sayre-McCord, Geoff (2005).

Robinson (Jul 29, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robust versus minimal moral realism==
A delineation of moral realism into a minimal form, a moderate form, and robust form has been put forward in the literature.&lt;ref name=Sturgeon/&gt;

The robust model of moral realism commits moral realists to three theses:&lt;ref name="Väyrynen"&gt;Väyrynen, Pekka (2005). "Moral Realism", ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2nd Edition'', Donald M. Borchert (ed.). ([http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/pekkav/research/moralrealism.pdf link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512150623/http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/pekkav/research/moralrealism.pdf |date=2008-05-12 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''The semantic thesis:'' The primary semantic role of moral predicates (such as "right" and "wrong") is to refer to moral properties (such as rightness and wrongness), so that moral statements (such as "honesty is good" and "slavery is unjust") purport to represent moral facts, and express propositions that are true or false (or approximately true, largely false, and so on).
* ''The alethic thesis:'' Some moral propositions are in fact true.
* ''The metaphysical thesis:'' Moral propositions are true when actions and other objects of moral assessment have the relevant moral properties (so that the relevant moral facts obtain), where these facts and properties are robust: their metaphysical status, whatever it is, is not relevantly different from that of (certain types of) ordinary non-moral facts and properties.

The minimal model, i.e. [[moral universalism]], leaves off the metaphysical thesis, treating it as matter of contention ''among'' moral realists (as opposed to ''between'' moral realists and moral anti-realists). This dispute is not insignificant, as acceptance or rejection of the metaphysical thesis is taken by those employing the robust model as the key difference between moral realism and moral anti-realism. Indeed, the question of how to classify certain [[Logical possibility|logically possible]] (if eccentric) views&amp;mdash;such as the rejection of the semantic and alethic theses in conjunction with the acceptance of the metaphysical thesis&amp;mdash;turns on which model we accept.&lt;ref name=Joyce&gt;Joyce, Richard (2007), "Moral Anti-Realism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2007 Edition)'', [[Edward N. Zalta]] (ed.). ([http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2007/entries/moral-anti-realism/ link])&lt;/ref&gt; Someone employing the robust model might call such a view "realist non-cognitivism," while someone employing the minimal model might simply place such a view alongside other, more traditional, forms of non-cognitivism.

The robust model and the minimal model also disagree over how to classify moral subjectivism (roughly, the view that moral facts are not mind-independent in the relevant sense, but that moral statements may still be true). The historical association of subjectivism with moral anti-realism in large part explains why the robust model of moral realism has been dominant&amp;mdash;even if only implicitly&amp;mdash;both in the traditional and contemporary philosophical literature on metaethics.&lt;ref name=Joyce/&gt;

In the minimal sense of realism, [[R.&amp;nbsp;M. Hare]] could be considered a realist in his later works, as he is committed to the objectivity of value judgments, even though he denies that moral statements express propositions with [[truth-value]]s per se. Moral constructivists like [[John Rawls]] and [[Christine Korsgaard]]&lt;ref name=Korsgaard&gt;Korsgaard, Christine (1996). ''The Sources of Normativity'', New York: [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; may also be realists in this minimalist sense; the latter describes her own position as procedural realism. Some readings of evolutionary science such as those of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[James Mark Baldwin]] have suggested that in so far as an [[ethics]] may be associated with survival strategies and natural selection then such behavior may be associated with a moderate position of moral realism equivalent to an ethics of survival.

==Advantages==
Moral realism allows the ordinary rules of logic ([[modus ponens]], etc.) to be applied straightforwardly to moral statements. We can say that a moral belief is ''false'' or ''unjustified'' or ''contradictory'' in the same way we would about a factual belief. This is a problem for [[expressivism]], as shown by the [[Frege–Geach problem]].

Another advantage of moral realism is its capacity to resolve moral disagreements: if two moral beliefs contradict one another, realism says that they cannot both be right, and therefore everyone involved ought to be seeking out the right answer to resolve the disagreement. Contrary theories of [[meta-ethics]] have trouble even formulating the statement "this moral belief is wrong," and so they cannot resolve disagreements in this way.

== Proponents ==
[[Philippa Foot]] adopts a moral realist position, criticizing [[Charles Stevenson|Stevenson's]] idea that when evaluation is superposed on fact there has been a "committal in a new dimension."&lt;ref name="Foot"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foot | first1 = Philippa | year = 1958 | title = Moral Beliefs | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 83–104 | doi=10.1093/aristotelian/59.1.83}}&lt;/ref&gt; She introduces, by analogy, the practical implications of using the word "injury." Not just anything counts as an injury. There must be some impairment. When we suppose a man wants the things the injury prevents him from obtaining, haven’t we fallen into the old [[naturalistic fallacy]]?
{{quote|It may seem that the only way to make a necessary connexion between 'injury' and the things that are to be avoided, is to say that it is only used in an 'action-guiding sense' when applied to something the speaker intends to avoid. But we should look carefully at the crucial move in that argument, and query the suggestion that someone might happen not to want anything for which he would need the use of hands or eyes. Hands and eyes, like ears and legs, play a part in so many operations that a man could only be said not to need them if he had no wants at all.&lt;ref name="Foot"/&gt;{{rp|96}}}}
Foot argues that the virtues, like hands and eyes in the analogy, play so large a part in so many operations that it is implausible to suppose that a committal in a non-naturalist dimension is necessary to demonstrate their goodness.
{{quote|Philosophers who have supposed that actual action was required if 'good' were to be used in a sincere evaluation have got into difficulties over weakness of will, and they should surely agree that enough has been done if we can show that any man has reason to aim at virtue and avoid vice. But is this impossibly difficult if we consider the kinds of things that count as virtue and vice? Consider, for instance, the cardinal virtues, prudence, temperance, courage and justice. Obviously any man needs prudence, but does he not also need to resist the temptation of pleasure when there is harm involved? And how could it be argued that he would never need to face what was fearful for the sake of some good? It is not obvious what someone would mean if he said that temperance or courage were not good qualities, and this not because of the 'praising' sense of these words, but because of the things that courage and temperance are.&lt;ref name="Foot"/&gt;{{rp|97}}}}

==Criticisms==
Several criticisms have been raised against moral realism: The first is that, while realism can explain how to resolve moral conflicts, it does not explain how these conflicts arose in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, John, ''Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong'' (Viking Press, 1977) part 1, chap. 1, section 8 : The argument from relativity: "The actual variations in the moral codes are more readily explained by the hypothesis that they reflect ways of life than by the hypothesis that they express perceptions, most of them seriously inadequate and badly distorted, of objective values"&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread disagreement about what is right and wrong is puzzling if humans are assumed to have access to moral facts.

The evolutionary debunking argument suggests that because human psychology is primarily produced by evolutionary processes which do not seem to have a reason to be sensitive to moral facts, that taking a moral realist stance can only lead to moral skepticism.  This undercuts the motivations for taking a moral realist stance, namely to be able to assert there are reliable moral standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/phc3.12194 | volume=10 | title=Evolutionary Debunking of Moral Realism | journal=Philosophy Compass | pages=104–116 | last1 = Vavova | first1 = Katia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others are critical of moral realism because it postulates the existence of a kind of "moral fact" which is nonmaterial and does not appear to be accessible to empirical investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Harman, Gilbert, ''The Nature of Morality : An Introduction to Ethics'' (Oxford,1977), I.1, "Ethics and observation"&lt;/ref&gt; Moral truths cannot be [[observation|observed]] in the same way as material facts (which are objective), so it seems odd to count them in the same category.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, John, ''Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong'' (Viking Press, 1977) part 1, chap. 1, section 9 : The argument from Queerness&lt;/ref&gt; However, such an argument may be applicable to our concepts of epistemic justification as well, possibly leading to radical skepticism, an undesirable result for the moral anti-realist as it would undercut their argument too.&lt;ref&gt;Terence Cuneo, The Normative Web: An Argument for Moral Realism (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  This criticism is also not applicable to [[ethical naturalism]], a form of moral realism which suggests the possibility of a science of morality by considering morality claims to be referring to observable entities (such as wellbeing).

'''''Parallel Universes, A Memoir from the Edges of Space and Time''''' is a [[non-fiction]] Christian book and a personal and science [[memoir]] written by Linda Morabito Meyer, the [[NASA]] discoverer of the volcanic activity on [[Jupiter]]'s [[Io (moon)|Io]].  The book documents the author’s several [[near-death experience]]s and purported visits to [[Heaven]] between 1954 and 1956; the author’s quest to uncover a hidden past from 2003 to 2011; and the events of the author’s major NASA science discovery in 1979.&lt;ref name="Morabito"&gt;[http://www.lindamorabito.com Linda Morabito website].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
During the time the memoir was compiled, a fifty-year-old mystery in Morabito Meyer’s life was solved.  She discovered that her parents had been members of the [[Temple of the Abundant Life]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, run by a convicted criminal who was wanted on outstanding warrants in the United States.  William Franklin Wolsey was masquerading as a Bishop in this [[cult]], and was the target of investigative reporting by the ''Vancouver Sun'' newspaper.&lt;ref name="Reporting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826164,00.html|title=Education: The World of Uncle Bill|date=28 March 1960|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2018|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author’s memories of horrific childhood abuse documented in the book, corresponded to the events reported in the news in 1959, at the time she learned about the cult in 2011. This information is summarized in the book’s epilogue.  Her memories included near death experiences as a result of her parents’ involvement with William Franklin Wolsey, in which she remembers visiting Heaven and seeing [[Jesus]].  Meyer maintains that William Franklin Wolsey was responsible for the deaths of four children she witnessed.  Meyer, who moved with her parents to the United States in 1961, became an astronomer and working for NASA’s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] on NASA’s [[Voyager program|Voyager]] mission to Jupiter, discovered the volcanic activity on Jupiter’s moon Io in 1979.  The memoir interleaves the author’s noteworthy science, personal, and religious experiences.

The book interweaves three journeys told in the author’s words.  She expresses her love of [[astronomy]], which led her to make the discovery of the volcanic activity on Jupiter’s moon Io in 1979. The discovery is considered the largest of [[NASA]]'s planetary exploration program.&lt;ref name="Time Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952568,00.html|title=Press: Hitting a Magazine Trif ecta|date=21 January 1980|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2018|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She expresses the horror of a childhood marred by her parents' involvement with a [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada cult between the years of 1954 and 1956. To aid victims of [[childhood abuse]], the author highlights a treatment used for [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="EMDR"&gt;[http://www.emdr.com/client-stories/62-parallel-universes-a-memoir-from-the-edges-of-space-and-time.html EMDR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420220150/http://www.emdr.com/client-stories/62-parallel-universes-a-memoir-from-the-edges-of-space-and-time.html |date=2012-04-20 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kindle release==
On November 16, 2010, Linda Morabito Meyer provided an early version of the book in [[Amazon Kindle]] electronic format, with the ability for the public to update the book through [[Amazon.com]] at no charge, as Morabito Meyer’s investigation into her past was completed.&lt;ref name="Kindle"&gt;[http://Amazon%20https://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Universes-Memoir-Edges-ebook/dp/B004CLYMK2/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322274819&amp;sr=8-2 Kindle]&lt;/ref&gt; The Kindle version was updated to match the final version of the book released in paperback on October 13, 2011.&lt;ref name="DailyPress"&gt;[http://www.highdesert.com/news/tells-30865-vvdailypress-victorville-explorer.html Daily Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407041632/http://www.highdesert.com/news/tells-30865-vvdailypress-victorville-explorer.html |date=2012-04-07 }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Pirzada''' ({{lang-fa|''' پیرزاده  '''}}) is historically described as official custodians of [[Sufi]] mausoleums and shrines in [[Muslim lands]], with their earliest mentions being in [[Baghdad]], Iraq, during the period of the [[Umayyad]] caliphate. Often a Peerzada was a descendant of those buried within the tomb they were assigned to, hence most of the Peerzadas are syeds.

It also serves as surname for their ascendants in many [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] cultures and their accompanying languages, with Peerzada translating into “the son of a saint” in Persian. Today, predominantly-Muslim families bearing the name can be found in various regions around the world, including [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Kashmir]] and the northern regions of [[India]]. Much of their lineage can be traced to the central Asian plateaus, consisting of the [[Soviet Union]]’s former republics, such as [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Tajikistan]]. Much of the modern-day Peerzada diaspora derives from the mass migration of the community from Central Asia towards several different areas immediately at a date that is estimated to be sometime during the 15th century.

==Diaspora==

===Pirzadas of India and Pakistan===
Pirzadas found within Pakistan are most likely to belong to either the [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]], [[Siraiki people|Siraiki]], [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]], Haryanvi, Urdu-speaking ethnic groups, as these regions comprise Pakistan’s northernmost borders. The earliest recorded instance of the surname lays in a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] court official named Nur-ud-din Peerzada, who served at the [[Serai Nurmahal]] in the city of Nurmahal in Punjab, in 1693. By the time the Indian subcontinent was fully under control of the [[British Empire]], Ehsan Peerzada ran a carpet-weaving guild in [[Amritsar]] that wove rugs for use by members of the British Royal Family, and Anglo aristocrats that resided in the [[British Raj]], such as [[Sir John Lawrence]], the first British governor of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] province. At the time of [[partition of India]] in 1947, Peerzadas still resided primarily in the city of Amritsar, the bastion of [[Sikhism]] in the province of Punjab, with their eventual migration to the Pakistani portion of Punjab leading to their eventual spreading out over the province, albeit with a concentration of individuals in the city of [[Lahore]].

===Peerzadas of Kashmir===
Peerzadas in Kashmir moved from Iran with Muslim missionaries to spread Islam. The family name  Most of the Peerzadas in Kashmir have the suffix as Shah, Owaisi, Abtahie with there names owing to the origin in Iran. The roots of Peerzadas in Kashmir is Syed.

===Peerzadas of Turkey===
The origins of Peerzadas as they lay in Central Asia also translated into their presence in the realms of the former [[Ottoman Empire]]. As late as 1710, Ottoman census records indicate Peerzadas residing in Turkish municipalities such [[Istanbul]], [[Denizli]], [[Bursa]], and [[Tokat]], with their professions revolving around textiles, finance, and military service. Cüneyt Peerzada held the rank of Binbaşı, or [[Major]], in the Kapıkulu Süvarileri, or [[Six Divisions of Cavalry]] of the Ottoman Empire, as per records from 1741. The Peerzadas of Turkey also practiced carpet-weaving in much the same fashion as their counterparts in the Indian subcontinent, with Ottoman tax receipts displaying a thriving artisan practice in [[Tokat]] as late as 1874. Today, Peerzadas, having fully assimilated into Turkish society, can be found living mainly in the country’s economical and social hubs of Istanbul and [[Ankara]], while retaining ties with their kin in other countries such as Pakistan, [[Iran]], and [[Afghanistan]].

===Peerzadas of Iran===
Peerzadas were first recorded in modern-day [[Persia]] during the rule of the [[Qajar Dynasty]], which ruled Iran from 1785 to 1925. Census records indicate their first presence being in the village of [[Urmia]], close to the border with [[Azerbaijan]], in the year 1783, although they had been a mainstay in the region for close to a century prior. Originally a farming community, Peerzadas eventually began to emerge as an astute family of financial bankers in the cities of [[Tehran]] and [[Qom]], with tax records indicating their roles as facilitators of mercantile trade and credit among officials of the Qajar dynasty and foreigners wishing to ship their wares to Persia. Some Peerzadas eventually harnessed their financial backgrounds for the purpose of the Qajar themselves, with an upwards of six generations of the family serving as civil servants and bureaucrats for the government till the last-recorded instance of 1911. In addition, Peerzadas combined their expertise in textiles and finance in order to benefit from [[Isfahan]]’s status as the artisan hub of Islamic crafts and goods, as the family not only wove, but handled the business behind their own autonomous carpeting businesses.

===Peerzadas of Afghanistan===
The Peerzadas of [[Afghanistan]] were relatively few in number: the community never expanded beyond a few dozen patrons of a single family, although a minority of them are found in the city of Ghazni Afghanistan.

==Demographics==

===Religion===
Peerzadas are affiliated with [[Islam]] due to their origins in [[Central Asia]], although there does exist a diversity in regards to the sects and subdivisions of the faith. Peerzada s found in Pakistan and Northern India sympathize with the [[Shia]] branch of Islam, while there exists a small minority of them within them who actively profess faith in the [[Aga Khan]] and subsequently the practices of the [[Shia Imami Ismaili Nizaris]]. A few belong to [[Sikh]] community.

===Ethnicity===
At their core, every individual belonging to the Peerzada family comes from an [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] bloodline originating in [[Central Asia]]. They originally belong to the Aryan race, which is predominately found in India. They are not Semite (not a lost tribe of Jews, as thought by some historians). They are found in the footprints of Aryan peoples like, Afghanistan, India, Iran, Turkey etc.

{{Platonism}}
'''Plato's [[epistemology]]''' holds that knowledge of [[Theory of forms|Platonic Ideas]] is innate, so that learning is the development of ideas buried deep in the soul, often under the midwife-like guidance of an interrogator.  In several dialogues by [[Plato]], the character [[Socrates]] presents the view that each soul existed before birth with [[the Form of the Good]] and a perfect knowledge of Ideas.  Thus, when an Idea is "learned" it is actually just "recalled".&lt;ref&gt;Ackrill, J.L. "Anamnēsis in the Phaedo," in E.N. Lee and A.P.D. Mourelatos (eds.) Exegesis and Argument: Studies in Greek Philosophy Presented to Gregory Vlastos. Assen, 1973. 177-95.
On the theory of recollection in Plato's Phaedo(73c-75).&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato drew a sharp distinction between [[knowledge]], which is certain, and mere true [[opinion]], which is not certain.  Opinions derive from the shifting world of sensation; knowledge derives from the world of timeless Forms, or [[essence]]s.  In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', these concepts were illustrated using the [[metaphor of the sun]], the [[analogy of the divided line]], and the [[allegory of the cave]].

==Platonic doctrine of recollection==
The ''Platonic doctrine of recollection'' or ''[[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]'',  is the idea that we are born possessing all [[knowledge]] and our realization of that knowledge is contingent on our discovery of it. Whether the doctrine should be taken literally or not is a subject of debate. The soul is trapped in the body.  The soul once lived in "Reality", but got trapped in the body.  It once knew everything, but forgot it.  The goal of Recollection is to get back to true Knowledge.  To do this, one must overcome the body. This doctrine implies that nothing is ever learned, it is simply recalled or remembered. In short it says that all that we know already comes pre-loaded on birth and our senses enable us to identify and recognize the stratified information in our mind.

==Metaphor of the sun==
{{See details|Plato's metaphor of the sun}}
In The Republic (507b-509c) Plato's Socrates uses the sun as a metaphor for the source of "intellectual illumination," which he held to be ''The Form of the Good''. The metaphor is about the nature of ultimate reality and how we come to know it. It starts with the eye, which Socrates says is unusual among the sense organs in that it needs a medium, namely light, in order to operate. The strongest and best source of light is the sun; with it, we can discern objects clearly. Analogously for intelligible objects ''The Form of the Good'' is necessary in order to understand any particular thing. Thus, if we attempt to understand why things are as they are, and what general categories can be used to understand various particulars around us, without reference to any forms (universals) we will fail completely. By contrast, "the domain where truth and reality shine resplendent" is none other than Plato's world of forms—illuminated by the highest of the forms, that of the Good.

==The divided line==
{{See details|Plato's divided line}}
In Plato's Republic, Book VI, the divided line has two parts that represent the intelligible world and the smaller visible world. Each of those two parts is divided, the segments within the intelligible world represent higher and lower forms and the segments within the visible world represent ordinary visible objects and their shadows, reflections, and other representations.  The line segments are unequal and their lengths represent "their comparative clearness and obscurity" and their comparative "reality and truth," as well as whether we have knowledge or instead mere opinion of the objects.

==Allegory of the cave==
{{See details|Plato's allegory of the cave}}
In his best-known dialogue, ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'', [[Plato]] drew an analogy between human sensation and the shadows that pass along the wall of a cave - an [[allegory]] known as [[Plato's allegory of the cave]].

==Charioteer myth==
{{See details|Chariot Allegory}}
Along with these other allegories, Plato's [[Chariot Allegory|charioteer myth]] ([[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]] 245c-257b) certainly also deserves mention.  The ascent of the mind to celestial and trans-celestial realms is likened to a charioteer and a chariot drawn by two winged horses, one dark and one white.  Figuratively represented is the famous Platonic ''tripartite model'' of the soul:  the charioteer represents reason, or intellect, the dark horse appetitive passions, and the white horse irascible nature.  Only by taming and controlling the two horses can the charioteer ascend to the heavens and enjoy a banquet of divine knowledge.  Key epistemological features of the charioteer myth are (1) an emphasis, as with the cave allegory, upon true knowledge as ascent, (2) and the need to tame one's passionate nature to obtain true knowledge.

==An example: love and wisdom==
A good example of how Plato presents the acquiring of knowledge is contained in the ''Ladder of Love''.  In ''Symposium'' (210a-211b), Plato's Socrates cites the priestess Diotima as defining a "lover" as someone who loves and [[love]] as a desire for something that one does not have.  According to this ladder model of love, a lover progresses from [[wikt:rung|rung]] to rung from the basest love to the pure form of love as follows:

#''A beautiful body'' - The lover begins here at the most obvious form of love.
#''All beautiful bodies'' - If the lover examines his love and does some investigating, he/she will find that the [[beauty]] contained in this beautiful body is not original, that it is shared by every beautiful body.
#''Beautiful [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s'' - After most likely attempting to have every beautiful body, the lover should realize that if a single love does not satisfy, there is no reason to think that many ones will satisfy.  Thus, the "lover of every body" must, in the words of Plato, "bring his passion for the one into due proportion by deeming it of little or of no importance."  Instead, the passion is transferred to a more appropriate object: the soul.
#''The beauty of [[law]]s and [[institution]]s'' - The next [[logic]]al step is for the lover to love all beautiful souls and then to transfer that love to that which is responsible for their existence: a moderate, harmonious and just social order.
#''The beauty of [[knowledge]]'' - Once proceeding down this path, the lover will naturally long for that which produces and makes intelligible good social institutions: knowledge.
#''Beauty itself'' - This is the platonic "form" of beauty itself.  It is not a particular thing that is beautiful, but is instead the essence of beauty.  Plato describes this level of love as a "wondrous vision," an "everlasting loveliness which neither comes nor ages, which neither flowers nor fades."  It is eternal and isn't "anything that is of the flesh" nor "words" nor "knowledge" but consists "of itself and by itself in an eternal oneness, while every lovely thing partakes of it."

Knowledge concerning other things is similarly gained by progressing from a base reality (or shadow) of the thing sought (red, tall, thin, keen, etc.) to the eventual form of the thing sought, or the thing sought itself.  Such steps follow the same pattern as Plato's metaphor of the sun, his allegory of the cave and his divided line; progress brings one closer and closer to reality as each step explains the relative reality of the past.

'''Polyamory''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|el|πολύ}} ''{{lang|el-Latn|poly}}'', "many, several", and [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|amor}}'', "[[love]]") is the practice of, or desire for, [[intimate relationship]]s with more than one partner, with the [[Consent (criminal law)|consent]] of all partners involved.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sheff | first = Elisabeth | title = When Someone You Love Is Polyamorous: Understanding Poly People and Relationships | publisher = Thorntree Press | location = Portland, Oregon | year = 2016 | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0996460195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haritaworn|first=J.|last2=Lin|first2=C.-j.|last3=Klesse|first3=C.|date=2016-08-15|title=Poly/logue: A Critical Introduction to Polyamory|journal=Sexualities|volume=9|issue=5|pages=515–529|doi=10.1177/1363460706069963}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "consensual, [[Ethics|ethical]], and [[Moral responsibility|responsible]] [[non-monogamy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart.

==Terminology==
{{Main|Terminology within polyamory}}
The word ''polyamorous'' first appeared in an article by [[Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart]], "A Bouquet of Lovers", published in May 1990 in ''[[Green Egg|Green Egg Magazine]]'', as "poly-amorous".&lt;ref name="pitn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polyinthemedia.blogspot.co.uk/2007/01/polyamory-enters-oxford-english.html|title="Polyamory" enters the Oxford English Dictionary, and tracking the word's origins|date=6 January 2007|work=Polyamory in the News!|author="Alan"|accessdate=27 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1992, Jennifer L. Wesp created the [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] ''alt.polyamory'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/polyamory/faq/section-1.html |title=alt.polyamory Frequently Asked Questions: Section – 1). What's alt.polyamory?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] cites the proposal to create that group as the first verified appearance of the word.&lt;ref name="pitn"/&gt; The words "polyamory, -ous, and -ist" were added to the OED in 2006.&lt;ref name="oed.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/previous-updates/september-2006-update/|title=September 2006 update|date=14 September 2006|work=The OED today|publisher=[[Oxford Dictionaries]]|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Zell-Ravenheart was asked by the editor of the OED to provide a definition of the term, and had provided it for the UK version as "the practice, state or ability of having more than one sexual loving relationship at the same time, with the full knowledge and consent of all partners involved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Ravenhearts |title=Frequently Asked Questions re: Polyamory |url=http://www.mithrilstar.org/Polyamory-FAQ-Ravenhearts.htm|accessdate=July 6, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324124641/http://www.mithrilstar.org/Polyamory-FAQ-Ravenhearts.htm |archivedate=March 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==
There is a cultural divide between the polyamorous and [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinger]] communities, the former emphasizing the emotional and egalitarian aspects of plural relationships and the latter emphasizing sexual non-monogamy and emotional monogamy.&lt;ref name="case_for_swingers"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; A person with polyamorous relationships may also engage in swinging and other open relationships. As well, swingers occasionally develop deep emotional attachments with their sexual friends. Swingers and polyamorous people alike might engage in secret infidelities, though this is no more acceptable than in monogamy.

==As a practice==
Separate from polyamory as a philosophical basis for relationship, are the practical ways in which people who live polyamorously arrange their lives and handle certain issues, as compared to those of a more conventional monogamous arrangement.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

As a relational practice, polyamory sustains a vast variety of open relationship or multi-partner constellations, which can differ in definition and grades of intensity, closeness and commitment.&lt;ref name="Fidelity"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klesse|first1=Christian|title=Polyamory: Intimate practice, identity or sexual orientation?|journal=Sexualities|date=February 5, 2014|volume=17|issue=1–2|page=81|doi=10.1177/1363460713511096|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1363460713511096}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, polyamory functions as an umbrella term for the multiple approaches of 'responsible non-monogamy'.&lt;ref name="Fidelity" /&gt; A secret sexual relationship that violates those accords would be seen as a breach of fidelity. Polyamorists generally base definitions of ''commitment'' on considerations other than sexual exclusivity, e.g. "trust and honesty" or "growing old together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Elaine |last=Cook |title=Commitment in Polyamorous Relationships |url=http://www.aphroweb.net/papers/thesis/index.htm |year=2005 |accessdate=July 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Communication and negotiation:''' Because there is no "standard model" for polyamorous relationships, and reliance upon common expectations may not be realistic, polyamorists often{{how often|date=March 2018}} advocate explicitly negotiating with all involved to establish the terms of their relationships, and often emphasize that this should be an ongoing process of honest communication and respect. Polyamorists will usually take a pragmatic approach to their relationships; many accept that sometimes they and their partners will make mistakes and fail to live up to these ideals, and that communication is important for repairing any breaches.&lt;ref name="polyoz_values" /&gt;&lt;ref name="s.org" /&gt;
* '''Trust, honesty, dignity, and respect:''' Most{{original research inline|date=March 2018}} polyamorists emphasize respect, trust, and honesty for all partners.&lt;ref name="polyoz_values"&gt;From PolyOz glossary: "Not in the [linguistic roots of the term] but very important is the commitment to honesty with all partners, and openly negotiated ground rules." [http://polyoz.scm-rpg.com.au/postnuke2/index.php?module=ContentExpress&amp;func=display&amp;ceid=8&amp;meid=-1 Scm-rpg.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227071434/http://polyoz.scm-rpg.com.au/postnuke2/index.php?module=ContentExpress&amp;func=display&amp;ceid=8&amp;meid=-1 |date=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="s.org"&gt;From [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20160310195736/http://www.sexuality.org/book/ sexuality.org]: "Two of the cultural cornerstones of the polyamory community are honesty and communication: it's expected that you and your existing long-term partner(s) will have talked over what you're comfortable with and what you aren't comfortable with, and that nobody is going around behind anyone else's back."&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, a partner's partners are accepted as part of that person's life rather than merely tolerated, and usually a relationship that requires deception or a "don't ask don't tell" policy is seen as a less than ideal model.
* '''Non-possessiveness:''' Many polyamorists{{Who|date=January 2017}} view excessive restrictions on other deep relationships as less than desirable, as such restrictions can be used to replace trust with a framework of ownership and control. It is usually preferred or encouraged that a polyamorist strive to view their partners' other significant others (often referred to as metamours or OSOs)&lt;ref name="More Than Two 2013"&gt;{{cite web |title=Glossary of Polyamory Terms |website=More Than Two |date=2013-01-22 |url=https://www.morethantwo.com/polyglossary.html |access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of the gain to their partners' lives rather than a threat to their own (see [[#Compersion|compersion]]). Therefore, jealousy and possessiveness are generally viewed not so much as something to avoid or structure the relationships around, but as responses that should be explored, understood, and resolved within each individual, with compersion as a goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Attridge|first=Mark|date=2013-02-04|title=Jealousy and Relationship Closeness|journal=SAGE Open|volume=3|issue=1|page=215824401347605|doi=10.1177/2158244013476054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects upon domesticity===
Benefits of a polyamorous relationship might include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=PolyamoryOnline |url=http://www.polyamoryonline.org/articles/polyamoury_101.html |title=Polyamory 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ability of individuals to discuss issues with multiple partners, potentially mediating and thus stabilizing a relationship, and reducing  polarization of viewpoints.
* Emotional support and structure from other committed adults within the familial unit.
* A wider range of adult experience, skills, resources, and perspective.
* Support for companionate marriages, which can be satisfying even if no longer sexually vital, since romantic needs are met elsewhere. This acts to preserve existing relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Chicago School of Professional Psychology|url = http://ego.thechicagoschool.edu/s/843/images/editor_documents/What%2520therapists%2520should%2520know%2520about%2520Polyamory.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130919142325/http://ego.thechicagoschool.edu/s/843/images/editor_documents/What%20therapists%20should%20know%20about%20Polyamory.pdf|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2013-09-19|website = ego.thechicagoschool.edu|accessdate = 2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* More emotional, intellectual and sexual needs met as part of the understanding that one person cannot be expected provide all. Conversely, polyamory offers release from the monogamist expectation that one person must meet all of an individual's needs (sex, emotional support, primary friendship, intellectual stimulation, companionship, social presentation).

====Custody ramifications====
In 1998, a [[Tennessee]] court granted guardianship of a child to her grandmother and step-grandfather after the child's mother [[April Divilbiss]] and partners [[outing|outed]] themselves as polyamorous on [[MTV]]. After contesting the decision for two years, Divilbiss eventually agreed to relinquish her daughter, acknowledging that she was unable to adequately care for her child and that this, rather than her polyamory, had been the grandparents' real motivation in seeking custody.&lt;ref name="society"&gt;[http://www.polyamorysociety.org/Divilbiss_Families_Case_Ends.html Divilbiss Families Case Ends], Polyamory Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Compersion'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (or, in Britain, '''frubble'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christina Richards, Meg-John Barker (eds.), ''The Palgrave Handbook of the Psychology of Sexuality and Gender'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2015, pp. 267, 247, 253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polyamory Weekly (Podcast)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Polyamory Weekly #255 (Podcast) | url=http://polyweekly.com/2010/11/poly-weekly-255-a-poly-vagabond/ | accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an empathetic state of happiness and joy experienced when another individual experiences happiness and joy, and by members of the polyamory community{{definition|date=August 2017}} in the context of polyamorous relationships. It is used{{according to whom|date=August 2017}} to describe when a person experiences positive feelings{{vague|date=August 2017}} when a lover is enjoying another relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-polyamorists-next-door/201312/jealousy-and-compersion-multiple-partners-1 |title=Jealousy and Compersion with Multiple Partners – How polys deal with jealousy and feel happy when their lover loves someone else |last=Sheff |first=Elisabeth |date=December 17, 2013 |journal=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Compersion"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Anapol |first=Deborah M |year=1998 |title=COMPERSION: Meditation on Using Jealousy as a Path to Unconditional Love |publisher=IntinNet Resource Center |location=San Rafael, CA |url=http://www.lovewithoutlimits.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of compersion within the [[polyamorous]] community was originally coined by the [[Kerista Commune]] in [[San Francisco]], who also coined [[polyfidelity]] to describe their relational ideal.&lt;ref name="PolySoc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Polyamory Society Glossary | url=http://www.polyamorysociety.org/glossary.html | accessdate=December 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anapol"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Anapol |first=Deborah M |year=1997 |title=Polyamory: The New Love Without Limits |publisher=IntinNet Resource Center |location=San Rafael, CA |pages=49–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taormino"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Taormino |first=Tristan |year=2008 |title=Opening Up: A Guide to Creating and Sustaining Open Relationships |publisher=Cleis Press, Inc. |location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Easton and Liszt wrote that jealousy will inherently occur in open romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="EthicalSlut"&gt;Easton, Dossie &amp; Liszt, Catherine A. (1997) ''The Ethical Slut: A Guide to Infinite Sexual Possibilities.'' Greenery Press: San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Cuckold/Hotwife lifestyle, compersion may include the feelings associated with "Cuckold Angst" this feeling is often described as anxiety, fear, happiness and fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cuckold Angst |url=https://www.thecuckoldconsultant.com/articles/cuckold-angst-pt-1/ |website=The Cuckold Consultant |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Definitions of compersion====
* PolyOz—"the positive feelings one gets when a lover is enjoying another relationship. Sometimes called the opposite or flip side of jealousy." They comment that compersion can coexist with jealous feelings.&lt;ref name="PolyOz"&gt;[http://polyoz.net.au/component/glossary/Poly-Terms-and-Concepts-1/C/Compersion-5/ PolyOz | Compersion | Poly Terms and Concepts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101141159/http://polyoz.net.au/component/glossary/Poly-Terms-and-Concepts-1/C/Compersion-5/ |date=November 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Polyamory society—"the feeling of taking joy in the joy that others you love share among themselves, especially taking joy in the knowledge that your beloveds are expressing their love for one another".&lt;ref name="PolySoc" /&gt;
* The InnKeeper—"A feeling of joy when a loved one invests in and takes pleasure from another romantic or sexual relationship. ... Compersion does not specifically refer to joy regarding the sexual activity of one's partner, but refers instead to joy at the relationship with another romantic or sexual partner. It's analogous to the joy parents feel when their children get married, or to the happiness felt between best friends when they find a partner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Inn Between | url = http://www.theinnbetween.net/polyterms.html | first = Joreth | last = InnKeeper }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From ''Opening Up'', Serena Anderlini-D'Onofrio writes that compersion is, in part, "the ability to turn jealousy's negative feelings into [[acceptance]] of, and vicarious enjoyment for, a lover's joy" (p.&amp;nbsp;175).

==Philosophical aspects==
[[Bertrand Russell]] published ''[[Marriage and Morals]]'' in 1929, questioning contemporary notions of morality regarding monogamy in sex and marriage.&lt;ref name="SexEdPioneers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pioneers of Sex Education |url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/pioneers_of_sex_education.html |author=Haeberle, Erwin J. |year=1983 |accessdate=February 17, 2008 |publisher=The Continuum Publishing Company |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313020717/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/pioneers_of_sex_education.html |archivedate=March 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint was criticized by [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref name="Denied"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Appointment Denied: The Inquisition of Bertrand Russell |author=Leberstein, Stephen |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3860/is_200111/ai_n9008065 |publisher=Academe |date=November–December 2001 |accessdate=February 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004082928/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3860/is_200111/ai_n9008065 |archivedate=October 4, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 article in ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref name="Guardian Women"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/14/gender.uk |title=When two just won't do |newspaper=The Guardian |date=November 14, 2003 |author=Helen Echlin |accessdate=March 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed six primary reasons for choosing polyamory: 
*a drive towards female independence and equality driven by [[feminism]] — Jim Fleckenstein, director of the Institute for 21st-Century Relationships,{{who|date=September 2018}} states that "Increased financial independence means that women can build relationships the way they want to."
*disillusionment with monogamy — "because of widespread cheating and divorce"
*a yearning for community — a felt need for the richness of "complex and deep relationships through extended networks" in response to the replacement and fragmentation of the [[extended family]] by [[nuclear family|nuclear families]]: "[W]e have become increasingly alienated, partly because of the 20th century's replacement of the extended family with the nuclear family. As a result, many of us are striving to create complex and deep relationships through extended networks of multiple lovers and extended families…. Polys agree that some people are monogamous by nature. But some of us are not, and more and more are refusing to be shoehorned into monogamy."
*honesty and realism in respect of relational nature of human beings — "since so many people are already non-monogamous, why not develop a non-monogamy that is honest, responsible and socially acceptable? … It seems weird that having affairs is OK but being upfront about it is rocking the boat."&lt;ref&gt;''Women's Infidelity'' by Michelle Langley ({{ISBN|0-9767726-0-4}}) Straight talk about why women choose non-monogamy, 2005 [http://womensinfidelity.com Womensinfidelity.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
*human nature; and 
*individual non-matching of the traditional monogamous stereotype — a couple's response to a failure of monogamy, by reaching a consensus to accept the additional relationship.&lt;ref&gt;''Polyamory: The New Love without Limits'' by Deborah Anapol ({{ISBN|1-880789-08-6}}) has a chapter called "Making the transition to polyamorous relating", which deals with broken monogamous commitments from both perspectives.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acceptance by religious organizations==
{{See also|Fornication|Polygamy#Contemporary religious attitudes to polygamy|Polyandry#Religious attitudes}}
The [[Oneida Community]] in the 1800s in New York (a Christian religious commune) believed strongly in a system of [[free love]] known as [[complex marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Lawrence (2010). "Free Love and Community: John Humphrey Noyes and the Oneida Perfectionists." In: Donald E. Pitzer (ed.), ''America's Communal Utopias''.

Some people consider themselves Christian and polyamorous, but mainstream Christianity [[Porneia|does not accept polyamory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multiple intimate relationships: a summary of liberated Christians' views|url=http://www.libchrist.com/bible/polygamy.html|website=Liberated Christians|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29, 2017, the [[Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood]] released a manifesto on human sexuality known as the "Nashville Statement". The statement was signed by 150 evangelical leaders, and includes 14 points of belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Meyer |first=Holly |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/08/29/evangelical-manifesto-human-sexuality/614201001/ |title=More than 150 evangelical religious leaders sign 'Christian manifesto' on human sexuality |date=August 29, 2017 |work=USA Today |accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, it states, "We deny that God has designed marriage to be a homosexual, polygamous, or polyamorous relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/08/30/what-nashville-statement-and-why-people-talking-it/619009001/ |title=What is the Nashville Statement and why are people talking about it? |publisher=Usatoday.com |date= |accessdate=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mikelionis |first=Lukas |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/08/30/evangelicals-draw-critics-with-nashville-statement-on-sexuality.html |title=Evangelicals draw critics with 'Nashville Statement' on sexuality |publisher=Fox News |date= |accessdate=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Jews are polyamorous, but mainstream Judaism does not accept polyamory; however, [[Sharon Kleinbaum]], the senior rabbi at [[Congregation Beit Simchat Torah]] in New York, has said that polyamory is a choice that does not preclude a Jewishly observant and socially conscious life.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Polyamorous Jews seek acceptance |agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |date=October 12, 2013 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.551971 |accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some polyamorous Jews also point to biblical patriarchs having multiple wives and concubines as evidence that polyamorous relationships can be sacred in Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lavin |first=Talia |url=http://www.jta.org/2013/10/10/news-opinion/united-states/ahava-raba-polyamorous-jews-engage-with-multiple-loves-and-their-jewish-traditions |title=Married and dating: Polyamorous Jews share love, seek acceptance &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2013-10-10 |accessdate=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; An email list was founded dedicated to polyamorous Jews, called ''AhavaRaba'', which roughly translates to "big love" in Hebrew,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2013/10/10/news-opinion/united-states/ahava-raba-polyamorous-jews-engage-with-multiple-loves-and-their-jewish-traditions#ixzz2hcUsvBTx|title=Married and dating: Polyamorous Jews share love, seek acceptance|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whose name echoes God's "great" or "abounding" love mentioned in the [[Ahava rabbah]] prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hoffman|editor1-first=Lawrence|title=My People's Prayer Book: The Sh'ma and its blessings|date=1997|publisher=Jewish Lights Publishing|isbn=9781879045798|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LaVeyan Satanism]] is critical of Abrahamic sexual mores, considering them narrow, restrictive and hypocritical. Satanists are pluralists, accepting polyamorists, bisexuals, lesbians, gays, BDSM, transgender people, and asexuals. Sex is viewed as an indulgence, but one that should only be freely entered into with consent. [[LaVeyan Satanism#The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth|The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth]] only give two instructions regarding sex: "Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal" and "Do not harm little children," though the latter is much broader and encompasses physical and other abuse. This has always been consistent part of CoS policy since its inception in 1966, as Peter H. Gillmore wrote in an essay supporting [[same-sex marriage]]:

{{quote| Finally, since certain people try to suggest that our attitude on sexuality is "anything goes" despite our stated base principle of "responsibility to the responsible", we must reiterate another fundamental dictate: The Church of Satan's philosophy strictly forbids sexual activity with children as well as with non-human animals.|Magister Peter H. Gilmore&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/FoundingFamily.html "Founding Family: 'Morality' versus Same-Sex Marriage"].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness]], founded in 2001, has engaged in ongoing education and advocacy for greater understanding and acceptance of polyamory within the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uupa.org |title=UUPA website }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2014 [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|General Assembly]], two UUPA members moved to include the category of "family and relationship structures" in the UUA's nondiscrimination rule, along with other amendments; the package of proposed amendments was ratified by the GA delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |title=Unitarian Universalist Association: Rule II, Section C-2.3.: Non-discrimination |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518103753/http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |archivedate=May 18, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage implications==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2018}}
[[File:Polyamory pride in San Francisco 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Start of polyamory contingent at [[San Francisco Pride]] 2004]]
[[Bigamy]] is the act of marrying one person while already being married to another, and is legally prohibited in most countries in which monogamy is the cultural norm. Some bigamy statutes are broad enough to potentially encompass polyamorous relationships involving [[cohabitation]], even if none of the participants claim marriage to more than one partner.

In most countries, it is legal for three or more people to form and share a sexual relationship (subject sometimes to laws against [[homosexuality]] or [[adultery]] if two of the three are married). With only minor exceptions no developed countries permit ''marriage'' among more than two people, nor do the majority of countries give legal protection (e.g., of rights relating to children) to non-married partners. Individuals involved in polyamorous relationships are generally considered by the law to be no different from people who live together, or "date", under other circumstances. In 2017 John Alejandro Rodriguez, Victor Hugo Prada, and Manuel Jose Bermudez become Colombia's first polyamorous family to have a legally recognized relationship,&lt;ref name="advocate1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reynolds |first=Daniel |url=https://www.advocate.com/world/2017/6/15/three-gay-men-make-history-marrying-colombia |title=Three Gay Men Make History by Marrying in Colombia |publisher=Advocate.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; though not a marriage: "By Colombian law a marriage is between two people, so we had to come up with a new word: a special patrimonial union."&lt;ref name="Guard01"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brodzinski|first=Sibylla|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/03/colombia-three-men-union-alejandro-rodriguez-manuel-bermudez-victor-hugo-prada |publisher=The Guardian|title=Colombia legally recognises union between three men |date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many jurisdictions where same-sex couples can access [[civil unions]] or [[registered partnerships]], these are often intended as parallel institutions to that of heterosexual monogamous marriage. Accordingly, they include parallel entitlements, obligations, and limitations. Among the latter, as in the case of the New Zealand Civil Union Act 2005, there are parallel prohibitions on civil unions with more than one partner, which is considered bigamy, or dual marriage/civil union hybrids with more than one person. Both are banned under Sections 205–206 of the Crimes Act 1961. In jurisdictions where [[same-sex marriage]] proper exists, bigamous same-sex marriages fall under the same set of legal prohibitions as bigamous heterosexual marriages. As yet, there is no case law applicable to these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Webb ''et al.'' (eds) Butterworths Guide to Family Law in New Zealand: (13th Edition): Wellington: Lexis/Nexis: 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Having multiple non-marital partners, even if married to one, is legal in most U.S. jurisdictions; at most it constitutes grounds for [[divorce]] if the spouse is non-consenting, or feels that the interest in a further partner has destabilized the marriage. In jurisdictions where civil unions or registered partnerships are recognized, the same principle applies to divorce in those contexts. There are exceptions to this: in [[North Carolina]], a spouse can sue a third party for causing "loss of affection" in or "criminal conversation" ([[adultery]]) with their spouse,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoc.state.nc.us/www/public/coa/opinions/2001/010003-1.htm RUBY DEATON PHARR, Plaintiff, v. JOYCE W. BECK, Defendant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050514053051/http://www.aoc.state.nc.us/www/public/coa/opinions/2001/010003-1.htm |date=May 14, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than twenty states in the US have laws against adultery&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.findlaw.com/legal-commentary/punishing-adultery-in-virginia.html Punishing Adultery in Virginia] by Joanna Grossman&lt;/ref&gt; although they are infrequently enforced. Some states were prompted to review their laws criminalizing consensual sexual activity in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.

At present, the extension to multiple-partner relationships of laws that use a criterion similar to that adopted in the [[United Kingdom]], i.e., "married ''or living together as married''" remains largely untested. That is, it is not known whether these laws could treat some trios or larger groups as [[common-law marriage]]s.

If marriage is intended, some countries provide for both a religious marriage and a civil ceremony (sometimes combined). These recognize and formalize the relationship. Few countries outside of Africa or Asia give [[Legality of polygamy|legal recognition]] to marriages with three or more partners. While a recent case in the [[Netherlands]] was commonly read as demonstrating that Dutch law permitted multiple-partner [[civil union]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/301 First Trio "Married" in The Netherlands] by Paul Belien, Brussels Journal Online&lt;/ref&gt; the relationship in question was a ''[[:nl:samenlevingscontract|samenlevingscontract]]'', or "cohabitation contract", and not a registered partnership or marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refdag.nl/artikel/1230743/&amp;bdquo%3BHuwelijk+wordt+steeds+verder+opgerekt&amp;rdquo%3B.html|title=Huwelijk wordt steeds verder opgerekt|author=Ewout van der Staaij|work=refdag.nl|access-date=March 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319041902/http://www.refdag.nl/artikel/1230743/%26bdquo%3BHuwelijk+wordt+steeds+verder+opgerekt%26rdquo%3B.html|archive-date=March 19, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/006/494pqobc.asp?pg=2|title=Here Come the Brides|work=weeklystandard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlands' law concerning registered partnerships provides that
#a person may be involved in one only registered partnership with one other person whether of the same or of opposite sex at any one time.

*Ronald C. Den Otter has stated that in the United States the Constitutional rights of [[due process]] and [[equal protection]] fully support marriage rights for polyamorous families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Den Otter|first1=Ron|title=Three May Not Be a Crowd: The Case for a Constitutional Right to Plural Marriage|url=http://law.emory.edu/elj/_documents/volumes/64/6/den-otter.pdf|accessdate=27 June 2015|work=Emory Law Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.N. effort to ban non-monogamous marriage===
Such endeavors, however, may be moot. In 1979, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]] adopted the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] ([https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/cedaw.htm CEDAW]), an international bill of rights for women, with 99 initial signatories and an eventual [[List of parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|189 ratifying parties]]. The intent is to make monogamous marriage the only legal form, worldwide, with progress monitored by the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]]. Polygamy is seen as contrary to CEDAW Article 16, which bars "discrimination against women in all matters relating to marriage and family relations."

===Media coverage===
{{undue weight section|date=August 2017}}
During a [[PinkNews]] question-and-answer session in May 2015, Redfern Jon Barrett questioned [[Natalie Bennett]], leader of the [[Green Party of England and Wales]], about her party's stance towards polyamorous marriage rights. Bennett responded by saying that her party is "open" to discussion on the idea of civil partnership or marriages between three people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCormick|first1=Joseph|title=Natalie Bennett is 'open' to polyamorous marriages and civil partnerships|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/05/01/natalie-bennett-is-open-to-polyamorous-marriages-and-civil-partnerships/|accessdate=20 June 2015|work=PinkNews|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett's announcement aroused media controversy on the topic and led to major international news outlets covering her answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holehouse|first1=Matthew|title=Greens 'open' to three-person marriage, says Natalie Bennett|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11576818/Greens-open-to-three-person-marriage-says-Natalie-Bennett.html|accessdate=20 June 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ashton|first1=Emily|title=The Green Party Is "Open" To Legalising Three-Way Marriages|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilyashton/the-green-party-is-open-to-legalising-three-way-marriages|accessdate=20 June 2015|work=BuzzFeed|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up article written by Barrett was published by PinkNews on May 4, 2015, further exploring the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barrett|first1=Redfern|title=Comment: Why polyamorous marriages are the next step to equality|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/05/04/comment-why-polyamorous-marriages-are-the-next-step-to-equality/|accessdate=20 June 2015|work=PinkNews|date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyamory was the subject of the 2018 [[Louis Theroux]] documentary ''Love Without Limits'', where Theroux travels to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] to meet a number of people engaged in polyamorous relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/nov/04/altered-states-love-without-limits-review-louis-theroux-treads-his-tightrope|title=Altered States: Love Without Limits review – Louis Theroux treads his tightrope|first=Lucy|last=Mangan|date=November 4, 2018|website=the Guardian|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2018, a web series about a black lesbian couple dealing with their relationship being newly polyamorous, called "195 Lewis", received the Breakthrough Series – Short Form award from the [[Gotham Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rachel Montpelier |url=https://womenandhollywood.com/2018-gotham-awards-wins-for-chloe-zhaos-the-rider-killing-eve-elsie-fisher-more/ |title=2018 Gotham Awards: Wins for Chloé Zhao’s “The Rider,” “Killing Eve,” Elsie Fisher, &amp; More |publisher=Women and Hollywood |date= |accessdate=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; That series premiered in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.195lewis.com/events/2017/11/16/195-lewis-online-premiere |title=195 Lewis Online Premiere!! — 195 Lewis |publisher=195lewis.com |date=2017-11-16 |accessdate=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Research into polyamory has been limited. A comprehensive government study of sexual attitudes, behaviors and relationships in [[Finland]] in 1992 (age 18–75, around 50% female and male) found that around 200 out of 2250 (8.9%) respondents "agreed or strongly agreed" with the statement ''"I could maintain several sexual relationships at the same time"'' and 8.2% indicated a relationship type "that best suits" at the present stage of life would involve multiple partners. By contrast, when asked about other relationships at the same time as a steady relationship, around 17% stated they had had other partners while in a steady relationship (50% no, 17% yes, 33% refused to answer).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsd.uta.fi/english/data/catalogue/FSD1243/cbF1243e.pdf Finnish Sex Survey 1992] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

The article,''What Psychology Professionals Should Know About Polyamory'', based on a paper presented at the 8th Annual Diversity Conference in March 1999 in [[Albany, New York]], states the following:

{{quote|While openly polyamorous relationships are relatively rare (Rubin, 1982), there are indications that private polyamorous arrangements within relationships are actually quite common. Blumstein and Schwartz (1983, cited in Rubin &amp; Adams, 1986) noted that of 3,574 married couples in their sample, 15–28% had an understanding that allows nonmonogamy under some circumstances. The percentages are higher among cohabitating couples (28%), lesbian couples (29%) and gay male couples (65%) (p. 312).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polyamory.org/~joe/polypaper.htm#Demographic|title=What Psychology Professionals Should Know About Polyamory|work=polyamory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A study by Moors et al. examined "consensual [[non-monogamy]]" or CNM (which includes polyamory) in the context of [[attachment in adults]], particularly with regards to ''anxiety'' (insecurity about a partner's availability) and ''avoidance'' (discomfort with closeness). The first sample was of exclusively monogamous individuals who were not told the nature of what was being studied, and found that those with greater discomfort with emotional closeness  tended to view CNM more positively as well as being more willing to engage in it (but had not ''actually'' engaged in it). The authors theorized this was "because these relationships promote distance from their partners and support their accepting attitudes toward uncommitted and casual sex". Individuals with high attachment anxiety tended to view CNM negatively, but no correlation was found regarding willingness to engage in it. The second sample was a targeted recruitment of individuals currently engaged in CNM relationships. This sample showed low levels of attachment avoidance, and no correlation related to attachment anxiety. The lack of correlation with anxiety in either sample with regards to willingness or actual engagement suggested it may have little impact on the matter. The large disparity in attachment avoidance between those willing to engage in CNM and those that actually engage in it could not be fully explained within the context of the study, but the authors offer several hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/science-of-polyamory-open-relationships-and-nonmonogamy.html|title=Examining Some Limited Data on Open Relationships|author=Maybe Monogamy by Drake Baer|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also had a few limitations, including that all subjects were heterosexual, the data was anonymous [[Self-report study|self-report]] and the second sample may have suffered from [[social desirability bias]] due to its targeted recruitment.&lt;ref name="MoorsConley2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moors|first1=A.

===In a clinical setting===
In 2002, a paper titled ''Working with polyamorous clients in the clinical setting'' (Davidson)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davidson | first = Joy | title = Working with polyamorous clients in the clinical setting | journal = [[Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality]] | volume = 5 | publisher = [[Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality]] | date = April 16, 2002 | url = http://www.ejhs.org/volume5/polyoutline.html | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Paper delivered to the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality, Western Regional Conference, April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; addressed the following areas of inquiry:

# Why is it important that we talk about alternatives to monogamy now?
# How can therapists prepare to work with people who are exploring polyamory?
# What basic understandings about polyamory are needed?
# What key issues do therapists need to watch for in the course of working with polyamorous clients?

Its conclusions were that "Sweeping changes are occurring in the sexual and relational landscape" (including "dissatisfaction with limitations of serial monogamy, i.e. exchanging one partner for another in the hope of a better outcome"); that clinicians need to start by "recognizing the array of possibilities that 'polyamory' encompasses" and "examine our culturally-based assumption that 'only monogamy is acceptable'" and how this bias impacts on the practice of therapy; the need for self-education about polyamory, basic understandings about the "rewards of the poly lifestyle" and the common social and relationship challenges faced by those involved, and the "shadow side" of polyamory, the potential existing for coercion, strong emotions in opposition, and jealousy.

The paper also states that the configurations a therapist would be "most likely to see in practice" are individuals involved in primary-plus arrangements, monogamous couples wishing to explore non-monogamy for the first time, and "poly singles".

A manual for psychotherapists who deal with polyamorous clients was published in September 2009 by the [[National Coalition for Sexual Freedom]] ''What Psychotherapists Should Know About Polyamory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Weitzman | first1 = Geri | last2 = et al | title = What psychotherapists should know about polyamory | url = https://ncsfreedom.org/images/stories/pdfs/KAP/2010_poly_web.pdf| publisher = [[National Coalition for Sexual Freedom]] | location = Baltimore, Maryland | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.counseling.org/docs%2Fdefault-source%2Fvistas%2Fcounseling-the-polyamorous-client-implications.pdf%3Fsfvrsn%3Dc193a1e7_11&amp;usg=AOvVaw1eU912N8FEmmlEyzzEsv4o|title=Counseling the Polyamorous Client: Implications for Competent Practice|author=Adrianne L. Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Favorable preexisting conditions before nonmonogamy===
Michael Shernoff cites two studies in his report on same-sex couples considering nonmonogamy.&lt;ref name="familyprocess.org"&gt;Cited by Michael Shernoff, ''Family Process'', Vol. 45 No. 4, 2006, in the context of same-sex relationships [http://www.familyprocess.org/Data/featured_articles/65_shernoff.pdf Familyprocess.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429022859/http://www.familyprocess.org/Data/featured_articles/65_shernoff.pdf |date=April 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morin (1999) stated that a couple has a very good chance of adjusting to nonexclusivity if at least some of the following conditions exist:&lt;ref name="familyprocess.org"/&gt;
:* Both partners want their relationship to remain primary.
:* The couple has an established reservoir of good will.
:* There is a minimum of lingering resentments from past hurts and betrayals.
:* The partners are not polarized over monogamy/non-monogamy.
:* The partners are feeling similarly powerful and autonomous.

Green and Mitchell (2002) stated that direct discussion of the following issues can provide the basis for honest and important conversations:&lt;ref name="familyprocess.org"/&gt;
:* Openness versus secrecy
:* Volition and equality versus coercion and inequality
:* Clarity and specificity of agreements versus confusion/vagueness
:* Honoring keeping agreements versus violating them
:* How each partner views non-monogamy.

According to Shernoff,&lt;ref&gt;''Family Process'', Vol. 45 No. 4, 2006, in the context of same-sex relationships [http://www.familyprocess.org/Data/featured_articles/65_shernoff.pdf Familyprocess.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429022859/http://www.familyprocess.org/Data/featured_articles/65_shernoff.pdf |date=April 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; if the matter is discussed with a third party, such as a therapist, the task of the therapist is to "engage couples in conversations that let them decide for themselves whether sexual exclusivity or nonexclusivity is functional or dysfunctional for the relationship."

==Criticism==
Polyamory, along with other forms of consensual non-monogamy, is not without drawbacks.  Morin (1999) and Fleckenstein (2014) noted that certain conditions are favorable to good experiences with polyamory, but that these differ from the general population.&lt;ref name="familyprocess.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleckenstein Cox pp. 94–116"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fleckenstein | first=James R. | last2=Cox | first2=Derrell W. | title=The association of an open relationship orientation with health and happiness in a sample of older US adults | journal=Sexual and Relationship Therapy | publisher=Informa UK Limited | volume=30 | issue=1 | date=2014-11-18 | issn=1468-1994 | doi=10.1080/14681994.2014.976997 | pages=94–116 | quote=Regression analyses suggest that the factors which predict better health and happiness differ between the general population and those who participate in consensually non-exclusive sexual relationships}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heavy public promotion of polyamory can have the unintended effect of attracting people to it for whom it is not well-suited.  Unequal power dynamics, such as financial dependence, can also inappropriately influence a person to agree to a polyamorous relationship against their true desires.   Even in more equal power dynamic relationships, the reluctant partner may feel coerced into a proposed non-monogamous arrangement due to the implication that if they refuse, the proposer will pursue other partners anyway, will break off the relationship, or that the one refusing will be accused of intolerance.&lt;ref name="Sizemore"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sizemore | first=Kayla M. | last2=Olmstead | first2=Spencer B. | title=Willingness of Emerging Adults to Engage in Consensual Non-Monogamy: A Mixed-Methods Analysis | journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=47 | issue=5 | date=2017-10-06 | issn=0004-0002 | doi=10.1007/s10508-017-1075-5 | pages=1423–1438 | quote=   The final reason given by those in the 'Willing' group was that their engagement in CNM would be a sacrifice for their partner or for their relationship. This group of participants indicated that despite their own lack of desire to engage in CNM, they would be willing to try CNM for their partner or their relationship.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawkins"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hawkins |first=Alan J. |authorlink=Alan J. Hawkins |last2=VanDenBerghe |first2=Betsy |url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/12/consensual-non-monogamy-bad-math/ |title=The New Math of ‘Consensual Nonmonogamy’ |work=[[National Review]] |date=2017-12-07 |accessdate=2018-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific studies on polyamory have also not been without bias and methodological issues.  First, a significant number of studies rely on [[Sample size determination|small samples]] that are recruited from referrals, [[snowball sampling]], and websites devoted to polyamory.  Individuals recruited this way tend to be relative homogeneous in terms of values, beliefs and demographics, which limits the generalizability of the findings.&lt;ref name="Rubel Bogaert"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rubel | first=Alicia N. | last2=Bogaert | first2=Anthony F. | title=Consensual Nonmonogamy: Psychological Well-Being and Relationship Quality Correlates | journal=The Journal of Sex Research | publisher=Informa UK Limited | volume=52 | issue=9 | date=2014-09-04 | issn=0022-4499 | doi=10.1080/00224499.2014.942722 | pages=961–982}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These samples also tend to be [[Self-selection bias|self-selecting]] toward individuals with positive experiences, whereas those who found polyamory to be distressing or hurtful might be more reluctant to participate in the research.&lt;ref name="Rubel Bogaert"/&gt;  A second problem is that most of the studies rely entirely on [[self-report study|self-report measures]].  This is problematic because prior research has shown that self-reports of well-being and relationship satisfaction over time are flawed, and are often based on beliefs rather than actual experiences.&lt;ref name="Rubel Bogaert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawkins"/&gt; Self-report measures are also at risk of [[self-enhancement]] bias; subjects may feel pressure to give positive responses about their well-being and relationship satisfaction in the face of [[stereotype threat]].&lt;ref name="Rubel Bogaert"/&gt; This disparity was noted by Moors et al. (2014), who compared respondents expressing interest in consensual non-monogamy drawn from the general population to those drawn from online communities devoted to it.&lt;ref name="MoorsConley2014"/&gt;  In academic works involving volunteer interviews, the participant is almost always a single partner of such relationships or a small group where certain partners are not present, resulting in one-sided views being recorded about the relationship.&lt;ref name="Hawkins"/&gt;

Polyamorous relationships also can have practical pitfalls.  One common complaint from participants is time management, as more partners means one must divide one's time and attention up between them, leaving less for each.&lt;ref name="Hawkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masters"&gt;{{cite book | last=Masters | first=Robert | title=Transformation through intimacy : the journey toward awakened monogamy | publisher=North Atlantic Books | publication-place=Berkeley, Calif | year=2011 | isbn=978-1-58394-388-5 | oclc=793850748 | pages=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Related is that the complexity of the arrangement can lead to so much effort being spent on the relationship that personal, individual needs can be overlooked.&lt;ref name="Brunning 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Brunning | first=Luke | title=The Distinctiveness of Polyamory | journal=Journal of Applied Philosophy | publisher=Wiley | year=2016 | issn=0264-3758 | doi=10.1111/japp.12240 | pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another potential issue is lopsided power dynamics, such as one partner having significantly more resources, being more attractive or being much better at initiating new relationships, making the arrangement clearly more beneficial to that partner than the others.&lt;ref name="Hawkins"/&gt;  The strong emphasis on communication can also unintentionally marginalize partners who are less articulate.&lt;ref name="Brunning 2016"/&gt;  Finally, negotiating the sometimes complex rules and boundaries of these relationships can be emotionally taxing, as can reconciling situations where one partner goes outside those boundaries.&lt;ref name="Brunning 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masters"/&gt;

==Symbols==
[[File:Polyamory.svg|thumb|right|The infinity heart]]

The polyamory pride flag, designed by Jim Evans in 1995, has stripes of blue (representing openness and honesty among all partners), red (representing love and passion), and black (representing solidarity with those who must hide their polyamorous relationships from the outside world). In the center of the flag is a gold Greek lowercase letter 'pi', as the first letter of 'polyamory'.

'''''Practical Ethics''''' (1979; second edition 1993; third edition 2011) is an introduction to [[applied ethics]] by [[bioethics|bioethical]] philosopher [[Peter Singer]]. The book, which has been translated into a number of languages, caused outrage in German-speaking countries.

==Summary==

Singer analyzes, in detail, why and how beings' interests should be weighed. In his view, a being's interests should always be weighed according to that being's concrete properties, and not according to its belonging to some abstract group. Singer studies a number of ethical issues including: [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], ability, species, [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]], [[infanticide]], [[Embryonic stem cell|embryo experimentation]], the moral [[Animal rights|status of animals]], political violence, [[overseas aid]], and whether we have an obligation to assist others. The 1993 second edition adds chapters on [[refugees]], the environment, [[Equal opportunity|equality]] and [[disability]], embryo experimentation, and the treatment of academics in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophyblog.com.au/review-of-practical-ethics-by-peter-singer |title=Review of Practical Ethics by Peter Singer | date = 2006-09-20 |accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521439718 |title=''Practical Ethics'' 2nd edition |accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third edition published in 2011 omits the chapter on refugees, and contains a new chapter on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/knowledge/isbn/item5759355/Practical%20Ethics/?site_locale=en_US |title=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Practical Ethics'' is widely read and was described as "an excellent text for an introductory ethics course" by the philosopher [[John Martin Fischer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=2184936| title=''Practical Ethics'' by Peter Singer | author=Fischer, John Martin | journal=The Philosophical Review | year=1983 | volume=92 | issue=2 | pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[James Rachels]] recommended the book "as an introduction centered on such practical issues as abortion, racism, and so forth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=James Rachels | title=The Elements of Moral Philosophy, Fourth Edition | year=2003 | page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Mylan Engel]] called ''Practical Ethics'' "must reading for anyone interested in living an ethical life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15265161.2011.626728 | title=Review of ''Practical Ethics, 3rd Edition'' by Peter Singer | author=Engel Jr., Mylan | journal=The American Journal of Bioethics | year=2011 | volume=11 | issue=12 | pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''representation term''' is a word, or a combination of words, that semantically represent the data type (value domain) of a data element. A representation term is commonly referred to as a ''class word'' by those familiar with [[data dictionary|data dictionaries]]. ISO/IEC 11179-5:2005 defines ''representation term'' as a ''designation of an instance of a representation class'' As used in [[ISO/IEC 11179]], the representation term is that part of a [[data element name]] that provides a semantic pointer to the underlying data type. A ''[[Representation class]]''  is a class of representations.  This ''representation class'' provides a way to [[Taxonomic classification|classify]] or group [[data element]]s.

A ''Representation Term'' may be thought of as an attribute of a [[data element]] in a [[metadata registry]] that classifies the data element according to the type of data stored in the data element.{{ref|reptermasattr}}

Representation terms are typically "approved" by the organization or standards body using them.  For example, the UN publishes its approved list as part of the UN/CEFACT Core Components Technical Specification. The [[Universal Data Element Framework]] uses a subset of CCTS representation terms and assigns numeric codes to those used.

== Use cases for representation term ==

=== Managing Value Domains ===
A value domain expresses the set of allowed values for a data element.  The representation term (and typically the corresponding data type term) comprise a taxonomy for the value domains within a data set.  This taxonomy is the representation class.   Thus the representation term can be used to control proliferation of value domains by ensuring equivalent value domains use the same representation term.

=== Finding equivalent properties ===
When a person or software agent is analyzing two separate metadata registries to find [[property equivalence]], the Representation Term can be used as a guide.  For example, if system A has a Data Element such as PersonGenderCode and system B has a data element such as PersonSexCode the code suffix might assist the two systems to only match data elements that have the suffix "Code".  However, a taxonomy of property terms (i.e. "Sex" or "Gender") is much more efficient in this respect.

=== Inference ===
The Representation Term can be used in many ways to do inferences on data sets.  Representation Terms tells the observer of any data stream about the data types and gives an indication of how the Data Element can be used.  This is critical when mapping metadata registries to external Data Elements.  For example, if you are sent a record about a person you may look for any "ID" suffix to understand how the remote system may differentiate two distinct records.

=== Required fields ===
Representation Terms are also used to make inferences about the requirements of a property.  For example, if a data stream had Data Element PersonBirthDateAndTime you would know that BOTH the date AND time are available and relevant, not just the date.  If the birth time was optional, a separate data elements should be used such as PersonBirthDate and PersonBirthTime.

=== Finding data warehouse dimensions and measures ===
When creating a data warehouse, a business analyst looks at the Representation Terms to quickly find the dimensions and measures of a subject matter in order to build OLAP cubes.  For example:

# '''Indicator''' or '''Code''' are used to create data warehouse dimensions
# '''Date''' or '''DateTime''' are used to relate to the time dimension, which are frequently shared between cubes using conformed dimensions
# '''Amount''', '''Number''', '''Measure''' or '''Value''' terms (which can be added together) are candidates for a measurement
# '''Name''' and '''Text''' are used for screen labels or other descriptive elements
# '''Percent''' needs to be analyzed since they can't really be added together with clear meaning
# '''ID''' is used to remove duplicate records

=== Core Components Technical Specification===
The joint ISO/UN Core Components Technical Specification formally define both the allowed set of representation terms and the corresponding set of data types. ISO 15000-5 is an implementation layer of ISO 11179 and normatively expresses a set of rules to semantically define conceptual and physical/logical data models for a wide variety of uses.  In ISO 15000-5, the representation term provides a mechanism to harmonize the value domains of candidate data elements before being added to the overall data model(s).  ISO 15000-5 is being used by a number of government, standards development organizations, and private sector as the basis for data modeling.

=== Universal Data Element Framework ===
Some informal standards such as the [[Universal Data Element Framework]] (which refer to a Representation Term as a "Property Word") assign unique integer IDs to each Representation Term.  This allows metadata mapping tools to map one set of data elements into other metadata vocabularies.  An example of these mappings can be found at [[Property word ID]].  Note that as of November 2005 the UDEF concepts have not been widely adopted.

== Example of representation terms as an XML suffix ==
For example, if an XML Data fragment had the following:

 &lt;Person&gt;
  &lt;PersonID&gt;'''123-45-6789'''&lt;/PersonID&gt;
  &lt;PersonGivenName&gt;'''John'''&lt;/PersonGivenName&gt;
  &lt;PersonFamilyName&gt;'''Smith'''&lt;/PersonFamilyName&gt;
  &lt;PersonBirthDate&gt;'''1990-08-14'''&lt;/PersonBirthDate&gt;
 &lt;/Person&gt;

In the example above, the Representation terms are "ID" for the &lt;PersonID&gt;, the suffix "Name" for the Given and Family names, and "Date" for the &lt;PersonBirthDate&gt;.

== Sample representation terms ==
The following are samples of Representation Terms that have been used for the exchange of electronic messages in systems such as [[NIEM]] or [[GJXDM]] 3.0: [note: the restrictions expressed here are limited to those specifications and do not represent universal consensus]

== Pros of representation terms ==
* Use of representation terms in a data element name is a convention that is widely adopted by several large systems such as [[NIEM]], [[GJXDM]] and [[ebXML]].
* Many data architects that are responsible for mapping XML from foreign sources find Representation terms very useful.
* Standards such as the [[UDEF]] depend on accurate coding of Representation Terms.
* Tools that validate against enumeration lists can distinguish coded values quickly by looking for the "Code" suffix.
* [[Dimensional analysis]] of data can use representation terms for creating data warehouses.  Representation terms such as Code and Indicator can be converted into dimensions and Amounts and Measures can be converted to measures in a fact table.

== Cons of representation terms ==
* No universal agreement exists as to the definitive set of representation terms. 
* There is not always a direct relationship between a representation term and the value domain it represents.  This is caused by further qualifying the corresponding data type term.

== Standards that use Representation Terms ==

* [[ebXML|Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language]]
* The US Government's [[National Information Exchange Model]] requires the use of representation terms for XML data elements.
* The US Department of Justice data exchange standards [[Global Justice XML Data Model]] required the use of representation terms for XML data elements.
[Note] This is an extremely limited set of the wide range of standards that specify the use of representation terms.

While waiting to go into prison for sponsoring an anti-war pamphlet in 1916, [[Bertrand Russell]] gave his [[Logical atomism|''Lectures on Logical Atomism'']] in the hall where the Institute's annual lecture series are now held. He finished them just before he was incarcerated. The Home Secretary, [[Arthur Balfour|Lord Balfour]], gave the extraordinary instruction that the prisoner should be allowed writing materials in this cell, in which he produced his ''[[Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy]]'', published in 1919. Russell, together with Balfour, [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse|L. T. Hobhouse]], [[Samuel Alexander]], [[Harold Laski]], and the Institute's Journal's first editor, Sydney Hooper, founded the Institute, originally known as the British Institute of Philosophical Studies, in 1925.

The first President of the Institute was Lord Balfour, succeeded in 1930 by [[Edwin Samuel, 2nd Viscount Samuel|Lord Samuel]], in 1959 by [[Lord Halsbury]], in 1991 by [[Anthony Quinton]], and in 2006 by Sir [[Anthony Kenny]]. Sir Anthony, the current President, has been  Master of [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford]] and President of the [[British Academy]]. He is author of many philosophical books and articles, and he gave the Institute’s Annual Lecture in 2007. Sir [[W. D. Ross|David Ross]] was for many years Chairman of Council, and Professor [[Hywel Lewis]] for many years after him.  He was succeeded by the then Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of London]],  [[Stewart Sutherland, Baron Sutherland of Houndwood]].  After almost 20 years of service to the Institute, Lord Sutherland was succeeded by Professor [[Ted Honderich]], Emeritus Grote Professor of Mind and Logic at [[University College London]]

Professor [[H. B. Acton]], Director of the Institute while Professor at [[Bedford College, London]], who is commemorated by occasional special lectures, was succeeded by Professor [[Godfrey Vesey]], the founding Professor of Philosophy of the [[Open University]]. On his retirement after 13 years as Director he was appointed Fellow of the Institute in 1979. Professor [[Anthony O'Hear]] of the [[University of Bradford]] has been Director since the session 1994-95. The Institute's title of '''Royal''' was granted in 1947. The secretary to the society {{As of|2014|lc=y}} was [[James Garvey (philosopher)|James Garvey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalinstitutephilosophy.org/page/45 ''People''], The Royal Institute of Philosophy, 2012.

{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2013}}
&lt;!-- Please don't add a complete list of the Rules of Acquisition, from any source.  This is a violation of Paramount's copyright.  Thanks. --&gt;

In the [[fiction]]al ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, the '''Rules of Acquisition''' are a collection of sacred business proverbs of the ultra-[[greed]]y race known as the [[Ferengi]].

The first mention of the rules within the ''Star Trek'' universe was in "[[The Nagus]]", an episode of the TV series ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' (Season 1, Episode 10). In a later ''Deep Space Nine'' episode, "[[The Maquis (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Maquis: Part 1]]", Sakonna (a [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]]) asks [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]] (a Ferengi) to explain what a Rule of Acquisition is. He states, "Every Ferengi business transaction is governed by 285 Rules of Acquisition to ensure a fair and honest deal for all parties concerned... well most of them anyway."&lt;ref name= Maquis1&gt;{{Cite episode

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The first Rule was made by Gint, the first [[Grand Nagus]] of the [[Ferengi Alliance]], a role with political, economic, and even quasi-religious duties. The Rules were said to be [[revelation|divinely inspired]] and sacred (thus furthering the original marketing ploy.)&lt;ref name= "Religions of Star Trek"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; not all of them have been stated in [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]. Most of the Rules were written by [[Ira Steven Behr]], a writer for ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'', in a book ''The Ferengi Rules of Acquisition'' ({{ISBN|0-671-52936-6}}). The book's cover credits authorship as being "By Quark as told to Ira Steven Behr." Additional rules were published in ''Legends of the Ferengi'' ({{ISBN|0-671-00728-9}}) by Behr and [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]], another writer for ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' when Behr was the [[executive producer]] of the series.&lt;ref name="Adventures in"&gt;{{Cite book

 |publisher=Simon and Schuster
 | isbn= 9780743455930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' episode "[[False Profits]]" mentions a book containing all of the Rules: 
{{quote|Unabridged and fully annotated with all 47 commentaries, all 900 major and minor judgments, all 10,000 considered opinions. There's a rule for every conceivable situation." There is also a note about '''The Unwritten Rule''':  "When no appropriate rule applies... make one up."&lt;ref name= False&gt;{{Cite episode
 | series = [[Star Trek: Voyager]] |title= [[False Profits]]
 | type = Television production
 | season= 3| number= 5
 | time = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also in "False Profits", [[Neelix]] (a [[Talaxian]]) states that there are 299 Rules of Acquisition. This is a ploy to confuse the Ferengi who have been trapped on the [[Tarkarian]] homeworld. When challenged, Neelix states that while the Ferengi have been away, additional Rules had been created.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2573">'''Self-verifying theories''' are consistent [[first-order logic|first-order]] systems of [[arithmetic]] much weaker than [[Peano arithmetic]] that are capable of proving their own [[consistency proof|consistency]]. [[Dan Willard]] was the first to investigate their properties, and he has described a family of such systems.  According to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]], these systems cannot contain the theory of Peano arithmetic, and in fact, not even its weak fragment ''[[Robinson arithmetic]]''; nonetheless, they can contain strong theorems.

In outline, the key to Willard's construction of his system is to formalise enough of the [[Gödel]] machinery to talk about [[Proof theory|provability]] internally without being able to formalise [[Diagonal lemma|diagonalisation]]. Diagonalisation depends upon being able to prove that multiplication is a total function (and in the earlier versions of the result, addition also). Addition and multiplication are not function symbols of Willard's language; instead, subtraction and division are, with the addition and multiplication predicates being defined in terms of these.  Here, one cannot prove the [[arithmetical hierarchy|&lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_2&lt;/math&gt; sentence]] expressing totality of multiplication:

:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x,y)\ (\exists z)\ {\rm multiply}(x,y,z).&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\rm multiply}&lt;/math&gt; is the three-place predicate which stands for &lt;math&gt;z/y=x&lt;/math&gt;.
When the operations are expressed in this way, provability of a given sentence can be encoded as an arithmetic sentence describing termination of an [[analytic tableau]]. Provability of consistency can then simply be added as an axiom. The resulting system can be proven consistent by means of a [[relative consistency]] argument with respect to ordinary arithmetic.

We can add any true &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_1&lt;/math&gt; sentence of arithmetic to the theory and still remain consistent.

{{Japanese name|Kuki}}

{{nihongo|'''Shūzō Kuki'''|九鬼 周造|''Kuki Shūzō''|February 15, 1888 – May 6, 1941}} was a prominent [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[academic]], [[philosopher]] and university professor.

==Early life==
Kuki was the fourth child of Baron [[Kuki Ryūichi]] (九鬼 隆一) a high bureaucrat in the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] Ministry for Culture and Education ([[Monbushō]]). Since it appears that Kuki's mother, Hatsu, was already pregnant when she fell in love with [[Okakura Kakuzō]] (岡倉 覚三), otherwise known as [[Okakura Tenshin]] (岡倉 天心), a protégé of her husband's (a notable patron of the arts), the rumour that Okakura was Kuki's father would appear to be groundless. It is true, however, that Shūzō as a child, after his mother had separated and then divorced his father, thought of Okakura, who often visited, as his real father, and later certainly hailed him as his spiritual father. From Okakura, he gained much of his fascination for [[aesthetics]] and perhaps foreign languages, as indeed his fascination with the peculiar cultural codes of the pleasure quarters of Japan owes something to the fact that his mother had once been a [[geisha]].

At age 23 in 1911 (Meiji 44), Kuki converted to [[Catholicism]]; and he was baptized in Tokyo as Franciscus Assisiensis Kuki Shūzō. The idealism and introspection implied by this decision were early evidence of issues which would have resonance in the characteristic mindset of the mature man.&lt;ref&gt;Nara, Hiroshi. (2004). ''The Structure of Detachment: the Aesthetic Vision of Kuki Shūzō&lt;!--Do not change order! Title of book--&gt; with a translation of "Iki no kōzō,"'' pp. 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

A graduate in philosophy of [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]], Kuki spent eight years in Europe to polish his knowledge of languages and deepen his already significant studies of contemporary Western thought. At the [[University of Heidelberg]], he studied under the neo-Kantian [[Heinrich Rickert]], and he engaged [[Eugen Herrigel]] as a tutor.&lt;ref&gt;Nara, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the [[University of Paris]], he was impressed by the work of [[Henri Bergson]], whom he came to know personally; and he engaged the young [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] as a French tutor.&lt;ref name="n173"&gt;Nara, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is little known outside Japan that Kuki influenced [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] to develop an interest in Heidegger's philosophy.&lt;ref name="parkes158"&gt;Parkes, Graham. (1990). [https://books.google.com/books?id=bUa8ctgqeC8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA158,M1  ''Heidegger and Asian Thought,'' p. 158.]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[University of Freiburg]], Kuki studied [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] under [[Edmund Husserl]]; and he first met [[Martin Heidegger]] in Husserl's home. He moved to the [[University of Marburg]] for Heidegger's lectures on phenomenological interpretation of Kant, and for Heidegger's seminar "Schelling's Essay on the Essence of Human Freedom."&lt;ref name="n173" /&gt; Fellow students during these years in Europe were [[Tetsurō Watsuji]] and [[Kiyoshi Miki]].

==Career==
Shortly after Kuki's return to Japan, he wrote and published his masterpiece, ''[[The Structure of Iki|The Structure of "Iki"]]'' (1930). In this work he undertakes to make a phenomenological analysis of ''[[iki (aesthetics)|iki]]'', a variety of chic culture current among the fashionable set in [[Edo]] in the [[Tokugawa period]], and asserted that it constituted one of the essential values of Japanese culture.

Kuki took up a teaching post at [[Kyoto University]], then a prominent center for conservative cultural values and thinking. His early lectures focused on [[Descartes]] and Bergson. In the context of a faculty with a primarily Germanic philiosophical background, his lectures offered a somewhat different perspective based on the work of French philosophers.

He became an Associate Professor in 1933 (''Shōwa'' 8); and in that same year, he published the first book length study of [[Martin Heidegger]] to appear in Japanese.&lt;ref name="nara174"&gt;Nara, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, it is noteworthy that the German philosopher explicitly referenced a conversation "between a Japanese and an inquirer" &lt;ref&gt;''Zwischen einem Japaner und einem Fragendenin''&lt;/ref&gt; in ''On the Way to Language'' (''Aus einem Gespräch von der Sprache'').&lt;ref&gt;Marra, Michael F. (2002). {{google books|VCcLEBldTagC|''Japanese hermeneutics,'' pp. 89-202.|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Heidegger expressed a desire to have written the preface to the German translation of ''The Structure of "Iki"''&lt;ref&gt;Light, Stephen. (1987). ''Kuki Shūzō and Jean-Paul Sartre,'' p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the University of Kyoto, Kuki was elevated to Professor of Philosophy in March 1934 (''Shōwa'' 10).&lt;ref name="nara174"/&gt;  The next year, he published ''The Problem of Contingency'', also known as ''The Problem of the Accidental.''&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Kuki Shūzō" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 571|page=571}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This work was developed from his personal experiences in Europe and the influences of Heidegger. As a single Japanese man within an encompassing "white" or non-Japanese society, he considered the extent to which he became a [[contingency (philosophy)|being who lacked necessity]].&lt;ref name="parkes158"/&gt;  His Kyoto University lectures on Heidegger, ''Man and Existence'', were published in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Nara, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-thirties, while Japan drifted towards totalitarianism and the war in China dragged on, Kuki seemed not to be much disturbed by the growth of fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Nara, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Kuki died prematurely from consequences following an attack of [[peritonitis]].&lt;ref&gt;Nara, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Social and Environmental Responsibility World Forum''' is an initiative organized by the Réseau Alliances in 1993 in partnership with private and [[public organization]]s, to encourage [[social responsibility|social]] and economic responsibility among [[business]]es.

The initiative was planned for four years (2007–2010), with the goal of creating a permanent cycle of continuous exchanges and communication between actors from all parts of the world.

The work of the Forum was based on concrete projects and actions to formulate to generalize social and environmental responsibility throughout the world. During that period, major events were supposed to take place in [[Lille]] to bring together actors and experts in social and environmental responsibility of all nationalities, especially during the international meetings scheduled in October each year.

Developed on economic leaders’ initiative&lt;!-- like who? --&gt;, the ''Réseau Alliances'' federates and helps businesses anxious to improve their performance while being more respectful of people and the environment.

==Topics discussed==
* A socially and environmentally responsible [[economy]] opened to the diversity of cultures and origins
* [[Multiculturalism|Diversity]] and [[equal opportunity]]
* The place and role of the world's women at all levels of responsibility
* Equal opportunities and territories: the conditions for fairer [[economic development]]
* Identifying, evaluating, and developing good practices in the company
* What it is about social and environmental responsibility

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4095">The '''stability–instability paradox''' is an [[international relations theory]] regarding the effect of [[nuclear weapons]] and [[mutually assured destruction]]. It states that when two countries each have nuclear weapons, the probability of a direct war between them greatly decreases, but the probability of minor or indirect conflicts between them increases. This occurs because rational actors want to avoid nuclear wars, and thus they neither start major conflicts nor allow minor conflicts to escalate into major conflicts—thus making it safe to engage in minor conflicts. For instance, during the [[Cold War]] the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] never engaged each other in warfare, but fought [[proxy wars]] in [[Korean War|Korea]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], [[Angolan Civil War|Angola]], the [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Middle East]], [[Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaragua]] and [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and spent substantial amounts of money and manpower on gaining relative influence over the [[third world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last=Krepon |first=Michael |title=The Stability-Instability Paradox, Misperception, and Escalation Control in South Asia |accessdate=12 August 2017 |publisher=The Henry Stimson Center |url=https://www.stimson.org/sites/default/files/file-attachments/stability-instability-paradox-south-asia.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812115507/https://www.stimson.org/sites/default/files/file-attachments/stability-instability-paradox-south-asia.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in the ''[[Journal of Conflict Resolution]]'' in 2009 quantitatively evaluated the nuclear peace hypothesis, and found support for the existence of the stability–instability paradox. The study determined that while nuclear weapons promote strategic stability, and prevent large scale wars, they simultaneously allow for more lower intensity conflicts. When a nuclear monopoly exists between two states, and their opponent does not, there is a greater chance of war. In contrast, when there is mutual nuclear weapon ownership with both states possessing nuclear weapons, the odds of war drop precipitously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evaluating the Nuclear Peace Hypothesis - A Quantitative Approach |first=Robert |last=Rauchhaus |doi=10.1177/0022002708330387 |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |year=2009 |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=258–277 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect can be seen in the [[India–Pakistan relations|India–Pakistan relationship]]&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Watterson 2017, 'Competing interpretations of the stability–instability paradox: the case of the Kargil War', The Nonproliferation Review, 24(1-2), 83-99, https://doi.org/10.1080/10736700.2017.1366623&lt;/ref&gt; and to some degree in [[Russia–NATO relations]].

==Assumptions==

One of the major assumptions in the concept of mutually assured destruction and the stability-instability phenomenon as its consequence is that all actors are rational and that this rationality implies an avoidance of complete destruction. Particularly the second part of the assumption might not necessarily be given in real-world politics. When imagining a [[theocracy|theocratic]] nation whose leaders believe in the existence of an afterlife which they assume to be sufficiently better than our current life, it becomes rational for them to do everything in their power to facilitate a swift transition for as many people as possible into that afterlife. This connection between certain religious beliefs and politics of weapons of mass destruction has been pointed out by some atheists in order to point out perceived dangers of theocratic societies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Sam|title=The end of faith : Religion, terror, and the future of reason|date=2005|publisher=W.

'''The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees''' ('''Lexington Principles''') is a body of international '''[[due process]]''' principles that reflect the prevailing transnational norms in the area of detainee treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.wlu.edu/lexingtonprinciples |title=The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees :: The Lexington Principles Project :: W&amp;L Law School |publisher=Law.wlu.edu |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Lexington Principles''' were completed and published on April 1, 2009. The instrument consists of 45 principles and countless annotations prepared by the project's law student editorial board. A primary purpose of the drafters of the Lexington Principles was to assist the jurisprudential evolution of American constitutional due process standards after the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]''. While each Principle is based on '''[[international law]]''', all provisions have been drafted to facilitate vertical norm internalization into the domestic legal system of the '''[[United States]]''' and other '''[[common law]]''' countries.

==History==

===Mission of the Lexington Principles Project===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The mission of the Lexington Principles Project is to engage the international community to clarify and strengthen transnational norms pertaining to due process of law and the treatment of persons detained on suspicion of terrorist activities, and to foster a common approach to these matters, in keeping with the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission on this subject.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lexington Principles Website, Mission Statement|url=http://law.wlu.edu/lexingtonprinciples/page.asp?pageid=760|publisher=Law.wlu.edu|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The 9/11 Commission===
{{main|9/11 Commission}}
On July 22, 2004, the '''[[9/11 Commission]]''' issued its [[9/11 Commission Report|report]] on the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In this report, the Commission made numerous recommendations to U.S. government officials on how to better defend the United States against the spread of [[international terrorism]]. In reference to detainee treatment standards, the Commission recommended that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"(t)he United States should engage its friends to develop a common coalition approach toward the detention and humane treatment of captured terrorists. New principles might draw upon Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions on the law of armed conflict. That article was specifically designed for those cases in which the usual laws of war did not apply. Its minimum standards are generally accepted throughout the world as customary international law.".&lt;ref&gt;The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Ch 12 p 380&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[White House]] responded to the 9-11 Commission's recommendation with the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The United States has worked closely with its coalition partners regarding the detention and treatment of captured terrorists, and is open to exploring whether a "common coalition approach" is feasible and consistent with our national security.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House Press Release, Bush Administration Actions Consistent with 9/11 Recommendations|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/07/20040730-18.html|publisher=Whitehouse.gov|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Seventeen months later the 9/11 Commission met again to grade the government's progress on implementing each of the 41 recommendations detailed in its Report. The Commission gave an "F" to the Commission's recommendation regarding "Coalition Standards for Terrorist Detention.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report on 9/11 Commission Recommendations, 1-Page Grade Sheet|date=December 5, 2005|url=http://www.9-11pdp.org/press/2005-12-05_summary.pdf|publisher=9-11pdp.org|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To explain its issuance of a failing grade with respect to the government's compliance with this recommendation, the Commission stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The U.S. has not engaged in a common coalition approach to developing standards for detention and prosecution of captured terrorists. Indeed, U.S. treatment of detainees has elicited broad criticism, and makes it harder to build the necessary alliances to cooperate effectively with partners in a global war on terror.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report on 9/11 Commission Recommendations, Page 7|date=December 5, 2005|url=http://www.9-11pdp.org/press/2005-12-05_report.pdf|publisher=9-11pdp.org|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Washington and Lee University===
Several professors and alumni at '''[[Washington and Lee University]]''' sought to assist the process of implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendation by initiating a scholarly dialogue between military practitioners and legal experts aimed at identifying the high end of prevailing transnational norms pertaining to detainee treatment. They created '''The Lexington Principles Project''' and began the lengthy process of research and analysis that culminated in the publication of the '''Draft Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees''' on September 25, 2008. These draft principles were approved and published in final form on April 1, 2009 along with student-edited annotations.

==Methodology==

===Codifying the Gold Standard in Transnational Detainee Treatment Standards===
The Lexington Principles Project's participants did not want simply to restate existing international norms. Many groups had already aptly performed that function and such an effort would have been redundant, and possibly even counterproductive to developing a universal approach to detainee treatment. The Lexington Principles Project therefore aimed to develop a progressive set of principles recognizing the highest standards set forth in international law and the domestic legal systems of foreign nations.

===Transnational Legal Process Approach===
To overcome the difficulties inherent in applying international law in domestic courts, the Lexington Principles Project structured its efforts in accordance with the theory of [[Transnational Legal Process]] developed by '''[[Harold Hongju Koh]]''', the Dean of '''[[Yale Law School]]'''. The Project's use of this approach was facilitated by the availability of the considerable transnational law resources of the '''[[Transnational Law Institute]]''' at '''[[Washington and Lee University School of Law]]'''.

===Due Process Paradigm===
The Transnational Legal Process approach required the group to focus on vertical process throughout all stages of norm definition. The result was the creation of an innovative conceptual framework based on the familiar common law due process paradigm. Accordingly, the bulk of detainee rights under international law are categorized into one of three groups:

# General Provisions
# Procedural Due Process
# Substantive Due Process

===Normative Translation===
The term "due process" is unique to common law legal systems, and is not generally found in the text of international human rights and humanitarian law treaties. Due process is a powerful concept at common law, so it was important for the Lexington Principles to be phrased in those terms. All of the transnational norms discovered during the lengthy research phase of the Lexington Principles Project needed to be translated into aspects of due process. This was accomplished by distilling all points of mutuality in the law governing detainee treatment under both international law and domestic U.S. law down to one central right: the right to physical liberty. Principle 1 of the Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees codified this right, and all other rights were drafted as essentially derivative of this central guarantee. 

'''Principle 1''' states, "Physical liberty is a fundamental human right and may not be denied to any person without due process of law.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principle 1, The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees (Draft Principles, September 25, 2008)|url=http://law.wlu.edu/lexingtonprinciples/page.asp?pageid=769|publisher=Law.wlu.edu|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transnational Incorporation Doctrine===
The '''[[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|Transnational Incorporation Doctrine]]''', first developed for the Lexington Principles, asserts that there are some principles of international law that are so fundamental to accepted global standards of justice that they should be implied as part the right to '''[[due process of law]]''' under the '''[[Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]'''. This is a new progressive theory that has yet to be adopted by the '''[[United States Supreme Court]]'''. The theory was constructed by the professors drafting the Lexington Principles as a means of offering modern judges a jurisprudential concept that could afford them the opportunity to recognize a host of modern human rights that have developed in legal systems around the world since the American Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791. This conceptual mechanism for transnational norm internalization, if adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court, would give progressive American judges the opportunity to protect individual liberty by incorporating into the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause a variety of new and emerging human rights protections that pertain to modern American life in the Information Age. Liberty rights associated with privacy and personal autonomy in cyberspace were inconceivable in 1791 during the drafting of the original Bill of Rights. The Transnational Incorporation Doctrine would provide a way for courts to modernize the rights all American citizens enjoy vis-a-vis their government without the need to amend the Constitution through the cumbersome process prescribed in Article V. The formal amendment process makes meaningful change practically impossible to achieve, which is why the Lexington Principles Project crafted this new mechanism to facilitate bringing Americans rights up to the highest transnational standards.

===Moving Beyond Nationality and Territoriality===
A significant ancillary consequence of the novel and still unadopted Transnational Incorporation Doctrine would be its effect on the rights afforded to non-United States persons under U.S. law. Presently, United States citizens and permanent residents are afforded full protection under the United States Constitution both at home and abroad, with limited exceptions. Persons who are not American citizens or permanent residents are afforded no protection under the U.S. Constitution outside of U.S. borders and substantially diminished rights while on U.S. soil. The Transnational Incorporation Doctrine, if adopted, would change the American understanding of Constitutional rights making them "human" rights rather than rights tied to nationality or territorial location. 

Support for this result comes from the emerging transnational trend toward '''[[universal jurisdiction|universality]]''' of [[international human rights law]]. Because international human rights are universal, the Transnational Incorporation Doctrine's new interpretation of the Fifth Amendment's '''[[Due Process Clause]]''' could result in universal application of all incorporated rights regardless of nationality or physical location. With respect to these newly domesticated transnational rights, former barriers to rights recognition based on [[nationality]] and [[territoriality]] would no longer affect applicability. Any rights incorporated through the Transnational Incorporation Doctrine would likely have to be universally afforded to all human beings by the '''[[U.S. government]]'''. 

These new transnational rights likely would not be nearly as extensive as those offered to U.S. citizens in the United States, but at a minimum they would ensure that the most fundamental due process rights are always afforded in all instances where a human being is detained by the U.S. government for any reason anywhere in the world.

==The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees (April 1, 2009)==
[[File:The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees.pdf|thumb|The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees]]

===I. Part I: General Provisions===

====A. Section A: Fundamental Right to Physical Liberty and Due Process of Law====

=====1. Principle 1: Right to Physical Liberty and Due Process of Law=====
Physical liberty is a fundamental human right and may not be denied to any person without due process of law.

====B. Section B: Scope of Application====

=====2. Principle 2: General Statement of Universal Applicability=====
The fundamental protections inherent in the right to due process of law are universal and apply in all situations where a person has been detained by a State or its agents regardless of the reasons for, or circumstances surrounding, the detention.

=====3. Principle 3: Irrelevance of Geography=====
The fundamental protections inherent in the right to due process of law are universal and should be afforded to all persons detained by a State or its agents without regard to the location of capture or detention.

=====4. Principle 4: Nondiscrimination=====
The fundamental protections inherent in the right to due process of law are universal and should be afforded to all persons detained by a State or its agents without regard to nationality, national origin, ethnic origin, race, color, descent, language, religion, faith, sex, age, birth, parentage, wealth, or any other such criteria.

====C. Section C: State Responsibility====

=====5. Principle 5: General Statement of State Responsibility to Protect=====
Each State has the responsibility to protect the right to physical liberty for all persons within its territory or otherwise under its control except insofar as they are properly detained in accordance with Principle 1.

=====6. Principle 6: Commencement of State Responsibility to Protect=====
At a minimum, a State's responsibility to protect the due process rights of a person begins at the moment the person is detained by its agents.

=====7. Principle 7: Duration of State Responsibility to Protect=====
Once initiated, a State's responsibility to protect the due process rights of a person continues until that individuals physical liberty is ultimately restored.

=====8. Principle 8: State Responsibility to Protect upon Transfer=====
Transfer of a Person to the custody of another State does not terminate the transferring States responsibility to protect the rights of the transferee. The transferring State should maintain an active interest in the rights of the transferee and seek periodic assurances that due process rights are continuously afforded until the transferees physical liberty is ultimately restored.

====D. Section D: International Obligation====

=====9. Principle 9: Statement of Universal Concern=====
A State's compliance with its responsibility to protect the fundamental rights of persons it deprives of physical liberty is a concern of humankind and therefore should be of interest to all members of the international community.

====E. Section E: Relationship to Other Laws====

=====10. Principle 10: Rules of Construction=====
These Principles should not be construed to diminish any human right or protection afforded by any other source of law.

===II. Part II: Procedural Due Process===

====A. Section A: General Statement of Procedural Rights====

=====11. Principle 11: Right to Procedural Due Process=====
Procedural due process is a human right requiring that all persons be afforded notice of, and an opportunity to challenge, any State action substantially affecting their fundamental right to physical liberty in a fair and public hearing before an impartial adjudicator with the independent authority to remedy violations through direct action and without undue restrictions.

=====12. Principle 12: Prohibition of Extralegal Arrest and Detention=====
Due process requires that no deprivation of liberty occur outside of a legal process designed and equipped to assess the legality of the deprivation before, after, and during the period of detention.

=====13. Principle 13: Prohibition of Extralegal Rendition=====
No State should subject any person to nonconsensual transfer from one national jurisdiction to another unless such transfer is performed pursuant to judicial process.

====B. Section B: Notice====

=====14. Principle 14: Notice of Reasons for Deprivation and Procedural Rights=====
When a State substantially impairs the right to physical liberty of any person it should provide that person with effective written notice of the reasons for the impairment and the procedural mechanisms through which the person may challenge the deprivation.

=====15. Principle 15: Sufficiency of Notice=====
The required notice should be sufficient to inform the person of the laws authorizing the impairment and the nature of the evidence justifying its use in the specific case, described with sufficient particularity to allow the person to evaluate the factual and legal basis for the deprivation. If full disclosure of the evidence underlying the factual basis for the detention would result in a substantial risk of harm to individuals or national security, the detainee may be informed of the general nature of the States justification for the detention sufficient to allow the detainee to communicate relevant information to the detaining authorities which might assist them in determining whether continued detention is justified.

====C. Section C: Opportunity to be Heard====

=====16. Principle 16: Right to Challenge Substantial Deprivations=====
All persons should have the right to challenge any substantial State deprivations of their right to physical liberty before a fair and impartial decision maker with the authority to remedy undue infringements without unnecessary delay.

=====17. Principle 17: Right to Presumption of Innocence in Criminal Hearings=====
All persons charged with a criminal offense should be presumed innocent until proven guilty through an adjudicative process conducted in accordance with the requirements of due process.

=====18. Principle 18: Right to Participate in Legal Process=====
All persons should be afforded the opportunity to participate in legal proceedings adjudicating matters directly affecting their right to physical liberty.

=====19. Principle 19: Right to Counsel=====
All persons should be afforded the opportunity to consult legal counsel before and during legal proceedings adjudicating matters pertaining to substantial deprivations of their right to physical liberty.

====D. Section D: Fair and Impartial Decision Maker====

=====20. Principle 20: Composition of Adjudicative Mechanism=====
Decision makers charged with adjudicating matters affecting a person's fundamental rights should be impartial and adequately educated to properly perform that function.

=====21. Principle 21: Right of Adjudicators to Report Suspected Abuses=====
Adjudicators should have the means to report their concerns regarding suspected rights violations to appropriate authorities outside of the control of the governmental entity suspected of committing the violations.

===III. Part III: Substantive Due Process===

====A. Section A: General Statement of Substantive Rights====

=====22. Principle 22: Right to Substantive Due Process=====
Implicit in the fundamental right to due process of law is the requirement that no State should deprive any person of life, liberty, or security of person in violation of any right fundamental to accepted principles of global justice.

====B. Section B: Prohibition of Arbitrary Deprivations of Physical Liberty====

=====23. Principle 23: Prohibition of Arbitrary Arrest and Detention=====
No State should arrest or detain any person for reasons that are arbitrary. An arrest or detention is arbitrary if it is not performed pursuant to law or if it is incompatible with the fundamental principles of global justice.

=====24. Principle 24: Right to the Rule of Law=====
No person should be deprived of the right to physical liberty except pursuant to the rule of law. State actors should never deprive any person of physical liberty except pursuant to specific and demonstrable legal authority governed by written laws and procedures.

=====25. Principle 25: Prohibition of Detention Based on the Exercise of Fundamental Rights=====
No State should detain any person based solely on that persons exercise of a fundamental human right.

=====26. Principle 26: Prohibition of Detention Based on Discriminatory Animus=====
No State should detain any person based solely on that persons nationality, national origin, ethnic origin, race, color, descent, language, religion, faith, sex, age, birth, parentage, wealth, or any similar criteria.

=====27. Principle 27: Prohibition of Ex Post Facto Application of Penal Law=====
No State should try any person for a penal offense based on acts or omissions which did not constitute a penal offense at the time they were committed.

=====28. Principle 28: Prohibition of Double Jeopardy=====
No State should detain, try, or punish any person for an offence for which the person has already been finally convicted or acquitted.

=====29. Principle 29: Prohibition of Deprivations Based on the Actions of Third Parties=====
No State should deprive any person of liberty based solely on the alleged or actual wrongdoing of a third party.

=====30. Principle 30: Prohibition of Indefinite Non-Punitive Detention=====
Extrajudicial detention beyond the time necessary to serve a compelling and current state objective is inconsistent with the principles of due process. No State should detain any person outside the judicial process unless such detention is conducted in accordance with substantial procedural safeguards narrowly tailored to ensure the detention is strictly limited to the time necessary to serve a compelling and current state objective.

=====31. Principle 31: Right to Repatriation Following Detention=====
All persons should be afforded the right to return to their country of nationality or citizenship upon the cessation of detention by a foreign State.

====C. Section C: Prohibition of Incommunicado Detention====

=====32. Principle 32: Prohibition of Incommunicado Detention=====
Prolonged incommunicado detention is incompatible with the substantive liberty guarantees inherent in the fundamental right to due process of law.

=====33. Principle 33: Right to Communicate with Relatives=====
Persons subjected to prolonged detention should be allowed to communicate with their family at regular intervals, subject to the supervision of the detaining authorities, unless the State demonstrates that the denial of such communication is necessary based on a demonstrable risk to national security or the safety of any person.

=====34. Principle 34: Right to Communicate with Diplomatic or Consular Representatives=====
All persons deprived of their liberty by the government of a foreign State should be allowed reasonable opportunities to communicate with the diplomatic or consular representatives of their home State as soon as practicable after the deprivation and periodically throughout the period of detention as needed to ensure they are afforded the full benefits of the protections guaranteed to foreign nationals under international law.

All persons who are refugees, stateless persons, or nationals of States without diplomatic or consular representation in the detaining State should be allowed reasonable opportunities to communicate with the diplomatic and consular representatives of the State which takes charge of their interests or any national or international authority whose task it is to protect such persons.

=====35. Principle 35: Right to Unmonitored Communication with Physicians=====
All persons subjected to prolonged deprivations of liberty should be afforded the right to periodic unmonitored communications with the physicians charged with providing their medical care in order to allow the disclosure of allegations of abuse by the detaining authorities.

=====36. Principle 36: Right of Physicians to Report Suspected Rights Violations=====
Physicians charged with providing medical care for persons deprived of their liberty should be afforded a mechanism for disclosure of suspected detainee abuse to an authority outside the control of the entity committing the abuse, under conditions affording the physician adequate protection against retribution.

=====37. Principle 37: Right to Information about the Outside World=====
All persons deprived of their liberty for an extended time should be given regular access to periodicals, books, educational materials, audio programs, writing materials, and other such items intended to keep them mentally engaged, informed of world events, and to allow them to make productive use of their time while in detention.

=====38. Principle 38: Right of Public Access to Facility Procedures=====
A detaining State should make the general procedures governing the operation of its detention facilities available to the public. Sensitive security information may be exempted from public disclosure, although such procedures should be subject to review through an independent mechanism within the detaining government.

=====39. Principle 39: Rights of Relief Organizations to Inspect Prisoners and Facilities=====
No State should unduly restrict the ability of the International Committee of the Red Cross and other appropriate relief organizations to inspect detention facilities and to engage in unmonitored communication with individual detainees for the purpose of monitoring the States compliance with its responsibility to protect the fundamental rights of detainees under its control.

====D. Section D: Prohibition of Offenses to Personal Welfare and Human Dignity====

=====40. Principle 40: Prohibition of Grave Breaches=====
No State should subject any person to torture, cruel treatment, biological experiments, murder, mutilation, maiming, rape, sexual abuse, or the intentional infliction of serious bodily or psychological injury.

=====41. Principle 41: Prohibition of Extra-Legal Interrogation Methods=====
No State should interrogate any person employing methods that have not been approved for use by law.

=====42. Principle 42: Duty to Maintain Records of Physical Interrogations=====
A State employing physical interrogation methods on any person should be required to maintain records detailing the specific dates, times, and duration of each physical interrogation session and specifying all of the physical methods employed together with the written legal authorization approving their use. Such records should be maintained for a period of fifty years, and destruction of such records should be a criminal offense.

=====43. Principle 43: Right of Access to Records of Physical Interrogations=====

'''''Theory and Event''''' is an [[academic journal]] of political theory with an international editorial board, authors, and readership. Established in 1997, it welcomes theoretical interventions, interpretations, and engagements with political events, institutions, cultures, and issues as they unfold. It provides a forum attractive to intellectuals who work at the intersections of [[political theory]], [[cultural theory]], [[political economy]], [[aesthetics]], [[philosophy]], and [[the arts]]. The journal features innovative, peer-reviewed political theorizing in the [[humanities]] and the [[social sciences]], publishing academic essays as well as other forms of writing and representation--including [[polemics]], [[photography]], and moving images and sounds--that engage diverse political events and phenomena throughout the world. These may include such political formations as [[climate]], [[sovereignty]], [[territory]], [[government]], [[nation]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[family]], [[gender]], [[individual]], capital and the state; old, new, and emerging forms of subjectivity as they may be expressed in [[elections]], popular uprisings, affective flows and assemblages; old, new, and combined media formations; as well as investigations into the objects and conditions of politics, ethics, and critique. The journal encourages contributions that are both rigorous and lively, and that are attentive to scholarship without sacrificing creativity or timeliness.

The journal's twentieth anniversary issue appeared in January 2017.

The current editors are [[Kennan Ferguson]] ([[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]]) and [[James Martel]] ([[San Francisco State University]]). The journal is published quarterly in January, April, July, and October by the [[Johns Hopkins University Press]].

{{RC-Mariology}}
'''Totus Tuus''' was [[Saint]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]]'s [[Apostolic See|apostolic]] [[motto]]. It is a Latin phrase meaning "totally thine" and expressed his personal [[Consecration and entrustment to Mary|Consecration to Mary]] based on the spiritual approach of [[Saint]] [[Louis de Montfort]] and the [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariology]] in his works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope John Paul II]]'s Apostolic Letter ''[https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_letters/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20021016_rosarium-virginis-mariae.html  Rosarium Virginis Mariae]''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pontiff]] explained the meaning further in his book [[Crossing the Threshold of Hope]] where he defines it as not only an expression of [[piety]] but also of devotion that is deeply rooted in the Mystery of the [[Blessed Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/sp_ss_scv/insigne/totus-tuus_en.html Holy See Press Office - Totus Tuus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:John paul 2 coa.svg|thumb|100px|left|Coat of arms of [[John Paul II]], with the ''[[Marian Cross]]'']]
According to his [[Apostolic Letter]] ''[[Rosarium Virginis Mariae]]'' he borrowed the motto from the [[Consecration and entrustment to Mary|Marian consecrating prayer]] found in the book ''[[True Devotion to Mary]]'' by Saint Louis de Montfort.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Louis de Montfort, Treatise on True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin, 266&lt;/ref&gt; The complete text of the prayer in Latin is:
:"Totus tuus ego sum, et omnia mea tua sunt. Accipio te in mea omnia. Praebe mihi cor tuum, Maria." ("I belong entirely to you, and all that I have is yours. I take you for my all. O Mary, give me your heart")

[[Pope John Paul II]] once recalled how as a young [[seminarian]] he "read and reread many times and with great spiritual profit" some writings of Saint Louis de Montfort and that:

:''"Then I understood that I could not exclude the Lord's Mother from my life without neglecting the will of God-Trinity."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeitun-eg.org/jp2.htm Pope Reveals Mary's Role In His Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, [[Henryk Górecki]] composed a choral piece ''([[Totus Tuus (Górecki)|Totus Tuus]] [[Opus number|Op. 60]])'' to celebrate the Pope's third pilgrimage to his native Poland that summer.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.classicalarchives.com/work/74237.html#about Totus tuus, Op.60]". classicalarchives.com. Retrieved on 21 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; While the motet opens with the same words as the apostolic motto, the piece actually uses a poem by Maria Boguslawska for its text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Górecki|first=Henryk Mikolaj|title=Totus Tuus|year=1989|publisher=Boosey &amp; Hawkes|location=New York|ismn=979-0060082320|url=http://www.boosey.com/shop/prod/Totus-Tuus-Choral-Score/670409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Truth and Method''''' ({{lang-de|Wahrheit und Methode}}) is a 1960 book by [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], his major philosophical work.&lt;ref name="guardian_obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/18/guardianobituaries.obituaries | title=Hans-Georg Gadamer | accessdate=March 25, 2011 | author=Roberts, Julian | date=March 18, 2002 | publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Truth and Method'', Gadamer deploys the concept of "[[Hermeneutics|philosophical hermeneutics]]" as it is worked out in [[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927).

==Summary==
Gadamer draws heavily on the ideas of Romantic hermeneuticists such as [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and the work of later hermeneuticists such as [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]. He rejects as unachievable the goal of objectivity, and instead suggests that meaning is created through [[Intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] communication.

Gadamer's philosophical project, as explained in ''Truth and Method'', was to elaborate on the concept of "philosophical hermeneutics", which Heidegger in his ''Being and Time'' initiated but never dealt with at length. Gadamer's goal was to uncover the nature of human understanding. In the book Gadamer argued that "truth" and "method" were at odds with one another. He was critical of two approaches to the [[human science]]s (''{{lang|de|[[Geisteswissenschaft]]en}}''). On the one hand, he was critical of modern approaches to humanities that modelled themselves on the natural sciences (and thus on rigorous scientific methods). On the other hand, he took issue with the traditional German approach to the humanities, represented for instance by Dilthey and Schleiermacher, which believed that correctly interpreting a text meant recovering the original intention of the author who wrote it.

In contrast to both of these positions, Gadamer argued that people have a 'historically effected consciousness' (''{{lang|de|wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewußtsein}}'') and that they are embedded in the particular history and culture that shaped them. Thus interpreting a text involves a [[fusion of horizons]] (''{{lang|de|Horizontverschmelzung}}'') where the scholar finds the ways that the text's history articulates with their own background. ''Truth and Method'' is not meant to be a programmatic statement about a new 'hermeneutic' method of interpreting texts. Gadamer intended ''Truth and Method'' to be a description of what we always do when we interpret things (even if we do not know it): "My real concern was and is philosophic: not what we do or what we ought to do, but what happens to us over and above our wanting and doing".&lt;ref&gt;''Truth and Method'', 2nd edn, [[Sheed and Ward]], London 1989, XXVIII&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==

''Truth and Method'' was published twice in English, and the revised edition is now considered authoritative. The German-language edition of Gadamer's ''Collected Works'' includes a volume in which Gadamer elaborates his argument and discusses the critical response to the book. Finally, Gadamer's essay on poet [[Paul Celan]] (entitled "Who Am I and Who Are You?") has been considered by many—including Heidegger and Gadamer himself—as a "second volume" or continuation of the argument in ''Truth and Method''.

==Reception==
 
''Truth and Method'' is regarded as Gadamer's magnum opus, and has influenced many philosophers and [[sociologists]], notably [[Jürgen Habermas]]. In reaction to Gadamer, critic [[E. D. Hirsch]], in ''Validity and Interpretation'' (1967), reasserted a traditionalist approach to interpretation (following Dilthey and Schleiermacher), seeing—contra ''Truth and Method''—the task of interpretation consisting of reconstructing the intentions of the original author of a text.&lt;ref name="IEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/gadamer/|title=Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900—2002)|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[George Steiner]] writes that Gadamer's influential model of textual understanding is "developed explicitly out of Heidegger's concept and practice of language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Steiner, George |title=Martin Heidegger |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1991 |page=152 |isbn=0-226-77232-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waikino Music Festival''' was a 1977 music and alternatives event held on Bicknell's farm in theWaitawheta Valley between [[Waikino]] and [[Waihi]], [[New Zealand]]. Between band set ups; solo artists, [[poets]] and [[Storytelling|storytellers]], [[comedian]]s, [[yoga]] demonstrations and ravers would entertain, enabling the show to continue without breaks. These ideas were even further developed at the subsequent [[Nambassa]] festivals.

==History==
[[File:1981 Nambassa Festival at Waitawheta Valley near Waikino.jpg|thumb|left|200px|1981 Nambassa Festival at Waitawheta Valley near Waikino, the same location where the Waikino Festival was held.]]
The event was staged as a forerunner to the [[Nambassa]] festivals and was a community project run by Peter Terry. The Waikino festival was originally intended as an eight-hour all day music and cultural event, however, a steady flow of bands, buskers and poets from around [[Auckland]] and the [[Waikato]] spontaneously rocked up to perform. Consequently, the event ran non stop for 24 hours&lt;ref name="Nambassa 1979"&gt;Nambassa: A New Direction, edited by Colin Broadley and Judith Jones, A. H. &amp; A. W. Reed, 1979.{{ISBN|0589012169}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted 5000 patrons. It took place at Franklin Road, Waitawheta Valley, Hauraki.

The Waikino festival broke new ground for the presentation format of open air [[concerts]], by combining popular [[rock music]] and entertainment with [[cultural]] based demonstrations. Between band set ups; solo artists, [[poets]] and [[Storytelling|storytellers]], [[comedian]]s, [[yoga]] demonstrations and ravers would entertain, enabling the show to continue without breaks. These ideas were even further developed at the subsequent [[Nambassa]] festivals.

Proceeds from the Waikino festival went towards the purchase of a winters supply of fuel for the predominantly pensioner community of the sleepy [[Waikino]] village. [[Nambassa]] later contributed towards the construction of a new [[Waikino]] community post office, which was washed away into the [[Karangahake Gorge]] during the great 1981 [[Ohinemuri River]] floods.&lt;ref name="Nambassa 1979" /&gt;

==Entertainment==
[[Th' Dudes]], Living Force, [[Hello Sailor (band)]], Dallas Four, Mommba, Norma Leaf, Steve Tulloch and Charlie Daniels Band. A one-day festival at Waikino. Many of the bands who played Waikino as their first major gig, went on to become national New Zealand music stars. Headlining acts also included spontaneous appearances by the [[Midge Marsden]] and the Country Flyers, Rockinghorse, Ragnarok, and Larry Killip's band Starbow.

'''Étienne Souriau''' ({{IPA-fr|suʁjo|lang}}; April 26, 1892 &amp;ndash; November 19, 1979) was a French philosopher, best known for his work in [[aesthetics]].

Son of [[Paul Souriau]], he studied at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] and received his ''[[agrégation|agrégation of philosophy]]'' in 1925. After teaching at the universities of [[Aix-en-Provence]] and [[Lyon]] he eventually became a professor at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he held a chair in aesthetics. He was the editor of the ''[[Revue d'esthétique]]'' and was elected to the [[Académie des sciences morales et politiques]] in 1958. Recently, the works of [[Bruno Latour]] have reawoken interests on Souriau's oeuvre, specially his works on ontology and metaphysics regarding his theories of different modes of existence.
