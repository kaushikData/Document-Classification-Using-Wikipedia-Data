[[File:Peacock2.jpg|thumb|The Peacock Room, Aesthetic Movement designed by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], one of the most famous examples of Aesthetic style interior design]]

'''Aestheticism''' (also the '''Aesthetic Movement''') is an intellectual and [[art movement]] supporting the emphasis of [[aesthetic]] values more than social-political themes for [[literature]], [[fine art]], [[music]] and other [[art]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul|last=Fargis|title=The New York Public Library Desk Reference - 3rd Edition|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan General Reference|pages=261|isbn=0-02-862169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denney, Colleen. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvTZrnmy5RoC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=%22Aesthetic+movement%22+swinburne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fQGt-5H3y4&amp;sig=Ir3QCh29f7c926rkx620LbcB5fs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7kjKSuy9BNDdlAebobGSAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Aesthetic%20movement%22%20swinburne&amp;f=false "At the Temple of Art: the Grosvenor Gallery, 1877-1890"], Issue 1165, p. 38, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-8386-3850-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This meant that art from this particular movement focused more on being beautiful rather than having a deeper meaning&amp;nbsp;— "art for art's sake". It was particularly prominent in Europe during the 19th century, supported by notable figures such as [[Walter Pater]] and [[Oscar Wilde]], but contemporary critics are also associated with the movement, such as [[Harold Bloom]], who has recently argued against projecting social and political ideology onto literary works, which he believes has been a growing problem in humanities departments over the 20th century. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the 19th century, it was related to other movements such as [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] or [[Decadent movement|decadence]] represented in France, or [[decadentism]]o represented in Italy, and may be considered the British version of the same style.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Aesthetic literature==
The British decadent writers were much influenced by the [[Oxford]] professor [[Walter Pater]] and his essays published during 1867–68, in which he stated that life had to be lived intensely, with an ideal of beauty.  His text ''Studies in the History of the Renaissance'' (1873) was very well regarded by art-oriented young men of the late 19th century. Writers of the [[Decadent movement]] used the slogan "[[Art for Art's Sake]]" (''L'art pour l'art''), the origin of which is debated. Some claim that it was invented by the philosopher [[Victor Cousin]], although [[Angela Leighton]] in the publication ''On Form: Poetry, Aestheticism and the Legacy of a Word'' (2007) notes that the phrase was used by [[Benjamin Constant]] as early as 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Leighton (2007) 32.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally accepted to have been promoted by [[Théophile Gautier]] in France, who interpreted the phrase to suggest that there was not any real association between art and [[morality]].

[[Image:Design for an Aesthetic theatrical poster.png|thumb|left|300px|One of many ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoons about æsthetes]]
The artists and writers of Aesthetic style tended to profess that the Arts should provide refined sensuous pleasure, rather than convey moral or sentimental messages. As a consequence, they did not accept [[John Ruskin]],  [[Matthew Arnold]], and [[George MacDonald]]'s conception of art as something moral or useful, "Art for truth's sake".&lt;ref&gt;Raeper, William (1987) George MacDonald, p. 183. Tring, Herts., and Batavia, IL: Lion Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they believed that Art did not have any [[didactic]] purpose; it only needed to be beautiful. The Aesthetes developed a cult of beauty, which they considered the basic factor of art. Life should copy Art, they asserted. They considered nature as crude and lacking in design when compared to art. The main characteristics of the style were: suggestion rather than statement, sensuality, great use of symbols, and [[Synesthesia|synaesthetic]]/[[ideasthesia|Ideasthetic]] effects—that is, correspondence between words, colours and music. Music was used to establish mood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Predecessors of the Aesthetics included [[John Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and some of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]]s who themselves were a legacy of the Romantic spirit. There are a few significant continuities between the Pre-Raphaelite philosophy and that of the Aesthetes: Dedication to the idea of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’; admiration of, and constant striving for, beauty; escapism through visual and literary arts; craftsmanship that is both careful and self-conscious; mutual interest in merging the arts of various media. This final idea is promoted in the poem ''L’Art'' by [[Théophile Gautier]], who compared the poet to the sculptor and painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the Aesthetic Movement in English Literature|last=McMullen|first=Lorraine|publisher=Bytown Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=Ottawa, ON|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] are most strongly associated with Aestheticism. However, their approach to Aestheticism did not share the creed of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’ but rather “a spirited reassertion of those principles of colour, beauty, love, and cleanness that the drab, agitated, discouraging world of the mid-nineteenth century needed so much.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|last=Welland|first=Dennis S. R.|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|year=1953|isbn=|location=London, UK|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reassertion of beauty in a drab world also connects to Pre-Raphaelite escapism in art and poetry.

In Britain the best representatives were [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], both influenced by the French Symbolists, and [[James McNeill Whistler]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. The style and these poets were satirised by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s comic opera ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' and other works, such as [[F. C. Burnand]]'s drama ''[[The Colonel (play)|The Colonel]]'', and in comic magazines such as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]],'' particularly in works by George Du Maurier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=YgrdCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=michele%20mendelssohn&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Henry James, Oscar Wilde and Aesthetic Culture|last=Mendelssohn|first=Michèle|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0748623853|location=|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compton Mackenzie]]'s novel ''[[Sinister Street]]'' makes use of the type as a phase through which the protagonist passes as he is influenced by older, decadent individuals. The novels of [[Evelyn Waugh]], who was a young participant of aesthete society at Oxford, describe the aesthetes mostly satirically, but also as a former participant. Some names associated with this assemblage are [[Robert Byron]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Harold Acton]], [[Nancy Mitford]], [[A.E. Housman]] and [[Anthony Powell]].

==Aesthetic visual arts==

Artists associated with the Aesthetic style include Simeon Solomon, [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[Aubrey Vincent Beardsley|Aubrey Beardsley]]. Although the work of [[Edward Burne-Jones]] was exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] which promoted the movement, it also contains narrative and  conveys moral or sentimental messages hence it falls outside the given definition.

==Aesthetic Movement decorative arts==
[[File:Florian Papp Aesthetic Exhibition.jpg|thumb|Aesthetic Movement antiques at [[Florian Papp]], New York City]]
The primary element of Decorative Art is utility. The maxim "art for art's sake", identifying art or beauty as the primary element in other branches of the Aesthetic Movement, especially [[fine art]], cannot apply in this context. Decorative art must first have utility, but may also be beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Dresser]]. ''The Art of Decorative Design'' 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; Decorative art is dissociated from fine art.&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrated London News'' LXXXI, Saturday, August 12, 1882, p.175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important elements of the Aesthetic Movement have been identified as Reform and Eastern Art.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Morley. ''Reform and Eastern Art'' Decorative Arts Society Journal, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Government Schools of Design were founded from 1837 onwards in order to improve the design of British goods. Following the Great Exhibition of 1851 efforts were intensified and Oriental objects purchased for the schools teaching collections. [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]], architect and Orientalist was requested to set out key principles of design and these became not only the basis of the schools teaching but also the propositions which preface ''The Grammar of Ornament'' (1856), which is still regarded as the finest systematic study or practical sourcebook of historic world ornament.

Jones identified the need for a new and modern style that would meet the requirements of the modern world, rather than the continual re-cycling of historic styles, but saw no reason to reject the lessons of the past. [[Christopher Dresser]], a student and later Professor at the school  worked with Owen Jones on ''The Grammar of Ornament'', as well as on the 1863 decoration of The Oriental Courts (Chinese, Japanese, and Indian) at the South Kensington Museum, advanced the search for a new style with his two publications ''The Art of Decorative Design'' 1862, and ''Principles of Design'' 1873.

Production of Aesthetic style furniture was limited to approximately the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Aesthetic style furniture is characterized by several common themes:
* [[Ebonized]] wood with gilt highlights.
* Far Eastern influence.
* Prominent use of nature, especially flowers, birds, ginkgo leaves, and peacock feathers.
* Blue and white on [[porcelain]] and other fine china.

Ebonized furniture means that the wood is painted or stained to a black ebony finish. The furniture is sometimes completely ebony-colored. More often however, there is gilding added to the carved surfaces of the feathers or stylized flowers that adorn the furniture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

As aesthetic movement decor was similar to the corresponding writing style in that it was about sensuality and nature, nature themes often appear on the furniture. A typical aesthetic feature is the gilded carved flower, or the stylized peacock feather. Colored paintings of birds or flowers are often seen. Non-ebonized aesthetic movement furniture may have realistic-looking three-dimensional-like renditions of birds or flowers carved into the wood.

Contrasting with the ebonized-gilt furniture is use of blue and white for porcelain and china. Similar themes of peacock feathers and nature would be used in blue and white tones on dinnerware and other crockery. The blue and white design was also popular on square porcelain tiles. It is reported that [[Oscar Wilde]] used aesthetic decorations during his youth. This aspect of the movement was also satirised by ''Punch'' magazine and in ''Patience''.

In 1882 Oscar Wilde visited Canada, where he toured the town of Woodstock, Ontario and gave a lecture on May 29 titled "The House Beautiful".&lt;ref&gt;O'brien (1982) 114.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular lecture featured the early Aesthetic art movement, also known as the "Ornamental Aesthetic" art style, where local flora and fauna were celebrated as beautiful and textured, layered ceilings were popular. An example of this can be seen in [[Annandale National Historic Site]], located in Tillsonburg, Ontario, Canada. The house was built in 1880 and decorated by Mary Ann Tillson, who happened to attend Oscar Wilde's lecture in Woodstock, and was influenced by it. Since the Aesthetic art movement was only prevalent from about 1880 until about 1890, there are not many surviving examples of this particular stylem but one such example is [[18 Stafford Terrace]], London, which provides an insight into how the middle classes interpreted the principles of Aesthetics.

'''Alan Marshall''' is a [[New Zealand]] author, artist and scholar working within the discipline of [[environmental studies]]. He is noted as a key scholar in [[environmental ethics|environmental philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;Oliphant, J.

For his research on these topics, the [[University of Wollongong]] awarded Marshall a doctorate and ''National Geographic'' assigned him as an explorer. Marshall has undertaken projects within institutes all around Europe and in the Asia-Pacific region. For example, he's held fellowships at [http://www.ifz.at/ias/IAS-STS/Fellows-and-Alumni/Alumni/Alan-Marshall IAS-STS] (Austria), the [[N. I. Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod|State University of Nizhny Novgorod]] (Russia), [[University of Prešov|Prešov Universit]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;y &amp; [[Pavol Jozef Šafárik University|UPJŠ]] (Slovakia), [[Masaryk University]] (Czech Republic), [[Khalifa University|KUSTAR]] (Abu Dhabi), [[Nirex|Nirex UK]] (Great Britain), [[Curtin University|Curtin University of Technology]] (Australia), and [[Mahidol University]] (Thailand).





==Major projects==
In the 1990s Alan Marshall developed a [[postmodern]] version of the Human–Nature relationship,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, A (1998) 'A Postmodern Natural History of the World, Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science', Part C, Vol. 34 Part C, No 1, 137-164&lt;/ref&gt; one that throws into doubt the very concepts of 'Humanity' and 'Nature'.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, A (2002) [https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/p268 'The Unity of Nature: Wholeness and Disintegration in Ecology and Science'], Imperial College Press/World Scientific: London &amp; Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; Marshall's approach is heavily influenced by the science of [[ecology]] but has been criticized as privileging one school of ecology, i.e., '[[community ecology]]', over others such as [[systems ecology]] and the ecology of [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]].&lt;ref&gt;de Laplante, K. (2004) Environmental Alchemy: How to turn Ecological Science into Ecological Philosophy, Environmental Ethics, Vol 26, Winter Issue.&lt;/ref&gt;  His book ''The Unity of Nature''&lt;ref&gt;Alan Marshall (2002) ''[https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/p268 The Unity of Nature]'', Imperial College Press/World Scientific: London &amp; Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the fiercest critiques of [[Systems theory|Systems Theory]] in general, and [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia Theory]] and [[Chaos theory|Chaos Theory]] in particular.

In 2006, Alan Marshall founded The [[appropedia:Ecomimicry|Ecomimicry]] Project which tries to meld ecology with Green [[innovation]], sustainable art, and the ethics of [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance: A. Marshall (2007) ‘The Theory and Practice of Ecomimicry’, ''Sustaining Gondwana Working Paper Series'', Issue 3, publlished by Curtin University of Technology: Perth, or A. Marshall (2009) ''‘Wild Design: The Ecomimicry Project’'', published by North Atlantic Books: Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of designs that emerged from this project include:

* a Hemp Sail Battle Cruiser for the Royal Australian Navy (in which a navy ship had its engines 'designed-out' and in their stead it is powered by [[Sail|sails]] made from eco-friendly [[hemp]])
* a [[manure]]-powered swimming pool heating system (in which a luxury pool is heated by the composted [[Feces|body waste]] of the swimmers)
* a hairy-roofed [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian mountain]] village where the architecture is adorned with an engineered protective material that mimics the fur of local [[Brown bear|brown bears.]]

These designs were compiled into Marshall's ''[https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/107954/wild-design-by-alan-marshall/ Wild Design]'' book and then praised by the Australian art &amp; design media.&lt;ref&gt;Downton, P. (2009) Review of Wild Design, Artlink, Vol. 29, No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wakely, M (2009) [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/archived/bydesign/design-inspired-by-nature/3159490 Design Inspired By Nature], ABC Radio National's ''By Design'' program.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Marshall started the '[http://www.ecotopia2121.com/#!project-cities/c66t Ecotopia 2121]' project; which (as noted by ''CNN''&lt;ref&gt;CNN (2017) [https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/utopian-cities/index.html Utopian cities of the future re-imagine life on Earth], CNN Style/Architecture, January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;'', Vanity Fair''&lt;ref&gt;D'Alessio, O.

In early 2016, Marshall began a new project in urban ecology called [http://www.frankencities.com Frankencities]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strochlic|first=N.|date=2018|title=Voici à quoi pourraient ressembler nos villes en 2121|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.fr/sciences/2018/01/voici-quoi-pourraient-ressembler-nos-villes-en-2121|journal=National Geographic|volume=233|issue=2|pages=28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Micu, A.

In response, he has explained he is a 'science critic' and not 'anti-science' (in the same manner that a 'film critic' is not 'anti-film').

For the Frankencities project and for the Ecotopia 2121 project, Marshall developed a novel urban design [[methodology]] known as [http://www.ecotopia2121.com/single-post/2016/09/13/The-Fantasy-Method-of-Urban-Design 'The Literary Method of Urban Design'], which is not so much about design but more about inventing new social change strategies. 

==Fiction==
Alan Marshall is an award-winning writer of fiction. His works of fiction include an historical novel, ''Lancewood'', about an iconic New Zealand plant, and a [[science fiction]] radio drama called ''This Pointless Thing Called Life'' that was broadcast on [[NPR]] and XM Satellite Radio in the USA. In 2001 ''This Pointless Thing Called Life'' received the "Silver Award" from the Mark Time Awards by a panel that included Grammy-award winner [[Phil Proctor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Time/Ogle Award winners|year=2001|url=http://www.greatnorthernaudio.com/MarkTime/MarkTime-winners.html|work=Mark Time Awards|publisher=Jerry Stearns, David Ossman|accessdate=22 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Peter Jackson's ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' movie trilogy, ''This Pointless Thing Called Life'' was nominated for a [[Sir Julius Vogel Award|Vogel Award]] in the category "Best Long Form dramatic science fiction and fantasy production made in New Zealand in the year 2002".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sffanz.org.nz/sjv/sjvNominations-2002.shtml|title=Sir Julius Vogel Award Nominations - 2002|publisher=SFFANZ|accessdate=22 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/SirJuliusVogelNomList.html#3363-2001 |title=Sir Julius Vogel Nominees List |work=The LOCUS Index to SF Awards |publisher=Mark R.

The sequel to "This Pointless Thing Called Life" was another award-winning full-length radio feature broadcast in four parts on XM Satellite and by some NPR stations in 2003. This sequel was titled 'This Miserable Thing Called Life".

'''Angkor Wat''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|ŋ|k|ɔːr|_|ˈ|w|ɒ|t}}; {{lang-km|អង្គរវត្ត}}, "Capital Temple") is a temple complex in [[Cambodia]] and one of the largest
religious monuments in the world, on a site measuring {{convert|162.6|ha|m2 acre}}.&lt;ref name="Guinness"&gt;{{cite web|title=Largest religious structure|work=Guinness World Records|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-religious-structure/|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally constructed as a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temple dedicated to the god [[Vishnu]] for the [[Khmer Empire]], gradually transforming into a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple towards the end of the 12th century.&lt;ref name="cyark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyark.org/news/recycling-monuments-the-hinduismbuddhism-switch-at-angkor|title=Recycling Monuments: The Hinduism/Buddhism Switch at Angkor|author=Ashley M.

Breaking from the [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] tradition of previous kings, Angkor Wat was instead dedicated to Vishnu. As the best-preserved temple at the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant religious centre since its foundation. The temple is at the top of the high classical style of [[Khmer architecture]]. It has become a symbol of [[Cambodia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government : Cambodia|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cb.html|work=CIA World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing on [[Flag of Cambodia|its national flag]], and it is the country's prime attraction for visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambodia's Angkor Wat Breaking Records for Visitors Again {{!}} News from Tourism Cambodia|url=http://www.tourismcambodia.com/news/localnews/8637/cambodias-angkor-wat-breaking-records-for-visitors-again.htm|website=Tourism of Cambodia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the [[Khmer architecture#Temple mountain|temple-mountain]] and the later [[Khmer architecture#Gallery|galleried temple]]. It is designed to represent [[Mount Meru]], home of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] in [[Hindu mythology]]: within a [[moat]] more than 5 kilometres (3&amp;nbsp;mi) long&lt;ref name=Jarus2018&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jarus |first1=Owen |title=Angkor Wat: History of Ancient Temple |url=https://www.livescience.com/23841-angkor-wat.html |accessdate=28 July 2018 |work=Live Science |publisher=Purch |date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an outer wall {{convert|3.6|km|mi|1}} long are three rectangular galleries, each raised above the next. At the centre of the temple stands a [[quincunx]] of towers. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west; scholars are divided as to the significance of this. The temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony of the architecture, its extensive [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-reliefs]], and for the numerous [[devata]]s adorning its walls.

==Etymology==
The modern name, Angkor Wat ({{lang-km|អង្គរវត្ត}}) (alternate name: ''Nokor Wat'', {{lang-km|នគរវត្ត}}),&lt;ref&gt;Khmer dictionary adopted from Khmer dictionary of Buddhist institute of Cambodia, p. 1424, pub. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; means "Temple City" or "City of Temples" in [[Khmer language|Khmer]]; ''Angkor'' ({{lang-km|អង្គរ}}) meaning "city" or "capital city", is a vernacular form of the word ''nokor'' ({{lang-km|នគរ}}), which comes from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''nagara'' ([[Devanāgarī]]: नगर).&lt;ref name=Nath&gt;Chuon Nath Khmer Dictionary (1966, Buddhist Institute, Phnom Penh)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wat]]'' ({{lang-km|វត្ត}}) is the [[Khmer language|Khmer]] word for "temple grounds", also derived from [[Sanskrit]] ''vāṭa'' ([[Devanāgarī]]: वाट), meaning "enclosure".&lt;ref name=Headley77&gt;Cambodian-English Dictionary by Robert K. Headley, Kylin Chhor, Lam Kheng Lim, Lim Hak Kheang, and Chen Chun (1977, Catholic University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The original name of the temple was Vrah Viṣṇuloka or Parama Viṣṇuloka ([[Sanskrit]]), ({{lang-km|បរមវិស្ណុលោក}} – ''Barom Visnulōk'') which means the sacred dwelling of Vishnu.

==History==

[[File:Suryavarman II in procession.jpg|thumb|left|King [[Suryavarman II]], the builder of Angkor Wat]]
Angkor Wat lies {{convert|5.5|km|mi}} north of the modern town of [[Siem Reap]], and a short distance south and slightly east of the previous capital, which was centred at [[Baphuon]]. In an area of Cambodia where there is an important group of ancient structures, it is the southernmost of Angkor's main sites.

According to legend, the construction of Angkor Wat was ordered by Indra to serve as a palace for his son Precha Ket Mealea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HAZrFhvqnTkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=Asiatic Mythology:A Detailed Description and Explanation of the Mythologies of All the Great Nations of Asia|author1= J.

The initial design and construction of the temple took place in the first half of the 12th century, during the reign of [[Suryavarman II]] (ruled 1113 – c. 1150). Dedicated to [[Vishnu]], it was built as the king's state temple and capital city. As neither the foundation [[Stele|stela]] nor any contemporary inscriptions referring to the temple have been found, its original name is unknown, but it may have been known as "Varah Vishnu-lok" after the presiding deity. Work seems to have ended shortly after the king's death, leaving some of the [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-relief]] decoration unfinished.&lt;ref name="Ohio"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://huntingtonarchive.osu.edu/seasia/angkor.html|title=Angkor Wat, 1113–1150 |accessdate=27 April 2008 |publisher=College of the Arts, The Ohio State University |work=The Huntington Archive of Buddhist and Related Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1177, approximately 27 years after the death of Suryavarman II, Angkor was sacked by the [[Champa|Chams]], the traditional enemies of the Khmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F.

Towards the end of the 12th century, Angkor Wat gradually transformed from a Hindu centre of worship to [[Buddhism]], which continues to the present day.&lt;ref name="cyark" /&gt; Angkor Wat is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was largely neglected after the 16th century it was never completely abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize, ''The Monuments of the Angkor Group'' p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen inscriptions dated from the 17th century discovered in Angkor area testify to [[Japanese people|Japanese]] Buddhist pilgrims that had established small settlements alongside Khmer locals.&lt;ref name="Nikkei"&gt;{{cite web |title =Japanese Diaspora – Cambodia | author = Masako Fukawa | author2 = Stan Fukawa |date = 6 Nov 2014 | website = Discover Nikkei | url =http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/journal/2014/11/6/japanese-diaspora-cambodia/ | accessdate =18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the temple was thought by the Japanese visitors as the famed [[Jetavana]] garden of the [[Buddha]], which originally located in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Au-dela du plan Japonais du XVII siècle d'Angkor Vat,  (A XVII century Japanese map of Angkor Wat) |author = Abdoul-Carime Nasir |url =http://aefek.free.fr/iso_album/carteangkor_jetavana.pdf | language =French |accessdate =18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known inscription tells of [[Ukondafu Kazufusa]], who celebrated the [[Khmer New Year]] at Angkor Wat in 1632.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Cambodia, Post-Angkor Era (1431 – present day) | work = Cambodia Travel |url =http://www.cambodia-travel.com/khmer/post-angkor.htm |accessdate =18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first Western visitors to the temple was [[António da Madalena]], a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] friar who visited in 1586 and said that it "is of such extraordinary construction that it is not possible to describe it with a pen, particularly since it is like no other building in the world. It has towers and decoration and all the refinements which the human genius can conceive of."&lt;ref&gt;Higham, ''The Civilization of Angkor'' pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-19th century, the temple was effectively rediscovered by the French naturalist and explorer [[Henri Mouhot]], who popularised the site in the West through the publication of travel notes, in which he wrote:{{cquote|One of these temples, a rival to that of [[Solomon's Temple|Solomon]], and erected by some ancient [[Michelangelo]],
might take an honorable place beside our most beautiful buildings.
It is grander than anything
left to us by [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]
or [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and presents a sad contrast to the state of barbarism in which the nation is now plunged.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [http://www.cambodianview.com/documents/articles/Brief_Presentation.pdf Brief Presentation by Venerable Vodano Sophan Seng]&lt;/ref&gt;}}Angkor Wat may relate to the architecture of the Greek and Roman record explored in terms of the west rather than east orientation of the temple. Some architects have written that it is 'correct' for the construction to be facing to the west. In temple orientations for the Greek and Etruscan context, west is associated with "right" and the "underworld" to suggest a religious connection of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aveni|first=A.|last2=Romano|first2=G.|date=September 1994|title=Orientation and Etruscan ritual|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/orientation-and-etruscan-ritual/E68E1A7992190129C4168A3629E39C9A|journal=Antiquity|language=en|volume=68|issue=260|pages=545–563|doi=10.1017/S0003598X00047049|issn=0003-598X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mouhot, like other early Western visitors, found it difficult to believe that the Khmers could have built the temple and mistakenly dated it to around the same era as Rome. His reports inspired the French government, already an established presence in Indochina, to begin a systematic study of the ruins. The true history of Angkor Wat was pieced together from stylistic and [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] evidence accumulated during subsequent clearing and restoration work.  There were no ordinary dwellings or houses or other signs of settlement, including cooking utensils, weapons, or items of clothing usually found at ancient sites. Instead there is only the evidence of the monuments themselves.&lt;ref name="Southeast Asia 1995 p. 67-99"&gt;''Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Southeast Asia: A Past Regained'' (1995). pp. 67–99&lt;/ref&gt; An exploration commission began drawing up a list of principal monuments. Subsequent missions copied inscriptions written on Angkor buildings so scholars might translate them and learn something of Angkor's history. By 1885 they had worked up a chronology of the rulers and developed the outlines of a description of the civilization that had produced the temple complex.  In 1898 the French decided to commit substantial funds to Angkor's preservation. Centuries of neglect had permitted the jungle to recapture many of the more significant structures, and unless efforts were made to free the buildings from the embrace of huge banyan and silk-cotton trees, they might soon be crushed to destruction.

The 20th century saw considerable restoration of Angkor Wat.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;Glaize p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually teams of laborers and archeologists pushed back the jungle and exposed the expanses of stone, permitting the sun once again to illuminate the dark corners of the temple. Work was interrupted by the [[Cambodian Civil War]] and [[Khmer Rouge]] control of the country during the 1970s and 1980s, but relatively little damage was done during this period. Camping Khmer Rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood, and a shoot-out between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces put a few bullet holes in a bas relief. Far more damage was done after the wars, by [[art thieves]] working out of Thailand, which, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, claimed almost every head that could be lopped off the structures, including reconstructions.&lt;ref name="Angkor Battle"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=9hAteN7ddW0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=Angkor+Wat+Khmer+Rouge+war#v=onepage&amp;q=Angkor%20Wat%20Khmer%20Rouge%20war|title=The Battle of Angkor Wat |magazine=New Scientist|pages=52–57|date=14 October 1989 |author=Russell Ciochon |author2=Jamie James |last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple is a powerful symbol of Cambodia, and is a source of great national pride that has factored into Cambodia's diplomatic relations with France, the United States and its neighbour Thailand. A depiction of Angkor Wat has been a part of [[Flag of Cambodia|Cambodian national flags]] since the introduction of the first version circa 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Flags of the World, [http://flagspot.net/flags/kh_hstry.html Cambodian Flag History]&lt;/ref&gt; From a larger historical and even transcultural perspective, however, the temple of Angkor Wat did not become a symbol of national pride ''sui generis'' but had been inscribed into a larger politico-cultural process of French-colonial heritage production in which the original temple site was presented in French colonial and universal exhibitions in Paris and Marseille between 1889 and 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Falser, Michael (2011).  [http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/transcultural/article/view/9083 ''Krishna and the Plaster Cast. Translating the Cambodian Temple of Angkor Wat in the French Colonial Period''].&lt;/ref&gt; Angkor Wat's aesthetics were also on display in the plaster cast museum of [[Louis Delaporte]] called ''musée Indo-chinois'' which existed in the Parisian Trocadero Palace from c.1880 to the mid-1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Falser, Michael (2013).

The splendid artistic legacy of Angkor Wat and other Khmer monuments in the [[Angkor]] region led directly to France adopting Cambodia as a [[protectorate]] on 11 August 1863 and invading Siam to take control of the ruins. This quickly led to Cambodia reclaiming lands in the northwestern corner of the country that had been under Siamese (Thai) control since AD 1351 (Manich Jumsai 2001), or by some accounts, AD 1431.&lt;ref&gt;Penny Edwards (2007).''Cambodge: The Cultivation of a Nation, 1860–1945'' {{ISBN|978-0824829230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambodia gained independence from France on 9 November 1953 and has controlled Angkor Wat since that time. It is safe to say that from the colonial period onwards until the site's nomination as [[UNESCO World Heritage]] in 1992, this specific temple of Angkor Wat was instrumental in the formation of the modern and gradually globalised concept of built cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Falser, Michael: Clearing the Path towards Civilization – 150 Years of "Saving Angkor". In: Michael Falser (ed.) Cultural Heritage as Civilizing Mission. From Decay to Recovery. Springer: Heidelberg, New York, pp.&amp;nbsp;279–346.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, it was announced that a research team from [[University of Sydney]] had found a previously unseen ensemble of buried towers built and demolished during the construction of Angkor Wat, as well as massive structure of unknown purpose on its south side and wooden fortifications. The findings also include evidence of low-density residential occupation in the region, with a road grid, ponds and mounds. These indicate that the temple precinct, bounded by moat and wall, may not have been used exclusively by the priestly elite, as was previously thought. The team used [[LiDAR]], [[ground-penetrating radar]] and targeted excavation to map Angkor Wat.&lt;ref name="sydney"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2015/12/09/new-discoveries-redefine-angkor-wat-s-history.html|title=Recent research has transformed archaeologists' understanding of Angkor Wat and its surroundings|publisher=University of Sydney| date=9 December 2015| accessdate =10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Site and plan===
[[File:Angkor-Wat-from-the-air.JPG|thumb|left|Aerial view of Angkor Wat]]
Angkor Wat, located at {{Coord|13|24|45|N|103|52|0|E|type:landmark_region:KH|display=inline}}, is a unique combination of the [[Khmer architecture#Temple mountain|temple mountain]] (the standard design for the empire's state temples) and the later plan of concentric [[Khmer architecture#Gallery|galleries]]. The construction of Angkor Wat also suggests that there was a celestial significance with certain features of the temple. This is observed in the temple's east-west orientation, and lines of sight from terraces within the temple that show specific towers to be at the precise location of the sunrise on a solstice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fleming |first1=Stuart |title=Science Scope: The City of Angkor Wat: A Royal Observatory on Life? |journal=Archaeology |date=1985 |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=62–72 |jstor=41731666}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple is a representation of [[Mount Meru]], the home of the gods: the central [[quincunx]] of towers symbolises the five peaks of the mountain, and the walls and moat symbolise the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean.&lt;ref name="multiref2"&gt;Freeman and Jacques p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most Khmer temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west rather than the east. This has led many (including [[Maurice Glaize]] and [[George Coedès]]) to conclude that Suryavarman intended it to serve as his funerary temple.&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|date= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0824803681 |page=162 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The diplomatic envoy Zhou Da Guan sent by Emperor [[Temür Khan]] to Angkor in 1295 reported that the head of state was buried in a tower after his death, and he referred to Angkor Wat as a mausoleum&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence for this view is provided by the [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-reliefs]], which proceed in a counter-clockwise direction—''[[Mandir|prasavya]]'' in Hindu terminology—as this is the reverse of the normal order. Rituals take place in reverse order during Brahminic funeral services.&lt;ref name="multiref1" /&gt; The archaeologist [[Charles Higham (archaeologist)|Charles Higham]] also describes a container which may have been a funerary jar which was recovered from the central tower.&lt;ref name="multiref3"&gt;Higham, ''The Civilization of Angkor'' p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been nominated by some as the greatest expenditure of energy on the disposal of a corpse.&lt;ref name="Scarre p. 81-85"&gt;Scarre, Chris editor (1999). "The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World", London: Thames &amp; Hudson, pp.&amp;nbsp;81–85&lt;/ref&gt;  Freeman and Jacques, however, note that several other temples of [[Angkor]] depart from the typical eastern orientation, and suggest that Angkor Wat's alignment was due to its dedication to [[Vishnu]], who was associated with the west.&lt;ref name="multiref2" /&gt;

A further interpretation of Angkor Wat has been proposed by Eleanor Mannikka. Drawing on the temple's alignment and dimensions, and on the content and arrangement of the bas-reliefs, she argues that the structure represents a claimed new era of peace under King [[Suryavarman II]]: "as the measurements of solar and lunar time cycles were built into the sacred space of Angkor Wat, this divine mandate to rule was anchored to consecrated chambers and corridors meant to perpetuate the king's power and to honour and placate the deities manifest in the heavens above."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eleanor Mannikka|Mannikka, Eleanor]].

===Style===
[[File:Angkor Vat (6931599619).jpg|thumb|left|Angkor Wat as viewed from the side]]
Angkor Wat is the prime example of the classical style of [[Khmer architecture]]—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name. By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled and confident in the use of [[sandstone]] (rather than brick or [[laterite]]) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural [[resin]]s or [[slaked lime]] has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gacp-angkor.de/ German Apsara Conservation Project] Building Techniques, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple has drawn praise above all for the harmony of its design. According to Maurice Glaize, a mid-20th-century conservator of Angkor, the temple "attains a classic perfection by the restrained monumentality of its finely balanced elements and the precise arrangement of its proportions. It is a work of power, unity and style."&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecturally, the elements characteristic of the style include: the [[Ogive|ogival]], redented towers shaped like [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] buds; half-[[Architecture of Cambodia#Gallery|galleries]] to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas (or apsaras)]], [[bas-relief]]s, and on [[pediment]]s extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;APSARA authority, [http://www.autoriteapsara.org/en/angkor/art/styles/angkorian/angkor_vat.html Angkor Vat Style]&lt;/ref&gt; Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including [[gilding|gilded]] [[stucco]] on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman and Jacques p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features===

====Outer enclosure====
[[File:West wall of the outer enclosure Angkor Wat0636.jpg|thumb|left|View of the west wall of the outer enclosure of Angkor Wat]]
[[File:Angkor Wat 005.jpg|thumb|right|Northern library]]
The outer wall, {{convert|1024|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|802|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, is surrounded by a {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} apron of open ground and a moat {{convert|190|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and over 5 kilometres (3&amp;nbsp;mi) in perimeter.&lt;ref name=Jarus2018 /&gt; Access to the temple is by an earth bank to the east and a sandstone causeway to the west; the latter, the main entrance, is a later addition, possibly replacing a wooden bridge.&lt;ref name="multiref4"&gt;Freeman and Jacques p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Gopura|gopuras]] at each of the [[cardinal point]]s; the western is by far the largest and has three ruined towers. Glaize notes that this gopura both hides and echoes the form of the temple proper.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the southern tower is a statue of [[Vishnu]], known as ''Ta Reach'', which may originally have occupied the temple's central shrine.&lt;ref name="multiref4" /&gt; Galleries run between the towers and as far as two further entrances on either side of the gopura often referred to as "elephant gates", as they are large enough to admit those animals. These galleries have square pillars on the outer (west) side and a closed wall on the inner (east) side. The ceiling between the pillars is decorated with [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] rosettes; the west face of the wall with dancing figures; and the east face of the wall with balustered windows, dancing male figures on prancing animals, and [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas]], including (south of the entrance) the only one in the temple to be showing her teeth.

The outer wall encloses a space of 820,000 square metres (203 acres), which besides the temple proper was originally occupied by the city and, to the north of the temple, the royal palace. Like all secular buildings of Angkor, these were built of perishable materials rather than of stone, so nothing remains of them except the outlines of some of the streets.&lt;ref name="Freeman and Jacques p. 50"&gt;Freeman and Jacques p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the area is now covered by forest. A {{convert|350|m|ft|abbr=on}} causeway connects the western gopura to the temple proper, with [[Architecture of Cambodia#Naga|naga]] balustrades and six sets of steps leading down to the city on either side. Each side also features a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Library|library]] with entrances at each cardinal point, in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance, and a pond between the library and the temple itself. The ponds are later additions to the design, as is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the central structure.&lt;ref name="Freeman and Jacques p. 50"/&gt;

====Central structure====
[[File:Middle tower of Angkor Wat temple.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The middle tower of Angkor Wat symbolizes the sacred mountain, mount Meru.]]
[[File:Angot war.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the central structure; in front of the central structure lies the cruciform terrace.]]
The temple stands on a terrace raised higher than the city. It is made of three rectangular [[Architecture of Cambodia#Gallery|galleries]] rising to a central tower, each level higher than the last. Mannikka interprets these galleries as being dedicated to the king, [[Brahma]], the moon, and [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name="Ohio" /&gt; Each gallery has a [[gopura]] at each of the points, and the two inner galleries each have towers at their corners, forming a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Quincunx|quincunx]] with the central tower. Because the temple faces west, the features are all set back towards the east, leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side; for the same reason the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides.
[[File:Awatcornertower01.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A tower of Angkor Wat]]
[[File:REJ 2790.jpg|thumb|View of the Outer Gallery of Angkor Wat]]

The outer gallery measures {{convert|187|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|215|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with pavilions rather than towers at the corners. The gallery is open to the outside of the temple, with columned half-galleries extending and buttressing the structure. Connecting the outer gallery to the second enclosure on the west side is a cruciform cloister called ''Preah Poan'' (the "Hall of a Thousand Gods"). [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] images were left in the cloister by pilgrims over the centuries, although most have now been removed. This area has many inscriptions relating the good deeds of pilgrims, most written in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] but others in [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and Japanese. The four small courtyards marked out by the cloister may originally have been filled with water.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; North and south of the cloister are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Library|libraries]].

Beyond, the second and inner galleries are connected to each other and to two flanking libraries by another cruciform terrace, again a later addition. From the second level upwards, [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas]] abound on the walls, singly or in groups of up to four. The second-level enclosure is {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and may originally have been flooded to represent the [[ocean]] around [[Mount Meru]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, ''Lonely Planet guide to Cambodia'' p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Three sets of steps on each side lead up to the corner towers and gopuras of the inner gallery. The very steep stairways represent the difficulty of ascending to the kingdom of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Ray p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; This inner gallery, called the ''Bakan'', is a {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} square with axial galleries connecting each gopura with the central shrine, and subsidiary shrines located below the corner towers. The roofings of the galleries are decorated with the motif of the body of a snake ending in the heads of lions or [[garuda]]s. Carved [[Architecture of Cambodia#Lintels and pediments|lintels and pediments]] decorate the entrances to the galleries and to the shrines.
The tower above the central shrine rises {{convert|43|m|ft|abbr=on}} to a height of {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground; unlike those of previous temple mountains, the central tower is raised above the surrounding four.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The shrine itself, originally occupied by a statue of Vishnu and open on each side, was walled in when the temple was converted to [[Theravada Buddhism]], the new walls featuring standing Buddhas. In 1934, the conservator George Trouvé excavated the pit beneath the central shrine: filled with sand and water it had already been robbed of its treasure, but he did find a sacred foundation deposit of [[gold leaf]] two metres above ground level.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decoration====
[[File:Awatoceanofmilk01.JPG|thumb|The bas-relief of the [[Samudra manthan|Churning of the Sea of Milk]] shows [[Vishnu]] in the centre, his turtle [[Avatar]] [[Kurma]] below, [[asura]]s and [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]] to left and right, and [[apsaras]] and [[Indra]] above.]]
[[File:Angkor Wat - 047 Apsaras (8581709930).jpg|thumb|left|[[Devatas]] are characteristic of the Angkor Wat style.]]
Integrated with the architecture of the building, and one of the causes for its fame is Angkor Wat's extensive decoration, which predominantly takes the form of [[bas-relief]] friezes. The inner walls of the outer gallery bear a series of large-scale scenes mainly depicting episodes from the Hindu epics the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]. Higham has called these, "the greatest known linear arrangement of stone carving".&lt;ref&gt;Higham, ''Early Cultures of Mainland Southeast Asia'' p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; From the north-west corner anti-clockwise, the western gallery shows the Battle of Lanka (from the Ramayana, in which [[Rama]] defeats [[Ravana]]) and the [[Kurukshetra War|Battle of Kurukshetra]] (from the Mahabharata, showing the mutual annihilation of the [[Kaurava]] and [[Pandava]] clans). On the southern gallery follow the only historical scene, a procession of [[Suryavarman II]], then the 32 [[hell]]s and 37 [[heaven]]s of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angkor-4+.JPG|thumb|upright|Decoration on the corner]]
On the eastern gallery is one of the most celebrated scenes, the [[Kurma|Churning of the Sea of Milk]], showing 92&lt;ref&gt;Glaize&lt;/ref&gt; [[asura]]s and 88 [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]] using the serpent [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] to churn the sea under Vishnu's direction (Mannikka counts only 91 asuras, and explains the asymmetrical numbers as representing the number of days from the [[winter solstice]] to the [[spring equinox]], and from the equinox to the summer [[solstice]]).&lt;ref&gt;Described in Michael Buckley, [http://www.veloasia.com/library/buckley/churning_milk.html The Churning of the Ocean of Milk]&lt;/ref&gt; It is followed by Vishnu defeating [[asura]]s (a 16th-century addition). The northern gallery shows Krishna's victory over [[Banasura|Bana]] (where according to Glaize, "The workmanship is at its worst").&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angkor Wat is decorated with depictions of [[apsaras]] and [[devata]]; there are more than 1,796 depictions of devata in the present research inventory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devata.org/2010/02/angkor-wat-devata-inventory/ Angkor Wat devata inventory – February 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423123631/http://www.devata.org/2010/02/angkor-wat-devata-inventory/ |date=23 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Angkor Wat architects employed small apsara images ({{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}–{{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}}) as decorative motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (all full-body portraits measuring approximately {{convert|95|cm|in|abbr=on}}–{{convert|110|cm|in|abbr=on}}) more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high towers. In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewellery and decorative flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period.&lt;ref&gt;Sappho Marchal, ''Khmer Costumes and Ornaments of the Devatas of Angkor Wat''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction techniques===
[[File:Angkor Wat 13 11.JPG|thumb|upright|Corridor]]
The stones, as smooth as polished marble, were laid without mortar with very tight joints that are sometimes hard to find. The blocks were held together by [[mortise and tenon]] joints in some cases, while in others they used dovetails and gravity. The blocks were presumably put in place by a combination of elephants, [[coir]] ropes, pulleys and [[bamboo scaffolding]]. Henri Mouhot noted that most of the blocks had holes {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep, with more holes on the larger blocks. Some scholars have suggested that these were used to join them together with iron rods, but others claim they were used to hold temporary pegs to help manoeuvre them into place.

The monument was made out of 5 million to 10 million sandstone blocks with a maximum weight of 1.5 tons each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/24440-angkor-wat-canals.html|title=Mystery of Angkor Wat Temple's Huge Stones Solved|date=31 October 2012|last=Ghose|first=Tia|work=livescience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the entire city of [[Angkor]] used up far greater amounts of stone than all the Egyptian pyramids combined, and occupied an area significantly greater than modern-day [[Paris]]. Moreover, unlike the Egyptian pyramids which use limestone quarried barely {{convert|0.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} away all the time, the entire city of Angkor was built with sandstone quarried {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} (or more) away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/specials/ancient-mysteries/angkor-wat-temples/|title=Lost City of Angkor Wat|work=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This sandstone had to be transported from Mount Kulen, a quarry approximately {{convert|25|mi|km}} to the northeast. The route has been suggested to span {{convert|35|km|mi}} along a canal towards [[Tonlé Sap]] lake, another {{convert|35|km|mi}} crossing the lake, and finally {{convert|15|km|mi}} against the current along [[Siem Reap River]], making a total journey of {{convert|90|km|mi}}. However, Etsuo Uchida and Ichita Shimoda of [[Waseda University]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] have discovered in 2011 a shorter {{convert|35|km|mi|adj=on}} canal connecting Mount Kulen and Angkor Wat using satellite imagery. The two believe that the Khmer used this route instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = Etsuo | last = Uchida | first2 = Ichita | last2 = Shimoda | title = Quarries and transportation routes of Angkor monument sandstone blocks | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | date = 2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.jas.2012.09.036 | issn = 0305-4403 | pages = 1158–1164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually all of its surfaces, columns, lintels and even roofs are carved. There are miles of reliefs illustrating scenes from [[Indian literature]] including unicorns, griffins, winged dragons pulling chariots as well as warriors following an elephant-mounted leader and celestial dancing girls with elaborate hair styles. The gallery wall alone is decorated with almost 1,000 square metres of bas reliefs. Holes on some of the Angkor walls indicate that they may have been decorated with bronze sheets. These were highly prized in ancient times and were a prime target for robbers. While excavating Khajuraho, Alex Evans, a stonemason and sculptor, recreated a stone sculpture under {{convert|4|ft|m}}, this took about 60 days to carve.&lt;ref&gt;"Lost Worlds of the Kama Sutra" History channel&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehner also conducted experiments to quarry limestone which took 12 quarrymen 22 days to quarry about 400 tons of stone.&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, Mark  (1997). ''The Complete Pyramids'', London: Thames and Hudson, pp.&amp;nbsp;202–225 {{ISBN|0500050848}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The labour force to quarry, transport, carve and install so much sandstone must have run into the thousands including many highly skilled artisans. The skills required to carve these sculptures were developed hundreds of years earlier, as demonstrated by some artefacts that have been dated to the seventh century, before the Khmer came to power.&lt;ref name="Southeast Asia 1995 p. 67-99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scarre p. 81-85"/&gt;

===Restoration and conservation===
[[File:WMF Angkor Wat.ogv|[[World Monuments Fund]] video on conservation of Angkor Wat|thumb]]
As with most other ancient temples in Cambodia, Angkor Wat has faced extensive damage and deterioration by a combination of plant overgrowth, fungi, ground movements, war damage and theft. The war damage to Angkor Wat's temples however has been very limited, compared to the rest of Cambodia's temple ruins, and it has also received the most attentive restoration.&lt;ref name="Angkor Battle"/&gt;

[[File:Bullet holes at angkor wat.jpg|thumb|left|Bullet holes left by a shoot-out between the Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces at Angkor Wat.]]

The restoration of Angkor Wat in the modern era began with the establishment of the Conservation d'Angkor (Angkor Conservancy) by the [[École française d'Extrême-Orient]] (EFEO) in 1908; before that date, activities at the site were primarily concerned with exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_publication/Considerations_for_the_Conservation_and_Preservation_of_the_Historic_City_of_Angkor_Report_I.pdf |title=Considerations for the Conservation and Presentation of the.

===Tourism===
[[File:Statue in Cambodia.jpg|thumb|Statue of god [[Vishnu]], understood as ''Ta Reach'' under the southern tower]]
Since the 1990s, Angkor Wat has become a major tourist destination.  In 1993, there were only 7,650 visitors to the site;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/25/travel.travelnews |title= Tourist invasion threatens to ruin glories of Angkor Wat |author=Justine Smith |date= 25 February 2007 |work=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 2004, government figures show that 561,000 foreign visitors had arrived in Siem Reap province that year, approximately 50% of all foreign tourists in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.tourismcambodia.com/Statistics/index.asp?Year=2005 |title=Executive Summary from Jan–Dec 2005 |accessdate=25 April 2008 |work=Tourism of Cambodia |publisher=Statistics &amp; Tourism Information Department, Ministry of Tourism of Cambodia| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080413115411/http://www.tourismcambodia.com/Statistics/index.asp?Year=2005| archivedate= 13 April 2008 | deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number reached over a million in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tourismcambodia.org/images/mot/statistic_reports/tourism_statistics_annual_report_book_2007.pdf |title=Tourism Statistics: Annual Report |page=60 |work=Ministry of Tourism }}&lt;/ref&gt; and over two million by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tourismcambodia.org/images/mot/statistic_reports/tourism_statistics_annual_report_2012.pdf |title=Tourism Annual Report 2012 |work=Ministry of Tourism }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most visited Angkor Wat, which received over two million foreign tourists in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/business/ticket-sales-angkor-wat-exceed-2-million |title=Ticket sales at Angkor Wat exceed 2 million |work=The Phnom Penh Post |date= 21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The site has been managed by the private [[Sokimex|SOKIMEX]] group since 1990, which rented it from the [[Cambodian government]]. The influx of tourists has so far caused relatively little damage, other than some [[graffiti]]; ropes and wooden steps have been introduced to protect the bas-reliefs and floors, respectively. Tourism has also provided some additional funds for maintenance—as of 2000 approximately 28% of ticket revenues across the whole [[Angkor]] site was spent on the temples—although most work is carried out by teams sponsored by foreign governments rather than by the Cambodian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Tales of Asia, [http://www.talesofasia.com/cambodia-interviews-AC.htm Preserving Angkor: Interview with Ang Choulean (13 October 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Angkor Wat has seen significant growth in tourism throughout the years, [[UNESCO]] and its International Co-ordinating Committee for the Safeguarding and Development of the Historic Site of Angkor (ICC), in association with representatives from the Royal Government and [[APSARA]], organised seminars to discuss the concept of "cultural tourism".&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2006.06.004|title=Rethinking tourism in asia|date=2007|last1=Winter|first1=Tim|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=34|pages=27–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wanting to avoid commercial and mass tourism, the seminars emphasised the importance of providing high quality accommodation and services in order for the Cambodian government to benefit economically, while also incorporating the richness of Cambodian culture.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; In 2001, this incentive resulted in the concept of the "Angkor Tourist City" which would be developed with regard to traditional Khmer architecture, contain leisure and tourist facilities, and provide luxurious hotels capable of accommodating large numbers of tourists.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

The prospect of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism developments in the area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects have the potential to damage landscape features.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a direct effect on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

At the [[ASEAN]] Tourism Forum 2012, it was agreed that [[Borobudur]] and Angkor Wat would become sister sites and the provinces sister provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/01/13/borobudur-angkor-wat-become-sister-sites.html |title=Borobudur, Angkor Wat to become sister sites |date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Any-angle path planning''' algorithms are a subset of [[pathfinding]] algorithms that search for a path between two points in space and allow the turns in the path to have any angle. The result is a path that goes directly toward the goal and has relatively few turns.&lt;ref&gt;Tansel Uras and Sven Koenig. [http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SOCS/SOCS15/paper/viewFile/11295/10658 An Empirical Comparison of Any-Angle Path-Planning Algorithms]. Proceedings of the Eighth International Symposium on Combinatorial Search.&lt;/ref&gt; Other pathfinding algorithms such as [[A* search algorithm|A*]] constrain the paths to a grid, which produces jagged, indirect paths. Any-angle algorithms are able to find optimal or near-optimal paths by incorporating the any-angle search into the algorithm itself. Algorithms such as A* Post Smoothing that smooth a path found by a grid constrained algorithm are unable to reliably find optimal paths since they cannot change what side of a blocked cell is traversed.

==Motivation==
Any-angle path planning algorithms are necessary in order to quickly find an optimal path. For a world represented by a grid of blocked and unblocked cells, the brute-force way to find an any-angle path is to search the corresponding [[visibility graph]]. This is problematic since the number of edges in a graph with &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; vertices is &lt;math&gt;O(V^2)&lt;/math&gt;. Searching the discrete [[grid graph]] can be done quickly since the number of edges grows linearly with the number of vertices, but the paths are not optimal since the angle of the turns are constrained to 45° or 90°, which will add turns and increase the overall length of the path. Smoothing a grid-constrained path after does not fix this problem since the algorithm that found that path did not look at all possible paths. Any-angle path planning algorithms find shorter paths than the grid-constrained algorithms while taking roughly same amount of time to compute.{{citation needed|reason=Are algorithms that search the corresponding visibility graph not considered any-angle path planning algorithms? According to whom, in that case?|date=December 2016}}

For single-source path-planning on practical maps, it is demonstrated to be faster than graph search based methods. There are optimal and integer-arithmetic implementations.

Besides, for search in high-dimensional search spaces, such as when the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of the system involves many [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] that need to be considered (see [[Motion planning]]), and/or [[momentum]] needs to be considered (which could effectively double the number of dimensions of the search space; this larger space including momentum is known as the [[phase space]]), variants of the [[rapidly-exploring random tree]] (RRT)&lt;ref name=lavalle_tr98&gt;

The '''Astronomical Image Processing System''' (AIPS) is a software package to support the reduction and analysis of data taken with radio telescopes. Developed predominantly for use with the then under-construction [[Very Large Array|VLA]], the generality inherent in its design allowed it to become the standard data-reduction package for most radio interferometers, including [[VLBI]]. Limited single-dish capability is also featured. Although partially replaced by CASA, it continues to evolve and remains widely used.

==History==
{{more citations needed|date=August 2016}}
Development of AIPS started at [[NRAO]] in 1978, two years before the VLA became fully operational. Originally written in [[FORTRAN 66]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Wells|first1=Donald|title=NRAO's Astronomical Image Processing System|conference=Data Analysis in Astronomy|date=1985|page=202|publisher=[[Kluwer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIPS has used [[FORTRAN 77]] since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greisen|first1=Eric|editor1-last=Heck|editor1-first=André|title=AIPS, the VLA, and the VLBA|journal=Information Handling in Astronomy - Historical Vistas|page=114|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very first AIPS installation was on a [[MODCOMP]] computer, but the package's portability has led to it being installed on many different systems. Pre-compiled versions are today available for users of [[Linux]], [[MacOS|Mac OS]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]].&lt;ref name="AIPSFAQ"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greisen|first1=Eric|title=The AIPS FAQ|url=http://www.aips.nrao.edu/aips_faq.html|website=AIPS|publisher=NRAO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the capabilities of AIPS have also greatly expanded. Initial usage was focused on the VLA, but it has gone on to be used to reduce data from practically all radio interferometers, including [[MERLIN]] and the [[GMRT]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope|WSRT]] and [[Australia Telescope Compact Array|ATCA]]. The ability to calibrate VLBI data (including [[space VLBI]]) was added in the 1990s, primarily to support operations with the [[Very Long Baseline Array|VLBA]], but in the process becoming the main data-reduction package for the [[European VLBI Network|EVN]] and combined VLBA/EVN observations (Global VLBI). Single-dish support was also added in the 1980s, with particular application to NRAO's [[ARO 12m Radio Telescope|12-m radio telescope]] and the 91-m transit telescope.

AIPS has now been in use for over 30 years and has even outlived its supposed replacement [[AIPS++]], which was eventually rebranded as CASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Shannon|title=The Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA)|journal=Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems ASP Conference Series|date=2008|volume=394|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2008ASPC..394..623J}}&lt;/ref&gt; CASA has gone on to be the main data-reduction package for the upgraded VLA (EVLA) and [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]], but AIPS remains able, to a large degree, to process data from these state-of-the-art instruments. Despite its age and limited resources, AIPS remains widely used and under active development. AIPS is free software and is covered by the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]].

==Description==
AIPS runs under the [[X Window System]] with commands entered interactively using a command-line interpreter called POPS. Although relatively primitive, this gives access to a useful collection of e.g. mathematical functions, logical operators and flow control statements. Commands can also be placed in a text file which makes repeating complicated procedures much more convenient and which can be used to create data-reduction [[Pipeline (computing)|pipelines]]. A more modern alternative is to install ParselTongue, a [[Python (programming language)|Python]]-based interface.

As well as the terminal window from which AIPS is started and commands entered, most AIPS sessions will by default contain two other windows, the AIPS TV and the Message Server. The TV is used to visualise data or images and can, for example, be used to interactively edit data or control the progress of a [[deconvolution]]. The Message Server displays useful information reported by each task. Optionally, basic black and white plots can be displayed using TEKSRV, a [[Tektronix 4010|Tektronix 4012]]-based graphics terminal.

Before any data can be processed by AIPS, they must first be imported into the system's own data areas, usually in [[FITS]] format. The FITS standard was agreed in 1979 and its development is inseparable from that of AIPS. The data can henceforth be processed using a large number (&gt;530) of individual programs, each of which performs a specific task e.g. producing an image from a calibrated data set. Together these allow a user to visualize, edit and calibrate a data set and subsequently make images or fit models. A number of analysis tasks are included (e.g. Gaussian fitting to images or spectra) as well as the possibility to make publication-quality plots.

Extensive help is available to AIPS users, with detailed information on each parameter and task viewable from the command line. There is also a [[user guide]], the AIPS Cookbook, which is built around examples (recipes) of how to run the various tasks. It is available on-line, as well as being packaged with AIPS in PDF and PostScript formats. A newsletter (AIPSLetter) is published biannually.

==Primatology==
Although briefly known as RANCID,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greisen|first1=Eric|editor1-last=Heck|editor1-first=André|title=AIPS, the VLA, and the VLBA|journal=Information Handling in Astronomy - Historical Vistas|page=111|date=2003|publisher=Kluwer}}&lt;/ref&gt; the eventual choice of name has led to a preponderance of primate-based humour in and around AIPS. The Cookbook contains "additional recipes", instructions for preparing food and drink which all feature bananas as an ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |first=Eric|last=Greisen|title=The Creation of AIPS|work=AIPS Memo|issue=100|institution=NRAO|page=14|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programmers guide is called ''Going AIPS'', the cover of which features a gorilla clutching a [[Tektronix 4010|Tektronix 4012]] graphics terminal whilst standing upon two [[IBM 3420]] Magnetic Tape Units. Various cover designs of the Cookbook and icons also include images of primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |first=Eric|last=Greisen|title=The Creation of AIPS|work=AIPS Memo|issue=100|institution=NRAO|pages=11-13|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Basic Economics Test''' or '''BET''' is a [[standardized test]] of [[economics]] nationally [[norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]] in the United States for use in the upper-grade levels of elementary schools.  It is one of four grade-level specific standardized economics tests (i.e., [[Test of Economic Knowledge]] (TEK), [[Test of Economic Literacy]] (TEL) and [[Test of Understanding in College Economics]] (TUCE)) sponsored and published by the [[National Council on Economic Education]] (NCEE) .

The BET was recently revised into its third edition in 2007 and will soon be available, along with an examiner’s manual, for teachers, school administrators and researchers through the NCEE.  The revision process took place at the [[National Center for Research in Economic Education]] (NCREE) and included a new set of norm-references that consisted of teacher and student participation from twenty-three U.S. states.  The BET has two parallel forms, each with thirty four-option [[multiple-choice]] items with [[content validity]] based on the [[Voluntary National Content Standards in Economics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13521">The '''biophilia hypothesis''' also called BET suggests that humans possess an innate tendency to seek connections with [[nature]] and other forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;"biophilia hypothesis." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]]  introduced and popularized the hypothesis in his book, ''Biophilia'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Edward O.|title=Biophilia|year=1984|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]|isbn=0-674-07442-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He defines biophilia as "the urge to affiliate with other forms of life".&lt;ref&gt;Kellert &amp; Wilson 1995, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Love of living systems ==
The term "biophilia" means "love of life or living systems." It was first used by [[Erich Fromm]] to describe a [[Erich Fromm|psychological orientation]] of being attracted to all that is alive and vital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fromm|first=Erich|title=The Heart of Man|year=1964|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson uses the term in the same sense when he suggests that biophilia describes "the connections that human beings subconsciously seek with the rest of life." He proposed the possibility that the deep affiliations humans have with other life forms and nature as a whole are rooted in our biology. Unlike [[phobia]]s, which are the aversions and fears that people have of things in their environment, [[philia]]s are the attractions and positive feelings that people have toward organisms, species, habitats, processes and objects in their natural surroundings. 
Although named by Fromm, the concept of biophilia has been proposed and defined many times over. Aristotle was one of many to put forward a concept that could be summarized as "love of life". Diving into the term ''philia'', or friendship, Aristotle evokes the idea of reciprocity and how friendships are beneficial to both parties in more than just one way, but especially in the way of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;SANTAS, ARISTOTELIS. "Aristotelian Ethics And Biophilia." Ethics &amp; The Environment 19.1 (2014): 95-121. GreenFILE. Web. 24 Feb. 2015 http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=2ed69cd6-0f3e-47aa-b03a-a284b3619652%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=116&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Children and Nature: Psychological, Sociocultural, and Evolutionary Investigations'' edited by Peter Kahn and Stephen Kellert,&lt;ref name="childrennature"&gt;{{cite book|title=Children and nature: psychological, sociocultural, and evolutionary investigations|first=Peter |last=Kahn|first2=Stephen |last2=Kellert|year=2002 |publisher=[[MIT Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCjdKjI_qIcC&amp;pg=PA153|isbn=0-262-11267-1 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; the importance of animals, especially those with which a child can develop a nurturing relationship, is emphasized particularly for early and middle childhood. Chapter 7 of the same book reports on the help that animals can provide to children with autistic-spectrum disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Animals in Therapeutic Education: Guides into the Liminal State|first=Aaron|last=Katcher|title=Children and Nature: Psychological, Sociocultural, and Evolutionary Investigations|year=2002|editor1-last=Kahn|editor1-first=Peter H.|editor2-last=Kellert|editor2-first=Stephen R|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCjdKjI_qIcC&amp;pg=PA179|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-11267-1|accessdate=January 30, 2013|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product of biological evolution ==
Human preferences toward things in [[nature]], while refined through experience and culture, are hypothetically the product of biological evolution. For example, adult mammals (especially humans) are generally attracted to baby mammal faces and find them [[Cuteness|appealing]] across species. The large eyes and small features of any young mammal face are far more appealing than those of the mature adults.

Similarly, the hypothesis helps explain why ordinary people care for and sometimes risk their lives to save domestic and wild animals, and keep plants and flowers in and around their homes. In other words, our natural love for life helps sustain life.

Very often, flowers also indicate potential for food later. Most fruits start their development as flowers. For our ancestors, it was crucial to spot, detect and remember the plants that would later provide nutrition.

==Biophilia and conservation==
Because of our technological advancements and more time spent inside buildings and cars, it is argued that the lack of biophilic activities and time spent in nature may be strengthening the disconnect of humans from nature. Although, it also has shown strong urges among people to reconnect with nature. 
The concern for a lack of connection with the rest of nature outside of us, is that a stronger disregard for other plants, animals and less appealing wild areas could lead to further ecosystem degradation and species loss. Therefore, reestablishing a connection with nature has become more important in the field of conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rogers|first1=Kara|title=Biophilia Hypothesis|url=http://www.britannica.com/science/biophilia-hypothesis|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |accessdate=10 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2016}} Examples would be more available green spaces in and around cities, more classes that revolve around nature and implementing smart design for greener cities that integrate ecosystems into them such as biophilic cities. These cities can also become part of wildlife corridors to help with migrational and territorial needs of other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biophilic Cities | url=http://biophiliccities.org|website=Biophilic Cities|accessdate=10 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The hypothesis has since been developed as part of theories of [[evolutionary psychology]] in the book ''The Biophilia Hypothesis'' edited by Stephen R. Kellert and Edward O. Wilson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kellert|first=Stephen R. (ed.)|title=The Biophilia Hypothesis|publisher=[[Island Press]]|year=1993|isbn=1-55963-147-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Lynn Margulis]].  Also, Stephen Kellert's work seeks to determine common human responses to perceptions of, and ideas about, plants and animals, and to explain them in terms of the conditions of human evolution.

==Biophilic design==
In [[architecture]], biophilic design is a [[sustainable design]] strategy that incorporates reconnecting people with the natural environment. It may be seen as a necessary complement to [[Sustainable architecture|green architecture]], which decreases the environmental impact of the built world but does not address human reconnection with the natural world.&lt;ref name="kellert-film"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stephenrkellert.net/biophilic-design.html | title=Biophilic Design: The Architecture of Life | work=www.stephenrkellert.net | accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gangemi Editore  [http://www.gangemieditore.com/dettaglio/partecipazione-ict/4248/2] {{ISBN|9788849225365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biophilic architecture is characterized by the following elements: i) the naturalistic dimension; (ii) the Wholeness &lt;ref&gt;C.

Having a window looking out to plants is also claimed to help speed up the healing process of patients in hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nature-that-nurtures/ Windows looking out to plants helping the healing process]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, having plants in the same room as patients in hospitals also speeds up their healing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=19715461 | doi=10.1089/acm.2009.0075 | volume=15 | title=Ornamental indoor plants in hospital rooms enhanced health outcomes of patients recovering from surgery | year=2009 | journal=J Altern Complement Med | pages=975–80 | last1 = Park | first1 = SH | last2 = Mattson | first2 = RH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biophilia in fiction==
Canadian author [[Hilary Cunningham Scharper|Hilary Scharper]] explicitly adapted [[E. O. Wilson|E.O.

Chemically, '''black carbon''' ('''BC''') is a component of fine [[Particulates|particulate matter]] (PM ≤ 2.5&amp;nbsp;µm in [[aerodynamic diameter]]). Black carbon consists of pure carbon in several linked forms.  It is formed through the incomplete combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s, [[biofuel]], and [[biomass]], and is emitted in both [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] and naturally occurring [[soot]].&lt;ref name="Anenberg, ''et al.'', 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Anenberg SC, Schwartz J, Shindell D, Amann M, Faluvegi G, Klimont Z, Janssens-Maenhout G, Pozzoli L, Van Dingenen R, Vignati E, Emberson L, Muller NZ, West JJ, Williams M, Demkine V, Hicks WK, Kuylenstierna J, Raes F, Ramanathan V |title=Global air quality and health co-benefits of mitigating near-term climate change through methane and black carbon emission controls |journal=Environ Health Perspect |date=June 2012 |volume=120 |issue=6 |pages=831–839 |doi=10.1289/ehp.1104301|pmid=22418651| pmc=3385429 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black carbon causes human [[morbidity]] and premature mortality.&lt;ref name="Anenberg, ''et al.'', 2012" /&gt;

In [[climatology]], black carbon is a [[climate forcing]] agent. Black carbon [[Global warming|warms the Earth]] by absorbing sunlight and heating the atmosphere and by reducing [[albedo]] when deposited on snow and ice (direct effects) and indirectly by interaction with clouds, with the total forcing of 1.1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgrd.50171/abstract|title = Bounding the role of black carbon in the climate system: A scientific assessment|last = Bond|date = 2013|journal = J.

Ramanathan and G. Carmichael, ''Global and regional climate changes due to black carbon'', 1 [[Nature Geoscience]] 221-22 (23 March 2008) ("The BC forcing of 0.9 W m–2 (with a range of 0.4 to 1.2 W m–2) … is as much as 55% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other GHGs such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CFCs, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or tropospheric ozone.")&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''black carbon'' is also used in [[soil sciences]] and geology, referring either to deposited atmospheric black carbon or to directly incorporated black carbon from vegetation fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masiello | first1 = C.A. | year = 2004 | title = New directions in black carbon organic geochemistry | url = | journal = MARINE CHEMISTRY | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 201–213 | doi=10.1016/j.marchem.2004.06.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt | first1 = M.W.I. | last2 = Noack | first2 = A.G. | year = 2000 | title = Black carbon in soils and sediments: Analysis, distribution, implications and current challenges | url = | journal = GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 777–793 | doi=10.1029/1999gb001208 | bibcode=2000GBioC..14..777S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the tropics, black carbon in soils significantly contributes to fertility as it is able to absorb important plant nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;Glaser B (2007) Prehistorically modified soils of central Amazonia: a model for sustainable agriculture in the twenty-first century.

==Overview==
{{Essay-like|section|date=February 2013}}
The term black carbon was coined by [[Tihomir Novakov]], referred to as "the godfather of black carbon studies" by [[James Hansen]], in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Allan|title=Carbonaceous Aerosols and Climate Change: How Researchers Proved Black Carbon is a Significant Force in the Atmosphere|url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/newsletter/nl17/eetd-nl17-4-blackcarbon.html|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|accessdate=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoke or soot was the first pollutant to be recognized as having significant [[environmental impact]] yet one of the last to be studied by the contemporary atmospheric research community.  [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]] recognized that soot was composed of carbon and that it was produced by the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Faraday, M., Chemical History of a Candle, Harper, New York, 1861&lt;/ref&gt;

Soot is composed of a complex mixture of organic compounds which are weakly absorbing in the visible spectral region and a highly absorbing black component which is variously called “elemental”, “graphitic” or “black carbon”. The term elemental carbon has been used in conjunction with thermal and wet chemical determinations and the term  graphitic carbon suggests the presence  of [[graphite]]-like micro-crystalline structures in soot as evidenced by [[Raman Spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = H. | last2 = Novakov | first2 = T. | title = Raman scattering and the characterization of  atmospheric aerosol particles | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 266 | issue = 708–710| page = 1977 | doi=10.1038/266708a0| bibcode = 1977Natur.266..708R}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term black carbon is used to imply that this soot component is primarily responsible for the absorption of visible light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yasa | first1 = Z. | last2 = Amer | first2 = N.M. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = H. | last4 = Hansen | first4 = A.D.A | last5 = Novakov | first5 = T. | year = 1979 | title = Photoacoustic investigations of urban aerosol particles | url = | journal = Appl.

===Early mitigation attempts===
The disastrous effects of coal pollution on human health and mortality in the early 1950s in London led to the UK [[Clean Air Act 1956]]. This act led to dramatic  reductions of soot concentrations in the United Kingdom which were followed by similar reductions in US cities like Pittsburgh and St. Louis. These reductions were largely achieved by the decreased use of soft coal for domestic heating by switching either to “smokeless” coals or other forms of fuel, such as fuel oil and natural gas.  The steady reduction of smoke pollution in the industrial cities of Europe and United States caused a shift in research emphasis away from soot emissions and the almost complete neglect of black carbon as a significant aerosol constituent, at least in the United States.

In the 1970s, however, a series of studies substantially changed this picture and demonstrated that black carbon as well as the organic soot components continued to be a large component in urban aerosols across the United States and Europe&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Novakov | first1 = T. | last2 = Chang | first2 = S.G. | last3 = Harker | first3 = A.B. | year = 1974 | title = Sulfates as pollution particulates:Catalytic formationon carbon(soot) particles | url = | journal = Science | volume = 186 | issue = | pages = 259–261 | doi=10.1126/science.186.4160.259|bibcode = 1974Sci...186..259N | pmid=17782021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = S.G. | last2 = Novakov | first2 = T. | year = 1975 | title = Formation of pollution particulate nitrogen compounds by NO-soot and NH3-soot gas particle surface reactions | url = | journal = Atmos.

In the less-developed regions of the world where there were limited or no controls on soot emissions the air quality continued to degrade as the population increased.  It was not generally realized until many years later that from the perspective of global effects the emissions from these regions were extremely important.

===Influence on Earth's atmosphere===
Most of the developments mentioned above relate to air quality in urban atmospheres. The first indications of the role of black carbon in a larger, global context came from studies of the Arctic Haze phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell. J.M., Visual Range in the polar regions with particular reference to the Alaskan Arctic, ''J. Almos. Terr. Phys.'', suppl., 195-211, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;  Black carbon was identified in the Arctic haze aerosols&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = H. | last2 = Novakov | first2 = T. | last3 = Bodhaine | first3 = B. | year = 1981 | title = Soot in the Arctic | url = | journal = Atmos.

In general, aerosol particles can affect the radiation balance leading to a cooling or heating effect with the magnitude and sign of the temperature change largely dependent on aerosol optical properties, aerosol concentrations, and the albedo of the underlying surface.  A purely scattering aerosol will reflect energy that would normally be absorbed by the earth-atmosphere system back to space and leads to a cooling effect. As one adds an absorbing component to the aerosol, it can lead to a heating of the earth-atmosphere system if the reflectivity of the underlying surface is sufficiently high.

Early studies of the effects of aerosols on atmospheric radiative transfer on a global scale assumed a dominantly scattering aerosol with only a small absorbing component, since this appears to be a good representation of naturally occurring aerosols. However, as discussed above, urban aerosols have a large black carbon component and if these particles can be transported on a global scale then one would expect a heating effect over surfaces with a high surface albedo like snow or ice.  Furthermore, if these particles are deposited in the snow an additional heating effect would occur due to reductions in the surface albedo.

===Measuring and modeling spatial distribution===
Levels of Black carbon are most often determined based on the modification of the optical properties of a fiber filter by deposited particles. Either filter transmittance, filter reflectance or a combination of transmittance and reflectance is measured. [[Aethalometers]] are frequently used devices that optically detect the changing absorption of light transmitted through a filter ticket. The USEPA Environmental Technology Verification program evaluated both the Aethalometer &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=EPA|first=|date=February 2014|title=ETV Joint Verification Statement|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/P100MH5J.PDF?Dockey=P100MH5J.PDF|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also the Sunset Laboratory thermal-optical analyzer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.epa.gov/nrmrl/archive-etv/web/html/vt-ams.html#bcm]&lt;/ref&gt; A multiangle absorption photometer takes into account both transmitted and reflected light.  Alternative methods rely on satellite based measurements of optical depth for large areas or more recently on spectral noise analysis for very local concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dekoninck | first1 = L. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = An instantaneous spatiotemporal model to predict a bicyclist's Black Carbon exposure based on mobile noise measurements | url = | journal = Atmospheric Environment | volume =  79| issue = | pages =  623–631| doi = 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.06.054 | bibcode = 2013AtmEn..79..623D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s and early 1980s surprisingly large ground level concentrations of black carbon were observed throughout the western Arctic.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt; Modeling studies indicated that they could lead to heating over polar ice. One of the major uncertainties in modeling the effects of the Arctic haze on the solar radiation balance was limited knowledge of the vertical distributions of black carbon.

During 1983 and 1984 as part of the [[NOAA]] AGASP program, the first measurements of such distributions in the Arctic atmosphere were obtained with an [[aethalometer]] which had the capability of measuring black carbon on a real-time basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = A.D.A. | last2 = Rosen | first2 = H. | last3 = Novakov | first3 = T. | year = 1984 | title = The Aethalometer: an instrument for real-time measurement of optical absorption by aerosol particles | url = | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 191–196 | doi=10.1016/0048-9697(84)90265-1| bibcode = 1984ScTEn..36..191H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These measurements showed substantial concentrations of black carbon found throughout the western Arctic troposphere including the North Pole.  The vertical profiles showed either a strongly layered structure or an almost uniform distribution up to eight kilometers with concentrations within layers as large as those found at ground level in typical mid-latitude urban areas in the United States.&lt;ref name=Rosen2&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = H. | last2 = Hansen | first2 = A.D.A. | last3 = Novakov | first3 = T. | year = 1984 | title = Role of graphitic carbon particles in radiative transfer in the Arctic haze | url = | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 103–110 | doi=10.1016/0048-9697(84)90253-5| bibcode = 1984ScTEn..36..103R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The absorption [[optical depth]]s associated with these vertical profiles were large as evidenced by a vertical profile over the Norwegian arctic where absorption optical depths of 0.023 to 0.052 were calculated respectively for external and internal mixtures of black carbon with the other aerosol components.&lt;ref name=Rosen2/&gt;

===Presence in soils===
Up to 30% of the total carbon stored in soils is contributed by black carbon.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Especially for tropical soils black carbon serves as a reservoir for nutrients. Experiments showed that soils without high amounts of black carbon are significantly less fertile than soils that contain black carbon. An example for this increased soil fertility are the [[Terra preta]] soils of central Amazonia, which are presumably human-made by pre-Columbian native populations. Terra Preta soils have on average three times higher soil organic matter (SOM) content, higher nutrient levels and a better nutrient retention capacity than surrounding infertile soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glaser | first1 = B. | last2 = Haumaier | first2 = L. | last3 = Guggenberger | first3 = G. | last4 = Zech | first4 = W. | year = 2001 | title = The 'Terra preta' phenomenon: a model for sustainable agriculture in the humid tropics | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 88 | issue = | pages = 37–41 | doi=10.1007/s001140000193|bibcode = 2001NW.....88...37G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the [[slash and burn]] agricultural practice used in tropical regions does not only enhance productivity by releasing nutrients from the burned vegetation but also by adding black carbon to the soil. Nonetheless, for a sustainable management, a [[slash-and-char]] practice would be better in order to prevent high emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and volatile black carbon. Furthermore, the positive effects of this type of agriculture are counteracted if used for large patches so that soil erosion is not prevented by the vegetation.

==Emission sources==

===By region===
Developed countries were once the primary source of black carbon emissions, but this began to change in the 1950s with the adoption of pollution control technologies in those countries.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 1, at 221 ("Until about the 1950s, North America and Western Europe were the major sources of soot emissions, but now developing nations in the tropics and East Asia are the major source problem.").&lt;/ref&gt;   Whereas the United States emits about 21% of the world’s CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it emits 6.1% of the world’s soot.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 9, at 4&lt;/ref&gt;  The European Union and United States might further reduce their black carbon emissions by accelerating implementation of black carbon regulations that currently take effect in 2015 or 2020&lt;ref&gt;Clean Air Fine Particle Implementation Rule, 72 Fed. Reg. 20586, 20587 (April 25, 2007) (to be codified as 40 C.F.R. pt. 51), ''available at''http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-AIR/2007/April/Day-25/a6347.pdf; Press Release, European Union, Environment: Commission welcomes final adoption of the air quality directive, (April 14, 2008), ''available at'' http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/570&amp;type = HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en.&lt;/ref&gt; and by supporting the adoption of pending International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations.&lt;ref&gt;International Maritime Organization, Press Release, IMO Environment meeting Approves Revised Regulations on Ship Emissions, International Maritime Organization (4 April 2008),'' available at''http://www.imo.org/About/mainframe.asp?topic_id=1709&amp;doc_id=9123(The IMO has approved amendments to MARPOL Annex VI Regulations for the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships which are now subject to adoption at an October 2008  meeting.).&lt;/ref&gt; Existing regulations also could be expanded to increase the use of clean diesel and [[clean coal technology|clean coal technologies]] and to develop second-generation technologies.

Today, the majority of black carbon emissions are from developing countries&lt;ref&gt;Tami Bond, Testimony for the Hearing on Black Carbon and Climate Change, U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform 2-3 (October 18, 2007), ''available at''http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/documents/20071018110647.pdf [hereinafter Bond Testimony]&lt;/ref&gt; and this trend is expected to increase.&lt;ref name="Reference Jacobson"&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 9, at 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest sources of black carbon are Asia, Latin America, and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Tami Bond, ''Summary: Aerosols'', Air Pollution as a Climate Forcing: A Workshop, Honolulu, Hawaii, April 29-May 3, 2002, ''available at'' http://www.giss.nasa.gov/meetings/pollution2002/&lt;/ref&gt;  China and India together account for 25-35% of global black carbon emissions.&lt;ref name="Ramanathan"&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael,'' supra'' note 1, at 226&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon emissions from China doubled from 2000 to 2006.&lt;ref name="Ramanathan" /&gt;  Existing and well-tested technologies used by developed countries, such as clean diesel and clean coal, could be transferred to developing countries to reduce their emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Ramanathan Testimony,'' supra'' note 4, at 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Black carbon emissions are highest in and around major source regions. This results in regional hotspots of atmospheric solar heating due to black carbon.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 1, at 221&lt;/ref&gt;  Hotspot areas include:&lt;ref name="V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, id"&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, id&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Indo-Gangetic plains of India
* eastern China 
* most of Southeast Asia and Indonesia 
* equatorial regions of Africa 
* Mexico and Central America 
* most of Brazil and Peru in South America.

Approximately three billion people live in these hotspots.&lt;ref name="V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, id"/&gt;

[[File:Tahmand alumiiniumpott.JPG|thumb|Black carbon on a cooking pot. Result of a biofuel cooking.]]
Approximately 20% of black carbon is emitted from burning biofuels, 40% from fossil fuels, and 40% from open biomass burning.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''id.'' at 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar estimates of the sources of black carbon emissions are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;See Bond Testimony, ''supra'' note 42, at 2 (figure 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

*42%    Open biomass burning (forest and savanna burning)
*18%	Residential biofuel burned with traditional technologies
*14%	[[Diesel exhaust|Diesel engines]] for transportation
*10%	[[Diesel exhaust|Diesel engines]] for industrial use
*10% 	Industrial processes and power generation, usually from smaller boilers
*6%	Residential [[coal]] burned with traditional technologies&lt;ref&gt;Bond Testimony,'' id.'' at 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black carbon sources vary by region.  For example, the majority of soot emissions in South Asia are due to biofuel cooking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Venkataraman | first1 = C. | last2 = Habib | first2 = G. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2005 | title = Residential Biofuels in South Asia: Carbonaceous Aerosol Emissions and Climate Impacts | url = | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5714| pages = 1454–1456 | doi=10.1126/science.1104359|bibcode = 2005Sci...307.1454V | pmid=15746423}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in East Asia, coal combustion for residential and industrial uses plays a larger role. In Western Europe, traffic seems to be the most important source since high concentrations coincide with proximity to major roads or participation to (motorized) traffic.&lt;ref name="Dons et al."&gt;{{cite journal

Fossil fuel and biofuel soot have significantly greater amounts of black carbon than climate-cooling aerosols and particulate matter, making reductions of these sources particularly powerful mitigation strategies. For example, emissions from the diesel engines and marine vessels contain higher levels of black carbon compared to other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 13, at 5-6 (showing that shipping emissions produce more than 3 times as much black carbon as POC, while off-road vehicles produce 40% more black carbon than POC, and on-road vehicles produce 25-60% more black carbon than POC).&lt;/ref&gt;  Regulating black carbon emissions from diesel engines and marine vessels therefore presents a significant opportunity to reduce black carbon’s global warming impact.&lt;ref&gt;Although shipping only accounts for 1.7% of the global black carbon inventory, given the expected increase in shipping throughout regions especially sensitive to black carbon like the Arctic, it still represents a strong option for black carbon reductions.  Lack, D., B. Lerner, C. Granier, T. Baynard, E. Lovejoy, P. Massoli, A. R. Ravishankara, and E. Williams, Light absorbing carbon emissions from commercial shipping, 35 Geophysical Res. Letters L13815 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomass burning emits greater amounts of climate-cooling [[aerosol]]s and particulate matter than black carbon, resulting in short-term cooling.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen et al., ''Efficacy of Climate Forcing'', ''supra'' note 27&lt;/ref&gt;  However, over the long-term, biomass burning may cause a net warming when CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and deforestation are considered.&lt;ref&gt;Mark. Z. Jacobson, ''The Short-Term Cooling but Long-Term Global Warming Due to Biomass Burning'', 17 ''Journal of Climate'' 2909, 2923 (". . . whereas aerosol particles emitted during burning may cause a short-term cooling of global climate, longer-lived greenhouse gases may cause warming (or cancel the cooling) after several decades. As such, reducing biomass burning may cause short-term warming but long-term cooling or no change in temperature. Although the eventual cooling may not appear for many years, its magnitude may be as large as 0.6 K after 100 yr.").&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing biomass emissions would therefore reduce global warming in the long-term and provide co-benefits of reduced air pollution, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, and deforestation.  It has been estimated that by switching to [[slash-and-char]] from [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture, which turns biomass into ash using open fires that release black carbon&lt;ref&gt;Surabi Menon, James Hansen, Larissa Nazarenko, &amp; Yunfeng Luo,''Climate Effects of Black Carbon'', 297 SCIENCE 2250, 2250 (27 September 2002) (Black Carbon emissions are "a product of incomplete combustion from coal, diesel engines, biofuels, and outdoor biomass burning . . .").&lt;/ref&gt; and GHGs,&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, et al., ''Bio-Char Sequestration in Terrestrial Ecosystems – A Review'', 11 MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE 403, at 403-07, 418 (Springer 2006), ''available at http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/publ/MitAdaptStratGlobChange%2011,%20403-427,%20Lehmann,%202006.pdf ; See id.'' at 407 (Researchers estimate that between 38-84% of the biomass carbon in vegetation is released during the burn, whereas converting the biomass into bio-char by means of simple kiln techniques sequesters more than 50% of this carbon in bio-char).&lt;/ref&gt; 12% of anthropogenic carbon emissions caused by land use change could be reduced annually,&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 407-08&lt;/ref&gt; which is approximately 0.66 Gt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq. per year, or 2% of all annual global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Raupach, Michael, et al., ''Global and Regional Drivers of Accelerating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Emissions'', 104 [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] 24, (underlying data available at http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0700609104/DC1) (indicating that between 2000 and 2005 land use emissions annually represented on average 1.5 GtC of the total 8.7 GtC global emissions or 5.5 Gt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; eq. of 31.9 Gt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; eq. of global emissions—17.25% of total.

Lehmann’s original estimates were based on a 0.2 GtC offset of the 1.7 GtC emissions from land use change estimated in 2001 by the IPCC''). See also'' Lehmann, ''et al.'', ''supra'' note 49, at 407-08. (Given the increase in fossil fuel emissions to 8.4 GtC, total anthropogenic emissions in 2006, including the estimated 1.5 GtC from land use change, were 9.9 GtC. Thus, despite an increase in overall CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; eq. emissions, using Lehmann’s original 0.2 GtC reduction still results in an approximate 2% reduction in global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; eq. emissions).

==Impacts==
Black carbon is a form of ultrafine [[particulate matter]], which when released in the air causes premature human mortality and disability.  In addition, atmospheric black carbon changes the radiative energy balance of the climate system in a way that raises air and surface temperatures, causing a variety of detrimental environmental impacts on humans, on agriculture, and on plant and animal ecosystems.

===Public health impacts===
Particulate matter is the most harmful to public health of all air pollutants in Europe. Black carbon particulate matter contains very fine [[carcinogen]]s and is therefore particularly harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/black-carbon-better-monitoring-needed|title=Black carbon: Better monitoring needed to assess health and climate change impacts|website=European Environment Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that from 640,000 to 4,900,000 premature human deaths could be prevented every year by utilizing available mitigation measures to reduce black carbon in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinhold|first=Bob|title=Global Bang for the Buck: Cutting Black Carbon and Methane Benefits Both Health and Climate|journal=Environ. Health Perspect.|date=June 2012|volume=120|page=a245| pmc=3385456|pmid=22659132|doi=10.1289/ehp.120-a245b|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans are exposed to black carbon by inhalation of air in the immediate vicinity of local sources. Important indoor sources include candles and biomass burning whereas traffic and occasionally forest fires are the major outdoor sources of black carbon exposure. Concentrations of black carbon decrease sharply with increasing distance from (traffic) sources which makes it an atypical component of [[particulate matter]]. This makes it difficult to estimate exposure of populations. For particulate matter epidemiological studies have traditionally relied on single fixed site measurements or inferred residential concentrations.&lt;ref name="Dons et al. 2013 hourly"&gt;{{cite journal

The public health benefits of reduction in the amount of soot and other particulate matter has been recognized for years.

In fact, public health concerns have given rise to leading to many efforts to reduce such emissions, for example, from diesel vehicles and cooking stoves.

===Climate impacts===
'''Direct effect''' Black carbon particles directly absorb sunlight and reduce the planetary albedo when suspended in the atmosphere.

'''Semi-direct effect''' Black carbon absorb incoming solar radiation, perturb the temperature structure of the atmosphere, and influence cloud cover. They may either increase or decrease cloud cover under different conditions.&lt;ref name="Koch and Del Genio, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koch|first=D.|author2=A.D.Del Genio|title=Black carbon semi-direct effects on cloud cover: review and synthesis|journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics|date=2010|volume=10|pages=7685–7696|doi=10.5194/acp-10-7685-2010|url=http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/10/7685/2010/acp-10-7685-2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Snow/ice albedo effect''' When deposited on high albedo surfaces like ice and snow, black carbon particles reduce the total surface albedo available to reflect solar energy back into space. Small initial snow albedo reduction may have a large forcing because of a positive feedback: Reduced snow albedo would increase surface temperature. The increased surface temperature would decrease the snow cover and further decrease surface albedo.&lt;ref name=JGR032612&gt;{{cite journal|author1=T. C. Bond|author2=S. J. Doherty |author3=D. W.

'''Indirect effect''' Black carbon may also indirectly cause changes in the absorption or reflection of solar radiation through changes in the properties and behavior of clouds. Research scheduled for publication in 2013 shows black carbon plays a role second only to carbon dioxide in climate change. Effects are complex, resulting from a variety of factors, but due to the short life of black carbon in the atmosphere, about a week as compared to carbon dioxide which last centuries, control of black carbon offers possible opportunities for slowing, or even reversing, climate change.&lt;ref name=JGR032612/&gt;&lt;!--{{cite journal|author2=S.

====Radiative forcing====
Estimates of black carbon’s globally averaged direct radiative forcing vary from the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]’s estimate of + 0.34 watts per square meter (W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ± 0.25,&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, ''Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing'', in CLIMATE CHANGE 2007: THE PHYSICAL SCIENCE BASIS.  CONTRIBUTION OF WORKING GROUP I TO THE FOURTH ASSESSMENT REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE 129, 132 (2007), available at http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-wg1.htm. (Magnitudes and uncertainties added together, as per standard uncertainty rules)&lt;/ref&gt;  to a more recent estimate by V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael of 0.9 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ramanathan_a"&gt;V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael, ''Global and regional climate changes due to black carbon'', 1 NATURE GEOSCIENCE  221-22 (23 March 2008) ("The BC forcing of 0.9 W m–2 (with a range of 0.4 to 1.2 W m–2) … is as much as 55% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other GHGs such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CFCs, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or tropospheric ozone.")&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPCC also estimated the globally averaged snow albedo effect of black carbon at +0.1 ± 0.1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Based on the IPCC estimate, it would be reasonable to conclude that the combined direct and indirect snow albedo effects for black carbon rank it as the third largest contributor to globally averaged positive radiative forcing since the pre-industrial period. In comparison, the more recent direct radiative forcing estimate by Ramanathan and Carmichael &lt;ref name="Ramanathan_a" /&gt; would lead one to conclude that black carbon has contributed the second largest globally averaged radiative forcing after carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and that the radiative forcing of black carbon is “as much as 55% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other greenhouse gasses (GHGs) such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CFCs, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, or tropospheric ozone.”

====Effects on Arctic ice and Himalayan glaciers====
According to the {{abbr|IPCC|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}}, “the presence of black carbon over highly reflective surfaces, such as snow and ice, or clouds, may cause a significant positive radiative forcing.”&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, ''supra'' note 13, at 397. ("While the radiative forcing is generally negative, positive forcing occurs in areas with a very high surface reflectance such as desert regions in North Africa, and the snow fields of the Himalayas."); J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''supra'' note 14, at 425. (The brown haze over India, heavy with fossil fuel and biofuel soot, reaches to the Himalayas. If prevailing winds deposit even a fraction of this soot on glaciers, the snow black carbon content could be comparable to that in the Alps.").&lt;/ref&gt;  The IPCC also notes that emissions from [[biomass]] burning, which usually have a negative forcing,&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen, et al., ''Efficacy of Climate Forcing'', 110 J. GEOPHYS. RES. D18104, 1 (2005), ''available at'' {{cite web |url=http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2005/2005_Hansen_etal_2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022162835/http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2005/2005_Hansen_etal_2.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-22 |df= }} (Accounting for forcing efficacies and for indirect effects via snow albedo and cloud changes, we find that fossil fuel soot, defined as black carbon + OC (organic carbon), has a net positive forcing while biomass burning black carbon + OC has a negative forcing).&lt;/ref&gt;  have a positive forcing over snow fields in areas such as the Himalayas.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, ''supra'' note 13, at 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Charles Zender, black carbon is a significant contributor to Arctic ice-melt, and reducing such emissions may be “the most efficient way to mitigate Arctic warming that we know of”.&lt;ref&gt;Zender Testimony, ''supra''note 3, at 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The “climate forcing due to snow/ice albedo change is of the order of 1.0&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at middle- and high-latitude land areas in the Northern Hemisphere and over the Arctic Ocean.”&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko,''supra'' note 14, at 425.&lt;/ref&gt;  The “soot effect on snow albedo may be responsible for a quarter of observed global warming.”&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''id.'' at 428&lt;/ref&gt; “Soot deposition increases surface melt on ice masses, and the meltwater spurs multiple radiative and dynamical feedback processes that accelerate ice disintegration,” according to [[NASA]] scientists James Hansen and Larissa Nazarenko.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko,''id.'' at 425&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this feedback process, “BC on snow warms the planet about three times more than an equal forcing of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.”&lt;ref&gt;See ''supra'' note 18&lt;/ref&gt;  When black carbon concentrations in the Arctic increase during the winter and spring due to [[Arctic Haze]], surface temperatures increase by 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;P.K.

Black carbon emissions from northern Eurasia, North America, and Asia have the greatest absolute impact on Arctic warming.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Quinn,''supra'' note 34, at 1732.&lt;/ref&gt; However, black carbon emissions actually occurring within the Arctic have a disproportionately larger impact per particle on Arctic warming than emissions originating elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Quinn, ''id''&lt;/ref&gt; As Arctic ice melts and shipping activity increases, emissions originating within the Arctic are expected to rise.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Quinn, ''id.'' at 1732; J. Hansen &amp; M. Sato,''et al.'', ''Dangerous Human-Made Interference with Climate: a GISS modelE Study 7'' ATMOS. CHEM. PHYS. DISCUSS. 2287, 2298, 2296 (2007)("We suggest that Arctic climate change has been driven as much by pollutants (03, its precursors CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and soot) as by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;... Thus, in that case, reduction of some of the pollutants [including soot] may make it possible to keep further Arctic warming very small and thus probably avoid loss of all sea ice.")&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global warming===
In its 2007 report, the IPCC estimated for the first time the direct [[radiative forcing]] of black carbon from fossil fuel emissions at +&amp;nbsp;0.2&amp;nbsp;W/m², and the radiative forcing of black carbon through its effect on the surface albedo of snow and ice at an additional +&amp;nbsp;0.1&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, ''Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing'', in CLIMATE CHANGE 2007: THE PHYSICAL SCIENCE BASIS.

Since 1950, many countries have significantly reduced black carbon emissions, especially from fossil fuel sources, primarily to improve public health from improved air quality, and “technology exists for a drastic reduction of fossil fuel related BC” throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan, Testimony for the Hearing on Black Carbon and Climate Change, U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform 4 (18 October 2007), ''available at ''http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/documents/20071018110734.pdf [hereinafter Ramanathan Testimony] (The developed nations have reduced their black carbon emissions from fossil fuel sources by a factor of 5 or more.

Given black carbon’s relatively short lifespan, reducing black carbon emissions would reduce warming within weeks. Because black carbon remains in the atmosphere only for a few weeks, reducing black carbon emissions may be the fastest means of slowing climate change in the near term.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/science/earth/16degrees.html "Third-World Stove Soot Is Target in Climate Fight"] article by Elizabeth Rosenthal in ''[[The New York Times]]'' April 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Control of black carbon, particularly from fossil-fuel and biofuel sources, is very likely to be the fastest method of slowing global warming in the immediate future,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Mark Z.

“Emissions of black carbon are the second strongest contribution to current global warming, after carbon dioxide emissions”.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 1, at 221 (". . . emissions of black carbon are the second strongest contribution to current global warming, after carbon dioxide emissions.") Numerous scientists also calculate that black carbon may be second only to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in its contribution to climate change, including Tami C. Bond &amp; Haolin Sun, ''Can Reducing Black Carbon Emissions Counteract Global Warming'', ENVIRON. SCI. TECHN. (2005), at 5921 ("BC is the second or third largest individual warming agent, following carbon dioxide and methane."); ''and'' J. Hansen, ''A Brighter Future'', 53 CLIMATE CHANGE 435 (2002), ''available at'' http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2002/2002_Hansen_1.pdf (calculating the climate forcing of BC at 1.0±0.5 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/ref&gt; Calculation of black carbon’s combined climate forcing at 1.0–1.2&amp;nbsp;W/m², which “is as much as 55% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other [GHGs] such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CFCs, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or tropospheric ozone.” &lt;ref&gt;V.

Consequently, the "efficacy" of black carbon/snow forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.").&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobson calculates that reducing fossil fuel and biofuel soot particles would eliminate about 40% of the net observed global warming.&lt;ref&gt;Gross global warming should result in about 2&amp;nbsp;°C (4&amp;nbsp;°F) temperature rise. However, observed global warming is only about 0.8 °C because cooling particles off set much of the warming. Reducing fossil fuel and biofuel soot would reduce about 40% of the observed warming and about 16% of the gross warming.  Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 13, at 3. ("The figure also shows that fossil-fuel plus biofuel soot may contribute to about 16% of gross global warming (warming due to all greenhouse gases plus soot plus the heat island effect), but its control in isolation could reduce 40% of net global warming.").&lt;/ref&gt;  (See Figure 1.) In addition to black carbon, fossil fuel and biofuel soot contain aerosols and particulate matter that cool the planet by reflecting the sun’s radiation away from the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''id.'' at 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the aerosols and particulate matter are accounted for, fossil fuel and biofuel soot are increasing temperatures by about 0.35&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''id''&lt;/ref&gt;

Black carbon alone is estimated to have a 20-year [[Global Warming Potential]] (GWP) of 4,470, and a 100-year GWP of 1,055–2,240.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''id.''  As an aerosol, there is not standardized formula for developing global warming potentials (GWP) for black carbon. However, attempts to derive GWP100 range from 190 – 2240 relative to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The Integrated Assessment of Black Carbon and Tropospheric Ozone published in 2011 by the United Nations Environment Programme and World Meteorological Organization calculates that cutting black carbon, along with tropospheric ozone and its precursor, methane, can reduce the rate of global warming by half and the rate of warming in the Arctic by two-thirds, in combination with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cuts. By trimming “peak warming”, such cuts can keep current global temperature rise below 1.5&amp;nbsp;˚C for 30 years and below 2&amp;nbsp;˚C for 60 years, in combination with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cuts.

The reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well as SLCFs could keep global temperature rise under 1.5&amp;nbsp;˚C through 2030, and below 2&amp;nbsp;˚C through 2070, assuming CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is also cut.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; See the graph on page 12 of the [http://www.unep.org/dewa/Portals/67/pdf/Black_Carbon.pdf UNEP-WMO report].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Control technologies==
Ramanathan notes that “developed nations have reduced their black carbon emissions from fossil fuel sources by a factor of 5 or more since 1950.  Thus, the technology exists for a drastic reduction of fossil fuel related black carbon.” &lt;ref&gt;Ramanathan Testimony, ''supra'' note 4, at 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobson believes that “[g]iven proper conditions and incentives, [soot] polluting technologies can be quickly phased out.  In some small-scale applications (such as domestic cooking in developing countries), health and convenience will drive such a transition when affordable, reliable alternatives are available.  For other sources, such as vehicles or coal boilers, regulatory approaches may be required to nudge either the transition to existing technology or the development of new technology.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Hansen states that “technology is within reach that could greatly reduce soot, restoring snow albedo to near pristine values, while having multiple other benefits for climate, human health, agricultural productivity, and environmental aesthetics.  Already soot emissions from coal are decreasing in many regions with transition from small users to power plants with scrubbers.”&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko,''supra'' note 14, at 428&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobson suggests converting “[U.S.] vehicles from fossil fuel to electric, plug-in-hybrid, or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, where the electricity or hydrogen is produced by a renewable energy source, such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, wave, or tidal power.  Such a conversion would eliminate 160 Gg/yr (24%) of U.S. (or 1.5% of world) fossil-fuel soot and about 26% of U.S. (or 5.5% of world) carbon dioxide.”&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 9, at 9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacobson’s estimates, this proposal would reduce soot and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 1.63 GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–eq. per year.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson offers an estimate of total U.S. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in 2005 of 6270 metric tonnes, 26% of which is 1630.'' Id.''&lt;/ref&gt; He notes, however, “that the elimination of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides would also eliminate some cooling particles, reducing the net benefit by at most, half, but improving human health,” a substantial reduction for one policy in one country.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 9, at 9&lt;/ref&gt;

For diesel vehicles in particular there are several effective technologies available.&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association (MECA), "Emission Control Technologies for Diesel-Powered Vehicles," 9  (December 2007) ("Diesel oxidation catalysts installed on a vehicle’s exhaust system can reduce total PM typically by as much as 25 to over 50 percent by mass, under some conditions depending on the composition of the PM being emitted"), available at:http://www.meca.org/galleries/default-file/MECA%20Diesel%20White%20Paper%2012-07-07%20final.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Newer, more efficient [[diesel particulate filter]]s (DPFs), or traps, can eliminate over 90% of black carbon emissions,&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', ("DPFs can achieve up to, and in some cases, greater than a 90 percent reduction in PM. High efficiency filters are extremely effective in controlling the carbon fraction of the particulate, the portion of the particulate that some health experts believe may be the PM component of greatest concern").&lt;/ref&gt; but these devices require [[ultra-low sulfur diesel]] fuel (ULSD).  To ensure compliance with new particulate rules for new on-road and non-road vehicles in the U.S., the EPA first required a nationwide shift to ULSD, which allowed DPFs to be used in diesel vehicles in order to meet the standards.  Because of recent EPA regulations, black carbon emissions from diesel vehicles are expected to decline about 70 percent from 2001 to 2020.”&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', at 5, ("Mobile source black carbon emissions are estimated at 234 Gg in 2001, representing 54 percent of the nationwide black carbon emissions of 436 Gg.  Under Scenario F, mobile source emissions are projected to decline to 71 Gg, a reduction of 163 Gg."&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, “BC emissions in the United States are projected to decline by 42 percent from 2001 to 2020.&lt;ref&gt;Bahner, Mark A., Weitz, Keith A., Zapata, Alexandra and DeAngelo, Benjamin, Use of Black Carbon and Organic Carbon Inventories for Projections and Mitigation Analysis," 1, (2007) available at: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/conference/ei16/session3/k.weitz.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the full fleet is subject to these rules, EPA estimates that over 239,000 tons of particulate matter will be reduced annually.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Heavy-Duty Highway Diesel Program, available at: http://www.epa.gov/oms/highway-diesel/index.htm ("Once this action is fully implemented…Soot or particulate matter will be reduced by 110,000 tons a year"); EPA, Clean Air Nonroad Diesel Rule—Facts and Figures, available at: http://www.epa.gov/nonroad-diesel/2004fr/420f04037.htm ("Environmental Benefits When the Fleet of Older Nonroad Engines Has Fully Turned Over by 2030: Annual reductions of Fine PM (PM2.5): 129,000 tons").&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the US diesel oxidation catalysts are often available and DPFs will become available as ULSD is more widely commercialized.

Another technology for reducing black carbon emissions from diesel engines is to shift fuels to compressed natural gas. In [[New Delhi]], India, the [[supreme court]] ordered shift to compressed natural gas for all public transport vehicles, including buses, taxis, and rickshaws, resulted in a climate benefit, “largely because of the dramatic reduction of black carbon emissions from the diesel bus engines.”&lt;ref&gt;Conor C. O. Reynolds &amp; Milind Kandlikar, ''Climate Impacts of Air Quality Policy: Switching to a Natural Gas-Fueled Public Transportation System in New Delhi'', ENVIRON. SCI. TECHNOL. (forthcoming 2008) ("When aerosol emissions are included, the switch to CNG fueling results in a climate benefit, largely because of the dramatic reduction of black carbon emissions from the diesel bus engines"). The fuel switching policy was implemented with the aid of the Indian Supreme Court.  ''See'' Urvashi Narain and Ruth Greenspan Bell, ''Who Changed Delhi’s Air? The Roles of the Court and the Executive in Environmental Policymaking'', Resources for the Future Discussion Paper 05-48 (December 2005) http://www.rff.org/rff/documents/rff-dp-05-48.pdf ("[T]he main role of the Supreme Court was to force the government to implement previously announced policies. … [T]he Delhi experience for instituting change has become a model for other Indian cities as well as neighboring countries.")&lt;/ref&gt;  Overall, the fuel switch for the vehicles reduced black carbon emissions enough to produce a 10 percent net reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq., and perhaps as much as 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Conor C. O. Reynolds &amp; Milind Kandlikar, ''Climate Impacts of Air Quality Policy: Switching to a Natural Gas-Fueled Public Transportation System in New Delhi'', ENVIRON. SCI. TECHNOL. (forthcoming 2008) ("However, when aerosol emissions are taken into account in our model, the net effect of the switch is estimated to be a 10% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e), and there may be as much as a 30% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e)").&lt;/ref&gt; The main gains were from diesel bus engines whose CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq. emissions were reduced 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', at Section 3.1 ("In total there is about a 10% reduction of net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e) emissions, and if buses are considered separately, net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e) emissions are reduced by about 20%").&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a study examining these emissions reductions, “there is a significant potential for emissions reductions through the [UNFCCC] Clean Development for such fuel switching projects.”&lt;ref&gt;C. O. Reynolds &amp; Milind Kandlikar, ''Climate Impacts of Air Quality Policy: Switching to a Natural Gas-Fueled Public Transportation System in New Delhi'', 1, ENVIRON. SCI. TECHNOL. (forthcoming 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Technologies are also in development to reduce some of the 133,000 metric tons of particulate matter emitted each year from ships.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, D., B. Lerner, C. Granier, T. Baynard, E. Lovejoy, P. Massoli, A. R. Ravishankara, and E. Williams, ''Light absorbing carbon emissions from commercial shipping'', 35 Geophysical Res. Letters L13815 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ocean vessels use diesel engines, and particulate filters similar to those in use for land vehicles are now being tested on them.  As with current particulate filters these too would require the ships to use ULSD, but if comparable emissions reductions are attainable, up to 120,000 metric tons of particulate emissions could be eliminated each year from international shipping. That is, if particulate filters could be shown reduce black carbon emissions 90 percent from ships as they do for land vehicles, 120,000 metric tons of today’s 133,000 metric tons of emissions would be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;That is, if particulate filters could be shown reduce black carbon emissions 90 percent from ships as they do for land vehicles, 120,000 metric tons of today’s 133,000 metric tons of emissions would be prevented.&lt;/ref&gt; Other efforts can reduce the amount of black carbon emissions from ships simply by decreasing the amount of fuel the ships use.  By traveling at slower speeds or by using shore side electricity when at port instead of running the ship’s diesel engines for electric power, ships can save fuel and reduce emissions.

Reynolds and Kandlikar estimate that the shift to [[compressed natural gas]] for public transport in New Delhi ordered by the Supreme Court reduced climate emissions by 10 to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Conor C. O. Reynolds &amp; Milind Kandlikar, ''Climate Impacts of Air Quality Policy: Switching to a Natural Gas-Fueled Public Transportation System in New Delhi'', ENVIRON. SCI. TECHNOL. (forthcoming 2008) ("Between 2001 and 2003, public transport vehicles in New Delhi were required to switch their fuel to natural gas in an attempt to reduce their air pollution impacts. …[W]hen [black carbon and other] aerosol emissions are taken into account in our model, the net effect of the switch is estimated to be a 10% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (eq), and there may be as much as a 30% reduction…. There is a significant potential for emissions reductions through the [UNFCCC] Clean Development for such fuel switching projects.") The fuel switching policy was implemented with the aid of the Indian Supreme Court. See Urvashi Narain and Ruth Greenspan Bell, ''Who Changed Delhi’s Air? The Roles of the Court and the Executive in Environmental Policymaking,'' Resources for the Future Discussion Paper 05-48 (December 2005) http://www.rff.org/rff/documents/rff-dp-05-48.pdf ("[T]he main role of the Supreme Court was to force the government to implement previously announced policies. … [T]he Delhi experience for instituting change has become a model for other Indian cities as well as neighboring countries.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramanathan estimates that “providing alternative energy-efficient and smoke-free cookers and introducing transferring technology for reducing soot emissions from coal combustion in small industries could have major impacts on the radiative forcing due to soot.” &lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 4, at 226.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the impact of replacing biofuel cooking with black carbon-free cookers (solar, bio, and natural gas) in South and East Asia is dramatic: over South Asia, a 70 to 80% reduction in black carbon heating; and in East Asia, a 20 to 40% reduction.”&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodegradation ==

Condensed aromatic ring structures indicate black carbon degradation in soil. [[Saprophytic fungi]] are being researched for their potential role in the degradation of black carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Direct molecular evidence for the degradation and mobility of black carbon in soils from ultrahigh-resolution mass spectral analysis of dissolved organic matter from a fire-impacted forest|journal=Organic Chemistry soil|year=2006|author1=Hockaday WC|author2=Grannas AM|author3=Kim S,|author4=Hatcher PG|volume=37|issue=4|pages=501–510|doi=10.1016/j.orggeochem.2005.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy options==
Many countries have existing national laws to regulate black carbon emissions, including laws that address particulate emissions.  Some examples include:

*banning or regulating slash-and-burn clearing of forests and savannas;
*requiring shore-based power/electrification of ships at port, regulating idling at terminals, and mandating fuel standards for ships seeking to dock at port;
*requiring regular vehicle emissions tests, retirement, or retrofitting (e.g. adding particulate traps&lt;ref&gt;O. Boucher and M.S. Reddy, ''Climate trade-off between black carbon and carbon dioxide emissions'', 36 [[Energy Policy (journal)|ENERGY POLICY]] 193, 196-198 (2007) (Particulate traps on diesel engines reduce black carbon emissions and associated climate forcing but are partially offset by an increase in fuel consumption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Where the fuel penalty is 2-3%, black carbon reductions will produce positive benefits for the climate for the first 28-68 years, assuming reduction in black carbon emission is 0.150.30 g/mile, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions are 15002000 g/mile, and a 100-year GWP of 680 is used for black carbon. The net positive benefits for climate will continue for up to centuries in northern regions because of black carbon's effect on snow and ice albedo).&lt;/ref&gt;), including penalties for failing to meet air quality emissions standards, and heightened penalties for on-the-road "super-emitting" vehicles;
*banning or regulating the sale of certain fuels and/or requiring the use of cleaner fuels for certain uses;

A '''blastema''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''βλάστημα'', "offspring"&lt;ref&gt; Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbla%2Fsthma βλάστημα]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a mass of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s capable of growth and [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] into [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s or body parts. Historically, blastemas were thought to be composed of [[Cellular differentiation|undifferentiated]] [[Cell potency|pluripotent]] cells, but recent research indicates that in some organisms blastemas may retain memory of tissue origin.&lt;ref name="pmid19571878"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kragl M, Knapp D, Nacu E, Khattak S, Maden M, Epperlein HH, Tanaka EM | title = Cells keep a memory of their tissue origin during axolotl limb regeneration | journal = Nature | volume = 460 | issue = 7251 | pages = 60–5 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19571878 | doi = 10.1038/nature08152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blastemas are typically found in the early stages of an [[organism]]'s [[morphogenesis|development]] such as in [[embryo]]s, and in the regeneration of [[biological tissue|tissues]], organs and [[bone]].&lt;ref name="pmid21763617"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tanaka EM, Reddien PW | title = The cellular basis for animal regeneration | journal = Dev. Cell | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 172–85 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21763617 | pmc = 3139400 | doi = 10.1016/j.devcel.2011.06.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some amphibians and certain species of fish and two species of African spiny mice can produce blastemas as adults.&lt;ref name="pmid25043537"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Godwin J | title = The promise of perfect adult tissue repair and regeneration in mammals: Learning from regenerative amphibians and fish | journal = BioEssays | volume = 36 | issue = 9 | pages = 861–71 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25043537 | doi = 10.1002/bies.201300144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[salamander]]s can regenerate many organs after their amputation, including their limbs, tail, [[retina]] and [[intestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | publisher = New York Times
 | date = April 11, 2006 | access-date = February 23, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most animals, however, cannot produce blastemas.

==Limb Regeneration==
When the limb of the salamander is cut off, a layer of [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] covers the surface of the amputation site. In the first few days after the injury, this wounded epidermis transforms into a layer of signaling cells called the [[Regeneration (biology)#Amphibians|Apical Epithelial Cap]] (AEC), which has a vital role in regeneration. In the meantime, [[fibroblasts]] from the connective tissue migrate across the amputation surface to meet at the center of the wound. These fibroblasts multiply to form a blastema, the progenitor for a new limb.&lt;ref name="pmid10706145"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Christensen RN, Tassava RA | title = Apical epithelial cap morphology and fibronectin gene expression in regenerating axolotl limbs | journal = Dev. Dyn. | volume = 217 | issue = 2 | pages = 216–24 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10706145 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0177(200002)217:2&lt;216::AID-DVDY8&gt;3.0.CO;2-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blastema cells can grow in any type of cells but they cannot convert into neurons means axons which are cut can be grown by blastema cells  but if the cell body of the neuron cell is damaged then blastema cells fails to grow new neuron so the neural organs cannot be regenerated

== Blastema Formation ==
[[File:Mechanism_of_neoblast_specification_during_regeneration.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mechanism_of_neoblast_specification_during_regeneration.jpg|thumb|Here is an example mechanism of what happens during neoblast specification during regeneration.]]
As stated above, there are several different types of organisms that can utilize a regenerative blastema as an adult. These organisms include urodele amphibians, zebrafish, and planarian flatworms as major creatures of study. In flatworms, the formation of a blastema needs adult stem cells that are called neoblasts for any type of regeneration to occur.&lt;ref name="pmid18063755"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petersen CP, Reddien PW | title = Smed-betacatenin-1 is required for anteroposterior blastema polarity in planarian regeneration | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5861 | pages = 327–30 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18063755 | doi = 10.1126/science.1149943 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Flatworms use these undifferentiated cells for regeneration after paracrine factors can provide signals from the surface of the wound. The cells in the blastema are also referred to as clonogenic neoblasts (cNeoblasts) that are able to move to the site of the wound and reform the tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Developmental Biology|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|last2=Barresi|first2=Michael J. F.|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc.|year=2016|isbn=|edition=11th|location=Sunderland, Massachusetts|pages=701–702|chapter=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In urodele amphibians, studies suggest that dedifferentiation of cells leads to the formation of a blastema that is able to form multiple tissue types after the amputation of their tails and wound healing occurs.&lt;ref name="pmid11456451"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Echeverri K, Clarke JD, Tanaka EM | title = In vivo imaging indicates muscle fiber dedifferentiation is a major contributor to the regenerating tail blastema | journal = Dev. Biol. | volume = 236 | issue = 1 | pages = 151–64 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11456451 | doi = 10.1006/dbio.2001.0312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15983402"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schnapp E, Kragl M, Rubin L, Tanaka EM | title = Hedgehog signaling controls dorsoventral patterning, blastema cell proliferation and cartilage induction during axolotl tail regeneration | journal = Development | volume = 132 | issue = 14 | pages = 3243–53 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15983402 | doi = 10.1242/dev.01906 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In zebrafish, and in general, it seems as if experts are still uncertain of what truly forms the blastema. However, two common theories that have often been expressed are cell dedifferentiation and the recruitment of stem cells to the wound site.&lt;ref name="pmid12015289"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nechiporuk A, Keating MT | title = A proliferation gradient between proximal and msxb-expressing distal blastema directs zebrafish fin regeneration | journal = Development | volume = 129 | issue = 11 | pages = 2607–17 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12015289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Involved Signaling Pathways ==
There are several different signaling pathways that have been shown to be involved with limb regeneration through the formation of the blastema. In [[flatworms]], studies suggest that after using [[RNA interference]] [[SMAD (protein)|Smad]]-[[beta-catenin]]-1 was found to set up the [[Anatomical terms of location|anterior-posterior axis]]. Inhibitions to this results in reversed polarity across the blastema.&lt;ref name="pmid18063755"/&gt; [[Urodeles]] use [[Hedgehog signaling pathway|hedgehog]] for [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal-ventral patterning]] of their regenerating tail and its surrounding tissue. This was suggested by its inhibition leading to reduced blastemas.&lt;ref name="pmid15983402"/&gt; [[Zebrafish]] seem to use [[Insulin-like growth factor|IGF signalling]] in limb regeneration as its inhibition led to clues of them being required for blastema function.&lt;ref name="pmid20179093"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chablais F, Jazwinska A | title = IGF signaling between blastema and wound epidermis is required for fin regeneration | journal = Development | volume = 137 | issue = 6 | pages = 871–9 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20179093 | doi = 10.1242/dev.043885 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Central Cotton Research Institute Multan''', established in 1976 in [[Multan]], [[Pakistan]], is one of the renowned  research institutes of [[Pakistan]]. The institute has many divisions dedicated to different aspects of cotton research including [[Agronomy]], [[plant breeding|Breeding]] and [[Genetics]], [[Cytogenetics]], [[Physiology]], Fiber Technology, [[Statistics]] and [[Agricultural Engineering]].
Over the years, many achievements have been made in the development of high yielding varieties with standard fibre quality characteristics like staple length, fineness and strength etc. The fine tuning of production technology at the grass-root level of common farming community to the progressive farmers has made tremendous impact on enhancing cotton productivity.

At the time of establishment of the Institute in 1970, the cotton productivity was 370&amp;nbsp;kg per hectare which has now risen to the level of 772&amp;nbsp;kg per hectare during the current year. The continuous and untiring research endeavors of the scientists have yielded 20 cotton varieties (17 Non-Bt and 03 Bt). The introduction of efficient water use technologies i.e. bed-furrow sowing technique, identification of water stress &amp; heat tolerant cotton varieties and other water saving techniques were advocated to the farmers to economize cotton production. 
Salient features of five new varieties viz. CIM-612, Cyto-124, Bt.CIM-600, Bt.CIM-616 and Bt.Cyto-177 were presented in the 71st Meeting of the Expert Sub Committee held at Ayub Agricultural Research Institute, Faisalabad on 09.03.2015. Apart from having up to the standard fibre quality traits, Bt.CIM-600 is tolerant to heat stress whereas Bt.CIM-616, CIM-612 and Bt.Cyto-177 are highly CLCuV tolerant with promising yield potential.

The Institute has made tremendous efforts in popularizing the technology for herbicide use in weed management. The continuous research on screening of weedicides and fine tuning of their application techniques (pre- and post-emergence) is another milestone of this Institute. The quantification of optimized fertilizer levels, application methodologies for efficient utilization and exploring the alternate nutrient sources remained as a continuous endeavor to achieve yield sustainability. The technique of plant mapping, disseminated from this Institute, for forecasting/ estimating yield potential is being practiced by the various research, academia and government departments. 
In the field of plant protection, the invasion of secondary pests like mealybug, dusky cotton bug and red cotton bug are becoming potential threats to achieve yield targets. A due attention is being made to devise pest management strategies to tackle these emerging pests. In the scenario of extended Bt cotton cultivation, the research has been diverted towards this new dimension for controlling sucking pests and studies on resistance management accrued due to inbuilt bollworm resistance in cotton plant. 
The country has suffered huge financial losses due to yield reduction in cotton crop caused by the wide scale infestation of cotton leaf curl virus (CLCuV) disease. Accepting this hard challenge, the scientists at the Institute were able to evolve varieties through introgression that have a high degree of tolerance to CLCuV. A variety Cyto-124, which is recently recommended by Expert Sub Committee, has shown its stability towards virus tolerance in early as well as late sowing (March to June planting). A couple of more promising genotypes (Cyto-120 &amp; Cyto-122) are in pipeline. The contribution in the development of disease resistance is the outcome of continuous involvement by the Pathology Section for quantification and transformation of resistant character and its build up in the new genetic material.

The development of new varieties is based on the maintenance of high fibre quality traits to cope with the standards of the textile industry. The varieties released by the Institute are stable and maintain their fibre quality under various ecological zones. The Institute is at advanced level in developing transgenic cotton through classical breeding along with biotechnological tools. Results of the data gathered from the experiments and surveys cannot be deduced or inferred without the statistical analysis. The mass scale statistical analysis of data has made success to bring out this 44th Progress Report of the Institute. The results are not confined in the four-walls of the Institute. Message dissemination measures through print and electronic media, personal communication, training of farmers, field staff of seed, fertilizer and NGOs remained a regular phenomena throughout the year. Various programs are televised through TV channels based at Multan.

== Plant breeding and genetics ==
The main focus of the scientists of Breeding and Genetics Section, CCRI, Multan is to develop and commercialize Bt. and non-Bt. new cotton varieties with inbuilt resistance/tolerance against the biotic and abiotic stresses along with desirable fibre traits. Development of germplasm has a key role in the process of variety development. This section holds its own recognition in this aspect. Two Bt. varieties Bt. CIM-600, Bt. CIM-616 and one non Bt. Variety CIM-612 were submitted for approval to Expert Sub-Committee. Six advanced Bt. strains were evaluated at Multan and Khanewal locations. The new strain Bt.CIM-616 gave best performance at both the locations. The strain had the lint percentage of 41.7 with the staple length of 28.8&amp;nbsp;mm and [[micronaire]] of 4.7&amp;nbsp;µg inch-1. The fibre strength of the strain is very good up to 100.3 tppsi. Seven advanced non-Bt. strains were also evaluated at Multan and Khanewal locations. The new strain CIM-716 produced the highest seed cotton yield on overall basis. All these strains have the desirable fibre characteristics. The crosses with exotic material (AS-0349) from France and Mac-7 for induction of CLCuD resistant/tolerance are in different filial generations.

== Cytogenetics ==
The intent was to travel around the possibilities of transferring enviable genes of the wild species to the cultivated cotton for commercial exploitation and to study inter and intra-genomic relationships in the genus Gossypium. The research work of Cytogenetics Section encompass maintenance of Gossypium germplasm to develop promising varieties, through introgression, which are resistant/tolerant to biotic (diseases) and abiotic (drought, heat) stresses with special hub on Burewala Strain of cotton leaf curl virus. Cytological studies of a newly developed inter-specific hybrid was undertaken. The material industrial through multiple species hybridization viz F7 of [{2(G.hirs.x G.anom.) x 3G.hirs.} x {2 (G.arbo. x G.anom.) x 2G.hirs.}] x G. hirs. were sown in single lines. Out of the 286 families 90 families remained free from virus under field conditions throughout the entire cotton season. Conversion of CLCuD tolerant lines in transgenic lines using back cross method is under observation in different filial generations i.e. F1, F2, F3, F4and F5.
Different shades of brown cotton were observed in F2 .Grey colour is also found in this material. All these shades have suitable fibre length. Search for aneuploids especially haploids remained in steps forward. Cyto material developed through multiple species hybridization was tested in progeny row trials, micro-varietal trials, Micro varietal trials and ZVT to observe their economic and fibre characteristics.
Bt Cyto-177and Cyto-124 (non Bt), varieties developed through introgression has been sent for recommendation to Expert Sub Committee on 9 March 2015. Both lines have completed two years in NCVT, PCCT, ZVT and DGR trials for its wider adaptability in different ecological zones. Cyto-179 will be tested in NCVT, PCCT and ZVT trials for its wider adoptability in different ecological zones.

== Agronomy  ==
Cotton agronomy fixes special significance in utilizing natural resources in the best available management techniques for achieving higher productivity in certain agro-ecological zones. The research carried out showed that planting of cotton in the second week of April is the best choice for achieving higher production. The delaying in planting time results in the successive decrease in yield. Genotypes CIM-608 produced higher yield over CIM-620 and Cyto-124. Application of 200&amp;nbsp;kg N ha-1 to non Bt. cotton gave non significant increase in seed cotton yield over 150&amp;nbsp;kg N ha-1. The research findings showed that planting of transgenic cotton on 1 March produced the highest yield as compared to other planting dates i.e. 15 March, 1 April, 15 April, 1 &amp; 15 May. Genotype Bt.CIM-616 produced significantly higher seed cotton yield as compared to Bt.Cyto-177 and Bt.CIM-598 (std). Nitrogenous fertilizer @ 400&amp;nbsp;kg ha-1 produced significantly higher seed cotton yield in transgenic cotton over 300&amp;nbsp;kg N ha-1.
The result revealed that cotton planting as relay crop (75&amp;nbsp;cm apart rows) produced maximum seed cotton yield (4618&amp;nbsp;kg ha-1) than fallow land early planting (4086&amp;nbsp;kg ha-1). Planting of cotton under modified technique (Relay crop 75&amp;nbsp;cm apart rows) produced 13, 99.5 and 105.3% higher cotton yield over fallow land, wide row (150&amp;nbsp;cm) and after wheat harvesting, respectively. The cost of production for the year 2014-15 was Rs. 73907 ac-1.

==  Entomology  ==
Plant protection strategy and activities have significant importance in the overall crop production programmes for sustainable agriculture. Variation of Bt gene expression in different cultivars over time and efficacy to bollworms are the main concern nowadays, studies undertaken on Earias spp proved the concerned. Similarly the efficacy of Bt cotton in the field is losing efficacy against the pink bollworm, survey conducted revealed high infestations in green bolls. Monitoring of lepidopterous pest population viz sex pheromone and light traps was carried out and forecast the increasing trend in all bollworms population. Studies on red and dusky cotton bugs continued and efforts are made to find bio agents for long term solutions. Seed treatment effect and development of natural on early and normal planting studies revealed that the population of jassid was more on early sown field than normal sowing also the natural fauna was recorded higher in the early sown. The distinct efforts of researchers of the section have proved meaningful in devising pest management strategies against common and new emerging insect pests through application of IPM. Studies are continued on host plant tolerance of CCRI, Multan and National Coordinated Bt. &amp; non-Bt. Strains. The section also studied effect of different IPM strategies on insect pest for transgenic cotton. Screening of new insecticides was also conducted against major insect pests of cotton.

== Fiber technology ==
Fibre Technology section was established in 1976. The prime objective of Fibre Technology section is to provide technical support to Plant Breeding &amp; Cytogenetics sections in testing of fibre characteristics and spinning potential of newly developed cotton cultivars &amp; strains and facilitates the other sections of the institute as well, to investigate the effect of different agricultural practices on fibre characteristics. The section is extending services to other cotton research stations of PCCC, Government &amp; private cotton agencies, commercial organizations, textile industry, progressive growers and providing research facilities and technical support to the research scholars from various textile institutes and universities in fibre testing and spinning of their research material. Apart from lab work, the section is also contributes in collaborative research studies with different sections of the institute. 
Testing Facilities
Fibre technology section is equipped with sophisticated and scientific fibre testing instruments and micro-spinning facility.

== Plant pathology  ==
The admirable collaboration and cooperation provided by this Section to Plant Breeding &amp; Genetics and Cytogenetics disciplines has overlaid in the development of virus resistance varieties. The survey during the crop season revealed that virus was prevalent across the belt. However under various agronomic practices and change in weather conditions CLCuD ranged from 0-100 percent. The incidence of stunting and boll rot was minimal. The material tested under VT, MVT. NCVT (Bt &amp; Non-Bt), NBCT, PCCT (Bt &amp; Non-Bt), and SVT were found susceptible, at various intensity levels, to CLCuD except one strains, which showed resistance. One thousand fifty US-germplasm tested under field condition, only 114 accessions show resistant against CLCuD. The cultivation of cotton of Bt-cotton in March and non-Bt in mid April escaped from virus to some extent while the crop planted beyond May fell prey to virus attack. The pattern of appearance of CLCuD and its progression during the crop season differed greatly with planting dates. The low incidence of the disease was due to planting of CIM-616 and Cyto-124. The fortnightly incidence of disease when compare with weather parameters i.e. average maximum temperature from 35.2 to 36.8&amp;nbsp;°C minimum temperature from 27.4 to 29.5&amp;nbsp;°C and relative humidity in the range of 71.2 to 81.4% at peak of CLCuD which helps for fortnightly increase of CLCuD, during mid-June to mid-August. Pantoa agglomeran reduces the seed quality and quantity in cotton rotted bolls. Streptomycin at different doses found effective to control this bacteria. Seed rottening decreased with increase of soil temperature and fungicide (Dynasty) gave minimum seed rottening in all sowing dates.

== Plant physiology ==
This section was established in 1970 with the aim to conduct basic research on physiology and nutrition of cotton crop. Since its establishment, the main focus of research scientists has been on the screening of cotton strains/varieties for thermal and water stress tolerance, integrated nutrient management, fertilizer application strategies to improve nutrient use efficiency and fertilizer use economics, soil health improvement, amino acids and growth regulators, biosafety studies of Bt cotton and seed physiology. The scientists of the section try their best to increase cotton production by managing the soil, plant and seed related problems through a coordinated approach. Apart from the allocated experimental area for field trials, the Physiology/Chemistry Section has well equipped laboratories for qualitative and quantitative studies such as pH and EC meters, flame photometers, double beam spectrophotometer, atomic absorption spectrophotometer, ICP, HPLC, GC’s, pressure chamber for leaf water potential, Osmometer, Photosynthesis measuring system, Micro Kjeldahl apparatus, centrifuges, water baths, hot plate, Soxhlet’s apparatus, Muffle furnace and sample grinding machines etc.

== Statistics ==
Statistics section is assigned the job of helping other sections in designing layout for trials and analysis of the research data. This facility is also provided to all research stations established by PCCC. Lay out for National Coordinated Variety Trials (NCVT) are prepared for Directorate of Research. Data of NCVT are statistically analyzed for Director Research, PCCC, Multan. Daily market rates of cotton commodities are documented.

== Transfer of technology ==
Transfer of Technology Section played a significant role in the dissemination of latest research practices/findings for profitable cotton production technology to all private and public sectors. The research findings are disseminated with the usage of electronic and print media during the cropping season and also in the off-season. Training/refresher courses were conducted for knowledge enhancement and skill development farmers and field officers of pesticide/seed industry. Cotton Crop Management Group (CCMG) Meetings were regularly held at the institute that helped in reviewing cotton crop situation and the devise of measures which should be adopted at gross root level through the intervention of Agriculture Department. A large number of printed materials were distributed among the extension workers, farmers and visitors of the institute during the season. Furthermore, a number of programs for general awareness/skill development in cotton production were taken up through Radio &amp; TV programs.

'''Chichen Itza'''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;{{IPAc-en|tʃ|iː|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|n|_|iː|ˈ|t|s|ɑː}} {{respell|chee|CHEN|_|eet|SAH}}, {{lang-es|Chichén Itzá}} {{IPA-es|tʃiˈtʃen iˈtsa|}}, often with the emphasis reversed in English to {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|iː|tʃ|ɛ|n|_|ˈ|iː|t|s|ə}} {{respell|CHEE|chen|_|EET|sə}}; from {{lang-yua|Chi&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;ch&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;èen Ìitsha&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} {{IPA-myn|tɕʰiʔtɕʼèːn ìːtsʰaʔ|}} (Barrera Vásquez et al., 1980.) "at the mouth of the well of the [[Itza]] people"&lt;/ref&gt; was a large [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya city|city]] built by the [[Maya people]] of the Terminal Classic period. The [[archaeological site]] is located in [[Tinúm Municipality]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán State]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Gobierno del Estado de Yucatán 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern [[Maya Lowlands]] from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]] (c. AD 600–900) through the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Terminal Classic]] (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of [[Maya architecture|architectural]] styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the [[Puuc]] and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of [[cultural diffusion]].

Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or ''[[Tollan]]s'', referred to in later [[Mesoamerica]]n literature.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p562"/&gt; The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.&lt;ref name="Miller99p26"&gt;Miller 1999, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruins of Chichen Itza are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's ''[[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia]]'' (National Institute of Anthropology and History). The land under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of Yucatán.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Concerning the legal basis of the ownership of Chichen and other sites of patrimony, see Breglia (2006), in particular Chapter 3, "Chichen Itza, a Century of Privatization". Regarding ongoing conflicts over the ownership of Chichen Itza, see Castañeda (2005). Regarding purchase, see "Yucatán: paga gobierno 220 mdp por terrenos de Chichén Itzá," La Jornada, 30 March 2010, retrieved 30 March 2010 from [http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/03/30/index.php?section=cultura&amp;article=a06n1cu jornada.unam.mx]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chichen Itza is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in 2017.&lt;ref name=visitors&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.estadisticas.inah.gob.mx/ |title=Estadística de Visitantes |language=es |publisher=[[INAH]] |accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|3}}

== Name and orthography ==
[[File:Serpent head at the base of El Castillo.jpg|thumb|A feathered serpent sculpture at the base of one of the stairways of El Castillo.]]
The Maya name "Chichen Itza" means "At the mouth of the well of the Itza." This derives from ''chi''', meaning "mouth" or "edge," and ''ch'en'' or ''ch'e'en'', meaning "well." ''Itzá'' is the name of an ethnic-lineage group that gained political and economic dominance of the northern peninsula. One possible translation for Itza is "enchanter (or enchantment) of the water,"&lt;ref&gt;Boot 2005, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; from ''its'', "sorcerer," and ''ha'', "water."&lt;ref&gt;Piña Chan 1980, 1993, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is spelled ''Chichén Itzá'' in Spanish, and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages to show that both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable. Other references prefer the [[Yucatec Maya language|Maya]] orthography, ''Chichen Itza' '' (pronounced {{IPA-myn|tʃitʃʼen itsáʔ|}}). This form preserves the [[phoneme|phonemic]] distinction between ''ch' ''and ''ch,'' since the base word ''ch'e'en'' (which, however, is not stressed in Maya) begins with a [[postalveolar]] ejective [[affricate]] consonant. The word "Itza'" has a high tone on the "a" followed by a [[glottal stop]] (indicated by the apostrophe).{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Evidence in the [[Chilam Balam]] books indicates another, earlier name for this city prior to the arrival of the Itza hegemony in northern Yucatán. While most sources agree the first word means seven, there is considerable debate as to the correct translation of the rest. This earlier name is difficult to define because of the absence of a single standard of orthography, but it is represented variously as ''Uuc Yabnal'' ("Seven Great House"),&lt;ref&gt;Luxton 1996, p.141.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uuc Hab Nal'' ("Seven Bushy Places"),&lt;ref&gt;Koch 2006, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uucyabnal'' ("Seven Great Rulers")&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p562"/&gt; or ''Uc Abnal'' ("Seven Lines of Abnal").&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;''Uuc Yabnal'' becomes ''Uc Abnal'', meaning the "Seven Abnals" or "Seven Lines of Abnal" where Abnal is a family name, according to Ralph L. Roys (Roys 1967, p.133n7).&lt;/ref&gt; This name, dating to the Late Classic Period, is recorded both in the book of Chilam Balam de Chumayel and in hieroglyphic texts in the ruins.{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=458}}

==Location==
{{see also|Pisté, Yucatán}}
[[File:Chichen Itza-16.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Chichen Itza]]
Chichen Itza is located in the eastern portion of [[Yucatán|Yucatán state]] in Mexico.{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=456}} The northern Yucatán Peninsula is arid, and the rivers in the interior all run underground. There are four visible, natural sink holes, called [[cenote]]s, that could have provided plentiful water year round at Chichen, making it attractive for settlement. Of these cenotes, the "Cenote Sagrado" or [[Sacred Cenote]] (also variously known as the Sacred Well or Well of Sacrifice), is the most famous.&lt;ref name="Coggins 1992"&gt;Coggins 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, scientists determined that there is a hidden cenote under [[Kukulkan]], which has never been seen by archaeologists.&lt;ref name="ChavezRene2015"&gt;Chavez 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to post-Conquest sources (Maya and Spanish), pre-Columbian Maya sacrificed objects and human beings into the cenote as a form of worship to the Maya rain god [[Chaac]]. [[Edward Herbert Thompson]] dredged the Cenote Sagrado from 1904 to 1910, and recovered artifacts of gold, [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]], [[Maya ceramics|pottery]] and [[incense]], as well as human remains.&lt;ref name="Coggins 1992"/&gt; A study of human remains taken from the Cenote Sagrado found that they had wounds consistent with human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Anda Alanís 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political organization==
[[File:Chichen-Itza-1000-Warriors-Columns.jpg|thumb|300px|Columns in the Temple of a Thousand Warriors]]
Several archaeologists in the late 1980s suggested that unlike previous Maya polities of the Early Classic, Chichen Itza may not have been governed by an individual ruler or a single [[dynastic]] [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]. Instead, the city's political organization could have been structured by a "''multepal''" system, which is characterized as rulership through council composed of members of [[elite]] ruling lineages.&lt;ref&gt;Freidel, p.6. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.581.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory was popular in the 1990s, but in recent years, the research that supported the concept of the "multepal" system has been called into question, if not discredited. The current belief trend in Maya scholarship is toward the more traditional model of the Maya kingdoms of the Classic Period [[Petén Basin|southern lowlands in Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 2007, pp.166–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Chichen Itza was a major economic power in the northern Maya lowlands during its apogee.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos Plama 2004, 2005, pp.539–540.&lt;/ref&gt; Participating in the water-borne circum-peninsular trade route through its port site of Isla Cerritos on the north coast,&lt;ref&gt;Cobos Palma 2004, 2005, p.540.&lt;/ref&gt; Chichen Itza was able to obtain locally unavailable resources from distant areas such as [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] from central Mexico and [[Metallurgy in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica|gold]] from southern Central America.

Between AD 900 and 1050 Chichen Itza expanded to become a powerful regional capital controlling north and central Yucatán. It established Isla Cerritos as a trading port.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos Palma 2004, 2005, pp.537–541.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Trono de Jaguar en El Castillo, Chichen Itza.jpg|thumb|The Jaguar Throne inside the "El Castillo" pyramid.]]
The layout of Chichen Itza site core developed during its earlier phase of occupation, between 750 and 900 AD.&lt;ref name="CobosPalma0405p531"&gt;Cobos Palma 2004, 2005, p.531.&lt;/ref&gt; Its final layout was developed after 900 AD, and the 10th century saw the rise of the city as a regional capital controlling the area from central Yucatán to the north coast, with its power extending down the east and west coasts of the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos Palma 2004, 2005, pp.531–533.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[Maya script|hieroglyphic]] date discovered at Chichen Itza is equivalent to 832 AD, while the last known date was recorded in the Osario temple in 998.{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=457}}

===Establishment===
The Late Classic city was centered upon the area to the southwest of the Xtoloc cenote, with the main architecture represented by the substructures now underlying the Las Monjas and Observatorio and the basal platform upon which they were built.{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=461}}

=== Ascendancy ===
Chichen Itza rose to regional prominence towards the end of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Classic]] period (roughly 600 AD). It was, however, towards the end of the Late Classic and into the early part of the Terminal Classic that the site became a major regional capital, centralizing and dominating political, sociocultural, economic, and ideological life in the northern Maya lowlands. The ascension of Chichen Itza roughly correlates with the decline and fragmentation of the major centers of the southern Maya lowlands.

As Chichen Itza rose to prominence, the cities of [[Yaxuna]] (to the south) and [[Coba]] (to the east) were suffering decline. These two cities had been mutual allies, with Yaxuna dependent upon Coba. At some point in the 10th century Coba lost a significant portion of its territory, isolating Yaxuna, and Chichen Itza may have directly contributed to the collapse of both cities.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos Palama, 2004, 2005, p.541.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decline ===
{{Maya civilization}}
According to some colonial Mayan sources (e.g., the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel), [[Hunac Ceel]], ruler of [[Mayapan]], conquered Chichen Itza in the 13th century. Hunac Ceel supposedly prophesied his own rise to power. According to custom at the time, individuals thrown into the Cenote Sagrado were believed to have the power of prophecy if they survived. During one such ceremony, the chronicles state, there were no survivors, so Hunac Ceel leaped into the Cenote Sagrado, and when removed, prophesied his own ascension.

While there is some archaeological evidence that indicates Chichén Itzá was at one time looted and sacked,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1954, 1966, p.137.&lt;/ref&gt; there appears to be greater evidence that it could not have been by Mayapan, at least not when Chichén Itzá was an active urban center. Archaeological data now indicates that Chichen Itza declined as a regional center by 1250, before the rise of Mayapan.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For summation of this re-dating proposal, see in particular Andrews ''et al.'' 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2018|talk=That's not what it says at all}} Ongoing research at the site of Mayapan may help resolve this chronological conundrum.

After Chichén Itzá elite activities ceased, the city may not have been abandoned. When the Spanish arrived, they found a thriving local population, although it is not clear from Spanish sources if these Maya were living in Chichen Itza proper, or a nearby settlement. The relatively high population density in the region was a factor in the conquistadors' decision to locate a capital there.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain 1948, pp.136, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; According to post-Conquest sources, both Spanish and Maya, the [[Cenote Sagrado]] remained a place of pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;Restall 1998, pp.81, 149; Landa 1937, p.90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish conquest===
{{see also|Spanish conquest of Yucatán}}

In 1526 Spanish [[Conquistador]] [[Francisco de Montejo]] (a veteran of the Grijalva and Cortés expeditions) successfully petitioned the King of Spain for a charter to conquer Yucatán. His first campaign in 1527, which covered much of the Yucatán Peninsula, decimated his forces but ended with the establishment of a small fort at [[Playa del Carmen|Xaman Ha']], south of what is today [[Cancún]]. Montejo returned to Yucatán in 1531 with reinforcements and established his main base at [[Campeche]] on the west coast.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen 2003, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; He sent his son, Francisco Montejo The Younger, in late 1532 to conquer the interior of the Yucatán Peninsula from the north. The objective from the beginning was to go to Chichén Itzá and establish a capital.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain 1948, pp.19–20, 64, 97, 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Montejo the Younger eventually arrived at Chichen Itza, which he renamed Ciudad Real. At first he encountered no resistance, and set about dividing the lands around the city and awarding them to his soldiers. The Maya became more hostile over time, and eventually they laid siege to the Spanish, cutting off their supply line to the coast, and forcing them to barricade themselves among the ruins of the ancient city. Months passed, but no reinforcements arrived. Montejo the Younger attempted an all out assault against the Maya and lost 150 of his remaining troops. He was forced to abandon Chichén Itzá in 1534 under cover of darkness. By 1535, all Spanish had been driven from the Yucatán Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain 1948, pp.132–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Montejo eventually returned to Yucatán and, by recruiting Maya from Campeche and Champoton, built a large [[Indian auxiliaries|Indio-Spanish]] army and conquered the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen 2003, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish crown later issued a land grant that included Chichen Itza and by 1588 it was a working cattle ranch.&lt;ref&gt;Breglia 2006, p.67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
[[File:Castillo Maler.jpg|thumb|300px|The Castillo Temple, photograph by [[Teobert Maler]], 1892.]]
Chichen Itza entered the popular imagination in 1843 with the book ''Incidents of Travel in Yucatan'' by [[John Lloyd Stephens]] (with illustrations by [[Frederick Catherwood]]). The book recounted Stephens' visit to Yucatán and his tour of Maya cities, including Chichén Itzá. The book prompted other explorations of the city. In 1860, [[Désiré Charnay]] surveyed Chichén Itzá and took numerous photographs that he published in ''Cités et ruines américaines'' (1863).

In 1875, [[Augustus Le Plongeon]] and his wife [[Alice Dixon Le Plongeon]] visited Chichén, and excavated a statue of a figure on its back, knees drawn up, upper torso raised on its elbows with a plate on its stomach. Augustus Le Plongeon called it "Chaacmol" (later renamed "[[Chac Mool]]", which has been the term to describe all types of this statuary found in Mesoamerica). [[Teobert Maler]] and [[Alfred Maudslay]] explored Chichén in the 1880s and both spent several weeks at the site and took extensive photographs. Maudslay published the first long-form description of Chichen Itza in his book, ''Biologia Centrali-Americana''.

In 1894 the United States Consul to Yucatán, [[Edward Herbert Thompson]], purchased the [[Hacienda Chichén]], which included the ruins of Chichen Itza. For 30 years, Thompson explored the ancient city. His discoveries included the earliest dated carving upon a lintel in the Temple of the Initial Series and the excavation of several graves in the Osario (High Priest's Temple). Thompson is most famous for dredging the Cenote Sagrado (Sacred Cenote) from 1904 to 1910, where he recovered artifacts of gold, copper and carved jade, as well as the first-ever examples of what were believed to be pre-Columbian Maya cloth and wooden weapons. Thompson shipped the bulk of the artifacts to the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum at Harvard University]].

In 1913, the Carnegie Institution accepted the proposal of archaeologist [[Sylvanus Morley|Sylvanus G. Morley]] and committed to conduct long-term archaeological research at Chichen Itza.&lt;ref&gt;Morley 1913, pp.61–91.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican Revolution and the following government instability, as well as World War I, delayed the project by a decade.&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse 1971, pp.74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the Mexican government awarded the Carnegie Institution a 10-year permit (later extended another 10 years) to allow U.S. archaeologists to conduct extensive excavation and restoration of Chichen Itza.&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse 1971, pp.195–196; Weeks and Hill 2006, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie researchers excavated and restored the Temple of Warriors and the Caracol, among other major buildings. At the same time, the Mexican government excavated and restored El Castillo and the Great Ball Court.&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse 1971, pp.195–196; Weeks and Hill 2006, pp.577–653.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2009 excavation ChichenItza.JPG|thumb|300px|Excavations next to El Castillo began in 2009.]]
In 1926, the Mexican government charged Edward Thompson with theft, claiming he stole the artifacts from the Cenote Sagrado and smuggled them out of the country. The government seized the Hacienda Chichén. Thompson, who was in the United States at the time, never returned to Yucatán. He wrote about his research and investigations of the Maya culture in a book ''People of the Serpent'' published in 1932. He died in New Jersey in 1935. In 1944 the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that Thompson had broken no laws and returned Chichen Itza to his heirs. The Thompsons sold the hacienda to tourism pioneer Fernando Barbachano Peon.&lt;ref name="Usborne 2007"&gt;Usborne (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two later expeditions to recover artifacts from the Cenote Sagrado, in 1961 and 1967. The first was sponsored by the National Geographic, and the second by private interests. Both projects were supervised by Mexico's [[National Institute of Anthropology and History]] (INAH). INAH has conducted an ongoing effort to excavate and restore other monuments in the archaeological zone, including the Osario, Akab D'zib, and several buildings in Chichén Viejo (Old Chichen).

In 2009, to investigate construction that predated El Castillo, Yucatec archaeologists began excavations adjacent to El Castillo under the direction of Rafael (Rach) Cobos.

== Site description ==
[[File:Chichen Itza Plan EN.png|thumb|A map of central Chichen Itza.]]
Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities, with the relatively densely clustered [[Maya architecture|architecture]] of the site core covering an area of at least {{convert|5|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p562"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.562.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller scale residential architecture extends for an unknown distance beyond this.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p562"/&gt; The city was built upon broken terrain, which was artificially levelled in order to build the major architectural groups, with the greatest effort being expended in the levelling of the areas for the Castillo pyramid, and the Las Monjas, Osario and Main Southwest groups.{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=456}}

The site contains many fine stone buildings in various states of preservation, and many have been restored. The buildings were connected by a dense network of paved causeways, called ''[[sacbe]]ob''.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;From {{lang-myn|sakb'e}}, meaning "white way/road". Plural form is ''sacbeob'' (or in modern Maya orthography, ''sakb'eob&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'').&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have identified over 80 ''sacbeob'' criss-crossing the site,{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=456}} and extending in all directions from the city.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these stone buildings were originally painted in red, green, blue and purple colors. Pigments were chosen according to what was most easily available in the area. The site must be imagined as a colorful one, not like it is today. Just like gothic cathedrals in Europe, colors provided a greater sense of completeness and contributed greatly to the symbolic impact of the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski 1981, pp.51–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture encompasses a number of styles, including the Puuc and Chenes styles of the northern Yucatán Peninsula.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p562"/&gt; The buildings of Chichen Itza are grouped in a series of architectonic sets, and each set was at one time separated from the other by a series of low walls. The three best known of these complexes are the Great North Platform, which includes the monuments of El Castillo, Temple of Warriors and the Great Ball Court; The Osario Group, which includes the pyramid of the same name as well as the Temple of Xtoloc; and the Central Group, which includes the Caracol, Las Monjas, and Akab Dzib.

South of Las Monjas, in an area known as Chichén Viejo (Old Chichén) and only open to archaeologists, are several other complexes, such as the Group of the Initial Series, Group of the Lintels, and Group of the Old Castle.

===Architectural styles===
The Puuc-style architecture is concentrated in the Old Chichen area, and also the earlier structures in the Nunnery Group (including the Las Monjas, Annex and La Iglesia buildings); it is also represented in the Akab Dzib structure.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp.562–563.&lt;/ref&gt; The Puuc-style building feature the usual mosaic-decorated upper façades characteristic of the style but differ from the architecture of the Puuc heartland in their block masonry walls, as opposed to the fine veneers of the Puuc region proper.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p563"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.563.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one structure in the Las Monjas Group features an ornate façade and masked doorway that are typical examples of Chenes-style architecture, a style centred upon a region in the north of [[Campeche]] state, lying between the Puuc and [[Río Bec]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.562. Coe 1999, pp.100, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those structures with sculpted hieroglyphic script are concentrated in certain areas of the site, with the most important being the Las Monjas group.{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=457}}

Dominating the North Platform of Chichen Itza is the ''Temple of [[Kukulkan]]'' (a Maya [[Feathered Serpent (deity)|feathered serpent deity]] similar to the Aztec [[Quetzalcoatl]]), usually referred to as ''El Castillo'' ("the castle").{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}} This [[step pyramid]] stands about {{convert|30|m|ft}} high and consists of a series of nine square terraces, each approximately {{convert|2.57|m|ft}} high, with a {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=on}} high temple upon the summit.&lt;ref name="GarciaSalgado10p118"&gt;García Salgado 2010, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sides of the pyramid are approximately {{convert|55.3|m|ft}} at the base and rise at an angle of 53°, although that varies slightly for each side.&lt;ref name="GarciaSalgado10p118"/&gt; The four faces of the pyramid have protruding stairways that rise at an angle of 45°.&lt;ref name="GarciaSalgado10p118"/&gt; The ''[[Talud-tablero|talud]]'' walls of each terrace slant at an angle of between 72° and 74°.&lt;ref name="GarciaSalgado10p118"/&gt; At the base of the balustrades of the northeastern staircase are carved heads of a serpent.&lt;ref&gt;García Salgado 2010, pp.119, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesoamerican cultures periodically superimposed larger structures over older ones,&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 2006, 2007, p.264.&lt;/ref&gt; and El Castillo is one such example.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p565"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.565.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1930s, the Mexican government sponsored an excavation of El Castillo. After several false starts, they discovered a staircase under the north side of the pyramid. By digging from the top, they found another temple buried below the current one.&lt;ref name="Willard 1941"&gt;Willard 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the temple chamber was a Chac Mool statue and a throne in the shape of Jaguar, painted red and with spots made of inlaid jade.&lt;ref name="Willard 1941"/&gt; The Mexican government excavated a tunnel from the base of the north staircase, up the earlier pyramid's stairway to the hidden temple, and opened it to tourists. In 2006, INAH closed the throne room to the public.&lt;ref name="DiarioYucatan3Mar06"&gt;Diario de Yucatan, 3 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the [[spring equinox|Spring]] and [[Autumn equinox]]es, in the late afternoon, the northwest corner of the pyramid casts a series of triangular shadows against the western balustrade on the north side that evokes the appearance of a serpent wriggling down the staircase, which some scholars have suggested is a representation of the feathered-serpent god Kukulcan.&lt;ref&gt;García Salgado 2010, pp.121–122.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a widespread belief that this light-and-shadow effect was achieved on purpose to record the equinoxes, but the idea is highly unlikely: it has been shown that the phenomenon can be observed, without major changes, during several weeks around the equinoxes, making impossible to determine any date by observing this effect alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=El Sol en Chichén Itzá y Dzibilchaltún: la supuesta importancia de los equinoccios en Mesoamérica |journal=Arqueología Mexicana |date=2018 |volume=XXV |issue=149 |pages=26-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Great Ball Court=====
[[File:Chichen-Itza-Ballcourt-Panorama-2010.jpg|thumb|300px|The Great Ball Court.]]
Archaeologists have identified thirteen [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] for playing the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] in Chichen Itza,&lt;ref&gt;Kurjack et al. 1991, p.150.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Great Ball Court about {{convert|150|m|ft}} to the north-west of the Castillo is by far the most impressive. It is the largest and best preserved ball court in ancient Mesoamerica.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}} It measures {{convert|168|by|70|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="PinaChan8093p42"&gt;Piña Chan 1980, 1993, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The parallel platforms flanking the main playing area are each {{Convert|95|m|ft}} long.&lt;ref name="PinaChan8093p42"/&gt; The walls of these platforms stand {{convert|8|m|ft}} high;&lt;ref name="PinaChan8093p42"/&gt; set high up in the centre of each of these walls are rings carved with intertwined feathered serpents.&lt;ref name="PinaChan8093p42"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;A popular explanation is that the objective of the game was to pass a ball through one of the rings, however in other, smaller ball courts there is no ring, only a post.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the base of the high interior walls are slanted benches with sculpted panels of teams of ball players.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}} In one panel, one of the players has been decapitated; the wound emits streams of blood in the form of wriggling snakes.&lt;ref name="PinaChan8093p44"&gt;Piña Chan 1980, 1993, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Yes, we know tour guides like telling visitors it was the winners who were decapitated. If you have any primary source confirmation, please explain on the talk page before changing this.--&gt;

At one end of the Great Ball Court is the '''North Temple''', also known as the '''Temple of the Bearded Man''' (''Templo del Hombre Barbado'').{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=83}} This small masonry building has detailed bas relief carving on the inner walls, including a center figure that has carving under his chin that resembles facial hair.&lt;ref&gt;Cirerol Sansores 1948, pp.94–96.&lt;/ref&gt; At the south end is another, much bigger temple, but in ruins.

Built into the east wall are the ''Temples of the Jaguar''. The ''Upper Temple of the Jaguar'' overlooks the ball court and has an entrance guarded by two, large columns carved in the familiar feathered serpent motif. Inside there is a large mural, much destroyed, which depicts a battle scene.

In the entrance to the ''Lower Temple of the Jaguar'', which opens behind the ball court, is another Jaguar throne, similar to the one in the inner temple of El Castillo, except that it is well worn and missing paint or other decoration. The outer columns and the walls inside the temple are covered with elaborate bas-relief carvings.

=====Additional structures=====
The ''[[Tzompantli]]'', or ''Skull Platform'' (''Plataforma de los Cráneos''), shows the clear cultural influence of the central [[Mexican Plateau]]. Unlike the ''tzompantli'' of the highlands, however, the skulls were impaled vertically rather than horizontally as at [[Tenochtitlan]].{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}}
{{Großes Bild|2014-01-03 Tzompantli in Chichén Itzá anagoria.jpg|1500px|Chichén Itzá; ''[[tzompantli]]'' or Skull Platform}}

The ''Platform of the Eagles and the Jaguars'' (''Plataforma de Águilas y Jaguares'') is immediately to the east of the Great Ballcourt.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=83}} It is built in a combination Maya and Toltec styles, with a staircase ascending each of its four sides.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}} The sides are decorated with panels depicting eagles and jaguars consuming human hearts.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}}

This ''Platform of Venus'' is dedicated to the planet [[Venus]].{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}} In its interior archaeologists discovered a collection of large cones carved out of stone,{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}} the purpose of which is unknown. This platform is located north of El Castillo, between it and the Cenote Sagrado.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=83}}

The ''Temple of the Tables'' is the northernmost of a series of buildings to the east of El Castillo. Its name comes from a series of altars at the top of the structure that are supported by small carved figures of men with upraised arms, called "atlantes."

The ''Steam Bath'' is a unique building with three parts: a waiting gallery, a water bath, and a steam chamber that operated by means of heated stones.

''Sacbe Number One'' is a causeway that leads to the Cenote Sagrado, is the largest and most elaborate at Chichen Itza. This "white road" is {{convert|270|m|ft}} long with an average width of {{convert|9|m|ft}}. It begins at a low wall a few metres from the Platform of Venus. According to archaeologists there once was an extensive building with columns at the beginning of the road.

=====Sacred Cenote=====
{{main article|Sacred Cenote}}
[[File:Mexico Cenotes.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Sacred Cenote]].]]
The [[Yucatán Peninsula]] is a [[limestone]] plain, with no rivers or streams. The region is pockmarked with natural [[sinkhole]]s, called cenotes, which expose the [[water table]] to the surface. One of the most impressive of these is the Cenote Sagrado, which is {{convert|60|m|ft}} in diameter{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=85}} and surrounded by sheer cliffs that drop to the water table some {{convert|27|m|ft}} below.

The Cenote Sagrado was a place of pilgrimage for ancient Maya people who, according to ethnohistoric sources, would conduct sacrifices during times of drought.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=85}} Archaeological investigations support this as thousands of objects have been removed from the bottom of the cenote, including material such as gold, carved jade, copal, pottery, flint, [[obsidian]], shell, wood, rubber, cloth, as well as skeletons of children and men.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=85}}&lt;ref name="Cogginsp26"&gt;Coggins 1984, pp. 26–7&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Temple of the Warriors=====
[[File:Templo de los Guerreros.jpg|thumb|300px|Templo de los Guerreros (Temple of the Warriors)]]
[[File:Chichen-Itza-Chac-Mool-2010.jpg|thumb|300px|Detail of Temple of the Warriors, showing a statue of [[Chacmool]].]]
The Temple of the Warriors complex consists of a large stepped pyramid fronted and flanked by rows of carved columns depicting warriors. This complex is analogous to Temple B at the Toltec capital of Tula, and indicates some form of cultural contact between the two regions. The one at Chichen Itza, however, was constructed on a larger scale. At the top of the stairway on the pyramid's summit (and leading towards the entrance of the pyramid's temple) is a Chac Mool.

This temple encases or entombs a former structure called The Temple of the Chac Mool. The archeological expedition and restoration of this building was done by the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] from 1925 to 1928. A key member of this restoration was Earl H. Morris who published the work from this expedition in two volumes entitled ''Temple of the Warriors''.

=====Group of a Thousand Columns=====
Along the south wall of the Temple of Warriors are a series of what are today exposed columns, although when the city was inhabited these would have supported an extensive roof system. The columns are in three distinct sections: A west group, that extends the lines of the front of the Temple of Warriors. A north group runs along the south wall of the Temple of Warriors and contains pillars with carvings of soldiers in bas-relief;

A northeast group, which apparently formed a small temple at the southeast corner of the Temple of Warriors, contains a rectangular decorated with carvings of people or gods, as well as animals and serpents. The northeast column temple also covers a small marvel of engineering, a channel that funnels all the rainwater from the complex some {{convert|40|m|ft}} away to a rejollada, a former cenote.

To the south of the Group of a Thousand Columns is a group of three, smaller, interconnected buildings. The '''Temple of the Carved Columns''' is a small elegant building that consists of a front gallery with an inner corridor that leads to an altar with a Chac Mool. There are also numerous columns with rich, bas-relief carvings of some 40 personages.

A section of the upper façade with a motif of x's and o's is displayed in front of the structure. The '''Temple of the Small Tables''' which is an unrestored mound. And the '''Thompson's Temple''' (referred to in some sources as '''Palace of Ahau Balam Kauil''' ), a small building with two levels that has friezes depicting Jaguars (''balam'' in Maya) as well as glyphs of the Maya god Kahuil.

=====El Mercado=====
This square structure anchors the southern end of the Temple of Warriors complex. It is so named for the shelf of stone that surrounds a large gallery and patio that early explorers theorized was used to display wares as in a marketplace. Today, archaeologists believe that its purpose was more ceremonial than commercial.

====Osario Group====
South of the North Group is a smaller platform that has many important structures, several of which appear to be oriented toward the second largest cenote at Chichen Itza, Xtoloc.

[[File:HighPriestTemple.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The Osario pyramid.]]
[[File:Ossuary stairs.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Osario staircase.]]
'''The Osario''' itself, like El Castillo, is a step-pyramid temple dominating its platform, only on a smaller scale. Like its larger neighbor, it has four sides with staircases on each side. There is a temple on top, but unlike El Castillo, at the center is an opening into the pyramid which leads to a natural cave {{convert|12|m|ft}} below. Edward H. Thompson excavated this cave in the late 19th century, and because he found several skeletons and artifacts such as jade beads, he named the structure '''The High Priests' Temple.''' Archaeologists today believe neither that the structure was a tomb nor that the personages buried in it were priests.

The '''Temple of Xtoloc''' is a recently restored temple outside the Osario Platform is. It overlooks the other large cenote at Chichen Itza, named after the Maya word for iguana, "Xtoloc." The temple contains a series of pilasters carved with images of people, as well as representations of plants, birds and mythological scenes.

Between the Xtoloc temple and the Osario are several aligned structures: The '''Platform of Venus''' (which is similar in design to the structure of the same name next to El Castillo), the '''Platform of the Tombs''', and a small, round structure that is unnamed. These three structures were constructed in a row extending from the Osario. Beyond them the Osario platform terminates in a wall, which contains an opening to a sacbe that runs several hundred feet to the Xtoloc temple.

South of the Osario, at the boundary of the platform, there are two small buildings that archaeologists believe were residences for important personages. These have been named as the '''House of the Metates''' and the '''House of the Mestizas'''.

====Casa Colorada Group====
South of the Osario Group is another small platform that has several structures that are among the oldest in the Chichen Itza archaeological zone.

The '''Casa Colorada''' (Spanish for "Red House") is one of the best preserved buildings at Chichen Itza. Its Maya name is ''Chichanchob'', which according to INAH may mean "small holes". In one chamber there are extensive carved hieroglyphs that mention rulers of Chichen Itza and possibly of the nearby city of Ek Balam, and contain a Maya date inscribed which correlates to 869 AD, one of the oldest such dates found in all of Chichen Itza.

In 2009, INAH restored a small ball court that adjoined the back wall of the Casa Colorada.&lt;ref&gt;Fry 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Casa Colorada is in a good state of preservation, other buildings in the group, with one exception, are decrepit mounds. One building is half standing, named '''La Casa del Venado''' (House of the Deer). This building's name has been long used by the local Maya, and some authors mention that it was named after a deer painting over stucco that doesn't exist anymore.&lt;ref&gt;El Chichán Chob y la Casa del Venado, Chichén Itzá, Yucatán. William J. Folan [https://mediateca.inah.gob.mx/islandora_74/islandora/object/articulo:7562]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Central Group====
[[File:Chichen itza la iglesia.jpg|thumb|300px|"La Iglesia" in the Las Monjas complex.]]
[[File:Chichen Itza 4.jpg|right|thumb|450px|The "El Caracol" observatory temple.]]
'''Las Monjas''' is one of the more notable structures at Chichen Itza. It is a complex of Terminal Classic buildings constructed in the Puuc architectural style. The Spanish named this complex ''Las Monjas'' ("The Nuns" or "The Nunnery") but it was actually a governmental palace. Just to the east is a small temple (known as the ''La Iglesia'', "The Church") decorated with elaborate masks.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}}{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=87}}

The Las Monjas group is distinguished by its concentration of hieroglyphic texts dating to the Late to Terminal Classic. These texts frequently mention a ruler by the name of [[K'ak'upakal|Kakupakal]].{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=457}}{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=460}}

'''[[El Caracol, Chichen Itza|El Caracol]]''' ("The Snail") is located to the north of ''Las Monjas''. It is a round building on a large square platform. It gets its name from the stone spiral staircase inside. The structure, with its unusual placement on the platform and its round shape (the others are rectangular, in keeping with Maya practice), is theorized to have been a proto-observatory with doors and windows aligned to astronomical events, specifically around the path of Venus as it traverses the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1997, pp.135–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Akab Dzib]]''' is located to the east of the Caracol. The name means, in Yucatec Mayan, "Dark Writing"; "dark" in the sense of "mysterious". An earlier name of the building, according to a translation of glyphs in the Casa Colorada, is ''Wa(k)wak Puh Ak Na'', "the flat house with the excessive number of chambers," and it was the home of the administrator of Chichén Itzá, kokom Yahawal Cho' K'ak'.&lt;ref&gt;Voss and Kremer 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

INAH completed a restoration of the building in 2007. It is relatively short, only {{convert|6|m|ft}} high, and is {{convert|50|m|ft}} in length and {{convert|15|m|ft}} wide. The long, western-facing façade has seven doorways. The eastern façade has only four doorways, broken by a large staircase that leads to the roof. This apparently was the front of the structure, and looks out over what is today a steep, dry, cenote.

The southern end of the building has one entrance. The door opens into a small chamber and on the opposite wall is another doorway, above which on the lintel are intricately carved glyphs—the "mysterious" or "obscure" writing that gives the building its name today. Under the lintel in the doorjamb is another carved panel of a seated figure surrounded by more glyphs. Inside one of the chambers, near the ceiling, is a painted hand print.

====Old Chichen====

Data from a [[National Science Foundation]]/[[CyArk]] research partnership.]]
'''Old Chichen''' (or '''Chichén Viejo''' in Spanish) is the name given to a group of structures to the south of the central site, where most of the Puuc-style architecture of the city is concentrated.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p562"/&gt; It includes the Initial Series Group, the Phallic Temple, the Platform of the Great Turtle, the Temple of the Owls, and the Temple of the Monkeys.

====Other structures====
Chichen Itza also has a variety of other structures densely packed in the ceremonial center of about {{convert|5|km2|mi2}} and several outlying subsidiary sites.

====Caves of Balankanche====
Approximately {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} south east of the Chichen Itza archaeological zone are a network of sacred caves known as [[Balankanche]] ({{lang-es|Gruta de Balankanche}}), '''Balamka'anche'''' in Yucatec Maya). In the caves, a large selection of ancient pottery and idols may be seen still in the positions where they were left in pre-Columbian times.

The location of the cave has been well known in modern times. Edward Thompson and [[Alfred Tozzer]] visited it in 1905. A.S. Pearse and a team of biologists explored the cave in 1932 and 1936. E. Wyllys Andrews IV also explored the cave in the 1930s. [[Edwin Shook]] and R.E. Smith explored the cave on behalf of the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution]] in 1954, and dug several trenches to recover potsherds and other artifacts. Shook determined that the cave had been inhabited over a long period, at least from the Preclassic to the post-conquest era.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1961, pp.28–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 1959, José Humberto Gómez, a local guide, discovered a false wall in the cave. Behind it he found an extended network of caves with significant quantities of undisturbed archaeological remains, including pottery and stone-carved [[censer]]s, stone implements and jewelry. INAH converted the cave into an underground museum, and the objects after being catalogued were returned to their original place so visitors can see them ''in situ''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tourism ==
[[File:Façade principale du palais des Nonnes.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo of Chichen Itza in 1859–1860 by [[Désiré Charnay]] before vegetation was removed.]]
Chichen Itza is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico; in 2014 it was estimated to receive an average of 1.4 million visitors every year.&lt;ref name="SECTUR07"&gt;SECTUR 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Relief, lower terrace columns, Temple of the Warriors (8287896013).jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Painting of a relief, lower terrace columns, Temple of the Warriors, by Octavio Medellin 1938.]]
Tourism has been a factor at Chichen Itza for more than a century. John Lloyd Stephens, who popularized the Maya Yucatán in the public's imagination with his book ''Incidents of Travel in Yucatan'', inspired many to make a pilgrimage to Chichén Itzá. Even before the book was published, Benjamin Norman and Baron [[Emanuel von Friedrichsthal]] traveled to Chichen after meeting Stephens, and both published the results of what they found. Friedrichsthal was the first to photograph Chichen Itza, using the recently invented [[daguerreotype]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmquist and Kailbourn 2000, p.252.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Edward Thompson in 1894 purchased the Hacienda Chichén, which included Chichen Itza, he received a constant stream of visitors. In 1910 he announced his intention to construct a hotel on his property, but abandoned those plans, probably because of the Mexican Revolution.

In the early 1920s, a group of Yucatecans, led by writer/photographer Francisco Gomez Rul, began working toward expanding tourism to Yucatán. They urged Governor Felipe Carrillo Puerto to build roads to the more famous monuments, including Chichen Itza. In 1923, Governor Carrillo Puerto officially opened the highway to Chichen Itza. Gomez Rul published one of the first guidebooks to Yucatán and the ruins.

Gomez Rul's son-in-law, Fernando Barbachano Peon (a grandnephew of former Yucatán Governor [[Miguel Barbachano]]), started Yucatán's first official tourism business in the early 1920s. He began by meeting passengers who arrived by steamship at Progreso, the port north of Mérida, and persuading them to spend a week in Yucatán, after which they would catch the next steamship to their next destination. In his first year Barbachano Peon reportedly was only able to convince seven passengers to leave the ship and join him on a tour. In the mid-1920s Barbachano Peon persuaded Edward Thompson to sell {{convert|5|acre|m2}} next to Chichen for a hotel. In 1930, the Mayaland Hotel opened, just north of the Hacienda Chichén, which had been taken over by the Carnegie Institution.&lt;ref&gt;Madeira 1931, pp. 108–109,&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Barbachano Peon purchased all of the Hacienda Chichén, including Chichen Itza, from the heirs of Edward Thompson.&lt;ref name="Usborne 2007"/&gt; Around that same time the Carnegie Institution completed its work at Chichen Itza and abandoned the Hacienda Chichén, which Barbachano turned into another seasonal hotel.

In 1972, Mexico enacted the Ley Federal Sobre Monumentos y Zonas Arqueológicas, Artísticas e Históricas (Federal Law over Monuments and Archeological, Artistic and Historic Sites) that put all the nation's pre-Columbian monuments, including those at Chichen Itza, under federal ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Breglia 2006, pp.45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; There were now hundreds, if not thousands, of visitors every year to Chichen Itza, and more were expected with the development of the Cancún resort area to the east.

In the 1980s, Chichen Itza began to receive an influx of visitors on the day of the spring equinox. Today several thousand show up to see the light-and-shadow effect on the Temple of Kukulcan in which the feathered serpent god appears to crawl down the side of the pyramid.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;See Quetzil Castaneda (1996) In The Museum of Maya Culture (University of Minnesota Press) for a book length study of tourism at Chichen, including a chapter on the equinox ritual. For a 90-minute ethnographic documentary of new age spiritualism at the Equinox see Jeff Himpele and Castaneda (1997)[Incidents of Travel in Chichen Itza] (Documentary Educational Resources).&lt;/ref&gt; Tourists are also amazed by the acoustics at Chichen Itza. For instance a handclap in front of the staircase of the El Castillo pyramid is followed by an echo that resembles the chirp of a [[quetzal]] as investigated by [[Nico F. Declercq|Declercq]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, 14 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chichen Itza, a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], is the second-most visited of Mexico's archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;SECTUR 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeological site draws many visitors from the popular tourist resort of Cancún, who make a day trip on tour buses. In 2007, Chichen Itza's El Castillo was named one of the [[New Seven Wonders of the World]] after a worldwide vote. Despite the fact that the vote was sponsored by a commercial enterprise, and that its methodology was criticized, the vote was embraced by government and tourism officials in Mexico who project that as a result of the publicity the number of tourists expected to visit Chichen will double by 2012.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Figure is attributed to Francisco López Mena, director of the Consejo de Promoción Turística de México (CPTM – Council for the Promotion of Mexican Tourism).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EFE, 29 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ensuing publicity re-ignited debate in Mexico over the ownership of the site, which culminated on 29 March 2010 when the state of Yucatán purchased the land upon which the most recognized monuments rest from owner Hans Juergen Thies Barbachano.&lt;ref&gt;Boffil Gómez, 30 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past several years, INAH, which manages the site, has been closing monuments to public access. While visitors can walk around them, they can no longer climb them or go inside their chambers. The most recent was El Castillo, which was closed after a San Diego, California, woman fell to her death in 2006.&lt;ref name="DiarioYucatan3Mar06"/&gt;

'''The Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon''' is a non-profit medical institution dedicated to the comprehensive treatment of pediatric cancer.  The center is affiliated with [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], founded by Lebanese U.S. comedian and actor [[Danny Thomas]]. He had a dream to open a similar medical institute in his ancestral home of [[Lebanon]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Danny Thomas's children [[Marlo Thomas|Marlo]] and [[Tony Thomas (producer)|Tony Thomas]] pursued his dream until the center opened in [[Beirut]] on April 12, 2002.  The center, which is located on 56 [[Rue Clémenceau]], works in association with the nearby [[American University of Beirut]] Medical Center (AUBMC). The mission of the center is to save children's lives using the protocols of [[St. Jude]].  The center depends completely on donations and fundraising programs. 

On April 12, 2002, the late Prime Minister of Lebanon, [[Rafik Hariri]], several ministers of the [[Lebanese government]] and members of the [[Lebanese Parliament]], as well as major officials from the [[American University of Beirut]], joined a delegation from  the [[American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities]] and [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] and the board of the ''Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon'' for the inauguration ceremony of the center. Additionally, parents and families of Lebanese children treated at St. Jude's in Memphis also attended the opening ceremony.

A '''comedy club''' is a venue—typically a [[nightclub]], [[bar (establishment)|bar]], [[casino]], or [[restaurant]]—where people watch or listen to performances, including [[stand-up comedian]]s, improvisational [[comedian]]s, [[impersonator]]s, [[impressionist]]s, [[magic (illusion)|magicians]], [[ventriloquist]]s, and other comedy acts. The term "comedy club" usually refers to venues that feature stand-up comedy, as distinguished from [[improvisational theatre]]s, which host improv or sketch comedy, and variety clubs (which may also host musical acts).

==Types of comedy clubs==
Comedy clubs are usually broken down by comedians into "A rooms", "B rooms", and "C rooms":
*A rooms usually cater to people with movie deals, people with television shows, and generally well known acts.
*B rooms are where the best aspects of both A rooms and C rooms meet. Young comics need B rooms as a stepping stone. These are rooms where someone doing a 10- to 15-minute set (hosting/MCing) can be asked, after they've been going up long enough, to do a 20-minute set (featuring) and so on. These clubs also typically allow dirtier material, since they can become established names for "dirty" comedy or shows that usually cover adult themes.
*C rooms act as "neighborhood" comedy clubs, for the most part. The headliners are not usually very well known or popular, and the audiences are random walk-ins.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13860">The '''double diversion''' is two-part theory about environmental harm that was developed by [[William Freudenburg]] and colleagues beginning in the 1990s, and focusing on "disproportionality" and "distraction."  The concept of disproportionality involves the observation that, rather than being a reflection of overall levels of [[economic activity]], the majority of [[environmental destruction]] is actually due to a relatively small number of economic actors, which enjoy privileged access to [[natural resource]]s, “diverting” those resources for the private benefit of the few.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freudenburg's original work on this concept was carried out in conjunction with his colleague from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Peter Nowak.  The reference to the "double" diversion reflects the argument that this first diversion is made possible in large part by the second—the diversion of attention, or distraction, often ironically relying on the widespread but empirically inaccurate belief that environmental harm is economically beneficial to the population as a whole.

== Historical emphasis on individual factors ==
The double diversion differs from previous theories about responsibility for environmental harm, which tend to focus on overall or average levels of environmental harm.  The most notable example is [[Garret Hardin]]’s 1968 article ''[[The Tragedy of the Commons]]'', which focuses on the conflict between individual self-interest and what benefits the society as a whole.  Hardin illustrates this concept through an example of [[herder]]s sharing an open stretch of [[Arable land|farmland]], which results in each individual developing an incentive to increase his individual number of [[cow]]s.  Hardin argued that as a result, all of the individual herders ignore long-term benefits that result from environmental [[environmental protection|conservation]], resulting in “individual [[rationality]] leading to a collective tragedy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hardin|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tendency to focus on overall impacts continued into the 1970s and 1980s with the development of the [[I&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;PAT]] equation by [[Barry Commoner]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[John Holdren]].  The formula states that human impact on the environmental equals the product of population, affluence, and technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ehrlich|Holdren|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; without considering that all individuals do not have equal environmental impacts.  This is similarly true in the case of [[William R. Catton, Jr.|William Catton]]’s 1980 book ''Overshoot: the Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change'', in which Catton emphasizes the argument that all of us have lifestyles that are based upon a time when our [[carrying capacity]] exceeded human load.  He argues that because we have been unwilling to modify our lifestyles as carrying capacities have been exceeded, subsequent generations are destined to inherit a world of increasing conflict for finite resources &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Catton|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also integral to the individual-emphasis from the writing of this period is the notion of the conflict between economic protection and [[economic growth]].  The typical feeling of this period is articulated through O’Connor (1988, 1991), who sees [[capitalism]] as relying on prosperity for the legitimization of economic expansion.  What occurs as a result, according to O’Connor, is an ever-increasing exploitation of both the environment and workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Berry|2008|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disproportionality and distraction ==
According to the double diversion hypothesis, the emphasis on overall or average levels of individual impacts, which many 20th century authors stressed, ultimately missed the importance of the disproportionate impacts that economic outliers can have on the environment.  According to [[Lisa Berry]], “For societies where a small fraction of the population consumes many more resources or produces much more [[pollution]] than other members, the I&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;PAT model fails to communicate the vast differences in resource consumption that exist within groups.” &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Berry|2008|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvp|Freudenburg|2006}} traces this emphasis to the fact that most scientists are trained to focus on statistical means.  However, according to the double diversion hypothesis, rather than being discarded, the extreme cases need to be the focus of the debate.

When this privileged access is threatened, according to Freudenburg, organized producers use distraction, through privileged accounts” largely unchallenged stories and beliefs that divert attention away from their patterns of research use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These privileged accounts ultimately get repeated so often that they ultimately become “embedded” within our language and thought. If the opposition is still refuses to stay silent and challenges them on their inequitable effects on the environment they engage in a disappearing act, where they do not “respond” why their company has the right enjoy profits of a public good, but instead point to the benefits that the populace supposedly receives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when laws and policies are created, organized interests can expect to receive tangible rewards from the political system, while the remainder of the citizenry can expect to receive mainly symbolic rewards in the form of rhetoric.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double diversion in practice==
The double diversion is a sufficiently new theory for it to not have been tested extensively, but several notable studies suggest that it deserves greater attention. Although no notable counter-examples have yet been provided, their existence is entirely possible.

==In agriculture==
A case study of disproportionality in [[agriculture]] is provided by [[Peter Nowak]] and colleagues, who researched the agricultural practices of several thousand farmers in [[Wisconsin]]. They discuss how the trend of subsistence farms developing into livestock ranches, where the reuse of manure is discouraged, has increased disproportionality of negative environmental practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nowak|Bowen|Cabot|2005|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowak ''et al.'' found that a small number of farmers using non-normative practices had a significantly greater responsibility for environmental damage.  This was true regarding the amount of [[fertilizer]] used, the degree of erosion from the production of croplands, and the amount of [[phosphorus]] that accumulated in watersheds.  The majority of the soil test results are in the high or excessively high range for phosphorus values, with a clear sub-set of outliers that have values up to 900% above the sample mean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nowak|Bowen|Cabot|2005|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because environmental regulations were crafted for the “average” rather than the exceptional farms, the policies did little to curb the runoff from the few farms that created significantly more than “their share” of the phosphorus problem. Nowak et al. concludes that “we are suggesting that indicators of environmental degradation in this situation […] failed to decrease during the 1976–1994 period because of the increasing important of disproportionate contributions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nowak|Bowen|Cabot|2005|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;   	
Disproportionality in agriculture has also been observed in water use, with farmers and organized farm interests in dry western states of the U.S. commonly using 80&amp;nbsp;percent of those state’s water, while only having an economic relevance of 1–3&amp;nbsp;percent of the total economy.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg_2006_15"&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disproportionate effect signifies that twenty thousand times as many jobs would be created if this same amount of water was used in industry.  Nevertheless, the top four percent of all farmers received 55&amp;nbsp;percent of all federal [[crop subsidies]], with this trend of this disproportionality increasing into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reluctance to challenge this status quo can be explained through diversion via the [[Social Multiplier Effect|social multiplier effect]]: even if a given individual does not work in a given industry, that person’s attitudes may be affected by whether his or her friends and relatives do.  Therefore, it makes sense that rural resident would be especially reluctant to criticize the industries or facilities they see as providing jobs for their friends and neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In industry==
Disproportionate effects have also been observed within the [[industry|industrial]] setting in cases of both between and within-group comparisons. These inequalities can be measured using the [[Gini coefficient]], (which ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher number signifying greater inequality.) {{harvp|Freudenburg|2006}} uses this coefficient to establish both between and in-group comparisons of industry toxicity, finding that chemical companies had a level 0.865 in comparison to other industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in-group disproportionality between individual chemical companies was even more substantial, with the 62 chemical company facilities he analyzed producing a Gini coefficient of 0.975. These results are consistent with the [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]], which finds that expectations for proportionate relationships between economic activity and environmental harm can consistently be rejected at very high levels of significance.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg_2006_15"/&gt;

==Automobile pollution==
Disproportionality has also been observed by [[A. Kurniawan]] and [[A. Schmidt-Ott]], who developed a new sensing method in order to measure emissions of individual cars.  As in previous studies by [[Beaton (scientist)|Beaton]] ''et al.'' (1995) and [[Bishop &amp; Stedman]], (1996) they found that contrary to popular belief, a small group of “super polluters” is actually responsible for a disproportionate amount of total emissions.  In this particular study, Kurniawan ''et al.'' found that 5&amp;nbsp;percent of the total vehicles accounted for 43&amp;nbsp;percent of emissions.&lt;ref name="Kurniawan_1"&gt;{{harvp|Kurniawan|Schmidt-Ott|2006|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From these findings, they conclude that “properly maintained vehicles of any age are relatively small contributors to exhaust pollution and that most of the pollution is cause by a small percentage of badly maintained cars.”&lt;ref name="Kurniawan_1"/&gt; Given these results, they suggest that unlike the current policies of most industrialized countries, the best solution is a targeted repair program that focuses on disproportionate polluters.  The benefits of such a policy is demonstrated through are demonstrated by Netherlands where it has been implemented, and the contribution of super-polluters has been greatly diminished.  Nonetheless, the failure of other countries to follow their lead has meant that “about half of the present particulate pollution by passenger cars would be avoidable if adequate monitoring would enable enforcement of existing laws”&lt;ref name="Kurniawan_1"/&gt;

'''Georges François Paul Marie Matheron''' (December 2, 1930 – August 7, 2000) was a French [[mathematician]] and geologist, known as the founder of [[geostatistics]] and a co-founder (together with [[Jean Serra]]) of [[mathematical morphology]]. In 1968, he created the [[Centre de Géostatistique et de Morphologie Mathématique]] at the [[Paris School of Mines]] in [[Fontainebleau]]. He is known for his contributions on [[Kriging]] and mathematical morphology. His seminal work is posted for study and review to the Online Library of the ''Centre de Géostatistique'', Fontainebleau, France.

==Early career==
Matheron graduated from ''[[École Polytechnique]]'' and later ''[[Ecole des Mines de Paris]]'', where he studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[probability]] theory (as a student of [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]]).

From 1954 to 1963, he worked with the French [[Geological Survey]] in Algeria and France, and was influenced by the works of [[Danie G. Krige|Krige]], [[Herbert Sichel|Sichel]], and de Wijs, from the South African school, on the gold deposits of the [[Witwatersrand]]. This influence led him to develop the major concepts of the theory for estimating resources he named Geostatistics.

Matheron’s [''Formule des Minerais Connexes''] became his ''Note Statistique No 1''.  In this paper of November 25, 1954, Matheron derived the degree of associative dependence between lead and silver grades of [[core sample]]s. In his ''Rectificatif'' of January 13, 1955, he revised the arithmetic mean lead and silver grades because his core samples varied in length. He did derive the length-weighted average lead and silver grades but failed to derive the variances of his weighted averages. Neither did he derive the degree of associative dependence between metal grades of ordered core samples as a measure for [[spatial dependence]] between ordered core samples. He did not disclose his primary data set and worked mostly with symbols rather than real measured values such test results for lead and silver in Matheron's core samples. Matheron's ''Interprétations des corrélations entre variables aléatoires lognormales'' of November 29, 1954, was marked ''Note statistisque No 2.'' In this paper, Matheron explored lognormal variables and set the stage for statistics by symbols. Primary data would have allowed him to assess whether or not lead and silver grades departed from the lognormal distribution, or displayed [[spatial dependence]] along core samples in his borehole.

Matheron coined the eponym ''krigeage'' (''[[Kriging]]'') for the first time in his 1960 ''Krigeage d’un Panneau Rectangulaire par sa Périphérie''. In this ''Note géostatistique No 28'', Matheron derived '''''k*''''', his '''estimateur''' and a precursor to the kriged estimate or kriged estimator. In mathematical statistics, Matheron’s '''''k*''''' is the length-weighted average grade of a single panneau in his set. What Matheron failed to derive in this paper was '''''var(k*)''''', the variance of his '''estimateur'''. Matheron presented his ''Stationary Random Function'' at the first colloquium on [[geostatistics]] in the USA. He called on [[Brownian motion]] to conjecture the continuity of his  [[Riemann integral]] but did not explain what Brownian motion and [[ore]] deposits have in common. Matheron, unlike [[John von Neumann]] in 1941 and [[Anders Hald]] in 1952, never worked with [[Riemann sums]]. It was not Professor Dr Georges Matheron but Dr Frederik P Agterberg who derived the distance-weighted average of a set of measured values determined in samples selected at positions with different coordinates in a sample space. What Agterberg did not do was derive the variance of this function.

Matheron did indeed derive length-weighted average grades of core samples and ore blocks but did not derive the variance of these functions. In time, the length-weighted average grade for Matheron's three-dimensional block grade was replaced with the distance-weighted average grade for Agterberg's zero-dimensional point. Both central values turned into honorific kriged estimates or kriged estimators. An infinite set of Agterberg's zero dimensional points fits within any ore block, along any borehole, or inside any sampling unit or sample space. Matheron's block grades and Agterberg's point grades are unique because both are functions without variances.

==Mathematical morphology==
In 1964, Matheron was supervising the PhD [[thesis]] of Jean Serra, dedicated to quantifying the [[ore]] properties of the iron deposit of [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]. Serra came up with the idea of using [[structuring element]]s for the analysis, which led to the concept of [[hit-or-miss transform]]. The theoretical analysis of this transform led Matheron to derive and investigate the concepts of [[erosion (morphology)|erosion]], [[dilation (morphology)|dilation]], [[opening (morphology)|opening]] and [[closing (morphology)|closing]], which became known later as the basic morphological operators. He also developed a tool for [[Granulometry (morphology)|granulometry]], i.e., the computation of a "size distribution", where he mathematically characterizes the concept of size. In December 1964, Matheron and Serra, together with [http://www.cg.ensmp.fr/bibliotheque/1988/FORMERY/Publication/DOC_00617/FORMERY_Publication_00617.pdf Philippe Formery]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, named this approach '''mathematical morphology'''. It has since evolved into a theory and method that is applied in a variety of [[image processing]] problems and tasks, and is researched worldwide&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ([[#serra94|Serra and Soille (Eds.) 1994]])&lt;/ref&gt; (''main article: [[Mathematical morphology]]''). Matheron continued to contribute to mathematical morphology during the years, his best-known contribution being the [[morphological filtering]] theory, which he developed with Serra in the 1980s.

This award was named after Georges Matheron. Matheron Lecturers will be selected by a small committee chaired by the IAMG Vice President. The Georges Matheron Lectures will be held annually during IAMG Conferences and during International Geological Congresses. Each year IAMG selects a Georges Matheron Lecturer who is a scientist with proven research ability in the field of spatial statistics or [[mathematical morphology]]. Beginning at IAMG’2006 in Liège, [[Jean Serra]] was the first recipient of this award in 2006, delivered the first Georges Matheron
Lecture.

==The Centre de Géostatistique et de Morphologie Mathématique==

In 1968, the [[Paris School of Mines]] created the ''[[Centre de Morphologie Mathématique]]'', located in [[Fontainebleau]], France, and named Matheron its first director. In 1979, the center was renamed ''[[Centre de Géostatistique et de Morphologie Mathématique]]'', and, in 1986, the latter was split into two separate centers: ''[[Centre de Géostatistique]]'', directed by Matheron, and ''Centre de Morphologie Mathématique'', directed by Serra.

'''''Human Universals''''' is a book by [[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]], an American professor of [[anthropology]] ([[emeritus]]) who worked at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. It was published by [[McGraw Hill]] in 1991. Brown says human universals, "comprise those features of culture, society, language, behavior, and psyche for which there are no known exception."

According to Brown, there are many universals common to all human societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first = Donald E. |last = Brown |authorlink = Donald Brown (anthropologist) |coauthors = |title = Human Universals |publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] |year = 1991 |location = New York City |pages = |url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 0-87722-841-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://condor.depaul.edu/mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm As quoted by Pinker]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Pinker]] lists all Brown's universals in the appendix of his book ''[[The Blank Slate]]''.&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;Pinker, Steven 2002. ''[[The Blank Slate]]: the modern denial of human nature''. New York: Viking. Appendix: Donald E. Brown's list of human universals.&lt;/ref&gt; The list includes several hundred universals, and notes Brown's later article on human universals in ''The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences''. Brown's universals are not all unique to humans, and many are realized differently in different societies.

The list is seen by Brown (and Pinker) to be evidence of mental [[adaptation]]s to communal life in our species' evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=Pinker/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p53&lt;/sup&gt; The issues raised by Brown's list are essentially [[darwinian]]. They occur in Darwin's ''[[Descent of Man]]'' (1871) and ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' (1872), and in Huxley's ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'' (1863). The list gives little emphasis to the issues of [[aggression]], physical conflict and warfare, which have an extensive literature in [[ethology]].&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz, Konrad 1966. ''[[On Aggression]]''. London: Methuen.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown's list does have [[conflict (process)|conflict]] and its [[mediation]] as items. He also makes note of the fact that human males are more prone to violence and aggression than females.

'''Hydroids''' are a [[biological life cycle|life stage]] for most animals of the class [[Hydrozoa]], small predators related to [[jellyfish]]. Some hydroids such as the freshwater ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' are solitary, with the [[polyp]] attached directly to the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. When these produce buds, they become detached and grow on as new individuals.

[[File:PSM V08 D028 Diagram of a section of hydroid.jpg|thumb|left|Section through a hydroid]]

The majority of hydroids are [[colony (biology)|colonial]]. The original polyp is anchored to a solid [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] and forms a bud which remains attached to its parent. This in turn buds and in this way a stem is formed. The arrangement of polyps and the branching of the stem is characteristic of the species.

Some species have the polyps budding directly off the [[stolon]] which roots the colony. The polyps are connected by [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] which surrounds a gastrovascular cavity. The epidermis secretes a [[chitin]]ous skeleton which supports the stem and in some hydroids, the skeleton extends into a cup shape surrounding the polyp.

Most of the polyps are [[gastrozooid]]s or feeding polyps, but some are specialised reproductive structures known as [[gonozooid]]s. In some species, further specialised [[zooid]]s are formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R.

The '''Via Delphi Institute for Research on Marine Mammals''' is a Mexican [[non-profit organization]] endorsed to generate scientific knowledge about [[marine mammal]]s, mostly of the ''[[Tursiops truncatus]]'' species. The research center is located in the state of [[Quintana Roo]], near [[Cancún]], where the scientific members make indoor studies; by the other side, The Via Delphi Institute conducts research programs with wild [[dolphin]] populations from the [[Campeche]] and [[Tabasco]] costs, in the [[Gulf of Mexico]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harteresearchinstitute.org/ebook/ch04-marine-mammals.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Holbox]] Island, located in the Mexican [[Caribbean sea]]. 
The Institute is divided in two working groups, one composed of [[biologist]]s and the other of [[veterinarian]]s, both supported by thesis students and volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Via Delphi Institute supports thesis students in their research and writing process.

==History and achievements==
The '''Via Delphi Institute''' was formally constituted in 2007 with the sign of a Cooperation Agreement with the National Autonomous University of Mexico [[UNAM]]. This agreement establishes some sets for scientific programs between the Via Delphi Institute, the Biology Institute and the Sciences and Veterinary faculty of UNAM. 
Also, the Via Delphi Institute has worked with CINVESTAV (from the [[National Polytechnic Institute]]) in [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]], the University of [[Veracruz]], the University of San Nicolas de Hidalgo, [[Michoacán]], and the Tec Institute of Seas Studies in Veracruz, among others.

==Research certification==
With a certification given by the RENIECYT through the National Commission of Science and Technology [[CONACYT]], the Via Delphi Institute receives official support from this recognized public commission, providing it an important status in the Mexican scientific research field. 
As a result of the Institute's research more than 61 works had been submitted in various worldwide forums, including: The Annual Meeting of the Marine Mammal Society, IMATA, The International Association of Aquatic Mammals and the meetings of the International Association of Aquatic Mammals Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;DELGADO-ESTRELLA, A.

==''Tursiops truncatus'' Breeding program==
One of the most successful projects of the Via Delphi Institute is the ''Tursiops truncatus'' breeding program. This program has been optimized for 17 years, reaching a meticulous system of veterinary medicine and medical training. The result of this period of work has permitted to reach a survival average of 70%. During the 2008 Via Delphi reached a 100% survival rate, obtaining a record never registered of 11 successful births.  The previous achievement inscribes the Via Delphi's Breeding program on the [[Guinness World Records]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/es/recent_records_24.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intergroup dialogue''' is a "face to face facilitated conversation between members of two or more social identity groups that strives to create new levels of understanding, relating and action." This process promotes conversation around controversial issues, specifically, in order to generate new "collective visions" that uphold the dignity of all people.&lt;ref name="Bridging Differences"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zúñiga|first1=Ximena|title=Bridging Differences through Dialogue |url=http://academic.udayton.edu/JamesOlive/ClassMaterials/EDC551/Zuniga%20%282002%29.pdf |publisher=About Campus |accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergroup dialogue is based in the philosophies of the democratic and popular education movements. It is most commonly used on college campuses, but may assume different namesakes in other settings.

== History ==

Intergroup dialogue is rooted in "philosophical and cultural traditions that have valued dialogue as a method of communication and inquiry" to explore shared concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schoem &amp; Hurtado (Eds.)|title=Intergroup dialogue: Deliberative democracy in school, college, community and workplace|location=Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press|pages=306–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; These traditions heavily influenced 20th century movements for [[democratic education]], which included intergroup dialogue as a core objective. The application of dialogue in education was a core tenet of the democratic education movement, drawing on the work of public intellectuals like [[John Dewey]] who envisioned "schools as social centers" that "educate youth for democratic citizenship." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benson|first1=Harkavy|title=The Enduring Appeal of Community Schools|journal=American Educator|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey and other advocates of democratic education at the time envisioned dialogue as "the practice of deliberative democracy." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trifonas|first1=Peter|title=Revolutionary Pedagogies: Cultural Politics, Instituting Education and the Discourse of Theory|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civic engagement]], [[experiential learning]] and [[student-centered learning]] are also products of this movement. For example, [[Paulo Freire]], a core figure in [[popular education]], adopted a theoretical approach to intergroup dialogue that emphasized the importance of people's own experiences, and need to build dialogue capacity to enable people to "analyze their situation and take action to transform themselves and their conditions.” [[Myles Horton]], another popular education thinker, co-founded the [[Highlander Research and Education Center]] (1932) - one of the earliest U.S. mainstream examples of a community center that offered dialogue, "popular education and literacy...as a means of promoting civic participation and social action organizing." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Minkler|first1=Meredith (Ed.)|title=Community Organizing and Community Building for Health and Welfare|date=2012|publisher=Rutgers Press|location=New Jersey|page=65|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intergroup education movement in the 1940s and 1950s built upon the idea of "dialogue as liberatory educational practice," also drawing from feminist, antiracist and [[critical theory]] as well as the Intergroup [[Contact hypothesis]]. This movement was a response in some capacities to 20th century U.S. political turmoil. The [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], the rapid internal movement of [[African Americans]] from the rural South to the industrial north, contributed to considerable social unrest within the United States. Similar effects were felt in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] with the mass migration of [[Mexican Americans]] following [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Zúñiga, Nagda et. al."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zúñiga, Nagda et. al.|title=Intergroup Dialogue in Higher Education: Meaningful Learning About Social Justice|date=October 13, 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intergroup education was the foundation for "antibias, antiracist, multicultural, [and] [[social justice]] education" that sought to address this unrest, primarily in college campus settings.&lt;ref name="Zúñiga, Nagda et. al." /&gt; In the 1980s, the [[University of Michigan]] inaugurated its [http://igr.umich.edu/ Program on Intergroup Relations], which inspired similar models at a number of universities throughout the U.S. The growing popularity of intergroup dialogue programs on college campuses coincided with other shifts in higher education, including, for instance, the integration of [[Critical race theory]] as academic discipline in law and other fields.

== Methodology and Approach ==

=== Intergroup Dialogue Goals ===

Intergroup dialogue is intended to build relationships amongst participants with different social identities through the use of personal storytelling, empathetic listening and interpersonal inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Joohan|last2=Kim|first2=Eun Joo|title=Theorizing Dialogic Deliberation: Everyday Political Talk as Communicative Action and Dialogue|journal=Communication Theory|date=2008|volume=18|issue=1|pages=51–70|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2007.00313.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It integrates three core educational goals: "consciousness raising, building relationships across differences and conflicts, and strengthening individual and collective capacities to promote social justice." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuniga|first1=Ximena|last2=Nagda|first2=Biren|last3=Chesler|first3=Mark|last4=Cytron-Walker|first4=Adena|title=Intergroup Dialogue in Higher Education|date=2007|publisher=Wiley Periodicals, Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=9780787995799|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intergroup dialogue distinguishes its approach from other dialogic methods such as debate and discussion.

==== Dialogic Goals ====

'''Debate:''' To clarify pros and cons of issues, to develop critical thinking skills

'''Discussion:''' To generate different perspectives on issues, to consider decisions among different options

'''Intergroup Dialogue:'''To increase critical self and societal awareness, to increase intergroup communication, understand and collaborative actions&lt;ref name="Zúñiga, Nagda et. al." /&gt;

|}

=== Multi-partiality ===

Intergroup dialogue draws the work of  [[Freire]] whose work focuses on consciousness raising, a process through which members of an oppressed group come to understand the history and circumstances of their oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freire|first1=Paolo|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed|date=1970|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|location=New York, NY|isbn=0826412769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergroup dialogue further aims to raise the consciousness of all participants, including those from advantaged and disadvantaged groups, through the use of  multi-partial facilitation. This approach was developed by Janet Rifkin, Professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, as a method of conflict resolution, and was adopted by the Program on Intergroup Relations as a method of facilitating dialogue across difference of social identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roger|first1=Fisher|title=Multipartiality|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MX3FfacNco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A multi-partial approach to facilitation differs from both a neutral or impartial approach, as well as a model in which the facilitator acts as an advocate, such as in many feminist models. Multi-partial facilitation acknowledges the presence of “dominant narratives”, within dialogue, or sets of assumptions and beliefs based on socialization and cultural values. If the facilitator were to be impartial and neutral in moments of conflict between dialogue participants, the dominant narrative would affirm the experiences and voices of the dominant group members and further marginalize the experience of marginalized participants. A multi-partial facilitation approach differs from facilitator-advocate approaches in that it is equally invested in the participation and growth of all dialogue participants; it encourages self-reflection and awareness through engagement rather than direct confrontation, an approach based on the belief that “people who are not feeling threatened are more open to discussing their feelings and interests and are more open to discussing the effects the conflict is having on both groups.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephan|first1=W|title=Psychological and Communication Processes Associated With Intergroup Conflict Resolution|journal=Small Group Research|date=2008|volume=39|issue=28|doi= 10.1177/1046496407313413|pages=28–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than directly confronting a group member’s bias,  a multi-partial facilitator “pursues” the dominant narrative and encourages group members to share their experiences, while simultaneously encouraging a critical analysis of the underlying assumptions and narratives at play.

== Presence on College Campuses ==

Universities worldwide offer intergroup dialogue programs to their students. Intergroup dialogue programs are frequently launched as part of larger campus diversity and social justice initiatives seeking to address tensions and conflict related to social identity, most centrally, race.  Campuses vary in their approach to intergroup dialogue, "tailor[ing] to the specific needs of the campus, school, academic department or student affairs unit that it serves." &lt;ref name="Bridging Differences" /&gt; Dialogue groups are generally housed in on-campus organizations or academic departments, included as course offerings in [[Social Work]], [[Sociology]], [[Psychology]], [[American Studies]], [[Peace and Conflict Studies]] and [[Education]]. Students enrolled in intergroup dialogue coursework are typically required to complete supplementary readings, reflections, papers and in some cases, field work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zúñiga|first1=Ximena|title=Fostering Intergroup Dialogue on Campus: Essential Ingredients|url=http://www.diversityweb.org/digest/w98/fostering.html|website=Diversity Digest|publisher=Association of American Colleges and Universities|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation and Outcomes ==

Research shows that Intergroup dialogue has positive impacts on participants' understanding of diversity and social justice issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alimo|first1=Craig|last2=Kelly|first2=Robert|last3=Clarke|first3=Christine|title=Diversity initiatives in higher education: Intergroup Dialogue Program student outcomes and implications for campus radical climate: A case study|journal=Multicultural Education|date=2002|volume=10|issue=1|pages=49–53|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/216312081}}&lt;/ref&gt; After conducting a qualitative interview study with dialogue participants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yeakley|first1=Anna|title=The nature of prejudice change: Positive and negative change processes arising from intergroup contact experiences.|journal=Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Yeakley found that "connecting through a depth of personal sharing" has been shown to play a significant role in creating positive dialogue outcomes, while participants who "disconnected in response to hurtful intergroup conflicts" reported negative outcomes. Yeakley highlights the importance of facilitator training, and finds that five facilitation skills are essential to promoting positive outcomes:  ( 1 ) creating a safe space, ( 2 ) recognizing signs of negative processes, ( 3 ) encouraging and supporting depth of personal sharing, ( 4 ) engaging conflicts as teachable moments, and ( 5 ) attending to identity differences in awareness and experience.&lt;ref name="Zúñiga, Nagda et. al." /&gt;

The '''International Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project''' (IPAP) is a [[non-profit]] [[corporation]] whose purpose is to "enable, enhance, and propagate" use of [[algorithm]]s for the [[Pharmacotherapy|treatment]] of some [[Axis I disorder|Axis I psychiatric disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Trivedi MH, DeBattista C, Fawcett J, Nelson C, Osser DN, Stein D, Jobson K |year=1998|title=Developing treatment algorithms for unipolar depression in Cyberspace: International Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project (IPAP)|journal=Psychopharmacology Bulletin|volume=34|issue=3|pages=355–359|pmid=9803769}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=International Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project Report |vauthors=Jobson KO, Potter WZ |journal=Psychopharmacology Bulletin |year=1995 |volume=31|number=3 |pages=457–9, 491–500 |pmid=8668749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth O Jobson founded the Project. [[The Dean Foundation]] provides funding.

IPAP has organized and supported several international conferences on [[psychopharmacology]] algorithms.  It has also supported the creation of several algorithms based on [[expert opinion]]. It is now in the process of creating "evidence-based algorithms," that is algorithms created by experts and annotated with the evidence that leads to these algorithms.  A [[schizophrenia]] algorithm has been created and one on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ([[PTSD]]) was released in July 2005. A [[general anxiety disorder]] (GAD) algorithm was released in 2006. Periodic updates of the algorithms are released as the basis of evidence changes.  In addition, the algorithms are being translated into various non-English languages (Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and Thai) as the availability of translators permits.

'''Lichenology''' is the branch of [[mycology]] that studies the [[lichen]]s, [[symbiotic]] [[organism]]s made up of an intimate symbiotic association of a microscopic [[alga]] (or a [[cyanobacterium]]) with a [[Hypha|filament]]ous [[fungus]].

Study of lichens draws knowledge from several disciplines: [[mycology]], [[phycology]], [[microbiology]] and [[botany]]. Scholars of lichenology are known as [[lichenologists]].

The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of lichens was first intensively investigated by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] botanist [[Erik Acharius]] (1757–1819), who is therefore sometimes named the "father of lichenology". Acharius was a student of [[Carl Linnaeus]]. Some of his more important works on the subject, which marked the beginning of lichenology as a discipline, are:

* ''Lichenographiae Suecia prodromus'' (1798)
* ''Methodus lichenum'' (1803)
* ''Lichenographia universalis'' (1810)
* ''Synopsis methodica lichenum'' (1814)

Later lichenologists include the American scientists [[Vernon Ahmadjian]] and [[Edward Tuckerman]] and the [[Russia]]n [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Konstantin Merezhkovsky]], as well as amateurs such as [[Louisa Collings]].

==History==

===The beginnings===

Lichens as a group have received less attention in classical treatises on botany than other groups although the relationship between humans and some species has been documented from early times. Several species have appeared in the works of [[Dioscorides]], [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Theophrastus]] although the studies are not very deep. During the first centuries of the modern age they were usually put forward as examples of [[spontaneous generation]] and their reproductive mechanisms were totally ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). ''A Popular History of British Lichens'' p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; For centuries naturalists had included lichens in diverse groups until in the early 18th century a French researcher [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] in his ''Institutiones Rei Herbariae'' grouped them into their own genus. He adopted the Latin term lichen, which had already been used by Pliny who had imported it from Theophrastus but up until then this term had not been widely employed.&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). ''A Popular History of British Lichens'' p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The original meaning of the Greek word λειχήν (leichen) was moss that in its turn derives from the Greek verb λείχω (liekho) to suck because of the great ability of these organisms to absorb water. In its original use the term signified [[mosses]], [[liverworts]] as well as [[lichens]]. Some forty years later [[Dillenius]] in his ''Historia Muscorum'' made the first division of the group created by Tournefort separating the sub-families [[Usnea]], [[Coralloides]] and [[Lichens]] in response to the morphological characteristics of the lichen [[thallus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Joseph Pitton de Tournefort |title=Institutiones rei herbariae |language=Latin |trans-title=Institutions of botany |volume=1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2BkOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Tournefort%22+%22Institutiones+rei+Herbariae%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tournefort%22%20%22Institutiones%20rei%20Herbariae%22&amp;f=false|year=1700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the revolution in [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] brought in by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] and his new system of classification lichens are retained in the [[Plant]] Kingdom forming a single group [[Lichen]] with eight divisions within the group according to the morphology of the [[thallus]].&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). ''A Popular History of British Lichens''. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years research is shedding new light into the nature of these organisms still classified as plants. A controversial issue surrounding lichens since the early 19th century is their reproduction. In these years a group of researchers faithful to the tenets of Linnaeus considered that lichens reproduced sexually and had sexual reproductive organs, as in other plants, independent of whether asexual reproduction also occurred. Other researchers only considered asexual reproduction by means of [[Propagules]].&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William. ''A Popular History of British Lichens''. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===

Against this background appeared the Swedish botanist [[Erik Acharius]] disciple of Linnaeus, who is today considered the father of lichenology, starting the taxonomy of lichens with his pioneering study of Swedish lichens in Lichenographiae Suecicae Prodromus of 1798 or in his Synopsis Methodica Lichenum, Sistens omnes hujus Ordinis Naturalis of 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Acharius |first=Erik |date=1814 |title=Synopsis Methodica Lichenum: Systens omnes hujus ordinis naturalis detectas |language=Latin |trans-title=Synopsis of lichen Methods, systems of this natural order detected |publisher=Svanborg}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies and classifications are the cornerstone of subsequent investigations. In these early years of structuring the new discipline various works of outstanding scientific importance appeared such as Lichenographia Europaea Reformata published in 1831 by [[Elias Fries]] or Enumeratio Critico Lichenum Europaeorum 1850 by [[Ludwig Schaerer]]&lt;ref&gt;http://plants.jstor.org/person/bm000391348?history=true&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). ''A Popular History of British Lichens''. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Erik Acharius.jpg|thumb|Erik Acharius (1757–1819), Swedish botanist, the father of lichenology]] But these works suffer from being superficial and mere lists of species without further physiological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = Albert | year = 1895 | title = The Biological Status of Lichens | url = | journal = Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club | volume = 22 | issue = | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It took until the middle of the 19th century for research to catch up using biochemical and physiological methods. In Germany [[Ernst Itzigsohn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_search.php?id=3942 | title=Harvard University Herbaria &amp; Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johann Bayrhoffer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_search.php?mode=details&amp;botanistid=1617 | title=Harvard University Herbaria &amp; Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; in France [[Edmond Tulasne]] and [[Camille Montagne]], in Russia [[Fedor Buhse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_search.php?id=63245 | title=Harvard University Herbaria &amp; Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; in England [[William Allport Leighton]] and in the United States [[Edward Tuckerman]] began to publish works of great scientific importance.

Scientific publications settled many unknown facts about lichens. In the French publication [[Annales des Sciences Naturelles]] in an article of 1852 "Memorie pour servir a l'Histoire des Lichens Organographique et Physiologique" by [[Edmond Tulasne]], the reproductive organs or apothecia of lichens was identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Thomas A. | year = 1856 | title = The Status of the Algo-Lichen Hypothesis | url = | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 23 | issue = 265 | pages = 1–8 | doi =10.1086/274846 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). ''A Popular History of British Lichens''. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

These new discoveries were becoming increasingly contradictory for scientists. The [[apothecium]] reproductive organ being unique to [[fungi]] but absent in other [[photosynthetic]] organisms. With improvements in [[microscopy]], [[algae]] were identified in the lichen structure, which heightened the contradictions. At first the presence of algae was taken as being due to contamination due to collection of samples in damp conditions and they were not considered as being in a [[symbiotic]] relation with the fungal part of the thallus. That the algae continued to multiply showed that they were not mere contaminants.

It was [[Anton de Bary]] a German [[mycologist]] who specialised in [[phytopathology]] who first suggested in 1865 that lichens were merely the result of parasitism of various fungi of the [[ascomycetes]] group by [[nostoc]] type algae and others. Successive studies such as those carried out by [[Andrei Famintsyn]] and [[Baranetzky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_search.php?mode=details&amp;id=70084 | title=Harvard University Herbaria &amp; Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1867 showed no dependence of the algal component upon the lichen thallus and that the algal component could live independently of the thallus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fink | first1 = Bruce | year = 1913 | title = The Nature and Classification of Lichens: II. The Lichen and its Algal Host | doi = 10.2307/3753090 | journal = Mycologia | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 97–166 | jstor = 3753090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in 1869 that [[Simon Schwendener]] demonstrated that all lichens were the result of fungal attack on the cells of algal cells and that all these algae also exist free in nature. This researcher was the first to recognise the dual nature of lichens as a result of the capture of the algal component by the fungal component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Honegger | first1 = Rosmarie | year = 2000 | title = Simon Schwendener (1829–1919) and The Dual Hypothesis of Lichens | doi = 10.1639/0007-2745(2000)103[0307:ssatdh]2.0.co;2 | journal = The Bryologist | volume = 103 | issue = 2 | pages = 307–313 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873 [[Jean-Baptiste Edouard Bornet]] concluded form studying many different lichen species that the relationship between fungi and algae was purely [[symbiotic]]. It was also established that algae could associate with many different fungi to form different lichen [[phenotypes]]. [[File:Édouard Bornet.jpg|thumb|French botanist (Jean-Baptiste) Édouard Bornet (1828–1911)]]

===20th century===

In 1909 the Russian lichenologist [[Konstantin Mereschkowski]] presented a research paper "The Theory of two Plasms as the basis of [[Symbiogenesis]], A new study on the Origin of Organisms", which aims to explain a new theory of Symbiogenesis by lichens and other organisms as evidenced by his earlier work "Nature and Origin of [[Chromatophores]] in the Plant Kingdom". These new ideas can be studied today under the title of the Theory of [[Endosymbiosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cavalier-Smith | first1 = T | year = 2003 | title = Microbial Muddles | doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[1008:mm]2.0.co;2 | journal = BioScience | volume = 53 | issue = 10 | pages = 1008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the above studies the dual nature of lichens remained no more than a theory until in 1939 the Swiss researcher Eugen A Thomas&lt;ref&gt;[[Species:Eugen A. Thomas]]&lt;/ref&gt; was able to reproduce in the laboratory the phenotype of the lichen ''[[Cladonia pyxidata]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.voyageurcountry.com/htmls/floweringplants/plants/pixiecups.html | title=Pixie Cups (Cladonia pyxidata)}}&lt;/ref&gt; by combining its two identified components.

During the 20th century botany and mycology were still attempting to solve the two main problems surrounding lichens. On the one hand the definition of lichens and the relationship between the two symbionts and the taxonomic position of these organisms within the plant and fungal kingdoms. There appeared numerous renowned researchers within the field of lichenology [[Henry Nicollon des Abbayes]], [[William Alfred Weber]], [[Antonina Georgievna Borissova]], [[Irwin M. Brodo]], [[George Albert Llano]].

Lichenology has found applications beyond [[biology]] itself in the field of [[geology]] in a technique known as [[lichenometry]] where the age of an exposed surface can be found by studying the age of lichens growing on them. Age dating in this way can be absolute or relative because the growth of these organisms can be arrested under various conditions. The technique provides an average age of the older individual lichens providing a minimum age of the medium being studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Procesos biofísicos actuales en medios fríos: estudios recientes |language=Spanish |trans-title=Current biophysical processes in cold environments: recent studies |editor=Antonio Gómez Ortiz |date=1998 |publisher=Edicions Universitat Barcelona |url=https://books.google.com/?id=r_LQ70GnOnoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA327&amp;dq=lichenometry#v=onepage&amp;q=lichenometry&amp;f=false|isbn=9788447519231 }} Miguel Mateo Garcia, The Growth Curve of Rhizocarpon geographicum in the Valley of Madriu Andorra, Biophysical Processes in Cold Media {{ISBN|84-475-1923-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichenometry relies upon the fact that the maximum diameter of the largest thallus of an [[epilithic]] lichen growing on a substrate is directly proportional to the time from first exposure of the area to the environment as seen in studies by [[Roland Beschel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geomorphology.org.uk/assets/publications/subsections/pdfs/OnsitePublicationSubsection/91/4.2.7_lichenometry.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203072554/http://www.geomorphology.org.uk/assets/publications/subsections/pdfs/OnsitePublicationSubsection/91/4.2.7_lichenometry.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1950 and is especially useful in areas exposed for less than 1000 years. Growth is greatest in the first 20 to 100 years with 15–50&amp;nbsp;mm growth per year and less in the following years with average growth of 2–4&amp;nbsp;mm per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xASdKCoT6McC&amp;pg=PA562&amp;dq=lichenometry#v=onepage&amp;q=lichenometry&amp;f=false |last=Schaetzl Randall |first=J; |author2=Sharon Anderson |year=2005 |title=Soils Genesis &amp; Geomorphology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=562 |isbn=978-0521812016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of giving a definition applicable to every known lichen has been debated since lichenologists first recognised the dual nature of lichens. In 1982 the [[International Association for Lichenology]] convened a meeting to adopt a single definition of lichen drawing on the proposals of a committee. The chairman of this committee was the renowned researcher [[Vernon Ahmadjian]]. The definition finally adopted was that lichen could be considered as the association between a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a thallus of specific structure.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 1989"&gt;David L. Hawksworth (1989) "Interactions Fungus and Alga in Lichen Symbiosis liquenoides" ''Annals of the Botanical Garden of Madrid'' (46).&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a simple [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] definition soon brought criticism from various lichenologists and there soon emerged reviews and suggestions for amendments. For example, [[David L. Hawksworth]] considered the definition imperfect because it is impossible to determine which one thallus is of a specific structure since thalli changed depending upon the substrate and conditions in which they developed. This researcher represents one of the main trends among lichenologists who consider it impossible to give a single definition to lichens since they are a unique type of organism.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 1989"/&gt;

Today studies in lichenology are not restricted to the description and taxonomy of lichens but have application in various scientific fields. Especially important are studies on [[environmental quality]] that are made through the interaction of lichens with their environment. Lichen is extremely sensitive to various air pollutants, especially to [[sulphur dioxide]], which causes [[acid rain]] and prevents water absorption.

==Lichens in pharmacology==
Although several species of lichen have been used in [[traditional medicine]] it was not until the early 20th century that modern science became interested in them. The discovery of various substances with [[antibacterial]] action in lichen thalli was essential for scientists to become aware of the possible importance of these organisms to [[medicine]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://lichens.science.oregonstate.edu/antibiotics/lichen_antibiotics.htm] Mike Crockett, Stacie Kageyama, Delfina Homen, Carrie Lewis, Jane Osborn, Logan Sander (2003). "Antibacterial Properties of four Pacific North West Lichens".&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1940s there appeared various works by the noted [[microbiologist]] [[Rufus Paul Burkholder]] who demonstrated antibacterial action of lichens of the genus ''[[Usnea]]'' against ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' and ''[[Sarcina lutea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://modmedmicrobes.wikispaces.com/Sarcina+Lutea | title=Wikispaces}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies showed that the substance that inhibited growth of bacteria was [[usnic acid]]. Something similar occurred with the substance [[Ramelina]] synthesised by the lichen ''[[Ramalina reticulata]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/106/2756/394.extract | doi=10.1126/science.106.2756.394| pmid=17750561| title=Antibiotic Compound Isolated from the Lichen Ramalina reticulata| journal=Science| volume=106| issue=2756| pages=394–395| year=1947| last1=Marshak| first1=A.| last2=Barry| first2=G. T.| last3=Craig| first3=L. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, these substances proved ineffective against [[Gram negative bacteria]] such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]''. With these investigations the number of antibacterial substances and possible drug targets known to be produced by lichens increased [[ergosterol]], [[usnic acid]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Bustinza, Francisco (1948) "Contribution to the Study of Antibiotics Produced by Lichens". ''Annals of the Botanical Garden of Madrid'' (7) ISSN pp. 511–548.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in the potential of substances synthesised by lichens increased with the end of [[World War II]] along with the growing interest in all [[antibiotic]] substances. In 1947 antibacterial action was identified in extracts of ''[[Cetraria islandica]]'' and the compounds identified as responsible for bacterial inhibition were shown to be [[d-protolichosteric acid]] and [[d-1-usnic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;Bustinza, Francisco (1951) "Contribution to the Study of Antibacterial Activity in ''Cetraria islandica''". ''Annals of the Botanical Garden of Madrid'' (10) ISSN pp. 144–149.&lt;/ref&gt; Further investigations have identified novel antibacterial substances, [[Alectosarmentin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Antibacterial action of substances produced by lichens is related to their ability to disrupt bacterial [[proteins]] with a subsequent loss of bacterial [[metabolic]] capacity. This is possible due to the action of lichen [[Natural phenol|phenol]]ics such as [[usnic acid]] derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;Neli Kika Honda &amp; Wagner Vilegas (1998) "The Chemistry of Lichens" (Port)[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0100-40421999000100018&amp;lng=in&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=in] Quimica Nova 22(1) ISSN 0100-4042&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s the lichen product [[usnic acid]] was the object of most [[antitumour]] research. These studies revealed some [[in vitro]] antitumour activity by substances identified in two common lichens ''[[Peltigera leucophlebia]]'' and ''[[Collema flaccidum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/search.ebi?db=allebi&amp;t=%22Collema+flaccidum%22 | title=EBI Search}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such eggs could then be fertilized by sperm.  The procedure was conceived by [[Calum MacKellar]], a Scottish bioethicist. With this technique, two males could be the biological parents of a child. However, such a procedure would additionally require an [[artificial womb]] or a female [[gestational carrier]].&lt;ref name="EBR"&gt;[http://www.bioethics.org.uk/2_fathrs.htm EUROPEAN BIOETHICAL RESEARCH: "CHILDREN WITH TWO GENETIC FATHERS"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070727053609/http://www.bioethics.org.uk/2_fathrs.htm |date=2007-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/4753986/Genetic-offspring-for-gays-a-possibility.html Telegraph.co.uk: "Genetic offspring for gays 'a possibility'"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn19 New Scientist: "Baby talk"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/genetics_reproduction/timeline.html CBC news: "Timeline: Assisted reproduction and birth control"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/940790.stm BBC News: "Male-only conception 'highly speculative'"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGS"&gt;[http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=3904 Center for Genetics and Society: "Are male eggs and female sperm on the horizon?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Metalearning' has previously been applied to the fields of [[Social Psychology]] and [[Computer Science]] but in this context exists an entirely new concept.

The theory of Metalearning builds off earlier work by Doya into the learning algorithms of [[Supervised learning]], [[Reinforcement learning]] and [[Unsupervised learning]] in the [[Cerebellum]], [[Basal Ganglia]] and [[Cerebral Cortex]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| last = [[Doya]]
| first = K.
| title = What are the computations of the cerebellum, the basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex?
| publisher = Neural Networks

| url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608099000465
| accessdate = 2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory emerged from efforts to unify the dynamic selection process for these three learning algorithms to a regulatory mechanism reducible to individual neurotransmitters.

==Roles of Neuromodulators==

===Dopamine===
[[Dopamine]] is proposed to act as a "global learning" signal, critical to prediction of rewards and [[Reinforcement learning|action reinforcement]]. In this way, dopamine is involved in a learning algorithm in which Actor, Environment and Critic are bound in a dynamic interplay that ultimately seeks to maximise the sum of future rewards by producing an optimal [[action selection]] policy. In this context, Critic and Actor are characterised as independent network edges that also form a single Complex Agent. This Agent collectively influences the information state of the Environment, which is fed back to the Agent for future computations. Through a separate pathway, Environment is also fed back to Critic in the form of the reward gained though the given action, meaning an equilibrium can be reached between the predicted reward of given policy for a given state, and the evolving prospect of future rewards.

===Serotonin===
[[Serotonin]] is proposed to control the balance between short and long term reward prediction, essentially by variably "discounting" expected future reward sums that may require too much expenditure to achieve. In this way, serotonin may facilitate the expectation of reward at a quasi-emotional level, and thus either encourage or discourage persistence in reward-seeking behaviour depending on the demand of the task, and the duration of persistence required. As global reward prediction would theoretically result from Serotonin modulated computations reaching a [[steady state]] with the computations similarly modulated by [[Dopamine]]; high serotonergic signalling may override the computations of Dopamine and produce a divergent paradigm of reward not mathematically viable through the dopamine modulated computations alone.

===Norepinephrine===
[[Norepinephrine]] is proposed to facilitate "wide exploration" by [[stochastic]] [[action selection]]. The choice between focusing on known, effective strategies or selecting new, experimental ones is known in [[probability theory]] as the [[Multi-armed bandit|Exploration-Exploitation Problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| last = [[Usher (neuroscience)|Usher]]
| title = The Role of Locus Coeruleus in the Regulation of Cognitive Performance
| publisher = Science
| year = 1999
| url =http://www.sciencemag.org/content/283/5401/549.short
| accessdate = 2013-08-04|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interplay between situational urgency, and the effectiveness of known strategies thus influences the dilemma between reliable selection for the largest predicted reward, and exploratory selection outside known parameters. Since neuronal firing cascades (such as those required to perfectly swing a golf club) are by definition unstable and prone to variation; Norepinephrine thus selects for the most reliable known execution pattern at higher levels, and allows for more random and unreliable selection at low levels with the purpose of potentially discovering more efficient strategies in the process.

===Acetylcholine===
[[Acetylcholine]] is proposed to facilitate the balance between memory storage and memory renewal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| last = [[Hasselmo]]
| first = Michael
| title = Acetylcholine and memory
| publisher = Trends in Neurosciences
| year = 1993
| url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016622369390159J
| accessdate = 2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding an optimal balance between stability and effectiveness of learning algorithms for the specific environmental task. Acetylcholine thus modulates [[neuroplasticity|plasticity]] in the [[Hippocampus]], [[Cerebral Cortex]] and [[Striatum]] to facilitate ideal learning conditions in the brain. High levels of Acetylcholine would thus allow for very rapid learning and remodelling of synaptic connections, with the consequence that existing learning may become undone. Likewise, the learning of states that takes place over an extended [[temporal resolution]] may be overridden before it reaches a functional level, and thus learning may occur too quickly to actually be performed efficiently. At lower levels of Norepinephrine, plastic changes are proposed to occur much more slowly, potentially being protective against unhelpful learning conditions or allowing for information changes to embody a much broader temporal resolution.

==Metalearning==
Central to the idea of Metalearning is that global learning can be modelled as function of efficient selection of these four [[Neuromodulation|neuromodulators]]. While no [[Substitution model#Mechanistic vs. empirical models|mechanistic model]] is put forward for where Metalearning ultimately exists in the hierarchy of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], the model has thus far demonstrated the [[Dynamical system|dynamics]] necessary to infer the existence of such an agent in biological learning as a whole. While [[computational models]] and information systems are still far away from approaching the complexity of human learning; Metalearning provides a promising path forwards for the future evolution of such systems as they increasingly approach the complexity of the biological world.

==Potential Applications==
The investigation of Metalearning as a neuroscientific concept has potential benefits to both the understanding and treatment of [[Mental disorder|Psychiatric Disease]], as well as bridging the gaps between [[Neural network|Neural Networks]], [[Computer Science]] and [[Machine Learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''NAMM Oral History Program''' was created and is funded by [[NAMM]], the International Association of Music Products. The program was approved by the NAMM board of directors in the years before the association, which is known for its yearly trade shows, was ready to celebrate the 100 anniversary of the organization. The first NAMM Oral History was conducted in April 2000 with former [[Gibson Guitar]] president [[Ted McCarty]]. McCarty signed [[Les Paul]] on to Gibson in the 1950s to lend his name to the now famous [[Gibson Les Paul]] Guitar. Paul was interviewed as part of the NAMM Oral History program back in 2008.

== History ==

Over the years the collection sought to capture, archive and share the stories of those who have inspired people to make music!  As a result, instrument creators such as [[Hartley Peavey]] and [[Remo]] Belli have been included as well as music retailers, music publishers and those who can fill in the history of the companies, products and people who shaped the industry such as musicians, composers, method book authors, factory workers and salesman of musical products.

Music industry pioneers that have been interviewed for the NAMM Oral History program include [[Bob Moog]], [[Don Buchla]], Henry Z. [[Steinway]], [[Bob Taylor (luthier)]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]].

The collection also includes music retailers and the history of such store chains as [[Sam Ash]] and [[Guitar Center]] as well as independent music stores around the world such as West Music and Newton Piano.

Among the musicians linked to the music industry and thus interviewed for this collection are those who designed an instrument, endorsed a product or wrote a method book that has inspired others to make music.  These include [[B. B. King]], [[Roy Clark]], [[Joe Morello]] and [[Herbie Hancock]].

The first interview to be donated to the collection was conducted in 1996 with jazzman [[Jonah Jones]].  Jones spoke of his relationship with [[King Musical Instruments]] as a product tester and endorser.  He later played an [[F. E. Olds]] trumpet, which was featured on many recordings during his long career.

In the Spring of 2011 NAMM announced the completion of its 1,500th interview.  Later that year Mr. and Mrs. Tom Lee of [[Tom Lee Music]] in Hong Kong were interviewed together, which was an important addition to the collection.  During the NAMM Summer Show in Nashville in July 2011, music store owner George Gruhn was awarded the first NAMM Oral History Service Award for support that included arranging interviews and providing historic background.  The second NAMM Oral History Service Award was presented to Hal Leonard Publishing CEO Keith Mardak for his decade long support to the program.  With Mardak's help, interviews were completed with music publishers, songwriters, composers and music method book authors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14858">'''Nitrogen assimilation''' is the formation of organic nitrogen compounds like [[amino acid]]s from  inorganic nitrogen compounds present in the environment. Organisms like plants, fungi and certain bacteria that cannot [[nitrogen fixation|fix]] nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) depend on the ability to assimilate [[nitrate]] or [[ammonia]] for their needs. Other organisms, like animals, depend entirely on organic nitrogen from their food.

==Nitrogen assimilation in plants==
Plants absorb nitrogen from the soil in the form of nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).

===pH and Ionic balance during nitrogen assimilation===
[[File:Nitrate ion balance-variants.svg| thumb|upright=0.9 |Different plants use different pathways to different levels. Tomatoes take in a lot of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and accumulate salts in their vacuoles, castor reduces nitrate in the roots to a large extent and excretes the resulting alkali.

Every nitrate ion reduced to ammonia produces one OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion. To maintain a pH balance, the plant must either excrete it into the surrounding medium or neutralize it with organic acids. This results in the medium around the plants roots becoming alkaline when they take up nitrate.

To maintain ionic balance, every NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; taken into the root must be accompanied by either the uptake of a cation or the excretion of an anion. Plants like tomatoes take up metal ions like K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to exactly match every nitrate taken up and store these as the salts of organic acids like [[malate]] and [[oxalate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Plants that reduce nitrates in the shoots and excrete alkali from their roots need to transport the alkali in an inert form from the shoots to the roots. To achieve this they synthesize malic acid in the leaves from neutral precursors like carbohydrates. The potassium ions brought to the leaves along with the nitrate in the xylem are then sent along with the malate to the roots via the phloem. In the roots, the malate is consumed. When malate is converted back to malic acid prior to use, an OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is released and excreted. (RCOO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O -&gt; RCOOH +OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) The potassium ions are then recirculated up the xylem with fresh nitrate. Thus the plants avoid having to absorb and store excess salts and also transport the OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1104/pp.99.3.1118| issn = 0032-0889| volume = 99| issue = 3| pages = 1118–1123| last = Touraine| first = Bruno|author2=Bertrand Muller |author3=Claude Grignon | title = Effect of Phloem-Translocated Malate on NO3− Uptake by Roots of Intact Soybean Plants| journal = Plant Physiology| accessdate = 2013-02-19| date = 1992-07-01| url = http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/99/3/1118| pmc = 1080591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nucleomorphs''' are small, vestigial eukaryotic nuclei found between the inner and outer pairs of membranes in certain [[plastid]]s. They are thought to be vestiges of primitive red and green algal nuclei that were engulfed by a larger eukaryote. Because the nucleomorph lies between two sets of membranes, nucleomorphs support the [[endosymbiotic theory]] and are evidence that the plastids containing them are [[complex plastids]]. Having two sets of membranes indicate that the plastid, a prokaryote, was engulfed by a eukaryote, an alga, which was then engulfed by another eukaryote, the host cell, making the plastid an example of secondary endosymbiosis.&lt;ref name=archibald1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Archibald | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Lane | first2 = C.E. | year = 2009 | title = Going, Going, Not Quite Gone: Nucleomorphs as a Case Study in Nuclear Genome Reduction | url = http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/content/100/5/582.full | journal = Journal of Heredity | volume = 100 | issue = 5| pages = 582–90 | doi=10.1093/jhered/esp055}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reyes&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reyes-Prieto | first1 = Adrian | last2 = Weber | first2 = Andreas P.M. | last3 = Bhattacharya | first3 = Debashish | year = 2007 | title = The Origin and Establishment of the Plastid in Algae and Plants | url = | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 147–68 | pmid = 17600460 | doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.41.110306.130134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both groups of organisms the plastids originate from engulfed [[photoautotroph]]ic [[eukaryote]]s.

Of the two known plastids that contain nucleomorphs, both have four membranes, the nucleomorph residing in the [[periplastidial compartment]], evidence of being engulfed by a eukaryote through [[phagocytosis]].&lt;ref name=archibald1/&gt;

==Nucleomorph genome==
Nucleomorphs represent some of the smallest genomes ever sequenced. After the red or green alga was engulfed by a [[cryptomonad]] or [[chlorarachniophyte]], respectively, its genome was reduced. The nucleomorph genomes of both cryptomonads and chlorarachniophytes converged upon a similar size from larger genomes.  They retained only three chromosomes and many genes were transferred to the nucleus of the host cell, while others were lost entirely.&lt;ref name=archibald1/&gt; Chlorarachniophytes contain a nucleomorph genome that is diploid and cryptomonads contain a nucleomorph genome that is tetraploid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Polyploidy of Endosymbiotically Derived Genomes in Complex Algae|url = http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/4/974|journal = Genome Biology and Evolution|date = 2014-04-01|issn = 1759-6653|pmc = 4007541|pmid = 24709562|pages = 974–980|volume = 6|issue = 4|doi = 10.1093/gbe/evu071|first = Yoshihisa|last = Hirakawa|first2 = Ken-Ichiro|last2 = Ishida}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unique combination of host cell and complex plastid results in cells with four genomes: two [[prokaryotic]] genomes ([[mitochondrion]] and [[plastid]] of the red or green alga) and two [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] genomes (nucleus of host cell and nucleomorph).

The model cryptomonad ''Guillardia theta'' became an important focus for scientists studying nucleomorphs. Its complete nucleomorph sequence was published in 2001, coming in at 551 Kbp. The ''G. theta'' sequence gave insight as to what genes were retained in nucleomorphs. Most of the genes that moved to the host cell involved protein synthesis, leaving behind a compact genome with mostly single-copy “housekeeping” genes (affecting transcription, translation, protein folding and degradation and splicing) and no mobile elements. The genome contains 513 genes, 465 of which code for protein. Thirty genes are considered “plastid” genes, coding for plastid proteins.&lt;ref name=archibald1/&gt;&lt;ref name=archibald2&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Archibald | first1 = John M | year = 2007 | title = Nucleomorph Genomes: Structure, Function, Origin and Evolution | doi = 10.1002/bies.20551 | journal = BioEssays | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 392–402 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another organism, the chlorarachniophyte ''Bigelowiella natans'' also has had its genome sequenced, and provides an interesting comparison to ''G. theta''. Whereas the nucleomorph in ''G. theta'' supposedly came from a red algae, ''B. natans'' nucleomorph is likely the vestigal nucleus of a green algae. The ''B. natans'' genome is smaller than that of ''G. theta'', with about 373 Kbp. The ''B. natans'' genome contains 293 genes that code for proteins as compared to the 465 genes in ''G. theta''. ''B. natans'' also only has 17 genes that code for plastid proteins, again fewer than ''G. theta''. Comparisons between the two organisms have shown that ''B. natans'' contains significantly more introns (852) than ''G. theta'' (17). ''B. natans'' also had smaller introns, ranging from 18-21 bp, whereas ''G. theta''’s introns ranged from 42-52 bp.&lt;ref name=archibald1/&gt;

Both the genomes of ''B. natans'' and ''G. theta'' display evidence of genome reduction besides elimination of genes and tiny size, including elevated composition of adenine (A) and thymine (T), and high substitution rates.&lt;ref name=Gilson2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=archibald2/&gt;&lt;ref name=douglas2&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Douglas | first1 = SE | last2 = Zauner | first2 = S | last3 = Fraunholz | first3 = M | last4 = Beaton | first4 = M | last5 = Penny | first5 = S | display-authors = etal   | year = 2001 | title = The highly reduced genome of an enslaved algal nucleus | bibcode = 2001Natur.410.1091D | doi = 10.1038/35074092| journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 410 | issue = | pages = 1091–1096 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persistence of nucleomorphs==
There are no recorded instances of vestigial nuclei in any other secondary plastid-containing organisms, yet they have been retained independently in the cryptomonads and chlorarachniophytes. Plastid gene transfer happens frequently in many organisms, and it is unusual that these nucleomorphs have not disappeared entirely. One theory as to why these nucleomorphs have not disappeared as they have in other groups is that [[introns]] present in nucleomorphs are not recognized by host [[spliceosomes]] because they are too small and therefore cannot be cut and later incorporated into host DNA.

Nucleomorphs also often code for many of their own critical functions, like transcription and translation.&lt;ref name=curtis&gt;Curtis, Bruce et al. "[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v492/n7427/full/nature11681.html Algal genomes reveal evolutionary mosaicism and the fate of nucleomorphs]." ''Nature'' 492 :59-65&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that as long as there exists a gene in the nucleomorph that codes for proteins necessary for the plastid’s functioning that are not produced by the host cell, the nucleomorph will persist.&lt;ref name=archibald1/&gt;

OMNeT++ itself is a simulation framework (not a simulator) without models for [[network protocols]] like [[Internet Protocol|IP]] or [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]]. The main computer network simulation models are available in several external frameworks. The most commonly used one is INET &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://inet.omnetpp.org/|title=INET Framework|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/inet-framework/inet|title=INET framework for the OMNeT++ discrete event simulator|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offers a variety of models for all kind of network protocols and technologies like for [[IPv6]], [[Border Gateway Protocol|BGP]] etc. INET also offers a set of [[mobility model]]s to simulate the node movement in simulations. The INET models are licensed under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]] or [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/blob/master/License|title=INET License|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6652">'''Obstacles to troop movement''' represent either natural, human habitat originated, constructed, concealed obstacles, or obstructive impediments to movement of military troops and their vehicles, or to their visibility. By impeding [[strategic movement|strategic]], [[operational mobility|operational]] or [[tactical manoeuvre]], the obstacle represents an added barrier between opposing combat forces, and therefore prevent achievement of objectives and goals specified in the operational planning schedule. The constructed obstacles are used as an aid to defending a position or area as part of the general [[defensive plan]] of the commander. The obstacles that originate from the human habitat can be converted by troops into constructed obstacles by either performing additional construction, or executing demolitions to obstruct movement over the transport network, to create a [[choke point]], or to deny traversing of an area to the enemy. The natural obstacles can be used defensively by securing a more difficult to breach defensive position by for example securing a flank on terrain that is deemed impossible to traverse, thus denying the enemy an ability to close into combat range of direct fire weapons.

==Role of obstacles==
Obstacles are used in combat operations to create [[choke point]]s, deny [[mobility corridor]]s and [[avenue of approach]] to positions, to enhance field of fire for direct fire weapons, or to protect [[key tactical terrain]] features to the enemy.

==Natural obstacles==
Natural obstacles are represented by those terrain features that for which few troops and their vehicles have capability to traverse. They include water obstacles, or areas of poor drainage such as lakes, rivers, swamps and marshes. The former two can be crossed by [[amphibious vehicles]] capable of swimming, or vehicles capable of [[deep wading]] after preparation, or by constructing a water crossing, and thus creating an easily targeted choke point. Soil and rock can also represent mobility obstacles if the soil is too soft and unable to support the weight of the military vehicles, or the terrain is fractured by cliffs, or large boulders that make organised movement impossible. While soft soil is relative to [[vehicle ground pressure]], there is little that can be done to negotiate very rocky terrain or cliffs except by using specially trained [[light infantry]] troops. Vegetation such as [[jungle]]s or dense [[forest]]s can also represent obstacles to movement, in some cases even to light infantry troops. Some natural obstacles can be a result of climatic or soil activity such as deep snow that by covering all terrain makes safe traversing difficult and slow, or [[landslide]]s that may create an obstruction suddenly despite previously clear [[route reconnaissance]] report.

==Habitat obstacles==
While human habitat had, since early construction of roads, sought to create ways of negotiating terrain faster, the human activity on the landscape can create obstacles in its own right. Artificial lakes and ponds, canals, and areas of agricultural cultivation, particularly those that are water-intensive such as rice-paddy fields create obstacles often more difficult then the natural equivalents. Mining activity creates quarries, and the building of roads, rail roads and dams also involve construction of cuts and fills. Seeded tree-line [[windbreak]]s, [[hedgerow]]s, stone walls and plantation forests also disrupt mobility, particularly of vehicles. Lastly the urban areas in themselves represent obstacles by offering elevated firing positions and canyon-like choke points by forcing the opponent to advance through the streets.

==Constructed obstacles==
Constructed obstacles are those prepared by [[military engineering]] troops, often [[combat engineer]]s, by either using materials to construct impediments to foot and vehicle-borne troops, or by using demolition methods, or excavation such as an [[abatis]], to create obstacles from natural materials and terrain in specific location in accordance with the overall plan of operations. Sometimes such obstacles can be created intentionally or unintentionally through effects of [[artillery fire cratering]]. Buildings demolished due to combat or aerial bombing become very effective obstacles as rubble represents difficult to negotiate and irregular piles of building materials.

==Concealed obstacles==
Concealed obstacles are used with the intention of not only preventing movement of enemy troops, but also causing casualties during attempted movement. Although one of the oldest forms of obstacle use, this became far deadlier with the invention of the [[Land mine|mine warfare]], and more so with air-delivered scattered submunition minelets that can create an instant minefield.

==Obstructive obstacles==
Obstructive obstacles are used primarily to deny terrain visibility to the enemy, thus creating uncertainty in targeting friendly troops. Although ancient in use as [[tar smoke pot]]s, modern [[smoke screen]]s are temporary and are used as a tactical measure during manoeuvring, often when a unit is performing a [[position change]].

==Obstacle negotiation==
Ground troops prefer to deal with physical obstacles by circumventing them as rapidly as possible, thus avoiding becoming [[stationary target]]s to the enemy direct and indirect fire weapons, and aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;p.296, Liddell Hart&lt;/ref&gt; Where this is not possible, in modern warfare the most expedient measures taken against constructed or urban obstacles are to either use armoured vehicles, preferably tanks, to remove the obstacle, or to demolish them by firing [[High Explosive]] munitions at them. Where combat engineers are present, they can perform this using their specialist skills and tools or vehicles. In the case of natural obstacles, specialist engineering equipment is usually required to negotiate the obstacle, commonly bridging or pontoons. The solution to obstacle bridging had at the strategic level created new forms of warfare and employment of troops in the amphibious operations, and later the airborne operations. At the operational level the use of helicopters in airmobile operations offers a vertical option to negotiating obstacles, often of considerable extent such as mountain passes or extensive areas of impossible vegetation.

The '''Oxford Leadership Academy''' (OLA) is an international leadership consultancy based in [[Oxford]], United Kingdom. The firm specialises in values-driven [[leadership development]], strategy execution and [[culture change]] in complex global organizations. The company aims to improve the social responsibility and ethical commitments of business leaders. It has 200,000 alumni and 215 people in 28 countries.

==Philosophy==
The company supports the [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) movement, a form of corporate self-regulation integrated into a business model. Brian Bacon, OLA's President says: The company’s consulting processes and approach to leadership development are influenced by the work of [[Willis Harman]], [[Ken Wilber]], [[Peter Senge]], Joseph Jaworski and [[Margaret Wheatley]].

== Programmes and services ==
The main activities of the company are consulting in strategy execution, leadership development and culture change for multinational corporations. It also undertakes pro-bono work in support of non-profit organisations, including Girl Scouts USA and the British Red Cross.

== History ==
The company had its origins in Australia in 1983 when Brian Bacon formed the management consulting arm of global advertising agency DDB Needham. The company supported the implementation of global marketing strategies for the Ford Motor Company, McDonald’s, P&amp;G and Glaxo from 1983 to 1989. In 1990, the company separated from DDB Needham, and became International Pacific Consulting (IPC).

From 1990  to 2000 the company worked with the micro-economic reform agenda of the Australian Federal Government, mainly on organisational reform in federal government, the national power industry and telecom sector as well as for global clients such as Volvo, Ericsson, Scandia, Pharmacia and Levi’s; and  international agencies including the ILO and the United Nations in Geneva and New York.

The CEO, Brian Bacon, served on the WBA Board as Regional Vice-Chair for Europe from 1988-1996.  He considers the thought leadership of [http://www.worldbusiness.org] World Business Academy co-founder [[Willis Harman]], to be a major influence in the work of OLA. 
In 1996, IPC Worldwide was engaged by [[Karen Jespersen]], then the Danish Minister of Social Affairs, to engage prominent business executives to contribute to the debate on the social responsibility of enterprises and to encourage businesses to take initiatives which are designed to increase the social well-being both of their own staff and the local community in which they are located. More than 250 delegates from international companies and organisations, along with ministers and representatives of 17 governments were invited to discuss new partnerships for social cohesion at a conference on 16–18 October 1997 [http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/1997/10/inbrief/dk9710135n.htm]. This initiative, known as ‘New Partnerships for Social Cohesion’ involved representatives of international business in a "think-tank’ in conjunction with members of the European Commission, the International Institute for Labour Studies (ILO), the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO), the United Nations Development Programme ([[UNDP]]), the [[Japan Institute of Labour]] and  representatives of Danish labour market organisations. This effort resulted in the formation of The Copenhagen Centre, which later became the Danish Centre for CSR in the Danish Commerce and Companies Agency.

Seeking to continue this work further, in 1999 IPC Worldwide joined with Oxford Research in Denmark (representative of Oxford Analytica in the Nordic countries ) to form Oxford IPC Worldwide, a strategic management consultancy firm. In 2000 the company entered into a new phase of growth with major strategy execution consulting assignments for McDonald’s (2002–present) and for the Mexican Government. Brian Bacon was a special advisor to Mexico President [[Vicente Fox]] from 2000- 2006. On behalf of the Mexican Government Office of Innovation and Quality he led the leadership development and strategic focusing of several Government Ministries and the Cabinet of the President. During this time, the company also supported the EU with the Balkans Stability Pact in conjunction with Swedish Government Agency, International IDEA [[International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance]], working closely with Foreign Minister [[Anna Lind]].

The company relocated its headquarters, UK to Oxford in 2005 and became the Oxford Leadership Academy. The founding directors of OLA were Dr Kim Moller, Dr Ron Nahser, Alan Johnson and Brian Bacon. Oxford Leadership Academy opened its offices in UK, Denmark and Hong Kong in 2005; Stockholm, Sweden in 2009; San Francisco, USA in 2010 and Madrid, Spain in 2011.

OLA is engaged in the leadership consulting and training of top management teams for multinational clients including [[Unilever]], [[Telefónica]], [[AkzoNobel]], [[BASF]] in 28 countries. it also provides pro-bono leadership training for non-profit organisations including the Girl Scouts USA and the British Red Cross.

== Administration ==
Cyril Legrand is Chief Executive Officer since May 2011. He was previously a senior executive with French multinational Pernod Ricard in Asia before joining Oxford Leadership as Director of Client service in 2009. He is an alumnus of HEC in Paris and Oxford Said Business School.

Dr. Kim Moller is co-founder and President of Oxford Leadership in Nordic Region and Chairman of the Oxford Research, a sister company of Oxford Leadership. He is a strategist and researcher, formerly with [[Copenhagen Business School]].

Brian Bacon is Chairman and Founder of Oxford Leadership Academy. He was previously a Founding Trustee and President of World Business Academy. He was a mentor and strategy advisor to McDonald’s CEO Charlie Bell from 2002 to 2005; a special advisor to Mexican president [[Vicente Fox]] and the Office of Government Innovation from 2002 to 2006. He was a special advisor to the Swedish Government in the modernization of the Foreign Ministry from 2004 to 2006. He is a former visiting scholar at the International Institute of Labour Studies in Geneva and has been an advisor to the governments of Australia, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Thailand and Sweden.

The Supervisory Board of Oxford Leadership Academy comprises Brian Bacon (Chairman) UK, Andre Bischoff (Commercial Director) UK, Cyril Legrand (CEO) France, Thomas Hurley (President USA), Juan Carlos Murillo (President Mexico), Ken O'Donnell (Vice Chair Latin America) Brazil, Juan Rovira (Vice Chair Iberia) Spain, Dr Kim Moller (President Nordic) Denmark, Lasse Wrennmark (Head of Leadership Training)Sweden, Kazemaru Yukawa-Bacon(Zenergy Academy Division) USA, Dr Erika Kleestorfer (Senior Fellow) Austria.

== Awards ==
In 1997, Brian Bacon was awarded the Willis Harman Award by the [http://www.worldbusiness.org/] World Business Academy, inspired by the work of [[Willis Harman]], a social scientist who articulated the possibility for humankind to transcend the limits of outmoded thinking.

In 2006, Brian Bacon received the INNOVA Award from the Mexican president Vicente Fox,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Artist Zhu Haogu created the '''''Paradise of Maitreya''''' (彌勒佛說法圖) wall painting during China’s [[Yuan Dynasty]]. The painting was originally housed in the Xinghua Si Temple of Xiaoning, [[Shanxi]]. During the 1920s and 1930s, it was disassembled and moved to the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] (ROM) of [[Toronto]], Canada, where it remains today. Museum officials have undertaken a series of restorations to preserve and stabilize the painting. Currently, it can be found in the museum’s "Bishop White Gallery of Chinese Temple Art" as part of the Far Eastern Collection and is described as one of its must-see Iconic Objects.&lt;ref name="ROM 2013"&gt;Royal Ontario Museum, [http://images.rom.on.ca/public/index.php?function=image&amp;action=simpledetail&amp;image_name=ROM2006_7153_1 ''The Paradise of Maitreya wall-painting''], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting features the [[Bodhisattva]] [[Maitreya]],&lt;ref name="ROM 2012"&gt;Royal Ontario Museum, [http://www.rom.on.ca/en/collections-research/rom-channel/iconic-paradise-meitreya ''Iconic: The Paradise of Maitreya''], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; a future Buddha who is foretold to appear on Earth in order to help humans achieve enlightenment through the teachings of dharma.&lt;ref name ="McBride"&gt;McBride &amp; Richard, ''Silla Buddhism and the Hwarang'', ''Korean Studies, 34, 54-89'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==

As it stands today, the wall painting measures 502&amp;nbsp;cm in height and 1101&amp;nbsp;cm in length and has a symmetrical composition, notable for its high level of detail.&lt;ref name="ROM 2013" /&gt; It features Buddha Maitreya in the centre of an imagined heaven, surrounded on both sides by monks and the ruling king and queen. Although Buddha Maitreya is commonly depicted as an Indian figure, all of the characters in The Paradise of Maitreya are found to be wearing Chinese robes and clothing.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt;

The piece foretells the coming of the coming of the Buddha Maitreya, who is said to appear on Earth in its darkest hour to save humanity from [[samsara]].&lt;ref name ="McBride" /&gt; The royal family depicted in the painting is gathering the first assembly; leading 84,000 newly converted followers into salvation. Both the king and the queen have bald, shaven heads,&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt; which, in Buddhist culture, represents turning towards enlightenment and nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;Eilberg-Schwartz &amp; Doniger ''Off with Her Head!: The Denial of Women's Identity in Myth, Religion and Culture'', University of California Press, page 33, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation ==

The famed painter and Buddhist monk, Zhu Haogu (朱好古), along with his pupil Zhang Boyuan (張伯淵), created the dry fresco painting on the southwestern portion of the Xinghua Si (興化寺) monastery during China’s Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref name ="Mclean"&gt;McLean, Dziadowiec &amp; Kirinkov, [https://www.cac-accr.ca/files/pdf/EJournalVol33_abstract2.pdf "Conservation of the Chinese Temple Painting The Paradise of Maitreya from the Bishop White Gallery, Royal Ontario Museum"], 2005&lt;/ref&gt; To prepare the monastery wall for this type of painting, it was covered first with a mudded layer of clay, followed by a layer of straw and additional layer of clay, giving the surface a workable texture. From there, a light carbon ink and colour pigments were used to create the image, which would have been copied from a smaller-scale version.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt;

== Movement ==

During the 1920s, the various armies of the [[Warlord Era|Chinese warlords]] would often plunder small villages in search of valuable goods. Fearing The Paradise of Maitreya was in danger of theft, the monks of Xinghua Si removed the work from the wall and partitioned it into 63 pieces so that it could be securely stored and hidden in [[Taiyuan]]. While the painting survived the plundering, it faced environmental threats from fire and draught in its new location. Instead of allowing the work to undergo further degradation, the monks began approaching art dealers, hoping to sell it.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt;

In 1928, Anglican Bishop [[William White (Bishop of Honan)]] heard of the sale and proceeded to purchase the painting. Over the following 5&amp;nbsp;year period, the piece was shipped from Taiyuan to [[Tianjin]], then taken via American Express to Boston, and from there was taken to Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum by train.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt;

== Restoration at the Royal Ontario Museum ==

While the painting suffered notable damage following its removal from the Xinghua si monastery, restoration efforts made by the ROM have led The Paradise of Maitreya to become one of the best preserved pieces from the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref name="ROM 2013" /&gt;

=== Initial restoration ===

Restoration on the piece commenced in 1933 with structural treatment to reassemble the 63 panels the painting was partitioned into. During the work’s movement, a significant amount of degradation had occurred, causing loss and disfigurement.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt; After the initial restoration was completed, George Stout mounted the painting on the north wall of the ROM’s Bishop White Gallery. It was placed on Masonite panels developed at the [[Fogg Museum|Fogg Art Museum]] using a [[polyvinyl acetate]] resin.&lt;ref name ="Mclean" /&gt;

=== Renaissance ROM ===

As part of a museum-wide restoration effort put on by the ROM in 2005, ''The Paradise of Maitreya'' received further attention addressing surface and structural issues. Plastazote LD45 was used to undertake general breakdowns in the joint material of the [[Masonite]] panels for its flexibility and imperviousness to humidity.&lt;ref name ="Mclean" /&gt;

== Dating ==

While ''The Paradise of Maitreya'' arrived in the ROM in 1933, it wasn’t until 1940 when Bishop William C. White became the first to propose a date for the painting. A team of students commissioned by White discovered the painting appeared to bear an inscription dictating it was completed on the 14th day of the mid-autumn moon of ''qingshen''. White believed this gave an age that was too young for the painting and that his students had therefore interpreted the inscription incorrectly. Instead, he believed the inscription read the painting was completed in ''wuzu'', not ''qingshen'', which he claimed would date it to be from 1238.&lt;ref name ="Steinhardt"&gt;Steinhardt, "A New Date for the ROM Painting and the Southern Shanxi Buddhist-Daoist Style", "Artibus Asiae, 48, 1, 5-38", 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludwig Bachhofer later researched the painting and found an additional inscription quoting “da Yuan guo” (the great Yuan state). As this title was not used in Yuan until 1271, it made the painting’s date of 1238 inaccurate. He agreed that the painting bore the inscription ''wuzu'', not ''qingshen'', however, as these characters were reused on a 60-year cycle, he instead believed the term ''wuzu'' was referring to the year 1298.&lt;ref name ="Steinhardt" /&gt;

=== Controversy ===

As most of the painting’s inscriptions were not transported to the ROM from China and the Xinghua si monastery fell to ruins in 1938, it is impossible to get a full record of the painting’s background information. Both White and Bachlofer made assumptions in their findings and as such, neither has been able to make a full claim on the painting’s date. As such, ''The Paradise of Maitreya'' remains the most controversial painting from the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, "Further Observations on the Yuan Wall Painter Zhu Haogu and the Relationship of the Chunyang Hall Wall Paintings to The Maitreya Paradise at the ROM", "Artibus Asiae, 52, 1, 94-118", 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phonetically Intuitive English''' ('''PIE''') is a scheme&lt;ref name=pie_scheme&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/phoneticallyintuitiveenglish/using-pie/schemes The PIE scheme]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] [[browser extension]]&lt;ref name=pie_chrome&gt;[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jafbohhbdpejlcfpkbbpkegglokegjid PIE at Chrome Web Store]&lt;/ref&gt; that automatically adds [[diacritics]] to [[English language|English]] words on Web pages to show [[pronunciation]], intended for English-as-a-second-language ([[ESL]]) learners to learn correct pronunciations as they browse the Web, and for children in English-speaking countries to [[Reading education in the United States|learn to read]]. The free project has been reported&lt;ref name=pcworld_english&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/256680/pie_a_chrome_extension_that_can_help_with_reading_and_pronunciation.html PCWorld (English) story on PIE]&lt;/ref&gt; by ''[[PCWorld (magazine)|PCWorld]]'' and other media outlets and invited to National Education Association Exposition 2013, receiving very positive feedback from educators nationwide.

== Features ==
The [[free and open source]] browser extension&lt;ref name=pie_chrome /&gt; uses [[American English]] pronunciation data from the [[CMU Pronouncing Dictionary]] and a one-page scheme also called "Phonetically Intuitive English" (PIE)&lt;ref name=pie_scheme /&gt; to mark up English words with diacritics. The project claims that the scheme is designed to be very easy to learn.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/phoneticallyintuitiveenglish/ PIE's official project website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the English level of the user, PIE offers three modes, Full, Lite and Extra Lite, to show diacritics to different extents. The Full mode shows pronunciations to a great detail (e.g. even the silent g and h as in "light" are marked with a "silence mark"). More advanced learners may prefer the Lite mode (e.g. the silence marks on w, h, y and e will be omitted, as in "low", "she", "bay" and "take"). Very advanced learners can use the Extra Lite mode, which will further omit all schwa marks (e.g. the second and third a in "Canada" will have no marks).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6959">'''Planetary nebula luminosity function''' ('''PNLF''') is a secondary&lt;ref name="Ferrareseetal2000" /&gt; [[standard candle|distance indicator]] used in [[astronomy]].   It makes use of the [[O III|[O&amp;nbsp;III]]] λ5007 [[forbidden line]] found in all [[planetary nebula]] (PNe) which are members of the old stellar populations ([[Population II]]).&lt;ref name="Ferrareseetal2000"&gt;{{harvnb|Ferrarese|Ford|Huchra|Kennicutt|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It can be used to determine distances to both [[spiral galaxy|spiral]] and [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] galaxies despite their completely different [[stellar populations]] and is part of the [[Extragalactic Distance Scale]].&lt;ref name="=Schoenberneretal2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Schoenberner|Jacob|Steffen|Sandin|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
The distance estimate to a galaxy using the PNLF requires discovery of such an object in the target galaxy that is visible at λ5007 but not when the entire spectrum is considered.  These points are candidate PNe, however, there are three other types of objects that would also exhibit such an emission line that must be filtered out: [[HII region|HII&amp;nbsp;regions]], [[supernova remnant]]s, and [[Lyα galaxy|Lyα galaxies]]. After the PNe are determined, to estimate a distance one must measure their monochromatic &lt;nowiki&gt;[O&amp;nbsp;III]&lt;/nowiki&gt; λ5007 lumonisity.  What remains is a statistical sample of
PNe.  The observed luminosity function is then fitted to some standard law.&lt;ref name="Ciardullo2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Ciardullo|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, one must estimate the foreground [[interstellar extinction]].  The two sources of extinction, are from within the [[Milky Way]] and the internal extinction of the target galaxy.  The first is well known and can be taken from sources such as reddening maps computed from [[H I region|H&amp;nbsp;I]] measurements and galaxy counts or from [[IRAS]] and [[Diffuse InfraRed Background Experiment|DIRBE]] satellite experiments.  The later type of extinction, occurs only in target galaxies which are either late type [[spiral galaxy|spiral]] or [[irregular galaxy|irregular]].  However, this extinction is difficult to measure.  In the Milky Way, the scale height of PNe is much bigger than that of the dust.  Observational data and models support that this holds true for other galaxies, that the bright edge of the PNLF is primarily due to PNe in front of the dust layer.  The data and models support a less than 0.05 [[apparent magnitude]] internal extinction of a galaxy's PNe.&lt;ref name="Ciardullo2004" /&gt;

== Physics behind process ==
The PNLF method is unbiased by [[metallicity]]. This is because [[oxygen]] is a primary nebular coolant; any drop in its concentration raises the plasma’s electron temperature and raises the amount of [[collisional excitation]]s per ion.  This compensates for having a smaller number of emitting ions in the PNe resulting in little change in the λ5007 emissions .  Consequently, a reduction in oxygen density only lowers the emergent &lt;nowiki&gt;[O&amp;nbsp;III]&lt;/nowiki&gt; λ5007 emission line intensity by approximately the square root of the difference in abundance. At the same time, the PNe’s core responds to metallicity the opposite way. In the case where the metallicity of the progenitor star is smaller, the PNe’s [[central star]] will be a bit more massive and its illuminating ultraviolet flux will be a bit greater. This added energy almost precisely accounts for the decreased emissions of the PNe.  Consequently, the total &lt;nowiki&gt;[O&amp;nbsp;III]&lt;/nowiki&gt; λ5007 lumonisity that is produced by a PNe is practically
uncorrelated to metallicity. This beneficial negation is in agreement with more precise models of PNe evolution.  Only in extremely metal-poor PNe does the brightness of the PNLF cutoff dim by more than a small percentage.&lt;ref name="Ciardullo2004" /&gt;

The relative independence of the PNLF cutoff with respect to population age is harder to understand.  The [O&amp;nbsp;III] λ5007 flux of a PNe directly correlates to the brightness of its central star.  Further, the brightness of its central star directly correlates to its mass and the central star's mass directly varies in relation to its progenitor's mass.  However, by observation, it is demonstrated that reduced brightness does not happen.&lt;ref name="Ciardullo2004" /&gt;

A '''play''' is a form of [[literature]] written by a [[playwright]], usually consisting of [[dialogue]] and singing between [[Character (arts)|characters]], intended for [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]] rather than just [[Reading (process)|reading]]. Plays are performed at a variety of levels, from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], [[Off-Broadway]], [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theater]], to [[Community theatre]], as well as university or school productions. There are rare dramatists, notably [[George Bernard Shaw]], who have had little preference as to whether their plays were performed or read.

==Genres==
[[File:P culture.svg|thumb|right|upright|Symbol of theatre]]

===Comedy===
{{Main article|Comedy}}
Comedies are plays which are designed to be humorous. Comedies are often filled with witty remarks, unusual characters, and strange circumstances. Certain comedies are geared toward different age groups. [[Comedy|Comedies]] were one of the two original play types of [[Ancient Greece]], along with tragedies. An example of a comedy would be [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', or for a more modern example the skits from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name="anarchon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchon.tripod.com/indexGREEKTH.html|title=THE ANCIENT GREEK DRAMA &amp; THEATRE HISTORY PAGE|publisher=anarchon.tripod.com|accessdate=2008-06-16|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theatrehist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/bates001.html|title=Origin of Comedy|publisher=www.theatrehistory.com|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Farce====
{{Main article|Farce}}
A generally nonsensical genre of play, [[farce]]s are often acted and often involve  humor. An example of a farce includes [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'', or [[Mark Twain]]'s play ''[[Is He Dead?]]''.

====Satirical====
{{Main article|Satire}}
A [[satirical|satire]] play takes a comic look at current events  people while at the same time attempting to make a political or social statement, for example pointing out [[corruption]]. An example of a satire would be [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' and [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[Lysistrata]]''. Satire plays are generally one of the most popular forms of comedy, and often considered to be their own genre entirely.

====Restoration comedy====
{{Main article|Restoration comedy}}
Restoration comedy is a genre that explored relationships between men and women, and was considered risqué in its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vernon|first1=P.F.|title=Marriage of Convenience and the Moral Code of Restoration Comedy|journal=Essays of Criticism|date=1962|pages=370–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters featured in restoration comedy included stereotypes of all kinds, and these same stereotypes were found in most plays of this genre, so much so that most plays were very similar in message and content.  However, since restoration comedy dealt with unspoken aspects of relationships, it created a type of connection between audience and performance that was more informal and private.

It is commonly agreed that restoration comedy has origins in [[Molière]]’s theories of comedy, but differs in intention and tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ornament of Action|date=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The inconsistency between restoration comedy’s morals and the morals of the era is something that often arises during the study of this genre.  This may give clues as to why, despite its original success, restoration comedy did not last long in the seventeenth century.  However, in recent years, it has become a topic of interest for theatre theorists, who have been looking into theatre styles that have their own conventions of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Styan|first1=J.L.|title=Restoration Comedy in Performance|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tragedy===
{{Main article|Tragedy}}
These plays contain darker themes such as death and disaster. Often the [[protagonist]] of the play has a [[tragic flaw]], a trait which leads to their downfall. Tragic plays convey all emotions and have very dramatic conflicts. [[Tragedy]] was one of the two original play types of Ancient Greece. Some examples of tragedies include William Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'', and also [[John Webster]]'s play ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]''.&lt;ref name="anarchon" /&gt;

===Historical===
{{Main article|History (theatrical genre)}}
[[File:An actress performs a play in front of 2 statues from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Room 21, the British Museum, London.jpg|thumb|An actress performs a play in front of 2 statues from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Room 21, the British Museum, London]]
[[File:NMT Automatic performing a play in front of the Nereid Monument.jpg|thumb|An actor and actress performing a play in front of the Nereid Monument, Room 17, the British Museum, London]]
These plays focus on actual historical events. They can be tragedies or comedies, but are often neither of these. [[History]] as a separate genre was popularized by [[William Shakespeare]]. Examples of historical plays include [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[Demetrius (play)|Demetrius]]'' and William Shakespeare's ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=V3b2tlWBBUsC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Shakespeare+popularised%22+historical+play | title=The Three Richards: Richard I ... - Google Book Search|publisher=books.google.co.uk|accessdate=2008-06-17|last=|first=| isbn=978-1-85285-521-5| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical theatre===
{{Main article|Musical theatre}}
Ballad opera, a popular theatre style at the time, was the first style of musical to be performed in the American colonies.  The first musical of American origin was premiered in Philadelphia in 1767, and was called “The Disappointment”, however, this play never made it to production.  Around the 1920s, theatre styles were beginning to be defined more clearly.  For musical theatre, this meant that composers gained the right to create every song in the play, and these new plays were held to more specific conventions, such as thirty-two-bar songs.  When the Great Depression came, many people left Broadway for Hollywood, and the atmosphere of Broadway musicals changed significantly. A similar situation occurred during the 1960s, when composers were scarce and musicals lacked vibrancy and entertainment value.

By the 1990s, there were very few original Broadway musicals, as many were recreations of movies or novels.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bordman|first1=Gerald|title=American Musical Theatre|date=1978|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical productions have songs to help explain the story and move the ideas of the play along. They are usually accompanied by dancing. Musicals can be very elaborate in settings and actor performances. Examples of musical productions include ''Wicked'' and ''Fiddler on the Roof''.

===Theatre of Cruelty===
This theatre style originated in the 1940s when Antonin Artaud hypothesized about the effects of expressing through the body as opposed to “by socially conditioned thought.”  In 1946, he wrote a preface to his works in which he explained how he came to write what and the way he did.

Above all, Artaud did not trust language as a means of communication.  Plays within the genre of theatre of cruelty are abstract in convention and content.  Artaud wanted his plays to have an effect and accomplish something.  His intention was to symbolise the subconscious through bodily performances, as he did not believe language could be effective.  Artaud considered his plays to be an enactment rather than a re-enactment, which meant he believed his actors were in reality, rather than re-enacting reality.

His plays dealt with heavy issues such as patients in psych wards, and Nazi Germany.  Through these performances, he wanted to “make the causes of suffering audible”, however, audiences originally reacted poorly, as they were so taken aback by what they saw.  Much of his work was banned in France at the time.

Artaud did not believe that conventional theatre of the time would allow the audience to have a cathartic experience and help heal the wounds of World War II.  For this reason, he moved towards radio-based theatre, in which the audience could use their imagination to connect the words they were hearing to their body.  This made his work much more personal and individualized, which he believed would increase the effectiveness of portraying suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finter|first1=Helga|last2=Griffin|first2=Matthew|title=Antonin Artaud and the Impossible Theatre: The Legacy of the Theatre of Cruelty|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|pages=15–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre of the Absurd===
Theatre of the Absurd: This genre generally includes metaphysical representations of existential qualms and questions.  Theatre of the absurd denies rationality, and embraces the inevitability of falling into the abyss of the human condition.  Instead of discussing these issues, however, theatre of the absurd is a demonstration of them.  This leaves the audience to discuss and question the content of the play for themselves.

One of the main aspects of theatre of the absurd is the physical contradiction to language.  Oftentimes, the dialogue between characters will directly oppose their actions.

Famous playwrights within this genre include Beckett, Sartre, Ionesco, Adamov, and Genet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Esslin|first1=Martin|title=Theatre of the Absurd|date=2001|isbn=1-4000-7523-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "play" can be either a general term, or more specifically refer to a non-musical play. Sometimes the term "straight play" is used in contrast to "[[musical theatre|musical]]", which refers to a play based on [[music]], [[dance]], and [[song]]s sung by the play's characters. For a short play, the term "playlet" is sometimes used.

'''Post-theism''' is a variant of [[nontheism]] that proposes that the division of [[theism]] vs.  [[atheism]] is obsolete, that [[God]] belongs to a stage of human development now past. Within nontheism, post-theism can be contrasted with [[antitheism]].
The term appears in Christian [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] and [[Postchristianity]].

[[Frank Hugh Foster]] in a 1918 lecture announced that modern culture had arrived at a "post-theistic stage" in which humanity has taken possession of the powers of agency and creativity that had formerly been projected upon God.&lt;ref&gt;Gary J. Dorrien , ''The Making of American Liberal Theology: Idealism, Realism, and Modernity, 1900-1950'' (2003), {{ISBN|978-0-664-22355-7}}, p. 177f.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denys Turner]] argues that [[Karl Marx]] did not choose atheism over theism, but rejected the binary "[[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Feuerbach]]ian" choice altogether, a position which by being post-theistic is at the same time necessarily '''post-atheistic'''.&lt;ref&gt;D. Turner, "Religion: Illusions and liberation", in: Terrell Carver (ed), ''The Cambridge Companion to Marx'' (1991), {{ISBN|978-0-521-36694-6}}, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at one point Marx argued "there should be less trifling with the label 'atheism,'” as he insisted "religion in itself is without content, it owes its being not to heaven but to the earth, and with the abolition of distorted reality, of which it is the theory, it will collapse of itself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1842/letters/42_11_30.htm Karl Marx, ''Letter from Marx to Arnold Ruge In Dresden'' (1842)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Related ideas include [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s pronouncement that "[[God is dead]]" and the [[transtheism]] of [[Paul Tillich]] or [[Pema Chödrön]].

      <comment>/* Packet filter example */ Removing 'or certifying compiler': a certifying compiler does not help in this part of the story, since it does not talk about compilation at all (it talks about machine code in the previous section)</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3319">'''Proof-carrying code''' ('''PCC''') is a software mechanism that allows a host system to verify properties about an application via a [[formal proof]] that accompanies the application's executable code.  The host system can quickly verify the validity of the proof, and it can compare the conclusions of the proof to its own [[security policy]] to determine whether the application is safe to execute.  This can be particularly useful in ensuring [[memory safety]] (i.e. preventing issues like [[buffer overflows]]).

Proof-carrying code was originally described in 1996 by [[George Necula]] and [[Peter Lee (computer scientist)|Peter Lee]].

==Packet filter example==
The original publication on proof-carrying code in 1996&lt;ref&gt;Necula, G. C. and Lee, P. 1996. Safe kernel extensions without run-time checking. SIGOPS Operating Systems Review 30, SI (Oct. 1996), 229–243.&lt;/ref&gt; used [[packet filter]]s as an example: a user-mode application hands a function written in machine code to the kernel that determines whether or not an application is interested in processing a particular network packet. Because the packet filter runs in [[kernel mode]], it could compromise the integrity of the system if it contains malicious code that writes to kernel data structures. Traditional approaches to this problem include interpreting a [[domain specific language]] for packet filtering, inserting checks on each memory access ([[software fault isolation]]), and writing the filter in a high-level language which is compiled by the kernel before it is run. These approaches all have severe performance disadvantages for code as frequently run as a packet filter.

With proof-carrying code, the kernel publishes a security policy specifying properties that any packet filter must obey: for example, will not access memory outside of the packet and its scratch memory area. A [[Automated theorem prover|theorem prover]] is used to show that the machine code satisfies this policy. The steps of this proof are recorded and attached to the machine code which is given to the kernel program loader. The program loader can then rapidly validate the proof, allowing it to thereafter run the machine code without any additional checks. If a malicious party modifies either the machine code or the proof, the resulting proof-carrying code is either invalid or harmless (still satisfies the security policy).

According to the RSPB:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The RSPB Medal is the Society's most prestigious award. It is presented to an individual in recognition of wild bird protection and countryside conservation. It is usually awarded annually to one or occasionally two people.&lt;ref name="Gifted"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/media/releases/175798-gifted-naturalist-is-awarded-prestigious-rspb-medal|title=Gifted naturalist is awarded prestigious RSPB medal|last=Reynolds|first=James|date=2007-08-23|publisher=RSPB|accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''RV ''Song of the Whale''''' is a research vessel owned by Marine Conservation Research International and operated by Marine Conservation Research Ltd. The 70-foot vessel was designed specifically to carry out research on cetaceans (and other marine fauna) using benign research techniques such as passive acoustic monitoring.

==Description==
''Song of the Whale'' is a [[Cutter (boat)|cutter-rigged]] steel-hulled research vessel commissioned by the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]] (IFAW) and built in 2004. The vessel was designed by Rogers Yacht Design of [[Lymington]] and built to [[Lloyd's Register|Lloyd's]] Special Service Craft Rules for world-wide service - the first sailing vessel to meet those standards for 30 years.&lt;ref name="IBI Plus"/&gt;  Ordered from Blondecell Ltd, the subcontracted steel hull was fabricated by [[Tata Steel Europe|Corus Steel]] and assembled by Riverside Fabrication at [[Falmouth, Cornwall]]. The addition of the [[Composite material|composite]] superstructure and the full outfitting was carried out at Blondecell's facility at Cracknore Hard, [[Marchwood]], Hampshire.&lt;ref name="MJ 2002"&gt;{{cite news|title=Steel Shipkit In Tune With 'Song of the Whale II'|url=http://www.maritimejournal.com/news101/vessel-build-and-maintenance/ship-and-boatbuilding/steel_shipkit_in_tune_with_song_of_the_whale_ii|accessdate=12 November 2013|newspaper=Maritime Journal|date=1 June 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112191717/http://www.maritimejournal.com/news101/vessel-build-and-maintenance/ship-and-boatbuilding/steel_shipkit_in_tune_with_song_of_the_whale_ii#|archive-date=12 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel cost £1.5 million.&lt;ref name="IBI Plus"&gt;{{cite news|last=Foxwell|first=David|title=Blondecell-built ''Song of the Whale'' delivered to IFAW|url=https://plus.ibinews.com/2004/04/19/Blondecell_built_i_Song_of_the_Whale_i_delivere/|accessdate=12 November 2013|newspaper=IBI Plus|date=19 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design minimises acoustic emissions to facilitate the benign research techniques favoured by her former owners IFAW and the engine-room is encased in a [[Faraday cage]] to contain electrical fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IFAW 70|url=http://www.rogersyachtdesign.com/sections/ifaw70.html|publisher=Rogers Yacht Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BB&gt;{{cite news|title=Halyard sets record for quietest vessel|url=http://www.boatingbusiness.com/news101/industry-news/halyard_sets_record_for_quietest_vessel|accessdate=12 November 2013|newspaper=Boating Business|date=1 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt;  The outfit of ''Song of the Whale'' includes the latest computerised recording and tracking devices to ensure that best and most advanced acoustic research can be carried out. To assist physical observation, there is a two-person [[crow's nest]].&lt;ref name="IBI Plus" /&gt;

The new vessel was launched in St Katharine Docks, London, on  6 June 2004  by [[Pierce Brosnan|Pierce]] and [[Keely Shaye Smith|Keely Brosnan]].&lt;ref name="IBI Plus"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news|last=Kinver|first=Mark|title=Tuning in to the song of the Whale |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6378933.stm|accessdate=12 November 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=27 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ECBC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurocbc.org/piercebrosnan_launches_ifaw_whale_research_vessel_06jun2004page1651.html |title=Bond star launches whale research ship |author=European Cetacean Bycatch Campaign |date=6 June 2004 |publisher= |accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
''Song of the Whale'' was formerly owned by IFAW until 14 March 2014 when the vessel was granted to Marine Conservation Research International of [[Kelvedon]], UK. &lt;ref name="IFAW"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramage|first=Patrick|title=A tale of two whale ships|url=http://www.ifaw.org/united-kingdom/news/video-tale-two-whale-ships|accessdate=10 April 2014|website=IFAW|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is based at [[Ipswich]] and continues to carry out the research for which she designed, using benign techniques. She replaced a smaller vessel of the same name, a converted 46-foot luxury yacht, which had been in service for 17 years.&lt;ref name="IBI Plus"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt;

''Song of the Whale'' carries out most of its research under sail to reduce the impact on the whales and other marine mammals being researched. The focus is on their movement and behaviour. Noise suppression is particularly important when assessing populations of whales as the researchers can listen to their sounds up to 20 miles away using [[hydrophone]] [[Microphone array|arrays]], not relying solely on surface sightings.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt; Research undertaken includes work on the problems of whales becoming entangled in fishing gear or in collisions with ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IFAW research vessel to study endangered whales in U.S. waters|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ifaw-research-vessel-to-study-endangered-whales-in-us-waters-158555925.html|publisher=PR Newswire/IFAW|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marston|first=James|title=Our battle for giants of the deep|url=http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/features_2_511/our_battle_for_giants_of_the_deep_1_170862|accessdate=12 November 2013|newspaper=Ipswich Star (UK)|date=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multidisciplinary practice seeks to raise awareness of the social and ecological value of water in [[urban design]]. The scope of the practice’s work includes strategic catchment-based urban masterplans, urban parks, rivers, civic space and water playgrounds.
Over the past 30 years, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160809183928/http://www.dreiseitl.com/en/start Ramboll Studio Dreiseitl] has accumulated experience in technical water systems, including water storage, treatment and reuse, retention and infiltration techniques, grey and black water systems, climatisation and green roofs.&lt;ref name="Sketch Landscape" /&gt;

[https://web.archive.org/web/20160809183928/http://www.dreiseitl.com/en/start Ramboll Studio Dreiseitl] has been described as “the hidden champion of the German design scene”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/world-architecture-festival-in-singapur-beginnt-a-859012.html |title=Architektur-Spektakel in Singapur: Vom Bauhaus zum Wowhaus |last1=Tröster |first1=Christian|date=October 2, 2012 |website=spiegel.de |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=de |accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Potsdamer Platz view.jpg|thumb|px| [http://www.dreiseitl.com/en/portfolio#potsdamer-plaza Potsdamer Platz]: Ramboll Studio Dreiseitl developed the scheme for rainwater harvest, circulation and display.]]
Ramboll Studio Dreiseitl are responsible for the waterscape on [[Potsdamer Platz]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name=" theconstructionindex" /&gt; Water was central to Renzo Piano and Christoph Kohlbecker’s original design, but it was Ramboll Studio Dreiseitl that conceived and developed the scheme for rainwater harvest, circulation and display and created the many opportunities for engagement with water.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Brenda J (2001). Harvesting What You Can’t Hold Tight. Landscape Architecture Magazine, page 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme is one of the largest urban rainwater harvesting projects in the world&lt;ref&gt;Benson, J. Roe, M (2007). Landscape and Sustainability. Taylor &amp; Francis: London. Page 228.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011, it became one of the first city quarters to be retrospectively awarded the DGNB Certificate of the German Sustainable Building Council (DGNB) in silver.

Another major project in Germany is Arkadien Winnenden, the ecological city design which was named winner of the Green Dot Award ‘Build’ category in 2011. The firm turned the abandoned factory site into an eco-friendly development which combines dense layout with green space, includes permeable paving and waterways which provide natural flood control and a lake which filters rainwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/urban-design/award-winning-german-development-aims-worlds-most-sustainable-neighborhood.html |title=Award-Winning German Development Aims To Be 'The World's Most Sustainable Neighborhood' |last1=Hattam |first1=Jennifer |date=March 24, 2012 |website=treehugger.com |publisher= |accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, projects include the blue [[green infrastructure]] in the Tianjin Cultural Park near Beijing and the water strategy for the central catchment for the city of Singapore, together with the engineers CH2M Hill, as well as the design of the 60ha Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park.&lt;ref name=" theconstructionindex" /&gt; The rehabilitation of the previously concreted Kallang River (which became a dangerous torrent in the rainy season)&lt;ref name="welt" /&gt; employed techniques of water collection and flood control which were entirely new to Singapore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34351">'''Romanesque Revival architecture''', '''Norman Revival architecture''' or '''Neo-Norman''' styles of building were inspired by the [[Romanesque Architecture]] of the 11th and 12th centuries AD.
[[File:WiltonChurch.jpg|thumb|300px|Church of SS Mary and Nicholas, Wilton, Wiltshire, by TH Wyatt, 1841–4]]
In the United Kingdom it started to appear as an architectural style in the 18th. century but reached its greatest popularity in the mid to latter years of the 19th. century. The style can be viewed as a strand of [[Gothic Revival architecture]] and part of the [[Historicism (art)|Historicist or Historismus]] styles of architecture that became popular in both Europe and Britain during the 19th. century. Early examples of the style in Germany of the 1820s and 1830s are referred to as [[Rundbogenstil]] or round arched style.{{sfn|Stratton|1993|pp=54–56}} In Britain the style was introduced by architects and their patrons, who had been on tours in Europe and it appears that the German and British styles of Romanesque developed largely independently. Initially in Britain the style was used for church building, but as the 19th. century progressed it was adapted for public buildings, museums, schools and commercial buildings, but rarely for domestic buildings. By the start of the 20th. century it had gone out of fashion and only occasionally were examples of the style built.

== The origins of the Romanesque Revival or Norman Revival in the United Kingdom ==
[[File:St. Nicholas, Kenilworth, west door.jpg|thumb|left|St. Nicholas, Kenilworth, west door 1570]]
[[File:North Scarle, Lincolnshire.jpg|thumb|150px|North Scarle, Lincolnshire]] 
The development of the ''Norman'' revival style or ''Neo-Norman'' took place over a long time in the British Isles starting with [[Inigo Jones]]‘s [[Window|re-fenestration]] of the White Tower of the [[Tower of London]] in 1637–38 and work at Windsor Castle by [[Hugh May]] for [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], but this was little more than restoration work. More surprising is the west door of Kenilworth Church, inserted in the tower in 1570 probably at the time of a visit of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]. This appears to have been historic arch, sourced possibly from an unknown monastic building,&lt;ref&gt;''Country Life'', 12 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example of Romanesque revival is the south porch of North Scarle Church in Lincolnshire. Pevsner suggests that it might be Elizabethan, but late 17th. century seems more likely as the oak door seems to be original and probably of that date.{{sfn|Antram|Pevsner|Harris|1989|p=587}}

[[File:St Martin's Church, Allerton Mauleverer. - geograph.org.uk - 419918.jpg|thumb|St Martin's Church, Allerton Mauleverer. - by John Vardy, 1745]]

In the 18th century the use of round arched windows was thought of as being [[Saxon]] rather than Norman and examples of buildings with round arched windows include [[Shirburn Castle]] in Oxfordshire, Wentworth in Yorkshire and [[Enmore Castle]] in Somerset. At [[Allerton Mauleverer]] in Yorkshire St Martin’s Church was re-built for Richard Arundell in 1745. The church has been described as a ''proto-Neo-Norman''. While it gives the impression of a Romanesque revival church, with a massive crossing tower and round headed windows, yet it also has windows with gothic tracery and a [[hammerbeam roof|hammerbeam]] nave roof. The architect is thought to have been [[John Vardy]] surveyor to the Office of Works.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leach|Pevsner|2009|p=}}{{page needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tickencote Church - geograph.org.uk - 63353.jpg|thumb|225px|Tickencote Church 1792 Early example of church Romanesque revival]]
A further example of church building in the Romanesque revival style took place in 1792 when Elisa Wingfield commissioned plans from [[Samuel Pepys Cockerell]] for the conservation and rebuilding of [[St Peter's Church, Tickencote]] in Rutland. The church which contained much notable Romanesque decoration and an elaborate [[chancel]] arch appears to have been close to collapse. Cockerell encased the chancel, keeping the arch in position but the outer walls were completely re-built and the exterior ornamentation of arcades and round headed windows were replaced in new stonework. A new tower over a porch was built on the south side, which gave added stability to the older structure. The [[nave]] was completely re-built using some new romanesque mot is and copying others, such as the engaged columns, from those on the exterior of the chancel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Page |editor-first=William |editor-link=William Page (historian)
 |year=1935 |chapter=Tickencote |title=A History of the County of Rutland |volume=II |series=[[Victoria County History]] |place=London |publisher=St Catherine Press |pages=275–281 |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/rutland/vol2/pp275-281 |accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of Romanesque revival architecture is very similar to the style that emerges in the 1840’s under architectects such as [[Thomas Penson]] and [[Benjamin Ferrey]]. Tickencote could be considered to mark the start of the Romanesque revival in church architecture. [[File:Front entrance to Eastnor Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1468597.jpg|thumb|left|Front entrance to Eastnor Castle, Herefordshire, combining Romanesque and Gothic features]] In Scotland the style started to emerge with the Duke of Argyll’s castle at [[Inverary]], started in 1744, and castles by [[Robert Adam]] at [[Culzean]] (1771), Oxenfoord (1780–2), Dalquharran (1782–5), and [[Seton Palace]] (1792). In England [[James Wyatt]] used round arched windows at [[Sandleford Priory]], Berkshire in 1780–79 and the Duke of Norfolk started to rebuild [[Arundel Castle]], while [[Eastnor Castle]] in Herefordshire was built by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]] between 1812 and 1820. At Eastnor Smirke combines a rugged Romanesque with more subtle Gothic window tracery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mowl |first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Mowl |year=1981 |title=The Norman Revival in British Architecture 1790–1870}} PhD Thesis, [[University of Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Development of ''Archaeologically Correct'' Romanesque.&lt;ref&gt;The idea of the ''archaeological correctness'' was popularised by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] in his many writings and he was using the term by 1950 in his Broadcast Talks (page 190) to describe architecture and designs based closely on illustrations of actual buildings or objects.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q8eaBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=Pevsner+archaeologically+correct&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xkM10Y0f1I&amp;sig=gKtc0zp0nG3E71Al_PHmcJZFk5o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuiKPAvJfKAhXIYQ4KHR3hCJwQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pevsner%20archaeologically%20correct&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;==

[[File:Penrhyn Castle - geograph.org.uk - 206536.jpg|thumb|Penrhyn Castle - by Thomas Hopper 1820–37]]
It was at this point that the Norman Revival became a recognisable architectural style. In 1817 [[Thomas Rickman]] published his ''An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation''. It was now realised that ''round-arch architecture'' was largely Romanesque in the British Isles and came to be described as Norman rather than Saxon. This distinction was finally recognised when Rickman’s article in ''Archaeologia'' (1832–33), was published by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rickman |first=Thomas |title=` |journal=Archaeologia |volume=XXV |publisher=[[Society of Antiquaries of London]] |pages=159–185}} esp. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The start of an ''archaeologically correct'' Norman Revival can be recognised in the architecture of [[Thomas Hopper (architect)|Thomas Hopper]]. His first attempt at this style was at [[Gosford Castle]] in Armagh in Ireland, but far more successful was his [[Penrhyn Castle]] near Bangor in North Wales. This was built for the Pennant family, between 1820 and 1837. The style did not catch on for domestic buildings, though many country houses and mock castles were built in the Castle Gothic or Castellated style during the Victorian period, which were mixed Gothic styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mowl |first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Mowl |year=1991 |chapter=Penrhryn and the Norman Revival |series=National Trust Guide |title=Penrhryn Castle, Gwynedd |place= |publisher=National Trust |pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church Architecture and the Romanesque Revival==

[[File:Christ Church, Welshpool. Chancel arcade in apse behind altar.JPG|thumb|Christ Church, Welshpool. Chancel arcade in apse behind altar]]
However, the ''Norman Revival'' did catch on for church architecture. It was [[Thomas Penson]], a Welsh architect, who would have been familiar with Hopper’s work at Penrhyn, who developed Romanesque Revival church architecture. Penson was influenced by French and Belgian Romanesque architecture, and particularly the earlier Romanesque phase of German [[Brick Gothic]]. At St David’s Newtown, 1843–47 and St Agatha’s Llanymynech, 1845, he copies the tower of [[St. Salvator's Cathedral]], Bruges. Other examples of Romanesque revival by Penson are [[Christ Church, Welshpool]], 1839–1844, and the porch to Langedwyn Church. He was an innovator in the use of [[Architectural terracotta|terracotta]] to produce decorative Romanesque mouldings, saving on the expense of stonework.{{sfn|Stratton|1993|p=13}} Penson’s last church in the Romanesque Revival style was [[Rhosllannerchrugog]], Wrexham of 1852&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hubbard |first=E |series=The Buildings of Wales |title=Clwyd |place=London |publisher=Penguin |year=1986 |page=264 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarah Losh and Wreay Church===
A most remarkable example of Romanesque church building was [[St Mary's Church, Wreay|St Mary’s Church at Wreay]], near Carlisle.&lt;ref name=Banerjee&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/losh/1.html |last=Banerjee |first=Jacqueline |title=St Mary's Church, Wreay, by Sarah Losh (1785–1853) |publisher=Victorian Web |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was designed by [[Sarah Losh]] and built between 1841 and 1842. Losh had travelled widely on the Continent and particularly in Italy and drew inspiration from Romanesque sources. Losh is known to have read [[Thomas Hope (architect)|Thomas Hope]]'s ''Historical Study of Architecture'' (1815), which uses the term ''Lombardic'' for the style brought into Italy from the early Christian churches of Constantinople, and she described St Mary's as being an ''unpolished mode of building'' that ''most approximates to early Saxon or modified Lombard''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Uglow |first=Jenny |authorlink=Jenny Uglow |year=2012 |title=The Pinecone: the Story of Sara Losh |place=London |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |isbn=978-0571269501 |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement suggests that at the time of its design Losh was not aware of Thomas Rickman’s re-classification of Saxon and Norman architecture. While the appearance and layout of the church may be considered as Romanesque, her free interpretation of the decoration on the woodwork and the arched stone windows and doors is anticipating the styles of the [[Arts and Crafts]] movement, while the arcading of the [[apse]] certainly has a [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] feel to it.&lt;ref name=Banerjee/&gt;

==Other Early Victorian Architects working in the Romanesque revival style==
The early years of the 1840s saw a considerable upsurge of interest in the developing Romanesque revival style by some of the leading architects of the period. During the 19th century the architecture selected for Anglican churches depended on the churchmanship of particular congregations. Whereas [[high church]]es and [[Anglo-Catholic]], which were influenced by the [[Oxford Movement]], were built in [[Gothic Revival architecture]]; low churches and [[Broad church]]es of the period were often built in the Romanesque Revival style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Clark|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Clark|pages=170–73|title=The Gothic Revival|edition=3rd|year=1962
|publisher=John Murray|location=London|isbn= 0719502330}}, and also Cambridge Camden Society (1841),''A Few Words to Church-builders''[https://archive.org/details/fewwordstochurch00camb].&lt;/ref&gt; The architects specialising in Romanesque revival took their designs from different local styles of the European Romanesque.

===Edmund Sharpe===
Another architect who popularised the Romanesque revival style was [[Edmund Sharpe]], who set up his practice at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] in 1835. At Cambridge he had been a great friend of [[William Whewell]] and presumably of the polymath and architectural historian Professor [[Robert Willis (engineer)|Robert Willis]]. He was awarded a travelling scholarship to study the early architecture of Germany and Southern France and supplied [[Thomas Rickman]] with information.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;O'Donoghue, F. M. (1897), rev. Geoffrey K. Brandwood (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25228 Sharpe, Edmund (1809–1877)], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], Retrieved on 18 February 2012 ({{ODNBsub}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sharpe despite being an architectural historian of some note, built churches that were much freer interpretations of the Romanesque and [[Brick Gothic|German Brick Gothic]] and might be considered less ''archaeologically correct''.

[[File:St Paul's Parish Church, Scotforth, Doorway - geograph.org.uk - 904970.jpg|thumb|St Paul's, Scotforth, Doorway, 1874–6]]
Four of Sharpe's earliest churches&amp;nbsp;– [[St Saviour's Church, Cuerden|St&amp;nbsp;Saviour, Bamber Bridge]] (1836–37);&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2010|p=116}}{{clarification needed |reason=What work is this citing? |date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St Mark's Church, Blackburn|St&amp;nbsp;Mark, Witton]] (1836–38); and [[St Paul's Church, Farington|St&amp;nbsp;Paul, Farington]], near [[Leyland, Lancashire|Leyland]] (1839–40)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2010|p=125}}{{clarification needed |reason=What work is this citing? |date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; – were in the Romanesque style, which he chose because ''no style can be worked so cheap as the Romanesque''. They ''turned out to be little more than rectangular 'preaching boxes'… with no frills and little ornamentation; and many of them were later enlarged''. The only subsequent churches in which Sharpe used Romanesque elements [[St Mary's Church, Conistone]] in [[Wharfedale]] (1846); and [[St Paul's Church, Scotforth|St&amp;nbsp;Paul, Scotforth]] in south Lancaster (1874–6). Sharpe's final essay in the Romanesque Revival style [[St Paul's Church, Scotforth]], was described by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as a ''strange building'' and ''an anachronism, almost beyond belief''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pevsner |first=Nikolaus |authorlink=Nikolaus Pevsner |year=1969 |title=Lancashire |volume=2 The Rural North |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]] |place=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |pages=29, 224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpe had retired from his architectural practice in 1851 He then pursued a career in railway engineering.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donoghue, F.

===Benjamin Ferrey===
[[File:East Grafton - St Nicholas Church - geograph.org.uk - 1448466.jpg|thumb|left|East Grafton - St Nicholas Church, 1842–44]]
[[File:Morpeth, Northumberland, The Church of St James The Great - geograph.org.uk - 223562.jpg|thumb|Morpeth, Northumberland, The Church of St James The Great, 1844–46]] The work of [[Benjamin Ferrey]] can be considered to be similar to that of Thomas Penson, based on the English and French Romanesque traditions. An early example is his church of St Nicholas at [[East Grafton]] in Wiltshire, built in 1842–44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Wiltshire Community History|title=Church of St. Nicholas, East Grafton|url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getchurch.php?id=1184|publisher=Wiltshire Council|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the chancel terminates in an apse and the west has overlapping arcading and [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] decoration over the entrance door. Central crossing tower and arcaded windows on the west frontis approached through a stone Romanesque [[Lych gate]].

A more important work by Ferrey is the Church of St James the Great at [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]], Northumberland. The church, which is supposed to be modelled on the cathedral of [[Monreale]] in Sicily,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tweddle |first=Marilyn |title=A Historical Guide to the Church of St James the Great |place=Morpeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built between 1844 and 1846. The unusual arched gate is acceptably Sicilian in inspiration and is similar to the [[portico]] at the cathedral at [[Monreale]], but the rest of the composition has much more in common with French and Belgian Romanesque. A further church in this style is Christ Church in [[Melplash]] in Dorset of 1845–46. This has a heavy crossing tower and in many respects resembles the Church of St. James the Great at Morpeth.

===William Perkin of Leeds===
St Michael and All Angels [[Barton le Street]], North Yorkshire.
This church was very extensively rebuilt in 1869–71 by William Perkin and his sons of Leeds. Unlike Tickencote there is no record of the church that was replaced. The building contains an extensive and impressive range of genuine romanesque, but these seem to have been largely repositioned. The pews and some other furnishings are in Romanesque revival style. The rebuilding was financed by [[Hugo Francis Meynell Ingram|Hugo Francis Meynell-Ingram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pevsner |first=Nikolaus |authorlink=Nikolaus Pevsner |year=1966 |title=Yorkshire: the North Riding |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]] |place=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=0-14-071029-9 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE| num=1148993 |desc=Church of St Michael |grade=I |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baptist Church, Brown Street, Salisbury - geograph.org.uk - 195730.jpg|thumb|left|Baptist Church, Brown Street, Salisbury]]

In the 1860s Romanesque architecture became a popular style of architecture for [[Dissenting]] chapels. Possibly this was intended to give the impression that they were churches similar to [[Anglican]] churches and they are often referred to as churches rather than chapels. This form of architecture was often chosen by the [[Baptists]]. This architecture is an adapted and debased form of [[Italianate]] Romanesque as seen at the [[Potters Bar|Potter's Bar]] Old Baptist Church in Hertfordshire in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbbc.org.uk/home Potters Bar Baptist Church]&lt;/ref&gt; The Baptist Church in Brown Street [[Salisbury]] of the 1880s is similar in bright red brick and was built in the 1880s. It is noticeably more ''archaeologically correct'' in its use of arched windows and the entrance door. A Baptist Chapel of 1870 by the Lincoln architects [[Michael Drury|Drury and Mortimer]], the Mint Lane Baptist Chapel in Lincoln is in a debased Italianate Romanesque revival style but has a surprising tower in the [[castellated]] Gothic style.{{sfn|Antram|Pevsner|Harris|1989|p=521–2}}

[[File:Grimsby Synagogue - geograph.org.uk - 141647.jpg|thumb|Grimsby Synagogue]]

===Synagogues===
The Romanesque revival was also a style of architecture that appealed to Jewish communities and there are examples of Synagogues in this style. 
One of these is the synagogue built adjacent to the docks at [[Grimsby]] in Lincolnshire.

===Later Romanesque Revival Churches in Scotland===

[[File:West Kirk (geograph 1866764).jpg|thumb|West Kirk, Sandgate, Ayr, by William Gale 1844–45]] 
The earliest example of Romanesque revival architecture in Scotland is the West Kirk, Sandgate, Ayr. By the architect William Gale for the Presbyterian [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church]] and built in 1844–45. The columns used for the windows are very similar to those used by Edmund Sharpe at Scotford church.
In Scotland the [[Church of Scotland|Presbyterian]]s occasionally built in the Romanesque revival style, but only later in the 19th century. 
[[St Conan’s Kirk]] Lochawe, Agyll and Bute is an extraordinary early 20th century church on the shore of Loch Awe, built by Walter Douglas Campbell, brother of the 1st Lord Blythswood, was started in 1881, but not completed until 1930. The kirk is largely Romanesque in style, but is also mixed with other completely unrelated styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britainexpress.com/attractions.htm?attraction=1082 |title=St Conan's Kirk |publisher=Britain Express |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another church is Cranshaws in [[Berwickshire]]. Here the 1739 church was rebuilt in 1899 by architect George Fortune in Romanesque Revival style.

==Sir Alfred Waterhouse and developed Romanesque Architecture==
[[File:Natural History Museum 001.jpg|thumb|left|Natural History Museum 001]]
[[File:Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family in Exile, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family in Exile, London]]
Interest in Romanesque Revival Architecture was renewed by Sir [[Alfred Waterhouse]]'s [[Natural History Museum]] in Kensington, which was built between 1873 and 1881.{{sfn|Stratton|1993|pp=70–77}} It was built in shades of buff coloured [[Architectural terracotta|terracotta]] and opened the way for the Romanesque style to be used for other buildings, apart from churches. Waterhouse tended to mix the architectural styles, often using decorative Romanesque arches to provide impressive entrances for his buildings, and popularised the deep red terracotta produced by manufacturer's in the [[Wrexham]] and [[Ruabon]] area of North-East Wales. This included parts of the Prudential Insurance building in London and the entrance to Strangeways Prison.

Waterhouse inspired other architects to build using terracotta and this material was used by [[William Watkins (architect)|William Watkins]], a Lincoln architect who very successfully used a deep red [[Ruabon]] terracotta for the Lincoln Christ's Hospital Girls School of 1893.{{sfn|Antram|Pevsner|Harris|1989|p=509}} An earlier building by Watkins of 1873, was originally built as a warehouse at 42 Silver Street, Lincoln.

[[File:St Aidans 2754.jpg|thumb|left|St Aidan's Church, Leeds]]
[[St Aidan's Church, Leeds]] is a massive [[basilica]] church built in the tradition of Waterhouse, using red terracotta brickwork. The design was won by competition in 1889 and the church was built between 1891 and 1894 by the Newcastle architects RJ Johnson and A Crawford Hick. The style is a hybrid of Italian, French and German Romaneque and the [[Corbel table]] or moulded [[stringcourse]] below the eaves was based on that of [[Lund Cathedral]] in Sweden. The inside is sumptuously decorated with mosaic decoration by Sir [[Frank Brangwyn]] in the apse and a multi-coloured marble font with Romanesque arcading. The interior columns of the basilica have ornamental [[capital (architecture)|capital]]s in the Byzantine style.{{sfn|Leach|Pevsner|2009|pp=525–7}}

In the 20th.century the use of the Romanesque revival style in church architecture appears to be restricted to brick built churches and often these churches have similarities with churches built in the [[Byzantine Revival architecture|Byzantine revival style]], which became more popular in the early years of the 20th century. 
Churches in the Romanesque revival style include All Saints, Bute Avenue, [[Petersham, London|Petersham]], Richmond-upon-Thames. This Romanesque revival church was designed by J Kelly and completed in 1908.

An even later example of the style is St Francis, Linden Road, Bournville, consecrated in 1925. This church was designed by Harvey and Wicks, the architects of the Bournville Estate

The '''Simplified Instructional Computer''' (also abbreviated SIC) is a hypothetical [[computer]] system introduced in ''System Software: An Introduction to Systems Programming'', by Leland Beck. Due to the fact that most modern microprocessors include subtle, complex functions for the purposes of efficiency, it can be difficult to learn systems programming using a real-world system. The Simplified Instructional Computer solves this by abstracting away these complex behaviors in favor of an architecture that is clear and accessible for those wanting to learn systems programming.

== SIC Architecture ==
The SIC machine has basic addressing, storing most memory addresses hexadecimal integer format. Similar to most modern computing systems, the SIC architecture stores all data in binary and uses the [[two's complement]] to represent negative values at the machine level. Memory storage in SIC consists of 8-bit bytes, and all memory addresses in SIC are byte addresses. Any three consecutive bytes form a 24-bit 'word' value, addressed by the location of the lowest numbered byte in the word value. Numeric values are stored as word values, and character values use the 8-bit [[ASCII]] system. The SIC machine does not support floating-point hardware and have at most 32,768 bytes of memory. There is also a more complicated machine built on top of SIC called the Simplified Instruction Computer with Extra Equipment (SIC/XE). The XE expansion of SIC adds a 48-bit floating point data type, an additional memory addressing mode, and extra memory (1 megabyte instead of 32,768 bytes) to the original machine. All SIC assembly code is upwards compatible with SIC/XE.

SIC machines have several registers, each 24 bits long and having both a numeric and character representation:
:* '''A (0)''': Used for basic arithmetic operations; known as the accumulator register.
:* '''X (1)''': Stores and calculates addresses; known as the index register.
:* '''L (2)''': Used for jumping to specific memory addresses and storing return addresses; known as the linkage register.
:* '''PC (8)''': Contains the address of the next instruction to execute; known as the program counter register.
:* '''SW (9)''': Contains a variety of information, such as carry or overflow flags; known as the status word register.

In addition to the standard SIC registers, there are also four additional general-purpose registers specific to the SIC/XE machine:
:* '''B (3)''': Used for addressing; known as the base register.
:* '''S (4)''': No special use, general purpose register.
:* '''T (5)''': No special use, general purpose register.
:* '''F (6)''': Floating point accumulator register (This register is 48-bits instead of 24).

These five/nine registers allow the SIC or SIC/XE machine to perform most simple tasks in a customized assembly language. In the System Software book, this is used with a theoretical series of operation codes to aid in the understanding of assemblers and linker-loaders required for the execution of [[assembly language]] code.

==Addressing Modes for SIC and SIC/XE==
The Simplified Instruction Computer has three instruction formats, and the Extra Equipment add-on includes a fourth. The instruction formats provide a model for memory and data management. Each format has a different representation in memory:
:*'''Format 1''': Consists of 8 bits of allocated memory to store instructions.
:*'''Format 2''': Consists of 16 bits of allocated memory to store 8 bits of instructions and two 4-bits segments to store operands.
:*'''Format 3''': Consists of 6 bits to store an instruction, 6 bits of flag values, and 12 bits of displacement.
:*'''Format 4''': Only valid on SIC/XE machines, consists of the same elements as format 3, but instead of a 12-bit displacement, stores a 20-bit address.

Both format 3 and format 4 have six-bit flag values in them, consisting of the following flag bits:
:*'''n''': Indirect addressing flag
:*'''i''': Immediate addressing flag
:*'''x''': Indexed addressing flag
:*'''b''': Base address-relative flag
:*'''p''': Program counter-relative flag
:*'''e''': Format 4 instruction flag

==Addressing Modes for SIC/XE==
* Rule 1:
*: e = 0 : format 3
*: e = 1 : format 4
** format 3:
**: b = 1, p = 0    (base relative)
**: b = 0, p = 1    (pc relative)
**: b = 0, p = 0    (direct addressing)
** format 4:
**: b = 0, p = 0    (direct addressing)
**: x = 1    (index)
**: i = 1, n = 0    (immediate)
**: i = 0, n = 1    (indirect)
**: i = 0, n = 0    (SIC)
**: i = 1, n = 1    (SIC/XE for SIC compatible)
* Rule 2:
*: i = 0, n =0	(SIC)
*: b, p, e is part of the address.

== SIC Assembly Syntax ==
SIC uses a special assembly language with its own operation codes that hold the hex values needed to assemble and execute programs. A sample program is provided below to get an idea of what a SIC program might look like. In the code below, there are three columns. The first column represents a forwarded symbol that will store its location in memory. The second column denotes either a SIC instruction (opcode) or a constant value (BYTE or WORD). The third column takes the symbol value obtained by going through the first column and uses it to run the operation specified in the second column. This process creates an object code, and all the object codes are put into an object file to be run by the SIC machine.

If you were to assemble this program, you would get the object code depicted below. The beginning of each line consists of a record type and hex values for memory locations. For example, the top line is an 'H' record, the first 6 hex digits signify its relative starting location, and the last 6 hex digits represent the program's size. The lines throughout are similar, with each 'T' record consisting of 6 hex digits to signify that line's starting location, 2 hex digits to indicate the size (in bytes) of the line, and the object codes that were created during the assembly process.

== Emulating the SIC System ==
Since the SIC and SIC/XE machines are not real machines, the task of actually constructing a SIC emulator is often part of coursework in a systems programming class. The purpose of SIC is to teach introductory-level systems programmers or collegiate students how to write and assemble code below higher-level languages like C and C++. With that being said, there are some sources of SIC-emulating programs across the web, however infrequent they may be.

'''Surroundings''' are the area around a given physical or geographical [[Point (geometry)|point]] or [[Location (geography)|place]].  The exact definition depends on the field. Surroundings can also be used in [[geography]] (when it is more precisely known as vicinity, or vicinage) and mathematics, as well as philosophy, with the literal or metaphorically extended definition.

In [[thermodynamics]], the term (and its synonym, [[environment (systems)|environment]]) is used in a more restricted sense, meaning everything outside the [[System (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic system]]. Often, the simplifying assumptions are that [[energy]] and [[matter]] may move freely within the surroundings, and that the surroundings have a uniform composition.

'''''This Is Modern Art''''' was a six-part TV series written and presented by the English art critic [[Matthew Collings]].  It was broadcast in 1999 on Channel 4.

The series won several awards including a [[BAFTA]].  It became popular both because of its sometimes jokey and sometimes thoughtful explanations of the work and attitude of a new wave of artists that had recently been publicized in the British mass media, and because of its author's witty and irreverent, though clearly highly informed, commentary style.  Collings went on to create several more TV series and programmes for Channel 4, including ''[[Impressionism Revenge of The Nice]]'', ''[[Self Portraits The Me Generations]]'' and [[This Is Civilisation]].

In [[social science]] [[research]], typical units of analysis include individuals (most common), [[group (sociology)|groups]], [[social organization]]s and [[social artifact]]s.

The literature of [[international relations]] provides a good example of units of analysis. In "Man, the State and War", [[Kenneth N. Waltz]] creates a tripartite analysis with three different units of analysis: the man (individual), the state (a group), and the international system (the system in which groups interact).

This is not to be confused with the [[unit of observation]], which is the unit described by one's data (neighborhoods using the [[U.S. Census]], individuals using surveys, etc.). For example, a study may have a unit of observation at the individual level but may have the unit of analysis at the neighborhood level, drawing conclusions on neighborhood characteristics from data collected from individuals.

An '''urban stream''' is a formerly natural [[River|waterway]] that flows through a [[Urban area|heavily populated area]].  Urban streams are often [[Water pollution|polluted]] by [[urban runoff]] and [[combined sewer]] outflows.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Christopher J. et al.(2005).[http://www.biology.duke.edu/wilson/EcoSysServices/papers/WalshEtal2005.pdf "The urban stream syndrome: current knowledge and the search for a cure."] ''Journal of the North American Benthological Society,'' 2005, 24(3):706–723. {{DOI|10.1899/04-028.1}}, {{ISSN|0887-3593}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water scarcity]] makes flow management in the rehabilitation of urban streams problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lawrence, J.E., C.P.W. Pavia, S. Kaing, H.N. Bischel, R.G. Luthy, and V.H. Resh |title= Recycled Water for Augmenting Urban Streams in Mediterranean-climate Regions: A Potential Approach for Riparian Ecosystem Enhancement |journal=Hydrological Sciences Journal |year=2014 |volume=59|pages= 488–501 |doi=10.1080/02626667.2013.818221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments may alter the flow or course of an urban stream to prevent localized [[flood|flooding]] by [[river engineering]]: lining [[stream bed]]s with [[concrete]] or other [[hardscape]] materials, diverting the stream into [[culvert]]s and [[storm sewer]]s, or other means. Some urban streams, such as the [[subterranean rivers of London]], run completely underground. These modifications have often reduced habitat for [[fish]] and other species, caused downstream flooding due to alterations of [[flood plain]]s, and worsened [[water quality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=July 2007 |title=National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Hydromodification |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/hydromodification-and-habitat-alteration-national-management-measures |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC |id=EPA 841-B-07-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hobart Rivulet Underground.jpg|thumb|right|Some urban streams, such as the [[Hobart Rivulet]] in [[Tasmania]], run [[Subterranean river|underground]] for substantial distances]]
Some communities have begun [[stream restoration]] projects in an attempt to correct the problems caused by alteration, using techniques such as [[daylighting (streams)|daylighting]] and fixing stream bank [[Erosion#Water|erosion]] caused by heavy [[stormwater]] runoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=California Department of Water Resources|title=Urban Streams Restoration Program |url=http://www.watershedrestoration.water.ca.gov/urbanstreams/ |accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Andrew C. |last= Revkin |authorlink= |title= Rolling Back Pavement to Expose Watery Havens |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/world/asia/17daylight.html?_r=1 |format= |work= [[New York Times]] |publisher= |location= |date=16 July 2009|accessdate=19 July 2009 |quote= }}

'''The Wexner Graduate Fellowship Program''' supports [[Postgraduate education|graduate student]]s planning a career related to [[Judaism]].   The program selects 20 students preparing for careers in the [[Rabbi|rabbinate]], the cantorate, academic Jewish studies, and Jewish communal service.  Wexner Graduate Fellowships are given to students who are strongly committed to the Jewish community, have exceptional academic records, and show potential to become [[Leadership|leader]]s.  

Each fellow receives $20,000 a year for up to three years to finance their education. Fellows participate in annual institutes where leadership seminars enhance the skills of emerging Jewish professionals.  Graduate Fellowship Alumni continue meeting and building a network throughout their careers.

Applicants for Wexner Graduate Fellowships represent an [[Elite|elite group]] within the [[American Jews|American Jewish community]].  They are the most accomplished candidates for professional Jewish leadership training in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.policyarchive.org/bitstream/handle/10207/10368/RoadToLeadership.pdf?sequence=1 "The Road To Jewish Leadership" by Jonathan D.
