Burghound.com also organizes wine events such as the Asia Symphony of Wine and Flavours - Burghound in Asia, which is held in [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.yoursingapore.com/content/traveller/en/browse/apps/eventdetails.856.html |title=YourSingapore.com - Asia Symphony of Wine and Flavours – Burghound in Asia |access-date=2011-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225001046/http://www.yoursingapore.com/content/traveller/en/browse/apps/eventdetails.856.html |archive-date=2011-02-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a relatively short time following its launch, and despite a relatively high cost of subscription, the service came to be viewed by many as "the definitive word on matters Burgundian",&lt;ref name=nys&gt;{{cite web|last= Kramer |first= Matt, ''New York Sun'' |title= Wine for Right Now |url= http://www.nysun.com/food-drink/wine-for-right-now/46039/ |date= January 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Meadows "a leading Burgundy critic".&lt;ref name=eanytp&gt;{{cite web|last= Asimov |first= Eric, ''The New York Times'': The Pour |title= Ancient Messages, Hidden in a Dusty Bottle From Long Ago |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/dining/03pour.html |date= January 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the reasons cited for the success of Burghound.com are that Meadows already held a strong online discussion-group reputation, and that [[Robert M. Parker, Jr.|Robert Parker]] had ceased to cover Burgundy for ''[[The Wine Advocate]]'' in 1996, and delegated coverage of the region to Pierre Rovani with limited success, providing an opening for Meadows.&lt;ref name=wofw-ws&gt;{{cite web|last=Steinberger |first=Mike, ''The World of Fine Wine'' |title=Everyone a Critic.

In 2010, Meadows and his wife Erica released a book by way of self-publishing, titled ''The Pearl of the Côte'' on the subject of the history and vineyards of [[Vosne-Romanée wine|Vosne-Romanée]], while opting not to list the book on channels such as [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Jancis, ''Financial Times'' (July 23, 2010).

'''Biko Agozino''' (born 27 July 1961) is a [[Nigerian people|Nigerian]] criminologist best known for his 1997 book ''Black Women and the Criminal Justice System''.&lt;ref name=basicbio/&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Agozino was born on 27 July 1961 in [[Awgu]], Enugu State, Nigeria. He attended the [[University of Calabar]] where he gained a BSc in Sociology, the [[University of Cambridge]] where he gained a Master of Philosophy in Criminology, and the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he earned a PhD in Criminology.&lt;ref name=basicbio/&gt;

== Career ==
Agozino has been editor of the ''Interdisciplinary Research Series in Ethnic, Gender and Class Relations'' series of books from [[Ashgate Publishing]]. His 1997 ''Black Women and the Criminal Justice System: Towards the Decolonisation of Victimisation'' was the first of these. By 2008 over two dozen books had been published in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He was appointed editor-in-chief of the ''[[African Journal of Criminology and Justice Studies]]'' and a member of the [[editorial board]] of ''Jenda: A Journal of West African Women's Studies and Culture''.&lt;ref name=basicbio/&gt;
Agozino is a founding member of the international governing council of the [[Lagos]]-based think tank the ''[[Centre for Democracy and Development]]''.&lt;ref name=basicbio/&gt; In 2007, Agozino was appointed criminology unit coordinator and professor in sociology at the [[University of the West Indies]], St Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;ref name=Cain2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Work==
Agozino's work explores the past and present impact of colonisation on the way in which racial and ethnic minorities are treated by justice systems worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |author=[[Shaun L. Gabbidon]]
 |publisher=SAGE |year=2009

His work develops a postcolonial perspective in African criminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |title=What Is Criminology?
 |author=[[Mary Bosworth]], Carolyn Hoyle
 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=2011
 |ISBN=0-19-957182-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Agozino challenges the criminology discipline to "decolonize" its theories and methods and to undo the harm that has been done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |author=Martin O'Brien, Majid Yar
 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2008
 |ISBN=0-415-42794-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his introduction to Gabbidon's 2007 ''W.E.B. Du Bois on crime and justice'', Agozino notes that "excessive punitiveness" in the criminal justice systems of the US, UK, South Africa and Russia has been increasing rather than reducing the problem of crime. He also noted the hypocrisy of British and American leaders in calling [[Nelson Mandela]] a terrorist as he was struggling with the terrorist [[apartheid]] regime in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |author=Shaun L. Gabbidon
 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2007

His work is theoretical in nature, discussing the development of criminology in western countries and their impact on non-western societies, particularly former colonies. It has rejuvenated the colonial perspective on race and crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2010
 |ISBN=0-415-87424-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1997 ''Black women and the criminal justice system'' Agozino notes the roles of race and ethnicity in negotiation of power within prison, where coloured people are greatly under-represented among prison officers and over-represented among inmates. He does not discuss the importance, at least in England, of the factors of class and geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |author=Barbara H. Zaitzow, Jim Thomas
 |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |year=2003
 |ISBN=1-58826-228-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His book also discusses fixed political positions on types of crime. He notes that when US Surgeon General [[Jocelyn Elders]] said the government should seriously look into the experience of countries that had decriminalised drug addiction she was dismissed from her job by President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A review of Agozino's 2003 book ''Counter-Colonial Criminology: A Critique of Imperialist Reason'' concluded: ".., this is a book that deserves to be on all criminological reading lists, and it would be at home in any African centred studies course. It offers a generous amount of scholarly inquiry into an area that has paid scant attention to African and other “people of color’s” perspectives in the criminological discourse. It is therefore groundbreaking and a must read".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Another review of this book talked about the "complexity and creativity of this angry yet optimistic work".&lt;ref name=Cain2007/&gt;

[[Image:Mokrani.jpg|thumb|Cheikh Mokrani]]
[[Sheikh]] '''Mohamed El- Mokrani''' ({{lang-ar|الشيخ محمد المقراني}}{{ltr}}; 1815–1871) was one of the principal leaders of the popular uprising at the end of 19th century following the French conquest in [[Bordj Bou Arréridj|Bordj Bou Arreridj, Algeria]] in 1830.

== Reasons for Revolt ==

The revolt was triggered by extension of civil colonization authority to previously self-governing tribal [[Berber people|Berber]] confederation and the abrogation of commitments made by the military government, but it clearly had its basis in more long-standing grievances. Since the [[Crimean War]] (1854–56), the demand for grain had pushed up the price of Algerian wheat to European levels. Storage silos were emptied when the world market's impact was felt in Algeria, and Muslim farmers sold their grain reserves — including seed grain — to French speculators. When serious drought struck [[Algeria]] and grain crops failed in 1866 and for several years following, Muslim areas faced starvation, and with famine also  came [[infectious disease|pestilence]]. It was estimated that 20% of the Muslim population of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] died over a three-year period. In 1871 the civil authorities repudiated guarantees made to tribal chieftains by the previous military government for loans to replenish their seed supply. This act alienated even pro-French Muslim leaders, while it undercut their ability to control their people. It was against this background of misery and hopelessness that the stricken [[Kabyles]] rose in revolt.

== Revolt of Cheikh Mokrani ==
{{main|Mokrani Revolt}}
Mohand at-AMokrane was the son of Ahmed AMokrane one of the governors (Bachagha) of the area of [[Medjana]] located in the highlands of [[Kabylie]], who was also the cheikh of [[Rahmania]]  order. After the death of Ahmed -AMokrane, the French authorities appointed Mohand in his place.  However following dissension with the French administration, he resigned from his position in March 1871. This conflict happened as a result of the colonial authorities disregarding  at-aMokrane, creating a French-populated commune of Bordj Bou Arréridj and appointing a French officer as its head. The great many discontented flocked to the banners of the Cheikh aggrieved by the ravages of famine, increasing racial oppression by the French and Christianization policy pursued by the [[Catholic]] church.

In March 1871  Mohamed El-Mokrani revolted against French by carrying out his army until Bordj- Bou -Arréridj with the assistance of his brother [[oumezrag]] and his cousin El Hadj Bouzid, and Sheikh mohand ameziane AHaddad of saddouk oufella great schollar theoligien of the zaouia tarahmanit which joined this uprising with his tribe. Using his position and influence on Rahmania brotherhood sheikh mohand-aMokrane was able to overcome the dissension in his camp and retake Bordj-Bou-Arreridj.

The members of the brotherhood Rahamania, disciples of the Sheik Ahaddad(El Haddad) played an eminent part in success of the insurrection of El Mokrani(amokrane), in particular after Sheikh Ahaddad(El Haddad) had proclaimed the [[war]] against the French on April 8, 1871. The insurrection  acquired a total character through the increase in the number of combatants who rejoined it and his extension to the west, north and the East where considerable stations of the colonial army were encircled in several areas.

After having carried several battles  Mohand Amokrane(Mohamed El-Mokrani) was martyred on May 5, 1871 at Taouraga. His tomb is located  in kollaa n'at-Abbas (Bgayet)([[Béjaïa]]). Under the command of his brother Oumzrag (Boumezreg), the uprising continued until January 20, 1872, date of his arrest and deportation to New Caledonia, an island in the Pacific.

== Consequences of the Revolt ==

After the arrest of Sheik-el-Haddad, the jihad continued under [[Bouamama]]. There were also other small insurrectionary movements at Blessed-Menaceur, which forces besieged Cherchel, Zurich, Vesoul-Benian and Hammam-Rirha; this movement was also crushed. From July to September 1872, French forces had still to completely subdued [[Kabylie]]. Bou-Mezrag took refuge at Maadid, and later managed to escape the French  finding allies among the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] tribes of the South. The general Delacroix, with a small expeditionary force, continued to pursue the rebels until beyond Ouargla. BouMezrag Mokrani, which had remained six days without drinking nor to eat, was finally captured removed.

The insurrection, which had begun on March 16, 1871 in Medjana was  finished on January 20, 1872 by the arrest of Bou-Mezrag. Although a third only of Algeria had taken part in the movement, there had been about 200.000 combatants under the rebel flag.

Exile of the brother of El-Mokrani and the whole family to the [[New Caledonia]] occurred shortly afterwards. Together with them 212 persons, called [[Kabyles du Pacifique]], who  participated in the revolt were tried and deported by French authorities to labor camps on the island of New Caledonia.  Mokrani's descendants still live on the island.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21069">[[File:Constancedrexel.djvu|thumb|250px|right|Constance Drexel (1925)]]
'''Constance Drexel''' (ca. November 24, 1884 or ca. November 28, 1894 (possible; disputed) &amp;ndash; August 28, 1956), a naturalized [[United States citizen]],&lt;ref name=calling&gt;John Carver Edwards, ''Berlin Calling: American Broadcasters in Service to the Third Reich'', Praeger Publishers (1991), pp. 15-16; {{ISBN|0-275-93905-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and groundbreaking feature writer for U.S. newspapers,&lt;ref name=sally&gt;M. Williams Fuller, ''Axis Sally'', Paradise West Publishing, pg. 168; {{ISBN|0-9723675-7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; was indicted (but not tried or convicted) for [[treason]] in [[World War II]] for radio broadcasts from [[Berlin]] that extolled [[Nazi]] virtues.&lt;ref name=indict&gt;Associated Press, "8 Indicted on Charges of Treason", ''Moberly Monitor-Index'', July 26, 1943, at page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

She became famous falsely claiming to be an heiress of the famous Drexel family of [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=oakland&gt;"Society by Suzette", ''Oakland Tribune'', August 8, 1915, at page 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ohio&gt;Editorial, Hamilton (OH) Evening Journal, 1916-10-18 at 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=coffee&gt;Constance Drexel, “United States Spikes Imports of Brazilian Coffee into Germany &amp;mdash; Economic Pressure Makes Large Part of Fatherland Population Quit Beverage,” Oakland Tribune, 1939-07-16 at B-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hawhaw&gt;Madelin Blitzstein, “Berlin’s Lady Haw Haw Philadelphia’s Who Who?” Brownsville Herald, 1940-08-24, at 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Arrested in [[Vienna]] and jailed at war’s end by American troops,&lt;ref name=arrest&gt;“Constance Drexel Held as 'Traitor'”, ''The Port Arthur News'', August 17, 1945; page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; she was released and allowed to return to the United States to live.&lt;ref name=freed&gt;“Constance Drexel Freed; Citizenship Held Not Forefeited,” Wisconsin State Journal, October 3, 1946; page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Department of Justice]] eventually dismissed the treason charges against her because her broadcasts were not deemed “political in nature.”&lt;ref name=dismiss&gt;“US Dismisses Charges Against Miss Drexel”, ''Council Bluffs Nonpareil'', April 14, 1948; page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and childhood==
Public references to Drexel's nation of origin and pedigree were contrary to privately recorded facts.  As early as 1915 (in American press reports) and as late as the 1940s (in Nazi broadcasts), she was described as a member of the "famous Drexel family" of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], an apparent reference to the descendants of [[Francis Martin Drexel]] (who founded the Drexel &amp; Company banking empire), including his son [[Anthony Joseph Drexel]] (who founded [[Drexel University]] in Philadelphia) and his granddaughter [[Saint Katharine Drexel]].

Yet by all accounts, including the one provided by Constance Drexel to the [[Bureau of Investigation]] in 1918,&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;Interview reports of Agent J.F. McDevitt regarding “Constance Drexel, application for passport” June 21, 1918, available at footnote.com; accessed August 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; she was born in [[Germany]], apparently in the 1880s, many decades after Francis Drexel emigrated from Europe to Philadelphia in 1817. After she began broadcasting from Nazi Germany during wartime, at least one American syndicated columnist speculated that “Drexel” was a [[pseudonym]].&lt;ref&gt;Baukhage, "Washington Digest: Imperial Hopes may Linger but Where will Nazis Flee?", ''Rock Valley (IA) Bee'', September 19, 1944; page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Published information regarding her age and date of birth is also wildly inconsistent.&lt;ref name=calling/&gt;&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt; Historian John Carver Edwards has concluded Drexel was born in [[Darmstadt, Germany]] on November 28, 1894, to Theodore Drexel, scion of a wealthy family in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, and Zelda Audemar Drexel, daughter of a prominent Swiss watch manufacturer, and was brought to the United States by her father the following year.&lt;ref name=calling/&gt;

However, all five of the ship manifests in Ellis Island records documenting her re-entry into the Port of New York between 1905 and 1923 give an age commensurate with birth in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellisisland.org/search/matchMore.asp?MID=04146261940936556416&amp;FNM=CONSTANCE&amp;LNM=DREXEL&amp;PLNM=DREXEL&amp;first_kind=1&amp;kind=exact&amp;offset=0&amp;dwpdone=1 Ellis Island Passenger Ship Database, search results for Constance Drexel]; accessed March 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A U.S. Department of Justice internal memorandum prepared in 1946 described her birth date as November 24, 1884.&lt;ref name=fbimemo&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/criminal/foia/records/ezra-pound-p4.pdf Office Memorandum from Nathan T. Elliff to Assistant Attorney General Theron L. Caudle re: Treason Cases], June 14, 1946; accessed October 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drexel became a [[United States citizen]] upon her father’s naturalization in 1899.&lt;ref name=calling/&gt;&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt; She reported to the FBI in 1918 that she had a sister named Norma Georgia Drexel, then living in Switzerland.&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt;  Constance grew up not in Philadelphia, but in [[Roslindale, Massachusetts]], where she attended public schools. "As an adolescent she divided her time between the United States and Europe, attending school in four different countries and honing her skills as a writer", completing her education at the [[Sorbonne]] in [[Paris, France]].&lt;ref name=calling/&gt;

==World War I==
Miss Drexel first received national publicity in early 1915, when American newspapers began to report that “Philadelphia Heiress” Constance Drexel had volunteered briefly as a [[Red Cross]] nurse near the front lines in France in the early months of World War I, and reported on her experiences.&lt;ref name=heiress&gt;"Heiress Helps Cause", ''The Washington Post'', January 30, 1915, at page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia Evening Public Ledger'', February 8, 1915, at page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045211/1915-02-08/ed-1/seq-16 Portrait of Constance Drexel], chroniclingamerica.loc.gov, ''Philadelphia Evening Public Ledger'', February 8, 1915; accessed January 29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

She became active nationally and internationally in the International Woman's Congress, which met at [[The Hague]] in the neutral [[Netherlands]], in April 1915.  When she agreed to write dispatches regarding the Congress for American newspapers to publish, her career as a professional journalist began.&lt;ref name=calling/&gt;

She soon joined the staff of the ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia Public Ledger]]''. When her stories expanded to include not just her experiences but also her opinions, reactions were mixed. In one such article, she wrote "[one] must realize that an increase in horrors hastens the end of the war; so in the long run it's the most humane thing to have no relief funds or nurses. That's why I left the Red Cross".&lt;ref&gt;"Red Cross Nurses Prolong the War: So Declares a Girl who is Tired of Her Job", ''The Fort Wayne News'', September 14, 1915; page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Chicago Herald-Examiner|Chicago Herald]]'' editorial entitled “Horrible Logic” observed that her statement went far to confirm “that, when once moved to cruelty, women are infinitely more cruel than men.”&lt;ref name=chicago&gt;Editorial in the Chicago Herald entitled “Horrible Logic”, reprinted in the ''Newark Advocate'', September 18, 1915, at page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In another column, she opined that "perhaps the greatest curse of war" was "the effect of the loss of men on women and on the race". She explained that the most "harrowing sight in all of war-ridden Europe today" was "the spectacle of the young girls who must always live unmated, robbed of their birthright".&lt;ref name=oakland/&gt; "Her writings suggested an enthusiasm for Germany's preparedness campaign, and especially women's role in that effort", according to Edwards.&lt;ref name=calling/&gt; She became involved in the women's [[suffrage]] movement,&lt;ref name=heiress/&gt; and, in 1916, as a campaigner for the re-election of [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref name=ohio/&gt;

After the United States declared war on the [[German Empire]], she attempted to return to Europe with the announced purpose of visiting her ailing sister in [[Switzerland]], but a complaint from a colleague at the ''Public Ledger'' who alleged she had made pro-German comments led to a federal investigation.&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt; Her editors attested to her loyalty, but in part because of her German birth and her pacifism, the investigating agent concluded that she should not be permitted to use her passport.&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt;

==Covering the Paris Conference, Congress and the League of Nations==
She returned to Europe soon after the end of the war, first to cover the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] and then to cover and participate in the conference of the International Conference of Women and [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] (which succeeded in obtaining a woman’s equality clause in the Covenant of the [[League of Nations]]).&lt;ref name=calling/&gt;

Returning to the United States, she covered the suffrage campaign, and when women won the right to vote, she became one of [[Capitol Hill]]'s few women political correspondents.&lt;ref name=calling/&gt;&lt;ref name=sally/&gt;

Her readership peaked in the 1920s, when her columns on the status of women around the world, and interviews with world leaders, were published in many newspapers, including not only the ''Public Ledger'' but also the ''Chicago Tribune'', ''The New York Times'',&lt;ref&gt;Constance Drexel, [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1924/06/01/101600498.pdf "Women to be a Force at Party Conventions"], ''The New York Times'', June 1, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1924/07/27/101606523.pdf "Parliament Gives Heed Now to its Women Members"], ''The New York Times'', July 27, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1925/01/04/101630455.pdf Woman's Status Highest in America"], ''The New York Times'', January 4, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; and members of the McClure Syndicate.&lt;ref name=calling/&gt;

==Interest in Nazi Germany==
By the early 1930s she achieved a “growing stature among the press corps and certain political circles,” on issues such as international [[arms control]] and world peace.&lt;ref name=calling/&gt;

Ironically, her interest in those issues did not prevent her from becoming enamored with the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi]] movement in Germany. 
Edwards concluded that she liked Hitler because she was impressed by his support for other aspects of her “reform agenda,″ including a greater role for women, the eradication of a parasitic social elite, welfare legislation for minors, and [[eugenics|social hygiene regulatory laws]].&lt;ref name=calling/&gt; "Drexel eagerly anticipated visits to the new Reich, and on several of these working holidays the Propaganda Ministry awarded her writing assignments."&lt;ref name=calling/&gt;

In 1938, she became employed in Philadelphia in the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) [[Federal Writers' Project]] and, later, as an instructor of French on the WPA Education Project, when her writing made at least one journalist question whether she had already become a Nazi propagandist.&lt;ref name=calling/&gt;

==Berlin-based correspondent==
Drexel returned to Germany in 1939, officially to care for her ailing mother in [[Wiesbaden, Germany]], but travelling at the expense of the German government.&lt;ref name=calling/&gt; In the months leading to Hitler’s invasion of [[Poland]] in September 1939, Drexel wrote feature stories for American newspapers that were ostensibly about the home life of ordinary Germans, but that consistently reflected positively on the Nazi regime and negatively on its future adversaries.&lt;ref name=coffee/&gt;&lt;ref name=onions&gt;Constance Drexel, "German Government Diverts Onions to Munitions Channels", ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'', July 30, 1939, at page 9-B.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, six weeks before the outbreak of war, she wrote in the ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'' that the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] had prevented the Viennese population from starving; even though this was "[r]endered more difficult by the [[United States]] sudden boycott of manufactured goods from the annexed territories ... now that the peculiar genius of the North Germans for organization and efficient administration is in full play under the new regime, this and other problems with which they are harassed are being overcome."&lt;ref name=onions/&gt;

For a few months after World War II began, she wrote more feature articles about life in Germany that appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Constance Drexel, "Women in Three Lands at War: the Home Fronts in Britain, France, and Germany", ''The New York Times'', October 8, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Many Changes Made by War in German Schools", ''The New York Times'', December 24, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

But by that stage of her career, her colleagues in the American press corps had little respect for the quality or integrity of her work. One American network hired her at the beginning of the war, but dropped her almost at once.&lt;ref name=shirerd&gt;William L. Shirer, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ExOVUEzmCo8C&amp;pg=PA529&amp;dq=constance+drexel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CLNUTNDFFsuVnAealrX8Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=constance%20drexel&amp;f=false Berlin Diary]'' (1941), Johns Hopkins University Press (pg 529); {{ISBN|0-8018-7056-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She had constantly pestered Berlin-based [[CBS radio]] correspondent [[William L. Shirer]] for a job, but as he later explained, he had considered her "the worst broadcaster I ever heard".&lt;ref name=shirer1&gt;William L. Shirer, "William L. Shirer Reviews – Parade of American Turncoats", ''Nebraska State Journal'', February 14, 1943, at page D5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, she began broadcasting on Nazi-controlled shortwave radio channels.&lt;ref name=calling/&gt; She was introduced to listeners as a “world-renowned journalist and a member of the famous Drexel family of Philadelphia.”&lt;ref&gt;William Wilson, "Six Americans Broadcasting for Axis to be Indicted for Treason", ''Lowell Sun'', January 13, 1943, at page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to M. Williams Fuller, "[s]ounding like a grand dame with a stuffy nose, she described Germany as a cornucopia – a land of plenty destined for a glorious future. Her broadcasts concluded with titillating accounts of Germany's art exhibits, concerts, food surplus, haute couture and world-class entertainment."&lt;ref name=sally/&gt; Shirer's September 26, 1940 entry in his "''[[Berlin Diary]]''" notes that "the Nazis hire her, as far as I can find out, principally because she's the only woman in town who will sell her American accent to them."&lt;ref name=shirerd/&gt;

When applying (through Swiss authorities) for an extension of her U.S. passport in November 1942, she stated that "[i]n speaking for the German radio, I am following my own ideas; I am not [a] speaker about political or military matters but reporting cultural activities such as activities in the theatre, music and the film."&lt;ref name=fbimemo/&gt;

Drexel soon fell from grace among her new colleagues, and top Nazis began avoiding her.&lt;ref name=spy&gt;[[William B. Breuer]], '''The Air Raid Warden was a Spy and other tales from Home-Front America in World War II'' pg. 133, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (2003); {{ISBN|0-471-23488-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long after the war, it was reported that she had committed a faux pas while attending a reception for Nazi Party leaders. "On being introduced to a beautiful young German woman, Drexel blurted: 'oh, you are the girlfriend of Adolf Hitler!'"&lt;ref name=spy/&gt; 
As Propaganda Ministry official Inge Doman later testified in the treason trial of [[Mildred Gillars]], known as "[[Axis Sally]]", Doman warned Gillars "to keep your distance from that Drexel woman. She's a pest and a crackpot."&lt;ref name=sally/&gt;

==Indictment, arrest, and release==
On October 1, 1942, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sent a memo to [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Francis Biddle]] that stated in part, ''"There are a number of Americans in Europe who are aiding Hitler et al on the radio. Why should we not proceed to indict them for treason even though we might not be able to try them until after the war?"''&lt;ref name=whmemo&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/criminal/foia/records/ezra-pound-p1.pdf October 1, 1942, Memo from the White House (signed F.D.R.) to the Office of the Attorney General]; accessed October 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Federal Bureau of Investigation review of excerpts of such broadcasts stated that Drexel was attempting to show that the war had not lowered the morale of the German people in an effort to discourage the American people from continuing with the war effort.&lt;ref name=whmemo/&gt; In July 1943, the [[United States Department of Justice]] filed treason charges against Drexel and seven other United States citizens who had been broadcasting from Axis-controlled radio stations.&lt;ref name=indict/&gt;

On August 17, 1945, over three months after the war in Europe had ended, she was arrested in Vienna by American forces after she revealed her identity to a [[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]] reporter on a walk behind the Vienna City Hall.&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt;&lt;ref name=downey&gt;"Capt. Downey of Pittsfield Arrests Two Americans Indicted for Treason", ''Berkshire Evening Eagle'', August 21, 1945, at page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wearing an American flag lapel pin, she claimed she had always been a loyal citizen, and had only broadcast on cultural questions.&lt;ref name=downey/&gt; At the time of her arrest, her age was listed as 60 (in one newspaper)&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt; and almost 70 (in another).&lt;ref name=downey/&gt;

Drexel was detained for over a year before she was transferred to [[Ellis Island]] in [[New York Harbor]], pending an October 1946 hearing by a board of inquiry of the [[U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service]], on her eligibility to re-enter the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Drexel Held at Ellis As Treasonist", ''Berkshire Evening Eagle'', October 1, 1946, at page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 3, 1946, the board decided that she had not forfeited her citizenship, and allowed her to re-enter the country.&lt;ref name=freed/&gt;

At the time of her release and re-entry, the United States Department of Justice said that her prosecution on the treason charges was no longer contemplated because lawyers who went to Germany to seek further evidence against her failed to uncover any.&lt;ref name=freed/&gt; An internal Department of Justice memorandum dated June 14, 1946, repeats information from the [[Office of Strategic Services]] that she "was stranded in Germany and since she needed money she found a job with the American Propaganda Section of the Reichrundfunk" but that her twice-weekly broadcasts dealt "mainly with women, children, and the beauties of the German landscape."&lt;ref name=fbimemo/&gt; The memo recommended taking no further action against her.&lt;ref name=fbimemo/&gt;

[[Walter Winchell]] and others were still urging prosecution and stiff sentences for the Berlin broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Winchell, "Case Histories of Nazi Stooges Who Played Judas to Uncle Sam", ''Syracuse Herald Journal'', November 12, 1947, at page 39.&lt;/ref&gt; When the charges were formally dropped on April 14, 1948, the investigators explained that none of Drexel's broadcasts was "political in nature".&lt;ref name=dismiss/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1948/04/14/96423582.pdf "Constance Drexel Freed of Charges"], ''The New York Times'', April 14, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Drexel died in [[Waterbury, Connecticut]], on August 28, 1956.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;“[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1956/08/29/91149178.pdf "Constance Drexel, Ex-newswoman, Dies; Broadcast for the Nazis During War"], ''The New York Times'', August 29, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; She collapsed at the home of a cousin before leaving on the first leg of a trip to Geneva, Switzerland, where she intended to move.&lt;ref name=obit2&gt;"Constance Drexel, 68; Broadcast for Nazis", ''Berkshire Eagle'', August 29, 1956, at page 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The obituaries listed her age as 68.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit2/&gt;

{{Expert needed|crime|date=November 2010}}
A '''gangster''' is a [[crime|criminal]] who is a member of a [[gang]]. Some gangs are considered to be part of [[organized crime]]. Gangsters are also called '''mobsters''', a term derived from ''[[mobbing|mob]]'' and the [[suffix]] ''[[wikt:-ster|-ster]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] (online edition)&lt;/ref&gt;
Gangs provide a level of organization and resources that support much larger and more complex criminal transactions than an individual criminal could achieve. Gangsters have been active for many years in countries around the world.

Some gangsters, such as [[Al Capone]] have become infamous. Gangsters are the subject of many novels and films, particularly from the period between 1920 and 1990.
==Etymology==
Some contemporary criminals refer to themselves as "gangsta" in reference to [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] [[African American Vernacular English|black American pronunciation]].

==Gangs==
[[File:Japan-Yakuza-Sanja Matsuri-01.jpg|thumb|[[Yakuza]], or Japanese mafia are not allowed to show their tattoos in public except during the [[Sanja Matsuri]] festival.]]

In today's usage, the term "[[gang]]" is generally used for a criminal organization, and the term "gangster" invariably describes a criminal.{{sfn|Taylor|2009}}
Much has been written on the subject of gangs, although there is no clear consensus about what constitutes a gang or what situations lead to gang formation and evolution.
There is agreement that the members of a gang have a sense of common identity and belonging, and this is typically reinforced through shared activities and through visual identifications such as special clothing, tattoos or rings.{{sfn|Kontos|Brotherton|Barrios|2003|pp=xiff}} Some preconceptions may be false. For example, the common view that illegal drug distribution in the United States is largely controlled by gangs has been questioned.{{sfn|Kontos|Brotherton|Barrios|2003|pp=42}}

A gang may be a relatively small group of people who cooperate in criminal acts, as with the [[Jesse James]] gang, which ended with the leader's death in 1882. But a gang may be a larger group with a formal organization that survives the death of its leader. The [[Chicago Outfit]] created by [[Al Capone]] outlasted its founder's imprisonment and death, and survived into the 21st century. Large and well structured gangs such as [[the Mafia]], [[drug cartel]]s, [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]]s or even [[outlaw motorcycle gang]]s can undertake complex transactions that would be far beyond the capability of one individual, and can provide services such as dispute arbitration and contract enforcement that parallel those of a legitimate government.{{sfn|Abadinsky|2009|p=1}}

The term "[[organized crime]]" is associated with gangs and gangsters, but is not synonymous. A small street gang that engages in sporadic low-level crime would not be seen as "organized". An organization that coordinates gangs in different countries involved in the international trade in drugs or prostitutes may not be considered a "gang".{{sfn|Lyman|Potter|2010|pp=213ff}}

Although gangs and gangsters have existed in many countries and at many times in the past, they have played more prominent roles during times of weakened social order or when governments have attempted to suppress access to goods or services for which there is a high demand.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[File:Sicilian mafia 1901 maxi trial.jpg|thumb|right|Sketch of the 1901 maxi trial of suspected mafiosi in Palermo. From the newspaper ''[[L'Ora]]'', May 1901]]
The [[Sicilian Mafia]], or ''Cosa Nostra'' is a [[criminal syndicate]] that emerged in the mid-nineteenth century in [[Sicily, Italy]]. It is a loose association of criminal groups that share common organizational structure and code of conduct. The origins lie in the upheaval of Sicily's transition out of [[feudalism]] in 1812 and its later [[annexation]] by mainland Italy in 1860. Under feudalism, the nobility owned most of the land and enforced law and order through their private armies. After 1812, the feudal barons steadily sold off or rented their lands to private citizens. [[Primogeniture]] was abolished, land could no longer be seized to settle debts, and one fifth of the land was to become private property of the peasants.{{sfn|Sardell|2009}}

Organized crime has existed in Russia since the days of [[Imperial Russia]] in the form of banditry and thievery. In the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period ''[[Thief in law|Vory v Zakone]]'' emerged, a class of criminals that had to abide by certain rules in the prison system. One such rule was that cooperation with the authorities of any kind was forbidden. During [[World War II]] some prisoners made a deal with the government to join the armed forces in return for a reduced sentence, but upon their return to prison they were [[The Bitch Wars|attacked and killed]] by inmates who remained loyal to the rules of the thieves.{{sfn|Shalamov|1998}} In 1988 the Soviet Union legalized private enterprise but did not provide regulations to ensure the security of market economy. Crude markets emerged, the most notorious being the Rizhsky market where prostitution rings were run next to the Rizhsky Railway Station in Moscow.{{sfn|The Rise and rise...}}

As the [[Soviet Union]] headed for collapse many former government workers turned to crime,  while others moved overseas. Former [[KGB]] agents and veterans of the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Afghan]] and [[First Chechen War|First]] and [[Second Chechen War]]s, now unemployed but with experience that could prove useful in crime, joined the increasing crime wave.{{sfn|The Rise and rise...}} At first, the Vory v Zakone played a key role in arbitrating the gang wars that erupted in the 1990s.{{sfn|Schwirtz|2008}} By the mid-1990s it was believed that "Don" [[Semion Mogilevich]] had become the "boss of all bosses" of most [[Russian Mafia]] syndicates in the world,  described by the British government as "one of the most dangerous men in the world".{{sfn|Glenny|2008|p=75}} More recently, criminals with stronger ties to big business and the government have displaced the Vory from some of their traditional niches, although the Vory are still strong in gambling and the retail trade.{{sfn|Schwirtz|2008}}

The [[Albanian Mafia]] is active in [[Albania]], the United States, and the [[European Union]] (EU) countries, participating in a diverse range of criminal enterprises including [[Illegal drug trade|drug]] and [[arms trafficking]].{{sfn|Stojarová|2007}}{{sfn|UltraGangsteret Shqiptar}} The people of the mountainous country of Albania have always had strong traditions of family and clan loyalty, in some ways similar to that of southern Italy. Ethnic Albanian gangs have grown rapidly since 1992 during the prolonged period of instability in the Balkans after the collapse of Yugoslavia. This coincided with large scale migration throughout Europe and to the United States and Canada. Although based in Albania, the gangs often handle international transactions such as trafficking in economic migrants, drugs and other contraband, and weapons.{{sfn|Abadinsky|2009|pp=154–155}} Other criminal organizations that emerged in the Balkans around this time are popularly called the [[Serbian Mafia]], [[Bosnian Mafia]], [[Bulgarian Mafia]] and so on.

===Asia===
[[File:Du Yuesheng2.jpg|thumb|[[Du Yuesheng]] (1888–1951), a Chinese gangster and important [[Kuomintang]] supporter who spent much of his life in Shanghai]]
In China, [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]]s trace their roots to resistance or rebel groups opposed to [[Manchu people|Manchu]] rule during the [[Qing dynasty]], which were given the triangle as their emblem.{{sfn|Ter Haar|2000|pp=18}}
The first record of a triad society, ''Heaven and Earth Gathering'', dates to the Lin Shuangwen uprising on Taiwan from 1786 to 1787.{{sfn|Ter Haar|2000|pp=19}}
The triads evolved into criminal societies. When the [[Chinese Communist Party]] came to power in 1949 in mainland China, law enforcement became stricter and tough governmental crackdown on criminal organizations forced the triads to migrate to [[Hong Kong]], then a British colony, and other cities around the world.
Triads today are highly organized, with departments responsible for functions such as accounting, recruiting, communications, training and welfare in addition to the operational arms. They engage in a variety of crimes including extortion, money laundering, smuggling, trafficking and prostitution.{{sfn|Mallory|2007|p=136ff}}

[[Yakuza]] are members of traditional [[organized crime]] syndicates in Japan. They are notorious for their strict codes of conduct and very organized nature. As of 2009 they had an estimated 80,900 members.{{sfn|Corkill|2011}}
Most modern yakuza derive from two classifications which emerged in the mid-[[Edo period]]: [[tekiya]], those who primarily peddled illicit, stolen or shoddy goods; and [[bakuto]], those who were involved in or participated in gambling.{{sfn|Kaplan|Dubro|2003|pp=18-21}}

===United States and Canada===
As American society and culture developed, new [[immigrant]]s were relocating to the United States. The first major gangs in 19th century [[New York City]] were the [[Ireland|Irish]] gangs such as the [[Whyos]] and the [[Dead Rabbits]].{{sfn| English|2006|p=13}}
These were followed by the Italian [[Five Points Gang]] and later a Jewish gang known as the [[Eastman Gang]].{{sfn|Iorizzo|2003|p=14}}{{sfn|Fried|1980|p=27}}
There were also "[[Know Nothing|Nativist]]" anti-immigration gangs such as the [[Bowery Boys]]. The [[American Mafia]] arose from offshoots of [[the Mafia]] that emerged in the United States during the late nineteenth century, following waves of emigration from Sicily. There were similar offshoots in Canada among [[Italian Canadians]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In the later 1869s many Chinese emigrated to the United States, escaping from insecurity and economic hardship at home, at first working on the west coast and later moving east.
The new immigrants formed Chinese Benevolent Associations.
In some cases these evolved into [[Tong (organization)|Tong]]s, or criminal organizations primarily involved in gambling.
Members of [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]]s who migrated to the United States often joined these tongs.
With a new wave of migration in the 1960s, street gangs began to flourish in major cities.
The tongs recruited these gangs to protect their extortion, gambling and narcotics operations.{{sfn|Tongs and Street Gangs}}

The terms "gangster" and "mobster" are mostly used in the United States to refer to members of criminal organizations associated with [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] or with an American offshoot of the [[Italian Mafia]] (such as the [[Chicago Outfit]], the [[Philadelphia Mafia]], or the [[Five Families]]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
In 1920, the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] of the United States Constitution banned the sale, manufacture, and transportation of alcohol for consumption. Many gangs sold alcohol illegally for tremendous profit, and used acute violence to stake turf and protect their interest. Often, police officers and politicians were paid off or extorted to ensure continued operation.{{sfn|Iorizzo|2003|pp=15ff}}

===Latin America===
[[File:Death of Pablo Escobar.jpg|thumb|300px|Members of Colonel Martinez's Search Bloc celebrate over [[Pablo Escobar]]'s body on December 2, 1993]]
Most cocaine is grown and processed in [[South America]], particularly in [[Colombia]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], and smuggled into the United States and Europe, the United States being the world's largest consumer of cocaine.{{sfn|Field Listing...}}
Colombia is the world's leading producer of [[cocaine]], and also produces heroin that is mostly destined for the US market.{{sfn|Colombia - Transnational...}}
The [[Medellín Cartel]] was an organized network of  drug suppliers and smugglers originating in the city of [[Medellín]], Colombia. The gang operated in Colombia, [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Central America]], the United States, as well as Canada and Europe throughout the 1970s and 1980s. It was founded and run by Ochoa Vázquez brothers with [[Pablo Escobar]].
By 1993, the Colombian government, helped by the US, had successfully dismantled the cartel by imprisoning or hunting and gunning down its members.{{sfn|Gugliotta|Leen|2011|p=1ff}}

Although Mexican drug cartels, or drug trafficking organizations, have existed for several decades, they have become more powerful since the demise of Colombia's [[Cali Cartel|Cali]] and Medellín cartels in the 1990s. Mexican drug cartels now dominate the wholesale [[War on Drugs|illicit drug market]] in the United States.{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=7}}
Sixty five percent of cocaine enters the United States through Mexico, and the vast majority of the rest enters through Florida. Cocaine shipments from [[South America]] transported through Mexico or [[Central America]] are generally moved over land or by air to staging sites in northern Mexico. The cocaine is then broken down into smaller loads for smuggling across the [[US-Mexico border|U.S.–Mexico border]].{{sfn|Jacobson|2005|p=40ff}}
Arrests of key gang leaders, particularly in the [[Tijuana Cartel|Tijuana]] and [[Gulf Cartel|Gulf]] cartels, have led to increasing [[Mexican Drug War|drug violence]] as gangs fight for control of the trafficking routes into the United States.{{sfn|High U.S. cocaine cost}}

Cocaine traffickers from Colombia, and recently Mexico, have also established a labyrinth of [[smuggling]] routes throughout the [[Caribbean]], the [[Bahama]] Island chain, and South [[Florida]]. They often hire traffickers from Mexico or the [[Dominican Republic]] to transport the drug. The traffickers use a variety of smuggling techniques to transfer their drug to U.S. markets. These include airdrops of 500–700&amp;nbsp;kg in the [[Bahama Islands]] or off the coast of [[Puerto Rico]], mid-ocean boat-to-boat transfers of 500–2,000&amp;nbsp;kg, and the commercial shipment of tonnes of cocaine through the port of [[Miami]].
Another route of cocaine traffic goes through Chile, this route is primarily used for cocaine produced in Bolivia since the nearest seaports lie in northern Chile. The arid Bolivia-Chile border is easily crossed by 4x4 vehicles that then head to the seaports of [[Iquique]] and [[Antofagasta]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Notorious individuals==

===Al Capone===

[[File:AlCaponemugshotCPD.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Mug shot]] of [[Al Capone]]. Although never convicted of [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]], Capone was convicted of income tax evasion by the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]].]]
[[Al Capone]] was one of the most influential gangsters during the period. Born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn in 1899 to immigrant parents, Capone was recruited by members of the [[Five Points Gang]] in the early 1920s. Capone’s childhood friend, [[Lucky Luciano]], was also originally a member of the Five Points Gang. Capone would rise to control a major portion of illicit activity such as [[gambling]], [[prostitution]], and [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] in [[Chicago]] during the early twentieth century.{{sfn|Iorizzo|2003|pp=23ff}}

===Frank Costello===
[[File:Frank Costello - Kefauver Committee.jpg|thumb|190px|American gangster [[Frank Costello]], testifying before the [[Kefauver Committee]], during an investigation of organized crime.]]
{{main|Frank Costello}}
[[Frank Costello]] was another influential gangster. He was born in southern Italy but moved to America when he was four years old. He later changed his name from Francesco Castiglia to Frank Costello when he joined a gang at age 13. His name change led some people to mistakenly believe he was Irish. He worked with [[Charlie Luciano]] in [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] and [[gambling]]. He also had a lot of political power which enabled him to continue his business. He took charge when Luciano was arrested and expanded the gang's operations. He decided to step away from the gangster life and died peacefully in 1973.{{Clear left}}

===Carlo Gambino===
{{Main|Carlo Gambino}}
[[Carlo Gambino]] was an influential gangster in America. From 1961 until he died in 1976, he was chairman of the [[Italian-American Mafia]].
Gambino was born in [[Palermo, Sicily]], but moved to the United States at the age of 21. Through his Castellano relatives, he joined the Masseria Family. While Lucky Luciano was the underboss in the Masseria Family, Gambino worked for him. After Luciano had Masseria killed, Luciano became the boss, and Gambino was sent to the Scalise Family. Later Scalise was stripped of his rank, and Vincenzo Mangano became boss until 1951, when Mangano disappeared. His body was never found.{{sfn|Block|2004|pp=85ff}}

===The Kray twins===
The [[Kray twins]], Reginald and Ronald Kray, were leading criminals in London, England in the 1950s and 1960s. They were involved in armed robberies, arson, protection rackets, violent assaults including torture and the murders of [[Jack McVitie|Jack "The Hat" McVitie]] and [[George Cornell]]. As West End nightclub owners, they mixed with prominent entertainers including [[Diana Dors]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Judy Garland]] and politicians. The Krays were highly feared within their social environment.
In the 1960s they became celebrities in their own right, being photographed by [[David Bailey (photographer)|David Bailey]] and interviewed on television. They were arrested in 1968 and both sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].{{sfn|Borrell|Cashinella|1975|pp=52ff}}

Born in southern Italy in 1882, Torrio immigrated to the United States with his mother after his father's death, which happened when he was three years old. Known as "The Fox" for his cunning, he helped the formation of the [[Chicago Outfit]] and he is credited for inspiring the birth of the [[National Crime Syndicate]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard Abadinsky, ''Organized Crime'', Cengage Learning, 2009, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; He was a big influence on Al Capone, who regarded him as a mentor.&lt;ref&gt;John Cobler, ''Capone: The Life and Times of Al Capone'', Da Capo Press, 2003, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; After the assassination of [[Big Jim Colosimo]], Torrio took his place in the Chicago Outfit. He was severely wounded by members of the [[North Side Gang]] while returning from a shopping trip, forcing him, along with other problems, to quit the criminal activity. He died in 1957 and the media learned about his death three weeks after his burial.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Robert Nash, ''The Great Pictorial History of World Crime, Volume 1'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2004, p.503&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elmer Irey]], official of the [[United States Treasury Department]], defined Torrio "the biggest gangster in America", "the smartest and the best of all the hoodlums"&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Folsom, ''The Money Trail'', Potomac Books, 2010, p.231&lt;/ref&gt; while Virgil W. Peterson of the [[Chicago Crime Commission]] considered him "an organizational genius".&lt;ref&gt;Virgil W. Peterson, ''The mob: 200 years of organized crime in New York'', Green Hill Publishers, 1983, p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{See|Gangster film}}
Gangs have long been the subject of movies. In fact, the first feature-length movie ever produced was ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (1906), an Australian production that traced the life of the outlaw [[Ned Kelly]] (1855–1880).{{sfn|Beeton|2005|p=62}} The United States has profoundly influenced the genre, but other cultures have contributed distinctive and often excellent gangster movies.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===United States===
The classic [[gangster movie]] ranks with the Western as one of the most successful creations of the American movie industry. The "classic" form of gangster movie, rarely produced in recent years, tells of a gangster working his way up through his enterprise and daring, until his organization collapses while he is at the peak of his powers. Although the ending is presented as a moral outcome, it is usually seen as no more than an accidental failure. The gangster is typically articulate, although at times lonely and depressed, and his worldly wisdom and defiance of social norms has a strong appeal, particularly to adolescents.{{sfn|Talbot|1975|p=148-149}}

[[File:Edward g robinson.jpg|thumb|Publicity still of Romanian-born [[Edward G. Robinson]], who starred in several American gangster movies]]
The stereotypical image and myth of the American gangster is closely associated with [[organized crime]] during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] era of the 1920s and 1930s.{{sfn|McCarty|2004|p=5}}

The years 1931 and 1932 saw the genre produce three classics: [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' and ''[[The Public Enemy]]'', which made screen icons out of [[Edward G. Robinson]] and [[James Cagney]], and [[Howard Hughs]]' ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' starring [[Paul Muni]], which offered a dark psychological analysis of a fictionalized [[Al Capone]].{{sfn|Hark|2007|p=12}} These films chronicle the quick rise, and equally quick downfall, of three young, violent criminals, and represent the genre in its purest form before moral pressure would force it to change and evolve. Though the gangster in each film would face a violent downfall which was designed to remind the viewers of the consequences of crime, audiences were often able to identify with the charismatic anti-hero. Those suffering from the Depression were able to relate to the gangster character who worked hard to earn his place and success in the world, only to have it all taken away from him.{{sfn|Hark|2007|p=13}}

===Latin America===
Latin American gangster movies are known for their gritty realism. ''[[Soy un delincuente]]'' (English: I Am a Criminal) is a 1976 [[Venezuela]]n film by director Clemente de la Cerda. The film tells the story of Ramón Antonio Brizuela, a real-life individual, who since childhood has to deal with rampant violence and the drugs, sex and petty thievery of a Caracas slum. Starting with delinquency, Ramón moves on to serious gang activity and robberies. He grows into a tough, self-confident young man who is hardened to violence. His views change when his fiancée's brother is killed in a robbery. The film was a blockbuster hit in Venezuela.{{sfn|Soy un Delincuente}}

''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'' ({{lang-pt|Cidade de Deus}}) is a 2002 [[Brazilian cinema|Brazilian]] [[Crime film|crime]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Fernando Meirelles]] and co-directed by [[Kátia Lund]], released in its home country in 2002 and worldwide in 2003. All the characters existed in reality, and the story is based on real events. It depicts the growth of organized crime in the [[Cidade de Deus (Rio de Janeiro)|Cidade de Deus]] suburb of [[Rio de Janeiro]], between the end of the '60s and the beginning of the '80s, with the closure of the film depicting the war between the drug dealer [[Zé Pequeno|Li'l Zé]] and criminal [[Knockout Ned (Mané Galinha)|Knockout Ned]].{{sfn|Ebert|2003}} The film received four [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations in 2004.{{sfn|City of God}}

===East Asia===
The first [[yakuza]] (gangster) film made in Japan was ''[[Bakuto]]'' (Gambler, 1964). The genre soon became popular, and by the 1970s the Japanese film industry was turning out a hundred mostly low-budget yakuza films each year. The films are descendants of the samurai epics, and are closer to Westerns than to Hollywood gangster movies. The hero is typically torn between compassion for the oppressed and his sense of duty to the gang. The plots are generally highly stylized, starting with the protagonist being released from prison and ending in a gory sword fight in which he dies an honorable death.{{sfn|Kaplan|Dubro|2003|pp=141-142}}

Although some Hong Kong gangster movies are simply vehicles for violent action, the mainstream movies in the genre deal with Triad societies portrayed as quasi-benign organizations.{{sfn|Nochimson|2007|p=70}} The movie gangster applies the Taoist principles of balance and honor to his conduct. The plots are often similar to those of Hollywood gangster movies, often ending with the fall of the subject of the movie at the hands of another gangster, but such a fall is far less important than a fall from honor.{{sfn|Nochimson|2007|p=70}} The first movie made by the acclaimed director [[Wong Kar-wai]] was a gangster movie, ''[[As Tears Go By (film)|As Tears Go By]]''. In it the protagonist finds himself torn between his desire for a woman and his loyalty to a fellow gangster.{{sfn|Nochimson|2011|p=306}} ''[[Infernal Affairs]]'' (2002) is a thriller about a police officer who infiltrates a triad and a triad member who infiltrates the police department. The film was remade by [[Martin Scorsese]] as ''[[The Departed]]''.{{sfn|Reiber|2011|p=31}}

Gangster films make up one of the most profitable segments of the South Korean film industry. Films made in the 1960s were often influenced by Japanese [[yakuza]] films, dealing with internal conflict between members of a gang or external conflict with other gangs. The gangsters' code of conduct and loyalty are important elements. Starting in the 1970s, strict censorship caused decline in the number and quality of gangster movies, and none were made in the 1980s.{{sfn|Choi|2010|p=60}} In the late 1980s and early 1990s there was a surge of imports of action movies from [[Hong Kong]]. The first of the new wave of important home grown gangster movies was [[Im Kwon-taek]]'s ''[[General's Son]]'' (1990). Although this movie followed the earlier tradition, it was followed by a series of sophisticated gangster noirs set in contemporary urban locations, such as ''[[A Bittersweet Life]]'' (2005).{{sfn|Choi|2010|p=61}}

{{Jesus|expanded=background}}[[File:St Denis transept south.jpg|thumb|270px|Rose window in [[Basilica of St Denis]], France, depicting the ancestors of Jesus from Jesse onwards]]

The [[New Testament]] provides two accounts of the '''genealogy of Jesus''', one in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and another in the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|1:1–16}}; {{bibleref2|Luke|3:23–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew starts with [[Abraham]], while Luke begins with [[Adam]]. The lists are identical between Abraham and [[David]], but differ radically from that point. Matthew has twenty-seven generations from David to [[Joseph]], whereas Luke has forty-two, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists.⁠ Notably, the two accounts also disagree on who Joseph's father was: Matthew says he was Jacob, while Luke says he was Heli.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Matthew|1:16}}; {{bibleverse|Luke|3:23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Christian scholars (starting with the historian [[Eusebius]]&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius Pamphilius, ''Church history, Life of Constantine'' §VII.&lt;/ref&gt;) have put forward various theories that seek to explain why the lineages are so different,&lt;ref&gt;R. T. France, ''The Gospel According to Matthew: An Introduction and Commentary'' (Eerdmans, 1985) page 71-72.&lt;/ref&gt; such as that Matthew's account follows the lineage of Joseph, while Luke's follows the lineage of Mary. Some modern critical scholars like [[Marcus Borg]] and [[John Dominic Crossan]] claim both genealogies as inventions, to bring the Messianic claims into conformity with Jewish criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus J. Borg, John Dominic Crossan, The First Christmas (HarperCollins, 2009) page 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Matthew's genealogy==
[[File:Genealogy of Jesus mosaic at Chora (1).jpg|thumb|South dome of inner narthex at [[Chora Church]], Istanbul, depicting the ancestors of Christ from Adam onwards]]
[[File:JesseTree.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Patrilineage in Matthew was traditionally illustrated by a [[Tree of Jesse]] showing the descent of Jesus from [[Jesse]], father of King [[David]]]]

Matthew 1:1–17 begins the Gospel, "A record of the origin of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac…" and continues on until "…and Jacob begot Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the [[Babylonian captivity|exile to Babylon]], and fourteen from the exile to the Christ."

Matthew emphasizes, right from the beginning, Jesus' title ''[[Christ (title)|Christ]]''—the Greek rendering of the Hebrew title ''[[Messiah]]''—meaning ''anointed'', in the sense of an anointed king. Jesus is presented as the long-awaited Messiah, who was expected to be a descendant of King David. Matthew begins by calling Jesus ''the son of David'', indicating his royal origin, and also ''son of Abraham'', indicating that he was an Israelite; both are stock phrases, in which ''son'' means ''descendant'', calling to mind the promises God made to David and to Abraham.&lt;ref name="nolland"&gt;{{citation |last=Nolland |first=John |year=2005 |title=The Gospel of Matthew: a commentary on the Greek text |pages=65–87 |isbn=978-0-8028-2389-2 |publisher=W. B. Eerdmans |location=Grand Rapids}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew's introductory title ({{lang|grc|βίβλος γενέσεως}}, ''book of generations'') has been interpreted in various ways, but most likely is simply a title for the genealogy that follows, echoing the [[Septuagint]] use of the same phrase for genealogies.&lt;ref name="nolland"/&gt;

Matthew's genealogy is considerably more complex than Luke's. It is overtly schematic, organized into three [[tesseradecads]] (sets of fourteen), each of a distinct character:
*The first is rich in annotations, including four mothers and mentioning the brothers of Judah and the brother [[Zerah]] of Perez.
*The second spans the [[Davidic line|Davidic royal line]], but omits several generations, ending with "Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon."
*The last, which appears to span only thirteen generations, connects Joseph to Zerubbabel through a series of otherwise unknown names, remarkably few for such a long period.

The total of 42 generations is achieved only by omitting several names, so the choice of three sets of fourteen seems deliberate. Various explanations have been suggested: fourteen is twice [[7 (number)#Judaism|seven]], symbolizing perfection and covenant, and is also the [[gematria]] (numerical value) of the name ''[[David (name)|David]]''.&lt;ref name="nolland"/&gt;

The rendering into Greek of Hebrew names in this genealogy is mostly in accord with the Septuagint, but there are a few peculiarities. The form ''Asaph'' seems to identify King Asa with the psalmist [[Psalms of Asaph|Asaph]]. Likewise, some see the form ''Amos'' for King Amon as suggesting the prophet [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], though the Septuagint does have this form. Both may simply be assimilations to more familiar names. More interesting, though, are the unique forms ''Boes'' (Boaz, LXX ''Boos'') and ''Rachab'' (Rahab, LXX ''Raab'').&lt;ref name="tamar"&gt;{{citation |last=Bauckham |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Bauckham |title=Tamar's Ancestry and Rahab's Marriage: Two Problems in the Matthean Genealogy |journal=Novum Testamentum |volume=37 |year=1995 |pages=313–329 |doi=10.1163/1568536952663168 |postscript=. |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three consecutive kings of Judah are omitted: [[Ahaziah of Judah|Ahaziah]], [[Jehoash of Judah|Jehoash]], and [[Amaziah of Judah|Amaziah]]. These three kings are seen as especially wicked, from the cursed line of [[Ahab]] through his daughter [[Athaliah]] to the third and fourth generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1Kings|21:21-29|NIV}}; cf. {{bibleverse|Exodus|20:5|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|Deuteronomy|29:20|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The author could have omitted them to create a second set of fourteen.&lt;ref name="nolland1997"&gt;{{citation |last=Nolland |first=John |title=Jechoniah and His Brothers |journal=[[Bulletin for Biblical Research]] |volume=7 |year=1997 |pages=169–178 |url=http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/genealogy_nolland.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another omitted king is [[Jehoiakim]], the father of [[Jeconiah]], also known as Jehoiachin. In Greek the names are even more similar, both being sometimes called ''Joachim''. When Matthew says, "Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile," he appears to conflate the two, because Jehoiakim, not Jeconiah, had brothers, but the exile was in the time of Jeconiah. While some see this as a mistake, others argue that the omission was once again deliberate, ensuring that the kings after David spanned exactly fourteen generations.&lt;ref name="nolland1997"/&gt;

The final group also contains fourteen generations. If Josiah's son was intended as Jehoiakim, then Jeconiah could be counted separately after the exile.&lt;ref name="nolland"/&gt; Mary is counted as a generation, proceeding from her father, Joseph. Though such a reckoning is otherwise little known or understood, it fits with the fourteen generations. Otherwise, it confuses the father of Mary with the husband of Mary.&lt;ref name=Wierwille&gt;{{citation |title=Dictionary of Jesus and the Gospels: A Compendium of Contemporary Biblical Scholarship |date=February 18, 1992 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ntwNm-tOogC&amp;pg=PA254#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Matthew%20begins%20his%20Gospel%22&amp;f=false |editors=Joel B. Green, Scot McKnight, &amp; I. Howard Marshall|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=0-8308-1777-8|pages=254–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have even proposed that Matthew's original text had one Joseph as the {{em|father}} of Mary, who then married another man of the same name.&lt;ref name="blair"&gt;{{citation |last=Blair |first=Harold A. |title=Matthew 1,16 and the Matthaean Genealogy |journal=Studia Evangelica |volume=2 |year=1964 |pages=149–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourteen generations span the time from [[Jeconiah]], born about 616 BC, to Jesus, born circa 3 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Jesus Christ Our Passover|author=Dr. V. P. Wierwille}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average generation gap would be around forty-four years. However, in the [[Old Testament]], there are even wider gaps between generations.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Ezra's, {{bibleverse|Ezra|7:1-5|NIV}} (cf. {{bibleverse|1Chronicles|6:3-14|NIV}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Also, we do not see any instances of [[papponymic]] naming patterns, where children are named after their grandparents, which was a common custom throughout this period. This may indicate that Matthew has telescoped this segment by collapsing such repetitions.&lt;ref name="albright"&gt;{{citation |last=Albright |first=William F. |authorlink= William F.

==Luke's genealogy==
[[File:KellsFol200rGeneolgyOfChrist.jpg|right|thumb|Luke's genealogy of Jesus, from the [[Book of Kells]], transcribed by [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic]] [[monk]]s c. 800]]
In the Gospel of Luke, the genealogy appears at the beginning of the public life of Jesus. This version is in ascending order from Joseph to Adam.&lt;ref name=maas&gt;Maas, Anthony. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06410a.htm "Genealogy of Christ"] The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 9 Oct. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; After telling of the baptism of Jesus, {{bibleref2|Luke|3:23–38|9}} states, "Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was ''[the son]'' of Heli, ..." (3:23) and continues on until "Adam, which was ''[the son]'' of God." (3:38) The Greek text of Luke's Gospel does not use the word "son" in the genealogy after "son of Joseph". Robertson notes that, in the Greek, "Luke has the article ''tou'' repeating ''uiou'' (Son) except before Joseph".&lt;ref name=wordpic /&gt;

This genealogy descends from the [[Davidic line]] through [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], who is an otherwise little-known son of David, mentioned briefly in the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1Chronicles|3:5|NIV}}; but also see {{bibleverse|Zechariah|12:12|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancestry of David, Luke agrees completely with the Old Testament. [[Cainan]] is included between Shelah and Arphaxad, following the [[Septuagint]] text (though not included in the [[Masoretic text]] followed by most modern Bibles).

However, [[Irenaeus]] counts only 72 generations from Adam.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Irenaeus |authorlink=Irenaeus |title=[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]] ("Against Heresies") |page=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.iv.xxiii.html#ix.iv.xxiii–p10 3.22.3]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reading "son of Aminadab, son of Aram," from the Old Testament is well attested. The [[Nestle-Aland]] critical edition, considered the best authority by most modern scholars, accepts the variant "son of Aminadab, son of Admin, son of Arni,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Willker |first=Wieland |url=http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/TCG/TC-Luke.pdf |title=A Textual Commentary on the Greek Gospels |volume=vol. 3: Luke |page=TVU 39 |year=2009 |edition=6th |accessdate=2009-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327165542/http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/TCG/TC-Luke.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}.

Luke's qualification "as was supposed" ({{lang|grc|ἐνομίζετο}}) avoids stating that Jesus was actually a son of Joseph, since [[Virgin birth of Jesus|his virgin birth]] is affirmed in the same gospel. From as early as [[John of Damascus]], the view of "as was supposed of Joseph" regards Luke as calling Jesus a son of Eli—meaning that [[Heli (Bible)|Heli]] ({{lang|grc|Ἠλί}}, Heli) was the maternal grandfather of Jesus, with Luke tracing the ancestry of Jesus through Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Schaff |first=Philip |title=The Gospel According to Matthew |year=1882 |pages=4–5 |place=New York |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |isbn=0-8370-9740-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore per [[Adam Clarke]] (1817), [[John Wesley]], [[John Kitto]] and others the expression "Joseph, [ ] of Heli", without the word "son" being present in the Greek, indicates that "Joseph, of Heli" is to be read "Joseph, [son-in-law] of Heli". There are, however, other interpretations of how this qualification relates to the rest of the genealogy. Some see the remainder as the true genealogy of Joseph, despite the different genealogy given in Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Farrar |first=F.W. |title=The Gospel According to St. Luke |year=1892 |pages=369–375 |place=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations for divergence==
[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -06- - Meeting at the Golden Gate.jpg|thumb|right|[[Giotto di Bondone]], ''The Meeting at the Golden Gate'', 1305.]]
The holy fathers of the Orthodox Church state that both accounts are true. In his famous book ''An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith'', St John Damascene says the following."One ought also to observe this, that the law was that when a man died without seed, this man's brother should take to wife the wife of the dead man and raise up seed to his brother. The offspring, therefore, belonged by nature to the second, that is, to him that begat it, but by law to the dead. Born then of the line of Nathan, the son of David, Levi begat Melchi and Panther: Panther begat Barpanther, so called. This Barpanther begat Joachim: Joachim begat the holy Mother of God. And of the line of Solomon, the son of David, Mathan had a wife of whom he begat Jacob. Now on the death of Mathan, Melchi, of the tribe of Nathan, the son of Levi and brother of Panther, married the wife of Mathan, Jacob's mother, of whom he begat Heli. Therefore Jacob and Heli became brothers on tile mother's side, Jacob being of the tribe of Solomon and Heli of the tribe of Nathan. Then Heli of the tribe of Nathan died childless, and Jacob his brother, of the tribe of Solomon, took his wife and raised up seed to his brother and begat Joseph. Joseph, therefore, is by nature the son of Jacob, of the line of Solomon, but by law he is the son of Heli of the line of Nathan."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.orthodox.net/fathers/exactiv.html#BOOK_IV_CHAPTER_XIV |title=BOOK IV CHAPTER XIV -&gt; Concerning our Lord's genealogy and concerning the holy Mother of God |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship tends to see the genealogies of Jesus as theological constructs rather than factual history: family pedigrees would not usually have been available for non-priestly families, and the contradictions between the two lists are seen as clear evidence that these were not based on genealogical records. Additionally, the use of titles such as 'Son of God' and 'Son of David' are seen as evidence that they do not come from the earliest Gospel traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall D. Johnson ''The Purpose of the Biblical Genealogies with Special Reference to the Setting of the Genealogies of Jesus'' (Wipf and Stock, 2002) page&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond E. Brown]] says the genealogies "tell us nothing certain about his grandparents or his great-grand-parents".&lt;ref&gt;Raymond E. Brown, ''The Birth of the Messiah'' (Doubleday, 1977), page 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert H. Gundry|Gundry]] suggests the series of unknown names in Matthew connecting Joseph's grandfather to Zerubbabel as an outright fabrication, produced by collecting and then modifying various names from 1 Chronicles.&lt;ref name="gundry"&gt;{{citation |last=Gundry |first=Robert H. |authorlink=Robert H. Gundry |title=Matthew: A Commentary on his Literary and Theological Art |place=Grand Rapids |publisher=W. B. Eerdmans |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-8028-3549-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sivertsen sees Luke's as artificially pieced together out of oral traditions. The pre-exilic series ''Levi, Simeon, Judah, Joseph'' consists of the names of tribal patriarchs, far more common after the exile than before, while the name ''Mattathias'' and its variants begin at least three suspiciously similar segments.&lt;ref name="sivertsen"/&gt; Kuhn likewise suggests that the two series ''Jesus–Mattathias'' (77–63) and ''Jesus–Mattatha'' (49–37) are duplicates.&lt;ref&gt;As summarized in {{citation |last=Marshall |first=I. Howard |title=The Gospel of Luke: A Commentary on the Greek Text |year=1978 |page=159 |isbn=0-8028-3512-0 |publisher=W. B. Eerdmans |location=Grand Rapids}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contradictions between the lists have been used to question the accuracy of the gospel accounts since ancient times,&lt;ref&gt;A famous example is the anti-Christian polemic of the Roman Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]], ''[[s:Against the Galileans|Against the Galileans]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and several early Christian authors responded to this. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], for example, attempted on several occasions to refute every criticism, not only because the [[Manichaeans]] in his day were using the differences to attack Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Augustine of Hippo |authorlink=Augustine of Hippo |title=Contra Faustum (Reply to Faustus, c. 400) |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf104.iv.ix.i.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also because he himself had seen them in his youth as cause for doubting the veracity of the Gospels.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Augustine of Hippo |authorlink=Augustine of Hippo |title=Sermon 1 |page=6 |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf106.vii.iii.html#vii.iii-p32}}&lt;/ref&gt; His explanation for the different names given for Joseph's father is that Joseph had a biological father and an adoptive father, and that one of the gospels traces the genealogy through the adoptive father in order to draw parallels between Joseph and Jesus (both having an adoptive father) and as a metaphor for God's relationship with humankind, in the sense that God "adopted" human beings as his children.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Augustine of Hippo |authorlink=Augustine of Hippo |title=Contra Faustum (Reply to Faustus, c. 400) |page=3 |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf104.iv.ix.i.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common explanation for the divergence is that Matthew is recording the actual legal genealogy of Jesus through Joseph, according to Jewish custom, whereas Luke, writing for a Gentile audience, gives the actual biological genealogy of Jesus through Mary.&lt;ref name=wordpic&gt;Robertson, A.T. "[http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/robertsons-word-pictures/luke/luke-3-23.html Commentary on Luke 3:23]". "Robertson's Word Pictures of the New Testament". Broadman Press 1932,33, Renewal 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is problematic, however, because both trace their genealogy through Joseph. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], on the other hand, affirmed the interpretation of [[Sextus Julius Africanus|Africanus]] that Luke's genealogy is of Joseph (not of Mary), who was the natural son of Jacob, though legally of Eli who was the [[:wiktionary:uterine brother|uterine brother]] of Jacob.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{citation|title=Dictionary of Jesus and the Gospels: A Compendium of Contemporary Biblical Scholarship|year=1992 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ntwNm-tOogC&amp;pg=PA254#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Matthew%20begins%20his%20Gospel%22&amp;f=false |editors=Joel B. Green, Scot McKnight, &amp; I. Howard Marshall|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=0-8308-1777-8|pages=254–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levirate marriage===
The earliest tradition that explains the divergence of Joseph's lineages involves the law of levirate marriage. A woman whose husband died without issue was bound by law to be married to her husband's brother, and the first-born son of such a so-called [[Yibbum|levirate marriage]] was reckoned and registered as the son of the deceased brother (Deuteronomy 25:5 sqq.).&lt;ref name=Anthony&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06408a.htm Maas, Anthony. "Genealogy (in the Bible)." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 9 Oct. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sextus Julius Africanus]], in his 3rd-century ''Epistle to Aristides'', reports a tradition that Joseph was born from just such a levirate marriage. According to this report, Joseph's natural father was Jacob son of Matthan, as given in Matthew, while his legal father was Eli son of Melchi (''sic''), as given in Luke.&lt;ref name="africanus"&gt;{{citation |author=Sextus Julius Africanus |authorlink=Sextus Julius Africanus |title=Epistula ad Aristidem (Epistle to Aristides) |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06.v.iii.i.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, however, gives a text with much the same passage, to which, he suggests, Julius Africanus may have been responding: {{citation |last=Johnson |first=Marshall D. |title=The purpose of the Biblical genealogies |edition=2nd |year=1988 |page=273 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-35644-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vQ89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been questioned, however, whether levirate marriages actually occurred among uterine brothers;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Mussies |first=Gerard |title=Parallels to Matthew's Version of the Pedigree of Jesus |journal=Novum Testamentum |volume=28 |year=1986 |jstor=1560666 |postscript=. |issue=1 |pages=32–47 [41] |doi=10.1163/156853686X00075}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are expressly excluded in the [[Hillel the Elder|Halakhah Beth Hillel]] but permitted by [[Shammai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ws|[[s:Mishnah/Seder Nashim/Tractate Yevamot|Yebamoth 1.1]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] theologian [[Anthony Maas]], the question proposed to Jesus by the Sadducees in all three Synoptic Gospels&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 22:24; Mark 12:19; Luke 20:28&lt;/ref&gt; regarding a woman with seven levirate husbands suggests that this law was observed at the time of Christ.&lt;ref name=Anthony/&gt;

Julius Africanus, explaining the origin of Joseph from levirate marriage, makes a mistake:

{{quote|At the end of the same letter, Africanus adds: "Matthan, a descendant of Solomon, begat Jacob. After the death of Matthan, Melki [must be: Matthat], a descendant of Nathan, begat Heli by the same woman. Therefore, Heli and Jacob must be uterine brothers. Heli died childless; Jacob raised up his seed by begetting Joseph who was his son according to the flesh, and Heli's son according to the Law. So, we can say that Joseph was the son of them both|(Eusebius of Cesarea. The History of the Church, 1,7)}}

This error, however, is uncritical:

{{quote|The explanation offered by Africanus is correct, though he confused Melki with Matthat. The genealogy in Matthew lists births according to the flesh; the one in Luke is according to the Law. It must be added that the levirate links between the two genealogies are found not only at the end, but also in the beginning. This conclusion is obvious because both genealogies intersect in the middle at Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel (see Mt 1:12-13; Lk 3:27). Nathan was the older brother; Solomon was younger, next in line after him (see 2 Sam 5:14-16; 1 Cron 3:5), therefore he was the first candidate to a levirate marriage (compare Ruth 3-4; Lk 20:27-33). The Old Testament is silent on whether Nathan had children, so we may very well conclude that he had none. Solomon, however, had much capacity for love: «And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines» (1 Kings 11:3). So, in theory, he could have married Nathan's widow. If this is so, Mattatha is the son of Solomon according to the flesh and the son of Nathan according to the Law. In light of the above-mentioned circumstances, the differences between the two genealogies no longer present a problem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079NQVXKR Sterkh V. "Answers for a Jew"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Maternal ancestry in Luke===
A more straightforward and the most common explanation is that Luke's genealogy is of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], with Eli being her father, while Matthew's describes the genealogy of Joseph.&lt;ref name="cathen"&gt;{{cite CE1913 |last=Maas |first=Anthony |authorlink=Anthony Maas |wstitle=Genealogy of Christ |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was advanced as early as [[John of Damascus]] (d.749).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Luke's text says that Jesus was "a son, as was supposed, of Joseph, of Eli".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Luke|3:23|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The qualification has traditionally been understood as acknowledgment of the virgin birth, but some instead see a [[parenthetical expression]]: "a son (as was supposed of Joseph) of Eli."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Aquinas |first=Thomas |authorlink= Thomas Aquinas |title=[[Summa Theologica]] |page=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.TP_Q31_A3.html#TP_Q31_A3–p13 IIIa, q.31, a.3, Reply to Objection 2] |postscript=,}} offers this interpretation, that Luke calls Jesus a son of Eli, without making the leap to explain why.&lt;/ref&gt; In this interpretation, Jesus is called a son of Eli because Eli was his maternal grandfather, his nearest male ancestor.&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt; A variation on this idea is to explain "Joseph son of Eli" as meaning a son-in-law,&lt;ref name="lightfoot"&gt;{{citation |last=Lightfoot |first=John |authorlink= John Lightfoot |title=Horæ Hebraicæ et Talmudicæ |volume=3 |year=1663 |publication-date=1859 |page=55 |url=http://philologos.org/__eb-jl/luke03.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps even an adoptive heir to Eli through his only daughter Mary.&lt;ref name="nolland2005"&gt;{{citation |last=Nolland |first=John |year=2005 |title=The Gospel of Matthew: a commentary on the Greek text |page=70 |isbn=978-0-8028-2389-2 |publisher=W. B. Eerdmans |location=Grand Rapids |postscript=,}} considers this harmonization "the most attractive."&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the Old Testament use of such an expression is Jair, who is called "Jair son of Manasseh"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Numbers|32:41|NIV}}; {{bibleverse|Deuteronomy|3:14|NIV}}; {{bibleverse|1Kings|4:13|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but was actually son of Manasseh's granddaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1Chronicles|2:21-23|NIV}};{{bibleverse|1Chronicles|7:14|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the argument goes, it is natural for the [[Four Evangelists|evangelist]], acknowledging the unique case of the virgin birth, to give the maternal genealogy of Jesus, while expressing it a bit awkwardly in the traditional patrilinear style.

According to [[R. A. Torrey]], the reason Mary is not implicitly mentioned by name is because the [[ancient Hebrews]] never permitted the name of a woman to enter the genealogical tables, but inserted her husband as the son of him who was, in reality, but his father-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;Torrey, R. A. "[http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/cmt/tsk/luk003.htm Commentary on Luke 3]". "The Treasury of Scriptural Knowledge", 1880.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lightfoot&lt;ref name="lightfoot"/&gt; sees confirmation in an obscure passage of the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud|j.]] [[Hagigah]] 77d.&lt;/ref&gt; which, as he reads it, refers to "Mary daughter of Eli"; however, both the identity of this Mary and the reading are doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.frontline-apologetics.com/mary_genealogy_talmud.html|title=Mary's Genealogy &amp; the Talmud|accessdate=2009-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323155324/http://www.frontline-apologetics.com/mary_genealogy_talmud.html|archive-date=23 March 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patristic tradition, on the contrary, consistently identifies Mary's father as [[Joachim]]. It has been suggested that ''Eli'' is short for ''Eliakim'',&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt; which in the Old Testament is an alternate name of Jehoiakim,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2Chronicles|36:4|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for whom Joachim is named.

The theory neatly accounts for the genealogical divergence. It is consistent with the early tradition ascribing a Davidic ancestry to Mary. It is also consistent with Luke's intimate acquaintance with [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], in contrast to Matthew's focus on [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]'s perspective. On the other hand, there is no explicit indication whatsoever, either in the Gospel or in any early tradition, that the genealogy is Mary's.

After John of Damascus the claim that Luke gives Mary's genealogy is mentioned in a single extant Western medieval text,{{when|date=December 2013}} in which [[pseudo-Hilary]] cites it as an opinion held by many, though not himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Pseudo-Hilary |title=Tractate 1 |postscript=,}} apud {{citation|editor=Angelo Mai|editor-link=Angelo Mai|year=1852|title=Nova patrum bibliotheca|volume=1|pages=477–478{{lang|la|Multi volunt, generationem, quam enumerat Matthaeus, deputari Ioseph; et generationem quam enumerat Lucas, deputari Mariae; ut quia caput mulieris vir dicitur, viro etiam eiusdem generatio nuncupetur. Sed hoc regulae non convenit, vel quaestioni quae est superius: id est, ubi generationum ratio demonstrator, verissime solutum est.}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was revived by [[Annius of Viterbo]] in 1498&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Annius of Viterbo |authorlink=Annius of Viterbo |title=Antiquitatum Variarum |year=1498}}. In this notorious forgery, Joachim is identified as Eli in a passage ascribed to [[Philo]].&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly grew in popularity.

Modern scholars discount this approach: [[Raymond E. Brown]] called it a "pious deduction"; and [[Joachim Gnilka]] "the desperation of embarrassment".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Frederick Dale Bruner, ''Matthew: The Christbook, Matthew 1-12'' (Eerdmans, 2004), page 21-22. See also Larry Hurtado, ''Lord Jesus Christ'' (Eerdmans, 2003), page 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish law is relevant to these matters. It does not accept maternal ancestry as applying to lineage claims, which go through the father alone. See on this the discussion in the section "Legal inheritance," below, and the footnote reference provided on this subject there.

===Maternal ancestry in Matthew===
A minority view holds that while Luke gives the genealogy of Joseph, Matthew gives the genealogy of Mary. A few ancient authorities seem to offer this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Clement of Alexandria |authorlink=Clement of Alexandria |title=[[Stromata]] |page=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.vi.iv.i.xxi.html#vi.iv.i.xxi–p125 21] |quote=And in the Gospel according to Matthew, the genealogy which begins with Abraham is continued down to Mary the mother of the Lord.}} {{citation |author=Victorinus of Pettau |authorlink=Victorinus of Pettau |title=In Apocalypsin (Commentary on the Apocalypse) |pages=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf07.vi.ii.iv.html#vi.ii.iv–p11.4 4.7–10] |quote=Matthew strives to declare to us the genealogy of Mary, from whom Christ took flesh.}} But already the possibility is excluded by {{citation |author=Irenaeus |authorlink=Irenaeus |title=[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]] (Against Heresies) |page=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.iv.xxii.html#ix.iv.xxii–p32 3.21.9]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Greek text as it stands is plainly against it, it has been proposed that in the original text Matthew had one Joseph as Mary's father and another as her husband. This neatly explains not only why Matthew's genealogy differs from Luke's, but also why Matthew counts fourteen generations rather than thirteen. Blair sees the various extant versions as the predictable result of copyists repeatedly attempting to correct an apparent mistake.&lt;ref name="blair"/&gt; Others argue that here the [[Aramaic primacy|Aramaic original]] of Matthew used the word ''gowra'' (which could mean ''father''), which, in the absence of vowel markings, was read by the Greek translator as ''gura'' (''husband'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Roth |first=Andrew Gabriel |title=Proofs of Peshitta Originality in the Gospel According to Matthew &amp; the Gowra Scenario: Exploding the Myth of a Flawed Genealogy |year=2003 |url=http://aramaicnttruth.org/downloads/Peshitta%20Matthew%20and%20the%20Gowra%20Scenario.pdf |accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, an early understanding that Matthew traced Mary's genealogy would explain why the contradiction between Matthew and Luke apparently escaped notice until the 3rd century. This position is also clearly stated in ''Jesus Christ Our Promised Seed''.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Paul Wierwille, ''Jesus Christ Our Promised Seed'', American Christian Press, New Knoxville, OH, 2006, pages 113-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Jewish tradition relating Mary to Luke's genealogy is recorded in the ''[[Doctrina Jacobi]]'' (written in 634), in which a Tiberian rabbi mocks the Christian veneration of Mary by recounting her genealogy according to the tradition of the Jews of [[Tiberias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=[[Doctrina Jacobi]]|page=1.42}} (''[[Patrologia Orientalis|PO]]'' [http://www.patristique.org/IMG/pdf/PO_40_VIII_5.pdf 40.67–68]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Why do Christians extol Mary so highly, calling her nobler than the Cherubim, incomparably greater than the Seraphim, raised above the heavens, purer than the very rays of the sun? For she was a woman, of the race of David, born to Anne her mother and Joachim her father, who was son of Panther. Panther and Melchi were brothers, sons of Levi, of the stock of Nathan, whose father was David of the tribe of Judah.&lt;ref&gt;Translation from {{citation |last=Williams |first=A. Lukyn |title=Adversus Judaeos: a bird's-eye view of Christian apologiae until the Renaissance |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1935 |pages=184–185 |oclc=747771 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6m43AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA185}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Lukan version of Levirate marriage theory===
Although most accounts ascribing the Luke genealogy to Mary's line do not include a levirate marriage this is added by the above sources. Each of these texts then goes on to describe, just as in Julius Africanus (but omitting the name of Estha), how Melchi was related to Joseph through a levirate marriage.

[[Bede]] assumed that Julius Africanus was mistaken and corrected ''Melchi'' to ''Matthat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Bede |authorlink=Bede |title=In Lucae evangelium expositio (On the Gospel of Luke) |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[papponymic]]s were common in this period,&lt;ref name="sivertsen"&gt;{{citation |last=Sivertsen |first=Barbara |title=New testament genealogies and the families of Mary and Joseph |journal=Biblical Theology Bulletin |volume=35 |pages=43–50 |year=2005 |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/New+testament+genealogies+and+the+families+of+Mary+and+Joseph-a0133946349 |doi=10.1177/01461079050350020201 |postscript=. |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it would not be surprising if Matthat were also named Melchi after his grandfather.

===Panther===
Controversy has surrounded the name ''Panther'', mentioned above, because of a charge that Jesus' father was a soldier named [[Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera|Pantera]]. [[Celsus]] mentions this in his writing, ''[[The True Word]]'', where he is quoted by Origen in Book 1: 32. "But let us now return to where the Jew is introduced, speaking of the mother of Jesus, and saying that "when she was pregnant she was turned out of doors by the carpenter to whom she had been betrothed, as having been guilty of adultery, and that she bore a child to a certain soldier named Panthera."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Origen |authorlink=Origen |title=Against Celsus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427150628/http://duke.usask.ca/~niallm/252/Celstop.htm |archivedate=2006-04-27 |deadurl=yes |url=http://duke.usask.ca/~niallm/252/Celstop.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Origen |authorlink=Origen |title=Contra Celsum (Reply to Celsus) |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.vi.ix.i.xxxiii.html 1.32}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], in refutation of Celsus, writes that Joseph and Cleopas were sons of "Jacob, surnamed Panther."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=of Salamis|first1=Epiphanius|last2=Williams|first2=Frank|title=The Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis: De fide. Books II and III Sect 78:7,5|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004228411|page=620|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKtzRNP0Z70C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=panarion+book+2&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT_cDdrujQAhUHwVQKHfyfB8EQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=panther&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 December 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Talmudic-era texts referring to Jesus as the son of Pantera (Pandera) are Tosefta [[Hullin]] 2:22f: "Jacob ... came to heal him in the name of Jesus son of Pantera" and [[Kohelet Rabbah|Qohelet Rabbah]] 1:8(3): "Jacob ... came to heal him in the name of Jesus son of Pandera" and some editions of the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] also specifically name Jesus as the son of Pandera:&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, pp 52-62, 133-141&lt;/ref&gt; Jerusalem Abodah Zarah 2:2/7: "someone ... whispered to him in the name of Jesus son of Pandera"; Jerusalem Shabboth 14:4/8: "someone ... whispered to him in the name of Jesus son of Pandera"; Jerusalem Abodah Zarah 2:2/12: "Jacob ... came to heal him. He said to him: we will speak to you in the name of Jesus son of Pandera"; Jerusalem Shabboth 14:4/13: "Jacob ... came in the name of Jesus Pandera to heal him". Because some editions of the Jerusalem Talmud do not contain the name Jesus in these passages the association is disputed.

===Legal inheritance===
One of the traditional explanations is that Matthew traces not a genealogy in the modern biological sense, but a record of legal inheritance showing the succession of Jesus in the royal line.

According to this theory, Matthew's immediate goal is therefore not David, but Jeconiah, and in his final group of fourteen, he may freely jump to a maternal grandfather, skip generations, or perhaps even follow an adoptive lineage in order to get there.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Johnson |first=Marshall D. |title=The purpose of the Biblical genealogies |edition=2nd |year=1988 |page=142 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-35644-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts have been made to reconstruct Matthew's route, from the seminal work of Lord Hervey&lt;ref name="hervey"&gt;{{citation |last=Hervey |first=Arthur Charles |authorlink=Arthur Charles Hervey |title=The Genealogies of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ |year=1853 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=I8NhHThXtbEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Masson's recent work,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Masson |first=Jacques |title=Jesus, fils de David, dans les généalogies de saint Mathieu et de saint Luc |year=1982 |publisher=Téqui |location=Paris |isbn=2-85244-511-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but all are necessarily highly speculative.

As a starting point, one of Joseph's two fathers could be by simple adoption, as Augustine suggests, or more likely the special adoption by a father-in-law with no sons, or could be a maternal grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Augustine of Hippo|authorlink=Augustine of Hippo |title=Sermon 1 |pages=27–29 |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf106.vii.iii.html#vii.iii-p122}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the resemblance between ''Matthan'' and ''Matthat'' suggests they are the same man (in which case Jacob and Eli are either identical or full brothers involved in a [[Yibbum|levirate marriage]]), and Matthew's departure from Luke at that point can only be to follow legal line of inheritance, perhaps through a maternal grandfather. Such reasoning could further explain what has happened with Zerubbabel and Shealtiel.&lt;ref name="hervey" /&gt;  A key difficulty with these explanations, however, is that there is no adoption in Jewish law, which of course is the relevant law tradition even according to Jesus (Matt. 23:1-3), not the Roman law tradition. If Joseph is not the biological father, his lineage does not apply to Jesus, and there is no provision available within Jewish law for this to be altered. One's natural father is always one's father. Nor is inheritance of lineage claims even possible through one's mother, in Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;See, on this, the articles "Adoption" by Lewis Dembitz and Kaufmann Kohler in The Jewish Encyclopaedia (1906), available online at: http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/852-adoption, and "Adoption" by Jeffrey H. Tigay and Ben-Zion (Benno) Schereschewsky in the Encyclopaedia Judaica (1st ed. 1972; the entry is reproduced again in the 2nd ed.), Vol. 2, col. 298-303. Lineage cannot be artificially transferred; one's natural parents are always one's parents. Guardianship, however, conveys most other rights and duties. Schereschewsky summarizes, col. 301: "Adoption is not known as a legal institution in Jewish law. According to halakhah [Jewish law] the personal status of parent and child is based on the natural family relationship only and there is no recognized way of creating this status artificially by a legal act or fiction. However, Jewish law does provide for consequences essentially similar to those caused by adoption to be created by legal means. These consequences are the right and obligation of a person to assume responsibility for (a) a child's physical and mental welfare and (b) his financial position, including matters of inheritance and maintenance." The "matters of inheritance" being referred to here is provision for inheritance of property, not lineage ancestry. Also relevant is the same Encyclopaedia's article on "Apotropos," i.e., guardianship, reproduced at http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0002_0_01191.html, and the introduction to these two articles helpfully summarizing the main points, by the editors of the Jewish Virtual Library, "Issues in Jewish Ethics: Adoption," at http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/adoption.html Also see the series of five articles or chapters by R. Michael J. Broyde, "The Establishment of Maternity and Paternity in Jewish and American Law," at the Jewish Law website http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/maternity1.html, in particular the opening comments to the first chapter and the whole discussion in its chapter "IV. Adoption and Establishing Parental Status," at http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/maternity4.html. For further discussion, see this article's "Talk" page.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament Apocrypha==
The apocryphal ''[[Gospel of James|Protevangelium of James]]'' tells of the miraculous birth of Mary to her parents, [[Joachim]] and [[Saint Anne|Anne]]. It further relates that Joseph, before his marriage to Mary, was an elderly widower with children of his own. Joachim and Anne are named in a number of other early sources&lt;ref&gt;Besides the apocryphal nativity narratives, the earliest seems to be {{citation |author=Epiphanius of Salamis |authorlink=Epiphanius of Salamis |title=[[Panarion]] |page=79.5.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Mary's parents, but this apocryphal text, which was not incorporated into the biblical canon, was so widely influential that it is not clear whether the names rest on any other independent tradition.

==Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel==
{{Main|Zerubbabel}}

The genealogies in Luke and Matthew appear to briefly converge at Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, though they differ both above Shealtiel and below Zerubbabel. This is also the point where Matthew departs from the Old Testament record.

[[File:VanLooZerubabbelCyrus.jpg|left|thumb|[[Zerubbabel]] displays a plan of [[Jerusalem]] to [[Cyrus the Great]]]]

In the Old Testament, [[Zerubbabel]] was a hero who led the Jews back from Babylon about 520 BC, governed Judah, and rebuilt the temple. Several times he is called a son of Shealtiel.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Ezra|3:2,8;5:2|NIV}}; {{bibleverse|Nehemiah|12:1|NIV}}; {{bibleverse|Haggai|1:1,12,14|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He appears once in the genealogies in the ''Book of Chronicles'',&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1Chronicles|3:17-24|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his descendants are traced for several generations, but the passage has a number of difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=VanderKam |first=James C. |title=From Joshua to Caiaphas: High Priests after the Exile |year=2004 |pages=104–106 |isbn=978-0-8006-2617-4 |publisher=Fortress Press |location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Septuagint|Septuagint text]] here gives his father as Shealtiel, the [[Masoretic text]] instead substitutes Shealtiel's brother Pedaiah—both sons of [[Jeconiah|King Jeconiah]], according to the passage. Some, accepting the Masoretic reading, suppose that Pedaiah begot a son for Shealtiel through a [[yibbum|levirate marriage]], but most scholars now accept the Septuagint reading as original, in agreement with Matthew and all other accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Japhet |first=Sara |authorlink=Sara Japhet |title=I &amp; II Chronicles: A Commentary |year=1993 |page=100 |isbn=978-0-664-22641-1 |publisher=Westminster/John Knox Press |location=Louisville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of Zerubbabel and Shealtiel in Luke may be no more than a coincidence of names (''Zerubbabel'', at least, is a very common Babylonian name&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Finkelstein |first=Louis |authorlink=Louis Finkelstein |title=The Jews: Their History |edition=4th |year=1970 |publisher=Schocken Books |page=51 |isbn=0-313-21242-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Shealtiel is given a completely different ancestry, and Zerubbabel a different son. Furthermore, interpolation between known dates would put the birth of Luke's Shealtiel at the very time when the celebrated Zerubbabel led the Jews back from Babylon. Thus, it is likely that Luke's Shealtiel and Zerubbabel were distinct from, and perhaps even named after, Matthew's.&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt;

If they are the same, as many insist, then the question arises of how Shealtiel, like Joseph, could have two fathers. Yet another complex [[yibbum|levirate marriage]] has often been invoked.&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt; [[Richard Bauckham]], however, argues for the authenticity of Luke alone. In this view, the genealogy in ''Chronicles'' is a late addition grafting Zerubbabel onto the lineage of his predecessors, and Matthew has simply followed the royal succession. In fact, Bauckham says, Zerubbabel's legitimacy hinged on descending from David through Nathan rather than through the prophetically cursed ruling line.&lt;ref name="bauckham"/&gt;

The name ''Rhesa'', given in Luke as the son of Zerubbabel, is usually seen as the Aramaic word ''rēʾšāʾ'', meaning ''head'' or ''prince''. It might well befit a son of Zerubbabel, but some see the name as a misplaced title of Zerubbabel himself.&lt;ref name="bauckham"/&gt; If so, the next generation in Luke, Joanan, might be Hananiah in ''Chronicles''. Subsequent names in Luke, as well as Matthew's next name Abiud, cannot be identified in ''Chronicles'' on more than a speculative basis.

==Fulfillment of prophecy==
{{Main|Davidic dynasty in Bible prophecy|Messianic prophecy in Christianity}}

By the time of Jesus, it was already commonly understood that several prophecies in the Old Testament promised a [[Messiah]] descended from King David.&lt;ref name="juel"&gt;{{citation |last=Juel |first=Donald |authorlink=Donald Juel |title=Messianic Exegesis: Christological Interpretation of the Old Testament in Early Christianity |year=1992 |pages=59–88 |isbn=978-0-8006-2707-2 |publisher=Fortress Press |location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{bibleverse|John|7:42|NIV}}; {{bibleverse|Matthew|22:41-42|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in tracing the Davidic ancestry of Jesus, the Gospels aim to show that these messianic prophecies are fulfilled in him.

The prophecy of Nathan&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2Samuel|7:12-16|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—understood as foretelling a son of God who would inherit the throne of his ancestor David and reign forever—is quoted in Hebrews&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Hebrews|1:5|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and strongly alluded to in Luke's account of the Annunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Luke|1:32-35|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Psalms&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Psalms|89:3-4|NIV}}; {{bibleverse|Psalms|132:11|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; record God's promise to establish the seed of David on his throne forever, while Isaiah&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Isaiah|16:5|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jeremiah&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Jeremiah|23:5-6|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; speak of the coming reign of a righteous king of the house of David.

David's ancestors are also understood as progenitors of the Messiah in several prophecies.&lt;ref name="juel"/&gt; Isaiah's description of the branch or root of [[Jesse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Isaiah|11:1-10|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is cited twice by Paul as a promise of the Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Acts|13:23|NIV}}; {{bibleverse|Romans|15:12|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

More controversial are the prophecies on the Messiah's relation, or lack thereof, to certain of David's descendants:
*God promised to establish the throne of King [[Solomon]] over Israel forever,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1Chronicles|22:9-10|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the promise was contingent upon obeying God's commandments.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1Chronicles|28:6-7|NIV}}; {{bibleverse|2Chronicles|7:17-18|NIV}}; {{bibleverse|1Kings|9:4-5|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon's failure to do so is explicitly cited as a reason for the subsequent division of his kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1Kings|11:4-11|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Against King Jehoiakim, Jeremiah prophesied, "He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David,"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Jeremiah|36:30-31|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and against his son King [[Jeconiah]], "Write this man childless, a man who will not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed will prosper, sitting on the throne of David or ruling again in Judah."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Jeremiah|22:24-30|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some see this prophecy as permanently disqualifying Jeconiah from the ancestry of the Messiah (though not necessarily of Joseph).&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{citation |author=Irenaeus |authorlink=Irenaeus |title=[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]] ("Against Heresies") |page=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.iv.xxii.html#ix.iv.xxii–p32 3.21.9j]}}&lt;/ref&gt; More likely, the curse was limited to Jeconiah's lifetime, and even then, rabbinical tradition has it that Jeconiah repented in exile and the curse was lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Johnson |first=Marshall D. |title=The purpose of the Biblical genealogies |edition=2nd |year=1988 |page=184 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-35644-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the Old Testament recounts that none of the punishments listed in the curse actually came to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Problem of the Curse on Jeconiah in Relation to the Genealogy of Jesus - Jews for Jesus |url=https://jewsforjesus.org/answers/the-problem-of-the-curse-on-jeconiah-in-relation-to-the-genealogy-of-jesus-issues-prophecy/ |website=Jews for Jesus |date=1 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*To [[Zerubbabel]], God declares through Haggai, "I will make you like my signet ring," in clear reversal of the prophecy against his grandfather Jeconiah, "though you were a signet ring on my right hand, yet I would pull you off."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Haggai|2:23|NIV}} (cf. {{bibleverse|Jeremiah|22:24|NIV}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Zerubbabel ruled as governor, though not as king, and has been regarded by many as a suitable and likely progenitor of the Messiah.

The promise to Solomon and Jeconiah's curse, if applicable, argue against Matthew. Yet evidently Matthew didn't find his respective genealogy incompatible with these prophecies.

Matthew also presents the [[virgin birth of Jesus]] as fulfillment of [[Isaiah 7:14]], which he quotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Matthew|1:22-23|NIV}}, citing {{bibleverse|Isaiah|7:14|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew apparently quotes the ancient [[Septuagint]] translation of the verse, which for an unclear reason, renders the Hebrew word "almah"(young woman) as "virgin" in Greek.

==Desposyni==
{{Main|Desposyni}}

''Desposyni'' (Greek δεσπόσυνοι, ''desposynoi'', "those of the master") is a term used uniquely by [[Sextus Julius Africanus]]&lt;ref name="africanus"/&gt; to refer to the relatives of Jesus. The Gospels mention four brothers of Jesus—[[James the Just|James]], [[Joses]], [[Simon (brother of Jesus)|Simon]], and [[Jude, brother of Jesus|Jude]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Matthew|13:55|NIV}}; {{bibleverse|Mark|6:3|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—and unnamed sisters.

[[Epiphanius of Salamis]] relates that the four brothers and the unnamed sisters that he names as Mary and Salome&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Epiphanius of Salamis |authorlink=Epiphanius of Salamis |title=[[Panarion]] |pages=78.8.1, 78.9.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or Anna and Salome)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=College |first1=St. Epiphanius of Cyprus ; translated by Young Richard Kim, Calvin |title=Ancoratus 60:1 |date=2014 |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-8132-2591-3 |pages=144 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxHWAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ancoratus+epiphanius&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAGoVChMI9Yz758uLyAIVDBmSCh3NMAjE#v=onepage&amp;q=anna&amp;f=false |accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; were children of Joseph by a previous marriage. These and their descendants were prominent in the early Church down to the 2nd century.&lt;ref name="bauckham2"&gt;{{citation |last=Bauckham |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Bauckham |title=Jude and the Relatives of Jesus in the Early Church |year=2004 |pages=5–31 |isbn=978-0-567-08297-8 |publisher=T &amp; T Clark International |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim authors extend family members to the 7th century.

Since ancient times, it has been debated precisely how these siblings were related to Jesus, or rather to Joseph and Mary, with her [[perpetual virginity]] at issue. There are three principal views on who these siblings were, named for their respective proponents:&lt;ref name="bauckham2"/&gt;
*The [[Helvidius|Helvidian]] view—subsequent children of Joseph and Mary.
*The [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanian]] view—children of Joseph by a previous marriage.
*The [[Jerome|Hieronymian]] view—first cousins of Jesus, and that Joseph was himself a virgin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tobin |first=Paul |url=http://webspace.webring.com/people/np/paul_tobin/jamesbrother.html |title=Rejection of Pascal's Wager: James, The Brother of Jesus |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no suggestion in ancient sources that Jesus himself had any physical children, but a claim has been popularized in recent decades that a [[Jesus bloodline|bloodline of Jesus]], through [[Mary Magdalene]], has survived and subsequently recorded in the&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{Citation |last=Bradley |first=Ed |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/27/60minutes/main1552009.shtml |title=The Secret of the Priory of Sion |journal=60 Minutes |series=CBS News |publisher=CBS Worldwide Inc. |date=30 April 2006 |editor-first=Jeanne |editor-last=Langley}}&lt;/ref&gt; book ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]''.

==Women mentioned==
Matthew inserts four women into the long list of men. The women are included early in the genealogy—[[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]], [[Rachab]], [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]], and "the wife of Uriah" ([[Bathsheba]]). Why Matthew chose to include these particular women, while passing over others such as the matriarchs [[Sarah]], [[Rebecca]], and [[Leah]], has been much discussed.

There may be a common thread among these four women, to which Matthew wishes to draw attention. He sees God working through Tamar's seduction of her father-in-law, through the collusion of Rahab the harlot with Joshua's spies, through Ruth the Moabite's unexpected marriage with Boaz, and through David and Bathsheba's [[adultery]].&lt;ref name=Maloney&gt;[http://americamagazine.org/issue/638/faith-focus/genealogy-jesus Maloney C.M., Robert P. "The Genealogy of Jesus: Shadows and lights in his past", ''America'', December 17, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{who|date=February 2014}} have suggested their possible Gentile origins. Rahab was a prostitute in [[Canaan]], [[Bathsheba]] was married to a [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]], Ruth resided in Moab, and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] had a name of Hebrew origin. The women's nationalities are not necessarily mentioned. The suggestion is that Matthew may be preparing the reader for the inclusion of the Gentiles in Christ's mission. Others point out an apparent element of sinfulness: Rahab was a prostitute, Tamar posed as a prostitute to seduce Judah, Bathsheba was an adulteress, and Ruth is sometimes seen as seducing Boaz—thus Matthew emphasizes God's grace in response to sin. Still others{{who|date=February 2014}} point out their unusual, even scandalous, unions—preparing the reader for what will be said about Mary. None of these explanations, however, adequately befits all four women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hutchinson |first=John C. |title=Women, Gentiles, and the Messianic Mission in Matthew's Genealogy |journal=Bibliotheca Sacra |volume=158 |year=2001 |pages=152–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nolland suggests simply that these were all the known women attached to David's genealogy in the [[Book of Ruth]].&lt;ref name="nolland"/&gt;

The conclusion of the genealogy proper is also unusual: having traced the ancestry of Joseph, Matthew identifies him not as the father of Jesus, but as the husband of Mary. The Greek text is explicit in making Jesus born to Mary, rather than to Joseph. This careful wording is to affirm the [[virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]], which Matthew proceeds to discuss, stating that Jesus was begotten not by Joseph but by God.

==Mary's kinship with Elizabeth==
Luke states that [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]], the mother of [[John the Baptist]], was a "relative" (Greek syggenēs, συγγενής) of Mary, and that Elizabeth was descended from [[Aaron]], of the tribe of [[Levi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Luke|1:5,36|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether she was an aunt, a cousin, or a more distant relation cannot be determined from the word. Some, such as [[Gregory Nazianzen]], have inferred from this that Mary herself was also a Levite descended from Aaron, and thus kingly and priestly lineages were united in Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{citation |author= |authorlink=Gregory Nazianzen |title=Carmen 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Thomas Aquinas]], have argued that the relationship was on the maternal side; that Mary's father was from Judah, Mary's mother from Levi.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Aquinas |title=[[Summa Theologica]] |pages=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.TP.ii.TP_Q31.TP_Q31_A2.html IIIa, q.31, a.2]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars like [[Raymond E. Brown|Raymond Brown]] (1973) and [[Géza Vermes]] (2005) suggest that the relationship between Mary and Elizabeth is simply an invention of Luke.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Brown |first=Raymond E. |authorlink=Raymond E. Brown |title=The Virginal Conception and Bodily Resurrection of Jesus |year=1973 |page=54 |publisher=Paulist Press |isbn=0-8091-1768-1 |postscript=,}} describes the relationship, not mentioned in the other Gospels, as "of dubious historicity." {{citation |last=Vermes |first=Géza |authorlink=Géza Vermes |title=The Nativity |page=143 |year=2006 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-385-52241-0 |postscript=,}} calls it "artificial and undoubtedly Luke's creation."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virgin birth==
[[File:Fabrizio Boschi, annunciazione.jpg|right|thumb|Annunciation by [[Fabrizio Boschi]]]]
{{Main|Virgin birth of Jesus}}

These two Gospels declare that Jesus was begotten not by Joseph, but by the power of the [[Holy Spirit]] while Mary was still a virgin, in fulfillment of prophecy. Thus, in mainstream Christianity, Jesus is regarded as being literally the "only begotten son" of God, while Joseph is regarded as his adoptive father.

Matthew immediately follows the genealogy of Jesus with: "This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Matthew|1:18|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, Luke tells of the [[Annunciation]]: "How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?" The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Luke|1:34-35|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question then arises, why do both gospels seem to trace the genealogy of Jesus through Joseph, when they deny that he is his biological father? Augustine considers it a sufficient answer that Joseph was the father of Jesus by adoption, his legal father, through whom he could rightfully claim descent from David.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Augustine of Hippo |authorlink=Augustine of Hippo |title=De consensu evangelistarum (On the Harmony of the Gospels) |pages=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf106.vi.v.ii.html 2.1.2–4] |postscript=;}} {{citation |author=Augustine of Hippo|authorlink=Augustine of Hippo |title=Sermon 1 |pages=16–21 |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf106.vii.iii.html#vii.iii-p67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tertullian]], on the other hand, argues that Jesus must have descended from David by blood through his mother Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Tertullian |authorlink=Tertullian |title=[[De Carne Christi|De carne Christi]] ("On the Flesh of Christ") |pages=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.v.vii.xx.html 20–22]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sees Biblical support in Paul's statement that Jesus was "born of a descendant of David according to the flesh".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Romans|1:3|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmations of Mary's Davidic ancestry are found early and often.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Ignatius of Antioch|authorlink=Ignatius of Antioch |title=Epistle to the Ephesians |page=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.v.ii.xviii.html 18]}}. {{citation |last=Martyr |first=Justin |authorlink=Justin Martyr |title=Dialogus cum Tryphone Judaeo (Dialogue with Trypho) |page=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.c.html 100]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ebionites]], a sect who denied the virgin birth, used a [[Gospel of the Ebionites|gospel]] which, according to [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], was a recension of Matthew that omitted the genealogy and infancy narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Epiphanius of Salamis |authorlink=Epiphanius of Salamis |title=[[Panarion]] |page=30.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences reflect the Ebionites' awareness of Jewish law (halakhah) relating to lineage inheritance, adoption, and the status of ancestry claims through the mother.

==Islam==
{{Main|Mary in Islam}}
[[File:MaryLineage.JPG|thumb|260px|Jesus' lineage in Islam, going back to his great-grandfather.]]

The [[Qur'an|Qurʼan]] upholds the [[virgin birth of Jesus]] ([[Jesus in Islam|ʻĪsā]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|19|20|e=22|style=ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus considers his genealogy only through Mary (Maryam), without mentioning Joseph.

Mary is very highly regarded in the Qurʼan, the [[Maryam (sura)|nineteenth sura]] being named for her. She is called a daughter of [[Imran (father of Maryam)|ʻImrān]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|66|12|style=ref}};{{cite quran|3|35|e=36|style=ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; whose family is the subject of the [[Al-i-Imran|third sura]]. The same Mary (Maryam) is also called a sister of Aaron (Hārūn) in one place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|19|28|style=ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and although this is often seen as an anachronistic conflation with the Old Testament [[Miriam]] (having the same name), who was sister to [[Aaron]] (Hārūn) and daughter to [[Amram]] (ʻImrān), the phrase is probably not to be understood literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor=Thomas Patrick Hughes|contribution=ʻImrān|title=A Dictionary of Islam|year=1995|isbn=978-81-206-0672-2|publisher=Asian Educational Services|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Muslim Scholar Sheikh Ibn Al-Feasy Al-Hanbali, the Quran used "Sister of [[Aaron]]" and "Daughter of [[Amram]]" for several reasons. One of those is the "relative calling" or ''laqb'' that is always used in Arabic literature. Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal Abu `Abd Allah al-Shaybani, for instance, is prevalently called "[[Ibn Hanbal]]" instead of "Ibn Mohammad". Or, [[Muhammad bin Idris asy-Syafi`i]] is always called "Imam [[Al-Shafi'i]]" instead of "Imam Idris" or "Imam Muhammad". This is how the Arabs refer to famous persons in their daily life. The same applies here; Sister of [[Aaron]] refers to "daughter of [[Aaron]]'s siblings'", and daughter of [[Amram]] refers to "direct lineage of [[Amram]]" ([[Amram]]'s descendents). This means that Mary was from the line of [[Amram]], but not of [[Aaron]]'s generation.

'''Geoffrey Francis Bowers''' (December 29, 1953{{spaced ndash}}September 30, 1987) was the [[plaintiff]] in one of the first [[HIV/AIDS]] [[Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|discrimination]] cases to go to public hearing.&lt;ref name=navarro&gt;{{citation|last=Navarro|first=Mireya|title=Vindicating a Lawyer with AIDS, Years Too Late; Bias Battle Over Dismissal Proves Costly Not Only to Worker, but to Law Firm|date=January 21, 1994|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DC1530F932A15752C0A962958260&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bowers was born on December 29, 1953, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].  He received his bachelor's degree from [[Brown University]] where he studied political science.  He worked in a factory and as a television news reporter before enrolling at the [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]] in [[New York City]] in the fall of 1979.&lt;ref name=navarro/&gt;

==Career and diagnosis==
During his time at law school, Bowers earned a position on the Cardozo [[Law review]] and worked part-time, first as a proofreader at a law firm and later as a researcher and writer for Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim and Ballon, a New York law firm.  After his graduation he joined Phillips, Nizer, et al. as an associate.&lt;ref name=navarro/&gt;

In August 1984, Bowers joined [[Baker McKenzie]] as a litigation associate.  Baker McKenzie is an international law firm, and Bowers hoped to use his knowledge of Italian, German, French, Dutch and Spanish.&lt;ref name=navarro/&gt;  The following year, Bowers began to experience throbbing headaches and see yellow spots.  He was diagnosed with [[meningitis]].&lt;ref name=navarro/&gt;  In April 1986, he was diagnosed with [[Kaposi's sarcoma]] and AIDS.&lt;ref name=nytjuly151987&gt;{{citation|title=Lawyer With AIDS Charges Job Discrimination|date=July 15, 1987|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9B0DE1D7153DF936A25754C0A961948260|accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1986 the law firm's partners gave Bowers a satisfactory evaluation.  Two months later, in July, they voted to dismiss him, without following normal termination procedures, including consulting with his supervisor or asking for a list of his clients and billable hours.  His supervisors objected to the decision, delaying its implementation. However, in October, 12 of the 15 partners again voted to dismiss him. He left the company on December 5, 1986.&lt;ref name=navarro/&gt;

==Baker &amp; McKenzie lawsuit and hearings==
Bowers subsequently filed a complaint with the [[New York State Division of Human Rights]] alleging discrimination.  On July 14, 1987, the New York State Division of Human Rights held the first hearings in the case in a [[trial]] format, with Judge Amos Carnegie overseeing the proceedings.  A representative for the firm claimed that Bowers was dismissed because of performance issues, while his complaint charged that he had been fired from his job because of the skin [[lesion]]s that had begun appearing on his body and face.&lt;ref name=nytjuly151987/&gt;  Bowers died on September 30, 1987, in [[Boston]] at the age of 33, just two months after the hearings began.  His long-term partner Alex Londres (a short story writer) died one year later, also of AIDS-related illness.&lt;ref name=navarro/&gt;

The hearings took place on 39 days over the course of two years.  It took more than six years for the case to finally be resolved, when in December 1993 the agency awarded its largest sum for any complaint to that date: $500,000 in compensatory damages and the back pay he would have earned had he remained employed.&lt;ref name=navarro/&gt;  Baker McKenzie appealed but subsequently withdrew the appeal in 1995 after they negotiated a confidential [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] with Bowers' family, forbidding parties from ever discussing the case or the terms of the agreement.

==''Philadelphia'' film and legal action ==
Bowers' family sued the writers and producers of the film ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'', claiming that it was based on Bowers' life. One year after Bowers' death, producer [[Scott Rudin]] had interviewed the Bowers family and their lawyers and, according to the Bowers family, promised them compensation.  Family members claim that 54 scenes in the film were very similar to events in Bowers' life, and that some of the information in the film could only have come from their interviews. The defense said that after Rudin sold the film idea to [[Tri-Star Pictures]], the studio which then went on to produce the film, he had no further involvement in its development, that he had never shared with the studio any of the information that had been provided to him by the Bowers family, and all screenplay material originating from the Bowers case had been taken only from publicly available sources.&lt;ref name=pristin&gt;{{citation|last=Pristin|first=Terry|title=Philadelphia Screenplay Suit to Reach Court|date=March 11, 1996|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E3DB1039F932A25750C0A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lawsuit was settled in 1996.  Although terms of the agreement were not released, the defendants did acknowledge that the film was "inspired in part" by Bowers' story.&lt;ref name=settlesuit&gt;{{citation|title=Philadelphia Makers Settle Suit|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 20, 1996|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E6D91739F933A15750C0A960958260|accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His life partner was Alex Londres who died from AIDS related illness one&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/21/nyregion/vindicating-lawyer-with-aids-years-too-late-bias-battle-over-dismissal-proves.html|title=Vindicating a Lawyer With AIDS, Years Too Late; Bias Battle Over Dismissal Proves Costly Not Only to Worker, but to Law Firm|last=Navarro|first=Mireya|date=1994|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; year after Bowers. Bowers' family of origin did not acknowledge Londres or include him in any way with the settlement, according to a letter he sent to a friend as he himself was struggling with the loss of his great love, Geoff.

'''Hilary of Poitiers''' ({{lang-la|Hilarius}}; c. 310{{snd}}c. 367)&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20071010.html General Audience] Libreria Editrice Vaticana&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Bishop of Poitiers]] and is a [[Doctor of the Church]]. He was sometimes referred to as the "Hammer of the [[Arians]]" ([[Latin]]: ''Malleus Arianorum'') and the "[[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] of the West."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=458}} His name comes from the Latin word for happy or cheerful. His optional memorial in the [[General Roman Calendar]] is 13 January. In the past, when this date was occupied by the [[Octave (liturgy)|Octave Day]] of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], his feast day was moved to 14 January.&lt;ref&gt;"Calendarium Romanum" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hilary was born at [[Poitiers]] either at the end of the 3rd or beginning of the 4th century A.D.{{sfn|Hunter|2010|p=302}} His parents were [[pagan]]s of distinction. He received a good pagan education,&lt;ref&gt;Bettenson, Henry. ''The Later Christian Fathers'' OUP (1970), p.4&lt;/ref&gt; which included a high level of Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Watson E.W. "Introduction to the Life and writings of St Hilary of Poitiers" in ''Library of Nicene and Post Nicene Fathers - Series II N° IX'' Eerdmans reprint 1983, p. ii&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied, later on, the Old and New Testament writings, with the result that he abandoned his [[Neo-Platonism]] for [[Christianity]], and with his wife and his daughter (traditionally named [[Saint Abra]]), was [[baptism|baptized]] and received into the [[Catholic Church|Church]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=458}}

The Christians of Poitiers so respected Hilary that about 350 or 353,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hunter|2010|p=302}} names the date as 350.&lt;/ref&gt; they unanimously elected him their bishop. At that time [[Arianism]] threatened to overrun the Western Church; Hilary undertook to repel the disruption. One of his first steps was to secure the [[excommunication]], by those of the Gallican hierarchy who still remained orthodox Christians, of Saturninus, the [[Arian]] [[Bishop of Arles]], and of [[Ursacius of Singidunum]] and [[Valens of Mursa]], two of his prominent supporters.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=458}}

About the same time, Hilary wrote to Emperor [[Constantius II]] a remonstrance against the persecutions by which the Arians had sought to crush their opponents (''Ad Constantium Augustum liber primus'', of which the most probable date is 355).&lt;ref&gt;[https://catholicsaints.info/lives-of-the-saints-saint-hilary-of-poitiers/ Butler, Alban. “Saint Hilary of Poitiers”. ''Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Principal Saints'', 1866. CatholicSaints.Info. 11 May 2016. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Historians refer to this first book to Constantius as "Book Against Valens," of which only fragments are extant.&lt;ref&gt;"Early Christian Greek and Latin Literature, A Literary History" O'Connell, Mathew, Peabody Mass, 2002, p.252-253&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts did not succeed at first, for at the [[synod]] of Biterrae ([[Béziers]]), summoned by the emperor in 356 with the professed purpose of settling the longstanding dispute, an imperial [[rescript]] banished the new bishop, along with [[Rhodanus|Rhodanus of Toulouse]], to [[Phrygia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=458-459}}&lt;ref&gt;Clavis Patrum Latinorun, E. Dekkers, Claudio Moreschin, Enrico Norello, Vienna, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilary spent nearly four years in exile, although the reasons for this banishment remain obscure. The traditional explanation is that Hilary was exiled for refusing to subscribe to the condemnation of Athanasius and the Nicene faith. More recently several scholars have suggested that political opposition to Constantius and support of the usurper [[Claudius Silvanus|Silvanus]] may have led to Hilary's exile.{{sfn|Hunter|2010|p=302}}

==In exile==
While in Phrygia, however, he continued to govern his diocese, as well as writing two of the most important of his contributions to dogmatic and polemical theology: the ''De synodis'' or ''De fide Orientalium'', an epistle addressed in 358 to the Semi-Arian bishops in [[Gaul]], Germany and [[Roman Britain|Britain]], analyzing the views of the Eastern bishops on the [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicene]] controversy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}} In reviewing the professions of faith of the Oriental bishops in the Councils of [[Council of Ancyra|Ancyra]], [[Council of Antioch|Antioch]], and [[Council of Sirmium|Sirmium]], he sought to show that sometimes the difference between certain doctrines and orthodox beliefs was rather in the words than in the ideas, which led to his counseling the bishops of the West to be more reserved in their condemnation.&lt;ref name=Clugnet&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07349b.htm Clugnet, Léon. "St. Hilary of Poitiers." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 14 Aug. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''De trinitate libri XII'', composed in 359 and 360, was the first successful expression in Latin of that Council's theological subtleties originally elaborated in Greek. Although some members of Hilary's own party thought the first had shown too great a forbearance towards the Arians, Hilary replied to their criticisms in the ''Apologetica ad reprehensores libri de synodis responsa''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}  Hilary was a firm guardian of the Trinity as taught by the Western church, and therefore saw the foreseen Antichrist in those who repudiated the divinity of the Son and thought Him to be but a created Being. "Hence also they who deny that Christ is the Son of God must have Antichrist for their Christ,"&lt;ref&gt;Hilary, De Trinitate, book 6, chap. 46, in NPNF, 2d series, vol. 9, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; was the way he stated it.{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=408-409}}

In his classic introduction to the works of Hilary, Watson summarizes Hilary’s points:
:“They were the forerunners of Antichrist. . . . They bear themselves not as bishops of Christ but as priests of Antichrist. This is not random abuse, but sober recognition of the fact, stated by St. John, that there are many Antichrists. For these men assume the cloak of piety, and pretend to preach the Gospel, with the one object of inducing others to deny Christ. It was the misery and folly of the day that men endeavoured to promote the cause of God by human means and the favour of the world. Hilary asks bishops, who believe in their office, whether the Apostles had secular support when by their preaching they converted the greater part of mankind. . . .  
:“The Church seeks for secular support, and in so doing insults Christ by the implication that His support is insufficient. She in her turn holds out the threat of exile and prison.  It was her endurance of these that drew men to her; now she imposes her faith by violence.  She craves for favours at the hand of her communicants; once it was her consecration that she braved the threatenings of persecutors.  Bishops in exile spread the Faith; now it is she that exiles bishops.  She boasts that the world loves her; the world's hatred was the evidence that she was Christ's. . . . The time of Antichrist, disguised as an angel of light, has come.  The true Christ is hidden from almost every mind and heart.  Antichrist is now obscuring the truth that he may assert falsehood hereafter."&lt;ref&gt;E. W. Watson, Introduction to Hilary of Poitiers, in NPNF, 2d series, vol. 9, pp. lii, liii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Constantius II - solidus - antioch RIC viii 025.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Constantius II coin.]]Hilary also attended several synods during his time in exile, including the [[council of Seleucia|council at Seleucia]] (359) which saw the triumph of the ''homoion'' party and the forbidding of all discussion of the divine substance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}} In 360, Hilary tried unsuccessfully to secure a personal audience with [[Constantius II|Constantius]], as well as to address the council which met at [[Constantinople]] in 360. When this council ratified the decisions of [[Council of Rimini|Ariminum]] and Seleucia, Hilary responded with the bitter ''In Constantium'', which attacked the Emperor Constantius as Antichrist and persecutor of orthodox Christians.{{sfn|Hunter|2010|p=302}} Hilary's urgent and repeated requests for public debates with his opponents, especially with Ursacius and Valens, proved at last so inconvenient that he was sent back to his diocese, which he appears to have reached about 361, within a very short time of the accession of Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}

==Later life==
On returning to his diocese in 361, Hilary spent most of the first two or three years trying to persuade the local clergy that the ''homoion'' confession was merely a cover for traditional Arian subordinationism. Thus, a number of synods in Gaul condemneded the creed promulgated at [[Council of Rimini|Council of Ariminium]] (359).&lt;ref&gt;Sulpicius Severus, ''Chronicum'' 2.45&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hunter|2010|p=303}}

In about 360 or 361, with Hilary's encouragement, [[Martin of Tours|Martin]], the future [[bishop of Tours]], founded a [[Ligugé Abbey|monastery at Ligugé]] in his diocese.

In 364, Hilary extended his efforts once more beyond Gaul. He impeached [[Auxentius of Milan|Auxentius]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|bishop of Milan]], a man high in the imperial favour, as heterodox. Emperor [[Valentinian I]] accordingly summoned Hilary to Milan to there maintain his charges. However, the supposed heretic gave satisfactory answers to all the questions proposed. Hilary denounced Auxentius as a hypocrite as he himself was ignominiously expelled from Milan. Upon returning home, Hilary in 365, published the ''Contra Arianos vel Auxentium Mediolanensem liber,'' describing his unsuccessful efforts against Auxentius. He also (but perhaps at a somewhat earlier date) published the ''Contra Constantium Augustum liber'', accusing the lately deceased emperor as having been the Antichrist, a rebel against [[God]], "a tyrant whose sole object had been to make a gift to the devil of that world for which [[Christ]] had suffered."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}

According to [[Jerome]], Hilary died in Poitiers in 367.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Vir Ill'' 100; {{harvnb|Hunter|2010|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
[[File:Divi Hilarii Pictavorum episcopi De Trinitate.tif|thumb|''Opera omnia'' (1523)]]
Recent research has distinguished between Hilary's thought before his period of exile in Phrygia under Constantius and the quality of his later major works.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} While Hilary closely followed the two great Alexandrians, [[Origen]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]], in exegesis and Christology respectively, his work shows many traces of vigorous independent thought.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}

===Exegetical===
Among Hilary's earliest writings, completed some time before his exile in 356, is his ''Commentarius in Evangelium Matthaei'', an allegorical exegesis of the first [[Gospel]]. This is the first Latin [[Biblical commentary|commentary]] on [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] to have survived in its entirety. Hilary's commentary was strongly influenced by Tertullian and Cyprian, and made use of several classical writers, including Cicero, Quintilian, Pliny and the Roman historians.{{sfn|Hunter|2010|p=303}}

Hilary's expositions of the [[Psalms]], ''Tractatus super Psalmos'', largely follow [[Origen]], and were composed some time after Hilary returned from exile in 360.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}} Since Jerome found the work incomplete,&lt;ref name="Vir Ill 100"&gt;''Vir Ill'' 100&lt;/ref&gt; no one knows whether Hilary originally commented on the whole Psalter. Now extant are the commentaries on Psalms 1, 2, 9, 13, 14, 51-69, 91, and 118-150.{{sfn|Hunter|2010|p=303}}

The third surviving exegetical writing by Hilary is the ''Tractatus mysteriorum'', preserved in a single manuscript first published in 1887.{{sfn|Hunter|2010|p=303}}

Because [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] cites part of the commentary on [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] as by "Sanctus Hilarius" it has been ascribed by various critics at different times to almost every known Hilary.

===Theological===
Hilary's major theological work was the twelve books now known as ''De Trinitate''. This was composed largely during his exile, though perhaps not completed until his return to Gaul in 360.{{sfn|Hunter|2010|p=304}}

Another important work is ''De synodis'', written early in 359 in preparation for the [[Council of Rimini|councils of Ariminium]] and Seleucia.{{sfn|Hunter|2010|p=304}}

===Historical works and hymns===
Various writings comprise Hilary's 'historical' works. These include the ''Liber II ad Constantium imperatorem'', the ''Liber in Constantium inperatorem'', ''Contra Arianos vel Auxentium Mediolanensem liber'', and the various documents relating to the Arian controversy in ''Fragmenta historica''.{{sfn|Hunter|2010|p=304}}

Some consider Hilary as the first Latin Christian hymn writer, because Jerome said Hilary produced a ''liber hymnorum''.&lt;ref name="Vir Ill 100"/&gt; Three hymns are attributed to him, though none are indisputable.

==Reputation and veneration==
Hilary is the pre-eminent Latin writer of the 4th century (before [[Ambrose]]). [[Augustine of Hippo]] called him "the illustrious doctor of the churches", and his works continued to be highly influential in later centuries. [[Venantius Fortunatus]] wrote a ''[[Hagiography|vita]]'' of Hilary by 550, but few now consider it reliable. More trustworthy are the notices in [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]] ([[Jerome's De Viris Illustribus|De vir. illus.]] 100), [[Sulpicius Severus]] (''Chron.'' ii. 39-45) and in Hilary's own writings.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}
[[Pope Pius IX]] formally recognized him as ''[[Doctor of the Church|Universae Ecclesiae Doctor]]'' in 1851.

In the Roman calendar of saints, Hilary's feast day is on 13 January, 14 January in the pre-1970 form of the calendar.  The spring terms of the English and Irish Law Courts and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Dublin|Dublin]] Universities are called the Hilary term since they begin on approximately this date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor-last= Cross |editor2-last =Livingstone | editor-first= F.L. | editor2-first = E.A. |title =The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church | article = Hilary of Poitiers, St. | publisher = OUP | date = 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Some consider Saint Hilary of Poitiers as the [[patron saint]] of [[lawyer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farmer|first=David Hugh|title=The Oxford dictionary of saints|year=1997|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=0-19-280058-2|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconography===
From his writing St. Hilary's symbol came to be three books and a quill pen.&lt;ref name=hisperia&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sthilary.com/St.%20Hilary.htm |title="Saint Hilary of Poitiers", St. Hilary's Episcopal Church; Hisperia, California |access-date=2013-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510232901/http://www.sthilary.com/St.%20Hilary.htm |archive-date=2013-05-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dedications===
[[Sulpicius Severus]]' ''Vita Sancti Martini'' led to a cult of Saint Hilary as well as of [[St. Martin of Tours]] which spread early to western [[Great Britain|Britain]]. The villages of [[St Hilary, Cornwall|St Hilary]] in [[Cornwall]] and [[Glamorgan]] and that of [[Llanilar]] in [[Ceredigion]] bear his name.

In France most [[Saint-Hilaire (disambiguation)|dedications to Saint Hilary]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; are styled "Saint-Hilaire" and lie west (and north) of the [[Massif Central]]; the cult in this region eventually extended to [[Canada]].

In northwest [[Italy]] the church of Sant’Ilario at [[Casale Monferrato]] was dedicated to St. Hilary as early as 380.

'''Ibrahim El Bakraoui''' ({{lang-ar| إبراهيم البكراوي}}; 9 October 1986&amp;nbsp;– 22 March 2016) was a [[Belgian nationality law|Belgian national]] of [[Morocco|Moroccan]] descent, confirmed to be one of the suicide bombers at the [[Brussels Airport]] in the [[2016 Brussels bombings]].

==Personal background==
El Bakraoui was born on 9 October 1986 in Brussels and raised in [[Laken]], a residential district in northwestern Brussels.&lt;ref name="NYTBrothers"/&gt; He held dual [[Belgian nationality law|Belgian]] and [[Morocco|Moroccan]] nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-suspect-in-brussels-attacks-is-sought-20160323-story.html|title=Brussels suicide bombers fit familiar profile; links to Paris terrorist attacks seen|website=Los Angeles Times|date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, a retired butcher and devout Muslim, [[Moroccan diaspora|emigrated from Morocco]]; his mother was described as "conservative and reclusive".&lt;ref name="NYTBrothers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/world/europe/expanding-portraits-of-brussels-bombers-ibrahim-and-khalid-el-bakraoui.html|title=Ibrahim and Khalid el-Bakraoui: From Bank Robbers to Brussels Bombers|website=The New York Times|date=24 March 2016|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother [[Khalid El Bakraoui|Khalid]] has been identified as the suicide bomber at [[Maalbeek/Maelbeek metro station|Maalbeek metro station]] in [[Brussels]] on 22 March 2016.&lt;ref name="CNN2403"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brothers ID'd as suicide bombers in Belgium, 1 suspect 'on the run'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/23/europe/brussels-investigation/|website=CNN|date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, he was involved in the attempted robbery of a [[Bureau de change|currency exchange]] office, where he shot at police with a [[Kalashnikov rifle]] while providing a lookout for his accomplices. One police officer was shot in the leg but survived.&lt;ref name="NYTBrothers" /&gt; The Mayor of Brussels, [[Freddy Thielemans]], and the Mayor of [[Sint-Jans-Molenbeek]], [[Philippe Moureaux]], described the shooting as a "''fait divers''" (a small daily news item) and "normal in a large city", causing controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/957/Binnenland/article/detail/1061949/2010/02/02/Schietpartij-in-Anderlecht-was-fait-divers.dhtml|title=Schietpartij in Anderlecht was fait divers|date=2 February 2010|accessdate=23 March 2016|publisher=Het Laatste Nieuws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2010, Ibrahim was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but was released on parole in 2014 under the condition that he did not leave the country for longer than a month. Following his release from prison, he collected €25,000 in Belgian government benefits until December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Terrorist Suspects in Europe Got Welfare Benefits While Plotting Attacks|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/terrorist-suspects-in-europe-got-welfare-benefits-while-plotting-attacks-1470350251|accessdate=5 August 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal|quote=Bakraoui was given jobless benefits in early 2014, after a stint in prison for armed robbery and carjacking. In total, he collected about €25,000 in unemployment, medical and other benefits, according to one of the people familiar with the case. He wasn’t shut off until last December, when Belgian authorities issued a warrant for him in connection with the Paris attacks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He failed to abide by the conditions of parole and was sought again by the authorities.&lt;ref name="NYTBrothers" /&gt;

==Manhunt and terrorist activities==
According to the authorities in [[Turkey]], they arrested Ibrahim as a "suspected terrorist" in June 2015 and deported him to Europe, where he chose to go to the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jim Brunsden|author2=Mehul Srivastava|title=Belgium admits mishandling Turkish terror warnings|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/65c89c22-f1cb-11e5-aff5-19b4e253664a.html#axzz44T0GPE7a|accessdate=31 March 2016|website=Financial Times|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgian authorities were informed of the detention and deportation, but they apparently ignored the warnings, and the Netherlands released Ibrahim after failing to establish any link to terrorism.&lt;ref name="LawlerBoyle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/12201611/Brussels-bombings-terrorist-attack-on-Belgium-airport-and-Metro-live.html|title=Brussels attacks: suicide bomber was known militant deported from Turkey to Europe, president says - live|website=The Daily Telegraph|date=22 March 2016|accessdate=22 March 2016|author=David Lawler|author2=Danny Boyle|author3=James Rothwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomkiw" /&gt;

Ibrahim and his brother Khalid were known to the Belgian authorities. Unlike other radicalised ISIL adherents, who started as petty criminals, the men had a history of committing more serious crimes.&lt;ref name="NYTBrothers" /&gt; They were believed to have rented an apartment that housed some of the assailants involved in the November 2015 Paris attacks and supplied ammunition for them.&lt;ref name="Tomkiw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/who-are-khalid-ibrahim-el-bakraoui-brothers-identified-suicide-bombers-brussels-2341733|title=Who Are Khalid And Ibrahim el-Bakraoui?

On 15 March 2016, Ibrahim and his brother Khalid evaded capture during [[2016 Brussels police raids|a police raid in Brussels]].&lt;ref name="Jamieson1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brussels-attacks/brussels-attacks-el-bakraoui-brothers-were-jailed-carjackings-shootout-n544241|title=Brussels Attacks: El Bakraoui Brothers Were Jailed for Carjackings, Shootout|website=NBC News|date=23 March 2016|accessdate=23 March 2016|author=Alastair Jamieson|author2=Annick M'Kele}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March 2016, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) in the United States sent information about them to authorities in the [[Netherlands]]. They had been tracking Ibrahim since September 2015.&lt;ref name=RT01&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/337653-fbi-brussels-attacks-netherlands/|title=FBI warned Dutch about dangers of Brussels bombers almost a week before attacks|website=Russia Today|date=29 March 2016|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities found a laptop belonging to Ibrahim inside a [[waste container]] near a house raided following the bombings.&lt;ref name="Jamieson1"/&gt; The laptop had a [[suicide note]] stored on it, in which Ibrahim stated that he was "stressed out", felt unsafe, and was "afraid of ever-lasting eternity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zelfmoordenaar laat laptop met testament achter in vuilnisbak|url=http://www.demorgen.be/binnenland/zelfmoordenaar-laat-laptop-met-testament-achter-in-vuilnisbak-b43ab635/|website=De Morgen|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contained images of the home and the office of the [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Belgian Prime Minister]], [[Charles Michel]], among information on multiple other locations in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2016-03-30/belgium-premiers-residence-office-found-on-bombers-laptop|title=A Belgian official says laptop used by one of the Brussels bombers contained images of the Belgian prime minister's home and office, heightening fears after last week's attacks on the airport and subway system|publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report|agency=Associated Press|date=30 March 2016|accessdate=1 April 2016|author=Raf Casert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Issan Dorsey''' (March 7, 1933 — September 6, 1990), born '''Tommy Dorsey, Jr.''', was a  [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] monk and teacher, Dharma heir of [[Zentatsu Richard Baker]] and onetime abbot of [[Hartford Street Zen Center]] (HSZC) located in the [[Castro district]] of [[San Francisco, California]]. Earlier in his life he had worked as a prostitute and a [[drag queen]], and had struggled at times  with drug addiction. He died of complications from [[AIDS]] in 1990.

He established the Maitri Hospice at HSZC for students and friends dying of AIDS during the spread of the epidemic in the 1980s—the first [[Buddhist]] [[hospice]] of its kind in the [[United States]]. Numbers of his students and colleagues have observed that Dorsey was the embodiment of a [[bodhisattva]].&lt;ref name="whitney"&gt;{{cite web| last =Whitney| first =Kobai Scott| authorlink =| title =The Lone Mountain Path: The Example of Issan Dorsey| work =| publisher =Shambhala Sun| date =March 1998| url =http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1980| format =| doi =| accessdate = 2008-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Hartford Street Zen Center.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Hartford Street Zen Center]]]]
Issan Dorsey was born as Tommy Dorsey, Jr. in [[Santa Barbara, California]] in 1933.&lt;ref name="comstock"&gt;{{cite book| last =Comstock| first =Gary| authorlink =|author2=Susan E.

While in [[junior college]] he became dissatisfied with his life, so he left school and joined the [[U.S. Navy]]. In the military he was able to fulfill his childhood dream of being an entertainer, putting on shows at his base and on [[television]] shows. During the [[Korean War]] Dorsey and a male lover were expelled from the Navy, leaving him to spend several years in and out of employment. He finally settled into a job as a [[waiter]] for a [[bar (establishment)|bar]] in [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]], eventually becoming a performer there as a [[drag queen]]. His shows were a success and he traveled in a road show known as The Party of Four. On the road in the 1950s he would sometimes work as a [[prostitute]] at shows and afterhours, developing a nasty [[methamphetamine]] addiction during this period.&lt;ref name="comstock"/&gt; On the road during his shows Dorsey was introduced as, "Tommy Dee, the boy who looks like the girl next door."&lt;ref name="whitney"/&gt;

In the 1960s he returned to [[San Francisco]], where he continued to shoot speed and engaged in dealing drugs on lower [[Haight Street]]. He founded his own [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]] and also managed a [[rock band]].&lt;ref name="comstock"/&gt; During this period he had a spiritual experience under the influence of [[LSD]] while observing a photograph of Ramana [[Maharshi]]. He constructed an [[altar]] with Maharshi's photograph, where he would shoot speed and gaze at the picture for several hours. Soon, he gave up using drugs and started sitting [[zazen]] at the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] (SFZC) under the guidance of [[Shunryu Suzuki]].&lt;ref name="butler"&gt;{{cite book| last =Butler| first =Katy| authorlink =| title =Street Zen (book review)| publisher =Whole Earth Review| date =Spring 1994| location =| pages =| url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1510/is_n82/ai_15297800| doi =| id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 (while Dorsey was director of SFZC) he became a member of The Gay Buddhist Club, which eventually became known as the [[Hartford Street Zen Center]] (HSZC).&lt;ref name="coleman"&gt;{{cite book| last =Coleman| first =James William| authorlink =| title =The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition| publisher =Oxford University Press| year =2001| location =| pages =165| url =http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48932003&amp;referer=one_hit| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-19-515241-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a discussion group for [[gay]] Buddhists, the group eventually began sitting [[zazen]] in the basement of one member's house at 57 Hartford Street. In 1987&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://hszc.org/about/history-of-hszc/ History of HSZC]&lt;/ref&gt; Dorsey had created a [[hospice]] (Maitri Hospice) within the Zen center on Hartford Street, serving primarily gay men who were dying of [[AIDS]]. Eventually Dorsey was made a [[Sōtō]] priest by his teacher—[[Zentatsu Richard Baker]]—installed as abbot of HSZC in 1989 and given the [[Dharma name]] Issan (meaning "One-Mountain").&lt;ref name="comstock"/&gt; Shortly before death, in particularly poor health, Issan was recognized as a [[Rōshi|roshi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Halifax, Joan| first =| authorlink =Joan Halifax| title =Buddhism in America: Volume 1 (Audio)| publisher =[[Sounds True]]| year =2000| location =| pages =| url =http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46867277&amp;referer=one_hit| doi =| id = | isbn = 1-56455-816-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, 1990, Issan Dorsey died of complications linked to [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

'''Félix Marie Henri Tilkin'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Gänzl|first = Kurt|contribution=Ivan Caryll|year=2001 |title=The Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre, Second Edition |pages = 327 |publisher = Schirmer Books |isbn = 0-02-864970-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (12 May 1861 &amp;ndash; 29 November 1921), better known by his pen name '''Ivan Caryll''', was a Belgian composer of [[operetta]]s and [[Edwardian musical comedies]] in the English language.  He composed (or contributed to) some forty [[Edwardian musical comedies|musical comedies]] and [[operettas]].

Caryll's career encompassed three eras of the musical theatre, and unlike some of his contemporaries, he adapted readily to each new development.  After composing a few [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesques]], his first great successes were made in light musical comedies, epitomised by the [[George Edwardes]] productions at London's [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], such as ''[[The Shop Girl]]'', ''[[The Circus Girl]]'', ''[[The Gay Parisienne]]'', and ''[[A Runaway Girl]]''.  He continued to write musical comedies throughout the next decade, including such hits as ''[[The Messenger Boy]]'', ''[[The Toreador]]'', ''[[The Girl From Kays]]'', ''[[The Earl and the Girl]]'', ''[[The Orchid]]'', ''[[The Spring Chicken]]'', ''[[The Girls of Gottenberg]]'' and ''[[Our Miss Gibbs]]''.  He also wrote some [[operetta]] scores, such as ''[[The Duchess of Dantzic]]''.  After this, he moved to New York City, where his post-war works, incorporating new [[fox-trot]] and [[one-step]] rhythms, included ''[[The Girl Behind the Gun]]'' (later a London hit as ''[[Kissing Time]]'').  At the peak of his career, he had the unparalleled distinction of having five musicals running at the same time in the [[West End theatre|West End]].

==Life and career==
Caryll was born in [[Liège]], Belgium, the son of Henry Tilkin, an engineer.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Gänzl, Kurt, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/62430 "Caryll, Ivan (1861–1921)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 12 January 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the [[Royal Conservatory of Liège|Liège Conservatoire]], where he was a fellow student of [[Eugène Ysaÿe]]. He then moved to France to study singing at the [[Paris Conservatoire]], where a classmate was [[Rose Caron]].&lt;ref name=chat&gt;"A Chat with Mr. Ivan Caryll", ''Musical Opinion and Music Trade Review'', August 1897,  p. 756&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to London in 1882.  He was married for a time in the 1890s to [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] star [[Geraldine Ulmar]].  Later, he married Maud Hill.  He had a daughter named Primrose Caryll, who became an actress.

The dashing, moustachioed Caryll was known as one of the best dressed men in London.  He was an extravagant spender and a popular and lavish host, entertaining his theatrical friends in princely style.  Caryll's free spending ways caused him trouble occasionally, and he had a few narrow escapes from his creditors.&lt;ref name=Archive&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_savoy/lucky_star/caryll.html "Ivan Caryll"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906071846/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_savoy/lucky_star/caryll.html |date=2006-09-06 }} at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive's British Musical Theatre pages, 24 December 2003, accessed 11 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[File:Rice's production of the latest London novelty, The girl from Paris written by George Dance ; music by Ivan Caryll. LCCN2014636229.jpg|left|thumb|1897 Poster for ''[[The Gay Parisienne|The Girl from Paris]]'']]
At first, Caryll earned a poor living by giving music lessons to women in the suburbs.&lt;ref name=chat/&gt; Then he sold some songs to [[George Edwardes]], who eventually hired him as the musical director for the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]] and [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric]] Theatres.  He attempted to raise orchestral standards by banning the deputy system, under which a player who was offered a lucrative engagement could send a substitute to perform in the theatre.&lt;ref name=chat/&gt;

Caryll's first theatre piece was ''Lily of Léoville'' in 1886. He sent the score to [[Camille Saint-Saëns]], who used his influence to have it staged at the [[Théâtre des Bouffes Parisiens|Bouffes Parisiens]].&lt;ref name=chat/&gt; [[Violet Melnotte]] secured the English rights, and it was presented in London featuring a young [[Hayden Coffin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_l/lilyleoville.htm Lily of Leoville] at the Guide to Musical Theatre, accessed 29 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed the same year by ''[[Monte Cristo Jr.]]'', a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] for the Gaiety and then by a number of shows produced for the Lyric, culminating with the very successful ''[[Little Christopher Columbus]]'' (1893).  Caryll, known as a very expressive conductor, conducted [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Alfred Cellier]]'s ''[[The Mountebanks (opera)|The Mountebanks]]'' at the Lyric in 1892. Cellier died during rehearsals for the piece, and Caryll wrote the overture, the entr'acte, and finished some of the orchestration. His work on the piece received critical praise.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Raymond J. [http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2018/May/Cellier_mountebanks_2CDLX7349.htm "Alfred Cellier (1844-1891): ''The Mountebanks'', comic opera (1892); and ''Suite Symphonique'' (1878)"], Music Web International, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1892, with [[George Dance (dramatist)|George Dance]], Caryll adapted an [[opéra comique]] called ''[[Ma mie Rosette]]'', based on a French piece by [[Paul Lacôme]], starring [[Jessie Bond]] and [[Courtice Pounds]] at the Globe Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Simon.  [http://www.c20th.com/GSarchiveother.htm Programmes and descriptions of 1892 productions of ''Ma mie Rosette'',] ''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, a selling exhibition of memorabilia, Archive: Other items''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Theatres", ''The Times'', 27 December 1892, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Caryll recalled of this production that he had been much criticised for adding numbers to Lacome's original score, although Lacome had specially requested him to do so.&lt;ref name=chat/&gt;

Caryll's first big success at the Gaiety was ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894), which ran for an almost unprecedented 546 performances and heralded a new form of respectable musical comedy in London. The composer conducted the piece himself.  Meanwhile, Caryll also had success elsewhere.  ''[[The Gay Parisienne]]'' (1896), written with George Dance, ran for 369 performances at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]], played in New York as ''The Girl from Paris'' (281 performances) and toured internationally.  At the same time, he continued to compose shows at other theatres, including the [[comic opera]] ''[[Dandy Dick Whittington]]'' (1895), at the [[Avenue Theatre]], with a libretto by [[George Robert Sims]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, William Davenport. ''A Dictionary of the Drama: a Guide to the Plays, Playwrights'', Vol. 1, pp. 374–75, Chatto &amp; Windus, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cover of the Vocal Score of Seymour Hicks' The Earl and the Girl.jpg|thumb|Cover of Vocal Score]]
[[File:Pinklady1.jpg|thumb|Programme for [[The Pink Lady (musical)|''The Pink Lady'']]]]
Caryll composed the music for almost all the Gaiety musical comedies over the next decade, in collaboration with [[Lionel Monckton]], and also established himself as the most famous conductor of light music in England.  Edwardes apparently liked to have the word 'girl' in the titles of the shows, so ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' was followed by ''My Girl'', ''[[The Circus Girl]]'' (with over 500 performances in 1896 and 1897) and ''[[A Runaway Girl]]'' (1898).  ''[[The Lucky Star]]'' was a less successful three-act [[comic opera]] (1899, produced by the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]], based on ''L'Etoile'', an opéra-bouffe by [[Emmanuel Chabrier]]). It may have been too risqué for the [[Savoy Theatre]] audiences.

Caryll was said to compose very quickly in intense bouts. His scores were noted for swirling waltzes and semi-[[opera]]tic finales. He often took trips to Paris and elsewhere in search of new musical plays that he could adapt into English. Caryll's output also included songs, dances and salon pieces for his own light orchestra, for which [[Edward Elgar]] composed his shapely ''Serenade Lyrique'' in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/garlands/97.htm Profile of Caryll from Musicweb International]&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century London pieces===
After the turn of the century, Caryll wrote more successful scores, including ''[[The Messenger Boy]]'' (1900), ''[[The Toreador]]'' (1901) (with well over 600 performances), The Ladies' Paradise (1901) (the first musical comedy to be presented at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York),&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Lamb, Andrew]], [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/05053 "Caryll, Ivan",] ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 12 January 2011 {{subscription}}; the piece closed quickly and controversially there, with the cast unpaid.  See: [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/09/29/106920075.pdf "''The Ladies' Paradise'' Ends"].  ''The New York TImes'', 29 September 1901&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Girl From Kays]]'' (1902), ''[[The Cherry Girl]]'' (1902), ''[[The Earl and the Girl]]'' (1903; another success, starring [[Walter Passmore]] and [[Henry Lytton]]), ''[[The Orchid]]'' (1903), and ''[[The Duchess of Dantzic]]'' (1903), a [[comic opera]] based on the story of Napoleon and Madame Sans-Gêne, the washerwoman who married Marshal Lefebvre and became a duchess.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_d/duchess_of_dantzic.htm Information from the Guide to Musical Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; During the Christmas season of 1903, he had what was at that time the unparalleled distinction of having five musicals running at the same time in the [[West End theatre|West End]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Despite these successes, Caryll began to grow jealous of Monckton, who often wrote the most popular numbers in the shows.&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt;  Still, they continued to work together, producing several successes: ''[[The Spring Chicken]]'' (1905), ''[[The New Aladdin]]'' (1906), ''[[The Girls of Gottenberg]]'' (1907), and the even more popular ''[[Our Miss Gibbs]]'' (1909), which ran for 636 performances.  Typical of the plots of these shows, ''Our Miss Gibbs'' concerns a shop girl, courted by an earl in disguise.  During this period, Caryll also wrote the less successful ''The Little Cherub'' (1906).

Many of Caryll's musicals were given in Paris, Vienna, and Budapest at a time when the English-language musicals were largely ignored on the continent, and he composed original scores for Paris (''S.A.R.'', or ''Son altesse royale'', 1908) and Vienna (''Die Reise nach Cuba'', 1901).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Broadway musicals===
Caryll relocated to New York City in 1911, composing more than a dozen [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musicals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicals101.com/who2.htm#Caryll Brief profile of Caryll at the musicals101 website]&lt;/ref&gt; including [[The Pink Lady (musical)|''The Pink Lady'']] (1911, with Hugh Morton), ''Oh! Oh! Delphine!!!'' (1912), ''Chin-Chin'' (1914; including "[[Ragtime]] Temple Bells"),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/chinchinmusicalf00caryl Vocal score of ''Chin-Chin'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/26286 Temple Bells sheet music]. The Lester S. Levy Collection of Sheet Music, accessed 2 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jack o'Lantern'' (1917), and ''[[The Girl Behind the Gun]]'' (1918, with a book by [[P. G. Wodehouse]] and [[Guy Bolton]]; the following year, it was a hit in London as ''[[Kissing Time]]''). According to Wodehouse, Caryll was widely known as "Fabulous Felix", and "lived ''en prince'' ... having apartments in both London and Paris as well as a villa containing five bathrooms overlooking the [[Deauville]] racecourse."&lt;ref&gt;Wodehouse, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  He had just completed the music for ''Little Miss Raffles'' a day before his death.

Caryll died of a haemorrhage in New York at age 60 while rehearsing ''Little Miss Raffles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Ivan Caryll Dies as he Finishes Play|date=30 November 1921 |work=[[New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1921/11/30/archives/ivan-caryll-dies-as-he-finishes-play-noted-composer-stricken-with.html|page=14|accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruderman was born on March 16, 1966. He is the oldest of three siblings, the son of Marcia and Morton E. Ruderman. The latter cofounded  [[Meditech]] and other successful business ventures, dedicating his later life to helping others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Negri | first=Gloria | title=Morton Ruderman, 75; devoted life to helping others | website=BostonGlobe.com | date=2011-10-31 | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/obituaries/2011/10/31/morton-ruderman-devoted-life-helping-others/rL8YpiDtdYBG1iWAWLgpwI/story.html | access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruderman attended public schools in [[Lynnfield, Massachusetts]], and received his undergraduate degree from [[Brandeis University]], where he served as president of the student body in 1986-87. He earned his [[Juris Doctor|JD]] from [[Boston University School of Law]] in 1993. He served in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] as Liaison with the Jewish Diaspora.

He later worked for the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] (AIPAC), first as Deputy Director of the [[New England]] office and then as Leadership Director of the [[Jerusalem]] office.

=== Ruderman Family Foundation ===
Ruderman has been President of the [[Ruderman Family Foundation]] since 2008.

==Activist philanthropy==
Ruderman grew the Ruderman Family Foundation from a local foundation serving the Boston Jewish community to one with an international focus. Under his leadership the Foundation seeks to change societal attitudes around disability and to advocate for the rights of people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/claudia-jacobs/foundations-should-take-a_b_3670683.html "Foundations Should Take a Look at the Largest Poverty Minority. Think Inclusively, Act Inclusively"], The Huffington Post, [http://www.grantcraft.org/videos/60-seconds-with-jay-ruderman "60 Seconds with Jay Ruderman: The real measure of impact]&lt;/ref&gt; The philanthropic strategy of the Foundation is to go narrow and deep: it focuses on a limited number of issues and works with the media to raise awareness of those issues across all sectors of society. These issues center around changing societal attitudes so that disability inclusion is seen as central to civil rights and social justice, and not an issue of charity.

The Ruderman Family Foundation, led by Jay Ruderman, is an international leader in the intersection between social advocacy, disabilities, and inclusion. Part of its advocacy involves publishing white papers on different topics related to disabilities and inclusion.

With the foundation as his vehicle, Jay Ruderman has established himself as one of the leading voices for disability rights on social media. Ruderman has used social media in past years to respond to derogatory language used by public figures toward people with disabilities.  Examples of derogatory language to which Ruderman responded include the video showing the rapper [[50 Cent]] mocking a disabled airport employee, and the rude gestures made by President [[Donald Trump]] mimicking the disability of ''New York Times'' reporter Serge Kovaleski.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/blogs/new-normal/join-us-toward-inclusion-perspectives-disability-social-responsibility-and-belongin|title=Join Us: "Toward Inclusion: Perspectives on Disability, Social Responsibility, and Belonging"|date=2016-03-31|website=The Jewish Week {{!}} Connecting The World To Jewish News, Culture &amp; Opinion|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The response to the Donald Trump episode led to the Foundation being featured during the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]].

On a daily basis Ruderman engages in rapid response activism, much of which is done through numerous op-eds he has written for major publications in the US and Israel. Recently, the Foundation launched the Ruderman Family Awards for Excellence in Reporting on Disability at the [[Walter Cronkite School of Journalism]] at Arizona State University. The prize seeks to encourage excellent reporting on disability, by recognizing the best disability reporting produced each year by media organizations around the world.

Ruderman has also put together several signature programs as part of his activist philanthropy. Among them is the Ruderman Prize in Inclusion, which recognizes organizations around the world that serve as exemplars of disability inclusion. Twenty Ruderman Prizes have been awarded since 2012.

In 2017, the Foundation hosted its second Ruderman Inclusion Summit, which was one of the world's largest gathering of disability activists with over 1,400 people in attendance. The first such summit was held two years before that, in November 2015 in Boston, with 500 leaders and activists. Plenary speakers at both summits included Oscar Award Winner [[Marlee Matlin]], Former President of Malawi [[Joyce Banda]], former Senator [[Tom Harkin]] (D-Iowa), author [[Ron Suskind]], Special Olympian [[Loretta Claiborne]], Michigan State Supreme Court Justice Richard H. Bernstein, journalist and NPR host [[John Hockenberry]], Senator [[Maggie Hassan]] (D–NH), Congressman [[Gregg Harper]] (R-MS), and Congressman [[Jim Langevin]] (D–RI).
 
Ruderman has also launched Link20, a leadership network for young disability advocates aiming to develop a young cross-disability movement through strengthening the leadership of the participants and helping them raise awareness and shatter stereotypes about people with disabilities. The network began in Israel and has spread to Boston, New York, and Washington DC.

An additional signature program is the Morton E. Ruderman Award in Inclusion, which has been given annually since 2013 to an individual for outstanding accomplishment in the field of disability inclusion. In 2013 the award was given to Michael Stein, co-founder and Executive Director of the Harvard Law School Project on Disability. In 2014 it was given to Ari Ne’eman, President and co-founder of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. In 2015, the recipient was Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa, retired), a writer of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]]. The latest recipient was Oscar winning actress, Marlee Matlin.

The Foundation created the ADVANCE Conference series in 2011, 2012, and 2013 to educate the Jewish funding community about the issue of disability inclusion. As a result of those meetings the Disability Peer Network was founded at the Jewish Funders Network by the Foundation and others.

In addition to its activity surrounding people with disabilities, the Foundation led by Jay Ruderman also focuses on Israel-American Jewish relations and maintains major partnerships with the Government of Israel and many national Jewish organizations in the U.S. and Israel.

In November 2015, the Foundation organized a series of high-level events in Israel, focusing on the relationship between Israel and the American Jewish community. These included the Conference on Israel-American Jewish Relations, with speeches by former Israeli President and Nobel Peace Laureate [[Shimon Peres]], former U.S. Senator [[Joseph Lieberman]] (D-Connecticut), and U.S. Ambassador [[Daniel B. Shapiro]]; a public meeting of the [[Knesset]] Caucus on Israel-U.S. Relations; and the formal opening of the third year of [[University of Haifa|Haifa University]]'s Ruderman Program in American Jewish Studies.

The Foundation has also brought delegations of members of Israel's Knesset to the United States to expose them to the diversity of the U.S. Jewish community in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2017. This program was instrumental in establishing the Knesset Caucus on Israel-U.S. Relations.

In 2013, with funding from the Foundation, Haifa University launched the Ruderman Program in American Jewish Studies, the only degree-granting program of its kind in Israel.

The Foundation also releases white papers on the topic of the US-Israel relationship, including one entitled ''The Jewish Vote: Political Power and Identity in US Elections''.

Jay has also called for a more democratic, representative and inclusive Jewish community, as shown in an op-ed for [http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/time-for-a-change-how-our-major-jewish-organizations-can-better-represent-the-diversity-of-our-american-jewish-community/ The Times of Israel].

==Hollywood activism==
Over the years, an important part of Ruderman's activism has focused on Hollywood and the film industry, particularly its representation of people with disabilities and lack of inclusion of disabled actors in leading roles. Ruderman has publicly criticized [[Hollywood]] productions, and this has earned him much media coverage.

Most recently, Ruderman publicly criticized the movie ''[[Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot]]'' for casting [[Joaquin Phoenix]] in the role of a disabled man, instead of casting an actor with a disability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiewire.com/2018/01/joaquin-phoenix-casting-dont-worry-he-wont-get-far-on-foot-ruderman-disability-foundation-1201918359/ "Joaquin Phoenix’s ‘Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot’ Casting Slammed as Offensive by Ruderman Disability Foundation"] ''IndieWire''. Retrieved 2018-03-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Ruderman similarly condemned&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/alec-baldwin-criticized-for-portraying-blind-man-in-new-film-w491281|title=Alec Baldwin Criticized for Portraying Blind Man in Upcoming Film|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the movie [[Blind (2016 film)|Blind]] starring [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Demi Moore]] on grounds that Baldwin played a blind character. Ruderman's main claim is that the movie "is just the latest example of treating disability as a costume."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/blind-alec-baldwin-controversy-1202488128/|title=Disability Organization Slams ‘Blind’ for Casting Alec Baldwin in Lead Role|last=Rubin|first=Rebecca|date=2017-07-06|work=Variety|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-disability-organization-condemns-1499273816-htmlstory.html|title=Today in Entertainment: Blue Ivy makes her rap debut on Jay-Z's new album; Angela Lansbury, Emily Watson to star in 'Little Women'|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; He likened the casting of able-bodied actors to portray characters with disabilities to blackface&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/06/how-alec-baldwin-casting-in-blind-is-part-of-a-catch-22-for-disabled-actors|title=How Alec Baldwin's casting in Blind is part of a catch-22 for disabled actors|last=Ellis-Petersen|first=Hannah|date=2017-07-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; and states that it's time for society to condemn the practice just like casting white actors to play black characters is no longer socially acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/07/alec-baldwin-new-movie-blind-disability-rights-ableism-1201851800/|title=Alec Baldwin’s New Movie ‘Blind’ Criticized By Disability Rights Group {{!}} IndieWire|last=Dry|first=Jude|website=www.indiewire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident led to written exchanges between the movie's director, [[Michael Mailer]], and Ruderman, both published by the industry publication Deadline.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/07/blind-alec-baldwin-backlash-director-responds-michael-mailer-1202129011/|title=‘Blind’ Director Addresses Backlash Over Casting Alec Baldwin And Not Disabled Actor In Lead Role|last=Mailer|first=Michael|date=2017-07-14|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-07-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/07/blind-movie-controversy-alec-baldwin-ruderman-foundation-responds-guest-column-1202130794/|title=‘Blind’ Movie: Ruderman Foundation Responds To Director Over Alec Baldwin Casting Flap|last=Ruderman|first=Jay|date=2017-07-18|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-07-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the release of the 2016 film [[Me Before You (film)|Me Before You]], Ruderman condemned the film's widely criticized portrayal of disability, in which the protagonist{{ndash}}who is paralyzed{{ndash}}ends up committing suicide because he feels his life is not worth living. Ruderman was widely quoted as stating, "To the millions of people with significant disabilities currently leading fulfilling, rich lives, it posits that they are better off committing suicide."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/05/me-before-you-ending-director-responds|title='Me Before You' director responds to controversy over film's ending|access-date=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com.au/celebrity/celebrity-gossip/2016/6/me-before-you-movie-ending/|title=The director of Me Before You is #sorrynotsorry about its controversial ending|access-date=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruderman's second major point in this controversy was that it is problematic for an able-bodied actor to play a character with a disabilitiy, a topic he often speaks up about.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-woodburn-ruderman-disability-stats-tv-20160711-snap-story.html|title=Why are we OK with disability drag in Hollywood?|date=2016-07-11|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In addition to commenting on movie productions, Ruderman has also released two white papers focusing on television content and people with disabilities.

The Ruderman Family Foundation was awarded the 2017 [[SAG-AFTRA]] Disability Awareness Award for its work in fighting for self-representation of people with disabilities on screen.

'''Helen Mary''' "'''Jenny'''" '''Boyd''' (born 8 November 1947) is a former English model. She quit her modelling career in the 1960s after discovering [[Transcendental Meditation]], and she soon considered modelling a "waste of her time." She later became a clinical consultant and author. She is the younger sister of 1960s model and photographer, [[Pattie Boyd]] (first wife of Beatles' lead guitarist [[George Harrison]] and blues guitar legend [[Eric Clapton]]) and the older sister of Paula Boyd.

==Early life and career==
She was born as Helen Mary Boyd in [[Guildford, Surrey]], England in November 1947 to Diana Frances Boyd and Colin Ian Langdon Boyd.

She was a freelance model in the 1960s, and often accompanied her sister Pattie to modelling jobs.

She attended [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in the late 1980s, earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[psychology]], and became a clinical consultant and author. She co-authored a book about music and psychology, titled ''Musicians in Tune''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Musicians in tune : seventy-five contemporary musicians discuss the creative process | last = Boyd | first = Jenny |author2=Holly George-Warren | location = New York | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-671-73440-7 | oclc=25984281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Despite Boyd being the inspiration of British folk musician [[Donovan]]'s song "[[Jennifer Juniper]]", they were never in a relationship, though Donovan admitted having a crush on her.&lt;ref name="Donovan_autobio"&gt;{{cite book | last=Leitch | first=Donovan | title=The Autobiography of Donovan: The Hurdy Gurdy Man | publisher=St. Martin's Press | isbn=0312352522 | pages=201–202 | date=November 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was released as a single in March 1968 and on the album ''[[The Hurdy Gurdy Man]]'' later that year. Also in 1968, Boyd travelled with Donovan and her sister, Pattie Boyd, to [[Rishikesh]], India, to attend a training session in [[Transcendental Meditation]] held by [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].&lt;ref name="Donovan_autobio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Beatles, the Maharishi and me|first=Cynthia|last=Lennon|work=Sunday Times|location=London (UK)|date=10 February 2008|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Jenny shared an apartment with [[Magic Alex]] of [[Apple Corps]]'s [[Apple Electronics]] subdivision. She also worked at the [[Apple Boutique]] in London.{{source?|date=November 2018}}

Boyd was fifteen when she met drummer [[Mick Fleetwood]], who, at the time, was in a band called [[The Bo Street Runners]] and would later co-found [[Fleetwood Mac]]. From thereon, they began an on-and-off relationship that would last fifteen years. They eventually married in June 1970 and they had two daughters, Lucy and Amy. After divorcing Fleetwood (and remarrying and divorcing him a second time),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=d3hLAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=mick+fleetwood+jenny+remarried+1976&amp;dq=mick+fleetwood+jenny+remarried+1976&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y99IUbPTMMm1PdesgLAB&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Musicians in Tune|author=Jenny Boyd, Holly George-Warren |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|date= 1 May 1992 |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd married drummer [[Ian Wallace (drummer)|Ian Wallace]] in 1984 but they later divorced.{{source?|date=November 2018}}

Her first appearance in ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'' was in the 2013 episode "Bailout", in which she portrayed Mona-Lisa Saperstein. Following her success on the NBC show, Slate released and starred in a 12 episode mini-series on YouTube called ''Catherine'', celebrating late 1980' and early 1990s soap opera aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2940332/|title=Catherine|date=May 19, 2013|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 23, 2013, she appeared in ''[[Drunk History]]'' retelling the history of how [[Coca-Cola]] was made.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
[[File:Jerry Moran, 109th Congress, official portrait.jpg|thumb|Moran's [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]] portrait]]

=== Elections ===
Moran was elected to Congress in 1996 and reelected five times, never facing serious opposition in the conservative 1st district. In 2006, his [[United States House elections, 2006 complete list#Kansas|opponent for the 2006 midterm election]] was [[John Doll (Kansas politician)|John Doll]], against whom he received almost 79 percent of the vote—one of the highest totals for a Republican congressional incumbent in that election.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/house/ |title=CNN 2006 Election Totals |publisher=cnn.com|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tenure ===
During his time in the House of Representatives, Jerry Moran conducted an annual town hall meeting in each of the 69 counties in Kansas' "Big First" Congressional District. He continues the tradition in the U.S. Senate for all 105 counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moran invites Kansans to join him during annual listening tour |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2190795451.html |work=U.S. News Service|publisher=High Beam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a senior member of the House Agriculture Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, then-Congressman Moran worked with colleagues to craft legislation to aid Kansas farms and ranches. Moran was also an active member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, where he served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Senate|first=Jerry Moran|title=Official Biography|url=https://moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/biography|work=Official Page|publisher=U.S. Senate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slate's David Weigel pointed out that, despite his insistence that earmarks are a way that get members of Congress to vote for spending "that we can't afford," Moran requested $19.4&amp;nbsp;million in earmarks in the 2010 budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weigel|first1=David|title=From Earmarker to Tea Partyer: The Ballad of Jerry Moran |publisher=Slate|date=27 January 2011 |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2011/01/27/from_earmarker_to_tea_partyer_the_ballad_of_jerry_moran.html|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. Senate ==

=== Elections ===
Moran became the 2010 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate election in Kansas, 2010|nominee for U.S. Senate in Kansas]] after defeating fellow Congressman [[Todd Tiahrt]] in the Republican primary, 50–45%.&lt;ref name="kansasfreepress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansasfreepress.com/2010/08/live-election-results-right-here-kansas-state-primaries.html|title=2010: Kansas Primary Election Results &amp;#124; Kansas Free Press|publisher=kansasfreepress.com|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the general election, Moran took 70 percent of the vote, defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Lisa Johnston, [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] Michael Dann, and [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] candidate Joe Bellis.&lt;ref name="kssos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kssos.org/elections/10elec/2010_General_Election_Results.pdf|date=29 November 2010|title= Kansas Secretary of State – 2010 General Election Official Vote Totals |accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NRSC Chairmanship ===
Moran was elected Chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] for the 113th U.S. Congress on November 14, 2012.&lt;ref name="nationaljournal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/blogs/hotlineoncall/2012/11/cornyn-elected-whip-moran-nrsc-chair-14|title=NationalJournal|publisher=nationaljournal.com|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moran oversaw the Republican gain of nine Senate seats in [[United States Senate elections, 2014]], resulting in the first Republican Senate majority since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/11/07/246199_kansas-sen-jerry-moran-savors.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political positions ==
Moran's voting record is highly conservative. He has a lifetime rating of 92 from the [[American Conservative Union]].

The ''Southwest Daily Times'' once quoted him as saying, "I will always put Kansans ahead of the pressures in Washington"—a quote he posted on his House Web site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090810005006/http://www.jerrymoran.house.gov/ Archive of Moran's House site from 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agriculture ===

=== Health care ===
Moran opposed the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare reform package of 2003]], unlike most congressmen from rural districts. He also opposed the [[Affordable Care Act]] of 2010, the health care reform bill championed by President Obama.

In May 2011, Moran sponsored S. 1058, the [[Pharmacy Competition and Consumer Choice Act of 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Sen. Moran Tours Topeka Hospital|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2011/jun/27/sen-jerry-moran-tours-topeka-hospital/|newspaper=Lawrence Journal World|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the House, he served as Co-Chairman of the House Rural Health Care Coalition and co-founder of the Congressional Community Pharmacy Coalition.&lt;ref name="senate2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/health-care|title=Health Care – Issues – United States Senator Jerry Moran|publisher=moran.senate.gov|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moran announced that he was voting 'no' on the July 2017 Senate health care bill. Moran criticized the closed-door process for developing the bill and criticized the legislation for not repealing the entire 2010 health law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/17/politics/health-care-motion-to-proceed-jerry-moran-mike-lee/index.html|title=Latest health care bill collapses|last=CNN|first=MJ Lee, Phil Mattingly and Ted Barrett,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Everett|first1=Burgess|title=Four Republicans block Obamacare repeal bill in Senate|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/17/obamacare-senators-turn-on-mcconnell-240646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National security and military ===

Since 2014, Moran has served on the [[United States Air Force Academy]] Board of Visitors.&lt;ref name="senate3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=9654a2f2-725b-484d-ac34-fb8162fa7efa|title=Sen. Moran Appointed to U.S. Air Force Academy Board of Visitors – News Releases – Newsroom – United States Senator Jerry Moran|publisher=moran.senate.gov|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, Moran opposed a timetable for military withdrawal from Iraq.

Since entering Congress, Moran has traveled to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan to visit deployed American forces and meet with foreign leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moran Visits Troops |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1429&amp;dat=20060202&amp;id=65xkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z4UNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3561,123827|accessdate=8 August 2012|newspaper=The Johnson Pioneer |date=February 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His most recent trip to the region was in August 2017 to the Northern regions of Afghanistan.

===Immigration and refugees===
Moran critiqued President [[Donald Trump]]'s 2017 [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] imposing a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, stating: "While I support thorough vetting, I do not support restricting the rights of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. Furthermore, far-reaching national security policy should always be devised in consultation with Congress and relevant government agencies."&lt;ref name="Blake1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/29/heres-where-republicans-stand-on-president-trumps-controversial-travel-ban/|title=Whip Count: Here's where Republicans stand on Trump's controversial travel ban|date=January 31, 2017|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Moran supports accountability metrics for public schools, but believes federal initiatives need to provide flexibility to states. In 2001, Moran voted against passage of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) because he felt it did not afford sufficient flexibility to schools.&lt;ref name="thekansan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekansan.com/features/x698066356/Moran-Stop-spending|title=Moran: &amp;#145;Stop spending|author=Cristina Janney|newspaper=The Kansan|access-date=2015-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318215006/http://www.thekansan.com/features/x698066356/Moran-Stop-spending|archive-date=2012-03-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, Moran voted to confirm [[Betsy DeVos]] as [[United States Secretary of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/02/07/us/politics/betsy-devos-confirmation-vote.html|title=How Senators Voted on Betsy DeVos|date=February 7, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hancock, [http://www2.ljworld.com/weblogs/capitol-report/2017/feb/2/sens-roberts-moran-unite-behind-devos-fo/ Sens. Roberts, Moran unite behind DeVos for education secretary despite widespread criticism], ''Lawrence Journal-World'' (February 2, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gun policy===
Moran has an "A" rating from the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) for his consistent support of pro-gun policies.&lt;ref name="VS1004G"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Voter's Self Defense System|url=https://votesmart.org/candidate/542/jerry-moran?categoryId=37|website=Vote Smart|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NRA endorsed him for his 2010 Senate run. He was described as a "steadfast supporter of our freedom," by NRA-Political Victory Fund chairman Chris W. Cox.&lt;ref name="NRAPVF1004"&gt;{{cite web|title=NRA-PVF Endorses Jerry Moran for U.S. Senate|url=https://www.nrapvf.org/articles/20100913/nra-pvf-endorses-jerry-moran-for-us-senate|website=NRA-PVF|accessdate=4 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1998, the NRA has donated $23,850 to Moran's political efforts.&lt;ref name="Kraske1040G"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kraske|first1=Steve|title=Who's the top recipient of NRA donations anywhere in the country?

In 2013, Moran joined other Republicans in saying they would [[filibuster]] any Democrat's proposals that Republican's considered a threat to the Second Amendment.&lt;ref name="Gendreau1004G"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gendreau|first1=LeAnne|title=Sandy Hook Victim's Daughter Calls Out Senators|url=http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Sandy-Hooks-Victims-Daughter-Calls-Out-Senators-202179811.html|website=NBC Connecticut|accessdate=4 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Moran voted against the Manchin-Toomey proposal for [[universal background check]]s for gun purchases.&lt;ref name="Willis1004G"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Willis|first1=Derek|title=Defeats Manchin-Toomey Background... – S.649: Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013|url=https://projects.propublica.org/represent/votes/113/senate/1/97|website=ProPublica|accessdate=4 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hancock1004G"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hancock|first1=Peter|title=Roberts, Moran vote against expanded background checks in gun sales {{!}} Statehouse Live / LJWorld.com|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/weblogs/capitol-report/2013/apr/18/roberts-moran-vote-against-expanded-back/|website=Lawrence Journal-World|accessdate=4 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moran supports the concept of eliminating gun-free zones on military installations and recruitment centers. He stated that they are an "infringement on the constitutional rights of our service members" and that gun-free zones make military sites "increasingly vulnerable to those who wish to do harm."&lt;ref name="Kraske1004G2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kraske|first1=Steve|title=TheChat: Sen. Jerry Moran takes aim at "gun-free zones" on military bases|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/the-buzz/article28244719.html|website=The Kansas City Star|accessdate=4 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Moran voted against the Feinstein Amendment, which would have banned suspected terrorists from acquiring guns.&lt;ref name="EB1004G"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Editorial Board|title=Pandering politicians fail again on gun control|url=http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article85116882.html|website=The Kansas City Star|accessdate=4 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moran responded to the [[2017 Olathe, Kansas shooting]] stating "I strongly condemn violence of any kind, especially if it is motivated by prejudice and xenophobia."&lt;ref name="Oroñdez1004G"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oroñdez|first1=Franco|title=Kansas shooting likely to test what Trump views as a hate crime|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article134858389.html|website=McClatchy|accessdate=4 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In response to the [[Orlando nightclub shooting]] and the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting|Las Vegas shooting]], Moran offered thoughts and prayers with his wife, Robba.&lt;ref name="Wheat1004G"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wheat|first1=Shawn|title=Kansas Politicians React to Orlando Nightclub Shooting – WIBW News Now!|url=http://www.wibwnewsnow.com/kansas-politicians-react-orlando-nightclub-shooting/|website=WIBW News Now!|accessdate=4 October 2017|date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KSNTV1004G"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kansas officials release statements after Las Vegas shooting|url=http://ksn.com/2017/10/02/kansas-officials-release-statements-after-las-vegas-shooting/|website=KSN-TV|accessdate=4 October 2017|date=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, based on his environment-related votes, Moran had a lifetime score of 8% from the [[League of Conservation Voters]], and a 0% score for 2016.&lt;ref name="LCV-2009"&gt;{{Cite web | title=National Environmental Scorecard: Jerry Moran|year=2017|url=http://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/jerry-moran|publisher=League of Conservation Voters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moran voted in 2015 against a Senate amendment acknowledging that [[Anthropogenic climate change|human activity contributes to climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Wang, [https://www.wired.com/2015/01/senators-dont-believe-human-caused-climate-change/ Here Are All the Senators Who Do and Don’t Believe in Human-Caused Climate Change], ''Wired'' (January 21, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Moran and several other Senate Republicans signed a letter calling upon the U.S. to withdraw funding from the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]].&lt;ref&gt;Kate Sheppard &amp; Jessica Schulberg, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-senators-climate-change-palestine_us_5716a0ebe4b06f35cb7108ef Senate Republicans Want To Cut Funding For UN Climate Change Agency, Because Palestine], ''Huffington Post'' (April 19, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Moran voted against the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]] (Waxman-Markey), which would have established a [[cap-and-trade]] system to reduce [[carbon emissions]] and combat climate change.&lt;ref&gt;James Carlson, [http://cjonline.com/state/2009-06-29/cap-and-trade-vote-splits-delegation Cap and trade vote splits delegation], ''Topeka Capitol-Journal'' (June 29, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

Additionally, [[Manhattan Regional Airport]] has direct jet service daily to and from Chicago and Dallas.

At [[Kansas State University]], he was initiated into [[Alpha Tau Omega]] on September 28, 2013.

Moran volunteers his time with several community organizations.

In 2000, Stiglitz founded the [[Initiative for Policy Dialogue]] (IPD), a [[think tank]] on international development based at Columbia University. He has been a member of the Columbia faculty since 2001, and received that university's highest academic rank ([[University Professor (Columbia)|university professor]]) in 2003. He was the founding chair of the university's Committee on Global Thought. He also chairs the [[University of Manchester]]'s [[Brooks World Poverty Institute]]. He is a member of the [[Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences]].  In 2009, the [[President of the United Nations General Assembly]] [[Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann]], appointed Stiglitz as the chairman of the U.N. Commission on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System, where he oversaw suggested proposals and commissioned a report on reforming the international monetary and financial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/ga/president/63/commission/members.shtml |title=The Commission of Experts of the President of the UN General Assembly on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System |website=un.org | publisher = [[United Nations]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as chair of the international Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, appointed by President Sarkozy of France, which issued its report in 2010, ''Mismeasuring our Lives: Why GDP doesn't add up,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mismeasuring Our Lives: Why GDP Doesn't Add Up|url = https://www.amazon.com/Mismeasuring-Our-Lives-Why-Doesnt/dp/1595585192|publisher = The New Press|date = 2010-05-18|isbn = 9781595585196|language = English|first = Joseph E.|last = Stiglitz|first2 = Amartya|last2 = Sen|first3 = Jean-Paul|last3 = Fitoussi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and currently serves as co-chair of its successor, the High Level Expert Group on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress. From 2011 to 2014, Stiglitz was president of the [[International Economic Association]] (IEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea-world.org/ |title=The International Economics Association |publisher=International Economics Association |date=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presided over the organization of the IEA triennial world congress held near the Dead Sea in Jordan in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea-world.org/JordanCongress_GeneralInfo.php |title=IEA World Congress 2014 |publisher=International Economics Association |date=October 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017182743/http://www.iea-world.org/JordanCongress_GeneralInfo.php |archivedate=October 17, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stiglitz has received more than 40 honorary degrees, including from Cambridge and Harvard, and he has been decorated by several governments including Bolivia, Korea, Colombia, Ecuador, and most recently France, where he was appointed a member of the Legion of Honor, order Officer.

In 2011 Stiglitz was named by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2066367_2066369_2066440,00.html |title=The 2011 TIME 100 |publisher=time.com  |date=April 21, 2011 |first=Gordon |last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stiglitz's work focuses on income distribution from a [[Georgist]] perspective, asset risk management, corporate governance, and international trade. He is the author of several books, the latest being ''The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe (2016),'' ''The Great Divide: Unequal Societies and What We Can Do About Them'' (2015), ''Rewriting the Rules of the American Economy: An Agenda for Growth and Shared Prosperity'' (2015), and ''Creating a Learning Society: A New Approach to Growth Development and Social Progress'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor |first=Ihsan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2012-08-26/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html |title=Best Sellers – The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Stiglitz was born in [[Gary, Indiana]], to Charlotte (née Fishman), a schoolteacher, and Nathaniel David Stiglitz, an insurance salesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7bYRAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Charlotte+Nathaniel+Stiglitz&amp;dq=Charlotte+Nathaniel+Stiglitz | title = International Who's who of Authors and Writers | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Stiglitz, Joseph E. 1943– (Joseph Eugene Stiglitz) | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3231900130/stiglitz-joseph-e-1943.html | website = encyclopedia.com | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stiglitz graduated from [[Amherst College]] in 1964, where he was a highly active member of the debate team and president of the student government. During his senior year at Amherst College, he studied at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), where he later pursued graduate work. From 1965 to 1966, he moved to the [[University of Chicago]] to do research under [[Hirofumi Uzawa]] who had received an [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] grant. He studied for his PhD from MIT from 1966 to 1967, during which time he also held an MIT assistant professorship. Stiglitz stated that the particular style of MIT economics suited him well, describing it as "simple and concrete models, directed at answering important and relevant questions."&lt;ref name=NOBEL1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2001/stiglitz-autobio.html |title=Joseph E.

From 1966 to 1970 he was a research fellow at the [[University of Cambridge]]. Stiglitz initially arrived at [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge]] as a [[Fulbright Scholar]] in 1965, and he later won a Tapp Junior Research Fellowship at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]] which was instrumental in shaping his understanding of [[Keynes]] and macroeconomic theory.&lt;ref name="Optima1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitz.cam.ac.uk/mi-client/media/import/documents/Optima8.pdf |title=A shilling in the meter and a penny for your thoughts ...

Bradford DeLong]] and [[Aaron Edlin]].

He also gives classes for a double-degree program between [[Sciences Po Paris]] and [[École Polytechnique]] in 'Economics and Public Policy'. He has chaired The Brooks World Poverty Institute at the [[University of Manchester]] since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Staff: Professor Joseph E Stiglitz | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070112171724/http://www.bwpi.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/index.html | archive-date = 12 January 2007 | url = http://www.bwpi.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/index.html | website = manchester.ac.uk | publisher = [[University of Manchester]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Master Economics and Public Policy | url = http://www.sciences-po.fr/formation/master_scpo/mentions/economics/index.htm | archive-url = http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091015173458/http://www.sciences-po.fr/formation/master_scpo/mentions/economics/index.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2009-10-15 | website = sciences-po.fr | publisher = Edudier à Sciences Po }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stiglitz is widely considered a [[New Keynesian economics|New-Keynesian]] economist,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce C. Greenwald &amp; Joseph E. Stiglitz: ''Keynesian, New Keynesian and New Classical Economics.'' Oxford Economics Papers, 39, March 1987, pp. 119–33.

In addition to making numerous influential contributions to [[macroeconomics]], Stiglitz has played a number of policy roles. He served in the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] as the chair of the President's [[Council of Economic Advisers]] (1995–1997). At the [[World Bank]], he served as senior vice-president and chief economist (1997–2000), in the time when unprecedented protest against international economic organizations started, most prominently with the [[Seattle]] [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO meeting of 1999]]. He was fired by the World Bank for expressing dissent with its policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greg Palast |url=http://www.gregpalast.com/the-globalizer-who-came-in-from-the-cold/ |title=multi-day interview with Greg Palast |publisher=Gregpalast.com |date=October 10, 2001 |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a lead author of the 1995 Report of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], which shared the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=Personally&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.personallyspeakingbureau.com/speaker/joseph-stiglitz// |title=Joseph Stiglitz – former World Bank Chief Economist|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a member of [[Collegium International]],&lt;ref&gt;Composition. "Collegium-International." Accessed on: November 21, 2017, Retrieved from:http://www.collegium-international.org/en/component/content/article/107-about/192-history.html"&lt;/ref&gt; an organization of leaders with political, scientific, and ethical expertise whose goal is to provide new approaches in overcoming the obstacles in the way of a peaceful, socially just and an economically sustainable world. He is also a member of the scientific committee of the Fundacion IDEAS, a Spanish think tank &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fundación Ideas|url=http://www.fundacionideas.es/scientific_commitee|title=Comité Científico|accessdate=May 8, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704032018/http://www.fundacionideas.es/scientific_commitee|archivedate=July 4, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2001.

Stiglitz has advised American president [[Barack Obama]], but has also been sharply critical of the [[Obama Administration]]'s financial-industry rescue plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Obama's Ersatz Capitalism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/opinion/01stiglitz.html|work=The New York Times|date=March 31, 2009|accessdate=April 2, 2009 | first=Joseph E. | last=Stiglitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stiglitz said that whoever designed the Obama administration's bank rescue plan is "either in the pocket of the banks or they're incompetent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Stiglitz Says Ties to Wall Street Doom Bank Rescue |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=afYsmJyngAXQ&amp;refer=home|work=Bloomberg News|date=April 17, 2009|accessdate=April 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, he was asked by the President of the United Nations General Assembly to chair a commission drafting a report on the reasons for and solutions to the financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Commission of Experts of the President of the UN General Assembly on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System |url= https://www.un.org/ga/president/63/commission/background.shtml | website = un.org | publisher = United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the commission produced the [[Stiglitz Report]].

On July 25, 2011, Stiglitz participated in the "I Foro Social del 15M" organized in [[Madrid]] (Spain) expressing his support to the [[2011 Spanish protests]].&lt;ref name="15M SPEECH" /&gt;

Stiglitz was the president of the International Economic Association from 2011 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea-world.com/general_info.php |title=International Economic Association (IEA) |publisher=Iea-world.com |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518131322/http://www.iea-world.com/general_info.php |archivedate=May 18, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 27, 2015, the United Kingdom Labour Party announced that Stiglitz was to sit on its Economic Advisory Committee along with five other world leading economists.

==Contributions to economics==

===Risk aversion===
After getting his PhD from [[M.I.T]] in 1967, Stiglitz co-authored one of his first papers with [[Michael Rothschild]] for the Journal of Economic Theory in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. and Michael Rothschild. "Increasing Risk I. A Definition." Journal of Economic Theory, Vol. 2, No. 3, Sept. 1970, pp. 225-243. Accessed 24 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Stiglitz and Rothschild extrapolated on previous works by prominent economists such as [[Robert Solow]] to work on the concept of risk aversion, which is the behavior in humans to lower the uncertainty presented in the risk situation. Stiglitz and Rothschild's paper's primary focus was on defining "When is a random variable 'Y' more variable than another random variable 'X'." In this mathematically complex paper, Stiglitz and Rothschild showed four plausible answers to this question, which led them to write the second paper, in which they analyzed the likely economic effects of increasing risk.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. and Michael Rothschild. "Increasing Risk II. Its economic consequences." Journal of Economic Theory, Vol. 3, No. 1, March 1971, pp. 66-84. Accessed 24 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; They examine an individual's return on savings, portfolio problem, portfolio-savings problem and a firm's production problem. These papers allowed Stiglitz to earn the [[John Bates Clark Medal]] in 1979.

===Henry George theorem===
Stiglitz made early contributions to a theory of public finance stating that an optimal supply of local [[public goods]] can be funded entirely through [[value capture|capture]] of the [[land (economics)|land]] [[economic rent|rents]] generated by those goods (when population distributions are optimal). Stiglitz dubbed this the '[[Henry George theorem]]' in reference to the radical [[classical economist]] [[Henry George]] who famously advocated for [[land value tax]]. The explanation behind Stiglitz's finding is that rivalry for public goods takes place geographically, so competition for access to any beneficial public good will increase land values by at least as much as its outlay cost. Furthermore, Stiglitz shows that a [[Georgism|single tax on rents]] is necessary to provide the optimal supply of local public investment. Stiglitz also shows how the theorem could be used to find the optimal size of a city or firm.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Arnott &amp; Joseph E. Stiglitz, 1979. "Aggregate Land Rents, Expenditure on Public Goods, and Optimal City Size," The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Oxford University Press, vol. 93(4), pages 471–500.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (1977) The theory of local public goods. In: Feldstein, M.S. and R.P. Inman (eds.) The Economics of Public Services. MacMillan, London, pp. 274–333.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information asymmetry===
Stiglitz's most famous research was on [[Screening (economics)|screening]], a technique used by one economic agent to extract otherwise private information from another.  It was for this contribution to the theory of [[information asymmetry]] that he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics&lt;ref name=NOBEL1 /&gt; in 2001 "for laying the foundations for [[information asymmetry|the theory of markets with asymmetric information]]" with [[George A. Akerlof]] and [[A. Michael Spence]].

Before the advent of models of imperfect and asymmetric information, the traditional [[neoclassical economics]] literature had assumed that markets are efficient except for some limited and well defined [[market failure]]s. More recent work by Stiglitz and others reversed that presumption, to assert that it is only under exceptional circumstances that markets are efficient. Stiglitz has shown (together with [[Bruce Greenwald]]) that "whenever markets are incomplete and/or information is imperfect (which are true in virtually all economies), even competitive market allocation is not constrained [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficient]]". In other words, they addressed "the problem of determining when tax interventions are Pareto-improving.  The approach indicates that such tax interventions almost always exist and that equilibria in situations of [[imperfect information]] are rarely constrained Pareto optima."&lt;ref name=GrSt1986&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stiglitz | first1 = Joseph E. | last2 = Greenwald | first2 = Bruce C. | title = Externalities in economies with imperfect information and incomplete markets | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] | volume = 101 | issue = 2 | pages = 229–64 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] via [[JSTOR]] | date = May 1986 | jstor = 1891114 | ref = harv | postscript = . | doi = 10.2307/1891114 }} [http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/download/papers/1986_Externalities_in_Economies.pdf PDF; 2.96 MB] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513135712/http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/download/papers/1986_Externalities_in_Economies.pdf |date=2011-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|229, abstract}} Although these conclusions and the pervasiveness of market failures do not necessarily warrant the state intervening broadly in the economy, it makes clear that the "optimal" range of government recommendable interventions is definitely much larger than the traditional "market failure" school recognizes.&lt;ref name=WANG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/gpa/wang_files/state.pdf |title=Wang, Shaoguang.

In an interview in 2007, Stiglitz explained further:&lt;ref name=PACT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beppegrillo.it/eng/2007/01/stiglitz.html |title=Stiglitz, Joseph E. ''The pact with the devil.''

===Shapiro-Stiglitz efficiency wage model===
{{Main|Shapiro–Stiglitz theory}}
{{See also|Efficiency wages}}
[[File:Efficiency wage Shapiro Stiglitz.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|In the [[Shapiro-Stiglitz model]] of efficiency wages, workers are paid at a level that dissuades shirking. This prevents wages from dropping to market clearing levels. Full employment cannot be achieved because workers would shirk if they were not threatened with the possibility of unemployment. Because of this, the curve for the no-shirking condition (labeled NSC) goes to infinity at full employment.]]

Stiglitz also did research on [[efficiency wages]], and helped create what became known as the "Shapiro-Stiglitz model" to explain why there is unemployment even in equilibrium, why wages are not bid down sufficiently by job seekers (in the absence of minimum wages) so that everyone who wants a job finds one, and to question whether the [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical paradigm]] could explain [[involuntary unemployment]].&lt;ref name = SHAPIROSTGLTZARTCL/&gt;  An answer to these puzzles was proposed by [[Carl Shapiro|Shapiro]] and Stiglitz in 1984: "Unemployment is driven by the information structure of employment".&lt;ref name=SHAPIROSTGLTZARTCL&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stiglitz | first1 = Joseph E. | last2 = Shapiro | first2 = Carl | title = Equilibrium unemployment as a worker discipline device | journal = [[The American Economic Review]] | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 433–44 | publisher = [[American Economic Association]] via [[JSTOR]] | date = June 1984 | jstor = 1804018 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two basic observations undergird their analysis:

# Unlike other forms of capital, humans can choose their level of effort.
# It is costly for firms to determine how much effort workers are exerting.

A full description of this model can be found at the links provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coin.wne.uw.edu.pl/lwincenciak/docs/lecture_4.pdf |title=Lecture 4|date= May 22, 2007|website=coin.wne.uw.edu.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SHAPIROSTGLTZMATH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coin.wne.uw.edu.pl/lwincenciak/docs/lecture_4.pdf |title=Efficiency wages, the Shapiro-Stiglitz Model |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some key implications of this model are:

# Wages do not fall enough during recessions to prevent unemployment from rising. If the demand for labour falls, this lowers wages. But because wages have fallen, the probability of 'shirking' (workers not exerting effort) has risen. If employment levels are to be maintained, through a sufficient lowering of wages, workers will be less productive than before through the shirking effect. As a consequence, in the model, wages do not fall enough to maintain employment levels at the previous state, because firms want to avoid excessive shirking by their workers. So, unemployment must rise during recessions, because wages are kept 'too high'.
# Possible corollary: Wage sluggishness. Moving from one private cost of hiring (w∗) to another private cost of hiring (w∗∗) will require each firm to repeatedly re-optimize wages in response to shifting unemployment rate. Firms cannot cut wages until unemployment rises sufficiently (a coordination problem).

The outcome is never Pareto efficient.

# Each firm employs too few workers because it faces private cost of hiring rather than the social cost{{snd}} which is equal to and in all cases.{{Clarify|date=January 2014}}  This means that firms do not "internalize" the "external" cost of unemployment{{snd}} they do not factor how large-scale unemployment harms society when assessing their own costs.  This leads to a negative externality as marginal social cost exceeds the firm's marginal cost (MSC = Firm's Private Marginal Cost + Marginal External Cost of increased social unemployment){{Clarify|date=January 2010}}
# There are also positive externalities: each firm increases the asset value of unemployment for all other firms when they hire during recessions.  By creating hypercompetitive labor markets, all firms (the winners when laborers compete) experience an increase in value.  However, this effect of increased valuation is very unapparent, because the first problem (the negative externality of sub-optimal hiring) clearly dominates since the 'natural rate of unemployment' is always too high.

===Practical implications of Stiglitz theories===
While the mathematical validity of Stiglitz ''et al.'' theorems are not in question, their practical implications in [[political economy]] and their application in real life [[Economic policy|economic policies]] have been subject to disagreement and debate.&lt;ref name=DISENSUS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.developmentinpractice.org/apc_ap-v14n3x525073q.html |title=Consensus, dissensus, confusion: the `Stiglitz Debate' in perspective |accessdate=2007-08-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422032304/http://www.developmentinpractice.org/apc_ap-v14n3x525073q.html |archivedate=2007-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stiglitz himself has  evolved his political-economic discourse over time.&lt;ref name=DEBATE2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/15630 |author=Friedman, Benjamin M. |title= Globalization: Stiglitz's Case. |publisher=The New York Review of Books, Volume 49, Number 13  |website=Nybooks.com |date=August 15, 2002 |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Once incomplete and imperfect information are introduced, Chicago-school defenders of the market system cannot sustain descriptive claims of the Pareto efficiency of the real world.

{{quote|The effect of Stiglitz's influence is to make economics even more presumptively interventionist than Samuelson preferred. Samuelson treated market failure as the exception to the general rule of efficient markets. But the Greenwald-Stiglitz theorem posits market failure as the norm, establishing "that government could potentially almost always improve upon the market's resource allocation." And the Sappington-Stiglitz theorem "establishes that an ideal government could do better running an enterprise itself than it could through privatization&lt;ref name=SAPPINGTON&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~yqian/econ260b/Sappington%20Privatization.pdf |title=Privatization, Information and Incentives |accessdate=2007-05-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518062152/http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~yqian/econ260b/Sappington%20Privatization.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;| Stiglitz 1994, p. 179.&lt;ref name=BOETTKE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-dissident.com/Boettke_CR.pdf |author=Boettke, Peter J. |title=What Went Wrong with Economics?, Critical Review Vol. 11, No. 1, pp. 35, 58 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Objections to the wide adoption of positions suggested by Stiglitz's discoveries do not come from economics itself, but mostly from political scientists, especially in the field of [[sociology]].  As David L. Prychitko discusses in his "critique" to ''Whither Socialism?'' (see below), although Stiglitz's main economic insight seems generally correct, it still leaves open great constitutional questions such as how the coercive institutions of the government should be constrained and what the relation is between the government and civil society.&lt;ref name=CRITIQUE1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj16n2-10.html |title=Whither Socialism? |accessdate=2007-09-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970607112959/http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj16n2-10.html |archivedate=1997-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==

===Clinton administration===
Stiglitz joined the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Brief Biography of Joseph E. Stiglitz | url = http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/bio.cfm | website = columbia.edu | publisher = [[Columbia University]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110829164327/http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/bio.cfm | archivedate = 2011-08-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; serving first as a member during 1993–1995, and was then appointed Chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] on June 28, 1995, in which capacity he also served as a member of the cabinet. He became deeply involved in environmental issues, which included serving on the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], and helping draft a new law for toxic wastes (which was never passed).

Stiglitz's most important contribution in this period was helping define a new economic philosophy, a "third way", which postulated the important, but limited, role of government, that unfettered markets often did not work well, but that government was not always able to correct the limitations of markets. The academic research that he had been conducting over the preceding 25 years provided the intellectual foundations for this "third way".

When President [[Bill Clinton]] was re-elected, he asked Stiglitz to continue to serve as Chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] for another term. But he had already been approached by the [[World Bank]] to be its senior vice president for development policy and its chief economist, and he assumed that position after his CEA successor was confirmed on February 13, 1997.

As the World Bank began its ten-year review of the transition of the former [[Communist|Communist countries]] to the [[market economy]] it unveiled failures of the countries that had followed the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) shock therapy policies{{snd}} both in terms of the declines in GDP and increases in poverty{{snd}} that were even worse than the worst that most of its critics had envisioned at the onset of the transition. Clear links existed between the dismal performances and the policies that the IMF had advocated, such as the voucher privatization schemes and excessive monetary stringency.  Meanwhile, the success of a few countries that had followed quite different strategies suggested that there were alternatives that could have been followed. The [[US Treasury]] had put enormous pressure on the [[World Bank]] to silence his criticisms of the policies which they and the IMF had pursued.&lt;ref name=SHOIWDOWN&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Wade | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Wade (development scholar) | title = Showdown at the World Bank | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 7 | pages = 124–37 | publisher = New Left Review | date = January–February 2001 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/7/robert-wade-showdown-at-the-world-bank | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DANGEROUS&gt;{{cite web | last = Hage | first = Dave |url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/101100-101.htm |title=Joseph Stiglitz: A Dangerous Man, A World Bank Insider Who Defected | work = [[Star Tribune]] |publisher=Commondreams.org | location = Minneapolis |date=October 11, 2000 |accessdate=October 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814032443/http://www.commondreams.org/views/101100-101.htm |archivedate=August 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stiglitz always had a poor relationship with Treasury Secretary [[Lawrence Summers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hirsh | first = Michael | title = Why Washington ignores an economic prophet | url = http://europe.newsweek.com/why-washington-ignores-economic-prophet-81985?rm=eu | work = [[Newsweek]] |publisher=Newsweek LLC |date = 18 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Summers successfully petitioned for Stiglitz's removal, supposedly in exchange for World Bank President [[James Wolfensohn]]'s re-appointment{{snd}} an exchange that Wolfensohn denies took place. Whether Summers ever made such a blunt demand is questionable{{snd}} Wolfensohn claims he would "have told him to *** himself".&lt;ref&gt;Mallaby, ''The World's Banker'', p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stiglitz resigned from the World Bank in January 2000, a month before his term expired.&lt;ref name=DANGEROUS /&gt; The [[World Bank|Bank's president]], James Wolfensohn, announced Stiglitz's resignation in November 1999 and also announced that Stiglitz would stay on as Special Advisor to the President, and would chair the search committee for a successor.

{{quote|Joseph E. Stiglitz said today [Nov. 24, 1999] that he would resign as the World Bank's chief economist after using the position for nearly three years to raise pointed questions about the effectiveness of conventional approaches to helping poor countries.&lt;ref name=RESIGN&gt;{{cite news | last = Stevenson | first = Richard W.  |title= Outspoken chief economist leaving World Bank | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801EFDB163FF936A15752C1A96F958260 | work = [[The New York Times]] |publisher= [[The New York Times Company]] |date=November 25, 1999 |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this role, he continued criticism of the IMF, and, by implication, the US Treasury Department. In April 2000, in an article for ''[[The New Republic]]'', he wrote:

{{quote|They'll say the IMF is arrogant. They'll say the IMF doesn't really listen to the developing countries it is supposed to help. They'll say the IMF is secretive and insulated from democratic accountability. They'll say the IMF's economic 'remedies' often make things worse{{snd}} turning slowdowns into recessions and recessions into depressions. And they'll have a point. I was chief economist at the World Bank from 1996 until last November, during the gravest global economic crisis in a half-century. I saw how the IMF, in tandem with the U.S. Treasury Department, responded. And I was appalled.}}

The article was published a week before the annual meetings of the World Bank and IMF and provoked a strong response. It proved too strong for Summers and, yet more lethally, Stiglitz's protector-of-sorts at the World Bank, Wolfensohn. Wolfensohn had privately empathised with Stiglitz's views, but this time was worried for his second term, which Summers had threatened to veto.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}  Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director of the IMF, called a special staff meeting and informed at that gathering that Wolfensohn had agreed to fire Stiglitz.  Meanwhile, the Bank's External Affairs department told the press that Stiglitz had not been fired, his post had merely been abolished.&lt;ref name=WADE&gt;{{cite book | last = Wade | first = Robert | title = US hegemony and the World Bank: Stiglitz's firing and Kanbur's resignation | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080529110008/http://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/evans/evans_pdf/Wade.pdf | archive-date = 29 May 2008 | url = http://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/evans/evans_pdf/Wade.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 19, 2008 radio interview, with [[Aimee Allison]] and [[Philip Maldari]] on [[Pacifica Radio]]'s [[KPFA]] 94.1&amp;nbsp;FM in [[Berkeley, California]], US, Stiglitz implied that President Clinton and his economic advisors would not have backed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) had they been aware of stealth provisions, inserted by lobbyists, that they overlooked.

===Initiative for Policy Dialogue===
{{Main|Initiative for Policy Dialogue}}
In July 2000, Stiglitz founded the [[Initiative for Policy Dialogue]] (IPD), with support of the Ford, Rockefeller, McArthur, and Mott Foundations and the Canadian and Swedish governments, to enhance democratic processes for decision-making in developing countries and to ensure that a broader range of alternatives are on the table and more stakeholders are at the table.

===Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress===
At the beginning of 2008, Stiglitz chaired the [[Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress]], also known as the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission, initiated by President Sarkozy of France. The Commission held its first plenary meeting on April 22–23, 2008, in Paris. Its final report was made public on September 14, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Stiglitz documentation | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150720212135/http://www.stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr/en/index.htm | archive-date = 20 July 2015 | url = http://www.stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr/en/index.htm | publisher = Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress | date = September 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stiglitz - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2009.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Stiglitz at the [[World Economic Forum]] annual meeting in [[Davos]], 2009]]

In 2009, Stiglitz chaired the [[Commission of Experts on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System]] which was convened by the [[President of the United Nations General Assembly]] "to review the workings of the [[global financial system]], including major bodies such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and to suggest steps to be taken by Member States to secure a more [[sustainability|sustainable]] and [[global justice|just global economic order]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/president/63/commission/background.shtml|title=Terms of Reference Commission of Experts of the President of the United Nations General Assembly on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System|accessdate=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its final report was released on September 21, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/president/63/commission/financial_commission.shtml The Commission of Experts of the President of the UN General Assembly on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System], UN General Assembly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NGLS |url=http://www.un-ngls.org/spip.php?page=cfr |title=Commission of Experts on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System, official site |publisher=Un-ngls.org |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek debt crisis===
In 2010, Professor Stiglitz acted as an advisor to the Greek government during the [[Greek debt crisis]]. He appeared on Bloomberg TV for an interview on the risks of Greece defaulting, in which he stated that he was very confident that Greece would not default. He went on to say that Greece was under "speculative attack" and though it had "short-term liquidity problems ... and would benefit from Solidarity Bonds", the country was "on track to meet its obligations".{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The next day, during a BBC interview, Stiglitz stated that "there's no problem of Greece or Spain meeting their interest payments". He argued nonetheless, that it would be desirable and needed for all of Europe to make a clear statement of belief in social solidarity and that they "stand behind Greece". Confronted with the statement: "Greece's difficulty is that the magnitude of debt is far greater than the capacity of the economy to service", Stiglitz replied, "That's rather absurd".{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 2012, Stiglitz described the European austerity plans as a "suicide-pact".&lt;ref name=Moore1&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Malcolm|title=Stiglitz says European austerity plans are a 'suicide pact'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9019819/Stiglitz-says-European-austerity-plans-are-a-suicide-pact.html|accessdate=April 26, 2012|newspaper=Telegraph|date=Jan 17, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
Since March 2012, Stiglitz has been a member of the [[Scottish Government]]'s Fiscal Commission Working Group, which oversees the work to establish a fiscal and macro economic framework for an [[Scottish independence|independent Scotland]] on behalf of the Scottish [[Council of Economic Advisers (Scotland)|Council of Economic Advisers]].

Together with Professors [[Andrew Hughes Hallett]], Sir [[James Mirrlees]] and [[Frances Ruane]] Stiglitz will "advise on the establishment of a credible Fiscal Commission which entrenches financial responsibility and ensures market confidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Fiscal Commission Working Group | archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/3011/20130201194612/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2012/03/fiscal-commission25032012 | archive-date = 1 February 2013 | url = http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2012/03/fiscal-commission25032012 | publisher = The Scottish Government | date = 25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour Party===
In July 2015, Stiglitz endorsed [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign, 2015|campaign]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|Labour Party leadership election]]. He said: "I am not surprised at all that there is a demand for a strong anti-austerity movement around increased concern about inequality.

==Economic views==
===Support for anti-austerity movement in Spain===
On July 25, 2011, Stiglitz participated in the "I Foro Social del 15M" organized in [[Madrid]] (Spain) expressing his support for the [[anti-austerity movement in Spain]].&lt;ref name="15M SPEECH"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2iKj-1v2Cc|title=Joseph Stiglitz apoya el movimiento 15-M|accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an informal speech, he made a brief review of some of the problems in Europe and in the United States, the serious unemployment rate and the situation in Greece. "This is an opportunity for economic contribution social measures", argued Stiglitz, who made a critical speech about the way authorities are handling the political exit to the crisis. He encouraged those present to respond to the bad ideas, not with indifference, but with good ideas. "This does not work, you have to change it", he said.

===Criticism of rating agencies===
Stiglitz has been critical of [[Big Three (credit rating agencies)|rating agencies]], describing them as the "key culprit" in the financial crisis, noting "they were the party that performed the alchemy that converted the securities from F-rated to A-rated. The banks could not have done what they did without the complicity of the rating agencies."&lt;ref name=Neate1&gt;{{cite news|last=Neate|first=Rupert|title=Ratings agencies suffer 'conflict of interest', says former Moody's boss|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/22/ratings-agencies-conflict-of-interest|accessdate=April 21, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 22, 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stiglitz co-authored a paper with [[Peter Orszag]] in 2002 titled "Implications of the New Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Risk-Based Capital Standard" where they stated "on the basis of historical experience, the risk to the government from a potential default on GSE debt is effectively zero." However, "the risk-based capital standard ... may fail to reflect the probability of another Great Depression-like scenario."&lt;ref name=fanniemae&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pierrelemieux.org/stiglitzrisk.pdf|title=Implications of the New Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Risk-Based Capital Standard|publisher=[[Fannie Mae]]|accessdate=February 10, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122094851/http://www.pierrelemieux.org/stiglitzrisk.pdf|archivedate=November 22, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of Trans-Pacific Partnership and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership===
{{See also|Trans-Pacific Partnership#Response|Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership#activism against TTIP}}
Stiglitz warned that the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (TPP) presented "grave risks" and it "serves the interests of the wealthiest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Secrecy surrounds Trans-Pacific Partnership talks|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/secrecy-surrounds-transpacific-partnership-talks-20131208-2yzea.html|accessdate=December 9, 2013|newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140315"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stiglitz |first=Joseph E. |title=On the Wrong Side of Globalization |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/on-the-wrong-side-of-globalization |date=March 15, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stiglitz also opposed the [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] (TTIP) trade deal between the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[United States]], and has argued that the [[United Kingdom]] should consider [[United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union|its withdrawal from the EU]] in [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|the 2016 referendum on the matter]] if TTIP passes, saying that "the [[wikt:stricture|strictures]] imposed by TTIP would be sufficiently averse to the functioning of government that it would make me think over again about whether membership of the EU was a good idea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simons|first1=Ned|title=UK Should Consider Brexit If EU Signs TTIP, Suggests Labour Economics Adviser Joseph Stiglitz|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/03/02/uk-should-consider-brexit-if-eu-signs-ttip-suggests-labour-economics-adviser_n_9368110.html|accessdate=14 March 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sheffield|first1=Hazel|title=EU referendum: UK could be better off leaving if TTIP passes, Joseph Stiglitz says|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/eu-referendum-joseph-stiglitz-ttip-labour-transatlantic-trade-investment-partnership-a6907806.html|accessdate=14 March 2016|work=The Independent|date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brexit better for Britain than toxic TTIP, says Joseph Stiglitz|url=https://www.rt.com/uk/334409-brexit-ttip-stiglitz-eu/|accessdate=14 March 2016|work=RT UK|date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation===
Stiglitz argues that relying solely on business self-interest as the means of achieving the well-being of society and [[economic efficiency]] is misleading, and that instead "What is needed is stronger norms, clearer understandings of what is acceptable{{snd}} and what is not{{snd}} and stronger laws and regulations to ensure that those that do not behave in ways that are consistent with these norms are held accountable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201312240257.html?page=3|title=Ethiopia: Do Human Rights Make Economic Sense?|first=Joseph|last=Stiglitz|date=24 December 2013|publisher=|via=AllAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land value tax (Georgism)===
Stiglitz argues that [[land value tax]] would improve the efficiency and equity of agricultural economies. Stiglitz believes that societies should rely on a generalized [[Georgism|Henry George principle]] to finance public goods, protect natural resources, improve land use, and reduce the burden of rents and taxes on the poor while increasing productive capital formation. Stiglitz advocates taxing "natural resource rents at as close to 100 percent as possible" and that a corollary of this principle is that polluters should be taxed for "activities that generate negative externalities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cleveland | first1 = M.

===Views on the eurozone===
In a September 2016 interview Stiglitz stated that "the cost of keeping the Eurozone together probably exceeds the cost of breaking it up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Photiadou|first1=Artemis|last2=Brown|first2=Stuart|title=Interview with Joseph Stiglitz: "The cost of keeping the Eurozone together probably exceeds the cost of breaking it up"|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/09/05/interview-joseph-stiglitz-brexit-euro-mistake/|website=blogs.lse.ac.uk|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|date=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on free trade===
====Advice for the eurozone countries====
In the 1990s, he wrote that ''"countries in North America and Europe should eliminate all tariffs and quotas'' (protectionist measures)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/101100-101.htm|title=Joseph Stiglitz -- A Dangerous Man, A World Bank Insider Who Defected|date=14 August 2013|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814032443/http://www.commondreams.org/views/101100-101.htm|archivedate=14 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He now advises the eurozone countries to control their trade balance with Germany by means of export/[[import certificates]] or "trade chits" (a protectionist measure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/euro-septic/|title=Euro, Economics – TheTLS|website=www.the-tls.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=rBycCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT205&amp;lpg=PT205&amp;dq=trade+chits&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WzjN8l4Oku&amp;sig=zut8o32Ezyebr0Ljz4gyKDB6VLk&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-za-Zgq3XAhVJPRoKHQCjAYYQ6AEIOjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=trade+chits&amp;f=false|title=The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe|first=Joseph E.|last=Stiglitz|date=16 August 2016|publisher=W.

Citing Keynesian theory, he explains that trade deficits are harmful: ''"[[John Maynard Keynes]] pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand – countries running surpluses exert a "negative externality" on trading partners. Indeed, Keynes believed it was surplus countries, far more than those in deficit, that posed a threat to global prosperity; he went so far as to advocate a tax on surplus countries"''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/05/reform-euro-or-bin-it-greece-germany|title=Reform the euro or bin it - Joseph Stiglitz|first=Joseph|last=Stiglitz|date=5 May 2010|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stiglitz writes: ''"Germany's surplus means that the rest of Europe is in deficit. And the fact that these countries import more than they export contributes to the weakness of their economies"''. He thinks that surplus countries are getting richer at the expense of deficit countries. He notes that the euro is the cause of this deficit and that as the trade deficit declines GDP would rise and unemployment would fall: ''"The euro system means that Germany's exchange rate cannot increase compared to other euro area members. If the exchange rate were to rise, Germany would have more difficulty exporting and its economic model, based on strong exports, would cease. At the same time, the rest of Europe would export more, GDP would rise and unemployment would fall"''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He also thinks that the rest of the world should impose a carbon-adjustment tax (a protectionist measure) on American exports that do not comply with global standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/02/paris-climate-deal-to-trumps-rogue-america|title=How to respond to Trump's America - Joseph Stiglitz|first=Joseph|last=Stiglitz|date=2 June 2017|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advice for United States====
Contrary to Keynesian theory and these analyses on the eurozone, he argues that the United States must not rebalance the trade account and can no longer apply protectionist measures to protect or recreate the well-paying manufacturing jobs. The United States must simply agree to be the "losers", saying: "The very Americans who have been among the losers of globalization stand to be among the losers of a reversal of globalization. History cannot be put into reverse".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/donald-trump-china-economics-trade|title=Trump's Most Chilling Economic Lie|first=Joseph E.|last=Stiglitz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However, contrary to these statements, he admits that as the trade deficit declines "GDP would rise and unemployment would fall", further stating: "Countries that import more than they export contributes to the weakness of their economie".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He notes that trade deficits caused by free trade destroy manufacturing jobs: the increase in the "value of the dollar will lead to larger trade deficits and fewer manufacturing jobs".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/globalization-of-discontent-by-joseph-e--stiglitz-2017-12|title=The Globalization of Our Discontent by Joseph E.

Contrary to most economists historians, who argue that tariffs have played only a minor role or not at all in the Great Depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/the-mitt-hawley-fallacy|title=The Mitt-Hawley Fallacy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=squLnSDrJ4EC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=peter+temin+smoot+hawley+Lessons+from+the+Great+Depression&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3UxaSTyk3l&amp;sig=7W_1IiDXMSCW2ATteQy8bjJ5smQ&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx376g48fUAhWFfxoKHZgjDE8Q6AEIRzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=peter+temin+smoot+hawley+Lessons+from+the+Great+Depression&amp;f=false|title=Lessons from the Great Depression|first=Peter|last=Temin|date=8 October 1991|publisher=MIT Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=oz_BDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=Milton+Friedman++Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley+tariff+did+not+great+depression&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=atMyE4jgsp&amp;sig=INvnLOaAK0YJjVbg8FOLBF71KRs&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_5bfL5P3YAhVRbFAKHWOzDfkQ6AEIdDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Milton+Friedman++Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley+tariff+did+not+great+depression&amp;f=false|title=Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression|first=Douglas A.|last=Irwin|date=24 October 2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stiglitz thinks that the United States should not protect its economy because tariffs contributed to the Great Depression: "Following that, U.S. exports fell by some 50 percent—contributing to our Great Depression".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He denounces neoliberalism&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/mssPFfoIzskf8gQCuRrSIO/Joseph-Stiglitz--The-age-of-Donald-Trump.html|title=Joseph Stiglitz - The age of Donald Trump|first=Joseph E.|last=Stiglitz|date=30 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but yet advises the United States to pursue free trade (deregulation or liberalization of foreign trade)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-liberalization.asp|title=Trade Liberalization|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=3 April 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered to be a constitutive policy of neoliberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=bkotGqoG0u0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA30&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Globalization and Free Trade|first=Natalie|last=Goldstein|date=23 June 2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to him, it is not China (which has a large trade surplus) that makes "trade war", but the United States (which has a large trade deficit). He defends China's trade surpluses at the expense of the United States and he advises China to take sanctions against the United States. He believes that China should "react with strength and intelligence" and hit the United States "where it hurts economically and politically" if the United States tries to protect its industry and rebalance its trade account through tariffs, saying: "For example, cutbacks in purchases by China will lead to more unemployment in congressional districts that are vulnerable, influential, or both".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ... China can retaliate anywhere it chooses, such as by using trade restrictions to target jobs in the congressional districts of those who support US tariffs.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; ... China may be more effective in targeting its retaliation to cause acute political pain. ... It's anybody's guess who can stand the pain better. Will it be the US, where ordinary citizens have already suffered for so long, or China, which, despite troubled times, has managed to generate growth in excess of 6%?".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/09/my-new-year-forecast-trumpian-uncertainty-and-lots-of-it|title=My new year forecast: Trumpian uncertainty, and lots of it|first=Joseph|last=Stiglitz|date=9 January 2017|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About China, he writes that the decline in exports is not prejudicial if China replaces "export dependence to a model of growth driven by domestic demand", therefore it's not the involvement in international trade per se that brings economic growth, but rather the access to strong demand. And it is not the level of exports that matters but rather the trade balance (gap between imports and exports). Regarding the United States, he writes the opposite: "Walking away from globalization may reduce our imports, but it will also reduce exports in tandem. And, almost surely, jobs will be destroyed faster than they will be created: there may even be fewer net manufacturing jobs". If the United States tries to control the movement of goods, "they surely will lose".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In early 2017, he wrote that "the American middle class is indeed the loser of globalization" and "China, with its large emerging middle class, is among the big beneficiaries of globalization". "Thanks to globalisation, in terms of purchasing-power parity, China actually  has already become the largest economy in the world in September 2015".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, he then changed his mind and argued that the fall in wages and the disappearance of well-paid jobs in the United States, are not due to globalization, but are only inevitable collateral damage to the march of economic progress and technological innovation: "The United States can only push for advanced manufacturing, which requires higher skill sets and employs fewer people. Rising inequality, meanwhile, will continue ...".&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Finally, he changed his mind again in late 2017 and wrote that the drop in wages in the United States, is not a normal process and is solely due to the actions of multinational companies, not to the trade account imbalances between countries caused by free trade: "It was an agenda written by and for large multinational companies, at the expense of workers". So it is no longer the surplus countries that have benefited from free trade, but only companies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2016, he said he believes that the economic situation of the United States is critical: "As the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton showed in their study published in December 2015, life expectancy among middle-age white Americans is declining, as rates of suicides, drug use, and alcoholism increase. A year later, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that life expectancy for the country as a whole has declined for the first time in more than 20 years."&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; ... With the incomes of the bottom 90% having stagnated for close to a third of a century (and declining for a significant proportion), the health data simply confirmed that things were not going well for swaths of the country".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, he changed his mind again in 2017 and now thinks that the effect of globalization on the American economy is not so serious today: "Yes, America faces a variety of problems—it always has, and what nation doesn't?".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Books==
Along with his technical economic publications (he has published over 300 technical articles), Stiglitz is the author of books on issues from patent law to abuses in international trade.

===''The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe'' (2016)===

===''The Great Divide: Unequal Societies and What We Can Do About Them'' (2015)===
From the jacket: In ''The Great Divide'', Joseph E. Stiglitz expands on the diagnosis he offered in his best-selling book ''The Price of Inequality'' and suggests ways to counter America's growing problem. Stiglitz argues that inequality is a choice{{snd}} the cumulative result of unjust policies and misguided priorities.

===''Creating a Learning Society: A New Approach to Growth, Development, and Social Progress'' (2014)===
Creating a Learning Society, (co authored with Bruce C. Greenwald), cast light on the significance of this insight for economic theory and policy. Taking as a starting point Kenneth J. Arrow's 1962 paper "Learning by Doing," they explain why the production of knowledge differs from that of other goods and why market economies alone typically do not produce and transmit knowledge efficiently. Closing knowledge gaps and helping laggards learn are central to growth and development. But creating a learning society is equally crucial if we are to sustain improved living standards in advanced countries.

===''The Price of Inequality'' (2012)===
From the jacket: As those at the top continue to enjoy the best health care, education, and benefits of wealth, they often fail to realize that, as Joseph E. Stiglitz highlights, "their fate is bound up with how the other 99 percent live ... It does not have to be this way.  In ''[[The Price of Inequality]]'' Stiglitz lays out a comprehensive agenda to create a more dynamic economy and fairer and more equal society"

The book received the [[Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights]] 2013 Book Award, given annually to the book that "most faithfully and forcefully reflects Robert Kennedy's purposes{{snd}} his concern for the poor and the powerless, his struggle for honest and even-handed justice, his conviction that a decent society must assure all young people a fair chance, and his faith that a free democracy can act to remedy disparities of power and opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book Award |url=http://rfkcenter.org/book-award?lang=en |publisher=RFKcenter.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619072045/http://rfkcenter.org/book-award?lang=en |archivedate=2015-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Freefall'' (2010)===
{{Main|Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy}}

In ''Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy'', Stiglitz discusses the causes of the 2008 recession/depression and goes on to propose reforms needed to avoid a repetition of a similar crisis, advocating government intervention and regulation in a number of areas. Among the policy-makers he criticises are George W. Bush, Larry Summers, and Barack Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joel|last=Krupa |title=Guiding the Invisible Hand |url=http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/guiding-the-invisible-hand/ |date=June 7, 2010 |accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Three Trillion Dollar War'' (2008)===
''[[The Three Trillion Dollar War]]'' (co-authored with [[Linda Bilmes]]) examines the full cost of the Iraq War, including many hidden costs. The book also discusses the extent to which these costs will be imposed for many years to come, paying special attention to the enormous expenditures that will be required to care for very large numbers of wounded veterans. Stiglitz was openly critical of George W. Bush at the time the book was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kevin|last=Perry |title=Joseph Stiglitz interview about ''The Three Trillion Dollar War'' |url=http://kevinegperry.com/2008/03/04/joseph-stiglitz-interview-the-3-trillion-war/ |publisher=[[The Beaver]] |date=March 4, 2008 |accessdate=September 29, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Stability with Growth'' (2006)===
In ''[[Stability with Growth: Macroeconomics, Liberalization and Development]]'', Stiglitz, [[José Antonio Ocampo]] (United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, until 2007), Shari Spiegel (Managing Director, Initiative for Policy Dialogue{{snd}} IPD), Ricardo Ffrench-Davis (Main Adviser, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean{{snd}} [[ECLAC]]) and [[Deepak Nayyar]] (Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi) discuss the current debates on macroeconomics, capital market liberalization and development, and develop a new framework within which one can assess alternative policies. They explain their belief that the [[Washington Consensus]] has advocated narrow goals for development (with a focus on price stability) and prescribed too few policy instruments (emphasizing monetary and fiscal policies), and places unwarranted faith in the role of markets. The new framework focuses on real stability and long-term sustainable and equitable growth, offers a variety of non-standard ways to stabilize the economy and promote growth, and accepts that market imperfections necessitate government interventions. Policy-makers have pursued stabilization goals with little concern for growth consequences, while trying to increase growth through structural reforms focused on improving economic efficiency. Moreover, structural policies, such as capital market liberalization, have had major consequences for economic stability. This book challenges these policies by arguing that stabilization policy has important consequences for long-term growth and has often been implemented with adverse consequences. The first part of the book introduces the key questions and looks at the objectives of economic policy from different perspectives. The third part presents a similar analysis for capital market liberalization.

===''Making Globalization Work'' (2006)===
''[[Making Globalization Work]]'' surveys the inequities of the global economy, and the mechanisms by which developed countries exert an excessive influence over developing nations. Dr. Stiglitz argues that through tariffs, subsidies, an over-complex patent system and pollution, the world is being both economically and politically destabilised. Stiglitz argues that strong, transparent institutions are needed to address these problems. He shows how an examination of incomplete markets can make corrective government policies desirable.

Stiglitz is an exception to the general pro-globalisation view of professional economists, according to economist [[Martin Wolf]].&lt;ref name=preface&gt;"Why Globalization Works" (Yale University Press 2004) {{ISBN|978-0-300-10252-9}}, p. 8. Also Wolf criticizes World Bank heavily (pp. xiii–xv).&lt;/ref&gt; Stiglitz argues that economic opportunities are not widely enough available, that financial crises are too costly and too frequent, and that the rich countries have done too little to address these problems. ''Making Globalization Work''&lt;ref&gt;see {{YouTube|UzhD7KVs-R4|Stiglitz discuss his book}}&lt;/ref&gt; has sold more than two million copies.

===''Fair Trade for All'' (2005)===
In ''Fair Trade for All'', authors Stiglitz and Andrew Charlton argue that it is important to make the trading world more development friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blandford | first1 = David | year = | title = review of ''Fair Trade for All'', by J.E. Stiglitz and Andrew Charlton | url = | journal = American Journal of Agricultural Economics | volume = 90 | issue = 2| page = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is put forth that the present regime of tariffs and agricultural subsidies is dominated by the interests of former colonial powers and needs to change.  The removal of the bias toward the developed world will be beneficial to both developing and developed nations.  The developing world is in needs of assistance, and this can only be achieved when developed nations abandon mercantilist based priorities and work towards a more liberal world trade regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Northcott | first1 = Michael S. | year = | title = review of ''Fair Trade For All'' by J.E. Stiglitz and Andrew Charlton | url = | journal = Studies in World Christianity | volume = 12 | issue = 3| page = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''New Paradigm for Monetary Economics'' (2003)===

===''The Roaring Nineties'' (2003)===
''The Roaring Nineties'' is Stiglitz' analysis of the boom and bust of the 1990s. Presented from an insider's point of view, firstly as chair of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors, and later as chief economist of the World Bank, it continues his argument on how misplaced faith in free-market ideology led to the global economic issues of today, with a perceptive focus on US policies.

===''Globalization and Its Discontents'' (2002)===
In ''[[Globalization and Its Discontents]]'', Stiglitz argues that what are often called "developing economies" are, in fact, not developing at all, and puts much of the blame on the IMF.

Stiglitz bases his argument on the themes that his decades of theoretical work have emphasized: namely, what happens when people lack the key information that bears on the decisions they have to make, or when markets for important kinds of transactions are inadequate or don't exist, or when other institutions that standard economic thinking takes for granted are absent or flawed. Stiglitz stresses the point: "Recent advances in economic theory" (in part referring to his own work) "have shown that whenever information is imperfect and markets incomplete, which is to say always, and especially in developing countries, then the invisible hand works most imperfectly." As a result, Stiglitz continues, governments can improve the outcome by well-chosen interventions. Stiglitz argues that when families and firms seek to buy too little compared to what the economy can produce, governments can fight recessions and depressions by using expansionary monetary and fiscal policies to spur the demand for goods and services. At the microeconomic level, governments can regulate banks and other financial institutions to keep them sound. They can also use tax policy to steer investment into more productive industries and trade policies to allow new industries to mature to the point at which they can survive foreign competition. And governments can use a variety of devices, ranging from job creation to manpower training to welfare assistance, to put unemployed labor back to work and cushion human hardship.

Stiglitz complains bitterly that the IMF has done great damage through the economic policies it has prescribed that countries must follow in order to qualify for IMF loans, or for loans from banks and other private-sector lenders that look to the IMF to indicate whether a borrower is creditworthy. The organization and its officials, he argues, have ignored the implications of incomplete information, inadequate markets, and unworkable institutions{{snd}} all of which are especially characteristic of newly developing countries. As a result, Stiglitz argues, the IMF has often called for policies that conform to textbook economics but do not make sense for the countries to which the IMF is recommending them. Stiglitz seeks to show that these policies have been disastrous for the countries that have followed them.

===''Whither Socialism?'' (1994) ===
''[[Whither Socialism?]]'' is based on Stiglitz's Wicksell Lectures, presented at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] in 1990 and presents a summary of [[information economics]] and the theory of markets with imperfect information and imperfect competition, as well as being a critique of both free market and market socialist approaches (see Roemer critique, op. cit.).  Stiglitz explains how the [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]], or [[Walrasian model]] ("Walrasian economics" refers to the result of the process which has given birth to a formal representation of [[Adam Smith]]'s notion of the "invisible hand", along the lines put forward by [[Léon Walras]] and encapsulated in the general equilibrium model of [[Arrow–Debreu model|Arrow–Debreu]]), may have wrongly encouraged the belief that [[market socialism]] could work. Stiglitz proposes an alternative model, based on the [[information economics]] established by the Greenwald–Stiglitz theorems.

One of the reasons Stiglitz sees for the critical failing in the standard [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical model]], on which [[market socialism]] was built, is its failure to consider the problems that arise from lack of perfect information and from the costs of acquiring information. He also identifies problems arising from its assumptions concerning completeness.&lt;ref name=ZAPIA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ-pol.unisi.it/pubdocenti/HEI99.pdf |author=Zapia, Carlo |title=The economics of information, market socialism and Hayek's legacy |publisher=Dipartimento di Economia Politica, Università di Siena |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614110711/http://www.econ-pol.unisi.it/pubdocenti/HEI99.pdf |archivedate=June 14, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papers and conferences===
Stiglitz wrote a series of papers and held a series of conferences explaining how such information uncertainties may have influence on everything from unemployment to lending shortages. As the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the first term of the Clinton Administration and former chief economist at the [[World Bank]], Stiglitz was able to put some of his views into action. For example, he was an outspoken critic of quickly opening up financial markets in developing countries. These markets rely on access to good financial data and sound bankruptcy laws, but he argued that many of these countries didn't have the regulatory institutions needed to ensure that the markets would operate soundly.

==Awards and honors==
In addition to being awarded the Nobel Memorial prize, Stiglitz has over 40 honorary doctorates and at least eight honorary professorships as well as an honorary deanship.&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;[http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/download/Stiglitz_CV.pdf Curriculum Vitae] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513134138/http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/download/Stiglitz_CV.pdf |date=2011-05-13 }}, Joseph E.

'''Linsey Dawn McKenzie''' (born 7 August 1978&lt;ref name=Stenson&gt;{{cite news|title=Linsey McKenzie Is Big ... And She's Getting Bigger: The Making of Britain's Latest Wild Child!|date=26 March 1995|work=The People|last=Stenson|first=Jules}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]], [[Middlesex]]&lt;ref name="search.findmypast.co.uk"/&gt;) is an English [[glamour model]], pornographic performer, and television personality who made her topless modelling debut in the ''[[Sunday Sport]]'' tabloid newspaper on her 16th birthday in 1994. Known for her naturally large 34GG breasts, she went on to feature in a wide range of adult magazines, websites, broadcast media, and videos, including [[hardcore pornography]] productions after 2000.

She has attained minor celebrity status in the United Kingdom, where she has appeared on a number of mainstream television programmes, such as ''[[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]]'', ''[[I'm Famous and Frightened!]]'', ''[[The Weakest Link]]'', and ''[[Four Weddings|Celebrity Four Weddings]]''. She has also appeared in documentaries about the lives of glamour models and was featured in [[Martin Gooch]]'s 2002 film ''Arthur's Amazing Things''.

==Career==
In early 1994 when McKenzie was 15, she sent sample glamour photographs to local modelling agencies. She began her modelling career glamour modelling and swimsuit work, intending to progress to topless modelling when she turned 16 later that year.&lt;ref name=Stenson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;At the time, under the [[Protection of Children Act 1978]], 16-year-olds could legally model topless in the United Kingdom; the legal minimum age was raised to 18 by the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Linsey dawn mckenzie.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Linsey Dawn McKenzie at Erotica LA in 2006]]
As McKenzie approached her 16th birthday, the ''[[Sunday Sport]]'' tabloid newspaper expressed an interest in turning her topless debut into a media event. Throughout June and July 1994, it published pictures of McKenzie counting down the days until it could legally show her topless.&lt;ref name=Burniston&gt;{{cite news|title=Glamour Model Says There's More to Her Than Just her 38GG assets|date=4 April 2004|work=Daily Mirror|last=Burniston|first=Julie|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/TRUTH+BEHIND+MY+PAP+PIX%3A+Linsey+Dawn+McKenzie+%60Jordan+was+a+good...-a0114896585|via=The Free Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After she turned 16, McKenzie continued to model topless for the ''[[Daily Sport]]'' and the ''Sunday Sport.'' She also made ''[[Page 3]]'' girl appearances in tabloid newspapers ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|The Daily Star]]''; posed topless in [[lads' mags]] such as ''[[Loaded (magazine)|Loaded]]''; appeared fully nude in British magazines such as ''[[Mayfair (magazine)|Mayfair]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Mayfair,'' Vol. 30, Issue 3 (March 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Men Only]]'';&lt;ref&gt;''Men Only'' Vol. 60, Issue 12 (December 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and performed in a variety of softcore videos.

On 29 July 1995, shortly before her 17th birthday, McKenzie did a topless [[streaking|streak]] at a televised [[England cricket team|England]] v. [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] [[cricket]] match at [[Old Trafford (cricket)|Old Trafford]]. Wearing only a [[thong (clothing)|thong]] and a pair of [[athletic shoes|trainers]], she ran onto the field with the words "Only Teasing" written across her breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Naked Truth About Streaking|date=9 July 2007|work=The Independent|last=McSmith|first=Andy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After McKenzie turned 18 in 1996, she made her North American modelling debut in the [[breast fetishism]] magazine ''Score'', which marked the occasion by making McKenzie the [[cover girl]] of its December 1996 "50th Anniversary" issue.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, John, "Linsey: She's Finally Legal, and Now Everybody Can Enjoy This 18-Year-Old International Superstar!" ''Score'', Volume 5, Issue 12, pg. 22–30 (December 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, McKenzie was frequently featured on the adult-oriented channels [[L!VE TV]] and [[Television X]]. She continued to appear regularly in magazines, DVDs, Internet sites, and broadcast media until late 2004, when she took a break from modelling to have a child and undergo a breast reduction operation.

'''Marcel Joseph Vogel''' (April 14, 1917 – February 12, 1991) was a research scientist working at the [[IBM]] [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] [[IBM Almaden Research Center|Research Center]] for 27 years. He is sometimes referred to as Dr. Vogel, although this title was based on an [[honorary degree]], not a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] Later in his career, he became interested in various theories of quartz crystals and other [[occult]] and esoteric fields of study. The Vogel Crystal type cut was created by him.

==Mainstream scientific work==
It is claimed that Vogel started his research into [[luminescence]] while he was still in his teens. This research eventually led him to publish his thesis, ''Luminescence in Liquids and Solids and Their Practical Application'', in collaboration with [[University of Chicago]]'s Dr. Peter Pringsheim in 1943.

Two years after the publication, Vogel incorporated his own company, Vogel Luminescence, in [[San Francisco]]. For the next decade the firm developed a variety of new products: [[fluorescent]] [[crayon]]s, tags for [[insecticide]]s, a [[black light]] inspection kit to determine the secret trackways of [[rodent]]s in cellars from their [[urine]] and the [[psychedelic color]]s popular in "[[new age]]" posters. In 1957, Vogel Luminescence was sold to Ultra Violet Products and Vogel joined IBM as a full-time research scientist. He retired from IBM in 1984.

He received 32 [[patent]]s for his inventions up through his tenure at IBM.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:cNs76uq_DdIJ:theyfly.com/PDF/Documentation%2520from%2520IBM%2520on.pdf+%22marcel+vogel%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjxmvn61yYKPI2vBzoXbA06ratPIoF7Df5x4wzNnVprT93Rln52JGdeuYSc8YfgUxsjFe8Z3TxUG_dCGyE1qu-uo0KxmMHyhflVDs3abV5ChTrNVZHPg9kW0gUcaxfi3k4lyLLL&amp;sig=AHIEtbTxH-ULFp5grKtR3fdwPXxb72ONRQ Documentation from IBM on Vogel patents, at GoogleDocs]&lt;/ref&gt; Among these was the magnetic coating for the 24" [[hard disk drive]] systems still in use. His areas of expertise, besides luminescence, were [[phosphor]] technology, [[magnetic]]s and [[liquid crystal]] systems.

At Vogel's February 14, 1991 funeral, IBM researcher and Sacramento, California physician Bernard McGinity, M.D. said of him, "He made his mark because of the brilliance of his mind, his prolific ideas, and his seemingly limitless creativity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/magnetic/team/|title=IBM100 - Magnetic Stripe Technology|work=ibm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Esoteric and occult studies==

===Billy Meier UFO metal sample===
According to the book ''Light Years'' by Gary Kinder,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billymeiertranslations.com/#contactotherbooks ''Light Years: An Investigation into the Extraterrestrial Experiences of Eduard Meier'']&lt;/ref&gt; Vogel examined a metal sample which was allegedly given to [[Billy Meier]] by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]]s and marveled at its unusual properties (Vogel stated it contained the element [[thulium]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZmBW69OO1I Beamship - The Metal&lt;/ref&gt; An investigator with the [[Independent Investigations Group]] said the element detected by Vogel was aluminum and not thulium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iigwest.org/investigations/meier/metal_analysis_deconstruction_old.html Metal Analysis Deconstruction at IIG website]&lt;/ref&gt; Kinder however states in his book that the metal sample had disappeared after Vogel's analysis and was never found again.

===Communication between plants===
Vogel said he could duplicate the "[[Cleve Backster|Backster effect]]" using plants as transducers for bio-energetic fields from the human mind, showing that they respond to human thought. He said his findings had the same effect irrespective of distance and suggested that "inverse square law does not apply to thought" (See also: [[Inverse square law]]).&lt;ref name="D'Arc2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan D'Arc|title=Phenomenal World: Remote Viewing, Astral Travel, Apparitions, Extraterrestrials, Lucid Dreams and Other Forms of Intelligent Contact in the Magical Kingdom of Mind-at-Large|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bgTG1dxoQ8kC&amp;pg=PA191|accessdate=7 August 2013|date=1 November 2000|publisher=Book Tree|isbn=978-1-58509-128-7|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vogel was a proponent of research into [[plant consciousness]]. He spurred fellow researcher [[Randall Fontes]] into furthering this work. Vogel was featured in the first episode of [[In Search of... (TV series)|In Search Of...]] hosted by [[Leonard Nimoy]], called "Other Voices". He gave his theories regarding the possibility of [[Plant consciousness|communication between plants]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://meiercase.0x2a.info/meiercase/001/article.php?id=40&amp;sn=6#4 Confusion between thallium and thulium]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mark David Chapman''' (born May 10, 1955) is an American [[murder]]er who [[Murder of John Lennon|shot and killed]] [[John Lennon]] at the entrance to [[the Dakota]] apartment building in [[New York City]] on December 8, 1980. Chapman fired five times at Lennon, hitting him four times in the back and later sat down on a nearby curb reading [[J. D. Salinger]]'s novel ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' until he was arrested by the police. He has repeatedly said that the [[novel]] was his statement.

Chapman's legal team intended to mount an [[insanity defense]] that would be based on expert testimony he was in a delusional [[psychosis|psychotic]] state at the time of the killing. As the trial approached, Chapman instructed his lawyers he wanted to plead guilty, based on his assertion of what he had decided was the will of God. After Chapman denied hearing voices, the judge allowed the plea change without further [[psychiatric assessment]] and sentenced him to a prison term of 20-years-to [[Life imprisonment in the United States|life]], with a stipulation mental health treatment would be provided. Chapman has been imprisoned ever since, having been denied [[parole]] ten times amidst campaigns against his release after he became eligible in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.apnews.com/84472dfcf77e4081a298270afdfa197d | title=Parole Denied yet Again for John Lennon's Killer | agency=[[Associated Press]] | date=August 23, 2014 | accessdate=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/08/12/chapman.no.parole/index.html | work=CNN | title=Lennon's killer denied parole again | date=August 12, 2008 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbs2010&gt;{{cite news |first=Carolyn | last=Thompson| url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2010-09-07-chapman-parole_N.htm | title =  John Lennon Killer Chapman Denied Parole In NY | work = [[USA Today]] | publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Mclean, Virginia| date = September 7, 2010 | accessdate = December 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gryta"&gt;{{cite news |first = Matt| last = Gryta  | url = http://www.buffalonews.com/city/communities/erie-county/article858049.ece | title = Lennon's killer transferred to Wende facility | newspaper = The Buffalo News | publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]|location=Buffalo, New York|date = May 15, 2012 | accessdate = May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Artemis|last1=Moshtaghian|title=Mark David Chapman, John Lennon's killer, denied parole again|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/29/us/john-lennon-mark-david-chapman-denied-parole-ninth-time/index.html|website=CNN.com|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://abc7ny.com/john-lennons-killer-denied-parole-for-a-10th-time-/4041502/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal background==
Mark David Chapman was born on May 10, 1955, in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].&lt;ref name=killer/&gt; His father, David Chapman, was a [[staff sergeant]] in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] and his mother, Diane (née Pease), was a [[Nursing|nurse]]. His younger sister, Susan, was born seven years later. As a boy, Chapman stated he lived in fear of his father, who he said was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] towards his mother and unloving towards him. Chapman began to fantasize about having king-like power over a group of imaginary "little people" who lived in the walls of his bedroom. He attended [[Columbia High School (Decatur, GA)|Columbia High School]] in [[Decatur, Georgia]]. By the time he was fourteen, Chapman was using drugs and skipping classes; he once ran away from home to live on the streets of [[Atlanta]] for two weeks. He said he was bullied at school because he was not a good athlete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=David|last=Chirko|url=http://www.apadivisions.org/division-1/publications/newsletters/general/2016/10/issue.pdf|title=Alienation: Antecedent to Mayhem|journal=[[General Psychologist]]|publisher=[[American Psychology Association]]|location=Worchester, Massachusetts|volume=51|number=1|date=November 2016|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Chapman became a [[Born again (Christianity)|born-again]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] and distributed [[tract (literature)|Biblical tracts]]. He met his first girlfriend, Jessica Blankenship. He began work as a summer camp counselor at the South De Kalb County, Georgia [[YMCA]]; he was very popular with the children, who nicknamed him "Nemo", and was made assistant director after winning an award for Outstanding Counselor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=James R.|last=Gaines|title=Descent Into Madness|url=https://people.com/archive/descent-into-madness-vol-15-no-24/|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=June 22, 1981|volume=15|number=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who knew him in the caretaking professions unanimously called him an outstanding worker.&lt;ref name="TwoMarks"&gt;Crime Library [http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/chapman/2.html Two Marks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210044824/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/chapman/2.html |date=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman read [[J.D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' on the recommendation of a friend. The novel eventually took on great personal significance for him, to the extent he reportedly wished to model his life after its [[protagonist]], [[Holden Caulfield]].&lt;ref name=People&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gaines|first1=James|title=Mark Chapman: The Man Who Shot John Lennon|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20095701,00.html|accessdate=June 16, 2016|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=February 27, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Columbia High School, Chapman moved for a time to Chicago and played guitar in churches and Christian night spots while his friend did impersonations. He worked successfully for [[World Vision International|World Vision]] with [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] refugees at a resettlement camp at Fort Chaffee in [[Arkansas]], after a brief visit to [[Lebanon]] for the same work. He was named an area coordinator and a key aide to the program director, David Moore, who later said Chapman cared deeply for the children and worked hard. Chapman accompanied Moore to meetings with government officials, and [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]] shook his hand.

Chapman joined Blankenship as a student at [[Covenant College]], an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Presbyterian [[liberal arts]] college in [[Lookout Mountain, Georgia]]. However, Chapman fell behind in his studies and became obsessed with guilt over having an affair.&lt;ref name="CLEscape"&gt;Crime Library [http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/chapman/4.html Escape to Paradise] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210044829/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/chapman/4.html |date=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaines1981"&gt;Gaines, J.R.

He dropped out of Covenant College after just one semester and his girlfriend broke off their relationship soon after. Chapman returned to work at the resettlement camp, but left after an argument. He then worked as a security guard, eventually taking a week-long course to qualify as an armed guard. After dropping out of college, Chapman went to [[Hawaii]], where he attempted suicide by [[carbon monoxide]] asphyxiation. He connected a hose to his car's exhaust pipe, but the hose melted and the attempt failed. A [[psychiatrist]] admitted Chapman to Castle Memorial Hospital for [[clinical depression]]. Upon his release, he began working at the hospital.&lt;ref name="CLMiracle"&gt;Crime Library [http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/chapman/5.html A Miracle Fades Away] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210044830/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/chapman/5.html |date=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Chapman's parents began divorce proceedings, his mother joined him in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="Gaines1981"/&gt;

In 1978, Chapman went on a six-week trip around the world; the vacation was partly inspired by the film ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (1956 film)|Around the World in Eighty Days]].'' He visited Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Delhi, Beirut, Geneva, London, Paris and Dublin. He began a relationship with his travel agent, a [[Japanese Americans|Japanese American]] woman named Gloria Abe, whom he married on June 2, 1979. Chapman went to work at Castle Memorial Hospital as a printer, working alone rather than with staff and patients. He was fired by the hospital, rehired, then got into a shouting match with a nurse and quit. Chapman then took a job as a night security guard and began drinking heavily.&lt;ref name="CLMiracle"/&gt; He developed a series of obsessions, including artwork, ''The Catcher in the Rye'', music and the musician John Lennon. In September 1980, he wrote a letter to a friend, Lynda Irish, in which he stated, "I'm going nuts." He signed the letter, "The Catcher in the Rye."&lt;ref name="brink"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGunagle|first1=Fred|title=Mark David Chapman, the Man Who Killed John Lennon, Chapter 6 To the Brink and Back|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/chapman/6.html|website=Crime Library|publisher=Court TV|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407005703/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/chapman/6.html|archivedate=7 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman had no criminal convictions prior to his trip to New York City to kill Lennon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/john-lennons-killer-mark-david-chapman-denied-parole/story?id=17064521|title=John Lennon's Killer Denied Parole|date=November 2, 2012|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter written from prison, Chapman indicated that he believed he had been forgiven by Jesus for shooting Lennon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Maryse|last=Godden|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4817491/john-lennon-death-mark-chapman-forgiven-jesus/|title=John Lennon's killer boasts he’s been forgiven by Jesus for shooting him dead|newspaper=[[The Sun (UK)|The Sun]]|date=November 1, 2017|access-date=June 20, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plan to murder John Lennon==
[[File:John Lennon portrait.jpg|thumb|Lennon in 1980, shortly before his death]]
Chapman, a [[The Beatles|Beatles]] fan who had idolized Lennon, allegedly started planning to kill him three months prior to the murder. Chapman turned against Lennon after making his religious conversion; he was angry about Lennon's well-publicized 1966 comment that Beatles were "[[more popular than Jesus]]." Some members of Chapman's [[prayer group]] made a joke in reference to Lennon's song "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]": "It went, 'Imagine, imagine if John Lennon was dead.'"&lt;ref name="Gaines1981"/&gt; Chapman's childhood friend Miles McManushe recalled he referred to the song as "[[communism|communist]]." Jan Reeves, the sister of one of Chapman's best friends, reported Chapman "seemed really angry toward John Lennon and he kept saying he could not understand why John Lennon had said [the Beatles were more popular than Jesus]. According to Mark, there should be nobody more popular than the Lord Jesus Christ. He said it was [[blasphemy]]."&lt;ref name="jones118"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Jack| title=Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, the Man Who Killed John Lennon|date=November 1992|page=118|publisher=Villard Books|isbn=0-8129-9170-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman had also been influenced by reading in a library book, [[Anthony Fawcett]]'s ''John Lennon: One Day at a Time'', about Lennon's lifestyle in New York. According to his wife Gloria, "He was angry that Lennon would preach love and peace but yet [sic] have millions [of dollars]." Chapman later said, "He told us to imagine no possessions and there he was, with millions of dollars and [[yacht]]s and farms and country estates, laughing at people like me who had believed the lies and bought the records and built a big part of their lives around his music."&lt;ref name="jlend"&gt;{{cite web|first=Lynne H.|last=Schultz|url=http://www.secweb.org/index.aspx?action=viewAsset&amp;id=73#_ednref30|title=March 4, 1966: The Beginning of the End for John Lennon?|website=The Secular Web|date=2001|accessdate=December 26, 2006|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000251/http://www.secweb.org/index.aspx?action=viewAsset&amp;id=73 |archive-date=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman said he chose Lennon after seeing him on the cover of the Beatles' album, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]].'' He also recalled having listened to Lennon's ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'' album in the weeks before the murder and has stated: "I would listen to this music and I would get angry at him, for saying that [[God (John Lennon song)|he didn't believe in God... and that he didn't believe in the Beatles]]. This was another thing that angered me, even though this record had been done at least ten years previously. I just wanted to scream out loud, 'Who does he think he is, saying these things about God and heaven and the Beatles?' Saying that he doesn't believe in Jesus and things like that. At that point, my mind was going through a total blackness of anger and rage. So I brought the Lennon book home, into this ''The Catcher in the Rye'' [[milieu]] where my mindset is Holden Caulfield and anti-phoniness."&lt;ref name="jlend"/&gt;

Chapman also said he had an alternate hit list of potential targets in mind, including [[David Bowie]], [[Johnny Carson]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[George C. Scott]] and [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], but Lennon seemed to be the easiest to find. He separately said Lennon particularly infatuated him. Chapman's planning has been described as "muddled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Wilson| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E5D6163DF934A2575AC0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=markdavidchapman|title=Lennon's Killer Said He Wavered Over Plan|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=December 23, 2011|date=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Michael S.|title=Lennon's Killer: Elizabeth Taylor Also a Target|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/john-lennon-killer-mark-david-chapman-considered-killing/story?id=11658475|work=ABC News|date=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to New York in October 1980, intending to kill Lennon, but left in order to obtain ammunition from his unwitting friend in Atlanta, Dana Reeves, before returning in November.&lt;ref name="brink"/&gt;

After being inspired by the film ''[[Ordinary People]]'', Chapman returned to Hawaii, telling his wife he had been obsessed with killing Lennon. He showed her the gun and bullets, but she did not inform the police or mental health services. Chapman made an appointment to see a [[clinical psychologist]], but he did not keep the appointment and flew back to New York on December 6, 1980.&lt;ref name="Gaines1981"/&gt; At one point, he considered ending his life by jumping from the [[Statue of Liberty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Fred|last=McGunagle|	url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/chapman/10.html |title=Exorcism at Attica |website=Crimelibrary.com |date=December 8, 1980 |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513085252/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/chapman/10.html |archivedate=May 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman says the message "Thou Shalt Not Kill" flashed on the television at him and was on a wall hanging his wife put up in their apartment. On the night before the murder, Chapman and his wife talked on the phone about getting help with his problems by first working on his relationship with God.&lt;ref name="jlend"/&gt;

On the day before the murder, Chapman accosted singer-songwriter [[James Taylor]] at the [[72nd Street (Manhattan)|72nd Street]] subway station. According to Taylor, "The guy had sort of pinned me to the wall and was glistening with maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about what he was going to do and his stuff with how John was interested and he was going to get in touch with John Lennon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Brook|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11926898 |title=Lennon's death: I was there|website=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|location=London, England|date=December 8, 2010|accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also reportedly offered [[cocaine]] to a taxi driver.&lt;ref name="Gaines1981"/&gt; On the day of the murder, Bowie was appearing on Broadway in the play ''[[The Elephant Man (play)|The Elephant Man]]''. "I was second on his list," Bowie later said. "Chapman had a front-row ticket to ''The Elephant Man'' the next night. John and Yoko were supposed to sit front-row for that show too. So the night after John was killed there were three empty seats in the front row. I can't tell you how difficult that was to go on. I almost didn't make it through the performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inthestudio.net/online-only-interviews/john-lennon-assassin-had-hitlist-david-bowie/|title=John Lennon's Assassin Had a Hit List, and David Bowie Was Next|publisher=In The Studio|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of John Lennon==
{{Main|Murder of John Lennon}}
[[File:1 West 72nd Street (The Dakota) entrance by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The main entrance to [[The Dakota]], where Lennon was shot]]
On December 8, 1980, Chapman left his room at the [[Sheraton Hotel]], leaving personal items behind the police would later find. He bought a copy of ''The Catcher in the Rye'' in which he wrote "&lt;u&gt;This&lt;/u&gt; is my statement", signing it "Holden Caulfield." He then spent most of the day near the entrance to [[the Dakota]] apartment building where Lennon lived, talking to fans and the [[doorman (profession)|doorman]]. Early in the morning, a distracted Chapman missed seeing Lennon step out of a cab and enter the Dakota. Later in the morning, he met Lennon's housekeeper who was returning from a walk with their five-year-old son [[Sean Lennon|Sean]]. Chapman reached in front of the housekeeper to shake Sean's hand and said he was a beautiful boy, quoting Lennon's song "[[Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)]]".&lt;ref name="LKW"/&gt;

[[File:Lennon and Chapman.jpg|thumb|left|Lennon autographing a copy of ''[[Double Fantasy]]'' for Chapman, six hours before the killing]]

Around 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Lennon and Ono left the Dakota for a recording session at [[Record Plant Studios]]. As they walked toward their [[limousine]], Chapman shook hands with Lennon and asked for him to sign a copy of his album, ''[[Double Fantasy]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 1980 Year in Review: Death of John Lennon | url = http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1980/Death-of-John-Lennon/12311726509558-11/}}`&lt;/ref&gt; Amateur photographer Paul Goresh took a photo of Lennon signing Chapman's album. In a later interview, Chapman said he tried to get Goresh to stay and he asked another Lennon fan who was lingering at the building's entrance to go out with him that night. He suggested if the girl had accepted his invitation or Goresh had stayed, he would not have murdered Lennon that evening, but he probably would have tried another day.&lt;ref name="LKW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Larry King Weekend: A Look Back at Mark David Chapman in His Own Words.|url=http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0009/30/lklw.00.html|website=CNN|publisher=Cable News Network|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 10:50&amp;nbsp;p.m., Lennon and Ono returned to the Dakota in a limousine. They got out of the vehicle, passed Chapman and walked toward the archway entrance of the building. From the street behind them, Chapman fired five [[hollow-point bullet]]s from a [[.38 special]] [[revolver]], four of which hit Lennon in the back and shoulder, puncturing his left [[lung]] and left [[subclavian artery]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017|reason=death certification only says 'multiple shots' and doesn't have this detail}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfmontreal.com/john_lennon/Death_Cert.htm |title=John Lennon Death Certificate |publisher=Jfkmontreal.com |accessdate=2011-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512044521/http://www.jfmontreal.com/john_lennon/Death_Cert.htm |archivedate=May 12, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, one newspaper reported before Chapman fired, he softly called out "Mr. Lennon" and dropped into a [[combat stance]].&lt;ref&gt;"Police Trace Tangled Path Leading to Lennon's Slaying at the Dakota" by Paul L.

Chapman remained at the scene and appeared to be reading ''The Catcher in the Rye'' when the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officers arrived and arrested him without incident. The [[first responder]]s recognized Lennon's wounds were severe and decided not to wait for an ambulance. They rushed the mortally wounded musician to [[Roosevelt Hospital]] in a squad car, but nothing could be done to save him. Lennon was pronounced dead by Dr. Stephan Lynn at 11:07&amp;nbsp;p.m. In his statement to police three hours later, Chapman stated, "I'm sure the big part of me is Holden Caulfield, who is the main person in the book. The small part of me must be the [[Devil]]."&lt;ref&gt;Crime Library [http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/assassins/chapman/1.html Chapman's Statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531154558/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/assassins/chapman/1.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal process ==
Chapman was charged with [[Murder|second degree murder]]. He told police he had used hollow-point bullets "because they are more deadly" and "to ensure Lennon's death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/63515296/|title=Chapman intended to kill Lennon|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|location=[[Santa Cruz, California]]|date=June 24, 1981|p=45|via=[[newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gloria Chapman, who had known of her husband's preparations for killing Lennon but took no action, was not charged. Chapman later said he harbored a "deep-seated resentment" toward his wife, "that she didn't go to somebody, even the police, and say, 'Look, my husband's bought a gun and he says he's going to kill John Lennon'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Wife+of+John+Lennon%27s+assassin+could+have+saved+the+ex-Beatle.-a0243839080 Wife of John Lennon's assassin could have saved the ex-Beatle.] Dec 8 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental state assessment===
More than a dozen psychologists and psychiatrists interviewed Chapman in the six months prior to his planned trial—three for the [[prosecution]], six for the [[defense (law)|defense]], and several more on behalf of the court. A battery of standard diagnostic procedures and over 200 hours of clinical interviews were conducted. All six defense experts concluded Chapman was [[psychotic]]; five diagnosed [[paranoid schizophrenia]], while the sixth felt his symptoms were more consistent with [[manic depression]]. The three prosecution experts declared his [[delusions]] fell short of psychosis and instead diagnosed various [[personality disorders]]. The court-appointed experts concurred with the prosecution's examiners he was delusional, yet [[Competence (law)|competent]] to stand trial. In the examinations, Chapman was more cooperative with the prosecution's mental health experts than with those for the defense, possibly (according to one psychiatrist) because he did not wish to be considered "crazy", and persuaded the defense experts only declared him insane because they were hired to do so.&lt;ref name=Gaines1987part3/&gt;

The Rev. Charles McGowan, who had been pastor of Chapman's church in Decatur, Georgia, visited Chapman as well, and told him of his conviction that it was religion that held the key to his crime. "I believe there was a [[demon]]ic power at work," he said. Chapman initially embraced his old religion with new fervor as a result; but after McGowan revealed information to the press Chapman had told him in confidence, Chapman disavowed his renewed interest in Christianity and reverted to his initial explanation: he had killed Lennon to promote the reading of ''The Catcher in the Rye''. When asked why it was so important for people to read the book, Chapman said he "didn't know" and "didn't really care either—that was not his job."&lt;ref name=Gaines1987part3/&gt;

===Guilty plea===
Chapman's first court-appointed lawyer, Herbert Adlerberg, withdrew from the case amid threats of [[lynching]]. Police feared Lennon fans might storm the hospital, so they transferred Chapman to [[Rikers Island]] for his personal safety.&lt;ref name="McGunagle"&gt;McGunagle, F. [http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/assassins/chapman/10.html Exorcism at Attica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930143824/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/assassins/chapman/10.html |date=September 30, 2013 }} Tru Tv Crime Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the initial hearing in January 1981, Chapman's new lawyer, Jonathan Marks, instructed him to enter a plea of [[insanity defence|not guilty by reason of insanity]]. In February, Chapman sent a handwritten statement to ''[[The New York Times]]'' urging everyone to read ''The Catcher in the Rye,'' calling it an "extraordinary book that holds many answers."&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, P [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9E00E1D8133BF93AA35751C0A967948260 Lennon Murder Suspect Preparing Insanity Defense.] New York Times, February 9, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense team sought to establish witnesses as to Chapman's mental state at the time of the killing.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times February 26, 1981 [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E1DF1439F935A15751C0A967948260&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print 4 Sought by Defense In Slaying of Lennon]&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported they were confident he would be found not guilty by reason of insanity, in which case he would have been committed to a state [[mental hospital]] and received treatment.

However, in June, Chapman told Marks he wanted to drop the insanity defense and plead guilty. Marks objected with "serious questions" over Chapman's sanity, and legally challenged his competence to make this decision. In the pursuant hearing on June 22, Chapman said God had told him to plead guilty and he would not change his plea or ever [[appeal]], regardless of his sentence. Marks told the court he opposed Chapman's change of plea but Chapman would not listen to him. Judge Dennis Edwards refused a further assessment, saying Chapman had made the decision of his own [[free will]], and declared him competent to plead guilty.&lt;ref name="TwoMarks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian newspaper (June 23, 1981) [https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1981/jun/23/fromthearchive Chapman admits murder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/22/newsid_2518000/2518621.stm |title=1981: Chapman pleads guilty to Lennon murder |publisher=BBC News |date= June 22, 1981|accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentencing hearing===
On August 24, 1981, the [[Sentence (law)|sentencing hearing]] took place. Two experts gave evidence on Chapman's behalf. Judge Edwards interrupted [[Dorothy Otnow Lewis|Dorothy Lewis]], a research psychiatrist who was relatively inexperienced in the courtroom, indicating the purpose of the hearing was to determine the sentence and there was no question of Chapman's criminal responsibility. Lewis had maintained Chapman's decision to change his plea did not appear reasonable or explicable, and she implied the judge did not want to allow an independent competency assessment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ANKWhsPa6lMC Guilty By Reason Of Insanity] Dorothy Otnow Lewis. Random House, 2010 (1st edition 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[district attorney]] argued Chapman committed the murder as an easy route to fame. When Chapman was asked if he had anything to say, he rose and read the passage from ''The Catcher in the Rye'', when Holden tells his little sister, Phoebe, what he wants to do with his life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around – nobody big, I mean – except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The judge ordered psychiatric treatment for Chapman during his incarceration and sentenced him to twenty-years-to-life, five years less than the maximum sentence of twenty-five-years-to-life.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian newspaper (August 25, 1981) [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1662593,00.html Lennon's killer to serve twenty years]&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman was given five years less than the maximum because he pleaded guilty to second degree murder, thereby avoiding the time and expense of a trial.

==Imprisonment==
[[File:Attica, New York (Correctional Facility).jpg|thumb|[[Attica Correctional Facility]] in [[Attica (town), New York|Attica, New York]], where Chapman was imprisoned from 1981 to 2012]]
In 1981, Chapman was imprisoned at [[Attica Correctional Facility]] outside of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. After he fasted for twenty six days in February 1982, the [[New York State Supreme Court]] authorized the state to [[force feed]] him.  Martin Von Holden, the director of the Central New York Psychiatric Center, said Chapman still refused to eat with other inmates but agreed to take liquid nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E7D8143BF931A35750C0A964948260&amp;sec=health&amp;spon= Chapman Breaks His 26-Day Fast] March 2, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman was confined to a [[solitary confinement|special handling unit]] (SHU) for violent and at-risk prisoners, in part due to concern he may be harmed by Lennon's fans in the general population. There were 105 prisoners in the building who were "not considered a threat to him," according to the [[New York State Department of Correctional Services]]. He had his own prison cell, but spent "most of his day outside his cell working on housekeeping and in the library."&lt;ref name="cnnden"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Wald|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/10/05/chapman.parole/index.html |title=Lennon killer denied parole |publisher=CNN |date= October 6, 2004|accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman worked in the prison as a legal clerk and kitchen helper. He was barred from participating in the Cephas Attica workshops, a charitable organization helping inmates adjust to life outside prison. He was also prohibited from attending the prison's violence and [[anger management]] classes due to concern for his safety. Chapman reportedly enjoys reading and writing [[short story|short stories]]. At his parole board hearing in 2004, he described his plans; "I would immediately try to find a job, and I really want to go from place to place, at least in the state, church to church, and tell people what happened to me and point them the way to Christ." He also said he thought there was a possibility he could find work as a farmhand or return to his previous trade as a printer.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/people/2000/1012/chapmantranscript.html |title=Transcript of Mark David Chapman's Parole Board hearing |publisher=Courttv.com |accessdate=2010-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221115736/http://www.courttv.com/archive/people/2000/1012/chapmantranscript.html |archivedate=February 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman is in the Family Reunion Program, and is allowed one [[conjugal visit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mark-david-chapman-allowed-conjugal-visits-wife-article-1.1140765|title=Good lovin' continues for Lennon killer|first=KENNETH|last=LOVETT|date=August 21, 2012|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a year with his wife, since he accepted [[solitary confinement]]. The program allows him to spend up to forty-eight hours alone with his wife in a specially built prison home. He also gets occasional visits from his sister, clergy, and a few friends. In 2004, James Flateau, a spokesman for the Department of Correctional Services, said Chapman had been involved in three "minor incidents" between 1989 and 1994 for delaying an inmate count and refusing to follow an order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2002/10/09/134608.php#20021009134608 |title=Lennon Killer Chapman Denied Parole |publisher=Blogcritics.org |accessdate=2010-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427152540/http://blogcritics.org/archives/2002/10/09/134608.php |archivedate=April 27, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 15, 2012, Chapman was transferred to the [[Wende Correctional Facility]] in [[Alden, New York]], which is east of Buffalo.

==Parole applications and campaigns==
Chapman first became eligible for [[parole]] in 2000. Under New York state law, he is required to have a parole hearing every two years from that year onwards. Since that time, a three-member board has denied Chapman parole ten times. Shortly before Chapman's first hearing, Yoko Ono sent a letter to the board opposing his release from prison.&lt;ref&gt;CNN Assignment Editor Jonathan Wald writes on CNN.com on October 6, 2004 about [http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/10/05/chapman.parole/index.html Ono's consistent opposition to parole]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/955216.stm |title=Text of Ono's 2000 letter sent to parole hearings, from the BBC |publisher=BBC News |date=October 3, 2000 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[New York State Senate|New York State Senator]] [[Michael Nozzolio]], chairman of the Senate Crime Victims, Crime and Correction Committee, wrote to Parole Board Chairman Brion Travis saying: "It is the responsibility of the New York State Parole Board to ensure that public safety is protected from the release of dangerous criminals like Chapman."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/law.and.entertainment/10/03/chapman.parole.02/index.html John Lennon's killer denied parole] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325203023/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/law.and.entertainment/10/03/chapman.parole.02/index.html |date=March 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeline===
* At the 50-minute hearing in 2000, Chapman said he was not a danger to society and that Lennon would have approved of his release. The parole board concluded releasing Chapman would "deprecate the seriousness of the crime and serve to undermine respect for the law" and that Chapman's granting of media interviews represented a continued interest in "maintaining [his] notoriety." They noted although Chapman had a good disciplinary record while in prison, he had been in solitary confinement and did not access "anti-violence and/or anti-aggression programming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starbulletin.com/2000/10/03/news/story3.html |title=Parole denied to Lennon killer Mark Chapman |publisher=Starbulletin.com |date=October 3, 2000 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Gangi, a lawyer for the Correctional Association of New York, said he thought it unlikely Chapman would ever be freed because the board would not risk the "political heat" of releasing John Lennon's killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/955074.stm |title=Lennon killer denied parole |publisher=BBC News |date=October 3, 2000 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2002, the parole board stated again releasing Chapman after twenty-two years in prison would "deprecate the seriousness" of the crime, and while his behavioral record continued to be positive, it was no predictor of his potential community behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.instantkarma.com/instantnewssepoct02.html |title=instantkarma.com |publisher=instantkarma.com |accessdate=2010-10-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018112016/http://www.instantkarma.com/instantnewssepoct02.html# |archive-date=October 18, 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The parole board held a third hearing in 2004, and declined parole yet again. One of the reasons given by the board was Chapman had subjected Ono to "monumental suffering by her witnessing the crime." Another factor was concern for Chapman's safety; several Lennon fans threatened to kill him upon his release. Ono's letter opposing his release stated Chapman would not be safe outside of prison. The board reported its decision was based on the interview, a review of records and deliberation.&lt;ref name="cnnden"/&gt; By this time, approximately 6,000 people had signed an [[online petition]] opposing Chapman's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Harris in New York |url=https://www.theguardian.com/thebeatles/story/0,,1313883,00.html |title=Lennon fans threaten his killer as release looms |work=The Guardian |date= September 26, 2004|accessdate=2010-10-08 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2010, in advance of Chapman's scheduled sixth parole hearing, Ono said she would again oppose parole for Chapman stating her safety, that of John's sons, and Chapman's would be at risk. She added, "I am afraid it will bring back the nightmare, the chaos and confusion [of that night] once again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/07/27/Killer-of-John-Lennon-makes-parole-bid/UPI-81271280250987/ |title =  Yoko Ono opposes parole for John Lennon's killer |work = UPI.com |date = July 27, 2010 |accessdate = August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parole board postponed the hearing in September, stating it was awaiting the receipt of additional information to complete Chapman's record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/11/john-lennon-mark-chapman |last = Swash |first = Rosie |title = John Lennon's killer has parole hearing date postponed |newspaper = The Guardian |location = London |date = August 11, 2010 |accessdate = August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 7, the board denied Chapman's latest parole application, with the panel stating "release remains inappropriate at this time and incompatible with the welfare of the community."&lt;ref name=cbs2010/&gt;

* Chapman's eighth parole application was denied in 2014. At the hearing, Chapman said, "I am sorry for being such an idiot and choosing the wrong way for glory...I found my peace in Jesus. I know him. He loves me. He has forgiven me. He has helped in my life like you wouldn't believe."

Gaines]] interviewed him and wrote a three-part, 18,000-word [[People magazine|''People'' magazine]] series in February and March 1987.&lt;ref name="Gaines1987part3"&gt;Gaines, James R [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20095787,00.html Mark Chapman Part III: the Killer Takes His Fall] People Magazine, March 09, 1987 Vol.27 No.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaines1987part1"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=James R.|last=Gaines|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20095701,00.html|title=Mark Chapman Part I: the Man Who Shot Lennon|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=February 23, 1987|volume=27|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaines1987part2"&gt;{{cite magazineJames R.|last=Gaines|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20095745,00.html|title=Mark Chapman Part II: In the Shadows a Killer Waited|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City| date=March 2, 1987|volume=27|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman told the parole board he regretted the interview. He later gave a series of audio-taped interviews to Jack Jones of the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] ''[[Democrat and Chronicle]].'' In 1992, Jones published a book, ''Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, the Man Who Killed John Lennon''.&lt;ref name="Jones book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Jack|title=Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, the Man Who Killed John Lennon|date=November 1992|publisher=Villard Books|location=New York City|isbn=0-8129-9170-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1992, Chapman gave two television interviews. On December 4, 1992, ABC's ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'' aired an interview he gave to [[Barbara Walters]], his first television interview since the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|ZZ865N6vdDE|Excerpt from Chapman's Interview with Barbara Walters (1992)}}.  Retrieved on July 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 17, 1992, [[Larry King]] interviewed Chapman on his [[CNN]] program ''[[Larry King Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|1aJUyHrc9Gc|Chapman's Interview with Larry King (1992)}}.  Retrieved on July 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, with his first parole hearing approaching, Jones asked Chapman to tell his story for ''Mugshots'', a [[CourtTV]] program. Chapman refused to go on camera but, after praying over it, consented to tell his story in a series of audiotapes.

Chapman's experiences during the weekend on which he committed the murder have been turned into a feature-length movie called ''[[Chapter 27 (film)|Chapter 27]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doXVSnZsNxg|title=Chapter 27|first=Giorgi|last=Zakariadze|date=May 15, 2013|publisher=|via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he is played by [[Jared Leto]]. The film was written and directed by [[Jarrett Schaefer]] and is based on Jones' book. The film's title is a reference to ''The Catcher in the Rye'', which has 26 chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Andrew|last=Male|title=The movie camera turns on John Lennon's murderer|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=September 2007|issue=169|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chapter 27'' premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2007, and had a limited release in U.S. theaters in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Peace Arch Entertainment's 'Chapter 27' Wins Debut Feature Prize at Zurich Film Festival for Director Jarret Shaeffer: Financial News – Yahoo! Finance, October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chapter 27'' was released widely onto DVD on September 30, 2008. Another film, entitled ''[[The Killing of John Lennon]]'' starring [[Jonas Ball]] as Chapman, documents Chapman's life before and up to the murder. The film features Ball as Chapman narrating the film and states that all the words are Chapman's own.

A number of [[conspiracy theories]] have been published, based on [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] surveillance of Lennon due to his left-wing activism, and on the actions of Chapman in the murder or subsequent legal proceedings. Barrister and journalist Fenton Bresler&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/dec/18/pressandpublishing.guardianobituaries Fenton Bresler]", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; raised the idea in a book published in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Fenton Bresler (1990) ''Who Killed John Lennon?'' St. Martin's Press {{ISBN|0-312-92367-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liverpool]] playwright Ian Carroll, who has staged a drama conveying the theory Chapman was manipulated by a rogue wing of the CIA, suggests he was not so insane he could not manage a long trip from Hawaii to New York shortly prior to the murder.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Jones (2010) [http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-entertainment/echo-entertainment/2010/08/06/playwright-ian-carroll-brings-his-john-lennon-conspiracy-play-one-bad-thing-back-to-liverpool-100252-27007771/ Playwright Ian Carroll brings his John Lennon conspiracy play One Bad Thing back to Liverpool] Liverpool Echo&lt;/ref&gt; Claims include Chapman was a "[[Manchurian candidate]]", including speculation on links to the CIA's [[Project MKULTRA]]. At least one author has argued [[forensic evidence]] proves Chapman did not commit the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Salvador|last=Astrucia|title=Rethinking John Lennon's Assassination- the FBI's War on Rock Stars|publisher=Ravening Wolf Publishing Company|location=Gaithersburg, Maryland|date=2006|ISBN=0-9744882-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, [[Rhino Records]] released a compilation of Beatles-related novelty and parody songs, called ''[[Beatlesongs]]''. It featured a cover caricature of Chapman by William Stout. Following its release, Rhino recalled the record and replaced it with another cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rutlemania.org/lean3.html |title=The Rhino Controversy |accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York-based band [[Mindless Self Indulgence]] released a track entitled "Mark David Chapman" on their album ''[[If (Mindless Self Indulgence album)|If]]''. Irish band [[the Cranberries]] recorded a song called "[[I Just Shot John Lennon]]" for their 1996 album ''[[To the Faithful Departed]]'', citing events that took place outside the Dakota on the night of Lennon's murder. The title of the song comes from Chapman's own words.

[[Austin, Texas]]-based [[art rock]] band [[...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead]] have also released a song called "Mark David Chapman" from their 1999 album ''[[Madonna (...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead album)|Madonna]]''. [[Julian Cope]]'s 1988 album ''Autogeddon'' contains a song called "Don't Call Me Mark Chapman" whose lyrics suggest it is told from the point of view of Lennon's murderer. Filipino band [[Rivermaya]] released a song called "Hangman (I Shot the Walrus)" on their album ''[[Atomic Bomb (album)|Atomic Bomb]]'' (1997), supposedly written from Chapman's point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLONKBN5u8E |title=Rivermaya│Hangman [I Shot The Walrus |publisher=YouTube |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman's obsession with the central character and message of ''The Catcher in the Rye'' added to controversy about the novel. Some links have been drawn between Chapman and the book's themes of adolescent [[Sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]] and depression on the one hand, and anti-social and violent thoughts on the other. This connection was made in the play ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (play)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'' and its film adaptation by the character played by [[Will Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenation.com/article/158072/ballad-john-and-jd-john-lennon-and-jd-salinger | title=The Ballad of John and J.D.: On John Lennon and J.D. Salinger | work=The Nation | date=January 2011 | accessdate=December 23, 2011 | author=Charles Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Links have sometimes been drawn between Chapman's actions and those of other killers or attempted killers. After [[John Hinckley]] [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|tried to assassinate]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] - less than four months after Lennon's murder - police found a copy of ''Catcher in the Rye'' among his personal belongings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stuart Jr.|last=Taylor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/06/us/hinckley-jury-told-of-notes-and-letters-by-defendant.html|title=HINCKLEY JURY TOLD OF NOTES AND LETTERS BY DEFENDANT|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=May 6, 1982|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that Hinckley mourned Lennon's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/15/us/tape-by-hinckley-is-said-to-reveal-obsession-with-slaying-of-lennon.html|title=TAPE BY HINCKLEY IS SAID TO REVEAL OBSESSION WITH SLAYING OF LENNON|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|agency=Associated Press|date=May 15, 1981|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Hinckley's father, John Hinckley, Sr, was president of World Vision, for whom Chapman was employed. A writer who experienced mental illness in the same city as [[Jared Loughner]] has suggested examples such as Chapman's show the need to challenge [[social stigma|stigma]] about mental health problems and ensure there are good [[community mental health services]] including [[crisis intervention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Randy | last=Beaver | url=http://www.pressherald.com/opinion/where-was-mental-health-crisis-care-before-tucson-tragedy-happened__2011-01-11.html | title=Maine Voices: Where was mental health crisis care before Tucson tragedy happened? | newspaper=[[The Portland Press Herald]] | date=January 2011 | accessdate=December 23, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905181926/http://www.pressherald.com/opinion/where-was-mental-health-crisis-care-before-tucson-tragedy-happened__2011-01-11.html# | archive-date=September 5, 2012 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto Hermann Wilhelm Moll'''&lt;ref&gt;http://pamiec.pl/pa/form/r4690305332929,MOLL.html&lt;/ref&gt; was an ''SS-Hauptscharführer'' and part of the staff at [[Auschwitz]]. Born in Hohen Schönberg, Germany on March 4, 1915 and was executed on May 28, 1946 in [[Landsberg am Lech]].

Moll joined the SS on May 1, 1935 (serial number 277670).&lt;ref&gt;http://pamiec.pl/pa/form/r4690305332929,MOLL.html&lt;/ref&gt; He held various posts during his tenure at [[Auschwitz]]. A gardener by trade&lt;ref&gt;http://pamiec.pl/pa/form/r4690305332929,MOLL.html&lt;/ref&gt;, from May 1941 until January 1945 Moll was Kommandoführer of the gardeners work detail, director of the employment service in the men's camp, head of the crematoria in [[Birkenau]], Lagerführer of the [[Fürstengrube]] subcamp in [[Wesola]] near Myslowice and of the Gleiwitz 1 sub-camp in [[Gliwice]].

In May 1941, Otto Moll was transferred from the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] to Birkenau where he was put in charge of digging the mass graves. From 1943 to the evacuation of the camp, Moll was chief of the crematoria. [[Alter Feinsilber]], a member of the [[Sonderkommando]] at Birkenau who worked under Otto Moll's supervision, mentioned Moll in his testimony for the prosecution in a Kraków court:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It happened that some prisoners offered resistance when about to be shot at the pit or that children would cry and then SS Quartermaster Sergeant Moll would throw them alive into the flames of the pit.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{primary-inline|date=July 2012}}

==Witness evidence==
According to the former Sonderkommando prisoner [[Henryk Tauber]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hauptscharführer Moll was the most degenerate of the lot. Before his arrival at the camp, he was in charge of the work at the Bunkers, where they incinerated the gassed victims in pits. Then he was transferred for a while to another section. In view of the preparation necessary for the "reception" of convoys from Hungary in 1944, he was put in charge of all the crematoria. It is he who organized the large-scale extermination of the people arriving in these convoys. Just before the arrival of the Hungarian transports, he ordered pits to be dug alongside crematoria V and restarted the activity of Bunker 2, which had been lying idle, and its pits. In the yard of the crematory, there were notices on posts, with inscriptions telling the new arrivals from the transports that they were to go to the camp where work was waiting for them, but that first they had to take a bath and undergo disinfestation. For that, it was necessary for them to undress and put all their valuables in baskets specially placed for this purpose in the yard. Moll repeated the same thing in his speeches to the new arrivals. There were so many convoys that sometimes it happened that the gas chambers were incapable of containing all the new arrivals. The excess people were generally shot, one at a time and often by Moll himself. On several occasions, Moll threw people into the flaming pits alive. He also practised shooting people from a distance. He ill-treated and beat Sonderkommando prisoners, treating them like animals. Those who were in his personal service told us that he used a piece of wire to fish out gold objects from the box containing the jewels taken from new arrivals, and took them off in a briefcase. Among the objects left by the people who came to be gassed, he took furs and different types of food, in particular fat. When he took food, he said smilingly to the SS around him that one had to take advantage before the lean years came. Under his direction, the Sonderkommando was strengthened and increased to about 1000 prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Pressac, Jean-Claude, (1989) [http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/pressac/technique-and-operation/pressac0496.shtml ''AUSCHWITZ: Technique and Operation of the Gas Chambers''], Beate Klarsfeld Foundation (p.496)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{primary-inline|date=July 2012}}.

SS Hauptscharführer Otto Moll is said to have personally killed thousands of innocent victims (over 20 thousand according to some reports) during his time at Auschwitz-Birkenau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Gabor|last1=Kadar|first2=Vagi|last2=Zoltan|title=Self-Financing Genocide: The Gold Train, the Becher Case and the Wealth of Hungarian Jews|year=2004|publisher=Central European University Press|location=Budapest|isbn=9639241539|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the infamous Auschwitz Kommandant Rudolf Höss, he and Sergeant Major Moll were both decorated by the Führer with the Cross of Merit, First Class, with Swords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Höss|first=Rudolf|title=Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz|year=1992|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, NY|isbn=0-87975-714-0|pages=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not this is true has yet to be proven.

Otto Moll was transferred to a sub-camp of Dachau after Auschwitz-Birkenau was abandoned by the SS on January 18, 1945. On April 28, 1945, one day before the Dachau camp was liberated by American soldiers, Moll arrived at the main camp, along with a group of prisoners that he had led on an evacuation "[[death march (Holocaust)|death march]]." Moll was put on trial by an American Military Tribunal at Dachau in November 1945. He was charged with not allowing the prisoners to escape from the death march, which was a war crime, according to the Allies. He was executed on May 28, 1946 at the Landsberg am Lech prison.

Moll appears several times in the [[Höcker Album|photo album]] of [[Karl-Friedrich Höcker]] of camp staff at a retreat.

He always said to his man: "''Befehl ist Befehl''!" ("An order is an order!"). This famous quote was made by scores of Nazis regardless of their rank when trying to justify or excuse themselves for their behavior. Unsurprisingly, these words were spoken at one time or another by a number of defendants at the Nuremberg Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;See: Heller, Kevin Jon (2011).

'''Pauline Bailey Hancock''' (1903 &amp;ndash; October 19, 1962) was the founder of the [[Church of Christ (Hancock)]] in [[Independence, Missouri]] in 1946, and was the first woman to found and lead a [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|denomination]] in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].&lt;ref name="Shield"&gt;{{Citation |last=Shields |first=Steven |title=Divergent Paths of the Restoration |publication-place=Independence, Missouri |publisher=Restoration Research |year=1990 |edition=Fourth |isbn=0-942284-00-3|pages=152–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A former member of the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] and then later the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]], Hancock was excommunicated from the Temple Lot church in 1946,&lt;ref name="Shield"/&gt; due to differences between her view of the [[God in Mormonism|Godhead]] and theirs.  She later claimed a vision of [[Jesus Christ]], whom she claimed had told her to "go and teach," leading her to found her own church in 1946.  She would lead this church until her death in 1962.

==Early life and Latter Day Saint heritage==
Pauline Hancock was a member of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now called the [[Community of Christ]]), whose father had been a minister of that denomination in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]].  During the [[Supreme Directional Control]] controversy of the 1920s, she opposed President [[Frederick M. Smith]]'s attempt to take "supreme directional control" over the RLDS church; she later transferred her membership to the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]].  In 1935, following the excommunication of her friend Apostle Samuel Wood of the Temple Lot church (who was expelled for believing in a [[Modalism|modalistic]] view of the Godhead, a view Hancock supported), Hancock resigned from that organization.

==Seeing a vision==
Hancock later claimed to have had a vision in which God told her to "go and teach others."  Her account of this vision is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I was reading in our living room, when all of a sudden I saw a marvelous vision. It seemed that I was taken to Jerusalem and I saw a man seated upon what looked like a stool. All around and about him, men were mocking, bowing and making fun of this individual.... I continued to watch as he was condemned to death and a crown of thorns was placed on his head.... I knew that there was nothing good in me except God had put it there.... I knew I had to have this Jesus or die.... I fell upon my knees and prayed to God through Jesus and His shed blood, to be forgiven of my sins.... When my prayer was finished, God baptized me with His own spirit and my soul was on fire with love towards God and mankind - I became a new creature....

God spoke to me then and said: 'Now go and teach all people what I have shown you - for I am the way.' I answered Him that I couldn't do that and He said, 'I will be with you.' I said, 'I am a woman and they won't receive me.' He said, 'I wasn't a woman and they didn't receive me - go teach and I'll be with you.'

Blessed by the name of God. Yes, He calls women. He called me".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Founding a church==
Hancock subsequently founded her own organization to propagate her teachings and visions, which included one of [[Jesus]] being crucified that led her to believe she had become "a new creature".  Hancock's organization rejected the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] of their parent church, as well as the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]] used by the [[LDS Church]], retaining only the [[King James Bible]] and the [[Book of Mormon]].  She adopted a [[Modalism|modalistic]] view of [[God]], insisting that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit were merely manifestation of the same, one God.  The organization bought property in Independence and built a submerged sanctuary that became locally known as the "basement church" because most of it was underground.  

Hancock exercised functions normally reserved solely to men during this time in Latter Day Saint history, such as performing [[baptism]]s and administering other [[sacraments|ordinances]], as well as preaching.  She did not claim any formal title, but remained the undisputed leader of her church from its founding until the time of her death.

==Death and aftermath==
Hancock died in 1962, still accepting the Book of Mormon as a valid work of scripture.  However, following her death members of her church, including [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]], began to question the authenticity of the Book of Mormon, which led to Hancock's church rejecting it in 1973.  Her church continued to function for a time strictly as a [[Protestant]] denomination, but later chose to dissolve itself in 1984, after which its members mostly joined with various [[Evangelical Protestant]] churches.  Hancock's "basement church" was used by a Protestant church for a time, but was later sold to a local [[Restoration Branch]], which constructed an above-ground sanctuary atop the old structure.

Starting out as a captain under the command of [[Petar Dobrnjac]], Paulj was elevated to ''vojvoda'' (general) in the Gornja Mlava region upon showing his courage.

He was born in the village of [[Melnica, Petrovac|Melnica]],{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=331}} at that time part of the [[Požarevac]] ''[[Nahiye (Ottoman)|nahiya]]'' in the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] ("Belgrade Pashaluk").

He became a ''buljubaša'' (captain) already by the beginning of the uprising, appointed by [[Petar Dobrnjac]].{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=331}} For his courage and other great traits, he was later appointed ''vojvoda'' (general) in Gornja Mlava.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=331}} Paulj participated in the victories in the eastern parts of the [[Belgrade Pashaluk]] that strengthened rebel holding.{{sfn|Stojančević|2004|p=37}}

A rebel army led by commanders [[Miloje Petrović]], Petar Dobrnjac, [[Ilija Barjaktarević]], Paulj Matejić, [[Stevan Sinđelić]] and [[Hajduk-Veljko|Veljko Petrović]] arrived on {{OldStyleDateNY|27 April|15 April}} 1809 outside [[Niš]].{{sfn|Stojančević|2004|p=121}} During preparations for the takeover of Niš, Paulj made a [[trench]] above the village of [[Kamenica, Niš|Kamenica]].{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=331}} The trench, above the church, had two cannons.{{sfn|Mirčetić|1994|p=68}} It was one of eleven or twelve rebel trenches around the city.{{sfn|Mirčetić|1994|p=61}} On {{OldStyleDateNY|31 May|19 May}}, when the Ottomans [[Battle of Čegar|rushed on the Čegar hill]] defended by [[Stevan Sinđelić]], and ''vojvoda'' Miloje did not let anybody aid them, Paulj decided against the command and went for Čegar.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=331}} Paulj did not reach in time; when the Ottomans had surrounded and overtook Sinđelić's trench, he decided to blow up the gunpowder magazine and kill everyone on the hill.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=331}} Paulj and his small unit were defeated and forced to retreat, as others, to [[Deligrad]].{{sfn|Milićević|1888|pp=331–332}} He mostly stayed in Deligrad after this.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=332}} The [[Serbian Ruling Council]] appointed Paulj the first permanent commander of [[Knjaževac|Gurgusovac (Knjaževac)]] after the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)]].{{sfn|Stojančević|1983|p=40}}

In the 1812–13 ''Protocol'' of [[Karađorđe]], there are ten numbers written for Paulj.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=332}} In 1813, he fled to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], while the Austrians sent him to stay in [[Leoben]] for a time.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=332}} He returned to Serbia in 1815, and died in his home village.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=332}}

He begged for the hand of the daughter of [[Momir of Lučica]] for his son Budimir,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milićević|first=Milan|authorlink=Milan Milićević|year=1901|title=Додатак поменику од 1888.

==Legacy==
There is a Serbian cultural association named after him. A statue of his was erected in his home village Melnica in 2004. A water mill in his ownership is today a recognized [[Cultural Heritage of Serbia|cultural monument]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4314">'''Ralph Lundsten''' is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] composer of [[electronic music]], as well as a [[film director]], [[artist]] and [[author]].

He was born on 6 October 1936 in [[Ersnäs]], [[Norrbotten]], in northern Sweden, and now lives in [[Nacka]] on the outskirts of [[Stockholm]], still close to the forest and the sea. His home is Castle Frankenburg, a pink wooden mansion dating from 1878 which also houses his electronic music studio, Andromeda Studio.

Since 1959 he has lived an independent life, creating his own personal [[musical language]], and preparing original films and exhibitions. His song ''Out in the Wide World'' serves as the signature tune for [[SR International - Radio Sweden|Radio Sweden International]] broadcasts.

During the 1950s Ralph Lundsten built his own electronic musical instruments and was one of the first pioneers in this field.

''Rappang'' is a village in the Panca Rijang District, [[Sidenreng Rappang Regency]] in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The village is located {{convert|32.7|km}} north east of [[Pare-Pare]].

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Afgeladangd terrein beplant met maïs Rappang TMnr 10011024.jpg|thumb|left]]
The word '''Rappang''' is derived from the [[Buginese language|Buginese]] word ''Rappeng'', means a washed away branch/twig. In the ancient times, the ''Saddang'' river flowing in Rappang was quite wide and had great torrent with a dense wood in the upstream. When the rainy season had arrived, the branches of the trees were washed away and formed the mainland, became a place of settlement and later was named ''Rappang''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rappang.com/2009/12/kerajaan-sidenreng.html| title=Sejarah Sidenreng &amp; Rappang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Kingdoms===
Historically, there were two kingdoms, one was Sidenreng kingdom and another one was Rappang. Both kingdoms were very intimate, so it is hard to find clear demarcation. Even in matters of royal reigns, both could co-exist. Many Times, the tribal chief of Sidenreng took the seat of the Rappang kingdom and vice versa. People in two kingdoms used the same dialect and daily conversational language was also similar. The main difference is its geographical location.  Rappang region occupied the northern position, while the kingdom of Sidenreng located in the southern part.

At the time of recognition of the sovereignty of the [[Indonesia|Republik Indonesia]] by the [[Netherlands]] on December 27, 1949, both the Kingdom of Rappang and Sidenreng also ended. During the time, the kingdom of Sidenreng was one of the earliest to indicate its nationalism by giving up its kingdom system, although the system had been long with 21 times changes of leaders. They chose to change and blend into Indonesian state administration system. The kingdoms eventually melt into Sidenreng Rappang Regency, with its first regent was H. Andi Sapada Mapangile.  On October 29, 2008 people of Sidenreng and Rappang  direct-voted their [[bupati]] for the first time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5394">'''Robert Jonathan Schifreen''' (born October 1963) is a former UK-based computer hacker and magazine editor, and the founder of IT security awareness training programme SecuritySmart.co.uk. He was the first person charged with illegally accessing a computer system, but was acquitted because there was no such specific criminal offence at the time. Later in life he became a computer security consultant, speaking at many conferences on information security and training banks, large companies and universities in the UK on IT security. In 2014 he began developing the software on which SecuritySmart runs from scratch which reached completion and product launch in June 2016.

==SecuritySmart.co.uk==
{{Main article|SecuritySmart.co.uk}}
The idea of SecuritySmart.co.uk came to Robert after speaking to many CISOs at conferences and repeatedly hearing that the biggest problem with traditional methods of IT security training was that they lacked any tangible way of measuring success. SecuritySmart is a micro-learning platform which sends an email a week to trainees on one security-related topic, ending in a multiple choice question to test trainee understanding.

He was arrested in 1985 for hacking into a [[British Telecom]] computer and accessing the [[Telecom Gold]] emails of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]]. As there was no specific law against hacking at this time, in June 1985 he became (together with his co-defendant, [[Steve Gold]]) one of the first two people to be charged under section 1 of the [[Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981]] with forgery which deceived a non-human target.&lt;ref&gt;"Two face computer charge", ''The Times'', 13 June 1985, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; When the case came to trial in April 1986, Schifreen was said to have used an unprotected top level account identified as "2222222222" with a password of "1234"; Schifreen was said to have admitted obtaining user passwords but denied doing so for personal gain and said that his activities prompted Prestel to increase security.&lt;ref&gt;"Prestel password 'blunder helped hacker'", ''The Times'', 16 April 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 April 1986 Schifreen was convicted on six counts of forgery and fined £750.&lt;ref&gt;"Hacker who broke into Duke's computer file found guilty of forgery", ''The Times'', 25 April 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeal==
Schifreen's appeal to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] was heard by three judges including the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|Lord Lane]]; judgment was given on 21 July 1987, and found that the use of a charge of forgery was inappropriate and that an application that the charges should be dismissed as giving no case to answer should succeed. The judgment expressed the hope that "the [[Procrustes|Procrustean]] attempt to force the facts into the language of an Act not designed to fit them" would not be repeated.&lt;ref name="Appeal"&gt;'Hacking' into Prestel is not a Forgery Act offence" (Law Report), ''The Times'', 21 July 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law Lords==
The Crown then appealed to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], but the appeal was turned down in April 1988.&lt;ref&gt;"Computer 'hacking' is not forgery" (Law Report), ''The Times'', 22 April 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The Law Lords agreed that the "making of a false instrument", a key part of proving a forgery case, revolved around the production of a "memory segment" with false information; as the computer had created this rather than Schifreen himself, the computer had effectively "forged itself".&lt;ref name="BCS interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.bcs.org/bulletin/sept02/intervie.htm  |title=BCS Computer Bulletin: September 2002 Interview |work=[[British Computer Society]] |accessdate=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case led to introduction of the [[Computer Misuse Act 1990]].&lt;ref name="BCS interview" /&gt;

==Later life==
After his acquittal, Schifreen had to take a [[judicial review]] action against the police for the return of his computers.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Grossman, "The strong arm of the law", ''The Guardian'', 22 September 1994, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; For some years, Schifreen was the editor of ''[[.EXE Magazine]]'', a magazine for programmers. '&lt;tt&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/tt&gt;', his online name (shortened from the punning 'hex maniac'), was an active [[CIX]]en from the late 1980s, at a time when [[online community|online communities]] were still a rare novelty.

Schifreen now lives in East Sussex working as an IT security trainer and web developer at the [[University of Brighton]] and runs an IT security consultancy. He regularly speaks at conferences and writes articles for the computer press and other publications. In 2006, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] published his book, ''Defeating the Hacker''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defeatingthehacker.com/author.htm|title=Robert Schifreen - biography|accessdate=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scott Gilmore''' is a Canadian [[social entrepreneur]], former diplomat, and writer who is known for founding the charity [[Peace Dividend Trust|Building Markets]] and as an advocate for reform in the international development and charity sectors.&lt;ref name="Transformational Cdn" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Gilmore was born in northern [[Manitoba]], the son of hockey player [[Tom Gilmore (ice hockey)|Tom Gilmore]] and Collette Gilmore. He is the brother of actor [[Patrick Gilmore (actor)|Patrick Gilmore]]. Gilmore grew up in [[Edmonton, Alberta]] where he obtained a Bachelor of Commerce degree at the [[University of Alberta]].&lt;ref name=Pilger&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pilger|first1=Rick|title=Putting Money Where It Matters Most|url=http://newtrail.ualberta.ca/featurestories/scottgilmore|website=http://ualberta.ca|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later graduated with a master's degree from the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name="Transformational Cdn" /&gt;

==Career==

Gilmore was a Canadian diplomat who began his career in Jakarta. From that post he covered the East Timor conflict and later joined the [[United Nations]] peacekeeping mission [[UNTAET]] under [[Sergio de Mello]]. In that role he became disillusioned with ineffective donor efforts to fight poverty. Based on this experience he quit his job as a diplomat in 2004 to launch the charity [[Peace Dividend Trust|Building Markets]].&lt;ref name="This Mag"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Graham F.|title=Interview with Peace Dividend Trust's Scott Gilmore|url=http://this.org/blog/2010/01/19/interview-scott-gilmore/|accessdate=26 October 2014|agency=This Magazine|date=January 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus on entrepreneurship instead of aid as a sustainable poverty solution.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carlyle|first1=Erin|title=Building Markets: Meet The Start-Up Bringing Investors To The Fastest-Growing Economies in the World|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erincarlyle/2013/11/17/building-markets-meet-the-start-up-bringing-investors-to-the-fastest-growing-economies-in-the-world/|accessdate=26 October 2014|publisher=Forbes Magazine|date=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Gilmore led a [[World Bank]] study to trace spending in peacekeeping missions that revealed only 5% of donor money entered the local economies. Based on those findings Gilmore launched a project in Afghanistan to channel international spending through local small businesses. This approach was successful and expanded to other countries.&lt;ref name="Transformational Cdn" /&gt; Building Market's "buy local" policy was officially adopted by [[NATO]], the United States government, and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=Pilger /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO Afghan First Policy|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_62851.htm|website=NATO|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Gilmore was appointed to by the External Advisory Group overseeing the merger of the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (Canada)|Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]] with the [[Canadian International Development Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blanchfield|first1=Mike|title=Paradis defends mining exec on advisory panel on international aid|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/935875/paradis-defends-mining-exec-on-advisory-panel-on-international-aid/|accessdate=27 October 2014|publisher=Global News|date=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously been supportive of the merger.&lt;ref name="CIDA Merger"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berthiaume|first1=Lee|title=CIDA merger meets with controversy|url=http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/archives/story.html?id=debacf11-51f7-45c8-be14-44eddda98579|accessdate=27 October 2014|publisher=Vancouver Sun|date=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Gilmore began writing a weekly column for the Canadian week national newsmagazine ''[[Maclean's]]''.&lt;ref name=Macleans&gt;{{cite web|title=Maclean's Magazine|url=http://www.macleans.ca/author/scottgilmore/|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Serge Lang''' ({{IPA-fr|lɑ̃ɡ|lang}}; May 19, 1927 – September 12, 2005) was a French-American [[mathematician]] and activist. He is known for his work in [[number theory]] and for his mathematics textbooks, including the influential ''Algebra''. He was a member of the [[Bourbaki group]]. At the time of his death he was [[professor emeritus]] of mathematics at [[Yale University]].

==Biography==
Serge Lang was born in [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] close to [[Paris]] in 1927. Serge had a twin brother who became a basketball coach and a sister who became an actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| editor1-last=Jorgenson| editor1-first=Jay| editor2-last=Krantz| editor2-first=Steven G. | editor2-link=Steven G. Krantz | date=May 2006 | title=Serge Lang, 1927–2005| url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200605/fea-lang.pdf|format=PDF| journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]| volume=53| issue=5| pages=536&amp;ndash;553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lang moved with his family to [[California]] as a teenager, where he graduated in 1943 from [[Beverly Hills High School]]. He subsequently graduated from the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1946, and received a doctorate from [[Princeton University]] in 1951. He held faculty positions at the [[University of Chicago]], [[Columbia University]] (from 1955, leaving in 1971 in a dispute), and [[Yale University]].

==Mathematical work==

Lang studied under [[Emil Artin]] at Princeton University, writing his thesis on [[quasi-algebraic closure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=13268|title=Serge Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lang then worked on the geometric analogues of [[class field theory]] and [[diophantine geometry]]. Later he moved into [[diophantine approximation]] and [[transcendental number theory]], proving the [[Schneider–Lang theorem]].

A break in research while he was involved in trying to meet 1960s student activism halfway caused him (by his own description) difficulties in picking up the threads afterwards. He wrote on [[modular form]]s and [[modular unit]]s, the idea of a 'distribution' on a [[profinite group]], and [[value distribution theory]].

He made a number of conjectures in diophantine geometry: [[Mordell–Lang conjecture]], [[Bombieri–Lang conjecture]], [[Lang's integral point conjecture]], [[Lang–Trotter conjecture]], [[Lang conjecture on Gamma values]], [[Lang conjecture on analytically hyperbolic varieties]], [[Lang's height conjecture]] ...

He introduced the [[Lang map]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Bump]], "[http://sporadic.stanford.edu/bump/lang.ps The Lang Map]"&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lang–Steinberg theorem]] (cf. [[Lang's theorem]]) in algebraic groups.

He introduced the [[Katz–Lang finiteness theorem]].

==Mathematical books==
He was a prolific writer of mathematical texts, often completing one on his summer vacation. Most are at the graduate level.
He wrote [[calculus]] texts and also prepared a book on [[group cohomology]] for Bourbaki.

Lang's ''Algebra'', a graduate-level introduction to [[abstract algebra]], was a highly influential text that ran through numerous updated editions.  His Steele prize citation stated, "Lang's ''Algebra'' changed the way graduate algebra is taught...It has affected all subsequent graduate-level algebra books."  It contained ideas of his teacher, Artin; some of the most interesting passages in ''Algebraic Number Theory'' also reflect Artin's influence and ideas that might otherwise not have been published in that or any form.

==Awards as expositor==

Lang was noted for his eagerness for contact with students. Many of his students at Yale considered him to be one of the greatest teachers of mathematics in the world. He won a [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]] for Mathematical Exposition (1999) from the [[American Mathematical Society]]. In 1960, he won the sixth [[Cole Prize|Frank Nelson Cole Prize]] in Algebra for his paper ''Unramified class field theory over function fields in several variables'' (Annals of Mathematics, Series 2, volume 64 (1956), pp.&amp;nbsp;285–325).

==Activism==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
Lang spent much of his professional time engaged in political activism. He was a staunch [[socialist]] and active in [[Opposition to US involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to the Vietnam War]], volunteering for the 1966 anti-war campaign of [[Robert Scheer]] (the subject of his book ''The Scheer Campaign'').{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Lang later quit his position at Columbia in 1971 in protest over the university's treatment of anti-war protesters.

Lang engaged in several efforts to challenge anyone he believed was spreading misinformation or misusing science or mathematics to further their own goals. He attacked the [[1977 Survey of the American Professoriate]], an opinion questionnaire that [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] and [[E. C. Ladd]] had sent to thousands of college professors in the United States, accusing it of containing numerous biased and loaded questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Professors: A Survey of a Survey|date=18 May 1978|author=Serge Lang|work=The New York Review of Books}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=0avTrkyT1VcC&amp;pg=PA226 available online as reprinted in Challenges]&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a public and highly acrimonious conflict.

In 1986, Lang mounted what the ''[[New York Times]]'' described as a "one-man challenge" against the nomination of political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington]] to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="nyt-obit"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = Serge Lang, 78, a Gadfly and Mathematical Theorist, Dies | first = Kenneth | last = Change |author2=Warren Leary  | date = September 25, 2005 | accessdate = August 13, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/national/25lang.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lang described Huntington's research, in particular his use of mathematical equations to demonstrate that South Africa was a "satisfied society", as "pseudoscience", arguing that it gave "the illusion of science without any of its substance." Despite support for Huntington from the Academy's social and behavioral scientists, Lang's challenge was successful, and Huntington was twice rejected for Academy membership. Huntington's supporters argued that Lang's opposition was political rather than scientific in nature.&lt;ref name="nyt-academy"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = Science Academy Rejects Harvard Political Scientist | first = George | last = Johnson |author2=Laura Mansnerus  | date = May 3, 1987 | accessdate = August 13, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/weekinreview/ideas-trends-science-academy-rejects-harvard-political-scientist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lang kept his political correspondence and related documentation in extensive "files". He would send letters or publish articles, wait for responses, engage the writers in further correspondence, collect all these writings together and point out what he considered contradictions. He often mailed these files to people he considered important; some of them were also published in his books ''Challenges'' ({{isbn|0-387-94861-9}}) and ''[[The File]]'' ({{isbn|0-387-90607-X}}). His extensive file criticizing Nobel laureate [[David Baltimore]] was published in the journal ''Ethics and Behaviour'' in January 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatewaycoalition.org/files/Gateway_Project_Moshe_Kam/Resource/DBCre/serge.html Questions of Scientific Responsibility: The Baltimore Case] Reprinted from the journal Ethics and Behavior Vol. 3 No. 1 (1993) pp. 3–72, Serge Lang, Mathematics Department, Yale University&lt;/ref&gt; Lang fought the decision by Yale University to hire [[Daniel Kevles]], a [[History of science|historian of science]], because Lang disagreed with Kevles' analysis in ''The Baltimore Case''.

Lang's most controversial political stance was as an [[AIDS denialist]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| editor1-last=Jorgenson| editor1-first=Jay| editor2-last=Krantz| editor2-first=Steven G. | editor2-link=Steven G. Krantz | date=May 2006 | title=Serge Lang, 1927–2005| url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200605/fea-lang.pdf|format=PDF| journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]| volume=53| issue=5| pages=536&amp;ndash;553}}&lt;/ref&gt; he maintained that the prevailing scientific consensus that [[HIV]] causes [[AIDS]] has not been backed up by reliable [[scientific method|scientific research]], yet for political and commercial reasons further research questioning the current point of view is suppressed.  In public he was very outspoken about this point and a portion of ''Challenges'' is devoted to this issue.

'''Sheila LaBarre''' (born '''Sheila Kay Bailey''' on July 4, 1958 in [[Fort Payne, Alabama]]) is an American convicted murderer. She was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences, with no prospect of parole after being convicted of killing two men, Kenneth Countie and Michael DeLoge, in Epping, New Hampshire. At the time of the crimes, LaBarre lived in [[Epping, New Hampshire]] ([[Rockingham County, New Hampshire|Rockingham County]]) on a farm.

She regularly enticed younger men to her farm, where she would torture and control them.

At her trial she claimed she was an angel, sent by God to punish pedophiles.&lt;ref name="foxnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/06/20/murder-conviction-for-woman-who-claimed-was-pedophile-punishing-angel/ |title=Murder Conviction for Woman Who Claimed She Was Pedophile-Punishing Angel |publisher=Fox News |date=2008-06-20 |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She accused the two men she killed of being pedophiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lara Bricker |url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20080213/news/802130361 |title=Insanity defense: LaBarre pleads not guilty in 2 murders |publisher=SeacoastOnline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LaBarre was born Sheila Kaye Bailey in Alabama in 1958. She has a sister, Lynn Noojin.&lt;ref name="fosters1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080514/GJNEWS_01/76602961 |title=Dover NH, Rochester NH, Portsmouth NH, Sanford ME |publisher=Fosters.com |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20080514-NEWS-805140377 |title=Avenging 'angel' cries on jury tour |publisher=SeacoastOnline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[Fort Payne City Schools|Fort Payne High School]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5DHDoeKKboC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=Fort+Payne+High+School+in+1976+sheila+bailey&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BkML2e8vqv&amp;sig=3HhcWb-P8nLvNHJWD_30rJX7YaQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7hmyU5qRJMuiyATrsIKwAw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg |title=The Burn Farm - Michael Benson - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After marrying Ronnie Jennings, she was known as Sheila Bailey Jennings. She wanted to divorce Ronnie but he refused to divorce her for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5DHDoeKKboC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=Fort+Payne+High+School+in+1976+sheila+bailey&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BkML2e8vqv&amp;sig=3HhcWb-P8nLvNHJWD_30rJX7YaQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7hmyU5qRJMuiyATrsIKwAw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Fort%20Payne%20High%20School%20in%201976%20sheila%20bailey&amp;f=false |title=The Burn Farm - Michael Benson - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, LaBarre was held in a [[mental hospital|psychiatric facility]] after attempting suicide; at the facility she was sexually assaulted by an orderly.&lt;ref name="fosters1"/&gt;

She married John Baxter in January 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40glj3pe--0C&amp;pg=PA173-IA1&amp;lpg=PA173-IA1&amp;dq=sheila+labarre+john+baxter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JLwM5DCI5j&amp;sig=RxOIrrPH2ktOvveMwfZ9I7-jCn4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lUqyU5PWLPLlsAS62oLgCw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=sheila%20labarre%20john%20baxter&amp;f=false |title=Wicked Intentions: A Remote Farmhouse, A Beautiful Temptress, and the Lovers ... - Kevin Flynn - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2009-12-29 |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LaBarre moved from Fort Payne to Epping, New Hampshire in 1987 after answering a personal ad placed by Dr. Wilfred "Bill" LaBarre, a chiropractor. She never legally married Bill LaBarre, but took his last name ("Sheila LaBarre") and they lived together from 1987 until his death at age 74 in 2000.&lt;ref name="eagletribune1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eagletribune.com/local/x1876269565/LaBarre-married-divorced-while-claiming-to-be-common-law-wife/print |title=LaBarre married, divorced while claiming to be common-law wife » EagleTribune.com, North Andover, MA |publisher=Eagletribune.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wilfred LaBarre's obituary|url=http://www.hampton.lib.nh.us/hampton/biog/obits/labarrewilfred.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill LaBarre had been married twice before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hampton.lib.nh.us/hampton/biog/obits/labarrewilfred.htm |title=Obituary of Wilfred Joseph LaBarre &amp;#124; Lane Memorial Library |publisher=Hampton.lib.nh.us |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, LaBarre married a [[Jamaica]]n citizen named Wayne Ennis in [[York, Maine]], on August 22, 1995.&lt;ref name="eagletribune1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Associated Press |url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060811/NEWS/308119970 |title=LaBarre wants divorce records sealed |publisher=SouthCoastToday.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaBarre divorced Ennis in 1996.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5DHDoeKKboC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=wayne+ennis+divorce&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BkML2fbmru&amp;sig=pkJ7Xko3Dcf_QBoq_0H30EN7Iag&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PEmyU-uPAZOksQTDo4DoAw&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=wayne%20ennis%20divorce&amp;f=false |title=The Burn Farm - Michael Benson - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1997, Sheila LaBarre got a restraining order against Ennis after he had repeatedly assaulted her.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

After Bill's death, Sheila LaBarre inherited his farm. She said she was his common-law wife. His children from a previous relationship attempted to contest the will to get money and property, but were informed they had a 50/50 chance of success and would have to pay $50,000 upfront.&lt;ref name="Hampton.lib.nh.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hampton.lib.nh.us/hampton/biog/labarre/sheilalabarreHU20060401.htm |title=Woman Wanted for Murder &amp;#124; Lane Memorial Library |publisher=Hampton.lib.nh.us |date=2006-04-01 |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; After LaBarre's arrest there was speculation that she may have killed Bill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.seacoastonline.com/article/20060509/NEWS/305099994|title = Murder probe: Autopsy revisited|last = Dinan|first = Elizabeth|publisher = ''[[The Portsmouth Herald]]''|date = 9 May 2006|website = seacoastonline.com|accessdate = 2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.seacoastonline.com/article/20090906/NEWS/909060335|title = New York true crime author pens book on LaBarre murders|last = Bricker|first = Lara|publisher = ''[[The Portsmouth Herald]]''|date = 6 September 2009|website = seacoastonline.com|accessdate = 2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an allegation which LaBarre has denied.&lt;ref name = "Toes"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120704/NEWS03/707049957|title = Human toes found near Sheila LaBarre's Epping horse farm may lead to new homicide probe|last = West|first = Nancy|publisher = ''[[New Hampshire Union Leader]]''|date = 3 July 2012|website = unionleader.com|accessdate = 7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes==

===Kenny Countie===

Kenny Countie met LaBarre via a personal ad in 2006 when he was 24. He moved in with her shortly after meeting her.&lt;ref name="foxnews1"/&gt; Countie was described as having a [[Intellectual disability|low IQ]] and "child like" trust. LaBarre made a recording of him vomiting whilst she accused him of being a paedophile. She stabbed him to death and then burnt his body. The police were able to identify his DNA from his army records.

Countie's mother subsequently accused the Epping Police Department of negligence. Prior to his death, he had been seen in a [[Walmart]] store, bruised and burned, in a wheelchair. Her lawsuit against the two police officers who had seen him in the store was rejected in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmur.com/news/nh-news/Mother-of-LaBarre-victim-accuses-police-of-negligence/16446802#!U70C8 |title=Mother of LaBarre victim accuses police of negligence &amp;#124; Local News - WMUR Home |publisher=Wmur.com |date=2012-09-02 |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michael Deloge===

Deloge was LaBarre's boyfriend, who lived with her at her farm. He was last seen alive in 2005. A bone of his and his birth certificate were found at the farm in 2008.

An arrest warrant was issued on April 1, 2006 for Shelia LaBarre, for charges of first degree murder.&lt;ref name="Hampton.lib.nh.us"/&gt; She was arrested on April 2, and the police conducted a three-week search of her farm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eagletribune.com/newhampshire/x1876227425/Details-revealed-in-murder-case-against-Sheila-LaBarre |title=Details revealed in murder case against Sheila LaBarre » New Hampshire » EagleTribune.com, North Andover, MA |publisher=Eagletribune.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}{{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the discovery of three human toes which forensic analysis determined did not belong to either Kenny Countie or Michael Deloge.&lt;ref name = "Toes"/&gt;

===Trial===
The jury visited LaBarre's farm and the [[Walmart]] where she was seen with Countie. LaBarre attended too, wearing a stun belt.

LaBarre pleaded not guilty to murdering Countie and Deloge on the grounds of insanity. Her defense attorney described her as a "deeply, deeply sick individual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lara Bricker |url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20080213/news/802130361 |title=Insanity defense: LaBarre pleads not guilty in two murders |publisher=SeacoastOnline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At trial in May 2008, psychiatrists testified that LaBarre was diagnosed with [[schizoaffective disorder]] and [[delusional disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080604/GJNEWS_01/633523226 |title=Dover NH, Rochester NH, Portsmouth NH, Sanford ME |publisher=Fosters.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080515/GJNEWS_01/430513413 |title=Dover NH, Rochester NH, Portsmouth NH, Sanford ME |publisher=Fosters.com |date=2008-05-15 |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Brackett testified in court that he was in an abusive relationship with LaBarre for six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080530/NEWS/805300427 |title=Sheila LaBarre's ex-boyfriend says he is lucky to be alive |publisher=SeacoastOnline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LaBarre's ex-husband Wayne Ennis claimed that she had asked him to kill Wilfred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eagletribune.com/local/x1876275655/Ex-husband-says-LaBarre-asked-him-to-murder-chiropractor |title=Ex-husband says LaBarre asked him to murder chiropractor » Merrimack Valley » EagleTribune.com, North Andover, MA |publisher=Eagletribune.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilfred LaBarre's daughter Laura Melisi claimed that LaBarre had threatened to shoot people. She stated she always disliked Sheila LaBarre, and had warned her father against pursuing a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/article/20060401/NEWS/304019995 |title=Woman Wanted For Murder |publisher=SeacoastOnline.com |date=February 1, 2011|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her plea of [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]] was rejected by the jury. They found her guilty and LaBarre was sentenced to life in prison without parole in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080215/GJNEWS_01/792950596&amp;Template=printart |title=Murder experts analyze LaBarre: Call her pattern of behavior similar to that of serial killer |publisher=Fosters.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eagletribune.com/local/x1876438133/New-Hampshire-jury-says-Sheila-LaBarre-was-sane-sentenced-to-life-in-prison |title=New Hampshire jury says Sheila LaBarre was sane; sentenced to life in prison &amp;#124; Local News |publisher=eagletribune.com |date=2008-06-21 |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Stephen Gray''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (11 March 1923 – 30 November 2012) was an English musical administrator, who managed the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic|Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]] for 23&amp;nbsp;years.

==Career==

In 1950, together with [[David Cairns (writer)|David Cairns]], Gray established the [[Chelsea Opera Group]].  This was an organisation that produced concert performances of operas rather than staged productions because they were less expensive for the audiences.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/9748777/Stephen-Gray.html| title = Stephen Gray| accessdate = 18 December 2012| publisher = [[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For their first performance they persuaded [[Colin Davis]], at the time a 22-year-old [[clarinet]]ist, to conduct a concert performance of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart’s]] ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' in the [[Holywell Music Room]], [[Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.chelseaoperagroup.org.uk/About.htm| title = About COG| accessdate = 18 December 2012| publisher = Chelsea Opera Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gray played in the orchestra, and Cairns sang the role of Leporello.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In 1957 the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] invited Gray to leave his career at the [[Bank of England]] to assist with managing its finances.  Two years later Gray joined the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] as an administrator.  In 1964 he moved to [[Liverpool]] to become the manager of the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, a post he held until his retirement in 1987.  During this time, the orchestra had five principal conductors, [[Charles Groves|Sir&amp;nbsp;Charles Groves]] (until 1977), [[Walter Weller]] (1977–80), [[David Atherton]] (1980–83), [[Marek Janowski]] (1983–87), and [[Libor Pešek]] (1987–97).  Together with Sir&amp;nbsp;Charles, Gray organised an annual conductors' seminar, in which young potential conductors worked with the orchestra for a fortnight.  In 1972 Gray noticed the potential of [[Simon Rattle]] when, at the age of 17, he conducted the Merseyside Youth Orchestra in a performance of ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''.  Gray appointed Rattle as an associate conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra in 1977.  When Gray retired in 1987, a concert was organised in which each of the five principal conductors, and Simon Rattle, took part.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url = http://www.liverpoolphil.com/10728/latest-press-releases/royal-liverpool-philharmonic-remembers-stephen-gray-obe.html| title = Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Remembers Stephen Gray OBE| accessdate = 18 December 2012| publisher = [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic]]| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130218090304/http://www.liverpoolphil.com/10728/latest-press-releases/royal-liverpool-philharmonic-remembers-stephen-gray-obe.html| archivedate = 18 February 2013| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Henley| first = Darren| author-link = | last2 = McKernan| first2 = Vincent| author2-link = | year = 2009| title = The Original Liverpool Sound: The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society | publication-place = Liverpool  | publisher = Liverpool University Press | page= 173| isbn = 978-1-84631-224-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following his retirement, Gray remained active, helping to the rescue the Bluecoat Society of Arts, who were based in the [[Bluecoat Chambers]] in Liverpool, from closure.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Personal life==

Stephen Gray was born in [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], England, and was the son of an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] clergyman.  He was educated at [[Rugby School]], where he took an active part in the school orchestra.  After leaving school he worked at [[Bletchley Park]], but he never disclosed what he did there.  He studied [[classics]] at [[Trinity College, Oxford]], then joined the Bank of England as a trainee.  Gray married Frances, a member of the chorus of the Chelsea Opera Group, in 1953. Together they had a son and a daughter.  Gray was appointed OBE in 1987.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

She served as [[Home Secretary]] from 2010 to 2016. May was first elected [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidenhead]] in [[UK general election, 1997|1997]]. Ideologically, she identifies herself as a [[one-nation conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-sets-out-one-nation-conservative-pitch-for-leadership |title=Theresa May sets out ‘one-nation Conservative’ pitch for leadership|first=Ben|last=Quinn|date=30 June 2016|work=The Guardian|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

May grew up in [[Oxfordshire]] and attended [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]]. From 1977 until 1983, she worked for the [[Bank of England]], and from 1985 until 1997 at the [[Association for Payment Clearing Services]], also serving as a councillor for Durnsford in [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]]. After unsuccessful attempts to be elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1992 and 1994, she was elected as the MP for Maidenhead in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]]. From 1999 to 2010, May held a number of roles in the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinets]] of [[William Hague]], [[Iain Duncan Smith]], [[Michael Howard]], and [[David Cameron]], including [[Shadow Secretary of State for Transport|Shadow Transport Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions|Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary]]. She was also [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]] from 2002 to 2003.

After the [[2010 United Kingdom government formation|formation]] of a [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]] following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], May was appointed [[Home Secretary]] and [[Minister for Women and Equalities]], giving up the latter role in 2012. Reappointed after the Conservative victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], she went on to become the longest-serving Home Secretary in over 60 years.

Following Cameron's resignation, May won a [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|leadership election]] in July 2016, becoming the second female Prime Minister, following [[Margaret Thatcher]]. As Prime Minister, May began the process of [[Brexit|withdrawing the UK from the European Union]], triggering [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 50]] in March 2017 then, the following month, announcing a [[snap election|snap]] [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|general election]] in June, with the aim of strengthening her hand in Brexit negotiations.&lt;ref name="Crace 2018-07-09"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/brexit-secretary-david-davis-resigns|title=Political crises don't come much bigger than Brexit|last=Crace |first=John|date=9 July 2018|work=[[GQ]]|accessdate=10 July 2018|authorlink=John Crace (writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40210957 |title=General election 2017: Why did Theresa May call an election? |date=9 June 2017 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |accessdate=4 September 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905062304/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40210957 |archivedate=5 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a [[hung parliament]], in which the number of Conservative seats fell from 330 to 317, despite the party winning their highest vote share [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|since 1983]], prompting her to broker a [[confidence and supply]] [[Conservative–DUP agreement|deal]] with the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) to support a [[minority government]].

May then stood at the [[Barking by-election, 1994|1994 Barking by-election]], which was prompted by the death of Labour MP [[Jo Richardson]]. The seat had been continuously held by Labour since it was created in 1945 and Labour candidate [[Margaret Hodge]] was expected to win easily, which she did, with 13,704 votes (72.1%). May came a distant third with 1,976 votes (10.4%). Ahead of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], May was selected as the Conservative candidate for [[Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidenhead]], a new seat which was created from parts of the seats of [[Windsor and Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Windsor and Maidenhead]] and [[Wokingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wokingham]]. She was elected with 25,344 votes (49.8%), almost double the total of second-placed Andrew Terence Ketteringham of the Liberal Democrats, who took 13,363 votes (26.3%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Early political career==
Having entered [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], May became a member of [[William Hague]]'s front-bench [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Opposition]] team, as Shadow Spokesman for Schools, Disabled People and Women (1998–1999). She became the first of the 1997 MPs to enter the Shadow Cabinet when in 1999 she was appointed Shadow Education and Employment Secretary. After the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 election]] the new Conservative leader [[Iain Duncan Smith]] kept her in the Shadow Cabinet, moving her to the Transport portfolio.

May was appointed the first female [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]] in July 2002. During her speech at the 2002 Conservative Party Conference, she explained why, in her view, her party must change: "You know what people call us?

In June 2004 she was moved to become [[Shadow Secretary of State for the Family]].

[[David Cameron]] appointed her [[Shadow Leader of the House of Commons]] in December 2005 after his accession to the leadership. In January 2009, May was made Shadow [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]].

On 6 May 2010, May was re-elected MP for Maidenhead with an increased majority of 16,769{{spaced ndash}}60% of the vote. This followed an earlier failed attempt to unseat her in 2005 as one of the Liberal Democrats' leading "decapitation-strategy" targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1489270/Defiant-Kennedy-takes-decapitation-strategy-into-Tory-heartland.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=4 May 2005 |location=London |title=Defiant Kennedy takes 'decapitation' strategy into Tory heartland |last2=Sapsted |first1=Brendan |last1=Carlin |first2=David |accessdate=11 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706184240/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1489270/Defiant-Kennedy-takes-decapitation-strategy-into-Tory-heartland.html |archivedate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

May's debut as Home Secretary involved overturning several of the previous Labour government's measures on data collection and surveillance in England and Wales. By way of a government bill which became the [[Identity Documents Act 2010]], she brought about the abolition of the Labour government's [[Identity Cards Act 2006|National Identity Card]] and database scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/identity-cards-to-be-scrapped-within-100-days-1984447.html |title=Identity cards to be scrapped within 100 days |date=27 May 2010 |work=The Independent |location=London |agency=Press Association |accessdate=28 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530071415/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/identity-cards-to-be-scrapped-within-100-days-1984447.html |archivedate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8679072.stm |title=Identity cards set to be scrapped |date=12 May 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reformed the regulations on the retention of DNA samples for suspects and controls on the use of [[CCTV]] cameras. In May 2010, May announced the adjournment of the deportation to the United States of alleged computer hacker [[Gary McKinnon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article7131780.ece |title=Pentagon hacker Gary McKinnon wins extradition reprieve |last=Sugden |first=Joanna |date=21 May 2010 |work=The Times |accessdate=28 October 2010 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528062652/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article7131780.ece |archivedate=28 May 2010}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also suspended the registration scheme for carers of children and vulnerable people, with May saying that the measures were "draconian.

In June 2010, May faced her first major national security incident as Home Secretary with the [[Cumbria shootings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/news/home-secretary-cumbria-statement |title= Home Secretary makes statement on events in Cumbria |date= 2 June 2010 |publisher= Home Office |accessdate= 28 October 2010 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100606182539/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/news/home-secretary-cumbria-statement |archivedate= 6 June 2010 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/10219655.stm |title=Gunman kills 12 people in Cumbria rampage |date=2 June 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She delivered her first major speech in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] as Home Secretary in a statement on this incident,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/politics/10225885.stm |title=Theresa May updating MPs on Cumbria shootings |date=3 June 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; later visiting the victims with the Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/10234062.stm |title= Cameron visit after gun killings |date=4 June 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7802988/Cumbria-shootings-David-Cameron-meets-survivors-of-Derrick-Birds-rampage.html |title= Cumbria shootings |date= 4 June 2010 |work= The Daily Telegraph |location= London |accessdate= 28 October 2010 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100607064635/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7802988/Cumbria-shootings-David-Cameron-meets-survivors-of-Derrick-Birds-rampage.html |archivedate= 7 June 2010 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in June 2010, May banned the Indian Muslim preacher [[Zakir Naik]] from entering the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/10349564.stm|title=Indian preacher Zakir Naik is banned from UK |publisher=BBC News |date=18 June 2010|accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Daily Telegraph'', a Home Office official who disagreed with this decision was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/7923005/Tory-MPs-say-Home-Office-officials-who-disagree-with-Zakir-Naik-ban-should-quit.html |title=Home Office officials Should Quit |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=3 August 2010 |accessdate=3 August 2010 |location=London |first=Christopher |last=Hope |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806172702/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/7923005/Tory-MPs-say-Home-Office-officials-who-disagree-with-Zakir-Naik-ban-should-quit.html |archivedate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 2010, May announced plans for a temporary cap on UK visas for non-EU migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-to-press-ahead-with-cap-on-migration-2011128.html |title=Theresa May to press ahead with cap on migration |date=26 June 2010 |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=26 June 2010 |first=Nigel |last=Morris |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627174955/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-to-press-ahead-with-cap-on-migration-2011128.html |archivedate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move raised concerns about the impact on the British economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/10422895.stm |title=Interim cap on non-EU migrant workers coming to UK |date=26 June 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, May supported the detention of [[David Miranda (politician)|David Miranda]], partner of ''Guardian'' journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]], under the [[Terrorism Act 2000]], saying that critics of the Metropolitan Police action needed to "think about what they are condoning".&lt;ref name="miranda" /&gt; Lib Dem peer and former Director of Public Prosecutions [[Ken Macdonald]] accused May of an "ugly and unhelpful" attempt to implicate those who were concerned about the police action of "condoning terrorism".&lt;ref name="miranda"&gt;{{cite news |last= Watt |first= Nicholas |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/22/theresa-may-david-miranda-comments |title= Theresa May attacked for comments on critics of David Miranda's detention |work= The Guardian |location= London |date= 22 August 2013 |accessdate= 19 October 2013 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131020231937/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/22/theresa-may-david-miranda-comments |archivedate= 20 October 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court subsequently acknowledged there were "indirect implications for press freedom" but ruled the detention legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/19/david-miranda-detention-lawful-court-glenn-greenwald |title= David Miranda detention at Heathrow airport was lawful, high court rules |work= The Guardian |last1= Travis |first1= Alan |last2= Taylor |first2= Matthew |last3= Wintour |first3= Patrick |location= London |date= 19 February 2014 |accessdate= 31 July 2014 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140731015603/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/19/david-miranda-detention-lawful-court-glenn-greenwald |archivedate= 31 July 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

May also championed legislation popularly dubbed the [[Investigatory Powers Bill|Snooper's Charter]], requiring internet and mobile service providers to keep records of internet usage, voice calls, messages and email for up to a year in case police requested access to the records while investigating a crime. The Liberal Democrats had blocked the [[Draft Communications Data Bill|first attempt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gayle|first1=Damien|title=Theresa May to revive her 'snooper's charter' now Lib Dem brakes are off|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/09/theresa-may-revive-snoopers-charter-lib-dem-brakes-off-privacy-election|accessdate=13 July 2016|work=The Guardian|date=9 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823043150/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/09/theresa-may-revive-snoopers-charter-lib-dem-brakes-off-privacy-election|archivedate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the Conservative Party obtained a majority in the 2015 general election May announced a new [[Draft Investigatory Powers Bill]] similar to the Draft Communications Data Bill, although with more limited powers and additional oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theresa May says 'contentious' parts of web surveillance plan dropped|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34691956|accessdate=9 November 2015|publisher=BBC|date=1 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151108081501/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34691956|archivedate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain to present new watered down surveillance bill|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/11/01/uk-britain-security-surveillance-idUKKCN0SQ1PG20151101|accessdate=10 November 2015|agency=Reuters|date=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police and crime===
Speaking at the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] (ACPO) conference in June 2010, May announced radical cuts to the Home Office budget, likely to lead to a reduction in police numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/10453370.stm |title= Police must do more |date=29 June 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, May presented the House of Commons with proposals for a fundamental review of the previous Labour government's security and counter-terrorism legislation, including "stop and search" powers, and her intention to review the 28-day limit on detaining terrorist suspects without charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/politics/10619419.stm |title=Counter-terrorism measures to face government review |date=13 July 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/house_of_commons/newsid_8815000/8815378.stm |title= May announces scope of anti-terror law review |date= 13 July 2010 |work= BBC Democracy Live |accessdate= 14 July 2010 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100717055653/http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/house_of_commons/newsid_8815000/8815378.stm |archivedate= 17 July 2010 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, May announced a package of reforms to policing in England and Wales in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref name="Shakeup"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10757014 |title=Radical police shake-up announced |date=26 July 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=26 July 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726100849/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10757014 |archivedate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous Labour Government's central crime agency, [[Serious Organised Crime Agency|Soca (Serious Organised Crime Agency)]], was to be replaced by a new [[National Crime Agency]]. In common with the Conservative Party 2010 general election manifesto's flagship proposal for a "[[Big Society]]" based on voluntary action, May also proposed increasing the role of civilian "reservists" for crime control. The reforms were rejected by the Opposition [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref name="Shakeup" /&gt;

Following the actions of some members of [[Black Bloc]] in vandalising allegedly [[UK Uncut|tax-avoiding]] shops and businesses on the day of the March 2011 TUC march, the Home Secretary unveiled reforms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/28/police-new-powers-cuts-protest-home-secretary?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |title=Police may be given new powers after cuts protest, says home secretary |date=28 March 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104093739/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/28/police-new-powers-cuts-protest-home-secretary?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |archivedate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; curbing the right to protest, including giving police extra powers to remove masked individuals and to police social networking sites to prevent [[Public Order Act 1986|illegal protest]] without police consent or notification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.publicservice.co.uk/news_story.asp?id=15918 |title=Police may get social media crime powers |date=29 March 2011 |work=publicservice.co.uk Ltd |accessdate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407025057/http://www.publicservice.co.uk/news_story.asp?id=15918 |archivedate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, despite inquiries by both [[Scotland Yard]] and the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] ruling that there was no new evidence to warrant further investigation, after discussions with [[Doreen Lawrence|Dame Doreen Lawrence]], May commissioned [[Mark Ellison]] to review Scotland Yard's investigations into alleged police corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/lawrence-murder-police-corruption-will-be-investigated-7811117.html|title=May defies Met to order inquiry after Independent campaign|author=Andrew Grice &amp; Paul Peachey|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=2 June 2012|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was presented to Parliament by May on 6 March 2014. [[Bernard Hogan-Howe|Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe]], [[Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police]] said the report, which has prompted an inquiry into undercover policing, was "devastating".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26485664|title=Hogan-Howe vows to restore trust in Met after new Lawrence row|publisher=BBC News|date=7 March 2014|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, May welcomed the fact that crime had fallen by more than 10% under the coalition government, while still being able to make savings. She said that this was partly due to the government removing red tape and scrapping targets to allow the police to concentrate on crime fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/crime-is-down-by-more-than-10-under-this-government |title=Crime is down by more than 10% under this government |publisher=Home Office |date=18 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917172845/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/crime-is-down-by-more-than-10-under-this-government |archivedate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, May delivered a speech to the [[Police Federation of England and Wales|Police Federation]], in which she criticised aspects of the culture of the police force.&lt;ref name="May tells police – change or be changed"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Robinson |first1=Nick |title=May tells police – change or be changed |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27511997 |publisher=BBC News |date=21 May 2014 |accessdate=10 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214033013/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27511997 |archivedate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the speech, she said:

{{blockquote|When you remember the list of recent revelations about police misconduct, it is not enough to mouth platitudes about "a few bad apples". The problem might lie with a minority of officers, but it is still a significant problem, and a problem that needs to be addressed ... according to one survey carried out recently, only 42% of black people from a Caribbean background trust the police. That is simply not sustainable ... I will soon publish proposals to strengthen the protections available to whistleblowers in the police. I am creating a new criminal offence of police corruption.

On 9 December 2010, in the wake of violent [[2010 United Kingdom student protests|student demonstrations]] in central London against increases to higher-education [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fees]], May praised the actions of the police in controlling the demonstrations but was described by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as "under growing political pressure" due to her handling of the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8193115/Royal-car-attack-How-did-the-police-get-it-so-wrong-again.html |title=Royal car attack: How did the police get it so wrong |date=10 December 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=10 December 2010 |first=James |last=Kirkup |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210215059/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8193115/Royal-car-attack-How-did-the-police-get-it-so-wrong-again.html |archivedate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/Student-Protests-Prince-Charles-And-Camillas-Car-Attacked-As-Protesters-March-On-London/Article/201012215850255?lpos=Politics_News_Your_Way_Region_2&amp;lid=NewsYourWay_ARTICLE_15850255_Student_Protests%3A_Prince_Charles_And_Camillas_Car_Attacked_As_Protesters_March_On_London |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120730011732/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/Student-Protests-Prince-Charles-And-Camillas-Car-Attacked-As-Protesters-March-On-London/Article/201012215850255?lpos=Politics_News_Your_Way_Region_2&amp;lid=NewsYourWay_ARTICLE_15850255_Student_Protests:_Prince_Charles_And_Camillas_Car_Attacked_As_Protesters_March_On_London |dead-url=yes |archivedate=30 July 2012 |title=Royal car is attacked by protesters |date=9 December 2010 |publisher=Sky News |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, May declared that deployment of water cannon by police forces in mainland Britain was an operational decision which had been "resisted until now by senior police officers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Porter |title=Police could use water cannon to disperse rioters, Theresa May says |date=12 December 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8197432/Police-could-use-water-cannon-to-disperse-rioters-Theresa-May-says.html |accessdate=9 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420083705/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8197432/Police-could-use-water-cannon-to-disperse-rioters-Theresa-May-says.html |archivedate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She rejected their use following the [[2011 England riots|widespread rioting in summer 2011]] and said: "the way we police in Britain is not through use of water cannon. The way we police in Britain is through consent of communities." May said: "I condemn utterly the violence in Tottenham... Such disregard for public safety and property will not be tolerated, and the Metropolitan Police have my full support in restoring order."&lt;ref name=patrol-streets&gt;{{cite news |title= London riots: Police patrol streets after violence |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14435251 |publisher= BBC News |date= 7 August 2011 |accessdate= 9 August 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110809203535/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14435251 |archivedate= 9 August 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the riots May urged the identification of as many as possible of the young criminals involved. She said: "when I was in Manchester last week, the issue was raised to me about the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of crimes of this sort. The Crown Prosecution Service is to order prosecutors to apply for anonymity to be lifted in any youth case they think is in the public interest. The law currently protects the identity of any suspect under the age of 18, even if they are convicted, but it also allows for an application to have such restrictions lifted, if deemed appropriate." May added that "what I've asked for is that CPS guidance should go to prosecutors to say that where possible, they should be asking for the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of criminal activity to be lifted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitehead |first=Tom |date=14 August 2011 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8700761/UK-riots-juveniles-could-be-named-and-shamed-says-Theresa-May.html |title=UK riots: Juveniles could be named and shamed, says Theresa May |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=28 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114224855/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8700761/UK-riots-juveniles-could-be-named-and-shamed-says-Theresa-May.html |archivedate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anti-social behaviour====
In July 2010, May proposed to review the previous [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government's [[anti-social behaviour]] legislation signalling the abolition of the "[[Asbo|Anti-Social Behaviour Order]]" (ASBO). She identified the policy's high level of failure with almost half of ASBOs breached between 2000 and 2008, leading to "fast-track" criminal convictions. May proposed a less punitive, community-based approach to tackling social disorder. May suggested that anti-social behaviour policy "must be turned on its head", reversing the ASBO's role as the flagship crime control policy legislation under Labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10784060 |title=Time to 'move beyond ASBOS' says Home Secretary May |date=28 July 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=28 July 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728185910/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10784060 |archivedate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7914859/Home-Secretary-signals-the-end-of-Asbos.html |title=Home Secretary signals the end of Asbos |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2010 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731090347/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7914859/Home-Secretary-signals-the-end-of-Asbos.html |archivedate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Labour Home Secretaries [[David Blunkett]] (who introduced ASBOs) and [[Alan Johnson]] expressed their disapproval of the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/approach-to-antisocial-behaviour-must-be-turned-on-its-head-2037410.html |title=Approach to anti-social behaviour "must be turned on its head" |date=28 July 2010 |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=28 July 2010 |first=Wesley |last=Johnson |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730123651/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/approach-to-antisocial-behaviour-must-be-turned-on-its-head-2037410.html |archivedate=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drug policy====
[[File:Deakhat.jpg|thumb|[[Khat]] bundles]]
In July 2013, May decided to ban the stimulant [[khat]], against the advice of the [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] (ACMD). The council reached the conclusion that there was "insufficient evidence" it caused health problems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23163017 "Herbal stimulant khat to be banned"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711045838/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23163017 |date=11 July 2013 }}. BBC News. 3 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining the change in the classification May said: "The decision to bring khat under control is finely balanced and takes into account the expert scientific advice and these broader concerns", and pointed out that the product had already been banned in the majority of other EU member states, as well as most of the G8 countries including Canada and the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/panewsfeeds/may-under-fire-for-banning-khat-8685624.html "May under fire for banning khat".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707042248/http://www.standard.co.uk/panewsfeeds/may-under-fire-for-banning-khat-8685624.html |date=7 July 2013 }} ''London Evening Standard''. 3 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A report on khat use by the ACMD published in January 2013 had noted the product had been associated with "acute psychotic episodes", "chronic liver disease" and family breakdown. However, it concluded that there is no risk of harm for most users, and recommended that khat remain uncontrolled due to lack of evidence for these associations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/144120/report-2013.pdf ACMD Report on Khat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205044630/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/144120/report-2013.pdf |date=5 February 2016 }}. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal Democrat minister [[Norman Baker]] accused May of suppressing proposals to treat rather than prosecute minor drug offenders from a report into drug policy commissioned by the Home Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=27 December 2014 |title=Norman Baker reveals drugs proposals Theresa May stripped from report |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/26/norman-baker-reveals-drugs-proposals-theresa-may-stripped-from-report |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=27 December 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227044503/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/26/norman-baker-reveals-drugs-proposals-theresa-may-stripped-from-report |archivedate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=26 December 2014 |title=Ex-minister Norman Baker leaks details on Home Secretary's drug stance |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exminister-norman-baker-leaks-details-on-home-secretarys-drug-stance-9945643.html |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=27 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226183911/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exminister-norman-baker-leaks-details-on-home-secretarys-drug-stance-9945643.html |archivedate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Home Office denied that its officials had considered this as part of their strategy.

In 2010, May promised to bring the level of net migration down to less than 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/06/theresa-may-to-tell-tory-conference-that-mass-migration-threatens-uk-cohesion |title=Theresa May to tell Tory conference that mass migration threatens UK cohesion |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=6 October 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027161451/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/06/theresa-may-to-tell-tory-conference-that-mass-migration-threatens-uk-cohesion |archivedate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Independent'' reported in February 2015, "The [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) announced a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the 12 months to September 2014—up from 210,000 in the previous year."&lt;ref name="migration" /&gt; In total, 624,000 people [[Modern immigration to the United Kingdom|migrated to the UK]] in the year ending September 2014 and 327,000 left in the same period.

In May 2012 she told the [[Daily Telegraph]] of her intention "to create here in Britain a [[Home Office hostile environment policy|really hostile environment]] for illegal migration,”&lt;ref&gt;Kirkup, James (25 May 2012).

====Family migration====
In June 2012, Theresa May announced that new restrictions would be introduced to reduce the number of non-[[European Economic Area]] family migrants. The changes were mostly intended to apply to new applicants after 9 July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120611/debtext/120611-0002.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 11 Jun 2012 (pt 0002) |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=19 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020164414/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120611/debtext/120611-0002.htm |archivedate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly introduced rules came into effect on 9 July 2012 allowing only those British citizens earning more than £18,600 to bring their spouses or their children to live with them in the UK. This figure would rise significantly in cases where visa applications are also made for children. They also increased the current two-year probationary period for partners to 5 years. The rules also prevent any adult and elderly dependents from settling in the UK unless they can demonstrate that, as a result of age, [[illness]] or [[disability]], they require a level of long-term personal care that can only be provided by a relative in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grower|first=Melanie|title=Changes to Immigration Rules for family members – Commons Library Standard Note SN-06353|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06353|date=18 December 2012|accessdate=6 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105063524/http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06353|archivedate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[House of Lords]] was concerned about the immigration issue and therefore addressed the PM in Parliament as to whether she had examined the impact on communities and families on modest incomes, but it received no direct response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Mair|first = Lucy|title = Supreme court strikes down Home Office's back-door changes to immigration rules|url = https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/18/supreme-court-immigration-rules|accessdate = 16 March 2013|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 18 July 2012|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130824180235/http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/18/supreme-court-immigration-rules|archivedate = 24 August 2013|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human rights group [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]] concluded that the new rules showed scant regard to the impact they would have on genuine families.&lt;ref name="Liberty briefing"&gt;{{cite web |title = Liberty's briefing on the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules |url = http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/pdfs/policy12/liberty-s-briefing-on-the-statement-of-changes-in-immigration-rules-june-201.pdf |first = Yusef |last = Salehi |first2 = Rachel |last2 = Robinson |date = June 2012 |accessdate = 6 January 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121110164239/http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/pdfs/policy12/liberty-s-briefing-on-the-statement-of-changes-in-immigration-rules-june-201.pdf |archivedate = 10 November 2012 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[All-Party Parliamentary Group]] on Migration conducted an evidence based inquiry into the impact of the rules and concluded in their report that the rules were causing very young children to be separated from their parents and could exile [[British citizen]]s from the UK.&lt;ref name="AAPG report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the inquiry into new family migration rules|url=http://www.appgmigration.org.uk/sites/default/files/APPG_family_migration_inquiry_report-Jun-2013.pdf|first=Ruth|last=Grove-White|date=June 2013|accessdate=6 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020121731/http://www.appgmigration.org.uk/sites/default/files/APPG_family_migration_inquiry_report-Jun-2013.pdf|archivedate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deportation decisions====
[[File:Memorandum of Understanding on transnational crime (5937407114).jpg|thumb|May, David Cameron and [[Najib Razak]], 14 July 2011]]
At the Conservative Party Conference in October 2011, while arguing that the Human Rights Act needed to be amended, May gave the example of a foreign national who the Courts ruled was allowed to remain in the UK, "because—and I am not making this up—he had a pet cat". In response, the Royal Courts of Justice issued a statement, denying that this was the reason for the tribunal's decision in that case, and stating that the real reason was that he was in a genuine relationship with a British partner, and owning a pet cat was simply one of many pieces of evidence given to show that the relationship was "genuine". The Home Office had failed to apply its own rules for dealing with unmarried partners of people settled in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15160326 |title= Theresa May under fire over deportation cat claim |date= 4 October 2011 |publisher= BBC News |accessdate= 5 October 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111005020900/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15160326 |archivedate= 5 October 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International said May's comments only fuelled "myths and misconceptions" about the Human Rights Act and Justice Secretary [[Kenneth Clarke]] subsequently called May's comments "laughable and childlike."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/Clarke-hits-childish-remarks/story-13490799-detail/story.html |title=Clarke hits out at 'childish remarks' |date=6 October 2011 |work=Nottingham Post |accessdate=14 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008201216/http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/Clarke-hits-childish-remarks/story-13490799-detail/story.html |archivedate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15160326|title=Theresa May under fire over deportation cat claim|publisher=BBC News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005020900/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15160326|archivedate=5 October 2011|date=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, May was found in [[contempt of court]] by Judge Barry Cotter, and stood accused of "totally unacceptable and regrettable behaviour", being said to have shown complete disregard for a legal agreement to free an Algerian from a UK Immigration Detention Centre. As she eventually allowed the prisoner to be freed, May avoided further sanctions including fines or imprisonment.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9345345/Theresa-May-accused-of-unacceptable-and-regrettable-behaviour-by-judge.html |title=Theresa May accused of unacceptable and regrettable behaviour by judge |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=20 June 2012 |accessdate=24 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623052328/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9345345/Theresa-May-accused-of-unacceptable-and-regrettable-behaviour-by-judge.html |archivedate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ukimmigrationbarristers1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukimmigrationbarristers.com/blog/home-secretary-theresa-may-found-guilty-of-contempt-of-court-over-uk-immigration-issue/ |title=Home Secretary, Theresa May, found guilty of contempt of court over UK Immigration issue |work=UK Immigration Barristers blog |date=21 June 2012 |accessdate=24 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726003350/http://www.ukimmigrationbarristers.com/blog/home-secretary-theresa-may-found-guilty-of-contempt-of-court-over-uk-immigration-issue/ |archivedate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2013, [[Abu Qatada]], a radical cleric arrested in 2002, was deported to [[Jordan]] after a decade-long battle that had cost the nation £1.7 million in legal fees,&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ttavis |first1=Alan |title=Theresa May criticises human rights convention after Abu Qatada affair |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/08/theresa-may-human-rights-abu-qatada |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=8 July 2013 |accessdate=2 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717201325/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/08/theresa-may-human-rights-abu-qatada |archivedate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous prior Home Secretaries had been unable to resolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abu Qatada deported from UK to stand trial in Jordan|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-23213740|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718082054/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-23213740|archivedate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deportation was the result of a treaty negotiated by May in April 2013, under which Jordan agreed to give Qatada a fair trial, by not using evidence that may have been obtained through torture against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Abu Qatada timeline |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-17769990 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718082058/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-17769990 |archivedate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

May has frequently pointed to Qatada's deportation as a triumph, guaranteeing in September 2013 that "he will not be returning to the UK", and declaring in her 2016 leadership campaign announcement that she was told that she "couldn't deport Abu Qatada" but that she "flew to Jordan and negotiated the treaty that got him out of Britain for good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Halliday |first1=Josh |title=Abu Qatada will not be allowed back in UK, says Theresa May |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/24/abu-qatada-not-allowed-back-uk-theresa-may-jordan-acquittal-terror |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=24 September 2014 |accessdate=2 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717201355/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/24/abu-qatada-not-allowed-back-uk-theresa-may-jordan-acquittal-terror |archivedate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rentoul |first1=John |title=Boring and competent Theresa May is what the nation needs after the shock of the Brexit vote |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/boring-and-competent-theresa-may-is-what-the-nation-needs-after-the-shock-of-the-brexit-vote-a7114531.html |work=The Independent |location=London |date=1 July 2016 |accessdate=2 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701191546/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/boring-and-competent-theresa-may-is-what-the-nation-needs-after-the-shock-of-the-brexit-vote-a7114531.html |archivedate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qatada deportation also shaped May's views on the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and [[European Court of Human Rights]], saying that they had "moved the goalposts" and had a "crazy interpretation of our human rights laws", as a result, May has since campaigned against the institutions, saying that British withdrawal from them should be considered.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;

===Leadership election===
{{Further information|Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016}}
On 30 June 2016, May announced her candidacy for the leadership of the Conservative Party to replace [[David Cameron]], who resigned following the outcome of the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|European Union membership referendum]] in which 52% of voters voted in favour of leaving the EU. May emphasised the need for unity within the party regardless of positions on leaving the EU, saying she could bring "strong leadership" and a "positive vision" for the country's future. Despite having backed a vote to remain in the EU, she insisted that there would be no second referendum, saying: "The campaign was fought... and the public gave their verdict. There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door... Brexit means Brexit".

===Appointment===
On 13 July 2016, two days after becoming Leader of the Conservative Party, May was appointed Prime Minister by [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen]] [[Elizabeth II]], becoming only the second female British Prime Minister after [[Margaret Thatcher]], and the first female British Prime Minister of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royal.uk/queen-received-audience-right-honourable-theresa-may|title=The Queen received in audience The Right Honourable Theresa May|last=Adam.Vallance|date=12 July 2016|accessdate=17 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818170601/https://www.royal.uk/queen-received-audience-right-honourable-theresa-may|archivedate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC11July"&gt;{{cite news |title= PM-in-waiting Theresa May promises 'a better Britain' |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36768148 |accessdate= 18 April 2017 |publisher= BBC News |date= 11 July 2016 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170125064900/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36768148 |archivedate= 25 January 2017 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of elected or appointed female heads of government]]&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing the world's media outside [[10 Downing Street]], May said that she was "honoured and humbled" to become Prime Minister. On becoming Prime Minister, May became the first woman to have held two of the [[Great Offices of State]].

Responding to some calls for an early general election, "sources close to Mrs May" said there was no need for such an election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36769898 |title=Tributes for David Cameron at his final cabinet as UK PM |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=12 July 2016 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=12 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712112741/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36769898 |archivedate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech after her appointment, May emphasised the term "Unionist" in the name of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], reminding all of "the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-36789572 |title=Theresa May: Word unionist 'very important to me' |date=13 July 2016 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=14 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714214126/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-36789572 |archivedate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 15 July, May had travelled to [[Edinburgh]] to meet with [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Nicola Sturgeon]] to reinforce the bond between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.

On 20 July, May attended her first [[Prime Minister's Questions]] since taking office, then afterwards made her first [[List of international prime ministerial trips made by Theresa May|overseas trip as prime minister]], visiting Berlin for talks with German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]. During the visit, May said that she would not trigger [[UK Invocation of Article 50|Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon]]—the process for withdrawing from the European Union—before 2017, suggesting it would take time for the UK to negotiate a "sensible and orderly departure" from the EU. However, although Merkel said it was right for the UK to "take a moment" before beginning the process, she urged May to provide more clarity on a timetable for negotiations. Shortly before travelling to Berlin, May had also announced that in the wake of the referendum, Britain would relinquish the [[presidency of the Council of the European Union]], which passes between member states every six months on a rotation basis, and that the UK had been scheduled to hold in the second half of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36841066 |title=Brexit: Theresa May says talks won't start in 2016 |publisher=BBC News |date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720014459/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36841066 |archivedate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rowena |last=Mason |first2=Philip |last2=Oltermann |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/angela-merkel-backs-theresa-mays-plan-not-to-trigger-brexit-this-year |title=Angela Merkel backs Theresa May's plan not to trigger Brexit this year |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720232931/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/angela-merkel-backs-theresa-mays-plan-not-to-trigger-brexit-this-year |archivedate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion===
{{Main|Opinion polling for the next United Kingdom general election#Preferred Prime Minister polling}}
May had a high approval rating during her first week as Prime Minister. The results of an Ipsos MORI survey released in July 2016 indicated that 55% of those surveyed believed that May was a suitable PM while only 23% believed that the Labour leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] would make a good Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3762/Two-in-three-say-Labour-should-change-leader-before-next-General-Election.aspx |title=Two in three say Labour should change leader before next General Election |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=14 July 2016 |publisher=Ipsos MORI |accessdate=18 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920200435/https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3762/Two-in-three-say-Labour-should-change-leader-before-next-General-Election.aspx |archivedate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''ComRes'' poll taken in September 2016 after her election suggested May was seen as substantially more "in touch with ordinary British people" than her predecessor David Cameron and a majority of voters saw her as "the right person to unite the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Theresa May hugely popular among voters, who see her as in touch with 'ordinary people', poll finds |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-conservatives-popularity-ratings-public-support-a7327726.html |work=The Independent |date=24 September 2016 |accessdate=17 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318172717/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-conservatives-popularity-ratings-public-support-a7327726.html |archivedate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing her as a [[liberal conservatism|liberal Conservative]], the ''[[Financial Times]]'' characterised May as a "non-ideological politician with a ruthless streak who gets on with the job", in doing so comparing her to German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].&lt;ref name="Warrell"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Parker |first1=George |last2=Warrell |first2=Helen |title=Theresa May: Britain's Angela Merkel? |date=25 July 2014 |work=Financial Times |location=London |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/896aaa54-12bf-11e4-93a5-00144feabdc0.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703044351/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/896aaa54-12bf-11e4-93a5-00144feabdc0.html |archivedate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in ''[[The Independent]]'', Rebecca Glover of the Policy Innovation Research Unit contrasted May to [[Boris Johnson]], claiming that she was "staunchly more conservative, more anti-immigration, and more isolationist" than he was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/theresa-may-conservative-party-leader-shes-no-progressive-conservative-a7109121.html |title=Don't be misled by Theresa May – she's no progressive Conservative |last=Glover |first=Rebecca |date=1 July 2016 |work=The Independent |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316194446/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/theresa-may-conservative-party-leader-shes-no-progressive-conservative-a7109121.html |archivedate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her leadership campaign, May said that "We need an economy that works for everyone", pledging to crack down on executive pay by making shareholders' votes binding rather than advisory and to put workers onto company boards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Coates|first= Sam |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/may-vows-to-crack-down-on-greed-of-big-business-bbg9q0plf |title=May vows to crack down on greed of big business |work=The Times |location= London |date=11 July 2016 |subscription=yes |accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although she later claimed that the last pledge was not to be mandatory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Asthana|first1=Anushka|last2=Walker|first2=Peter|title=Theresa May: I won't force companies to appoint workers to their boards|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/21/theresa-may-force-firms-appoint-workers-boards-cbi|accessdate=10 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=21 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404180612/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/21/theresa-may-force-firms-appoint-workers-boards-cbi|archivedate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), policies that ''The Guardian'' describes as going further than the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party's]] [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]] manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theresa May's economy speech – Analysis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jul/11/andrea-leadsom-apologises-to-theresa-may-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-5783a105e4b0ea445f0fe2bf|accessdate=12 July 2016|work=The Guardian|date=11 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714180913/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jul/11/andrea-leadsom-apologises-to-theresa-may-politics-live?page=with:block-5783a105e4b0ea445f0fe2bf|archivedate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After she became Prime Minister, May's first speech espoused the left, with a promise to combat the "burning injustice" in British society and to create a union "between all of our citizens" and promising to be an advocate for the "ordinary working-class family" and not for the affluent in the UK. "The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few but by yours. We will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives ... When we take the big calls, we’ll think not of the powerful, but you. When we pass new laws we’ll listen not to the mighty, but to you. When it comes to taxes we’ll prioritise not the wealthy but you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Heather |date=14 July 2016 |title=Theresa May appeals to centre ground but cabinet tilts to the right |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |accessdate=14 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713235732/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister |archivedate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

May has described herself as a personal supporter of fox hunting with hounds, saying that foxes' numbers had to be controlled and that hunting them with dogs was the most humane way to do it.

May is known for a love of fashion, and in particular of distinctive shoes; she wore leopard-print shoes at her '[[Nasty Party]]' speech in 2002, as well as her final Cabinet meeting as Home Secretary in 2016. On ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' in 2014 she chose a subscription to [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'']] as her luxury item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/theresa-may-is-proof-that-female-politicians-dont-have-to-be-afr/|title=Theresa May is proof that female politicians don’t have to be afraid of fashion|date=12 July 2016|accessdate=15 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714225920/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/theresa-may-is-proof-that-female-politicians-dont-have-to-be-afr/|archivedate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she has been critical of the media focusing on her fashion instead of her achievements as a politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8033607.stm |title=Theresa May: My Life as a female MP |date=17 June 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818221937/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8033607.stm |archivedate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
