The '''1977 Hanafi Siege''' occurred on March 9–11, 1977 when three buildings in Washington, D.C. were seized by 12 [[Hanafi Muslim]]&lt;ref name="Smith77"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=J.Y.|title=Prosecution Opens Trial Of Hanafis|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1977/06/10/prosecution-opens-trial-of-hanafis/37b5ca1f-a16a-4736-bafc-6a3ade587c0b/|website=Washington Post|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=March 14, 2017|date=June 10, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; gunmen. The gunmen were led by [[Hamaas Abdul Khaalis]], who wanted to bring attention to the [[1973 Hanafi Muslim massacre|murder of his family in 1973]].&lt;ref name="Post77"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kiernan|first1=Laura|title=Amina Khaalis Relives Horror of Slayings, Court Is Told|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1977/10/19/amina-khaalis-relives-horror-of-slayings-court-is-told/bce2434e-08f3-4ebb-9912-c443646ef288/|website=Washington Post|accessdate=March 10, 2017|date=October 19, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; They took 149 hostages and killed [[radio journalist]] Maurice Williams.  After a 39-hour standoff, the gunmen surrendered and all remaining hostages were released from the District Building (the city hall; now called the [[John A. Wilson Building]]), [[B'nai B'rith]] headquarters, and the [[Islamic Center of Washington]].

The gunmen killed 24-year-old Maurice Williams, a radio reporter from [[WHUR]]-FM, who stepped off a fifth-floor elevator into the crisis (the fifth floor is where the mayor and Council Chairmen have their offices). The gunmen also shot D.C. Protective Service Division police officer Mack Cantrell, who died in the hospital a few days later of a heart attack. Then-Councilman and future 4-term Washington, D.C. Mayor [[Marion Barry]] walked into the hallway after hearing a commotion and was hit by a ricocheted shotgun pellet, which lodged just above his heart. He was taken out through a window and rushed to a hospital.

The gunmen had several demands. They wanted the government to hand over a group of men who had been convicted of killing seven relatives – mostly children – of takeover leader Hamaas Khaalis. They wanted those that were convicted of killing [[Malcolm X]].&lt;ref name="Trap2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Jeffrey David|title=The Terrorist Trap: America's Experience with Terrorism|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-33983-9|pages=124-125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AWzieu562dQC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=1973+hanafi+murder++-1977&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-XlHaVDPZl&amp;sig=tECuYjY5JqeoQ3RYucEFu9vBnkk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirrfnM88zSAhVLNSYKHfQUD9sQ6AEIQzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=1973%20hanafi%20murder%20%20-1977&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also demanded the cancellation of a premiere&lt;ref name="Trap2001" /&gt; of the movie ''[[Mohammad, Messenger of God]]'' because they considered it sacrilegious.&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/11/AR2007031101562.html | title='Some Things You Never Forget': Thirty years ago, gunmen stormed three D.C. buildings, taking 150 hostages and one life | author=Theresa Vargas |work=The Washington Post | date=March 12, 2007 | page=B01| accessdate=March 12, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine noted: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;That the toll was not higher was in part a tribute to the primary tactic U.S. law enforcement officials are now using to thwart terrorists—patience. But most of all, perhaps, it was due to the courageous intervention of three Muslim ambassadors, [[Egypt]]'s [[Ashraf Ghorbal]], [[Pakistan]]'s [[Sahabzada Yaqub Khan|Sahabzada Yaqub-Khan]] and [[Iran]]'s [[Ardeshir Zahedi]].&lt;ref name="time-77"&gt;{{cite news | title=The 38 Hours: Trial by Terror | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946751,00.html | date=March 21, 1977 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine| accessdate=March 12, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Background ==
The leader of the attack was former national secretary of the [[Nation of Islam]] Hamaas Abdul Khaalis. Khaalis was born Ernest McGhee in Indiana in 1921. Discharged from the [[U.S. Army]] on grounds of mental instability, he worked as a jazz drummer in New York City before converting to Islam and changing his name to Hamaas Khaalis. He became prominent in the ministries and school of the Nation of Islam and was appointed its national secretary in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.weta.org/boundarystones/2014/03/14/hanafi-siege-1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Khaalis split with the Nation of Islam in 1958 to found a rival Islamic organisation, the "Hanafi Movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediaguidetoislam.sfsu.edu/intheus/10_timeline.htm |title=Media Guide to Islam |publisher=Mediaguidetoislam.sfsu.edu |accessdate=June 13, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603075323/http://mediaguidetoislam.sfsu.edu/intheus/10_timeline.htm |archivedate=June 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, he was arrested for attempted extortion but released on grounds of mental illness.&lt;ref name="time-77"/&gt;

The Kokayi family were at the roots of the "Hanafi Movement" going back to a conclave at [[Howard University]] in 1968, when militant blacks formed a group called the [[Kokayi family]]. When the Kokayi family was disbanded, many of its members became members Hamaas' [[7700 16th Street NW|Hanafi American Mussulman's Rifle and Pistol Club]], which was given a group membership charter by the [[National Rifle Association]].&lt;ref name="Charlton77"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charlton|first1=Linda|title=GUNMEN LINKED TO A MOSLEM SECT INVADE 3 BUILDINGS IN WASHINGTON, KILL 1 AND HOLD SCORES HOSTAGE|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/10/archives/gunmen-linked-to-a-moslem-sect-invade-3-buildings-in-washington.html|accessdate=March 11, 2017|date=March 10, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, he published an open letter attacking the leadership and beliefs of the Nation of Islam. A year later five men broke into Khaalis' Washington, D.C. home and murdered five of his children, his nine-day-old grandson and another man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946751,00.html | work=Time | title=TERRORISM: The 38 Hours: Trial by Terror | date=March 21, 1977| accessdate=March 12, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murderers were arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment.  Khaalis claimed the men were associated with the Nation of Islam, and that the government had not held the Nation of Islam accountable.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.weta.org/boundarystones/2014/03/14/hanafi-siege-1977&lt;/ref&gt;

== The takeovers ==
On March 9, 1977, seven members of Khaalis' group burst into the headquarters of [[B'nai B'rith]], in downtown Washington, several miles south of [Khaalis' headquarters at [[7700 16th Street NW]], and took over 100 [[hostage]]s.  Less than an hour later, three men entered the [[Islamic Center of Washington]], and took eleven hostages.  At 2:20&amp;nbsp;pm, two Hanafis entered the [[District Building]], three blocks from the [[White House]].  They went to the fifth floor looking for important people to take hostage.  When an elevator opened the hostage-takers thought they were under assault and fired, killing Maurice Williams, a reporter for [[WHUR-FM]] radio,&lt;ref name=wp /&gt; and injuring security guard Mack Cantrell.  Then-[[Council of the District of Columbia|councilman]] [[Marion Barry]] was struck by a ricochet in the chest, and two others were wounded. "Throughout the siege Khaalis denounced the Jewish judge who had presided at the trial of his family's killers. 'The Jews control the courts and the press,'" he repeatedly charged.&lt;ref name="time-77"/&gt;

== The demands ==
Khaalis and his followers wanted those convicted for the 1973 murders handed over to them, presumably for execution.  They wanted those that were convicted of killing [[Malcolm X]].&lt;ref name="Trap2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Jeffrey David|title=The Terrorist Trap: America's Experience with Terrorism|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-33983-9|pages=124-125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AWzieu562dQC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=1973+hanafi+murder++-1977&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-XlHaVDPZl&amp;sig=tECuYjY5JqeoQ3RYucEFu9vBnkk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirrfnM88zSAhVLNSYKHfQUD9sQ6AEIQzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=1973%20hanafi%20murder%20%20-1977&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also wanted to receive visits from Muslim leader [[Warith Deen Mohammed]] and champion boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], long an active Black Muslim supporter.  Khaalis also demanded that he be refunded $750 in legal fees caused by a [[contempt of court]] citation issued in response to shouting at one of defendants on trial for murdering seven of his family members.&lt;ref name="Trap2001" /&gt; ''Time'' noted: "He also wanted the recently released film ''[[Mohammad, Messenger of God]]'', to be banned on the grounds that it is sacrilegious. Khaalis' concern over the film was thought to have triggered the attack."&lt;ref name="time-77"/&gt; He made this determination about the sacrilegious nature of the film based on the mistaken impression that Mohammad was a character seen or heard in the film, which is not the case. The main characters are relatives whose portrayal is not forbidden by religious tradition.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}} The kidnappers made some of their demands on air by calling the then popular broadcast journalist [[Max Robinson]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty54WeAkuKs&amp;t=41s], footage of their on-air call and demands.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Negotiations and resolution ==
When Khaalis was informed that people were worried about the fate of the hostages, Khaalis said, "Nobody showed any concern when my family was killed several years earlier." He told a reporter, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;get on the phone and call President Carter and some of those senators that never sent a call, a condolence message. Do you not realize when my family was wiped out [no] one said one word? Not one. Not even a preacher. Not even a minister. Not even a spiritual advisor. Not even a city council member. So, I'm very glad you're worried now. When they wiped out my family, I didn't hear about your sympathy and emotions. I got a letter the other day from my brother telling me how the brother was swaggering around in jail, the killer of Malcolm, walking around with guards protecting him. Well tell him it's over. Tell him it's payday.&lt;ref name="Trap2001" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The money from the contempt of court citation was returned and the movie premiere was cancelled.&lt;ref name="Trap2001" /&gt; Convicted killers of his family and Malcolm X were not delivered.&lt;ref name="Trap2001" /&gt; Part of the negotiations were conducted by the three Muslim ambassadors, who "read to the gunmen passages from the [[Quran]] that they said demonstrated Islam’s compassion and mercy. They urged the gunmen to surrender."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.jstandard.com/articles/2382/1/Wakeup-call-for-the-world:-Don%92t-ignore-Iran%92s-threats | title=Wakeup call for the world: Don’t ignore Iran’s threats | author=Daniel S. Mariaschin | date=March 8, 2007 | newspaper=New Jersey Jewish Standard| accessdate=March 12, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of the following day, following a number of phone calls, the three ambassadors, along with a few Washington, D.C. officials (including police commander Joseph O'Brien, who had investigated the murder of Khaalis' children and was trusted by Khaalis) met with the Hanafis. The ambassadors of [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], and [[Egypt]] read the Quran with Khaalis to appeal to his conscience.&lt;ref name="Trap2001" /&gt;  Finally, Khaalis and the others involved in the hostage taking at the two sites where no one was killed were allowed to be charged and then freed on their own recognizance. All were later tried and convicted, with Khaalis receiving a sentence of 21 to 120 years for his role.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== Aftermath ==
Khaalis died at the [[Federal Correctional Complex, Butner|Federal Correctional Complex Prison]] in [[Butner, North Carolina]], on November 13, 2003.{{citation needed|date = March 2012}} Marion Barry recovered from his wounds and was later elected mayor. In 2007, the fifth floor press room at the Wilson Building was named for the slain reporter, Maurice Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.wjla.com/news/stories/0307/404746.html | title=Press Room at Wilson Building Being Renamed | date=March 12, 2007 | publisher=WJLA TV-7 News| accessdate=March 12, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

John W. King wrote about the Hanafi siege in his book, ''The Breeding of Contempt''.  The book chronicles the siege and his family's becoming the first African American family in the Federal [[Witness Protection Program]] after the massacre of the Khaalis family.

The siege is mentioned in [[Joni Mitchell]]'s song "Otis And Marlena" from her 1977 album ''[[Don Juan's Reckless Daughter]]''.  In the song, the title characters travel "for sun and fun / While Muslims stick up Washington".

The [[Jonathan Leaf]] play ''The Caterers'', which was produced [[Off Broadway]] in 2005, portrayed a modern-day version of the siege.&lt;ref name="Teachout"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Teachout|first1=Terry|title=Terror, Up Close and Personal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB112923887866568101|accessdate=26 November 2017|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=14 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adolfo Cubas''' (born December 2, 1964) is a well known [[Venezuela]]n actor. He has participated in a number of theater plays and television [[telenovela]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teleprograma.diezminutos.es/telenovela/los-rostros-de-las-telenovelas/rostros-adolfo-cubas/adolfo-cubas|title=Así es Adolfo Cubas|website=teleprograma.diezminutos.es|accessdate=5 May 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cubas grew up in a conservative family. Cubas wanted to become a priest, and he attended a Catholic seminar school with that purpose in mind, but he left the school after two years. He has admitted that later on as a teenager, he attempted to commit suicide.

Cubas started to become involved in the entertainment world when he met and made a friendship with members of [[Los Chamos]], a famous 1980s [[boy band]]. Cubas led [[Carlos Baute]] to become involved in Los Chamos. Cubas also became a friend of [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]]'s [[Ricky Martin]]. From 1984 to 1987, Cubas himself became a member of Los Chamos.

In 1987, Cubas made his telenovela debut, participating in ''[[Mi Amada Beatriz]]'' (''My Beloved Beatriz''), which was a successful telenovela in Venezuela and the rest of [[Latin America]]. Cubas participated in two other telenovelas before he joined [[Guillermo Dávila]] and [[Sonya Smith]] in 1992's ''[[Cara Sucia (telenovela)|Cara Sucia]]'' (''Dirty Face''), one of [[Venevision]]'s most famous telenovelas of all time. He played "Antonio (Tony) Gonzalez", an ambitious man, in ''Cara Sucia'', which gave him international celebrity. He shaved his head and has participated in seventeen other film productions since.

Cubas' sexuality has been questioned over the years, to which he responded on an interview that he "will never respond to anyone (about that)". Nevertheless, there have also been rumors about a romance with Venezuelan actress [[Mimi Lazo]]. Cubas has a daughter who was born in 1987.

Cubas participated in a [[Playboy Channel|Playboy Channel Latino]] production which was recorded in [[Peru]].

Cubas released a biographic book in 2003. He was diagnosed with [[cancer]] and continues battling the disease and in 2013 (May 18) he became the godfather of a little girl named Roiderlyn Martinez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teleprograma.diezminutos.es/telenovela/los-rostros-de-las-telenovelas/rostros-adolfo-cubas/las-caras-de-adolfo-cubas|title=Adolfo Cubas al desnudos|website=teleprograma.diezminutos.es|accessdate=5 May 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Bernard Xavier Philippe de Marigny de Mandeville''' (1785–1868), known as '''Bernard de Marigny''', was a French-[[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] American [[nobility|nobleman]], playboy,&lt;ref&gt;Crété, Liliane (translated by Patrick Gregory). ''Daily Life in Louisiana 1815-1830'' (Baton Rouge and London: [[Louisiana State University Press]]), 1978 (translation 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Planter (American South)|planter]], politician, [[duel]]ist, writer, horse breeder, land developer, and [[President of the Louisiana State Senate]] between 1822 and 1823.

==Early life==
The son of Pierre Enguerrand Philippe de Marigny de Mandeville (1751-1800) [[Squire|Ecuyer]] and [[Chevalier de St. Louis]] and his wife Jeanne Marie d'Estrehan de Beaupré, Bernard was born in [[New Orleans]] in 1785, the third generation of his family to be born in [[Louisiana (New Spain)|colonial Louisiana]]. His paternal grandfather, [[Antoine Philippe de Marigny]], was a [[early modern France|French]] [[Nobility|nobleman]], military officer, and [[geographer]]. His maternal grandfather, [[Jean Baptiste d'Estrehan]], was the [[Louisiana (New France)|royal treasurer of the colony]].

In 1798, [[Louis Philippe I|Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orléans]] (who became King Louis Philippe in 1830) and his two brothers, the [[Antoine Philippe, Duke of Montpensier|Duke de Montpensier]] and the [[Louis Charles, Count of Beaujolais|Count of Beaujolais]], visited the Marigny [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]. By all accounts, they were lavishly entertained by the family. One story recounts that special gold dinner ware was made for the occasion of the Duke of Orleans' visit and was thrown into [[Mississippi River|the river]] afterward, because no one would be worthy of using it again.

The visit of the [[French monarchy|French royal family]] apparently had a big impact on Marigny, as it is reported as an example of the spoiled life in which he was reared.  When he was 15 years old, his father died and Bernard inherited his father's plantation just outside the city gates, east of [[New Orleans]]' [[Vieux Carré]]. According to historians, "His every whim [was] indulged while his father was alive, he became as wild and headstrong after his death as an unbacked [wild] [[mustang]], and his guardian, abandoning all idea of control, finally shipped him to England, hoping that life abroad might mend his manners; but in London Bernard's dissipations became only more pyrotechnic, and he spent most of his time at Almack's and other famous gambling places."&lt;ref&gt;Tinker, Edward Larocque, ''The Palingenesis of Craps'' (1933), pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Craps==
One of the things Marigny brought back to New Orleans from England was the dice game [[Hazard (game)|Hazard]]&lt;ref&gt;Bridges, Tyler, ''Bad Bet in the Bayou'' Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; which became popular in a simplified form, known in local dialect as "''Crapaud''."

==Fair Grounds Race Course==
{{main|Fair Grounds Race Course}}

Marigny founded the "Louisiana Race Course," now the [[Fair Grounds Race Course]], with Julius C Branch and [[Henry Augustine Tayloe]] (son of [[John Tayloe III]] of [[the Octagon House]], a leading turfman, founder of the Washington Jockey Club (1798), who imported the great English thoroughbred [[Diomed]] who sired [[Sir Archy]]-whose progeny include [[Lexington (horse)|Lexington]], [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] and [[American Pharoah]]; grandson of [[John Tayloe II]] who imported Childers (by [[Flying Childers]]), Jenny Cameron and Jolly Rogers (three of the most important colonial imports) and who built the grand colonial estate and stud farm [[Mount Airy, Richmond County, Virginia|Mount Airy]]) and organized the first races for March 20, 1839, and lasted for five days. "The First Day was the "Creole Purse" for $500, one mile heats; the same day the "Proprietors Purse" for $250, one mile heats; and third race "Sweepstakes" (See Spirit of Times). Second Day-"Proprietors Purse" $1,200—two mile heat; if more than two start the second best to be entitled to $200-but if two, the winner to receive $1,000. Third Day-"Jockey Club Purse" $1,800—three mile heats; of which the second best will be entitled to $300, if more than two start-if but two, the winner to receive $1500. Fourth Day-"Jockey Club Plate" value $1,500 and $500, -four mile heats-to the winner, and $500 to the second best horse, provided more than two start. Fifth Day-"Proprietors Purse" $600—mile heat-best 3 in 5; Same Day-"The Louisiana Plate" value $1,000—two mile heats; five year olds and over will carry 100lbs.- four year olds and under their appropriate weight."
&lt;ref&gt;Times Picayune, March 14, 1839, Page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faubourg Marigny==
{{main|Faubourg Marigny}}
On reaching his majority in 1806, Marigny at once had his [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] subdivided and began to develop the [[Faubourg Marigny]]. (The [[Louisiana Purchase]] had taken place in 1803.) Marigny had many gambling debts; and the smaller the land parcels were, the more there were to sell. The area grew rapidly and lots were sold all the way into the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnodc.org/orleans/7/21/snapshot.html  Greater New Orleans Community Data Center]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marigny's development was immediately popular. He spent most of 1806 and 1807 at the office of [[notary]] Narcisse Broutin selling sixty-foot lots or emplacements to prospective home builders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frenchquarter.com/history/faubourgs.php French Quarter history]&lt;/ref&gt;  Marigny famously named the streets of his neighborhood whimsically: Abundance, Peace, History, Poets, Piety, [[Frenchmen Street|Frenchmen]], Greatmen, Goodchildren, Music, [[Desire Street|Desire]], Hope, Love, Pleasure, Duels, and Craps (after the game of chance he introduced to America). "Though said to be poorly educated in the classics, he christened the main thoroughfare to his house [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]] after [[Virgil]]'s "Deathless Residence of the Spirits of the Blessed."&lt;ref&gt;Scully, Helen, ''Mobile Press-Register'' August 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that [[Elysian Fields Avenue]] was named simply as the [[English language|English]] translation for the [[Paris]]ian Avenue des [[Champs-Élysées]].

As more [[English Americans|English-speaking Americans]] arrived in New Orleans, tensions between them and the settled [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]] began to grow. When two American [[real estate developers|developers]] approached Marigny about future commercial development of the city in the area of the Faubourg Marigny, the Creole first agreed, and then reneged by instructing Madame Marigny to stay away from the [[notary]] office, thus effectively killing the deal; this was reportedly due to his notorious dislike of the American settlers who were considered uncouth ''[[parvenus]]''. This act was seen as extremely bad faith on the part of Marigny, and not only ensured that housing development grew [[Uptown New Orleans|uptown]] instead of [[Downtown New Orleans|east of the city]], but also affected both his finances and his political career: "Marigny was severely blamed by the rest of the Creole population for thus yielding to his [[anti-American]] prejudices. This feeling ultimately worked his political destruction. Thereafter he was not looked on as a safe leader, and when he became a candidate for the governorship, they refused to support him."&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, John, ''History of New Orleans'', The Lewis Publishing Company,(1922) pp. 125-126&lt;/ref&gt;

Strapped for cash, Marigny later sold his lots not only to white Creoles but also to free black Creoles, known as [[gens de couleur libre]]. Marigny was also related to one of the most prominent femme de couleur libre (free women of color), his half-sister [[Eulalie Mandeville|Eulalie Mandeville Macarty]], who was the illegitimate, but well loved daughter of Pierre Enguerrand Philippe De Marigny de Mandeville and  Marie Jeanne, who was an [[History of slavery in Louisiana|enslaved woman]] from the Marigny household. Eulalie was given her freedom and brought up by her paternal grandparents, who left her well provided. The Bernard de Marigny, as well as other Mandeville de Marigny family members,  even testified on Eulalie de Mandeville's behalf following her husband's death, when her in-laws sued Eulalie de Mandeville for her estate.  They claimed that legally a femme de couleur libre, such as herself, could not inherit the amount of money she possessed from her late-husband (or life partner, as interracial marriage was illegal). Eulalie countered by arguing that all the money she possessed she and her husband earned as equals and that the majority of their wealth came from her business endeavour from before their marriage. Bernard de Marigny testified in favour of his half-sister and helped her hold on to her wealth, not once but twice, as her late husband's family sued Eulalie de Mandeville again after being dissatisfied with the results of the first trial.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Carol. "Plaçage and the Performance of Whiteness: The Trial of Eulalie Mandeville, Free Colored Woman, of Antebellum New Orleans." American Nineteenth Century History 15, no. 2 (May 4, 2014): 187–209. https://doi.org/10.1080/14664658.2014.959818."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle of New Orleans==
{{main|Battle of New Orleans}}
Marigny and [[Edward Livingston]] were unable to convince General [[Andrew Jackson]] to meet and seek the support of [[Jean Lafitte]] to aid in the Battle of New Orleans, whom the British forces had tried to recruit but who, according to Marigny, was more inclined to support the Americans. Lafitte did eventually meet and persuade Jackson of the [[Barataria Bay|Baratarian's]] support, which proved very useful during the campaign, meriting personal and public praise from Jackson.

Marigny served as aide-de-camp for [[Governor of Louisiana|Louisiana governor]], [[William C. C. Claiborne]], during the battle of New Orleans&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/creolefamiliesof00kingrich#page/34/mode/2up/search/aide King, G.] ''Creole Families of New Orleans'', by Grace King; THE MACMILLAN COMPANY; New York; 1921, pp. 23 - 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=At the Battle of New Orleans, Marigny distinguished himself by his courage and activity. It is noteworthy that the glorious victory was reaped on the fields of the plantation of his Uncle [Martin] de Lino de [[Chalmette]]. In 1824 he supported General Jackson for President not only with his usual fiery eloquence, but also, perhaps more effectively, with force of arms. He was an ardent duelist and an expert with sword and pistol, and he has been credited with fifteen or more encounters. [Footnote:] Bernard Marigny's ''Réflexions sur la campagne du Général André Jackson en Louisiane en 1814 et 1815,'' New Orleans; 1848, is the best account we have of the preparations made to meet the enemy before the battle; and of the ensuing episode.|Library of Louisiana Historical Society.|author= Grace King|source=''Old Families of New Orleans''&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/creolefamiliesof00kingrich#page/32/mode/2up|title=Creole Families of New Orleans|first=G.|last=King|date=1921|page=33|publisher=New York, THE MACMILLAN COMPANY|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Political career==
In 1811, and again in 1814, Marigny was elected to the [[New Orleans City Council]] to represent the Fifth Ward.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, p. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt; From 1822 to 1823, Marigny served as [[President of the Louisiana State Senate]]; and, as there was no [[Lieutenant Governor]], he was next in line of succession to [[Governor]] [[Thomas B. Robertson]].

Marigny was aide-de-camp of the prefect [[Pierre Clément de Laussat]], then of [[Governor of Louisiana|Louisiana governor]], [[William C. C. Claiborne]], during the battle of New Orleans — whose daughter, Sophronie Louise, later wed Marigny's son, [[Antoine James de Marigny]]. He was chairman of the state Senate from Louisiana, 1822 to 1823.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/creolefamiliesof00kingrich#page/34/mode/2up/search/aide King, G.] ''Creole Families of New Orleans'', by Grace King; THE MACMILLAN COMPANY; New York; 1921, pp. 23 - 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1824|1824]], Marigny ran for [[List of Governors of Louisiana|Governor of Louisiana]], but was defeated by [[English American|Anglo]] candidate [[Henry Johnson (Louisiana)|Henry Johnson]].  He ran again in the [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1828|gubernatorial election of 1828]], but he was defeated by [[Pierre Derbigny]], whom he had supported in the [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1820|1820 election]]. Marigny was at one point a candidate in the [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1830|special gubernatorial election of 1830]], but ultimately he was not on the ballot.

==North shore activities==

Marigny's land holdings included a [[sugarcane]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] on the north shore of [[Lake Pontchartrain]]. This region is [[St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana|Saint Tammany Parish]], one of the [[Florida Parishes]], lands [[Republic of West Florida|acquired by the U.S. in 1810]], prior to Louisiana's transition to [[U.S. state|statehood]].

Today there are a few [[ruins]] of Marigny's 1829 [[sugar cane mill|sugar mill]]; the area comprises [[Fontainebleau State Park]]. Fontainebleau was the name Marigny chose for his property, after the [[Forest of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau Forest]] near [[Paris]]. In 1834, Marigny de Mandeville laid out the town which bears his family name, [[Mandeville, Louisiana]].

==Later life and death==

Marigny eventually lost his fortune gambling and died impoverished, in 1868. He was buried at [[Saint Louis Cemetery]] No. 1 in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cml.upenn.edu/nola/pdfs/02Historical.pdf  Monograph of the University of Pennsylvania]&lt;/ref&gt; (His mother, father, paternal grandfather, and paternal great-grandfather were interred in the [[St. Louis Cathedral (New Orleans)|St. Louis Cathedral]]. The engraved slab listing the men's names is one of only two prominent grave monuments located inside the cathedral.)

Two New Orleans streets are named for him or his family, Marigny and Mandeville.

'''Betsey Guppy Chamberlain''' (c. 1797&amp;ndash;1886) was a textile mill worker of Native American background who wrote sketches and poetry in the early 19th century.{{sfn|Ranta|2003|p=xii}}
Her work was among the first published by a native woman to protest against their treatment by the U.S. government.{{sfn|Murphy|2008|p=73}}

==Biography==

===Origins===
Betsey Chamberlain's origins are obscure, but she has been identified with Betsey Guppy, born on 29 December 1797 in [[Wolfeboro, New Hampshire]], beside [[Lake Winnipesaukee]].
Betsey Guppy was the daughter of William Guppy and Comfort Meserve.{{sfn|Ranta|2003|p=5}}
Another source says she was born in [[Brookfield, New Hampshire]].
She was of mixed Flemish/English and [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] (most likely [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] or [[Abenaki]]) descent.{{sfn|Porter|Roemer|2005|p=161}}
She married Josiah Chamberlain in 1820, and had two children by him before he died in 1823.
She was forced to sell their small farm in Brookfield and come to work in the mills,
which paid good wages for the time, although the hours were long.{{sfn|Ranta|2003|p=xi}}

===Lowell===

Betsey Chamberlain was recorded as joining the First Congregational Church in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] in March 1831, and in April 1834 was married to Thomas Wright in that church.  The marriage does not seem to have lasted, and Betsey Chamberlain did not use the name "Wright" in later years.{{sfn|Ranta|2003|p=47-48}}
According to [[Harriet Hanson Robinson]], who started work in the Lowell mills as a child of ten in 1835, "Mrs. Chamberlain was a widow, and came to Lowell with three children from some 'community' (probably the [[Shakers]]), where she had not been contented.  She had inherited Indian blood, and was proud of it.  She had long, straight black hair, and walked very erect, with great freedom of movement.  One of her sons was afterwards connected with the ''New York Tribune''."{{sfn|Robinson|1898|p=145}}

Lowell was a planned factory town.  Under the [[Lowell System]], the company recruited young farm girls to work in the mills, building dormitories where they could live at low rents, and hiring matrons to monitor the social conduct of the girls. The company arranged for cultural events, bible studies and other educational opportunities.{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=64}}
Lowell was rich in educational and cultural opportunities for women at that time. There were libraries and bookstores, evening schools and lectures, concerts and balls. 
Two of the first magazines written by women were published in the town, the ''[[Lowell Offering]]'' (1840-1845) and the ''New England Offering'' (1847-1850).
Chamberlain wrote for both of these journals using the pseudonyms "Betsey", "B.C.", "Jemima", and "Tabitha."{{sfn|Ranta|2003|p=xii}}

===Later life===
In 1843 Betsey Chamberlain married Charles Boutwell, a widowed farmer with children of his own.{{sfn|Ranta|2003|p=52}}
They moved to Illinois, where they began farming.
She was back in Lowell in 1848, perhaps to earn cash to help support the farm, and published short pieces in ''The New England Offering'' between December 1848 and February 1850.
She returned to Illinois in 1850.{{sfn|Ranta|2003|p=53}}
She had four husbands in total, dying at the age of eighty-eight.{{sfn|Ranta|2003|p=15}}

==Work==

Thirty-three prose works by Chamberlain were published in the ''Lowell Offering'' between 1841 and 1842, and four more in the ''New England Offering'' of 1848.{{sfn|Porter|Roemer|2005|p=161}}
A few of her writings, such as the 1842 ''The Indian Pledge'' and ''A Fire-Side Scene'', are among the earliest protests against Indian persecution to be published by native women.{{sfn|Ranta|2003|p=10}}
The satirical ''A Fire-Side Scene'' is highly critical of the way the government was treating native people, implying that their actions were far from following Christian morality.{{sfn|Murphy|2008|p=73}}
Most of her published pieces are sketches of village life and legends told from a woman's viewpoint, in which she shows great powers of observation, 
bringing her characters vividly to life.{{sfn|Porter|Roemer|2005|p=161}}
Harriet Hanson Robinson said of her "Mrs. Chamberlain was the most original, the most prolific, and the most noted of all the early story-writers. Her writings were characterized, as Mr. Thomas says, 'by humorous incidents and sound common sense,' and is shown by her setting forth of certain utopian schemes of right living."{{sfn|Robinson|1898|p=145}}

'''Carlos Del Castillo''' (born c. 1965) is a scientist who, in 2004, became the recipient of the [[Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers]] (PECASE) award, the highest honor bestowed by the [[United States government]] on scientists and engineers beginning their independent careers. Del Castillo was the Program Scientist for the Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry Program at [[NASA Headquarters]], in [[Washington, D.C.]].

==Early years==

Del Castillo was born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], the capital city of [[Puerto Rico]], and raised in Mayaguez. There he received his primary and secondary education. He lived a humble life and spent most of his youth  on or near the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. His upbringing near the ocean served as an influential factor when he decided to study biology at the [[University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez]] where in 1987, he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Biology.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2004/sep/HQ_04308_feature_castillo_prt.htm NASA Scientist Recognized As Innovator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Path"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/k-4/features/F_The_Path_Almost_Not_Followed.html The Path That Nearly Wasn't Followed]&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued to work on a master's degree in Marine Science in the same institution. Del Castillo began studying the effects of oil pollution in the tropical marine environments. His master's thesis dealt with oil pollution and the results of his thesis was presented in a meeting in [[Rennes, France]].&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Path"/&gt;

During this time period, he also served in the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] and was assigned to the 240th Military Police Company. His military service included deployment to [[Saudi Arabia]] during the first [[Persian Gulf War]] (August 2, 1990 – February 28, 1991).&lt;ref name="Path"/&gt;

Upon his return to Puerto Rico Del Castillo earned his master's degree in Marine Science in 1991. He realized that there was a lack of funding for oil pollution research in Puerto Rico and therefore, he decided to continue his education and research at the [[University of South Florida]]. While pursuing his doctorates degree, he became interested in Organic Carbon biogeochemistry. He used remote sensing to study biogeochemical and physical processes in the oceans through a combination of remote sensing and field and laboratory experiments. Del Castillo was offered a position in a laboratory where he was to conduct a series of studies in the [[Arabian Sea]] similar to the ones which he had proposed to NASA. In his proposal to NASA, he asked the agency to conduct and study the optical properties of organic matter in the [[Orinoco River]] plume. It was his believe that Orinoco River plume was a critical aspect in the use of optical sensors for ocean Biogeochemical research. Del Castillo earned his PhD in [[Oceanography]] in 1998, from the University of South Florida and was awarded the William Sackett Prize for Innovation and Excellence in Research.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Path"/&gt;

==Career in NASA==
[[Image:Mississippi River Delta and Sediment Plume.jpg|thumb|230px|The Mississippi River Delta, showing the sediment plumes from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers, 2001.]]
Del Castillo was offered a position at NASA's [[Stennis Space Center]] (SSC), in [[Mississippi]]. There he worked as a researcher under the direction of Dr. Rick Miller, who led the Earth Systems Science Office. He began working in the [[Mississippi River Delta|Mississippi River plume]] and in the application of remote sensors to study coastal environments.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt; He co-edited with Dr's. Richard Miller and Brent McKee, "Remote Sensing of the Coastal Environment," a book which provides extensive insight on remote sensing of coastal waters from aircraft and space-based platforms.&lt;ref name="Path"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Remote Sensing of Coastal Aquatic Environments: Technologies, Techniques and Applications (Remote Sensing and Digital Image Processing)"; authors: Carlos E. Del Castillo, Richard L. Miller; Brent A. McKee; Publisher: Springer (December 1, 2010); {{ISBN|9048167922}}; {{ISBN|978-9048167920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Del Castillo was offered a position as Program Scientist for the Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry program at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. The temporary position allowed him to learn about policy, and interact with colleagues in academia and other branches of the government.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Path"/&gt;

On September 9, 2003, [[National Science and Technology Council]] (NSTC) announced that Del Castillo would be awarded the prestigious [[Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers]] (PECASE) for his research in Ocean Biology. The award, which is bestowed by the NSTC once during an individuals career, was officially given to Del Castillo on May 2004. It is the highest honor bestowed by the U.S. government on scientists and engineers beginning their independent careers.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Path"/&gt;

Del Castillo is a member of NASA's Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem Management and Operations working group. In 2007, he was awarded the Emerald Honor Trailblazers Award. Del Castillo is a member of the Senior Professional Staff with the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences of the [[Johns Hopkins University]] Applied Physics Laboratory, and the William S. Parsons Professor at the Johns Hopkins University Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. He has served as a member of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] Committee on Assessment of Impediments to Interagency Cooperation on Space and Earth Science Missions and the Committee on Assessing Requirements for Sustained Ocean Color Research and Operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cohemis.uprm.edu/prysig/cdc09/cv_cdc.pdf  SUMMARY OF PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles E. Bartley''' (1921–1996) was an [[United States|American]] [[scientist]], known for developing the first [[elastomeric]] solid [[rocket propellant]] [[formula]],&lt;ref name="source4"/&gt; at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (now part of [[NASA]]) in [[Pasadena, California]] in the late 1940s.&lt;ref name="source3" /&gt;

Bartley founded [[Grand Central Rocket Company]] in [[Redlands, California]] in 1952.  Six years later, his company provided the fuel for the third stage of Explorer I, America's first satellite. Bartley eventually sold Grand Central and founded two other solid propellant rocket companies specializing in weather rockets and ejection seats for jets—Rocket Power, which he formed in Mesa, Ariz., in 1959, and Universal Propulsion Co., which he established in Phoenix in 1963. He was elected to the American Rocket Society (now the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics) in 1951. In 1953, he was given a society award for outstanding contributions.

A full essay on Charles Bartley's contributions to the world of solid propellant rocket motors and the business after their development is contained in:

'''Chen Pixian''' ({{zh|s=陈丕显|t=陳丕顯|p=Chén Pīxiǎn}}; March 20, 1916 &amp;ndash; August 23, 1995) was a Chinese Communist revolutionary and politician. He served in several prominent roles, including party chief of [[Shanghai]] and party chief of [[Hubei]] province. He was purged at the beginning of the [[Cultural Revolution]] but was later rehabilitated.

==Biography==
Chen Pixian was born in [[Shanghang County]], [[Fujian]] in 1916. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1931.

After the People's Republic of China was founded, Chen was the head of the party organization in Shanghai from 1965 to 1967. In 1967, Chen was ousted from power during the [[January Storm]] by radical elements led by [[Zhang Chunqiao]]. Chen spent much of the [[Cultural Revolution]] in solitary confinement. He wrote to Mao to resume his work, to no avail. Eventually [[Deng Xiaoping]] recalled Chen back to work on the pretext of medical treatment, and Chen was given the job of vice chairman of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. After the Cultural Revolution he served as party chief of Hubei.

He became a Secretary of the [[Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee]] in 1982, and was the Secretary of the [[CPC Central Political and Legislative Affairs Committee]] from 1982 to 1985.

Chen died in 1995, aged 89. He was eulogized with standard honours bestowed to high-ranking members of the Communist Party.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
David Liebman was born in 1946 into a Jewish family in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. As a child in 1949 he contracted [[polio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKay|first=George|title=Shakin' All Over: Popular Music and Disability|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780472120048|year=2013|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472052097|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began classical piano lessons at the age of nine and saxophone by twelve. His interest in jazz was sparked by seeing [[John Coltrane]] perform live in New York City clubs such as [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]], the [[Village Vanguard]] and the [[Half Note Club|Half Note]]. Throughout high school and college, Liebman pursued his jazz interest by studying with Joe Allard, [[Lennie Tristano]], and [[Charles Lloyd (jazz musician)|Charles Lloyd]]. Upon graduation from [[New York University]] (with a degree in American History), he began to seriously devote himself to the full-time pursuit of being a jazz artist.

In the early 1970s, after recording with [[Genya Ravan]] and [[Ten Wheel Drive]], Liebman took the leading role (as President) in organizing several dozen musicians into a cooperative, Free Life Communication, which became an integral part of the fertile New York loft jazz scene in the early 1970s and was funded by The New York State Council of the Arts and the Space for Innovative Development. After one year spent with Ten Wheel Drive, one of the early [[jazz fusion]] groups, Liebman secured the saxophone/flute position with the group of John Coltrane's drummer, [[Elvin Jones]]. Within two years, Liebman reached the zenith of his apprenticeship period when [[Miles Davis]] hired him. These years, 1970–74, were filled with tours and recordings. At the same time, Liebman began exploring his own music, first in the Open Sky Trio with [[Bob Moses (musician)|Bob Moses]] and then with pianist [[Richie Beirach]] in the group Lookout Farm. This group recorded for the German-based ECM label as well as A&amp;M Records while touring the U.S., Canada, India, Japan and Europe. Lookout Farm was awarded the number one position in the category "Group Deserving of Wider Recognition"in the 1976 [[Downbeat (magazine)|''Down Beat'']]'s International Critics' Poll. In these years he also played and recorded with [[Pee Wee Ellis]].

In 1977, Liebman toured the world with pianist [[Chick Corea]], followed up the next year by the formation of the David Liebman Quintet with [[John Scofield]], [[Kenny Kirkland]] and [[Terumasa Hino]] as featured sidemen. After several world tours and recordings by the quintet over three years, he reunited with Richard Beirach. They began performing and recording as a duo, as well as creating the group [[Quest (band)|Quest]] in 1981. Beginning with bassist [[George Mraz]] and drummer [[Al Foster]], the group solidified when [[Ron McClure]] and [[Billy Hart]] joined in 1984. Through 1991, Quest recorded seven CDs, toured extensively and did many workshops with students worldwide.

===1990s to present===
After 23 years with the Dave Liebman Group (featuring guitarist Vic Juris), Liebman formed "Expansions" reaching out to the younger generation featuring bassist Tony Marino, pianist Bobby Avey, on reeds Matt Vashlishan and Alex Ritz on drums. Over the past decades, Liebman has often been featured with top European jazz artists such as [[Joachim Kühn]], [[Daniel Humair]], [[Paolo Fresu]], [[Jon Christensen]], [[Bobo Stenson]] and in the World View Trio with Austrian drummer Wolfgang Reisenger and French bassist Jean-Paul Celea. His ability to play in so many diverse styles has led to big band and radio orchestra performances with the Brussels Jazz Orchestra, the [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] and [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] in Germany, the [[Metropole Orchestra]] of the Netherlands, the new music group [[Klangforum Wien]] from [[Vienna]] and, most notably, Liebman was the first improviser to perform with the world-famous [[Ensemble InterContemporain]] founded by [[Pierre Boulez]] in France. On all these occasions, the music is arranged from Liebman's own compositions and improvisations. He has consistently placed among the top finalists in the ''Down Beat'' Critic's and Reader's Polls since 1973 in the Soprano Saxophone category and on occasion, flute. Lieb has been featured on several hundred recordings of which he has been the leader or co-leader on over one hundred. Nearly three hundred original compositions have been recorded. His artistic output has ranged from straight-ahead classic jazz to chamber music, from fusion to avant garde, with numerous CDs featuring original arrangements of the music of [[Thelonious Monk]], Miles Davis, Coltrane, [[Kurt Weill]], [[Alec Wilder]], [[Cole Porter]], [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]], [[Puccini]] and [[the Beatles]].

Liebman has published material on a variety of subjects including instructional DVDs. He has also published chamber music and over the years has contributed regularly to various periodicals, such as the ''Saxophone Journal'' and the ''International Association of Jazz Educators Journal.'' He is the author of several milestone books: ''Self Portrait of a Jazz Artist'', ''Jazz Connections: Miles Davis and David Liebman'', ''A Chromatic Approach to Jazz Harmony and Melody'', and ''Developing a Personal Saxophone Sound.'' Several of these books have been translated to other languages.

His teaching activities at universities and in clinic settings have taken him literally around the world as a result of his varied musical directions and expertise on several instruments, along with an ability to articulate the intricacies of the jazz language, aesthetic and technique. Over the years, he has regularly received grantees to study with him funded by the NEA (U.S.), the Canadian Arts Council, as well as Arts Councils of numerous European countries. In 1989, he founded the International Association of Schools of Jazz (IASJ), an organization dedicated to networking educators and students from international jazz schools through periodic meetings, exchange programs and newsletters. Liebman presently serves as the Artistic Director of the IASJ. He scored music for the JazzEx Ballet Company in the Netherlands in the early 1990s and ''Ocean of Light'' for Katrina and the tsunami tragedies in 2006. Currently, Liebman is the Artist in Residence at the Manhattan School of Music and will be visiting Artist at the University of Toronto for year 2014–15.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Kate.

Liebman and musicologist [[Lewis Porter]] teamed up to develop ''What It Is: The Life of a Jazz Artist'', Liebman's biography. Released in March 2012, the book was well received by jazz critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jazztimes.com/articles/54416-what-it-is-the-life-of-a-jazz-artist-dave-liebman-in-conversation-with-lewis-porter |author=Matt R.

In 1989 he was the Artistic Director of the [[European Music Council|International Association of Schools of Jazz]].  He was an Artist in Residence at the [[Manhattan School of Music]] in New York City, and held an annual Saxophone/Chromatic Harmony Master class held at [[East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania|East Stroudsurg University]] since 1987. He recorded extensively for [[Double-Time Records]] during the 1990s.

'''David William Sanborn''' (born July 30, 1945) is an American [[alto saxophone|alto]] saxophonist. Though Sanborn has worked in many genres, his solo recordings typically blend [[jazz]] with [[instrumental]] [[Pop music|pop]] and [[R&amp;B]].&lt;ref name=penguin /&gt; He released his first solo album ''Taking Off'' in 1975, but has been playing the saxophone since before he was in high school.&lt;ref name=officialbio&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.davidsanborn.com/bio.html| title=Biography| work=Official Community of David Sanborn| accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most commercially successful American saxophonists to earn prominence since the 1980s, Sanborn is described by critic Scott Yannow&lt;ref&gt;Yannow, Scott. "[http://allmusic.com/artist/david-sanborn-p7480/biography David Sanborn – Biography]" from Allmusic.com. Retrieved May 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; as "the most influential saxophonist on pop, R&amp;B, and crossover players of the past 20 years." He is often identified with radio-friendly [[smooth jazz]], but he has expressed a disinclination for the genre and his association with it.&lt;ref name=penguin&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Cook (journalist) |first2= Brian |last2= Morton |authorlink2=Brian Morton (Scottish writer) |title=[[The Penguin Guide to Jazz|The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD]] |origyear=1992 |edition=3 |year=1996 |publisher=[[Penguin Group]] |location= London|isbn=0-14-051368-X|pages=1148–1149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Sanborn was born in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], Florida, and grew up in [[Kirkwood, Missouri|Kirkwood]], Missouri. He suffered from [[polio]] for eight years&lt;ref name=truth&gt;{{cite web| url= http://jazztimes.com/articles/20787-david-sanborn-the-blues-and-the-abstract-truth | title= David Sanborn: The Blues and the Abstract Truth | first= Geoffrey |last= Himes |publisher=Jazztimes.com| date= November 2008 | accessdate= December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his youth. He began playing saxophone on a physician's advice to strengthen his weakened chest muscles and improve his breathing. Alto saxophonist [[Hank Crawford]], at the time a member of [[Ray Charles]]'s band, was an early and lasting influence on Sanborn.&lt;ref name="balfany"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Balfany | first=Greg | date=January–February 1989 | title=David Sanborn | work= Saxophone Journal | volume=13 | issue=4 | pages=28–31 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanborn attended college at [[Northwestern University]] and studied music.&lt;ref name=officialbio /&gt; But he transferred to the [[University of Iowa]] where he played and studied with saxophonist [[J.R. Monterose]].&lt;ref name=officialbio /&gt;

==Career==
Sanborn performed with [[blues]] musicians [[Albert King]] and [[Little Milton]] at the age of 14.&lt;ref name=truth /&gt; He continued playing blues when he joined [[Paul Butterfield]]'s band in 1967.&lt;ref name="balfany"/&gt; Sanborn recorded on four Butterfield albums as a [[horn section]] member and soloist from 1967 to 1971.

In the mid-70s and playing [[bebop]] Sanborn became prominent in the newly popular jazz/funk scene by joining the [[Brecker Brothers]] band where he became influenced by Michael Brecker, and it was with the brothers that he recorded his first solo album, 'Taking Off', nowadays regarded as something of a jazz/funk classic. Although Sanborn is most associated with [[smooth jazz]], he studied [[free jazz]] in his youth with saxophonists [[Roscoe Mitchell]] and [[Julius Hemphill]]. In 1993, he revisited this genre when he appeared on [[Tim Berne]]'s ''Diminutive Mysteries'', dedicated to Hemphill. Sanborn's album ''Another Hand'' featured avant-garde musicians.

In 1985 Sanborn and [[Al Jarreau]] played two sold-out concerts at Chastain Park in Atlanta.&lt;ref name="Inc.1985"&gt;{{cite book|title=Box Score Top Grossing Concerts |work=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT48|date=1 June 1985|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|pages=48–|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recordings===
He has been a highly regarded session player since the late 1960s, playing with an array of well-known artists, such as [[James Brown]], [[Bryan Ferry]], [[Michael Stanley]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Bobby Charles]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Jaco Pastorius]], the [[Michael Brecker|Brecker Brothers]], [[Michael Franks (musician)|Michael Franks]], [[Kenny Loggins]], [[Casiopea]], [[Players Association]], [[David Bowie]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Little Feat]], [[Tommy Bolin]], [[Bob James (musician)|Bob James]], [[James Taylor]], [[Al Jarreau]], [[Pure Prairie League]], [[Kenny G]], [[Loudon Wainwright III]], [[George Benson]], [[Joe Beck]], [[Donny Hathaway]], [[Elton John]], [[Gil Evans]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Guru]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Kenny Garrett]], [[Roger Waters]], [[Steely Dan]], [[Ween]], the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Nena]], [[Utada Hikaru]], The Rolling Stones, Ian Hunter, and [[Toto (band)|Toto]].

His solo recordings have often featured the bassist/multi-instrumentalist and producer [[Marcus Miller]]. He has also done some film scoring for films such as ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' (and its sequels) and ''[[Scrooged]]''. In 1991 Sanborn recorded ''[[Another Hand]]'', which the ''[[All Music Guide to Jazz]]'' described as a "return by Sanborn to his real, true love: unadorned (or only partly adorned) jazz" that "balanced the scales" against his smooth jazz material.&lt;ref name="wynn"&gt;{{Cite book | last =Wynn | first =Ron | authorlink=Ron Wynn | year =1994 | title =All Music Guide to Jazz | place =San Francisco | publisher =Miller Freeman | page=567 | isbn =0-87930-308-5 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album, produced by [[Hal Willner]], featured musicians from outside the smooth jazz scene, such as [[Charlie Haden]], [[Jack DeJohnette]], [[Bill Frisell]], and [[Marc Ribot]].

In 1994 Sanborn appeared in ''[[A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who]]'', also known as ''Daltrey Sings Townshend''. This was a two-night concert at Carnegie Hall produced by [[Roger Daltrey]] of English rock band [[The Who]] in celebration of his fiftieth birthday. In 1994 a CD and a VHS video were issued, and in 1998 a DVD was released. In 1995 he performed in ''[[The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True]]'' a musical performance of the popular story at Lincoln Center to benefit the [[Children's Defense Fund]]. The performance was broadcast on Turner Network Television (TNT) and issued on CD and video in 1996.

In 2006, he was featured in [[Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band]]'s album ''The Phat Pack'' on the track "[[Play That Funky Music]]", a remake of the [[Wild Cherry (band)|Wild Cherry]] hit in a [[big band]] style. Sanborn often performs at Japan's [[Blue Note (jazz clubs)|Blue Note]] venues in [[Nagoya]], [[Osaka]], and Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Sanborn &amp; Blue Note Tokyo All-Star Jazz Orchestra directed by Eric Miyashiro|url=http://www.bluenote.co.jp/jp/artists/bnt-all-star-jazz-orchestra/|website=Blue Note Tokyo|publisher=Blue Note Japan Inc.|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He plays on the song "Your Party" on [[Ween]]'s 2007 release ''[[La Cucaracha (album)|La Cucaracha]]''. On April 8, 2007, Sanborn sat in with [[the Allman Brothers Band]] during their annual run at the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] in New York City. In 2010, Sanborn toured primarily with a trio featuring jazz organist [[Joey DeFrancesco]] and [[Steve Gadd]] where they played the combination of blues and jazz from his album ''Only Everything''. In 2011, Sanborn toured with keyboardist [[George Duke]] and bassist Marcus Miller as the group DMS.

===Broadcasting===
Sanborn has performed on both radio and television broadcasts; he has also acted as a host. From the late 1980s he was a regular guest member of [[Paul Shaffer]]'s band on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''. He also appeared a few times on the ''Late Show with David Letterman'' in the 90s. From 1988–89, he co-hosted ''[[Sunday Night (American TV program)|Night Music]]'', a late-night music show on NBC television with [[Jools Holland]]. Following producer [[Hal Willner]]'s eclectic approach, the show positioned Sanborn with many famed musicians, such as [[Miles Davis]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Pharoah Sanders]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Robert Cray]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Elliott Sharp]], [[Jean-Luc Ponty]], [[Carlos Santana|Santana]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Youssou N'dour]], [[Pere Ubu]], [[Loudon Wainwright III]], [[Mary Margaret O'Hara]], [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Was (Not Was)|Was]], [[John Zorn]], and [[Curtis Mayfield]].

On 21 January 1924, at 18:50 [[Eastern European Time|EET]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], leader of the [[October Revolution]] and the first [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|leader]] and founder of the [[Soviet Union]], died in [[Gorki Leninskiye|Gorki]] aged 53 after falling into a [[coma]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=673–674|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=438|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=194|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=435|5a1=Service|5y=2000|5pp=478–479|6a1=White|6y=2001|6p=176|7a1=Read|7y=2005|7p=269}} The official cause of death was recorded as an incurable disease of the blood vessels.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1994|1p=435|2a1=Lerner|2a2=Finkelstein|2a3=Witztum|2y=2004|2p=372}} Lenin was given a [[state funeral]] and then buried in a specially erected mausoleum on 27 January. A commission of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|RCP(b)]] was in charge of organizing the funeral.

== Funeral service ==
On 23 January, the coffin with Lenin's body was transported by train from Gorki to [[Moscow]] and displayed at the Hall of Columns in the [[House of the Unions]], and it stayed there for three days.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=674|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=439|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3pp=7–8|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=479}}{{sfn|Rice|1990|p=9}} On 27 January, the body of Lenin was delivered to [[Red Square]], accompanied by martial music. There assembled crowds listened to a series of speeches delivered by [[Mikhail Kalinin]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Joseph Stalin]], but notably not [[Leon Trotsky]], who had been convalescing in the [[Caucasus]].{{sfn|Rice|1990|p=9}} Afterwards the body was placed into the vault of a temporary wooden mausoleum (soon to be replaced with present-day [[Lenin's Mausoleum]]), by the [[Moscow Kremlin Wall|Kremlin Wall]].{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=439|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=9|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=479–480}} Despite the freezing temperatures, tens of thousands attended.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=440}}

The commander of the [[Moscow Military District|Moscow Garrison]] issued an order to place the [[guard of honour]] at the mausoleum. The people called it the "Number One Sentry". After the events of the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]], the guard of honour was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/07/world/struggle-in-russia-yeltsin-cancels-guards-at-lenin-s-tomb.html|title=STRUGGLE IN RUSSIA; Yeltsin Cancels Guards at Lenin's Tomb|author=|date=7 October 1993|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Against protestations of [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]], Lenin's widow, Lenin's body was embalmed to preserve it for long-term public display in the Red Square mausoleum.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=674|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=438|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3pp=437–438|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=481}} During this process, Lenin's brain was removed; in 1925 an institute was established to dissect it, revealing that Lenin had suffered from severe [[sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=625–626|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1994|2p=446}}

Russian MP Vladimir Petrov suggested in 2018 that Lenin’s body be buried in 2024, the 100th anniversary of his death, because it was costing the state too much money to house the body in the mausoleum. The body would be replaced with a wax or rubber model of Lenin. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | date=14 November 2018 | title=MP suggests replacing Lenin's mummy with rubber figure | url= http://www.pravdareport.com/news/society/stories/14-11-2018/141990-lenin-0/ | work=Pravda | access-date=22 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4723">'''Walter Earl Durand''' (1913–1939) was an American from Wyoming who became known as an outlaw after he escaped from jail. He killed a total of four officers in the course of resisting capture, two at his house, and two who tried to apprehend him during an 11-day manhunt in the Beartooth Mountains (near the mouth of Clarks Fork Canyon) of Wyoming.

==Early life and education==
Walter Earl Durand was born in 1913 to parents who were farmers in [[Powell, Wyoming]], where he grew up.&lt;ref name="Blewer2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blewer|first=Mac|title=Wyoming's Outlaw Trail|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iMSDNvnX5MC&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=4 May 2014|date=2013-04-15|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781439642061|pages=101–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned all about farming and hunting.

==Mountain man==
He was a [[mountain man]] who lived off the land in the mountains of Wyoming during the years following the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="Pellegrini2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pellegrini|first=Georgia|title=Girl Hunter: Revolutionizing the Way We Eat, One Hunt at a Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MAbiNdAOGAC&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=4 May 2014|year=2011|publisher=Da Capo Lifelong|isbn=9780738214665|pages=78–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested &lt;!-- year? --&gt;for [[poaching]] elk, as he did not believe in the new [[hunting license]] system and refused to get a license.&lt;ref name="Pellegrini2011"/&gt;

While in jail in [[Cody, Wyoming]], Durand escaped by taking a Deputy sheriff/Jailer's gun and forcing the officer to drive him into the countryside&lt;ref name="Simmon2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmon|first=Scott|title=The Invention of the Western Film: A Cultural History of the Genre's First Half Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6imtyUrnerMC&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=4 May 2014|date=2003-06-30|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521555814|pages=166–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  before he returned to his home. Durand shot and killed two police officers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.odmp.org/officer/1420-deputy-sheriff-d-m-baker ODMP memorials Baker and Lewis]&lt;/ref&gt; who came to his house to take him back to jail; then he armed himself and headed into the wilderness of the Beartooth Mountains.&lt;ref name="Blewer2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnston|first=Jeremy M.|title=Powell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCsEYhOh540C&amp;pg=PA81|accessdate=4 May 2014|date=2009-07-08|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781439638088|pages=81–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecutor initially deputized 10 men to form a posse to find and bring Durand in for trial.&lt;ref name="Blewer2013"/&gt; Durand shot and killed two of the possemen who were searching for him.&lt;ref name="Blewer2013"/&gt; The manhunt grew to include the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], sharp shooters, the [[Wyoming National Guard]] with [[artillery]] from [[Francis E.

'''Giorgakis Olympios''' ({{lang-el|Γιωργάκης Ολύμπιος}}; {{lang-ro|Iordache Olimpiotul}}; 1772–1821) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] ''[[Armatoloi|armatolos]]'' and military commander during the [[Greek War of Independence]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Noted for his activities with the [[Filiki Eteria]] in the [[Danubian Principalities]], he is considered to be a leading figure of the Greek Revolution.

==Biography==

===Early activities===
Olympios was of [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Giannēs Koliopoulos|title=Λεηλασία Φρονημάτων|quote=... of a separate Vlach armed band, named after Georgakis Olympios, the Vlach hero of the Greek War of Independence.|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in the village of [[Livadi]], near [[Larissa]], on [[Mount Olympus]], in [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman-ruled Greece]]. After joining the ''Armatolikia'' in the Olympus area around the age of 20, Olympios became a prominent member of the local society by protecting villages from the [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina|Ali Pasha]]'s raids, when the powerful Pasha started expanding his authority out of [[Epirus]]. In 1798, however, he was forced to abandon his birthplace, due to Ali Pasha's hostility towards him, and fled to [[Serbia]], where he collaborated for some time with [[Karađorđe Petrović]] during the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (he is known in Serbia as Kapetan Jorgać, ''Captain Giorgakis'').

Olympios became a supporter of the ideas diffused by [[Rigas Feraios]] for a common [[Balkans|Balkan]] revolution against the Ottoman rule, and moved to [[Wallachia]]. There, with the help of [[Constantine Ypsilantis]], he composed a military force of [[Greeks]] to fight alongside the [[Russian Empire]] in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Russo-Turkish War of 1806]]. After the [[Battle of Ostrova]], he was named a ''[[Polkovnik]]'' in the [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Russian Army]]. [[List of Russian rulers|Emperor]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] included him in the Russian military escort during the [[Congress of Vienna]], where Olympios met with [[Alexander Ypsilantis]], a [[Filiki Eteria]] leader.

===Greek War of Independence===
Olympios entered Filiki Eteria in 1817, taking the high rank of ''Shepherd''. He initiated many others in the Eteria, and established contacts with the Wallachian [[Vladimirescu's Pandurs|Pandur]] [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], who led the parallel [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|uprising of 1821]]. Olympios married [[Čučuk Stana]], the widow of [[Veljko Petrović|Hajduk Veljko]], who had arrived from Serbia to participate in the Greek War of Independence as a fighter, alongside his own men. They had three children: sons Milanos and Alexandros and daughter Euphrosyne.&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;{{Not in citation given||reason=Names of offspring not mentioned in source.|date=February 2018}}

At the beginning of the [[Greek War of Independence]], when the Eteria began its expedition in [[Moldavia]] and Wallachia, Olympios was appointed leader of the Greek forces in [[Bucharest]] by Alexander Ypsilantis, at first cooperating with [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], who led the parallel [[Wallachian uprising (1821)|Wallachian uprising]]. However, when Vladimirescu distanced himself from the Fililiki Eteria, Olympios was responsible for his arrest on 1 June in [[Bălilești|Goleşti]] - following which Vladimirescu was summarily put to death .

He took part in the [[Battle of Sculeni]] on 29 June 1821, when Ottoman forces chased him (along with [[Yiannis Pharmakis]] and a small force of 400 Greeks) to the [[Secu Monastery]] in the [[Neamț County]], where the Greeks made their last stand. Olympios died during the Ottoman attack on the monastery. His widow and children fled to [[Khotyn]], then part of the [[Bessarabia Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]], where other people of the [[Serbian revolution|Serbian]]- and Greek War, had taken refuge. After the liberation of [[Greece]], Stana and her children moved to [[Athens]].&lt;ref name=AO&gt;[Δημήτρης Φωτιάδης,Επανάσταση του 21 , τ.Α,σ.445]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Hiroshi Ōnishi'''|大西 博}} (June 18, 1961 – March 31, 2011) was a Japanese painter and university professor.

==Life and work==
=== Youth and Early Work ===
Born on June 18, 1961, on [[Shikoku Island]], in [[Tokushima Prefecture]], he grew up in [[Osaka]] from the age of three.
Two significant incidents during his childhood awakened his interest in Western culture: the 1970 [[Expo '70|World's fair in Osaka]], and the instructions in Western painting by the artist Kakuichi Shikawa.
When he was 12, his family moved to [[Tokyo]], where he passed the entrance examinations for the Tokyo University of the Arts ([[Tokyo Geijutsu Daigaku|Tōkyō Geijutsu Daigaku]]) in 1983.
In 1989 he completed his studies with a Masters in Art Theory, specializing in Oil Painting, Technique and Materials. His thesis work “La Truite” (“The Trout”, 1987) was purchased by the Japanese Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://db.am.geidai.ac.jp/object.cgi?id=22780 La Truite (Website, Tokyo University of the Arts)]&lt;/ref&gt; His second work, “The Salmon”, 1989 by the [[Daiwa Bank]].
During this phase, he oriented his work strongly toward the European [[Renaissance]], in which his human forms are evocative of [[Albrecht Dürer]] or [[Matthias Grünewald]], in combination with his conceptions of fish and water.
After his academic studies he worked for one year as a research assistant in the Department of Oil Painting, Technique and Materials.

=== Murals ===
In subsequent years he created more surreal and expressive oil paintings. Simultaneously, from 1983 to 1992, he worked as a [[mural]]ist for the department store Shibuya PARCO in Tokyo. Later in his writings, he called this job Kaisha ni okeru katsudō (in English, “the establishment-concerned workings”). On surfaces of 4.5 x 13m, respectively, 4.5 x 9m, he painted advertisements for various products on the exterior walls of the department store. In the beginning he painted solo, later he engaged additional artists for these assignments.

=== Academic Studies in Germany ===
From 1992 to 1997, Hiroshi Onishi studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in [[Nuremberg]], Germany under Günter Dollhopf. In 1996 he was designated a Master Student. His experimentation with paper, acrylic, India ink, fabric and pigments became a quest for his Japanese roots.

=== Return to Japan and Main Work ===
[[File:色景 (Landschaft).jpg|thumb|„View of Remembrance I“ (2009). 3,88 x 1,94 m, lapislazuli canvas]]
[[File:Schiebetüren für Nanzen-ji.jpeg|thumb|Fusuma-e for Nanzen-ji, Omotesando Gallery Exhibition, Tokyo, 2011]]
In February 1998 he returned to Japan, initially to work as an Assistant Professor, later as a Professor, at his [[alma mater]], Tokyo University of the Arts.
In 2003, on assignment from the University, he undertook two trips to Afghanistan where he discovered the mineral [[lapis lazuli]] as a raw material for his work and rediscovered it as a pigment for traditional painting.
This [[ultramarine]] pigment, created through an extremely complex process, he initially used for his painting and later for the creation of tea ceremony implements. Together with the Japanese company Holbein Ltd., he developed a premium quality lapis lazuli watercolor.

As Professor in the Department of Oil Painting, Technique and Material at the Tōkyō Geijutsu Daigaku he taught the traditional production of the lapis lazuli pigment in the tradition of [[Cennino Cennini]] from 1300 A.D.

Sensational exhibitions of this painting technique led to his most important and honored assignment: on the plot of a famous Zen Temple in Kyoto, the [[Nanzen-ji]], he was to paint a hall in the Tenjuan Temple with his lapis lazuli technique. This work comprised 73 [[Fusuma]]-e (paintings on sliding doors). He was able to complete 12 Fusuma-e.

On March 31, 2011, he died in a boating accident on [[Lake Biwa]], aged 49.

=== A Retrospective of his Work ===
From March 20 to April 8, 2012 the first show of his collective works took place posthumously on the campus of the Tōkyō Geijutsu Daigaku titled, “ONISHI HIROSHI Retrospective – View of Remembrance 大西博　回顧展　幻景“.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geidai.ac.jp/museum/exhibit/2012/oonishi/oonishi_en.htm ONISHI HIROSHI Retrospective – View of Remembrance (Website, Tokyo University of The Arts)]&lt;/ref&gt; Next to his many early works, oil paintings created using his lapis lazuli technique were also shown. In addition, the collection of tea ceremony utensils was presented for the first time. It consists of 30 ceremonial teacups fired with lapis lazuli pigment. Also included were accessories in bamboo and wood, which were lacquered with lapis lazuli pigment.

For Hiroshi Onishi the link between Eastern and Western painting was a central theme.
A part of his work is now in Germany with his widow, Martina Wagner-Onishi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ruriko.de/ RURIKO - Intercultural meeting place between Germany and Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Huang Fu''' ({{zh|s=黄郛|t=黃郛|p= Huáng Fú |w=Huang Fu}})  (8 March 1883 – 6 December 1936) was a general and politician in early [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].

==Biography==
[[File:Huang Fu.jpg|left|thumb|Huang Fu]]
Huang studied at Zhejiang Military College and [[Qiushi Academy]] (current [[Zhejiang University]]), later was sent to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zju.edu.cn/~piclib/fazhan/tuku/rw01.htm ÖªÃûÈËÎï&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029234857/http://www.zju.edu.cn/~piclib/fazhan/tuku/rw01.htm|date=29 October 2009}} at www.zju.edu.cn&lt;/ref&gt; Huang came in contact with the [[Tongmenghui]] while studying at the [[Tokyo Shimbu Gakko]], a military academy in [[Tokyo]] in 1905 and met [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and [[Zhang Qun]] in 1907 when they arrived to study in Japan as well. In 1908, he studied surveying under the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], and returned to China in 1910.
During the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]], he and [[Chen Qimei]] declared [[Shanghai]] to be independent of the [[Empire of China]], and became [[blood brothers]] with Chiang Kai-shek.

He was forced to flee abroad after the failed [[Second Revolution (China)|Second Revolution of 1913]] against [[Yuan Shikai]], travelling via Japan to the United States, and returned in 1916 to participate in the final stages of the [[National Protection War]], and to represent [[Zhejiang]]'s military government in Beijing.  When [[Sun Yatsen]] ordered [[Kuomintang]] members to swear personal loyalty to him, Huang objected and left politics.

Huang reappeared into public life by supporting China's entry into [[World War I]] hoping it would regain lost territories.  He worked with President [[Xu Shichang]] as a diplomat, co-wrote books about economics and foreign affairs and would often guest lecturer at universities.  He was part of China's delegation to the 1921 [[Washington Naval Conference]] which secured the [[Beiyang government]]'s greatest diplomatic triumph, the return of [[Shandong Problem|Shandong]].

After the fall of [[Cao Kun]] in the 1924 [[Beijing coup]], he joined the [[Zhili clique]] and became acting [[president of the Republic of China]] on the request of [[Feng Yuxiang]].  He declared [[Cao Kun]]'s term illegal because it was obtained through bribery and also repudiated the agreement which allowed former Emperor [[Puyi]] to continue to live in the [[Forbidden City]].

Huang was influential in winning over Feng Yuxiang and [[Yan Xishan]] to Chiang Kai-shek's faction of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) which was one of the major reasons why [[Wang Jingwei]]'s [[Wuhan]] regime collapsed. He later served under several offices during the [[Nanjing decade]] including Shanghai mayor, foreign minister, and chairman of the North China Political Council.  Despite his close ties to Chiang, he never rejoined the KMT as he did not want to be associated with the opportunists who joined during and after the [[Northern Expedition]].  In 1933, he signed the unpopular [[Tanggu Truce]] which ceded [[Chahar (province)|Chahar]], [[Rehe (province)|Rehe]], and part of [[Hebei]] to [[Manchukuo]].  Like Chiang, he viewed the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] as a greater threat than the Japanese.
Huang died of [[lung cancer]] in Shanghai in 1936.

==Early life and education==

==Career==
Cichocki began his career as an expert on armed conflict and ethnic tensions within the former [[Soviet Union]] for the [[Centre for Eastern Studies]] in 1992, working for the centre until 2008.&lt;ref name=mat2011nov/&gt; Additionally, Cichocki also was employed as a programme assistant at the [[Stefan Batory Foundation]] for its East-Central Europe Forum, where he worked from 1995 to 1997.&lt;ref name=mat2011nov/&gt; He became deputy director of the Centre for Eastern Studies in 2001.&lt;ref name=mat2011nov/&gt; From 2004 to 2007, he served as the head of the centre.&lt;ref name=osw&gt;{{cite news|title=History of OSW|url=http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/history-osw|accessdate=28 March 2013|work=The Centre for Eastern Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this term, Cichocki joined the government of Prime Minister [[Donald Tusk]], working as a secretary of state for security services in the Chancellery from 2007 to November 2011.&lt;ref name=war2009&gt;{{cite news|title=Bugging Scandal Sparks Big Brother Fears|url=http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/index.php/index.php?view=details&amp;id=5751%3Abugging-scandal-sparks-big-brother-fears&amp;option=com_eventlist&amp;Itemid=326|accessdate=28 March 2013|work=Warsaw Voice|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following a cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Tusk, Cichocki was appointed interior minister in Tusk's [[Second Cabinet of Donald Tusk|second cabinet]] on 18 November 2011, where Cichocki presided over the nation's law enforcement services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President appointed the new government|url=http://www.president.pl/en/news/news/art,236,president-appointed-the-new-government.html|publisher=President of Poland|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cichocki replaced [[Jerzy Miller (politician)|Jerzy Miller]] in the post. During his tenure, Cichocki presided over security operations during the [[UEFA Euro 2012|UEFA Euro 2012 football championship]], defending the event's security preparations and the [[Policja]]'s response to the 12 June 2012 violent clashes between Polish and Russian fans in [[Warsaw]] coinciding with a match between both teams.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|title=Euro 2012: Poland minister calls for severe sanctions on hooligans|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/13/euro-2012-poland-russia-hooligans|accessdate=5 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the riot, Cichocki demanded prosecutors to aggressively pursue legal actions against detained Polish hooligans to "fully feel the consequences of their antics," while ordering arrested Russian fans to be deported and excluded from entering the [[Schengen Area]] for five years.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Cichocki concluded after the championship's completion that far fewer people were arrested during the events than had been expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Much less arrests than expected’ during Euro 2012|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/203/Artykul/104541,%E2%80%98Much-less-arrests-than-expected%E2%80%99-during-Euro-2012-says-Interior-Minister|work=Polskie Radio|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Cichocki's tenure at the interior ministry lasted until 25 February 2013, when he was replaced by [[Bartłomiej Sienkiewicz]].

'''Jean-Louis Forain''' (23 October 1852 – 11 July 1931) was a [[France|French]] [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painter, lithographer, watercolorist and etcher.

==Life and work==

Forain was born in [[Reims]], [[Marne]] but at age eight, his family moved to [[Paris]]. He began his career working as a [[caricaturist]] for several Paris journals including ''Le Monde Parisien'' and ''Le rire satirique''. Wanting to expand his horizons, he enrolled at the [[École des Beaux Arts]], studying under [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] as well as another sculptor/painter, [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]]. Forain's quick and often biting wit allowed him to befriend poets [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Paul Verlaine]] as well as many writers, most notably [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]. He was one of only "seven known recipients" to receive a first edition of [[A Season in Hell]] directly from Rimbaud.{{sfnp|Robb|2000|p=233|ps=: Rimbaud gave the others to his mother, [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Ernest Delahaye]], [[Raoul Ponchon]], [[Jean Richepin]] and Ernest Millot.}} He was the youngest artist to frequent and participate in the feverish debates led by [[Édouard Manet]] and [[Edgar Degas]] at the [[Café de la Nouvelle Athènes]] in Montmartre.

A follower and protégé of Degas, Forain joined the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] circle in time to take part in the fourth independent exhibition in 1879; he participated in four of the eight Impressionist Exhibitions (1879, 1880, 1881 et 1886). Influenced by Impressionist theories on light and color, he depicts scenes of everyday life: his watercolors, pastels, and paintings focused on Parisian popular entertainments and themes of modernity—the racetrack, the ballet, the comic opera, and bustling cafés. Forain is the most famous caricaturist of the ''Belle époque'', and draw, among others, for the [[Le Figaro|Figaro]] for more than 30 years. From 1898 - 1899 Forain worked as an illustrator for the weekly French magazine [[Psst...!]], a satirical publication to promote the anti-[[Alfred Dreyfus|Dreyfus]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kedem-auctions.com/content/psst-anti-semitic-anti-dreyfus-graphic-weekly-paris-1898-1899&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from being influenced by his friend of over fifty years, [[Edgar Degas]], Forain was greatly influenced by [[Honoré Daumier]]; and his treatment of subjects in his drawings for publications such as ''[[Le Figaro]]'' and ''[[Le Courrier français (1884–1913)|Le Courrier Francais]]'' are often reminiscent of Daumier's. In 1892 he published the first volume of ''La Comédie Parisienne,'' a collection of Forain's illustrations and commentary on the major stories political stories that disrupted France’s Third Republic—such as the anarchic crisis and the Dreyfus affair. In 1891 Forain married the painter [[Jeanne Forain|Jeanne Bosc]] with whom he had a son, Jean-Loup, born in 1895.

During the first World War, Forain's illustrations honored the patriotism of his contemporaries; and he enlisted in the Section de Camouflage under [[Lucien-Victor Guirand de Scévola]]. In his later years, Forain created numerous scenes of the Law Courts and other Parisian institutions plus social satire caricatures on late 19th and early 20th century French life. In 1931, shortly before his death, he was made a member of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in [[London]]. He was one of France's best known and revered artists during his time and may best be remembered for his numerous drawings chronicling and commenting on Parisian city life at the end of the 19th century. Followers and admirers of Forain's work include [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]].

'''Julius De Vigne''' ([[Ghent]], 19 November 1844 – 1906) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] lawyer, politician and writer. He studied law at the [[University of Ghent]] and established himself as a lawyer. For several years, he was a member of the provincial - and municipal Council of Ghent. As a student at the university, he contributed to the student almanacs, published by the [[Flanders|Flemish]] literary student organization [['t zal wel gaan]]. When the Flemish weekly ''Het Volksbelang'' was founded by [[Julius Vuylsteke]], in 1867, he was one of the editors together with [[Julius Sabbe]], [[Jozef Van Hoorde]], and [[Adolf Hoste]].

In 1883 he was the primary supporter of the third ''Taalwet'' (E: language law), which stated that at the public schools and ''Royal Athenaea'' in [[Flanders]], education would be preferably in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] instead of [[French language|French]].

'''Lin Biao''' (December 5, 1907 – September 13, 1971) was a [[Marshal of the People's Republic of China]] who was pivotal in the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] [[Chinese Communist Revolution|victory]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]], especially in [[Northeast China]]. Lin was the general who commanded the decisive [[Liaoshen Campaign|Liaoshen]] and [[Pingjin Campaign]]s, in which he co-led the Manchurian Field Army to victory and led the [[People's Liberation Army]] into Beijing. He crossed the [[Yangtze River]] in 1949, decisively defeated the [[Kuomintang]] and took control of the coastal provinces in [[Southeast China]]. He ranked third among the Ten Marshals. [[Zhu De]] and [[Peng Dehuai]] were considered senior to Lin, and Lin ranked directly ahead of [[He Long]] and [[Liu Bocheng]].

Lin abstained from taking an active role in politics after the civil war ceased in 1949.  He led a section of the government's civil bureaucracy as one of the co-serving [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|Deputy Vice Premiers]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] from 1954 onwards, becoming First-ranked Vice Premier from 1964. Lin became more active in politics when named one of the co-serving [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Vice Chairmen]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] in 1958. He held the three responsibilities of Vice Premier, Vice Chairman and [[Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China|Minister of National Defense]] from 1959 onwards. Lin became instrumental in creating the foundations for [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[cult of personality]] in the early 1960s, and was rewarded for his service in the [[Cultural Revolution]] by being named Mao's designated successor as the sole Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China, from 1966 until his death.

Lin died on September 13, 1971, when a [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]] he was aboard crashed in [[Öndörkhaan]] in [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]]. The exact events of this "Lin Biao incident" have been a source of speculation ever since. The Chinese government's official explanation is that Lin and his family attempted to flee following a [[Project 571 Outline|botched coup]] against Mao. Others have argued that they fled out of fear they would be purged, as Lin's relationship with other Communist Party leaders had soured in the final few years of his life. Following Lin's death, he was officially condemned as a traitor by the Communist Party. Since the late 1970s Lin, and Mao's wife [[Jiang Qing]] (with her [[Gang of Four]]) have been labeled the two major "counter-revolutionary forces" of the Cultural Revolution, receiving official blame from the Chinese government.

==Revolutionary==
===Youth===
[[File:Lin Biao Blue Sky White Sun.jpg|thumb|Lin Biao in [[Kuomintang]] uniform|200px]]
Lin Biao was the son of a prosperous merchant family in [[Huanggang]], [[Hubei]].&lt;ref name="L69"&gt;Leung 69&lt;/ref&gt; His name at birth was "'''Lin Yurong'''".&lt;ref name="L&amp;D" /&gt; Lin's father opened a small handicrafts factory in the mid-late 1910s, but was forced to close the factory due to "heavy taxes imposed by local militarists". After closing the factory, Lin's father worked as a [[purser]] aboard a river steamship. Lin entered primary school in 1917,&lt;ref name="Lin164"&gt;Lin 164&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to Shanghai in 1919 to continue his education.&lt;ref name="L&amp;D"&gt;Lazitch and Drachkovitch 265–267&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Lin was much more interested in participating in student movements than in pursuing his formal education.&lt;ref name="Lee170"&gt;Lee 170&lt;/ref&gt; Lin transferred to Wuchang Gongjin High School (武昌共进中学) at 15.&lt;ref&gt;http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/126778/126780/7490123.html 15岁转入武昌共进中学&lt;/ref&gt; Lin joined a satellite organization of the [[Communist Youth League]] before he graduated high school in 1925. Later in 1925 he participated in the [[May Thirtieth Movement]] and enrolled in the newly established [[Whampoa Military Academy|Whampoa (Huangpu) Military Academy]] in [[Guangzhou]].&lt;ref name="L69" /&gt;

As a young cadet, Lin admired the personality of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] (Jiang Jieshi), who was then the Principal of the Academy.&lt;ref name="Lee170" /&gt; At Whampoa, Lin also studied under [[Zhou Enlai]], who was eight years older than Lin. Lin had no contact with Zhou after their time in Whampoa, until they met again in [[Yan'an]] in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Barnonin and Yu 240&lt;/ref&gt; Lin's relationship with Zhou was never especially close, but they rarely opposed each other directly.&lt;ref name="MMW140" /&gt;

After graduating from Whampoa in 1926, Lin was assigned to a regiment commanded by [[Ye Ting]]. Less than a year after graduating from Whampoa, Lin was ordered to participate in the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]], rising from deputy platoon leader to battalion commander in the [[National Revolutionary Army]] within a few months. It was during the Northern Expedition that Lin joined the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="L69" /&gt; By 1927 Lin was a colonel.

When he was 20 Lin married a girl from the countryside with the family name "Ong". This marriage was arranged by Lin's parents, and the couple never became close. When Lin left the Kuomintang to become a communist revolutionary, Ong did not accompany Lin, and their marriage effectively ended.&lt;ref name="Lee170" /&gt;

===Chinese Civil War===
After the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|Kuomintang-Communist split,]] Lin's commander, Ye Ting, joined forces with [[He Long]] and participated in the [[Nanchang Uprising]] on August 1, 1927.&lt;ref name="L&amp;D" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leung 70&lt;/ref&gt; During the campaign Lin worked as a company commander under a regiment led by [[Chen Yi (communist)|Chen Yi]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 242&lt;/ref&gt; Following the failure of the revolt, Lin escaped to the remote Communist base areas, and joined [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhu De]] in the [[Jiangxi–Fujian Soviet]] in 1928. After joining forces with Mao, Lin became one of Mao's closest supporters.&lt;ref name="MMW140" /&gt;

Lin became one of the most senior military field commanders within the Jiangxi Soviet. He commanded the First Army Group, and achieved a degree of power comparable to that of Peng Dehuai, who commanded the Third Army Group. According to [[Comintern]] representative [[Otto Braun (communist)|Otto Braun]], Lin was "politically... a blank sheet on which Mao could write as he pleased" during this period. After [[Ningdu Conference|Mao was removed from power in 1932]] by his rivals (the [[28 Bolsheviks]]), Lin frequently attended strategic meetings in Mao's name and openly attacked the plans of Mao's enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Hu Chi-hsi 253&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Jiangxi Soviet, Lin's First Army Group was the best-equipped and arguably most successful force within the [[Chinese Red Army|Red Army]]. Lin's First Army became known for its mobility, and for its ability to execute successful flanking maneuvers. Between 1930 and 1933, Lin's forces captured twice the number of prisoners of war and military equipment as the Third and Fifth Army Groups combined. The successes of Lin's forces are due partially to the division of labour within the Red Army: Lin's forces were more offensive and unorthodox than other groups, allowing Lin to capitalize on other Red Army commanders' successes.&lt;ref&gt;Hu Chi-hsi 263&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Communists' defense against Chiang's 1933–34 [[Fifth Encirclement Campaign against Jiangxi Soviet|Fifth Encirclement Campaign]], Lin advocated a strategy of protracted guerilla warfare, and opposed the positional warfare advocated by Braun and his supporters. Lin believed that the best way to destroy enemy soldiers was not to pursue them or defend strategic points, but to weaken the enemy through feints, ambushes, encirclements, and surprise attacks. Lin's views generally conformed with the tactics advocated by Mao.&lt;ref&gt;Hu Chi-hsi 257–260&lt;/ref&gt;

After Chiang's forces successfully occupied several strategic locations within the Jiangxi Soviet, in 1934, Lin was one of the first Red Army commanders to publicly advocate the abandonment of the Jiangxi Soviet, but he was opposed by most Red Army commanders, especially Braun and Peng Dehuai.&lt;ref&gt;Hu Chi-hsi 264&lt;/ref&gt; After the Communists finally resolved to abandon their base, later in 1934, Lin continued his position as one of the most successful commanders in the Red Army during the [[Long March]]. Under the direction of Mao and Zhou, the Red Army finally arrived at the remote Communist base of [[Yan'an]], [[Shaanxi]], in December 1936.

Lin and Peng Dehuai were generally considered the Red Army's best battlefield commanders, and were not rivals during the [[Long March]]. Both of them had supported Mao's rise to ''de facto'' leadership at the [[Zunyi Conference]] in January 1935. Lin may have become privately dissatisfied with Mao's strategy of constant evasion by the end of the Long March, but continued to support Mao publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury 188&lt;/ref&gt;

The American journalist [[Edgar Snow]] met Lin Biao in the Communist base of [[Shaanxi]] in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;Hu Chi-hsi 267&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote about Lin in his book, ''[[Red Star Over China]]''. Snow's account focused more on the role of Peng than Lin, evidently having had long conversations with, and devoting two whole chapters to, Peng (more than any individual apart from Mao). But he says of Lin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lin Biao did not present the bluff, lusty face of Peng Dehuai. He was ten years younger, rather slight, oval-faced, dark, handsome. Peng talked with his men. Lin kept his distance. To many he seemed shy and reserved. There are no stories reflecting warmth and affection for his men. His fellow Red Army commanders respected Lin, but when he spoke, it was all business&amp;nbsp;...

The contrast between Mao's top field commanders could hardly have been more sharp, but on the Long March they worked well together, Lin specializing in feints, masked strategy, surprises, ambushes, flank attacks, pounces from the rear, and stratagems. Peng met the enemy head-on in frontal assaults and fought with such fury that again and again he wiped them out. Peng did not believe a battle well fought unless he managed to replenish—and more than replenish—any losses by seizure of enemy guns and converting prisoners of war to new and loyal recruits to the Red Army.&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury 191–192&lt;/ref&gt;

With Mao Zedong, Lin Biao shared the distinction of being one of the few Red commanders never wounded. Engaged on the front in more than a hundred battles, in field command for more than 10 years, exposed to every hardship that his men have known, with a reward of $100,000 on his head, he miraculously remained unhurt and in good health.

In 1932, Lin Biao was given command of the 1st Red Army Corps, which then numbered about 20,000 rifles. It became the most dreaded section of the Red Army. Chiefly due to Lin's extraordinary talent as a tactician, it destroyed, defeated or outmanoeuvered every Government force sent against it and was never broken in battle&amp;nbsp;....

Like many able Red commanders, Lin has never been outside China, speaks and reads no language but Chinese. Before the age of 30, however, he has already won recognition beyond Red circles. His articles in the Chinese Reds' military magazines&amp;nbsp;... have been republished, studied and criticised in [[Nanking]] (Nanjing) military journals, and also in Japan and Soviet Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Snow 135&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;  (Within a year of Snow's reporting this, Lin was seriously wounded).&lt;ref name="MMW141"&gt;Mackerras, McMillen, and Watson 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Lin and Mao generally had a close personal relationship,&lt;ref&gt;Snow 84&lt;/ref&gt; but some accounts claim that Lin sometimes made disparaging comments about Mao in private, and that Lin's support of Mao was largely for the pursuit of power.&lt;ref&gt;Chang and Halliday 504&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving in Yan'an, Lin became the principal of the newly founded [[Counter-Japanese University|Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Military and Political University]]. In 1937, Lin married one of the students there, a girl named Liu Ximin, who had earned the nickname "University Flower".&lt;ref&gt;Lee 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Sino–Japanese War (1937–1945)===
[[File:Lin Biao family.jpg|thumb|right|Lin Biao with wife [[Ye Qun]] and their children]]
In August 1937, Lin was named commander-in-chief of the 115th Division of the Communist [[8th Route Army]]&lt;ref name="L&amp;D" /&gt; and ordered to aid [[Yan Xishan]]'s forces in repelling the Japanese invasion of [[Shanxi]]. In this capacity, Lin orchestrated the [[Battle of Pingxingguan|ambush at Pingxingguan]] in September 1937, which was one of the few battlefield successes for the Chinese in the early period of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (known in China as the "War of Resistance Against Japan").

In 1938, while he was still leading Chinese forces in Shanxi, Japanese soldiers who had joined the Communists and were serving under Lin's command presented Lin with a [[Imperial Japanese Army Uniforms|Japanese uniform]] and ''[[Shin guntō|katana]]'', which they had captured in battle. Lin then put the uniform and katana on, jumped onto a horse, and rode away from the army. While riding, Lin was spotted alone by a sharpshooter in Yan's army. The soldier was surprised to see a Japanese officer riding a horse in the desolate hills alone. He took aim at Lin and severely injured him.&lt;ref name="Lee171"&gt;Lee 171&lt;/ref&gt; The bullet grazed Lin's head, penetrating deep enough to leave a permanent impression on his skull.&lt;ref name="HL4"&gt;Hannam and Lawrence 4&lt;/ref&gt; After being shot in the head, Lin fell from his horse and injured his back.&lt;ref name="Lee171" /&gt;

Recovering from his wounds and ill with [[tuberculosis]], Lin left for [[Moscow]] at the end of 1938, where he served as the representative of the Communist Party of China to the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]]. He remained in Moscow until February 1942, working on [[Comintern]] affairs and writing for its publication.&lt;ref name="L&amp;D" /&gt; Lin was accompanied by his wife, Liu Ximin, but their relationship deteriorated in Moscow, and Lin eventually returned to Yan'an without her.&lt;ref name="Lee171" /&gt;

While in Moscow, Lin became infatuated with Zhou Enlai's adopted daughter, [[Sun Weishi]], who was studying in Moscow from 1938 to 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohsnapnews.com/in-1945-sun-weishi-declined-lin-biaos-rationale-courtship/1817/|title=Lin Biao and Sun Weishi|author=|date=|website=ohsnapnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before returning to China, in 1942, Lin proposed to Sun and promised to divorce his wife, from whom Lin had become estranged. Sun was not able to accept Lin's proposal, but promised to consider marrying Lin after completing her studies. Lin divorced Liu Ximin after returning to China, and married another woman, [[Ye Qun]], in 1943. The relationship between Sun and Ye was notably bad.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang 2&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to Yan'an, Lin was involved in troop training and indoctrination assignments.

===Liaoshen Campaign===

[[File:Lin biao xiao.png|thumb|right|200|Lin as commander-in-chief of the Manchurian Field Army (~1947-1948)]]
Lin was absent for most of the fighting during World War II, but was elected the sixth-ranking [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] member in 1945 based on his earlier battlefield reputation.&lt;ref name="MMW141" /&gt; After the Japanese surrender, the Communists moved large numbers of troops to [[Manchuria]] (Northeast China), and Lin Biao relocated to Manchuria to command the new "Communist Northeast Military District". The Soviets transferred captured Japanese military equipment to the Communists, making Lin's army one of the most well-equipped Communist forces in China. By the time that units from the Kuomintang (Nationalists) were able to arrive in the major cities of Manchuria, Lin's forces were already in firm control of most of the countryside and surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;Leung 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1945, Lin had 280,000 troops in Manchuria under his command,&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 103&lt;/ref&gt; but according to Kuomintang estimates only 100,000 of these were regular forces with access to adequate equipment. The KMT also estimated that Lin also had access to 100,000 irregular auxiliaries, whose membership was drawn mainly from unemployed factory workers. Lin avoided decisive confrontations throughout 1945, and he was able to preserve the strength of his army despite criticism from his peers in the Party and the PLA.&lt;ref&gt;Lew 32–36&lt;/ref&gt;

For the sake of bargaining with the Kuomintang in peace negotiations in 1946, Mao ordered Lin to assemble his army to take and defend key cities, which was against the previous strategy of the Red Army. Lin disagreed with this position, but was ordered by Mao to draw the KMT into a decisive battle and "not give an inch of land" around [[Battle of Siping|Siping, Jilin]]. In April 15, Lin orchestrated an ambush and forced KMT forces there to withdraw with heavy casualties. When the local KMT commander, [[Du Yuming]], launched a counterattack on April 18, Mao ordered the troops there to hold the city indefinitely. The fighting continued until Mao finally allowed Lin to withdraw on May 19, which Lin did immediately, barely saving his army from encirclement and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Lew 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Du pursued Lin's forces to the south bank of the [[Songhua River]], where they halted due to Du's concerns about his army becoming overextended. According to Communist sources, Lin's army lost 15,000 soldiers in the fighting and withdrawal, but Nationalist sources claim that 25,000 soldiers also deserted or surrendered, and that Lin's force of 100,000 irregular auxiliaries suffered from mass desertion during the retreat. On June 10, the two forces agreed to a ceasefire brokered by [[George Marshall]], and fighting temporarily ceased. Mao ordered Lin to counterattack that winter, but Lin refused, replying that his forces were exhausted and not logistically prepared to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Lew 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;

When Du led the majority of his forces to attack Communist forces on the [[Korea]]n border in January 1947, Lin finally ordered 20,000 of his soldiers to cross the Songhua River, where they staged guerrilla raids, ambushed relief forces, attacked isolated garrisons, and avoided decisive confrontations with strong units Du sent to defeat them. While they did so, they looted large quantities of supplies and destroyed the infrastructure of the KMT-held territories that they passed through, including bridges, railroads, fortifications, electrical lines, and boats. When Du sent his forces back south, they were ambushed and defeated. When Du requested reinforcements from Chiang Kai-shek, his request was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Lew 66–68&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8, Lin moved his headquarters from [[Harbin]] to [[Shuangcheng]] in order to be closer to the front. On May 5, he held a conference with his subordinates and announced that his armies would change tactics, engage in a large-scale counterattack, and seek to defeat Du's forces in a decisive battle. On May 8, Lin launched the first of his "three great campaigns", the Summer Offensive, intending to engage a large garrison at [[Huaide]] while a second force positioned itself to ambush the force that would predictably be sent to relieve it. On May 17, they won a major victory and forced the survivors to retreat to Changchun and Siping. By the end of May 1947, Lin's forces had taken control of most of the countryside (everything except for the rail lines and several major cities), infiltrated and destroyed most KMT forces in Manchuria, and re-established contact with isolated Communist forces in southern [[Liaoning]] province.&lt;ref&gt;Lew 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

After the victory of the Summer Offensive, Lin's forces gained the initiative and Kuomintang defensive strategy became static and reactionary. Lin ordered his forces to besiege Siping, but they suffered very high casualties and made little progress, partially due to the defenders' strong entrenched position and air support, and due to the attackers' poor artillery support (Lin only had seventy pieces of artillery around Siping). Lin's forces broke into the city twice and engaged in street-to-street fighting, but were driven back both times with heavy casualties. By June 19, Lin's assault troops had become increasingly exhausted, and Lin began to rotate them to prevent them from becoming completely ineffective. On June 24, Nationalist reinforcements arrived from the south to lift the siege. Lin recognized that he did not have enough manpower left to defeat them, and on July 1, he ordered his forces to retreat back to the north of the Songhua River.&lt;ref&gt;Lew 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

The Communists suffered over 30,000 losses at Siping, and may have suffered a desertion rate of over 20% during the withdrawal, while the Nationalist garrison at Siping fell from 20,000 to slightly over 3,000 before the siege was broken. Lin volunteered to write a self-criticism after the defeat. He also criticized his commander at Siping, [[Li Tianyou]], for demonstrating poor tactics and for lacking "revolutionary spirit". Despite the army's setbacks he reorganized the army, combining surviving regiments and raising local militia forces to the status of regular units. By the fall of 1947, he had 510,000 soldiers under his command, approximately equal to Nationalist forces in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Lew 71, 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Du's replacement, [[Chen Cheng]], could cross north and begin an offensive, Lin moved his army south and began the Autumn Offensive, in which his forces destroyed rail lines and other infrastructure, attacked isolated Nationalist units, and attempted to provoke and ambush strong Nationalist forces. Chen's forces responded to the campaign by withdrawing into their city garrisons. The Communists were not able to provoke a decisive confrontation, and the Autumn Offensive ended in a stalemate.&lt;ref&gt;Lew 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;

Chen's forces remained static and reactionary, at the end of 1947, Lin led his armies back south in his final Liaoshen Campaign, the Winter Offensive. His initial plan was to repeat the goal of his last offensive, to besiege Jilin City and ambush its relief force, but after reviewing Kuomintang troop dispositions he determined that southern Manchuria would be an easier target. On December 15, Lin's forces attacked [[Fakui]], [[Zhangwu]], and [[Xinlitun]]. Chen sent reinforcements to relieve Fakui, and when the Communist ambush failed, Lin ordered his forces to withdraw and join in the siege of Zhangwu. When Chen did not intervene and the town fell on December 28, Lin assumed the main part of the campaign was over and he dispersed his forces to rest and attack secondary targets.&lt;ref&gt;Lew 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Chen saw Lin's withdrawal as an opportunity to seize the offensive. He ordered his forces to attack targets in northern Liaoning on January 1, 1948, and on January 3, Lin successfully encircled the isolated Nationalist 5th Corps. Its commander, [[Chen Linda]], realized that he was being surrounded and requested reinforcements, but Chen Cheng only responded that he would "allow" Chen Linda to withdraw. The attempted breakout failed, and the 5th Corps was destroyed on January 7. After this defeat, Chen Cheng was replaced with [[Wei Lihuang]] ten days later, but Wei was not able to prevent the Communists from capturing [[Liaoyang]] on February 6, destroying the 54th division, and severing an important railroad that linked Wei's forces from their ports on the [[Bohai Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Lew 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;

Lin continued his advance, defeating all garrisons in western Manchuria or inducing them to defect by late February. On February 26 Lin reorganized his forces as the [[Northeastern Field Army]] and began preparations to return and take Siping, whose garrison had been transferred elsewhere by Chen Cheng and never re-strengthened. Lin began the general assault on the city on March 13, and took the town one day later. The capture of Siping ended Lin's Winter Offensive. The KMT nearly lost all of Manchuria by the end of the campaign and suffered 156,000 casualties, most of which survived as prisoners of war that were indoctrinated and recruited into Lin's forces. By the end of winter 1948 the Kuomintang had lost all of its territory in the Northeast, except for Changchun, [[Shenyang]], and an area connecting the rail line from Beiping to those cities.&lt;ref&gt;Lew 95–97&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Lin's Winter campaign, Mao wanted him to attack targets farther south, but Lin disagreed because he did not want to leave a strong enemy at his back, and he believed the defeat of a strong city would force Chiang to abandon the Northeast. By May 25, 1948, the Northeastern Field Army had completely encircled Changchun, including its airfield, and for the rest of the siege the Nationalist commander, [[Zheng Dongguo]], depended entirely on supplies airdropped into the city. On May 19, Lin submitted a report to Mao in which he expected heavy casualties. By July 20 the siege was at a stalemate, and Lin deferred to Mao, allowing some of his army to attack [[Jinzhou]] farther south, beginning the [[Liaoshen Campaign]]. When Chiang airlifted reinforcements to defend Jinzhou, Lin ordered his army to abandon the siege and return to Changchun, but Mao disagreed and overruled him, and Lin was ordered to engage the defenders in a decisive confrontation. On October 14, the Northeast Field Army began its assault on Jinzhou with 250,000 men and the bulk of Lin's artillery and armor. After nearly 24 hours of fighting, Lin's forces were victorious, suffering 24,000 casualties but capturing the enemy commander, [[Fan Hanjie]], and 90,000 enemy soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Lew 108–112&lt;/ref&gt;

After hearing the news about the defeat at Jinzhou, a KMT army from Yunnan and its commander, [[Zeng Zesheng]], defected and abandoned its position on the outskirts of Changchun on October 14. This doomed the remaining Nationalist forces in the city, and [[Zheng Dongguo]] was forced to surrender two days later. Chiang ordered the 9th army of 110,000 men under General [[Liao Yaoxiang]] to travel west and retake Jinzhou, but Lin directed nearly all of his forces to stop them, and they began to encircle the relief unit on October 21. After a week of fighting, the Nationalist army was destroyed on October 28. Remaining KMT garrisons in the Northeast attempted to break out of the region and flee south, but most were unsuccessful. After Changchun, the only major KMT garrison in the Northeast was Shenyang, where 140,000 KMT soldiers were eventually forced to surrender. By the end of 1948 all of Northeast China was under Communist control.&lt;ref&gt;Lew 112–114&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defeating the Kuomintang===
After taking control of the [[Manchuria]]n provinces, Lin then swept into [[North China]]. Forces under Lin were responsible for winning two of the three major military victories responsible for the defeat of the Kuomintang. Lin suffered from ongoing periods of serious illness throughout the campaign.&lt;ref name="MMW141" /&gt; Following the victory in Manchuria, Lin commanded over a million soldiers, encircling Chiang's main forces in northern China during the [[Pingjin Campaign]], taking [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]] within a period of two months. Tianjin was taken by force, and on January 22, 1949 General [[Fu Zuoyi]] and his army of 400,000 men agreed to surrender Beijing without a battle, and the PLA occupied the city on January 31. The Pingjin Campaign saw Lin remove a total of approximately 520,000 enemy troops from the enemy's battle lines. Many of those who surrendered later joined the PLA.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 116&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking Beijing, the Communists attempted to negotiate for the surrender of the remaining KMT forces. When these negotiations failed, Lin resumed his attacks on the KMT in the southeast. After taking Beijing, Lin's army numbered 1.5 million soldiers. He crossed the [[Yangtze River ]] in the Spring of 1949 and decisively defeated the defending KMT army stationed in central China during the [[Yangtze River Crossing Campaign]]. Lin 's armies continued to defeat KMT armies farther south, finally occupying all KMT positions on mainland China by the end of 1949. The last position occupied by Lin's forces was the tropical island of [[Hainan]].&lt;ref&gt;Tanner (2013) 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Lin Biao was considered one of the Communists' most brilliant generals after the founding of the People's Republic of China, in 1949. Lin was the youngest of the "Ten Marshals" named in 1955, a title that recognized Lin's substantial military contributions.&lt;ref name="MMW141" /&gt;

==Politician==
===Illness===
Lin Biao continued to suffer from poor health after 1949, and chose to avoid high-profile military and political positions. His status led him to be appointed to a number of high-profile positions throughout most of the 1950s, but these were largely honorary and carried few responsibilities. He generally delegated or neglected many of the formal political responsibilities that he was assigned, usually citing his poor health.&lt;ref name="MMW141" /&gt;

After Lin's injury in 1938, he suffered from ongoing physical and mental health problems. His exact medical condition is not well understood, partially because his medical records have never been publicly released. Dr. [[Li Zhisui]], then one of Mao's personal physicians, believed that Lin suffered from [[neurasthenia]] and [[hypochondria]]. He became ill whenever he perspired, and suffered from phobias about water, wind, cold,&lt;ref name="Qiu145" /&gt; light, and noise.&lt;ref name="Lee170" /&gt; He was said to become nervous at the sight of rivers and oceans in traditional Chinese paintings, and suffered from diarrhea, which could be triggered by the sound of running water.&lt;ref name="Qiu145"&gt;Qiu ''The Culture of Power''. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Li's account of Lin's condition is notably different from the official Chinese version.

In another study, Lin is described as having symptoms similar to those seen in patients of schizoid personality disorder. Lin's personality traits including his aloofness, lack of interest in social relationships, secretiveness, and emotional coldness he exhibited during the Cultural Revolution suggest Lin suffered from symptoms similar to those seen in schizoid personality disorder. The challenge of Lin's personality problems in conjunction with the turbulent political climate of the Cultural Revolution impacted his overall ability to govern his position.&lt;ref&gt;Luna, Adrian. "Bringing the Inside Out: Health, Personality, Politics, and the Tragedy of Lin Biao" VDM Verlag, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lin suffered from excessive headaches, and spent much of his free time consulting Chinese medical texts and preparing traditional Chinese medicines for himself. He suffered from insomnia, and often took sleeping pills.&lt;ref name="Hannam and Lawrence 2-3"&gt;Hannam and Lawrence 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; He ate simple meals, did not smoke, and did not drink alcohol.&lt;ref name="Qiu145" /&gt; As his condition progressed, his fear of water led to a general refusal to either bathe or eat fruit. Because of his fear of wind and light, his office was gloomy and lacked any ventilation. Some accounts have suggested that Lin became a drug addict, either to opium&lt;ref name="Lee170" /&gt; or morphine.

As early as 1953, Soviet doctors diagnosed Lin as suffering from [[manic depression]]. Lin's wife, [[Ye Qun]], rejected this diagnosis, but it was later confirmed by Chinese doctors. Lin's fragile health made him vulnerable, passive, and easily manipulated by other political figures, notably Ye Qun herself.&lt;ref name="Qiu145" /&gt;

Lin's complaints got worse with time and age. In the years before his death, the fiancee of Lin's son reported that Lin became extremely distant and socially and politically detached, even to the extent that he never read books or newspapers. His passivity made him difficult to connect with at any meaningful level: "usually he just sat there, blankly". In Lin's rare periods of activity, he used his time mostly to complain about, and seek treatment for his large variety of medical issues.&lt;ref name="HL2" /&gt;

===Alliance with Mao===
Lin, like most of the Politburo, initially held serious reservations about China's entry into the Korean War, citing the devastation that would result if the "imperialists" detonated an atomic bomb in Korea or China. Lin later declined to lead forces in Korea, citing his ill health.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 142–143, 145&lt;/ref&gt;  In early October 1950, Peng Dehuai was named commander of the Chinese forces bound for Korea, and Lin went to the Soviet Union for medical treatment. Lin flew to the Soviet Union with Zhou Enlai and participated in negotiations with [[Joseph Stalin]] concerning Soviet support for China's intervention, indicating that Mao retained his trust in Lin.

Due partially to his periods of ill health and physical rehabilitation in the [[Soviet Union]], Lin was slow to rise to power. In the early 1950s Lin was one of five major leaders given responsibility for civil and military affairs, controlling a jurisdiction in central China. In 1953 he was visited by [[Gao Gang]], and was later suspected of supporting him.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 164, 166&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 Lin was named to the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]].&lt;ref name="MMW141" /&gt; In February 1958 Peng Dehuai, then China's [[Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China|Defense Minister]], gave a speech for the fortieth anniversary of the [[Red Army|Soviet Red Army]] in which he suggested increasing the military cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Mao wanted to distance China from the Soviet Union, and began grooming Lin Biao as a viable successor to Peng.&lt;ref&gt;Domes 82&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 Lin joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]]&lt;ref name="Lee172"&gt;Lee 172&lt;/ref&gt; and became one of China's [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Vice-Chairmen]]. After the 1959 [[Lushan Conference]], at which Peng criticized Mao's disastrous [[Great Leap Forward]], Peng was arrested and removed from all government positions.&lt;ref name="MMW141" /&gt; Privately, Lin agreed with Peng and was strongly opposed to Peng being purged, but Lin's fear of being purged himself kept him from publicly opposing Mao's efforts to purge Peng,&lt;ref name="Hux1"&gt;Hu Xingdou 1&lt;/ref&gt; and Lin publicly condemned Peng as a "careerist, a conspiracist, and a hypocrite".&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 183&lt;/ref&gt; Under Mao's direction, Peng was disgraced and put under indefinite house arrest.&lt;ref name="Hux1" /&gt; Lin became the senior leader most publicly supportive of Mao following the Great Leap Forward,&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 191&lt;/ref&gt; during which Mao's economic policies caused an artificial famine in which tens of millions of people starved to death.&lt;ref&gt;Yang. Section I&lt;/ref&gt;

Lin initially refused to replace Peng, but eventually accepted the position at the insistence of Mao Zedong. As Defense Minister, Lin's command of the PLA was second only to Mao, but he deferred many of his responsibilities to subordinates. The most important figures to whom Lin deferred the day-to-day operations of China's armed forces were [[Luo Ruiqing]], Chief of Staff, and [[He Long]], the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Central Military Vice-Chairman]].&lt;ref name="MMW141" /&gt;
[[File:China 10th Anniversary Parade in Beijing 01.jpg|thumb|right|380px|On October 1, 1959, Lin Biao, as defense minister, surveyed the honor guards at the military parade celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.]]
As Defense Minister, Lin's policies differed from those of his predecessor. Lin attempted to reform China's armed forces based on political criteria: he abolished all signs and privileges of rank, purged members considered sympathetic to the USSR, directed soldiers to work part-time as industrial and agricultural workers, and indoctrinated the armed forces in [[Maoism|Mao Zedong Thought]].&lt;ref&gt;Snow. "Biographical Notes".&lt;/ref&gt; Lin's system of indoctrination made it clear the Party was in command of China's armed forces, and Lin ensured that the army's political commissars enjoyed great power and status in order to see that his directives were followed.&lt;ref name="Lee172" /&gt; Lin implemented these reforms in order to please Mao, but privately was concerned that they would weaken the PLA (which they did).&lt;ref name="Qiu80" /&gt; Mao strongly approved of these reforms,&lt;ref name="MMW141" /&gt; and conscientiously promoted Lin to a series of high positions.&lt;ref name="Qiu15"&gt;Qiu ''The Culture of Power''. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Lin used his position as Minister of Defense to flatter Mao by promoting Mao's cult of personality.&lt;ref name="Tanner522"&gt;Tanner (2009) 522&lt;/ref&gt; Lin devised and ran a number of national Maoist propaganda campaigns based on the PLA, the most successful of which was the "learn from [[Lei Feng]]" campaign, which Lin began in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey 442&lt;/ref&gt; Because he was the person most responsible for directing the "learn from Lei Feng" campaign, Lin may have directed the forging of ''Lei Feng's Diary'', upon which the propaganda campaign was based.&lt;ref name="Tanner522" /&gt;

Because of Lin's fragile health, Ye Qun controlled many aspects of Lin's public life during the 1960s, including who would see Lin and what others would know about him. Mao encouraged Ye to act on Lin's behalf, giving her an unusual amount of power and responsibility. In 1965 Mao asked Ye to publicly criticize Lin's chief of staff, Luo Ruiqing, on Lin's behalf, even though Ye did not yet hold any high political position. When Lin discovered that Ye had done so (after Luo was purged), he was angry at Ye, but powerless to alter Luo's disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu ''The Culture of Power''. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Lin often read speeches prepared by others, and allowed his name to be placed on articles that he did not write, as long as these materials supported Mao. One of the most famous articles published in Lin's name&lt;ref&gt;Teiwes and Sun 5&lt;/ref&gt; was the 20,000-word pamphlet on revolution in developing countries, ''Long Live the Victory of the People's War!'', which was released in 1965. This article made Lin one of China's leading interpreters of Mao's political theories. The article likened the "emerging forces" of the poor in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to the "rural areas of the world", while the affluent countries of the West were likened to the "cities of the world". Eventually the "cities" would be encircled by revolutions in the "rural areas", following theories prevalent in Mao Zedong Thought.&lt;ref name="Lee172" /&gt; Lin made no promise that China would fight other people's wars, and foreign revolutionaries were advised to depend mainly on "self-reliance".

Lin worked closely with Mao, promoting Mao's [[cult of personality]]. Lin directed the compilation of some of Chairman Mao's writings into a handbook, the ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong]]'', which became known as ''the Little Red Book''.&lt;ref&gt;Han&lt;/ref&gt; Lin Biao's military reforms and the success of the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]] impressed Mao. A propaganda campaign called "learn from the People's Liberation Army" followed. In 1966, this campaign widened into the [[Cultural Revolution]].

===Rise to prominence===
Lin's support impressed Mao, who continued to promote Lin to higher political offices. After Mao's second-in-command, President [[Liu Shaoqi]], was denounced as a "capitalist roader" in 1966, Lin Biao emerged as the most likely candidate to replace Liu as Mao's successor. Lin attempted to avoid this promotion, but accepted it on Mao's insistence.&lt;ref name="MMW141" /&gt;

Privately, Lin opposed the purging of Liu and [[Deng Xiaoping]], on the grounds that they were "good comrades", but was not able to publicly oppose Mao's condemnation of them. Lin privately admired Liu, and once told his daughter that Liu had "a better understanding of theory than Mao". [[Zhou Enlai]] was also considered for the position of Vice-Chairman, but Zhou successfully withdrew from the nomination, leaving Lin the only candidate.&lt;ref name="Qiu78" /&gt;

Lin also seriously attempted to withdraw from the nomination, but was not able to do so because Mao had made Lin's appointment a decision of the Central Committee, so rejecting the position would violate Party procedure and would risk ending Lin's political career. Lin was not present at the conference where it was decided to name him vice chairman. After Lin was named, he met with Mao and begged him personally not to name him to the position, but Mao criticized him, comparing Lin to the Ming emperor [[Jiajing Emperor|Shizong]], who devoted so much of his time to the search for longevity medicines that he neglected his government responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Qiu789"&gt;Qiu ''The Culture of Power''. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 all other candidates for the position were removed, and Lin accepted the position as sole [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Vice-Chairman]], replacing Liu Shaoqi as Mao's unofficial successor.&lt;ref name="Qiu15" /&gt; After his appointment, Lin again attempted to submit a formal written request to Mao, asking Mao to rescind Lin's appointment to the position of vice-chairman, but Mao again rejected this request. When Lin received the rejection letter, he was so angry that he tore the letter up and threw it in the garbage.&lt;ref name="Qiu789" /&gt;

Because there was no way to avoid becoming Mao's second-in-command, Lin attempted to protect himself from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution by giving absolute support to Mao and doing very little else. Lin avoided expressing any opinion, or making any decision on any matter, until Mao's own opinions and positions on that matter were clear, after which Lin would adhere as closely to Mao's direction as possible. Lin made sure that, whenever he and Mao were scheduled to appear in the same place, Lin would always arrive earlier than Mao, waiting to greet the Chairman. Lin attempted to make all observers believe that he was Mao's closest follower,&lt;ref name="Qiu798" /&gt; always appearing beside Mao in all of Mao's public appearances with a copy of Mao's ''Little Red Book''.&lt;ref name="QiuDH"&gt;Qiu ''Distorting History''&lt;/ref&gt; When he was informed that the public's image of Lin was that he was "Mao's best student", Lin was pleased, and stated: "I don't have any talent. What I know, I learned from Mao."&lt;ref name="Qiu798"&gt;Qiu ''The Culture of Power''. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities===
Because Lin had no real interest in the position of Vice-Chairman, he did little other than whatever he believed would ingratiate himself to Mao. Privately, Lin had no interest in promoting the Cultural Revolution, and attended government meetings only when Mao demanded that he do so. Those colleagues closest to Lin noted that Lin avoided talking about the Cultural Revolution in any context other than public speeches, and when pressed would only make very brief and ambiguous statements. After 1966, Lin made no phone calls, received few visitors, secluded himself from his colleagues, and gained a reputation as being "reticent and mysterious". He did not take an active role in government, but allowed his secretaries to read short summaries of selected documents for half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the afternoon. This was generally insufficient to fulfill the responsibilities of vice-chairman,&lt;ref name="Qiu80"&gt;Qiu ''The Culture of Power'' 80&lt;/ref&gt; and he left most important work and family duties to his wife, Ye Qun.

Lin's passivity was part of a calculated plan to survive the Cultural Revolution alive and well. When Lin perceived that his longtime subordinate, [[Tao Zhu]], was in danger of being purged in the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Lin sent a letter to warn Tao, advising Tao to be "passive, passive, and passive again". Tao probably did not understand Lin's advice, and was subsequently purged in 1967.&lt;ref name="Qiu80" /&gt; In his relationship with Mao, Lin adopted a policy of "three 'nos': no responsibility; no suggestions; no crime".&lt;ref&gt;Hu Xingdou 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the lead of Mao, in 1966 Lin directed [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] in Beijing to "smash those persons in power who are traveling the capitalist road, the bourgeoisie reactionary authorities, and all royalists of the bourgeoisie, and to forcibly destroy the "[[four olds]]": old culture, old ideas, old customs, and old habits.&lt;ref name="BY226"&gt;Barnouin and Yu 226, 229&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1966 Lin publicly called for a "three-month turmoil" within the PLA, and on October 6 Lin's [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] issued an urgent instruction that all military academies and institutes were to dismiss their classes and allow their students to become fully involved in the Cultural Revolution. Following the orders of this directive, officers and commissars were expelled from their positions, and some were beaten to death.&lt;ref name="CW136"&gt;''China at War'' 136&lt;/ref&gt; Students at Chinese military academies followed Lin's instructions to rebel against their senior officers, breaking into the offices of Lin's [[Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense|National Commission for Defense Science]] to abduct one of the department's directors, and claiming Lin's deputy chief of staff, [[Li Tianyu]], whom students accused of disciplining them.&lt;ref name="BY226" /&gt; The students "overthrew" General Xiao Hua, the head of [[People's Liberation Army General Political Department|the PLA's Political Department]] since the previous July, and went on to purge 40 other top officers working under him in the Political Department, most of whom died in prison.&lt;ref name="CW136" /&gt;

Lin continued to support the Red Guards until May 1967, when Mao accepted Zhou Enlai's appeals to moderate their radical activity through military intervention.&lt;ref name="BY226" /&gt; Lin moderated some of the most radical activity within the PLA; but, from 1967 to 1969, 80,000 officers were purged, 1,169 of whom died from torture, starvation, or execution. Research programs were cancelled and the number of military academies across China shrank by two-thirds. Many defensive fortifications were destroyed, and regular training within the PLA ceased.&lt;ref name="CW136" /&gt;

After 1966, Lin's few personal political initiatives were efforts to moderate the radical nature of the Cultural Revolution. Privately, he expressed unhappiness with the Cultural Revolution, but was unable to avoid playing a high-profile role due to the expectations of Mao, China's unpredictable political environment, and the manipulations of his wife and son, Ye Qun and [[Lin Liguo]].&lt;ref name="MMW141" /&gt; After 1966, Lin, like Liu before him, attempted to build his own base of support so that he could better position himself for the inevitable, unpredictable political situation that would occur following the death of Mao.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 1081&lt;/ref&gt; Lin's few proactive attempts to direct the Cultural Revolution were attempts to protect Red Guards and his political allies from political persecution, and to mediate the attempts of [[Gang of Four|Jiang Qing and her followers]] to radicalize China's political climate.&lt;ref name="Hux1" /&gt; In May 1967, Lin's follower, [[Chen Boda]], saved Zhou Enlai from being persecuted by Red Guards by convincing them that Zhou was Lin's follower and supporter. Zhou repaid Lin's assistance by giving him excessive public praise three months later, in August, but was forced to write a formal apology to Lin after Lin complained to Mao that such praise was inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 236–237, 241–243&lt;/ref&gt;

Lin and Jiang cooperated at the outset of the Cultural Revolution, but their relationship began to deteriorate in 1968 as Jiang frequently attempted to interfere in Chinese military affairs, which Lin found intolerable.&lt;ref name="BY272"&gt;Barnouin and Yu 272&lt;/ref&gt; By 1970 Lin and Ye were very unfriendly with Jiang Qing: Lin referred to her as a "long-nosed pit viper".&lt;ref name="Hux1" /&gt; From 1968 until his death in 1971, Lin and his supporters disagreed with Zhou Enlai and his followers over the issue of China's relationship with the United States and the Soviet Union. Lin believed that both superpowers were equally threatening to China, and that they were colluding to thwart China's interests. Zhou Enlai believed that China should become closer to the United States in order to mitigate the threat posed by the Soviet military. Lin was supported by Jiang Qing in his opposition to pursuing a relationship with the United States, but was not able to permanently disrupt Zhou's efforts to contact the American officials.&lt;ref&gt;Ross 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Lin Biao, as Defense Minister, was responsible for the Chinese response to the [[Zhenbao Island incident]] of March 1969, a battle with the Soviet Union over a small, uninhabited island on the border of Mongolia. Lin issued a report labeling the Soviet Union a "chauvinist" and "social imperialist" power, and issuing orders warning Chinese troops to be wary of an impending Soviet attack. Lin's followers attempted to use the hysteria generated by the incident in an effort to deepen the power that they had gained during the Cultural Revolution, disregarding and acting against the interests of Zhou Enlai and his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Uhalley and Qiu 389&lt;/ref&gt;

===Height of power===
[[File:HK Sheung Wan Upper Lascar Row Cat Street Market Chairman Mao &amp; Lin Biao 1967 B.jpg|thumb|right|Lin Biao pictured with [[Mao Zedong]]]]
Lin officially became China's second-in-charge in April 1969, following the 1st Plenary Session of the [[9th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]]. Lin's position as Mao's "closest comrade-in-arms and successor" was recognized when the Party constitution was formally revised to reflect Lin's future succession.&lt;ref name="UQ388"&gt;Uhalley and Qiu 388&lt;/ref&gt; At the 9th Central Committee, Lin's faction was unquestionably dominant within the Politburo. Of the Politburo's twenty-one full members, Lin counted on the support of six members: the generals [[Huang Yongsheng]], Wu Faxian, [[Li Zuopeng]], Qiu Huizo, Ye Qun; and [[Chen Boda]], an ambitious ideologue. Lin's support surpassed the number of members aligned with Jiang Qing, and far surpassed those aligned with Zhou Enlai. Because over 45% of the Central Committee were members of the army, Lin's supporters dominated the Politburo, and Lin's power was second only to Mao's.&lt;ref&gt;Ross 269–270&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second Plenary Session of the 9th Central Committee, held in [[Lushan District|Lushan]] from August–September 1970, Mao became uncomfortable with Lin's growing power, and began to maneuver against Lin by undermining his supporters and attacking some of Lin's suggestions at the conference. At the Second Plenum, Lin advocated that Chairman Mao take the position of [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], which had not been filled in since the removal of Liu Shaoqi, but Mao dismissed this appeal, suspecting Lin of using it to increase his own power.&lt;ref name="UQ388" /&gt; Mao did not attack Lin directly, but showed his displeasure by attacking Lin's ally, Chen Boda, who was quickly disgraced. Lin kept his position, but the events of the Lushan Conference revealed a growing distrust between Lin and Mao.&lt;ref name="He248"&gt;He 248&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Lin was one of the most influential figures in promoting Mao's personality cult, he began to be criticized within the Party for its excesses later in 1970.&lt;ref name="MMW141" /&gt; After 1970, some factions within the Army, and those led by Zhou Enlai and Jiang Qing, began to distance themselves from Lin.&lt;ref name="UQ388" /&gt; In order to limit Lin's growing power, Mao approved Zhou's efforts to rehabilitate a number of civilian officials who had been purged during the first years of the Cultural Revolution, and supported Zhou's efforts to improve China's relationship with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ross 270–272&lt;/ref&gt;

A serious rift developed between Mao and Lin. Mao was displeased with comments that Lin had made about his wife, [[Jiang Qing]], at the [[9th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China#Chronology|Lushan Conference]]. Generals loyal to Lin refused to accept Mao's criticism of them, and Mao began to question whether Lin continued to follow him unconditionally.&lt;ref name="QiuDH" /&gt;  Mao wanted Lin to make a self-criticism, but Lin stayed away from Beijing and resisted doing so. Ye Qun made a self-criticism, but it was rejected by Mao as not genuine. Zhou Enlai attempted to mediate between Mao and Lin, but by 1971 Lin had become extremely reclusive and difficult to talk with at any level, and Zhou's mediation failed. In July 1971 Mao decided to remove Lin and his supporters. Zhou again attempted to moderate Mao's resolution to act against Lin, but failed.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu ''The Culture of Power''. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official Chinese narrative===
[[File:Lin Liquo crop.jpg|thumb|right|Young Lin Liguo]]
According to the Chinese government, Lin Biao was made aware that Mao no longer trusted him after the 9th Central Committee, and he harbored a strong desire to seize supreme power. In February 1971 Lin and his wife, Ye Qun (who was then a Politburo member), began to plot Mao's assassination. In March 1971, Lin's son, Lin Liguo (who was a senior Air Force officer) held a secret meeting with his closest followers at an Air Force base in Shanghai.  At this meeting, Lin Liguo and his subordinates supposedly drafted a plan to organize a coup, titled [[Project 571 Outline|"Project 571"]] (in Chinese, "5-7-1" is a homophone for "armed uprising"). Later that March, the group met again to formalize the structure of command following the proposed coup.&lt;ref name="He248" /&gt;

Mao was unaware of the coup plot, and, in August 1971, scheduled a conference for September to determine the political fate of Lin Biao. On August 15 Mao left Beijing to discuss the issue with other senior political and military leaders in southern China. On September 5, Lin received reports that Mao was preparing to purge him. On September 8, Lin gave the order to his subordinates to proceed with the coup.&lt;ref name="He248" /&gt;

Lin's subordinates planned to assassinate Mao by sabotaging his train before he returned to Beijing, but Mao unexpectedly changed his route on September 11. Mao's bodyguards foiled several subsequent attempts on Mao's life, and Mao safely returned to Beijing in the evening of September 12. By failing to assassinate Mao, Lin's coup attempt failed.&lt;ref name="He249"&gt;He 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing that Mao was now fully aware of his abortive coup, Lin's party first considered fleeing south to their base of power in [[Guangzhou]], where they would establish an alternate 'Party headquarters' and attack armed forces loyal to Mao in cooperation with the Soviet Union. After hearing that Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] was investigating the incident, they abandoned this plan as impractical, and decided to flee to the Soviet Union instead. In the early morning of September 13, Lin Biao, Ye Qun, Lin Liguo, and several personal aides attempted to flee to the [[Soviet Union]] and boarded a prearranged [[Hawker Siddeley Trident|Trident 1-E]] (a [[Civil Aviation Administration of China|CAAC]] B-256), piloted by Pan Jingyin, the deputy commander of the PLAAF 34th division. The plane did not take aboard enough fuel before taking off, ran out of fuel, and crashed near [[Öndörkhaan]] in Mongolia on September 13, 1971.&lt;ref name="He249" /&gt; Everyone on board, eight men and one woman, was killed.&lt;ref name="HL2"&gt;Hannam and Lawrence 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===International view of official Chinese explanation===
The exact circumstances surrounding Lin's death remain unclear, due to a lack of surviving evidence. Many of the original government records relevant to Lin's death were secretly and intentionally destroyed, with the approval of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], during the brief period of [[Hua Guofeng]]'s interregnum in the late 1970s. Among the records destroyed were telephone records, meeting minutes, personal notes, and desk diaries. The records, if they had survived, would have clarified the activities of Mao, Zhou Enlai, Jiang Qing, and [[Wang Dongxing]] relative to Lin, before and after Lin's death.&lt;ref name="MMW140" /&gt; Because of the destruction of government documentation related to Lin's death, the Chinese government has relied on alleged confessions of purged officials close to Lin to corroborate the official narrative, but non-Chinese scholars generally regard these confessions as unreliable.&lt;ref name="QiuDH" /&gt;

Ever since 1971, scholars outside of China have been skeptical of the government's official explanation of the circumstances surrounding Lin's death. Skeptics assert that the official narrative does not sufficiently explain why Lin, one of Mao's closest supporters and one of the most successful Communist generals, would suddenly attempt a poorly planned, abortive coup. The government narrative also does not sufficiently explain how and why Lin's plane crashed. Skeptics have claimed that Lin's decision to flee to the Soviet Union was illogical, on the grounds that the United States or Taiwan would have been safer destinations.&lt;ref name="QiuDH" /&gt;

Influential Western historians critical of the Chinese government's official story have promoted the view that Lin did not have either the intention or the ability to usurp Mao's place within the government or the Party.&lt;ref name="He249" /&gt; One theory attempted to explain Lin's flight and death by observing that Lin opposed China's rapprochement with the United States, which Zhou Enlai  was organizing with Mao's approval.&lt;ref&gt;Ross 265&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Chinese government never produced evidence to support their report that Lin was on board the plane that crashed in Mongolia, Western scholars originally doubted that Lin had died in the crash. One book, published anonymously using a Chinese pseudonym in 1983, claimed that Mao had actually had Lin and his wife killed in Beijing, and that Lin Liguo had attempted to escape by air. Other scholars suggested that Mao had ordered the Chinese army to shoot down Lin's plane over Mongolia.&lt;ref name="HL1"&gt;Hannam and Lawrence 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government has no interest in re-evaluating its narrative on Lin Biao's death. When contacted for its comment on fresh evidence that surfaced on the Lin Biao incident after the Cold War, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Foreign Ministry]] stated: "China already has a clear, authoritative conclusion about the Lin Biao incident. Other foreign reports of a conjectural nature are groundless." Non-Chinese scholars interpreted China's reluctance to consider evidence that contradicts its "official" history as the result of a desire to avoid exploring any issue that may lead to criticism of Mao Zedong or a re-evaluation  of the Cultural Revolution in general, which may distract China from pursuing economic growth.&lt;ref name="HL4" /&gt;

===Subsequent scholarship and reliable eyewitness accounts===
[[File:Qinhuangdao Shanhaiguan Airport.jpg|thumb|right|Qinhuangdao Shanhaiguan Airport, provenance of the aircraft]]
A six-month investigation by Western scholars in 1994 examined evidence in Russia, Mongolia, mainland China, the United States, and Taiwan, and came to a number of conclusions, some of which were contrary to the official Chinese version of events. The study confirmed that Lin Biao, Ye Qun, and Lin Liguo were all killed in the crash. Lin's plane was travelling ''away'' from the Soviet Union at the time of its crash, making the exact sequence of events before Lin's death more confusing, and casting doubt on the possibility that Lin was attempting to seek asylum in the USSR. Lin's wife and son may have forced Lin to board the plane against his will. Several senior leaders within the Communist Party hierarchy knew that Lin's party would flee, but chose not to attempt to stop their flight. According to this study, Lin had attempted to contact the [[Kuomintang]] in [[Taiwan]] on two separate occasions shortly before his death.&lt;ref name="HL1" /&gt; The findings of Lin's attempt to contact the Kuomintang supported earlier rumors from inside China that Lin was secretly negotiating with Chiang's government in order to restore the Kuomintang government in mainland China in return for a high position in the new government. The claims of Lin's contact with the Kuomintang have never been formally confirmed nor denied by either the governments in Beijing or Taipei.

The eyewitness account of Zhang Ning, who was Lin Liguo's fiancee before his death, and another witness who requested anonymity, indicate a sequence of events different from the official narrative. According to Zhang, Lin Biao had become extremely passive and inactive by 1971. When Lin Liguo informed Ye Qun that Mao was preparing to strip Ye of her Politburo seat, the two became convinced that their family would be purged if they failed to act, and developed a plan to escape.&lt;ref name="Hannam and Lawrence 2-3"/&gt;

At 10 o'clock the night before Lin's party fled, Ye Qun announced that the family would board a plane at 7 the next morning to fly to [[Guangzhou]]. Lin's 27-year-old daughter, [[Lin Liheng]] (known by the nickname "Doudou") opposed the escape plan, and contacted Lin's bodyguards to request that they guard her father from Ye. Doudou then phoned Zhou Enlai,&lt;ref name="HL3"&gt;Hannam and Lawrence 3&lt;/ref&gt; but was not able to contact him directly, and Zhou only received Doudou's report second-hand.&lt;ref name="BY272" /&gt;

Zhou received Doudou's message shortly after Doudou's phone call, directly from the general office of the Central Committee responsible for guarding China's senior leaders. The message contained Doudou's warning that Ye Qun and Lin Liguo were attempting to persuade Lin Biao to flee the country using an aircraft currently being prepared at [[Qinhuangdao Shanhaiguan Airport]]. Zhou called Wu Faxian, the commander of the air force, who verified the plane's existence. Zhou then issued orders that the plane could not take off without the written permission of himself and several other senior military officials, including Wu Faxian, general chief-of-staff [[Huang Yongsheng]], and the commander of the navy and general chief-of-staff, [[Li Zuopeng]]. At 11:30, Ye Qun called Zhou and informed him that Lin Biao was planning to fly to [[Dalian]], and denied that they had prepared a plane at Shanhaiguan. Zhou then told Ye to wait for him to travel to see Lin before they left [[Beidaihe District|Beidaihe]] (where they were staying), issued orders to neutralize potentially disruptive officers close to Lin (Wu Faxian and Huang Yongsheng), and ordered two planes readied in Beijing so that he could fly to Lin's residence to personally deal with the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 272–273&lt;/ref&gt;

Ye made an announcement that the party were to pack quickly. Two hours after Doudou contacted Zhou, soldiers had still not responded in any meaningful way. Ye and Lin Liguo woke Lin Biao and packed him into a waiting limousine. The party then drove to Shanhaiguan airport, 25 miles away from their residence in Beidaihe, where their plane was waiting. Lin's bodyguards told Doudou and another companion that they were ordered to take them as well, but Doudou and her companion refused.&lt;ref name="HL3" /&gt;

One soldier shot at Lin's limousine as it left Beidaihe, but missed, and most soldiers that the party encountered on their way to the airport allowed the limousine to pass. According to the driver of Lin's limousine, there was no time to place mobile stairs next to the plane's entrance, so the party boarded the plane via a rope ladder. Lin Biao was so weak that he had to be lifted and pulled onto the plane.&lt;ref name="HL3" /&gt;

Zhang Ning observed the plane after it left the airport. Lin's plane initially traveled southeast (in the direction of Guangzhou). The plane then returned twenty minutes later and circled the airport several times as if it were trying to land, but the runway lights had been turned off. Soviet officials and Mongolian witnesses reported that the plane then flew north, over Mongolia and almost to the Soviet border, but then turned around and began flying south before it crashed. A Mongolian who witnessed the plane crash reported that the plane's tail was on fire when it crashed.&lt;ref&gt;Hannam and Lawrence 1, 3&lt;/ref&gt; The crash occurred at around 3:00 AM.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

None of Zhou's instructions prevented Lin's flight, and he learned that Lin's plane had taken off before he, himself, could fly to see Lin. Zhou then ordered all planes nationwide grounded without the written permission of Mao, himself, and several senior military leaders. He rushed to [[Zhongnanhai]] to brief Mao of Lin's flight, and asked Mao if he wanted to order Lin's plane shot down, but Mao replied that they should "let him go". At 8:30 PM, September 13, the Mongolian Foreign Ministry summoned the Chinese ambassador to make a formal complaint about the unauthorized entrance of a plane into Mongolian airspace, and reported to the ambassador that the plane had crashed, killing all on board. The Chinese ambassador to Mongolia then phoned Zhou Enlai, who then instructed the ambassador to tell the Mongolians that the plane had entered Mongolian airspace because it had gone off course.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 273–274&lt;/ref&gt;

Mongolian investigators were the first to inspect the wreckage, arriving later the same day. They found an identity card belonging to Lin Liguo, confirming Lin Liguo's presence on the flight. Markings on the plane and surviving miscellaneous personal items confirmed that the plane and passengers had originated from China, but the Mongolians were uncertain that any of the dead were either Lin Biao or Ye Qun. After inspecting the crash, the Mongolians buried the dead onsite.&lt;ref name="HL2" /&gt;

Through the Chinese ambassador, Zhou requested and received permission for Chinese embassy staff to inspect the wreckage of Lin's plane, which they did on September 15–16. The staff reported to Zhou that the plane had caught fire while attempting to land, and then exploded. Zhou then sent additional staff to interview Mongolian witnesses of the crash, and to perform a detailed technical assessment of the crash. The report concluded that the plane had approximately 30 minutes of fuel when it crashed, but attempted to land without activating its landing gear or wing flaps.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1971 a Soviet medical team secretly traveled to the crash site and exhumed the bodies, which were by then modestly decomposed. The team removed the heads of two of the corpses suspected to be Lin Biao and Ye Qun and took them back to Russia for forensic examination. In 1972 the team concluded that the heads belonged to Lin Biao and Ye Qun (the heads are still stored in Russian archives). In order to corroborate their findings the team returned to Mongolia a second time to inspect the body believed to be Lin Biao's. After exhuming the body a second time the team found that the corpse's right lung had the remains of tuberculosis, which Lin had suffered from, confirming the Soviet identification. The Soviet team were not able to determine the cause of the crash, but hypothesized that the pilot was flying low to evade radar and misjudged the plane's altitude. Judging from the fires that burnt after the plane crashed, the Soviets estimated that it had enough fuel to fly to the Soviet cities of [[Irkutsk]] or [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]]. All of the work and its results were kept secret from the public: outside of the investigative team, only [[KGB]] director [[Yuri Andropov]] and Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] were informed. The report remained classified until the early 1990s, after the end of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannam and Lawrence 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
[[File:Huayangpalace layers 2007 09.jpg|right|thumb|Graffiti with Lin Biao's foreword to Mao's ''Little Red Book''. Lin's name (lower right) was later scratched out, presumably after his death.]]

Lin Biao was survived by Doudou and one other daughter.&lt;ref name="MMW141" /&gt; All military officials identified as being close to Lin or his family (most of China's high military command) were purged within weeks of Lin's disappearance.&lt;ref name="He249" /&gt; On September 14, Zhou announced to the Politburo that four of the highest-ranking military officials in China were immediately suspended from duty and ordered to submit self-criticisms admitting their associations with Lin. This announcement was quickly followed by the arrest of ninety-three people suspected of being close to Lin,&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 275&lt;/ref&gt; and within a month of Lin's disappearance over 1,000 senior Chinese military officials were purged.&lt;ref name="QiuDH" /&gt; The official purge of Lin's supporters continued until it was closed by the [[10th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|10th Central Committee]] in August 1973.&lt;ref name="BY280"&gt;Barnouin and Yu 280&lt;/ref&gt; The incident marked the end of Mao's status as always absolutely correct within the Party.&lt;ref name="He249" /&gt; The [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]] celebrations on October 1, 1971, were cancelled.

The news of Lin's death was announced to all Communist Party officials in mid-October 1971, and to the Chinese public in November. The news was publicly received with shock and confusion. Mao Zedong was especially disturbed by the incident: his health deteriorated, and he became depressed. At the end of 1971, he became seriously ill; he suffered a stroke in January 1972, received emergency medical treatment, and his health remained unstable. Mao became nostalgic about some of his revolutionary comrades whose purging Lin had supported, and backed Zhou's efforts to conduct a widespread rehabilitation of veteran revolutionaries, and to correct some of the excesses of the Cultural Revolution (which he blamed on Lin).&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 275–276&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the purge of Lin's supporters, Zhou Enlai replaced Lin as the second most powerful man in China, and Jiang Qing and her followers were never able to displace him. Without the support of Lin, Jiang was unable to prevent Zhou's efforts to improve China's relationship with the United States, or to rehabilitate cadres who had been purged during the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Ross 275–276&lt;/ref&gt; The clause in the Party constitution indicating that Lin was Mao's successor was not officially amended until the 10th Central Committee in August 1973.&lt;ref name="BY280" /&gt;

The position of the Chinese government on Lin and the circumstances of his death changed several times over the decade following 1971. For over a year, the Party first attempted to cover up the details of Lin's death. The government then began to issue partial details of the event, followed by an anti-Lin Biao propaganda campaign. After Mao's death, in 1976, the government confirmed its condemnation of Lin and generally ceased any dialogue concerning Lin's place in history.&lt;ref name="Rob1080"&gt;Robinson 1080&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1970s, high-ranking leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, including [[Hua Guofeng]], spread the story to foreign delegates that Lin had conspired with the KGB to assassinate Mao.&lt;ref&gt;Pacepa&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 Jiang Qing, Mao's fourth wife and a former political ally of Lin's, started the [[Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius]] campaign, aimed at using Lin's scarred image to attack Zhou Enlai. Much of this propaganda campaign involved the creative falsification of history, including (false) details about how Lin had opposed Mao's leadership and tactics throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;Hu Chi-hsi 269&lt;/ref&gt; Lin's name became involved in Jiang's propaganda campaign after flashcards, made by Ye Qun to record Lin's thoughts, were discovered in Lin's residence following his death. Some of these flashcards recorded opinions critical of Mao. According to Lin's writings, Mao "will fabricate 'your' opinion first, then he will change 'your' opinion – which is not actually yours, but his fabrication. I should be careful of this standard trick." Another critical comment of Lin's states that Mao "worships himself and has a blind faith in himself. He worships himself to such an extent that all accomplishments are attributed to him, but all mistakes are made by others".&lt;ref name="Qiu78"&gt;Qiu ''The Culture of Power''. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Lin's private criticisms of Mao were directly contradictory of the public image cultivated by Lin, who publicly stated following the Great Leap Forward that all mistakes of the past were the result of deviating from Mao's instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many major proponents of the Cultural Revolution, Lin's image was manipulated after Mao's death in 1976, and many negative aspects of the Cultural Revolution were blamed on Lin. After October 1976, those in power also blamed Mao's supporters, the so-called [[Gang of Four (China)|Gang of Four]]. In 1980, the Chinese government held a series of "special trials" to identify those most responsible for the Cultural Revolution. In 1981, the government released their verdict: that Lin Biao must be held, along with Jiang Qing, as one of the two major "counter-revolutionary cliques" responsible for the excesses of the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="He249" /&gt; According to the official Party verdict, Lin and Jiang were singled out for blame because they led intra-Party cliques which took advantage of Mao's "mistakes" to advance their own political goals, engaging in "criminal activity" for their own self-benefit.&lt;ref name="Qiu15" /&gt; Among the "crimes" he was charged with was the ouster of China's head of state, President [[Liu Shaoqi]].  Lin was found to be primarily responsible for using "false evidence" to orchestrate a "political frame-up" of Liu.&lt;ref&gt;North 2&lt;/ref&gt; Lin has been officially remembered as one of the greatest villains of modern China since then. Lin was never politically rehabilitated, so the charges against him continue to stand.&lt;ref name="He249" /&gt;

For several decades, Lin's name and image were censored within China, but in recent years a balanced image of Lin has reappeared in popular culture: surviving aides and family members have published memoirs about their experience with Lin; scholars have explored most surviving evidence relevant to his life and death, and have gained exposure within the official Chinese media; movies set before 1949 have made reference to Lin; and Lin's name has re-appeared in Chinese history textbooks, recognizing his contributions to the victory of the Red Army.&lt;ref name="Rob1080" /&gt; Within modern China, Lin is regarded as one of the Red Army's best military strategists. In 2007, a portrait of Lin was added to the [[Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution|Chinese Military Museum]] in Beijing, included in a display of the "Ten Marshals", a group considered to be the founders of China's armed forces.

'''Lucy Larcom''' (March 5, 1824 – April 17, 1893) was an American teacher, poet, and author.

In the 1840s (circa 1846), Larcom taught at a school in [[Illinois]] before returning to [[Massachusetts]]. She went on to become one of the first teachers at Wheaton Female Seminary (now [[Wheaton College (Massachusetts)|Wheaton College]]) in [[Norton, Massachusetts]], and taught there from 1854 to 1862. While there, she helped to found ''Rushlight Literary Magazine'', a submission-based student literary magazine which is still published today. From 1865 to 1873, she was the editor of the Boston-based ''Our Young Folks'', which merged with ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]'' in 1874.{{sfn|Watts|1978|p=191}}{{efn|Lucy Larcom was the editor of ''Our Young Folks'' from the first issue, Vol. 1, No. 1, Jan. 1865, to the last issue, Vol. 9, No. 12, Dec. 1873. [[John Townsend Trowbridge]] was co-editor from 1870 to 1873.}} In 1889, Larcom published one of the best-known accounts of [[New England]] childhood of her time, ''A New England Girlhood'', commonly used as a reference in studying antebellum American childhood. This autobiographical text covers the early years of her life, in [[Beverly Farms]] and [[Lowell, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Dobson|first= James E.|title=Lucy Larcom and the Time of the Temporal Collapse|year=2016|periodical=Legacy |volume=33|issue=1 |pages= 82–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among her earlier and best-known poems are "Hannah Binding Shoes," and "The Rose Enthroned," Larcom's earliest contribution to the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', when the poet Lowell was its editor, a poem, that in the absence of signature, was attributed to Emerson by one reviewer. Also of note was "A Loyal Woman's No" which was a patriotic lyric and attracted considerable attention during the [[American Civil War]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=448}}

Larcom was inclined to write on religious themes, and made two volumes of compilations from the world's great religious thinkers, ''Breathings of the Better Life'' (Boston, 1866) and ''Beckonings'' (Boston. 1886). Her last two books, ''As it is in Heaven'' (Boston, 1891) and ''The Unseen Friend'' (Boston, 1892), embodied much of her own thought on matters concerning the spiritual life.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=448}}

==Early years and education==
Lucy Larcom was born in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]] in 1824 as the ninth of ten children. She was the next to the youngest of a family of eight sisters. The homes built up the streets of her village were full of neighbor children; they all played and grew up together. She read what she could find. This included the ''Pilgrim's Progress'' and the ''Scottish Chiefs''. She read [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' and other English literature. At the age of seven, she secretly wrote, illustrated with crude [[watercolor]]s, and published (only to herself) her first work: a manuscript volume of little stories and poems.{{sfn|Phelps|Stowe|Cooke|1884|p=415-}}

After her father's death when she was eight years old, the home at Beverly was broken up. Mrs. Larcom turned her thoughts toward [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]]. Girls were wanted, and were flocking there for employment in the mills. Homes were wanted, also, in consequence. Good, motherly housekeepers —not common boarding-mistresses— were sought, and accepted only with the best credentials, by the corporation, to occupy its houses and take care of the operatives. Lucy's mother, the mother of many girls, was just one such. The family removed to Lowell, where her mother became a boardinghouse keeper to bring in income for the family. Here, at the age of ten, she helped her mother, in the intervals between her hours of school, in the household work.{{sfn|Phelps|Stowe|Cooke|1884|p=415-}}

==Career==
===Lowell mill girl===
[[File:1850 Boott Corp Lowell Massachusetts detail of map by Sidney and Neff BPL 11051.png|thumb|Boott Mills, ca. 1850]]
At age eleven, in 1835, she began working at [[Boott Mills]],{{sfn|Rosenberg|2013|p=16}} a [[cotton mill]] in Lowell, as a [[doffer]], to earn extra money for her family. She was among the very youngest of those employed at the mills. Her first work as a Lowell operative was in a spinning-room, doffing and replacing the [[bobbin]]s, after which she tended a spinning-frame and then a dressing-frame, while looking out windows towards the river. Later, she was employed in a "cloth-room," considered to be a more agreeable working-place because of its fewer hours of confinement, its cleanliness, and the absence of machinery. The last two years of her Lowell life, which covered in all a period of about ten years, were spent in that room, not in measuring cloth, but as bookkeeper, recording the number of pieces and bales. There, she pursued her studies during leisure moments, some textbooks in mathematics, grammar, English or German literature usually laying open on her desk.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=448}}

Here, as in her earlier childhood, she put words to her visions through verses and by telling herself stories. Of those days, Larcom stated,— "While yet a child, I used to consider it special good fortune that my home was at Lowell. There was a frank friendliness and sincerity in the social atmosphere that wrought upon me unconsciously, and made the place pleasant to live in. People moved about their every-day duties with purpose and zest, and were genuinely interested in one another; while in the towns on the seaboard it sometimes was as if every man's house was his castle in almost a feudal sense, where the family shut themselves in, on the defensive against intruders." Still, she never lost her love and allegiance to the seaside area where she was born, while frequent visits kept up the charm, and gave her links to her home town.{{sfn|Phelps|Stowe|Cooke|1884|p=415-}}
The ten years that Larcom spent at the mills made a huge impact on her. The ''[[Lowell Offering]]'', a magazine whose editors and contributors were "female operatives in the Lowell mills," was published in 1842, and soon after Larcom became one of its corps of writers. One of her first poems was entitled "The River," and many of her verses and essays were found in its volumes. Some of those ''Lowell Offering'' essays appeared afterwards in ''Similitudes'', her first published work.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=448}}

It was at one of the meetings of the literary circle, established among the "mill girls", that Larcom first met the poet, [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], who was then in Lowell editing a [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] journal. He became her friend, showing his real interest in her at once by criticising her share in the written contributions of the evening. She was then very young, but it was the beginning of an interest and gratitude that continued mutually in an established friendship. Afterward, when she had come to know and dearly love the Whittier's sister, Elizabeth ("Lizzie"), the three spent time together. During happy sojourns at [[Salisbury Beach State Reservation|Salisbury Beach]], near the respective homes at [[Amesbury, Massachusetts|Amesbury]] and Beverly, in visits at Amesbury, in counsel and work together, out of which in recent time have grown the beautiful compilations of ''Child-life'', and ''Songs of Three Centuries'', their lives ran near together and contributed the one to the other.{{sfn|Phelps|Stowe|Cooke|1884|p=415-}}

===Illinois===
One after another, Larcom's sisters married out of the home, until only two remained. At about twenty years of age, Larcom accompanied the oldest of the Larcom sisters in Lowell, Emeline,{{sfn|Dublin|1995|p=97}} to the then wild prairies of Illinois. Here, she shared in the efforts of a clergyman's household in pioneer times. A truly pioneer life was theirs as they moved many times from place to place, dependent upon who summoned the clergyman. Somewhere in this prairie Larcom taught school in a vacated log building to a {{convert|2|mile}} neighborhood. Her students came from small colonies within this radius. It was in the corner of a big township which included three counties. She taught under the auspices of a district committee, before whom, previous to induction to office, the candidate was obliged to hold up her right hand and swear to acquaintance, sufficient to instruct from, with writing, spelling, arithmetic, and geography. Her salary was {{USD|40}} for three months; and once, when the time for payment arrived, and her brother-in-law visited the committee-man whose duty it was to make it, his reminder was met with the rather startled remark, as if the subject had never presented itself in so strong a light before:— "Forty dollars! Well, that's a lot o' money to pay a young woman for three months' teachin'! She oughter know consider'ble!" When the official was reassured by a statement of what Larcom's antecedents in study and achievement had been, he replied:— "Well, that's a good deal for her to ha' done!" before handing over the money.{{sfn|Phelps|Stowe|Cooke|1884|p=415-}}

During another sojourning, Larcom found herself in the neighborhood of an excellent young ladies' school. Switching from teacher of scholar, she spent three years at [[Monticello Seminary|Monticello Female Semmary]], following the full course of study. During the last two years, she took charge of the preparatory department of that institution.{{sfn|Phelps|Stowe|Cooke|1884|p=415-}}

===Back to Beverly===
Eventually, Larcom tired of life in the west, so she went back to Beverly, where, for a year or two, she taught a class of young ladies before accepting a position as teacher in Wheaton Female Seminary, at Norton. She remained there for six years, conducting classes in rhetoric, English literature, and composition, while sometimes adding history, mental and moral science, or botany. Larcom's health began after these few years to suffer from such a constant strain of teaching work forcing hhe had to relinquish the regular employment, although, from time to time, she lectures upon literature, or taught classes in various young ladies' schools of Boston.{{sfn|Phelps|Stowe|Cooke|1884|p=415-}} 
[[File:MiseryIslandFromBeverlyFarms.jpg|thumb|View from Beverly Farms]]
Her first poem in the ''Atlantic'' was "The Rose Enthroned" and it is remembered as her greatest inspiration. It was a parable-epic of creation with twenty-one four-line stanzas. Previously to this,— as far back as during her early residence in Illinois,— some poems were published with the name, and some slight sketch of the writer, in Griswold's ''Female Poets of America''; and at about the same time, verses of hers were printed in ''Sartain's Magazine''. During 1852-53, she wrote frequently for the ''National Era'', of which Mr. Whittier was corresponding editor. Later, the ''Independent'' and the ''Boston Congregationalist'', and various other magazines received and published her contributions. "Hannah Binding Shoes" appeared first in the New York ''Crayon''; perhaps no single poem of hers was better known or more admired. When ''Our Young Folks'' magazine was started, Larcom became one of its assistant editors. Subsequently, for a year or two, she was the leading editor. For the next seven years, she lived quietly and independently at Beverly Farms.{{sfn|Phelps|Stowe|Cooke|1884|p=415-}}

In the spirit of ministry, she gathered together the compilation of ''Breathings of a Better Life''. ''Roadside Poems'', and ''Hillside and Seaside'', were compilations from readings of nature. ''Childlife'', ''Childlife in Prose'', and ''Songs of Three Centuries'', were pulled together in company with Whittier, and which he edited. The volume, ''Wild Roses of Cape Ann'' came after these.{{sfn|Phelps|Stowe|Cooke|1884|p=415-}}

Larcom served as a model for the change in women's roles in society. She was a friend of [[Harriet Hanson Robinson]], who worked in the Lowell mills at the same time. Robinson also became a poet and author; later, she was prominent in the women's suffrage movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nobomagazine.com/2012/03/27/harriet-hanson-robinson-profile/ |date=27 March 2012 |title=Celebrating Women’s History Month: A Profile of Suffragist Harriet Hanson Robinson |last=Babitskaya |first=Inna |work=NoBo Magazine |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both contributed to the literary magazine ''Lowell Offering''.{{efn|List of contributors to ''Lowell Offering'', compiled in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lowell offering / written, edited and published by female operatives employed in the mills.  |volume=5|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044019620822;view=1up;seq=11|publisher=HathiTrust|date=1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Lucy Larcom 2.JPG|thumb|Headstone]]
Larcom died at age 69 on April 17, 1893 in Boston and was buried in her hometown of Beverly, Massachusetts. Her influence is still felt in Beverly. A local literary magazine entitled ''The Larcom Review'' is named for her, as is the library at the Beverly High School.
[[File:"WE SAY 'STICK TO YOUR TEXT'" panel in Lucy Larcom Park; Lowell, MA; 2011-08-20.JPG|thumb|Lucy Larcom Park]]
[[Larcom Mountain]], located in the [[Ossipee Mountains]] in [[New Hampshire]], is named after her, as she frequented the area during the late 1800s. At Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts, the Larcom Dormitory is named after her. Rushlight Literary Magazine, which she founded, is still in publication today. Larcom's legacy is honored in Lowell, Massachusetts, where she worked as a "mill girl" at the Boott Mills, and as such, the Lucy Larcom Park was named after her to honor her works of literature that recounted her life at the mills. The park is located between the two Lowell High School buildings, and excerpts from her writings can be found on monuments, statues and other works of art throughout the park.

==Style and themes==
Larcom's later writings, assumed a deeply religious tone, in which the faith of her whole life found complete expression. In retrospection, she wrote ''Idyl of Work''. Notwithstanding the fact that she really meant to set forth the image she had in her mind of her own elder sister, she unconsciously gave herself also, perhaps, through family likeness, in some touches of her portrayal of "Esther" in the ''Idyl''.{{sfn|Phelps|Stowe|Cooke|1884|p=415-}} In her ''Idyl of Work'' and also in ''A New England Girlhood'', Larcom described her early life. In the ''Idyl'', the mill-life of forty or fifty years earlier was portrayed.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=448}}

'''Max Gerson''' (October 18, 1881&amp;nbsp;– March 8, 1959) was a Jewish, German-born American physician who developed the Gerson Therapy, a dietary-based [[alternative cancer treatment]] that he claimed could cure cancer and most chronic, degenerative diseases.

Gerson described his approach in the book ''A Cancer Therapy: Results of 50 Cases'' (1958). The [[National Cancer Institute]] evaluated Gerson's claims and concluded that his data showed no benefit from his treatment.&lt;ref name="nci-hp"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[National Cancer Institute]] | date = February 26, 2010 | accessdate =March 31, 2010 | title = Gerson Therapy: History | url = https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/gerson-pdq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapy is both ineffective and dangerous.&lt;ref name="ACS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mskcc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/69233.cfm | title = Overview of the Gerson Regimen | publisher = [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] | date = March 18, 2009 | accessdate =April 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Europe==
Gerson was born in [[Wągrowiec|Wongrowitz]], [[German Empire]] (Wągrowiec, now in [[Poland]]), on October 18, 1881. In 1909, he graduated from the [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg]]. He began practicing medicine at age 28 in Breslau ([[Wrocław]], now in Poland), later specializing in [[internal medicine]] and nerve diseases in [[Bielefeld]].&lt;ref name=unproven/&gt;
By 1927, he was specializing in the treatment of [[tuberculosis]], developing the Gerson-Sauerbruch-Hermannsdorfer diet, claiming it was a major advance in the treatment of tuberculosis.&lt;ref name=unproven/&gt; Initially, he used his therapy as a supposed treatment for [[migraine]] headaches and tuberculosis. In 1928, he began to use it as a claimed treatment for [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=metabolic&gt;[[American Cancer Society]]. "[http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/DietandNutrition/metabolic-therapy Metabolic Therapy]". Accessed March 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He left Germany in 1933 and emigrated first to [[Vienna]], where he worked in the West End Sanatorium. Gerson spent two years in Vienna, then in 1935 he went to France, associating with a clinic near Paris before moving to London in 1936. Shortly after that, he moved to the United States where he settled in New York City.&lt;ref name=unproven/&gt;

==In the United States==
Gerson emigrated to the United States in 1936, passed his medical board examination, and became a U.S. citizen in 1942.&lt;ref name=unproven/&gt;
The rest of his family died at the hands of the Nazis.{{cn|date=August 2017}} 
In the U.S., Gerson applied his dietary therapy to several cancer patients, claiming good results, but other workers found his methodology and claims unconvincing. Proponents of the Gerson Therapy believe a [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] headed by the medical establishment prevented Gerson from publishing proof that his therapy worked.&lt;ref name=skepdic&gt;{{cite web |author=Carroll RT |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |work=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]] |title=Gerson Therapy |date=January 6, 2014 |accessdate=April 1, 2014 |url=http://www.skepdic.com/gersontherapy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, Gerson published a book in which he claimed to have cured 50 terminal cancer patients: ''A Cancer Therapy: Results of 50 Cases''. In 1953, Gerson's [[malpractice insurance]] was discontinued and, in 1958, his medical license in New York was suspended for two years.&lt;ref name=unproven/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hess|first=David J.|title=The politics of healing: histories of alternative medicine in twentieth-century North America|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-93339-0|pages=222|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4xzTLvaWSmkC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=%22max+gerson%22+1959#v=onepage&amp;q=%22max%20gerson%22%201959&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerson died March 8, 1959 of pneumonia.&lt;ref name=unproven&gt;{{cite journal |title=Unproven methods of cancer management.

Initially, Gerson used his therapy as a treatment for migraine headaches and tuberculosis. In 1928, he began to use it as a supposed treatment for cancer.&lt;ref name=metabolic/&gt;

Gerson Therapy is based on the belief that disease is caused by the accumulation of unspecified [[toxin]]s, and attempts to treat the disease by having patients consume a predominantly [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian diet]] including hourly glasses of [[organic food|organic]] juice and various [[dietary supplement]]s. Animal proteins are excluded from the diet under the unproven premise that tumors develop as a result of [[Pancreas|pancreatic]] [[enzyme]] deficiency.&lt;ref name="Bloch1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abby S. Bloch|title=Nutrition Management of the Cancer Patient: A Practical Guide for Professionals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6AXqYaGSxEC&amp;pg=PA362|accessdate=23 November 2012|year=1990|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-8342-0132-3|pages=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, patients receive [[Coffee enema|enemas of coffee]], [[castor oil]] and sometimes [[hydrogen peroxide]] or [[ozone]].&lt;ref name="IntJCancerReview"&gt;{{cite journal

After Gerson's death, his daughter Charlotte Gerson continued to promote the therapy, founding the "Gerson Institute" in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Gerson Institute, [http://gerson.org/gerpress/about-us/ gerson.org]; "About Us". Accessed 12 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The original protocol also included raw [[calf]]'s [[liver]] taken orally, but this practice was discontinued in the 1980s after ten patients were hospitalized (five of them [[coma]]tose) from January 1979 to March 1981 in [[San Diego, California]], area hospitals due to infection with the rare bacteria ''[[Campylobacter fetus]].'' This infection was seen only in those following Gerson-type therapy with raw liver (no other cases of patients having sepsis with this microbe, a pathogen in cattle, had been reported to [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in the previous two years). Nine of ten hospitalized patients had been treated in [[Tijuana]], [[Mexico]]; the tenth followed Gerson therapy at home. One of these patients who had metastatic melanoma died within a week of his septic episode. Many of the patients had low sodium levels, thought to be associated with the very low sodium Gerson diet.&lt;ref name="mmwr"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Campylobacter sepsis associated with "nutritional therapy"--California |journal=MMWR Morb.

===Evidence===
Gerson's therapy has not been independently tested or subjected to [[randomized controlled trial]]s, and thus is illegal to market in the United States.&lt;ref name="nci-hp"/&gt; The Gerson Institute promotes the therapy by citing patient [[testimonial]]s and other [[anecdotal evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gerson.org/g_therapy/case_studies.asp |title=The Gerson Institute&amp;nbsp;— Alternative Cancer Treatment }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerson published a book discussing the alleged success of the therapy in 50 patients, but a review by the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]] was unable to find any evidence that Gerson's claims were accurate.&lt;ref name="nci-hp"/&gt; The NCI found that no ''[[in vivo]]'' animal studies had been conducted. Similarly, [[case series]] by Gerson Institute staff published in the [[alternative medicine|alternative medical literature]] suffered from methodological flaws, and no independent entity has been able to [[reproducibility|reproduce]] the claims.&lt;ref name="nci-hp"/&gt;

Attempts to independently check the results of the therapy have been negative. A group of 13 patients sickened by elements of the Gerson Therapy were evaluated in hospitals in [[San Diego]] in the early 1980s; all 13 were found to still have active cancer.&lt;ref name="mmwr"/&gt; An investigation by [[Quackwatch]] found that the institute's claims of cure were based not on actual documentation of survival, but on "a combination of the doctor's estimate that the departing patient has a 'reasonable chance of surviving', plus feelings that the Institute staff have about the status of people who call in".&lt;ref name="lowell"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Quackwatch]] | first = James | last = Lowell | title = Background History of the Gerson Clinic | work = Nutrition Forum Newsletter | date = February 1986 | accessdate =April 22, 2009 | url = http://cancertreatmentwatch.org/reports/gerson.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1994 article in the ''Journal of Naturopathic Medicine''&lt;ref name="Austin, Dale, DeKadt. Long term follow-up of cancer patients using Contreras, Hoxsey and Gerson therapies. Journal of Naturopathic Medicine. 1994;5:74-76"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dale|first=Austin S.|title=Long term follow-up of cancer patients using Contreras, Hoxsey and Gerson therapies|journal=Journal of Naturopathic Medicine|year=1994|volume=5|pages=74–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to follow 39 Gerson patients in Tijuana. Patient interviews were used to confirm the existence and stage of cancer; most patients were unaware of the stage of their tumor, and medical records were not available. Most patients were lost to follow-up; of the patients successfully followed, 10 died and six were alive at their last follow-up. Review of this study pointed out its "obvious flaws", including "the majority of patients lost to follow-up, lack of access to detailed medical records, and reliance upon patients for disease stage information"; the authors themselves regarded the results as unclear.

The [[American Cancer Society]] reported that "[t]here is no reliable scientific evidence that Gerson therapy is effective in treating cancer, and the principles behind it are not widely accepted by the medical community. It is not approved for use in the United States."&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3x_Gerson_therapy.asp |title=Gerson Therapy |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |accessdate=April 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420191809/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_Gerson_Therapy.asp |archivedate=April 20, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, the [[National Cancer Institute]] reviewed 10 claimed cures submitted by Gerson; however, all of the patients were receiving standard anticancer treatment simultaneously, making it impossible to determine what effect, if any, was due to Gerson's therapy.&lt;ref name="nci"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/gerson/patient | title = Gerson Therapy Overview | publisher = [[National Cancer Institute]] | date = September 6, 2007 | accessdate =April 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the Gerson Therapy by [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] concluded: "If proponents of such therapies wish them to be evaluated scientifically and considered valid adjuvant treatments, they must provide extensive records (more than simple survival rates) and conduct controlled, prospective studies as evidence".&lt;ref name="mskcc"/&gt; In 1959, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) again reviewed cases of patients treated by Gerson. The NCI found that the available information did not prove the regimen had benefit. [[Cancer Research UK]] states that "Available scientific evidence does not support any claims that Gerson therapy can treat cancer [...] Gerson therapy can be very harmful to your health."&lt;ref name="cancer-uk"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Cancer Research UK]] | title = What Gerson therapy is | url = http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative/therapies/gerson-therapy | accessdate = October 22, 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120930225912/http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative/therapies/gerson-therapy | archivedate = September 30, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerson therapy can lead to several significant health problems. Serious illness and death have occurred as a direct result of some portions of the treatment, including severe electrolyte imbalances. Continued use of [[enema]]s may weaken the colon's normal function, causing or worsening [[constipation]] and [[colitis]]. Other complications have included dehydration, serious infections and severe bleeding.&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt;

The therapy may be especially hazardous to pregnant or breast-feeding women.&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt;

Coffee enemas have contributed to the deaths of at least three people in the United States. Coffee enemas "can cause colitis (inflammation of the bowel), fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and in some cases septicemia".&lt;ref name=enemadeaths&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benhills.com/articles/medical-mayhem/fake-healers/ |title=Fake healers.

Relying on the therapy alone while avoiding or delaying conventional medical care for cancer has serious health consequences.&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt; [[Jessica Ainscough]], better known as "The Wellness Warrior", was a major proponent of the Gerson diet after her diagnosis with cancer.

'''Maytham ibn Yahyā al-Tammār''' or '''Maytham al-Tammar''' ({{lang-ar|'''ميثم ابن يـحيى التمار'''}}) was an early Islamic scholar, a companion and disciple of [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]] and a forefather of [[Sufism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Be5DeNM8d1EC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Maytham+al-Tammar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1J_PUbyWDI_LsgbSkIGYAQ&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Maytham%20al-Tammar&amp;f=false |title=Shiʻite Islam |first=Muhammad Husayn |last=Tabatabaei |authorlink=Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei |year=1977 |publisher=SUNY Press |edition=2nd |isbn=9780791494608 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and Early Life==
Maytham ibn Yahyā was born at Nihrawan, an area near Kufa.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"&gt;Kamāl, Sayyid. ''Maytham Al-Tammar''. Trans. Jasim Alyawy. Qum, Iran: Ansariyan Foundation, n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Yahyā. Hence, ibn Yahyā (which means son of Yahyā).

=== Early life ===
A lady from [[Banu Asad]] bought Maytham (as a slave).&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt; Accordingly, Maytham worked for this lady until the [[caliphate]] of [[Imam Ali]].&lt;ref name="Tahrike"&gt;Mufīd, Muḥammad Ibn Muḥammad. ''The Book of Guidance into the Lives of the Twelve Imams'' = Kitāb Al-irshād. Trans. I. K. A. Howard. Elmhurst, NY: Tahrike Tarsile Qurʼan, 1981. Print. p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Institute for Research and Islamic Studies"&gt;Talikani, Sayyid Mahmud., Murtaza Mutahhari, Ali Shariati, Mehdi Abedi, and Gary Legenhausen. ''Jihad and Shahadat: Struggle and Martyrdom in Islam''. Houston, TX: Institute for Research and Islamic Studies, 1986. Print. {{ISBN|0932625002}} p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maytham's Titles==
The first title/address was Mawali, meaning a slave of Persian origin living in Kufa.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani"&gt;Nakshawani, Ammar. "Biography of Maytham al-Tammar". Lecture. Muharram. Canada, Toronto. Thaqlain, 29 Nov. 2009. Web. 05 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; But after Maytham was freed from the shackles of slavery, he no longer was addressed as a Mawali. The second and most famous title given to Maytham was al-Tammar. Tammar stems from the Arabic word Tammer. In Arabic, Tammer means dates (a type of fruit).&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; Therefore, al-Tammar means "the date seller".&lt;ref name="Institute for Research and Islamic Studies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabataba'i, Hossein Modarressi 2003. p. 42"&gt;Tabataba'i, Hossein Modarressi, and Hossein Modarressi. Tradition and Survival: A Bibliographical Survey of Early Shī'ite Literature. Vol. 1. Oxford: Oneworld, 2003. Print. {{ISBN|1851683313}} p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Tamar (name)|Tamar]] means palm tree, date palm, or dates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behindthename.com/name/tamar "View Name: Tamar". Behind the Name. N.p., n.d. Web. 11 July 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; Maytham received the title al-Tammar because he owned a market store in [[Kufa]] where he would sell dates and other types of fruit.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; In addition, al-Kufi was another title given to Maytham.&lt;ref&gt;Tabataba'i, Muhammad. ''The Return to Being''. Trans. Fazel Amjad and Mahdi Bozorgi. London, England: ICAS, 2009. Print. {{ISBN|1-904063-36-5}} Pg.17&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Kufi simply means a person from [[Kufa]].

==Freedom from slavery==
After the time of Muhammad and the caliphate of [[Uthman ibn Affan|Uthman]], Imam Ali became [[Caliph]] in the year 656 AD. As the new caliph (after [[Uthman ibn Affan]]'s death), Imam Ali moved the Islamic capital from [[Medina]] to [[Kufa]] for two reasons: to keep [[Mu'awiyah]] in check,&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; and because Kufa had an illustrious history (many prophets of [[Allah]] lived in Kufa).&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; Moving to Kufa, Imam Ali use to go around the city of Kufa. It is documented that if he encountered a slave he would try to free him or her.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; One day, Imam Ali saw a lady from the [[Banu Asad]] tribe, who had a male slave of Persian origin (Mawali).&lt;ref name="Tahrike" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Institute for Research and Islamic Studies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabataba'i, Hossein Modarressi 2003. p. 42"/&gt; Imam Ali approached the woman and began to converse with her, in order to purchasing the slave, Salim. The two started to negotiate a price, and the lady's initial asking price was 50 [[dinar]].&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; As Imam Ali gave her the 50 dinar she changed the price to 100 dinar.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; She kept raising the price, since she realized that Imam Ali was willing to pay her a much higher price.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; Seeing the price soar, a companion of Imam Ali then asked, "O Amir al-Momineen (Imam Ali), who is this man? What is he? He's originally a Persian, he is a slave, what the point of paying this much?"&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; Finally, she settled at 500 dinar.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; Imam Ali handed her the 500 dinar. She then called Salim and stated to him that Imam Ali has purchased you. After buying Salim, Imam Ali set him free from the shackles of slavery for the way of [[Allah]].&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tahrike" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Institute for Research and Islamic Studies" /&gt; It demonstrated the Islamic view of slavery; Islam establishes that slavery is immoral and that all humans are equal in the perspective of [[Allah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Vanessa| title=The Qajar Pact | publisher=I.B.Tauris | year=2005| isbn=1-85043-763-7 |pages=150, 151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only thing that differentiates a human is their [[Taqwa]]. Islam called for a gradual emancipation of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Khattab, A. M. ''Islam's Position on Slavery''. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Mirza B. ''Islam and Slavery''. Qadian, India: Dawat-o-Tabligh, 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=articles "How Islam Tackled the Problem of Slavery". Islamweb. N.p., 18 Mar. 2012. Web. 18 July 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themuslimtimes.org/2011/12/law-and-religion/concubines-and-the-holy-quran Shah, Zia H. "Concubines and The Holy Quran". ''The Muslim Times''. N.p., 2010. Web. 19 July 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_1.shtml "Slavery in Islam". BBC News. BBC, 07 Sept. 2009. Web. 18 July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Meaning that masters/owners should not just set slaves free but they should help them build a foundation financially so that they (slaves) could support themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Nakshawani, Ammar. "How &amp; Why Islam Reformed Slavery". N.p., 15 July 2007. Web. 19 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Imam Ali took Maytham under his wings after he freed Maytham. Moreover, a person who frees a slave is showered with blessing and would be protected from hell fire.&lt;ref&gt;Maudoodi, Syed Abul ʻAla. ''Human Rights in Islam''. Leicester: Islamic Foundation, 1976. Print. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maytham's first encounter with Imam Ali ===

After Imam Ali set him free, he greeted Salim by the name Maytham.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; Maytham was the name that his mother gave to him after his birth; no one in Kufa knew that Maytham was Salim's real name.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; Upon hearing a stranger calling him by Maytham, Salim was shocked, baffled, and astonished that a person other than his parents knew about his real name (Maytham).&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; He questioned Imam Ali as to how did he knew that Maytham was his real name.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; Imam Ali replied, "Come with me do not worry. Allah's Apostle ([[Prophet Muhammad]]) has told me that the Iranians call you Maytham.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; Still shocked, Maytham willing went with Imam Ali who would later become his best friend and teacher.

Salim (a.k.a. Maytham) himself narrates this event:

:Imam Ali: "[[As-salamu alaykum|Salamu alaykum]] Maytham."
:Salim: "What did you say?"
:&lt;nowiki&gt;Imam Ali: "Salamu alaykum Maytham."&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Salim: "Nobody knows my name except my parents. How did you know my name?"
:Imam Ali: "Do not worry, there are areas of knowledge that I may know, which you do not know. Come near me. I want you to come with me."
:Salim: "How did you know my name? There is no one in [[Kufa]] that knows me by Maytham. My mother named me Maytham. Only a person of great knowledge knows that thats my original name."
:Imam Ali: "Come with me do not worry. Allah's Apostle (Prophet [[Muhammad]]) has told me that the Iranians call you Maytham."
:Salim: "Allah and His Apostle are truthful."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt;

Other narrations state that Imam Ali tells Salim, "Your name is Maytham, you are Iranian, you are of Iranian origin. Be proud of your Iranian origin."&lt;ref name="Ali Abbas"&gt;Razawi, Ali Abbas. "Maytham Al-Tammar". N.p., 25 Jan. 2013. Web. 05 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Counterfeit Money Incident==
The caliph, Imam Ali, would at times visit the market place of Kufa.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt; In his visits he would stop by Maytham's store to converse with him. One day, Maytham was at his market store in Kufa selling dates. Imam Ali approached Maytham and said to him to take a prayer break.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; Other variants of this event state that Imam Ali told Maytham to take a break and visit his family.&lt;ref name="Ali Abbas" /&gt; Another variant states that Maytham went to go buy something.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt; Before leaving, Maytham requested Imam Ali to sell some dates.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; While Maytham was gone, Imam Ali looked over his shop.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; A shopper came looking to buy some dates. He looked around and them purchased four dates from Imam Ali.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; Some variants say he purchased four [[Dirhams]] worth of dates.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt; But he purchased the dates using counterfeit money (fake money).&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; Eventually, Maytham returned to his stall and asked Imam Ali if he managed to sell any dates.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; Imam Ali tells Maytham he sold some dates and handed Maytham the money. Maytham was shocked that Imam Ali sold the dates and did not realize that the money was fake.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; However, Imam Ali mentions to Maytham to remain patient because the shopper would come back for a reason.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; Maytham became confused, he had a feeling that the shopper would not come back because he essentially got free dates.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt; A couple hours passed by, the man returned to Maytham's market shop upset at the taste of the dates that he recently purchased from the ruling caliph of the time, Imam Ali.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt; The man requested for a return. Imam Ali then tells the man the dates were bitter because the money you gave was bitter (fake).&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt; The man was surprised and astonished. He then took his counterfeit money and left.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;

Maytham himself narrates this event:

:Imam Ali: "Maytham go and have a break. Go and pray your [[Salat|Salah]]. I will look after your date stall." 
:Maytham: "Very well. Try and sell a few dates if you could sell anything."
:Imam Ali: "Do not worry, just go and pray."&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt;
(Other variation of this event says that Maytham wanted to go and buy something. Another variation states that Imam Ali said to Maytham to go and give your family some time.)&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ali Abbas" /&gt;

Maytham comes back:

:Maytham: "O Amir al-Momineen (Imam Ali), did you manage to sell?"
:Imam Ali: "Yes, I managed to sell."
:Maytham: "How much?"
:Imam Ali: "I managed, [[Alhamdulillah]] to sell four dates." (Other variations state that Imam Ali sold four [[Dirhams]] (currency) worth of dates.)&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;
:Maytham: "Where the money?"
:Imam Ali: "Here is the money."
:Maytham: "Imam this person has given you bitter money (fake money). It's not real."
:Imam Ali: "Maytham sit down, do not worry. Allah will provide Rizq (sustenance/livelihood). The owner of the dirhams (money) will come back."
:Maytham: "The man bought the dates by false dirhams! Why will he come back?"&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt;

The man returns:

:The Man: "These dates that you have given me taste bitter." (Some variants say "I don't want these dates! They are bitter! Why are they bitter?")
:Imam Ali: "Because the money you gave was bitter" (Some variants say "Because your dirhams are false!")&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt;

==Maytham's Views of Imam Ali==
Maytham viewed Imam Ali in a very positive light. He saw him as a humble and down to earth [[Caliph]], who sought to teach his fellow citizens manners, religion, and a good lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Knowledge" /&gt; Maytham himself says, "Only Allah knows what lessons I learned from Ali ibn Abi Talib. I didn't find a human on this earth like Amir al-Momineen (Imam Ali). If you want to see the embodiment of humility, then see what I saw with Ali ibn Abi Talib.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Knowledge"&gt;Yusufali, Shaneali. "Maytham al-Tammar". Knowledge 2011: 12-13. Print. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He also says, "Ali ibn Abi Talib is the caliph of the state and I am a Tammar (date seller). Amir al-Momineen would come and sit by me. I would be there, I would sell dates. He would come and sit near me. Which king would sit next to a man selling dates. Whereas Ali ibn Abi Talib would come, sit near me. Look at the humility of the man (referring to Imam Ali)."&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Knowledge" /&gt; Furthermore, people who knew the [[caliph]], Imam Ali, were astonished to find him at times sitting next to a Tammar (date seller) conversing.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;

==Teachings of Imam Ali==
As the cousin of [[Muhammad]], Ali would follow his footsteps and educate people about the teachings of [[Islam]]. He taught/trained many religious scholars both Muslims and non-Muslims.&lt;ref name="Nasr, Seyyed Hossein 1989. p. 145"&gt;Nasr, Seyyed Hossein, Hamid Dabashi, and Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr. Expectation of the Millennium: Shiʻism in History. Albany: State University of New York, 1989. Print. {{ISBN|1438414269}} p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mohammadi, Seyed Ali Farid 2013. p. 7"&gt;Mohammadi, Seyed Ali Farid. ''Shi'i Hagiography: Highlights about the Lives of Five Illustrious and Eminent Shi'i Personalities''. N.p.: University of Michigan, 2013. Print. {{ISBN|1907905065}} p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Among these religious scholars was Maytham al-Tammar.&lt;ref name="Nasr, Seyyed Hossein 1989. p. 145"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mohammadi, Seyed Ali Farid 2013. p. 7"/&gt; Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib took Maytham under his wings, he taught Maytham many secrets about faith, religion, and the world. In addition, he taught Maytham many branches of knowledge, including ''ilm-e-Manaya wal Balaya'' (esoteric knowledge of future events) and ''ilm-e-Taweel'' (interpretation and exegesis of the [[Quran]]).&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Takim, Liyakatali 2007. pp. 93, 122"&gt;Takim, Liyakatali. ''The Heirs of The Prophet: Charisma and Religious Authority in Shi'ite Islam''. Albany: State University of New York, 2007. Print. {{ISBN|0791467384}} pp. 93, 122, 129&lt;/ref&gt; It is documented that Imam Ali would take Maytham to a nearby desert in the middle of the night to teach him about future affairs/matters/events.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt; At times with the permission of his master/teacher, Maytham used to acquaint the public about the deep secrets that he learned from Imam Ali.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt; On account of the frank speech of Maytham, people used to think that Maytham had lost his head/gone insane.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt; They could hardly understand the depth and logic of his words.

Teachings narrated my Maytham:
: "Ali ibn Abi Talib taught us the first lesson in life that whatever job you have as a human being, if your earning wealth in [[Halal]] it's a worship of [[Allah]] (God)."&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Knowledge" /&gt;

=== Ilm-e-Manaya wal Balaya ===
As a student of Imam Ali, Maytham was taught various categories of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Takim, Liyakatali 2007. pp. 93, 122"/&gt; One of these categories was ilm-e-Manaya wal Balaya (the knowledge of death and future calamities).&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Takim, Liyakatali 2007. pp. 93, 122"/&gt; With ilm-e-Manaya wal Balaya, Maytham prophesied specific events that would occur in the future.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Takim, Liyakatali 2007. pp. 93, 122"/&gt; According to Kashshi and Liyakatali Takim, Maytham possessed supernatural knowledge unmatched by ordinary people.&lt;ref name="Takim, Liyakatali 2007. pp. 93, 122"/&gt; Kashshi also mentions that Maytham's ability to predict future events was a feat that was later matched by Muhammad ibn Sinan.&lt;ref name="Takim, Liyakatali 2007. pp. 93, 122"/&gt;

Maytham became one of the top scholars of his time, in part of his desire to increase his understanding about various subjects and the teachings of Imam Ali.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt; People would come to Maytham for explanations of Quranic verses, since he possessed ilm-e-Taweel (interpretation and exegesis of the [[Quran]]).&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt; [[Abdullah bin Abbas|Abdullah ibn Abbas]] is documented to be one of the people that would take lessons from Maytham.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation" /&gt;

==Prophecy of death==
Once Ali ibn Abi Talib, told Maytham that he would be hanged on account of the love for the Imam of his time. He also gave the address and told him that he would be hanged in a farm next to the house of Amr lbn Huraith. The tree on which he would be hanged was the smallest of the ten trees existing in the farm at that time. Maytham was also informed that his tongue would be cut out because he would not stop praising his Imam of time (Ali ibn Abi Talib). After getting this information, it is recorded in history that, Maytham used to go to the tree pointed out by Ali ibn Abi Talib, clean the place and water the tree and offer prayers saying, "O tree! You are for me and I am for you. Months and years passed by, Ali was martyred then [[Hasan ibn Ali]] (the [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Second Shī`a Imām]]) was martyred and Maytham kept waiting for the time.

==Confrontation with ibn Ziyad==
In 60 [[Hijra (Islam)|A.H.]], when [[Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad]] was appointed as the Governor of [[Kufa]], things started to get complicated. Maytham then went to perform [[Hajj]] and thereafter returned to Kufa. One day, Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad, called him and asked him to come to his Court, and said, "O Maytham! Inform me where your Allah is?" Maytham immediately replied. "He is in quest of an opportunity to punish the transgressors." Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad then asked him about his connections with Ali ibn Abi Talib. Maytham replied that Ali ibn Abi Talib was his master and that he loved him. Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad then asked him, "Did your master tell you anything about your end?" Maytham replied, "Yes, he informed me that I would be hanged and that my tongue would be cut." Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad sent a roar of laughter and said, "I will see that your master did not tell you the truth. I will see that his prophecy is belied." Maytham said, "My master's words are true because he got that information from Allah. The Islamic Prophet Muhammad was informed by Jibril, and Jibril came with the message of Allah."

==Final days and death==
Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad ordered Maytham to be jailed and sent him to al-Tamura, a fearful prison underground, [[Mukhtar al-Thaqafi]] was in the same prison with Maytham.&lt;ref name="MaT-7"&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Syyed|first=Kamal|title=Mukhtar al-Thaqafi|publisher=Ansariyan Foundation|location=Qum, Iran|page=7|url=http://www.al-islam.org/gallery/kids/Books/companion12/7.htm|accessdate=22 November 2013|chapter=Maytham al-Tammar}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maytham and Mukhtar would hold conversations in prison but later on the orders of Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad he was ordered to be hanged for creating mischief. Maytham was brought to the same tree to be hanged as pointed out by Ali ibn Abi Talib. Maytham began singing the praises of his master Ali, and about a thousand people gathered to see Maytham being hanged. Even after being hanged, the tongue of Maytham went on singing the praises of Ali ibn Abi Talib. Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad was informed about this and the tyrant ordered that the tongue of Maytham to be cut and thus the prophecy of Ali ibn Abi Talib came true and Maytham died after his tongue was cut out.

The book ''Nafasul Mahmoom'' states that "Maytham was martyred ten days before Imam Husain (a.s.) came to Iraq." Imam Hussein entered Sharraf, on the border of Iraq and Hijaz on the 25th of Dhul Hijjah 60AH.&lt;ref&gt;Qummi, Abbas. ''Nafasul Mahmoom Relating to the Heart Rending Tragedy of Karbala''. Mumbai, India: Islamic Study Circle, 2001. Print. Ch.13 Section 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence at Maytham al-Tammar's Shrine==
In 2006, a suicide bomber detonated his vehicle implosive explosive device near the shrine of Maytham al-Tammar in [[Kufa]], [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="IntelCenter"&gt;Tempest Publishing, and IntelCenter. ''IntelCenter Terrorism Incident Reference (TIR)'': Iraq : 2006. Alexandra, VA: Tempest, 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4367">'''Ni-Vanuatu names''' are the names used by the people of [[Vanuatu]], who are commonly known as [[ni-Vanuatu]]. Under the [[law of Vanuatu]], a child's name registered at birth should include "the family name, the Christian name, if any, and the Melanesian individual name", the latter of which is also known as a "traditional name" or "custom name".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/vu/legis/consol_act1988/csa308/|chapter=Civil Status (Registration) Act [Cap 61]|title=Vanuatu Consolidated Legislation|year=1988|publisher=Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute|accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OHCHR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/a84e86cab5dee25680256739003c1782?Opendocument|title=Country Analysis: Vanuatu|date=1999-02-05|publisher=Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Naming customs differ between the various [[List of islands of Vanuatu|islands which comprise Vanuatu]]. The decision whether to give a child a custom name and/or "foreign name" may be tied to the parents' expectations of the child's future life path: whether he would remain in his village and inherit his ancestors' property and social roles, or whether he would leave to pursue a career elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert J.|last=Gregory|first2=Janet E.|last2=Gregory|chapter=Custom and Western Medicine: The Ethics of Intervention|editor-first=Awadesh N.|editor-last=Sharma|editor2-first=Rajesh K.|editor2-last=Gautam|editor3-first=Ajay K.|editor3-last=Gharami|title=Indigenous Health Care and Ethno-medicine|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|year=2006|isbn=9788176257244|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=69vXiaSP09gC&amp;pg=PA76 76]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dickinson Tevi of the Mama Graon Project has expressed concerns that due to Western influence, the use of traditional names is dying out; he described traditional names as a vital link between children and their cultures and customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.vu/content/mama-graon-director-warns-customs-dying|title=Mama Graon Director warns customs dying|work=Vanuatu Daily Post|date=2011-09-15|accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional names may be given at birth,&lt;ref name="OHCHR"/&gt; or bestowed in adulthood by chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.vu/content/kilman-gets-invite-malekula%E2%80%99s-council-chiefs|title=Kilman gets invite from Malekula’s Council of Chiefs|work=Vanuatu Daily Post|date=2011-01-27|accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiefs may also remove a traditional name so bestowed; in 2012, the chiefs of [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]] and then-[[President of Vanuatu]] [[Iolu Abil]] came to an agreement that Abil would no longer use the traditional name "Kaniapnin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.vu/content/president%E2%80%99s-traditional-name-removed|first=Godwin|last=Ligo|title=President's traditional name removed|work=Vanuatu Daily Post|date=2012-05-10|accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land tribunals may look at custom names as one factor in attempting to determine who has the right of usage of disputed [[custom land]], as custom names are also sometimes tied to [[toponymy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.vu/content/how-ambaean-named-tasso|first=Len|last=Garae|title=How Ambaean is named Tasso|work=Vanuatu Daily Post|date=2012-02-14|accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in central and southern Vanuatu, men's custom names make reference to the place where their clan's founding ancestors first appeared, known in [[Bislama]] as ''stamba''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Trevor H.

'''William Alvin Moody''' (April 10, 1954&amp;nbsp;– March 5, 2013), better known by his [[ring name]]s '''Paul Bearer''' and '''Percival 'Percy' Pringle III''', was an American [[Manager (professional wrestling)|professional wrestling manager]]. He was best known for his time in [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) and the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, later WWE), where he performed as the manager of wrestlers such as [[The Undertaker]], [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], and [[Mick Foley]].

== Early life ==
Moody was born in [[Mobile, Alabama]] on April 10, 1954. He attended [[San Antonio College]] and [[University of South Alabama|The University of South Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://percypringle.com/biography.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120140240/http://percypringle.com/biography.html |archivedate=November 20, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career ===
He entered the wrestling business in his teenage years as a ringside photographer. After [[high school]], he enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]], serving four years on duty; during this time, he often wrestled for Indian Coast [[Independent circuit|independent promotions]] during off-duty hours. In 1979, he began managing as '''Percival "Percy" Pringle, III''' in southeastern independent promotions. There had been previous Percy Pringles in wrestling who were not William Moody. Immediately after his first son's birth, he cut back his involvement in the wrestling business in order to obtain a degree in mortuary science and earn certification as an [[Embalming|embalmer]] and [[mortician]].

In 1984, he resumed full-time involvement in the wrestling business, using his Pringle character in [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]], [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] in [[Texas]], and the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (a successor to WCCW). During this time, he served as manager for numerous wrestlers; he notably managed [[Rick Rude]], [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|"Stunning" Steve Austin]], and [[The Undertaker|Mark Calaway]] in their early careers.&lt;ref name=truth80&gt;Stone Cold Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'' (p.80)&lt;/ref&gt; As Percy Pringle, he was also associated with the careers of [[Lex Luger]], [[Eric Embry]], and [[The Ultimate Warrior]].

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1990–2002) ===
He joined the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in December 1990, after being mentioned by Rick Rude to WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]]. McMahon used Moody's real-life involvement in the [[funeral]] industry to create the character of Paul Bearer, a name given to him by [[Road Warrior Hawk]] and a play on the term [[pallbearer]]. In his portrayal of a very histrionic, ghostly manager, he was almost always seen bearing an [[urn]] (which led to several storylines involving wrestlers stealing his urn), and whose catch phrase was "Ohhh yyes!"

[[File:Paul Bearer in 1996.jpg|thumb|Paul Bearer holding his urn in 1996.]]
Moody made his first appearance in February 1991, as a heel, when [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]], who originally managed [[The Undertaker]], passed him on to be managed by Paul Bearer. Bearer took on a spookier, ghastlier character. Bearer also hosted the WWF [[talk show]] segment entitled ''The Funeral Parlor'', which included memorable segments such as the Ultimate Warrior being locked inside a casket, among others. In 1992, The Undertaker and Bearer turned face, when Undertaker stopped former ally Jake "The Snake" Roberts from ambushing Randy "Macho Man" Savage and Miss Elizabeth with a chair backstage.

Eventually Bearer turned heel again by [[betray]]ing his long-time protege at [[SummerSlam (1996)|SummerSlam 1996]] to align himself with The Undertaker's arch-enemy, [[Mick Foley|Mankind]]. During this time, Bearer also hired [[Terry Gordy|The Executioner]] and [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] to battle The Undertaker.

In April 1997 at [[In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker]], The Undertaker set Bearer's face ablaze using a [[Fireball (wrestling)|fireball]]. As a result, Bearer's head was [[bandage]]d for a time before changing his looks, shedding the makeup of ghostly pallor and jet-black color to his natural strawberry blond hair and less make-up. No longer using his ghostly appearance and mannerisms, he became loudmouthed and shrill. Around mid-1997, Paul Bearer [[coercion|coerced]] Undertaker ([[WWF Champion]] at the time) into being his protégé again with the [[ultimatum]] of revealing a deep, dark secret from the past. During this time, Bearer made references to "the fires of [[hell]]." Feeling he had no choice, The Undertaker accepted after several weeks of resistance. While "managing" Undertaker this time around, Bearer engaged in tyrannical behaviors towards him, harassing him constantly. Eventually, Undertaker lost his patience and refused to allow Bearer to continue being his manager, leading Bearer to reveal the secret.

The secret suggested that Bearer had a traumatic past with The Undertaker which long preceded Brother Love's joining the two in January 1991. The secret, which involved the Undertaker's family, was: The Undertaker's mother had an [[adultery|affair]] with Paul Bearer and as a result, gave birth to a younger half-brother of The Undertaker, named Kane. Throughout The Undertaker's childhood and teen years, he lived in a [[funeral home]] with his parents and half-brother. According to Paul Bearer, The Undertaker accidentally killed his parents by setting the funeral home ablaze and caused his half-brother's face to be [[bruise]]d and [[scar]]red. At the time throughout mid to late 1997, The Undertaker denied all this, claiming it was his younger half-brother's fault. Bearer accused The Undertaker of being an "arsonist", "murderer", and "liar."

Because of the fire incident, The Undertaker thought his younger half-brother and Bearer's illegitimate son had been dead for years. But Bearer introduced [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] in October 1997 at [[Badd Blood: In Your House]], where Kane cost The Undertaker a [[Hell in a Cell]] match against [[Shawn Michaels]].&lt;ref name=1998results&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1998/|title=Raw 1998 results|accessdate=July 10, 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720104717/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1998/|archivedate=July 20, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a bitter rivalry between The Undertaker and Kane and Bearer. Kane was not revealed as Bearer's son until April 27, 1998, on Monday Night Raw, a day after the first [[Inferno Match]], at [[Unforgiven: In Your House|Unforgiven]], where Kane was set on fire. The Undertaker was shown to have also been unaware of this at that time, and helped to build the feud up further, as Undertaker initially refused to believe the story until an in-story DNA test proved it to be true. The feud lasted into summer of 1998, when Kane seemingly abandoned Bearer to side with The Undertaker, beginning a face turn.

Bearer and The Undertaker became a heel team again toward the end of 1998 when Bearer betrayed his own son, Kane, in favor of managing The Undertaker once again. Once becoming a heel with Bearer, The Undertaker shamelessly admitted to setting the funeral home ablaze for which he had initially claimed was an accident or blamed Kane. Shortly thereafter, Bearer (returning to his signature look) and The Undertaker formed the [[Ministry of Darkness]].  Both he and The Undertaker took a hiatus from the WWF unceremoniously in September 1999 as a result of The Undertaker suffering an injury.

In early 2000, Bearer, who turned face once more briefly, returned to WWF TV as Kane's manager, but he retired from on-screen performing shortly after [[WrestleMania 2000]]. Later that year, he went backstage to serve as a WWF [[Road agent (professional wrestling)|road agent]], stage manager, and talent scout. His contract with WWE ended in October 2002.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002–2003) ===
He spent the next year working with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) under the ring name Percy Pringle III.

=== Return to WWE ===
In October 2003, he signed a new three-year contract with WWE. When [[Jim Ross]] contacted him about rejoining the company, Paul at first refused the offer. Ross then called again with an offer. At that time, he was suffering from health problems and depression related to his [[obesity]] and underwent [[gastric bypass surgery]] in November 2003. As a signing bonus, WWE agreed to pay for the surgery, as Ross promised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlenewz.com/wwe-news/paul-bearer-discusses-mcmahon-paying-for-his-gastric-bypass-surgery/|title=Paul Bearer Discusses McMahon Paying For His Gastric Bypass Surgery|date=October 21, 2010|last=Carrier|first=Steve|publisher=wrestlenewz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Managing The Undertaker and backstage work (2004–2005) ====
After recovering, he reappeared as Paul Bearer in March 2004 at [[WrestleMania XX]], alongside Undertaker in a match against Kane. Paul Bearer also appeared on TV as The Undertaker's manager.

In spring of 2004, Paul Bearer was kidnapped by [[The Dudley Boyz]] under the direction of [[Paul Heyman]]. This was set up in order to temporarily write Bearer out of WWE story lines because he had to undergo emergency [[gallbladder]] surgery after suddenly developing [[gallstone]]s, a common side effect of gastric bypass surgery.

For the June 27, 2004 pay-per-view [[The Great American Bash (2004)|The Great American Bash]], a match pitting The Undertaker against both of The Dudley Boyz was [[List of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]]. Paul Bearer was encased in a glass "crypt" backstage, covered up to his chest in cement. Heyman demanded The Undertaker throw the match or Bearer would be suffocated in cement.

The Undertaker won the match but proceeded afterwards to pull the lever that sent cement into the crypt, completely burying Paul Bearer, suffocating him. (Bearer was not really at the event. The WWE had recorded footage of Paul Bearer in the crypt before the event. During the event, there was a stunt double in the crypt the whole time. That's why the television audience could only see Paul Bearer and the crypt he was in – since he wasn't there, they couldn't actually show anyone on screen with Bearer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Boyle|title=Smash Wrestling!|url=http://www.firetank.com/smashwrestling/wguruanswer.shtml?autoid=32915&amp;s_question=paul+bearer&amp;|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711004014/http://www.firetank.com/smashwrestling/wguruanswer.shtml?autoid=32915&amp;s_question=paul+bearer&amp;|archivedate=July 11, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shot ended the pay-per-view and caused numerous complaints toward WWE, as in essence they had shown a simulated murder. The live audience, however, saw an extended ending in which Bearer surfaced for air and was carried from the arena on a stretcher. On the following week's ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', Bearer was acknowledged to be alive, although gravely injured, for storyline purposes. The rehearsal taping earlier in the day of the Bash – with Undertaker ad-libbing and only half of the stunt complete, in an empty arena – was leaked onto the internet dirt sheets and actually broadcast live by accident in many of the television markets. As he had two years remaining on his contract, however, Bearer was used as a booker for the company up until WWE decided to terminate his contract on April 11, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling101.com/101/newsitem/1587/|title=Paul Bearer Released From His WWE Contract|date=April 10, 2005|last=Perry|first=Bianca|publisher=wrestling101.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other WWE work and independent circuit (2005–2013) ====
On June 10, 2005, Bearer announced that he had signed a new deal with WWE, allowing it to market his personality and requiring he attend autograph sessions, make promotional appearances and occasionally work TV and house shows. In late January 2007, at a [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]/[[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] house show in [[Mobile, Alabama]], Bearer joined [[The Brothers of Destruction]] at ringside, carrying the original urn.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, Percy.

On April 11, 2007, Bearer appeared in the "Where Are They Now?" page, on the WWE website. He was said to have lost 240 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brett Hoffman|title=Catching up with Paul Bearer|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wherearetheynow/paulbearer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bearer was a manager in the [[THQ]] video game ''[[WWE Legends of WrestleMania]]'' in 2009. In 2010, Moody did voice over work as Paul Bearer for the game, ''[[WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011]]'', where he was featured in one of the ''Road To WrestleMania'' storylines for the game, as well as a selectable manager. He was also in ''[[WWE All Stars]]'', ''[[WWE '13]]'', and ''[[WWE 2K14]]'' as a selectable manager and part of the Attitude Era single-player mode, and 30 Years of WrestleMania mode respectively representing The Brothers of Destruction.

Bearer returned to the Boston-based [[Millennium Wrestling Federation]] as top heel manager along with [[John "Bradshaw" Layfield]] after four years, leading "Stalker" Dylan Kage at Soul Survivor VI against [[The Iron Sheik]] and [[Jay Lethal|"Black Machismo" Jay Lethal]] in the Sheik's retirement match April 24, 2010.

On October 12, 2012, Bearer managed Vader against Rikishi at Pro Wrestling Syndicate in Rahway, NJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-news.net/vader-rikishi-announced-upcoming/14305/|title=Vader vs. Rikishi Announced For Upcoming Pro Wrestling Syndicate iPPV|date=August 14, 2012|last=Daly|first=Wayne|publisher=wrestling-news.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sporadic WWE appearances (2010–2012) ====
On the September 24, 2010, episode of ''SmackDown'', Bearer made his first on-screen appearance in 6 years after being brought out in a [[casket]]. He helped [[The Undertaker]], who was feuding with [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] over the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]], by restoring Undertaker's powers with the urn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2010/09/25/15475181.html|title=Smackdown: Kickin' it old school|date=September 25, 2010|last=Hillhouse|first=Dave|accessdate=October 4, 2010|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bearer officially became Undertaker's manager again by accompanying him to the ring for his match against Kane for the title at the [[Hell in a Cell (2010)|Hell in a Cell]] pay-per-view. During the match, Bearer once again turned on Undertaker, after shining a light in his eyes when he was about to Tombstone Kane. He then let Kane hit Undertaker with the urn to help him win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2010/10/04/15570631.html|title=Hell in a Cell: Betrayal, fan interference, and flying shoes|date=October 4, 2010|first=Dave|last=Hillhouse|accessdate=October 4, 2010|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the October 15 episode of ''SmackDown'', Bearer challenged Undertaker to face Kane in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Buried Alive match|Buried Alive Match]] for the World Heavyweight Championship at [[WWE Bragging Rights (2010)|Bragging Rights]], to which Undertaker accepted by attacking Kane. At Bragging Rights, Kane once again defeated Undertaker after interference by Bearer, who was almost thrown in the grave by Undertaker, and [[The Nexus (professional wrestling)|The Nexus]], who helped Bearer and Kane bury Undertaker.

Kane then entered a feud with [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], after he was named the new challenger to Kane's World Heavyweight Championship at [[Survivor Series (2010)|Survivor Series]]. On the November 12 episode of ''SmackDown'', Kane cost Edge his match against Nexus member [[David Otunga]]. After the match, Edge kidnapped Bearer by strapping him in a wheelchair. Later that night, Edge used Bearer to cost Kane his match against [[Big Show]]. The following week, Edge tormented Bearer throughout the night by throwing a [[dodgeball]] at him and force feeding and throwing [[pizza]] all over him. Edge then used Bearer to call for Kane in the parking lot, but Kane wasn't able to get Bearer in time as Edge attacked him and drove off with Bearer. At Survivor Series, Edge brought an empty wheelchair causing Kane to go mad frantically trying to interrogate him on where Bearer was held. Even though the match ended in a draw, Kane was unable to find Bearer as Edge wheeled his enemy into a barricade. On the November 26 episode of ''SmackDown'', Kane demanded that Edge to let Bearer go, but Edge refused. Kane attempted to track down Bearer, but was unable to find him. Kane offered a second title shot to Edge, which he accepted, but continued to keep Bearer with him. At the end of the night, Edge lured Kane to the parking lot, where Edge drove over a dummy version of Paul Bearer, with the actual Paul Bearer in the backseat of the car. On the December 3 episode of ''SmackDown'', Edge continued his mind games with Kane by pushing a dummy version of Paul Bearer down some stairs. Then, after Edge defeated Kane in a non-title match, he brought out a Paul Bearer lookalike. Kane then went to search for Bearer again, but Edge drove away in a truck with Bearer tied up on the back. The following week, Kane begged Edge to return Bearer, but Edge once again refused. Kane then refused to participate in the main event that night and once again searched for Bearer. After seeing what he thought was a dummy version of Paul Bearer on top of two ladders, Kane pushed them over. Afterward, Kane saw that he pushed the actual Paul Bearer off the ladders onto the concrete floor, thus, [[kayfabe|injuring]] him and writing him out of the storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrestling.insidepulse.com/2010/12/08/wwe-smackdown-spoilers-for-1210-with-edge-kane-rey-mysterio/|title=WWE Smackdown Spoilers for 12/10 with Edge, Kane, Rey Mysterio|date=December 8, 2010|last=Glazer|first=Pulse|publisher=wrestling.insidepulse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, Bearer returned for a brief stint as a part of Kane's ongoing feud with [[Randy Orton]]. He was kidnapped by Orton and then stuck in a storage freezer while strapped to a wheelchair. Kane later came for Bearer, only to roll him back into the freezer and saying, "I'm saving you... from me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0423/552004/edge/|title=Edge Returns, Paul Bearer Appears On Raw, Announced Attendance|date=April 23, 2012|last=Steven|first=Andy|publisher=wrestlinginc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|certain=y|date=May 2017}}

Bearer was planned to reunite with The Undertaker and Kane on [[WWE Raw 1000]] but could not make the event due to scheduling and travel conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0725/554670/the-miz/|title=JBL Discusses WWE Future, Paul Bearer Not Able To Make RAW 1000, The Miz - WrestlingInc.com|author=|date=|website=wrestlinginc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|certain=y|date=May 2017}} Bearer's last appearance for WWE was in April 2012 before his death.

Moody married Dianna McDole in December 1978 and had two sons, Michael and Daniel. Daniel wrestles on the independent circuit as DJ Pringle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://percypringle.com/biography.html Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120140240/http://percypringle.com/biography.html |date=November 20, 2009 }}.

Moody's health improved after his [[gastric bypass surgery]]. One year earlier, he admitted that he had weighed 525 pounds (238&amp;nbsp;kg) before the operation but dropped to under 300 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://percysposts.blogspot.com/2005_11_01_percysposts_archive.html|title=Percy's Posts|author=|date=|website=percysposts.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September and October 2005, he conducted three [[Shoot (professional wrestling)#Shoot interview|shoot interviews]] for [[Ring of Honor]]. Two were done exclusively about him, talking about his career in wrestling. The third was with friend and fellow wrestling manager [[Jim Cornette]]. He returned full-time to his funeral business in 2006. In 2005, Moody, with three partners, started his own independent promotion known as Gulf South Wrestling. In May 2007 he dissolved the company after his partners wanted to continue the promotion without him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://percysposts.blogspot.com/2007/05/gulf-south-wrestling-closed.html|title=Percy's Posts: Gulf South Wrestling Closed|date=May 15, 2007|publisher=percysposts.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, 2014, his son Michael died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/88422/michael-moody-passes-away.html?p=1|title=MICHAEL MOODY PASSES AWAY - PWInsider.com|author=|date=|website=www.pwinsider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
On March 2, 2013, he attended the annual Gulf Coast Wrestlers Reunion in Mobile, AL. According to club board member "Cowboy" Bob Kelly, Moody  was having breathing difficulties at the event. He was coughing, and told friends he was going to seek treatment for respiratory problems. Kelly said that Moody was treated for a [[Embolism|blood clot]] after the reunion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Bearer Suffered Blood Clot before Death.|url=http://www.tmz.com/2013/03/06/paul-bearer-dead-blood-clot/?adid=hero2|publisher=[[TMZ]]|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 5, 2013, Moody died in [[Mobile, Alabama]] at the age of 58 due to a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. The cause of the heart attack was [[supraventricular tachycardia]], which causes a dangerously high heart rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Bearer Heart Attack Killed Him|url=http://www.tmz.com/2013/03/23/paul-bearer-heart-attack/|publisher=[[TMZ]]|date=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hall of Fame and legacy ===
[[File:Paul Bearer Hall of Fame.jpg|thumb|Bearer was posthumously inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] by his two real-life sons (bottom right).]]
Following his death, Moody became a driving point in WWE storylines. The March 11 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' was held as a tribute to Bearer, [[The Undertaker]] paid tribute but was interrupted by [[CM Punk]], his [[WrestleMania 29]] opponent. Punk then mocked Bearer over the next few weeks against both The Undertaker and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], including stealing his urn and attacking Kane with it. On the April 1 episode of ''Raw'', [[Paul Heyman]] dressed up as Paul Bearer and Punk poured the ashes of the urn onto The Undertaker after attacking him. At WrestleMania 29, The Undertaker defeated Punk and took back the urn, dedicating his victory to Paul Bearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0407/561856/wrestlemania-29-cm-punk-vs-the-undertaker/index-2.shtml|title=WrestleMania 29: CM Punk Vs.

'''Peter John Farrelly''' (born December 17, 1956) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer and novelist. Along with his brother Bobby, the [[Farrelly brothers]] are mostly famous for directing and producing quirky, slightly offensive comedy and [[romantic comedy]] films such as ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'', ''[[Shallow Hal]]'', ''[[Me, Myself &amp; Irene|Me, Myself and Irene]]'', ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' and [[The Heartbreak Kid (2007 film)|the 2007 remake of ''The Heartbreak Kid'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Interview-Farrelly-Brothers-6462.html|title=Interview: The Farrelly Brothers|date=2007-09-27|work=CINEMABLEND|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his own, Peter Farrelly directed ''[[Green Book (film)|Green Book]]'', which won the Audience Award at the [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto Film Festival]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2018/09/16/peter-farrelly-new-movie-wins-people-choice-award-toronto-film-festival/kgsKOu7lKds4fQesIO0ntL/story.html|title=Peter Farrelly’s new movie wins People’s Choice Award at Toronto film festival - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Farrelly was born in [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania]], to Mariann (Neary), a nurse practitioner, and Robert Leo Farrelly, a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/61/Bobby-Farrelly.html |title=Bobby Farrelly Biography (1958?-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=r7vbZx4bPqAC&amp;q=%22Peter+Farrelly%22+%22Neary%22&amp;dq=%22Peter+Farrelly%22+%22Neary%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTkMu_4-_eAhWqtVkKHVq_BWMQ6AEIFDAA]&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in [[Cumberland, Rhode Island]] and graduated from [[Providence College]].

==Career==
Farrelly decided to pursue writing full-time, which prompted him to quit his job and relocate to [[Cape Cod|Cape Cod, Massachusetts]] where he got a job as a waiter. On one of the tables he was waiting, Farrelly struck up a conversation with a writing professor from [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass Amherst]], who encouraged Farrelly to apply to graduate school. Farrelly said he did not think his chances were good, considering he did poorly in college but the professor said not everything is judged by grades. With what would later be ''[[Outside Providence]]'', Farrelly submitted the work and was pleasantly surprised that he was accepted. He studied writing for a time at UMass Amherst, but was ultimately dissatisfied with the program, and transferred to [[Columbia University]] in New York City, which Farrelly said he found very satisfying. He later became interested in screenwriting, which led him to directing. He made this career decision after many of his screenplays sold, but were not produced.

Together with his brother, [[Bobby Farrelly]], he has written, directed, and produced several comedy films including ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'', ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]'', ''[[Shallow Hal]]'', ''[[Me, Myself &amp; Irene]]'', ''[[Stuck on You (film)|Stuck on You]]'', and ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]]''. They also conceived the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Virgin (Seinfeld)|The Virgin]]" (4.10).

In 2006, Farrelly directed the [[Man Laws]] series of television commercials for the [[Miller Lite]] beer brand, which featured actor [[Burt Reynolds]], American football player [[Jerome Bettis]], climber [[Aron Ralston]], and professional wrestler [[Triple H]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2006/04/10/tidbits1.html "Burt Reynolds may star in Miller Lite ad"]. ''The Business Journal.'' Accessed on July 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter worked on a film entitled, ''[[Movie 43]]'', which was released in 2013 and produced by the siblings' long-time producer [[Charles B. Wessler]]. He produced the [[anthology film]] and directed two of its segments.&lt;ref name=m43&gt;[http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/98887-exclusive-interview-peter-farrelly-on-movie-43 Exclusive Interview: Peter Farrelly on Movie 43]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Peter and his brother announced that the filming of ''[[Dumb and Dumber To]]'' would begin in 2013.&lt;ref name="PATRIOTLEDGER04032012"&gt;Barubto, Dana, [http://www.patriotledger.com/blogs/only-entertainment/x826296131/Peter-Farrelly-announces-Dumb-and-Dumber-sequel "Peter Farrelly announces ‘Dumb and Dumber’ sequel"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928020241/http://www.patriotledger.com/blogs/only-entertainment/x826296131/Peter-Farrelly-announces-Dumb-and-Dumber-sequel |date=September 28, 2013 }}, ''[[The Patriot Ledger]]'', Quincy, Massachusetts, April 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released on November 14, 2014 to negative reviews.

In 2016, [[Audience (TV network)|Audience]] announced that ''[[Loudermilk (TV series)|Loudermilk]]'', a new half-hour scripted comedy co-created by Farrelly and Bobby Mort, would receive a straight-to-series order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2016/07/loudermilk-series-peter-farrelly-bobby-mort-audience-network-comedy-1201789165/|title=Peter Farrelly-Bobby Mort Comedy ‘Loudermilk’ Gets Straight-To-Series Order At Audience Network|last=Hipes|first=Patrick|date=2016-07-20|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the show was renewed for season 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/peter-farrelly-comedy-loudermilk-gets-season-2-at-at-t-audience-network-1102070|title='Loudermilk' Renewed for Season 2 at Audience Network|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Farrelly directed ''[[Green Book (film)|Green Book]]'', which won the [[Toronto International Film Festival People's Choice Award|Toronto International Film Festival's People Choice Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://deadline.com/2018/09/green-book-wins-2018-toronto-film-festival-peoples-choice-award-oscar-harbinger-1202465434/ ‘Green Book’ Wins 2018 Toronto Film Festival People’s Choice Award – Oscar Harbinger?]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a published novelist, with works including ''Outside Providence'' and ''[[The Comedy Writer]]''.

Farrelly is a board member of [[Direct Sports Network]] (formerly DeskSite).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://desksite.com/ |title=DeskSite...

'''Pieter Both''' (1568 – 6 March 1615) was the first [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]].

Not much is known of his early years. In 1599, Both was already an admiral in the [[New Company|New, or Brabant Company]]. In that year, he traveled to the [[East Indies]] with four ships. When the newly founded [[Dutch East India Company]] set up a government for the [[Dutch East Indies]], Pieter Both was invited to become the Governor-General. He held that position from 19 December 1610 to 6 November 1614. During that period he concluded contracts with the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccans]], conquered [[Timor]], and drove the [[Spain|Spaniards]] out of [[Tidore]].

After he relinquished his position as Governor-General to [[Gerard Reynst]], he left for the [[Netherlands]] with four ships. Two of the ships were shipwrecked in [[Mauritius]] at Flic-en-Flac, and Pieter Both drowned.

The second highest mountain of [[Mauritius]] is named [[Pieter Both (mountain)|Pieter Both]] after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3604">'''Rabi'ah ibn al-Harith''' ({{lang-ar|ربيعة بن الحارث}})&lt;ref&gt;Other transliterations include "Rabah ibn al-Harith"&lt;/ref&gt; (c.566-c.640) was a first cousin and [[sahaba|companion]] of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]].

==Family==
He was a son of [[Al-Harith ibn Abd al-Muttalib]] of the [[Banu Hashim|Hashim]] clan of the [[Quraysh]] in [[Mecca]].&lt;ref name=Tabari39&gt;Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. ''Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk''. Translated by Landau-Tasseron, E. (1998). ''Volume 39: Biographies of the Prophet's Companions and Their Successors''. Albany: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62,98}}

He married his cousin Umm al-Hakam bint al-Zubayr and they had nine children.&lt;ref name=Saad8&gt;Muhammad ibn Saad. ''Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir''. Translated by Bewley, A. (1995). ''The Women of Madina''. London: Ta-Ha Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}&lt;ref name=Tabari39/&gt;{{rp|198}}
#Muhammad.
#Abdullah.
#Abbas. He had a son named Rahman buried in Jhang
#al-Harith.
#Abdshams.
#Abdulmuttalib, who narrated hadith from Muhammad and settled in Syria.&lt;ref name=Tabari39/&gt;{{rp|63,97}}
#Umayya.
#Another son, variously named Adam, Tammam or Iyas, the victim of the bloodwit case.&lt;ref name=Tabari39/&gt;{{rp|62-63}}
#Arwa "the Elder", from whom Rabi'ah took his ''kunya'' '''Abu Arwa'''.&lt;ref name=Tabari39/&gt;{{rp|288}}

==Conversion to Islam==
It is said that Rabi'ah did not fight at the [[Battle of Badr]] in 624 because he was in Syria at the time.&lt;ref name=Tabari39/&gt;{{rp|62}}

In 627, at the time of the [[Battle of the Ditch]], he converted to [[Islam]] and emigrated to [[Medina]].&lt;ref name=Tabari39/&gt;{{rp|62}}

==Bloodwit case==
Rabi'ah's son Adam was a small child living with a foster-mother from the [[Banu Bakr|Bakr]] tribe. The Bakr were at war with the [[Banu Hudhayl|Hudhayl]]. Adam crept out in front of the tents and was caught in the cross-fire of the battle. A rock thrown by a Hudhayl man hit and crushed his head, which killed him.&lt;ref name=Tabari39/&gt;{{rp|61,98}}

Rabi'ah intended to demand blood-money or a counter-killing from the Hudhayl for the death of his son. Before this could happen, Muhammad [[Conquest of Mecca|conquered]] Mecca. On that day Muhammad cancelled all bloodwit debts and he specifically named Rabi'ah's case as the first to be cancelled.&lt;ref name=Tabari39/&gt;{{rp|61,98}} However, Ibn Ishaq asserts that the cancellation was declared two years later, at the [[Farewell Pilgrimage]] of 632.&lt;ref name=Ishaq/&gt;{{rp|650-651}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;All blood shed in the pagan period is to be left unavenged. The first claim on blood I abolish is that of Ibn Rabia ibn Al-Harith ibn Abdalmuttalib. It is the first blood shed in the pagan period which I deal with.&lt;ref name=Ishaq/&gt;{{rp|651}}&lt;ref name=Tabari39/&gt;{{rp|61,98}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hence Muhammad prevented Rabi'ah from claiming revenge from the killer.&lt;ref name=Tabari39/&gt;{{rp|61,98}}

==Later life==
Rabī'ah and his brother [[Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith|Abū Sufyān]] were among the ten people who did not flee in the [[Battle of Hunayn]].&lt;ref name=Ishaq&gt;Muhammad ibn Ishaq. ''Sirat Rasul Allah''. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). ''The Life of Muhammad''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|569}}&lt;ref name=Tabari39/&gt;{{rp|62}}

He is involved in the [[Hadith of the ten promised paradise]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Rabi'ah died after 636 but before 644.&lt;ref name=Tabari39/&gt;{{rp|19,21,62,98}}

'''Reginald''' "'''Reggie'''" '''Mantle''' is a fictional teenager in stories published by [[Archie Comics]]. Created by writer-artist [[Bob Montana]] and John L. Goldwater in ''Jackpot Comics'' #5 ([[cover-date]]d Spring 1942) as well as CW's ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]''. He is a [[frenemy]] of [[Archie Andrews]].

==Publication history==
Reggie Mantle debuted in ''Jackpot Comics'' #5 ([[cover-date]]d Spring 1942).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/2086/ ''Jackpot Comics'' #5]  at the [[Grand Comics Database]].&lt;/ref&gt; An enduring character, he appears across the [[Archie Comics]] line and headlined the series ''Archie's Rival Reggie'' (14 issues,  1949 n.d. – Aug. 1954),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/12649/ ''Archie's Rival Reggie''] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; which returned a decade later as ''Reggie'' for the sporadically published issues #15-18 (Sept. 1963 – Nov. 1965).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/12650/ ''Reggie''] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; The series was renamed ''Reggie and Me'' for issues #19 – #126 (Aug. 1966 – Sept. 1980).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/12651/ ''Reggie and Me''] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt;

Other series include ''Reggie's Wise Guy Jokes'' (55 issues, Aug. 1968 – Sept. 1980),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/13804/ ''Reggie's Wise Guy Jokes''] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; and the three-issue miniseries ''Reggie's Revenge'' (Spring 1994 – Spring 1995).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/19618/ ''Reggie's Revenge''] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reggie appears as a main character in the 2015 ''Archie'' and ''Jughead'' titles that launched the [[New Riverdale (Archie comics)|New Riverdale]] reboot. On September 20, 2016, it was announced that a five-issue miniseries titled ''Reggie and Me'' would be published as part of the launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/110182/ ''Reggie and Me'' vol. 2] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; It was written by [[Tom DeFalco]] with art by Sandy Jarrell.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/09/20/archie-to-launch-reggie-and-me-with-tom-defalco-and-sandy-jarrell/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Reggie Mantle at one point says he was born in Texas, and comes from a fairly well-to-do family, although certainly nowhere near the level of [[Veronica Lodge]]'s. In Reggie's debut story, Archie refers to him as, 'that snooty Reggie Mantle', indicating his upper-class background. His father, Ricky Mantle, owns a newspaper-publishing company, one of his publications is ''The Riverdale Gazette''. Reggie seems to show journalistic aspirations himself, often working as the editor of the high school paper, Blue and Gold. He is quick to use the term "freedom of the press" to defend controversial or inflammatory articles. Little is known of his mother, though her name was eventually revealed to be Vicky Mantle. Reggie has a brother, Oliver Mantle, who has appeared in ''Life With Archie'' issue #26. Compared to the families of the other main characters, Reggie's family members have made very few appearances in the comics through the decades.

Like many Archie characters, Reggie has a number of relatives who are created for one story only. One, his cousin May, is often mistaken for a pre-teen. After a makeover, she attracts attention at a school dance, but choses to dance with short Dilton. Another cousin, Regina, has Reggie's style of humor, but after a date with Jughead, appears to enjoy herself. Reggie also has a number of relatives whom he often uses to get favors.

Reggie has been known to boast that his family is the only one in Riverdale that has its own coat of arms.

==Interests and personality==
Reggie Mantle's chief characteristics are his love of sarcasm and practical jokes, his vanity, his athletic abilities, and his interest in dating multiple women.

Reggie is a naturally gifted and talented athlete who excels at nearly every major sport, including [[American football|football]], [[baseball]], and [[basketball]], along with more obscure sports such as [[cross country running]] and [[Kung Fu]].&lt;ref name="back91"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thompson|first=Steven |title=Archie's Antagonist, Reggie Mantle|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=91 |pages=63–67|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=September 2016|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often works as a surfing or skiing instructor. Sometimes, if his skills are not enough to secure victory, Reggie cheats, and he often shows little team spirit. Once in a while, Reggie tries to win competitions on a technicality by pulling out a rulebook.

The most common accessories associated with Reggie are the mirror and the comb. A lot of jokes in the comics are about his vanity, earning him the nickname "Reggie 'I-Love-Me' Mantle". Somewhat of a fashion plate, Reggie is the character who most frequently experiments with his hairstyle to match current trends.&lt;ref name="back91"/&gt; These looks have lasted months (rather than been contained within a single story) and have included several incarnations of sideburns, slicked back, short, shaggy, and even a [[ponytail]] in the early 1990s.

Reggie, along with Archie and Jughead, is one of the founding members of the band ''[[The Archies]]''. Reggie is a [[Bass guitar|bassist]] for The Archies and occasionally lead guitarist after Archie, and thinks of himself as the most important and talented member of the group—and has gone to great lengths to prove it, such as hiring [[groupie]]s to scream his name during concerts. Although his instrument of choice is guitar, Reggie has also demonstrated skill in singing, acting, and piano-playing.

His sharp, quick wit has led him to working part-time as a stand-up comedian at a Riverdale comedy club, and hoping to perform professionally someday. In spite of his evident upper-middle class status, he is remarkably cheap, and the first time his schoolmates remember him inviting them to a party, he had filled the room with vending machines from which to obtain the party food.

Reggie is Riverdale High's resident prankster. It is not unusual for Reggie's practical jokes to backfire.&lt;ref name="back91"/&gt; His pranks are usually meant to embarrass his victims rather than physically hurt them. When he tries to humiliate [[Chuck Clayton]] during a sledding contest, Reggie digs a pit for Chuck to fall into when he landed. Reggie fills the pit with [[sawdust]] to soften the blow, adding [[crankcase]] oil to make it stick and covering it with snow to conceal it.

Reggie likes to chase girls, delighting in the pursuit, but is not usually interested in having a serious relationship with one girl. Reggie likes to play the field, and openly announces himself 'a true practitioner of the art'. He has expressed horror at the idea of being tied down to one solitary female, saying that, "having one girl is like having one peanut, one potato chip."

Reggie is [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie Andrews]]'s rival, and has a perennial crush on Veronica Lodge. The fact that she loves Archie makes Reggie jealous, so he spends most of his time trying to outwit Archie, and playing practical jokes on him. Despite the rivalry, he and Archie are generally amicable, and often spend time together pursuing dates or practicing athletics. In ''Archie's Double Digest'' #201, during the possibility of Archie moving, he eventually admits he would miss Archie, whom he calls his best friend. In a lot of the older Archie Comics stories, Reggie and Archie team up to play pranks on [[Jughead Jones]]. Their schemes usually backfire as Jughead outwits them.

Other than Veronica, Reggie is romantically interested in [[Midge Klump]], who is the girlfriend of one of Reggie's athletic teammates, [[Moose Mason]]. Reggie's relentless efforts to spend time with Midge without attracting Moose's ire are a [[running gag]].&lt;ref name="back91"/&gt; He occasionally seeks to date other women, including [[Betty Cooper]]. Reggie and Betty frequently join forces to try and break up Archie and Veronica. In some stories, Reggie and Betty are shown to be a couple, even though their respective interests still lie with Veronica and Archie. The ''Life with Archie'' series looks to a future where Archie marries Veronica and Betty and Reggie are a loving couple. It has been hinted that they are thinking about getting married.

In the rare occasions when Reggie is genuinely trying to help someone, the others usually believe he has nefarious motives, and are wary of trusting him.

Reggie is insanely jealous of anyone else but him being in the spotlight, and will sometimes deliberately cause them trouble to get what he wants.

Reggie is also known to date [[Cheryl Blossom]] occasionally. The two have very similar personalities, and at one point, before she dates a boy named George, try going out together. Like Betty and Veronica, however, Cheryl mainly uses Reggie as an alternative to Archie.

On certain occasions, Reggie shows a kinder side where he will come to the aid of his friends or total strangers, although he prefers to keep these good deeds secret. In one comic, he has a close childhood friendship with an elderly woman named Mrs. Finklehoff.

In one storyline, Reggie is shown to have fallen in love with Veronica's cousin, Harper. They have a long distance relationship, so there aren't many times they are shown together. Harper is a disabled author, blogger, and fashion designer with an automated, bedazzled, bright pink wheelchair.

==Alternate Versions==
In ''[[Afterlife with Archie]]'', Reggie Mantle caused the zombie apocalypse. Midge asks him for money so she can pay for an abortion. This frustrates and angers him to the point that when he sees Hot Dog on the side of the road he swerves to hit him. He immediately regrets his actions and tries to carry Hot Dog to a vet, failing that, he takes him to Jughead's lawn so that he can die at home. Hot Dog's subsequent reanimation results in him infecting Jughead and starting the zombie apocalypse. 

Reggie survives with the others on the road, growing increasingly bitter towards Archie for becoming a natural leader and thriving while he is continually wracked with guilt for starting all this horror. Archie remains oblivious to this, intending to make Reggie the best man at his wedding to Betty. Reggie eventually goes out hunting with Kevin and tells him how he caused the apocalypse, how he killed Hot Dog, how he fears he might be a sociopath and how he thinks the only way to end the zombie plague is by offering himself up to the horde so they can have their revenge and hopefully stop their rampage. He wanders off alone into the woods. Kevin tells the others his story, Archie wants to go after him but Veronica and Betty convince him otherwise.

Reggie walks into the horde, expecting to be torn limb from limb, but instead they part for him until he reaches the zombified Jughead. The zombified Hot Dog walks forward, and Reggie kneels before it, expecting it to kill him and accepting his fate. But, at that moment a vision of Sabrina Spellman appears before him. She tells him that they will make the zombified Midge whole once again and make her do whatever Reggie wants if Reggie returns to his friend and kills Betty Cooper. Reggie's resolve to redeem himself crumbles upon being offered Midge and he responds with "Kill Betty Cooper... sure, why not?"

[[Bill Finger]], [[Bob Kane]] and [[Jerry Robinson]] introduced Scarecrow in the [[Autumn|fall]] of 1941 for ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #3,&lt;ref name=WFC#3/&gt; during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], in which he only made two appearances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcindexes.com/database/character-details.php?storycharid=63&amp;appearances Mike's Amazing World of DC Comics] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120724071215/http://www.dcindexes.com/database/character-details.php?storycharid=63&amp;appearances |date=2012-07-24 }}: Scarecrow of Earth-2. Retrieved July 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The character was revived during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Sheldon Moldoff]] in the pages of ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #189 (February 1967), still maintaining his [[origin story]] from the Golden Age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcindexes.com/database/story-details.php?storyid=8241 Mike's Amazing World of DC Comics] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729120003/http://www.dcindexes.com/database/story-details.php?storyid=8241 |date=2012-07-29 }}: "Fright of the Scarecrow," ''Batman'' #189 (February 1967). Retrieved July 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also in ''Batman'' #189 that the Scarecrow's fear gas debuted.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #189&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1986 multi-title event ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]], the character's origin story is expanded in ''Batman Annual'' #19 and the miniseries ''Batman/Scarecrow: Year One'', with this narrative also revealing that Crane has a [[fear of bats]].&lt;ref name="B/S:YO"&gt;''Batman/Scarecrow: Year One''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, as a result of [[The New 52]] reboot, Scarecrow's origin (as well as that of various other DC characters) is completely altered, incorporating several elements that differ from its original.&lt;ref name="BTDK #4-7"&gt;''Batman: The Dark Knight'' (Vol. 2) #4-7 (February–May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
During his childhood and adolescence, Jonathan Crane was obsessed with fear and revenge as a result of having been constantly [[bullying|bullied]], especially because of his resemblance to [[Ichabod Crane]] from ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]''.&lt;ref name="B/S:YO"/&gt; After being humiliated by his school bully Bo Griggs and rejected by cheerleader Sherry Squires, he takes revenge during the [[senior prom]] by donning his trademark scarecrow costume and brandishing a gun in the school parking lot; in the ensuing chaos, Griggs gets into a car accident, [[paralysis|paralyzing]] himself and killing Squires.&lt;ref name="B/S:YO"/&gt;

Crane's obsession with fear leads to his becoming a [[psychologist]], taking a position at [[Arkham Asylum]] and performing fear-inducing experiments on his patients. He is also a professor of psychology at Gotham University, specializing in the study of [[phobia]]s. He loses his job after he fires a gun inside a packed classroom, accidentally wounding a student; he takes revenge by killing the professors responsible for his termination, and becoming a career criminal.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Annual'' #19&lt;/ref&gt; As a college professor, Crane mentored a young [[Hush (comics)|Thomas Elliot]].&lt;ref name="B:HoH"&gt;''Batman: Heart of Hush''&lt;/ref&gt; The character also has a cameo in ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]]'' #5, seeming uncharacteristically friendly.&lt;ref&gt;''Sandman'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

In stories by [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]], the Scarecrow is depicted as one of the more deranged criminals in Batman's [[List of Batman Family enemies|rogues gallery]], with a habit of speaking in [[nursery rhyme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #73&lt;/ref&gt; These stories further revise his backstory, explaining that he was raised by his [[religious fanaticism|fanatically religious]] grandmother, whom he murdered as a teenager.&lt;ref name="B/S:YO"/&gt;

===Criminal career===
Scarecrow plays a prominent role in [[Doug Moench]]'s "Terror" storyline, set in Batman's early years, where Scarecrow is broken out of prison by the mysteriously returned Professor [[Hugo Strange]], who selects Scarecrow as an ally to help him capture Batman. Scarecrow turns on Strange when Strange's therapy proves effective enough to turn the Scarecrow against his 'benefactor', impaling him on a weather vane and throwing him in the cellar of his own mansion. The Scarecrow then uses Strange's mansion as a trap for Batman, but it is less effective than Strange's plan of attack due to Scarecrow lacking knowledge of Batman's identity; Scarecrow uses Strange's plan to lure Batman to [[Gotham City#East End|Crime Alley]], but his 'trap' consists of simply decapitating one of his former classmates in the alley in front of Batman. With the help of [[Catwoman]]&amp;mdash;whom Scarecrow had attempted to blackmail into helping him by capturing her and photographing her unmasked face&amp;mdash;Batman catches Scarecrow, but loses sight of Strange, with it being unclear whether Strange had actually survived the fall onto the weather vane&amp;mdash;he claimed that he lured rats to himself by using his sweat so that he could eat them&amp;mdash;or if Scarecrow and Batman were hallucinating from exposure to Scarecrow's fear toxin, although Batman concludes that the subsequent explosion of the house has definitely killed Strange.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight'' #137-141&lt;/ref&gt;

Scarecrow appears in ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'', first seen escaping from Arkham on [[Mother's Day]] with help from [[Carmine Falcone]], who also helps the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]] to breakout. The Scarecrow gases Batman with fear toxin as he escapes, causing Batman to flee to his parents' grave as Bruce Wayne, where he is arrested by [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Jim Gordon]] due to Wayne's suspected ties to Falcone. Scarecrow robs a bank with the Mad Hatter on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] for Falcone, but is stopped by Batman and Catwoman. He later appears in Falcone's office on Halloween with [[List of Batman Family enemies|Batman's future rogue's gallery]], but is defeated by Batman.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: The Long Halloween''&lt;/ref&gt; Scarecrow returns in ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'' as part of [[Two-Face]]'s gang, and is first seen putting fear gas in children's dolls on [[Christmas Eve]]. He is eventually defeated by Batman. He later appears as one of the villains present at [[Calendar Man]]'s trial. It is revealed he and Calendar Man had been manipulating Falcone's son [[Alberto Falcone|Alberto]]; Scarecrow had determined that Alberto feared his father, and poisoned his cigarettes with fear toxin to bring out the fear; Calendar Man, meanwhile, had been talking to Alberto, with the fear toxin making Alberto hear his father's voice. Together, they manipulate Alberto into making an unsuccessful assassination attempt on his sister, [[Sofia Falcone|Sofia Gigante]]. After Two-Face's hideout is attacked, Batman captures Scarecrow, who tells him where Two-Face is heading.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Dark Victory''&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Catwoman: When in Rome]]'', Scarecrow supplies the [[Riddler]] with fear gas to manipulate Catwoman, and later aids Riddler when he fights Catwoman in [[Rome]]. Scarecrow accidentally attacks [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] with his scythe before Catwoman knocks him out.&lt;ref&gt;''Catwoman: When in Rome''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scarecrow appears in such [[story arc]]s as ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' and ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat|Shadow of the Bat]]'', first teaming with the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] to ransom off the mayor of [[Gotham City]]. Batman foils their plan, and forces them to retreat. Scarecrow betrays Joker by spraying him with fear gas, but it has absolutely no effect; Joker then beats Scarecrow senseless with a chair. Scarecrow later tries to take over Gotham with an army of hypnotized college students, commanding them to spread his fear gas all over the city. His lieutenant is the son of the first man he killed. He is confronted by both [[Azrael (comics)|Batman-Azrael]] and [[Anarky]], and tries to escape by forcing his lieutenant to jump off of a building. Batman-Azrael knocks him out, and Anarky manages to save the boy.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Knightfall''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Shadow of the Bat''&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his criminal history, he is still recognized as a skilled psychologist. When [[Aquaman]] needed insight into a serial killer operating in his new city of [[Sub Diego]] - [[San Diego]] having been sunk and the inhabitants turned into water-breathers by a secret organization - he consulted Crane for insight into the pattern of the killer's crimes, Crane determining that the victims had been chosen as the initials of their first and last names spelled out the message 'I can't take it any more'&lt;ref&gt;''Aquaman'' (Vol. 6) #30&lt;/ref&gt; (thus allowing Aquaman to determine both the true identity and final target of the real killer).&lt;ref&gt;''Aquaman'' (Vol. 6) #31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Asthecrowflies.jpg|thumb|left|Cover image for the graphic novel ''As the Crow Flies''. Art by [[Richard Friend]] and [[Dustin Nguyen (artist)|Dustin Nguyen]].]]
In the 2004 story arc ''As the Crow Flies'', Scarecrow is hired by the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] under false pretenses. [[Fright (comics)|Dr. Linda Friitawa]] then secretly [[mutation|mutates]] Scarecrow into a murderous creature known as the "Scarebeast", who Penguin uses to kill off his disloyal minions.&lt;ref&gt;''As the Crow Flies'' - ''Batman'' #627 (July 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The character's later appearances all show him as an unmutated Crane again, except for an appearance during the ''[[Batman: War Games|War Games]]'' story arc.&lt;ref&gt;''Villains United'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Villains United Special''&lt;/ref&gt; Scarecrow appears in the third issue of ''War Games'' saving [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] from Batman and acting as the crime lord's ally, until Black Mask uses him to disable a security measure in the Clock Tower by literally throwing Scarecrow at it. Scarecrow wakes up, transforms into Scarebeast, and wreaks havoc outside the building trying to find and kill Black Mask. The police are unable to take it down, and allow Catwoman, [[Tim Drake|Robin]], [[Catalina Flores|Tarantula II]], and [[Onyx (comics)|Onyx]] to fight Scarebeast, as Commissioner Atkins had told all officers to capture or kill any vigilantes, costumed criminals or "masks" they find. Even they cannot defeat the Scarebeast, though he appears to have been defeated after the Clock Tower explodes.&lt;ref&gt;''War Games'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scarecrow reappears alongside other Batman villains in ''[[Gotham Underground]]''; first among the villains meeting at the Iceberg Lounge to be captured by the [[Suicide Squad]]. Scarecrow escapes by gassing [[Bronze Tiger]] with fear toxin. He later appears warning [[Ventriloquist (comics)|the Ventriloquist II]], [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]], [[Killer Moth]] and [[Lock-Up (comics)|Lock-Up]], who are planning to attack the Penguin that Penguin is allied with the Suicide Squad. The villains wave off his warnings and mock him. He later leads the same four into a trap orchestrated by [[Tobias Whale]]. Killer Moth, Firefly and Lock-Up all survive, but are injured and unconscious to varied degrees, the Scarface puppet is "killed", and Peyton Reily, the new Ventriloquist, is unharmed, though after the attack she is taken away by Tobias Whale's men. Whale then betrays Scarecrow simply for touching his shoulder (it is revealed Whale almost pathologically hates "masks" because his grandfather was one of the first citizens of Gotham killed by a masked criminal). The story arc ends with Scarecrow beaten and tied up by Tobias Whale, as a sign to all "masks" that they are not welcome in Whale's new vision of Gotham.&lt;ref&gt;''Gotham Underground''&lt;/ref&gt;

Scarecrow appears in ''[[Batman: Hush]]'', working for the Riddler and Hush. He composes profiles on the various villains of Gotham so Riddler and Hush can manipulate them to their own ends. He later gases [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] with his fear gas, making her attack Catwoman. He attacks Batman in a graveyard, only to learn his fear gas is ineffective (due to Hush's bug), but before he can reveal this he is knocked out by [[Jason Todd]].&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Hush''&lt;/ref&gt; Scarecrow also appears in ''[[Batman: Heart of Hush]]'', kidnapping a child to distract Batman so Hush can attack Catwoman. When Batman goes to rescue the child, Scarecrow activates a Venom implant, causing the boy to attack Batman. He is defeated when Batman ties the boy's teddy bear to Scarecrow, causing the child to attack Scarecrow. After he is captured, Batman attacks him in prison to get Hush's location.&lt;ref name="B:HoH"/&gt;

In the ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|Battle for the Cowl]]'' storyline, Scarecrow is recruited by a new [[Jeremiah Arkham|Black Mask]] to be a part of a group of villains who are aiming to take over Gotham in the wake of Batman's apparent death. He later assists the crime lord in manufacturing a recreational drug called "Thrill," which draws the attention of [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] and [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Batgirl]]. He is later defeated by Batgirl and once again arrested.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Battle for the Cowl''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Blackest Night''===
Scarecrow briefly appears in the fourth issue of the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline. His immunity to fear (brought about by frequent exposure to his own fear toxin) renders him practically invisible to the invading [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]]. The drug has taken a further toll on his sanity, exacerbated by the long disappearance of Batman in the ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'' storyline; he develops a literal addiction to fear, exposing himself deliberately to the [[Revenant (folklore)|revenant]] army, but knowing that only Batman could scare him again.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night'' #5 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Using a duplicate of [[Sinestro]]'s [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]], he &lt;!-- again appears in the sixth issue as he --&gt; is deputized into the [[Sinestro Corps]] for 24 hours in order to combat the Black Lanterns. Overjoyed at finally being able to feel fear again, Scarecrow gleefully and without question follows Sinestro's commands.&lt;ref name="GL (vol.4)"&gt;''Green Lantern'' (Vol. 4) #50&lt;/ref&gt; His joy is cut short when [[Lex Luthor]], overwhelmed by the [[Larfleeze|orange light of Avarice]], steals his ring.&lt;ref name="BN#7 (2010)"&gt;''Blackest Night'' #7 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Brightest Day''===
During the events of ''[[Brightest Day]]'', Scarecrow begins kidnapping and murdering college interns working for [[LexCorp]] as a way of getting back at Lex Luthor for stealing his ring. When [[Damian Wayne|Robin]] and [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] attempt to stop his plans, Scarecrow unleashes a new fear toxin that is powerful enough to affect a [[Kryptonian]]. The toxin forces Supergirl to see visions of a Black Lantern [[Reactron]], but she is able to snap out of the illusion and help Robin defeat Scarecrow.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Batman'' #77&lt;/ref&gt; He is eventually freed from Arkham when [[Deathstroke]] and the [[Teen Titans#Brightest Day: Titans- Villains for Hire|Titans]] break into the asylum in order to capture one of the inmates.&lt;ref&gt;''Titans'' (Vol. 2) #28&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
[[File:Scarecrow Batman The Dark Knight Vol 2 12.png|thumb|Scarecrow on the cover of ''Batman: The Dark Knight'' vol. 2, #12 (October 2012). Art by [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]], Richard Friend, and [[Sonia Oback]].]]
In [[The New 52]] (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Scarecrow is a central villain in the Batman family of books and first appeared in the New 52 in ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight]]'' #4 (February 2012), written by [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]] and [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]]. His origin story is also altered; in this continuity, his father used him as a test subject in his fear-based experiments. As part of the experiments, Jonathan was locked inside a little dark room, while his father (who was examining the test's effects from the outside) suffered a [[heart attack]] and died, leaving Jonathan trapped in the test chamber for days until being freed by some employers of the University.&lt;ref name="BTDK #4-7"/&gt; As a result of this event, he was traumatized for most of his childhood, and eventually developed an obsession with fear. He became a psychologist, specializing in phobias. Eventually, Crane began using patients as test subjects for his fear toxin. His turn to criminality is also markedly different, as he was fired from his professorship for covering an [[Arachnophobia|arachnophobic]] student with spiders, and became a criminal after stabbing a patient to death.&lt;ref name="BTDK (Vol.2)#10-15"&gt;''Batman: The Dark Knight'' (Vol. 2) #10-15, #0 (August 2012-February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scarecrow had kidnapped [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], and works with [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] to create and distribute to various Arkham inmates, a new form of Venom infused with the Scarecrow's fear toxin. With the help of [[Superman]] and [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]], Batman defeats the villains.&lt;ref name="BTDK #4-7"/&gt; The Scarecrow surfaces again in ''Batman: The Dark Knight'' #10, penned by [[Gregg Hurwitz]], for a six-issue arc. The Scarecrow kidnaps Commissioner Gordon and several children, and eventually releases his fear toxin into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="BTDK (Vol.2)#10-15"/&gt; Scarecrow is also used as a pawn by the Joker, for his "[[Death of the Family]]" plot; he is referred to as Batman's Physician.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' (Vol. 2) #16 (March 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Scarecrow appears in ''Swamp Thing'' #19 (June 2013), clipping flowers for his toxins at the Metropolis Botanical Garden. [[Swamp Thing]] attempts to save Scarecrow from cutting a poisonous flower, not realizing who the villain is. Scarecrow attempts to use his fear toxin on Swamp Thing.&lt;ref&gt;''Swamp Thing'' #19 (June 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The toxin causes Swamp Thing to lose control of his powers, until Superman intervenes.&lt;ref&gt;''Swamp Thing'' #20 (July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

He is later approached by [[Outsider (comics)|the Outsider]] of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] to join up with the group. Scarecrow accepts the offer.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' (Vol. 3) #2&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of "[[Forever Evil|Villains Month]]", ''Detective Comics'' vol. 2, #23.3 (Sept. 2013) was titled ''The Scarecrow'' #1.&lt;ref name="Detective Comics Villains"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: DC’s Detective Comics Group Solicits for Villains Month|url=http://www.craveonline.com/comics/previews/511477-exclusive-dcs-villains-month-solicits-for-the-detective-comics-group|publisher=Crave Online|accessdate=June 3, 2013|last=Hunsaker|first=Andy|date=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarecrow goes to see [[Killer Croc]], [[Mr. Freeze]], Poison Ivy, and Riddler and informs them of a war at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] is coming and learns where each of the alliances live. Through his conversations with each, Scarecrow learns that Bane may be the cause of the Blackgate uprising and will be their leader in the impending war. It was also stated that that Talons from the [[Court of Owls]] were stored at Blackgate on ice. Later, looking over the divided city, Scarecrow claims that once the war is over and the last obstacle has fallen, Gotham City would be his.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' (Vol. 2) #23.3&lt;/ref&gt; Scarecrow approaches [[Professor Pyg]] at Gotham Memorial Hospital to see if he will give his supplies and [[Professor Pyg#Dollotrons|Dollotrons]] to Scarecrow's followers. Scarecrow goes to Penguin next, who has already planned for the impending war, by blowing up the bridges giving access to Gotham City.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil: Arkham War'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Scarecrow and [[Man-Bat]] attempt to steal the frozen Talons from Blackgate while Penguin is having a meeting with Bane.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil: Arkham War'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; Killer Croc rescues Scarecrow and Man-Bat from Blackgate and brings Scarecrow to Wayne Tower, where he gives Killer Croc Wayne Tower as it no longer suits him.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil: Arkham War'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; Scarecrow begins waking the Talons in his possession, having doused them with his fear gas and using Mad Hatter's mind-control technology in their helmets to control them.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil: Arkham War'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; At Arkham Asylum, Scarecrow senses that he has lost the Talons after Bane freed them from Mad Hatter's mind-control technology. Scarecrow then turns to his next plan, giving the other inmates a small dose of Bane's Venom to temporarily transform them.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil: Arkham War'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Bane declaring that Gotham City is finally his, he has Scarecrow hanged between two buildings.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil: Arkham War'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Batman and Robin Eternal]]'', flashbacks reveal that Scarecrow was the first villain faced by [[Dick Grayson]] as Robin in the New 52 universe, when his and Batman's investigations into Scarecrow's activities led Batman to Mother, a woman who believes that tragedy and trauma serve as 'positive' influences to help the victims become stronger. To this end, Mother has Scarecrow develop a new style of fear toxin that would make the brain suffer the same experience as witnessing a massive trauma, but Scarecrow turns against Mother as the victims of this plan would become incapable of feeling anything. Recognizing that he will be killed once he has outlived his usefulness, Scarecrow attempts to turn himself over to Batman,&lt;ref&gt;''Batman &amp; Robin Eternal'' #14&lt;/ref&gt; but Batman uses this opportunity to have Crane deliver a fake psychological profile of him to Mother, claiming that Batman is a scared child terrified of fear and losing others to make Mother think she understands him.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman &amp; Robin Eternal'' #15&lt;/ref&gt; In the present day, as Mother unleashes a new hypnotic signal to take control of the world's children, the [[List of Batman supporting characters#Batman Family|Bat Family]] abduct Scarecrow to brew up a new batch of his trauma toxin after determining that it nullifies the controlling influence of Mother's signal until they can shut down her main base.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman &amp; Robin Eternal'' #23&lt;/ref&gt;

===DC Rebirth===
In the [[DC Rebirth]] rebooted universe, Scarecrow has a cameo appearance as one of the many trials that Batman's apprentice [[Duke Thomas (comics)|Duke Thomas]] has faced in his training.&lt;ref&gt;''All-Star Batman'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; He later works with The Haunter to release a low dose of fear gas around Gotham on Christmas, and sets up a small stand for her to pickup the fear gas. Both he and Haunter are paralyzed by the effects of the fear gas and arrested by Batman.&lt;ref&gt;Batman (vol. 3) Annual #1&lt;/ref&gt; The Scarecrow later emerges using a Sinestro Corps' Power ring to induce fear and rage against Batman in random citizens throughout Gotham, to the point where he provokes [[Alfred Pennyworth]] into threatening to shoot [[Simon Baz]] as part of his final assault.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lanterns'' #16&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Scarecrow is among the villains that attend the underground meeting held by Riddler that talks about the Superman Theory.&lt;ref&gt;''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Jonathan Crane is a brilliant psychologist who specializes in fear and phobias. With this knowledge, he knows how to use words to affect a person's actions.

In the story arc ''As the Crow Flies'', after been secretly mutated by Dr. Linda Friitawa, Scarecrow gains the ability to turn into a large monster with greatly enhanced strength, endurance, and a fear gas he naturally emits. However, he has to be under physical strain or duress to transform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brice, Jason |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/111337405582908.htm |title=Batman: As The Crow Flies Review - Line of Fire Reviews |date=April 13, 2005|accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fear gas===
He is also an accomplished biochemist for his invention of '''fear gas''' that causes his victims to experience nightmarish hallucinations. He wears his Scarecrow mask to enhance the effect of the [[hallucinogen]]. The mask contains filters to protect him from his own gas. Prolonged exposure to his own gas has damaged Crane's brain despite measures that have been made to protect himself from it, rendering him nearly incapable of being afraid of anything, except Batman. This is problematic for him, as he is addicted to fear and compulsively seeks out confrontations with Batman to feed his addiction.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night'' #4, #6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weapons===
The Scarecrow at times wields a scythe which he uses in addition to his "violent dancing". Scarecrow also uses a hand-held fear gas sprayer in the shape of a human skull, straws which he leaves as a calling card, special straws which can be snapped in half to release a fear poison (as seen in ''Batman: Hush'') and stuffed scarecrows which scare his victims.

During the ''Blackest Night'' mini-series, Scarecrow is temporarily deputized into the Sinestro Corps by a duplicate of [[Sinestro]]'s Power ring.&lt;ref name="GL (vol.4)"/&gt; He proves to be very capable in manipulating the light of fear to create constructs, until his ring is stolen by [[Lex Luthor]].&lt;ref name="BN#7 (2010)"/&gt;

==Other versions==
As one of [[Batman]]'s most recognizable and popular opponents, the Scarecrow appears in numerous comics which are not considered part of the regular DC continuity, including:

===''Batman/Daredevil''===
The Scarecrow appears in ''[[Batman/Daredevil: King of New York]]'', in which he attempts to use the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s crime empire to disperse his fear gas over [[Gotham City]].

===''DC vs. Marvel''===

This version of Scarecrow is portrayed as a German agent who kills a contact working for the Bat (Batman), the Clock ([[Hourman]]), and the Owl ([[Doctor Mid-Nite]]). In a struggle with Scarecrow, the fiancée of agent [[Terry Sloane]] is killed. This causes Sloane to return to the field as [[Mister Terrific (comics)|Mister Terrific]] and kill Scarecrow.&lt;ref&gt;''JSA: The Liberty Files''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty''===
A stand-in for Jonathan Crane named Jenna Clarke/Scarecrone appears in the ''[[Elseworlds]]'' original graphic novel ''[[Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty]]'' as a henchwoman/consort under the employ of [[Vandal Savage]]. Scarecrone also acts as a stand-in for [[Two-Face]]. She has the power to invade a person's psyche and make their deepest fears appear as illusions simply by touching them. "Scarecrone" is actually a [[dissociative personality disorder|separate personality]] from Jenna Clarke, Vandal Savage requires Clarke to switch to her Scarecrone persona through a special formula that he has made Clarke dependent on. The two personalities are actually extremely antagonistic towards each other. It's revealed that when the formula brings out Scarecrone the right side of her face becomes heavily scarred. This scarring is healed once the formula wears off and the Jenna Clarke personality becomes dominant again.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Justice''===
The Scarecrow is one of the main characters in [[Alex Ross]]' maxi-series ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' as part of the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]].&lt;ref&gt;''Justice'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; He is first seen out of costume in a hospital, injecting a girl in a wheelchair with a serum allowing her to walk.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; Scarecrow was later seen in costume during [[Lex Luthor]]'s speech alongside [[Clayface]] inside the home of [[Black Canary]] and [[Green Arrow]].&lt;ref&gt;''Justice'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; Crane gases Canary while Clayface attacks Green Arrow, but the attack fails on Crane's end when Black Canary finds her husband attacked by Clayface. Oliver defeats Clayface by electrocuting him with a lamp, and the duo flee soon after Canary unleashes her Canary Cry.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; Scarecrow is later seen with Clayface and [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], having captured [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]], and [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]].&lt;ref&gt;''Justice'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Justice League]] storms the Hall of Doom, Scarecrow does not appear to face any particular target and duels the League as a whole. He is one of the few villains to escape the League's initial attack.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice'' #10&lt;/ref&gt; The Justice League follows Scarecrow to his city, whereupon he sends his city's population to attack the League, knowing that they would not hurt civilians. However, [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]'s ring frees the city from Scarecrow's control, subsequently freeing Scarecrow from [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s control. Scarecrow does not seem bothered by this realization, admitting he would have done it anyway. He causes a diversion by releasing his fear gas into his entire city, driving his citizens into a homicidal frenzy,&lt;ref&gt;''Justice'' #11&lt;/ref&gt; and manages to escape capture, but he is ambushed and nearly killed by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] in retaliations for not having been invited to the Legion of Doom. Scarecrow's city is again saved by the Justice League.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;

He is about to kill a former football player when [[vampire]] Batman appears, noting that Scarecrow is almost worse than him; he now has no choice but to kill, but Scarecrow has a choice and yet he chose to prey on innocents. Batman then grabs Scarecrow's vial of fear gas, crushing it along with the supervillain's hand, and [[Decapitation|cuts Scarecrow's head off]] with his own [[sickle]], declaring that Scarecrow has no idea what fear really is.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Crimson Mist''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Batman Adventures''===
In ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' #1, Scarecrow is seen along some other [[Batman]] rogues at [[Arkham Asylum]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Batman Adventures'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; In issue #9, Scarecrow is seen during a flashback sequence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Batman Adventures'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; Series writer [[Ty Templeton]] mentioned during an interview that he originally wanted to use the Scarecrow in a story which would have revealed why an accident and a murder trial provoked him to change his costume, as his face was never seen in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' TV show, but the series was canceled before Scarecrow's mystery could have been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batribute/thecomic/ty.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New 52 Batman Beyond books that takes place after ''[[Future's End]]'', the future Batman fights a new, female version of the Scarecrow named '''Adalyn Stern'''. As a child, Adalyn was traumatized when she witnessed Batman brutally beat up her father (who was a notorious gang leader). She was placed in institutional care until she was assigned to one of Jonathon Crane's disciples who attempted to treat her with technology derived from Crane's work, which only amplified her fear of Batman. She grows up and becomes a co-anchor to [[The Creeper (comics)|Jack Ryder]] on the News 52. She uses A.I. cubes placed in everyone's homes to brainwash the population into believing that the new Batman is a demonic monster that needs to be put down. She is eventually defeated by the combined efforts of the original and new Batman as well as Jack Ryder and is placed in Arkham Asylum afterwards when she views herself as nothing but the Scarecrow.

This was done so that Napier, who was using [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]]’s technology to control Clayface, could control them by way of Clayface’s ability to control parts of his body that had been separated from him. Scarecrow and the other villains are then used to attack a library which Napier himself was instrumental in building in one of [[Gotham City]]’s poorer districts. Later on in the story, the control hat is stolen by Neo-Joker (the second [[Harley Quinn]], who felt that Jack Napier was a pathetic abnormality while Joker was the true, beautiful personality), in an effort to get Napier into releasing the Joker persona.

His father Gerald Crane (portrayed by [[Julian Sands]]) creates the "fear toxin", a serum designed to eliminate fear, and then injects Jonathan with it. Detectives [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]] and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] save Jonathan's life, but are too late to save his sanity; the toxin has left him in a state of perpetual terror, plagued by hallucinations of his greatest fear: scarecrows. He is next seen in the season four episode "[[Pax Penguina]]", in which he is institutionalized in Gotham Asylum, where the corrupt warden Reed uses his fears to keep him under control. A gang of criminals led by Grady Harris and Merton bribe Reed to give them Crane and forces him to re-create his father's fear toxin so they can use it to control Gotham City. Jonathan eventually embraces his fear and uses the toxin against Grady Harris after Merton and his fellow gang members were arrested. He then wreaks havoc on Gotham with the toxin as "The Scarecrow". In "[[The Fear Reaper]]", Crane invades Gotham Asylum and uses the fear gas on Warden Reed and other inmates causing the guards to flee. When Gordon confronts Scarecrow, he gets infected with fear gas until he overcomes it. After Gordon turns on the sprinklers and undoes the fear gas' effects on the inmates, Scarecrow got away. In "A Dark Knight: One of My Three Soups," Scarecrow is shown as an inmate at Arkham Asylum after getting apprehended at some point and is freed by Jervis Tetch where they collaborate in a plot that involves releasing all the inmates of Arkham Asylum. After Jervis is defeated by Jim Gordon, Scarecrow gasses the driver of his transport as he and Jerome free him for their next plot.

====Animation====
* Scarecrow appeared in ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'', voiced by [[Ted Knight]]. Although he does not use fear gas in this series, he uses knock-out gas, which he keeps in eggs. He was seen in the episode "The Great Scarecrow Scare".
* Scarecrow appeared in ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', voiced by [[Don Messick]]. He is as a member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Legion of Doom]] and is shown to have control over a flock of crows, but no other powers.
* Scarecrow appeared in the ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians|Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'', voiced by [[Andre Stojka]]. In the episode "The Fear", Scarecrow captures [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] and [[Wonder Woman]] after he expose them and [[Batman]] to his fear transmitters, as he forces the Caped Crusader to relive the memories of his parents' murder in Crime Alley, which would be the first animated rendition of Batman's origin. In the same episode, Professor Crane was working as a consultant for Commissioner Gordon and the [[Gotham City Police Department]] to help them find Scarecrow and put an end to his exploits of fear, without anyone knowing yet that both are the same person. Using his detective skills, Batman was able to figure out that Scarecrow and Professor Crane were one and the same. Later, Batman confronts the villain in a cornfield, where he was soon able to apprehend Crane, rescue Wonder Woman and Robin, and turn him over to the Gotham City Police.

* The Scarecrow is featured in multiple animated series set in the [[DC animated universe|DC Animated Universe]].
** The character first appears in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Henry Polic II]] with an English accent. In the episode "Nothing to Fear", he plots to use his fear gas to take revenge on the Gotham University Board members who fired him for experimenting on his students. Scarecrow drugs [[Batman]] with his fear toxin, inflicting upon the Dark Knight visions of a worst fear: his [[Thomas Wayne|late father]] telling Batman being ashamed. Scarecrow kidnaps the Dean of the University and escapes in a stolen Gotham police blimp. But when Batman arrives, he activates a self-destruct mechanism and leaves the two to die. During the assault on the blimp, Batman wills himself to overcome the toxin, and uses Scarecrow's own weapon against him. Scarecrow hallucinates about his own phobia - [[chiroptophobia|a fear of bats]] - and collapses into helpless terror; Batman then takes him to [[Arkham Asylum]]. In the episode "Fear of Victory", Scarecrow combines his fear gas with adrenalin to use on Gotham's athletes, rendering them unable to play; he then bets against their teams. He is defeated by Batman and Robin ([[Dick Grayson]]) before he can realize the final stage of his plan: to use fear toxin on an entire stadium. In the episode "Dreams of Darkness", Scarecrow plots to taint the water supply beneath Arkham with fear toxin, in the process using it on Batman put in Arkham; Batman manages to overcome the toxin, and defeats Scarecrow. In the episode "Trial", Scarecrow makes a non-voiced appearance (due to Henry Polic's throat surgery) on the jury during the rogue's gallery's 'trial' against Batman. In the episode "Lock Up", Scarecrow meets his match with Arkham security guard Lyle Bolton's brutal interrogation methods terrifying even him; he breaks out of Arkham to get away from Bolton, only to be brought back by Batman and Robin. Scarecrow joins [[Harley Quinn]] and the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist &amp; Scarface]] in issuing a complaint, resulting in Bolton being fired. When Bolton, as the villain [[Lock-Up (comics)|Lock-Up]], ends up in Arkham, Scarecrow vows to "teach [Lock-Up] new lessons in fear".
** Scarecrow returns in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', voiced by [[Jeffrey Combs]] (in "Never Fear") and by [[Jeff Bennett]] (in "Over the Edge" [albeit uncredited]). The character gets [[wikt:revamp|revamp]]ed from his earlier appearances because producer [[Bruce Timm]] felt the character never actually looked scary; this problem was finally rectified with the second redesign. Director [[Dan Riba]] said that he "evolved the most of all the characters", saying that "we got darker, darker, and darker with the character." Timm described the revamped look as resembling a "western preacher", complete with a noose around his neck, as well as a "''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' [[Leatherface]], kind of look, and it really had nothing to do with being a Scarecrow ''per se''. But he was definitely scary". This version was never shown out of costume, because [[Paul Dini]] said "we weren't even sure if there was an actual guy in the suit" and also spoke in a low, rasping whisper with which the show's creators felt he should have spoken with all along.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman - Arkham Files''&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "Never Fear", Scarecrow creates a new toxin that completely eliminates fear and makes its victims reckless and dangerous. Batman is exposed to the gas, which renders the Dark Knight unafraid to kill. When Batman begins to lose control, Robin ([[Tim Drake]]) subdues Batman and goes after Scarecrow himself. Batman escapes and nearly kills Scarecrow, until Robin gives the Dark Knight the antidote; the Dynamic Duo then apprehend him peacefully and take him to Arkham Asylum. In the episode "Over the Edge", Scarecrow attacks Gotham City Hall, and sprays Batgirl with his fear toxin. The poison makes [[Barbara Gordon]] have a nightmare in which she is killed and a vendetta erupts between Batman and Commissioner Gordon. Barbara later awakes from this nightmare when Scarecrow's fear toxin wears off.
** Scarecrow was originally planned to appear in the final season of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]]. Due to the Bat-embargo, this was not possible. This would have been a tribute to the fact that he was one of the original 13 members of the Legion of Doom in ''Challenge of the Super Friends''.
* Scarecrow appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. In the episode "Trials of the Demon", he collaborates with Scream Queen to put jack-o'-lanterns filled with fear gas on a Halloween night in a local neighborhood. Scarecrow is defeated by Batman while Scream Queen is defeated by the [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Flash]] using the toxin in some pumpkins in a patch against Scream Queen. Scarecrow appears as an inmate at Blackgate Penitentiary in the episode "Night of the Huntress", and is among the singing inmates at Arkham Asylum in the episode "[[Mayhem of the Music Meister!]]".

* Scarecrow was intended to appear as the main villain of ''[[Batman in film#Batman: DarKnight|Batman: DarKnight]]'', another film of the ''Batman'' film series that was cancelled. In the film, Dr. Jonathan Crane uses his position as professor of psychology at Gotham University and as head psychologist at [[Arkham Asylum]] to conduct experiments concerning fear (this element would later appear in ''Batman Begins''). During a vengeful confrontation with a colleague, [[Man-Bat|Dr. Kirk Langstrom]], Crane unknowingly initiates Langstrom's transformation into the creature known as [[Man-Bat]]. Crane then exacts revenge on those responsible for his dismissal from both Arkham and the university while encountering truths about his past.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite news|author= Bill "Jett" Ramey|url= http://batman-on-film.com/interview_lshapiro.html|title= Interview: Lee Shapiro|work= Batman-on-Film|date= July 28, 2005|accessdate= October 18, 2008|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080925094024/http://batman-on-film.com/interview_lshapiro.html|archivedate= September 25, 2008|deadurl= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''The Dark Knight Trilogy''=====
[[File:DarkKnightTrilogyScarecrow.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Cillian Murphy]] as Dr. Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow in ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005).]]
* [[Cillian Murphy]] portrays Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow in [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[Batman in film#The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005-2012) - Christopher Nolan|The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'', and is the only villain to appear in all three films. This version of the character wears a [[Hessian (cloth)|burlap]] sack with a built-in [[rebreather]] that doubles as a [[gas mask]] for his fear experiments. Murphy explained that the relatively simple mask, as opposed to the full scarecrow costume usually seen in the comics, was utilized because he "wanted the Scarecrow to avoid the [[Worzel Gummidge]] look, because he's not a very physically imposing man—he's more interested in the manipulation of the mind and what that can do".&lt;ref name="Adam Smith 77"/&gt;
** In ''[[Batman Begins]]'', Dr. Jonathan Crane is a corrupt [[psychopharmacology|psychopharmacologist]] working as Chief Administrator at [[Arkham Asylum]] who has secretly created a fear-inducing gas. He plots with the [[terrorism|terrorist]] [[Ra's al Ghul]] to expose the entire population of [[Gotham City]] to this toxin. Crane smuggles the hallucinogenic chemical ingredient for his "fear gas" into Gotham through the connections of mob boss [[Carmine Falcone]], and in exchange Crane testifies in court that all of Falcone's arrested men are legally insane and should be moved to Arkham for "rehabilitation". Assistant District Attorney [[Rachel Dawes]] accuses Crane of being corrupt, prompting Crane and Falcone to plot to have Dawes murdered. When an arrested Falcone later attempts to blackmail Crane, the latter dons his gas mask and douses Falcone with his fear toxin, driving the crime lord insane and causing him to repeatedly utter 'Scarecrow'. During Crane's first encounter with [[Batman]], he sprays the vigilante with his fear gas and sets him on fire, though Batman narrowly escapes with both his life and mind intact. With [[Lucius Fox]]'s help, Batman develops an antidote to Crane's drug. At Arkham Asylum, Crane exposes Rachel to his fear toxin when his illegal operations are discovered. However, Batman arrives and gives Crane a dose of his own medicine before leaving him for [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] to arrest. Despite being institutionalized at Arkham, Crane escapes during the mass release of the asylum's inmates as part of Ra's plot to plunge Gotham into fear. As Ra's unleashes the gas on the city's slums, Crane, now calling himself 'Scarecrow', pursues Rachel and a boy on a police horse. After Rachel shocks Scarecrow with a [[taser]], Crane aimlessly rides off into the night and remains at large.
** In ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', Scarecrow returns near the beginning of the film. He and his men meet with mob boss Chechen's crew at a car park, who complains about the effects that Scarecrow's sold toxin has on his customers. A group of Batmen impostors then arrive and attack the two criminals, only to be interrupted by the real vigilante. Scarecrow attempts to escape in his van after spraying a Batman impostor with his gas, but the real Batman manages to apprehend Crane and ties him up along with the impostors for the police to arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=September 14, 2008|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1591147/20080718/story.jhtml?rsspartner=rssColdFusion|title='The Dark Knight': Ledgerdemain |publisher=MTV|date=July 18, 2008|author=Loder, Kurt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', Jonathan Crane has a minor role. He is released along with the other prisoners of [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] when [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] takes control of Gotham. Once liberated, Crane presides over a [[show trial]] which he refers to as a sentencing hearing wherein Gotham's wealthiest citizens are given a choice between death and exile. Those who choose "exile" are made to cross the thick ice over the frozen river connecting Gotham to the other shore, with an almost certain chance of falling through the thin ice and drowning. In addition, Bane also grants Crane full control of the courts to the extent that even Bane himself would not affect his ruling decision. When Commissioner Gordon, several cops, and [[Talia al Ghul|Miranda Tate]] are captured and brought into trial, Gordon tells Crane that he and his men won't go on the ice willingly and therefore chooses death. Crane sentences them to "death by exile", while Bane takes Miranda. However, Batman manages to save Gordon. After Batman stops Bane's plan to detonate a [[nuclear bomb]] in Gotham, Crane is presumably arrested by Gotham police along with many other convicted criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/07/16/times-review-of-the-dark-knight-rises-to-the-depths-to-the-heights/?iid=sl-category-mostpop2 |title='The Dark Knight Rises' Review: Best Superhero Movie Yet |work=Time |date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Animation====
* Scarecrow appears in the [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] animated production ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'', voiced by [[Corey Burton]]. During the character's appearance in the segment "In Darkness Dwells", Scarecrow gathers an army of Arkham inmates in the sewers and uses [[Killer Croc]] to get them from above. As Jonathan Crane, he had been Killer Croc's psychologist at Arkham Asylum. Scarecrow uses Killer Croc to capture the priest Cardinal O'Fallon to hold on a mock trial in the sewers because Scarecrow is angered by O'Fallon's attempts to help the homeless. Scarecrow sentences O'Fallon to death, but is saved by Batman triggering an explosion in the process. Nevertheless, Scarecrow escapes the authorities when the sewers begin to flood.
* Scarecrow didn't appear in ''[[Justice League: Doom]]'', but he is mentioned by Batman. Also in the film, his fear gas is used by [[Carol Ferris|Star Sapphire]] in a trap against [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], to undermine his will and exploit his fears, convincing him that he doesn't deserve the power and to renounce his ring. Batman then shows himself and offers to Jordan the antidote, but refuses, instead summoning his ring and reestablishes his willpower, overcoming the effects of the fear gas.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Justice League: Doom]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scarecrow appears in ''[[Batman: Assault on Arkham]]'', voiced by Christian Lanz. Scarecrow is one of the many inmates released from Arkham Asylum by [[Joker (character)|the Joker]] during his plans to activate a dirty bomb within Gotham and the [[Suicide Squad]]'s mission to infiltrate the institution. He injected his fear gas into some of the guards before ultimately being recaptured.
* Scarecrow didn't appear but is mentioned in ''[[Justice League: Throne of Atlantis]]''. In the film, Batman is pursuing some of Scarecrow's henchmen in order to scare them into giving Batman his location, but [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] intervenes and catches them, which angers Batman.
** Scarecrow also appears in an animated short included on home video of the film called ''Nightwing and Robin'', with [[Michael Rosenbaum]] providing the voice for the character. The short features [[Nightwing (Dick Grayson)|Nightwing]] and [[Damian Wayne|Robin]] facing Scarecrow and his gang in a warehouse, which results in the villain's defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Finest - Justice League: Throne of Atlantis|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/dcuam/throneofatlantis/backstage/nightwingrobin/|website=www.worldsfinestonline.com|accessdate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Scarecrow makes an uncredited appearance in ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Gotham City Breakout]]''. He is among the villains Superman unintentionally releases from Arkham Asylum. When the Justice League is held captive at the Joker's funhouse, Scarecrow douses the Justice League with fear gas, rendering them cowardly enough for the other villains to torment them. Scarecrow is last seen towards the end of the movie where he is defeated by Robin and put back in Arkham Asylum.

====''Lego''====
{{main article|Lego Batman}}
* Scarecrow appears in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]'', with vocal effects provided by [[Dave Wittenberg]]. He is seen working for the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. He has only one special ability: mind control, with which he can make guards open doors. He also sprays his fear gas which petrifies his victims; however, it only works at close range. In addition he makes full use of his "violent dancing" martial arts skills in unarmed combat. Scarecrow also uses a biplane, which he uses to distribute his fear gas, and is a vehicle boss in the hero campaign.
* Scarecrow appears in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Nolan North]]. After the Joker breaks out of Arkham once again, Batman and [[Tim Drake|Robin]] investigate. The elevator breaks and they fall under the asylum, where lots of rioting inmates are on the loose. Scarecrow is then seen watching and he tries to slow Batman down multiple times using fear toxin. After Batman shuts down all the fear venom barriers, Batman finally faces Scarecrow. Scarecrow then floods the room with fear toxin which makes Batman and Robin see visions of a giant Scarecrow. Once Batman and Robin turns on the fans to stop the fear poison, they easily take down Jonathan Crane. Later, when all the inmates of the asylum are on the loose, Scarecrow hides out in a pumpkin tent in the amusement mile. He is flooding the amusement park with fear poison, which you can see the citizens running and screaming. Batman confronts Scarecrow, but Scarecrow fills the tent with his fear toxin, which makes Batman see a giant version of Scarecrow once again. Batman then destroys the pumps that are producing fear venom, which makes Scarecrow look normal size again. Batman then easily takes down Crane and brings him back to custody. After you defeat Scarecrow, you can buy him and play as him anytime in free play mode.

====''Batman: Arkham''====
{{main article|Batman: Arkham}}
[[File:Arkham Knight Scarecrow Promo.jpg|thumb|right|Scarecrow in a promotional image for ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]''.]]
The Scarecrow appears in the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' video game series. The version of the character as he first appeared sports a mechanical gauntlet strapped with four fluorescent hypodermic needles on his right hand, which he uses to inject fear toxin into his victims. His voiceover work was provided by vocal artist [[Dino Andrade]] in ''Arkham Asylum'' and the mobile game ''Arkham Underworld,'' and by actor [[John Noble]] in ''Arkham Knight''.

=====''Arkham Asylum''=====
{{main article|Batman: Arkham Asylum}}
In the series' first game, Scarecrow's character design is shirtless, wearing a pair of tattered pants and emphasizing his overall skinny body type. Set free by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] during his takeover of [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham Island]], he appears several times over the course of the story using his fear toxin to make [[Batman]] experience powerful and nightmarish hallucinations. Presented with haunting images featuring his enemies as well as the deaths of his parents, Batman has to overcome each scenario by using a manifestation of his willpower, the [[Bat-Signal]], to defeat Scarecrow in each hallucinatory instance.

After his final defeat, Scarecrow eventually flees down to [[Killer Croc]]'s lair in the bowels of the Asylum to dump his most potent toxin into Gotham's water supply in an attempt to drive [[Gotham City]] into madness. However, a hungry Croc suddenly attacks Scarecrow and attempts to eat him. Acting quickly, Batman activates his electric collar with a [[Batarang]], and the monster disappears, dragging Scarecrow back into the water with him. In one of the three possible post-credits endings, Scarecrow's hand is seen emerging from the water and grabbing onto a floating box of the Titan formula, which was used to transform several of Joker's henchmen into large, mindless beasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/video-game-moments/38|title=Batman: Arkham Asylum - Encountering Scarecrow|author=|date=|website=IGN|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Arkham City''=====
{{main article|Batman: Arkham City}}
Scarecrow is not physically present in the eponymous prison during the events of the series' second game, which takes place approximately one year after ''Arkham Asylum''. That prison, "Arkham City," consists of a few districts in the larger Gotham City that have been walled off from the other neighborhoods of Gotham. It is administrated by [[Hugo Strange]], with the story revealing its creation to be a step toward a plot of larger global domination by Strange and [[Ra's al Ghul|his master]].

While exploring Arkham City, the player can discover several artifacts and signals that point toward Scarecrow's continued activity in Gotham, and allusions to a future confrontation he is preparing for with Batman. Near the Industrial District, which has been claimed by the Joker, Batman can discover Scarecrow's discarded mask, which unlocks a story that gives ideas to Scarecrow's fate after his encounter with Killer Croc in the Asylum. In the story, it's revealed that nobody has laid eyes on Jonathan Crane since the night Batman saw him at the Asylum. While some write him off as having surely been killed by Croc, Batman maintains no such belief: he knows that Crane is still out there somewhere, and needs to be stopped.

Also in Arkham City's Industrial District, Batman can locate a small boat in the harbor that doesn't register anything out of the ordinary on his Detective Mode vision. When he lands on this boat and uses his Cryptographic Sequencer gadget to unlock a secret and hidden door, it opens to reveal several indications as to Scarecrow's activities. The most obvious sign is a nearly comatose test subject, one of the Joker's henchmen, tied to a chair and mostly unconscious. Looking further, you can see a flood of crawling cockroaches up the walls, as well as a document from Falcone Shipping indicating Crane's importation of live insects for undisclosed medical research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eeggs.com/items/58980.html&lt;/ref&gt; While monitoring radio frequencies in Arkham City, the player can also discover hidden broadcasts of a mysterious voice reading a sequence of numbers. When translated, the frequencies reveal three different phrases: the first says, "I will return Batman!" The second says, "You will pay for what you have done to me!" And the final code says, "Fear will tear Gotham to shreds!"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/wikis/batman-arkham-city/Easter_Eggs&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Arkham Origins''=====
{{main article|Batman: Arkham Origins}}
In the prequel game taking place roughly five years before the events of ''Arkham Asylum'' during the second year of Batman's crimefighting career, Scarecrow makes no physical appearance either as his costumed persona or as Dr. Jonathan Crane. Though not confirmed, it seems likely that by this point in the timeline he had yet to make his debut as Scarecrow.

There are a couple of allusions to Crane, however: after saving [[Vicki Vale]] and a group of other reporters in the opening segment taking place in [[Blackgate Penitentiary]], the player can walk into the guard office to the right and see that Dr. Jonathan Crane has signed in several times to visit Blackgate inmates. Additionally, a flyer soliciting test subjects for Dr. Crane's research on fear can be found on the Penguin's ship, the "Final Offer," docked at Amusement Mile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/batman-arkham-origins/Cheats_and_Secrets|title=The Scarecrow in Batman: Arkham Origins|author=|date=June 11, 2015|website=IGN|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Arkham Knight''=====
{{main article|Batman: Arkham Knight}}
Scarecrow appears in ''Batman: Arkham Knight''. Seeking revenge on Batman, Scarecrow re-emerges in Gotham City two years after being attacked by Killer Croc in Arkham Asylum. Scarecrow's appearance has changed drastically following his encounter with Killer Croc, with Scarecrow now sporting a leg brace and having his gas mask now permanently grafted on his face.

Scarecrow joins forces with a man known only as the "[[Arkham Knight]]", a paramilitary commander who commands a militia that answers only to him and Scarecrow. In his latest campaign against Gotham, Scarecrow unites all of Gotham's criminals in an attempt to finally kill Batman. At the beginning of the game, Scarecrow threatens to release his new strain of fear toxin on the streets of Gotham, resulting in the evacuation of most of the city's civilian population. The Arkham Knight's militia then conquers Gotham, preventing the authorities from interfering with Scarecrow's plan. Batman soon discovers that Scarecrow's new fear gas is being manufactured at the ACE Chemicals plant. Defeating the militia there, Batman confronts Scarecrow in the central mixing chamber, where the villain informs Batman that [[Barbara Gordon]] has been captured, before locking the hero inside the imploding facility. Batman manages to reduce the blast radius and narrowly escape, after contending with a hallucination of the deceased Joker.

Scarecrow later appears on an airship owned by magnate [[Simon Stagg]], revealing that he had hired the businessman to create "the Cloudburst:" a device that will disperse his toxin in the form of a giant cloud over Gotham. When Stagg attempts to double-cross Scarecrow, the villain captures him and takes charge of the device. Scarecrow evades Batman once again, and the Cloudburst is extracted with the help of the Arkham Knight. After Batman destroys the device and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] sacrifices herself to dissipate the fear gas using a weaponized network of plants, Batman tracks down the Arkham Knight to his headquarters and defeats him for the final time, discovering his identity as [[Jason Todd]], his second partner to serve as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] whom he believed for the last several years to have been killed by the Joker in the bowels of Arkham Asylum.

After the Arkham Knight disappears, his militia swear their allegiance to Scarecrow and their new appointed commander, [[Deathstroke]]. Batman locates and confronts Scarecrow again, but the villain holds Barbara at gunpoint, and forces [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] to shoot Batman in exchange for his daughter's life. Scarecrow then betrays the Commissioner by pushing Barbara off the building. Though Gordon shot Batman, he did so in a reinforced area of his suit, which allowed him to save Barbara. In the mayhem, Scarecrow and his militia forces escape, now holding Commissioner Gordon hostage. After kidnapping an already incapacitated [[Tim Drake|Robin]], Scarecrow tells Batman to surrender at the abandoned Arkham Asylum, where he unmasks Batman as Bruce Wayne for the world to see, before injecting the crime-fighter with three full doses of fear toxin. Batman eventually overcomes the chemical, and is soon after freed by the newly-reformed Jason Todd, who has adopted a new persona as the "[[Red Hood#Jason Todd|Red Hood]]" before Scarecrow can kill him. Batman subsequently injects Scarecrow with his own toxin, and the villain is subdued and taken into police custody.

=====''Arkham Underworld''=====
In the [[freemium]] mobile game ''Batman: Arkham Underworld'' Scarecrow appears as a playable character. He is the last villain to be unlocked, after the player completes a mission for him, wielding a scythe and his fear gas to great effect, even being able to teleport short distances. The game takes place in an undetermined period before the events of ''Arkham Asylum''.

====''Injustice''====
* Scarecrow makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''.

In combat, he uses his fear gas to make the opponents face a hallucination of a monstrous version of himself. In the story, Scarecrow is one of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]] members, and has joined them in order to sow fear and panic around the world. Scarecrow is first seen at the Slaughter Swamp, alongside [[Deadshot]] and Poison Ivy, sending large amounts of his toxin to Grodd until [[Green Arrow]], [[Black Canary]] and [[Harley Quinn]] show up to face them, but after [[Swamp Thing]] emerges, Scarecrow flees on a boat. Later during [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s invasion, Scarecrow confronts Wonder Woman inside a bar at [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] where he is defeated. In his single player ending, he breaks Brainiac’s mind with his toxin, then hijacks Brainiac's ship as his own personal laboratory to study the fears of the thousands of civilizations Brainiac has collected.

'''W. Watson and Son''' was an optical instrument maker. In 1837, the William Watson business was established in London for the manufacture of [[optical instruments]]. By the 1840s, the company moved into lanterns, slides and associated equipment. In 1868, the name was changed to W. Watson &amp; Son and by this time were located at 313 High Holborn, London. In the 1870s, the company added photographic equipment and became known as a leading manufacturer of the ''Highest Class Photographic Instruments and Apparatus'' in England. Into the 1940s, the company remained at 313 [[High Holborn]], London, England.

==Medical electrology and radiology==
In January 1905, the display of apparatus at the Annual Meeting and Exhibition of the [[Medical and Chirurgical Society of London|British Electrotherapeutic Society]] was quite remarkable. Those in attendance were treated to items and displays of much interest, several items on display for the first time. [[High frequency]] apparatus was featured to a lesser extent than shown in previous years, but appliances for [[Röntgen ray]] work were plentiful. Excerpt from the Exhibit handbook follows:
*W. Watson &amp; Sons (313, High Holborn, W.C.).&lt;ref&gt;Siegle, A. (1905). W. Watson &amp; Sons. Apparatus at the Annual Exhibition of the British Electrotherapeutic Society. Medical Electrology and Radiology. (6): 62.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text="showed Protective X-ray Gloves of a useful type, made of opaque flexible material, and very convenient for practical use; also an X-ray tube with a special arrangement of electrodes for improving the quality of the X-rays when operated with a coil by diverting the inverse impulses of the field of action. It is claimed that, with one of tubes, a high potential transformer can be employed direct in X-ray work without the need for any valve tube or other " rectifying " device. The anode, or second terminal, is at a distance from the antikathode, and is so placed in the tube that when the current is in the reverse direction its bombardment is directed into a depression at the back of the antikathode where it is innocuous."|&lt;ref&gt;Siegle, A.

The '''Wicocomico''', '''Wiccocomoco''', '''Wighcocomoco''', or '''Wicomico''' {{IPA|/waɪkɛ'kɑːməkɛ/}} were an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribe who lived in [[Northumberland County, Virginia]], at the head and slightly north of the [[Little Wicomico River]]. They were a fringe group in [[Powhatan]]'s Confederacy. In the mid-seventeenth century, the colonial court of Virginia ordered them to merge with a smaller tribe; the group was known as Wicocomico when assigned a reservation of {{convert|4400|acre|km2}} near Dividing Creek, south of the [[Great Wicomico River]].

After losing the last of their reservation land in the early 1700s, the tribe disappeared from the historical record and was considered extinct. Since the late twentieth century, descendants have organized, documented history and genealogy, and are seeking recognition.

==History==
The Wicocomico people were encountered by Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] in 1608 as he explored Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Smith| first = John |title = The generall historie of Virginia, New England &amp; the Summer isles | publisher = J. MacLehose and sons | year = 1907 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=-195AAAAMAAJ }} Reprinted from the 1624 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes a village of about 130 men on the South side of the mouth of the Patawomeke (Potomac) River.

The Northumberland County Court began interfering in the governance of the local tribes by the mid-1600s. Sometime between 1652 and 1655, the Court directed the Wicocomico and [[Chicacoan]] (or [[Sekakawons]]) tribes to merge and relocate slightly south of the [[Great Wicomico River]]. They were given 50 acres per fighting man, for a total of {{convert|4400|acre|km2}} near Dividing Creek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rountree | first = Helen |title = Pocahontas's People: The Powhatan Indians of Virginia through Four Centuries | publisher = Univ. of Oklahoma Press | year = 1996 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=fUzd7LeJpjYC | isbn = 9780806128498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lower Cuttatawomen probably merged with them between 1656 and 1659. The merged tribes' adopted the name of "Wicocomico" as that group were the most numerous. The Court appointed ''Machywap'' (formerly King of the Chicacoan) as the [[weroance]] of the combined tribes, as he was considered a friend of the English and easy to manage. By 1659, the Wicocomico had deposed Machywap, possibly by force, and replaced him with ''Pekwem'' as their weroance.

There were constant problems with the colonists' encroachment on their lands. From 1660 to 1673, the Wicocomico frequently challenged colonists in court over land disputes. Although most disputes were settled in favor of the Wicocomico, by 1719 they retained only {{convert|1700|acre|km2}} of their original {{convert|4400|acre|km2|adj=on}} reservation. In 1705, [[Robert Beverley, Jr.]] wrote "In Northumberland, Wiccocomoco, has but three men living, which yet keep up their Kingdom, and retain their Fashion; they live by themselves, separate from all other Indians, and from the English."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beverley | first = Robert |title = The History of Virginia | publisher = Univ. of Michigan | year = 1855 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=R8czWaz0h9kC }} Reprinted from the 1722 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; After June 1719 and the death of William Taptico, the last Wicocomico weroance, the English took the lands. The remnants of the Wicocomico dispersed, and the tribe has been considered extinct. In 1730, the [[Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730]] declared that one of the public tobacco warehouses should be "At Wiccocomico, at Robert Jones's; and at Coan, at the warehouses in Northumberland, under one inspection." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/_An_Act_for_amending_the_Staple_of_Tobacco_and_for_preventing_Frauds_in_his_Majesty_s_Customs_1730 "Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730"], ''Encyclopedia of Virginia''&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 20th century, according to their website, descendants of Chief Taptico have worked to document their genealogy and history, as well as to re-organize as a tribe known as the Wicocomico Indian Nation. They have not received state or federal recognition, although they are preparing required documentation for the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wicocomico-indian-nation.com/pages/history.html Wicocomico History], Wicocomico Indian Nation&lt;/ref&gt;
