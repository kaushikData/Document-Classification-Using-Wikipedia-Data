==Events==

* July - ''[[Les Cousins (film)|Les Cousins]]'', another film of the [[French New Wave]], wins the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[9th Berlin International Film Festival]].

Part of the [[AFI 100 Years... series]], '''AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars''' is a list of the top 25 male and 25 female greatest screen legends of [[Cinema of the United States|American film history]]. The list was unveiled by the [[American Film Institute]] on June 15, 1999, in a [[CBS]] special hosted by [[Shirley Temple]], with 50 current actors making the presentations.

The American Film Institute defined an "American screen legend" as an actor or a team of actors during the [[Classical Hollywood cinema]] era with a significant screen presence in American feature-length (40 min or more) films whose screen debut occurred in or before 1950, or whose screen debut occurred after 1950, but whose death has marked a completed body of work.

The top stars of their respective gender are [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]]. They starred together in the classic adventure 1951 film ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'', for which Bogart won his only [[Academy Award]].

The '''''Apse of Santa María d'Àneu''''' is a romanesque [[apse]] of the church of [[Santa Maria, Àneu]], the transferred [[fresco]]s from which are now exhibited at [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]], in [[Barcelona]].
The decoration of the apse of the church of Santa María d’Àneu combines themes and motifs from the Old and [[New Testament]]s. Originally painted at the Church of Santa María d’Àneu (La Guingueta d’Àneu, [[Lleida]])&lt;ref name="MNAC"&gt;[http://www.spainisculture.com/en/obras_de_excelencia/museo_nacional_de_arte_de_cataluna_mnac/abside_santa_maria_aneu.html Comment on Apse of Santa María d'Àneu]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The church of Santa María d'Àneu is located in the upper valley of the Noguera Pallaresa, [[Pyrenees]] mountain region. The building once belonged to a Benedictine Monastery, it is divided into a [[nave]] and aisles by six pairs of piers, taking the shape of a cross. The east end concludes in three semicircular apses, the central apse was decorated with frescoes.&lt;ref name="Kuhn"&gt;Kuhn, Ch. L., Romanesque Mural Painting of Catalonia, Cambridge, 1930, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Maria in Àneu was the most important church in the Àneu Valley and belonged to the cathedral chapter of Urgell. From the stylistic circle of Pedret, of Lombardic influence, the decoration of the apse reveals the existence of an elaborate iconographic and theological programme setting off the prophetic hopes of the Old Testament—that is, hope in the coming of a Messiah who was to redeem humanity—against fulfillment of the prophecies—that is, the coming of the Messiah announced by the prophets.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;Post, Ch.R., A History of Spanish Painting, Cambridge, 1930, I, p. 136-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya dates the original work at the end of 11th century – beginning of 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=98d7f9bb3c2477d50327e48363fbd12d787959e035446012bc8afbd858e64243?inventoryNumber=015874-000 Technical Aspects from MNAC Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is speculation that the paintings were completed at the beginning of the 13th century at the time when Romanesque styles were breaking down and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] Art was coming of age.&lt;ref name="Kuhn" /&gt;

== Description ==
The iconography of the painting is suggestive of the Old Testament through the presence of the prophets in reverential attitudes. In the vault portion of the apse, the Epiphany or Adoration of the Magi is represented, with Mary, Jesus, and the three eastern kings baring gifts.  Wheels of fire from Jehovah’s chariot are depicted in the lower register, conforming to Ezekiel’s vision.&lt;ref name="Esteller"&gt;Esteller, E.,MNAC Romanesque Art Guide, Barcelona, 1998, p. 40-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  To the right and left are the [[archangels]] Michael and Gabriel holding banners and scrolls with the inscription PETICIVS and POSTVLATIVS.  Bordering the central window of the lower zones are two six-winged [[seraphim]], in their hands they hold live coals with tongs which they place in the mouths of two crouching figures. In the left lower zone, there are two tonsured (meaning scalp has been shaved) figures who might be Saints Benedict and Bernard or one of them might be a portrait of a local deacon on account of the realism in the face of the figure.&lt;ref name="Kuhn" /&gt;  The theory that these figures are patrons of the church is strengthened by the discovery of similar figures in related frescoes at the monastery of Saint Peter of [[Berga]].  The third archangel, [[Raphael]], does not appear with the others in the semidome but in the lower section.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;

At the bottom is the announcement, the biblical prophecy, represented by means of combined images of the visions of Isaiah and Ezequiel. In keeping with the first, two magnificent seraphim with three pairs of wings each purify the mouth of the
prophets with glowing embers which they are holding with tongs. Next to them are the prophets, represented with their hands together in an attitude of reverence.

At the same time, the seraphim intone the Trisagion, or song of praise to the Lord, represented by the letters SCS, SCS, SCS, which mean ‘holy, holy, holy’. From this moment, the word of the prophets will be the word of God. Beneath the central
window are the wheels of fire of Yahweh’s chariot, described in Ezequiel’s vision, which symbolise the presence of the Lord. On the vault was the Virgin and Child, representing the accomplishment of the prophecies, in the scene from Epiphany,
with two archangels, Michael and Gabriel, patrons of sinners, in a representation very similar to that in the apse from Santa Maria in Cap d'Aran (The Cloisters, New York). A third archangel, Raphael, is represented on the right of the semicylinder,
perhaps as the introducer of the two donor clergymen who appear on the left of the apse.

== Composition ==
The frescoes are attributed to the [[Circle of the Master of Pedret]].  The Master of Pedret was the first significant painter of the Catalon Romanesque period and is named for the wall paintings at the church of [[Southern apse from Pedret|San Quirze de Pedret]] in Berga.&lt;ref&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of Art (1993).  The Art of Medieval Spain (AD 500-1200), New York. Distributed by Harry N Abrams, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; The Apse at Aneu represents the end of a tradition, during this time the painter might have felt himself at liberty to relax old rules and abandon strict division into zones, therefore filling the bottom section not with lines of Apostles, but with less rigid elements of the prophetic vision.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;

== Analysis ==
The Àneu frescos make a complete break with the normal Catalan artistic scheme.  The lower zone is unique and unrelated to the upper portion of the apse.  The Byzantine influence appears to be strong in the style of the frescos, the seraphim have been noted to resemble those in the crypt at the cathedral of [[Anagni]], near Rome.  In addition there are touches of pure [[Realism (arts)|realism]], this is seen in the details such as the unshaven face of the figure at the left of the lower register and the thin and deeply wrinkled face of [[Magus]].&lt;ref name="Kuhn" /&gt;  The painting could represent direct borrowings from Byzantium or importations from Byzantine Art via [[Lombardy]], Italy.  This influence is shown in the costume of the Wise Men (or Maji) which is representative of the eastern court.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt; Other features linking the artwork to Italy are the decorative border, simulated drapery (they have waves and circular medallions), and the geometrical border is similar to the one in the Roman church of San Carlo in [[Prugiasco]] (Switzerland).&lt;ref name="Esteller" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6032">[[File:Roman Gothic Walls Romania Plain.svg|thumb|400px|right|Lower Trajan's Wall (Athanaric's Wall on the map) was located just north of the Danube delta]]
'''Athanaric's Wall''', also called '''Lower Trajan's Wall''' or '''Southern Trajan's Wall''', was a [[Defense line|fortification line]] probably erected by [[Athanaric]] (the king of the [[Thervingi]]), between the banks of river [[Gerasius]] (modern [[Prut]]) and the [[Danube]] to the land of [[Taifali]] (modern [[Oltenia]]). Most probably, Athanaric's Wall has reused the old Roman ''[[limes]]'' called [[Limes Transalutanus]].&lt;ref&gt;The Goths By Peter Heather page 100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

Historian [[Theodore Mommsen]] wrote that [[Roman Empire|Romans]] built a defensive wall from the Danube delta to [[Tyras]]. He wrote:
   
{{Quote|''The Walls, which, three metres in height and two meters in thickness, with broad outer fosse and many remains of forts, stretch in two almost parallel lines ... from the Pruth to the Dniester ... may be also Roman''.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Mommsen. ''The Provinces of the Roman Empire''. p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
[[File:Cahul Ismail si Bolgrad.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Old Russian map showing clearly the Lower Trajan Wall (in green color)]]	
The structure is made of earthen walls and [[palisade]]s, with an elevation of only three meters (which is mostly eroded away).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geografi.nu/region.php?var1=moldavien_27_3_864978_Ozero%20Drachele_-42092311.jpg_42092311_2402668_500_375_rotameo_Le%20mur%20de%20Trajan%20vers%20l%5C'est Photo of the Wall near Vadul lui Isac]&lt;/ref&gt;

It stretches from Romania [[Buciumeni, Galați|Buciumeni]]-Tiganesti-Tapu to [[Stoicani]] and after that it enters Moldova. In southern Moldova, it stretches another 126&amp;nbsp;km from the village of [[Vadul lui Isac]] in the [[Cahul District]] by the [[Prut River]], and then goes into Ukraine ending at [[Sasyk Lagoon|Lake Sasyk]] by [[Tatarbunary|Tatarbunar]].

Some historians think that the southern Trajan Wall reached the city of Tyras, when was annexed by emperor [[Nero]].&lt;ref&gt;Isaak Klejman. Defensive structures on the Territory of Tyras&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, a Roman bronze coin was found during excavations that discovered evidences of the original construction in the first century&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospect.md/en/history/historic-areas-parks/troyan-mounds.html Trajan walls]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Cahul]] ''[[uyezd]]'' of [[Bessarabia]], [[Russian Empire]], incorporated the image of "Trajan's Wall".

==Historical debate==

Some academics such as Dorel Bondoc think that the wall was built by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], because it required a great deal of knowledge and a workforce that barbarians like Athanaric did not have.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apar.archaeology.ro/bondoc.htm "Problema Valurilor": Roman Walls in Moldova (in Romanian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bondoc wrote that "''[The Wall's] huge size means the need of considerable material and human resources, a condition that could be met only by the Roman Empire ... the period of time when it was built stretched from [[Constantine the Great]] to [[Valentinian I]] and [[Valens]]"''.
[[File:Roman provinces of Illyricum, Macedonia, Dacia, Moesia, Pannonia and Thracia.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of Roman provinces from the Lower Danube showing The Vallum. Old historical map from Droysens Historical Atlas, 1886]]

Some scholars, like Vasile Nedelciuc,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.compudavafoundation.org/moldova/history/ancient.html |title=Nedelciuc: Roman walls from the Pruth to Bender/Tighina |access-date=2015-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001041153/http://www.compudavafoundation.org/moldova/history/ancient.html |archive-date=2011-10-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the turf Wall was built initially by the Romans during [[Nero]] rule from the Prut river to Tyras, even because it has a ditch facing north. He argues that later it was enlarged by Athanaric, but only until Sasyk lagoon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11420">The Commonwealth of [[Australia]]'s ''Designs Act 2003'' replaced the ''Designs Act 1906''. The legislation assists in the protection of the overall appearance of a product resulting from one or more visual features of the product. Although there are some overlaps, the Designs Act is not applicable when defending the functional [[innovation]]s of a product. In [[common law]], ''Firmagroup Australia Pty Ltd v Byrne &amp; Davidson Doors'' (1987) 180 CLR 483, supports this. Firmagroup Australia Pty registered a design for a ‘combination handle and lock for shutter doors’. The innovative product was copied by Byrne &amp; Davidson, and Firmagroup sued for infringement on design. The High Court held that the ‘combination handle and lock for shutter doors’ was ‘an idea of shape or configuration’, which is ‘conveyed by those features’, was ‘too general to attract statutory protection’. The Court then restricted the [[monopoly]] to the specific, individual appearance. Further, it added that ‘No design should be so construed as to give to its proprietor a monopoly in a method or principle of construction.’&lt;ref&gt;''Firmagroup Australia Pty Ltd v Byrne &amp; Davidson Doors'' (1987) 180 CLR 483.&lt;/ref&gt; The defendant proved to distinguish his product adequately, and thus did not infringe on Firmagroup’s design.

==Definition of a design==
Under the legislation, a design, in relation to a product, means the overall appearance of the product resulting from one or more visual features of the product.&lt;ref name="Designs Act 2003 Cth s5"&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s5.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the design is only a design, for the purposes of the Designs Act, when it is used in relation to the registered product.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s8.&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrates that the registration of the design does not protect the business against the same design being used on other products; the pattern itself cannot be registered.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, M., J., Monotti, A., L., Wiseman, L., (2008) Australian Intellectual Property Law, New York, USA, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the act covers both, two-dimensional designs&lt;ref name="Designs Act 2003 Cth s63"&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s6(3).&lt;/ref&gt; (such as a logo on a cup), and three-dimensional designs&lt;ref name="Designs Act 2003 Cth s63"/&gt; (such as the shape of the cup). Furthermore, Dixon J, in ''Macrae Knitting Mills Ltd v Lowes Ltd'' (1936) 55 CLR 725, confirms that ‘The Act is concerned with shape and configuration, not function’. The Act, stipulates that a visual feature may, but need not, serve a functional purpose.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s7 (2).&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the design’s every visual feature serves a functional purpose, then common law states that the design is not registrable.&lt;ref&gt;W. van caenegem (2006), Intellectual Property (2nd ed), Sydney, [[LexisNexis]] Butterworths; Dart Industries Inc v Décor Corp Pty Ltd (1989) 15 IPR 403 408: ‘if the shape exists solely to make the article work or function then it is not within the concept of a registered design’. Cited with approval in Phillips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 39 IPR 283, 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the Designs Act states that should an innovation be both, a visual feature, and serve a functional purpose, there is nothing to stop the design being registered.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s7(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In common law, ''British Franco Electric Pty Ltd v Dowling Plastics Pty Ltd'' [1981] NSWLR 448, reinforces the view the courts take on the distinction between a function and a design. In the case, both companies entered into a business selling and manufacturing furniture castors. Dowling Plastics developed the castor, and British Franco registered the design. Soon after the joint venture broke up, Dowling Plastics continued the production of the castors. However, British Franco claimed that Dowling Plastics were infringing on British Franco’s [[Industrial design rights|registered design]]. Dowling put forth an argument questioning the validity of the registration of the design, as the only novel feature of the castor served a functional purpose, and when the castor is assembled, the design would not be seen. The court held in favour of Dowling, however, they were not persuaded by the business’s argument, ruling that the functional purpose of the article is irrelevant, when the design does not satisfy other requirements for registration.

==Definition of a ‘product’==
The act outlines, that a product is a thing that is manufactured or handmade.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s6 (1)&lt;/ref&gt; Further, even if a component part of a product is made separately from the product itself, for the purposes of the Designs Act, it is still a product.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s6(2)&lt;/ref&gt; Even a kit made for assembly of a particular product, is that product.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s6(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

When the issue came to designs that vary in their dimensions (such as roof guttering), the items are still considered products, as long as following conditions apply:
* a) A cross-section taken across any indefinite dimension is fixed or varies according to a regular pattern;
* b) All the dimensions remain in proportion
* c) The cross-sectional shape remains the same throughout, whether or not the dimensions of that shape vary according to a ratio or series of ratios;
* d) It has a pattern or ornamentation that repeats itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s6 (3).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction between the design and the product==
One of the deep-seated aspects of the Designs Act is the distinction between the idea of a product, and the design relating to that product. Thus, the designs act will not grant a monopoly to a business attempting to register a fundamental or essential form of a product.
This is supported by common law, in ''Dalgety Australia Operations Ltd v Seeley Nominees Pty Ltd'' (1985) 5 IPR 97, when the High Court held that the Designs Act does not give a monopoly to the trading of the article to which it is applied. For example, without a design, a chair would still be a chair, a fork would still be a fork, etc.… Bollen, J, further clarified that &lt;blockquote&gt;
a design
turns a chair into something more than a mere chair. It becomes a chair with a conception or suggestion about shape or configuration beyond the fundamental form of a chair
&lt;/blockquote&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''Dalgety Australia Operations Ltd v Seeley Nominees Pty Ltd'' (1985) 5 IPR 97&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, the case established that a fundamental form cannot be registered as a design.

==Component and spare parts==
The Designs Act also caters for components and spare parts of a product. The Act provides a monopoly for a component part of a product, which it deems to be a product for the purposes of the act.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth)s7(2).&lt;/ref&gt;
However, The Designs Act does not provide clarity when the issue is regarding a fundamental nature of components and spare parts. It is deep-seated in legislation and common law, that if a product is a fundamental form or shape of a product, then the product cannot be registrable. Although the spare part is purely manufactured for the purpose of attaching to its larger counterpart, it is not clear if that is seen, by legislation and common law, as being dictated by a functional purpose. Further, in most cases, the designer of the spare part also had a number of potential shapes to choose from, thus the spare part cannot be the fundamental form, thus rendering the product registrable.

==When is a design registrable?==
The design is registrable if it fits the following characteristics:
* a) The design is new
* b) The design is distinctive when compared to the [[prior art]] base for the design as it existed before the priority date of the design &lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design rights==
After registration, the owner of the registered design owns a renewable monopoly for 5 years, and has the [[exclusive right]]s to :
* a) To make or offer to make a product, in relation to which the design is registered, which embodies the design; and
* b) To import such a product into Australia for sale, or for use for the purposes of any trade or business; and
* c) To sell, hire and otherwise dispose of, or offer to sell, hire or otherwise deispose of, such a product; and
* d) To use such a product in any way for the purpose of any trade or business; and
* e) To keep such a product for the purpose of doing any of the things mentioned in paragraph (c) or (d)
* f) To authorize another person to do any of the things mentioned in paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e)&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth)s10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infringement of designs==
A person infringes a registered design if, during the term of registration of the design, and without the licence or authority of the registered owner of the design, the person:
* (a) makes or offers to make a product, in relation to which the design is registered, which embodies a design that is identical to, or substantially similar in overall impression to, the registered design; or
* (b) imports such a product into Australia for sale, or for use for the purposes of any trade or business; or
* (c) sells, hires or otherwise disposes of, or offers to sell, hire or otherwise dispose of, such a product; or
* (d) uses such a product in any way for the purposes of any trade or business; or
* (e) keeps such a product for the purpose of doing any of the things mentioned in paragraph (c) or (d)&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth)s71(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identical or substantially similar in overall impression==
In subsection (a), the section mentions a design that is identical to, or substantially similar in overall impression. While the test for the design being identical is uncomplicated, to determine whether the design is substantially similar in overall impression and how it is substantially similar, the act refers to s19. The section stipulates that the court pay more attention to the similarities rather than the differences, must have regard for prior art base, and contextualize a certain part of the design that is similar, in relation to the whole design. The court must then apply the standard of a person who is familiar with the product to which the design relates, or products similar to the product to which the design relates.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s19.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Act does not require any party to establish that the registered design was copied, the mere registration of the design, protects against independent creation.

==Defences==
If the defendant is repairing a complex product that has at least two replaceable component parts, permitting disassembly and re-assembly,&lt;ref name="Designs Act 2003 Cth s5"/&gt; then they may claim a defence under s72 of the Act, on the condition that the repair is for the purpose of restoring the complex products’ overall appearance.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s72.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the [[Legal burden of proof|onus of proof]] is on the plaintiff to prove that the defendant knew, or ought reasonably to have known that the use of authorisation was not for the permitted purpose.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s72(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cairn of Barnenez''' (also: '''Barnenez Tumulus''', '''Barnenez Mound''' etc.; in [[Breton language|Breton]] ''Karn Barnenez''; in [[French language|French]]: ''Cairn de Barnenez'' or ''Tumulus de Barnenez'') is a [[Neolithic]] monument located near [[Plouezoc'h]], on the Kernéléhen peninsula in northern [[Finistère]], [[Brittany]] ([[France]]). It dates to the early [[Neolithic]], about 4800 BC; it is considered one of the earliest [[megaliths|megalithic monuments]] in [[Europe]], as well as one of the [[Oldest buildings in the world#By age|oldest man-made structures in the world]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/galleries/The-worlds-10-oldest-ruins/ruinsu-barnenez-c1/|title=The world's 10 oldest ruins|accessdate=2016-06-29 |work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;
along with the [[Tumulus of Bougon]] and [[Locmariaquer megaliths]], also located in Great West France. It is also remarkable for the presence of [[megalithic art]].

==History==
[[File:Detail Tumulus Barnenez.jpg|thumb|One of the chambers, exposed by 20th century quarrying.]]
[[File:Barnenez cairn.jpg|thumb|Artistic reconstruction of the cairn c. 4000 BC.]]

===Dates===
[[Radiocarbon dating|Radiocarbon]] dates indicate that the first phase of the monument was erected between 4850 and 4250 BC, and the second phase between 4450 and 4000 BC.

===Secondary use===
Pottery found in and around the monument indicates that it underwent a period of reuse in the [[Bronze Age]], in the 3rd millennium BC.

===Recognition as an ancient monument===
The cairn was first mapped in 1807, in the context of the [[Napoleon]]ic [[cadaster]]. Its first scientific recognition took place in the context of an academic congress in Morlaix in 1850, when it was classified as a [[tumulus]].

===Quarry damage===
Privately owned until the 1950s, the cairn was used as a [[quarry]] for paving stones. This activity, which threatened to destroy the monument, was only halted after the discovery of several of its chambers in the 1950s. The local community then took control of the site.

===Restoration and excavation===
The cairn was restored between 1954 and 1968. At the same time, vegetation was removed from the mound and systematic [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] took place in and around the monument.

==The monument==
[[File:Barnenez entrance.jpg|thumb|right|One of the passages.]]

===The mound===
[[File:Cairn de Barnenez.JPG|thumb|The Cairn of Barnenez]]
Today, the Barnenez cairn is 72 m long, up to 25 m wide and over 8 m high. It is built of 13,000 to 14,000 tons of stone. It contains 11 chambers entered by separate passages. The mound has steep facades and a [[stepped profile]]. Several internal walls either represent earlier facades or served the stability of the structure. The cairn consists of relatively small blocks of stone, with only the chambers being truly megalithic in character.
The monument overlooks the Bay of [[Morlaix]], probably a fertile coastal plain at the time of its erection.
[[File:Barnenez plan.JPG|thumb|left|275px|Simplified plan. Cairn 1 marked in yellow, Cairn 2 in green.]]

===Construction phases===
The monument is the result of at least two phases of building.

====Cairn 1, before 4500 BC====
In a first phase, a slightly trapezoidal mound of 32 m by 9 to 13 m was erected. It contained 5 chambers and was surrounded by a double kerb. The first phase favoured the use of [[dolerite]].

====Cairn 2, c. 4200 – c. 3900 BC====
In a second phase, an extension with six further chambers was added in the west. At the same time, Cairn 1 was enveloped in a wider and taller structure; its passages had to be extended. More [[granite]] was used in this phase.

===The chambers===

The 11 chambers of the Barnenez cairn are of the type known as ''[[Dolmen]] à couloir'' in French archaeological terminology. The term translates roughly as "[[passage grave]]". They are built of large slabs of [[slate]] and [[granite]]. Originally, all the chambers were entirely enclosed by the mound. The fact that several of them are partially exposed now is the result of modern quarrying.

Each of the 11 chambers is reached from the southeast via a long narrow passage (7–12 m long). They are arranged parallel to each other. Shapes and construction techniques differ slightly.
 
In nine cases, narrow passages lead to [[corbelling|corbelled]] chambers. Normally, the corbel vault rests on orthostats, in one chamber it actually sits on the ground, forming a true ''[[Beehive tomb|tholos]]''. The passages have slab-built or [[dry stone wall]]s and are covered with slabs. One of the chambers has a dry-stone vaulted ante-chamber.

[[File:Barnenez symbols.png|thumb|right|Examples of the carved symbols.]]

=== Logistics ===
One cubic metre of the Barnenez cairn contains 1,500&amp;nbsp;kg of stone. It is estimated that the quarrying, fashioning, transport and construction of such an amount represents about four work days for a single worker (assuming a 10-hour day). The original monument, Cairn 1, had a volume of about 2,000 cubic metres; it is built of 1,000 tons of granite and 3,000 tons of dolerite. It would thus have required 15,000 to 20,000 working days; in other words, it would have taken 200 workers three months to erect Cairn 1 alone. In its final form, the Barnenez mound is nearly three times as big as the first phase.

[[File:Dolmengöttin von Barnenez.jpg|thumb|left|Reproduction of the "Dolmen Goddess" of Barnenez.]]

===Engraved symbols===
Engraved symbols occur in several of the chambers and passages. They depict bows, axes, wave symbols or snakes and a repeated U-shaped sign. One of the carved slabs is in secondary use was originally part of a different structure, an interesting parallel to the situation in several other such monuments, including [[Gavrinis]]. 
The symbols on the engraved blocks resemble those found in other megalithic monuments in Brittany; in broader terms they belong to the cultural phenomenon described as [[megalithic art]]. One of the recurring symbols is sometimes interpreted as an [[anthropomorphic]] depiction (the so-called "Dolmen Goddess").

===Finds===

====Material from the original period of use====
Only Cairn 2, namely chambers A, C and D, contained [[Neolithic]] finds at the time of excavation. They included pottery, polished stone axes (of [[dolerite]]), [[flint]] blades and arrowheads.

====Bronze Age pottery====
Pottery shards found outside the monument indicate that it was reused in the [[Bronze Age]] (3rd millennium BC). A copper dagger and a barbed arrowhead are of [[Chalcolithic]] date.

==Comparable monuments==
Similar, possibly contemporary, monuments are known at 22 other locations in France and on [[Jersey]]. Breton examples are Larcuste-Colpo, Le Bono, Petit Mont, Ty-Floc´h, [[Gavrinis]], Île Carn, Ploudalmézeau and Guennoc (I´ile Gaignoc – sometimes spelt Guénioc) off the shore at [[Landéda]]. Those located on islands are generally better preserved. Chamber 3 B at Guennoc contains a small [[standing stone]] near the entrance.

==Exhibition==
An exhibition in the modern entrance building explains the results of scientific excavation and displays some objects from the site.

'''''Basodee: An Anthology Dedicated to Black Youth''''' (2012), edited by Fiona Raye Clarke, is a youth-created and youth-centred anthology created by a Black writing collective in honour of [[Black History Month]], and authentic diversity in Canada. It highlights the [[Black Canadian]] experience and to promote awareness about the complexities of contemporary Black youth experience in [[Ontario Canada|Ontario]].

The book consists of a foreword by the President of the Ontario Black History Society, Rosemary Sadlier, [[OOnt]] and work by various youth on issues of identity, belonging, and Canadian Black History.

The anthology was created in partnership with the Office of the Provincial Advocate of Children and Youth in Ontario a commission of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] which puts youth at its centre and uses rights to improve the lives and conditions of youth in systems of care in Ontario. The anthology was started in January 2012 and was published by General Store Publishing House in July 2012.

The title "Basodee" comes from the Trinidadian creole word of the same name meaning "half-conscious" and "disoriented." The term was chosen as the title of the book to express the confusion and identity crisis of Black Canadian youth.

The book consists of photography, essays, short stories and poetry by 13 youth expressing what it is to be young, Black and Canadian. Many are immigrants to the country or first-generation Canadians. Some have had experience with the mental health or criminal justice system and some are in care. Each shares their personal stories and views on what it means to be Black and Canadian today.

''Basodee'' makes its debut at a time when concern about escalating gun violence in the City of Toronto such as the shooting at the [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] on June 2, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/1205036--shooting-reported-at-eaton-centre |title=One dead, seven injured in Eaton Centre shooting |publisher=thestar.com |date= 2012-06-03|accessdate=2012-09-27 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] on July 16, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=07/17/2012 12:01 am Updated: 07/20/2012 12:44 pm |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/07/17/shyanne-charles-joshua-yasay-danzig-shooting-_n_1678359.html |title=Shyanne Charles, Joshua Yasay, Identified As Victims Killed In Toronto Block Party Shooting (PHOTOS) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; has resulted in statements by Toronto Mayor [[Rob Ford]] that he wishes to force individuals convicted of a gun charge out of the city and more money from the province during a 'gun summit' for "anti-crime" initiatives such as the Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy (TAVIS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/tavis |title=Toronto Police Service :: To Serve and Protect |publisher=Torontopolice.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which places increased police presence in priority neighbourhoods.

In response to the July 16 shooting, the Toronto Star published a cartoon by Michael de Adder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadder.net |title=Home |publisher=de Adder |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; cartoon depicting a little black girl's alleged "expected" injuries before the age of two -"boo boo from highchair, mark from tricycle, and head laceration from a medium-caliber bullet."  After numerous complaints the Star apologized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/corrections/article/1230430—apology|title=Apology|publisher=Thestar.com|accessdate=2012-09-27|location=Toronto|date=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the cartoon's insensitivity to the complex issues at play in gun violence. It is media sanctioned expressions of negative stereotypes like these that ''Basodee'' tries to fight, using the voices of many of the youth these stereotypes and top-down solutions attempt to silence.

When many expressions of a voice other than the mainstream Canadian voice are being squelched and co-opted, such as ''Sway Magazine''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swaymag.ca |title=Sway Magazine |publisher=Swaymag.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Caribana]] due to economic considerations and a clear climate of devaluation of diversity, the Basodee collective comes together to bring true diversity back to the Canadian cultural milieu and show youth commitment to celebrations such as [[Black History Month]], which are  often seen as outdated and unnecessary in a post-racial "multicultural" society such as Toronto. Michael de Adder and Rob Ford's comments and many of the pieces in ''Basodee'', however, prove that Toronto is very much a race conscious city and is no where near embracing multiculturalism as many have been publicly threatened by the chief city official with exile.

==Major themes==
Some of the major themes in ''Basodee'' include identity, struggle and belonging. The book argues that part of the "basodeeness" of Black youth stems from "mis-education" about their history. The term "mis-education" is borrowed from [[Carter G. Woodson]]'s book [[The Mis-Education of the Negro]]. ''Basodee'' contains essays outlining the history of discrimination  in the Canadian education system against Blacks and the present struggle for solutions to this ongoing discrimination such as the establishment of the Africentric Alternative School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2009/09/08/africentric-alternative-school.html |title=Africentric school opens in Toronto - Toronto - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also contains an essay tracing a history of Canadian human rights abuses against Blacks extending into the present day. ''Basodee'' argues that this history which is seldom spoken about form a major part of Black youth's basodeness. When many Black youth feel that dropping out of school and turning to a life of crime are the only way to protect themselves from discrimination and secure against mainstream attempts to erode their identity.

Given this real struggle of Black youth to safeguard their identity, the main thesis of ''Basodee'' is that Black youth in Canada have not been given a place of belonging in Canadian society, despite being here for generations and even since the time of slavery. Thus, the book presents examples from its contributors of how to find that identity – such as remembering where you came from, the struggles you have gone through, and undergoing [[negrescence]].

==Purpose==
The collective hopes that ''Basodee'' will one day become a resource to Black youth struggling to find themselves in the midst of media stereotypes, threats of exile, and stigmatization. In partnering with the Office of the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth, the collective hopes to get the book in the hands of youth in the system who need the ideas it explores the most – Crown wards, youth in detention centres, and youth in care. The collective is currently looking for more organizations that work with Black youth as part of their mandate to share the book and also partner with in the future.

'''Bilibo''' is a "[[Seashell|shell]]-shaped, hard-wearing piece of [[plastic]]" used as a [[toy]].&lt;ref name="indep"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/50-great-ideas-for-the-21st-century-410543.html | title=50 great ideas for the 21st century | work=[[The Independent]] | date=6 August 2006 | accessdate=30 September 2008 | author=Davis, Johnny | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080923182447/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/50-great-ideas-for-the-21st-century-410543.html| archivedate= 23 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced in six different colors. It was developed in 2001 by Swiss designer Alex Hochstrasser in consultation with experts for [[child development]].

The form has been designed for children of various ages to sit comfortably in the shell whilst controlling their movements by touching the ground with their hands and feet.

According to a child's age and interests Bilibo is used as an accessory for [[Roleplay|role-]] and [[fantasy]]-play, it can be filled with objects, sand or water and emptied again or stacked. Rocking, spinning and balancing in or on the shell helps develop [[motor skills]] and the child's sense of balance.
The shells are also used in [[physiotherapy]] to stimulate the [[Vestibular system|vestibular]] and [[Proprioception|proprioceptive]] systems.&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bilibo.com/en/playing/ | title=Kids' play | publisher=Moluk | work=Bilibo | accessdate=18 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children on ''[[Richard &amp; Judy]]'' could generally be seen to prefer [[cardboard box]]es to the Bilibo, and confirmed this preference when asked.&lt;ref name="r&amp;j"&gt;{{cite episode | title=Friday 14th July | series=[[Richard and Judy]] | network=[[Channel 4]] | airdate=14 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Black America''''' is an upcoming [[alternative history]] [[television drama]] that imagines a nation-state formed by [[African-Americans]] called New Colonia after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] as [[Reparations for slavery debate in the United States|reparations for slavery]]. The show is a collaboration between producer [[Will Packer]] and ''[[The Boondocks (comic strip)|The Boondocks]]'' creator [[Aaron McGruder]] for [[Amazon Video]]. McGruder is writing screenplays for the series, which has been under development for over a year as of August 2017.&lt;ref name="NYT 8-1-17"&gt;{{cite news|author=Victor, Daniel|title=Amazon Series Imagines a New South|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 2, 2017|page=C3|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/arts/television/amazon-black-america-confederate.html|accessdate=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deadline 8-1-17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/08/black-america-amazon-alt-history-drama-will-packer-aaron-mcgruder-envisions-post-reparations-america-1202139504/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |title='Black America': Amazon Alt-History Drama From Will Packer &amp; Aaron McGruder Envisions Post-Reparations America |date=August 1, 2017 |accessdate=August 3, 2017 |author=Andreeva, Nellie |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Celtic Tiger Live''''' or more often known '''''Michael Flatley's Celtic Tiger''''' or just '''''Celtic Tiger''''' was an [[Irish dance]] show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/article-2991839/Michael-Flatley-s-taking-final-bow.html Daily Mail]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
[[Michael Flatley]], known for [[Riverdance]], [[Lord of the Dance (musical)|Lord of the Dance]] and [[Feet of Flames]], created ''Celtic Tiger'' which debuted in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelflatley.com/about/ Biography of Michael Flatley from his website]&lt;/ref&gt; After being retired for four years{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, Flatley  announced he was going to tour with a new show. In the summer of 2004 Flatley started the rehearsals of a new show in the SFX Theatre in [[Dublin]], Ireland{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. In the autumn of 2004 the rehearsals moved on in the Shepperton Studios in London{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. Michael tried his best to keep the details including the name of the show a secret{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. Michael announced on his website in April 2005 that he was going to have a preview show of his new show Celtic Tiger in June 2005{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}.

''Celtic Tiger'' had its first performance at a private, invitation-only performance at the NIA Birmingham, England on 17 June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celticcafe.com/celticcafe/Dance/MichaelFlatley/CelticTiger/01_TigerOnTour.html Celtic Cafe]&lt;/ref&gt;  The show was first performed for the public on 9 July 2005 in the [[Stadium Puskás Ferenc|Puskás Stadion]] (formerly the Népstadion) in [[Budapest]], Hungary. Another preview show was planned for [[Prague]] in the [[Czech Republic]], but at the last minute that show was cancelled due to the venue (which included a massive stage specially built for the show) was unsafe for the dancers.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The next show, a preview show for the US tour, was held in Worcester, Massachusetts, on 24 September 2005, followed by a gala performance in New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]] on 27 September 2005, the show's official US premiere. The show then toured through Canada and sections of the US, with the final 2005 performance at the Patriot Center in Fairfax, Virginia on 26 November 2005.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

''Celtic Tiger'' started its European World Tour on 20 April 2006 at the Point Theatre in Dublin. That show was the first time Flatley had danced in the [[Point Theatre]] since he debuted ''Lord of the Dance''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} On 15 November 2006, the Autumn and Winter tours for the ''Celtic Tiger'' tour of Europe and Asia were cancelled when Flatley was hospitalised for a viral infection for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/seriously-ill-flatley-forced-to-cancel-celtic-tiger-tour-26355644.html Irish Independent]&lt;/ref&gt; Flatley claimed in his website that he would release future touring dates in early 2007 but never did{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}.

==Meaning==
In the press release announcing the European preview of the show, Michael Flatley explained '''Celtic Tiger'' portrays the oppression of a people and the tiger symbolises the awakening of their Spirit and their struggle for freedom. ''Celtic Tiger'' is my finest work to date. Budapest is one of my favourite cities in the world and I can think of no greater place to preview my new show." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celticcafe.com/archive/Shows/Celtic_Tiger/old/index.htm Celtic Cafe]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''China Gate''''' is a 1957 [[Hollywood]] [[CinemaScope]] [[war film]] written, produced and directed by [[Samuel Fuller]] and released through [[20th Century Fox]].

==Plot==
Sergeant Brock ([[Gene Barry]]) and Goldie ([[Nat King Cole]]) are American [[Korean War]] veterans now serving as [[French Foreign Legion]] mercenaries in the [[First Indochina War]]. Brock's wife, a "half caste" Chinese [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] named "Lucky Legs" ([[Angie Dickinson]]) who resorts to smuggling to feed her five-year-old son ([[Warren Hsieh]]) she had with Brock. Brock abandoned her and the baby when he was born with Asian features, feeling a "half breed" would not be welcome in America; an attitude towards miscegenation prevalent at the time. Lucky is recruited by the French high command to use her expert knowledge of the area and her friendship with the communist Major Cham ([[Lee Van Cleef]]) to get a demolition squad of Legionnaires led by Brock to a vital hidden [[Viet Minh]] ammunition dump on the border with [[People's Republic of China|Red China]]. In return for her services, Lucky is promised by the French that they will arrange for her son's emigration to America.

The raid is filled with animosity between the former lovers, booby traps, and enemy patrols.  On arrival at the ammunition dump hidden in a mountain, Lucky discovers the commanding officer is her former friend Major Cham, who wants to take her and her son to a new life in [[Moscow]]. Cham is a high flyer corporate executive (in the manner of Fuller's gangsters in ''[[Underworld USA]]'')  marked for great things in the world of international [[communism]]. The sabotage mission is successful but at great cost; Lucky dies blowing up the dump. Brock reconciles with his child and is last seen walking along holding his hand in preparation for returning to America, as Goldie reprises the title song.

==Production==
Fuller selected singer Cole after being impressed with his face on a record [[album cover]].  Though [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] said Cole received more money in a few weeks than the entire budget of the film, Fuller arranged to meet Cole. Cole and his wife were interested in Goldie as an opposite to the racist Brock and agreed to work at a minimum salary. ''China Gate'' was the last score [[Victor Young]] composed; the film was finished by his friend [[Max Steiner]]. [[Harold Adamson]] wrote lyrics to Young's beautiful theme for the film.  Though originally not intending to sing in the film, Cole sang ''China Gate'' as he walked through a bombed out village followed by Brock's little son, making it a memorable tune and a fitting tribute to Young.

An actual [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] actress playing a [[love interest]] opposite a white European star was a rarity in [[Hollywood]] at the time. Dickinson proves attractive to Brock, and to mainstream audiences of the time. Her character is allowed to express Fuller's view on [[race relations]] and is respected both by the French military and by a local [[priest]] whose life she had saved. (The character takes a role similar to Fuller's [[prostitute]] [[protagonist]]s in ''[[Pickup on South Street]]'' and ''[[The Naked Kiss]]''). The dangerous [[patrol]] allows for a gradual change of heart for Brock.

==Banned in France==
Before ''China Gate'' was to be released, Fuller received a call from the French [[Consul-General]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Romain Gary]], inviting him to lunch. Gary said the film's prologue was too harsh towards France and asked Fuller to change it. Fuller refused, but the two became firm friends with similar interests. The film was never released in France.

Many years later, Fuller filmed a story of Gary's, ''[[White Dog]]'' (1982), that Fuller and [[Curtis Hanson]] adapted for the screen.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Samuel. ''A Third Face'', Alfred A Knopf, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video releases==
''China Gate'' was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc by Mongrel Media on March 26, 2013.

A '''color model''' is an abstract mathematical model describing the way [[color]]s can be represented as [[tuple]]s of numbers, typically as three or four values or color components. When this model is associated with a precise description of how the components are to be interpreted (viewing conditions, etc.), the resulting set of colors is called "[[color space]]." This section describes ways in which human [[color vision]] can be modeled.

== Tristimulus color space ==

[[File:gamut full.png|thumb|right|3D representation of the human color space.]]

One can picture this space as a region in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] if one identifies the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' axes with the stimuli for the long-wavelength (''L''), medium-wavelength (''M''), and short-wavelength (''S'') [[Cone cell|light receptors]]. The origin, (''S'',''M'',''L'') = (0,0,0), corresponds to black.  White has no definite position in this diagram; rather it is defined according to the [[color temperature]] or white balance as desired or as available from ambient lighting. The human color space is a horse-shoe-shaped cone such as shown here (see also [[Color_models#CIE_XYZ_color_space|CIE chromaticity diagram]] below), extending from the origin to, in principle, infinity. In practice, the human color receptors will be saturated or even be damaged at extremely high light intensities, but such behavior is not part of the [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] color space and neither is the changing color perception at low light levels (see: [[Kruithof curve]]). 
The most saturated colors are located at the outer rim of the region, with brighter colors farther removed from the origin. As far as the responses of the receptors in the eye are concerned, there is no such thing as "brown" or "gray" light. The latter color names refer to orange and white light respectively, with an intensity that is lower than the light from surrounding areas. One can observe this by watching the screen of an [[overhead projector]] during a meeting: one sees black lettering on a white background, even though the "black" has in fact not become darker than the white screen on which it is projected before the projector was turned on.  The "black" areas have not actually become darker but appear "black" relative to the higher intensity "white" projected onto the screen around it. See also [[color constancy]].

The human tristimulus space has the property that additive mixing of colors corresponds to the adding of vectors in this space. This makes it easy to, for example, describe the possible colors ([[gamut]]) that can be constructed from the red, green, and blue primaries in a computer display.

== CIE XYZ color space ==
{{main article|CIE 1931 color space}}
[[Image:CIE 1931 XYZ Color Matching Functions.svg|thumb|325px|right|[http://www.cie.co.at/framepublications.html CIE] 1931 Standard Colorimetric Observer functions between 380 nm and 780 nm (at 5 nm intervals).]]

One of the first mathematically defined color spaces is the CIE XYZ color space (also known as CIE 1931 color space), created by the [[International Commission on Illumination]] in 1931. These data were measured for human observers and a 2-degree field of view. In 1964, supplemental data for a 10-degree field of view were published.

Note that the tabulated sensitivity curves have a certain amount of arbitrariness in them. The shapes of the individual X, Y and Z sensitivity curves can be measured with a reasonable accuracy. However, the overall [[luminosity function]] (which in fact is a weighted sum of these three curves) is subjective, since it involves asking a test person whether two light sources have the same brightness, even if they are in completely different colors. Along the same lines, the relative magnitudes of the X, Y, and Z curves are arbitrarily chosen to produce equal areas under the curves. One could as well define a valid color space with an X sensitivity curve that has twice the amplitude. This new color space would have a different shape. The sensitivity curves in the CIE 1931 and 1964 xyz color space are scaled to have equal areas under the curves.

Sometimes XYZ colors are represented by the luminance, Y, and chromaticity coordinates ''x'' and ''y'', defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{X}{X + Y + Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{Y}{X + Y + Z}&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematically, ''x'' and ''y'' are projective coordinates and the colors of the chromaticity diagram occupy a region of the [[projective plane|real projective plane]]. Because the CIE sensitivity curves have equal areas under the curves, light with a flat energy spectrum corresponds to the point (''x'',''y'') = (0.333,0.333).

The values for ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' are obtained by integrating the product of the spectrum of a light beam and the published color-matching functions.

==Additive and subtractive color models==

=== RGB color model ===

{{main|RGB color model}}
[[File:RGBCube a.svg|179px|thumb]]

Media that transmit light (such as television) use [[additive color]] mixing with [[primary color]]s of [[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]], each of which stimulates one of the three types of the eye's color receptors with as little stimulation as possible of the other two. This is called "[[RGB]]" color space. Mixtures of light of these primary colors cover a large part of the human color space and thus produce a large part of human color experiences. This is why [[color television]] sets or color computer monitors need only produce mixtures of red, green and blue light. See [[Additive color]].

Other primary colors could in principle be used, but with red, green and blue the largest portion of the [[human color space]] can be captured. Unfortunately there is no exact consensus as to what loci in the [[chromaticity diagram]] the red, green, and blue colors should have, so the same RGB values can give rise to slightly different colors on different screens.

=== CMYK color model ===

{{main|CMYK color model}}

It is possible to achieve a large range of colors seen by humans by combining [[cyan]], [[magenta]], and [[yellow]] transparent dyes/inks on a white substrate. These are the ''[[subtractive color|subtractive]]'' [[primary color]]s. Often a fourth ink, [[black]], is added to improve reproduction of some dark colors. This is called the "CMY" or "CMYK" color space.

The cyan ink absorbs red light but transmits green and blue, the magenta ink absorbs green light but transmits red and blue, and the yellow ink absorbs blue light but transmits red and green. The white substrate reflects the transmitted light back to the viewer. Because in practice the CMY inks suitable for printing also reflect a little bit of color, making a deep and neutral black impossible, the K (black ink) component, usually printed last, is needed to compensate for their deficiencies. Use of a separate black ink is also economically driven when a lot of black content is expected, e.g. in text media, to reduce simultaneous use of the three colored inks. The dyes used in traditional color photographic prints and [[reversal film|slides]] are much more perfectly transparent, so a K component is normally not needed or used in those media.

==Cylindrical-coordinate color models==
A number of color models exist in which colors are fit into [[conic]], [[cylindrical]] or [[spherical]] shapes, with neutrals running from black to white in a central axis, and hues corresponding to angles around that axis. Arrangements of this type date back to the 18th century, and continue to be developed in the most modern and scientific models.

{{see also|Color solid}}
Different color theorists have each designed unique [[color solid]]s.  Many are in the shape of a [[sphere]], whereas others are warped three-dimensional ellipsoid figures&amp;mdash;these variations being designed to express some aspect of the relationship of the colors more clearly.  The color spheres conceived by [[Phillip Otto Runge]] and [[Johannes Itten]] are typical examples and prototypes for many other color solid schematics.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Itten, "The Art of Color", 1961. Trans. Ernst Van Haagen. New York: Reinhold Publishing Corporation, 1966. {{ISBN|0-442-24038-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The models of Runge and Itten are basically identical, and form the basis for the description below.

Pure, saturated hues of equal brightness are located around the equator at the periphery of the color sphere.  As in the color wheel, [[Complementary color |contrasting (or complementary) hues]] are located opposite each other.  Moving toward the center of the color sphere on the equatorial plane, colors become less and less saturated, until all colors meet at the central [[Coordinate axis|axis]] as a neutral [[gray]].  Moving vertically in the color sphere, colors become lighter (toward the top) and darker (toward the bottom). At the upper pole, all hues meet in white; at the bottom pole, all hues meet in black.  

The vertical axis of the color sphere, then, is gray all along its length, varying from [[black]] at the bottom to [[white]] at the top.  All pure (saturated) hues are located on the surface of the sphere, varying from light to dark down the color sphere.  All impure (unsaturated hues, created by mixing contrasting colors) comprise the sphere's interior, likewise varying in brightness from top to bottom.

HSL and HSV are both cylindrical geometries, with hue, their angular dimension, starting at the [[red]] [[primary color|primary]] at 0°, passing through the [[green]] primary at 120° and the [[blue]] primary at 240°, and then wrapping back to red at 360°. In each geometry, the central vertical axis comprises the ''neutral'', ''achromatic'', or ''gray'' colors, ranging from black at lightness 0 or value 0, the bottom, to white at lightness 1 or value 1, the top.

Most televisions, computer displays, and projectors produce colors by combining red, green, and blue light in varying intensities—the so-called [[RGB color model|RGB]] [[additive color|additive]] [[primary color]]s. However, the relationship between the constituent amounts of red, green, and blue light and the resulting color is unintuitive, especially for inexperienced users, and for users familiar with [[subtractive color]] mixing of paints or traditional artists’ models based on tints and shades.

In an attempt to accommodate more traditional and intuitive color mixing models, computer graphics pioneers at [[PARC (company)|PARC]] and [[New York Institute of Technology|NYIT]] developed{{explain|date=June 2018}} the HSV model in the mid-1970s, formally described by [[Alvy Ray Smith]]&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;[[#Smith|Smith (1978)]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the August 1978 issue of [[Computer Graphics (publication)|''Computer Graphics'']]. In the same issue, Joblove and Greenberg&lt;ref name=Joblove&gt;[[#Joblove|Joblove and Greenberg (1978)]]&lt;/ref&gt; described the HSL model—whose dimensions they labeled ''hue'', ''relative chroma'', and ''intensity''—and compared it to HSV. Their model was based more upon how colors are organized and conceptualized in [[color vision|human vision]] in terms of other color-making attributes, such as hue, lightness, and chroma; as well as upon traditional color mixing methods—e.g., in painting—that involve mixing brightly colored pigments with black or white to achieve lighter, darker, or less colorful colors.

The following year, 1979, at [[SIGGRAPH]], [[Tektronix]] introduced graphics terminals using HSL for color designation, and the Computer Graphics Standards Committee recommended it in their annual status report. These models were useful not only because they were more intuitive than raw RGB values, but also because the conversions to and from RGB were extremely fast to compute: they could run in real time on the hardware of the 1970s. Consequently, these models and similar ones have become ubiquitous throughout image editing and graphics software since then.

{{main|Munsell color system}}
Another influential older cylindrical color model is the early-20th-century [[Munsell color system]]. [[Albert Henry Munsell|Albert Munsell]] began with a spherical arrangement in his 1905 book ''A Color Notation'', but he wished to properly separate color-making attributes into separate dimensions, which he called ''hue'', ''value'', and ''chroma'', and after taking careful measurements of perceptual responses, he realized that no symmetrical shape would do, so he reorganized his system into a lumpy blob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Runge |first1=Phillipp Otto |author-link=Philipp Otto Runge |date=1810 |title=Die Farben-Kugel, oder Construction des Verhaeltnisses aller Farben zueinander |location=Hamburg, Germany |publisher=Perthes |language=German |trans-title=The Color Sphere, or Construction of the Relationship of All Colors to Each Other}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Henry Munsell]] (1905). ''A Color Notation''. Boston, MA: [[Munsell Color Company]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=upper-alpha |See also [[#Fairchild|Fairchild (2005)]], and [[Munsell Color System]] and its references.}}

Munsell’s system became extremely popular, the de facto reference for American color standards—used not only for specifying the color of paints and crayons, but also, e.g., electrical wire, beer, and soil color—because it was organized based on perceptual measurements, specified colors via an easily learned and systematic triple of numbers, because the color chips sold in the ''Munsell Book of Color'' covered a wide [[gamut]] and remained stable over time (rather than fading), and because it was effectively marketed by [[Munsell Color Company|Munsell’s Company]]. In the 1940s, the [[Optical Society of America]] made extensive measurements, and adjusted the arrangement of Munsell colors, issuing a set of "renotations". The trouble with the Munsell system for computer graphics applications is that its colors are not specified via any set of simple equations, but only via its foundational measurements: effectively a [[lookup table]]. Converting from {{nobr|RGB ↔ Munsell}} requires interpolating between that table’s entries, and is extremely computationally expensive in comparison with converting from {{nobr|RGB ↔ HSL}} or {{nobr|RGB ↔ HSV}} which only requires a few simple arithmetic operations.&lt;ref name=Fairchild&gt;[[#Fairchild|Fairchild (2005)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Edward |last1=Landa |first2=Mark |last2=Fairchild |date=September–October 2005 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/charting-color-from-the-eye-of-the-beholder/5 |title=Charting Color from the Eye of the Beholder |journal=American Scientist |volume=93 |issue=5 |page=436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dorothy Nickerson |year=1976|title=History of the Munsell Color System|journal=Color Research and Application|volume=1|pages=121–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sidney Newhall |author2=Dorothy Nickerson |author3=Deane Judd |doi=10.1364/JOSA.33.000385|title=Final Report of the OSA Subcommittee on the Spacing of the Munsell Colors|year=1943|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America|volume=33|issue=7|pages=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preucil hue circle===
In [[densitometry]], a model quite similar to the hue defined above is used for describing colors of [[CMYK color model|CMYK process]] inks. In 1953, Frank Preucil developed two geometric arrangements of hue, the "Preucil hue circle" and the "Preucil hue hexagon", analogous to our ''H'' and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, but defined relative to idealized cyan, yellow, and magenta ink colors. The "Preucil ''hue error''" of an ink indicates the difference in the "hue circle" between its color and the hue of the corresponding idealized ink color. The ''grayness'' of an ink is {{nobr|''m''/''M''}}, where ''m'' and ''M'' are the minimum and maximum among the amounts of idealized cyan, magenta, and yellow in a density measurement.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Preucil (1953). "Color Hue and Ink Transfer—Their Relation to Perfect Reproduction". ''Proceedings of the 5th Annual Technical Meeting of TAGA''. {{nobr|pp. 102–110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural Color System===
The Swedish [[Natural Color System]] (NCS), widely used in Europe, takes a similar approach to the Ostwald bicone at right. Because it attempts to fit color into a familiarly shaped solid based on "[[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]]" instead of photometric or psychological characteristics, it suffers from some of the same disadvantages as HSL and HSV: in particular, its lightness dimension differs from perceived lightness, because it forces colorful yellow, red, green, and blue into a plane.&lt;ref name=MacEvoy&gt;[[#MacEvoy|MacEvoy (2010)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===CIELCH&lt;sub&gt;uv&lt;/sub&gt; and CIELCH&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;===

The [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE) developed the [[CIE 1931 color space|XYZ model]] for describing the colors of light spectra in 1931, but its goal was to match human visual [[metamerism (color)|metamerism]], rather than to be perceptually uniform, geometrically. In the 1960s and 70s, attempts were made to transform XYZ colors into a more relevant geometry, influenced by the Munsell system. These efforts culminated in the 1976 [[CIELUV]] and [[CIELAB]] models. The dimensions of these models—{{nobr|(''L''*, ''u''*, ''v''*)}} and {{nobr|(''L''*, ''a''*, ''b''*)}}, respectively—are cartesian, based on the [[opponent process]] theory of color, but both are also often described using polar coordinates—{{nobr|(''L''*, ''C''*&lt;sub&gt;''uv''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''*&lt;sub&gt;''uv''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{nobr|(''L''*, ''C''*&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''*&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, respectively—where ''L''* is lightness, ''C''* is chroma, and ''h''* is hue angle. Officially, both CIELAB and CIELUV were created for their [[color difference]] metrics ∆''E''*&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; and ∆''E''*&lt;sub&gt;''uv''&lt;/sub&gt;, particularly for use defining color tolerances, but both have become widely used as color order systems and color appearance models, including in computer graphics and computer vision. For example, [[gamut mapping]] in [[International Color Consortium|ICC]] [[color management]] is usually performed in CIELAB space, and Adobe Photoshop includes a CIELAB mode for editing images. CIELAB and CIELUV geometries are much more perceptually relevant than many others such as RGB, HSL, HSV, YUV/YIQ/YCbCr or XYZ, but are not perceptually perfect, and in particular have trouble adapting to unusual lighting conditions.&lt;ref name=Fairchild/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuehni&gt;[[#Kuehni|Kuehni (2003)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hunt (2004).

The [[HCL color space]] seems to be synonymous with CIELCH.

===CIECAM02===
The CIE’s most recent model, [[CIECAM02]] (CAM stands for "color appearance model"), is more theoretically sophisticated and computationally complex than earlier models. Its aims are to fix several of the problems with models such as CIELAB and CIELUV, and to explain not only responses in carefully controlled experimental environments, but also to model the color appearance of real-world scenes. Its dimensions ''J'' (lightness), ''C'' (chroma), and ''h'' (hue) define a polar-coordinate geometry.&lt;ref name=Fairchild/&gt;&lt;ref name=MacEvoy/&gt;

== Color systems ==

There are various types of color systems that classify color and analyse their effects. The American [[Munsell color system]] devised by [[Albert Henry Munsell|Albert H. Munsell]] is a famous classification that organises various colors into a color solid based on hue, saturation and value. Other important color systems include the Swedish [[Natural Color System]] (NCS), the [[Optical Society of America]]'s [[Uniform Color Space]] (OSA-UCS), and the Hungarian [[Coloroid]] system developed by [[Antal Nemcsics]] from the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]]. Of those, the NCS is based on the [[opponent process|opponent-process]] color model, while the Munsell, the OSA-UCS and the Coloroid attempt to model color uniformity. The American [[Pantone]] and the German [[RAL (color space system)|RAL]] commercial color-matching systems differ from the previous ones in that their color spaces are not based on an underlying color model.

== Other uses of "color model" ==
=== Models of mechanism of color vision ===

We also use "color model" to indicate a model or mechanism of color vision for explaining how color signals are processed from visual cones to ganglion cells.  For simplicity, we call these models color mechanism models. The classical color mechanism models are [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]]–[[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]]'s [[Young–Helmholtz theory|trichromatic model]] and [[Ewald Hering|Hering]]'s [[opponent process|opponent-process model]]. Though these two theories were initially thought to be at odds, it later came to be understood that the mechanisms responsible for color opponency receive signals from the three types of cones and process them at a more complex level.&lt;ref name="Kandel"&gt;Kandel ER, Schwartz JH and Jessell TM, 2000. ''Principles of Neural Science'', 4th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York. pp.&amp;nbsp;577–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vertebrate evolution of color vision ===

{{main|Evolution of color vision}}

Vertebrate animals were primitively [[tetrachromatic]]. They possessed four types of cones—long, mid, short wavelength cones, and ultraviolet sensitive cones.  Today, fish, amphibians, reptiles and birds are all tetrachromatic. Placental mammals lost both the mid and short wavelength cones. Thus, most mammals do not have complex color vision—they are [[dichromacy|dichromatic]] but they are sensitive to ultraviolet light, though they cannot see its colors. Human trichromatic color vision is a recent evolutionary novelty that first evolved in the common ancestor of the Old World Primates. Our trichromatic color vision evolved by duplication of the long wavelength sensitive [[opsin]], found on the X chromosome. One of these copies evolved to be sensitive to green light and constitutes our mid wavelength opsin. At the same time, our short wavelength opsin evolved from the ultraviolet opsin of our vertebrate and mammalian ancestors.

Human [[red-green color blindness]] occurs because the two copies of the red and green opsin genes remain in close proximity on the X chromosome. Because of frequent recombination during meiosis, these gene pairs can get easily rearranged, creating versions of the genes that do not have distinct spectral sensitivities.

'''''Contra errores Graecorum''', ad Urbanum IV Pontificem Maximum'' (''Against the Errors of the Greeks, to [[Pope Urban IV]]'') is a short treatise (an "opusculum") written in 1263 by [[Roman Catholic]] theologian Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] as a contribution to Pope Urban's efforts at reunion with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BWtarhaGxPUC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=Aquinas+%22errores+graecorum%22&amp;lr= Aidan Nichols, Discovering Aquinas: An Introduction to His Life, Work, and Influence] (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2003 {{ISBN|0-8028-0514-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8028-0514-0}}), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;  Aquinas wrote the treatise in 1263 while he was papal theologian and conventual lector in the Dominican ''studium'' at [[Orvieto]] after his first regency as professor of theology at the [[University of Paris]] which ended in 1259 and before he took up his duties in 1265 reforming the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] ''studium'' at [[Santa Sabina]], the forerunner of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']], in Rome.

==Text==

The title of the treatise was not given by Aquinas himself, and it contains nothing that is directed against the doctrine of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], but only, in the view of theologian [[Yves Congar]], a defence of Catholic doctrine against Eastern misunderstandings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CxucHPqvy5cC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=Aquinas+%22errores+graecorum%22&amp;lr=#PPA88,M1 Gabriel Flynn, Yves Congar: theologian of the church] (Peeters Publishers, 2005 {{ISBN|90-429-1668-0}}, {{ISBN|978-90-429-1668-5}}), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The 72 chapters of the work are each of the length of a paragraph in a modern book. In it Aquinas presents the teaching of the Greek Church Fathers as in harmony with that of the [[Latin Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=81vCJkNCb8kC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Davies+Aquinas#PPA5,M1 Brian Davies, Aquinas: an introduction] (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004 {{ISBN|0-8264-7095-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8264-7095-9}}), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The book is arranged in two parts, the first of 32 chapters and the second of 40, each part preceded by a prologue, and the work as a whole concluded with an epilogue. All the first part and 31 of the 40 chapters of the second concern [[Pneumatology (Christianity)|pneumatology]] (doctrine on the [[Holy Spirit]]). Of the final 9 chapters, 7 deal with the position of the [[Pope|Roman Pontiff]], and the last two with the use of leavened bread in the [[Eucharist]] and with [[purgatory]]. In all of these Aquinas quoted expressions by Fathers of the Greek Church in support of the teaching propounded by the Latin Church.

Aquinas died on his way to participate in the 1274 [[Second Council of Lyons]], to which he had been invited, but this treatise, which he had written eleven years before and not for the use of this Council,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_6PYWPWWhrUC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=Aquinas+%22errores+graecorum%22&amp;lr= Deno John Geanakoplos, Constantinople and the West: essays on the late Byzantine (Palaeologan) and Italian Renaissances and the Byzantine and Roman churches](Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1989 {{ISBN|0-299-11884-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-299-11884-6}}), p. 196]&lt;/ref&gt; was influential at the Council.

The titles of the first ten chapters given in the latter translation indicate something of the contents of the short work:
# How it should be understood when it is said that the Son comes from the Father as an effect from a cause (Quomodo intelligitur hoc quod dicitur quod filius habet a patre sicut causatum a causa).
# How it should be understood when it is said that the Son is second, after the Father, and the Holy Spirit is third (Quomodo intelligitur cum dicitur, quod filius sit secundus a patre, et spiritus sanctus sit tertius).
# How it should be understood when it is said that the Holy Spirit is the third light (Quomodo intelligitur hoc quod spiritus sanctus sit tertium lumen).
# How it should be understood when it is said that essence is begotten in the Son, and spirated in the Holy Spirit (Quomodo intelligitur, quod essentia sit genita in filio, et spirata in spiritu sancto).
# How it should be understood when it is said that Jesus is the Son of the Father's essence (Quomodo intelligitur quod Iesus dicitur filius paternae essentiae).
# How it should be understood when it is said that what naturally belongs to the Father, naturally belongs to the Son (Quomodo intelligitur, quod quae sunt propria naturaliter patris, sunt propria filii).
# How it should be understood when it is said that the perfection of the Father does not lack anything from either the Son or the Holy Spirit (Quomodo intelligitur quod pater neque filio neque spiritu sancto indiget ad sui perfectionem).
# How it should be understood when the Holy Spirit is called unbegotten (Quomodo intelligitur quod spiritus sanctus dicatur ingenitus).
# How it should be understood when the Holy Spirit is said to be the middle between the Father and the Son (Quomodo intelligitur quod spiritus sanctus dicitur medius patris et filii).
# How it should be understood when it is said that the Holy Spirit is the image of the Son (Quomodo intelligitur hoc quod dicitur, quod spiritus sanctus sit imago filii).

In his treatise, Aquinas "demonstrated that there was a theological harmony between the Greek Church Fathers and the Latin Church".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=f_jLbHTM_zgC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;vq=contra+errores+graecorum&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1 Jana K. Schulman, The rise of the medieval world, 500-1300: a biographical dictionary] (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002 {{ISBN|0-313-30817-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-313-30817-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that one source of misunderstandings between Greeks and Latins was the difficulty of finding appropriate words in each language` with which to translate technical theological terms used in the other:
:''Many things which sound well enough in [[Greek language|Greek]] do not perhaps, sound well in [[Latin]]. Hence, Latins and Greeks professing the same faith do so using different words. For among the Greeks it is said, correctly, and in a Catholic way, that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are three ''hypostases''. But with the Latins it does not sound right to say that there are three ''substantiae'', even though on a purely verbal basis the term ''hypostasis'' in Greek means the same as the term ''substantia'' in Latin. The fact is, ''substantia'' in Latin is more frequently used to signify essence. And both we and the Greeks hold that in God there is but one essence. So where the Greeks speak of three ''hypostases'', we Latins speak of three ''personae'', as Augustine in the seventh book on the Trinity also teaches. And, doubtless, there are many similar instances.''
:''It is, therefore, the task of the good translator, when translating material dealing with the Catholic faith, to preserve the meaning, but to adapt the mode of expression so that it is in harmony with the idiom of the language into which he is translating. For obviously, when anything spoken in a literary fashion in Latin is explained in common parlance, the explanation will be inept if it is simply word for word. All the more so, when anything expressed in one language is translated merely word for word into another, it will be no surprise if perplexity concerning the meaning of the original sometimes occurs.''&lt;ref&gt;Prologue to ''Contra Errores Graecorum''&lt;/ref&gt;

==The problem of the sources==

The apologetic impact of the work is limited, due to the fact that Thomas uses a collection of texts compilled by [[Nicholas of Crotone]] which contains doubtful attributions and personal glosses of the compiller that bent the text in direction of the Latin theology. According to Jean-Pierre Torell, "on four specific questions concerning the procession ''a filio'', the primacy of the pope, the Eucharistic celebration with unleavened bread, and purgatory, Thomas is clearly forced to rely more on the texts that are closer to Latin theology, when these are in fact glosses foreign to the Fathers."&lt;ref&gt;Saint Thomas Aquinas: the person and his work, Volume 1, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Heraldic achievement}}
In [[heraldry]], '''dimidiation''' is a method of [[Heraldry#Marshalling|marshalling]] (heraldically combining) two [[coat of arms|coats of arms]].

For a time, dimidiation preceded the method known as [[Impalement (heraldry)|impalement]]. Whereas impalement involves placing the whole of both coats of arms side by side in the same shield, dimidiation involves placing the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] half of one coat of arms alongside the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] half of the other. In the case of marriage, the dexter half of the husband's arms would be placed alongside the sinister half of the wife's arms.

The practice fell out of use because the result was not always aesthetically pleasing (sometimes creating strange hybrids, as seen in the examples at right), and also because in some cases, it would result in a shield that confusingly looked like one coat of arms rather than a combination of two. For instance, a [[Bend (heraldry)|bend]] combined with a bend sinister might result in a combination that simply looked like a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]], thus hiding the fact that two coats of arms had been combined.

In order to avoid these drawbacks, it became customary to use more than half of each coat of arms when combining them through dimidiation. Once this practice had begun, the logical progression was to include the whole of both coats of arms in the new shield, so that in effect, impalement replaced dimidiation as a method of combining coats of arms.

A general rule which carries over from dimidiation to impalement is that if a coat of arms with a [[bordure]] (or [[tressure]], [[orle (heraldry)|orle]], etc.) is impaled, the bordure should not continue down the line of impalement.

''''' Fassbinder's Women''''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Für mich gab's nur noch Fassbinder - Die Glücklichen Opfer Des Rainer Werner F'')  is a 2000 German [[documentary]] [[film]] directed by [[Rosa von Praunheim]]. The original German title translates as ''Fassbinder Was the Only One for Me: The Willing Victims of Rainer Werner F''.&lt;ref name="Variety review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117798392/awards|title= Fassbinder's Women|publisher=Variety|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The film consists of several interviews with the women who part of the professional and personal lives of the German film director [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]. These include: [[Hanna Schygulla]], the director's favorite actress; Ursula Strätz, who founded the Munich Action Theater, where Fassbinder began his career on the stage and actresses [[Barbara Valentin]] and [[Brigitte Mira]], the star of Fassbinder’s ''[[Fear Eats the Soul]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Four of the director’s male collaborators: assistant director [[Harry Baer]]; cinematographer [[Michael Ballhaus]]; musician [[Peer Raben]] and producer Peter Berling, also talk about Fassbinder's working methods and personality.

The film opens with actress [[Irm Hermann]], who worked in nineteen films with Fassbinder while he made life a living hell for her. [[Juliane Lorenz]], Fassbinder’s last female partner, film editor and executor of his estate after his death, is also interviewed. Fassbinder’s ex-wife, actress and singer [[Ingrid Caven]], briefly talks about him in a phone conversation. Missing from the lineup are onscreen collaborators [[Margit Carstensen]] and [[Barbara Sukowa]]. There are no clips from Fassbinder’s films.&lt;ref name="Variety review 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117798392/revied|title= Fassbinder's Women|publisher=Variety|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outline of story ==
[[File:25 tam back.jpg|thumb| Backside of Tibetan [[Historical money of Tibet|25 tam banknote]], dated 1659 of the Tibetan Era (= 1913 CE). On the right, the four harmonious animals are represented.]]
A popular scene often found as wall paintings in Tibetan religious buildings represents an elephant standing under a fruit tree carrying a monkey, a hare and a bird (usually a partridge, but sometimes a grouse, and in Bhutan a [[hornbill]]) on top of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gruschke|first1=Andreas|title=The Cultural Monuments of Tibet's Outer Provinces: The Qinghai part of Amdo|date=2001|publisher=White Lotus Press|location=Bangkok|isbn=9747534592|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GuKfAAAAMAAJ|series=The Cultural Monuments of Tibet's Outer Provinces: Amdo|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene refers to a legend which tells that four animals were trying to find out who was the oldest. The elephant said that the tree was already fully grown when he was young, the monkey that the tree was small when he was young, the hare that he saw the tree as a sapling when he was young and the bird claimed that he had excreted the seed from which the tree grew. So the bird was recognized by the other animals as the oldest, and the four animals lived together in co-dependence and cooperation, helping each other to enjoy the fruits of the tree. After the story is finished, it is revealed the partridge was the Buddha in a previous life.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1895"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j1/j1040.htm|title=The Jataka|volume=I|first=Robert|last=Chalmers|author-link=Robert Chalmers, 1st Baron Chalmers|year=1895|chapter=Tittira Jātaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}} The story was meant as an illustration of cooperation and respect for seniority, and was told by the Buddha after some of his students had failed to pay due respect to the senior disciple [[Śāriputra]].&lt;ref name="Whitecross 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richard|first1=Whitecross,|title="Virtuous Beings": The Concept of ''tha damtshig'' and Being a Moral Person in Contemporary Bhutanese Society|journal=Himalaya, the Journal of the Association for Nepal and Himalayan Studies|date=1 January 2010|volume=28|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/himalaya/vol28/iss1/6/|language=en|issn=2471-3716|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malalasekera 1938"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Tittira Jātaka (No.37)|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names|author-link=G P Malalasekera|first=G.P.|last=Malalasekera|volume=2|url=http://palikanon.com/english/pali_names/t/tittira_j_37_117_319_438.htm|year=1938|publisher=[[Pali Text Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the tale also describes the animals upholding the [[five precepts]] and teaching them to others.&lt;ref name="Penjore 2005" /&gt; One of the oldest extant forms of the story is the [[Pali]] version, called the ''Tittira Jataka''.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}}

Communal harmony and respect for seniority are the main moral of the story. Such respect stands in contrast with a [[pecking-order]] according to strength, size and power: it is {{em|the partridge}} which is most respected, not the elephant.&lt;ref name="Penjore 2005"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Penjore|first1=Ugyen|title=Understanding the symbolism of Thuenpa Puen Zhi|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=40,1531,0,0,1,0#.WI0s0FUrK70|via=The Buddhist Channel|accessdate=28 January 2017|work=Kuensel Online|date=2 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Buddha did sometimes downplay the value respecting older people merely for their age, in this story he illustrates that a senior person should nonetheless be respected for their experience, because, as Tachibana points out, "the maturity of age is generally the sign of much experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tachibana|first1=S.|title=The ethics of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BRWyqi2K4WUC|date=1992|publisher=[[Curzon Press]]|location=Richmond, Surrey|isbn=978-0-7007-0230-5|page=224|edition=Facsim.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the story led to the establishment of several rules of conduct with regard to respect for seniority in the context of the monastic life, in which the {{em|number of years ordained}} as a [[Bhikkhu|monk]] (''{{lang-sa|bhikṣu}}''; ''{{lang-pi|bhikkhu}}'') is measured, rather than {{em|age}}.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1895" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Sarah|title=The Jatakas: Birth Stories of the Bodhisatta|date=2006|publisher=[[Penguin UK]]|isbn=9788184750348|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ay4WFGQtSy0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] explains the relation between respect for seniority and harmony, drawing from the story: "A hierarchy based on seniority, however, is both objective and, in the long run, less oppressive: One's place in the hierarchy is not a measure of one's worth.  Such a hierarchy also discourages the pride and competition that would come if bhikkhus could fight their way up the hierarchy by outdoing the measurable merit of others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc2.pdf|title=The Buddhist Monastic Code|date=2013|publisher=[[Metta Forest Monastery]]|year=|isbn=|edition=3rd|volume=II|location=California|page=92|pages=|quote=|author-link=Thanissaro Bhikkhu|via=|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four animals represent the different [[habitats]] of the animal world—the sky, the trees, the ground, and underground.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}} The partridge assumes the role of the most senior animal: in pre-modern India, the partridge was highly regarded for its intelligence and understanding  of language.&lt;ref name="Gutierrez 2014"&gt;{{cite thesis|title=The Parrot’s Voice and the Partridge’s Feathers: The Languaging of Animals and Animal Language in Early Indian Texts|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/28521|first=Andrea Lorene|last=Gutiérrez|publisher=[[The University of Texas]]|type=M.A. Thesis|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excreting of the seed of the tree is relevant, because some Indian trees are believed to only sprout when the seed is excreted by a bird, thus further amplifying the concept of cooperation and mutual dependence.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|53}} The image of the animals standing on each other’s shoulders, on the back of a patient elephant, also portrays social and environmental harmony: the bird finds a seed and plants it, then the rabbit waters it, and the monkey fertilizes it. Once the seed sprouts and begins to grow, the elephant protects it. After some time, the small plant grows into a big, beautiful tree full of healthy fruit. By working together and using their individual talents, the four friends are able to reach and enjoy the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.folklife.si.edu/resources/pdf/Signs/Bhutan/BH_PRG_03.pdf|title=The Four Harmonious Friends|last=|first=|date=12 June 2008|website=[[Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary source for the Buddhist legend of the four harmonious brothers is the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka|Vinayavastu]]'' ({{bo|w='dul ba'i gzhi}}), which forms the first section of the [[Kangyur]], the canon of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="Dagyab 2016" /&gt;{{rp|107}}&lt;ref name="sagaster" /&gt; In canons of other Buddhist traditions, such as in the [[Pali Canon]] of [[Theravāda]] Buddhism, and in the texts of the [[Mahāsāṃghika]], [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūla-Sarvāstivāda]] and [[Sarvāstivāda]] orders, almost the same ''Jātaka'' tale is found in the ''Vinaya'' and ''Jātaka'' collections. The [[Dharmaguptaka]] and [[Mahīśāsaka]] orders did not consider the story part of the ''Jātaka'', however, and only included it in their ''Vinayas''. [[Bhikkhu Analayo]] believes that originally the story was not considered a previous life of the Buddha, but only a [[didactic]] [[parable]] taught by the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Analayo 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anālayo|first1=Bhikkhu|author-link=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=Canonical Jātaka Tales in Comparative Perspective: The Evolution of Tales of the Buddha's Past Lives|journal=Fuyan Buddhist Studies|date=2012|volume=7|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/38470683/CanonicalJatakas.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1485644573&amp;Signature=et7fWx%2FMyFxtAwEa%2BgTKug1ISow%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCanonical_Jataka_Tales_in_Comparative_Pe.pdf|publisher=Fuyan Buddhist Institute|location=[[Hsinchu]]|issn=2070-0512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old Irish]] scholar [[Eleanor Hull]] has pointed out that the story may reveal a custom of the ancient world to determine the date based on the life spans of different animals.

'''''Gongbi''''' ({{Zh|t=工筆|s=工笔|p=gōng bǐ|w=kung-pi}}) is a careful [[Realism (arts)|realist]] technique in [[Chinese painting]], the opposite of the interpretive and freely expressive ''[[Xieyi (painting)|xieyi]]'' (寫意 'sketching thoughts') style.

The name is from the Chinese ''gong jin'' meaning 'tidy' (meticulous brush craftsmanship). The ''gongbi'' technique uses highly detailed brushstrokes that delimits details very precisely and without independent or expressive variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gongbi Painting - Chinese Traditional Painting with Meticulous Detail - China culture  Qiu Ying, Shen Quan|url = http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/62Arts2192.html|website = arts.cultural-china.com|access-date = 2016-02-04|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090409090447/http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/62Arts2192.html|archivedate = 2009-04-09|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often highly colored and usually depicts figural or narrative subjects.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = gongbi {{!}} Chinese painting|url = http://www.britannica.com/art/gongbi|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the better known Gongbi works is the Song Dynasty Scroll, 17 feet long and includes intricate details that most don’t pick up. It is one of many popular tourist attractions in China today, as it is updated regularly to try and show what modern China looks like compared to when it was created during the Song Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Two Versions of the Scroll |url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/songdynasty-module/intro-two-versions.html |website=The Song Dynasty in China: China in 1000 CE |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=17 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term related to ''gongbi'', ''jiehua'' (or "boundary painting"), refers to the accurate depiction of [[architectural]] forms aided by the ruler.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
The ''gongbi'' style had its beginnings approximately 2000 years ago during the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD) when Han's political stability and its prosperity favored the advancement of the arts. These paintings peaked out between the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties (7th to 13th centuries) when these refined paintings were endorsed and collected by the royal families of China. To perfect this style the ''gongbi'' artists must totally commit themselves to these techniques. Only the wealthy could afford such artists. This style of art was accomplished in secret in royal palaces and private homes. Gongbi is one of the oldest Chinese painting techniques that feature narratives or high authority figures in them.

==Tools==
When using brushes to paint gongbi,  there are specific types for contouring and colouring. There are four types of brushes for [[contour drawing|contouring]]; Hong Mao (red hairs), are used to draw thick strokes mainly for [[landscape]] and background visuals. Yi Wen is used for longer lines to paint clothing, for example. Ye Jing brushes are used to contour flowers and bedsheets. Xie Zhua is the finest contour brush used to paint strokes of dragonflies and specific detail in the painting. There are three sizes of brushes used to colour the surface of the painting: Da Bai Yun (large white cloud), Zhong Bai Yun (average white cloud) and Xiao Bai Yun (small white cloud). Rough drafts are usually drawn on [[rice paper]]. If there is only one draft, a special type of paper called [[Xuan paper]] is used. The soft paper is able to absorb water well, best used for [[Chinese painting]] and [[calligraphy]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.chine-culture.com/en/chinese-painting/chinese-painting-gongbi.php; retrieved on 2014-04-3&lt;/ref&gt; Silk can also be used, which is sized as well.

==Process of the craft==
''Gongbi'' requires drawing with fine lines first to represent the exaggerated likenesses of the objects, and then adds washes of ink and color layer by layer, so as to approach the perfection of exquisiteness and fine art. The practice of Gongbi is specifically on rice paper when sketching out the design and layout of the drawing. Typically, pencil is used before beginning the second draft with the tipped brushes. The variation and detail in strokes are important especially when layering each wash of ink on top of each other. There are upward and downward strokes used that emphasize detailed pictures such as facial features and insects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After hundreds of years, a technique was developed for all gongbi artists as a system. Lines are used first to contour the figure and determine the fine outlines of the painting. Modest colors are added to the painting that add onto a sense of nature; flamboyant colors are used when the content of the painting has accentuated lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaculture.org/classics/2012-02/10/content_429449_2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407095336/http://www.chinaculture.org/classics/2012-02/10/content_429449_2.htm |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }} retrieved on 2014-04-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''hilya''''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] حلية (plural: ''ḥilan'', ''ḥulan''), {{lang-tr|hilye}} (plural: ''hilyeler'')  denotes both a visual form in [[Ottoman art]] and a religious genre of [[Turkish literature#Ottoman literature|Ottoman Turkish literature]], each dealing with the [[physical description of Muhammad]]. Hilya literally means "ornament".

They originate with the discipline of  ''shama'il'', the study of Muhammad's appearance and character, based on [[hadith]] accounts, most notably [[Tirmidhi]]'s ''al-Shama'il al-Muhamadiyyah wa al-Khasa'il al-Mustafawiyyah'' ("The Sublime Characteristics of Muhammad").

In Ottoman-era [[folk Islam]], there was a belief that reading and possessing Muhammad's description protects the person from trouble in this world and the next, it became customary to carry such descriptions,  rendered in fine [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]] and [[Ottoman illumination|illuminated]], as [[amulet]]s.&lt;ref name="Bakker2009"&gt;{{cite book |title= The challenge of the silver screen: an analysis of the cinematic portraits of Jesus, Rama, Buddha and Muhammad |last= Bakker |first= Freek L.|authorlink= |year= 2009 |publisher= BRILL |location= |isbn= 978-90-04-16861-9 |page= 209 |pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4KNSp-uEO18C&amp;pg=PA209 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt; In 17th-century [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkey]], ''hilyes'' developed into an art form with a standard layout, often framed and used as a wall decoration.
[[File:Hilye Yesarizade Mustafa Izzet Efendi.JPG|thumb|19th-century hilye on gilded and framed panel.]]

Later ''hilyes'' were also written for the [[Rashidun|first four Caliphs]], the [[Sahabah|companions of Muhammad]], Muhammad's grandchildren ([[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Hussein ibn Ali|Hussein]]) and Islamic saints ([[wali]]s).

== Origins in hadith ==
{{main|Shama'il Muhammadiyah}}
''Hilye'', both as the literary genre and as the graphic art form, originates from ''shama'il'', the study of Muhammad's appearance and character. The best source on this subject is considered to be Imam [[Tirmidhi]]'s ''al-Shama'il al-Muhamadiyyah wa al-Khasa'il al-Mustafawiyyah'' ("The Sublime Characteristics of Muhammad"). The acceptance and influence of this work has led to the use of the term ''"shama'il"'' (appearance) to mean Muhammad's fine morals and unique physical beauty. As they contained hadiths describing Muhammad's spirit and physique, ''shama-il'' have been the source of ''hilye''. The best known and accepted of these hadith are attributed to his son-in-law and cousin [[Ali]].&lt;ref name="Brockopp2010"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Cambridge companion to Muhammad |last= Brockopp |first= Jonathan E. |authorlink= |year= 2010 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-521-71372-6 |page= 130 |pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=o58K2t344YQC&amp;pg=PA130 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The sources of ''hilye'' have been the six main hadith books along with other hadith sources, attributed to people such as [[Aisha]], [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas]], [[Abu Hurairah]], [[Hasan ibn Ali]]. While ''shama'il'' lists the physical and spiritual characteristics of Muhammad in detail, in ''hilye'' these are written about in a literary style.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Cumhuriyet Üniversitesi İlahiyat Fakültesi Dergisi | author= Erdoğan, M. | title= Hâkim Mehmed Efendi'nin Manzum Hilyesi |  volume=  11 |pages= 317–357| year=  2007| url= http://eskidergi.cumhuriyet.edu.tr/makale/1514.pdf | language = Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other descriptive ''Shama'il'' text are the ''Dala'il al-Nubuwwah'' of [[Al-Bayhaqi]], ''Tarih-i Isfahan'' of Abu Naeem Isfahani, ''Al-Wafa bi Fadha'il al-Mustafa'' of [[Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi]]  and ''Al-Shifa'' of [[Qadi Ayyad]] are the main shemaa-il and hilya books.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt;

==Literary genre==
Although many ''hilyes'' exist in Turkish literature, Persian literature does not have many examples of the ''shama'il'' and ''hilye'' genre. Abu Naeem Isfahani wrote a work titled ''Hilyetü'l-Evliya'', but it is not about Muhammad. For this reason, the ''hilye'' is considered one of Turkey's national literary genres.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt; Turkish literature has also some early works that may have inspired the appearance of the ''hilye'' as a literary genre. The ''Vesiletü'n-necat'' of [[Süleyman Çelebi (poet)|Süleyman Çelebi]] (1351-1422 [[:fr:Suleyman Çelebi (de Bursa)]]), and the ''Muhammeddiye'' of [[Yazıcıoğlu Mehmed]], referred to Muhammad's characteristics.&lt;ref name="Yazar"&gt;{{cite journal | journal= Journal of Turkish Studies | author= Yazar, S. | title= Seyyid Şerîfî Mehmed Efendi ve Hilyesi (Seyyid Sherîfî Efendi and His Hilye) | volume= 2 | pages= 1026–1044 | year= 2007 | url= http://www.egirdir.net/SeyyidMehmed.pdf | language= Turkish | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140413170136/http://www.egirdir.net/SeyyidMehmed.pdf | archivedate= 2014-04-13 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 255-verse long ''Risale-i Resul'' about the attributes of Muhammad, written by a writer with the penname of Şerifi, was presented to [[Shahzade Bayezid]], one of the sons of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], at an unknown date that was presumably before the Shahzade's death in 1562.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt; This is believed to be the earliest ''hilye'' in verse form in Turkish literature.&lt;ref name="Yazar"/&gt; However, the ''Hilye-i Şerif'' by [[Mehmet Hakani]] (d. 1606–07) is considered the finest example of the genre (see section below).&lt;ref name=Gruber132&gt;{{cite book |title= The Islamic manuscript tradition: ten centuries of book arts in Indiana University collections |last= Gruber |first= Christiane J. |authorlink= |year= 2010 |publisher= Indiana University Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-253-35377-1 |pages=131–133 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lIY0oAd6Y40C&amp;pg=PA132}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilye-i Şerif, [https://archive.org/details/hilyeihakani00hakauoft Digitised copy] of the 1898 edition at [[archive.org]]&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''hilye'' written in prose form is ''Hilye-i Celile ve Şemail-i 'Aliye'' by [[Hoca Sadeddin Efendi]].&lt;ref name="Yazar"/&gt;

Although the ''hilye'' tradition started with descriptions of Muhammad, later ''hilyes'' were written about the [[Rashidun|first four Caliphs]], the [[Sahabah|companions of Muhammad]], Muhammad's grandchildren ([[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Hussein ibn Ali|Hussein]]) and Islamic saints ([[walis]]) such as [[Rumi|Mevlana]].&lt;ref name="Yazar"/&gt; The second most important ''hilye'', after Hakani's, is considered to be Cevri İbrahim Çelebi's ''hilye'', ''Hilye-i Çihar-Yar-ı Güzin'' (1630), about the physical appearance of the first four caliphs.&lt;ref name="Erkal1999"&gt;{{cite journal | journal= Atatürk Üniversitesi Türkiyat Araştırmaları Enstitüsü Dergisi | issue= 12 | pages= 111–131  | year= 1999| title=  Türk Edebiyatında Hilye ve Cevri'nin "Hilye-i Çâr Yâr-ı Güzin"i | author=Erkal, A. | url= http://e-dergi.atauni.edu.tr/index.php/taed/article/viewFile/1784/1783  | language = Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important ''hilye'' writer is Nesati Ahmed Dede (d. 1674), whose 184-verse long poem is about the physical characteristics of [[Prophets in Islam|14 prophets]] and [[Adam]].&lt;ref name="Erkal1999"/&gt; Other notable ''hilyes'' are Dursunzâde Bakayi's ''Hilye'tûl-Enbiya ve Çeyar-ı Güzîn'' (hilye of the prophet and his four caliphs), Nahifi's (d. 1738) prose ''hilye'' ''Nüzhet-ûl-Ahyar fi Tercüment-iş-Şemîl-i'' and Arif Süleyman Bey's (1761) ''Nazire-î Hakânî''.&lt;ref name="velioglu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hilye-i Şerif |author=Velioğlu, A.K. |work=Klasik Türk Sanatları Vakfı |accessdate=2012-01-18 |url=http://www.klasikturksanatlarivakfi.com/indexalt.php?sayfa=fotograf&amp;fotokateid=40 |language=Turkish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110205152/http://www.klasikturksanatlarivakfi.com/indexalt.php?sayfa=fotograf&amp;fotokateid=40 |archivedate=2010-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hilyes'' can be written as standalone prose or poems (often in the [[Masnavi (poetic form)|masnavi]] form). They can also be part of two other forms of Turkish Islamic literature, a Mevlid (account of Muhammad's life) or a ''Mir'aj-name'' (accounts of Muhammad's [[Isra and Mi'raj|Night Journey]]).&lt;ref name="ispirli"/&gt;

==Art form==
[[File:PQ Khalili hilye mss 0759.JPG|thumb|right|A ''hilye'' (1712) meant to be folded and carried on one's person (the crease lines are visible). The two crescents above and below the large circle in the middle contain the description of Muhammad. The central circle describes the protective powers of the ''hilye''. The protective hand of [[Fatimah]] is also drawn on the lower crescent, as another sign against evil. The circle and the edges of the sheet are bordered with [[Koran]]ic verses. ]]
While writers developed ''hilye'' as a literary genre, calligraphers and illuminators developed it into a decorative art form. Because of their supposed protective effect, a practice developed in Ottoman Turkey of the 17th century of carrying Muhammad's description on one's person.&lt;ref name="baycol"&gt;{{cite journal| title= Hilye-i Şerifler ve Medeniyetimizdeki Yeri | author= Bayçöl, H.| year= 2007 | journal= Yağmur | issue= 37| volume= | pages= | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/71303374/Hat-Sanat%C4%B1nda-Hilye-i-%C5%9Eerif-U%C4%9Fur-DERMAN | language = Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, because of the belief that a house with a ''hilye'' will not see poverty, trouble, fear or the devil,&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt; such texts came to be displayed prominently in a house. The term of '''hilye''' was used for the art form for presenting these texts.&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt; Thus, the ''hilye'', as a vehicle for Muhammad's presence after his death, was believed to have a [[talisman]]ic effect, capable of protecting a house, a child, a traveller, or a person in difficulty.&lt;ref name=Gruber132 /&gt; In addition, the purpose of the ''hilye'' is to help visualize Muhammad as a mediator between the sacred and human worlds, to connect with him by using the viewing of the ''hilye'' as an opportunity to send a traditional blessing upon him, and to establish an intimacy with him.&lt;ref name=Gruber132 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zakariya/&gt;&lt;ref name="Safi2009"/&gt;

The pocket ''hilyes'' were written on a piece of paper, small enough to fit in a breast pocket after being folded in three. The folding lines were reinforced with cloth or leather. Other pocket ''hilyes'' were made of wood.&lt;ref name="derman"/&gt; ''Hilyes'' to be displayed on a wall were prepared on paper mounted on wooden panels, although in the 19th century, thick paper sheets became another medium.&lt;ref name="derman"/&gt; The top part of ''hilyes'' that were laid on wooded panels were carved and cut out in the form of a crown. The crown  part would be richly illuminated and miniatures of Medina, the [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi|tomb of Muhammad]] or the [[Kabaa]] would be placed there, together or separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Hilye-i Şerife| author= Faruk Taşkale| url= http://www.faruktaskale.com/hilye-i-serife-the-charactrestics-of-the-prophet-muhammed | accessdate= 2012-01-20 | language = Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ottoman Turks have commissioned scribes to write ''hilyes'' in fine calligraphy and had them decorated with illuminators. Serving as a textual portraits of the prophets, ''hilye'' panels have decorated homes for centuries. These calligraphic panels were often framed and came to be used as wall decorations in houses, [[mosque]]s and shrines, fulfilling an equivalent role to that played by images of Jesus in the Christian tradition.&lt;ref name="Safi2009"&gt;{{cite book |title= Memories of Muhammad: why the Prophet matters |last=Safi |first= Omid |authorlink= Omid Safi |year= 2009 |publisher= HarperCollins |location= |isbn= 978-0-06-123134-6  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Gs2oDbagvfIC |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|276}}&lt;ref name="Peters2010"&gt;{{cite book |title= Jesus and Muhammad: Parallel Tracks, Parallel Lives |last= Peters |first= F.

The first recorded instance of Hilye-i Sherif panels is generally believed to have been prepared by the notable scribe [[Hâfiz Osman]] (1642–1698).&lt;ref name="derman"/&gt; He was one of earliest scribes known to make such works, although it has been suggested that another famous scribe, [[Ahmed Karahisarî]] (1468–1556), may have created one ''hilye'' panel about a century before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Abdulkadiroğlu, A.| title=İlk Hilye Hattatı Ahmed Karahisari mi?

It consisted of a description of Mohammad in Arabic, and below that its Turkish translation, written in diagonal, to create a triangular block of text.&lt;ref name="derman"&gt;{{cite journal| title= Hat Sanatında Hilye-i Şerif | author= Derman, M.U.| year= 2000 | journal= Diyanet: İlmî Dergi | volume= | pages= | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/71303374/Hat-Sanat%C4%B1nda-Hilye-i-%C5%9Eerif-U%C4%9Fur-DERMAN | language = Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A characteristic feature of the texts shown at the centre of ''hilyes'' is their praise for the beauty of Muhammad's physical appearance and character.&lt;ref name="Safi2009"/&gt;{{rp|273–274}} While containing a verbal description of what Muhammad looked like, a ''hilye'' leaves picturing Muhammad's appearance to the reader's imagination, in line with the [[aniconism in Islam|mainly aniconic nature of Islamic art]].&lt;ref name="Peters2010" /&gt;

===Standard layout===
The standard layout for the Ottoman ''hilye'' panel is generally attributed to [[Hâfiz Osman]]. This layout is generally considered to be the best and has come to be the classical form.&lt;ref name="velioglu"/&gt; It contains the following elements:&lt;ref name=Gruber132/&gt;
[[File:Hilye-i Serif 6.jpg|thumb|left|Hilye by [[Kazasker Mustafa Izzet Efendi]] (1801–1876)]]
*The ''baş makam'' ("head station"), a top panel containing a ''[[bismallah]]'' or blessing&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"&gt;{{cite book |title= Letters in gold: Ottoman calligraphy from the Sakıp Sabancı collection, Istanbul |last= Derman |first= M.

*The ''göbek'' ("belly"), a round shape containing the first part of the main text in ''naskh'' script.&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Osborn/&gt; It often contains the description of Muhammad by [[Ali]] (according to [[Tirmidhi]]), with minor variations&lt;ref name="Schick"&gt;{{cite journal| author= Shick, I.C. | year= 2008 | title=The Iconicity of Islamic Calligraphy in Turkey | journal= RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics | issue=53/54 | pages= 211–224 | jstor= 25608818 }}&lt;/ref&gt;(see quote in the [[#Origins|Origins]] section above).
*The ''hilâl'' ("[[crescent]]"), an optional section with no text, which is often [[gilding|gilded]].  A crescent encircling the ''göbek'', with its thick middle part at the bottom.  Together, the ''göbek'' and ''hilal'' also evoke the image of the sun and the moon.&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Osborn/&gt;
*The ''kösheler'' ("corners"), usually four rounded compartments surrounding the ''göbek'', typically containing the names of the four ''[[Rashidun]]'' or "rightly-guided" [[Caliph]]s according to [[Sunnis]], or in some cases other titles of Muhammad, names of his companions, or some of the names of [[Allah]].&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Osborn/&gt;
*The ''ayet'' or ''kuşak'' ("verse" or "belt") section below the ''göbek'' and crescent, containing a verse from the [[Quran]], usually {{cite quran|21|107|b=n|style=ref}} ("And We [God] did not send you  [Muhammad] except to be a mercy to the universe"), or sometimes {{cite quran|68|4|b=n|style=ref}} ("Truly, you [Muhammad] are of a tremendous nature") or {{cite quran|48|28–29|b=n|style=ref}} ("And God is significant witness that Muhammad is the messenger of God").&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Osborn/&gt;
*The ''etek'' ("skirt" or lower part) containing the conclusion of the text begun in the ''göbek'', a short prayer, and the signature of the artist. If the main text fits completely in the ''göbek'', the ''etek'' may be absent.&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt;
*The ''koltuklar'' ("empty spaces"), two alleys or side panels on either side of the ''etek'' that typically contain ornamentation – sometimes illuminated – but no text, although occasionally the names of some of the ten companions of Muhammad are found there.&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Osborn/&gt;
*The ''iç'' and ''dış pervaz'' ("inner and outer frame"), an ornamental border in correct proportion to the text.&lt;ref name=Osborn&gt;{{cite book |title= The type of calligraphy: Writing, print, and technologies of the Arabic alphabet |last= Osborn |first= J. R. |authorlink= |year= 2008 |publisher= ProQuest |location= |isbn= 978-0-549-51769-6 | pages=236–239 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YtQeZt7ybjwC&amp;pg=PA238 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of the space is taken up with decorative [[Ottoman illumination]], of the type usual for the period, often with a border framing the whole in a contrasting design to the main central field that is the background of the text sections. The "verse" and "corners" normally use a larger ''[[thuluth]]'' script, while the "head" section with the ''bismallah'' is written in ''[[muhaqqaq]]''.&lt;ref name=Ali8&gt;

The names in Turkish of the central structural elements of the ''hilye'' are, from top to bottom, ''başmakam'' (head station), ''göbek'' (belly), ''kuşak'' (belt) and ''etek'' (skirt). This [[anthropomorphic]] naming makes it clear that the ''hilye'' represents a human body, whose purpose is "to recall semantically the Prophet's presence via a graphic construct".&lt;ref name="Gruber"&gt;{{cite book| author=Gruber, Christiane J. | title= The Islamic manuscript tradition: ten centuries of book arts in Indiana University collections | year= 2010 |  publisher= Indiana University Press | page= | isbn= 978-0-253-35377-1| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lIY0oAd6Y40C&amp;pg=PA132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested&lt;ref name="Schick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gruber"/&gt; that Hafiz Osman's ''hilye'' design might have been inspired by the celebrated [[#Hilye-i Şerif|Hilye-i Şerif]], which in turn was based on the possibly spurious hadith according to which Muhammad has said "... Whoever sees my hilye after me is as though he has seen me... ". If so, a ''hilye'' might have been meant to be ''not read'' but seen and contemplated, because it is really an image made of plain text.&lt;ref name="Schick" /&gt;

The standard Hilye-i Şerif composition has been followed by calligraphers since its creation in the late 17th century. Some examples from the 19th century and two made by Hafiz Osman can be seen below.

However, deviations from the standard model do occur and many innovative designs have been produced as well.&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt;

==Popularity of the graphic form==
[[File:Hilye with side panels 1718.jpg|thumb|left|A ''hilye'' from 1718, similar to a Christian [[triptych]]. The middle panel is topped with a crown carving. The side panes list the [[Names of God in Islam|99 names of Allah]].]]
There are several reasons given for the popularity of graphic ''hilyes''.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yazar"/&gt;  Islam prohibits the depiction of graphic representations of people that may lead to idols. For this reason, Islamic art developed in the forms of calligraphy, miniatures and other non-figurative arts. In miniatures, Muhammad's face was either veiled or blanked. Because of the prohibition on drawing the face of Muhammad, the need to represent Muhammad was satisfied by writing his name and characteristics.

Many authors have commented that another reason is the affection that Muslims feel for Muhammad, which leads them to read about his physical and moral beauty.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yazar"/&gt; The (apocryphal) hadith that those who memorize his ''hilye'' and keep it close to their heart will see Muhammad in their dreams would have been another reason. Muslim people's love for Muhammad is considered to be one of the reasons for the display of ''hilye'' panels at a prominent place in their homes (see [[#Graphic art form section|Graphic art form section]] below).

Hakani has said in his poem that a house with a ''hilye'' will be protected from trouble. Another motivation would have been the hadith given by Hakani in the Hilye-i Şerif, which states that those who read and memorize Muhammad's ''hilye'' will attain great rewards in this and the other world, will see Muhammad in their dreams, will be protected from many disasters, and will receive Muhammad's esteem.

In the "sebeb-i te'lîf" ve "hâtime" section of the ''hilye'', the writer gives the reasons to write the ''hilye''. Hakani wrote that his reason was to be worthy of Muhammad's holy intercession (''shefaat'') on doomsday and to receive a prayer from willing readers. Other ''hilye'' writers express, usually at the end of the ''hilye'', their desire to be commended to the esteem of Muhammad, the other prophets, or the four caliphs. One ''hilye'' writer, Hakim, wrote that he wishes that people will remember Muhammad as they look at his ''hilye''.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt;

Hakani's Hilye-i Şerif has been an object of affection to many Turkish people. His poem has been copied on paper as well as on wooden panels by many calligraphers and has been read with the accompaniment of music in [[Mawlid]] ceremonies.&lt;ref name="derman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poyraz"&gt;{{cite journal| author= Poyraz, Yakup| title= Hâkim Seyyid Mehmed Efendi'nin "Nazire-i Hilye-i Hâkanî" Adlı Eseri | journal= Turkish Studies | issue= 2/3 | pages= 449–484 | year= 2007 | url= | language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Ottoman forms===
{{Muhammad}}
As an art form, ''hilye'' has mostly been restricted to Ottoman lands. A small number of instances of ''hilye'' panels were made in Iran,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=حِليهنويسى | publisher=Encyclopaedia Islamica | author= | accessdate=2012-01-20 | url=http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=6490 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524004312/http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=6490 | archivedate=2014-05-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they reflect a Shiite adaptation of the form: there is a Persian translation below the Arabic text and the names of the [[Twelve Imams]] are listed. In the 19th century, some Iranian ''hilyes'' combined the traditional ''hilye'' format with the Iranian tradition of pictorial representation of Muhammad and Ali.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hilye_Iran_19th_c_with_image.JPG this image] for an example.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oleg"&gt;{{cite journal| title= The Story of Portraits of the Prophet Muhammad| author=Grabar, O | journal= Écriture, Calligraphie et Peinture | issue= | year=2003 | pages=19–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are contemporary exponents of the art outside this region, such as the [[Pakistan]]i calligrapher [[Rasheed Butt]] and the American calligrapher [[Mohamed Zakariya]].&lt;ref name="Ernst2004"/&gt;

===Traditions===
In Turkey, giving a ''hilye'' panel as a marriage gift for the happiness of the union and safety of the home has been a tradition that is disappearing.&lt;ref name="derman"/&gt; Covering such panels with sheer curtains was part of the religious folklore in Istanbul households.&lt;ref name="derman"/&gt;

Since Osman's time, every Turkish calligrapher has been expected to produce at least one ''hilye'', using the three ''muhaqqaq'', ''thuluth'' and ''naskh'' scripts.&lt;ref name=Ali8/&gt; It is a common tradition for masters of calligraphy to obtain their diploma of competency (''icazetname'') after completing a ''hilye'' panel as their final assignment.&lt;ref name="derman"/&gt;

The art of ''hilye'' flourishes in Turkey. Contemporary artists continue to create ''hilyes'' in the classical form as well as to innovate. Modern ''hilyes'' maintain the essence of a ''hilye'', even while the appearance of the elements of the ''hilye'' is customized or calligraphy is used to create abstract or figurative works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Conoscere la Turchia a Roma | publisher= Piu Culture | url= http://www.piuculture.it/2011/10/conoscere-la-turchia-a-roma/ | accessdate= 2012-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary ''hilyes'' are exhibited in major exhibitions in Turkey as well as outside the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Vatican to host Turkish exhibition at Cancellaria | publisher= Hürriyet Daily News | url= http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=vatican-to-host-turkish-exhibition-at-cancellaria-2011-09-29 | accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Masterpieces of calligraphy art on view at Yıldız Palace | publisher= Hürriyet Daily News | url= http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/masterpieces-of-calligraphy-art-on-view-at-yildiz-palace.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=6906&amp;NewsCatID=385 | accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological opinion==
According to the Süleymaniye Vakfı, a [[Salafi]] influenced religious foundation in Turkey that publishes religious opinions ([[fatwa]]), ''hilye'' panels are works of art, but hanging them in the home has no religious value. That is, they provide no merit to those who hang them or carry them on their persons, and those who do not possess them have no deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Hilye-i Şerif nedir? Bunu üzerimizde taşımak sevap mıdır? | author=Süleymaniye Vakfı | date= 3 March 2011 | url= http://www.fetva.net/yazili-fetvalar/hilye-i-serif-nedir-bunu-uzerimizde-tasimak-sevap-midir.html| accessdate=2012-01-19 | language = Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A key hilye in poetry: Hilye-i Şerif==
{{Wikisource|1=Translation of an excerpt from the "Hilya-i Sharifa"|2=Hilye-i Şerif}}
''[[Hilye-i Şerif]]'' ("The Noble Description", 1598–1599) by [[Mehmet Hakani]], consisting of 712 verses, lists Muhammad's features as reported by Ali (see quotation in the [[#Origins|Origins]] section above), then comments on each of them in 12-20 verses.&lt;ref name="Gibb"&gt;{{cite book| title= A history of Ottoman poetry, Volume 3| author= Elias John Wilkinson Gibb| publisher= Luzac | year=1904 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MSxkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some have found it to be of not great poetic merit, it was popular due to its subject matter.&lt;ref name="Gibb"/&gt; The poem is significant for having established the genre of ''hilye''. Later ''hilye'' writers such as [[Cevri İbrahim Çelebi|Cevri]], [[Nesati]] and [[Süleyman Nahifi|Nafihi]] have praised Hakani and stated that they were following in his footsteps.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt; The poem contains several themes detailed below that underscore the importance of reading and writing about the attributes of Muhammad.

In his ''hilye'', Hakani mentions the following hadith, which he attributes to Ali:&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt; A short time before Muhammad's death, when his crying daughter Fatima said to him: "Ya Rasul-Allah, I will not be able to see your face any more!" Muhammad commanded, "Ya Ali, write down my appearance, for seeing my qualities is like seeing myself." The origin of this hadith is not known. Although probably [[apocryphal]], it has had a fundamental effect on the development of the ''hilye'' genre. This hadith has been repeated by most other ''hilye'' writers.&lt;ref name="Yazar"/&gt;

Hakani states another hadith, also attributed to Ali. This hadith of unknown origin is said to have been in circulation since the 9th century&lt;ref name=Soucek&gt;{{cite journal |author=Soucek, Priscilla |year= 2000 |title= The Theory and Practice of Portraiture in the Persian Tradition |journal= Muqarnas |volume= 17 |issue= |pages= 97–108 |publisher= |doi= 10.1163/22118993-90000008|pmid= |pmc= |url= http://cmes.hmdc.harvard.edu/files/Roxburgh_Reading1.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but is not found in the reliable hadith collections.&lt;ref name=Zakariya&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Hilye of the Prophet Muhammad |last=Zakariya |first=Mohamed |authorlink=Mohamed Zakariya |date=2003–2004 |journal=Seasons |publisher=Zaytuna Institute |pages=13–22 |url=http://zakariya.net/resources/hilye.pdf |accessdate=August 22, 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202234841/http://zakariya.net/resources/hilye.pdf |archivedate=December 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated in other ''hilyes'' after Hakani's, this hadith has been influential in the establishment of the genre.:&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gruber132 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ernst2004"&gt;{{cite book |title= Following Muhammad: Rethinking Islam in the Contemporary World |last=Ernst |first= Carl W. |authorlink=Carl W.

{{quotation|For him who sees my ''hilye'' after my death, it is as if he had seen me myself, and he who sees it, longing for me, for him God will make [[Jahannam|Hell]] prohibited, and he will not be resurrected naked on the [[Qiyamah|Day of Judgement]].}}

Hakani's ''hilye'' includes a story about a poor man coming to the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]] and presenting him a piece of paper on which Muhammad's ''hilye'' is written. Al-Rashid is so delighted to see this that he regales the dervish and rewards him with sacs of jewelry. At night, he sees Muhammad in his dream. Muhammad says to him "you received and honored this poor man, so I will make you happy. God gave me the good news that whoever looks at my ''hilye'' and gets delight from it, presses it to his chest and protects it like his life, will be protected from hellfires on Doomsday; he will not suffer in this world nor in the other. You will be worthy of the sight of my face, and even more, of my holy lights."&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt;

It has become customary for other ''hilye'' authors that followed Hakani to mention in the introduction of their ''hilye'' (called ''havas-i hilye'') the hadith that seeing Muhammad in one's dream is the same as seeing him. The Harun Al-Rashid story has also been mentioned frequently by other authors as well.&lt;ref name="ispirli"&gt;{{cite journal| title= Mustafa Fehmi Gerçeker'in Hilye-i Fahr-ı Âlem İsimli Eseri Üzerine | author= İspirli, S.A.| year= 2010 | journal= Turkısh Studies | issue=2 | pages= 21–36| url=http://dokuman.tsadergisi.org/dergiler_pdf/2010/2010-Agustos/7.pdf | language = Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt; These elements from Hakani's ''hilye'' have established the belief that reading and writing ''hilyes'' protects the person from all trouble, in this world as well as the next.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1970">'''Infiltration Art''' is a branch of [[Intervention art|Intervention Art]] in which artists collaborate with institutions, communities, politicians, religions, museums and pop-culture figures outside of the traditional art world. Unlike other forms of intervention art, Infiltration Art seeks to create symbiotic relationships with the host institutions.

Artists whose work incorporates elements of infiltration include [[Banksy]], Christian Cummings, [[Nikki S. Lee]], [[Taryn Simon]], [[Jeffrey Vallance]], [[David Hildebrand Wilson]], [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]], the Nationwide Museum Mascot Project (NWMMP).

==Career==
After the loss of her boyfriend at age 20,&lt;ref name="Flynn" /&gt; Lee became closer to her sister Amy.

In March 2011, Johnston called Lee to ask her to join him at Disney Animation in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] to help him write ''Wreck-It Ralph''.&lt;ref name=LAWQueen /&gt; What was supposed to be a temporary eight-week writing gig eventually turned into a much longer commitment.&lt;ref name=LAWQueen /&gt; First, she was asked to stay on until ''Ralph'' was finished.&lt;ref name=LAWQueen /&gt; She then became involved with [[Frozen (2013 film)|''Frozen'']], initially as screenwriter and later as co-director with [[Chris Buck]].&lt;ref name=LAWQueen /&gt; When Lee was brought on board, she helped transition the film from an action-adventure to "more musical, with more comedy."&lt;ref name=FCReinvented&gt;{{cite web|last=Laporte |first=Nicole |title=How "Frozen" Director Jennifer Lee Reinvented the Story of the Snow Queen |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3027019/most-creative-people/how-frozen-director-jennifer-lee-reinvented-the-story-of-the-snow-queen |publisher=Fast Company |accessdate=April 29, 2014 |date=February 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314091751/http://www.fastcompany.com/3027019/most-creative-people/how-frozen-director-jennifer-lee-reinvented-the-story-of-the-snow-queen |archivedate=March 14, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked closely with the songwriters ([[Robert Lopez]] and [[Kristen Anderson-Lopez]]) in the writing of the script.&lt;ref name=FCReinvented /&gt; ''Frozen'' gave her the opportunity to celebrate "wild and wonderful" girls like her childhood self, and her daughter, Agatha.&lt;ref name=FCReinvented /&gt; It was also the highest-earning film with a female director in terms of domestic earnings, until surpassed by [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.womenandhollywood.com/wonder-woman-is-now-the-top-female-helmed-film-at-the-domestic-box-office-f38eba286f3b |title="Wonder Woman" Is Now the Top Female-Helmed Film at the Domestic Box Office |publisher=Blog.womenandhollywood.com |date= |accessdate=2017-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724160242/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/07/24/wonder-woman-sequel-title-revealed.html |archive-date=July 24, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[knew] better than to waste a second doubting."&lt;ref name="UNH" /&gt;{{rp|6:18}}  Years later, that memory would help her overcome her initial doubt over whether she was good enough to apply to Columbia.&lt;ref name="UNH" /&gt;{{rp|7:10}} At Columbia, Johnston recognized she was talented but insecure, and one day asked her to "promise ... that you'll leave it out of your work, just know that you're good enough and move on."&lt;ref name="Sanborn" /&gt;  She concluded: "If I learned one thing it is that self-doubt is one of the most destructive forces. It makes you defensive instead of open, reactive instead of active. Self-doubt is consuming and cruel and my hope today is that we can all collectively agree to ban it ... Please know, from here on out, you are enough and dare I say, more than enough."&lt;ref name="Sanborn" /&gt;  UNH then awarded her the honorary degree of [[Doctor of Humane Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anonymous|title=Honorary degrees conferred at UNH|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article/20140517/NEWS04/140519174|accessdate=May 18, 2014|newspaper=New Hampshire Union-Leader|date=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, it was announced that Lee and Buck would co-direct a [[short film]] featuring the ''Frozen'' characters called ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.

''A Wrinkle in Time'' was released in March 2018, but Lee's removal of all Christian references from the story caused a backlash and boycott from several Christian groups, including the online film reviewing site [[MovieGuide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/ava-duvernay-wrinkle-in-time-movie-1201712895/|title=Ava DuVernay to Direct 'A Wrinkle in Time' Movie Adaptation|author=McNary, Dave|date=February 23, 2016|accessdate=2016-03-14|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/11/ava-duvernay-a-wrinkle-in-time-release-date-1201854261/|title=Ava DuVernay's 'A Wrinkle In Time' To Hit Theaters In Spring 2018|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|date=November 14, 2016|accessdate=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received mixed reviews from the critics, and despite grossing $100 million domestically, ended its run as a box-office bomb.

[[File:ModernEgypt, Khedivial Opera House, BAP 25803.jpg|thumb|240px|The Khedivial Opera House.]]
The '''Khedivial Opera House''' or '''Royal Opera House''' ({{lang-ar|دار الأوبرا الخديوية }} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''Dār Awbirā al-Khudaywī'') was an opera house in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], the oldest opera house in all of Africa. It was inaugurated on 1 November 1869 and burned down on 28 October  1971.

The opera house was built on the orders of the [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail]] to celebrate the opening of the [[Suez Canal]].  The architects [[Pietro Avoscani]] (from [[Livorno]]) and Rossi&lt;!--need first name--&gt; designed the building.  It seated approximately 850 people and was made mostly of wood.  It was located between the districts of [[Azbakeya]] and Ismailyya&lt;!--Do we have an article on this place?--&gt; in Egypt's capital city.

[[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Rigoletto]]'' was the first opera performed at the opera house on 1 November 1869.  Ismail planned a grander exhibition for his new theatre.  After months of delay due to the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Verdi's new opera, ''[[Aida]]'', received its world premiere at the Khedivial Opera House on 24 December 1871.

In the early morning hours of 28 October 1971, the opera house burned to the ground.  The all-wooden building was quickly consumed, and only two statues made by [http://www.fineart.gov.eg/eng/cv/cv.asp?IDS=323 Mohamed Hassan] survived.  

After the original opera house was destroyed, Cairo was without an opera house for nearly two decades until the opening of the new [[Cairo Opera House]] in 1988.

The site of the Khedivial Opera House has been rebuilt into a multi-story concrete car garage. The square (to the south of Al Ataba metro station) overlooking the building's location, is still called Opera Square (Meidan El Opera)

'''''Knocked Up''''' is a 2007 American [[romantic comedy]] film written, directed, and co-produced by [[Judd Apatow]], and starring [[Seth Rogen]], [[Katherine Heigl]], [[Paul Rudd]], and [[Leslie Mann]]. It follows the repercussions of a drunken [[one-night stand]] between a [[slacker]] and a just-promoted [[media personality]] that results in an [[unintended pregnancy]].

The film was released on June 1, 2007 to box office success, grossing $219 million worldwide, and acclaim from critics. A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[sequel]], ''[[This Is 40]]'', was released in 2012.

==Plot==
Alison Scott ([[Katherine Heigl]]) is a career-minded woman who has just been given an on-air role with [[E!]] and is living in the pool house with her sister Debbie's ([[Leslie Mann]]) family. Ben Stone ([[Seth Rogen]]) is laid-back and sardonic. He lives off funds received in compensation for an injury and sporadically works on a celebrity porn website with his roommates ([[Jay Baruchel]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Jason Segel]] and [[Martin Starr]]), in between smoking marijuana or going off with them at theme parks such as [[Knott's Berry Farm]]. While celebrating her promotion, Alison meets Ben at a local nightclub. After a night of drinking, they end up having sex. Due to a misunderstanding, they don't use protection: Alison uses the phrase "Just do it already" to encourage Ben to put the condom on, but he misinterprets this to mean to dispense with using one. The following morning, they quickly learn over breakfast that they have little in common and go their separate ways, which leaves Ben visibly upset.

Eight weeks later, Alison experiences [[morning sickness]] during an interview with [[James Franco]] and realizes she could be pregnant. She contacts Ben for the first time since their one-night stand to tell him. Although insensitive at first, Ben says he will be there to support Alison. While he is still unsure about being a parent, his father ([[Harold Ramis]]) is excited. Alison's mother ([[Joanna Kerns]]) tries to persuade her daughter to have an abortion, but Alison decides to keep the child. Later, Alison and Ben decide to give a relationship a chance. The couple's efforts include Ben making an awkward marriage proposal with an empty ring box, promising to get her one someday. Alison thinks it's too early to think about marriage, because she is more concerned with hiding the pregnancy from her bosses, believing that they will fire her if they ever found out. After a somewhat promising beginning, tensions surface in the relationship.

Alison is increasingly worried about Ben's lack of responsibility and commitment, and has doubts about the longevity of their relationship. These thoughts are due to her sister's unhappy marriage. Debbie's husband, Pete ([[Paul Rudd]]), works as a talent scout for rock bands, but he leaves at odd hours in the night, which makes her suspect he is having an affair. Upon investigating, she learns that he is actually part of a [[fantasy baseball]] draft, and that he has been doing other activities such as going to the movies on his own, which he explains he participates in to be free from Debbie's controlling manner. This results in their separation, and when Ben expresses amusement at Pete's deception, it leads to a heated argument with Alison as they drive to her doctor. Angered, she ejects him from her car and abandons him in the middle of a busy street. He tracks her down to her appointment and they both start another argument, leading to their own breakup. Ben and Pete decide to go on a road trip to [[Las Vegas]].

Under the heavy influence of [[Psilocybe cubensis|psychedelic mushrooms]], they realize their loss and decide to take responsibility for their relationships. Simultaneously, Debbie drags a timid Alison out partying with her, but they are refused admission to a nightclub by its apologetic bouncer ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) on account of Debbie's age and Alison's pregnancy, leading to Debbie's tearful laments about her life and her desire to have Pete back. They reconcile at their daughter's birthday party, but when Ben tries to work things out with Alison, she doesn't want to get back together. Alison's boss finds out about her pregnancy, and sees an opportunity to boost ratings with female viewers by having Alison interview pregnant celebrities. After a talk with his father, Ben decides to take responsibility and goes to great effort to change his ways, including moving out of his friends' house, getting an office job as a web designer, and creating a baby's room in his new apartment.

He also starts reading the pregnancy books that he had purchased early on. When Alison goes into labor and is unable to contact her doctor, she calls Ben, as Debbie and Pete are at [[Legoland California Resort|Legoland]]. Ben discovers that the [[gynecologist]] they had been seeing ([[Loudon Wainwright III|Loudon Wainwright]]) is out of town, at 
a Bar Mitzvah, despite having assured them that he never took vacations. Ben calls him and leaves a furious voicemail, threatening murder. During labor, Alison apologizes for doubting Ben's commitment and admits that she never thought the man who got her pregnant would be the right one for her. When Debbie and Pete arrive at the hospital, Ben adamantly refuses to allow her to be at Alison's side, insisting that it's his place. Debbie is both furious and impressed that Ben took charge of the situation and begins to change her formerly negative opinion about him. The couple welcomes a baby girl (a boy in the alternate ending) and settle down happily together in a new apartment in [[Los Angeles]].

==Production==

===Casting===
Several of the major cast members return from previous [[Judd Apatow]] projects: [[Seth Rogen]], [[Martin Starr]], [[Jason Segel]], and [[James Franco]] all starred in the short-lived, cult television series ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' which Apatow produced. From the Apatow-created ''[[Undeclared]]'' (which also featured Rogen, Segel and Starr) there are [[Jay Baruchel]] and [[Loudon Wainwright III]]. [[Paul Feig]], who co-created ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'', starred in the Apatow-written movie ''[[Heavyweights]]'' and directed the Apatow-produced ''[[Bridesmaids]]'' also makes a brief cameo as the Fantasy Baseball Guy. [[Steve Carell]], who makes a cameo appearance as himself, played the main role in Apatow's ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'' which also starred Rogen and Rudd, as well as appearing in the Apatow-produced ''[[Anchorman (film)|Anchorman]]''. Finally, [[Leslie Mann]], who also appeared in ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'', is married to Apatow and their two daughters play her children in the movie.

[[Anne Hathaway]] was originally cast in the role of Alison in the film, but dropped out due to creative reasons&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-katherineheiglknockedup,0,4692586.story 'Grey's' Star Heigl Gets 'Knocked Up',https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeIxVH_epvI ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509022240/http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-katherineheiglknockedup%2C0%2C4692586.story |date=May 9, 2007 }}.

The closing credits roll over cast members' baby photos. The image of Joanna Kerns as a young mother was previously famous from its use in opening credits of ''[[Growing Pains]]''’ first few seasons.

[[Bennett Miller]], the director of ''[[Capote (film)|Capote]]'', appears in a [[mockumentary]] DVD feature called "Directing the Director", in which he is allegedly hired by the studio to supervise Apatow's work, but only interferes with it, eventually leading the two into a [[fist fight]].

"Among last year's May and June openers, only "Knocked Up" lasted in the top 10 for eight weeks."&lt;/ref&gt; A company that specializes in tracking responses to advertising spanning multiple types of media attributed the film's [[sleeper hit|unexpected financial success]] to the use of radio and television ads in combination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release.do?id=756730 Radio Advertising Helps Wake Up Sleeper ''Knocked Up''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221073600/http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release.do?id=756730 |date=December 21, 2007 }}, an August 2007 press release by Integrated Media Measurements Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The website's critical consensus reads, "''Knocked Up'' is a hilarious, poignant and refreshing look at the rigors of courtship and child-rearing, with a sometimes raunchy, yet savvy script that is ably acted and directed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Knocked Up (2007)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/knocked_up|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |accessdate=June 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 85 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/knocked-up |title=Knocked Up Reviews |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213115937/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/knocked-up |archivedate=December 13, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the film's humor despite its plot inconsistencies, noting that, "probably because the central story doesn't quite gel, it's the loony, incidental throwaway moments that really make an impression."&lt;ref&gt;Chocano, Carina.

But the laughs are plentiful, and it's the rare movie these days where one doesn't feel guilty about finding the whole thing funny."&lt;ref&gt;Kaltenbach, Chris.

A more critical review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine noted that, although a typical Hollywood-style comedic farce, the unexpected short-term success of the film may be more attributable to a sociological phenomenon rather than the quality or uniqueness of the film ''per se'', positing that the movie's shock value, sexual humor and historically taboo themes may have created a brief nationwide discussion in which movie-goers would see the film "so they can join the debate, if only to say it wasn't that good."&lt;ref&gt;Corliss, Richard.

===Alleged copyright infringement===
Canadian author [[Rebecca Eckler]] wrote in ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine about the similarities between the movie and her book, ''Knocked Up: Confessions of a Hip Mother-to-Be'', which was released in the U.S. in March 2005. She pursued legal action against Apatow and Universal Pictures on the basis of copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;Eckler, Rebecca: [http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070611_106143_106143 "Is That my Baby on the Screen"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609145837/http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070611_106143_106143 |date=June 9, 2007 }}, page 69-71.

===Accusations of sexism===
[[Mike White (scriptwriter)|Mike White]] (longtime associate of [[Judd Apatow]] and screenwriter for ''[[School of Rock]]'', ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'', ''[[Orange County (film)|Orange County]]'', and ''[[Nacho Libre]]'') is said to have been "disenchanted" by Apatow's later films, "objecting to the treatment of women and gay men in Apatow's recent movies", saying of ''Knocked Up'', "At some point it starts feeling like comedy of the bullies, rather than the bullied."&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''.

In early reviews, both ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''{{'s}} Dana Stevens and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}} Carina Chocano wrote articles claiming the film propagated sexist attitudes, a topic which was the primary focus of a ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine [[podcast]] in which ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' editor [[Emily Nussbaum]] said: "Alison [Heigl's character] made basically zero sense. She was just a completely inconsistent character.... she was this pleasant, blandly hot, peculiarly tolerant, yet oddly ''blank'' nice girl. She seemed to have no actual needs or desires of her own...."&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''.

In a later ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' interview, lead actress [[Katherine Heigl]] admitted that though she enjoyed working with Apatow and Rogen, she had a hard time enjoying the film itself, calling it "a little sexist" and claiming that the film "paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Katherine Heigl Talks About Marriage, Ratings Ploys, and Why She Thinks Knocked Up Is Sexist|publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=December 3, 2007|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/services/presscenter/pressrelease/katherine_heigl200801|accessdate=2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press.

[[Meghan O'Rourke]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' called Heigl's comments unsurprising, noting "''Knocked Up'' was, as [[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] put it in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', the culminating artifact in what had become 'the dominant romantic-comedy trend of the past several years—the slovenly hipster and the female straight arrow.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;O'Rourke, Meghan.

''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that Heigl's comments "provoked quite a backlash, and Heigl was described as ungrateful and a traitor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2266494,00.html | title=Joker in the Pack | accessdate=2008-04-09 | date=19 March 2008 | work=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=Emine | last=Saner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of mounting accusations of sexism, director [[Judd Apatow]] discussed ways he might develop more authentic female characters.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;Wloszczyna, Susan.

Retrieved June 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, while promoting their film ''[[Funny People]]'' Apatow and Rogen appeared on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' and defended the work in ''Knocked Up'', disagreeing with the position Heigl had stated. Rogen pointed to Heigl's work in the film ''[[The Ugly Truth (film)|The Ugly Truth]]'' to illustrate his point. Rogen said: "I hear there's a scene where she's wearing underwear with a vibrator in it, so I'd have to see if that is uplifting for women." Apatow remarked on Heigl's criticisms, stating that he had expected an apology from Heigl. "You would think at some point I'd get a call saying she was sorry, that she was tired, and then the call never comes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/07/31/2009-07-31_seth_rogen_director_judd_apatow_slam_knocked_up_costar_katherine_heigl.html | title=Taste of her own Medicine? | work = [[Daily News (New York)]]|author=Chernikoff, Leah | date=July 31, 2009|accessdate = June 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Rogen again spoke to [[Howard Stern]] about how he had felt hurt and somewhat betrayed back then by Heigl's comments. He went on to talk about what a great rapport they'd had on set while working together, and that at the time he had even envisioned making many more movies with her. Though Rogen wishes she would have apologized to him personally as opposed to publicly, he affirmed that he still really liked her, and that he never would have wanted the incident to hurt her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/seth-rogen-katherine-heigl-knocked-up-feud-918640 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011162016/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/seth-rogen-katherine-heigl-knocked-up-feud-918640 |archivedate=October 11, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heigl responded by saying that Rogen had "handled that so beautifully," and that she felt nothing but "love and respect" for him. "It was so long ago at this point, I just wish him so much goodness, and I felt that from him, too," she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/news/a22023/katherine-heigl-responds-to-seth-rogen/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917213749/http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/news/a22023/katherine-heigl-responds-to-seth-rogen/ |archivedate=September 17, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Santdomenec claustre1.jpg|thumb|right|Convent of Sant Doménec, in the city of Valencia.]]

The '''Levantino Gothic''' is the gothic style developed in former [[Crown of Aragon]], in the Mediterranean area of Spain, characterized by its halls and churches of great horizontal extent with emphasis on the structural part supported by buttresses and minimal and austere decorations.

The main differences with [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] Gothic are:

* Single nave instead of three, in case that there are, has the same height and the wider central.
* Chapels between the buttresses.
* Thinner supports.
* Low figurative decoration, dominated by the geometric type.
* Minor surface of openings, resulting in a low light penetration.

Very few examples of this style of architecture exist outside the larger Christian strongholds. The surrounding countryside was still being fought over by the Spanish Christians and Spanish Muslims (Moors). In the capital cities of Medieval mediterranean Christian kingdoms, cathedrals of this style were erected in the 13th and 14th centuries.

Many buildings of this architectural style can be found around the [[region of Valencia]] with its own style [[Valencian Gothic]] and across the [[Balearic Islands]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5743">In the [[United Kingdom government]], the '''Minister for the Arts''' is a ministerial post, usually a [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State|low]] to [[Minister of State|middle]]-ranking minister to the much senior [[Secretary of State]], who runs the entire department and is ultimately responsible for the department's brief.

The post has been in a variety of ministries, but after 1997 it has been a [[Minister of State]] position in the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]. From 1992 to 1997, the post was combined with the office of [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Secretary of State for National Heritage]]. The title of the post was changed to '''Minister for Culture''' in 2005, and to '''Minister for Culture, Creative Industries and Tourism''' in 2007. Under that last title, the office was held by [[Barbara Follett (politician)|Barbara Follett]] MP, who was appointed on 5 October 2008, until 22 September 2009.

[[Ed Vaizey]] was appointed by then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] to the position as '''Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries''' at [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] level, a post Vaizey initially split between the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS) and the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] (BIS), but is now entirely placed in the DCMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/mr-edward-vaizey/1580 |title=Mr Edward Vaizey |publisher = House of Commons |accessdate=15 March 2014 |website=parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Persepolis''' ({{lang-peo|𐎱𐎠𐎼𐎿}}, {{transl|peo|Pārsa}}) was the ceremonial capital of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] ({{nowrap|ca. 550–330 BCE}}). It is situated {{nowrap|60 km}} northeast of the city of [[Shiraz]] in [[Fars Province]], [[Iran]]. The earliest remains of Persepolis date back to 515 BCE. It exemplifies the [[Achaemenid architecture|Achaemenid style]] of architecture. [[UNESCO]] declared the ruins of Persepolis a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|title=Pasargadae|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|year=2006|accessdate=26 December 2010|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The English word ''{{lang|en|Persepolis}}'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''Persépolis'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:Περσέπολις|Περσέπολις]]}}), a compound of ''Pérsēs'' ({{lang|grc|Πέρσης}}) and ''pólis'' ({{lang|grc|πόλις}}), meaning "the Persian city" or "the city of the Persians". To the ancient Persians, the city was known as ''Pārsa'' ({{lang-peo|[[wikt:𐎱𐎠𐎼𐎿|𐎱𐎠𐎼𐎿]]}}), which is also the word for the region of [[Persis|Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, H.W.

==Geography==
Persepolis is near the small river Pulvar, which flows into the [[Kor River|Kur River]].

[[File:Persepolis east side at spring.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Ruins of the "Palace of [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]]", Persepolis. As is typical of Achaemenid cities, Persepolis was built on a (partially) artificial platform.]]

The site includes a 125,000&amp;nbsp;square meter terrace, partly artificially constructed and partly cut out of a mountain, with its east side leaning on [[Rahmat Mountain]]. The other three sides are formed by [[retaining wall]]s, which vary in height with the slope of the ground. Rising from {{convert|5-13|metres|abbr=off}} on the west side was a double stair. From there, it gently slopes to the top. To create the level terrace, depressions were filled with soil and heavy rocks, which were joined together with metal clips.

==History==
Archaeological evidence shows that the earliest remains of Persepolis date back to 515 BC. [[André Godard]], the French archaeologist who excavated Persepolis in the early 1930s, believed that it was [[Cyrus the Great]] who chose the site of Persepolis, but that it was [[Darius I]] who built the terrace and the palaces. Inscriptions on these buildings support the belief that they were constructed by Darius. 

With [[Darius I]], the scepter passed to a new branch of the royal house. Persepolis probably became the capital of Persia proper during his reign. However, the city's location in a remote and mountainous region made it an inconvenient residence for the rulers of the empire. The country's true capitals were [[Susa]], [[Babylon]] and [[Ecbatana]]. This may be why the Greeks were not acquainted with the city until [[Alexander the Great]] took and plundered it.

[[File:Plan of Persepolis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Aerial architectural plan of Persepolis.]]

Darius I's construction of Persepolis were carried out parallel to those of the [[Palace of Darius in Susa|Palace of Susa]].&lt;ref name=Perrot&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perrot|first1=Jean|title=The Palace of Darius at Susa: The Great Royal Residence of Achaemenid Persia|date=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781848856219|page=423|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fDimj7F2VVgC&amp;lpg=PA423|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gene R. Garthwaite, the Susa Palace served as Darius' model for Persepolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garthwaite|first1=Gene R.|title=The Persians|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781405144001|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=unG8_JqzYQQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA50|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darius I ordered the construction of the [[Apadana]] and the Council Hall (''Tripylon'' or the "Triple Gate"), as well as the main imperial Treasury and its surroundings. These were completed during the reign of his son, [[Xerxes I]]. Further construction of the buildings on the terrace continued until the downfall of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;2002. Guaitoli. M.T., &amp; Rambaldi, S. ''Lost Cities from the Ancient World''. White Star, spa. (2006 version published by Barnes &amp; Noble. Darius I founded Persepolis in 500 BC as the residence and ceremonial center of his dynasty. p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the Greek historian [[Ctesias]] mentioned that Darius I's grave was in a cliff face that could be reached with an apparatus of ropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Persepolis|title=Persepolis|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 519 BC, construction of a broad stairway was begun. The stairway was initially planned to be the main entrance to the terrace {{convert|20|metres|abbr=off}} above the ground. The dual stairway, known as the Persepolitan Stairway, was built symmetrically on the western side of the Great Wall. The 111 steps measured {{convert|6.9|metres|abbr=off}} wide, with treads of {{convert|31|cm|abbr=off}} and rises of {{convert|10|cm|abbr=off}}. Originally, the steps were believed to have been constructed to allow for nobles and royalty to ascend by horseback. New theories, however, suggest that the shallow risers allowed visiting dignitaries to maintain a regal appearance while ascending. The top of the stairways led to a small yard in the north-eastern side of the terrace, opposite the [[Gate of All Nations]].

Grey [[limestone]] was the main building material used at Persepolis. After natural rock had been leveled and the depressions filled in, the terrace was prepared. Major tunnels for sewage were dug underground through the rock. A large elevated water storage tank was carved at the eastern foot of the mountain. Professor Olmstead suggested the [[cistern]] was constructed at the same time that construction of the towers began.

The uneven plan of the terrace, including the foundation, acted like a castle, whose angled walls enabled its defenders to target any section of the external front. [[Diodorus Siculus]] writes that Persepolis had three walls with ramparts, which all had towers to provide a protected space for the defense personnel. The first wall was {{convert|7|metres|abbr=off}} tall, the second, {{convert|14|metres|abbr=off}} and the third wall, which covered all four sides, was {{convert|27|metres|abbr=off}} in height, though no presence of the wall exists in modern times.

===Function===
The function of Persepolis remains rather unclear. It was not one of the largest cities in Persia, let alone the rest of the empire, but appears to have been a grand ceremonial complex, that was only occupied seasonally; it is still not entirely clear where the king's private quarters actually were.  Until recent challenges, most archaeologists held that it was especially used for celebrating [[Nowruz]], the Persian New Year, held at the spring [[equinox]], and still an important annual festivity in modern Iran. The Iranian nobility and the tributary parts of the empire came to present gifts to the king, as represented in the stairway reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Mousavi, Ali, ''Persepolis: Discovery and Afterlife of a World Wonder'', p. 53, 2012, Walter de Gruyter, {{ISBN|1614510334}}, 9781614510338, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KorZMqmTOJgC&amp;pg=PA53 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destruction===
After [[Wars of Alexander the Great#End of the Achaemenid Empire|invading Achaemenid Persia]] in 330 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] sent the main force of his army to Persepolis by the [[Royal Road]]. He [[Battle of the Persian Gate|stormed]] the "[[Persian Gates]]", a pass through modern-day [[Zagros Mountains]]. There [[Ariobarzanes of Persis]] successfully ambushed Alexander the Great's army, inflicting heavy casualties. After being held off for 30 days, Alexander the Great outflanked and destroyed the defenders. Ariobarzanes himself was killed either during the battle or during the retreat to Persepolis. Some sources indicate that the Persians were betrayed by a captured tribal chief who showed the Macedonians an alternate path that allowed them to outflank Ariobarzanes in a reversal of [[Thermopylae]]. After several months, Alexander allowed his troops to loot Persepolis.
[[File:Italian - Plate with Overhanging Edge - Walters 481364 - Obverse.jpg|thumb|Alexander the Great ordering Persepolis to be set on fire;  Italian plate, 1534 (although it may be a depiction of the burning of Rome by [[Nero]]).]]

Around that time, a fire burned "the palaces" or "the palace". Scholars agree that this event, described in historic sources, occurred at the ruins that have been now re-identified as Persepolis. From Stolze's investigations, it appears that at least one of these, the castle built by Xerxes I, bears traces of having been destroyed by fire. The locality described by [[Diodorus Siculus]] after [[Cleitarchus]] corresponds in important particulars with the historic Persepolis, for example, in being supported by the mountain on the east.

It is believed that the fire which destroyed Persepolis started from Hadish Palace, which was the living quarters of [[Xerxes I]], and spread to the rest of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.toiran.com/en/directory/shiraz-persepolis-339 | work=toiran.com | title=Persepolis | accessdate=2015-01-02 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205211047/http://www.toiran.com/en/directory/shiraz-persepolis-339 | archivedate=5 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear if the fire was an accident or a deliberate act of revenge for the burning of the [[Acropolis of Athens]] during the [[second Persian invasion of Greece]]. Many historians argue that, while Alexander's army celebrated with a [[symposium]], they decided to take revenge against the Persians.&lt;ref name="The Chronology"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chronology of Ancient Nations|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7661-8908-9|page=484|author=Sachau, C. Edward}} p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; If that is so, then the destruction of Persepolis could be both an accident and a case of revenge.

The ''[[Book of Arda Viraf|Book of Arda Wiraz]]'', a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] work composed in the 3rd or 4th century, describes Persepolis' archives as containing "all the [[Avesta]] and [[Zend]], written upon prepared cow-skins, and with gold ink", which were destroyed. Indeed, in his ''Chronology of the Ancient Nations'', the native Iranian writer [[Biruni]] indicates unavailability of certain native Iranian historiographical sources in the post-Achaemenid era, especially during the [[Parthian Empire]]. He adds: "[Alexander] burned the whole of Persepolis as revenge to the Persians, because it seems the Persian King Xerxes had burnt the Greek City of Athens around 150 years ago. People say that, even at the present time, the traces of fire are visible in some places."&lt;ref name="The Chronology" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Al-Beruni and Persepolis|journal=Acta Iranica|volume=1|place=Leiden|year=1974|isbn=978-90-04-03900-1|pages=137–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, the event that caused the destruction of these texts may have resulted in the preservation of the [[Persepolis Administrative Archives]], which might otherwise have been lost over time to natural and man-made events.&lt;ref name="Wiesehöfer 10-11"&gt;Wiesehöfer 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; According to archaeological evidence, the partial burning of Persepolis did not affect what are now referred to as the ''Persepolis Fortification Archive'' tablets, but rather may have caused the eventual collapse of the upper part of the northern fortification wall that preserved the tablets until their recovery by the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]]'s archaeologists.&lt;ref name="Henkelman 2008:Ch 2"&gt;Henkelman 2008:Ch 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire===
[[File:Persepolis east side-02 at spring.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the Western side of the compound at Persepolis.]]
In 316 BC, Persepolis was still the capital of Persia as a province of the great [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian Empire]] (see Diod. xix, 21 seq., 46; probably after [[Hieronymus of Cardia]], who was living about 326). The city must have gradually declined in the course of time. The lower city at the foot of the imperial city might have survived for a longer time;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/As/Iran/Fars/Persepolis.htm|title=Persepolis|publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ruins of the Achaemenids remained as a witness to its ancient glory. It is probable that the principal town of the country, or at least of the district, was always in this neighborhood.

About 200 BC, the city of [[Istakhr|Estakhr]], five kilometers north of Persepolis, was the seat of the local governors. From there, the foundations of the second great Persian Empire were laid, and there Estakhr acquired special importance as the center of priestly wisdom and orthodoxy. The Sasanian kings have covered the face of the rocks in this neighborhood, and in part even the Achaemenid ruins, with their sculptures and inscriptions. They must themselves have been built largely there, although never on the same scale of magnificence as their ancient predecessors. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] knew as little about Estakhr as the Greeks had known about Persepolis, despite the fact that the Sasanians maintained relations for four hundred years, friendly or hostile, with the empire.

At the time of the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Muslim invasion of Persia]], Estakhr offered a desperate resistance. It was still a place of considerable importance in the first century of [[Islam]], although its greatness was speedily eclipsed by the new metropolis of [[Shiraz]]. In the 10th century, Estakhr dwindled to insignificance, as seen from the descriptions of [[Estakhri]], a native (c. 950), and of [[Al-Muqaddasi]] (c. 985). During the following centuries, Estakhr gradually declined, until it ceased to exist as a city.

The fruitful region was covered with villages until its frightful devastation in the 18th century; and even now it is, comparatively speaking, well cultivated. The Castle of Estakhr played a conspicuous part as a strong fortress, several times, during the Muslim period. It was the middlemost and the highest of the three steep crags which rise from the valley of the [[Kur]], at some distance to the west or northwest of the necropolis of [[Naqsh-e Rustam]].

French voyagers [[Eugène Flandin]] and [[Pascal Coste]] are among the first to provide not only a literary review of the structure of Persepolis, but also to create some of the best and earliest visual depictions of its structure. In their publications in [[Paris]], in 1881 and 1882, titled ''Voyages en Perse de MM. Eugene Flanin peintre et Pascal Coste architecte'', the authors provided some 350 ground breaking illustrations of Persepolis.&lt;ref name=ali/&gt; French influence and interest in Persia's archaeological findings would not end until the time of [[Reza Shah]], when such distinguished figures as [[André Godard]] helped create Iran's first heritage museum.

Throughout the 1800s and early 1900s, a variety of amateur digging occurred at the site, in some cases on a large scale.&lt;ref name=ali&gt;Ali Mousavi, Persepolis in Retrospect: Histories of Discovery and Archaeological Exploration at the ruins of ancient Passch, Ars Orientalis, vol. 32, pp. 209-251, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The first scientific excavations at Persepolis were carried out by [[Ernst Herzfeld]] and [[Erich Schmidt (archaeologist)|Erich Schmidt]] representing the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] of the [[University of Chicago]]. They conducted excavations for eight seasons, beginning in 1930, and included other nearby sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/saoc5.pdf] Ernst E Herzfeld, ''A New Inscription of Xerxes from Persepolis'', ''Studies in Ancient Oriental Civilization,'' vol. 5, 1932&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oip68.pdf] Erich F Schmidt, ''Persepolis I: Structures, Reliefs, Inscriptions'', Oriental Institute Publications, vol. 68, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oip69.pdf] Erich F Schmidt, ''Persepolis II: Contents of the Treasury and Other Discoveries,'' Oriental Institute Publications, vol. 69, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oip70.pdf] Erich F Schmidt, ''Persepolis III: The Royal Tombs and Other Monuments'', Oriental Institute Publications, vol. 70, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oic21.pdf] Erich F Schmidt, ''The Treasury of Persepolis and Other Discoveries in the Homeland of the Achaemenians'', Oriental Institute Communications, vol. 21, 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Persian frieze designs at Persepolis.jpg|thumb|Achaemenid [[frieze]] designs at Persepolis.]]
Herzfeld believed that the reasons behind the construction of Persepolis were the need for a majestic atmosphere, a symbol for the empire, and to celebrate special events, especially the ''[[Nowruz]]''.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt; For historical reasons, Persepolis was built where the Achaemenid dynasty was founded, although it was not the center of the empire at that time.

Excavations of plaque fragments hint at a scene with a contest between [[Herakles]] and [[Apollo]], dubbed ''A Greek painting at Persepolis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-hellenic-studies/article/div-classtitlea-greek-painting-at-persepolisdiv/434BDDF27731A3F6A1DF0874C1CBAA41|doi=10.2307/630751|year=1980|title=A Greek painting at Persepolis|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume=100|pages=204–206|jstor=630751|last1=Roaf|first1=Michael|last2=Boardman|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
Persepolitan architecture is noted for its use of the [[Persian column]], which was probably based on earlier wooden columns. Architects resorted to stone only when the largest [[Cedrus libani|cedars]] of [[Lebanon]] or [[teak]] trees of [[India]] did not fulfill the required sizes. Column bases and capitals were made of stone, even on wooden shafts, but the existence of wooden capitals is probable.

The buildings at Persepolis include three general groupings: military quarters, the treasury, and the reception halls and occasional houses for the King. Noted structures include the Great Stairway, the [[Gate of All Nations]], the [[Apadana]], the Hall of a Hundred Columns, the Tripylon Hall and the [[Tachara]], the Hadish Palace, the Palace of [[Artaxerxes III]], the Imperial Treasury, the Royal Stables, and the Chariot House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire|author=Pierre Briant|publisher=Eisenbrauns|year=2002|pages=256–8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lxQ9W6F1oSYC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=Persepolis+military+quarter#v=onepage&amp;q=Persepolis%20military%20quarter&amp;f=false|isbn=9781575061207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruins and remains==
[[File:Lotus Achaemenid architecture.JPG|thumb|upright|Reliefs of [[Nymphaea|lotus flowers]] are frequently used on the walls and monuments at Persepolis.]]
Ruins of a number of colossal buildings exist on the terrace. All are constructed of dark-grey marble. Fifteen of their pillars stand intact. Three more pillars have been re-erected since 1970. Several of the buildings were never finished. F. Stolze has shown that some of the mason's rubbish remains.

Since the time of [[Pietro Della Valle]], it has been beyond dispute that these ruins represent the Persepolis captured and partly destroyed by [[Alexander the Great]].

Behind the compound at Persepolis, there are three sepulchers hewn out of the rock in the hillside. The facades, one of which is incomplete, are richly decorated with reliefs. About 13&amp;nbsp;km NNE, on the opposite side of the Pulvar River, rises a perpendicular wall of rock, in which four similar tombs are cut at a considerable height from the bottom of the valley. Modern-day Iranians call this place ''Naqsh-e Rustam'' ("Rustam Relief"), from the Sasanian reliefs beneath the opening, which they take to be a representation of the mythical hero [[Rostam]]. It may be inferred from the sculptures that the occupants of these seven tombs were kings. An inscription on one of the tombs declares it to be that of [[Darius I]], concerning whom [[Ctesias]] relates that his grave was in the face of a rock, and could only be reached by the use of ropes. Ctesias mentions further, with regard to a number of Persian kings, either that their remains were brought "to the Persians," or that they died there.

===Gate of All Nations===
{{main article|Gate of All Nations}}

The [[Gate of All Nations]], referring to subjects of the empire, consisted of a grand hall that was a square of approximately {{convert|25|m|ft}} in length, with four columns and its entrance on the Western Wall. There were two more doors, one to the south which opened to the Apadana yard and the other opened onto a long road to the east. Pivoting devices found on the inner corners of all the doors indicate that they were two-leafed doors, probably made of wood and covered with sheets of ornate metal.

A pair of [[lamassu]]s, bulls with the heads of bearded men, stand by the western threshold. Another pair, with wings and a ''Persian Head'' (''Gopät-Shäh''), stands by the eastern entrance, to reflect the power of the empire.

The name of Xerxes I was written in three languages and carved on the entrances, informing everyone that he ordered it to be built.

The work began in 518 BC, and his son, Xerxes I, completed it 30 years later. The palace had a grand hall in the shape of a square, each side {{convert|60|m|ft}} long with seventy-two columns, thirteen of which still stand on the enormous platform. Each column is {{convert|19|m|ft}} high with a square Taurus (bull) and plinth. The columns carried the weight of the vast and heavy ceiling. The tops of the columns were made from animal sculptures such as two-headed  lions, eagles, human beings and cows (cows were symbols of fertility and abundance in ancient Iran). The columns were joined to each other with the help of [[oak]] and [[Cedrus libani|cedar]] beams, which were brought from [[Lebanon]]. The walls were covered with a layer of mud and [[stucco]] to a depth of 5&amp;nbsp;cm, which was used for bonding, and then covered with the greenish stucco which is found throughout the palaces.

Foundation tablets of gold and silver were found in two deposition boxes in the foundations of the Palace. They contained an inscription by Darius in [[Old Persian cuneiform]], which describes the extent of his Empire in broad geographical terms, and is known as the DPh inscription:&lt;ref name="ACH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Persepolis : discovery and afterlife of a world wonder |date=2012 |pages=171-181 |url=https://archive.org/details/persepolis_discovery_and_afterlife_of_a_world_wonder/page/n195 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|''Darius the great king, king of kings, king of countries, son of Hystaspes, an Achaemenid. King Darius says: This is the kingdom which I hold, from the [[Scythians|Sacae]] who are beyond [[Sogdia]], to [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], and from [[Sind]] ([[Old Persian]]: [[Wikt:𐏃𐎡𐎯𐎢𐏁|𐏃𐎡𐎭𐎢𐎺]], "Hidauv", [[locative]] of "[[Hindush|Hiduš]]", i.e. "[[Indus valley]]") to [[Lydia]] ([[Old Persian]]: "Spardâ") - [this is] what Ahuramazda, the greatest of gods, bestowed upon me. May Ahuramazda protect me and my royal house!''|DPh inscription of Darius I in the foundations of the Apadana Palace&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/sources/content/achaemenid-royal-inscriptions/dph/? DPh inscription], also [https://ldsmag.com/the-gold-plates-of-king-darius/ Photographs of one of the gold plaques]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the western, northern and eastern sides of the palace, there were three rectangular [[portico]]s each of which had twelve columns in two rows of six. At the south of the grand hall, a series of rooms were built for storage. Two grand Persepolitan stairways were built, symmetrical to each other and connected to the stone foundations. To protect the roof from erosion, vertical drains were built through the brick walls. In the four corners of Apadana, facing outwards, four towers were built.

The walls were tiled and decorated with pictures of lions, bulls, and flowers. Darius ordered his name and the details of his empire to be written in gold and silver on plates, which were placed in covered stone boxes in the foundations under the Four Corners of the palace. Two Persepolitan style symmetrical stairways were built on the northern and eastern sides of Apadana to compensate for a difference in level. Two other stairways stood in the middle of the building. The external front views of the palace were embossed with carvings of the [[Immortals (Persian Empire)|Immortals]], the Kings' elite guards. The northern stairway was completed during the reign of Darius I, but the other stairway was completed much later.

The reliefs on the staircases allow one to observe the people from across the empire in their traditional dress,  and even the king himself, "down to the smallest detail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garthwaite|first1=Gene R.|title=The Persians|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781405144001|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=unG8_JqzYQQC&amp;lpg=PA50|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Apadana hoard|Achaemenid coinage}}
The [[Apadana hoard]] is a hoard of coins that were discovered under the stone boxes containing the foundation tablets of the [[Apadana Palace]] in Persepolis.&lt;ref name="ACH"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zournatzi |first1=Antigoni |title=THE APADANA COIN HOARDS, DARIUS I, AND THE WEST |date=2003 |pages=1–28 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43580364}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coins were discovered in excavations in 1933 by [[Erich Schmidt (archaeologist)|Erich Schmidt]], in two deposits, each deposit under the two deposition boxes that were found. The deposition of this hoard is dated to circa 515 BCE.&lt;ref name="ACH"/&gt; The coins consisted in eight gold lightweight [[Croeseid]]s, a [[tetradrachm]] of [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]], a stater of [[Aegina]] and three double-[[sigloi]] from [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="ACH"/&gt; The Croeseids were found in very fresh condition, confirming that they had been recently minted under Achaemenid rule.&lt;ref name="CHI"/&gt; The deposit did not have any [[Daric]]s and [[Sigloi]], which also suggests strongly that these coins typical of [[Achaemenid coinage]] only started to be minted later, after the foundation of the Apadana Palace.&lt;ref name="CHI"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fisher |first1=William Bayne |last2=Gershevitch |first2=I. |last3=Boyle |first3=John Andrew |last4=Yarshater |first4=Ehsan |last5=Frye |first5=Richard Nelson |title=The Cambridge History of Iran |date=1968 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521200912 |page=617 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBbyr932QdYC&amp;pg=PA618 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Throne Hall===
Next to the Apadana, second largest building of the Terrace and the final edifices, is the Throne Hall or the Imperial Army's ''Hall of Honor'' (also called the ''Hundred-Columns Palace''). This 70x70&amp;nbsp;square meter hall was started by [[Xerxes I]] and completed by his son [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]] by the end of the fifth century BC. Its eight stone doorways are decorated on the south and north with reliefs of throne scenes and on the east and west with scenes depicting the king in combat with monsters. Two colossal stone bulls flank the northern portico. The head of one of the bulls now resides in the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oi.uchicago.edu/museum/highlights/animals.html |title=Oriental Institute Highlights |publisher=Oi.uchicago.edu |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes I, the Throne Hall was used mainly for receptions for military commanders and representatives of all the subject nations of the empire. Later, the Throne Hall served as an imperial museum.

===Other palaces and structures===
Other palaces included the [[Tachara]], which was built under [[Darius I]], and the Imperial treasury, which was started by Darius I in 510 BC and finished by [[Xerxes I]] in 480 BC. The Hadish Palace of Xerxes I occupies the highest level of terrace and stands on the [[rock-cut architecture|living rock]]. The Council Hall, the Tryplion Hall, the Palaces of D, G, H, storerooms, stables and quarters, the unfinished gateway and a few miscellaneous structures at Persepolis are located near the south-east corner of the terrace, at the foot of the mountain.

===Tombs===
[[File:Artaxerses III tomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]], Persepolis.]]
It is commonly accepted that [[Cyrus the Great]] was buried in [[Pasargadae]], which is mentioned by [[Ctesias]] as his own city. If it is true that the body of [[Cambyses II]] was brought home "to the Persians," his burying place must be somewhere beside that of his father. Ctesias assumes that it was the custom for a king to prepare his own tomb during his lifetime. Hence, the kings buried at [[Naghsh-e Rostam]] are probably [[Darius I]], [[Xerxes I]], [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]] and [[Darius II]]. [[Xerxes II of Persia|Xerxes II]], who reigned for a very short time, could scarcely have obtained so splendid a monument, and still less could the usurper [[Sogdianus]]. The two completed graves behind the compound at Persepolis would then belong to [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] and [[Artaxerxes III]]. The unfinished tomb, a kilometer away from the city, is debated to who it belongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7lK6l7oF_ccC&amp;lpg=PA956&amp;pg=PA956 | title=A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East| isbn=9781405189880| last1=Potts| first1=Daniel T| date=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is perhaps that of [[Arses of Persia|Artaxerxes IV]], who reigned at the longest two years, or, if not his, then that of [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]] (Codomannus), who is one of those whose bodies are said to have been brought "to the Persians." Since [[Alexander the Great]] is said to have buried Darius III at Persepolis, then it is likely the unfinished tomb is his.

Another small group of ruins in the same style is found at the village of Haji Abad, on the Pulvar River, a good hour's walk above Persepolis. These formed a single building, which was still intact 900 years ago, and was used as the [[mosque]] of the then-existing city of [[Istakhr|Estakhr]].

===Ancient texts===
[[File:Cuneiform inscriptions from Persepolis by Nickmard Khoey.jpg|thumb|Babylonian version of an inscription of [[Xerxes I]], the "XPc inscription".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/sources/content/achaemenid-royal-inscriptions/xpc/? XPc inscription]&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref|b}}]]

The relevant passages from ancient scholars on the subject are set out below:

:([[Diodorus Siculus|Diod.]] 17.70.1-73.2) 17.70 (1) ''Persepolis was the capital of the Persian kingdom. Alexander described it to the Macedonians as the most hateful of the cities of Asia, and gave it over to his soldiers to plunder, all but the palaces.'' (2) ''It was the richest city under the sun, and the private houses had been furnished with every sort of wealth over the years. The Macedonians raced into it, slaughtering all the men whom they met and plundering the residences; many of the houses belonged to the common people and were abundantly supplied with furniture and wearing apparel of every kind....''

:72 (1) ''Alexander held games in honor of his victories. He performed costly sacrifices to the gods and entertained his friends bountifully. While they were feasting and the drinking was far advanced, as they began to be drunken, a madness took possession of the minds of the intoxicated guests.'' (2) ''At this point, one of the women present, Thais by name and Attic by origin, said that for Alexander it would be the finest of all his feats in Asia if he joined them in a triumphal procession, set fire to the palaces, and permitted women's hands in a minute to extinguish the famed accomplishments of the Persians.'' (3) ''This was said to men who were still young and giddy with wine, and so, as would be expected, someone shouted out to form up and to light torches, and urged all to take vengeance for the destruction of the [[Ancient Greek temple|Greek temple]]s.'' (4) ''Others took up the cry and said that this was a deed worthy of Alexander alone. When the king had caught fire at their words, all leaped up from their couches and passed the word along to form a victory procession [epinikion komon] in honor of Dionysius.''

:(5) ''Promptly, many torches were gathered. Female musicians were present at the banquet, so the king led them all out for the [[komos]] to the sound of voices and flutes and pipes, Thais the courtesan leading the whole performance.'' (6) ''She was the first, after the king, to hurl her blazing torch into the palace. As the others all did the same, immediately the entire palace area was consumed, so great was the conflagration. It was most remarkable that the impious act of Xerxes, king of the Persians, against the acropolis at Athens should have been repaid in kind after many years by one woman, a citizen of the land which had suffered it, and in sport.''

:(Curt. 5.6.1-7.12) 5.6 (1) ''On the following day, the king called together the leaders of his forces and informed them that "no city was more mischievous to the Greeks than the seat of the ancient kings of Persia . . . by its destruction they ought to offer sacrifice to the spirits of their forefathers."''...

:7 (1) ''But Alexander's great mental endowments, that noble disposition, in which he surpassed all kings, that intrepidity in encountering dangers, his promptness in forming and carrying out plans, his good faith towards those who submitted to him, merciful treatment of his prisoners, temperance even in lawful and usual pleasures, were sullied by an excessive love of wine.'' (2) ''At the very time when his enemy and his rival for a throne was preparing to renew the war, when those whom he had conquered were but lately subdued and were hostile to the new rule, he took part in prolonged banquets at which women were present, not indeed those whom it would be a crime to violate, but, to be sure, harlots who were accustomed to live with armed men with more licence than was fitting.''

:(3) ''One of these, Thais by name, herself also drunken, declared that the king would win most favor among all the Greeks, if he should order the palace of the Persians to be set on fire; that this was expected by those whose cities the barbarians had destroyed.'' (4) ''When a drunken strumpet had given her opinion on a matter of such moment, one or two, themselves also loaded with wine, agreed. The king, too, more greedy for wine than able to carry it, cried: "Why do we not, then, avenge Greece and apply torches to the city?"'' (5) ''All had become heated with wine, and so they arose when drunk to fire the city which they had spared when armed. The king was the first to throw a firebrand upon the palace, then the guests and the servants and courtesans. The palace had been built largely of cedar, which quickly took fire and spread the conflagration widely.'' (6) ''When the army, which was encamped not far from the city, saw the fire, thinking it accidental, they rushed to bear aid.'' (7) ''But when they came to the vestibule of the palace, they saw the king himself piling on firebrands. Therefore, they left the water which they had brought, and they too began to throw dry wood upon the burning building.''

:(8) ''Such was the end of the capital of the entire Orient''... .
:(10) ''The Macedonians were ashamed that so renowned a city had been destroyed by their king in a drunken revel; therefore the act was taken as earnest, and they forced themselves to believe that it was right that it should be wiped out in exactly that manner.''
:(Cleitarchus, [[Fragmente der griechischen Historiker|FGrHist]]. 137, F. 11 (= Athenaeus 13. 576d-e))

:''And did not Alexander the Great have with him Thais, the Athenian hetaira? Cleitarchus speaks of her as having been the cause for the burning of the palace at Persepolis. After Alexander's death, this same Thais was married to Ptolemy, the first king of Egypt.''

There is, however, one formidable difficulty. [[Diodorus Siculus]] says that the rock at the back of the palace containing the royal sepulchers is so steep that the bodies could be raised to their last resting-place only by mechanical appliances. This is not true of the graves behind the compound, to which, as F. Stolze expressly observes, one can easily ride up. On the other hand, it is strictly true of the graves at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]]. Stolze accordingly started the theory that the royal castle of Persepolis stood close by Naqsh-e Rustam, and has sunk in course of time to shapeless heaps of earth, under which the remains may be concealed.

==Modern events==
In 1971, Persepolis was the main staging ground for the ''[[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire|2,500 Year Celebration of the Persian Empire]]'' under the reign of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. It included delegations from foreign nations in an attempt to advance the [[Culture of Iran|Iranian culture]] and history.

===The controversy of the Sivand Dam===
Construction of the [[Sivand Dam]], named after the nearby town of [[Sivand]], began on 19 September 2006. Despite 10 years of planning, Iran's [[Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization of Iran|Cultural Heritage Organization]] was not aware of the broad areas of flooding during much of this time, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/dec/23/iran.artsnews|title=Dam is threat to Iran's heritage|last=Vidal|first=John|date=2004-12-23|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is growing concern about the effects the dam will have on the surrounding areas of Persepolis.

Many archaeologists{{Who|date=May 2010}} worry that the dam's placement between the ruins of [[Pasargadae]] and Persepolis will flood both. Engineers involved with the construction deny this claim, stating that it is impossible, because both sites sit well above the planned waterline. Of the two sites, Pasargadae is considered the more threatened.

Archaeologists are also concerned that an increase in humidity caused by the lake will speed Pasargadae's gradual destruction. However, experts from the Ministry of Energy believe this would be negated by controlling the water level of the dam reservoir.

==Museums (outside Iran) that display material from Persepolis==
A number of bas-reliefs from Persepolis are kept at the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] in [[Cambridge]], England.&lt;ref&gt;A Persepolis Relief in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. Richard Nicholls and Michael Roaf. Iran, Vol. 15, (1977), pp. 146-152. Published by: British Institute of Persian Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a collection from Persepolis at the [[British Museum]]. The Persepolis bull at the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] is one of the university's most prized treasures, but it is only one of several objects from Persepolis on display at the [[University of Chicago]]. [[New York City]]'s [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum]] houses objects from Persepolis,&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Prudence O., Barbara A. Porter, Oscar White Muscarella, Holly Pittman, and Ira Spar. "Ancient Near Eastern Art."

This requires choice and deployment of [[microphones]], choice of recording media, and mixing of [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] signals in real time.

[[File:Sound technician with mixer, boom, slate and multiple wireless mic transmitters and receivers.jpg|thumb|Sound technician with mixer, boom, slate and multiple wireless mic transmitters and receivers at San Diego Comic Con 2011]]Usually, the recordist will arrive on location with his/her own [[Audio equipment|equipment]], which normally includes [[microphones]], radio systems, booms, mixing desk, [[audio storage]], [[headphones]], cables, tools, and a paper or computer sound logs.  The recordist may be asked to capture a wide variety of wild sound on location, and must also consider the format of the finished product ([[monaural|mono]], [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] or multi channels). The recorded production [[sound track]] is later combined with other elements, i.e. effects, music, narration, foley or re-recorded dialog by [[automatic dialogue replacement]] (ADR).

Often, when taping on [[video]], the sound recordist may record (single system) audio directly onto the camera rather than use a separate medium (double system), although a separate copy is often made, as it both provides an extra copy which may have more tracks and also may include other sound captured without the camera.

The sound mixer is considered a department head, and is thus completely responsible for all aspects of production sound including the hiring of a [[Boom operator (media)|boom operator]] and [[utility sound technician]], planning the technical setup involving sound including both sound equipment and ancillary devices involved in syncing and time offsets, anticipating and discussing sound-related problems with the rest of the crew, and ordering and preparing the sound equipment to be used on the set.

East-West/West-East consists of four steel plates measured by their relation to the topography. The plates, which rise to 14.7 meters and 16.7 meters above the ground, are level to each other; they are also level to the gypsum plateaus on either side. Despite the great distance that the plates span, all four can be seen and explored from either end of the sculpture.

==''Buscando la luz IV'' by Eduardo Chillida==
Qatar Museums unveils Public Art commission by the Basque artist [[Eduardo Chillida]] at [[Qatar University]], Doha, [[Qatar]]. ''Buscando la luz IV'' (Searching for Light IV) is the last among a series of sculptures of monumental scale produced by Chillida throughout his final creative period. The abstract piece integrates in itself the fundamental concepts inside the artist’s labor. The dialogue between matter and space; the creation of sites; the organic nature of forms; and a strong ethical content are all notions that conform Chillida’s body of work. The three asymmetrical steel plates that compose the sculpture are linked to each other through a complex riveting system, which delimitates in its interior a place for human encounters. The artist plays with the scale and invites us to enter the interior space of the work. Once inside, its undulant forms appear to acquire movement, raising up in search of the light.

==Plot==
Balakrishna ([[Kamal Haasan]]) is an economically disadvantaged but multi-talented dancer, adept at the Indian classical dances of [[Kuchipudi]], [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Kathak]], etc. Fondly called Balu, his simple and very honest soul does not permit him to attain professional success in the commercial world that requires a certain level of moral laxness. Madhavi ([[Jaya Prada]]), a wealthy young woman and a dance patron, notices his talent and acts as his benefactress, helping him secure an opportunity to participate in a high-level classical dance festival.

Balu's aging mother passes away from the afflictions of poverty two days before the performance. Balu, who was very attached to her, is emotionally devastated and fails to participate in the dance festival. Madhavi nevertheless, gives him support and encouragement and sets him on the mend. Balu gradually develops a fondness for Madhavi as their relationship grows. He hides his love for her, but eventually picks up the courage to express it. Balu discovers that, while Madhavi shares his feelings, she is a married woman separated from her husband. The husband later returns to unite Madhavi and Balu, but Balu decides to sacrifice his love showing respect for the institution of marriage.

The years pass, and Balu, a disappointed man, has become an inconsolable alcoholic and a newspaper journalist/art critic. Meanwhile, Madhavi's husband dies, and she hears about Balu's condition. In a bid to revive his will to live and his passion for his art, she tends to his medical needs through his friend Raghu ([[Sarath Babu]]) and solicits Balu to be the dance master for her daughter, Sailaja ([[SP Sailaja]]).

The film ends with Sailaja's stage performance with Balu watching her in a wheelchair, his health having completely deteriorated dies. Raghu is seen taking him away quietly, without interrupting the performance. Madhavi follows him with an umbrella covering Balu from the rain.

==Production==
Kamal and [[R. C. Sakthi]] wanted to make a film on a subject, about a dancer who was an alcoholic, which they named "Anupallavi", when K. Viswanath approached him with a similar subject, Kamal felt he had to do the film. On the sets of the film, Gopi Krishna, one of the choreographers, insisted that Kamal should train for at least a month. Kamal was one of the top stars of the time, doing multiple shifts, and had to find the time. Kamal said it was the "greatest sacrifice from my side".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/enriching-cinema-kamal-style/article6506926.ece|title=Enriching cinema, Kamal style|author=BARADWAJ RANGAN|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playback singer S. P. Sailaja was recruited to play a prominent role, thereby making her debut as an actress and it also remains her only film she had acted in so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/from-busy-schedule-to-worklife-balance/article6610491.ece|title=From busy schedule to work-life balance|author=Rani Devalla|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; K.

[[File:Sauwastika swastika comparison.svg|thumb|274px|Comparison between left-facing "sauwastika" and right-facing "swastika"]]

The term '''''sauwastika'''''  (or ''sauvastika''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/symbols/swastika.htm |title=Swastika - Hindu Symbols |publisher=ReligionFacts |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/576371/swastika |title=swastika (symbol) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1935-09-15 |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;) (as a character: 卍) is sometimes used to distinguish the left-facing from the right-facing [[swastika]] symbol, a meaning which developed in 19th century scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;In use from the 1850s, certainly so used by D'Alviella (1894) "[[sauvastika]]" is used to classify the geometrical form  of symbols in Liungman, Carl G., ''Symbols: Encyclopedia of Western Signs and Ideograms'', HME Publishing (2004) {{ISBN|91-972705-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The left-facing variant is favoured in [[Bön]] and [[Gurung Dharma]]; it is called ''yungdrung'' in Bon and ''Gurung Yantra'' in Gurung Dharma. Both the right-facing and left-facing variants are employed in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]; however, the ''left-facing'' is more commonly used in Buddhism than Hinduism and the right-facing is more commonly used in Hinduism than Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanskrit.org/what-is-the-meaning-of-a-swastika/ |title=What is the meaning of a Swastika? |publisher=Sanskrit.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buddhism the left-facing sauwastika is imprinted on the chest, feet, palms of Buddha and also the first of the 65 auspicious symbols on the footprint of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/buddhism/symbols/swastika.htm |title=Swastika Symbol in Buddhism - Buddhist Swastika |publisher=ReligionFacts |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swastikaphobia.com/buddhist.html |title=Buddhist - The Swastikaphobia Project |publisher=Swastikaphobia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism the left-facing sauwastika is associated with esoteric tantric practices and often stands for Goddess [[Kali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cla.calpoly.edu/~bmori/syll/315syll/Swastika.html |title=Swastika |publisher=Cla.calpoly.edu |date=1935-09-05 |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhas-online.com/swastika.html |title=The Swastika or WAN Symbol in Asian Art - The Heart of Buddha |publisher=Buddhas-online.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[Sanskrit]] ''sauvastika'' is the adjective derived from ''svastika'' through the standard process of [[vṛddhi]] of the vowel ''u'' in the initial syllable.   (''Svastika'' is the transformation of "su asti" + "ka" through [[sandhi]].  Vrddhi applies to the original form before sandhi.)  It is attested as an adjective meaning "benedictive, salutatory".&lt;ref&gt;according to [[Horace Hayman Wilson|Wilson]] (1819), cited by [[Monier-Williams]].&lt;/ref&gt; The connection to a "reversed" ''svastika'' is probably first made by  [[Eugène Burnouf]] in 1852, and taken up by [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]] in ''Ilios'' (1880), based on a letter from [[Max Müller]], who is in turn quoting Burnouf. The term ''sauwastika'' is used in the sense of "backwards swastika" by [[Eugène Goblet d'Alviella]] (1894): "In India it [the ''[[gammadion]]''] bears the name of ''swastika'', when its arms are bent towards the right, and ''sauwastika'' when they are turned in the other direction."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/sym/mosy/mosy06.htm#page_40 ''The Migration of Symbols''], by [[Eugène Goblet d'Alviella]], (1894), p.40 at [[sacred-texts.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been misspelled as ''suavastika'', a term attributed to Max Müller by Wilson (1896).
Wilson  finds that "The 'suavastika' which Max Müller names and believes was applied to the swastika sign, with the ends bent to the left ... seems not to be reported with that meaning by any other author except Burnouf."&lt;ref&gt;On Oriental Carpets. Article III.—The Svastika, The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs (1903) also uses the term with reference to Müller.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of a distinction in Indian religions==
[[Image:buddhistswastika.jpg|thumb|225px|"Left-facing" swastika on a Buddhist temple in [[Korea]].]]
[[Image:Kipling swastika.png|frame|Left-facing swastika from a 1911 edition of [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'']]
[[Eugene Burnouf]], the first Western expert on Buddhism, stated in his book ''Lotus de la bonne loi'' (1852) that the ''sauvastika'' was a Buddhist variant of the ''svastika''.

When [[Heinrich Schliemann]] discovered swastika motifs in [[Troy]], he wrote to the Indologist [[Max Müller]], who, quoting Burnouf, confirmed this distinction, adding that "the ''svastika'' was originally a symbol of the sun, perhaps of the vernal sun as opposed to the autumnal sun, the ''sauvastika'', and, therefore, a natural symbol of light, life, health, peace and wealth." The letter was published in Schliemann's book ''Ilios'' (1880):
{{quote|"In the footprints of Buddha the Buddhists recognize no less than sixty-five auspicious signs, the first of them being the Svastika ..." (Eugene Burnouf, ''Lotus de la bonne loi'', p. 625); “the fourth is the sauvastika {{sic}}, or that with the arms turned to the left.”}}

The term ''sauvastika'' thus cannot be confirmed as authentic and is probably due to Burnouf (1852).  Notions that sauwastikas are considered "evil" or inauspicious versions of the auspicious swastika in [[Indian religions]] have even less substance, since even Burnouf counts the svastika and the sauvastika equally among the "sixty-five auspicious signs".

D'Alviella (1894) voices doubts about the distinction:
{{quote|sign=|source=|Would it not be simpler to admit that the direction of the branches is of secondary importance in the symbolism of the gammadion?  When it is desired to symbolize the progress of the sun, namely, its faculty of translation through space, rather than the direction in which it turns, little attention will have been paid to the direction given to the rays. (p. 68)}}

Although the more common form is the right-facing swastika, the symbol is used in both orientations for the sake of balance in [[Hinduism]]. Buddhists almost always use the left-facing swastika.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Use==
The sauwastika was a favorite symbol of the last Russian Empress [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]]. She put this sign everywhere for good luck. In particular, she drew it with a pencil on the wall, at the window opening, and on the wallpaper above the bed of her son [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich]] in [[Ipatiev House]], where the murdered Emperor's family spent the last days of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Gilliard]]. Thirteen Years at the Russian Court&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shane Warne: The Musical''' is a musical comedy by [[Eddie Perfect]] based on the life of Australian [[cricket]]er [[Shane Warne]]. [[The Daily Telegraph]] described the musical as "a warts-and-all account of the spin bowler's controversy-laden career and roller-coaster personal life set to soul, rock, opera, gospel music – and even a bit of Bollywood."&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last=Malkin|first=Bonnie|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/3699759/Shane-Warne-backs-Musical-based-on-his-life.html|title=Shane Warne backs musical based on his life|date=10 December 2008|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The musical consists of two acts: the first act covering Warne's aborted [[Australian rules football]] career, his marriage and his rise to success as a Test cricketer while the controversial issues that Warne was involved in; such as his drug offence, infidelity and the [[John the bookmaker controversy]] feature in the second act. The musical finishes with a chorus "Everyone's a little bit like Shane".&lt;ref name="IndependentReview"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/warnes-life-flashes-before-his-eyes--to-music-1060773.html|title=Warne's life flashes before his eyes – to music|last=Boztas|first=Senay|date=10 December 2008|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical contains a series of songs about various incidents in Warne's life both on and off the cricket field, including:
*"The Tale Of Warne";
*"Run";
*"Get Offa The Couch";
*"How do you spell success? [[Australian Institute of Sport|AIS]]";
*"We're Going There";
*"Piss It All Away";
*"Hollywood";
*"[[Ball of the Century|The Ball]]";
*"Payin' Attention Now";
*"Dancing with the Stars";

*"I'm Coming Home";
*"Shine Like Shane";
*"What About That, Shane?";
*"The Ashes";
*"Bunny in the headlights" (about [[Daryll Cullinan]]); and
*"What an SMS I’m in".&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5544840.ece|title=Singing with Shane Warne|last=Gruber|first=Fiona|date=19 January 2009|work=[[The Times Literary Supplement]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
After five years of solo cabaret shows, Perfect had wanted to write a full-scale musical.  Seeking a subject, Perfect reflected that: "with every headline I read about Warnie, came the realisation that here was a simple yet complicated, positive yet flawed, honest but naive, charming, philandering, freakishly talented and endlessly divisive man. And that, I thought, is a great character."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/comedy/features/4015/shane-warne-the-musical-interview&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Adelaide Cabaret Festival]] presented a work-in-progress showing on 17 June 2007 at the Dunstan Playhouse, [[Adelaide Festival Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/71254&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2008 [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] included a further showing at the [[Hi Fi Bar and Ballroom]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/85842&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions==
The full Australian production, directed by [[Neil Armfield]] with choreography by [[Gideon Obarzanek]] and with Perfect in the title role, opened at the [[Melbourne Athenaeum|Athenaeum Theatre]] in [[Melbourne]] on 10 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/arts/as-musical-fodder-king-of-spin-faces-the-first-test/2008/10/18/1223750404904.html|title=As musical fodder, king of spin faces the first test|last=Bailey|first=John|date=19 October 2008|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It toured to the [[Regal Theatre]] in Perth from 18 March 2009 and the [[Enmore Theatre]] in Sydney from 15 May 2009.

A 2013 revision included a new beginning and ending, new scenes and a revised structure, four new songs and new characters including Liz Hurley.  It played short seasons in June for the Adelaide Cabaret Festival at [[Her Majesty's Theatre, Adelaide|Her Majesty’s Theatre]], then at [[Hamer Hall, Melbourne|Hamer Hall]] in Melbourne.  This production, directed by Simon Phillips, had a cast that included Perfect, [[Lisa McCune]], [[Shane Jacobson]] and [[Christie Whelan|Christie Whelan-Browne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/musicals/warne-out-not-even-a-halfchance-20130613-2o6g0.html|title=Warne out? Not even a half-chance|last=Mathieson|first=Craig|date=14 June 2013|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cast album was recorded during the season at Hamer Hall and released in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://castalbums.org/recordings/Shane-Warne-The-Musical-2013-Concert-Cast/28211&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
While initially suspicious of the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/shane-warne-the-musical-1048567.html|title=Shane Warne: The Musical|last=Marks|first=Kathy|date=3 December 2008|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warne later gave his approval after watching the show, saying "I think Eddie and his team have written the musical in a respectful and sympathetic way, and that they have captured my fun, larrikin side."&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

The musical has been able to draw an audience that would not normally attend musicals with Perfect saying "You see young blokes making their way to their seats carrying armfuls of beers for their mates, just like they do at the cricket. It's like Reformation theatre when people were buying oranges to throw at the actors – why shouldn’t they have fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=289963|title=Warne musical draws the blokes|date=2 February 2009|work=[[Daily Dispatch]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews for the musical have been mainly positive.
*''[[Herald Sun]]'': "[The musical] is a wild, funny, outrageous, and by the end, surprisingly moving account of the champion spin bowler's life so far. [...] Among the fun, there's genuine respect for [Warne's] enormous talent but it doesn't gloss over his personal failings."&lt;ref name="HS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24753094-2902,00.html |title=Wicked wicket ways of Shane Warne: The Musical |last=Vickery |first=Colin |date=5 December 2008 |work=[[Herald Sun]] |accessdate=6 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207162927/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24753094-2902,00.html |archivedate=7 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Independent]]'' "The mid-field marriage of a likeable star, fake bowling, plenty of sporting puns, and a moderate raunch factor had the crowds chuckling and clapping along. [...] [The musical makes] his life an appealingly debauched song and dance, playing with musical styles from nicely-harmonized gospel to gangsta rap."&lt;ref name="IndependentReview" /&gt;
*''Australian Stage'': "The story is thin, the songs are wordy and the sound wasn’t great, so many of the lyrics were lost. [...] Without wanting to cut down a tall poppy, there are certainly holes in the script and score. But who cares!? The performances by the ensemble cast are brilliant, the packed audience loved it, the upfront ''this-is-what-I-am-and-who-gives-a-shit-what-you-think-about-me'' attitude (reflecting Shane's own character) is refreshing, the show will bring in thousands of audience-goers who love sport and Shane, but rarely go to the theatre (which is fantastic), so what more can a new Australian musical do?"&lt;ref name="Stage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianstage.com.au/reviews/melbourne/shane-warne-the-musical-2131.html|title=Shane Warne: The Musical|last=Kooperman|first=Paul|date=13 December 2008|work=Australian Stage Online|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gideon Haigh]], ''[[The Guardian]]'': "Perfect's vision is an almost unimprovable mingling of satire and homage, cheek and deference, music and comedy."&lt;ref name="HaighGuardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/dec/12/shane-warne-the-musical|title=Warne takes centre stage again as spinner proves Perfect vehicle for satire|last=Haigh|first=Gideon|date=12 December 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6173">'''Sharh al-isharat''' ({{lang|ar|شرح الإشارات}}) is a philosophical commentary on [[Avicenna]]'s book ''[[Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat]]'' (''Remarks and Admonitions'') . this commentary has been written by [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] in defense of philosophy in front of [[Fakhr Razi]].

==Author==
Abu Jaʿfar Moḥammad NASIR-al-DIN  ṬUSI, (b. Ṭus, 17 February 1201/d. Baghdad, 25 June 1274), honored as polymath and vizier, whose significant works in literary, theological and scientific disciplines later earned him the title of Moʿallem-al-ṯāleṯ, i.e., the third teacher, following [[Aristotle]] and [[Farabi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tusi-nasir-al-din|title=ṬUSI, NAṢIR-AL-DIN – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About Isharat==
''[[Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat]]'' is the last book written by [[Avicenna]] and the most prominent. The book is on logic,natural philosophy and theology and metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/1592|title=دائرة المعارف بزرگ اسلامی:ابن سینا|website=www.cgie.org.ir|accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat]] could be considered as  generally  as a later works and therefore an expression of Avicenna's mature thought. Ibn sina advice that book to his disciples as a kind of work book. In this book ibn Sina try to offer suggestion by which he call for his disciples to establish in the right way the conclusions and/or the premises to reach conclusions. In other words, Avicenna doesn't intend to develop fully articulated arguments in [[Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat]]. This makes it very abstract and demanding text for any reader, a text is not easy to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Shams C. Inati, Ibn Sina's Remarks and Admonitions: Physics and Metaphysics: An Analysis and Annotated Translation, Columbia University Press, 2014, 218pp., {{ISBN|9780231166164}},Reviewed by  Jules Janssens, De Wulf-Mansion Centre, KU Leuven&lt;/ref&gt;

==The book==
Sharh ''[[Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat]]'' or commentary of ''[[Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat]]'' is a collection of books written by Nasir ad-Dìn al-Tùsì for detailing and defending of Avicenna's work in front of fakhr Razi. 
according to [[Hosein Nasr]], the influence of  Fakhr al din Razi and his technical discussions of later Islamic philosophy was not recogonzed until now. Razi had important attack against peripatetic philosophy. This attack manifested on detailed in the book of sharh al Isharat which is written in the criticism of Avicenna's Al Isharat. Nasir Al Din to which book has written the responses that resuscitated Avicennian philosophy. In the fourteenth century this central debate was carried further by Qubal-Din al-Razy in his al-Muhakamهt (Trials), in which he sought to judge between the commentaries of Fakhr al-Din al-Razy and TUsi.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Seyyed Hossein,2006,p.p113-114&lt;/ref&gt;
this collection until day counted as the most commentary on the book of admonitions and remarks and later men of wisdom  had explain and develop it.Avicenna’s [[Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat]] was well known in philosophical circles, and numerous commentaries, glosses, and summaries had been written on it. One of the earliest commentaries was perhaps Shahrastani’s (d. 445/1153) polemical I'tiqadat  'alkalam al-isarat, to which 'Umar ibn Sahlan as-Sawi (d. ca. 549/1145) eventually wrote a reply.25 Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi (d. 606/1209) then wrote his famous ”sarh˙ al-I“isharat and an abridged version of its essential theses, titled Lubab al-I“isharat.Sa'd ibn Oasan ibn Hibat Allah (Mu˙ammad) Ibn Kammuna al-Isra'ili (d. 676/1277) wrote a sarh˙ al-I“isharat. Nasir ad-Din  a†-ˇusi (672/1274) wrote a ” sarh˙ al-I"isharat, as well as hall mus"kilat al-I"isharat. Although a number of these scholars knew Persian, these works were all written in Arabic, and no Persian medieval translation of al-I"isharat has been recorded by Brockelmann.&lt;ref&gt;Roxanne D. Marcotte, , RESURRECTION (MA'AD)IN THE PERSIAN OAYAT AN-NUFUS OF ISMA'IL IBN MUOAMMAD RIZI:THE AVICENNAN BACKGROUND* in INTERPRETING AVICENNA: SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY IN MEDIEVAL ISLAM.,p219. BRILLLEIDEN • BOSTON.2004&lt;/ref&gt; Tūsī wrote supercommentaries on Rāzī’s commentary. Their supercommentaries sought to demonstrate a critical distance from Rāzī’s Shar h, rather than a critical distance from Avicenna’s Ishārāt.Somewhat less aggressively,Tūsī levels accusations at Rāzī that Rāzī had earlier leveled at Masʿūdī: of offering criticisms presumptuously, of not yet havingworked hard enough to understand Avicenna’s theories and arguments fully and thereby present them fairly. In the preface to his Hall Mushkilāt al-Ishārāt, after praising Avicenna extravagantly and singling out the Ishārāt as an expression of  Avicenna’s ideas referred to by Tusi.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wisnovsky / Oriens 41 (2013) 349–378&lt;/ref&gt;

==content==
this seminal works on Peripatetic philosophy established him beyond doubt as the greatest Avicennan philosopher after the master himself. This category of the works include his rebuttals to the criticisms of Ibn Sina by al-Shahrastan’s al-Muƒari‘ah and Raz’s earlier critical commentary upon Ibn Sina’s [[Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat]]. Known
also as Sharh al-isharat, this work, which is a major philosophical masterpiece in both form and content, resuscitated Ibn Sina’s teachings once and for all in the East. Devoted to expounding the teachings of the master in this work refrained from expressing any views of his own except when it came to God’s knowledge of the world,where Nasir Al Din accepted the views of Suhraward, which he also knew well. The work became so famous that it in turn became the subject of many later commentaries, the most famous by Qutb al-Din al-Raz.&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr,2006.p.187&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Slovak National Theater''' ({{lang-sk|Slovenské národné divadlo}}, abbr. SND) denotes:
* the oldest [[Slovakia|Slovak]] professional theater consisting of 3 ensembles ([[opera]], [[ballet]] and [[drama]])
* a [[Neo-Renaissance]] theater building in the Old Town of [[Bratislava]], Slovakia, which formerly housed two of the theater's ensembles (opera and ballet, drama was based elsewhere), and
* the theater's large modern theater building in Bratislava near the [[Danube]], which opened on 14 April 2007.

==Professional theater==
The Slovak National Theater is the second oldest Slovak professional theater. It has 3 ensembles (drama, opera and ballet). It was founded in 1920 after the creation of [[Czechoslovakia]] as a cooperative and became a state-run company in 1945. Between 1920 and 1945, there was also a musical ensemble. The Slovak National Theater has represented [[Slovaks|Slovak culture]] on its numerous tours abroad.

It was created and, in the 1920s, also run by [[Czech people|Czech]] artists (e.g. [[Oskar Nedbal]], director during 1923-1930). The first performance was the Czech opera ''[[The Kiss (opera)|Hubička]]'' by [[Bedřich Smetana]] on March 1, 1920. The ensembles were Slovakized only gradually. In 1932, the drama ensemble split into the ''SNT Slovak Drama Company'' led by Janko Borodáč, and into the ''SNT Czech Drama Company'', led by V. Šulc. The Czech Drama Company ceased to operate when it was forced to leave Slovakia in 1938.  Since then, the drama ensemble has performed in [[Slovak language|Slovak]] only, but in the opera ensemble there were Czech artists even after 1945. In recent years, operas have been presented in their original languages.

Initially, all 3 ensembles were active at the old Slovak National Theater building. From 1955 to early 2007, the drama company performed at the ''P. O. Hviezdoslav Theater'' and from 1962 to (?)2006 also at a chamber theater called ''Malá scéna SND'' (SNT Small Stage). Since 2007, the ensembles perform only at the old Slovak National Theater building and the new Slovak National Theater building opened in April, 2007.

The drama company was shaped by the directors Janko Borodáč, F. Hoffman, J. Jamnický, J.Budský, T. Rakovský, K. I. Zachary, P. Haspra,  M. Pietor and the current one &amp;ndash; [[Dusan Jamrich|Dušan Jamrich]].

The opera ensemble was led by conductors such as [[Oskar Nedbal]], K. Nedbal, J. Vincourek and T. Frešo, and directors including V. Šulc and M. Wasserbauer. The opera became known abroad under the leadership of Czech conductor Oskar Nedbal, who also introduced the first Slovak operas of Jozef Levoslav Bella and V. Figuš Bystrý, and under K. Nedbal, who improved the drama programme. A great boom occurred after World War II. The SNT witnessed the rise of modern Slovak opera by [[Eugen Suchoň]], [[Ján Cikker]], [[Alexander Moyzes]], [[Tibor Andrašovan]], T. Frešo, and many others. Many singers from the SNT are famous abroad, e.g. [[Edita Gruberova|Edita Grúberová]], [[Lucia Popp]], [[Peter Dvorský]], R. Petrák, S. Kopčák, M. Hajóssyová, E. Jenisová, J. Galla, [[Jozef Kundlák]], and many others.

The ballet ensemble has grown from a small group in 1920 to a huge ensemble today.

==The old building==
This theater's names were earlier: '''City Theater''' ({{ lang-hu| Városi Színház}}-{{ lang-de|Stadt-Theater}})

[[Image:Slovak National Theater at Night.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The old Slovak National Theater building during [[Christmas]] time]]
Located by the [[Hviezdoslavovo námestie (Bratislava)|Hviezdoslav Square]], the Neo-Renaissance building was built in 1885–1886 during the time of [[Austria-Hungary]], based on a design by the [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[architect]]s [[Fellner &amp; Helmer]], who designed theater buildings in 10 European countries. It was opened as the ''City Theater'' on September 22, 1886 with the opera ''[[Bánk bán]]'' of [[Ferenc Erkel]], which is one of the most important Hungarian operas. As a sign of this event's importance, [[Kálmán Tisza]] Hungarian Prime Minister and his whole government, [[Mór Jókai]] took part in this ceremony. The gala performance was conducted by [[Ferenc Erkel]] himself. The original building was designed for 1000 spectators and was illuminated using 800 [[gas lamp]]s, while the auditorium had a lustre with 64 lights. The interior was decorated, with frescos of by [[Pressburg]]/[[Pozsony]] native painter Kornél Spányik and by paintings by [[Munich]] artist Leo Lüttgendorf-Leinburg, among others. The City Theater was hired by German and Hungarian professional theater companies, but beginning in 1919 (at the creation of [[Czechoslovakia]]), it was used by Czech and later also Slovak ensembles (see above). In 1920 it became the ''Slovak National Theater''.

The new building was constructed on the site of a previous [[Classicism|Classic style]] theater built in 1776, the first permanent theater building in today's Slovakia, which was demolished in 1884.

Pressburg native sculptor [[Viktor Oskar Tilgner]] crafted the famous [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]'s Fountain in 1888, now located immediately in front of the theater.

The building has housed Slovak National Theater ensembles since 1920, but today only the opera and ballet ensembles are resident. It was restored between 1969 and 1972, when a new modern technical building was added behind the old building. It features a unique lustre (a special ball) with 2532 bulbs enabling the creation of millions of combinations of light pictures based on a selected programme.

==The new building==
[[Image:BratislavaSND2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Front of the new Slovak National Theater building]]
The design of the new building was begun in the early 1980s, and construction started in 1986. Due to a lack of funds, the building was under construction (with long interruptions) for 21 years, which increased the planned costs from 874 million to almost 5 billion [[Slovak koruna|Slovak crowns]] (although this figure is exaggerated by the relatively high inflation of the 1990s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://spravy.pravda.sk/otvorili-novu-budovu-snd-0hb-/sk_domace.asp?c=A070414_193441_sk_domace_p12 Otvorili novú budovu SND - Pravda.sk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The building was finally opened on April 14, 2007 and it houses all three ensembles of the Slovak National Theater, although the ensembles continue to use the old building in the [[Old Town, Bratislava|Old Town]] in parallel. The building is designed to hold 1700 spectators at a time in its three sections.

[[File:Anglo Saxon Cross, St Helen's Church - geograph.org.uk - 411929.jpg|thumb|Stapleford Cross]]

'''Stapleford Cross''' is an Anglo-Saxon [[high cross]] dating from the eleventh century, now located in the churchyard of [[St. Helen's Church, Stapleford]], in [[Nottinghamshire]], [[England]].

It is [[Grade I listed]],&lt;ref name=EH&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1278059 |desc=ANGLO SAXON CROSS 50 METRES EAST OF CHURCH OF ST HELEN|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also a [[scheduled ancient monument]].&lt;ref name=EH2&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1012870 |desc=Anglian high cross in the churchyard of St Helen's Church|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
The cross was said by [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] to be "by far the most important pre-[[Norman conquest of England|Conquest]] monument in Notts".&lt;ref name=EH /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pevsner/&gt;

According to its [[Historic England]] list entry: 
{{quotation|The cross ... though not in its original location, is an extremely fine example; its carvings are very well-preserved and include an unusual figural carving in addition to the more common interlace.&lt;ref name=EH2 /&gt;}}

==Description==

===Shape===

The remains of the cross today consist of a 2.5m high square stone shaft, tapering from 0.5m square at the base to 0.25m at the top.&lt;ref name=EH2/&gt;

The lower portion has rounded edges, whilst the top part is more square section, which makes this cross one of the [[Mercia]]n round-shaft family.&lt;ref name=Kendrick&gt;{{cite book|last=Kendrick|first=T.D.|title=Late Saxon and Viking Art|pages=71–2 Plate XLVI|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=315499|year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decoration===

The shaft is heavily decorated with various forms of interlace, divided into four sections. The third section also displays a winged figure, armed with a spear and presumed to be an [[archangel]],&lt;ref name=EH2/&gt; or [[Luke the Evangelist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=J Holland|title=Links with old Nottingham. Historical notes by J. Holland Walker|year=1928|url=http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/whatnall1928/stapleford_cross.htm|editor=Percy Whatnall}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See External link for photo of carved figure.)

According to [[T. D. Kendrick|Kendrick]], this dense interlacing is distinctly Mercian in character. It shows similarities to the densely carved [[Wolverhampton Pillar]], and the fine interlacing to be seen on the Brunswick Casket and the Witham Pins.&lt;ref name=Kendrick/&gt; On the other hand, Hill sees a stylistic connection with the [[Bewcastle Cross]] in Cumbria, and Byzantine influences.&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;

===Mounting===

The cross is now mounted on a nineteenth-century [[plinth]], and is topped by cap and modern ball in place of the original cross-head which was lost in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=EH2/&gt;

==Origins==

===Date===

The date of the cross in unclear. English Heritage describe it as eleventh-century in one of two listings,&lt;ref name=EH/&gt; but in its other listing they suggest that high crosses of this type are likely to be eighth, ninth or tenth century.&lt;ref name=EH2/&gt;

Rev. A.D. Hill suggested (in 1906) a date between 680 and 780 AD, from the ornamentation style and circumstances of the times.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hill|first=Arthur DuBoulay|journal=Transactions of the Thoroton Society |year=1906 |volume=10 |title=  Excursion, 1906: Stapleford Cross |pages=23–25 
|url=http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/articles/tts/tts1906/summer/staplefordcross.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the date range quoted on the information panel displayed at the site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/lenton_sands/1524132768/in/set-72157602335535819 Photo of information panel], posted by Lenton Sands on flickr.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Pevsner says that the date may be as late as c.1050.&lt;ref name=Pevsner&gt;{{cite book|last=Pesvner|first=Nickolaus|title=Buildings of England - Notts|year=1951|page=175|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=315499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original location===

The original position of the cross in unknown, but it is likely to have been nearby.&lt;ref name=EH2/&gt;

==Historical record==
[[File:Stapleford Cross in 1906.jpg|thumb|Stapleford Cross in c.1906]]
The first records of the monument date from the eighteenth century. 
Before 1760, the cross was lying on its side in the churchyard, around which time the cross-head was removed. With the head, the cross would have been around 3.5m high. In 1760, the cross was re-erected at the junction of Church Street and Church Lane, immediately south east of the churchyard.&lt;ref name=EH2/&gt; In 1820, it was installed on a new base at the same location, and topped with a stone cap and ball (''pictured'').&lt;ref name=Hill /&gt;  In 1916, the top ball was damaged in a storm.&lt;ref name=Welcome&gt;[http://www.stapleford-notts.co.uk/staplefordcross.htm Welcome to Stapleford - website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, the cross together with the 1820 plinth and cap was moved from the street location to the churchyard, where it now stands.&lt;ref name=EH2/&gt; In 2000, a new stone ball replaced the one damaged in 1916.&lt;ref name=Welcome /&gt;

==Other==
The cross may be the origin of the name 'Stapleford' which means a crossing near a post.&lt;ref name=Welcome /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9697">{{1r|date=February 2016}}{{2p|date=February 2016}}'''The Steven Spielberg Jewish Film Archive''' is dedicated to the preservation and research of Jewish documentary films. The [[archive]] is jointly administered by the Abraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and the [[Central Zionist Archives]] of the [[World Zionist Organization]] (WZO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.jfa.huji.ac.il/ Archive website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The archive was established in the late 1960s by Professor Moshe Davis and other historians of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. The archive was originally called the Avraham Rad Jewish Film Archive for a number of years. In 1973, the WZO designated the archive as the official depository for its films. Since 1988, the archive has been named after the Jewish-American filmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]], whose foundation partially finances archive activities. In 1996, the archive moved to its present premises at the university's faculty of humanities on [[Mount Scopus]].

==The Collection==

The archive holds approximately 16,000 titles: about 4,500 films, over 9,000 videos on various formats and roughly 600 DVDs are cataloged. The collection deals with a variety of Jewish subjects: Jewish history, the establishment of the State of Israel, immigration, Jewish communities in the Diaspora and the relationships between them and Israelis. The films come from diverse sources: primarily the WZO and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem but also other public bodies, such as the [[Jewish National Fund]] and private sources that either donate or deposit their films – mainly documentary filmmakers and their families. In addition, the archive possesses a number of collections deposited by various kibbutzim. The Steven Spielberg Archive holds the copyright for the films produced by its founding institutions – i.e., the WZO and the Hebrew University – and is authorized to sell user rights to broadcasting and production companies and all other interested parties. The films are kept in temperature controlled vaults, facilitating their preservation, as much as possible, in optimal conditions. Movies can be watched on 16&amp;nbsp;mm and 35&amp;nbsp;mm viewing tables, and on video players in [[U-Matic]], [[Betacam]], [[VHS]], [[DVCAM]], [[Mini DV]], [[Super VHS]] and [[Betamax]].

==Films==

Viewers will receive a tangible and extensive picture of the development of the Jewish nation and the State of Israel during the 20th century until the present. The varied and rich collection contains several definitive moments in the history of the State and the Jewish people in the Diaspora: for example the "First Film of Palestine" depicts life during Ottoman rule in 1911; the film "Five Cities" in which five central Jewish communities were filmed in Poland, provides a concrete and chilling testament to the vibrant Jewish life existing there a few months before the Holocaust; the film "The Day Came" which describes the establishment of the State on 14 May 1948, includes the famous scene of the Declaration of Independence by [[David Ben-Gurion]]; there is also film of the [[Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations|Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations]], [[Chaim Herzog]], furiously tearing up the General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism.

Viewers can also see the establishment of different communities, both before and after the establishment of the State. [[Hadassah]] Organization presents the nascent medical profession in Israel. Films produced by the Hebrew University throughout the years, show not only the development of the University but also the changing face of Jerusalem. The film "Edge of the West" brings images of the Jews of Morocco, including poignant scenes of residents of an entire small Jewish village leaving on their way to Israel. In addition, influential Jewish figures, such as Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Chaim Weizmann]], among others, can be seen. The archive holds original copies of the [[Eichmann]] Trial, given by the American company that filmed the trial. The Israel State Archives granted the archive the right to distribute this material, after the original video reels were transferred to digital cassettes.

==Prominent projects==
* '''Preservation and restoration: ''' film reels and different video formats are held in optimal temperature and humidity controlled film vaults, thus facilitating their preservation. The films undergo periodic inspection to confirm that they have not been afflicted with any damaging chemical problems, such as [[vinegar syndrome]]. The archive has a number of damaged films, some of them unique copies, requiring restoration and reconstruction and from time to time – according to need and budget – they undergo restoration, thus saving the information contained in them for future generations.
* '''Digitization, accessibility and virtual cinema:''' to make films in the collection more accessible, the archive has acted as follows. Selected and important film reels have been digitized, transferred to DVD or uploaded to the Internet. During the last decade, the archive has developed its virtual cinema portal, containing about five hundred films for which it holds copyright. The films have been digitized and uploaded to an Internet site that operates currently as a channel on [[YouTube]]. Films can be viewed without charge. Basic information about the films is also given (year of production, duration of the film, general abstract and other technical details). The films are divided into a number of categories: Jewish communities, [[Holocaust]] and [[World War II]], Pre-state and various facets of life in the [[State of Israel]] (Art, Health, Birth and Security, Cities and Rural Settlement). Funds for the project were generously donated by the American Friends of the Hebrew University in honor of [[Jack Valenti]], former chairman of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]. Movies can be found relatively easily by searching the archive's online catalog: by title, producer or keywords. Films in the virtual cinema can be viewed directly from the catalog by clicking on the links.
* '''Film research – Matis Library: ''' The David Matis Collection contains press clippings, photographs and various documents on the production of Jewish and Israeli films over the years and of Jewish and Israeli filmmakers. It includes other print and photograph collections that have accumulated. Recently this collection was scanned and uploaded to the online, web-based database, Artlid.
* '''Production of showcase films''': The Spielberg Archive is obliged to produce films using material in its holdings.
* '''Witnesses from the Eichmann Trial''' presents a number of testimonies from the trial of the Nazi criminal;
* '''Jerusalem of Light''' was produced to mark the 40th anniversary of the re-unification of Jerusalem, contains segments from different motion pictures filmed during the 20th century and shows the development of Jerusalem from different angles;
* '''The White City''' produced in honor of [[Tel Aviv]]'s 90th anniversary, presents images from the first decades of its existence.

==Publications==
* '''No Matter What – Studies in the History of the Jewish Film in Israel''', by Joseph Halachmi. Jerusalem, Steven Spielberg Jewish Film Archive, 1995.

'''Street art in Adelaide''' is a growing aspect of the wider public arts scene found in the [[Adelaide]] central business district. Adelaide [[street art]] includes the full gamut of contemporary street art mediums, including [[Stencil graffiti|stenciling]], [[mural]]s, [[Wheatpaste|paste-ups]], [[sticker art]] and [[yarn bombing]].

Whereas Adelaide street art was previously painted over on occasion by the local authorities,&lt;ref name="Advert-1"&gt;{{cite news | last = Spain | first = Katie  | date = 30 May 2012 | title = Topham Mall loses its street art | work = The Advertiser | url = http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/lifestyle/topham-mall-loses-its-art/story-fn6d2yge-1226372254162 | accessdate = 20 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; street art in Adelaide is now recognised and cultivated by state and local governments through supportive policies, as well as events such as the ''Oi You! Urban Art Festival''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bayly | first = Jess | date = 18 March 2013 | title = Adelaide Urban Art Festival Bringing Banksy To Town | work = RipItUp.com | url = http://www.ripitup.com.au/lifestyle/article/adelaide-urban-art-festival-bringing-banksy-to-town | accessdate = 20 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Street art locations ==
Adelaide's street art scene is physically centred in the [[Adelaide city centre|Adelaide central business district]]. Stencils and other forms of street art such as yarn bombing also appears throughout suburbia and along public transport routes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/photos-fnlmw1po-1227271614326?page=1 The Advertsiaer] ''Artists take it to Adelaide’s streets''.

'''''Te Maori''''' (sometimes '''''Te Māori''''' in modern sources) was a watershed exhibition of [[Māori culture|Māori]] art in 1984 (later continued to 1985, 1986 and 1987). It is notable as (a) the first occasion on which Māori art had been exhibited by Māori (b) the first occasion on which Māori art was shown internationally as art. In retrospect it is seen as a milestone in the [[Māori Renaissance]].

In the colonial period many Māori objects, including art, domestic objects and human remains (particularly [[Mokomokai]]) were widely collected by explorers, missionaries and scientists and were lost to the communities which had created them; largely they were lost to large European collection institutions such as the [[London Science Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/about_us/about_the_museum/collections/~/link.aspx?_id=1C8A895A3304428386CA3FA7E7900A75&amp;_z=z |title=ScM human remains_weblist_2007.xls |work=sciencemuseum.org.uk |year=2007 |accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?q=maori |title=Search the Collections – Victoria and Albert Museum |work=collections.vam.ac.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]] at Oxford.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} This alienation meant that Māori regarded many [[Pākeha]] (Western) cultural institutions with considerable skepticism and overcoming this skepticism to allow objects to be borrowed for exhibition made ''Te Maori'' a milestone.

The project was driven by Secretary for Maori Affairs, [[Kara Puketapu]], under the auspices of the [[Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council]] with funding from [[Mobil]].

The exhibition started at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Met]] in [[New York City|New York]] on 10 September 1984, [[Saint Louis Art Museum]] (February–May 1985), the [[M. H. de Young Memorial Museum]] in [[San Francisco]] (July–September 1985), and the [[Field Museum]] in [[Chicago]] (March–June 1986). ''Te Maori: Te Hokinga Mai'', the New Zealand leg of the exhibition, toured [[Wellington]], [[Christchurch]], [[Dunedin]], and finally ended in [[Auckland]] on 10 September 1987, three years later to the day after opening at the Met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/te-maori-exhibition-of-traditional-maori-art-opens-at-the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-in-new-york |title=Te Maori exhibition opens in New York |work=nzhistory.net.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=2 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230141015/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/te-maori-exhibition-of-traditional-maori-art-opens-at-the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-in-new-york |archivedate=30 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thebigidea.co.nz/news/industry-news/2009/sep/60220-te-maori-new-york-celebration |title=Te Maori in New York celebration |work=The Big Idea |publisher= Te Aria Nui |date=7 September 2009 |accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2009/09/09/te-maori-25th-year-anniversary/ |title=Te Māori – 25th year anniversary « Te Papa’s Blog  |work=blog.tepapa.govt.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition was very well received, both at home and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues31to40/temaori.htm |title=Te Maori in New York  |work=art-newzealand.com |year=2011 |quote=Douglas Newton, chairman of the Department of Primitive Art at the Met, had no doubt that the exhibition would be a great success. He assured me of this months before the opening. But even he was delighted with the response of the media, of the people of New York and of the art world in the United States. When the ''Te Maori'' cultural group performed at the American Museum of Natural History there was no doubt something had happened. The audience was already won over even before the performance began. What they wanted was to touch Maori culture and Maori people to learn more and more and more. They were reaching out to us in a way that is difficult to describe.  |accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU1109/S00252/te-maori-exhibition-remembered.htm |title=Te Maori Exhibition remembered  |work=scoop.co.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Boyhood of Raleigh''''' is a painting by [[John Everett Millais]], which was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1871. It came to epitomise the culture of heroic [[imperialism]] in late [[Victorian era|Victorian Britain]] and in British popular culture up to the mid-twentieth century {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}.

The painting depicts the young, wide-eyed [[Walter Raleigh]] and his brother sitting on the beach by the [[Devon]]shire coast. He is listening to a story of life on the seas, told by an experienced sailor who points out to the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=9515 Tate Gallery, The Boyhood of Raleigh]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The painting was influenced by an essay written by [[James Anthony Froude]] on ''England's Forgotten Worthies'', which described the lives of [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] seafarers. It was also probably influenced by a contemporaneous biography of Raleigh, which imagined his experiences listening to old sailors as a boy. Millais travelled to [[Budleigh Salterton]] to paint the location.

Millais's sons Everett and George modelled for the boys. The sailor was a professional model.&lt;ref name = "jg"&gt;J.G. Millais, ''The Life and Letters of Sir John Everett Millais'', vol 2, pp. 17-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Millais' friend and biographer, the critic [[Marion Spielmann]], stated that he was intended to be [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]. He also argues that the sailor is pointing south towards the "[[Spanish main]]".&lt;ref name = "jg"/&gt;

==Literary and satirical use==
[[File:MillaisBudleighPlaque.png|thumb|left|Blue plaque in Budleigh Salterton commemorating Millais's creation of the painting]]

===Cartoons===
The painting has been parodied many times in political cartoons.

In 1928 David Low published a cartoon&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2018/jeffrey-archer-l18417/lot.66.html&lt;/ref&gt; showing the Earl of Birkenhead ([[Secretary of State for India]]), [[Stanley Baldwin]] (Prime Minister) and [[Winston Churchill]] ([[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]) listening to "Tales of the Dominions" from a diminutive sailor ([[Leo Amery]], Colonial Secretary – who was a very short man).

In 1993 the ''Sunday Telegraph'' ran "The Boyhood of Hurd and Major". The then Prime Minister [[John Major]] and Foreign Secretary [[Douglas Hurd]], who had recently pushed the Maastricht Treaty through Parliament against the wishes of many Conservatives, were shown as small boys in Elizabethan costume, listening as an old sailor ([[Sir Edward Heath]]) gestured towards the coast labelled "Europe" visible on the other side of the water. Former Prime Minister Heath – whose hobby had been yachting – had taken Britain into the EEC (as it was then called) during his premiership, and had grown up in Kent where the coast of France is visible on a clear day. At the time Heath was [[Father of the House of Commons]] and enjoying something of an Indian Summer after the ousting of his political nemesis, the eurosceptic [[Margaret Thatcher]], as Prime Minister in 1990.

In 1999 the ''Daily Telegraph'' published a Garland cartoon, showing the then Conservative leader William Hague as a small boy (this was common in satire at the time, as Hague had first attained national fame as a teenager in the 1970s), while two old sailors – former Foreign Secretary [[David Owen]] and former Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Denis Healey]] – gestured inland and away from a ship labelled "Euro". The two elder statesmen described themselves as pro-European but opposed to British membership of the Single Currency.

===Postcolonialism===
The picture has also appeared in recent explorations of [[postcolonialism]], most notably [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[Midnight's Children]]'', in which the narrator Saleem Sinai partly misremembers and transforms the meaning of the painting, a copy of which hung on his bedroom wall when he was a child.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Ten Kortenaar, "Postcolonial Ekphrasis: Salman Rushdie Gives the Finger Back to the Empire", ''Contemporary Literature'', Vol. 38, No. 2 (Summer, 1997), pp. 232-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Record Covers===
Elements of the picture appear on the cover of the Talk Talk album ''[[It's My Life (album)|It's My Life]]''.

The painting is also reproduced in part on the cover of the 1982 single "Almost With You/Life Speeds Up" by [[The Church (band)|The Church]].

[[File:The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter - Discovery of Princess Kaguya.jpg|thumb|Discovery of Princess Kaguya (depiction from the Edo period, late 17th century)]]
{{Nihongo |'''''The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter'''''|竹取物語|Taketori Monogatari}} is a 10th-century Japanese ''[[monogatari]]'' (fictional prose narrative) containing [[Japanese folklore]]. It is considered the oldest extant Japanese prose narrative&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = MSU | contribution-url = http://www.isp.msu.edu/AsianStudies/wbwoa/eastasia/Japan/literature.html | title = Windows on Asia | contribution = Japan: Literature}},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Tale of Genji | chapter = 17. A Picture Contest | chapterurl = http://www.globusz.com/ebooks/Genji/00000028.htm | quote = the ancestor of all romances | title-link = The Tale of Genji }})&lt;/ref&gt; although the oldest manuscript dates to 1592.&lt;ref name="katagiri 95"&gt;Katagiri et al. 1994: 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale is also known as {{Nihongo | '''''The Tale of Princess Kaguya'''''|かぐや姫の物語|Kaguya-hime no Monogatari}}, after its protagonist.&lt;ref name="katagiri 81"&gt;Katagiri et al. 1994: 81.&lt;/ref&gt; It primarily details the life of a mysterious girl called Kaguya, who was discovered as a baby inside the stalk of a glowing [[bamboo]] plant.

==Narrative==
[[Image:Taketori Monogatari 1.jpg|thumb|right|Taketori no Okina takes Kaguya-hime to his home, Drawn by Tosa Hiromichi, c. 1600]]
One day, while walking in the bamboo forest, an old, childless bamboo cutter called {{Nihongo|Taketori no Okina|竹取翁|"the Old Man who Harvests Bamboo"}} came across a mysterious, shining stalk of bamboo. After cutting it open, he found inside it an infant the size of his thumb. He rejoiced to find such a beautiful girl and took her home. He and his wife raised her as their own child and named her Kaguya-hime (かぐや姫 accurately, Nayotake no Kaguya-hime, "Shining princess of the supple bamboo"). Thereafter, Taketori no Okina found that whenever he cut down a stalk of bamboo, inside would be a small nugget of [[gold]]. Soon he became rich. Kaguya-hime grew from a small baby into a woman of ordinary size and extraordinary beauty. At first, Taketori no Okina tried to keep her away from outsiders, but over time the news of her beauty spread.

Eventually, five princes came to Taketori no Okina's residence to ask for the beautiful Kaguya-hime's hand in marriage. The princes eventually persuaded Taketori no Okina to tell a reluctant Kaguya-hime to choose from among them. Kaguya-hime concocted impossible tasks for the princes, agreeing to marry the one who managed to bring her his specified item. That night, Taketori no Okina told the five princes what each must bring. The first was told to bring her the stone begging bowl of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha Shakyamuni]] from [[India]], the second a jeweled branch from the mythical island of [[Mount Penglai|Hōrai]],&lt;ref name="McCullough"&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the third the legendary robe of the fire-rat of [[China]], the fourth a colored jewel from a [[Japanese dragon|dragon]]'s neck, and the final prince a [[cowry|cowry shell]] born of [[swallow]]s.

Realizing that it was an impossible task, the first prince returned with an expensive stone bowl, hoping that Kaguya-hime would believe it to be real, but after noticing that the bowl did not glow with holy light, Kaguya-hime saw through his deception. Likewise, two other princes attempted to deceive her with fakes, but also failed. The fourth gave up after encountering a storm, while the final prince lost his life (severely injured in some versions) in his attempt.

After this, the [[Emperor of Japan]], Mikado, came to see the strangely beautiful Kaguya-hime and, upon falling in love, asked her to marry him. Although he was not subjected to the impossible trials that had thwarted the princes, Kaguya-hime rejected his request for marriage as well, telling him that she was not of his country and thus could not go to the palace with him. She stayed in contact with the Emperor, but continued to rebuff his requests and marriage proposals.

That summer, whenever Kaguya-hime saw the full moon, her eyes filled with tears. Though her adoptive parents worried greatly and questioned her, she was unable to tell them what was wrong. Her behaviour became increasingly erratic until she revealed that she was not of this world and must return to her people on the Moon. In some versions of this tale, it is said that she was sent to the Earth, where she would inevitably form [[Upādāna|material attachment]], as a temporary [[punishment]] for some crime, while in others, she was sent to Earth for her own safety during a celestial war. The gold that Taketori no Okina had been finding had in fact been a [[stipend]] from the people of the Moon, sent down to pay for Kaguya-hime's upkeep.

[[Image:Taketori Monogatari 2.jpg|thumb|right|Kaguya-hime goes back to the Moon]]
As the day of her return approached, the Emperor sent many guards around her house to protect her from the Moon people, but when an embassy of "Heavenly Beings" arrived at the door of Taketori no Okina's house, the guards were blinded by a strange light. Kaguya-hime announced that, though she loved her many friends on Earth, she must return with the Moon people to her true home. She wrote sad notes of apology to her parents and to the Emperor, then gave her parents her own robe as a memento. She then took a little of the [[elixir of life]], attached it to her letter to the Emperor, and gave it to a guard officer. As she handed it to him, her feather robe was placed on her shoulders, and all of her sadness and compassion for the people of the Earth were apparently forgotten. The heavenly entourage took Kaguya-hime back to ''Tsuki no Miyako'' (月の都; lit. "the Capital of the Moon"), leaving her earthly foster parents in tears.

[[File:Japanese Fairy Book - Ozaki - P118.png|thumb|left|The receding Princess]]
The parents became very sad and were soon put to bed sick. The officer returned to the Emperor with the items Kaguya-hime had given him as her last mortal act, and reported what had happened. The Emperor read her letter and was overcome with sadness. He asked his servants, "Which mountain is the closest place to [[Heaven]]?", to which one replied the Great Mountain of [[Suruga Province]]. The Emperor ordered his men to take the letter to the summit of the mountain and burn it, in the hope that his message would reach the distant princess. The men were also commanded to burn the elixir of immortality since the Emperor did not wish to live forever without being able to see her. The legend has it that the word ''immortality'', 不死 (''fushi''), became the name of the mountain, [[Mount Fuji]]. It is also said that the [[kanji]] for the mountain, 富士山 (literally "Mountain Abounding with Warriors"), are derived from the Emperor's army ascending the slopes of the mountain to carry out his order. It is said that the smoke from the burning still rises to this day. (In the past, Mount Fuji was much more volcanically active and therefore produced more smoke.)

==Literary connections==

Elements of the tale were drawn from earlier stories. The protagonist Taketori no Okina, given by name, appears in the earlier poetry collection ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' (c. 759; poem# 3791). In it, he meets a group of women to whom he recites a poem. This indicates that there previously existed an image or tale revolving around a bamboo cutter and celestial or mystical women.&lt;ref&gt;Horiuchi (1997:345-346)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Satake (2003:14-18)&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar retelling of the tale appears in the c. 12th century [[Konjaku Monogatarishū]] (volume 31, chapter 33), although their relation is under debate.&lt;ref&gt;Yamada (1963:301-303)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banzhu Guniang===

In 1957, ''Jinyu Fenghuang'' (金玉鳳凰), a Chinese book of Tibetan tales, was published.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |script-title=zh:金玉鳳凰 |editor= 田海燕 |publisher=少年兒童出版社 |date=1957 |location=Shanghai |language=Chinese }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In early 1970s, Japanese literary researchers became aware that "Banzhu Guniang" (班竹姑娘), one of the tales in the book, had certain similarities with ''The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |author= 百田弥栄子 |script-title=ja:竹取物語の成立に関する一考察 |journal= アジア・アフリカ語学院紀要 |volume=3 |date=1971 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |script-title=ja:かぐや姫の誕生―古代説話の起源 |author=伊藤清司 |date=1973 |publisher=講談社 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, many researchers thought that "Banzhu Guniang" must be related to ''Tale of Bamboo Cutter'', although some were skeptical.

In 1980s, studies showed that the relationship is not as simple as initially thought.  Okutsu provides extensive review of the research, and notes that the book ''Jinyu Fenghuang'' was intended to be for children, and as such, the editor took some liberties in adapting the tales. No other compilation of Tibetan tales contains the story.&lt;ref name="okutsu"&gt;{{cite book |script-title=ja:竹取物語の研究 |author=奥津 春雄 |title=竹取物語の研究: 達成と変容 |publisher=翰林書房 |date=2000 |language=Japanese |isbn= 978-4-87737-097-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Tibet-born person wrote that he did not know the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=テンジン・タシ |others=Translated by 梶濱 亮俊|script-title=ja:東チベットの民話 |date=2001 |publisher=SKK |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; A researcher went to [[Sichuan]] and found that, apart from those who had already read "Jinyu Fenghuang", local researchers in [[Chengdu]] did not know the story.&lt;ref name="shigehara"&gt;{{cite book |script-title=ja:日中説話の比較研究 |author= 繁原 央 |date=2004 |publisher=汲古書院 |language=Japanese |isbn= 978-4-7629-3521-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan informants in [[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture]] did not know the story either.&lt;ref name="shigehara" /&gt;

==Legacy==
''The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter'' has been identified as proto-[[science fiction]]. Some of its science fiction plot elements include Kaguya-hime being a princess from the Moon who is sent to Earth for safety during a celestial war, an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] being raised by a human on Earth, and her being taken back to the Moon by her real extraterrestrial family. A manuscript illustration also depicts a round flying machine that resembles a [[flying saucer]].&lt;ref name=Richardson&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Halstead Treasury of Ancient Science Fiction|first=Matthew|last=Richardson|publisher=Halstead Press|publication-place=Rushcutters Bay, New South Wales|year=2001|isbn=978-1-875684-64-9}} ([[cf.]] {{Cite journal|title=Once Upon a Time|journal=Emerald City|issue=85|date=September 2002|url=http://www.emcit.com/emcit085.shtml#Once|accessdate=2008-09-17}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptations===
The 1974 Japanese TV series ''Ultraman Leo'' episode 32  "Japan Masterpiece Folklore Series: Farewell, Princess Kaguya" features a teen age girl who does not know she is the moon princess, sent to Earth 15 years ago to protect her from enemies who wanted her dead, until Kirara a giant creature from the moon comes to Earth to take her home now that her enemies have been defeated.

The 1975 Japanese TV series ''Manga Nihon Mukashi-Banashi''{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} (Cartoon Tales of Old Japan) contains a 10-minute adaption of the story, directed by Takao Kodama with animation by Masakazu Higuchi and art by Koji Abe.&lt;ref name= "anipages"&gt;[http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php/the-tale-of-princess-kaguya The Tale of Princess Kaguya], Pelleas. Retrieved 2014-10-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kon Ichikawa]] made a film of the story in 1987 entitled ''[[Princess from the Moon]]''.  Composer [[Robert Moran]] saw it and composed an opera based on it, ''[[From the Towers of the Moon]]''.{{citation needed| date = October 2014}}

The tale was also featured in the 1989 film ''[[Big Bird in Japan]]'', where Big Bird first is told the tale as folklore, and later realizes that his guide, named Kaguya, is the girl from the tale, but he is too late to see her return to the moon, and assumes that his imagination got away from him again.

In 1988, Japanese composer [[Maki Ishii]] asked Czech choreographer [[Jiří Kylián]] to produce a ballet for his musical work bearing the name ''Princess Kaguya''. The product was a [[contemporary ballet]] named ''Kaguyahime the Moon Princess'', where elements of Western and Japanese cultures combine.{{citation needed|date= October 2014}}

A demon assuming the identity of Kaguya, claiming to have devoured the real Kaguya Hime to acquire her divinity, is an antagonist in [[Inuyasha the Movie: The Castle Beyond the Looking Glass]].

In the 2006 [[Clover Studio]] video game ''[[Ōkami]]'', a girl named Kaguya appears as a captive of the possessed Emperor, and when she is freed, she reunites with her grandfather, who found her as a baby in a bamboo grove, and then announces that she must depart the land of Nippon to return to the moon. However, in this version, she uses a rocket ship to depart, and her design motif mixes bamboo designs with rabbit-like ears made of leaves, suggesting that she's a [[moon rabbit]] turned human.

[[Studio Ghibli]] released in November 2013 in Japan an anime film based on the folktale under the title of  ''[[The Tale of the Princess Kaguya]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | place = [[Japan|JP]] | url= http://kaguyahime-monogatari.jp/beginning.html | title = Kaguya-hime monogatari |accessdate=December 29, 2014 |language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Touhou Project]], the Character Houraisan Kaguya&lt;ref&gt;https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Kaguya_Houraisan&lt;/ref&gt; is a princess born over a thousand years ago on the moon.  She was raised with utmost care as a princess, thus she eventually became selfish and managed to convince Yagokoro Erin&lt;ref&gt;https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Eirin_Yagokoro&lt;/ref&gt; to illegally create the Hourai Elixir (Elixir of Life) out of self-interest and consumed it. Kaguya was executed again and again but as an immortal, she could not die.  Hence, the Lunarians exiled her to Earth and she was found in the Shining Bamboo by her adopted father.
Kaguya's backstory then follows the original folktale of The Bamboo Cutter.  The name of her theme in-game is called "Flight of the Bamboo Cutter ~ Lunatic Princess"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w5s7dwrH7Q&lt;/ref&gt; and the five Impossible Requests she requested of the five princes are revealed to already be in her possession as she attacks the player with them as the final boss in Imperishable Night.

Kaguya Otsutsuki is the otherworldly antagonist in the popular [[Naruto]] series, the ancestor of the half-human branch Otsutsuki clan through her twin sons Hagoromo in the Senju and Uchiha clans and Hamura in the Hyuga clan and Toneri Otsutsuki from ''[[The Last: Naruto the Movie]]''. She is also a playable character in Naruto: Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4.

In the manga series [[Kaguya-sama: Love is War]], most of the major characters have their names derived from the story (both from characters and the impossible tasks), with several chapters making a direct reference to the original tale.

In the manga series ''[[Soul Eater (manga)|Soul Eater]]'', Kaguya is one of the Clown constructs created by Asura as his first line of defense.

In Oct 2016 the video game "Mary Skelter: Nightmares" was released with Kaguya as one of the parties usable characters, a possible love interest, and carries with it hints at the original text in her story... although she is portrayed as very lazy, even referred to as "Princess Lazy" by the cast.

{{Intellectual property}}
A '''trade secret''' is a [[formula]], [[best practice|practice]], [[business process|process]], [[design]], [[legal instrument|instrument]], [[pattern]], commercial method, or compilation of [[information]] not generally known or reasonably ascertainable by others by which a [[business]] can obtain an economic advantage over competitors or customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2047462|title=Executive Trade Secrets|first=Tom C. W.|last=Lin|date=28 April 2012|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[jurisdiction]]s, such secrets are referred to as ''[[confidential information]]''.

==Definition==

The precise language by which a trade secret is defined varies by jurisdiction, as do the particular types of information that are subject to trade secret protection. Three factors are common to all such definitions: 

A trade secret is information that

* is not generally known to the public;
* confers economic benefit on its holder ''because'' the information is not publicly known; and
* is the subject of reasonable efforts by the holder to maintain its secrecy.

In international law, these three factors define a trade secret under article 39 of the [[TRIPS Agreement|Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]], commonly referred to as the TRIPS Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04d_e.htm#7
|title=Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, Section 7: Protection of Undisclosed Information
|publisher=[[World Trade Organization]]|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the United States [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]], "A trade secret, as defined under {{UnitedStatesCode|18|1839}}(3)(A),(B) (1996), has three parts: (1) information; (2) reasonable measures taken to protect the information; and (3) which derives independent economic value from not being publicly known."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Value==
Trade secrets are an important, but invisible component of a company's [[intellectual property]] (IP). Their contribution to a company's value, measured as its [[market capitalization]], can be major.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Merges, Peter S. Menell, Mark A. Lemley (@006)  Intellectual Property in the Technological Age, 3rd ed.; Aspen&lt;/ref&gt; Being invisible, that contribution is hard to measure.&lt;ref&gt;Baruch Lev (2001): Intangibles, Management, Measurement and Reporting, with comments by conference participants; Brookings Institution Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Patents are a visible contribution, but delayed, and unsuitable for internal [[innovation]]s. Having an internal [[Dashboard (management information systems)|scoreboard]] provides insight into the cost of risks of employees leaving to serve or start competing ventures.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Protection==
In contrast to registered intellectual property, trade secrets are, by definition, not disclosed to the world at large. Instead, owners of trade secrets seek to protect trade secret information from competitors by instituting special procedures for handling it, as well as technological and legal security measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Elbaum | first = Dan | year = 2011 | title = Human factors in information-age trade secret protection | url = http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/chrr/22 | journal = Cornell HR Review | accessdate = 2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal protections include [[non-disclosure agreement]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (NDAs), and [[work-for-hire]] and [[non-compete clause]]s. In other words, in exchange for an opportunity to be employed by the holder of secrets, an employee may sign agreements to not reveal their prospective employer's proprietary information, to surrender or assign to their employer ownership rights to intellectual work and work-products produced during the course (or as a condition) of employment, and to not work for a competitor for a given period of time (sometimes within a given geographic region). Violation of the agreement generally carries the possibility of heavy financial penalties which operate as a disincentive to reveal trade secrets. However, proving a breach of an NDA by a former stakeholder  who is legally working for a competitor or prevailing in a lawsuit for breaching a non-compete clause can be very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Customer Lists as Trade Secrets |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/customer-lists-trade-secrets|publisher=[[Dykema Gossett]] PLLC|work=The National Law Review|date=2009-12-30|accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A holder of a trade secret may also require similar agreements from other parties he or she deals with, such as vendors, licensees, and board members.

As a company can protect its confidential information through NDA, work-for-hire, and non-compete contracts with its stakeholders (within the constraints of employment law, including only restraint that is reasonable in geographic- and time-scope), these protective contractual measures effectively create a perpetual monopoly on secret information that does not expire as would a [[patent]] or [[copyright]]. The lack of formal protection associated with registered intellectual property rights, however, means that a third party not bound by a signed agreement is not prevented from independently duplicating and using the secret information once it is discovered, such as through [[reverse engineering]].
[[File:Chartreuse-bottle.jpg|180px|thumb|Green [[Chartreuse liqueur]] protected by confidential information of the ingredients]]
Therefore, trade secrets such as secret formulae are often protected by restricting the key information to a few trusted individuals. Famous examples of products protected by trade secrets are [[Chartreuse liqueur]] and [[Coca-Cola]].&lt;ref&gt;Leon Stafford for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution December 8, 2011 [http://www.ajc.com/news/business/coke-hides-its-secret-formula-in-plain-sight-in-wo/nQPMm/ Coke hides its secret formula in plain sight in World of Coca-Cola move]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because protection of trade secrets can, in principle, extend indefinitely, it therefore may provide an advantage over patent protection and other registered intellectual property rights, which last only for a specific duration. The Coca-Cola company, for example, has no patent for the [[Coca-Cola formula|formula of Coca-Cola]] and has been effective in protecting it for many more years than the 20 years of protection that a patent would have provided. In fact, Coca-Cola refused to reveal its trade secret under at least two judges' orders.&lt;ref&gt;''For God, Country &amp; Coca-Cola'', by [[Mark Pendergrast]], 2nd Ed., Basic Books 2000, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies often try to discover one another's trade secrets through lawful methods of [[reverse engineering]] or employee poaching on one hand, and potentially unlawful methods including [[industrial espionage]] on the other. Acts of industrial espionage are generally illegal in their own right under the relevant governing laws, and penalties can be harsh.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Fox Rubin (2012): Former Dow Chemical Scientist Gets Five Year in Prison; Wall Street Journal, 13 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of that illegality to trade secret law is: if a trade secret is acquired by improper means (a somewhat wider concept than "illegal means" but inclusive of such means), then the secret is generally deemed to have been ''misappropriated''. Thus, if a trade secret has been acquired via industrial espionage, its acquirer will probably be subject to legal liability for having acquired it improperly. (The holder of the trade secret is nevertheless obliged to protect against such espionage to some degree in order to safeguard the secret. Under most trade secret regimes, a trade secret is not deemed to exist unless its purported holder takes reasonable steps to maintain its secrecy.){{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==History==

===Roman law===
Commentators starting with A. Arthur Schiller assert that trade secrets were protected under [[Roman law]] by a claim known as ''actio servi corrupti'', interpreted as an "action for making a slave worse" (or an action for corrupting a servant). The Roman law is described as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he Roman owner of a mark or firm name was legally protected against unfair usage by a competitor through the ''actio servi corrupti'' ... which the Roman jurists used to grant commercial relief under the guise of private law actions. "If, as the writer believes [writes Schiller], various private cases of action were available in satisfying commercial needs, the state was acting in exactly the same fashion as it does at the present day."&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;Alan Watson, ''Trade Secrets and Roman Law: The Myth Exploded'', 11 Tul. Eur. &amp; Civ. L.F. 19, 19 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The suggestion that trade secret law has its roots in Roman law was introduced in 1929 in a ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'' article called "Trade Secrets and the Roman Law: The ''Actio Servi Corrupti''", which has been reproduced in Schiller's, ''An American Experience in Roman Law'' 1 (1971). See ''Trade Secrets and Roman Law: The Myth Exploded'', at 19. However, the [[University of Georgia]] [[University of Georgia Law School|Law School]] professor [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]] argued in ''Trade Secrets and Roman Law: The Myth Exploded ''that the ''actio servi corrupti'' was not used to protect trade secrets p.&amp;nbsp;19. Rather, he explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Schiller is sadly mistaken as to what was going on. ... The ''actio servi corrupti'' presumably or possibly could be used to protect trade secrets and other similar commercial interests. That was not its purpose and was, at most, an incidental spin-off. But there is not the slightest evidence that the action was ever so used. In this regard the ''actio servi corrupti'' is not unique.

Exactly the same can be said of many private law actions including those for theft, damage to property, deposit, and production of property. All of these could, I suppose, be used to protect trade secrets, etc., but there is no evidence they were. It is bizarre to see any degree the Roman actio servi corrupti as the counterpart of modern law for the protection of trade secrets and other such commercial interests.&lt;ref name="watson"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===19th century===

Trade secret law as we know it today made its first appearance in England in 1817 in ''[[Newbery v. James]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Newbery v. James'', (1817) 2 Mer. 446, 35 Eng. Rep. 1011, 1013 (Ct. Ch. 1817)&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|1=History|date=October 2014|reason=See doubts raised at [[Talk:Trade secret/Archives/2014#History]]}} and in the United States in 1837 in ''[[Vickery v. Welch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Vickery v. Welch'', 36 Mass. (19 Pick.) 523, 527 (1837)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="surprising"&gt;See The Surprising Virtues of Treating Trade Secrets as IP Rights'', 61 Stan. L. Rev. at 315 &amp; n.6.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=October 2014|reason=please help reader by summarising these cases here in plain English}} While those cases involved the first known common law causes of action based on a modern concept of trade secret laws, neither involved injunctive relief; rather, they involved damages only.&lt;ref name="surprising" /&gt; In England, the first case involving injunctive relief came in 1820 in ''Yovatt v Winyard'',&lt;ref&gt;''Yovatt v. Winyard'', (1820) 37 Eng. Rep. 425, 426 (Ch.)&lt;/ref&gt; while in the United States, it took until the 1866 case ''Taylor v. Blanchard''.&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v. Blanchard'', 95 Mass. (13 Allen) 370 (1866)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See The Surprising Virtues of Treating Trade Secrets as IP Rights'', 61 Stan. L. Rev. at 315 &amp; n.7; ''but see Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp.'', 416 U.S. 470, 493 n.23, 94 S.Ct. 1879, 1892 n.23, 40 L.Ed.2d 315 (1974) (trade secret law imported into the United States from England in 1868 in ''Peabody v. Norfolk'', 98 Mass. 452 (1868))&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=October 2014|reason=please summarise each example, please wikilink jargon terms}}

Trade secrets law continued to evolve throughout the United States as a hodgepodge of state laws. In 1939, the [[American Law Institute]] issued the [[Restatement of Torts]], containing a summary of trade secret laws across states, which served as the primary resource until the latter part of the century. As of 2013, however, only four states—Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Texas—still rely on the Restatement as their primary source of guidance (other than their body of state case law).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It has also been recently{{when|date=September 2014}} theorized that the doctrine of trade secrets should protect competitively valuable, personal information of company executives, in a concept known as "executive trade secrets".

===Worldwide===

====Commonwealth nations====
In [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[common law]] jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] right rather than a [[property]] right.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=====England and Wales=====
{{See also|Breach of confidence in English law}}
The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] in the case of ''Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v. Campbell Engineering Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;''Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v. Campbell Engineering Ltd'', (1948) 65 P.R.C. 203&lt;/ref&gt; held that the action for breach of confidence is based on a principle of preserving "good faith".

The test for a cause of action for breach of confidence in the [[common law]] world is set out in the case of ''Coco v. A.N. Clark (Engineers) Ltd'':&lt;ref&gt;''Coco v. A.N. Clark (Engineers) Ltd'', (1969) R.P.C. 41 at 47&lt;/ref&gt;

* The information itself must have the necessary quality of confidence about it;
* That information must have been imparted in circumstances imparting an obligation of confidence;
* There must be an unauthorized use of that information to the detriment of the party communicating it.

The "quality of confidence" highlights that trade secrets are a legal concept. With sufficient effort or through illegal acts (such as breaking and entering), competitors can usually obtain trade secrets. However, so long as the owner of the trade secret can prove that reasonable efforts have been made to keep the information confidential, the information remains a trade secret and generally remains legally protected. Conversely, trade secret owners who cannot evidence reasonable efforts at protecting confidential information risk losing the trade secret, even if the information is obtained by competitors illegally. It is for this reason that trade secret owners shred documents and do not simply recycle them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

A successful plaintiff is entitled to various forms of [[judicial relief]], including:

* An [[injunction]]
* An [[account of profits]] or an award of [[damages]]
* A [[Declaration (law)|declaration]]

=====Hong Kong=====
[[Hong Kong]] does not follow the traditional commonwealth approach, instead recognizing trade secrets where a judgment of the High Court indicates that confidential information may be a property right.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

====European Union====
The EU adopted a [[Directive on the Protection of Trade Secrets]] on 27 May 2016.&lt;ref name=eudirective&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade secrets|url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/intellectual-property/trade-secrets_en|website=European Commission|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the directive is to harmonize the definition of trade secrets in accordance with existing international standards, and the means of obtaining protection of trade secrets within the EU.&lt;ref name=eudirective/&gt;

====United States====
Within the U.S., trade secrets generally encompass a company's proprietary information that is not generally known to its competitors, and which provides the company with a competitive advantage.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Although trade secrets law evolved under state common law, prior to 1974, the question of whether patent law preempted state trade secrets law had been unanswered.  In 1974, the [[United States Supreme Court]] issued the landmark decision, ''Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp.,'' which resolved the question in favor of allowing the states to freely develop their own trade secret laws.&lt;ref&gt;''Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp.'', 416 U.S. 470, 94 S.Ct. 1879, 40 L.Ed.2d 315 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====State law=====
In 1979 several U.S. states adopted the [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]] (UTSA), which was further amended in 1985, with approximately 47 states having adopted some variation of it as the basis for trade secret law. Another significant development is the [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996|Economic Espionage Act (EEA) of 1996]] ({{usc|18|1831|1839}}), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. 

This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity.
# {{uscsub|18|1831|a}}, criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers.
# {{usc|18|1832}}, criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes.
The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.
The EEA was extended in 2016 to allow companies to file civil suits in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericgoldman/2016/04/28/the-new-defend-trade-secrets-act-is-the-biggest-ip-development-in-years/|title=The New 'Defend Trade Secrets Act' Is The Biggest IP Development In Years|journal=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]|date=April 28, 2016|first=Eric|last=Goldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Federal law=====
On May 11, 2016, President Obama signed the [[Defend Trade Secrets Act]] (DTSA), 18 U.S.C.§§1839 et seq., which for the first time created a federal cause of action for misappropriating trade secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2016/05/24/defintion-trade-secret-dtsa/id=69262/|title=Definition of a 'Trade Secret' Under the DTSA|last=Toren|first=Peter J.|date=May 24, 2016|publisher=IPWatchdog|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DTSA provides for both a private right of action for damages and injunction and a civil action for injunction brought by the Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/news/2016/06/protections_of_then.html|title=Protections of the Newly Enacted Defend Trade Secrets Act|last=Kelton|first=Jeff|date=June 24, 2016|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The statute followed state laws on liability in significant part, defining trade secrets in the same way as the Uniform Trade Secrets Act as,
{{quote|"all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information, including patterns, plans, compilations, program devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs, or codes, whether tangible or intangible, and whether or how stored, compiled, or memorialized physically, electronically, graphically, photographically, or in writing if (A) the owner thereof has taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret; and (B) the information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, another person who can obtain economic value from the disclosure or use of the information."}}
However, the law contains several important differences from prior law.
# Because it is a federal law, trade secret cases can be prosecuted in federal courts with concomitant procedural advantages.
# It provides for the unusual remedy of preliminary seizure of "property necessary to prevent the propagation or dissemination of the trade secret," 18 U.S.C. §1836
# It provides for remedies to include royalties in appropriate cases and exemplary damages up to two times the actual damages in cases of "willful and malicious" appropriation, 18 U.S.C. §1836(b)(3).
The DTSA also clarifies that a United States resident (including a company) can be liable for misappropriation that takes place outside the United States, and any person can be liable as long as an act in furtherance of the misappropriation takes place in the United States, 18 U.S.C. §1837. The DTSA provides the courts with broad injunctive powers.  18 U.S.C. §1836(b)(3).

The DTSA does not preempt or supplant state laws, but provides an additional cause of action.  Because states vary significantly in their approach to the "inevitable disclosure" doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;The "inevitable disclosure" doctrine allows an employee's new employment to be enjoined if the court determines that the nature of his new duties will inevitably lead to a disclosure or improper use of trade secrets of the prior employer.  It has been accepted in a number of states (see, e.g., PepsiCo, Inc. v. Redmond, 54 F.3d 1262 (7th Cir. 1995)(applying Illinois law), and flatly rejected in others (see, e.g., Schlage Lock Co. v. Whyte, 101 Cal. App. 4th 1443 (2002) (applying California law).&lt;/ref&gt; its use has limited, if any, application under the DTSA, 18 U.S.C.§1836(b)(3)(A).&lt;ref&gt;A Court may grant an injunction, provided the order does not "prevent a person from entering into an employment relationship, and that conditions placed on such employment shall be based on evidence of threatened misappropriation and not merely on the information that the person knows...." 18 U.S.C. §1836(b)(3)(A)(i)(I).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to other types of intellectual property law==
In the United States, trade secrets are not protected by law in the same manner as [[patent]]s or [[trademark]]s. Specifically, trademarks and patents are protected under federal statutes, the [[Lanham Act]] and [[United States patent law|Patent Act]], respectively. In contrast, trade secrets are protected under [[state law]]s, and most states have enacted the [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]] (UTSA), except for [[Massachusetts]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[North Carolina]]. One of the differences between patents and trademarks, on the one hand, and trade secrets, on the other, is that a trade secret is protected only when the secret is {{clarify span|text=not disclosed.|explain=by their "owner"? What about leaks?|date=March 2018}}

===Comparison with trademarks===
Nations have different trademark policies. Assuming the mark in question meets certain other standards of protectibility, trademarks are generally protected from infringement on the grounds that other uses might confuse consumers as to the origin or nature of the goods once the mark has been associated with a particular supplier. Similar considerations apply to [[service mark]]s and [[trade dress]].

By definition, a trademark enjoys no protection (''qua'' trademark) until and unless it is "disclosed" to consumers, for only then are consumers able to associate it with a supplier or source in the requisite manner. (That a company plans to ''use'' a certain trademark might itself be protectible as a trade secret, however, until the mark is actually made public.)

To acquire a [[United States trademark law|trademark rights under U.S. law]], one must simply use the mark "in commerce".&lt;ref name="USPTO-FAQ"&gt;United States Patent and Trademark Office, [http://www.uspto.gov/main/faq/index.html General Questions]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible to register a trademark in the United States, both at the federal and state levels.  Registration of trademarks confers some advantages, including stronger protection in certain respects, but registration is not required in order to get protection.&lt;ref name="USPTO-FAQ"/&gt; Registration may be required in order to file a lawsuit for trademark infringement.

===Comparison with patents===
To acquire a patent, full information about the method or product has to be supplied to the patent office and upon publication or issuance, will then be available to all. After expiration of the patent, competitors can copy the method or product legally. The temporary [[monopoly]] on the subject matter of the patent is regarded as a tradeoff for thus disclosing the information to the public.

One popular misconception held by many is that trade secret protection is incompatible with patent protection. It is typically said that if one applies for a patent one can no longer maintain a trade secret on the invention, but this is an oversimplification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordasecrets.com/2008/04/patenttrade_secret_complementa.html Jorda on Trade Secrets] by Karl Jorda&lt;/ref&gt; In order to obtain a patent, the inventor must [[sufficiency of disclosure|disclose the invention]], so that others will be able to both make and use the invention. Also, to obtain a patent in the United States, any preferences{{clarify|reason=What is meant by a "preference" here?|date=February 2016}} must likewise be disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112 |title=35 U.S.C. 112 |publisher=Uspto.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615191627/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112 |archivedate=2006-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; What is typically not appreciated though is that the critical time for satisfying this disclosure requirement is at the time the application is filed. In many if not most situations, improvements will be made to an invention even after filing of the patent application, and additional information will be learned. None of this additional information must be disclosed and can instead be kept as a secret.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/2100_2165_01.htm#sect2165.01 Considerations Relevant to Best Mode] MPEP 2165.01&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all patent licenses include clauses that require the inventor to disclose any trade secrets they have. Frequently it is this information not disclosed in the patent that is the most commercially viable. Thus, patent licensors should take steps to continue to maintain trade secrets as secrets, otherwise they will be lost. Accordingly, before disclosing any secrets not already protected by an issued patent the licensor will use a [[non-disclosure agreement]].

Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are that a trade secret is not limited in time (it "continues indefinitely as long as the secret is not revealed to the public", whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention), a trade secret does not imply any registration costs,&lt;ref name="klinkert-6"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.miplc.de/research/lecture-series/ |title=The Misappropriation of Trade Secrets in Germany and U.S. Discovery Aid |first=Friedrich |last=Klinkert |date=April 2012 |conference=[[Munich Intellectual Property Law Center|MIPLC]] Lecture Series |accessdate=May 6, 2012 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; has an immediate effect, does not require compliance with any formalities, and does not imply any disclosure of the invention to the public.&lt;ref name="klinkert-6"/&gt; The disadvantages of trade secrets include that "others may be able to legally discover the secret and be thereafter entitled to use it", "others may obtain patent protection for legally discovered secrets", and a trade secret is more difficult to enforce than a patent.&lt;ref name="klinkert-7"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.miplc.de/research/lecture-series/ |title=The Misappropriation of Trade Secrets in Germany and U.S. Discovery Aid |first=Friedrich |last=Klinkert |date=April 2012 |conference=[[Munich Intellectual Property Law Center|MIPLC]] Lecture Series |accessdate=May 6, 2012 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Trade secret regulations that mask the composition of chemical agents in [[consumer product]]s have been criticized for allowing the trade secret holders to hide the presence of potentially harmful and [[Toxicity|toxic substances]]. It has been argued that the public is being denied a clear picture of such products' safety, whereas competitors are well positioned to analyze its chemical composition.&lt;ref name=fitzgerald&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Randall Fitzgerald]]| title=[[The Hundred Year Lie]] |publisher=[[Dutton Penguin|Dutton]], 2006| page=24 |isbn=0-525-94951-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the National Environmental Trust tested 40 common consumer products; in more than half of them they found toxic substances not listed on the [[product label]].&lt;ref name=fitzgerald/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20765">The '''well-made play''' ({{lang-fr|la pièce bien faite}}, pronounced {{IPA-fr|pjɛs bjɛ̃ fɛt|}}) is a [[Drama|dramatic genre]] from [[nineteenth-century theatre]] first codified by French dramatist [[Eugène Scribe]]. Dramatists [[Victorien Sardou]], [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], and [[Emile Augier]] wrote within the genre, each putting a distinct spin on the style. The well-made play was a popular form of entertainment. By the mid-19th century, however, it had already entered into common use as a derogatory term.&lt;ref name="cgt"&gt;Banham (1998), 964, 972–3, 1191–2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henrik Ibsen]] and the other [[Realism (theatre)|realistic]] dramatists of the later 19th century ([[August Strindberg]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Émile Zola]], [[Anton Chekhov]]) built upon its technique of careful construction and preparation of effects in the genre [[problem play]]. "Through their example", Marvin Carlson explains, "the well-made play became and still remains the traditional model of [[Dramaturgy|play construction]]."&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;Carlson (1993, 216).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Scribe Eugène 2.jpg|210px|thumb| Eugène Scribe]]

In the English language, that tradition found its early 20th-century codification in Britain in the form of [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]]'s ''Play-Making: A Manual of Craftmanship'' (1912),&lt;ref&gt;Archer, William. Playmaking: a Manual of Craftsmanship. Public domain. https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10865&lt;/ref&gt; and in the United States with [[George Pierce Baker]]'s ''Dramatic Technique'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;J L Styan, ''Modern Drama in Theory and Practice I'', quoted by Innes (2000, 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
[[File:Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure.pdf|thumb|Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure]]

The form has a strong [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] flavour, involving a tight [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and a [[climax (narrative)|climax]] that takes place close to the end of the play. The well-made play retains the shape of [[Aristotle]]'s ideal [[Greek tragedy|Greek-tragedy]] model outlined in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Internet Classics Archive by Daniel C. Stevenson, Web Atomics. Web. 11 Dec. 2014. http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/poetics.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. "Poetics". Trans. Ingram Bywater. The Project Gutenberg EBook. Oxford: Clarendon P, 2 May 2009. Web. 26 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-made play can be broken down into a specific set of criteria.&lt;ref name="Camille and Other Plays"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scribe|first1=Eugene|last2=ed. introd. Stanton |first2=Stephen|title=Camille and Other Plays|date=1956|publisher=Hill and Wang|isbn=0809007061}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the story depends upon a key piece of information kept from some characters, but known to others (and to the audience). Most of the story takes place before the action of the play begins, making the beginning of the play a late point of attack. Exposition during act one explains actions that precede the opening scene, and generates the audience's sympathy for the hero (or heroes) over their rival (or rivals). The plot moves forward in a chain of actions that use minor reversals of fortune to create suspense. The pace builds towards a climactic obligatory scene, in which the hero triumphs. This scene contains a climactic reversal of fortune, or [[peripeteia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McBride|first1=Augusto Boal ; translated by Charles A. &amp; Maria-Odilia Leal|title=Theatre of the oppressed|date=1985|publisher=Theatre Communications Group|location=New York|isbn=0930452496|edition=5th print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dénouement follows, in which all remaining plot points are unraveled and resolved.&lt;ref name="Camille and Other Plays"/&gt;

A recurrent device that the well-made play employs is the use of letters or papers falling into unintended hands, in order to bring about [[plot twists]] and climaxes.&lt;ref name="Camille and Other Plays"/&gt; The letters bring about an unexpected and climactic reversal of fortune, in which it is often revealed that someone is not who they pretend to be. Mistaken or mysterious identity as a basis for plot complications is referred to as ''qui pro quo''.&lt;ref name="Stanton, Shaw's Debt to Scribe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanton|first1=Stephen S.|title=Shaw's Debt to Scribe|journal=MLA|date=December 1961|volume=76|issue=5|pages=575–585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, Beth. "Acting Out: Qui pro Quo in the Context of Interwar Warsaw." East European Politics &amp; Societies (2012): 0888325412467053.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugene Scribe]] contributed over 300 plays and opera libretti to the dramatic literature canon. Thirty-five of these works are considered well-made-plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Encyclopædia Britannica Editors|title=well-made play|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/639300/well-made-play|website=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===French Neoclassicism: a standard form===
History of French Neoclassic form lays a critical foundation for Scribe, who draws upon devices determined by the [[French Academy]] to create his dramatic structure. French Neoclassicism conceives of [[Verisimilitude]], or the appearance of a plausible truth, as the aesthetic goal of a play.&lt;ref name="Ashgate Publishing, Ltd"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ibbett|first1=Katherine|title=The Style of the State in French Theater, 1630-1660: Neoclassicism and Government.|date=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.,}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1638, the [[French Academy]] codified a system by which dramatists could achieve Verisimilitude in a verdict on the [[Pierre Corneille|Le Cid debate]].&lt;ref name="Ashgate Publishing, Ltd"/&gt;  The monarchy enforced the standards of French Neoclassicism with a system of censorship under which funding and practice permits were issued to a limited number of theater companies.&lt;ref name="Brockett &amp; Hildy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hildy|first1=Franklin J.|last2=Brockett|first2=Oscar G.|title=History of the theatre|date=2007|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=0-205-47360-1|edition=Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This system underwent small modifications, but remained essentially the same up until the [[French Revolution]]. Until then, restrictive laws inhibited the growth of new practices with the exception of those advocated by a few intrepid dramatists such as [[Voltaire]], [[Diderot]], and [[Beaumarchais]]. After the [[French Revolution]], adherence to the form became an artistic choice instead of a political necessity.

===Boulevard theatres: new forms===
Although Scribe drew heavily upon Neoclassic devices, he used them in original ways that would not have been acceptable without new popular forms, such as those developed at the Boulevard theatres.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Frederick|title=Theater and Revolution: the culture of the French stage|date=1980|publisher=Viking Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to work around the formal monopoly of the [[Comédie Française]] in the middle of the 18th century, theater troupes experimenting with new dramatic forms sprang up along the Boulevard du Temple. Their aim was to escape the censors, and please the public. Popular reception of the boulevard theatres' explorations helped to crack the edifice of Neoclassic form.&lt;ref name="History of the theatre"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hildy|first1=Oscar G. Brockett ; Franklin J.|title=History of the theatre|date=2007|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=0-205-47360-1|edition=Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the French Revolution, French theater opened to the influence of practices that had meanwhile developed in other places around Europe.&lt;ref name="French Revolution, Carlson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Marvin A.|title=The Theatre of the French Revolution|date=1966|publisher=Cornell UP|location=Ithaca, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scribe's development of a form that could be used repeatedly to turn out new material suited the demands of a growing middle class theater audience.&lt;ref name=Stanton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanton|first1=edited, with an introduction to the well-made play by Stephen S.|title=Camille, and other plays|date=1999|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=New York|isbn=0809007061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===On Scribe, Dumas fils, Augier, and Sardou===

Scribe's influence on theater, according to Marvin J. Carlson, "cannot be overestimated".&lt;ref name="Cornell UP"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Marvin|title=Theories of the Theatre: A Historical and Critical Survey from the Greeks to the Present|date=1984|publisher=Cornell UP|location=Ithaca and London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson observes that, unlike other influential theater thinkers, Scribe did not write prefaces or manifestos declaiming his ideas. Scribe influenced theater, instead, with craftsmanship. He honed a dramatic form into a reliable mould that could be applied not only to different content, but to different content from a variety of playwrights. Carlson identifies a single instance of Scribe's critical commentary from a speech Scribe gave to the Académie française in 1836. Scribe expressed his view of what draws the audiences to theater:

"not for instruction or improvement, but for diversion and distraction, and that which diverts them [audience] most is not truth, but fiction. To see again what you have before your eyes daily will not please you, but that which is not available to you in every day life - the extraordinary and the romantic."&lt;ref name="Cornell UP"/&gt;

Although Scribe advocated for a theater of amusement over didacticism, other writers, beginning with [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], adopted Scribe's structure to create didactic plays. In a letter to a critic, Dumas ''fils'' states,"... if I can find some means to force people to discuss the problem, and the lawmaker to revise the law, I shall have done more than my duty as a writer, I shall have done my duty as a man.".&lt;ref name="History of the theatre"/&gt; Dumas' thesis plays are plays written in the well-made style that take clear moral positions on social issues of the day. [[Emile Augier]] also used Scribe's formula to write plays addressing contemporary social issues, although he declares his moral position less strongly.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, John Russell. The Rise and Fall of the Well-Made Play, Great Britain: Routledge, Cox and Wyman, Ltd.,1967. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, the well-made play had fallen out of critical favor.&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Martin, ed. 1998. The Cambridge Guide to Theatre. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-43437-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw was among those who held the form in low regard, "Why the devil should a man write like Scribe when he can write like Shakespeare or Moliere, Aristophanes or Euripides? Who was Scribe that he should dictate to me or anyone else how a play should be written?"&lt;ref name="Stanton, Shaw's Debt to Scribe" /&gt; In reference to the form's tendency to favor amusing plot twists over complexly drawn characters, Shaw referred to the genre as Sardoodledom after [[Victorien Sardou]], who also wrote in the well-made style.&lt;ref name="Stanton, Shaw's Debt to Scribe" /&gt;

===Shaw and Ibsen===
The opening to the preface to ''Three Plays by Brieux'' offers another example of Shavian disdain for the well-made plays. Shaw identifies the process of creating them as an industry, and their creators as “literary mechanics” instead of artists. To convey how vulgar he finds a widely used playwrighting formula, Shaw interprets the aphorism "Art for art's sake," as "Success for money's sake."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, George Bernard. ‘’Three Plays by Brieux’’. New York: Brentano’s, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay published in [[Modern Language Association|PMLA]] in 1951, ''Pygmalion: Bernard Shaw’s Dramatic Theory and Practice'', Milton Crane reasons that Shaw’s disparagement of the classic well-made formula, and his desire to pry Ibsen’s work away from association with the works of Scribe and Sardou, serve a specific agenda. Crane argues that Shaw aims to prevent his own use of the well-made formula from linking his plays with work considered out of fashion. Shaw’s theory of the [[problem play]] and discussion ideas align his plays with Ibsen’s, and distinguishes them from stale plays of the past. Crane observes that Shaw, by his own admission, learned dramatic structure from contemporary popular theatre which was then dominated by the well-made formula.&lt;ref name="Stanton, Shaw's Debt to Scribe" /&gt; Crane goes on to argue how that formula is present in [[List of works by George Bernard Shaw|''Pygmalion'', ''Man and Superman'', and ''The Doctor’s Dilemma'']].&lt;ref&gt;Crane, Milton. "Pygmalion: Bernard Shaw's Dramatic Theory and Practice." PMLA 66.6 (1951): 879-85. JSTOR [JSTOR]. Web. 4 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The problem play====
 [[File:Henrik Ibsen as a young man.jpg|thumb|Henrik Ibsen as a young man]]

Shaw discusses the notion of the [[problem play]] in an essay of the same title published in 1895.&lt;ref name="Problem Play from Shaw on Theatre"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=George Bernard|editor1-last=West|editor1-first=E.J.|title=Shaw on Theatre|date=1958|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang|location=New York|chapter=Problem Play}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines a problem play as one that puts a person or people in conflict with an institution, confronting a contemporary social question. He cites the "Woman question" as a contemporary example. Ibsen's engagement with the "Woman question" in ''[[A Doll's House]]'' and ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' qualifies those works as problem plays. Shaw distinguishes between the problem play and literature with conflicts reflecting a more universal view of the human condition. Works whose fundamental conflict does not pit human against institution, he argues, are more apt to remain relevant through generations. He cites ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', and ''[[Les Misérables]]'' as examples of stories whose conflicts involve more eternal human questions. Shaw observes that the immediacy of the institutional question addressed in a problem play will render the play "flat as ditchwater" once society progresses and the issue is resolved.&lt;ref name="Problem Play from Shaw on Theatre" /&gt; Although Ibsen was hailed by feminists, he did not regard himself as an advocate for any particular group.&lt;ref&gt;Innes, Christopher. "Henrik Ibsen, Speech at the Festival of the Norwegian Women's Rights League, Christiana, 26 May 1898." A Sourcebook on Naturalist Theatre. London: Routledge, 2000. 74-75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The well-made play and modern drama====
Ibsen's aim, according to Raymond Williams, was to express tragedies in the human condition. Ibsen qualifies a human tragedy as the state "[when a person] stands in a tight place; he cannot go forwards or backwards.”&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Raymond|title=Drama from Ibsen to Brecht|date=1973|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|isbn=978-0140214925|edition=2nd rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also cites the specific characteristic that distinguishes his and Ibsen's modern drama from the preceding well-made formula. The well-made formula, Shaw observes, can be divided into three sections: Exposition, Situation, Unraveling. The plays of Ibsen and Shaw, Shaw himself asserts, do not end with a classic unraveling. Their work can be divided as: Exposition, Situation, Discussion.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

==Offshoots==
[[Oscar Wilde|Oscar Wilde's]] ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' exaggerates many of the conventions of the well-made play, such as the missing papers conceit (the hero, as an infant, was confused with the manuscript of a novel) and a final revelation (which, in this play, occurs about thirty seconds before the final curtain).&lt;ref name="Stanton, Shaw's Debt to Scribe" /&gt;

[[Henrik Ibsen|Henrik Ibsen's]] ''[[A Doll's House]]'' follows most of the conceits of the well-made play, but transcends the genre when, after incriminating papers are recovered, Nora rejects the expected return to normality.  Several of Ibsen's subsequent plays build on the general construction principles of the well-made play.  ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (1884) can be seen as a deliberate, meta-theatrical deconstruction of the [[Eugène Scribe|Scribean]] formula.  Ibsen sought a compromise between [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] and the well-made play which was fraught with difficulties since life does not fall easily into either form.&lt;ref&gt;Elsom, John. ''Post-War British Theatre''. London: Routledge, 1976, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[George Bernard Shaw]] scorned the "well-made play", he accepted the form, and even thrived by it, for it concentrated his skills on the conversation among characters, his greatest asset as a dramatist.&lt;ref&gt;Elsom, John. ''Post-War British Theatre''. London: Routledge, 1976, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other classic twists on the well-made play can be seen in his use of the General's coat and the hidden photograph in ''[[Arms and the Man]]''.

Also, [[J. B. Priestley]]'s 1946 ''[[An Inspector Calls]]'' may in some ways be considered a "well-made play" in that its action happens before the play starts, and in the case of the older Birlings no moral change takes place. The similarity between Priestley's play and this rather conservative genre might strike some readers/audiences as surprising because Priestley was a socialist. However, his play, like Ibsen's ''A Doll's House'' transcends this genre by providing another plunge into chaos after the return to normality.  He replaced the dramatic full stop with a question mark by revealing in the last scene that the 'inspector' who has exposed the complicity of a prosperous industrial family in the murder or suicide of a working-class girl, is not an inspector at all (perhaps a practical joker, an emanation of the world to come, or a manifestation of the world to come), and the curtain falls on the news that a real girl has died and a real inspector is on the way.&lt;ref&gt;Elsom, John. ''Post-War British Theatre''. London: Routledge, 1976, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques of well-made plays also lend themselves to comedies of situation, often [[farce]]. In ''[[Quintessence of Ibsenism|The Quintessence of Ibsenism]]'', [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] proposed that [[Ibsen]] converted this formula for use in "serious" plays by substituting discussion for the plausible dénouement or conclusion. Thus, plays become open-ended, as if there were life for the [[protagonist]]s beyond the last act curtain.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard. The Quintessence of Ibsenism. New York: Brentano's, 1913. Print.

'''Wendy Carlos''' (born '''Walter Carlos''';&lt;!-- Notable before coming out. See [[MOS:BIRTHNAME]]. Please don't remove this without first getting consensus on the talk page. --&gt; November 14, 1939) is an American musician and composer best known for her [[electronic music]] and film scores. Born and raised in [[Rhode Island]], Carlos studied physics and music at [[Brown University]] before moving to [[New York City]] in 1962 to study music composition at [[Columbia University]]. Studying and working with various electronic musicians and technicians at the city's [[Computer Music Center|Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center]], she oversaw the development of the [[Moog synthesizer]], then a relatively new and unknown keyboard instrument designed by [[Robert Moog]].

Carlos came to prominence with ''[[Switched-On Bach]]'' (1968), an album of music by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] performed on a Moog synthesizer which helped popularize its use in the 1970s and won her three [[Grammy Awards]]. Its commercial success led to several more keyboard albums from Carlos of varying genres including further synthesized classical music adaptations and [[experimental music|experimental]] and [[ambient music]]. She composed the score to two [[Stanley Kubrick]] films, ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1971) and ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980), and also ''[[Tron]]'' (1982) for [[Walt Disney Productions]].

In 1979, Carlos was one of the first public figures to disclose having undergone [[gender reassignment surgery]].

==Early life==
[[File:Wendy Carlos HS Project.jpeg|thumb|Carlos demonstrating stereo sound for a high school science project, 1958.]]
Carlos was born in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]], [[Rhode Island]], the first of two children born to working-class parents.&lt;ref name=playboy1979/&gt; Her mother played the piano and sang and had an uncle who played the trombone and another who played the trumpet and drums.&lt;ref name=playboy1979/&gt; She began piano lessons at six years of age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wendycarlos.com/biog.html |title=Wendy Carlos: Biographical Notes |publisher=WendyCarlos.com |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote her first composition, "A Trio for Clarinet, Accordion, and Piano", at ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/wendycarlos.html |title=The Burden of Faltering Genius |first=Mark S. |last=Tucker |publisher=Perfect Sound Forever |date=May 2007 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos attended [[St. Raphael Academy]], a Catholic high school in Pawtucket. In 1953, at fourteen, Carlos won a scholarship for a home-built computer at the [[Intel Science Talent Search|Westinghouse Science Fair]], a research-based science competition for [[high-school]] students. From 1958 to 1962, Carlos studied at [[Brown University]] and graduated with a degree in music and physics, during which she taught lessons in [[electronic music]] at informal sessions.&lt;ref name=sonicseasoningssleeve/&gt;

In 1965, Carlos graduated from [[Columbia University]] with a master's degree in music composition, during which she scored several films for students and a film maker for [[UNICEF]],&lt;ref name=filmscoremonthly/&gt; and assisted [[Leonard Bernstein]] to present an evening of electronic music at the [[David Geffen Hall|Philharmonic Hall]].&lt;ref name=sonicseasoningssleeve/&gt; Carlos studied with [[Vladimir Ussachevsky]] and [[Otto Luening]], two pioneers of electronic music in the 1960s; the four were based in the [[Computer Music Center|Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center]] in [[New York City]], the first of its kind in the United States. After Ussachevsky suggested to Carlos that she work in a recording studio to support herself, Carlos began working as a recording and [[Audio mastering|mastering]] engineer at Gotham Recording Studios in New York City; she worked in this position until 1968.&lt;ref name=playboy1979/&gt;&lt;ref name=sonicseasoningssleeve&gt;{{Cite AV media notes|title=Sonic Seasonings|publisher=Columbia Records|id=KG 31234|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goldmine2004&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.wendycarlos.com/other/PDF-Files/goldmine-miller.pdf|journal=Goldmine|date=January 23, 2004|accessdate=February 12, 2016|first=Chuck|last=Miller|title=Wendy Carlos: In the Moog|pages=47–48|edition=613}}&lt;/ref&gt; She called it "a really lovely occupation" and found it a useful learning experience.&lt;ref name=goldmine2004/&gt;

During her time at Columbia, Carlos met [[Robert Moog]] at the annual [[Audio Engineering Society]] show,&lt;ref name=WholeEarth /&gt; which began a partnership; Carlos gave advice and technical assistance in the development of the [[Moog synthesizer]], Moog's new electronic keyboard instrument, convincing Moog to add a touch-sensitive device for greater musical dynamics, among other improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Holmes, Thom |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCthQ-bec-QC&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Electronic and Experimental Music: Technology, Music, and Culture |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |date=2008 |page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1966, Carlos owned a small Moog synthesizer, which she used to record sound effects and jingles for television commercials, which earned her "anywhere from $100 to $1000".&lt;ref name=playboy1979/&gt; In 1967, Carlos befriended [[Rachel Elkind]], a former singer&lt;ref name=playboy1979/&gt; who had a musical theatre background and worked as a secretary for [[Goddard Lieberson]], then-president of [[Columbia Records]]. The two shared a home, studio, and business premises in a [[brownstone|brownstone building]] in the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] of [[Manhattan]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=keyboardmagazine1982&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.wendycarlos.com/other/PDF-Files/KbdInterview-82*.pdf|title=Wendy Carlos: New Directions for a Synthesizer Pioneer|journal=Keyboard|date=November 1982|first=Robert|last=Moog|pages=51–52, 58–63|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlos wrote several compositions as a student. Two were recorded and released on ''By Request'' (1975), titled "Dialogues for Piano and Two Loudspeakers" (1963) and "Episodes for Piano and Electronic Sound" (1964). Others include "Variations for Flute and Electronic Sounds" (1964), "Episodes for Piano and Tape" (1964), "Pomposities for Narrator and Tape" (1965), and "Noah" (1965), an opera blending electronics with an orchestra. Her first commercial release was ''Moog 900 Series&amp;nbsp;– Electronic Music Systems'', an introduction to the technical aspects of the Moog synthesizer released in 1967.&lt;ref name="carlos_moog"&gt;{{cite web |title=Walter Carlos – Moog 900 Series – Electronic Music Systems |publisher=discogs.com |url=http://www.discogs.com/Walter-Carlos-Moog-900-Series-Electronic-Music-Systems/release/1820482 |accessdate=January 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of her compensation for making the recording was in Moog equipment.&lt;ref name=WholeEarth /&gt;

==Career==

===1960s===
[[File:Moog Synthesizer 3P (1972), CRuNCh Lab.jpg|thumb|right|A modular Moog synthesizer, designed by [[Robert Moog]], which Carlos helped popularize]]
Carlos began her music career with ''[[Switched-On Bach]]'', an album formed of several pieces by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] performed on a [[Moog modular synthesizer]]. The idea came about around 1967, when Carlos asked Elkind to listen to some compositions written by Carlos and musicologist Benjamin Folkman ten years prior at the Electronic Music Center, one of them being Bach's [[Inventions and Sinfonias (Bach)|Two-Part Invention in F major]], which Elkind took a liking to. Plans for an album of several Bach compositions developed from there, leading to a recording contract with [[Columbia Masterworks Records|Columbia Masterworks]] through Elkind's contacts, a deal that lasted until 1986. The label had launched an album sales campaign named "Bach to Rock", though it had no album of Bach's works in a contemporary context in its catalogue.&lt;ref name=playboy1979/&gt; With a $2,500 advance,&lt;ref name=people1985/&gt; Columbia granted Carlos and Elkind artistic freedom to produce and release the album. Carlos performs with additional synthesizers played by Folkman and Elkind as producer. Recording was a dragged out and time-consuming process as the instrument could only be played [[monophony|one note at a time]].&lt;ref name=SeattlePI /&gt;

Released in October 1968, ''Switched-On Bach'' became an unexpected commercial and critical success and helped to draw attention to the synthesizer as a genuine musical instrument.&lt;ref name=SeattlePI&gt;{{cite web |last=Barbrick |first=Greg |title=Book Review: Keyboard Presents Synth Gods |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/blogcritics/article/Book-Review-Keyboard-Presents-Synth-Gods-Edited-1306589.php |publisher=Seattle Post-Intellegencer |accessdate=July 25, 2012 |quote=Switched On Bach almost single-handedly revolutionized the public's perception of synthesizers...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTMockBach&gt;{{cite news |last=Henahan |first=Donal |title=Switching On to Mock Bach |page=Page D26 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C03E6D7153BE73ABC4B53DFB7678383679EDE |accessdate=July 25, 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 3, 1968 |quote=...possibly one of the year's more significant records}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' dedicated a full page to Carlos with the caption "Plugging into the [[Steinway]] of the future".&lt;ref name=playboy1979/&gt; It peaked at No. 10 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and was No. 1 on its Classical Albums chart from January 1969 to January 1972. It is the second classical album to sell over one million copies and was certified [[RIAA certification|Gold]] in 1969 and Platinum in 1986 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database |title=Searchable Database |website=[[RIAA]]}}&lt;!-- Search for "Switched on Bach" in quotes.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TimeMusic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903305,00.html |work=TIME.com |title=Music: Switched-Off Bach |date=February 14, 1972 |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos performed selections from the album on stage with a synthesizer with the [[St. Louis Symphony|St. Louis Symphony Orchestra]], the first of only two live performances since her days as a student (the other being with the Kurzweil Baroque Ensemble for 'Bach at the Beacon' in 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/02/arts/play-it-jazzy-switched-on-or-straight-it-s-bach.html|title=Play It Jazzy, Switched On Or Straight, It's Bach|first=James R.|last=Oestreich|date=April 2, 1997|publisher=|accessdate=February 26, 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=people1985&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20091206,00.html|title=After a Sex Change and Several Eclipses, Wendy Carlos Treads a New Digital Moonscape|date=July 1, 1985|journal=People|first=Susan|last=Reed|volume=24|edition=1|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, the album won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Album|Best Classical Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (with or without orchestra)|Best Classical Performance&amp;nbsp;– Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (With or Without Orchestra)]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Classical|Best Engineered Classical Recording]]. Carlos released a follow-up, ''[[The Well-Tempered Synthesizer]]'', with synthesized pieces from multiple composers. Released in November 1969, the album reached No. 199 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and received two Grammy nominations. The success of both albums allowed Carlos to move into Elkind's more spacious New York City home in 1971.&lt;ref name=playboy1979/&gt;

===1970s===
After the release of ''Switched-On Bach'', Carlos was invited to compose the soundtrack of two science fiction films, ''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]'' (1969), directed by [[John Sturges]], and ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1971) by [[Stanley Kubrick]]. When the directors of ''Marooned'' changed their minds about including a soundtrack, Carlos chose to work with Kubrick, as she and Elkind were fans of his previous films, adding: "We finally wound up talking with someone who had a close connection to Stanley Kubrick's lawyer. We suddenly got an invitation to fly to London."&lt;ref name=filmscoremonthly&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.wendycarlos.com/other/PDF-Files/FSM-Interview*.pdf|journal=Winter Score Monthly|date=March 1999|first=Jeff|last=Bond|pages=18–23|title=A Clockwork Composer|accessdate=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Carlos knew about the offer, she read the book and began writing a piece based on it named "Timesteps". A soundtrack containing only the film cuts of the score was released as ''[[A Clockwork Orange (soundtrack)|Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange]]'' in 1972, combining synthesized and classical music by [[Henry Purcell]], [[Beethoven]] and [[Gioacchino Rossini]] with an early use of a [[vocoder]]. The album peaked the ''Billboard'' 200 chart at No. 146.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/wendy-carlos-clockwork-orange-mw0000046193/awards ''Wendy Carlos' Clockwork Orange'' Awards. AllMusic].&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Carlos released an album of music not included in the final score titled ''[[Walter Carlos' Clockwork Orange]]''. Carlos later described the project as "a lot of fun ... a pleasurable venture".&lt;ref name=filmscoremonthly/&gt;

Carlos experimented with [[ambient music]] on her third studio album ''[[Sonic Seasonings]]'', released as a [[double album]] in 1972, with one long track dedicated to each of the [[Season|four seasons]]. Recorded as early as 1970 and finished in mid-1971, before the ''A Clockwork Orange'' project was complete, Carlos wished to produce music that did not require "lengthy concentrated listening", but more than a collection of ambient noises to portray an environment.&lt;ref name=newmusicbox2007&gt;{{Cite web|title=Wendy's World|publisher=[[NewMusicBox]]|date=1 April 2007|first=Frank J.|last=Oteri}}&lt;/ref&gt; It combined [[field recording]]s of animals and nature with synthesized sounds, occasionally employing melodies, to create [[soundscape]]s. It reached No. 168 in the ''Billboard'' 200 and influenced other artists who went on to pursue the ambient and [[New-age music|new-age]] genres in later years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/sonic-seasonings-r208076 |title=Sonic Seasonings |publisher=All Music |first=John |last=Bush |accessdate=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1973, Columbia/[[CBS Records International|CBS Records]] had received a considerable number of requests for Carlos to produce another album of synthesized classical music. She agreed to the request, opting to produce a sequel to ''Switched-On Bach'', which began with her and Elkind seeking compositions that were most suitable for the synthesizer; the two picked selections from [[Orchestral suites (Bach)|Suite No. 2 in B minor]], [[Inventions and Sinfonias (Bach)|Two-Part Inventions in A minor and major]], Suite from [[Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach]], and [[Brandenburg Concertos|Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 in D major]]. The latter features a [[Yamaha]] [[Electone|E-5 Electone organ]] for certain passages, as a reliable [[polyphony|polyphonic]] keyboard had not been developed. The result, ''[[Switched-On Bach II]]'', was released in 1973 and sold over 70,000 copies in the US during the first five weeks of its release.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vQcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=%22sonic+seasonings%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWl9LnwvXKAhUDwBQKHWVoBpgQ6AEIPDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sonic%20seasonings%22&amp;f=false 16 February 1974 edition of ''Billboard'' magazine, page 27].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''Switched-On Bach II'', Carlos changed musical directions once more. In 1971, she and Elkind asked Columbia Records to attach a pre-paid business reply card in each new pressing of her albums, which resulted in a considerable amount of suggestions from the public regarding the subject of her future releases.&lt;ref name=byrequest1975&gt;{{Cite AV media notes|title=By Request|publisher=Columbia Masterworks Records|id=M 32088|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas received were divided; some asked for more classical adaptations, while others wanted more of Carlos' original compositions. Carlos decided, "If I was going to spend months for mere minutes of music, I certainly wasn't going to be pigeonholed into only retreading existing music", and so began a process of "re-directing new ideas, reworking old ones". By mid-1974, Carlos and Elkind had selected tracks of varying styles to record on the Moog synthesizer, which Carlos found liberating, as it demonstrated the flexibility of the instrument.&lt;ref name=byrequest2003&gt;{{Cite AV media notes|title=By Request (Reissue)|publisher=East Side Digital|id=ESD 81692|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released as ''By Request'' in 1975, the album includes pieces from Bach, [[Wagner]], [[Tchaikovsky]], two of Carlos' compositions from the 1960s, and renditions of "[[Eleanor Rigby]]" by [[The Beatles]] and "[[What's New Pussycat? (song)|What's New Pussycat?]]", originally sung by [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]].&lt;ref name=byrequest1975/&gt; The final track, a "witty and serious" set of variations based on themes by [[Edward Elgar]], was replaced with tracks from ''The Well-Tempered Synthesizer'' on UK pressings after members of Elgar's estate refused to have his music presented in a less than serious light, which "devastated" Carlos.&lt;ref name=byrequest2003/&gt; ''By Request'' was followed by ''[[Switched-On Brandenburgs]]'', a double album containing all six of Bach's ''[[Brandenburg Concertos]]'' played on a synthesizer, in 1979.

===1980s===
Carlos reunited with Kubrick to compose the score for his psychological horror film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980). Before filming began, Carlos and Elkind read the [[The Shining (novel)|book]], as per Kubrick's suggestion, for musical inspiration. Carlos recorded a considerable amount of music, but Kubrick ended up using existing music by several [[avant-garde]] composers he had used as guide tracks in the final version. ''The Shining (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)'', released in 1980 on [[Warner Bros. Records]], features two tracks credited to Carlos and Elkind: the main title theme and "Rocky Mountains", the former a reinterpretation of the "Dies Irae" section of ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'' by [[Hector Berlioz]]. Some of Carlos' music had some legal issues regarding its release, but much of it was made available in 2005 as part of her two-volume compilation album ''Rediscovering Lost Scores''.

With work on ''The Shining'' complete, Elkind ended her long-time collaboration with Carlos when she moved to [[France]] with her husband in 1980. Carlos remained in New York City, sharing a converted loft in [[Greenwich Village]] with her new business partner Annemarie Franklin, which housed her new, remodelled studio, which was enclosed in a [[Faraday cage]] to shield the equipment from [[white noise]] and outside interference from radio and television signals.&lt;ref name="carlos_photos_page"&gt;{{cite web |last=Carlos |first=Wendy |title=Studio Collection |url=http://www.wendycarlos.com/photos.html#studios |publisher=wendycarlos.com |accessdate=June 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlos' first project with Franklin began around 1980, when [[The Walt Disney Company]] asked her to record the soundtrack to its science fiction feature ''[[Tron]]'' (1982). Carlos agreed, but was not interested in composing solely with electronic music, as she wished to incorporate an orchestra with her musical ideas. She recalled their demands were "tightly specified ... there wasn't a lot of elbow room, and that made it fun".&lt;ref name=filmscoremonthly/&gt; The score incorporated Carlos' analog and [[digital synthesizers]] with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]], the UCLA Chorus, and the [[Royal Albert Hall Organ]]. ''[[Tron (soundtrack)|Tron: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'' was released in 1982 and reached No. 135 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Carlos intended to release her scores on her own album, but Columbia/CBS showed a lack of interest in the prospect.&lt;ref name=filmscoremonthly/&gt;

Three studio albums from Carlos were released in the 1980s. The first was ''[[Digital Moonscapes]]'' in 1984, Carlos' first to only feature digital synthesizers. She wrote the album's tracks for orchestra "or orchestra replica", inspired by various astronomical subjects, which used some leftover material from her score to ''Tron''. Soon after, Carlos secured a deal with Audion Records, a smaller label, as she wished to "get away from that kind of big, monolithic government-like aspect that [she] had dealt with for so many years".&lt;ref name=goldmine2004/&gt; In 1986, Audion released ''[[Beauty in the Beast]]'', which saw Carlos experiment with [[just intonation]], [[Bali]]nese scales, and four new scales she devised for the album: [[Harmonic scale|Harmonic]], [[Alpha scale|Alpha]], [[Beta scale|Beta]], and [[Gamma scale|Gamma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carlos |first1=Wendy |title=Tuning:At the Crossroads |journal=Computer Music Journal |date=1986 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=29–43 |doi=10.2307/3680176 |jstor=3680176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album features the first instance of a 35-note [[octave]].&lt;ref name=goldmine2004/&gt; Carlos considers the album as the most important of her career. She followed the album with ''Secrets of Synthesis'' in 1987, her final album for CBS/Columbia, featuring several introductions and demonstrations of synthesized music from Carlos with audio examples from her previous albums.

In 1988, CBS Records asked Carlos to collaborate with comical musician [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] to release a parody of ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'' by [[Sergei Prokofiev]]. Carlos agreed to the project, as she felt it presented a chance "to let your sense of humor out of the cage".&lt;ref name=goldmine2004/&gt; Yankovic adapted and narrated its story, while Carlos rearranged the music with a "[[MIDI]] orchestra", her first venture using the digital interface.&lt;ref name=goldmine2004/&gt; The album's second side also contains a humorous adaptation of ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'' by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] titled "The Carnival of the Animals–Part II", with Yankovic providing funny poems for each of the featured animals in the style of poet [[Ogden Nash]], who did similar for the original.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-07-25/features/8902200286_1_ex-police-sting-tune/2 "Weirdly Normal: Pop-tune Buster Al Yankovic Saves Worst Wackiness For The Screen"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', July 25, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Released in October 1988, ''[[Peter and the Wolf ("Weird Al" Yankovic &amp; Wendy Carlos album)|Peter and the Wolf/Carnival of the Animals–Part II]]'' was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Album for Children]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1989-237.html|title=Grammy Awards 1989|publisher=Awards &amp; Shows|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s–present===
To mark the 25th anniversary of ''Switched-On Bach'', Carlos re-recorded the album with her set of digital instruments and recording techniques. Released in 1992 on [[Telarc International Corporation|Telarc Records]], ''Switched-On Bach 2000'' took roughly one and a half years to produce; Carlos estimated around 3,000 hours were invested in the project, which involved using several [[digital audio workstation]] software packages, including [[Pro Tools|SoundTools and ProTools]]. A Moog synthesizer is only used once on the record; the rest is performed on 13 modern synthesizers. The album also marked her first venture into mixing in [[Dolby Surround]] sound.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HhIEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=%22switched-on+bach+2000%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAmd-w2_7KAhWKwBQKHR6eD-4Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22switched-on%20bach%202000%22&amp;f=false 15 August 1992 edition of ''Billboard'' magazine, pages 67–68].&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlos wrote the soundtrack to the British film ''[[Brand New World]]'' (1998), also known as ''Woundings'', directed by [[Roberta Hanley]] and based on a play by [[Jeff Noon]]. Carlos explained the style of her music: "I was given fairly large carte blanche to do some horrific things and also some inside-psyche mood paintings, and that's what the film became".&lt;ref name=filmscoremonthly/&gt;

In 1998, Carlos released her most recent studio album, ''Tales from Heaven and Hell'', for the [[East Side Digital Records|East Side Digital]] label.

Beginning in 1998, Carlos digitally remastered her studio albums, culminating in the ''Switched-On Box Set'' released in 1999 featuring her four synthesized classical albums.

In 2005, the two-volume set ''Rediscovering Lost Scores'' was released, featuring previously out-of-print material, including the unreleased soundtrack to ''Woundings'' and music recorded for ''A Clockwork Orange'', ''The Shining'' and ''Tron'' that was not used in the films.

==Personal life==

===Gender transition===
Carlos became aware of her [[gender dysphoria]] at an early age, recalling: "I was about five or six... I remember being convinced I was a little girl, much preferring long hair and girls' clothes, and not knowing why my parents didn't see it clearly".&lt;ref name=playboy1979&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Playboy Interview: Wendy/Walter Carlos|first=Arthur|last=Bell|magazine=Playboy|publisher=Playboy Enterprises|date=May 1979|volume=26|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in college, she went on a date with a girl and felt "so jealous of her I was beside myself".&lt;ref name=people1985/&gt; When she moved to New York City in the 1960s, she learned about [[Transgender|transgender issues]] for the first time and received counselling from sexologist [[Harry Benjamin]].&lt;ref name=people1985/&gt; In early 1968, Carlos began [[Hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement treatments]], which altered her appearance.&lt;ref name=playboy1979/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.audionautas.com/2013/03/analog-days-invention-and-impact-of.html |date=March 2013 |title=Analog Days.

She cried in her hotel room and left wearing fake sideburns, a man's wig, and drew facial hair on her face with an eyebrow pencil to disguise herself as a man. Carlos did the same thing when she met Kubrick and for an appearance on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' in 1970.&lt;ref name=people1985/&gt; The commercial success of ''Switched-On Bach'' allowed Carlos to undergo [[Sex reassignment surgery (male-to-female)|sex reassignment surgery]] in May 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-ACAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=%22walter+carlos%22+wendy+sex+change&amp;as_brr=3 |title=Composer Changes More Than Tune |magazine=New York Magazine |date=April 2, 1979 |volume=12 |issue=14 |page=65 |issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she continued to release albums as "Walter Carlos" throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref name=people1985/&gt;

Carlos kept her story secret until she agreed to a series of interviews with [[Arthur Bell (journalist)|Arthur Bell]] between December 1978 and January 1979 for the May 1979 issue of ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' magazine. She chose ''Playboy'', as it has "always been concerned with liberation, and [I was] anxious to liberate myself".&lt;ref name=playboy1979/&gt; In 1985, Carlos spoke about the reaction to her transition: "The public turned out to be amazingly tolerant or, if you wish, indifferent ... There had never been any need of this charade to have taken place. It had proven a monstrous waste of years of my life."&lt;ref name=people1985/&gt;

===Lawsuit===
In 1998, Carlos sued the songwriter/artist [[Momus (musician)|Momus]] for $22&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite news |first=Fiona |last=Shepherd |title=The World Can Change in a Matter of Momus |newspaper=The Scotsman |location=UK |date=September 10, 1999 |page=23 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18707545.html |accessdate=April 15, 2013 |via=[[HighBeam]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his song "Walter Carlos" (from the album ''[[The Little Red Songbook]]'', released that year), which postulated that the post–[[sexual reassignment surgery]] Wendy could travel back in time to marry her pre-surgery self, Walter. The case was settled out of court, with Momus agreeing to remove the song from subsequent editions of the CD and owing $30,000 in legal fees.&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite news |first=Joel |last=Selvin |authorlink=Joel Selvin |author2=Vaziri, Aidin |author3=Heller, Greg |title=$1,000 Bought a Custom Song on Momus' Latest Album |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 7, 1999 |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/1999-11-07/entertainment/17707488_1_bands-nick-momus-currie-advisory-board |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
Carlos contributed a review of the then-available synthesizers to the June 1971 edition of the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]'', contrasting the [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]], [[Buchla Electronic Musical Instruments|Buchla]] and Tonus (aka [[ARP Instruments|ARP]]) systems. She was dismissive of smaller systems like the EMS [[EMS VCS 3|Putney]] and the [[Minimoog]] as "toys" and "cash-ins".&lt;ref name=WholeEarth&gt;{{cite book |title=The Last Whole Earth Catalog |date=June 1971 |isbn=0-394-70459-2 |pages=330–331 |editor=Stewart Brand |quote=Most of the "mini" versions are simply cash-in-on ignorance rip-offs, including the Mini-Moog (choke) and the Muse, and the Putney, (I've tried these toys, too) although maybe these do serve a purpose, to groups as "local color" items of the right fashionable kind.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlos is also an accomplished [[solar eclipse]] photographer.
