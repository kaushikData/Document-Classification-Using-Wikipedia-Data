[[File:Bald's Leechbook page.jpg|thumb|A [[facsimile]] page of Bald's ''Leechbook''.]]
'''''Bald's Leechbook''''' (also known as '''''Medicinale Anglicum''''') is an [[Old English]] medical text probably compiled in the ninth-century, possibly under the influence of [[Alfred the Great]]'s educational reforms.&lt;ref name=Nokes&gt;Nokes, Richard Scott ‘The several compilers of Bald’s Leechbook’ in ''Anglo-Saxon England'' 33 Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp. 51-76&lt;/ref&gt;

It takes its name from a [[Latin]] verse [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] at the end of the second book which begins ''Bald habet hunc librum Cild quem conscribere iussit'', meaning "Bald owns this book which he ordered Cild to compile."&lt;ref name=Nokes/&gt; The term ''leechbook'' is a modernisation of the Old English word ''lǣce-bōc'' ('book of medical prescriptions', literally Old English ''lǣce'' 'medical doctor' + ''bōc'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Clark Hall, J. R.]]. (1969). ''[https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~kurisuto/germanic/oe_clarkhall_about.html A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]''. 4th rev. edn by Herbet D. Meritt. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. s.vv.&lt;/ref&gt;

The text survives in only one manuscript, London, [[British Library]] [[Royal manuscripts, British Library|Royal]] [http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Royal_MS_12_D_XVII MS 12 D XVII].&lt;ref&gt;Ker, N. R. ''Catalogue of Manuscripts Containing Anglo-Saxon'', Oxford: 1957, Reprint with addenda 1990. Item 264.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript contains one further medical text, called ''Leechbook III'', which is also included in this Wikipedia entry.

==Structure and content==
Both of the two books of ''Bald's Leechbook'' are organised in a head-to-foot order, but the first book deals with external maladies and the second with internal disorders. Cameron notes that "this separation of external and internal diseases may be unique in medieval medical texts".&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, M. L., ''Anglo-Saxon Medicine'', Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England 7, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993, p 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron notes that "in Bald's ''Leechbook'' is the only [[plastic surgery]] mentioned in Anglo-Saxon records".&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, M. L., ''Anglo-Saxon Medicine'', Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England 7, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The recipe in question prescribes surgery for a [[Cleft lip and palate]].&lt;ref&gt;Leechbook i, chapter 13 (Cockayne p. 56).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron also notes that of the Old English Medical compilations "''Leechbook'' iii reflects most closely the medical practice of the Anglo-Saxons while they were still relatively free of Mediterranean influences," in contrast to Bald's ''Leechbook'' which "shows a conscious effort to transfer to Anglo-Saxon practice what one physician considered most useful in native and Mediterranean medicine," and the ''[[Lacnunga]]'', which is "a sort of [[commonplace book|common place book]] with no other apparent aim than to record whatever items of medical interest came to the scribe's attention".&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, M. L., ''Anglo-Saxon Medicine'', Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England 7, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rev. Oswald Cockayne, editor and translator of an 1865 edition of the ''Leechbook'', made note in his introduction of what he termed 'a Norse element' in the text, and gave, as example, words such as ''torbegate'', ''rudniolin'', ''ons worm'' and ''Fornets palm''.&lt;ref name="Cockayne2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Oswald Cockayne|title=Leechdoms, Wortcunning, and Starcraft of Early England: Being a Collection of Documents Illustrating the History of Science in this Country Before the Norman Conquest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtaiSC1TJYsC&amp;pg=PR32|date=15 November 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-04308-3|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cures==
One cure for headache was to bind a stalk of [[Cruciata laevipes|crosswort]] to the head with a red [[kerchief]]. [[Chilblains]] were treated with a mix of eggs, wine, and [[fennel]] root. [[Agrimonia eupatoria|Agrimony]] was cited as a cure for [[male impotence]] - when boiled in milk, it could excite a man who was "insufficiently virile;" when boiled in Welsh beer it would have the opposite effect. The remedy for [[shingles]] comprised a potion  using the bark of 15 trees: [[Populus tremula|aspen]], [[apple]], [[maple]], [[Sambucus|elder]], [[willow]], [[Salix cinerea|sallow]], [[Myrtus|myrtle]], [[wych-elm]], [[oak]], [[blackthorn]], [[birch]], [[olive]], [[dogwood]], [[fraxinus|ash]], and [[Sorbus aucuparia|quickbeam]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lacey and Danny Danziger: ''The Year 1000: What Life Was Like at the Turn of the First Millennium'' Little, Brown, 2000 {{ISBN|0-316-51157-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A remedy for aching feet called for leaves of [[Sambucus nigra|Elder]], [[plantago|Waybroad]] and [[Mugwort]] to be pounded together, applied to the feet, then the feet bound.&lt;ref name="Cockayne1865"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Oswald Cockayne|title=Leechdoms, wortcunning, and starcraft of early England: being a collection of documents, for the most part never before printed, illustrating the history of science in this country before the Norman conquest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iP9AAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA69|year=1865|publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, and Green|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another, after offering a ritualistic cure for a horse in pain requiring the words ''Bless all the works of the lord of lords'' to be inscribed on the handle of a dagger, the author adds that the pain may have been caused by an [[elf]].&lt;ref name="McKinnellAnlezark2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John McKinnell|author2=Daniel Anlezark|title=Myths, Legends, and Heroes: Essays on Old Norse and Old English Literature in Honour of John McKinnell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGPl11DewwgC&amp;pg=PA40|year=2011|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-9947-1|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, the ''Leechbook'' made the news when one of its recipes&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; which included garlic and the bile from a cow's stomach&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; was tested in the United Kingdom as a potential agent for use against [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]] (MRSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27263-anglo-saxon-remedy-kills-hospital-superbug-mrsa.html#.VRo-zuEpqHQ|title=Anglo Saxon remedy kills hospital superbug MRSA|author=Clare Wilson|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=31 March 2015 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6542">In [[Microsoft Windows]], the '''Briefcase''' is a [[special folder]] that supports a simple two-way [[file synchronization]] between itself and another folder. The Briefcase is designed for mobile PC users so that they may transfer it to a removable drive and have it synchronize with the computer to which the removable drive is attached. It follows the same metaphor as the ''[[Computer file|file]]'' and ''[[file folder]]'' and then, while the file management tasks are performed by Windows Explorer, the briefcase behaves just like another [[Directory (file systems)|folder]], i.e. with support for copy-paste and [[drag-and-drop]]. It has additional functions and toolbar buttons for updating out-of-sync files. The Windows Briefcase was introduced in [[Windows 95]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/142574|title = How to Install and Use Briefcase|date = 19 January 2007|accessdate = |website = Support|publisher = [[Microsoft]]|last = |first = |edition = 1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was 

* [[deprecated]] (although not removed) in [[Windows 8]] and 
* completely disabled (but still present and accessible via modification of the [[Windows Registry]]) from [[Windows 10]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-restore-the-missing-briefcase-feature-in-windows-8-rtm/|title = How to restore the missing Briefcase feature in Windows 8 RTM|date = |accessdate = 20 October 2014|website = winaero.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* finally removed in Windows 10 build 14942&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Briefcase - Add to New Context Menu in Windows 10 |url = http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/24426-briefcase-add-new-context-menu-windows-10-a.html| website = tenforums.com|publisher = |accessdate = 2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Overview==
The Windows Briefcase synchronizes files and folders within itself with those in any other folder, even on a removable writable media or the network.&lt;ref name="Briefcase"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307885|title = How To Use the Briefcase Feature in Windows XP|date = 23 September 2011|accessdate = |website = Support|publisher = [[Microsoft]]|last = |first = |edition = 4.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is intended for users with portable media or multiple computers. To use the Briefcase, users only need to use Windows Explorer and then drag or copy their files into the Briefcase once. Any further changes to either the files on disk or those in the Briefcase are synchronized whenever the user right-clicks on the briefcase and selects ''Update All''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,74192,00.asp|title = Update Files in Your Briefcase Folder|date = 13 June 2001|accessdate = |website = [[PC Magazine]]|publisher = [[Ziff Davis]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there are differences between the copies, the Briefcase shows a dialog box with an icon and a description indicating the action it will take when synchronizing; that is, whether it will replace the copy in the Briefcase with the external file or vice versa. The action the Briefcase will take is configurable by right clicking the icon. For example, users can skip synchronizing individual items by selecting the ''Skip'' action upon right clicking the icon. For items deleted in either the Briefcase or the main original folder, the Briefcase can create a copy of the missing item. Users can also sync individual items in the Briefcase by selecting the item first and then clicking the ''Update'' button instead of ''Update All''.

The update status of each item is stored in the Briefcase. If any item does not link to any original item outside the briefcase, (for example when the drive containing the briefcase is inserted in a secondary computer, or the original has been deleted in the main computer) it is called an ''orphan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307885|title = How To Use the Briefcase Feature in Windows XP|date = 23 September 2011|accessdate = |website = Support|publisher = [[Microsoft]]|last = |first = |edition = 4.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internals==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}Most special folders in Windows (such as Briefcase folders) have a [[Hidden file and hidden directory|hidden file]] (with "system" [[file attribute|attribute]]) called [[Desktop.ini]].  They may also have [[Windows Registry]] entries describing them. The Desktop.ini for a Briefcase contains the following lines:
&lt;pre&gt;
[.ShellClassInfo]
CLSID={85BBD920-42A0-1069-A2E4-08002B30309D}
ConfirmFileOp=0
RunWizard=0
[Briefcase]
Database=Briefcase Database
&lt;/pre&gt;

* The '''CLSID''' setting specifies the [[CLSID|class identifier]] of the "Briefcase" class, which is required for a folder to appear as a Briefcase.
* The '''ConfirmFileOp''' setting appears to have no effect.
* The '''RunWizard''' setting specifies whether to display the "Welcome to the Windows Briefcase" dialog when the user opens the Briefcase. This setting is removed once the dialog is displayed for the first time.

A second file called "Briefcase Database", bearing  "hidden" and "system" attributes, and no [[filename extension]], serves as the Briefcase index. Its [[fourCC]] is "DDSH".

The Briefcase folder itself must have "read-only" or "system" file attributes (default is read-only) in order to display as a Briefcase. The Desktop.ini and Briefcase Database files are not required to have the hidden or system attributes in order for the parent folder to display as a Briefcase.

==Limitations==
When a user wishes to sync a file with one in another folder, the filename must be exactly the same. If any item is renamed or moved, it splits from the original, is no longer synchronized and becomes an ''orphan''. If an item is deleted, the associated copy ''by default'' is deleted as well when using ''Update All''. If the briefcase medium becomes full during an Update, there will be no space for writing the updated briefcase database. This has the effect of making many of the folders and files orphans, with no easy way to restore their link with their counterparts on the source medium. Such limitations (and others) make briefcase files very brittle, easily corrupted. This limits robustness as a folder and file backup mechanism.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

'''''Christine''''' is a 1983 American [[psychological horror]] [[film]] directed by [[John Carpenter]] and starring [[Keith Gordon]], [[John Stockwell (actor)|John Stockwell]], [[Alexandra Paul]], [[Robert Prosky]] and [[Harry Dean Stanton]]. The film also features supporting performances from [[Roberts Blossom]] and [[Kelly Preston]]. 

Written by Bill Phillips and based on [[Stephen King]]’s [[Christine (novel)|1983 novel of the same name]], the movie follows the changes in the lives of Arnie Cunningham, his friends, his family, and his teenage enemies after Arnie buys a vintage 1958 [[Plymouth Fury]] named Christine. Strange things happen and the viewers learn the car's secret: That it is possessed by a malign spirit out to even the score with anyone who does the car – or its owner – wrong.

Upon its release, the film grossed $21 million at the US box office. Despite a lukewarm reception among critics, the film has become a [[cult classic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticmass.net/cult/christine-movie-1984/|title=Christine|publisher=Static Mass Emporium|accessdate=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In September 1957, at a Chrysler Corporation [[assembly plant]] in [[Detroit]], the hood of a newly assembled, custom-painted 1958 [[Plymouth Fury]] slams down without warning and crushes the hand of a line worker inspecting its front end. Another worker climbs in to sit behind the wheel, letting the ash from his cigar fall on the front seat. At the end of the shift, the line supervisor notices the worker slumped in the seat and opens the door; the worker falls to the floor dead, a look of terror on his face. 

Twenty-one years later, in September 1978, Arnold "Arnie" Cunningham is an awkward and unpopular teenager in Rockbridge, California, with only one friend, football player Dennis Guilder. Arnie's life begins to change when he buys a used, badly battered red-and-white 1958 Plymouth Fury named "Christine" (the same car from the assembly plant), in need of extensive repairs. Since his parents will not let him keep the car at their house, Arnie begins to restore it at a do-it-yourself garage and junkyard owned by Will Darnell. As he spends more of his time working on the car, he discards his glasses, dresses more like a 1950s [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]], and develops an arrogant, paranoid personality. 

Unbeknownst to Arnie, Dennis learns of the car's dark past from the brother of its obsessive original owner: the owner's daughter choked to death in it; his wife committed suicide in it; and he eventually did the same. During a football game, Dennis becomes distracted by the sight of Arnie kissing a girl in front of Christine and is tackled, suffering a season-ending leg injury. Arnie's new girlfriend, Leigh Cabot, chokes on a hamburger while inside the car on a date with him and is saved when a passing man administers the [[Heimlich maneuver]]. Sure that Christine is jealous of her, she vows never to get into the car again and urges Arnie to get rid of it. She and Arnie break up when he refuses to even consider this.

Angry with Arnie over being expelled after a confrontation in shop class, school bully Buddy Repperton vandalizes Christine with the help of his gang. Arnie is devastated and determined to repair Christine, but is surprised to see it quickly restore itself to showroom quality as he watches. Christine drives off by itself to seek out the vandals, crushing one in an alley, triggering a gas station explosion that kills two others and sets the car on fire, and finally running down Buddy himself. After the badly burned Christine returns to Darnell's garage, Darnell climbs in to sit behind the steering wheel and is crushed to death when Christine pushes the driver's seat forward. The next morning, Christine is back in its slot and fully repaired.

State police detective Rudolph Junkins becomes suspicious of Arnie, having discovered paint from Christine at the scenes of two gang members' deaths. However, he has no direct evidence to implicate Arnie, who has an alibi. Junkins either does not know or cannot believe that Christine can drive itself.

Dennis and Leigh, drawn together by their affection for Arnie, begin a relationship of their own and decide that the only way to save Arnie is to destroy Christine. They set a trap for it at Darnell's garage; Dennis waits at the controls of a [[bulldozer]], while Leigh stands ready to close the garage doors and cut off Christine's retreat once it enters. However, Christine has been lying in wait under a pile of debris in the garage the entire time, and when Leigh takes up her position at the door controls, it strikes. Christine crashes through Darnell's office in an attempt to get at Leigh. Arnie - who has been driving the car himself - is thrown through the windshield and impaled on a shard of glass, which kills him. Dennis and Leigh attack Christine with the bulldozer, but it continually repairs itself and strikes back. The battle continues until they repeatedly drive back and forth over the car, damaging Christine so much that it is unable to immediately regenerate.

A few days later, Dennis, Leigh, and Junkins watch as Christine's remains - compacted into a cube by a [[car crusher]] - are dropped into a junkyard. The camera zooms in to a close-up of the front grille, which slowly starts to unbend.

==Production==
===Conception===
Producer Richard Kobritz had previously produced the [[miniseries]] ''[[Salem's Lot (1979 miniseries)|Salem's Lot]]'', also based on a Stephen King novel. Through producing the miniseries, Kobritz became acquainted with King, who sent him manuscripts of two of his novels, ''[[Cujo]]'', and ''[[Christine (novel)|Christine]]''.&lt;ref name="ignition"&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Carpenter, John; Kobritz, Richard|title=Christine: Ignition|year=2004|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kobritz purchased the rights to ''Christine'' after finding himself attracted to the novel's "celebration of America's obsession with the motorcar."&lt;ref name="ignition"/&gt;

According to John Carpenter, ''Christine'' was not a film he had planned on directing, saying that he directed the film as "a job" as opposed to a "personal project."&lt;ref name="sf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/j_nada/carp/interview/sfx.html|work=SFX|title=Extracts from SFX Interview with John Carpenter|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously directed ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982), which had done poorly at the box office and led to critical backlash.&lt;ref name="ignition"/&gt; In retrospect, Carpenter stated that upon reading ''Christine'', he felt that "It just wasn't very frightening. But it was something I needed to do at that time for my career."&lt;ref name="sf"/&gt;

King's novel, the source material for Carpenter's film, made it clear that the car was possessed by the evil spirit of its previous owner, Roland D. LeBay, whereas the film version of the story shows that the evil spirit of the car manifested itself on the day it was built.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, John. Audio commentary, ''Christine'' [Blu-ray]. [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Other elements from the novel were altered for the film, particularly the execution of the death scenes, which the filmmakers opted for a more "cinematic approach."&lt;ref name="fast"/&gt;

===Casting===
Initially, Columbia Pictures had wanted to cast [[Brooke Shields]] in the role of Leigh due to her publicity after the release of ''[[The Blue Lagoon (1980 film)|The Blue Lagoon]]'' (1980), and [[Scott Baio]] as Arnie.&lt;ref name="ignition"/&gt; The filmmakers declined the suggestion, opting to cast young actors who were still fairly unknown. [[Kevin Bacon]] auditioned for the role, but opted out when offered a part in ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'' (1984).&lt;ref name="ignition"/&gt; Carpenter cast Keith Gordon in the role of Arnie after an audition in New York City; Gordon had some experience in film, and was also working in theater at the time; John Stockwell was cast at an audition in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="ignition"/&gt;

Nineteen-year-old Alexandra Paul was cast in the film after audition in New York City; according to Carpenter, Paul was an "untrained, young actress" at the time, but brought a "great quality" about the character of Leigh.&lt;ref name="ignition"/&gt; According to Paul, she had not read any of King's books or seen Carpenter's films, and read the novel in preparation.&lt;ref name="ignition"/&gt;

===Filming===
''Christine'' was shot largely in [[Los Angeles, California]], while the location for Darnell's garage was located in [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]].&lt;ref name="fast"&gt;{{Cite AV media|title=Christine: Fast and Furious|year=2004|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|people=Carpenter, John; Gordon, Keith; Paul, Alexandra; Stockwell, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming began in April 1983, merely days after the King novel had been published.{{Sfn|Von Doviak|2014}} The film's stunts were primarily completed by stunt coordinator Terry Leonard, who was behind the wheel of the car during the high-speed chase scenes, as well as the scene in which the car drives down a highway engulfed in flames.&lt;ref name="fast"/&gt;

===The car===
[[File:Christine.jpg|right|thumb|One of the two remaining models of Christine used in the film]]Although the car in the film is identified as a 1958 Plymouth Fury{{Sfn|Kerr|Wollen|2004|p=355}}—and in 1983 radio ads promoting the film, voiceover artists announced, "she's a '57 Fury"—two other Plymouth models, the [[Plymouth Belvedere|Belvedere]] and the [[Plymouth Savoy|Savoy]], were also used to portray the malevolent automobile onscreen. John Carpenter placed ads throughout Southern California searching for models of the car, and was able to purchase twenty-four of them in various states of disrepair, which were used to build a total of seventeen copies of the film car.{{sfn|Von Doviak|2014}}  All cars were two door hardtops.

Total production for the 1958 Plymouth Fury was only 5,303, and they were difficult to find and expensive to buy at the time. In addition, the real-life Furys only came in one color, "Buckskin Beige", seen on the other Furys on the assembly line during the initial scenes of the movie.{{Sfn|Benjaminson|1994|p=124}}  The Fury also got anodized gold trim on the body and Fury script on the rear fender.  In order to bypass the problem of obtaining the rare trim, the cars featured the more common Belvedere "Dartline" trim.  Several vehicles were destroyed during filming, but most of the cars were Savoy and Belvedere models dressed to look like the Fury.  At least one '57 Savoy was used, its front end modified to look like a '58.

Originally, Carpenter had not planned to film the car's regeneration scenes, but decided after the shoot had finished to include them. The shots of the car regenerating itself were shot in [[post-production]] and done using [[hydraulic]]s.&lt;ref name="fast"/&gt;

Of the twenty cars used in the film, only two still exist. One is a stunt vehicle with a manual transmission and now resides in the hands of a private California collector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYDfCYt-oLA], Christopher Rutkowski, theAFICIONAUTO, autoblog, Living Christine&lt;/ref&gt; The other vehicle was rescued from a junkyard and restored by collector Bill Gibson of [[Pensacola, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weartv.com/newsroom/top_stories/videos/wear_30th-anniversary-stephen-kings-chistine-29234.shtml |title=30th Anniversary of Stephen King's "Christine" |work=WEAR-TV |date=February 16, 2013 |accessdate=November 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313010455/http://www.weartv.com/newsroom/top_stories/videos/wear_30th-anniversary-stephen-kings-chistine-29234.shtml |archivedate=March 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
===Box office===
''Christine'' was released in North America on December 9, 1983, to 1,045 theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=christine.htm|work=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=November 28, 2015|title=Christine (1983)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its opening weekend ''Christine'' brought in $3,408,904 landing at #4. The film dropped 39.6% in its second weekend, grossing $2,058,517 slipping from fourth to eighth place. In its third weekend, it grossed $1,851,909 dropping to #9. The film remained at #9 its fourth weekend, grossing $2,736,782. In its fifth weekend, it returned to #8, grossing $2,015,922. Bringing in $1,316,835 in its sixth weekend, the film dropped out of the box office top ten to twelfth place. In its seventh and final weekend, the film brought in $819,972 landing at #14, bringing the total gross for ''Christine'' to $21,017,849.&lt;ref name="overall"/&gt;

===Critical reception===
Based on 25 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Christine'' has an overall 68% approval rating from critics with the consensus saying: "The cracks are starting to show in John Carpenter's directorial instincts, but Christine is nonetheless silly, zippy fun." and an average score of 5.9 out of 10.&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/christine/|title=''Christine'' Movie Reviews|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=IGN Entertainment|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a negative review, stating: "''Christine'' seems like a retread. This time it’s a fire-engine red, 1958 Plymouth Fury that’s possessed by the Devil, and this deja-vu premise [from the novel by Stephen King] combined with the crazed-vehicle format, makes Christine appear pretty shop worn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1982/film/reviews/christine-1200425568/|work=Variety|date=December 31, 1982|accessdate=November 28, 2015|author=Variety Staff|title=Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the movie three out of four stars, saying: "by the end of the movie, Christine has developed such a formidable personality that we are actually taking sides during its duel with a bulldozer. This is the kind of movie where you walk out with a silly grin, get in your car, and lay rubber halfway down the [[Eisenhower Expressway|Eisenhower]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/christine-1983|work=Chicago Sun-Time|title=Christine|date=December 13, 1983|accessdate=November 27, 2015|author=Ebert, Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the film a middling review, saying: "The early parts of the film are engaging and well acted, creating a believable high-school atmosphere.

'''Cellules Communistes Combattantes''' ('''CCC'''; Communist Combatant Cells, also known as Fighting Communist Cells) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[terrorism|terrorist]] [[organisation|organization]] committed to a [[Communism|Communist ideology]]. 

The cells were active for less than two years in the mid-1980s; primarily engaged in [[bomb attack|bombings]] within Belgium's borders. CCC attacked perceived enemies of [[communism]], specifically [[NATO]], [[United States|US]] and other international businesses and the [[Federation of Belgian Enterprises]]. The Cellules Communistes Combattantes primarily targeted [[property]] rather than human representatives of [[capitalism]], [[NATO]], etc., and warned authorities ahead of an attack. Nevertheless, CCC bombings led to several injuries and two deaths. 

The CCC's spate of bombings in 1985, as well as the unrelated [[Brabant killers|Brabant killings]] at the time, shook this otherwise relatively tranquil country and created widespread security concerns. The government decided to deploy about 1,000 soldiers from the Belgian army as part of PM [[Wilfried Martens]]' security plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/24/world/belgium-is-shaken-by-bombs-and-crazy-killers.html|title=BELGIUM IS SHAKEN BY BOMBS AND 'CRAZY KILLERS'|first=Judith Miller and Special To the New York|last=Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1985, [[Law enforcement in Belgium|police]] arrested CCC leader and founder [[Pierre Carette]] and others, in an American-styled burger restaurant. Carette's conviction on 14 January 1986 essentially eliminated the CCC.

Pierre Carette was released from prison in February 2003. In 2008, [[Pierre Carette]] and Bertrand Sassoye were arrested again on parole violations and connections to the Italian terrorist group ''[[Political-Military Communist Party|Partito Comunista Politico-Militare]]'', but they were released by the court a few days later, on 18 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last =| first =| author-link =| last2 =| first2 =| author2-link =| title =CCC: 5 interpellations en Belgique| date =2008-06-05| url =http://www.rtbf.be/info/societe/judiciaire/ccc-5-interpellations-en-belgique| accessdate =2008-06-08| language =fr| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080609023641/http://www.rtbf.be/info/societe/judiciaire/ccc-5-interpellations-en-belgique| archivedate =2008-06-09| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.lesoir.be/justice-l-ex-chef-des-ccc-qui-a-respecte-sa_t-20080619-00GKQR.html|title=L’ex-chef des CCC, qui a respecté sa libération conditionnelle, est libre|last=Metdepenningen|first=Marc|date=June 19, 2008|work=[[Le Soir]]|accessdate=11 July 2011|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Application virtualization software''' refers to both application [[virtual machine]]s and software responsible for implementing them. Application virtual machines are typically used to allow application [[bytecode]] to run portably on many different computer architectures and operating systems. The application is usually run on the computer using an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] or [[just-in-time compilation]] (JIT). There are often several implementations of a given virtual machine, each covering a different set of functions.

==Comparison of virtual machines==
:[[Javascript]] machines not included. See [[List of ECMAScript engines]] to find them.

The table here summarizes elements for which the virtual machine designs are intended to be efficient, not the list of abilities present in any implementation.

Virtual machine instructions process data in local variables using a main ''[[model of computation]]'', typically that of a [[stack machine]], [[register machine]], or [[random access machine]] often called the memory machine. Use of these three methods is motivated by different tradeoffs in virtual machines vs physical machines, such as ease of interpreting, compiling, and verifying for security.

''[[Memory management]]'' in these portable virtual machines is addressed at a higher level of abstraction than in physical machines. Some virtual machines, such as the popular [[Java virtual machine]]s (JVM), are involved with addresses in such a way as to require safe automatic memory management by allowing the virtual machine to trace pointer references, and disallow machine instructions from manually constructing pointers to memory. Other virtual machines, such as LLVM, are more like traditional physical machines, allowing direct use and manipulation of pointers. [[Common Intermediate Language]] (CIL) offers a hybrid in between, allowing both controlled use of memory (like the JVM, which allows safe automatic memory management), while also allowing an 'unsafe' mode that allows direct pointer manipulation in ways that can violate type boundaries and permission.

''Code security'' generally refers to the ability of the portable virtual machine to run code while offering it only a prescribed set of abilities. For example, the virtual machine might only allow the code access to a certain set of functions or data. The same controls over pointers which make automatic memory management possible and allow the virtual machine to ensure typesafe data access are used to assure that a code fragment is only allowed to certain elements of memory and cannot bypass the virtual machine itself. Other security mechanisms are then layered on top as code verifiers, stack verifiers, and other methods.

An ''[[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]'' allows programs made of virtual instructions to be loaded and run immediately without a potentially costly compile into native machine instructions. Any virtual machine which can be run can be interpreted, so the column designation here refers to whether the design includes provisions for efficient interpreting (for common usage).

''[[Just-in-time compilation]]'' (JIT), refers to a method of compiling to native instructions at the latest possible time, usually immediately before or during the running of the program. The challenge of JIT is more one of implementation than of virtual machine design, however, modern designs have begun to make considerations to help efficiency. The simplest JIT methods simply compile to a code fragment similar to an offline compiler. However, more complex methods are often employed, which specialize compiled code fragments to parameters known only at runtime (see [[Adaptive optimization]]).

''[[Ahead-of-time compilation]]'' (AOT) refers to the more classic method of using a precompiler to generate a set of native instructions which do not change during the runtime of the program. Because aggressive compiling and optimizing can take time, a precompiled program may launch faster than one which relies on JIT alone for execution. JVM implementations have mitigated this startup cost by initial interpreting to speed launch times, until native code fragments can be generated by JIT.

''[[Shared library|Shared libraries]]'' are a facility to reuse segments of native code across multiple running programs. In modern operating systems, this generally means using [[virtual memory]] to share the memory pages containing a shared library across different processes which are protected from each other via [[memory protection]]. It is interesting that aggressive JIT methods such as adaptive optimization often produce code fragments unsuitable for sharing across processes or successive runs of the program, requiring a tradeoff be made between the efficiencies of precompiled and shared code and the advantages of adaptively specialized code. For example, several design provisions of CIL are present to allow for efficient shared libraries, possibly at the cost of more specialized JIT code. The JVM implementation on [[OS X]] uses a Java Shared Archive&lt;ref&gt;[https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Java/Conceptual/Java14Development/00-Intro/JavaDevelopment.html Apple docs on OS X use of Java Shared Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; to provide some of the benefits of shared libraries.

==Comparison of application virtual machine implementations==

In addition to the portable virtual machines described above, virtual machines are often used as an execution model for individual scripting languages, usually by an interpreter. This table lists specific virtual machine implementations, both of the above portable virtual machines, and of scripting language virtual machines.

=== Background execution ===
[[Background execution]] allows a shell to run a command in background. POSIX shells and other Unix shells allow background execution by using the ''&amp;'' character and the end of command, and in [[PowerShell]] you can use &lt;code&gt;Start-Process&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Start-Job&lt;/code&gt; commands.

=== Completions ===
{{main article|Command-line completion}}

[[Image:Command-line-completion-example.gif|right|thumb|402px|Command-line completion in [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]].]]Completion features assist the user in typing commands at the command line, by looking for and suggesting matching words for incomplete ones. Completion is generally requested by pressing the completion key (often the {{keypress|TAB}} key).

''Command name completion'' is the completion of the name of a command. In most shells, a command can be a program in the command path (usually &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;), a builtin command, a function or alias.

''Path completion'' is the completion of the path to a file, relative or absolute.

''Wildcard completion'' is a generalization of path completion, where an expression matches any number of files, using any supported syntax for [[#String processing and filename matching|file matching]].

''Variable completion'' is the completion of the name of a variable name ([[environment variable]] or shell variable).
Bash, zsh, and fish have completion for all variable names. PowerShell has completions for [[environment variable]] names, shell variable names and — from within user-defined functions — parameter names.

''Command argument completion'' is the completion of a specific command's arguments. There are two types of arguments, [[Named parameter|named]] and positional: Named arguments, often called ''options'', are identified by their name or letter preceding a value, whereas positional arguments consist only of the value. Some shells allow completion of argument names, but few support completing values.

Bash, zsh and fish offer parameter name completion through a definition external to the command, distributed in a separate completion definition file. For command parameter name/value completions, these shells assume path/filename completion if no completion is defined for the command. Completion can be set up to suggest completions by calling a shell function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Completion-System.html |title=zsh: 20. Completion System |publisher=Zsh.sourceforge.net |date=2013-03-06 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fish shell additionally supports parsing of [[man page]]s to extract parameter information that can be used to improve completions/suggestions. In PowerShell, all types of commands (cmdlets, functions, script files) inherently expose data about the names, types and valid value ranges/lists for each argument. This metadata is used by PowerShell to automatically support argument name and value completion for built-in commands/functions, user-defined commands/functions as well as for script files. Individual cmdlets can also define dynamic completion of argument values where the completion values are computed dynamically on the running system.

=== Command history ===
{{main article|Command history}}
A user of a shell may find that he/she is typing something similar to what the user typed before. If the shell supports ''command history'' the user can call
the previous command into the line editor and edit it before issuing it again.

Shells that support completion may also be able to directly complete the command from the command history given a partial/initial part of the previous command.

Most modern shells support command history. Shells which support command history in general also supports completion from history rather than just recalling
commands from the history. In addition to the plain command text, PowerShell also records execution start- and end time and execution status in the command history.

=== Mandatory argument prompt ===
{{further|Named parameter#Optional_parameters}}
Mandatory arguments/parameters are arguments/parameters which must be assigned a value upon invocation the command, function or script file. A shell that can determine ahead
of invocation that there are missing mandatory values, can assist the interactive user by prompting for those values instead of letting the command fail.
Having the shell prompt for missing values will allow the author of a script, command or function to mark a parameter as mandatory instead of creating script code to either
prompt for the missing values (after determining that it is being run interactively) or fail with a message.

PowerShell allows commands, functions and scripts to define arguments/parameters as ''mandatory''. The shell determines prior to invocation if there is any
mandatory arguments/parameters which have not been bound, and will then prompt the user for the value(s) before actual invocation.
&lt;ref name="ps-mandatoryparameter"&gt;{{cite web |title=Use PowerShell to Make Mandatory Parameters |url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2011/05/22/use-powershell-to-make-mandatory-parameters.aspx |publisher=Blogs.technet.com |access-date=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Automatic suggestions ===
{{main article|Autocomplete}}
[[Image:Powershell Intellisense example for the Get-Process cmdlet.gif|right|thumb|550px|Command-line completion in [[PowerShell]].]]With automatic suggestions the shell monitors while the interactive user is typing and displays context-relevant suggestions without interrupting the typing instead of the user [[#Command, parameter and -value completion|explicitly requesting completion]].

The PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment use the discoverable metadata to provide "intellisense" - i.e. suggestions that automatically pops up as the user types, in addition to when the user explicitly requests completion lists by pressing e.g. {{keypress|tab}}
{{further|Intellisense}}

=== Directory history, stack or similar features ===

A shell may record the locations the user has used as current locations and allow fast switching to any location/directory in the history.

One of the uses of the zsh directory stack is to record a directory history. In particular, the &lt;tt&gt;AUTO_PUSHD&lt;/tt&gt; option and advanced &lt;tt&gt;cd&lt;/tt&gt; arguments and completion are used for this purpose.

PowerShell allows multiple named stacks to be used. Locations (directories) can be pushed onto/popped from the current stack or a named stack. Any stack can become the current (default) stack. Unlike most other shells, PowerShell's ''location'' concept allow location stacks to hold file system locations as well as other location types like e.g. [[Active Directory]] organizational units/groups, [[Database server|SQL Server]] databases/tables/objects, [[Internet Information Server]] applications/sites/virtual directories.

4DOS and Take Command Console record history of current directories and allows the user to switch to a directory in the history using a popup a window.

=== Implicit directory change ===
A directory name can be used directly as a command which implicitly changes the current location to the directory.

=== Autocorrection ===
When a command line does not match a command or arguments directly, spell checking can automatically correct common typing mistakes (such as [[case sensitivity]], missing letters). There are two approaches to this; the shell can either suggest probable corrections upon command invocation, or this can happen earlier as part of a completion or autosuggestion.

The [[tcsh]] and [[zsh]] shells feature optional spell checking/correction, upon command invocation.

Fish does the autocorrection upon completion and autosuggestion. The feature is therefore not in the way when typing out the whole command and pressing enter, whereas extensive use of the tab and right-arrow keys makes the shell mostly case insensitive.

The PSReadLine&lt;ref name="PSReadLine" /&gt; PowerShell module (which is shipped with version 5.0) provides the option to specify a CommandValidationHandler ScriptBlock which runs before submitting the command. This allows for custom correcting of commonly mistyped commands, and verification before actually running the command.

=== Integrated environment ===
{{main article|Integrated development environment}}
{{see also|Integrated applications environment|File manager}}

An integrated environment is the integration of the command-line interface with editors (typically multiple documents), [[online help|help system]] and possibly [[debugger|debugging]] and other tools.

[[Take Command Console]] (TCC) comes with an integrated environment with command line pane, file explorer, editor, batch debugger and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jpsoft.com/take-command-windows-scripting.html |title=#1 Windows Command Line Replacement - Windows CMD Command Prompt Commands |publisher=[[JP Software]] |access-date=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Windows PowerShell|PowerShell ISE]] includes a command line pane with support for integrated command line, copy-paste, multiple document editors, [[source-level debugging]], help pane, command explorer pane and scripting interface allowing scripts/modules to manipulate menus, add-ons etc. The ISE (menus, windows, shortcuts, addons) are customizable through scripts.&lt;ref name="technet.microsoft.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849182.aspx |title=Windows PowerShell 3.0 Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) |publisher=Technet.microsoft.com |access-date=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Snippets ===
{{main article|Snippet (programming)}}

Snippets are small regions of reusable script code. Snippets are often used to save keystrokes, or to assist the user with common scripting patterns. Many text editors support snippets for scripting either as built-in functionality or through plugins.

PowerShell supports snippets in the Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) using {{keypress|Ctrl|J}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powershellmagazine.com/2011/09/28/powershell-v3-ise-and-ise-scripting-model-changes-improvements/ |title=PowerShell v3 ISE and ISE scripting model changes &amp; improvements |publisher=PowerShell Magazine |date=2011-09-28 |access-date=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Value prompt ===
A shell script can prompt the interactive user for a value.

=== Menu/options selector ===
A shell script can present the interactive user with a list of choices.

=== Progress indicator ===
A shell script (or job) can report progress of long running tasks to the interactive user.

Unix/Linux systems may offer other tools support using progress indicators from scripts or as standalone-commands, such as the program "pv".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linux.die.net/man/1/pv |title=pv(1): monitor progress of data through pipe - Linux man page |publisher=Linux.die.net |access-date=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are not integrated features of the shells, however.

PowerShell has a built-in command and API functions (to be used when authoring commands) for writing/updating a progress bar. Progress bar messages are sent separates from regular command output
and the progress bar is always displayed at the ultimate interactive users console regardless of whether the progress messages originates from an interactive script, from a background job or from a remote session.

=== Interactive table ===
Output from a command execution can be displayed in a table/grid which can be interactively sorted and filtered and/or otherwise manipulated after command execution ends.

PowerShell &lt;tt&gt;Out-GridView&lt;/tt&gt; cmdlet displays data in an interactive window with interactive sorting and filtering.

=== Syntax highlighting ===
{{main article|Syntax highlighting}}
An independent project offers syntax highlighting as an add-on to the Z Shell (zsh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting |title=zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting: Fish shell like syntax highlighting for Zsh |website=GitHub |access-date=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not part of the shell, however.

PowerShell provides customizable syntax highlighting on the command line through the PSReadLine&lt;ref name="PSReadLine" /&gt; module. This module can be used with PowerShell v3.0+, and it's included with v5.0. Additionally, it is loaded by default in the command line host "powershell.exe" in v5.0. The PowerShell ISE also includes syntax highlighting on the command line as well as in the script pane.&lt;ref name="technet.microsoft.com"/&gt;
Take Command Console (TCC) offers syntax highlighting in the integrated environment.

===Context sensitive help===
{{main article|Context-sensitive help}}

4DOS, 4OS2, 4NT / Take Command Console and PowerShell (in PowerShell ISE) looks up context-sensitive help information when {{keypress|F1}} is pressed.

Zsh provides various forms of configurable context-sensitive help as part of its &lt;tt&gt;run-help&lt;/tt&gt; widget, &lt;tt&gt;_complete_help&lt;/tt&gt; command, or in the completion of options for some commands.

===Command builder===
A command builder is a guided dialog which assists the user in filling in a command. PowerShell has a command builder which is available in PowerShell ISE or which can be displayed separately through the &lt;tt&gt;Show-Command&lt;/tt&gt; cmdlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849915.aspx |title=Show-Command |publisher=Technet.microsoft.com |access-date=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keystroke stacking===
In anticipation of what a given running application may accept as keyboard input, the user of the shell instructs the shell to generate a sequence of ''simulated'' keystrokes, which the application will interpret as an keyboard input from an interactive user. By sending keystroke sequences the user may be able to direct the application to perform actions that would be impossible to achieve through input redirection or would otherwise require an interactive user. For example, if an application acts on keystrokes, which cannot be redirected, distinguishes between normal and extended keys, flushes the queue before accepting new input on startup or under certain conditions, or because it does not read through standard input at all. Keystroke stacking typically also provides means to control the timing of simulated keys being sent or to delay new keys until the queue was flushed etc. It also allows to simulate keys which are not present on a keyboard (because the corresponding keys do not physically exist or because a different keyboard layout is being used) and therefore would be impossible to type by a user.

=== Secure prompt ===
Some shell scripts need to query the user for sensitive information such as [[password]]s, private digital keys, [[Personal Identification Number|PIN codes]] or other confidential information. Sensitive input should not be echoed back to the screen/input device where it could be gleaned by unauthorized persons. Plaintext memory representation of sensitive information should also be avoided as it could allow the information to be compromised, e.g., through swap files, core dumps etc.&lt;ref name="encryptmemory"&gt;{{cite web |author-last=Provos |author-first=Niels |title=Encrypting Virtual Memory |url=http://www.openbsd.org/papers/swapencrypt.ps |publisher=Center for Information Technology Integration, University of Michigan |access-date=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shells bash, zsh and PowerShell offer this as a specific feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Builtins.html |title=bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell |quote=read -s Silent mode. If input is coming from a terminal, characters are not echoed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176935.aspx |title=Using the Read-Host Cmdlet |quote=By adding the -assecurestring parameter you can mask the data entered at the prompt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shells which do not offer this as a specific feature may still be able to turn off echoing through some other means. Shells executing on a Unix/Linux operating system can use the &lt;tt&gt;stty&lt;/tt&gt; external command to switch off/on echoing of input characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Linux / Unix Command: stty |url=http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl1_stty.htm |publisher=Linux.about.com |access-date=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to not echoing back the characters, PowerShell's &lt;tt&gt;-AsSecureString&lt;/tt&gt; option also encrypts the input character-by-character during the input process, ensuring that the string is never represented unencrypted in memory where it could be compromised through memory dumps, scanning, transcription etc.

=== Encrypted variables/parameters ===
If a script reads a password into an environment variable it is in memory in plain text, and thus may be accessed via a core dump. It is also in the process environment, which may be accessible by other processes started by the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Albing |author-first1=Carl |title=Bash cookbook |year=2007 |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] |location=Sebastopol, California |isbn=978-0-596-52678-8 |edition=1st |author-last2=Vossen |author-first2=J. P. |author-last3=Newham |author-first3=Cameron |page=65 |chapter=3.8. Prompting for a Password |quote=Be aware that if you read a password into an environment variable it is in memory in plain text, and thus may be accessed via a core dump or /proc/core. It is also in the process environment, which may be accessible by other processes.}}&lt;!--|access-date=2012-12-19--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

PowerShell can work with encrypted string variables/parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-last=Holmes |author-first=Lee |title=SecureStrings in PowerShell |url=http://www.leeholmes.com/blog/2006/06/01/securestrings-in-powershell/ |access-date=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Encrypted variables ensure that values are not inadvertently disclosed through e.g. transcripts, echo'ing, logfiles, memory or crash dumps or even malicious memory scanning. PowerShell also supports saving of such encrypted strings in text files, protected by a key owned by the current user.

=== Execute permission ===
Some operating systems define an ''execute'' permission which can be granted to users/groups for a file.

On Unix systems, the execute permission controls access to invoking the file as a program, and applies both to executables and scripts.
As the permission is enforced in the [[Loader (computing)|program loader]], no obligation is needed from the invoking program, nor the invoked program, in enforcing the execute permission{{Snd}} this also goes for shells and other interpreter programs.
The behaviour is mandated by the [[C POSIX library|POSIX C library]] that is used for interfacing with the kernel. POSIX specifies that the &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; family of functions shall fail with EACCESS (permission denied) if the file denies execution permission (see {{man|sh|execve|SUS}}).

The ''execute'' permission only applies when the script is run directly. If a script is invoked as an argument to the interpreting shell, it will be executed regardless of whether the user holds the ''execute'' permission for that script.

Although Windows also specifies an ''execute'' permission, none of the Windows-specific shells block script execution if the permission has not been granted.

=== Untrusted script blocking ===
Some shells will block scripts determined to be untrustworthy, or refuse to run scripts if mandated by a system administrator.

==== Script origin execution restriction ====
PowerShell can be set to block execution of scripts which has been marked as obtained from an unknown/untrusted origin (e.g. the Internet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/PowerShell-Security.html |title=PowerShell Security :: Windows OS Security :: Articles &amp; Tutorials |publisher=WindowSecurity.com |access-date=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet facing applications such as web browsers, IM clients, mail readers etc. mark files downloaded from the internet with the origin zone in an alternate data stream which is understood by PowerShell.

==== Signed script restriction ====
Script/code signing policies can be used to ensure that an operations department only run approved scripts/code which have been reviewed and signed by a trusted reviewer/approver. Signing regimes also protects against tampering. If a script is sent from vendor to a client, the client can use signing to ensure that the script has not been tampered with during transit and that the script indeed originates from the vendor and not an attacker trying to social engineer an operator into running an attack script.

PowerShell can be set to allow execution of otherwise blocked scripts (e.g. originating from an untrusted zone) if the script has been digitally signed using a trusted digital certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SigningPowerShellScripts.aspx |title=Signing PowerShell Scripts |publisher=Hanselman.com |access-date=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2010/06/17/hey-scripting-guy-how-can-i-sign-windows-powershell-scripts-with-an-enterprise-windows-pki-part-2-of-2.aspx |title=Hey, Scripting Guy! How Can I Sign Windows PowerShell Scripts with an Enterprise Windows PKI? (Part 2 of 2) - Hey, Scripting Guy! Blog - Site Home - TechNet Blogs |publisher=Blogs.technet.com |access-date=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176949.aspx |title=Running Windows PowerShell Scripts |publisher=Technet.microsoft.com |access-date=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Multilevel execution policies ====
A company may want to enforce execution restriction globally within the company and/or certain parts of the company. It may want to set a policy for running signed scripts but allow certain parts of the company to set their own policies for zoned restrictions.

PowerShell allows script blocking policies to be enforced at multiple levels: Local machine, current user etc. A higher level policy overrides a lower level policy, e.g. if a policy is defined for the local machine it is in place for all users of the local machine, only if it is left ''undefined'' at the higher level can it be defined for the lower levels.

=== Restricted shell subset ===
Several shells can be started or be configured to start in a mode where only a limited set of commands and actions is available to the user. While not a security ''boundary'' (the command accessing a resource is blocked rather than the resource) this is nevertheless typically used to restrict users' actions before logging in.

A restricted mode is part of the [[POSIX]] specification for shells, and most of the Linux/Unix shells support such a mode where several of the built-in commands are disabled and only external commands from a certain directory can be invoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pwet.fr/man/linux/commandes/posix/sh |title=man sh - shell, the standard command language interpreter / posix |language=French |publisher=Pwet.fr |access-date=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Restricted-Shell.html |title=Bash Reference Manual: The Restricted Shell |publisher=Gnu.org |date=2010-12-28 |access-date=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PowerShell supports restricted modes through ''session configuration files'' or session configurations. A session configuration file can define visible (available) cmdlets, aliases, functions, path providers and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849712.aspx |title=New-PSSessionConfigurationFile |publisher=Technet.microsoft.com |access-date=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safe data subset ===
Scripts that invoke other scripts can be a security risk as they can potentially execute foreign code in the context of the user who launched the initial script. Scripts will usually be designed to exclusively include scripts from known safe locations; but in some instances, e.g. when offering the user a way to configure the environment or loading localized messages, the script may need to include other scripts/files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Albing |author-first1=Carl |title=Bash cookbook |year=2007 |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] |location=Sebastopol, California, USA |isbn=978-0-596-52678-8 |edition=1st |author-last2=Vossen |author-first2=J. P. |author-last3=Newham |author-first3=Cameron |quote=[…] is hardly what one thinks of as a passive list of configured variables. It can run other commands (e.g., cat) and use if statements to vary its choices. It even ends by echoing a message. Be careful when you source something, as it's a wide open door into your script.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way to address this risk is for the shell to offer a safe subset of commands which can be executed by an included script.

PowerShell [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848302.aspx data sections] can contain constants and expressions using a restricted subset of operators and commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Data Sections |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848302.aspx |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |access-date=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; PowerShell data sections are used when e.g. localized strings needs to be read from an external source while protecting against unwanted side effects.

== Optical media ability ==
Information about what kinds of [[optical disc]]s the players can play. Footnotes lead to information about abilities of future versions of the players or plugins that provide such abilities.
Playback of [[Super Audio CD]] is not possible for any media player, because no suitable hardware exists.
All media players capable of [[Compact Disc|audio CD]] playback will also play the [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Redbook]] core of any [[High Definition Compatible Digital|HDCD]] disc, providing no sound-quality benefits over standard audio CDs.

The '''''Einsatzgruppen'' Operational Situation Reports''' ('''OSR'''s), or '''ERM''' for the {{lang-de|Die Ereignismeldung UdSSR}} (plural: ''Ereignismeldungen''), were dispatches of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] death squads (''[[Einsatzgruppen]]''), which documented the progress of [[the Holocaust]] behind [[German-Soviet Frontier Treaty|the German-Soviet frontier]] in the course of [[Operation Barbarossa]], during World War&amp;nbsp;II. The extant reports were sent between June 1941 and April 1942 to the Chief of the Security Police and the SD ({{lang-de|Chef des Sicherheitspolizei und SD}}) in Berlin, from the occupied eastern territories including modern-day Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Moldova, and the Baltic Countries. During the [[Nuremberg War Crimes Trials]] the originals were grouped according to year and month and catalogued using a consecutive numbering system, as listed in the below table. The original photostats are held at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives in Washington D.C.]].&lt;ref name=heart&gt;{{cite web |work=Einsatzgruppen Operational Situation Reports |title=Index |publisher=HolocaustResearchProject.org |author=Holocaust Education &amp; Archive Research Team |url=http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/einsatz/situationreport.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yitzhak Arad]], with Shmuel Krakowski and Shmuel Spector (1989), ''[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/17296729?selectedversion=NBD6701728 The Einsatzgruppen reports: selections from the dispatches of the Nazi Death Squads’ campaign against the Jews July 1941-January 1943]'', New York, N.Y.: Holocaust Library. Edition details.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
{{Main|Einsatzgruppen}}
Following the onset of Operation Barbarossa, during the first 5 weeks of their shooting actions, the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' squads targeted primarily male Jews. This changed on July 29, 1941, when [[Reinhard Heydrich]] himself, quoted at an SS meeting in [[Vileyka]] (Polish [[Wilno Voivodeship (1926–1939)|Wilejka]]), criticized their leaders for the low execution figures. It was therefore ordered that the Jewish women and children be included in all subsequent shooting operations. The first women and children were killed along with the men on July 30, 1941, in Vileyka.&lt;ref name="Kay"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Making of an SS Killer |first=Alex J. |last=Kay |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2016 |pages=57, 72 |ISBN=1107146348 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=r0jGCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi ''Einsatzgruppen'' were not the only formation tasked with the mass killings. Other formations included the [[Ordnungspolizei#Police Battalions|Order Police battalions]] from Germany (Orpo) participating equally in the mass murder of Polish and Soviet Jews regardless of their age and sex,{{sfnp|Browning|2004|p=232}} including in the territories of the formerly [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet-occupied Poland]] (see the [[Białystok Ghetto#Operation Barbarossa|Red Friday massacre]]), the Baltic states, and in the USSR proper.{{sfnp|Browning|1998|p=11|ps=: On the eve of Operation Barbarossa Major Weiss disclosed to his men the directives of Hitler's [http://www.mrclancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Barbarossa-Decree.pdf 'Barbarossa Decree'.]}} Significant numbers of women and children were murdered behind all front lines not only by the Germans but also by the local [[Ukrainian Auxiliary Police|Ukrainian]] and [[Lithuanian Auxiliary Police Battalions|Lithuanian auxiliary forces]].{{sfnp|Browning|2004|p=261}} The largest [[mass shooting]] of Soviet Jews took place on September 29, 1941, in the ravine of [[Babi Yar]] near Kiev, where 33,771 Jews of all ages were machine-gunned (Situation Report No. 101).{{sfnp|Laqueur|Baumel|2001|p=51}}

==Original German cables==
After World War II, the reports were grouped and numbered by the Allies in order to summarize their content. The actual German cables were sent in their own differing sequence including by the ''Einsatzgruppe'' A (EG–A) attached to [[Army Group North]], ''Einsatzgruppe'' B (EG–B) attached to [[Army Group Center]], ''Einsatzgruppe'' C (EG-C) attached to the [[Army Group South]], and ''Einsatzgruppe'' D (EG–D) attached to the [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|11th Army]].{{r|Arad-126}} In the OSRs, individual ''Ereignismeldungen UdSSR'' (morning reports) [[abbr.]] EM, from EG–A appear in 103 different places. The reports from EG–B appear in 64 OCRs (as arranged by the Allies). The EG-C reports are listed in 77 different OCRs, and the reports from EG–D (with the least representation at source) are featured in 63 OCRs. Occasionally, large gaps appear between individual reports, caused by the lack of time or other complications including broken telephone lines in the East.{{r|tables}} Notably, in Operational Situation Report number 19, Einsatzgruppe C was changed to Einsatzgruppe B and vice versa, thus confusing further reports of their shooting actions.&lt;ref name="Arad-126"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=DqAb5tY4Ai8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Einsatzgruppe%20A%22%20Gumbinnen&amp;f=false | title=The Holocaust in the Soviet Union | publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]] | work=Google Book | date=2009 | accessdate=25 March 2015 | author=Yitzhak Arad | pages=126 | ISBN=080322270X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The OSRs are far from being equal. Some of them, such as OSR 156, include translated cables from several cities and weeks of shooting actions not yet concluded with tens of thousands of victims mentioned;&lt;ref name="EG156"&gt;{{cite web |title=Einsatzgruppen Operational Situation Reports #156 |publisher=HolocaustResearchProject.org |url=http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/einsatz/situationreport156.html |author=H.E.A.R.T  |year=2008 |translator=Hermann Feuer}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other Operational Situation Reports, such as OSR 67, resemble long essays describing mere investigations into partisan activities in rural countryside resulting in dozens of executions.&lt;ref name="EG67"&gt;{{cite web |title=Einsatzgruppen Operational Situation Reports #67 |publisher=HolocaustResearchProject.org |url=http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/einsatz/situationreport67.html |author=H.E.A.R.T  |year=2008 |translator=Hermann Feuer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the reports do not include all killings before the end of 1942.&lt;ref name="tables"&gt;{{cite book |title=Messages of Murder: A Study of the Reports of the Einsatzgruppen of the Security Police and the Security Service, 1941-1943 |author=Ronald Headland |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press |year=1992 |pages=27, 92, 98-101, 146 |ISBN=0838634184 |work=Tables of Killing Statistics: ''Einsatzgruppe'' A, B, C, and D. |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Mue8a5Rwyi0C&amp;q=%22Tables%2Bof%2BKilling%2BStatistics%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8476">'''Endless House''' is a conceptual work of architecture by [[Frederick Kiesler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://misfitsarchitecture.com/2012/09/28/2495/|title=Career Case Study #1: Frederick Kiesler|author=|date=|work=misfits' architecture|accessdate=17 April 2015}}{{better source|1=It's a blog. This could, though, be the start of a summary section.|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiesler used the project to express an elaborate, personal metaphysics based on the concepts of ‘connectivity’, ‘correality’ and ‘biotechnique’. The project was an attempt to merge the spiritual and practical into a new housing typology.&lt;ref name="Unwin2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Unwin|title=Twenty Buildings Every Architect Should Understand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbpxST0YncQC&amp;pg=PA60|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-136-95505-4|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the structure was never built to scale, a miniaturized version was constructed for the “Visionary Architects” exhibit at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], which included [[Louis Kahn]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Buckminster Fuller]], and [[Le Corbusier]]. Kiesler departed in many ways from the modernist ideals of his contemporaries, objecting to pre-fabrication, rationalism, and [[orthogonal]] designs in favor of a curvilinear structure. Reception of the “Endless House” was mixed, garnering the praise of such contemporaries as [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]],&lt;ref name="BognerKiesler1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dieter Bogner|author2=Frederick Kiesler|title=Friedrich Kiesler, 1890-1965: inside the Endless House : 12.

The “Endless House” concept also appeared in the Japanese publication [[Bokubi]] in 1963, and Kiesler’s posthumously published artistic journals, titled “Inside the Endless House.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Iain Borden|title=Intersections: Architectural Histories and Critical Theories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aOiHkGVbKGwC&amp;pg=PA69|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-23292-0|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Endless House model is in the collection of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitney.org/Collection/FrederickKiesler "Frederick Kiesler 1890-1965"]. ''Whitney Museum of American Art''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

The Endless House consists of reinforced concrete over a wire, mesh frame. Its shape is roughly that of a flattened sphere. The structure was elevated on 4 broad pilotis, with two staircases leading to the ground. The layout includes a kitchen/dining room, a living room, a parent’s bedroom, a children’s bedroom, and a space for seclusion. Windows punctuate the design, and are made of semi-transparent plastic. Different types of flooring throughout the house include sand, grass, terra cotta tile, and pebbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archdaily.com/126651/ad-classics-endless-house-friedrick-kiesler/ |title=AD Classics Endless House/Frederick Kiesler |publisher= |accessdate=May 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiesler’s design is biomorphic; he intended to create an organic space, rather than a geometric, linear one.

== Theory ==

Kiesler’s Endless House was intended to communicate his personal views of metaphysics. In terms of architecture, he included abstract aspects of ‘connectivity’, ‘corealation’, and ‘biotechnique’. These terms describe abstract ideas, rather than being specific architectural terms.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

To show connectivity, Kiesler included curvilinear structure that is built of one material, concrete, with no structural seams in the building.  Correalism, the continual interaction between man and nature, meant that Kiesler thought of the rooms of his house as extensions of the bodies of its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://carlymmoore.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/endless-house-final.pdf |title=Endless House Frederick Kiesler |publisher=Carly Moore |accessdate=May 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He explained this in his 1940 article “On Correalism and Biotechnique”, published in the ''Architectural Record''.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== MoMA ==

The Endless House was originally commissioned to be built in full scale in the sculpture garden of the Museum of Modern Art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/arts/design/review-endless-house-expands-the-definition-of-home.html?_r=0 "Review: ‘Endless House’ Expands the Definition of Home"]. ''New York Times'', By JASON FARAGOAUG. 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a new wing was planned for the museum, which meant that the completed building would only have stood for one year. Instead, Arthur Drexler, director of the museum’s department of architecture and design, invited Kiestler to build a scaled down version for his  “Visionary Architects” show, which exhibited 20th century architecture that was considered “too revolutionary to build."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Endless House |last=Kiesler |first=Frederick |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1966 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York, NY |isbn= |page= 278|pages= |accessdate=|url= }}{{primary source-inline|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibit, which opened on September 29, 1960, featured an 8-foot model of the “Endless House”, a full-scale photographic mural of the house, and a series of drawings and sketches.&lt;ref name="Pérez-Gómez2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alberto Pérez-Gómez|title=Built upon Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4KFboR44vgC&amp;pg=PA104|year=2008|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-26422-8|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic influences ==

The original plans for Endless House were presented in Vienna in 1924. At that time, Kiesler was active in the European avant-garde, and a member of the [[De Stijl]] group.   “Endless House” was influenced by Kiesler's interaction with this group, and aimed to comingle art and life by creating an environment that encouraged the occupant's natural inclination towards art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Endless House |last=Kiesler |first=Frederick |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1966 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York, NY |isbn= |page= |pages= |accessdate=  |url= }}{{primary source-inline|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Kiesler moved to [[New York City]] in 1926, he was participated in the [[Surrealist]] movement, which strove to use art to achieve a healthier, natural mental experience. Kiesler’s “Endless House” sketches were not determined by any artistic or architectural conventions, and suggested no particular use of the space: rather, they simply attempted to convey a biomorphic shape, open to the possibilities of its inhabitant’s intent.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Critique of Modernism ==

Kiesler, although often paired with Modernist architects, was an outspoken critic of [[Modernism]] and the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]]. He was especially critical of the Modernist invocation of functionality, which assumes a specific use for a space according to present conceptions of use and value. He considered his biomorphic design to be not only more natural than Modernists who strove for organicity, but also more practical for future use, due to its indeterminacy.  Although “Endless House” was presented in 1960 alongside definitively Modernist architecture projects, it was an implicit critique of Modernism.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''''Ex parte Henning''''' is an important case in [[South African insolvency law]].

== Facts ==
In the applicant’s application for surrender of his estate, it appeared that his wife (to whom he was married out of community of property) had worked for him. He had paid a monthly amount from their joint estate to his creditors.

One of these creditors opposed the application, saying that the surrender of the estate was not to the advantage of creditors, and that he (the opposing creditor) would be better off if the applicant was forced to continue the monthly payments.

== Judgment ==
The court held that nobody could force the applicant’s wife to work if she did not want to. If she stopped working (as, for example, for health reasons) there would, on the facts, scarcely be sufficient to meet the requirements of the family. Accordingly, applicant's wife's contribution towards the monthly payments could not be taken into account in deciding whether the surrender of the estate would be to the advantage of creditors in terms of section 6.

'''Francesco Maria Guazzo''', aka Guaccio, aka Guaccius (1570&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/francesco-maria-guazzo_(Dizionario_Biografico)/ Francesco Maria Guazzo, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 60 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;–16??) was an [[Italians|Italian]] priest. Is most well known for the writing the ''[[Compendium Maleficarum]]'' (Book of Witches).

He was a member of one of the oldest of the Catholic [[Ambrosians|Ambrosian]] orders. These religious brotherhoods had appeared at various times since the 14th Century in and around the city of [[Milan]] and were quite plentiful, but the only one to attain more than simply local importance was the ‘''Fratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus''’ sometimes known as 'The Brethren of the Grove'.

Before 1441 there were various monasteries that were canonically recognized under the name ‘Fratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus’ but there was little link between them. However, in 1441 [[Pope Eugene IV]] merged them into one congregation called ‘Congregatio Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus’ of which Francesco Maria Guazzo was a member under the papacy of [[Pope Sixtus V]] and [[Pope Paul V]].

Guazzo had firsthand experience of the practice and profession of witchcraft and bewitchment and was widely travelled and highly regarded in the field of possessions and demonology and the cures thereof.

During his life he is credited with performing several exorcisms including to members of several ducal and princely families, notably the bewitched [[Cardinal Charles of Lorraine]] and his relative, Eric, [[Bishop of Verdun]].

On another occasion Guazzo was called to Düsseldorf in order to exorcise the mad [[John William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg]] (1562–1609). Guazzo first diagnosed possession, but after five months of unsuccessful attempts at spiritual healing and in the summer of 1604, the diagnosis was changed to bewitchment as the cause of the poor Duke’s mental illness. Guazzo had been sent to Düsseldorf by Duke [[Charles III of Lorraine]] (a family with which he had a long running association, having exorcised the Cardinal, Charles of Lorraine) on behalf of his daughter [[Antonia of Lorraine|Antoinette]] (1569–1610), Duke Johann Wilhelm’s wife.

It was these direct experiences that inspired Guazzo to write his ''[[Compendium Maleficarum]]'' which was published in 1608 and was widely regarded among his contemporaries as the authoritative manuscript on Witchcraft.  Within his text, Guazzo discusses witches’ pacts with the devil, detailed descriptions of witches’ powers and poisons and also prepared his classification of the demons based on a previous work by [[Michael Psellus]].

In this work, Guazzo was greatly influenced by Duke Charles III of Lorraine’s leading lawyer and demonologist, [[Nicholas Remy]] (Remy produced one of the most important early works on demonology and witchcraft in 1595, ''[[Daemonolatreiae libri tres]]'', and claimed to have sentenced to death over 900 people during witch trials between 1582–1592).

'''''Gartrell v. Stafford''''',  12 Neb. 545, 11 N.W. 732 (1882) is a frequently cited 1882 decision of the [[Nebraska Supreme Court]]. It holds that in the case of suit for [[Breach of contract|breach of a contract]] for the sale of real property, there is never an adequate remedy at law, since it may be presumed that the buyer has considered the particular location, soil, easements, and other factors. Since an action for damages would not provide an adequate remedy, the remedy of [[specific performance]] is available.

[[File:General McPherson 1880.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The ''General McPherson'' in 1880]]
The '''''General McPherson''''' was a ship used by the U.S. military to travel between military installations in the [[San Francisco Bay]] area. Named after Union General [[James Birdseye McPherson]], a prominent figure in the [[American Civil War]], the 109 ton two-masted Quartermaster steamer was docked at Pier 7, [[Pacific Street Wharf]], San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Jr2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jr|first=Jerry Lewis Champion|title=The Fading Voices of Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxH3-mB5rCcC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=27 January 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-1488-8|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a small boat, reportedly "not much larger than a tug".&lt;ref name="Soennichsen2001"/&gt;

'''[[Henry Ford]] Academy''' is the first [[charter school]] in the [[United States]] to be developed jointly by a global corporation, public education, and a major [[nonprofit]] cultural institution. The school is sponsored by the [[Ford Motor Company]], Wayne County Regional Educational Service Agency and [[The Henry Ford|The Henry Ford Museum]] and admits high school students. It is located in [[Dearborn, Michigan]] on the campus of the Henry Ford museum. Enrollment is taken from a lottery in the area and totaled 467 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hfacademy.org/pdf/techplan.pdf Technology Plan], Henry Ford Academy, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Freshman meet inside the main museum building in glass walled classrooms, while older students use a converted carousel building and [[Pullman car]]s on a siding of the Greenfield Village railroad. Classes are expected to include use of the museum artifacts, a tradition of the original Village Schools. When the Museum was established in 1929, it included a school which served grades kindergarten to college/trade school ages. The last part of the original school closed in 1969. The new school restarted with a group of 100 freshman in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hfa-dearborn.org/about-hfa/20th-anniversary/ http://hfa-dearborn.org/about-hfa/20th-anniversary/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Henry Ford Learning Institute is using the Henry Ford Academy model for further charter schools including Power House High School in [[Chicago]] and Alameda School for Art + Design in [[San Antonio, Texas]].

The building received the international annual design award of the [[Council of Educational Facilities Planners International]] for 2001, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120302092848/http://www.cefpi.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4284 James D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14785">The '''ITF Rankings''' are the current rankings of national teams by the [[International Tennis Federation]] in both men's and women's [[tennis]]. The ITF produces two sets of rankings—the ITF [[Davis Cup]] Nations Ranking for male national teams, and the ITF [[Fed Cup]] Nations Ranking for female national teams. Both sets of rankings measure the success of all nations participating in both competitions.

The ITF Davis Cup Nations Ranking was launched at the end of 2001 and the ITF Fed Cup Nations Ranking was introduced a year later. Both rankings are updated following every World Group round and are used for [[seed (sports)|seeding]] the highest ranked teams in the draws for each group in the competitions' structures.

==Ranking method==

The ITF [[Davis Cup]] and [[Fed Cup]] rankings are based in a rolling four year cumulative system. However, the points total for each nation is calculated following a weighted sum formula, in which recent results are weighted more heavily.&lt;ref name="ITFDavisCupRankingsExplained"&gt;{{cite web|work=daviscup.com|publisher=International Tennis Federation|title=Rankings Explained| url = http://www.daviscup.com/en/rankings/rankings-explained.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITFFedCupRankingsExplained"&gt;{{cite web|work=fedcup.com|publisher=International Tennis Federation|title=How the Rankings Work| url = http://www.fedcup.com/en/rankings/rankings-explained.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; After each World Group round, the ranking period adjusts, and points earned in the last year period have a weighting factor of 100% in the points total. At the same time, the weighting factor for the points earned until the same round in the previous three years is reduced to 75% (for points earned one to two years ago), 50% (for points earned two to three years ago) and 25% (for points earned three to four years ago).

Ranking points are awarded only to the winning nation of a competition tie at every round. Victories in World Group rounds are worth more points than those in Zone Groups, and ties at the later rounds of the competition are progressively worth more points. Bonus points are also awarded for a nation that defeats a higher-ranked nation, but only if the latter nation is ranked in the top 64 for the Davis Cup, or in the top 75 for the Fed Cup. Unique to the Davis Cup, there is an additional bonus for a nation that wins a tie in the opponent's home ground: a 25% bonus is added to the total of round points and ranking bonus points (if any). At the Fed Cup only, nations that win by walkover are awarded round points but no bonus points, and no points are awarded for consolation events.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; In the Groups I, II and III a nation's points are determined by its overall finishing position. Formats vary according to the numbers of nations playing each year so the value of each win alters too. However the maximum points a nation can win at each level remains constant.&lt;ref name="ITFFedCupRankingsExplained" /&gt;

The '''Internet Public Library''' ('''IPL, ipl2''') was a non-profit, largely student-run [[website]] managed by a consortium, headed by [[Drexel University]].  Visitors could ask reference questions, and volunteer librarians and graduate students in library and information science formed collections and answered questions. The IPL opened on March 17, 1995. On January 1, 2010 it merged with the Librarians' Internet Index to become ipl2.&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;"[http://www.ipl.org/div/about/timeline/ Timeline of ipl2/IPL History]". ipI2 Consortium.&lt;/ref&gt; It ceased operations completely on June 30, 2015.

The digital collections on the site were divided into five broad categories, and include Resources by Subject, Newspapers &amp; Magazines, Special Collections Created By the ipl2, and Special Collections for Kids and Teens. As of March 2011 it had about 40,000 searchable resources.&lt;ref name="IT"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Hane, Paula J.|title=Internet Public Library milestones |newspaper=Information Today|volume=28|issue=4| date=April 2011 |page=8|url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-253845202/internet-public-library-milestones|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The IPL originated at the [[University of Michigan]]’s School of Information. Michigan SI students almost exclusively generated its content.  They also managed the Ask a Question reference service. In 2006 the University of Michigan opened up management of the IPL to other information science and library schools. They stopped hosting the IPL and moved the servers and staff positions to [[Drexel University]],&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt; and by January 2007 the "IPL Consortium" that ran the IPL comprised a group of 15 colleges, including the [[University of Michigan]].

In 2009 the Internet Public Library merged with the Librarians' Internet Index,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lii.org/cs/lii/print/htdocs/about_overview.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901204208/http://lii.org/cs/lii/print/htdocs/about_overview.htm|archive-date=1 September 2009|title=Overview|website=Librarians' Internet Index|access-date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a publicly funded website that until then was managed by the Califa Library group;&lt;ref&gt;Oder, Norman (October&amp;nbsp;7, 2008).

The '''Malatestiana Library''' ({{Lang-it|Biblioteca Malatestiana}}), also known as the '''Malatesta Novello Library''', is a public library in the city of [[Cesena]] in northern [[Italy]]. Purpose-built from 1447 to 1452 and opened in 1454, and named after the local aristocrat [[Malatesta Novello]], it is significant for being the first civic library in Europe, i.e. belonging to the [[medieval commune|commune]] rather than the church or a noble family, and open to the general public. The library was inscribed in UNESCO's [[Memory of the World Register – Europe and North America|Memory of the World Register]] in 2005.

== History and influence ==
The building and creation of the library was commissioned by the Lord of Cesena, [[Malatesta Novello]]. Construction was directed by [[Matteo Nuti]] from [[Fano]] (a pupil of [[Leon Battista Alberti]]) and lasted from 1447 to 1452. At Novello's direction, the books were owned by the commune of Cesena, not the monastery or the family.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Nomination"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/mow/nomination_forms/italy_malatesta_novello_library.pdf | title=MEMORY OF THE WORLD REGISTER: Nomination Form: The Malatesta Novello Library | publisher=UNESCO | accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this governing structure, the collection was not dispersed like many monastic libraries.&lt;ref name="CERL" /&gt;

In 2005 [[UNESCO]] included the Library in the [[Memory of the World Programme]] Register.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-malatesta-novello-library/ | title=The Malatesta Novello Library | publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization | date=2005 | accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facility ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2014}} 
[[Image:Ingresso Malatestiana.JPG|170px|right|thumb|Entrance to the aula (''Aula del Nuti'').]]

The Malatestiana Library is the only one in the world of the so-called humanistic-conventual type, which blends humanistic principles with arhictecture otherwise reserved for religious buildings, and has preserved its structure, fittings and codexes since its opening more than 550 years ago. The main doorway was the work of sculptor [[Agostino di Duccio]] (1418–1481). The walnut door at the main entrance dates back to 1454 and was carved by the artist Cristoforo from [[San Giovanni in Persiceto]].

Inside, the library features geometric design, typical of the early Italian [[Renaissance]] style. The [[Atrium (architecture)|aula]] has the layout of a [[basilica]] (reflecting the importance of the library as a "temple of culture"), with three [[nave]]s divided by ten rows of white columns made from local stone; there are eleven [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] in each aisle, which are pole vaulted. The central nave is [[barrel vault]]ed and ends with a rose under which is the gravestone of Malatesta Novello.

The fittings are composed of 58 desks, with coat of arms at the sides. The light comes in through the 44 [[Venetian Gothic architecture|Venetian style]] windows, which were purpose designed to provide ideal lighting for reading.

== Holdings ==
[[File:Sala del Nuti 6.jpg|right|thumb|Reading room]]

The library has over 400,000 books, including over 340 [[codex|codices]] covering various fields such as religion, [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Latin]] classics, sciences and medicine, and about 3,200 manuscripts from the 16th century.&lt;ref name="CERL"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cerl.org/resources/links_to_other_resources/istituzione_biblioteca_malatestiana | title=Istituzione Biblioteca Malatestiana | publisher=[[Consortium of European Research Libraries]] | date=2012 | accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The oldest manuscript in the library is a copy of [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]]'s ''[[Etymologiae]]''.&lt;ref name="TravelThru"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.travelthruhistory.com/html/art54.html | title=LA BIBLIOTECA MALATESTIANA: EUROPE'S FIRST PUBLIC LIBRARY | publisher=Travel Thru History | accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Manifesto of the Province of Flanders''' (1790 Dutch: ''Manifest van de Provintie van Vlaenderen''; modern Dutch: ''Manifest van de Provincie Vlaanderen'') was the [[declaration of independence]] of the [[county of Flanders]] on 4 January 1790, during the [[Brabantine Revolution]]. On this day, the [[States of Flanders]] "solemnly declare[d] in the name of the People, the province of Flanders to be an independent State, and definitively withdrawn from its loyalty and obedience to [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Joseph II]], [[count of Flanders]], and from the [[Habsburg Monarchy|House of Austria]]."&lt;ref&gt;Original text: "(...) verklaeren wy pligtig, en maeken kenbaer uyt den naem van het Volk, de Provintie van Vlaenderen eenen onafhangelyken Staet te zyn, en 't eenemael ontrokken aen de getrouwigheyd en gehoorzaemheyd van den Keyzer Joseph den II., Graeve van Vlaenderen, en van het Huys van Oostenrijk."&lt;/ref&gt; The States also declared "all officials, lieges and other servants, whoever they may be, free and absolved from all concluded and indebted contracts, and discharged from every oath done to the fallen count of Flanders."&lt;ref&gt;Original text: "Verklaeren nog alle Hoog-regt hebbende, Amptenaeren, Leen-mannen en alle andere Bediende, wie die ook wezen mogten, vry en ontlast van alle aengegaen en schuldige verbintenissen; en verders ontslagen van allen eed aen den vervallen Grave van Vlaenderen gedaen."&lt;/ref&gt; 

Resistance against the reign of Joseph II in the [[Austrian Netherlands]], which worsened in 1786–87 when a number of States refused to pay their taxes (''beden'') and the ''[[Vogt|landvoogden]]'' reversed all reform decrees on their own authority, escalated to open rebellion in the course of 1789, heavily influenced by the simultaneous [[French Revolution]] and [[Liège Revolution]] which had commenced a few months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Brabantse Omwenteling. §1. Oorzaken". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt; 
On  24 October 1789, [[Hendrik van der Noot]] had already proclaimed the independence of the [[Duchy of Brabant]] by the ''[[Manifesto of the People of Brabant]]'', abjuring Joseph II as the [[duke of Brabant]].&lt;ref name="Kossmann59"&gt;{{aut|[[Ernst Kossmann|Ernst Heinrich Kossmann]]}}, ''De Lage Landen 1780-1980. Twee eeuwen Nederland en België. Deel I: 1780–1914'' (2005) p. 59. Amsterdam/Antwerp: Olympus (part of Atlas Contact).&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Breda]] in the [[Dutch Republic]], a small army of patriots first conquered Brabant, next Flanders, [[county of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[Tournai and the Tournaisis]], [[County of Namur|Namur]] and the rest of the [[Southern Netherlands]] except [[Duchy of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], finally taking Brussels in December.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Brabantse Omwenteling. §3. De opstand". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The manifesto elaborates why the Habsburg princes had not fulfilled their "constitutional" duties, and therefore, the abjuration of Joseph II's right to rule was justified. After summing up all violations of their rightful freedoms, the States of Flanders conclude: "Thus, one sought to subject the brave Netherlanders&lt;ref&gt;The original Dutch text calls the inhabitants of the Southern Netherlands 'Nederlanders', literally "Netherlanders". There was no English or French equivalent for this word at the time. When the English used the term "the Dutch", they generally referred to the population of the Dutch Republic, not the Austrian Netherlands, although the latter's northern half also spoke Dutch dialects. The French generally used the term "hollandais" to refer to the Republic's populace, employing a [[pars pro toto]]. In 18th-century French, the Southern Netherlands were increasingly referred to as ''Belgique'' and its people ''Belges'', whereas the Dutch-speaking population of the Austrian Netherlands kept referring to themselves as ''Nederlanden'' and ''Nederlanders'', in cultural unison with the Dutch-speaking Northern Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; to complete slavery, and treat them like the inhabitants of Moravia and Croatia." The text composed in Dutch and French by [[Karel Jozef de Graeve]], [[Jean-Joseph Raepsaet]] and [[Maarten de Bast]]. The ideas expressed in the manifesto were primarily inspired by the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] (1776).&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Kossmann}} (2005) 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[States-Provincial|States]] of the respective Southern Netherlandish provinces [[Treaty of Union (1790)|united]] in a new [[confederation|confederal]] [[republic]], the [[United Belgian States]] (7 January – 11 December 1790), which was reconquered after eleven months by the Imperial army.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v.

'''Mouat v Clark Boyce''' [1992] 2 NZLR 559 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding  the award of damages for breach of contract.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=246-247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Dorothy Mouat was an elderly 72-year-old widow. Her son Robert Mouat wanted to borrow $100,000 for house alterations and for business expenses, and arranged for his mother to grant a mortgage over her Roydvale Avenue, Christchurch home as security for the loan.

When it came to sign the mortgage documents, Robert's solicitor refused to be party to the transaction, and Robert decided to use the law firm of Clark Boyce, whom were also his mother's solicitors.

Clarke Boyce informed Mrs Mouat 3 times that she should obtain independent advice, which she declined to do. In the end they got her to sign a form confirming that she refused to seek legal advice, and the mortgage documents were duly signed.

However, 2 years later, the inevitable happened, with Robert defaulting on the loan, and was later declared bankrupt as well. 

Dorothy later sued Clarke Boyce for negligence.

The outcome of the case pertained that because Clark Boyce had made Mouat aware of the fiduciary obligations, Clark Boyce was not liable for any losses.

On {{Date|2008-09-03}}, Phoronix Test Suite 1.2 was released with support for the [[OpenSolaris]] operating system&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | type = mailing list |date=Jul 2008 | url = http://phoronix-test-suite.com/pipermail/trondheim-pts_phoronix-test-suite.com/2008-July/000028.html | title = trondheim-pts | contribution = Phoronix Test Suite 1.2 To Support OpenSolaris}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a module framework accompanied by tests focusing upon new areas&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.linux.com/feature/138463?page=2 | newspaper = Linux.com | title = Phoronix Test Suite brings Linux benchmarking to the desktop}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and many new test profiles.

Phoronix Test Suite 1.8 includes a graphical user interface (GUI) using [[GTK+]] written using the [[PHP-GTK]] bindings.

3.4 includes MATISK benchmarking module and initial support for the [[GNU Hurd]].

== Criticism ==
[[Phoronix]] uses Phoronix Test Suite to compare performance of different operating systems&amp;nbsp;– [[Linux distribution]]s, [[OpenSolaris]] and [[FreeBSD]]. Critics of Phoronix Test Suite argue that some of the third party tests are unfair towards some platforms.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

The compiler used in building the source based tests have a large impact on the results.  Depending on the reader's point of view this is seen as a detriment to the value of the results.  However other readers may see that as a realistic expectation of performance for that particular system with that operating system.
PTS 3.8 reports compiler options and compiler differences between test runs.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

The '''Proclamation of Połaniec''' (also known as the Połaniec Manifesto; {{lang-pl|Uniwersał Połaniecki}}), issued on 7 May 1794 by [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] near the town of [[Połaniec]], was one of the most notable events of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]]'s [[Kościuszko Uprising]], and the most famous legal act of the Uprising. It partially abolished [[serfdom]] in Poland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://victorian.fortunecity.com/wooton/34/halecki/15.htm |title=Paritions of Poland |publisher=Victorian.fortunecity.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; granting substantial [[civil liberties]] to all the [[peasant]]s. The motives behind the Połaniec Proclamation were twofold: first, Kosciuszko, a liberal and reformer, believed that serfdom was an unfair system and should be ended; second, the uprising was in desperate need of recruits, and freeing the peasants would prompt many to enlist.

The proclamation provided the peasants with the [[personal freedom]], right for assistance from the [[Sovereign state|state]] against the abuses of the Polish nobility ([[szlachta]]) and gave them specific [[property rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lituanus.org/1986/86_1_03.htm |title=The Unusual Story of Thaddeus Kosciusko |publisher=Lituanus.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the land they cultivated. Although this new law never fully came into being and was [[boycotted]] by much of the [[szlachta]], it also attracted many peasants to the ranks of the revolutionists, resulting in the formation of the famous ''[[kosynierzy]]'' peasant [[infantry]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ku.edu/~eceurope/hist557/lect3-4.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; the most famous of whom, [[Bartosz Głowacki]], became one of the heroes of the Uprising. It was the first time in [[History of Poland|Polish history]] when the peasants were officially regarded as part of the ''[[nation]]'', the word being previously equal to ''szlachta''.

This was the second legal act issued by the reformed [[Poland|Polish]] state (the first being the [[Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791|Constitution of May 3]], considered the second oldest constitution in the world, and was the expansion of the 4th act of that constitution. It was also the last legal act of the Commonwealth, and just like the constitution that made it possible, it had a short lifespan and negligible impact on most of Commonwealth citizens. In many places where revolutionary forces could not enforce it, the local szlachta simply ignored the proclamation.&lt;ref name="LukowskiZawadzki2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jerzy Lukowski|author2=Hubert Zawadzki|title=A concise history of Poland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NpMxTvBuWHYC&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=22 January 2012|date=20 September 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-55917-1|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the news of the proclamation spread among the peasantry and was kept alive by the revolutionary and patriotic minded Poles. Over the next several decades, after the [[partitions of Poland]] ended the existence of Poland as a separate state, it became one of the symbols of Polish history.

The proclamation specifically granted to peasants:
* limited [[personal freedom]]
* reduction of [[serfdom]] during the current crisis and promise of further reduction after the end of hostilities
* freeing from serfdom of all peasants conscripted to the military
* the right not to be removed from their land
* limited right to appeal to the state's courts
* introduction of the ''dozorca'' office, the first government official representing the peasant will to the government. Dozorca represented about 1000 families, and he was supposed to enforce the proclamation

Sports |publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]] |date=August 11, 2012 |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (January 27, 1931 &amp;ndash; August 11, 2012) was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]].

==Professional wrestling career==
He took part in [[football]] and [[swimming]] in [[Secondary school|high school]] and broke in on Midwest [[carnival|carnivals]], fighting local toughs and learning wrestling the hard way. Turning professional, he began in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]] and toured the United States with great success. Bastien was small for a wrestler at 185 pounds, but he was quick, vigorous, fast and employed a wide assortment of aerial moves. His teachers were Henry Kollan, Einar Olsen, Joe Pazandak and [[Verne Gagne]], and his peak years were from 1959 to 1971. His favorite finishing moves were the dropkick, flying head scissors, atomic drop and abdominal stretch.

Bastien teamed up with Lou Klein to form the Bastien Brothers tag team and, in 1960, won the United States Tag Team Championship from Eddie and Jerry Graham in April 1960. They won the title twice more, from the Grahams and then from the [[Fabulous Kangaroos]] ([[Roy Heffernan]] and [[Al Costello]]). Bastien went on to win several more tag team championships.

Bastien was the frequent [[tag team]] partner of [[Billy Red Lyons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption|author=Watts, Bill|publisher=ECW Press|year=2006|isbn=1-55022-708-4|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duo unmasked wrestler [[Don Jardine]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Heels|author=Oliver, Greg|publisher=ECW Press|year=2007|isbn=1-55022-759-9|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bastien was the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booker]] in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Pit with Piper|chapter=The Los Angeles Years|author=Piper, Roddy|publisher=Penguin|year=2002|isbn=0-425-18721-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Bastein appeared in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), and teamed briefly with champion [[Bruno Sammartino]].
He returned for one match in [[Madison Square Garden]] in June 1970 (his last appearance there), being pinned by [[Professor Tanaka]] but prior to that, putting on an amazing performance, dominating most of the match. 

He had a hot main event run in [[Florida]] in the late 1960s, including memorable bouts with [[Johnny Valentine]].

In his retirement, Bastien became a [[Facilitator|trainer]] and a [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]], and discovered future wrestlers [[Steve Borden|Steve "Sting" Borden]] and [[The Ultimate Warrior|Jim "The Ultimate Warrior" Hellwig]] at a [[Gold's Gym]] and convinced them to become professional wrestlers.&lt;ref name=sting8&gt;{{cite book|title=Wrestling Greats: Sting|author=Davies, Ross|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2001|isbn=0-8239-3490-X|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bastien and professional wrestling [[manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Rick Bassman]] formed an alliance of wrestlers called Powerteam USA, of which Borden and Hellwig were a part.&lt;ref name=sting8/&gt; The team debuted in November 1985, and after the other two members left the group, Borden and Hellwig continued to tag together.&lt;ref name=sting8/&gt;

==Personal life==
Bastien was good friends with fellow wrestler [[Roddy Piper]] and was the [[best man]] at his [[wedding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Pit with Piper|chapter=Preface|author=Piper, Roddy|publisher=Penguin|year=2002|isbn=0-425-18721-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bastien served as president of the [[Cauliflower Alley Club]] for six years from 2001 to 2007, but was reported in 2010 to be suffering from [[Alzheimer’s disease]], his health progressively getting worse. Bastien died on August 11, 2012 at age 81.&lt;ref name=CanoeObit/&gt;

A '''service record''' is a collection of either electronic or printed material which provides a [[documentary evidence|documentary]] [[history]] of a person's activities and accomplishments while serving as a member of a given [[organization]].  Service records are most often associated with the [[military]], but are commonly found in other groups, such as large [[corporations]] or for use by [[employee]]s of a civilian [[government]].

==Australian armed forces==
Service records for the [[Australian Army]], are available at the National Archives of Australia website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/index.aspx National Archives of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/army-boer.aspx Boer War records&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/army-wwi.aspx First World War records&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/army-between.aspx inter-World War records&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/army-wwii.aspx Second World War records&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/army-after.aspx Post–Second World War records&lt;/ref&gt; The service records of the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force are also available.

World War I service records provide the dates when the person was "in the field", that is with his unit on active service, if and when they embarked for oversea service, and the names of the units in which the person served. The service record also documents other changes—promotions, transfers, time at base, the date and place of sickness or wounding, and the names of hospital or clearing station where the person was treated.

==Nazi Germany==
The records of [[Nazi Germany]] are extensive and the record keeping ability of the [[Nazi Party]] was generally considered to be extremely meticulous.  Service records of Nazi organizations are maintained at the [[Berlin Document Center]], in [[Berlin, Germany]], with several [[microfiche]] copies of these records available at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] in [[College Park, Maryland]].

Records of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'', that is the regular armed forces of Germany during [[World War II]], are maintained at the ''[[Bundesarchiv]]'', also in [[Berlin]].

==United States armed forces==
{{main|Military personnel file (United States)}}
Service records of the [[United States armed forces]] are considered vital documents both for historical reasons and also to help secure [[veteran]] benefits for discharged or retired service members.  In addition, service records of the U.S. military provide a chronology of a service member's career and thus ensure accurate tracking of accomplishments, activities, and promotions.

Active duty U.S. military service records are maintained by the various branches of the U.S. armed forces.  Retired and discharged service records are maintained at the [[Military Personnel Records Center]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

After 2005, most U.S. military service records are retained by the military branch since most such records are electronically stored.

'''Typical makeup of a United States military paper service record'''

The '''Society of Indexers''' (SI) is a professional society based in the UK, with its offices in Sheffield, England, but has members worldwide. 
It exists to promote [[index (publishing)|index]]ing, the quality of indexes and the profession of indexing. It provides a distance training course in indexing leading to its qualification of Professional Member. Further professional experience leads to Advanced Professional Member and beyond that the qualification of Fellow of the Society is awarded for proof of experience and index quality. Its online [https://www.indexers.org.uk/find-an-indexer/directory/ directory of professional indexers] lists qualified members available to take freelance indexing work.

== History ==
The Society of Indexers was formally constituted at the premises of the National Book League in the UK on 30 March 1957 by G. Norman Knight and approximately 60 other people. He "count[ed] it as one of the achievements of the Society to have removed the intense feeling of solitude in which the indexer (of books and journals, at any rate) used to work."&lt;ref&gt;The Indexer Vol 1 March 1958 p.5 [http://www.indexers.org.uk/SIauto/IA/TI_IndexerContents.php?vol=01&amp;iss=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later members in various areas of the world grouped together and formed societies which are now affiliated

*[[Australian and New Zealand Society of Indexers]] [http://www.aussi.org/]
*[[China Society of Indexers]] [http://www.cnindex.fudan.edu.cn/introduce_01.htm]

== Publications ==
It started publishing its journal, ''The Indexer'' ISSN 0019-4131 (print) ISSN 1756-0632 (online), in 1958 which continues today and is the official journal of all the indexing societies. Originally published twice each year, it is now quarterly. Subscriptions are open to members and non-members. Issues up until two years ago are available online on its website [http://www.theindexer.org/]

The society newsletter ''SIdelights'' &lt;!-- Capitalization is correct. It is SI delights --&gt;is published quarterly and is only available to society members.

== Conferences ==
Conferences are held, usually annually and in the UK.

[[Image:Supplementum Plantarum Systematis Vegetabilium.jpg|thumb|right|The cover page of ''Supplementum Plantarum'']]
'''''{{lang|la|Supplementum Plantarum Systematis Vegetabilium Editionis Decimae Tertiae, Generum Plantarum Editiones Sextae, et Specierum Plantarum Editionis Secundae}}''''', commonly abbreviated to '''''{{lang|la|Supplementum Plantarum Systematis Vegetabilium}}''''' or just '''''{{lang|la|Supplementum Plantarum}}''''', and further abbreviated by [[botanist]]s to '''''Suppl. Pl.''''', is a 1782 book by [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger]]. Written entirely in [[Latin]], it was intended as a supplement to the 1737 ''{{lang|la|[[Genera Plantarum]]}}'' and the 1753 ''{{lang|la|[[Species Plantarum]]}}'', both written by the author's father, the "father of modern taxonomy", [[Carl Linnaeus]].

Its full title means: “''Supplement of Plants'', the 13th edition of ''A System of Vegetables'', the 6th edition of ''The Genera of Plants'' and the 2nd edition of ''The Species of Plants''”, listing the components of the book in order of presentation.
The ''Systematis Vegetabilium'' (13th edition) in the title refers to ''{{lang|la|[[Systema Naturæ]]}}'' as published in 1774 by [[Johan Andreas Murray]], a student of Linnaeus, Sr.&lt;ref name=renamed_from_1785_on_20131127160155/&gt;

The cover page indicates that it was published in 1781, and it was long believed to have been published in October of that year. In 1976, however, Hermann Manitz used a letter written by [[Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart]] to show that it had in fact been published in April 1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Manitz, Hermann | year = 1976 | title = Friedrich Ehrhart und die Publikation des "Supplementum plantarum" von Linne filius | journal = Taxon | volume = 25 | issue = 2/3 | pages = 305–322 | doi = 10.2307/1219459 | publisher = Taxon, Vol. 25, No. 2/3 | jstor = 1219459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the cover page states that the book was originally printed in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] (''{{lang|la|Brunvigæ}}''), [[Lower Saxony]], northwestern Germany by the printshop Orphanotropheum (''{{lang|la|[[wikt:impensa|impensis]] Orphanotrophei}}'' means ‘At the expense of the Orphanotropheum’&lt;ref&gt;[http://net.lib.byu.edu/~catalog//people/rlm/glossary/glossary.htm Glossary of Common Latin Terms Found in Imprints of Early Printed Books]&lt;/ref&gt;). The book has 467 pages.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Agricultural Library]] Special Collections, [http://specialcollections.nal.usda.gov/speccoll/collectionsguide/linnaeus/LinneBib_2010-04-01.pdf Complete List of Linnaeus Materials]&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was translated by [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s  Lichfield Botanical Society as ''A System of Vegetables'' (1785). It leaves the [[binomial nomenclature]] untranslated in the original Latin, but uses English in the keys and descriptions.&lt;ref name=renamed_from_1785_on_20131127160155&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Griffiths|title=The Monthly Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hr7kAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA401|date=June 1785|page=401|format=see [[Monthly Review (London)|The Monthly Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Tamil Nadu District Gazetteers''''' (previously '''''Madras District Gazetteers''''') are a series of district [[encyclopedias]] published by the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]].

== History ==
The concepts of individual district gazetteers originated in the mid 19th century. The Madras District Manual published by J. H. Nelson in 1868 was the first of its kind. This was followed by the South Arcot District Manual ([[John Henry Garstin]], 1878), Trichinopoly District Manual (Lewis Moore, 1878), Chingleput District Manual (C. S. Crole, 1879), Tinnevely District Manual (A. J. Stuart, 1879), Nilgiris District Manual (H. B. Grigg, 1880), North Arcot District Manual (Arthur F. Cox, 1881), Salem District Manual (H. Le Fanu, 1883), Tanjore District Manual(T. Venkataswamy, 1883) and Coimbatore District Manual (F. A. Nicholson, 1887).

By the early 1900s, however, these manuals had become obsolete. Hence, they were revised in detail and expanded and re-published as district gazetteers. The first of the gazetteers appeared in 1906. Since then, there have been plenty of gazetteers published both in British as well as independent India. Post-independence, the work has been mainly handled by B. S. Baliga of the Madras Record Office.

The '''Teylers Stichting''' (English: '''Teylers Foundation''') is a Dutch [[Foundation (non-profit)|foundation]] founded with the heritage of the Dutch 18th century cloth merchant and banker [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]] to support the people in need and encourage [[worship]], [[science]] and [[art]] (''ter ondersteuning van behoeftigen en ter aanmoediging van godsdienst, wetenschap'').&lt;ref name="StichtingByMuseum"&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/index.php?item=17 description of Teylers Stichting] on the website of Teylers Museum (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Memorial to the first Directors of Teylers Stichting, Teylers Museum, Haarlem..jpg|thumb|Memorial to the first Directors of Teylers Stichting in the Oval Room, 1784]]
[[File:Haarlem - Teylers Fundatiehuis - gevel met zandstenen platen.jpg|thumb|The Teylers Fundatiehuis (Foundation House), where the Teylers Stichting resides.]]

When Teyler deceased in 1778, he was without children or direct family, and specified in his [[Will (law)|testament]] how his money was to be spent. He left money for several individuals, the church and the general benefit as described above. Claims have been made by alleged family members that the testament was supposed to be limited in time to 100&amp;nbsp;years, after which the remaining money were to be transferred to the Teylers family. No claims of such have been recognized in court. 

The Stichting was founded by five friends of Teylers, who were his [[executor]]s and the first directors. The first replacing director (board member) of the Teylers Stichting was [[Adriaan van Zeebergh]], the [[pensionaris]] of the city of [[Haarlem]], a powerful civil servant position at the time. He replaced Barnaart, who died in 1780. 

== Governance and field of work ==
The foundation is governed by five directors, which are appointed via [[Co-option]]. The first directors were five of Teylers friends:
* [[Jacobus Barnaart (1726-1780)|Jacobus Barnaart]] (1778-1780) (In 1780 replaced by [[Adriaan van Zeebergh]] (1780-1824))
* [[Isaac Brand]] (1778-1782)
* [[Gerard Hugaart]] (1778-1791)
* [[Antoni Kuits]] (1778-1789)
* [[Willem van der Vlugt Sr.]] (1778-1807)

The directors traditionally meet in the "[[Grote Herenkamer]]" (Large Boardroom) at the [[Teylers Fundatiehuis]] (English: Foundation House), a room adjacent to the [[Teylers Oval Room|Oval Room]] of [[Teylers Museum]]. The current (2008&lt;ref name="StichtingByMuseum" /&gt;) directors are: 
* drs.&lt;ref&gt;drs. is a scientific title, comparable with [[MSc.]]&lt;/ref&gt; J.R. Beets-Hehewerth
* mr.&lt;ref&gt;mr. is a scientific title, comparable with [[LLM]]&lt;/ref&gt; J.J. van Es
* mr. J.E. Trip, treasurer
* R.A.M. van Voorst van Beest-Gunst, secretary
* mr. C.G.A. van Wijk, presiding director

The Teylers Stichting was responsible for the [[Teylers Museum]], the [[Teylers Hofje]] and two societies: the [[Teylers Eerste Genootschap]] (Teylers First Society) which focuses on theological questions and the [[Teylers Tweede Genootschap]] (Teylers Second Society) which focuses on scientific questions. The Stichting is also responsible for the [[Teylers Chair]] at [[Leiden University]]. The actual management of the museum was left to a ''kastelein'' and later the ''museum director'' (not to confuse with the directors of the foundation).

In 1981 the governance of the Museum was transferred to a separate foundation on the request of the government, so that they could help fund it through subsidies after its recognition as museum of national importance.&lt;ref name="MuseumOrganization"&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/index.php?item=34 Description how the Teylers Museum is organized] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513185812/http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/index.php?item=34 |date=2013-05-13 }} on the website of Teylerse Museum&lt;/ref&gt; This separate foundation became the [[Stichting tot Beheer en Instandhouding van Teylers Museum]] (''Foundation for management and conservation of Teylers Museum''), and the Teylers Stichting still appoints two of the six members of the [[Supervisory Board]] of that foundation. The Teylers Stichting still does own the actual buildings. 

As determined in the testament as well, the Stichting is established in the [[Teylers Fundatiehuis|Fundatiehuis]].

== Archive ==
The complete archive of the Teylers Stichting is still intact and available. The early years (1778–1827/1828) in the archive have been digitized and are available online on the website of the Teylers Museum.&lt;ref name="TeylersArchive"&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=arch&amp;lang=nl Description of Teylers Stichting archive] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525200129/http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=arch&amp;lang=nl |date=2013-05-25 }} on website Teylers Museum&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the minutes of the directors' meetings and the receipts of materials and museum pieces that were bought. From these receipts it can be reconstructed what the activities of the Teylers Stichting have been in the past. 

The archive has been stored in a special room in the Fundatiehuis, as specified in the testament, which was provided with a special lock with five keyholes. Each of the directors would get one of the five different keys, and the lock was designed in such a way that it could not be opened or closed without at least three of the five keys - irrespective which.

'''''The Joy of Sex''''' is an illustrated [[sex manual]] by British author [[Alex Comfort]]. First published in 1972, an updated edition was released in September 2008.

==Overview==
[[File:Joyofsezx.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A later cover, with an illustration showing the "bearded man"]]

''The Joy of Sex'' spent eleven weeks at the top of the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller list]] and more than 70 weeks in the top five (1972–1974).&lt;ref&gt;John Bear, ''The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago'', Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original intention was to use the same approach as such cook books as ''[[The Joy of Cooking]]'', hence section titles include "starters" and "main courses". The book features sexual practices such as [[oral sex]] and various [[List of sex positions|sex position]]s as well as bringing "further out" practices such as [[Bondage (BDSM)|sexual bondage]] and [[swinging (sexual practice)|swinging]] to the attention of the general public.

The original version was illustrated with a mixture of classical Indian and Japanese erotica and specially commissioned illustrations by [[Chris Foss]] (black-and-white line drawings) and Charles Raymond (colour paintings). These two artists based their work on photographs taken by Chris Foss, of Charles Raymond and his wife. The illustrations have become somewhat dated, mainly because of changes in hairstyles. Both the illustrations and text are titillating as well as illustrative, in contrast to the bland, clinical style of earlier books about sex. More recent editions feature new artwork, and added text emphasizing [[safer sex]].

Newer versions have reversed previously-supportive positions on topics such as swinging, due to extensive textual changes made at the height of the 1980s [[AIDS]] panic.

A pocket book version entitled, ''The Joy of Sex, the Pocket Edition'' was also published. The book won the [[Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burkardt |first=John |url=http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~burkardt/fun/wordplay/title_oddest.html |title=The Oddest Book Titles |publisher=John Burkardt |date=2007-06-01 |accessdate=2008-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310190018/http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~burkardt/fun/wordplay/title_oddest.html |archivedate=2008-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Joy of Sex'' did not address [[Homosexual sexual practices|homosexual sex]] beyond a definitional level.  Though there was a careful (for the day) treatment of bondage, other [[BDSM]] activities received definitional coverage at best. The book played a notable part in the [[Sexual revolution#Nonfiction sex manuals|sexual revolution]].

In 1984, [[National Lampoon's Joy of Sex|a film]] loosely based on the book was released.

==Controversy==
There has been controversy over ''The Joy of Sex'' in the United States.  Religious groups have fought to keep it out of [[public libraries]].  In March 2008, the [[Nampa, Idaho]] public library board ruled in favor of removing ''The Joy of Sex'' and ''[[The Joy of Gay Sex]]'' from the libraries' shelves, making them only available upon request in the library director's office.  The books were restored to shelves in September 2008 in response to [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] threats of litigation.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.idahostatesman.com/166/story/497414.html Nampa library restores 'Joy of Sex' books].  Kristin Rodine.  Retrieved on 2008-09-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Updated 2008 edition==
Publisher Mitchell Beazley released an updated edition of the book in September 2008. The new edition was rewritten and reinvented by relationship psychologist [[Susan Quilliam]] and approved by Nicholas Comfort, the original author's son.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Davies. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/10/healthandwellbeing.familyandrelationships "Joy of Sex gets makeover for generation that found Viagra"].  ''[[The Observer]]'', February 10, 2008. Accessed 30 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

More material has been added to the book, and the remaining text has been rewritten from both a factual and psychological viewpoint to take into account social shifts since 1972. The new edition presents a more balanced female/male perspective and also contains 120 completely re-shot photographs and re-drawn illustrations.

The quirky style—and the message of the book, that sex is fun—remain the same. Mitchell Beazley has marketed the ''New Joy'' with the subtitle "a thinking person's guide to sex".

'''''The Penguin Atlas of World History''''' is a two-volume, paperback-sized [[historical atlas]] first published by [[Penguin Books]] in 1974, with the latest edition published in 2004. It was translated from a [[German language|German]] atlas, ''Atlas zur Weltgeschichte'' by Hermann Kinder and Werner Hilgemann, originally published by Deutsche Taschenbuch Verlag ten years prior to the first English edition, in 1964.

Volume 1 encompasses [[pre-history]] to the eve of the [[French Revolution]], and Volume 2 includes the Revolution itself and extends to the [[Iraq War]]. The book is formatted such that maps appear on the left-hand page with accompanying textual notations on the right, as opposed to most larger-format atlases that feature irregular and mixed formatting of text and maps. However, time lines, such as one tracing the [[Evolutionary history of life|development of life]], and organizational charts, such as a graphic depicting the workings of the [[United Nations]] according to its [[United Nations Charter|charter]], are occasionally featured as well.

The Atlas is also notable for Werner Hilgemann's unique cartographical style, which treats city and state names on maps as political/governing entities, allowing them to be graphically linked with other labels to show alliances and treaties, thereby adding an extra informational dimension.

The Zebra was founded in 2012 by [[Adam Lyons]] who previously worked in the insurance industry in both brokering and underwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lapowsky|first1=Issie|title=How a 26-Year-Old Founder Landed Mark Cuban's Money|url=http://www.inc.com/issie-lapowsky/how-to-get-mark-cubans-money.html|accessdate=2 January 2015|publisher=Inc.|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally named '''Insurance Zebra''', the company initially started in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lalorek|title=Why I Moved My Company To Austin|url=http://www.siliconhillsnews.com/2012/10/10/why-i-moved-my-company-to-austin/|accessdate=5 January 2015|publisher=Silicon Hills News|date=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Zebra was part of the Alpha Lab Incubator Program run by the Pittsburgh venture capital firm Innovation Works, where it gained the attention of venture capital fund Silverton Partners.&lt;ref name=PGazetteAustinAsce&gt;{{cite news|last1=Todd|first1=Deborah M.|title=Austin ascends: High tech transforms Texas capital into a star|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2013/03/10/Austin-ascends-High-tech-transforms-Texas-capital-into-a-star/stories/201303100232|accessdate=2 January 2015|publisher=The Post Gazette|date=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Joseph Raymond Mondt was born in [[Garden Grove, Iowa]] on January 18, 1894.&lt;ref name="nwa95"/&gt; Joseph (Joe) Toots was his professional name. Toots' father, Frank, was a farmer and building contractor. The Mondt family moved to [[Weld County, Colorado]] in 1904.&lt;ref name="nwa95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pwhof"/&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early wrestling career===
Toots Mondt made his wrestling debut in Greeley in 1912 at the age of 18 in a carnival/wrestling style match, a match he would wrestle in for many years.&lt;ref name ="WP"/&gt; [[Stu Hart]] claimed he ran into Toots by chance while wrestling in New York City and that Mondt said he received his first wrestling lesson in 1916 from [[Jack Taylor (wrestler)|Jack Taylor]], and Mondt tried to recruit Hart into a territory in Washington D.C.&lt;!-- This was from Diana Hart's book Under The Mat, which had many historical inaccuracies, but I thought it would be useful nonetheless. I did not know how to reference the book, so if someone could do that, that would help.--&gt;  Around this time, he also tried his hand at acrobatics. However, this was an unsuccessful move and Toots returned to wrestling matches. Toots received his big break when he was discovered by wrestling pioneer [[Farmer Burns]] during one of his scouting trips. The nickname ‘Toots’, had to do with either his small feet or his relative youth and [[wikt:babyface|baby face]]. Mondt was the youngest wrestler in Farmer Burns' camp.

===Gold Dust Trio===
{{Main|Gold Dust Trio}}
Until 1919, wrestling matches were slow-moving exhibitions mainly confined to the mat and lasting on an average 60 minutes. Crowds no longer found this to be suitable entertainment and accordingly, they began to dwindle. Wrestling matches slowly and eventually became pre-determined. Toots Mondt joined the camp of [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed "Strangler" Lewis]] with the recommendation of Farmer Burns. Toots served in many capacities as a sparring partner, trainer, sometimes as an opponent and as a police officer. As a sparring partner and trainer, Toots Mondt helped Ed Lewis develop new holds and counters. The working relationship and unity amongst wrestling promoters was beginning to wear thin and crowd attendance was still low. Toots conceived a solution and combined features of a boxing ring, Greco-Roman, freestyle wrestling, and the old-time lumber-camp style of fighting. Toots had called it ’Slam Bang Western Style Wrestling’.

Toots Mondt's second plan was to promote this new style of wrestling on a much higher scale.  Toots convinced Ed Lewis and his manager Billy Sandow of forming their own promotion as opposed to having different promoters controlling them. The team of Mondt, Lewis and Sandow used their connections to convince many other wrestlers to sign up. Under the control of Mondt, Lewis and Sandow, they served as bookers and agents. Toots also instituted time limits as wrestling matches would often go three or four hours. Within six months, the "Gold Dust Trio" controlled the course of professional wrestling in North America. Their product was moved out from venues such as burlesque theaters and back alley halls to the major sports venue in each city. All new talent was tested in Billy Sandow's private ring while routines and finishes were carefully determined by Toots. The Gold Dust Trio later dissolved from a power struggle between Toots Mondt &amp; Billy Sandow's brother Max.

Mondt then formed a partnership with Philadelphia promoter, Ray Fabiani. The new combination wasted little time and found their new title holder in Dick Shickat, a former circus strongman from Germany. Once Dick Shickat's title reign had run its course, Mondt and Fabiani made [[Jim Londos]] their new champion and continued their hold on the Northeast. They soon expanded onto New York City, Hartford, Baltimore, and Washington DC. Toots/Fabiani were unsuccessful because rival New York promoter Jack Curley prevented them from promoting in NYC for years, and it was during this time that he came around an up-and-coming [[Lou Thesz]], with whom Mondt had a bad history. As Jack Curley was on his deathbed, Toots realized that New York wrestling would fall apart. So Toots &amp; Fabiani immediately formed an alliance with fellow booking heavyweight Rudy Dusek. This formation to take over New York was kept a secret. At Curley's funeral, one of his sons approached Toots about taking over New York and was not aware that Toots had a plan. Toots also gained help from other bookers such as [[Jack Pfeffer]], the Johnston Brothers and [[Jess McMahon]]. Jess McMahon worked for boxing promoter and [[New York Rangers]] hockey franchise founder [[Tex Rickard]], who despised wrestling, preventing bookings in [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] (MSG) from 1939 to 1948. Toots found former wrestler turned millionaire Bernarr McFadden, who gave Toots the financial backings.

Bernarr McFadden helped Toots promote in NYC and gain access into Madison Square Garden. In 1948, in the main event of the first card held in MSG for 9 years, [[Gorgeous George]] defeated Ernie Dusek. In that same year Toots Mondt was in search for another champion. After several failed attempts, Toots Mondt found Antonino Rocca, who brought in more Latino fans to the matches which financially favored Toots. Mondt, however, was not able to keep Rocca happy and [[Vince McMahon Sr.]] was brought into the scene by Ray Fabiani.

===Birth of the World Wide Wrestling Federation===
In 1963, Toots Mondt and Vince McMahon Sr. broke away from the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA), renaming [[Capitol Wrestling Corporation]] to the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF).  Toots Mondt parted ways with NWA President [[Sam Muchnick]] on good terms so that the WWWF would not be seen as an enemy. Toots and Vince were also in the middle of fighting off an invasion by [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] from promoting in the WWWF territories.

When [["Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers|Buddy Rogers]] was crowned NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Toots controlled the bookings for Rogers’ title defenses. Toots would rarely allow Buddy Rogers to defend the title outside the Northeastern region. This would be one of the factors which led to the World Wide Wrestling Federation splitting from the NWA. In April 1963, Buddy Rogers was awarded the WWWF World Heavyweight title, supposedly for winning a  tournament for the title in [[Rio de Janeiro]], a fictitious storyline created by Toots Mondt. In 1965, Toots Mondt stepped down as promoter at Madison Square Garden and Vince McMahon, Sr. took over. When [[Bruno Sammartino]] was brought into the WWWF, Vince Sr. predicted that he would be a midcarder for two or three years at best. Toots called Sammartino the future of the company because people instantly liked and responded to him. Toots convinced Vince McMahon Sr. to build the company around Bruno Sammartino. In a June 2012 Wrestling Observer Radio podcast, Bruno acknowledged that Mondt and Vince McMahon Sr. were not on the best of terms during his tenure with the company, with Bruno suggesting it was due to the fallout over the promotion's handling of Buddy Rogers.

Changing times and the rise of television saw Mondt's influence in the sport diminishing. Mondt was an arena booker and was never able to get a handle on [[television]] like McMahon. That fact coupled with Mondt's gambling problems allowed his business-minded partner to muscle him out of ownership of the New York territory. Toots sold off his share to McMahon in the mid-60s. McMahon reduced Mondt to salaried employee for Capital. Mondt died nearly penniless on June 11, 1976 at the age of 82 after a long battle with an illness.&lt;ref name="OW"/&gt; Since then, he has been inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996, the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2008 and the WWE Hall of Fame in 2017 as a recipient of its Legacy Award.

'''Tsagaan Khas''' ({{lang-mn|Цагаан Хас}}; meaning ''white [[swastika]]'') or '''Dayar Mongol''' is a [[Mongolia]]n [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] organisation that claims to have 3,000 members,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/169640/mongolski-neonacisti-hajluju-proti-cine/ Mongolskí neonacisti hajlujú proti Číne]&lt;/ref&gt; though other sources claim the organisation to have "more than 100 members".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2734/Foto/photoalbum/detail/3474149/452706/0/Mongoolse-neonazi-s-van-China-haters-tot-milieufanatici.dhtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715235344/http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2734/Foto/photoalbum/detail/3474149/452706/0/Mongoolse-neonazi-s-van-China-haters-tot-milieufanatici.dhtml |archivedate=2013-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by Ariunbold Altankhuum.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt; Its co-founder, who goes by the alias "1984 Big Brother", has described his group's mission thus: "[[Adolf Hitler]] was someone we respect. He taught us how to preserve national identity .... We don't agree with his extremism and starting the [[World War II|Second World War]]. We are against all those killings, but we support his ideology. We support [[nationalism]] rather than [[fascism]]." The group's members dress in typical Nazi attire and make use of the "[[sieg heil]]" greeting, [[Nazi Party#Party symbols|Nazi colors]], and the [[Coat of arms of Germany#Nazi Germany|Nazi eagle]]. They have justified their use of Nazi imagery by pointing out that the [[swastika]] has Asian origins.&lt;ref name="tsagaan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/02/mongolia-far-right|title=Mongolian neo-Nazis: Anti-Chinese sentiment fuels rise of ultra-nationalism|accessdate=August 22, 2010|date=August 2, 2010|publisher=Guardian|first=Tania|last=Branigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1984 Big Brother has claimed that the group does not promote crime and that it expels "criminal elements" from its membership, as well as requiring all members to have a good education. One of the group's leaders is an interior designer. He has also claimed that the group works closely with other [[Ultra-nationalism|ultra-nationalist]] groups in the [[Republic of Mongolia]].&lt;ref name="tsagaan" /&gt;

The group's members are characterized by their extreme [[anti-Chinese sentiment]] and opposition to [[interracial marriage]]. One follower of the group has expressed the view that, "We have to make sure that as a [[Mongolia|nation]] our blood is pure. That's about our independence... If we start mixing with Chinese, they will slowly swallow us up. Mongolian society is not very rich. Foreigners come with a lot of money and might start taking our women." The group has been accused of promoting violence against interracial couples and others.&lt;ref name="tsagaan" /&gt;

'''''Urban Legends: Final Cut''''' is a 2000 American [[slasher film]] directed by [[John Ottman]], in his directorial debut, and starring [[Jennifer Morrison]], [[Matthew Davis]], [[Hart Bochner]], [[Joey Lawrence|Joseph Lawrence]], [[Anthony Anderson]], and [[Loretta Devine]]. In addition to directing, Ottman also edited the film and composed its score. The [[sequel]] to the 1998 film ''[[Urban Legend (film)|Urban Legend]]'', its plot follows a film student who finds herself at the center of [[serial killer|serial killings]] occurring on her university campus shortly after she begins making a [[thesis]] film about [[urban legend]]s.

Filmed in late 1999, ''Urban Legends: Final Cut'' was released in the United States in September 2000, distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]].

== Plot ==
Amy Mayfield, a student at a prestigious film school, is unsure about what her thesis film is going to be. But after a conversation with security guard Reese Wilson about her experience with [[Urban Legend (film)|a series of murders that had happened on the campus she had previously worked in]], she is inspired to make a film about a serial killer murdering in the fashion of urban legends. Meanwhile, fellow student Lisa has a drink with classmate Travis at a bar before her scheduled flight out of town. While leaving the bar, she begins to feel dazed, and is attacked and abducted in the coat room. She wakes up in a bathtub filled with ice and discovers that her kidney has been removed. Attacked by her abductor, she tries to flee through the window, but is decapitated in the process. 

The next day, Amy is preparing the shooting of her thesis film but is deserted by the assigned camera man, Toby, who accuses Amy of stealing his thesis idea. Shooting begins with another camera man, Simon. When Sandra, Amy's actress friend who played a victim in a scene, returns to an empty studio after forgetting her keys, she is attacked and slashed to death with a straight razor. Her peers witness her [[snuff film|filmed death]] when the material is smuggled into a sequence of takes of the scene. Amy is disturbed by the footage, and is unable to figure out who shot it; her peers, however, discount it as a piece of a [[showreel]]. Sandra's absence is unnoticed, as she was supposed to leave for an audition in [[Los Angeles]] for a bit part on ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' the following day.

Travis commits suicide in the campus tower, apparently spurred by a poor grade received on his thesis film which disqualified him from receiving the university's [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock Award]]. At his funeral, the arrogant Graham, the son of a Hollywood director, offers to help Amy with her film; she declines, after which he discloses to her that he is aware of her background{{spaced en dash}}her father was a famous documentarian, a fact she has kept hidden from most of their peers. After the funeral, Amy meets Travis's twin brother, Trevor, who explains to her that he believes his brother was murdered. Later, while Amy is recording [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|audio loops]] of screams for the film, Simon is beaten to death outside, and the audio of his death is inadvertently recorded. While going over the loops, Amy is attacked by the killer, donning a [[fencing]] mask. She is chased through the campus, but manages to evade him.

Before filming another scene for Amy's film in an empty carnival ride, sophomores Stan and Dirk are attacked and electrocuted while preparing the set. Amy discovers the corpses and is again confronted by the killer. She escapes again and informs the police, who attribute the deaths to accidental electrocution. Amy is comforted by Trevor. They begin having sex when Trevor suddenly stabs Amy. She wakes up and realizes that it was only a dream. Amy later notices a light inside the bell tower. She goes there and finds her friend, Vanessa waiting for her. Vanessa, a [[lesbian]], presents a note she received addressed to her from Amy, in which it states that she has romantic feelings for Vanessa. Amy explains that she did not write the note, and fears that both women have been lured there. They are startled by the killer; Amy presses a [[panic button]] in the tower, but the killer manages to pursue them to the top of the tower. Once at the top, Amy is locked in a closet by the killer, where she finds the corpses of Simon and Sandra. Upon breaking free, she finds Vanessa hanging from the bell. Amy runs outside out of the tower passing Reese, who was notified of the disturbance via the campus security system.

Amy runs into the arms of Trevor. Later, he tells her he has found that all the murder victims worked on Travis's thesis film. After watching some of Travis's film, ''The Gods of Men'', they suspect Toby, the only person who worked on the film who is still alive. They kidnap Toby and call in Professor Solomon to an empty film set to present their suspicions. However, Toby reveals that Travis faked Toby's sound credit to help him graduate, admitting that he never went anywhere near Travis's film. Graham happens upon the confrontation, watching from a window. In the confusion, Solomon reveals himself as the killer, attempting to frame Amy and usurp the Hitchcock Award{{spaced en dash}}which includes a large [[stipend]]{{spaced en dash}}by presenting Travis's film as his own. A melee ensues in which Amy wrestles his gun from him and holds him at gunpoint. Reese stumbles upon the scene, and a standoff occurs. Solomon leaps at Amy, and she discharges the gun in his abdomen.

At the Hitchcock Awards ceremony, Trevor attends to accept the award on his brother's behalf. As he goes onstage, a sniper appears in the rafters, only to be shot by Reese. The altercation is revealed to be a scene in Amy's new film, ''Urban Legends'', on which Toby and Graham are working on her behalf. 

Later, Solomon, now wheelchair-bound, is in a mental institution where, after watching Amy's film, a nurse asks him if he enjoyed the movie. He is wheeled out by the nurse{{spaced en dash}}Brenda Bates, from the original film{{spaced en dash}}who tells him that they have a lot in common.

==Production==
===Conception===
The screenplay for ''Urban Legends: Final Cut'' was written by [[Paul Harris Boardman]] and [[Scott Derrickson]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Ottman sought a "wacky" tone for the film that was more [[tongue-in-cheek]] than that of its predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:06:45)&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Casting===
Anson Mount originally auditioned for the dual role of Travis / Trevor Stark, but had wanted to play the role of the antagonistic Toby instead; according to Ottman, he "aced" his audition for Toby, and was cast in the role.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:05:55–00:06:05)&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Davis auditioned for the role of Travis / Trevor, and was cast, marking his first major film role.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:26:45)&lt;/ref&gt; Eva Mendes was cast in the role of Vanessa, which had originally been a smaller role, but was expanded to allow her character to be a potential [[red herring]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:44:08)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Night at Trent University (2123924372).jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|Exterior sequences took place at [[Trent University]] in Peterborough, Ontario]]
Principal photography took place in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:1:43)&lt;/ref&gt; over a period of 47 days&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:10:48)&lt;/ref&gt; in the fall of 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:09:15)&lt;/ref&gt;  The film's opening sequence on the airplane, which was shot over a period of three days,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:02:33)&lt;/ref&gt; was originally written to have occurred on a boat; however, the script was altered last-minute after the production crew came across an airplane set from the film ''[[Pushing Tin]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name=tin&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:1:40)&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the film's low budget, director Ottman chose to make use of the set, and staged the sequence on a plane instead.&lt;ref name=tin/&gt;

The university exteriors featured in the film is [[Trent University]] in [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]], Ontario, which Ottman chose due to its "modern" and institutional architecture as opposed to [[Collegiate Gothic|Gothic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:06:58)&lt;/ref&gt; The bell tower, however, was constructed solely for the film, for $150,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:07:19)&lt;/ref&gt; Interior sequences, however, were filmed in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:07:55)&lt;/ref&gt; The amusement park [[Ontario Place (theme park)|Ontario Place]] served as the filming location for the mining amusement ride sequence; the mine ride featured in the film was in fact a [[log flume (ride)|log ride]] that had been drained of its water for the impending winter months, which was re-dressed to appear as a mine-themed ride.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (1:00:45)&lt;/ref&gt; Ottman stated that many of the lighting techniques featured in the film{{spaced en dash}}particularly the use of strobe lighting{{spaced en dash}}were inspired by [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) and [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (1:04:09)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-production====
The sequence featuring Lisa and Trevor at the bar (followed by her death scene) was written and shot in [[Los Angeles]] after principal photography had finished, as the film's producers felt the film needed a death sequence earlier on to establish a sense of danger.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:13:40)&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the production crew intended to make a fake [[kidney]] for the sequence (as the character awakens to find her kidney has been removed), but due to budget and time restraints, opted to use a [[goat]]'s kidney from a butcher shop.&lt;ref name=kidney&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:17:44)&lt;/ref&gt; Because a goat kidney is anatomically larger than that of a human, it had to be truncated to reduce its size.&lt;ref name=kidney/&gt;

Director Ottman also edited the film, and remarked in the [[audio commentary]] on the film's 2001 DVD release that many character interaction sequences were truncated or excised entirely to maintain a quicker pace.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:35:37)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intertextuality==
===Cinematic allusions===
With the plot centered on a group of film school students, ''Urban Legends: Final Cut'' uses a [[Self-reference|self-reflexive]] narrative approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Austin Chronicle|title=Urban Legends: Final Cut|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/2000-09-22/urban-legends-final-cut/|author=Savlov, Marc|date=September 22, 2000|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and features numerous references and [[allusion]]s to cinema and other horror films.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:01:28)&lt;/ref&gt; The opening sequence on the airplane was inspired by the ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Nightmare at 20,000 Feet]]" (1963).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottman|Ottman 2001]] (0:02:08)&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa's abduction sequence in which she is incapacitated with a plastic garment bag in a coat closet is an homage to ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (1974).{{efn-lr|The character of Lisa is attacked with a plastic garment bag and suffocated until unconscious in the film's first murder scene. Similarly, the first murder sequence in [[Bob Clark]]'s ''Black Christmas'' (1974) features an identical death in a closet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gasdetection.com/MDS/m100200.html|work=Interscan Corporation|series=Mike's Comment of the Week|date=October 2, 2000|accessdate=April 30, 2018|title=Urban Legends: Final Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Film scholar Jim Harper, in his book ''Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movies'' (2004), cites ''Urban Legends: Final Cut'' as a "post ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' slasher" influenced by Italian ''[[giallo]]'' films, featuring a "distinct [[Dario Argento|Argento]] influence" present in the film, particularly in its killer's attire.{{sfn|Harper|2004|p=10}} Harper also notes direct references in the film to the work of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] as well as [[Michael Powell]]'s ''[[Peeping Tom (film)|Peeping Tom]]'' (1960), which is paid homage in Sandra's filmed murder scene.{{sfn|Harper|2004|pages=181–82}}

=== Urban legends ===
The following urban legends are mentioned or depicted in the film:
* Lisa is drugged at a bar and wakes up in a bath tub of ice, her kidney being removed.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Comingsoon.net]]|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/770795-scott-derrickson-movies|title=Scott Derrickson Movies Spotlight|author=Wax, Alyse|date=September 30, 2016|accessdate=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Amy recounts a legend about students screaming at midnight to relieve tension, causing a brutal assault to go unnoticed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/mayhem/scream.asp | title=Scream Session Rape | work=Snopes.com | accessdate=July 9, 2016 | author=Mikkelson, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is later re-enacted in Simon's death.
* Sandra tells of a burrito contaminated with roach eggs, which then hatch inside a girl's nose&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/insects/cockroacheggs.asp | title=Cockroach Eggs | work=Snopes.com | accessdate=July 9, 2016 | author=Mikkelson, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of a chicken sandwich containing pus from the chicken's tumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/food/tumor.asp | title=Mayo Cynic | work=Snopes.com | accessdate=July 9, 2016 | author=Mikkelson, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vanessa warns Travis that cell phones cause cancer.
* The first scene of Amy's film has a girl discovering the corpse of her dog, who supposedly [[The Licked Hand|licked her hand]] at night, in the shower, with the message "Humans can lick too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/lighton.asp | title=Aren't You Glad You Didn't Turn on the Light? | work=Snopes.com | accessdate=July 9, 2016 | author=Mikkelson, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The basis for one of the scenes in Amy's film is a carnival displaying fake corpses in a "Tunnel of Terror". As the carnival moves on, several children are missing and the fake corpses are revealed to be real.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;
* Sandra is filmed murdered on camera. Her friends think it is a fake murder because there is no body, but it is actually real and filmed in the same fashion as a "[[snuff film]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/snuff.asp | title=A Pinch of Snuff | work=Snopes.com | accessdate=July 9, 2016 | author=Mikkelson, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
=== Box office ===
The film brought in $21,468,807 in the United States and brought in $17,105,555 overseas, bringing its total box office revenue to $38,574,362. The film was considered a moderate success, due to the budget of the film being $14,000,000. However, the film only grossed about half of what the first film brought in ($72,000,000).&lt;ref name="Box Office Mojo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Urban Legends: Final Cut|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=urbanlegendsfinalcut.htm|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical response ===
Dave Kehr of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote of the film: "[Director] Ottman doesn't have the firm grasp of tone necessary to make his deliberate ambiguities seem other than simple confusion, nor the sense of humor necessary to turn the deliberate cliches into effective satire. "&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|work=The New York Times|date=September 22, 2000|accessdate=April 30, 2018|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/22/movies/film-in-review-urban-legends-final-cut.html|title=FILM IN REVIEW; 'Urban Legends' Final Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Koehler of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' criticized the film's screenplay for being "[too] stuffed with movie references and jokes," and that it "slavishly follows in lock-step with the prior film's ''[[Ten Little Indians (novel)|Ten Little Indians]]''-like plot line."&lt;ref name=koehler&gt;{{cite web|work=Variety|author=Koehler, Robert|date=September 22, 2000|accessdate=April 30, 2018|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/reviews/urban-legends-final-cut-1200464148/|title=Urban Legends: Final Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', David Chute wrote: "The coolest single element in the walk-don't-run horror sequel ''Urban Legends: Final Cut'' may be its atmospheric setting...[the] concept seems tailor-made for that kind of ingenuity, for a little bit of sly wit and playfulness. Movies like ''Final Cut'' are bunker-mentality productions, safe, square and purely functional, like buildings made from poured concrete."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/22/entertainment/ca-24782|author=Chute, David|date=September 22, 2000|accessdate=April 30, 2018|title='Final Cut' Isn't Last Word in Stalker Films}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] awarded it 2 stars out of 4, declaring that the movie "makes the fatal mistake...of believing there is still life in the wheezy serial-killer-on-campus formula," although he did concede that the production credits were "slick" and the performances "quite adequate given the (narrow) opportunities of the genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/urban-legends-final-cut-2000| title=Urban Legends: Final Cut Movie Review| author=Ebert, Roger| work=Chicago Sun-Times| date =September 22, 2000|access-date=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Thomson of The [[BBC]] echoed this in a review by Michael Thomson, who thought that the [[meta]] in-jokes of the murder scenes did not work and that the film "keeps the mediocrity [of the first film] alive as it unleashes yet more unsavoury nonsense."&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2000/11/30/urban_legends2_2000_review.shtml| title=Urban Legends: Final Cut (2000)| author=Thomson, Michael| work=BBC| date=November 30, 2000| access-date=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Nathan Rabin echoed similar sentiments, writing: "A sequel with the misguided chutzpah to rip off its derivative predecessor, ''Final Cut'' proves once again that the self-referential slasher film is every bit as tiresome and devoid of new ideas as the unironic bloodbaths that inspired it in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=September 22, 2000|accessdate=April 30, 2018|title=Urban Legend 2: Final Cut|url=https://film.avclub.com/urban-legend-2-final-cut-1798192483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meta-critic site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] lists the film as having an approval rating of 9% among critics based on 80 reviews, with 7 fresh and 73 rotten reviews, giving it an average rating of 3/10. The site's consensus is: "This teen horror movie brings nothing new to an already exhausted genre.  And it's bad.  Really bad".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/urban_legends_final_cut/ Urban Legends: Final Cut (2000)] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]], retrieved 6 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "D+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt; {{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49771">In [[syntax]], '''verb-second (V2) word order''' places the [[finite verb]] of a clause or sentence in second position with a single major [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] preceding it, which functions as the clause topic.&lt;ref&gt;For discussions of the V2 principle, see Borsley (1996:220f.), Ouhalla (1994:284ff.), Fromkin et al. (2000:341ff.), Adger (2003:329ff.), Carnie (2007:281f.).&lt;/ref&gt;

V2 [[word order]] is common in the [[Germanic languages]] and is also found in Indo-Aryan [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], Northeast Caucasian [[Ingush language|Ingush]], Uto-Aztecan [[O'odham language|O'odham]], and fragmentarily in Rhaeto-Romansh [[Sursilvan]]. Of the Germanic family, English is exceptional in having predominantly [[Subject–verb–object|SVO order]] instead of V2, although there are vestiges of the V2 phenomenon.

Most Germanic languages do not normally use V2 order in embedded clauses, with a few exceptions. In particular, German, Dutch, and Afrikaans revert to VF (verb final) word order after a [[complementizer]]; Yiddish and Icelandic do, though, allow V2 in all declarative clauses: main, embedded, and subordinate. Kashmiri has V2 in 'declarative content clauses' but VF order in relative clauses.

==Examples==
The following examples from German illustrate the V2 principle:

:{|cellspacing="8"
||a.||Die Kinder||'''spielten'''||vor der Schule||im Park||Fußball.
|-
||||the kids||played||before school||in the park||football.
|-
||
|-
||b.||Fußball||'''spielten'''||die Kinder||vor der Schule||im Park.
|-
||
|colspan=5|'Football played the kids before school in the park.'
|-
||c.||Vor der Schule||'''spielten'''||die Kinder||im Park||Fußball.
|-
||
|colspan=5|'Before school, played the kids in the park football.'
|-
||d.||Im Park||'''spielten'''||die Kinder||vor der Schule||Fußball.
|-
||
|colspan=5|'In the park, played the kids before school football.'
|-
||
|-
||e.|| *Vor der Schule||Fußball||'''spielten'''||die Kinder||im Park.
|-
||
|colspan=5|'Before school football played the kids in the park.'
|-
||f.|| *Fußball||die Kinder||'''spielten'''||vor der Schule||im Park.
|-
||
|colspan=5|'Football the kids played before school in the park.'
|-
|}

(The [[Asterisk#Grammaticality asterisk|asterisk *]] indicates that the example is [[Grammaticality|grammatically unacceptable]].) Sentences a–d have the finite verb ''spielten'' in second position, with varying major constituents in first position. Sentences e and f sentences are unacceptable because the finite verb no longer appears in second position. V2 word order allows any major constituent to occupy the first position as long as the second position is occupied by the finite verb.

==Non-finite verbs and embedded clauses==

===Non-finite verbs===
The V2 principle regulates the position of finite verbs only; its influence on [[non-finite verb]]s (infinitives, participles, etc.) is indirect. Non-finite verbs in V2 languages appear in varying positions depending on the language. In German and Dutch, for instance, non-finite verbs appear after the object (if one is present) in clause final position in main clauses (OV order). Swedish and Icelandic, in contrast, position non-finite verbs after the finite verb but before the object (if one is present) (VO order). That is, V2 operates only on the finite verb.

===Embedded clauses===

(In the following examples, finite verb forms are in '''bold''', non-finite verb forms are in ''italics'' and subjects are &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt;.)

Germanic languages vary in the application of V2 order in embedded clauses. They fall into three groups.

====Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Faroese====

In these languages, the word order of clauses is generally fixed in two patterns of conventionally numbered positions.&lt;ref&gt;The examples are discussed in König and van der Auwera (1994) in the chapters devoted to each language.&lt;/ref&gt; Both end with positions for (5) non-finite verb forms, (6) objects (7), adverbials. &lt;br /&gt;
'''In main clauses''', the V2 constraint holds. The finite verb must be in position (2) and '''sentence adverbs''' in position (4). The latter include words with meanings such as 'not' and 'always'. The subject may be position (1), but when a topical expression occupies the position, the subject is in position (3).&lt;br /&gt; 
'''In embedded clauses''', the V2 constraint is absent. After the conjunction, the subject must immediately follow; it cannot be replaced by a topical expression. Thus, the first four positions are in the fixed order (1) conjunction, (2) subject, (3) sentence adverb, (4) finite verb

The position of the sentence adverbs is important to those theorists who see them as marking the start of a large [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] within the clause. Thus the finite verb is seen as inside that constituent in embedded clauses, but outside that constituent in V2 main clauses.

====German, Dutch, and Afrikaans====
In these languages there is a strong tendency to place some or all of the verb forms in final position.

'''In main clauses''', the V2 constraint holds. As with other Germanic languages, the finite verb must be in the second position. However, any non-finite forms must be in final position. The subject may be in the first position, but when a topical expression occupies the position, the subject follows the finite verb.

'''In embedded clauses''', the V2 constraint does not hold. The finite verb form must be adjacent to any non-finite at the end of the clause, with different word-order in different languages.

German grammarians traditionally divide sentences into '''fields'''. Subordinate clauses preceding the main clause are said to be in the '''first field''' (Vorfeld), clauses following the main clause in the '''final field''' (Nachfeld). &lt;br /&gt;
The '''central field''' (Mittelfeld ) contains most or all of a clause, and is bounded by '''left bracket''' (Linke Satzklammer) and '''right bracket''' (Rechte Satzklammer) positions.

'''In main clauses''', the initial element (subject or topical expression) is said to be located in the first field, the V2 finite verb form in the left bracket, and any non-finite verb forms in the right bracket.&lt;br /&gt;'''In embedded clauses''', the conjunction is said to be located in the left bracket, and the verb forms in the right bracket. In German embedded clauses, a finite verb form follows any non-finite forms.

'''German'''&lt;ref&gt;These and other examples are discussed in Fagan (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

This analysis suggests a close parallel between the V2 finite form in main clauses and the conjunctions in embedded clauses. Each is seen as an introduction to its clause-type, a function which some modern scholars have equated with the notion of [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]]. The analysis is supported in spoken Dutch by the placement of [[clitic pronoun]] subjects. Forms such as '''ie''' cannot stand alone, unlike the full-form equivalent '''hij'''. The words to which they may be attached are those same introduction words: the V2 form in a main clause, or the conjunction in an embedded clause.&lt;ref&gt;Zwart (2011) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Equivalent rules also exist in vernacular German, for example regarding the reduced pronunciation of ''[[wikt:du|du]]'' ("you"). Hence, this pronoun may be pronounced {{IPA|[də]}} or {{IPA|[ə]}} following verbs and conjunctions, but not otherwise.

Dutch differs from German in its word order in subordinate clauses. In Dutch subordinate clauses two word orders are possible for the verb clusters and are referred to as the "red": ''omdat ik heb gewerkt'', "because I have worked": like in English, where the auxiliary verb precedes the past particle, and the "green": ''omdat ik gewerkt heb,'' where the past particle precedes the auxiliary verb, "because I worked have": like in German.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_han001200701_01/_han001200701_01_0019.php&lt;/ref&gt; In Dutch, the green word order is the most used in speech, and the red is the most used in writing, particularly in journalistic texts, but the green is also used in writing as is the red in speech. Unlike in English however adjectives and adverbs must precede the verb: &lt;nowiki&gt;''dat het boek groen is''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, "that the book green is".

====Icelandic and Yiddish====
These languages freely allow V2 order in embedded clauses. 

'''Icelandic'''
&lt;br /&gt;Two word-order patterns are largely similar to continental Scandinavian. However, in main clauses an extra slot is needed for when the front position is occupied by '''Það'''. In these clauses the subject follows any sentence adverbs. In embedded clauses, sentence adverbs follow the finite verb (an optional order in Faroese).&lt;ref&gt;See Thráinsson (2007) p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|}
In more radical contrast with other Germanic languages, a third pattern exists for embedded clauses with the conjunction followed by the V2 order: front-finite verb-subject.&lt;ref&gt;Examples from Fischer et al (2000) p.112&lt;/ref&gt;

|||||||'''Conjunction'''||'''Front&lt;br /&gt;(Topic adverbial)'''||'''Finite verb'''||'''Subject'''

'''Yiddish'''&lt;br /&gt;

===Root clauses===
One type of embedded clause with V2 following the conjunction is found throughout the Germanic languages, although it is more common in some than it is others. These are termed '''root clauses'''. They are [[declarative content clause]]s, the [[direct object]]s of so-called '''bridge verbs''', which are understood to quote a statement. For that reason, they exhibit the V2 word order of the equivalent direct quotation.

'''Danish'''&lt;br /&gt;
Items other than the subject are allowed to appear in front position.

==V2 in English==

Modern English differs greatly in word order from other modern Germanic languages, but earlier English shared many similarities. Some scholars therefore propose a description of Old English with V2 constraint as the norm. The history of English syntax is thus seen as a process of losing the constraint.&lt;ref&gt;See Fischer et al. (2000: 114ff.) for discussion of these and other examples from Old English and Middle English.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old English===
In these examples, finite verb forms are in '''bold''', non-finite verb forms are in ''italics'' and subjects are &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt;.

====Main clauses====
'''Subject first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"
||a.||&lt;u&gt;Se&lt;/u&gt;||&lt;u&gt;mæssepreost&lt;/u&gt;||'''sceal'''||manum||''bodian''||þone||soþan||geleafan||
|-
|||the||masspriest||must||people||preach||the||true||faith||....||'The mass priest must preach the true faith to the people.'
|-
|}
'''Question word first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"
||b.||Hwi||'''wolde'''||&lt;u&gt;God&lt;/u&gt;||swa||lytles||þinges||him||''forwyrman''
|-
||||Why||would||God||so||small||thing||him||deny ||....||'Why would God deny him such a small thing?'
|-
|}
'''Topic phrase first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"
||c.||on||twam||þingum||'''hæfde'''||&lt;u&gt;God&lt;/u&gt;||þæs||mannes||sawle||''gedodod''
|-
||||in||two||things||had||God||the||man's||soul||endowed ||....||'With two things God had endowed man's soul.'
|-
|}
'''þa first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"
||c.||þa||'''wæs'''||&lt;u&gt;þæt&lt;/u&gt;||&lt;u&gt;folc&lt;/u&gt;||þæs||micclan||welan||ungemetlice||''brucende''
|-
||||then||was||the||people||of-the||great||prosperity||excessively||partaking||....||'Then the people were partaking excessively of the great prosperity.'
|-
|}
'''Negative word first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"
||d.||Ne||'''sceal'''||&lt;u&gt;he&lt;/u&gt;||naht||unaliefedes||''don''
|-
||||not||shall||he||nothing||unlawful||do||....||'He shall not do anything unlawful.'
|-
|}
'''Object first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"
||e.||Ðas||ðreo||ðing||'''forgifð'''||&lt;u&gt;God&lt;/u&gt;||his||gecorenum
|-
||||these||three||things||gives||God||his||chosen||....||'These three things God gives to his chosen.'
|-
|}

====Position of object====
In examples b, c and d, the [[Object (grammar)|object]] of the clause precedes a non-finite verb form. Superficially, the structure is verb-subject-object- verb. To capture generalities, scholars of [[syntax]] and [[linguistic typology]] treat them as basically [[subject-object-verb|subject-object-verb (SOV)]] structure, modified by the V2 constraint. Thus Old English is classified, to some extent, as an SOV language. However, example a represents a number of Old English clauses with object following a non-finite verb form, with the superficial structure verb-subject-verb object. A more substantial number of clauses contain a single finite verb form followed by an object, superficially verb-subject-object. Again, a generalisation is captured by describing these as [[Subject–verb–object|subject–verb–object (SVO)]] modified by V2. Thus Old English can be described as intermediate between SOV languages (like German and Dutch) and SVO languages (like Swedish and Icelandic).

====Effect of subject pronouns====
When the subject of a clause was a personal pronoun, V2 did not always operate.
:{|cellspacing="8"
||f.||forðon||&lt;u&gt;we&lt;/u&gt;||'''sceolan'''||mid||ealle||mod||&amp;||mægene||to||Gode||''gecyrran''
|-
||||therefore||we||must||with||all||mind||and||power||to||God||turn||....||'Therefore we must turn to God with all our mind and power.'
|-
|}
However, V2 verb-subject inversion occurred without exception after a question word or the negative '''ne''', and with few exceptions after '''þa''' even with pronominal subjects.
:{|cellspacing="8"
||g.||for ||hwam||'''noldest'''||&lt;u&gt;þu&lt;/u&gt;||ðe sylfe||me||''gecgyðan''||þæt...
|-
||||for||what||not-wanted||you||yourself||me||make-known||that..||....||'wherefore would you not want to make known to me yourself that...'
|-
|}
:{|cellspacing="8"
||h.||Ne||'''sceal'''||&lt;u&gt;he&lt;/u&gt;||naht||unaliefedes ||''don''
|-
||||not||shall||he||nothing||unlawful ||do||....||'He shall not do anything unlawful.'
|-
|}
:{|cellspacing="8"
||i.||þa||'''foron'''||&lt;u&gt;hie&lt;/u&gt;||mid||þrim||scipum||ut
|-
||||then||sailed||they||with||three||ships||out||....||'Then they sailed out with three ships.'
|-
|}
Inversion of a subject pronoun also occurred regularly after a direct quotation.&lt;ref&gt;Harbert (2007) p. 414&lt;/ref&gt;
:{|cellspacing="8"
||j.||"Me ||'''is''',"||'''cwæð'''||&lt;u&gt;hēo&lt;/u&gt;,||"&lt;u&gt;Þīn&lt;/u&gt;||&lt;u&gt;cyme&lt;/u&gt;||on ||miclum||ðonce"
|-
||||to me||is||said||she||your||coming||in||much||thankfulness||....||'"Your coming," she said, " is very gratifying to me".'
|-
|}

====Embedded clauses====
Embedded clauses with pronoun subjects were not subject to V2. Even with noun subjects, V2 inversion did not occur.
:{|cellspacing="8"
||k.||...||þa ða||&lt;u&gt;his&lt;/u&gt;||&lt;u&gt;leorningcnichtas&lt;/u&gt;||hine||'''axodon'''||for||hwæs||synnum ||se||man||'''wurde'''||swa||blind||''acenned''
|-
||||...||when||his||disciples||him||asked||for||whose||sins||the||man||became||thus||blind||....||'... when his disciples asked him for whose sins the man was thus born blind'
|-
|}

====Yes-No questions====
In a similar clause pattern, the finite verb form of a [[yes-no question]] occupied the first position
:{|cellspacing="8"
||l.||'''Truwast'''||&lt;u&gt;ðu&lt;/u&gt;||nu||þe||selfum||and||þinum||geferum||bet||þonne||ðam||apostolum...?
|-
||||trust||you||now||you||self||and||your||companions||better||than||the||apostles||....||'Do you now trust yourself and your companions better than the apostles...?'
|-
|}

===Middle English===

====Continuity====
[[Early Middle English]] generally preserved V2 structure in clauses with nominal subjects.

'''Topic phrase first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"
||a.||On||þis||gær||'''wolde'''||&lt;u&gt;þe&lt;/u&gt;||&lt;u&gt;king&lt;/u&gt;||&lt;u&gt;Stephne&lt;/u&gt;||''tæcen''||Rodbert
|-
||||in||this||year||wanted||the||king||Stephen||seize||Robert||....||'During this year king Stephen wanted to seize Robert.' 
|-
|}
'''Nu first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"
||b.||Nu||'''loke'''||&lt;u&gt;euerich&lt;/u&gt;||&lt;u&gt;man&lt;/u&gt;||toward||himseluen
|-
||||now||look||every||man||to||himself||....||'Now it's for every man to look to himself.'
|-
|}

As in Old English, V2 inversion did not apply to clauses with pronoun subjects.

'''Topic phrase first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"

||c.||bi||þis||&lt;u&gt;ȝe&lt;/u&gt;||'''mahen'''||''seon''||ant||''witen''...
|-
||||by||this||you||may||see||and||know||
|-
|}
'''Object first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"

||d.||alle||ðese||bebodes||&lt;u&gt;ic&lt;/u&gt;||'''habbe'''||''ihealde''||fram||childhade
|-
||||all||these||commandments||I||have||kept||from||childhood
|-
|}

====Change====
[[Late Middle English]] texts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries show increasing incidence of clauses without the inversion associated with V2.

'''Topic adverb first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"

||e.||sothely||&lt;u&gt;se&lt;/u&gt;||&lt;u&gt;ryghtwyse&lt;/u&gt;||'''sekys'''||þe||Ioye||and ...
|-
||||Truly||the||righteous||seeks||the||joy||and...
|}
'''Topic phrase first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"

||f.||And||by||þis||same||skyle||&lt;u&gt;hop&lt;/u&gt;||&lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt;||&lt;u&gt;sore&lt;/u&gt;||'''shulle'''||''jugen''||us
|-
||||And||by||this||same||skill||hope||and||sorrow||shall||judge||us
|-
|}
Negative clauses were no longer formed with '''ne''' (or '''na''') as the first element. Inversion in negative clauses was attributable to other causes.

'''Wh- question word first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"

||g.||why||'''ordeyned'''||&lt;u&gt;God&lt;/u&gt;||not||such||ordre
|-
||||why||ordained||God||not||such an||order||....||'Why did God not ordain such an order?' ||&lt;small&gt;('''not''' follows noun phrase subject)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
||h.||why||'''shulde'''||&lt;u&gt;he&lt;/u&gt;||not ..
|-
||||Why||should||he||not... ||||||||||&lt;small&gt;('''not''' precedes pronoun subject)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|}
'''There first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"

||h.||Ther||'''nys'''||nat||&lt;u&gt;oon&lt;/u&gt;||kan||war||by||other||be
|-
||||there||not-is||not||one||can||aware||by||other||be||....||'There is not a single person who learns from the mistakes of others'
|}
'''Object first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"

||h.||&lt;u&gt;He&lt;/u&gt;||'''was'''||''despeyred'';||no thyng||'''dorste'''||&lt;u&gt;he&lt;/u&gt;||''seye''
|-
||||He||was||in despair;||nothing||dared||he||say
|}

===Vestiges of V2 in Modern English===

As in earlier periods, [[Modern English]] normally has subject-verb order in [[Declarative sentence|declarative clauses]] and [[Inversion (linguistics)|inverted]] verb-subject order&lt;ref&gt;Inversion is discussed in Peters (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Interrogative sentences|interrogative clauses]]. However these norms are observed irrespective of the number of clause elements preceding the verb. Moreover, it is not useful to characterize the verb form which undergoes inversion as 'the finite verb'.

====Classes of verbs in Modern English: auxiliary and lexical====
Inversion in Old English sentences with a combination of two verbs could be described in terms of their finite and non-finite forms. The word which participated in inversion was the finite verb; the verb which retained its position relative to the Object was the non-finite verb. In most types of Modern English clause, there are two verb forms, but the verbs are considered to belong to different syntactic classes. The verbs which participated in inversion have evolved to form a class of [[auxiliary verbs]] which may mark [[Tense–aspect–mood|tense, aspect and mood]]; the remaining majority of verbs with full [[Semantics|semantic]] value are said to constitute the class of [[lexical verb]]s. The exceptional type of clause is that of [[declarative sentence|declarative]] clause with a lexical verb in a [[Present simple]] or [[Past simple]] form.

====Questions====
Interrogative Wh- questions (like Yes/No questions) are regularly formed with [[Subject–auxiliary inversion|inversion of subject and auxiliary]]. Present Simple and Present Past questions are formed with the auxiliary '''do''', a process known as [[do support|do-support]]. 
:{|cellspacing="8"
||a. Which game '''is''' Sam ''watching''? 
|-
||b. Where '''does''' she ''live''?
|}
:::(see [[Subject–auxiliary inversion#In questions|subject-auxiliary inversion in questions]])

====With topic adverbs and adverbial phrases====
In certain patterns similar to Old and Middle English, inversion is possible. However, this is a matter of stylistic choice, unlike the constraint on interrogative clauses.

'''negative or restrictive adverbial first'''  
:{|cellspacing="8"

||c. At no point '''will''' he ''drink'' Schnapps.
|-
||d. No sooner '''had''' she ''arrived'' than she started to make demands.
|}
:::(see [[negative inversion]])
'''comparative adverb or adjective first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"

||e. So keenly '''did''' the children ''miss'' their parents, they cried themselves to sleep.
|-
||f. Such '''was''' their sadness, they could never enjoy going out.
|}
After the preceding classes of adverbial, only auxiliary verbs, not lexical verbs, participate in inversion

'''locative or temporal adverb first'''
:{|cellspacing="8"

||g. Here '''comes''' the bus.
|-
||h. Now '''is''' the hour when we must say goodbye.
|}
'''prepositional phrase first''' 
:{|cellspacing="8"
||i. Behind the goal '''sat''' many photographers. 
|-
||j. Down the road '''came''' the person we were waiting for.
|}
:::(see [[Subject-verb inversion#Locative inversion|locative inversion]], [[Subject-verb inversion#Directive inversion|directive inversion]])

After the two latter types of adverbial, only one-word lexical verb forms (Present Simple or Past Simple), not auxiliary verbs, participate in inversion, and only with noun-phrase subjects, not pronominal subjects.

====Direct quotations====
When the object of a verb is a verbatim quotation, it may precede the verb, with a result similar to Old English V2. Such clauses are found in storytelling and in news reports.
:{|cellspacing="8"
||k. "Wolf! Wolf!" '''cried''' the boy.
|-
||l. "The unrest is spreading throughout the country" '''writes''' our Jakarta correspondent.
|}
:::(see [[Subject-verb inversion#Quotative inversion|quotative inversion]])

====Declarative clauses without inversion====
Corresponding to the above examples, the following clauses show the normal Modern English subject-verb order.

'''Declarative equivalents'''
:{|cellspacing="8"

||a′. Sam '''is''' ''watching'' the Cup games.
|-
||b′. She '''lives''' in the country.
|}
'''Equivalents without topic fronting'''
:{|cellspacing="8"

|-
||c′. He '''will''' at no point ''drink'' Schnapps.
|-
||d′. She '''had''' no sooner ''arrived'' than she started to make demands.
|-
||e′. The children '''missed''' their parents so keenly that they cried themselves to sleep.
|-f′. Their sadness '''was''' such that they could never enjoy going out.
|-
||g′. The bus '''is''' ''coming'' here.
|-
||h′. The hour when we must say goodbye '''is''' now.
|-
||i′. Many photographers '''sat''' behind the goal.
|-
||j′. The person we were waiting for '''came''' down the road.
|-
||k′. The boy '''cried''' "Wolf! Wolf!"
|-
||l′. Our Jakarta correspondent '''writes''', "The unrest is spreading throughout the country" .
|}

==V2 in French==

Modern French is a [[Subject-Verb-Object]] (SVO) language like other [[Romance languages]] (though [[Latin]] was a [[Subject-Object-Verb]] language). However, V2 constructions existed in [[Old French]] and were more common than in other early Romance language texts. It has been suggested that this may be due to influence from the Germanic [[Frankish language]].&lt;ref&gt;see Rowlett (2007:4)&lt;/ref&gt; Modern French has vestiges of the V2 system similar to those found in modern English. 

The following sentences have been identified as possible examples of V2 syntax in Old French:&lt;ref&gt;see Posner (1996:248)&lt;/ref&gt;

:{|cellspacing="3"
||a. ||''&lt;small&gt;Old French&lt;/small&gt;''||Longetemps||'''fu'''||ly||roys||Elinas||en||la||montaigne
|-
||||''&lt;small&gt;Modern French&lt;/small&gt;''||Longtemps||fut||le||roi||Elinas||dans||la||montagne||....||'Pendant longtemps le roi Elinas a été dans les montagnes.'
|-
||||''&lt;small&gt;English&lt;/small&gt;''||For a long time||was||the||king||Elinas||in||the||mountain||...||'King Elinas was in the mountains for a long time.'
|-
|}
:{|cellspacing="1"
||b. ||''&lt;small&gt;Old French&lt;/small&gt;''||Iteuses||paroles||'''distrent'''||li||frere||de||Lancelot
|-
||||''&lt;small&gt;Modern French&lt;/small&gt;''||Telles||paroles||dirent||les||frères||de||Lancelot||....||'Les frères de Lancelot ont dit ces paroles'
|-
||||''&lt;small&gt;English&lt;/small&gt;''||Such||words||uttered||the||brothers||of||Lancelot||....||'Lancelot's brothers spoke these words.'
|-
|}
:{|cellspacing="1"
||c.|| ''&lt;small&gt;Old French&lt;/small&gt;''||Atant||'''regarda'''||contreval||la ||mer
|-
||||''&lt;small&gt;Modern French&lt;/small&gt;''||Alors||regarda||en bas||la||mer||....||'Alors Il a regardé la mer plus bas.' 
|-
||||''&lt;small&gt;English&lt;/small&gt;''||Then||looked at||downward||the||sea||....||'Then he looked down at the sea.' &lt;small&gt;(Elision of subject pronoun, contrary to the general rule in other Old French clause structures.)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|}

== Other V2 languages ==
===Kashmiri===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
As was first noted in 1914 by [[Jules Bloch]], V2 word order occurs outside of Germanic, in the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]].&lt;ref&gt;Jules Bloch, ''La formation de la langue marathe'' [''The Formation of the Marathi Language''], thesis, [1914/1920], Prix Volney.&lt;/ref&gt; Declarative main clauses as well as embedded object clauses in Kashmiri have V2 word order, but relative clauses have [[SOV word order|SOV]] order, e.g.

* Basic sentence
*:mye '''per''' yi kyitāb az.
*:I read this book today.
* With fronted adverb
*:az '''per''' mye yi kyitāb.
*:Today read I this book.
* Subordinate clause
*:mye von zyi mye '''per''' yi kyitāb az.
*:I said that I read this book today.
* Subordinate clause with fronted adverb
*:mye von zyi az '''per''' mye yi kyitāb.
*:I said that today read I this book.
* Relative clause
*:yi chi swa kyitāb ywas mye rāth '''per'''.
*:This is the book I yesterday read.
* Relative clause with embedded subordinate clause
*:yi chi swa kyitāb ywas mye az ''' veny''' zyi mye '''per''' rāth.
*:This is the book I today said that I read yesterday.

Kashmiri differs from the V2 languages of Europe in that in all clause types Kashmiri exhibits the characteristics of SOV languages. It has postpositions (not prepositions), objects before the main verb (not after - unless the main verb itself is in position 2), and auxiliaries after main verbs (unless the auxiliary itself is in position 2) [example from 'saaykal' by Ratan Lal Shant]:

:khaar '''oos''' rinyoomut Tyuub lemy-lemy Tayr-i manz-i nyebar keD-yith ''tshun-aan''.
:mechanic was worn.out tube pulling-pulling tire-Abl inside-Abl out take.out-Ger THROW-ing
:'The mechanic was pulling the worn-out tube out of the tire.'

The postposition ''manzi'' 'from inside' follows its object ''Tayri''. The direct object ''Tyuub'' precedes its verb ''keD-'' 'take out'. The [[compound verb]] auxiliary ''tshun-'' THROW follows the main verb ''keD-''.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning Kashmiri as a V2 language, see Hook (1976: 133ff).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kotgarhi and Kochi===

In his 1976 three-volume study of two Indo-Aryan languages of [[Himachal Pradesh]], Hendriksen reports on two intermediate cases: Kotgarhi and Kochi. Although neither language shows a regular V-2 pattern, they have evolved to the point that main and subordinate clauses differ in word order and auxiliaries may separate from other parts of the verb:
*:hyunda-baassie jaa gõrmi hõ-i (Kotgarhi)
*:winter-after GOES summer become-Gerund
*:After winter comes summer. (Hendriksen III:186)
Hendriksen reports that relative clauses in Kochi show a greater tendency to have the finite verbal element in clause-final position than matrix clauses do (III:188).

===Ingush===

In [[Ingush language|Ingush]], "for main clauses, other than episode-initial and other all-new ones, verb-second order is most common. The verb, or the finite part of a compound verb or analytic tense form (i.e. the light verb or the auxiliary), follows the first word or phrase in the clause." &lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Johanna. (2011). ''Ingush Grammar''. Berkeley: The University of California Press. Pp. 678ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

:muusaa '''vy''' hwuona telefon ''jettazh''
:Musa V.PROG 2sg.DAT telephone striking
:'Musa is telephoning you.'

===O'odham===

[[O'odham language|O'odham]] has relatively free word order within clauses; for example, all of the following sentences mean "the boy brands the pig":&lt;ref&gt;Zepeda, Ofelia. (1983). ''A Tohono O'odham Grammar''. Tucson, AZ: The University of Arizona Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ceoj '''ʼo''' g ko:jĭ ''ceposid''
* ko:jĭ '''ʼo''' g ceoj ''ceposid''
* ceoj '''ʼo''' ''ceposid'' g ko:jĭ
* ko:jĭ '''ʼo''' ''ceposid'' g ceoj
* ''ceposid'' '''ʼo''' g ceoj g ko:jĭ
* ''ceposid'' '''ʼo''' g ko:jĭ g ceoj

Despite the general freedom of sentence word order, O'odham is fairly strictly verb-second in its placement of the auxiliary verb (in the above sentences, it is ''ʼo''; in the following it is ''ʼañ''):

* Affirmative: ''cipkan'' '''ʼañ''' = "I am working"
* Negative: pi '''ʼañ''' ''cipkan'' = "I am not working" [not *pi ''cipkan'' '''ʼañ''']

===Sursilvan===

Among dialects of the [[Romansh language|Romansh]], V2 word order is limited to [[Sursilvan]], the insertion of entire phrases between auxiliary verbs and participles occurs, as in 'Cun Mariano Tschuor '''ha''' Augustin Beeli ''discurriu'' ' ('Mariano Tschuor has spoken with Augustin Beeli'), as compared to [[Vallader dialect (Romansh)|Engadinese]] 'Cun Rudolf Gasser '''ha''' ''discurrü'' Gion Peider Mischol' ('Rudolf Gasser has spoken with Gion Peider Mischol'.)&lt;ref&gt;Liver 2009, pp. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

The constituent that is bounded by the auxiliary, ''ha'', and the participle, ''discurriu'', is known as a Satzklammer or 'verbal bracket'.

==Structural analysis of V2 in Dependency Grammar ==

[[Dependency grammar]] (DG) can accommodate the V2 phenomenon simply by stipulating that one and only one constituent can be a predependent of the finite verb (i.e. a dependent which precedes its head) in declarative (matrix) clauses (in this, Dependency Grammar assumes only one clausal level and one position of the verb, instead of a distinction between a VP-internal and a higher clausal position of the verb as in Generative Grammar, cf. the next section).&lt;ref&gt;For an example of a DG analysis of the V2 principle, see Osborne (2005:260). That DG denies the existence of a finite VP constituent is apparent with most any DG representation of sentence structure; finite VP is never shown as a complete subtree (=constituent). See for instance the trees in the essays on DG in Ágel et al. (2003/2006) in this regard. Concerning the strict denial of a finite VP constituent, see especially Tesnière (1959:103-105).&lt;/ref&gt; On this account, the V2 principle is violated if the finite verb has more than one predependent or no predependent at all. The following DG structures of the first four German sentences above illustrate the analysis (the sentence means 'The kids play soccer in the park before school'):

::[[File:V2 trees 1.png|V2 trees 2]]

The finite verb ''spielen'' is the root of all clause structure. The V2 principle requires that this root have a single predependent, which it does in each of the four sentences.

The four English sentences above involving the V2 phenomenon receive the following analyses:

::[[File:V2 trees 2.png|V2 trees 2]]

==Structural analysis in Generative Grammar ==

In the theory of [[Generative Grammar]], the verb second phenomenon has been described as an application of [[X-bar theory]]. The combination of a first position for a phrase and a second position for a single verb has been identified as the combination of ''specifier'' and ''head'' of a phrase. The part after the finite verb is then the ''complement''. While the sentence structure of English is usually analysed in terms of three levels, CP, IP, and VP, in German linguistics the consensus has emerged that there is no IP in German.&lt;ref&gt; See especially: Hubert Haider, The syntax of German, Cambridge University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:X-bar simple tree.tiff|thumb|Tree structure for the English clause. German does not use an "I" position and has a VP with the verb at the end.]]
The VP (verb phrase) structure assigns position and functions to the arguments of the verb. Hence, this structure is shaped by the grammatical properties of the V (verb) which [[Head (linguistics)|heads]] the structure. 
The CP (complementizer phrase) structure incorporates the grammatical information which identifies the clause as declarative or interrogative, main or embedded. The structure is shaped by the abstract C (complementiser) which is considered the head of the structure. In embedded clauses the C position accommodates subordinating conjunctions. In German declarative main clauses, C hosts the finite verb.
Thus the V2 structure is analysed as 
:1 Topic element (specifier of CP)
:2 Finite-verb form (C=head of CP) i.e. '''verb-second'''
:3 Remainder of the clause

In embedded clauses, the C position is occupied by a conjunction.In most Germanic languages (but not in Icelandic or Yiddish), this generally prevents the finite verb from moving to C. 
:The structure is analysed as
::1 Conjunction (C=head of CP)
::2 Bulk of clause (VP), including, in German, the subject.
::3 Finite verb (V position)

This analysis does not provide a structure for the instances in some language of root clauses after bridge verbs. 
:'''Example:''' Danish '''Vi ved at denne bog har Bo ikke læst''' with the object of the embedded clause fronted.
: (Literally 'We know that this book has Bo not read')
The solution is to allow verbs such as '''ved''' to accept a clause with a second (recursive) CP.&lt;ref&gt;Sten Vikner: Sten Vikner: Verb movement and expletive subjects in the Germanic languages. Oxford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
: The conjunction occupies C position in the upper CP.

'''Woodrow Wilson Awards''' are given out in multiple countries each year by the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] to individuals in both the public sphere and business who have shown an outstanding commitment to [[President of the United States]] [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s dream of integrating politics, scholarship, and policy for the common good.  Created in 1999 as a local Award for leadership in Washington, DC, the Awards were expanded in 2001 to recognize great leaders and thinkers throughout the world.  Funding from the Awards supports additional research, scholars, and programs in Washington and the home community of the recipients.

==Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service==
The Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service is given to individuals who have served with distinction in public life and have shown a special commitment to seeking out informed opinions and thoughtful views. Recipients of this award share Woodrow Wilson’s steadfast belief in public discourse, scholarship, and the extension of the benefits of knowledge in the United States and around the world. These leaders devote themselves to examining the historical background and long-term implications of important public policy issues while encouraging the free and open exchange of ideas that is the bedrock of our nation’s foundation.

==Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship==
The Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship is given to executives who demonstrate a commitment to the common good—beyond the bottom line. They are the people who demonstrate that private firms should be good citizens in their own neighborhoods, as well as in the world. The award is given to those who have done tremendous work in improving their local communities and the world at large.
