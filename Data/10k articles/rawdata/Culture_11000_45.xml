'''''Alice: Madness Returns''''' is a [[psychological horror]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[platformer|platform]] [[video game]] developed by Chinese studio [[Spicy Horse]] and released by Electronic Arts for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]. It is the sequel to ''[[American McGee's Alice]]'' (2000). The game was released worldwide beginning in North America on June 14, 2011,&lt;ref name="alicedate" /&gt; followed by Europe on June 16, 2011, and in the United Kingdom on June 17, 2011.&lt;ref name="alicedate-eu" /&gt; The game is also backwards compatible with the [[Xbox One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Alice: Madness Returns is Xbox One Backwards Compatible|url=http://www.ubergizmo.com/2017/01/alice-madness-returns-xbox-one-backwards/|website=UberGizmo|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Alice: Madness Returns'' follows [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice Liddell]], a girl suffering from trauma caused by the death of her family in a fire. Alice was discharged from a psychiatric clinic and now lives in an orphanage for mentally traumatized orphans under the care of Dr. Angus Bumby. To get rid of the trauma and learn the truth about her past, she once again falls into [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]], where a new evil force has corrupted it.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Madness Returns screenshot.jpeg|thumb|left|Alice as seen in ''Madness Returns'', wielding the [[Vorpal sword|Vorpal Blade]].]]
''Alice: Madness Returns'' is played from a third-person perspective. The player controls Alice for the entirety of the game for running, jumping, dodging and attacking.

In combat, Alice gains a small number of weapons that can be utilized in several ways. Her primary weapon is the [[vorpal sword|Vorpal Blade]], a decorated kitchen knife. The remainder of her arsenal is somewhat akin to the benign and mundane items that take on a deadly quality in Alice's tainted Wonderland in the first game. The Pepper Grinder becomes a crank operated gatling gun, used to attack at a distance and pepper pig snouts. The Hobby Horse is used as a sledgehammer to inflict heavy damage and break barriers and defenses. The Teapot Cannon fires tea sieves that explode to cause heavy damage and, like the Hobby Horse, break barriers. By collecting teeth that are dropped by foes or found scattered about the levels, the player can upgrade these items to more powerful versions. Two other weapons cannot be upgraded, primarily because they are more defensive than directly offensive: the Umbrella acts as a shield that can be used to deflect and reflect most incoming projectiles; The Clockwork Bomb is a time-delayed/remote-controlled rabbit alarm clock that does a minimal amount of damage to enemies, but its usefulness is better illustrated as a decoy, as well as a weight to keep switches temporarily depressed.

Alice's health is tracked by a number of rose petals. Should Alice's health fall to zero during game play, the player is forced to start at the most recent checkpoint.  Falling off platforms into bottomless pits or dangerous liquids do not damage Alice but restart her at a nearby platform. The game also introduces ''Hysteria'', which can be used when Alice's health is very low, and it can only be used for a limited amount of time.

While working each level, the player can discover various secrets. A primary mechanic is to use Alice's shrinking potion to reduce in size, allowing her to walk through small spaces like keyholes, but also reveals invisible platforms and surfaces; after returning to normal size, these platforms slowly fade back to invisibility, requiring the player to remember their location. Pig's snouts, which make noise when the player is close, can be struck with the pepper grinder to reveal new paths. Radula rooms provide a short challenge to the player, which on completion grants a jar of paint; obtaining four jars earns the player another rose for Alice's health. Memories can be picked up that provide voiceovers revealing parts of the game's backstory.

Upon completion, the player can start a [[New Game Plus|new game plus]], letting them play through the game again but keeping all their weapons and upgrades from the previous attempt. From the menu, the player can also review the memories that they have found within the game.

==Plot==
Within events of the first game, Alice Liddell, believing herself responsible for a fire that consumed her home and her family, escapes into a twisted version of [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]]. While held at Rutledge Asylum for treatment, Alice was able to conquer her doubts, and eventually was released from the ward. ''Madness Returns'' takes place in 1875, a year after Alice's release.&lt;ref name="first"/&gt;&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gamefanmag.com/hero-worship/interview-american-mcgee-alice-madness-returns |title=Interview with American |publisher=Gamefanmag.com |date=2011-06-14 |accessdate=2012-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426233952/http://gamefanmag.com/hero-worship/interview-american-mcgee-alice-madness-returns |archivedate=2011-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LiveChat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ea.com/1/alice-chat|title=Alice: Madness Returns Live Event|first=American|last=McGee|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alice, now 19 years old,&lt;ref name="LiveChat"/&gt; resides at an orphanage in Victorian London, under the care of Dr. Angus Bumby, a psychiatrist who uses [[hypnosis]] to help his child patients forget their memories. Though she believes that she is fine, Alice still suffers from hallucinations of Wonderland.

During an errand, Alice is struck by a hallucination and believes herself to be in Wonderland again. Though initially idyllic, the peaceful land quickly becomes corrupted by the Infernal Train that rampages through it, leaving behind the Ruin, a force that attempts to stop Alice. Alice meets with the [[Cheshire Cat]] who affirms that it is some outside force, not Alice, that has caused this corruption, and urges her to seek out former friends and foes to discover the source of the Train. Throughout the rest of the game, Alice briefly returns to reality between episodes occurring within Wonderland. In the real world, Alice learns from the family lawyer that her sister, Elizabeth (nicknamed "Lizzie"), was first to die in the fire, despite being the farthest from its source, and had been locked in her room.

Within the corrupted Wonderland, Alice attempts to learn more from Wonderland's various citizens, including the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]], the [[Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mad Hatter]], the [[Mock Turtle]], [[the Walrus and the Carpenter]], and the [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Caterpillar]]. She is ultimately told that the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]] still lives despite her defeat at Alice's hands before, though in diminished capacity. At the Queen's castle, Alice discovers the Queen's true form, which resembles her younger self. The Queen reveals that an entity called the Dollmaker has taken over the Infernal Train and is corrupting Wonderland.

Returning to London, Alice starts to recall her memories of the night of the fire, and realizes that Dr. Bumby was there. He is responsible for the death of her sister and her whole family. She comes to the conclusion that Dr. Bumby is attempting to erase the memories of the fire from her mind and, as he has done with other children, trying to leave her as a "blank toy" to be taken by abusive masters and child molesters for a price. Furious, Alice confronts both Dr. Bumby in the real world at the [[Moorgate station]] and Dr. Bumby's Wonderland counterpart, the Dollmaker, in her fantasy on the Infernal Train. Dr. Bumby admits to his crimes, and even attests to setting Alice's home on fire after Lizzie refused his advances, removing any witnesses to his having raped her that night. He points out that by wiping out her Wonderland, he will make her forget the events of that night, while he will continue as a member of high society. Alice defeats the Dollmaker in Wonderland, giving her the strength in the real world and in her mind to push Dr. Bumby into the path of an oncoming train, killing him.

As Alice leaves the station, she finds herself in a hybrid vision of London mixed with Wonderland, Londerland. Alice wanders into the unknown terrain as the Cheshire Cat monologues that Alice has found the truth that was "worth the pain fighting for", and Wonderland, though damaged, is safe for the time being.

==Development==
Rumors of a sequel to ''Alice'' first developed shortly after the original game was released to critical and commercial success, though at that time, the development team behind the original were working on the ultimately-cancelled spin-off, ''American McGee's Oz''. As the development of the movie adaptation of ''American McGee's Alice'' took longer and the original game became more of a cult classic, in 2007 interest at [[Electronic Arts]] rose in a remake of the game and work was started on a sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remake American McGee's Alice in de maak|url=http://www.ng-gamer.nl/game-nieuws/3994_remake-american-mcgees-alice-in-de-maak/|publisher=[[NG-Gamer]]|author=Martijn Müller|language=Dutch|accessdate=2007-11-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208122738/http://www.ng-gamer.nl/game-nieuws/3994_remake-american-mcgees-alice-in-de-maak/ |archivedate=2008-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the movie adaptation fell through, plans for a sequel were shelved, and remained so for nearly a decade.

At the February 2009 [[D.I.C.E. Summit]], EA announced a sequel, which at the time had the working title ''The Return of American McGee's Alice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5156745/ea-announces-new-american-mcgees-alice-title |title=EA Announces New American McGee's Alice Title |first=Brian |last=Crecente |publisher=Kotaku.com |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5156821/the-return-of-american-mcgees-alice-set-for-pc-consoles |title=The Return of American McGee's Alice Set For PC, Consoles |publisher=Kotaku.com |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two pieces of concept art accompanied the announcement, along with the information that the original game's writer and executive producer would also return for the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5156989/american-mcgee-has-a-blank-canvas-for-alice-sequel |title=American McGee Has a Blank Canvas for Alice Sequel |publisher=Kotaku.com |date=2009-02-20 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November of that year, a fan-made trailer (with the title "The Return of Alice") was mistaken by gaming news outlets as an official teaser for the game, in which Alice is in therapy after a [[relapse]] nine months following the events of the first game, and appears to [[hallucination|hallucinate]] an image of the [[Cheshire Cat]] in place of her doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmcgee.com/wordpress/2009/11/04/return-of-alice-video-madness/ |title=American McGee's Blog " Return of Alice (Video Madness) |publisher=Americanmcgee.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100817074055/http://www.americanmcgee.com/wordpress/2009/11/04/return-of-alice-video-madness/| archivedate= 17 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At EA's Studio Showcase on July 20, 2010, more details about the game were shown, including its current title, ''Alice: Madness Returns''. In addition to further pieces of concept art and actual, in-game screenshots, the first official teaser was released. Despite (or perhaps because of) the fan video eight months prior, it also portrays Alice in therapy: after being [[Hypnosis|hypnotized]] by her doctor in a bizarre office filled with dismembered arms hanging from the ceiling, as she opens her mouth to speak, large amounts of blood and teeth pour out. As the game title appears, a whispering voice is heard saying, "What have you done?"&lt;ref name="first"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5591981/our-first-official-look-at-alice-madness-returns |title=Our First Official Look at Alice: Madness Returns |publisher=Kotaku.com |date=2010-07-20 |accessdate=2010-08-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723141403/http://kotaku.com/5591981/our-first-official-look-at-alice-madness-returns |archivedate=23 July 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2010 [[Tokyo Game Show]], new assets, including a second trailer, were released. Alice is seen strolling through a [[London]] street, and eventually approaches an area littered with toys and a toy store window, which contains a set depicting the [[Mad Hatter]], the [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]] and the [[March Hare]] taking tea. Suddenly, she sees an image of her deceased parents in the window's reflection, but turns around to find no one there. The window begins to burn and the silhouette of the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]] appears before it explodes in flames, and the Queen's tentacles drag Alice into the inferno. Like the previous trailer, it ends with a voice saying "What have you done?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/5638204/yup-alice-is-definitely-crazy-in-alice-madness-returns/gallery/ | title = Yup, Alice Is Definitely Crazy In Alice: Madness Returns | first = Luke | last = Plunkett | date = 2010-09-15 | accessdate = 2010-09-15 | publisher = [[Kotaku|Kotaku.com]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100918075224/http://kotaku.com/5638204/yup-alice-is-definitely-crazy-in-alice-madness-returns/gallery/| archivedate= 18 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2011, [[MSNBC]]'s "In-Game" website unveiled the third teaser trailer as well as a brief interview with American McGee regarding the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Todd Kenreck |url=http://ingame.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/02/14/6029073-madness-through-a-looking-glass |title=Madness through a looking glass - Ingame on msnbc.com |publisher=Ingame.msnbc.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118203807/http://ingame.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/02/14/6029073-madness-through-a-looking-glass |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The third teaser depicts Alice wandering around an initially beautiful Wonderland, eventually coming across the [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Caterpillar]], who transforms into a giant, menacing [[butterfly]] as the landscape is attacked by fiery [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]es and turned into a nightmarish world reminiscent of the original game's landscapes. Alice finds herself sitting at a tea party with the Mad Hatter, [[March Hare]] and Dormouse. The Hatter sends a robotic teapot to kill Alice, who in turns stabs it to death in the eye with the Vorpal Blade. Then, a voice asks "What have you done?"

A fourth trailer, showing gameplay footage for the first time was released on March 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/videos/2011/03/04/alice-madness-returns-beautiful-insanity-trailer |title=Alice: Madness Returns: Beautiful Insanity Trailer |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2017-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer featured possible gameplay in Victorian London, new costumes and weapons for Alice, the reprised roles of some of the voice cast from the first game, and the appearance of old and new characters including a resurrected [[Jabberwock]] and [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|the Dodo]]; after the trailer the Cheshire Cat says "Now it's time to put your blade to work". The player can also hear Alice's Vorpal Blade being equipped as the title card comes up.

[[GameSpot]] released footage of a gameplay demo whilst interviewing an EA executive producer Joel Wade in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5HOfZsbW0k |title=Alice Madness Returns (HD) Gameplay/ Interview |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-04-09 |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video, numerous details about the game were revealed. Wade explained storywise after Alice left Rutledge Asylum, she is an orphan and now lives in an orphanage, and the home's director is helping her. Gameplay showed Alice can unlock and use several weapons, which can be upgraded by collecting teeth throughout the game. Weapons including the Vorpal Blade, the Pepper Grinder which acts as a projectile [[machine gun]]-like weapon, the Clockwork Bomb, the club-like Hobby Horse, and the explosive Teapot Cannon. Alice also collects "memories" that are part of her quest to recall forgotten memories from her past. Enemies are described as having "puzzle elements", namely their weak point which the player must figure out to defeat them.

On May 20, 2011, a prequel to ''Madness Returns'', titled ''Alice: Madness Returns Interactive Story'', was released as an app exclusively for [[iOS]]. A port for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones has been developed. The app plays as a book that requires you to interact with illustrations and at many times allows you to play mini-games. The story covers the events even before the original game all the way to the events directly before ''Alice: Madness Returns''.

On June 3, 2011, a final launch trailer was released. This showed some bosses, Alice fighting enemies, the Cheshire Cat giving Alice hints, and more. At the time of release, ''Madness Returns'' had a final development budget of $9 million.&lt;ref name="AMA"&gt;{{cite web|title=AMA - American McGee &amp; Pirate Jam|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/5uf93s/ama_american_mcgee_pirate_jam/ddu08qa/|website=Reddit|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, American McGee admitted that he wished he had had more time to polish the game by compressing the action, removing a lot of the "filler" content and fixing some of the annoying bugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hollingsworth|first1=Katy|title=Exclusive Interview with American McGee and His Alice: Otherlands Project|url=http://www.gameskinny.com/asp13/exclusive-interview-with-american-mcgee-and-his-alice-otherlands-project|website=GameSkinny|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels==
===''Alice: Otherlands''===
American McGee has stated that he had envisioned the ''Alice'' series as a trilogy. In May 2011, McGee reported that a story had already been created for a potential third game, but stressed that it would only be produced if the audience desired it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegamingliberty.com/index.php/2011/05/11/tgl-interview-american-mcgee-talks-alice-madness-returns/|title=TGL Interview: American McGee Talks Alice: Madness Returns|first=Shane|last=Willoughby|publisher=TheGamingLiberty.com|date=May 11, 2011|accessdate=July 20, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711014049/http://thegamingliberty.com/index.php/2011/05/11/tgl-interview-american-mcgee-talks-alice-madness-returns/|archivedate=July 11, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, McGee reiterated his intention to develop a third game, titled ''Alice in Otherland''. McGee revealed that the game would be [[episodic video game|released episodically]], and stated that it "would allow Alice to go into the minds of all these characters she encounters, and it opens up the possibility where you could play as Alice and you can enter into a player's mind, change the landscape, and then basically psychologically adjust the character in doing so. Imagine an MMO where the missions aren't locations, but they're people." However, he said that the game was unlikely to be produced soon due to a lack of interest from [[Electronic Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/6/5/3066567/how-american-mcgee-left-alice-for-a-world-of-free-to-play-toy-stores|title=How American McGee left 'Alice' for a world of free-to-play, toy stores and life without EA|first=Emily|last=Gera|publisher=TheVerge.com|date=June 5, 2012|accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 14, 2013, McGee posted on his Facebook page that he would have the opportunity to discuss a third ''Alice'' game with EA during the [[Game Developers Conference]]. He did not specify whether or not this would follow the desired plot of ''Alice in Otherland'', but claimed that the funding for the project would most possibly be done through [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151371710227075&amp;set=a.10150264827797075.336011.540107074&amp;type=1|title=Timeline Photos |accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 15, 2013, McGee announced that a campaign for the production has begun on Kickstarter to help fund the project, titled ''Alice: Otherlands'', a series of animated film shorts. To help promote the campaign, McGee released a video on his personal [[YouTube]] and [[Vimeo]] accounts, explaining the concept of ''Alice: Otherlands'' and how the funds will affect the production of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=UU2tMcqfia6N5BbZLEm0_85Q|title=Alice: Otherlands - Kickstarter Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Vimeo|id=70311897|title=Alice: Otherlands (Kickstarter video)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video can also be viewed on its Kickstarter website.

''Alice: Otherlands'' successfully reached its Kickstarter goal on August 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spicyhorse/alice-otherlands/posts/559194|title=Wooo! We did it!}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 21, McGee confirmed that the campaign has achieved its "stretch goal" to secure Susie Brann's (Alice's voice actress) and [[Roger L. Jackson]]'s (the Cheshire Cat's voice actor) involvement on the project with an extra $50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spicyhorse/alice-otherlands/posts/553831|title=They're Back...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spicyhorse/alice-otherlands/posts/576589|title=Stretch Goooooal!}}&lt;/ref&gt; To award the backers who donated to the project, McGee gave special merchandises, such as autographed posters, digital copies of the DVD and art book to those who donated $500 or more. Additionally, all backers had their names added to the credits of the film. Due to legal constraints, [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray]]s were available for backers only, while the short films was distributed digitally for the public for free on various digital formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spicyhorse/alice-otherlands/posts/1387879|title=Arrival of Physical Rewards}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An art book titled ''The Art of Alice: Otherlands'' was developed by artist Alex "AlexCee" Crowley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spicyhorse/alice-otherlands/posts/1199901|title=The Art of The Art Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, ''Alice: Otherlands'' was set to be released sometime in December 2014, but has been pushed back due to production delays.&lt;ref name="Update#45"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spicyhorse/alice-otherlands/posts/1043404|title=Quick Update}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 30, 2015, the digital assets for ''Alice: Otherlands'' was released on various streaming platforms, such as YouTube and Vimeo, and is available for download on the official site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spicyhorse/alice-otherlands/posts/1396070|title=Something Wicked This Way Comes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spicyhorse/alice-otherlands/posts/1399531|title=Digital Content Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to McGee, Alice, now 20 years old,&lt;ref name="LiveChat"/&gt; will enter the minds of two&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/AliceOtherlands/posts/867389689992986|title=Latest update on the Alice: Otherlands Kickstarter.|accessdate=2015-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; famous historical figures, [[Richard Wagner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spicyhorse/alice-otherlands/posts/662964|title=A Night at the Opera}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spicyhorse/alice-otherlands/posts/813386|title=Eyeballs, Tentacles, and Monsters}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jules Verne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spicyhorse/alice-otherlands/posts/615652|title=Leviathan - The First Otherlands Script!}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discover the horrors of the human subconscious. Alice will learn of an "insidious evil lurking in every corner of Victorian London" with the intent of capturing its inhabitants in a nightmarish "prison of the mind". The two film shorts vary in length, have their own unique animation style, and a different soundtrack composed by [[Chris Vrenna]] and Walter Sickert and the Army of Broken Toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spicyhorse/alice-otherlands|title=Alice: Otherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spicyhorse/alice-otherlands/posts/908084|title=Noble Pursuits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several interviews, McGee expressed his desire to make ''Alice: Otherlands'' into a video game as originally planned, but stated that will depend entirely on the overall success of the animated shorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://features.en.softonic.com/interview-american-mcgees-alice-otherlands|title=Interview: American McGee's Alice: Otherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameskinny.com/asp13/exclusive-interview-with-american-mcgee-and-his-alice-otherlands-project|title=Exclusive Interview with American McGee and His Alice: Otherlands Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://918thefan.com/2013/kanas-korner-interview-with-american-mcgee/|title=Kana’s Korner – Interview with American McGee}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that EA have recently started to show more interest in making an ''Alice'' sequel again, but it all depends on the success of ''Alice: Otherlands'' and Spicy Horse games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGee|first1=American|title=A note from American McGee regarding Chains of Darkness|url=https://www.facebook.com/AliceOtherlands/photos/a.485746794823946.1073741827.479423592122933/811361538929135/?type=1&amp;permPage=1|website=Facebook|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Alice: Asylum''===
On September 3, 2017, American McGee announced on his blog that he is working on a proposal for the third installment of the ''Alice'' franchise, tentatively titled ''Alice: Asylum''. McGee explains that his proposal will consist of "artwork, design outline, and financial/business model" which will be sent to EA once it is completed. He encourages fans to sign up for the mailing list for the project to show their support and lend financial support for the pre-production through [[PayPal]] on his blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmcgee.com/alice-3/|title=Alice 3 - American McGee's Blog|website=www.americanmcgee.com|access-date=2017-09-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906071312/http://www.americanmcgee.com/alice-3/|archive-date=2017-09-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42754">{{Maya civilization}}
'''Ancient Maya art''' refers to the material arts of the [[Maya civilization]], an eastern and south-eastern [[Mesoamerica]]n culture that took shape in the course of the later [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic Period]] (500 BCE to 200 CE). Its greatest artistic flowering occurred during the seven centuries of the {{C|Mayan Classic Period|Classic Period}} (c. 200 to 900 CE). Ancient Maya art then went through an extended Post-Classic phase before the upheavals of the sixteenth century destroyed courtly culture and put an end to the Mayan artistic tradition. Many regional styles existed, not always coinciding with the changing boundaries of Maya polities. [[Olmec]]s, [[Teotihuacan]] and [[Toltec]]s have all influenced Maya art. Traditional art forms have mainly survived in weaving and the design of peasant houses.

==Mayan art history==
Following the nineteenth and early-twentieth century publications on Maya art and archaeology by [[John Lloyd Stephens|Stephens]], [[Frederick Catherwood|Catherwood]], [[Alfred Maudslay|Maudslay]], [[Teoberto Maler|Maler]] and [[Désiré Charnay|Charnay]] that for the first time made available reliable drawings and photographs of major Classic Maya monuments, the 1913 publication of Herbert Spinden´s 'A Study of Maya Art' - now over a century ago - laid the foundation for all later developments of Maya art history (including iconography).&lt;ref&gt;Spinden 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The book gives an analytical treatment of themes and motifs, particularly the ubiquitous serpent and dragon motifs, and a review of the ´material arts´, such as the composition of temple facades, roof combs and mask panels. Spinden's chronological treatment of Maya art was later (1950) refined by the motif analysis of the architect and specialist in archaeological drawing, [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]], in her book 'A Study of Classic Maya Sculpture'.&lt;ref&gt;Proskouriakoff 1950&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Kubler|Kubler's]] 1969 inventory of Maya iconography, containing a site-by-site treatment of 'commemorative' images and a topical treatment of ritual and mythical images (such as the 'triadic sign'), concluded a period of gradual increase of knowledge that was soon to be overshadowed by new developments.

Starting in the early 1970s, the historiography of the Mayan kingdoms - first of all Palenque - came to occupy the forefront. Art-historical interpretation joined the historical approach pioneered by Proskouriakoff as well as the mythological approach initiated by [[Michael D. Coe|M.D. Coe]], with a professor of art, Linda Schele, serving as a driving force. Schele's seminal interpretations of Maya art are found throughout her work, especially in ''The Blood of Kings'', written together with art historian [[Mary Miller (art historian)|M. Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Miller 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Maya art history was also spurred by the enormous increase in sculptural and ceramic imagery, due to extensive archaeological excavations, as well as to organized looting on an unprecedented scale. On from 1973, M.D. Coe published a series of books offering pictures and interpretations of unknown Maya vases, with the Popol Vuh Twin myth for an explanatory model.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1973, 1975, 1978, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Robicsek and Hales added an inventory and classification of Maya vases painted in codex style,&lt;ref&gt;Robicsek and Hales 1981&lt;/ref&gt; thereby revealing even more of a hitherto barely known spiritual world.

As to subsequent developments, important issues in Schele's iconographic work have been elaborated by [[Karl Taube]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Miller and Taube 1993; Taube et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; New approaches to Maya art include studies of ancient Maya ceramic workshops,&lt;ref&gt;Reents-Budet 1994&lt;/ref&gt; the representation of bodily experience and the senses in Maya art,&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and of hieroglyphs considered as iconographic units.&lt;ref name="Stone and Zender 2011"&gt;Stone and Zender 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the number of monographs devoted to the monumental art of specific courts is growing.&lt;ref&gt;Tate 1992, Looper 2003, Simmons Clancy 2009, O'Neil 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A good impression of recent Mexican and North American art historical scholarship can be gathered from the exhibition catalogue 'Courtly Art of the Ancient Maya' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Martin 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
{{main|Maya architecture}}

[[File:Copan T11-2.jpg|thumb|Copan, 'Reviewing Stand' with simian musicians]] 
[[File:Labna-Palace-Vaulted-Passage.jpg|thumb|Labna, Palace, vaulted passage]]

The layout of the Maya towns and [[Maya city|cities]], and more particularly of the ceremonial centers where the royal families and courtiers resided, is characterized by the rhythm of immense horizontal stucco floors of plazas often located at various levels, connected by broad and often steep stairs, and surmounted by temple pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;Stierlin 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Under successive reigns, the main buildings were enlarged by adding new layers of fill and stucco coating. Irrigation channels, reservoirs, and drains made up the hydraulic infrastructure. Outside the ceremonial center (especially in the southern area sometimes resembling an [[acropolis]]) were the structures of lesser nobles, smaller temples, and individual shrines, surrounded by the wards of the commoners. Dam-like causeways ([[sacbe]]ob) spread from the 'ceremonial centers' to other nuclei of habitation. Fitting in with the concept of a '[[theatre state]]', more attention appears to have been given to aesthetics than to solidity of construction. Careful attention, however, was placed on directional orientation.

Among the various types of structures should be mentioned:
*Ceremonial platforms (usually less than 4 meters in height).
*Courtyards and palaces.
*Other residential buildings, such as a writers' house &lt;ref&gt;Coe and Kerr 1997: 100-101&lt;/ref&gt; and a possible council house in Copan.
*Temples and temple pyramids, the latter often containing burials in their base or fill, with sanctuaries on top. The outstanding example are the many clustered dynastic burial temples of Tikal's [[North Acropolis, Tikal|North Acropolis]].   
*[[Mesoamerican ball court|Ball courts]].
 
Among the structural ensembles are:
*'[[Triadic pyramid]]s' consisting of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform;
*'[[E-Group|E-groups]]' consisting of a square platform with a low four-stepped pyramid on the west side and an elongated structure, or, alternatively, three small structures, on the eastern side;
*'[[Twin pyramid complex]]es', with identical four-stepped pyramids on the east and west sides of a small plaza; a building with nine doorways on the south side; and a small enclosure on the north side housing a sculpted stela with its altar and commemorating the king's performance of a [[k'atun]]-ending ceremony.

In the palaces and temple rooms, the '[[corbelled vault]]' was often applied. Though not an effective means to increase interior space, as it required thick stone walls to support the high ceiling, some temples utilized repeated arches, or a corbelled vault, to construct an inner sanctuary (e.g., that of the Temple of the Cross at Palenque).

The northern Maya area (Campeche and Yucatan) shows characteristics of its own. Its Classic [[Puuc]], Chenes, and [[Rio Bec]] architecture&lt;ref&gt;Gendrop 1983&lt;/ref&gt; is characterized by the geometrical reduction of realistic decoration; the stacking of rain god snouts to build facades; the use of portals shaped like serpent mouths; and, in the Rio Bec area, the use of solid pseudo temple-pyramids. The most important Puuc site is [[Uxmal]]. [[Chichen Itza]], dominating Yucatan from the Late Classic to well into the Post-Classic, features Classic buildings in Chenes and Puuc style as well as Post-Classic building types of Mexican derivation, such as the radial four-staircase pyramid, the colonnaded hall, and the circular temple. The latter features were inherited by the succeeding kingdom of [[Mayapan]].

==Stone sculpture==
{{see also|Maya stelae}}

[[File:Stela A Copan 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|180px|Copan stela A, Maudslay cast]] 
The main Preclassic sculptural style from the Maya area is that of [[Izapa]], a large settlement on the Pacific coast where many stelas and (frog-shaped) altars were found showing motifs also present in [[Olmec]] art.&lt;ref&gt;Guernsey 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The stelas, mostly without inscriptions, often show mythological and narrative subjects, some of which appear to relate to the Twin myth of the [[Popol Vuh]]. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain if the inhabitants of Izapa were ethnically Mayan. For the Classic Period of the Mayas, the following major classes of stone sculpture may be distinguished.

*'''Stelas'''. These are large, elongated stone slabs usually covered with carvings and inscriptions, and often accompanied by round altars. Typical of the Classical period, most of them depict the rulers of the cities they were located in, often disguised as gods. Although the rulers' faces, particularly during the later Classic Period, are naturalistic in style, they usually do not show individual traits; but there are notable exceptions to this rule (e.g., [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]], stela 35). The most famous stelas are from [[Copan]] and nearby [[Quirigua]]. These are outstanding for their intricateness of detail, those of Quirigua also for sheer height (stela E measuring over 7 metres above ground level and 3 below). Both the Copan and [[Tonina]] stelas approach sculptures in the round. From [[Palenque]], otherwise a true Maya capital of the arts, no significant stelae have been preserved.
*'''[[lintel (architecture)|Lintels]]''', spanning doorways or jambs. Particularly [[Yaxchilan]] is renowned for its long series of lintels in deep relief, some of the most famous of which show meetings with [[Maya religion|ancestors]] or, perhaps, local deities.&lt;ref&gt;Tate 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Panels and tablets''', set in the walls and piers of buildings and the sides of platforms. Particularly [[Palenque]] is famous for the large tablets adorning the inner sanctuaries of the Cross Group temples, and for refined masterworks such as the 'Palace Tablet', the 'Tablet of the Slaves', and the multi-figure panels of the temple XIX and XXI platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart and Stuart 2008&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Pakal]]'s carved sarcophagus lid - without equal in other Maya kingdoms - might also be included here.
*'''Altars''', rounded or rectangular, sometimes resting on three or four boulder-like legs. They may be wholly or partly figurative (e.g., Copan turtle altar) or have a relief image on top, sometimes consisting of a single ''[[Ajaw|Ahau]]'' day sign (Caracol, Tonina).&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000: 89&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Zoomorphs''', or large boulders sculpted to resemble living creatures and covered with highly complicated relief ornamentation. Zoomorphs seem to be restricted to the kingdom of [[Quirigua]] during the Late Classic period&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003: 172-178, 186-192&lt;/ref&gt; and may have functioned as altars.
*'''Ball court markers''', or rounded relief carvings placed in the central axis of the floors of ball courts (such as those of Copan, [[Chinkultic]], Tonina), and usually showing royal ball game scenes. 
*'''Monumental stairs''', most famously the giant hieroglyphic stairway of Copan. The hewn stone blocks of hieroglyphic stairways together constitute an extensive text. Stairways can also be decorated with a great variety of scenes ([[La Corona]]), particularly the ball game. Sometimes, the ball game becomes the stairs' chief theme ([[Yaxchilan]]), with a captive depicted inside the ball, or, elsewhere ([[Tonina]]), a full-figure captive stretched out along the step.
*'''Thrones''', with a broad, square seat, and a back sometimes iconically shaped like the wall of a cave, and worked open to show human figures. Examples from Palenque and Copan have supports showing cosmologic carriers ([[Bacab]]s, [[Chaak]]s).
*'''Stone sculpture in the round''', represented by statuary, such as the seated Copan scribe and small stelas from Toniná; by certain figurative architectural elements, such as the maize deities from a Copan façade; and by giant sculptures such as the symmetrically-positioned jaguars and simian musicians of Copán, that were integral parts of architectural design.

==Wood carving==
[[File:WLA metmuseum Maya Wood Mirror Bearer 6th century.jpg|thumb|upright|120px|Possible mirror bearer, wood, 6th century]]
It is believed that carvings in wood were once extremely common, but only a few examples have survived. Most 16th-century wood carvings, considered objects of idolatry, were destroyed by the Spanish colonial authorities. The most important Classic examples consist of intricately worked lintels, mostly from the main [[Tikal]] pyramid sanctuaries,&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Coe et al. 1961&lt;/ref&gt; with one specimen from nearby [[El Zotz]]. The Tikal wood reliefs, each consisting of several beams, and dating to the 8th century, show a king on his seat with a protector figure looming large behind, in the form of a Teotihuacan-style 'war serpent' (Temple I lintel 2), a jaguar (Temple I lintel 3), or a human impersonator of the [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar god of terrestrial fire]] (Temple IV lintel 2). Other Tikal lintels depict an obese king wearing a jaguar dress and standing in front of his seat (Temple III lintel 2); and most famously, a victorious king, dressed as an astral death god, and standing on a palanquin underneath an arching feathered serpent ([[Tikal Temple IV|Temple IV lintel 3]]). A rare utility object is a tiny lidded box covered with a long hieroglyphic inscription from [[Tortuguero (Maya site)| Tortuguero]]. Free sculpture in wood, dating back to the 6th century, is represented by a dignified seated man possibly functioning as a mirror bearer.

==Stucco modeling==
[[Image:PyramideDesMasquesKohunlich.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Stucco mask panels, Early Classic, Kohunlich]]
[[Image:K'inich Janaab Pakal I v2.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Stucco portrait of king [[Pakal]], Palenque]]
At least since Late Preclassic times, modeled and painted stucco plaster covered the floors and buildings of the town centers and provided the setting for their stone sculptures. Often, large mask panels with the plastered heads of deities in high relief (particularly those of sun, rain, and earth) are found attached to the sloping retaining walls of temple platforms flanking stairs (e.g., [[Kohunlich]]). Stucco modeling and relief work can also cover the entire building, as shown by Temple 16 of [[Copan]], in its 6th-century form (known as 'Rosalila'). Dedicated to the first king, [[Yax K'uk' Mo']], this early temple has preserved plastered and painted facades. The stuccoed friezes, walls, piers, and roof combs of the Late Preclassic and Classic periods show varying and sometimes symbolically complicated decorative programs.
 
Several solutions for dividing up and ordering the stuccoed surfaces of buildings were applied, serialization being one of them. The Early Classic walls of the 'Temple of the [[Maya jaguar gods#The Jaguar God of Terrestrial Fire and War ('Night Sun')|Night Sun]]' in [[El Zotz]] consist of a series of subtly varied deity mask panels, whereas the frieze of a [[Balamku]] palace, also from the Early Classic, originally had a series of four rulers enthroned above the open ophidian mouths of four different animals (a toad among them) associated with symbolic mountains. Conversely, friezes may be centered on a single ruler again sitting on a symbolic (maize) mountain, such as a frieze from [[Holmul]], with two feathered serpents emanating from below the ruler's seat, and another one from [[Xultun]], on which the ruler carries a large ceremonial bar with emerging jaguar-like figures.&lt;ref&gt;newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm/index.php/Saturnoxultun&lt;/ref&gt; An Early-Classic temple frieze from Placeres, Quintana Roo, has the large mask panel of a young lord or deity in the middle, with two lateral [[Mam (Maya mythology)|'Grandfather']] deities extending their arms.

Often, a frieze is divided into compartments. Late Preclassic friezes of [[El Mirador]], for example, show the intervening spaces of an undulating serpent's body filled out with aquatic birds, and the sections of an aquatic band with swimming figures.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle and Houston 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a Classic palace frieze in [[Acanceh]] is divided into panels holding different animal figures&lt;ref&gt;V.E. Miller 1991&lt;/ref&gt; reminiscent of [[wayob]], while a wall in [[Tonina]] has lozenge-shaped fields suggesting a scaffold and presenting continuous narrative scenes that relate to human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;see Yadeun 1993:108-115&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastered temple roof combs are similar to some of the friezes above in that they usually show large representations of rulers, who may again be seated on a symbolic mountain, and also, as on Palenque's Temple of the Sun, set within a cosmological framework. Further examples of Classic stucco modeling include the piers of the Palenque Palace, embellished with a series of lords and ladies in ritual dress, and the 'baroque', Late-Classic [[Chenes]]-style stucco entrance, beset with naturalistic human figures, on the Acropolis (Str. 1) of [[Ek' Balam]].

Unique in Mesoamerica, Classic Period stucco modeling includes realistic portraiture of a quality equalling that of Roman ancestral portraits, with the lofty stucco heads of Palenque rulers and portraits of dignitaries from [[Tonina]] as outstanding examples. Some of these portrait heads were part of life-size stucco figures adorning temple crests.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000: 168&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait modeling recalls that of certain Jaina ceramic statuettes.

==Mural painting==
[[Image:Bonampak painting.jpg|thumbnail|left|300px|Bonampak mural, room 1, east wall: Musicians]]
[[File:SBmural.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|San Bartolo mural: The king as Hunahpu]]
Although, due to the humid climate of [[Central America]], relatively few Mayan paintings have survived to the present day integrally, important remnants have been found in nearly all major court residences. This is especially the case in substructures, hidden under later architectural additions. Mural paintings may show more or less repetitive motifs, such as the subtly varied flower symbols on walls of House E of the Palenque Palace; scenes of daily life, as in one of the buildings surrounding the central square of [[Calakmul]] and in a palace of Chilonche; or ritual scenes involving deities, as in the Post-Classic temple murals of Yucatán's and Belize's east coast ([[Tancah]], [[Tulum]], Santa Rita).&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1982; Gann 1900&lt;/ref&gt;

They may also evince a more narrative character, usually with hieroglyphic captions present. The colourful [[Bonampak]] murals, for example, dating from 790 AD, and extending over the walls and vaults of three adjacent rooms, show spectacular scenes of nobility, battle and sacrifice, as well as a group of ritual impersonators in the midst of a file of [[Maya music|musicians]].&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Miller 1986; M.E. Miller and Brittenham 2013&lt;/ref&gt; At [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]], murals dating from 100 BCE relate to the myths of the [[Maya maize god]] and the hero twin [[Hunahpu]], and depict a double inthronization; antedating the Classic Period by several centuries, the style is already fully developed, with colours being subtle and muted as compared to those of Bonampak or Calakmul.&lt;ref&gt;Saturno et al. 2005; Taube et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the Mayan area, in a ward of East-Central Mexican [[Cacaxtla]], murals painted in a predominantly Classic Mayan style, with often stark colors, have been found, such as a savage battle scene extending over 20 meters; two figures of Mayan lords standing on serpents; and an irrigated maize and cacao field visited by [[God L|the Maya merchant deity]].&lt;ref&gt;Lozoff Brittenham and Uriarte 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Wall painting also occurs on vault capstones, in tombs (e.g., [[Río Azul]]), and in caves (e.g., [[Naj Tunich]]),&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1995&lt;/ref&gt; usually executed in black on a whitened surface, at times with the additional use of red paint. Yucatec vault capstones often show a depiction of the enthroned [[god K|lightning deity]] (e.g., [[Ek' Balam]]).

A bright turquoise blue colour - '[[Maya Blue]]' - has survived through the centuries due to its unique chemical characteristics; this color is present in [[Bonampak]], [[Cacaxtla]], Jaina, [[El Tajín]], and even in some Colonial Convents. The use of Maya Blue survived until the 16th century, when the technique was lost.&lt;ref&gt;Reyes-Valerio 1993; Houston et al. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and bookmaking==
{{main|Maya script|Maya codices}}
[[File:Mexico - Museo de antropologia - Livre maya.JPG|thumb|Madrid Codex]]
The Maya writing system consists of about 1000 distinct characters or hieroglyphs ('glyphs'), and like many ancient writing systems is a mixture of syllabic signs and [[logogram]]s. This script was in use from the 3rd century BCE until shortly after the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. As of now (2017), a considerable proportion of the characters has a reading, but their meaning and configuration as a text is not always understood. The books were folded and consisted of bark paper or leather leaves with an adhesive stucco layer on which to write; they were protected by jaguar skin covers or, perhaps, wooden boards.&lt;ref&gt;Coe and Kerr 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Since every diviner probably needed a book, there must have existed large numbers of them. Today, [[Maya codices|three codices]] (the [[Dresden Codex|Dresden]], [[Paris Codex|Paris]], and [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid]] codices), all of the Post-Classic period, are still in existence; the authenticity of a fourth one (the [[Grolier Codex]]) remains doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;Love 2017&lt;/ref&gt; They are largely of a divinatory and priestly nature, containing almanacs, astrological tables, and ritual programs; the Paris Codex also includes [[Katun (Maya calendar)|katun]]-prophecies. Great attention was paid to a harmonious balance of texts and (partly coloured) illustrations.

Besides the codical glyphs, there existed a cursive script of an often dynamic character, found in wall-paintings and on ceramics, and imitated in stone on panels from Palenque (such as the 'Tablet of the 96 glyphs'). Often, written captions are enclosed in square 'boxes' of various shapes within the representation. Wall paintings may also entirely consist of texts ([[Ek' Balam]], [[Naj Tunich]]), or, more rarely, contain astrological computations ([[Xultun]]); sometimes, written on a white stuccoed surface, and executed with particular care and elegance, these texts are like enlargements of book pages.
 
Hieroglyphs are ubiquitous and were written on every available surface, including the human body. The glyphs themselves are highly detailed, and particularly the [[logogram]]s are deceivingly realistic. As a matter of fact, from an art-historical point of view, they should also be viewed as art motifs, and ''vice versa''.&lt;ref name="Stone and Zender 2011"/&gt; Sculptors at Copan and Quirigua have consequently felt free to convert hieroglyphic elements and calendrical signs into animated, dramatic miniature scenes ('full figure glyphs').

==Ceramics and 'ceramic codex'==
{{main|Maya ceramics}}
[[File:Codex vase Collection Henry Law 154.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Codex style cylinder vessel, courtly ritual]]
[[File:Maya Reicher Mann.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jaina, nobleman]]
Unlike utility ceramics found in such large numbers among the debris of archaeological sites, most of the decorated pottery (cylinder vessels, lidded dishes, vases, bowls) once was '[[social currency]]' among the Maya nobility, and, preserved as heirlooms, also accompanied the nobles into their graves.&lt;ref&gt;Reents-Budet 1994: 72ff&lt;/ref&gt; The aristocratic tradition of gift-giving feasts&lt;ref&gt;Tozzer 1941: 92&lt;/ref&gt; and ceremonial visits, and the emulation that inevitably went with these exchanges, goes a long way towards explaining the high level of artistry reached in Classical times.

Made without a potter's wheel, decorated pottery was delicately painted, carved into relief, incised, or - chiefly during the Early Classic period - made with the Teotihuacan [[fresco]] technique of applying paint to a wet clay surface. The precious objects were manufactured in numerous workshops distributed over the Mayan kingdoms, some of the most famous being associated with the [[Chama (Maya site)|'Chama-style']], the [[Holmul#Holmul-style|'Holmul-style']], the so-called [[Motul de San Jose#Ik style ceramics|'Ik-style']]&lt;ref&gt;Just 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and, for carved pottery, the 'Chochola-style.'&lt;ref&gt;Tate 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Vase decoration shows great variation, including palace scenes, courtly ritual, mythology, divinatory glyphs, and even dynastical texts taken from chronicles, and plays a major role in reconstructing Classical Maya life and beliefs. Ceramic scenes and texts painted in black and red on a white underground, the equivalents of pages from the lost folding books, are referred to as being in 'codex style' (e.g., the so-called [[Princeton Vase]]). The hieroglyphical and pictural overlap with the three extant books is (at least up to now) relatively small.

Sculptural ceramic art includes [[censer|incense burners]] and hand or mold-made figurines sometimes used as ocarinas. The profusely decorated, elongated Classic incense burners from the kingdom of Palenque - evolved from Early-Classic models - show the modeled face of a deity (usually the [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar deity of terrestrial fire]]) or of a king. The elaborate Post-Classic, mold-made effigy incense burners especially associated with [[Mayapan]] represent standing deities (or priestly deity impersonators) often carrying offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1957; Milbrath 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Figurines, many of them mold-made, are often of an amazing liveliness and realism. Apart from deities, [[Maya religion#Animal persons|animal persons]], rulers and dwarfs, they show many other characters as well as scenes taken from daily life. Some of these figurines may have been used in rituals. The most impressive examples stem from [[Jaina Island]].

==Precious stone and other sculpted materials==
[[File:Palenque - Pakal - Grabbeigabe.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Jade belt assemblage with celt pendants, from the tomb of king [[Pakal]], Palenque]]
[[File:Placa de jade, Nebaj, museu Nacional d'Arqueologia i Etnologia, Guatemala.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jade plaque from Nebaj]]
It is remarkable that the Maya, who had no metal tools, created many objects from a very thick and dense material, jade ([[jadeite]]), particularly all sorts of (royal) dress elements, such as [[Maya belt plaques|belt plaques]] - or celts - ear spools, pendants, and also masks. Celts (i.e., flat, celt-shaped ornaments) were sometimes engraved with a stela-like representation of the king (e.g., the Early-Classic 'Leyden Plate'). The best-known example of a mask is probably the death mask of the Palenque king [[Pakal]], covered with irregularly-shaped jade plaques and having eyes made from [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]] and obsidian; another death mask, belonging to a Palenque queen, consists of malachite plaques. Similarly, certain cylindrical vases from Tikal have an outer layer of square jade discs. Many stone carvings had jade inlays.

Among other sculpted and engraved materials are flint, shell, and bone, often found in caches and burials. The so-called '[[eccentric flint]]s' are ceremonial objects of uncertain use, in their most elaborate forms of elongated shape with usually various heads extending on one or both sides, sometimes those of the [[God K|lightning deity]], but more often of an anthropomorphic lightning probably representing the [[Maya maize god|Tonsured Maize God]].&lt;ref&gt;Agurcia, Sheets, Taube 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Shell was worked into disks and other decorative elements showing human, possibly ancestral heads and deities; [[conch]] trumpets were similarly decorated.&lt;ref&gt;Finamore and Houston 2010: 124-131&lt;/ref&gt; Human and animal bones were decorated with incised symbols and scenes. A collection of small and modified, tubular bones from an 8th-century royal burial under [[Tikal Temple I]] contains some of the most subtle engravings known from the Maya, including several scenes with the [[Maya maize god|Tonsured maize god]] in a canoe.&lt;ref&gt;Trik 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied arts and body decoration==
{{see also|Maya textiles}}
Textiles from the Classic period, made of cotton, have not survived, but Maya art provides detailed information about their appearance and, to a lesser extent, their social function.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2000&lt;/ref&gt; They include delicate fabrics used as wrappings, curtains and canopies furnishing palaces, and garments. Among the dyeing techniques may have been [[ikat]]. Daily costume depended on social standing. Noblewomen usually wore long dresses, noblemen girdles and breechcloths, leaving legs and upper body more or less bare, unless jackets or mantles were worn. Both men and women could wear turbans. Costumes worn on ceremonial occasions and during the many festivities were highly expressive and exuberant; animal headdresses were common. The most elaborate costume was the formal apparel of the king, as depicted on the royal stelae, with numerous elements of symbolic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Dillon and Christensen 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Wickerwork, only known from incidental depictions in sculptural and ceramic art,&lt;ref&gt;Reents-Budet 1994: 331&lt;/ref&gt; must once have been ubiquitous; the well-known ''pop'' ('mat') motif testifies to its importance.&lt;ref&gt;Robicsek 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Body decorations often consisted of painted patterns on face and body, but could also be of a permanent character marking status and age differences. The latter type included artificial deformation of the skull, filing and incrustation of the teeth, and tattooing of the face.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2006: 18-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum collections==
[[File:Nationalmuseum für Archäologie und Ethnologie, Guatemala-20.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología]], in [[Guatemala City]]]]
There are a great many museums across the world with Maya artifacts in their collections. The [[Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies]] lists over 250 museums in its Maya Museum database,&lt;ref&gt;Ros.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Association of Mayanists]] lists just under 50 museums in Europe alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wayeb.org/resources-links/museums-collections/|title=Museums &amp; Collections - Wayeb|author=|date=|website=wayeb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mexico City]], the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)|Museo Nacional de Antropología]] contains an especially large selection of Maya artifacts.&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p451"&gt;Wagner 2011, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of regional museums in Mexico hold important collections, including the [[Museo de las Estelas "Román Piña Chan"]] in [[Campeche, Campeche|Campeche]],&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p450"/&gt; the [[Museo Regional de Yucatán "Palacio Cantón"]] in [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]], and the [[Museo Regional de Antropología "Carlos Pellicer Camera"]] in [[Villahermosa]], Tabasco.&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p452"&gt;Wagner 2011, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important museum collections in Guatemala are those of the [[Museo Popol Vuh]] and the [[Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología]], both in [[Guatemala City]].&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p451"/&gt; Notable museums with collections of Maya artifacts include the [[British Museum]] in [[London]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]], the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], and the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]. The [[Museum of Cultures (Basel)|Museum der Kulturen]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], holds a number of wooden lintels from Tikal; the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin|Ethnologisches Museum]] in [[Berlin]] holds a broad selection of Maya artifacts. In [[Belgium]], the [[Royal Museums of Art and History|Musées royaux d'art et d'histoire]] in [[Brussels]] houses an important collection.&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p450"&gt;Wagner 2011, p. 450.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago]] contains a notable selection of Maya ceramics,&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p450"/&gt; while the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] in [[Ohio]] has one of the most extensive Maya collections in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p451"/&gt; The [[Museum of the Americas (Madrid)|Museo de América]] in [[Madrid]] hosts a large selection of artifacts from Palenque; it is also home to the Madrid Codex.&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p452"/&gt; Other notable European museums are the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde]] in [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]], home to the Leyden Plate, and the [[Rietberg Museum]] in [[Zürich]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p452"/&gt;

'''Anno Lucis''' (“in the Year of Light”) is a dating system used in [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] ceremonial or commemorative proceedings, which is equivalent to the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian year]] plus 4000. It is similar to ''[[Anno Mundi]]''.

==Description==
For example, a date [[Anno Domini]] (A.D.) {{currentyear}} becomes Anno Lucis (A.L.) {{#expr:{{currentyear}}+4000}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url= http://www.freemasonry.london.museum/resources/your-questions-answered/# | title = What is the Masonic Calendar? | author = | accessdate = 2006-07-06 | publisher = Library and Museum Charitable Trust of the United Grand Lodge of England}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[calendar era]], which would designate 4001&amp;nbsp;[[Before Common Era|BCE]] as '[[year zero]]', was adopted in the 18th century as a simplification of the ''Anno Mundi'' era dating system used in the [[Hebrew calendar]] and borrowing from other ideas of that time regarding the [[Dating creation|year of creation]].

After the [[Masoretic]] text was published, dating creation around 4000 BC became common, and it was received with wide support.&lt;ref&gt;''A Collation of the Sacred Scriptures'', Charles Roger Dundee, 1847, pp. 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed calculations of the date of creation, using the Masoretic from the 10th century to the 18th century, were numerous and fluctuated by many decades.&lt;ref name=Jones26&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wsITeHwP9K0C&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q=%22date+of+creation%22+%22no+dispute%22&amp;f=false |title=Chronology of the Old Testament: Solving the Bible's Most Intriguing Mysteries |author=Floyd Nolen Jones |publisher=New Leaf Publishing Group |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-89051-416-0 |page=26 |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, [[Isaac Newton]]'s calculation pointed at the year 4000 BC.&lt;ref name=Jones26/&gt; 

Among the Masoretic creation estimates or calculations for the date of creation, [[Ussher chronology|Archbishop Ussher's specific chronology]] dating the creation to 4004 BC became the most accepted and popular in Christendom, mainly because this specific date was attached to the [[King James Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/ussher.html |title=Bishop James Ussher Sets the Date for Creation: October 23, 4004 B.C |publisher=Law2.umkc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew Calendar has traditionally, since the 4th century AD by [[Hillel II]], dated the creation to 3761 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.net/jewish+calendar |title=Definition of Jewish Calendar from |publisher=dictionary.net |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askelm.com/doctrine/d911001.htm |title=The Jewish Calendar and Biblical Authority |publisher=Askelm.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117074827/http://askelm.com/doctrine/d911001.htm |archivedate=2013-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the ''[[Seder Olam Rabbah]]'' compiled by [[Jose ben Halafta]] in AD 160, and in agreement with ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]'', in which the Muslim chronologist [[al-Biruni]] identifies ''anno mundi'' as 3448 years before the [[Seleucid era]] but not with ''[[Seder Olam Zutta]]'', which dates it to 4339 BC and was compiled in AD 804.&lt;ref&gt;Young's Analytical Concordance of the Holy Bible, 1879, 8th Edition, 1939—entry under 'Creation', quoting Dr. William Hales New Analysis of Chronology and Geography, History and Prophecy, Vol. 1, 1830, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4852">[[Image:Chinface.jpg|300px|thumb]] A rare esemplare of a chinface.

A '''chinface''', sometimes referred to as a '''chinikin''', '''chinhead''', '''chinman''', or '''chinmonster''' is a [[performance]], usually of a [[comedy|comical]] nature, involving someone's chin. By drawing or attaching eyes, it gives the impression of a distorted face when viewed upside down.

==Origins==
In the early 1950s ventriloquist [[Paul Winchell]] created a chin face character named Oswald [https://books.google.com/books?id=VVYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=oswald+paul+winchell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BUHA3YUivG&amp;sig=PK9jb1tsgkTITv_G3QZeipgfOzE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwDmoVChMItfOgue2XyAIVgS6ICh3E1Qo_#v=onepage&amp;q=oswald%20paul%20winchell&amp;f=false.]

In 1964, [[Bob Denver]] performed a chin face in the [[beach party film]], "[https://archive.is/20060327025828/http://www.bobdenver.com/Big_Screen_Bob/For_Those_Who_Think_Young/for_those_who_think_young.html For Those Who Think Young]".

In 1988, McEwans Lager launched a new TV ad campaign featuring 'The Chinheads', a fictional and quirky 'upside-down' rock/soul band. The award-winning TV advert was directed by [[Steve Barron]] (director of [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Billie Jean]]", [[A-Ha]]'s "[[Take on Me]]", and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'') and featured the track "Something So Real" by Scottish band, [[The Love Decree]].

In 1989, a single was subsequently released and charted nationally, peaking at No.61 (No.1, Outselling [[Black Box (band)|Black Box]]'s "[[Ride On Time]]" in Scotland).
The Love Decree were: Robin Gow (Keyboards/Songwriter), Grant Macintosh (Vocals/Songwriter) and Gordon Gow (Percussion). The track 'Something So Real" was produced by Robin Gow.

The 'Chinheads' TV Ad can be viewed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wRBBzOqafE Here]

[[Ben Elton]]'s 1990 television show ''[[The Man from Auntie]]'' featured several chinface performances.

In 1993, an episode of ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', "Gunmen of the Apocalypse", Lister used a chinface when the crew had to convince a ship of simulants (artificially created, [[cyborg]] humanoids) that there were no humans aboard, insisting instead that the ship was crewed by curry-based lifeforms known as "[[Vindaloo]]vians".

==Popular culture==
Since [[video hosting]] sites have become available on the [[internet]], chinface videos have become increasingly common.

In the mid&amp;ndash;1990s, [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] [[Canada]] released TV ads for [[Kraft Dinner]] featuring various people performing chinfaces and eating the product.

The [[video game]] ''[[You Don't Know Jack (franchise)|You Don't Know Jack]]'' featured as an ending to Volume 4 ''(The Ride)'' footage showing part of the hosts' faces. The character Guy Towers is portrayed as a chin face, with oversized glasses.

Disc 4 of the ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' DVD Box Set features [[Chris Pontius]] performing a chinface of a "Latvian Gangster" during a running of the [[Gumball 3000]].

[[They Might Be Giants]]' first video, for their song "[[Put Your Hand Inside the Puppet Head]]," features one of them doing the chinface, with a xeroxed picture of his eyes placed on his chin.

In the video for [[Weird Al Yankovic]]'s style-parody of [[Devo]], his band is shown several times as chinfaces wearing Devo's yellow tyvek suits.

In the [[Monstrosity (film)|Atomic Brain]] episode of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', [[Mike Nelson (character)|Mike Nelson]] demonstrates to the 'bots a "chin face".  He says that the tradition is "fun...whimsical"; [[Crow T. Robot|Crow]] counters that it is "odd and disturbing".

In ''[[The Nanny]]'', Fran and Gracie enter a Mother-Daughter beauty pageant, for the talent competition both sang a song as chin faces.

In the popular French film ''[[Amélie]]'', the main character is shown in a scene performing chinface.

In ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'', one of Gumball's classmates, Sussie, is a chin face puppet, as are her parents.

In ''[[Jackass 3D]]'', [[Chris Pontius]] performs a chinface of a barbarian as part of the stunt "Pontius the barbarian"

In the YouTube channel The 298Universe, one of the main characters, Bob Cumberland, is a chinkin puppet. He is known as simply, Bob the Chinkin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2841">[[File:Hillemacher-Surville.JPG|thumb|1853 painting of Clotilde de Surville by [[Eugène Ernest Hillemacher]].]]
'''"Clotilde de Surville"''' was the supposed author of the ''Poésies de Clotilde''. The generally accepted legend gave the following account of her:
==Life==
Marguerite-Éléonore Clotilde de Vallon-Chalys, dame de Surville, was born in the early years of the 15th century at [[Vallon]]. In 1421 she married [[Berenger de Surville]], who was killed at the [[Siege of Orléans]] in 1428. Her husband's absence at the war inspired her heroic verses and his death her elegiac poems. The last of her poems is a ''chant royal'' addressed to [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1803 [[Charles Vanderbourg]] published as the ''Poésies de Clotilde'' some forty poems dealing with love and war. The history given in the introduction of the discovery of the manuscript was evidently a fable, and the poems were set down by most authorities as forgeries, especially as they contained many [[anachronism]]s and were written in accordance with modern laws of [[Prosody (poetry)|prosody]]. The manuscript had been in the possession of [[Jean François Marie, marquis de Surville]], an ''Émigré'' who returned to France in 1798 to raise an insurrection in [[Provence]], and had paid the penalty with his life.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1863 [[Antonin Mace]] made further inquiries on the subject and discovered letters from Vanderbourg to Surville's widow. This correspondence makes it clear that Vanderbourg was innocent of forgery and believed that the poems were of 15th century date, and that the anachronisms of matter and form were due to retouching by Surville. But the researches of Mace interested local antiquarians, and documentary evidence was produced that the wife of Berenger de Surville was Marguerite Chalis, not Clotilde, and that the marriage dated only from 1428. Moreover, Berenger, whose death at the siege of Orléans was one of the leading motives of the book, lived for twenty years after that date. Friends of M. de Surville also disclosed the fact that the marquis had contributed archaic poetry to a [[Lausanne]] journal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

{{not a typo|'''Comics''' is}} a [[Media (communication)|medium]] used to express ideas by images, often combined with text or other visual information.  Comics frequently {{not a typo|takes}} the form of juxtaposed sequences of [[Panel (comics)|panels]] of images.  Often textual devices such as [[speech balloon]]s, captions, and [[onomatopoeia]] indicate dialogue, narration, sound effects, or other information.  Size and arrangement of panels contribute to narrative pacing.  [[Cartooning]] and similar forms of illustration are the most common image-making means in comics; ''[[Photonovel|fumetti]]'' is a form which uses photographic images.  Common forms of comics include [[comic strip]]s, [[Editorial cartoon|editorial]] and [[gag cartoon]]s, and [[comic book]]s.  Since the late 20th century, bound volumes such as [[graphic novel]]s, [[comic album]]s, and ''{{transl|ja|[[tankōbon]]}}'' have become increasingly common, while online [[webcomic]]s have proliferated in the 21st century.

The [[history of comics]] has followed different paths in different cultures.  Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the [[Lascaux|Lascaux cave paintings]].  By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially [[Franco-Belgian comics|in France and Belgium]]), and Japan.  The history of [[European comics]] is often traced to [[Rodolphe Töpffer]]'s cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''.  [[History of American comics|American comics]] emerged as a [[Mass media|mass medium]] in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style [[American comic book|comic book]]s followed in the 1930s, in which the [[superhero]] genre became prominent after [[Superman]] appeared in 1938.  [[History of manga|Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning]] (''{{transl|ja|[[manga]]}}'') propose origins as early as the 12th century.  Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War&amp;nbsp;II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as [[Osamu Tezuka]].  {{not a typo|Comics has}} had a [[Low culture|lowbrow]] reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.

The English term ''comics'' is used as a singular noun when it refers to the medium and a plural when referring to particular instances, such as individual strips or comic books.  Though the term derives from the humorous (or ''[[wikt:comic|comic]]'') work that predominated in early American newspaper comic strips, it has become standard also for non-humorous works.  It is common in English to refer to the comics of different cultures by the terms used in their original languages, such as ''{{transl|ja|manga}}'' for Japanese comics, or ''{{lang|fr|bandes dessinées}}'' for French-language comics.  There is no consensus amongst theorists and historians on a definition of comics; some emphasize the combination of images and text, some sequentiality or other image relations, and others historical aspects such as mass reproduction or the use of recurring characters.  The increasing cross-pollination of concepts from different comics cultures and eras has further made definition difficult.

Outcault]]'s 1890s newspaper strip ''[[The Yellow Kid]]'', though many Americans have come to recognize Töpffer's precedence.{{sfnm|1a1=Gabilliet|1y=2010|1p=xiv|2a1=Beerbohm|2y=2003|3a1=Sabin|3y=2005|3p=186|4a1=Rowland|4y=1990|4p=13}}  Japan had a long prehistory of satirical cartoons and comics leading up to the World War&amp;nbsp;II era.  The [[ukiyo-e]] artist [[Hokusai]] popularized the Japanese term for comics and cartooning, ''{{transl|ja|[[manga]]}}'', in the early 19th century.{{sfnm|1a1=Petersen|1y=2010|1p=41|2a1=Power|2y=2009|2p=24|3a1=Gravett|3y=2004|3p=9}}  In the post-war era modern Japanese comics began to flourish when [[Osamu Tezuka]] produced a prolific body of work.{{sfnm|1a1=Couch|1y=2000|2a1=Petersen|2y=2010|2p=175}}  Towards the close of the 20th century, these three traditions converged in a trend towards book-length comics: the [[comic album]] in Europe, the {{transl|ja|[[tankōbon]]}}{{efn|{{nihongo|tankōbon|単行本|extra=translation close to "independently appearing book"}}}} in Japan, and the [[graphic novel]] in the English-speaking countries.{{sfn|Couch|2000}}

Outside of these genealogies, comics theorists and historians have seen precedents for comics in the [[Lascaux|Lascaux cave paintings]]{{sfnm|1a1=Gabilliet|1y=2010|1p=xiv|2a1=Barker|2y=1989|2p=6|3a1=Groensteen|3y=2014|4a1=Grove|4y=2010|4p=59|5a1=Beaty|5y=2012|p=32|6a1=Jobs|6y=2012|6p=98}} in France (some of which appear to be chronological sequences of images), [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], [[Trajan's Column]] in Rome,{{sfn|Gabilliet|2010|p=xiv}} the 11th-century Norman [[Bayeux Tapestry]],{{sfnm|1a1=Gabilliet|1y=2010|1p=xiv|2a1=Beaty|2y=2012|2p=61|3a1=Grove|3y=2010|3pp=16, 21, 59}} the 1370 ''{{lang|fr|[[bois Protat]]}}'' woodcut, the 15th-century ''{{lang|la|[[Ars moriendi]]}}'' and [[block book]]s, Michelangelo's ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' in the Sistine Chapel,{{sfn|Gabilliet|2010|p=xiv}} and [[William Hogarth]]'s 18th-century sequential engravings,{{sfn|Grove|2010|p=79}} amongst others.{{sfn|Gabilliet|2010|p=xiv}}{{efn|David Kunzle has compiled extensive collections of these and other proto-comics in his ''The Early Comic Strip'' (1973) and ''The History of the Comic Strip'' (1990).{{sfn|Beaty|2012|p=62}} }}

===English-language comics===

{{main article|British comics|History of American comics|American comic book}}

Illustrated humour periodicals were popular in 19th-century Britain, the earliest of which was the short-lived ''[[The Glasgow Looking Glass]]'' in 1825.  The most popular was ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'',{{sfn|Clark|Clark|1991|p=17}} which popularized the term ''cartoon'' for its humorous caricatures.{{sfn|Harvey|2001|p=77}}  On occasion the cartoons in these magazines appeared in sequences;{{sfn|Clark|Clark|1991|p=17}} the character [[Ally Sloper]] featured in the earliest serialized comic strip when the character began to feature in its own weekly magazine in 1884.{{sfn|Meskin|Cook|2012|p=xxii}}

American comics developed out of such magazines as ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]'', and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''.  The success of illustrated humour supplements in the ''[[New York World]]'' and later the ''[[New York American]]'', particularly Outcault's ''The Yellow Kid'', led to the development of newspaper comic strips.  Early [[Sunday comics|Sunday strips]] were full-page{{sfn|Nordling|1995|p=123}} and often in colour.  Between 1896 and 1901 cartoonists experimented with sequentiality, movement, and speech balloons.{{sfn|Gordon|2002|p=35}}

Shorter, black-and-white daily strips began to appear early in the 20th century, and became established in newspapers after the success in 1907 of [[Bud Fisher]]'s ''[[Mutt and Jeff]]''.{{sfn|Harvey|1994|p=11}} In Britain, the [[Amalgamated Press]] established a popular style of a sequence of images with text beneath them, including ''[[Illustrated Chips]]'' and ''[[Comic Cuts]]''.{{sfn|Bramlett|Cook|Meskin|2016|p=45}} Humour strips predominated at first, and in the 1920s and 1930s strips with continuing stories in genres such as adventure and drama also became popular.{{sfn|Harvey|1994|p=11}}

Thin periodicals called [[American comic book|comic books]] appeared in the 1930s, at first reprinting newspaper comic strips; by the end of the decade, original content began to dominate.{{sfn|Rhoades|2008|p=2}}  The success in 1938 of ''[[Action Comics]]'' and its lead hero [[Superman]] marked the beginning of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], in which the [[Superhero comics|superhero genre]] was prominent.{{sfn|Rhoades|2008|p=x}} In the UK and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], the [[DC Thomson]]-created ''[[The Dandy|Dandy]]'' (1937) and ''[[The Beano|Beano]]'' (1938) became successful humor-based titles, with a combined circulation of over 2 million copies by the 1950s. Their characters, including "[[Dennis the Menace (UK)|Dennis the Menace]]", "[[Desperate Dan]]" and "[[The Bash Street Kids]]" have been read by generations of British schoolboys.{{sfn|Childs|Storry|2013|p=532}} The comics originally experimented with superheroes and action stories before settling on humorous strips featuring a mix of the Amalgamated Press and US comic book styles.{{sfn|Bramlett|Cook|Meskin|2016|p=46}}

[[File:WonderworldComics3.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=|[[Superhero comics|Superheroes]] have been a staple of [[American comic book]]s (''Wonderworld Comics'' {{No.}}3, 1939; cover: [[Flame (comics)|The Flame]] by [[Will Eisner]]).]]

The popularity of superhero comic books declined following World War&amp;nbsp;II,{{sfn|Gabilliet|2010|p=51}} while comic book sales continued to increase as other genres proliferated, such as [[Romance comics|romance]], [[Western comics|westerns]], [[Crime comics|crime]], [[Horror comics|horror]], and humour.{{sfn|Gabilliet|2010|p=49}}  Following a sales peak in the early 1950s, the content of comic books (particularly crime and horror) was subjected to scrutiny from parent groups and government agencies, which culminated in [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency|Senate hearings]] that led to the establishment of the [[Comics Code Authority]] self-censoring body.{{sfn|Gabilliet|2010|pp=49–50}}  The Code has been blamed for stunting the growth of American comics and maintaining its low status in American society for much of the remainder of the century.{{sfn|Gabilliet|2010|p=50}}  Superheroes re-established themselves as the most prominent comic book genre by the early 1960s.{{sfn|Gabilliet|2010|pp=52–55}}  [[Underground comix]] challenged the Code and readers with adult, countercultural content in the late 1960s and early 1970s.{{sfn|Gabilliet|2010|p=66}}  The underground gave birth to the [[alternative comics]] movement in the 1980s and its mature, often experimental content in non-superhero genres.{{sfnm|1a1=Hatfield|1y=2005|1pp=20, 26|2a1=Lopes|2y=2009|2p=123|3a1=Rhoades|3y=2008|3p=140}}

Comics in the US has had a [[Low culture|lowbrow]] reputation stemming from its roots in [[mass culture]]; cultural elites sometimes saw popular culture as threatening culture and society.  In the latter half of the 20th century, popular culture won greater acceptance, and the lines between high and low culture began to blur.  Comics nevertheless continued to be stigmatized, as the medium was seen as entertainment for children and illiterates.{{sfn|Lopes|2009|pp=xx–xxi}}

The [[graphic novel]]—book-length comics—began to gain attention after [[Will Eisner]] popularized the term with his book ''[[A Contract with God]]'' (1978).{{sfn|Petersen|2010|p=222}}  The term became widely known with the public after the commercial success of ''[[Maus]]'', ''[[Watchmen]]'', and ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' in the mid-1980s.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2008|1p=172|2a1=Sabin|2y=1993|2p=246|3a1=Stringer|3y=1996|3p=262|4a1=Ahrens|4a2=Meteling|4y=2010|4p=1|5a1=Williams|5a2=Lyons|5y=2010|5p=7}}  In the 21st century graphic novels became established in mainstream bookstores{{sfn|Gabilliet|2010|pp=210–211}} and libraries{{sfn|Lopes|2009|p=151–152}} and webcomics became common.{{sfn|Thorne|2010|p=209}}

===Franco-Belgian and European comics===

{{main article|European comics|Franco-Belgian comics}}

The francophone Swiss [[Rodolphe Töpffer]] produced comic strips beginning in 1827,{{sfn|Gabilliet|2010|p=xiv}} and published theories behind the form.{{sfn|Harvey|2010}}  Cartoons appeared widely in newspapers and magazines from the 19th century.{{sfn|Lefèvre|2010|p=186}}  The success of ''[[Zig et Puce]]'' in 1925 popularized the use of speech balloons in European comics, after which Franco-Belgian comics began to dominate.{{sfnm|1a1=Vessels|1y=2010|1p=45|2a1=Miller|2y=2007|2p=17}}  ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', with its signature [[Ligne claire|clear line]] style,{{sfnm|1a1=Screech|1y=2005|1p=27|2a1=Miller|2y=2007|2p=18}} was first serialized in newspaper comics supplements beginning in 1929,{{sfn|Miller|2007|p=17}} and became an icon of Franco-Belgian comics.{{sfnm|1a1=Theobald|1y=2004|1p=82|2a1=Screech|2y=2005|2p=48|3a1=McKinney|3y=2011|3p=3}}

Following the success of {{lang|fr|[[Le Journal de Mickey]]}} (1934–44),{{sfn|Grove|2005|pp=76–78}} dedicated comics magazines{{sfnm|1a1=Petersen|1y=2010|1pp=214–215|2a1=Lefèvre|2y=2010|2p=186}} and full-colour comic albums became the primary outlet for comics in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Petersen|2010|pp=214–215}}  As in the US, at the time comics were seen as infantile and a threat to culture and literacy; commentators stated that "none bear up to the slightest serious analysis",{{efn|{{lang-fr|"...&amp;nbsp;aucune ne supporte une analyse un peu serieuse."}}&amp;nbsp;– Jacqueline &amp; Raoul Dubois in {{lang|fr|La Presse enfantine française}} (Midol, 1957){{sfn|Grove|2005|p=46}} }} and that comics were "the sabotage of all art and all literature".{{sfn|Grove|2005|pp=45–46}}{{efn|{{lang-fr|"C'est le sabotage de tout art et de toute littérature."}}&amp;nbsp;– Jean de Trignon in {{lang|fr|Histoires de la littérature enfantine de ma Mère l'Oye au Roi Babar}} ([[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]], 1950){{sfn|Grove|2005|p=46}} }}



In the 1960s, the term ''{{lang|fr|bandes dessinées}}'' ("drawn strips") came into wide use in French to denote the medium.{{sfn|Grove|2005|p=51}}  Cartoonists began creating comics for mature audiences,{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=1998|1p=116|2a1=Lefèvre|2y=2010|2p=186}} and the term "Ninth Art"{{efn|{{lang-fr|neuvième art}} }} was coined, as comics began to attract public and academic attention as an artform.{{sfn|Miller|2007|p=23}}  A group including [[René Goscinny]] and [[Albert Uderzo]] founded the magazine ''[[Pilote]]'' in 1959 to give artists greater freedom over their work.  Goscinny and Uderzo's ''[[Asterix|The Adventures of Asterix]]'' appeared in it{{sfn|Miller|2007|p=21}} and went on to become the best-selling French-language comics series.{{sfn|Screech|2005|p=204}}  From 1960, the satirical and taboo-breaking ''[[Hara-Kiri (magazine)|Hara-Kiri]]'' defied censorship laws in the countercultural spirit that led to the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 events]].{{sfn|Miller|2007|p=22}}

Frustration with censorship and editorial interference led to a group of ''Pilote'' cartoonists to found the adults-only ''[[L'Écho des savanes]]'' in 1972.  Adult-oriented and experimental comics flourished in the 1970s, such as in the experimental science fiction of [[Jean Giraud|Mœbius]] and others in ''[[Métal hurlant]]'', even mainstream publishers took to publishing prestige-format adult comics.{{sfn|Miller|2007|pp=25–28}}

From the 1980s, mainstream sensibilities were reasserted and serialization became less common as the number of comics magazines decreased and many comics began to be published directly as albums.{{sfn|Miller|2007|pp=33–34}}  Smaller publishers such as [[L'Association]]{{sfn|Beaty|2007|p=9}} that published longer works{{sfn|Lefèvre|2010|pp=189–190}} in non-traditional formats{{sfn|Grove|2005|p=153}} by ''[[Auteur theory|auteur]]''-istic creators also became common.  Since the 1990s, mergers resulted in fewer large publishers, while smaller publishers proliferated.  Sales overall continued to grow despite the trend towards a shrinking print market.{{sfn|Miller|2007|pp=49–53}}

===Japanese comics===

{{main article|History of manga}}

[[File:Tagosaku to Mokube no Tokyo Kenbutsu.jpg|thumb|alt=|[[Rakuten Kitazawa]] created the first modern Japanese comic strip. (''Tagosaku to Mokube no Tōkyō Kenbutsu'',{{efn|{{Nihongo|''Tagosaku and Mokube Sightseeing in Tokyo''|''田吾作と杢兵衛の東京見物''|''Tagosaku to Mokube no Tokyo Kenbutsu''|lead=yes}} }} 1902)]]

Japanese comics and cartooning (''{{transl|ja|[[manga]]}}''),{{efn|{{Nihongo|''"Manga"''|漫画||lead=yes}} can be [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]ed in many ways, amongst them "whimsical pictures", "disreputable pictures",{{sfn|Karp|Kress|2011|p=19}} "irresponsible pictures",{{sfn|Gravett|2004|p=9}} "derisory pictures", and "sketches made for or out of a sudden inspiration".{{sfn|Johnson-Woods|2010|p=22}} }} have a history that has been seen as far back as the anthropomorphic characters in the 12th-to-13th-century ''{{transl|ja|[[Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga]]}}'', 17th-century ''{{transl|ja|[[toba-e]]}}'' and ''{{transl|ja|[[kibyōshi]]}}'' picture books,{{sfn|Schodt|1996|p=22}} and [[Woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] such as [[ukiyo-e]] which were popular between the 17th and 20th centuries.  The ''{{transl|ja|kibyōshi}}'' contained examples of sequential images, movement lines,{{sfn|Mansfield|2009|p=253}} and sound effects.{{sfn|Petersen|2010|p=42}}

Illustrated magazines for Western expatriates introduced Western-style satirical cartoons to Japan in the late 19th century.  New publications in both the Western and Japanese styles became popular, and at the end of the 1890s, American-style newspaper comics supplements began to appear in Japan,{{sfn|Johnson-Woods|2010|pp=21–22}} as well as some American comic strips.{{sfn|Schodt|1996|p=22}}  1900 saw the debut of the ''Jiji Manga'' in the ''Jiji Shinpō'' newspaper—the first use of the word "manga" in its modern sense,{{sfn|Johnson-Woods|2010|p=22}} and where, in 1902, [[Rakuten Kitazawa]] began the first modern Japanese comic strip.{{sfnm|1a1=Petersen|1y=2010|1p=128|2a1=Gravett|2y=2004|2p=21}}  By the 1930s, comic strips were serialized in large-circulation monthly girls' and boys' magazine and collected into hardback volumes.{{sfnm|1a1=Schodt|1y=1996|1p=22|2a1=Johnson-Woods|2y=2010|2pp=23–24}}

The modern era of comics in Japan began after World War II, propelled by the success of the serialized comics of the prolific [[Osamu Tezuka]]{{sfn|Gravett|2004|p=24}} and the comic strip ''[[Sazae-san]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=MacWilliams|1y=2008|1p=3|2a1=Hashimoto|2a2=Traphagan|2y=2008|2p=21|3a1=Sugimoto|3y=2010|3p=255|4a1=Gravett|4y=2004|4p=8}}  Genres and audiences diversified over the following decades.  Stories are usually first serialized in magazines which are often hundreds of pages thick and may contain over a dozen stories;{{sfnm|1a1=Schodt|1y=1996|1p=23|2a1=Gravett|2y=2004|2pp=13–14}} they are later compiled in ''{{transl|ja|[[tankōbon]]}}''-format books.{{sfn|Gravett|2004|p=14}}  At the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, nearly a quarter of all printed material in Japan was comics.{{sfnm|1a1=Brenner|1y=2007|1p=13|2a1=Lopes|2y=2009|2p=152|3a1=Raz|3y=1999|3p=162|4a1=Jenkins|4y=2004|4p=121}} Translations became extremely popular in foreign markets—in some cases equaling or surpassing the sales of domestic comics.{{sfn|Lee|2010|p=158}}

==Forms and formats==

[[Comic strip]]s are generally short, multipanel comics that traditionally most commonly appeared in newspapers.  In the US, daily strips have normally occupied a single tier, while [[Sunday comics|Sunday strips]] have been given multiple tiers.  In the early 20th century, daily strips were typically in black-and-white and Sundays were usually in colour and often occupied a full page.{{sfn|Booker|2014|p=xxvi–xxvii}}

Specialized comics periodicals formats vary greatly in different cultures.  [[Comic book]]s, primarily an American format, are thin periodicals{{sfnm|1a1=Orr|1y=2008|1p=11|2a1=Collins|2y=2010|2p=227}} usually published in colour.{{sfn|Orr|2008|p=10}}  European and Japanese comics are frequently serialized in magazines—monthly or weekly in Europe,{{sfn|Johnson-Woods|2010|p=22}} and usually black-and-white and weekly in Japan.{{sfnm|1a1=Schodt|1y=1996|1p=23|2a1=Orr|2y=2008|2p=10}}  Japanese comics magazine typically run to hundreds of pages.{{sfn|Schodt|1996|p=23}}

The right group of [[graphic novel]]s is from English-speaking countries, where there is no standard format.}}

Book-length comics take different forms in different cultures. European [[comic albums]] are most commonly printed in [[ISO 216#A4 series|A4-size]]{{sfnm|1a1=Grove|1y=2010|1p=24|2a1=McKinney|2y=2011|p={{not a typo|xiii}}}} colour volumes.{{sfn|Petersen|2010|pp=214–215}} In English-speaking countries, the [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] format originating from collected comic books have also been chosen for original material. Otherwise, bound volumes of comics are called graphic novels and are available in various formats. Despite incorporating the term "novel"—a term normally associated with fiction—"graphic novel" also refers to non-fiction and collections of short works.{{sfnm|1a1=Goldsmith|1y=2005|1p=16|2a1=Karp|2a2=Kress|2y=2011|2pp=4–6}}  Japanese comics are collected in volumes called ''[[tankōbon]]'' following magazine serialization.{{sfn|Poitras|2001|p=66–67}}

[[Gag cartoon|Gag]] and [[editorial cartoon]]s usually consist of a single panel, often incorporating a caption or speech balloon.  Definitions of comics which emphasize sequence usually exclude gag, editorial, and other single-panel cartoons; they can be included in definitions that emphasize the combination of word and image.{{sfn|Harvey|2001|p=76}}  Gag cartoons first began to proliferate in [[broadsheet]]s published in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the term "cartoon"{{efn|"[[wikt:cartoon|cartoon]]": from the Italian {{lang|it|cartone}}, meaning "card", which referred to the cardboard on which the cartoons were typically drawn.{{sfn|Harvey|2001|p=77}} }} was first used to describe them in 1843 in the British humour magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.{{sfn|Harvey|2001|p=77}}

[[Webcomic]]s are comics that are available on the internet.  They are able to reach large audiences, and new readers usually can access archived installments.{{sfn|Petersen|2010|pp=234–236}}  Webcomics can make use of an [[infinite canvas]]—meaning they are not constrained by size or dimensions of a page.{{sfnm|1a1=Petersen|1y=2010|1p=234|2a1=McCloud|2y=2000|2p=222}}

Some consider [[storyboard]]s{{sfn|Rhoades|2008|p=38}} and [[wordless novel]]s to be comics.{{sfn|Beronä|2008|p=225}}  Film studios, especially in animation, often use sequences of images as guides for film sequences.  These storyboards are not intended as an end product and are rarely seen by the public.{{sfn|Rhoades|2008|p=38}}  Wordless novels are books which use sequences of captionless images to deliver a narrative.{{sfn|Cohen|1977|p=181}}

&lt;!-- ''Note: Although it takes the form of a plural noun, the common usage when referring to ''comics'' as a medium is to treat it as singular.'' --&gt;

{{quote box|"Comics&amp;nbsp;... are sometimes four-legged and sometimes two-legged and sometimes fly and sometimes don't&amp;nbsp;... to employ a metaphor as mixed as the medium itself, defining comics entails cutting a Gordian-knotted enigma wrapped in a mystery&amp;nbsp;..."|source=[[R.

Similar to the problems of defining literature and film,{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|pp=128—129}} no consensus has been reached on a definition of the comics medium,{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=124}} and attempted definitions and descriptions have fallen prey to numerous exceptions.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=126}}  Theorists such as Töpffer,{{sfn|Thomas|2010|p=158}} [[R. C. Harvey]], [[Will Eisner]],{{sfn|Beaty|2012|p=65}} David Carrier,{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|pp=126, 131}} Alain Rey,{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=124}} and Lawrence Grove emphasize the combination of text and images,{{sfn|Grove|2010|pp=17–19}} though there are prominent examples of pantomime comics throughout its history.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=126}}  Other critics, such as Thierry Groensteen{{sfn|Grove|2010|pp=17–19}} and Scott McCloud, have emphasized the primacy of sequences of images.{{sfn|Thomas|2010|pp=157, 170}}  Towards the close of the 20th century, different cultures' discoveries of each other's comics traditions, the rediscovery of forgotten early comics forms, and the rise of new forms made defining comics a more complicated task.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|pp=112–113}}

European comics studies began with Töpffer's theories of his own work in the 1840s, which emphasized panel transitions and the visual–verbal combination.  No further progress was made until the 1970s.{{sfn|Miller|2007|p=101}}  Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a [[semiotics]] approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed "closure".{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=112}}  In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term ''{{lang|fr|multicadre}}'', or "multiframe", to refer to the comics page as a semantic unit.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=113}}  By the 1990s, theorists such as [[Benoît Peeters]] and [[Thierry Groensteen]] turned attention to artists' [[Poiesis|poïetic]] creative choices.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=112}}  [[Thierry Smolderen]] and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history.  Morgan sees comics as a subset of "''{{lang|fr|les littératures dessinées}}''" (or "drawn literatures").{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|pp=112–113}}  French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=113}} Since the mid-2000s, [[Neil Cohn]] has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound "grammars" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.{{sfn|Cohn|2013}}

Historical narratives of ''manga'' tend to focus either on its recent, post-WWII history, or on attempts to demonstrates deep roots in the past, such as to the ''{{transl|ja|Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga}}'' picture scroll of the 12th and 13th centuries, or the early 19th-century ''Hokusai Manga''.{{sfn|Stewart|2014|pp=28–29}}  The first historical overview of Japanese comics was Seiki Hosokibara's {{transl|ja|Nihon Manga-Shi}}{{efn|{{cite book|last=Hosokibara|first=Seiki|trans-title=Japanese Comics History|title=日本漫画史|publisher=Yuzankaku|year=1924}} }} in 1924.{{sfnm|1a1=Johnson-Woods|1y=2010|1p=23|2a1=Stewart|2y=2014|2p=29}}  Early post-war Japanese criticism was mostly of a left-wing political nature until the 1986 publication of Tomofusa Kure's ''Modern Manga: The Complete Picture'',{{efn|{{cite book|first=Tomofusa|last=Kure|trans-title=Modern Manga: The Complete Picture|title=現代漫画の全体像|publisher=Joho Center Publishing|year=1986|isbn=978-4-575-71090-8}}{{sfn|Kinsella|2000|pp=96–97}} }} which de-emphasized politics in favour of formal aspects, such as structure and a "grammar" of comics.  The field of {{transl|ja|manga}} studies increased rapidly, with numerous books on the subject appearing in the 1990s.{{sfn|Kinsella|2000|pp=96–97}}  Formal theories of ''{{transl|ja|manga}}'' have focused on developing a "manga expression theory",{{efn|{{Nihongo|"Manga expression theory"|漫画表現論|manga hyōgenron|lead=yes}}{{sfn|Kinsella|2000|p=100}} }} with emphasis on spatial relationships in the structure of images on the page, distinguishing the medium from film or literature, in which the flow of time is the basic organizing element.{{sfn|Kinsella|2000|p=100}}  Comics studies courses have proliferated at Japanese universities, and {{Interlanguage link multi|Japan Society for Studies in Cartoon and Comics|ja|3=日本マンガ学会}}{{efn|{{Nihongo|Japan Society for Studies in Cartoon and Comics|日本マンガ学会|Nihon Manga Gakkai|lead=yes}} }} was established in 2001 to promote comics scholarship.{{sfn|Morita|2010|pp=37–38}}  The publication of [[Frederik L. Schodt]]'s ''[[Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics]]'' in 1983 led to the spread of use of the word ''manga'' outside Japan to mean "Japanese comics" or "Japanese-style comics".{{sfn|Stewart|2014|p=30}}

[[Coulton Waugh]] attempted the first comprehensive history of American comics with ''The Comics'' (1947).{{sfn|Inge|1989|p=214}}  Will Eisner's ''[[Comics and Sequential Art]]'' (1985) and [[Scott McCloud]]'s ''[[Understanding Comics]]'' (1993) were early attempts in English to formalize the study of comics.  David Carrier's ''The Aesthetics of Comics'' (2000) was the first full-length treatment of comics from a philosophical perspective.{{sfn|Meskin|Cook|2012|p=xxix}}  Prominent American attempts at definitions of comics include Eisner's, McCloud's, and Harvey's.  Eisner described what he called "[[sequential art]]" as "the arrangement of pictures or images and words to narrate a story or dramatize an idea";{{sfnm|1a1=Yuan|1y=2011|2a1=Eisner|2y=1985|2p=5}}  Scott McCloud defined comics as "juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer",{{sfnm|1a1=Kovacs|1a2=Marshall|1y=2011|1p=10|2a1=Holbo|2y=2012|2p=13|3a1=Harvey|3y=2010|3p=1|4a1=Beaty|4y=2012|4p=6|5a1=McCloud|5y=1993|5p=9}} a strictly formal definition which detached comics from its historical and cultural trappings.{{sfn|Beaty|2012|p=67}}  R.&amp;nbsp;C. Harvey defined comics as "pictorial narratives or expositions in which words (often lettered into the picture area within speech balloons) usually contribute to the meaning of the pictures and vice versa".{{sfnm|1a1=Chute|1y=2010|1p=7|2a1=Harvey|2y=2001|2p=76}}  Each definition has had its detractors.  Harvey saw McCloud's definition as excluding single-panel cartoons,{{sfn|Harvey|2010|p=1}}  and objected to McCloud's de-emphasizing verbal elements, insisting "the essential characteristic of comics is the incorporation of verbal content".{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=113}}  Aaron Meskin saw McCloud's theories as an artificial attempt to legitimize the place of comics in art history.{{sfn|Beaty|2012|p=65}}

Cross-cultural study of comics is complicated by the great difference in meaning and scope of the words for "comics" in different languages.{{sfn|Morita|2010|p=33}}  The French term for comics, ''{{lang|fr|bandes dessinées}}'' ("drawn strip") emphasizes the juxtaposition of drawn images as a defining factor,{{sfnm|1a1=Groensteen|1y=2012|1p=130|2a1=Morita|2y=2010|2p=33}} which can imply the exclusion of even photographic comics.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=130}}  The term ''{{transl|ja|manga}}'' is used in Japanese to indicate all forms of comics, cartooning,{{sfn|Johnson-Woods|2010|p=336}} and caricature.{{sfn|Morita|2010|p=33}}

==Terminology==

{{Main article|Glossary of comics terminology}}

The term ''comics'' refers to the comics medium when used as an [[uncountable noun]] and thus takes the singular: "comics ''is'' a medium" rather than "comics ''are'' a medium".  When ''comic'' appears as a countable noun it refers to instances of the medium, such as individual comic strips or comic books: "Tom's comics ''are'' in the basement."{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=2012|1p=8|2a1=Chute|2a2=DeKoven|2y=2012|2p=175|3a1=Fingeroth|3y=2008|3p=4}}

Panels are individual images containing a segment of action,{{sfn|Lee|1978|p=15}} often surrounded by a border.{{sfn|Eisner|1985|pp=28, 45}}  Prime moments in a narrative are broken down into panels via a process called encapsulation.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=10}}  The reader puts the pieces together via the process of closure by using background knowledge and an understanding of panel relations to combine panels mentally into events.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=316}}  The size, shape, and arrangement of panels each affect the timing and pacing of the narrative.{{sfn|Eisner|1985|p=30}}  The contents of a panel may be asynchronous, with events depicted in the same image not necessarily occurring at the same time.{{sfnm|1a1=Duncan|1a2=Smith|1y=2009|1p=315|2a1=Karp|2a2=Kress|2y=2011|2p=12–13}}

[[File:PunchandJudyComicsV01-0145-panel3.jpg|thumb|alt=A comics panel.  In the top left, a caption with a yellow background reads, "Suddenly the street is filled with angry people!"  In the main panel, anthropomorphic characters crowd a sidewalk.  A monkey, standing to the left on the road beside the curb, says, "Gosh!  Where'd all these people come from?"  An overweight male on the sidewalk in the middle facing right says to a police officer, "Hey!  My watch disappeared from my parlor!"  An female near the bottom right, says to a male in the bottom right corner, "My necklace!  It's gone from the table!!"|A caption (the yellow box) gives the narrator a voice.  The characters' dialogue appears in [[speech balloon]]s.  The tail of the balloon indicates the speaker.]]

Text is frequently incorporated into comics via [[speech balloon]]s, captions, and sound effects.  Speech balloons indicate dialogue (or thought, in the case of [[thought balloon]]s), with tails pointing at their respective speakers.{{sfnm|1a1=Lee|1y=1978|1p=15|2a1=Markstein|2y=2010|3a1=Eisner|3y=1985|3p=157|4a1=Dawson|4y=2010|4p=112|5a1=Saraceni|5y=2003|5p=9}}  Captions can give voice to a narrator, convey characters' dialogue or thoughts,{{sfnm|1a1=Lee|1y=1978|1p=15|2a1=Lyga|2a2=Lyga|2y=2004|p=161}} or indicate place or time.{{sfnm|1a1=Saraceni|1y=2003|1p=9|2a1=Karp|2a2=Kress|2y=2011|2p=18}}  Speech balloons themselves are strongly associated with comics, such that the addition of one to an image is sufficient to turn the image into comics.{{sfn|Forceville|Veale|Feyaerts|2010|p=56}}  Sound effects mimic non-vocal sounds textually using [[onomatopoeia]] sound-words.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2009|pp=156, 318}}

[[Cartooning]] is most frequently used in making comics, traditionally using ink (especially [[India ink]]) with [[dip pen]]s or ink brushes;{{sfnm|1a1=Markstein|1y=2010|2a1=Lyga|2a2=Lyga|2y=2004|2p=161|3a1=Lee|3y=1978|3p=145|4a1=Rhoades|4y=2008|4p=139}} mixed media and digital technology have become common.  Cartooning techniques such as [[motion lines]]{{sfnm|1a1=Bramlett|1y=2012|1p=25|2a1=Guigar|2y=2010|2p=126|3a1=Cates|3y=2010|3p=98}} and abstract symbols are often employed.{{sfnm|1a1=Goldsmith|1y=2005|1p=21|2a1=Karp|2a2=Kress|2y=2011|2p=13–14}}

While comics are often the work of a single creator, the labour of making them is frequently divided between a number of specialists.  There may be separate [[Comics writer|writers]] and [[Comics artist|artists]], and artists may specialize in parts of the artwork such as characters or backgrounds, as is common in Japan.{{sfn|O'Nale|2010|p=384}}  Particularly in American superhero comic books,{{sfn|Tondro|2011|p=51}} the art may be divided between a [[penciller]], who lays out the artwork in pencil;{{sfn|Lyga|Lyga|2004|p=161}} an [[inker]], who finishes the artwork in ink;{{sfnm|1a1=Markstein|1y=2010|2a1=Lyga|2a2=Lyga|2y=2004|2p=161|3a1=Lee|3y=1978|3p=145}} a [[Colorist|colourist]];{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=315}} and a [[letterer]], who adds the captions and speech balloons.{{sfn|Lyga|Lyga|2004|p=163}}

===Etymology===

The English-language term ''comics'' derives from the humorous (or "[[wikt:comic|comic]]") work which predominated in early American newspaper comic strips; usage of the term has become standard for non-humorous works as well.  The term "comic book" has a similarly confusing history: they are most often not humorous; nor are they regular books, but rather periodicals.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|loc=p. 131 (translator's note)}}  It is common in English to refer to the comics of different cultures by the terms used in their original languages, such as ''{{transl|ja|[[manga]]}}'' for Japanese comics, or ''{{lang|fr|bandes dessinées}}'' for French-language [[Franco-Belgian comics]].{{sfn|McKinney|2011|p=xiii}}

Many cultures have taken their words for comics from English, including Russian ({{lang|ru|Комикс}}, ''{{transl|ru|[[Russian comics|komiks]]}}''){{sfn|Alaniz|2010|p=7}} and German (''{{lang|de|[[German comics|comic]]}}'').{{sfn|Frahm|2003}}  Similarly, the Chinese term ''{{transl|zh|[[manhua]]}}''{{sfnm|1a1=Wong|1y=2002|1p=11|2a1=Cooper-Chen|2y=2010|2p=177}} and the Korean ''{{transl|ko|[[manhwa]]}}''{{sfn|Johnson-Woods|2010|p=301}} derive from the [[Chinese character]]s with which the Japanese term ''{{transl|ja|manga}}'' is written.{{sfnm|1a1=Cooper-Chen|1y=2010|1p=177|2a1=Thompson|2y=2007|2p=xiii}}

'''Jamaican culture''' consists of the religion, norms, values, and lifestyle that define the people of Jamaica. The culture is mixed, with an ethnically diverse society, stemming from a history of inhabitants beginning with the original [[Taíno people|Taino people]]. The '''Spaniards''' originally brought slavery to Jamaica. Then they were overthrown by the English. Jamaica later gained emancipation on August 1, 1834, and independence from the British on August 6, 1962. Black slaves became the dominant cultural force as they suffered and resisted the harsh conditions of forced labour. After the abolition of slavery, Chinese and Indian migrants were transported to the island as [[indentured]] workers, bringing with them ideas from the Far East. These contributions resulted in a diversity that affected the language, music, dance, religion, and social norms and practices of the Jamaicans.

==Language==
The official language of the Jamaican people is English (derived from British influence) with a local dialect called Patois (pronounced "patwa") that is spoken by a majority of its people. This dialect is a combination of the languages from the different inhabitants in its history. It was developed by the slaves over time in an effort to communicate with each other, especially given that they were from different countries and, for the Africans, also from different tribes.

==Religion==
{{Main article|Religion in Jamaica}}
By far, the largest religion in Jamaica is the Christian faith. The Anglican Church, Catholic Jesus, Methodist Church, Baptists, Seventh-Day and the Church of God are present throughout the country. Many old churches have been carefully maintained and/or restored.&lt;ref name="JNHTchurches"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jnht.com/category.php?id=80|title=Churches|year=2005|publisher=[[Jamaica National Heritage Trust]]|accessdate=21 October 2009|location=Kingston, Jamaica|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908183154/http://www.jnht.com/category.php?id=80|archivedate=8 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rastafari movement]] is a derivative of the larger [[Christian culture]], but its origins were influenced by rising consciousness of Africa, and an awareness of political events in that continent. There is also a small number of Jewish synagogues in Jamaica, dating from the 17th century. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Elements of ancient African religions remain, especially in remote areas throughout the island. Some of these practices are described generally as [[Obeah]], 
[[Kumina]], or Pocomania. Though the congregations are small, they are visited by many Christians and non-Christians seeking an experience they have not found in the churches.{{vague|date=June 2016}}{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} It is estimated that as much as 40% of the population secretly seek the services of the African traditional religious healers when confronted with serious problems that conventional medicine cannot remedy.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

"The [[Bahá'í Faith|Baha'i]] movement in Jamaica began about 50 years [in 1942] ago when a doctor from Portland, Dr. Malcolm King, brought the teaching from the United States."&lt;ref name="rites"&gt;{{Citation |last=Bridge |first=Abena |title=Divine rites – Uncovering the faiths |newspaper=The Jamaican Gleaner |date= 5 July 2000| url=http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20000705/News/News1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, as part of the 60th anniversary celebration of the establishment of Baha'i in Jamaica, the Governor General of Jamaica, Sir [[Howard Cooke]], proclaimed a National Bahá'í Day to be held annually on 25 July.&lt;ref name="4th"&gt;{{Citation |author-link=Bahá'í International Community |title=Jamaicans celebrate 4th National Baha'i Day |publisher=Bahá'í World News Service |date=11 August 2006 |url=http://news.bahai.org/story/468}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the community of about 5000&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web |title=Most Baha'i Nations (2005) |work = |publisher=The ARDA (Association of Religion Data Archives) |year=2005 |url=http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebrated their activity and presence in Jamaica with the international Bahá'í choir, ''The Voices of Bahá''. The choir performed at Ward Theatre and the University's Chapel, with proceeds earmarked to two Jamaican charities, (one serving families of policemen slain in the line of duty, and the one Denham Town Golden Age Home).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Voices of Baha to Perform in Kingston |publisher=Jamaica Information Service |date=29 June 2005 |url= http://www.jis.gov.jm/information/html/20050629t110000-0500_6159_jis_voices_of_baha_to_perform_in_kingston.asp |accessdate=30 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612204010/http://www.jis.gov.jm/news/117/6159?mode=redirect |archivedate=12 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other religions practised in the country of Jamaica include [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Islam]].

===Rastafari===
{{Main article|Rastafari movement}}

[[File:Rastafarian Man In Rasta Cap.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Rastafarian]] man in a [[rastacap]] at a port of Jamaica's [[Black River, Jamaica|Black River]].]]
Originating in the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;''Dread History'' by Professor [[Robert A. Hill (Jamaican historian)|Robert A. Hill]] (2001), {{ISBN|0-948390-78-6}} {{ISBN|978-0948390784}}.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most prominent, internationally known aspects of Jamaica's African-Caribbean culture is the [[Rastafari]] movement, particularly those elements that are expressed through [[reggae]] music. In the 1970s and early 1980s, [[Bob Marley]] became the most high-profile exponent of the Rastafari culture and belief system. His reputation as an innovative musician devoted to his faith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/davebulow/wow/lyrics_bob_marley_-_we_and_them.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510012728/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/davebulow/wow/lyrics_bob_marley_-_we_and_them.htm |archivedate=10 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; has continued to grow since his death, so that by 2004 his greatest hits compilation, [[Legend]], had sold 20 million copies worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2004/10/25/cx_2004deadcelebtears_9.html|title=The Top Earners For 2004|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him arguably the world's most famous Jamaican, and certainly the nation's biggest-selling recording artist.

Rastafari itself is a [[monotheistic]] belief system, based on teachings found in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] – particularly the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/davebulow/wow/lyrics_bunny_wailer_-_armageddon.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519013252/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/davebulow/wow/lyrics_bunny_wailer_-_armageddon.htm |archivedate=19 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; However, what distinguishes Rastafari from Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, (which also cite [[Abrahamic]] beliefs), is that Rastas believe in the divinity of the Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] of [[Ethiopia]].

Hailed by Rastas as H.I.M. (His Imperial Majesty), [[Haile Selassie I]] is regarded as God himself, the true descendant of [[Solomon]], and the earthly embodiment of [[Jah]] (God)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dooballoh.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=12982 Anthony B: Lyrics to 'Conquer All".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125084731/http://dooballoh.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=12982 |date=25 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – in what believers see as a fulfillment of prophecy regarding [[the second coming]] of the [[Messiah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/davebulow/wow/lyrics_lee_scratch_perry_-_soul_rebel.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014190233/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/davebulow/wow/lyrics_lee_scratch_perry_-_soul_rebel.htm |archivedate=14 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}  &lt;/ref&gt;

Those Rasta beliefs, which are not explicitly mentioned in the Bible (such as the specific name of H.I.M. "Haile Selassie"), are not gathered into a single holy text. Instead, Rasta beliefs are primarily shared through a community of songs, chants, and oral testimonies, as well as in written texts (including websites).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthcultureroots.com/ Earth Culture Roots]. Website explaining Rasta beliefs.&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive use of song makes Rastafari a particularly musical source of Jamaican culture.

Rasta cultural traditions include wearing their hair in uncut, uncombed strands known as [[dreadlocks]] (in adherence to the [[Nazarite]] vow&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 6:1–21 ([[King James Version]])&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as eating unprocessed (natural) foodstuffs which are known as ''[[Ital]]''. However, neither tradition is regarded as compulsory – many people who wear dreadlocks are not Rastas and many Rastas do not wear them.

One of the most controversial cultural traditions is Rastas' use of [[Cannabis (drug)|ganja]] as a [[sacrament]] which is smoked to aid in [[reasoning]] ([[contemplation]] and discussion). Cannabis is a strictly prohibited substance in Jamaica, so its use by Rastas means the movement is in a more-or-less permanent state of tension with police agencies.

In its Jamaican homeland, Rastafari is a minority culture and receives little in the way of official recognition. Jamaica is an overwhelmingly Christian country, so Rasta beliefs and practices – such as the divinity of H.I.M Hailie Selassie – are sometimes regarded as [[pagan]] by Christian Jamaicans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/westernnews/html/20090211T220000-0500_146094_OBS_RAS_TAFARI_CHALLENGED__.asp] {{dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Some Rastas also express hostility towards aspects of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songlyrics.com/bob-marley/talking-blues/197464|title=Talking Blues - BOB MARLEY|website=SongLyrics.com|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Nevertheless, the artistic contributions of the movement, particularly Bob Marley, are widely respected. Marley was awarded the [[Jamaican Order of Merit]] in 1981, and there are two official monuments to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlj.org.jm/docs/marley_bibliography.htm|title=Bob Marley Bibliography|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=16 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130034229/http://www.nlj.org.jm/docs/marley_bibliography.htm|archivedate=30 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rastas can be found in many countries outside Jamaica and among many non-Jamaicans. Because it is not a centrally organised religion, there is no way of knowing how many devotees there are.

==Dance==
Dance has always been important to Jamaica – from colonial times until the present. Early folk rhythms and movements often enhanced Christian religious celebrations, or were associated with Christian holidays. More recently, dances have become associated with the [[music of Jamaica]], particularly [[dancehall]] styles. 

Dance theatre is also growing in importance. [[Rex Nettleford]], [[Eddy Thomas]], [[Olive Lewin]], and [[Edna Manley]] are four Jamaicans whose influences on the arts – music and dance in particular – have been extremely important. Nettleford, Thomas, and Ivy Baxter formed the [[National Dance Theatre Company]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;National Dance Theatre Company of Jamaica.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important Jamaicans in dance theatre have included the [[Tony award|Tony-Award]]-winning choreographer [[Garth Fagan]] (''[[The Lion King]]'' on Broadway).

Dancehall, or [[reggae]], music has inspired a number of dance styles as well. To understand the evolution of popular dance, it helps to understand the musical progression. [[Ska]] music, with fast beats, also had fast dances. The slow to [[rocksteady]] also developed slower dances, allowing dancers to stay on the floor longer. [[Reggae]] is associated with many things, including the [[Rastafarian]] movement, but influenced the newer styles.

[[Dancehall]] music often creates its own dances based on moves in the lyrics of the songs themselves. [[Soca music]] from [[Trinidad and Tobago]]  is popular with most of the popular artists from Trinidad, but many soca Jamaican artist such as [[Byron Lee]], Fab 5, and Lovindeer are famous but also represent Jamaican music.

[[Daggering]] is a form of dance originating from Jamaica. The dance incorporates [[Non-penetrative sex|dry sex]],&lt;ref name="censoring"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20090212/cleisure/cleisure1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114125853/http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20090212/cleisure/cleisure1.html |archivedate=14 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; wrestling and other forms of frantic movement.&lt;ref name="censoring" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yinnyang.co.uk/2010/05/daggering-101-a-tutorial/|title=Daggering 101… a Tutorial|website=Yinnyang.co.uk|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruckins]] is a Jamaican dance performed to celebrate Emancipation Day.

==Theatre==
Jamaica's earliest theatre was built in 1682. Several more theatres opened in the 1700s and 1800s, attracting performances by both professional touring companies and amateur groups. But performances weren't limited to official venues. Many took place in houses, stores, court houses, and enclosed outdoor spaces large enough to hold them. During this period, classic plays such as [[Shakespeare]] were most often produced. However, the Jewish and French communities became large enough to merit productions aimed at them, too.

After the abolition of slavery, Jamaicans began fusing music, humor, and dance into public theatrical performances. Although it took many years for true Jamaican styles to develop, eventually they became more prevalent than European works. Today's most popular theatrical form in Jamaica, [[pantomime]], began in the 1940s as a fusion of English pantomime with Jamaican folklore. Another popular style, "Roots" (Grassroots) Theatre,&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Guide to African and Caribbean Theatre'', Martin Banham and Errol Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; evolved in the 1960s and 1970s. These riotous bawdy tales remained crowd favorites in Kingston's open-air theatres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20090405/ent/ent3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413150034/http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20090405/ent/ent3.html |archivedate=13 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

One artist involved in root plays is Winsome (code name), a Jamaican writer and producer chronicled in Deborah Thomas' book "Modern Blackness". Winsome handled all the publicity for her plays herself, and ended up putting them on in the rural areas surrounding Kingston – the city theaters refused to house her plays because of their controversial nature. In her plays, Winsome explores how sex, money, and power interact everyday for Jamaicans. In 1997, Winsome wrote and produced a root play entitled Ruff Rider, in which family, sexual abuse, love, work, and friendship all intersect. According to author Thomas, author of, "In all of her work, the sympathetic characters are those she portrays as struggling to balance their own pursuit of individual gain with ‘living well together’ with others. As they negotiage the fine lines between egalitarianism and hierarchy, her characters also contribute to the public debate regarding the gendered dimensions of respectability and reputation."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Deborah. ''Modern Blackness: Nationalism, Globalization, and the Politics of Culture in Jamaica.'' Durham, N.C.: [[Duke University Press]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable roots play figures include Ralph Holness, Ginger Knight, Balfour Anderson, Michael Denton, Ian Reid, Paul Beil, Everton Dawkins, Luke Ellington (Lukington), Buddy Pouyat and the late Hyacinth Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20060122/ent/ent1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702053832/http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20060122/ent/ent1.html |archivedate=2 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and writing==
{{Further information|Jamaican literature}}
[[Derek Walcott]], a [[Nobel prize]] laureate, born and educated in St. Lucia, attended college in Jamaica. Other significant writers from the island include [[Claude McKay]] and [[Louis Simpson]]. Plays and works in Jamaican English, or [[patois]], attract special attention. [[Louise Bennett]], [[Andrew Salkey]] and [[Mikey Smith]] have contributed to this phenomenon by writing works in patois. [[Ian Fleming]] wrote his famous [[James Bond]] novels while living in Jamaica. [[Jean Rhys]] is also well known for her novel ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'', which was set in Jamaica.
Jamaican authors are always faced with the decision of writing in standard English for a huge worldwide audience, or in the local patois, for a much smaller, but more trendy, audience. Jamaican films with patois sound-tracks such as [[The Harder They Come]] require sub-titles for export to general markets. In general, the use of patois severely limits the potential audience for the otherwise universal Jamaican message. Pauline Wills, author of the book, "The Imperils of the Maxfield Terrain," sections written in patios about the garrison community of Maxfield Avenue. She was born in the parish of St Andrew, Jamaica and a past student of Immaculate Conception High School.  Jamaican writer [[Marlon James (novelist)|Marlon James]] won the 2015 [[Man Booker Prize]] for his novel ''[[A Brief History of Seven Killings]]''.

==Film==
{{Further information|List of Jamaican films}}
Jamaica's film industry is not widely known, but it is growing. ''[[The Harder They Come]]'', ''[[Rasta Rockett]]'', ''[[Shottas]]'', ''[[Third World Cop]]'', ''[[Rockers (1978 film)|Rockers]]'', ''[[Countryman (film)|Countryman]]'', ''[[Dancehall Queen]]'' &amp; " Real Ghetto Youths" are a few of the best-known Jamaican movies. However, many popular Hollywood movies have also been filmed in Jamaica. A short list includes ''[[The Blue Lagoon (1980 film)|The Blue Lagoon]]'', ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]'', ''[[Cool Runnings]]'' and [[James Bond]] films, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' and ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]''.

Jamaica's leading annual film event ''The Reggae Film Festival'' takes place each February in Jamaica's capital city, Kingston. Members of Jamaica's film industry gather here to make new links and many new projects have grown from the event.

Jamaica has many talented film makers but there is a great lack of available funds and resources for film makers. Since the creation of the [[Reggae Film Festival]] there have been many new films made in Jamaica and the event has given the industry a real boost, this combined with the recent CARICOM European film treaty which enables Jamaican film makers to seek funding in Europe, has opened up a new door for film makers looking to apply for funding and this will hopefully make a real difference to the future of the industry.

Other more recent feature films made in Jamaica are: 'Almost Heaven', 'Roots Time', 'Wah Do Dem', 'Concrete Jungle', 'Redemption Paradise', 'Real Ghetto Youths', and 'Smile Orange'.

'''David Peter Reimer''' (born '''Bruce Peter Reimer'''; 22 August 1965&amp;nbsp;– 4 May 2004) was a Canadian man born male but [[sex reassignment|reassigned]] as a girl and raised female following medical advice and intervention after his [[human penis|penis]] was accidentally destroyed during a botched [[circumcision]] in infancy.{{sfn|Colapinto|2001a}}

The psychologist [[John Money]] oversaw the case and reported the reassignment as successful and as evidence that [[gender identity]] is primarily learned. The academic sexologist [[Milton Diamond]] later reported that Reimer's realization he was not a girl crystallized between the ages of 9 and 11 years{{sfn|Diamond|Sigmundson|1997}} and he transitioned to living as a male at age 15. Well known in medical circles for years anonymously as the "John/Joan" case, Reimer later went public with his story to help discourage similar medical practices. He committed [[suicide]] after suffering years of [[major depressive disorder|severe depression]], financial instability, and a troubled marriage.&lt;ref name=nyt-obit/&gt;

==Infancy==
Reimer was born in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], on August 22, 1965, the elder of identical twin boys.{{sfnm |1a1=Harper |1y=2007 |1p=43 |2a1=Rolls |2y=2015 |2p=133}} He was originally named Bruce and his identical twin was named Brian.{{sfn|Rolls|2015|p=133}} Their parents were Janet and Ron Reimer, a couple of [[Mennonite]] descent who had married the previous December.{{sfn|Rolls|2015|p=133}} At the age of six months, after concern was raised about how both of them urinated, the boys were diagnosed with [[phimosis]].{{sfnm |1a1=Colapinto |1y=2001a |1p=10 |2a1=Mann |2y=2016 |2pp=183–184}} They were referred for [[circumcision]] at the age of seven months. On April 27, 1966,  a [[urologist]] performed the operation using the unconventional method of [[electrocauterization]],{{sfn|Colapinto|2001a|pp=11–13}}&lt;ref name=BBCHealthCheck&gt;{{cite news |date=23 November 2010 |title=Health Check: The Boy Who Was Raised a Girl |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11814300 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the procedure did not go as doctors had planned, and Bruce's penis was burned beyond surgical repair.{{sfn|Rolls|2015|p=134}} The doctors chose not to operate on Brian, whose phimosis soon cleared without surgical intervention.&lt;ref name=CBCnews&gt;{{cite news |date=10 May 2004 |title=David Reimer: The Boy Who Lived as a Girl |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/reimer/ |dead-url=yes |publisher=CBC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807123535/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/reimer/ |archive-date=7 August 2012 |access-date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents, concerned about their son's prospects for future happiness and sexual function without a penis, took him to [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in [[Baltimore]] in early 1967 to see [[John Money]],{{sfn|Colapinto|2001a|p=49}} a [[psychology|psychologist]] who was developing a reputation as a pioneer in the field of sexual development and [[gender identity]], based on his work with [[intersexuality|intersex]] patients.{{sfn|Mann|2016|p=184}} Money was a prominent proponent of the "theory of gender neutrality"—that gender identity developed primarily as a result of [[observational learning|social learning]] from early childhood and that it could be changed with the appropriate behavioural interventions.{{sfn|Colapinto|2001a|pp=33–34}} The Reimers had seen Money being interviewed in February 1967 on the Canadian news program ''[[This Hour Has Seven Days]]'', during which he discussed his theories about gender.{{sfn|Colapinto|2001a|pp=18–22, 39}}

Money and physicians working with young children born with [[intersex]] conditions believed that a penis could not be replaced but that a functional [[vagina]] could be constructed surgically. It was also the safest and most conventional pathway to take: Money told the parents it was what would be best for the boy.&lt;ref name=BBCHealthCheck/&gt;&lt;!-- the closest to this is Colapinto-2001 p.32: "it was easier for surgeons to construct a synthetic vagina than to create an artificial penis", but that source doesn't support the claim. --&gt; Money also claimed that Reimer would be more likely to achieve successful, functional sexual maturation as a girl than as a boy.{{sfn|Colapinto|2001b}}{{page needed|date=June 2016}}{{Failed verification|date=June 2016|reason=cannot find a supporting quote for this in Colapinto-2001 (print copy) }} For Money, a case where identical twin boys were involved where one could be raised as a girl provided a perfect test of his theories.&lt;ref name=bbc-horizon-tv-2000&gt;{{cite episode |date=7 December 2000 |title=The Boy Who Was Turned into a Girl |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/boyturnedgirl_transcript.shtml |series=[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]] |publisher=BBC |access-date=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-horizon-tv-followup&gt;{{cite episode |year=2005 |title=Dr Money and the Boy with No Penis |series=[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]] |publisher=BBC |access-date=27 September 2014|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/dr_money_prog_summary.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Money and the Hopkins team persuaded the baby's parents that [[sex reassignment surgery]] would be in Reimer's best interest.{{sfn|Colapinto|2001a|pp=50–52}} At the age of 22 months, baby Bruce underwent a bilateral [[orchidectomy]], in which his [[testicle|testes]] were surgically removed and a rudimentary vulva was fashioned.{{sfn|Colapinto|2001a|pp=53–54}} Bruce was [[sex assignment|reassigned]] to be [[gender of rearing|raised as female]] and given the name Brenda.{{sfn|Marinucci|2010|p=124}} Psychological support for the reassignment and surgery was provided by{{sfn|Colapinto|2000|pp=50–52}} John Money, who continued to see Reimer annually{{sfn|Colapinto|2000|pp=136}} for consultations and to assess the outcome.{{sfn|Warnke|2008|p=16}} This reassignment was considered an especially valid test case{{sfn|Walker|2010|p=33}} of the social learning concept of gender identity for two reasons: First, Reimer's identical twin brother, Brian, made an ideal [[scientific control|control]] because the brothers shared genes, family environments, and the intrauterine environment. Second, this was reputed to be the first reassignment and reconstruction performed on a male infant who had no abnormality of prenatal or early postnatal [[sexual differentiation]].

==Later childhood and adolescence==
Reimer said that Money forced the twins to rehearse sexual acts involving "thrusting movements", with David playing the [[Top, bottom and versatile|bottom]] role. Reimer said that, as a child, he had to get "down on all fours" with his brother, Brian Reimer, "up [[Doggy style|behind his butt]]" with "his crotch against" his "buttocks". Reimer said that Money forced David, in another [[sex positions|sexual position]], to have his "[[Missionary position|legs spread]]" with Brian on top. Reimer said that Money also forced the children to take their "clothes off" and engage in "genital inspections". On at "least one occasion", Reimer said that Money took a photograph of the two children doing these activities. Money's rationale for these various treatments was his belief that "childhood 'sexual rehearsal play{{' "}} was important for a "healthy adult gender identity".{{sfn|Colapinto|2001b}}{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

For several years, Money reported on Reimer's progress as the "John/Joan case". Money wrote, "The child's behavior is so clearly that of an active little girl and so different from the boyish ways of her twin brother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Money |first1=John |author1-link=John Money |last2=Ehrhardt |first2=Anke A. |author2-link=Anke Ehrhardt |year=1972 |title=Man &amp; Woman, Boy &amp; Girl |location=Baltimore, Maryland |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}} Cited in {{harvnb|Halpern|2012|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Notes by a former student at Money's lab state that, during the follow-up visits, which occurred only once a year, Reimer's parents routinely lied to lab staff about the success of the procedure. The twin brother, Brian, later developed [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=bbc-horizon-tv-followup/&gt;

[[Estrogen]] was given during adolescence, inducing [[breast development]].{{sfn|Balthazart|2012|p=25}}

==Adulthood==
By the age of 13 years, Reimer was experiencing suicidal depression and he told his parents he would take his own life if they made him see Money again.{{sfn|Colapinto|2000|pp=137–141}} Finally, on March 14, 1980, Reimer's parents told him the truth about his gender reassignment,{{sfn|Eskridge|Hunter|2003|p=127}} following advice from Reimer's [[endocrinologist]] and [[psychiatrist]]. At 14, having been informed of his past by his father, Reimer decided to assume a male gender identity, calling himself David. By 1987, Reimer had undergone treatment to reverse the reassignment, including testosterone injections, a double [[mastectomy]], and two [[phalloplasty]] operations.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} On September 22, 1990, he married Jane Fontane and would adopt her three children.{{sfnm |1a1=Beh |1a2=Diamond |1y=2005 |1p=12 |2a1=Goldie |2y=2014 |2p=187 |3a1=Rolls |3y=2015 |3p=144}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boodman |first=Sandra G. |date=29 February 2000 |title=A Terrible Accident, a Dismal Failure |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/wellness/2000/02/29/a-terrible-accident-a-dismal-failure/83850bc4-b27a-417e-ba85-3693a4cafdd0 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His case came to international attention in 1997 when he told his story to [[Milton Diamond]], an academic [[sexology|sexologist]] who persuaded Reimer to allow him to report the outcome in order to dissuade physicians from treating other infants similarly.{{sfn|Diamond|Sigmundson|1997}} Soon after, Reimer went public with his story and [[John Colapinto]] published a widely disseminated and influential account&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Angier |first=Natalie |title=X + Y = Z |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/20/reviews/000220.20angiert.html |date=February 20, 2000 |publisher=New York Times |location= |accessdate=2018-09-25 |quote=Colapinto wrote a long story about the case for Rolling Stone, which won him a National Magazine Award.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in December 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Colapinto |first=John |author-link=John Colapinto |year=1997 |title=The True Story of John/Joan |magazine=Rolling Stone |issue=775 |location=New York |publisher=Straight Arrow Publishers |pages=54–97 |issn=0035-791X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article won the [[National Magazine Awards|National Magazine Award]] for Reporting.{{sfn|Bockting|2010|p=378}}

This was later expanded into the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' best-selling]] biography ''[[As Nature Made Him|As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl]]'' (2000),{{sfn|Koch|2017|p=143}} in which Colapinto described how—contrary to Money's reports—when living as Brenda, Reimer did not [[gender identity|identify]] as a girl. He was ostracized and bullied by peers (who dubbed him "cavewoman"),&lt;ref name=BBCHealthCheck/&gt;{{sfn|Karkazis|2008|p=74}} and neither frilly dresses,{{sfnm |1a1=Colapinto |1y=2001 |1p=115 |2a1=Warnke |2y=2008 |2p=21}} nor female hormones made him feel female.

In addition to his difficult lifelong relationship with his parents, Reimer had to deal with unemployment and the death of his brother Brian from an overdose of [[antidepressant]]s on July 1, 2002. On May 2, 2004, his wife Jane told him she wanted to separate. On the morning of May 4, 2004, Reimer drove to a grocery store's parking lot in his hometown of Winnipeg&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news |last=Woo |first=Elaine |date=13 May 2004 |title=David Reimer, 38; After Botched Surgery, He Was Raised as a Girl in Gender Experiment |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/may/13/local/me-reimer13 |work=Los Angeles Times |page=B12 |access-date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took his own life by shooting himself in the head with a [[sawed-off shotgun]].{{sfnm |1a1=McQuail |1y=2018 |2a1=Rolls |2y=2015 |2p=145}} He was 38 years old.&lt;ref name=nyt-obit&gt;{{cite news |date=12 May 2004 |title=David Reimer, 38, Subject of the John/Joan Case |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/12/us/david-reimer-38-subject-of-the-john-joan-case.html |newspaper=The New York Times |agency=The Canadian Press |access-date=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in St. Vital Cemetery in Winnipeg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=St. Vital Cemetery Burial Search |url=http://www.winnipeg.ca/ppd/cemeteries/cemetery_stvital_alpha.stm |publisher=City of Winnipeg |access-date=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
For the first thirty years after Money's initial report that the reassignment had been a success, Money's view of the malleability of gender became the dominant viewpoint among physicians and doctors, reassuring them that sexual reassignment was the correct decision in certain instances, resulting in thousands of sexual reassignments.&lt;ref name=Nova/&gt;

The report and subsequent book about Reimer influenced several medical practices, reputations, and even current understanding of the [[Sex differences in humans|biology of gender]]. The case accelerated the decline of sex reassignment and surgery for unambiguous [[XY sex-determination system|XY]] infants with [[micropenis]], various other rare congenital malformations, or penile loss in infancy.&lt;ref name=Nova&gt;{{cite episode |year=2001 |title=Sex: Unknown |series=Nova |series-link=Nova (TV series) |transcript=Transcript |transcript-url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2813gender.html |network=PBS |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reimer has often been mentioned by [[intactivist]]s, who use him as an example of what could happen to a man if his parents decide to  [[circumcision|circumcise]] him at birth and the effect it can have on him throughout his life.

Colapinto's book described unpleasant childhood therapy sessions, implying that Money had ignored or concealed the developing evidence that Reimer's reassignment to female was not going well. Money's defenders have suggested that some of the allegations about the therapy sessions may have been the result of [[false memory syndrome]] and that the family was not honest with researchers.&lt;ref name=GUnews&gt;{{cite news |last1=Burkeman |first1=Oliver |author1-link=Oliver Burkeman |last2=Younge |first2=Gary |author2-link=Gary Younge |date=12 May 2004 |title=Being Brenda |url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1214525,00.html |newspaper=The Guardian: G2 |location=London |page=2 |access-date=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case has also been treated by [[Judith Butler]] in her 2004 book ''[[Undoing Gender]]'',{{sfn|Butler|2004|pp=58–74}} which examines gender, sex, psychoanalysis, and the medical treatment of intersex people.

==Documentaries==
The BBC science series ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' based two episodes on his life. "The Boy Who Was Turned into a Girl" aired in 2000 and "Dr Money and the Boy with No Penis" in 2004.&lt;ref name=bbc-horizon-tv-2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-horizon-tv-followup/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-horizon-tv-followup /&gt;

He was also mentioned in the 2017 documentary ''[[Gender Revolution|Gender Revolution: A Journey with Katie Couric]]''.

An episode of BBC Radio 4 Mind Changers, 
[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00t97xf Case Study: John/Joan - The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl], discusses the impact on two competing psychological theories of nature vs. nurture.

==In popular culture==
The ''[[Chicago Hope]]'' episode "[[Boys Will Be Girls (Chicago Hope episode)|Boys Will Be Girls]]" (2000) was based on Reimer's life. The episode explored the theme of a child's right not to undergo sexual reassignment surgery without consent.&lt;ref name=TV&gt;{{cite web |title=Treatment of Circumcision on TV |url=http://www.circumstitions.com/TVSitcomsA-M.html |website=The Intactivism Pages |access-date=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' episode "[[Identity (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit episode)|Identity]]" (2005) was based on David and Brian Reimer's lives and their treatment by Money.&lt;ref name=TV/&gt;

Upton authored the 1998 textbook, ''Architecture in the United States'' for the Oxford University Press' Oxford Art History series. Upton has written extensively on vernacular landscapes of the American built environment. His work on Colonial and Antebellum American include: ''Another City: Urban Life and Urban Spaces in the New American Republic'' (2008. New Haven: Yale University Press), ''Holy Things and Profane: Anglican Parish Churches in Colonial Virginia'' (1986. Cambridge: MIT Press), ''Madaline: Love and Survival in Antebellum New Orleans'' (1996. Athens: University of Georgia Press), and ''America’s Architectural Roots: Ethnic Groups That Built America'' (Washington: Preservation Press). As a founding member of the Vernacular Architecture Forum, Upton has published on materialist history and theory as separate from canonical architectural histories. Works such as ''Common Places: Readings in American Vernacular Architecture'', with John Michael Vlach (Athens: University of Georgia Press) and "Architecture History or Landscape History?" in the Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians. He wrote the chief essay for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s exhibition "Art and the Empire City: New York, 1825–1861" in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCLA Faculty Bio|url=http://www.arthistory.ucla.edu/people/faculty/dupton/|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15324coll10/id/56268 ''Art and the empire city : New York, 1825–1861''], a 2000 exhibition catalog from the Metropolitan Museum of Art libraries, online as PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11360">'''Distributional semantics''' is a research area that develops and studies theories and methods for quantifying and categorizing semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data. The basic idea of distributional semantics can be summed up in the so-called Distributional hypothesis: ''linguistic items with similar distributions have similar meanings.''

==Distributional hypothesis==
The '''distributional hypothesis''' in [[linguistics]] is derived from the [[semantic theory]] of language usage, i.e. words that are used and occur in the same contexts tend to purport similar meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The underlying idea that "a word is characterized by the company it keeps" was popularized by [[J. R. Firth|Firth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Distributional Hypothesis is the basis for [[statistical semantics]]. Although the Distributional Hypothesis originated in linguistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sahlgren|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
it is now receiving attention in [[cognitive science]] especially regarding the context of word use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|Ramscar|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent years, the distributional hypothesis has provided the basis for the theory of [[similarity-based generalization]] in language learning: the idea that children can figure out how to use words they've rarely encountered before by generalizing about their use from distributions of similar words.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Gleitman|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Yarlett|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The distributional hypothesis suggests that the more semantically similar two words are, the more distributionally similar they will be in turn, and thus the more that they will tend to occur in similar linguistic contexts.  Whether or not this suggestion holds has significant implications for both the [[data-sparsity]] problem in computational modeling, and for the question of how children are able to learn language so rapidly given relatively impoverished input (this is also known as the problem of the [[poverty of the stimulus]]).

==Distributional semantic modeling==
Distributional semantics favor the use of linear algebra as computational tool and representational framework. The basic approach is to collect distributional information in high-dimensional vectors, and to define distributional/semantic similarity in terms of vector similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rieger |1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different kinds of similarities can be extracted depending on which type of distributional information is used to collect the vectors: '''topical''' similarities can be extracted by populating the vectors with information on which text regions the linguistic items occur in; '''paradigmatic''' similarities can be extracted by populating the vectors with information on which other linguistic items the items co-occur with. Note that the latter type of vectors can also be used to extract '''syntagmatic''' similarities by looking at the individual vector components.

The basic idea of a correlation between distributional and semantic similarity can be operationalized in many different ways. There is a rich variety of computational models implementing distributional semantics, including [[latent semantic analysis]] (LSA),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deerwester|Dumais|Furnas|Landauer|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyperspace Analogue to Language]] (HAL), syntax- or dependency-based models,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Padó|Lapata|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[random indexing]], [[semantic folding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|arxiv=1511.08855|title=Semantic Folding Theory And its Application in Semantic Fingerprinting|last=De Sousa Webber|first=Francisco|date=2015|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various variants of the [[topic model]].

Distributional semantic models differ primarily with respect to the following parameters:

* Context type (text regions vs. linguistic items)
* Context window (size, extension, etc.)
* Frequency weighting (e.g. [[entropy]], [[pointwise mutual information]], etc.)
* Dimension reduction (e.g. [[random indexing]], [[singular value decomposition]], etc.)
* [[Similarity measure]] (e.g. [[cosine similarity]], [[Minkowski distance]], etc.)

Distributional semantic models that use linguistic items as context have also been referred to as '''word space models'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schütze|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sahlgren|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compositional==

[[Compositional distributional semantics|Compositional distributional semantic]] models are an extension of distributional semantic models that characterize the semantics of entire phrases or sentences. This is achieved by composing the distributional representations of the words that sentences contain. Different approaches to composition have been explored, and are under discussion at established workshops such as [[SemEval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task1/|title=SemEval-2014, Task 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simpler non-compositional models fail to capture the semantics of larger linguistic units as they ignore grammatical structure and logical words, which are crucial for their understanding.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Applications==

Distributional semantic models have been applied successfully to the following tasks:
* finding [[semantic similarity]] between words and multi-word expressions;
* [[Keyword clustering|word clustering]] based on semantic similarity;
* automatic creation of [[thesauri]] and bilingual dictionaries;
* lexical ambiguity resolution;
* expanding search requests using synonyms and associations;
* defining the topic of a document;
* [[document clustering]] for [[information retrieval]];
* [[data mining]] and [[named entities recognition]];
* creating [[semantic mapping (literacy)|semantic maps]] of different subject domains;
* [[paraphrasing]];
* [[sentiment analysis]];
* modeling selectional preferences of words.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17999">The '''dual-route theory of reading aloud''' was first described in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pritchard SC, Coltheart M, Palethorpe S, Castles A |title=Nonword reading: comparing dual-route cascaded and connectionist dual-process models with human data |journal=J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=1268–88 |date=October 2012 |pmid=22309087 |doi=10.1037/a0026703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests that two separate mental mechanisms, or cognitive routes, are involved in [[Reading (process)|reading]] aloud, with output of both mechanisms contributing to the [[pronunciation]] of a written stimulus.&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=coltheart1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coltheart|first=Max|author2=Curtis, Brent |author3=Atkins, Paul |author4= Haller, Micheal |title=Models of reading aloud: Dual-route and parallel-distributed-processing approaches.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1993|volume=100|issue=4|pages=589–608|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.100.4.589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yamada 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamada J, Imai H, Ikebe Y |title=The use of the orthographic lexicon in reading kana words |journal=J Gen Psychol |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=311–23 |date=July 1990 |pmid=2213002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One mechanism, termed the '''lexical route''', is the process whereby skilled readers can recognize known words by sight alone, through a "dictionary" lookup procedure.&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zorzi Houghton 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zorzi|first1=Marco|last2=Houghton|first2=George|last3=Butterworth|first3=Brian|title=Two routes or one in reading aloud?

Modeling reading : the dual-route approach | editors = Margaret J Snowling; Charles Hulme | work = The science of reading : a handbook | publisher = Blackwell Pub., | year = 2005 | location = Malden, MA | pages = 6–23 | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~perfetti/PDF/Coltheart%2005.pdf | oclc = 57579252 | isbn = 9781405114882}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internal lexicon encompasses every learned word, even exception words like 'colonel' or 'pint' that don't follow letter-to-sound rules. This route doesn't enable reading of [[pseudoword|nonwords]] (example 'zuce').&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2005" /&gt;  There is still no conclusive evidence whether the lexical route functions as a direct pathway going from visual word recognition straight to [[speech production]], or a less direct pathway going from visual word recognition to [[semantics|semantic]] processing and finally to speech production.&lt;ref name=coltheart1 /&gt;

The '''nonlexical''' or '''sublexical route''', on the other hand, is the process whereby the reader can "sound out" a written word. This is done by identifying the word's constituent parts (letters, [[phonemes]], [[graphemes]]) and, applying knowledge of how these parts are associated with each other, for example how a string of neighboring letters sound together.&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zorzi Houghton 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2005" /&gt;  This mechanism can be thought of as a letter-sound rule system that allows the reader to actively build a phonological representation and read the word aloud.&lt;ref name=coltheart1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yamada 1990" /&gt;  The nonlexical route allows the correct reading of nonwords as well as regular words that follow spelling-sound rules, but not exception words.
The dual-route hypothesis of reading has helped researchers explain and understand various facts about normal and abnormal reading.&lt;ref name=coltheart1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zorzi Houghton 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name=behrmann&gt;{{cite journal|last=Behrmann|first=M.|author2=Bub, D.|title=Surface dyslexia and dysgraphia: dual routes, single lexicon|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|year=1992|volume=9|issue=3|pages=209–251|doi=10.1080/02643299208252059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dual route hypothesis to reading.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|The mechanisms involved in dual-route processing, moving from the recognition of a written word to speech production.]]

==Transparency of phonological rules==
According to research, the amount of time required to master reading depends on the language's adherence to phonological rules.&lt;ref name="Sprenger-Charolles Siegel 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sprenger-Charolles|first=Liliane|author2=[[Linda Siegel|Siegel, Linda S.]] |author3=Jiménez, Juan E. |author4= Ziegler, Johannes C. |title=Prevalence and Reliability of Phonological, Surface, and Mixed Profiles in Dyslexia: A Review of Studies Conducted in Languages Varying in Orthographic Depth|journal=Scientific Studies of Reading|year= 2011|volume=15|issue=6|pages=498–521| doi=10.1080/10888438.2010.524463| url=http://lpp.psycho.univ-paris5.fr/pdf/2762.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[orthography|written language]] is described as transparent when it strongly adheres to spelling-sound rules and contains few exception words. Because of this, the English language (low transparency) is considered less transparent that French (medium transparency) and Spanish (high transparency) which contain more consistent grapheme-phoneme mappings. This difference explains why it takes more time for children to learn to read English, due to its frequent irregular orthography, compared to French and Spanish.&lt;ref name="Sprenger-Charolles Siegel 2011" /&gt;  The Spanish language's reliance on phonological rules can account for the fact that Spanish-speaking children exhibit a higher level of performance in nonword reading, compared to English and French-speaking children. Similarly, Spanish surface dyslexics exhibit less impairment in reading overall, because they can rely upon consistent pronunciation rules instead of processing many exception words as a whole in the internal lexicon.&lt;ref name="Sprenger-Charolles Siegel 2011" /&gt;  The dual-route system thus provides an explanation for the differences in reading acquisition rates as well as dyslexia rates between different languages.&lt;ref name="Sprenger-Charolles Siegel 2011" /&gt;

==Reading speed==

Skilled readers demonstrate longer reaction times when reading aloud irregular words that do not follow spelling-sound rules compared to regular words.&lt;ref name=paap /&gt;  When an irregular word is presented, both the lexical and nonlexical pathways are activated but they generate conflicting information that takes time to be resolved. The decision-making process that appears to take place indicates that the two routes are not entirely independent from one another.&lt;ref name=paap /&gt;  This data further explains why regular words, that follow spelling-sound rules but also have been stored in long-term memory, are read faster since both pathways can "agree" about the issue of pronunciation.&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name=paap /&gt;

==Attentional demands of each route==
According to the current model of dual-route processing, each of the two pathways consumes different amounts of limited attentional resources.&lt;ref name=paap /&gt;  The nonlexical pathway is thought to be more active and constructive as it assembles and selects the correct subword units from various potential combinations. For example, when reading the word "leaf", that adheres to spelling to sound rules, the reader must assemble and recognize the two-letter grapheme "ea" in order to produce the sound "ee" that corresponds to it.  It engages in controlled processing and thus requires more attentional capacities, which can vary in amount depending on the complexity of the words being assembled.&lt;ref name=paap /&gt;  On the other hand, the processing that takes place in the lexical pathway appears to be more automatic, since the word-sound units in it are pre-assembled. Lexical processing is thus considered to be more passive, consuming less attentional resources.&lt;ref name=paap&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paap|first=Kenneth R.|author2=Noel, Ronald W.|title=Dual-route models of print to sound: Still a good horse race|journal=Psychological Research|year=1991|volume=53|issue=1|pages=13–24|doi=10.1007/BF00867328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading disorders==

The dual-route hypothesis to reading can help explain patterns of data connected to certain types of [[Reading for special needs|disordered reading]], both [[dyslexia|developmental]] and [[Alexia (condition)|acquired]].&lt;ref name="Traxler 2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew Traxler |title=Introduction to Psycholinguistics: Understanding Language Science |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location= |year=2011 |pages= |isbn=1-4051-9862-1 |oclc=707263897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dyslexia chart.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Routes impaired in surface and phonological dyslexia]]

Children with reading disorders rely primarily on the sub-lexical route while reading.&lt;ref name="de Jong 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Jong CG, Licht R, Sergeant JA, Oosterlaan J |title=RD, ADHD, and their comorbidity from a dual route perspective |journal=Child Neuropsychol |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=467–86 |year=2012 |pmid=21999484 |doi=10.1080/09297049.2011.625354 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that children can decode non-words, letter by letter, accurately but with slow speed. However, in decision tasks, they have trouble differentiating between words and pseudohomophones (non words that sound like real words but are incorrectly spelled), thereby showing that they had impaired internal lexicons.&lt;ref name="de Jong 2012" /&gt;
Because children with reading disorders (RD) have both slow reading speeds and impaired lexical routes, there are suggestions that the same processes are involved in lexical route and fast naming of words.&lt;ref name="de Jong 2012" /&gt;  Other studies have also confirmed this idea that rapid naming of words is more strongly correlated with orthographical knowledge (lexical route) than with phonological representations (sub-lexical route). Similar results were observed for patients with [[ADHD]].&lt;ref name="de Jong 2012" /&gt;
Research concludes that reading disorders and ADHD have common properties: lexical route processing, rapid reading and sublexical route processing deficits as well.&lt;ref name="de Jong 2012" /&gt;

===Acquired surface dyslexia===

Surface dyslexia was first described by Marshall and Newcombe, and is characterized by the inability to read words that do not follow traditional pronunciation rules. English is also an example of a language that has numerous exceptions to the rules of pronunciation and thus presents a particular challenge to those with surface dyslexia. Patients with surface dyslexia may fail to read such words as yacht, or island for example, because they do not follow prescribed rules of pronunciation. The words will typically be sounded out using “regularizations”, such as pronouncing colonel as Kollonel.&lt;ref&gt;Coslett, H. B. (2002). Dyslexia. Retrieved December 17, 2017, from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/surface-dyslexia&lt;/ref&gt; Words like state, and abdominal, are examples of words that surface dyslexia sufferers will not have a problem pronouncing, as they do follow proscribed pronunciation rules. &lt;ref&gt;Coslett, H. B. (2016). Acquired Dyslexia. Retrieved December 17, 2017, from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/surface-dyslexia&lt;/ref&gt; Surface dyslexics will read some irregular words correctly if they are high frequency words such as “have” and "some”.&lt;ref&gt;Coslett, H. B. (2002). Dyslexia. Retrieved December 17, 2017, from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/surface-dyslexia&lt;/ref&gt; It has been postulated that surface dyslexics are able to read regular words by retrieving the pronunciation through semantic means. Or in other words, retrieving the words by meaning.&lt;ref&gt;oslett, H. B. (2002). Dyslexia. Retrieved December 17, 2017, from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/surface-dyslexia&lt;/ref&gt; 

Surface dyslexia is also semantically mediated. Meaning that there is a relationship between the word and its meaning and not just the mechanisms in how it is pronounced. People who suffer with surface dyslexia also have the ability to read words and non-words alike. This means the physical production of phonological sounds is not affected by surface dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;Coslett, H. B. (2016). Acquired Dyslexia. Retrieved December 17, 2017, from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/surface-dyslexia&lt;/ref&gt; 

The mechanism behind surface dyslexia is thought to be involved with the phonologic output of the lexicon and is also often attributed to the disruption of semantics. It is also hypothesized that three deficits cause surface dyslexia. The first deficit is at the visual level in recognizing and processing the irregular word. The second deficit may be located at the level of the output lexicon. This is because patients are able to recognize the semantic meaning of irregular words even if they pronounce them incorrectly in spoken word. This suggests the visual word form system and semantics are relatively preserved. The third deficit is likely related to semantic loss.&lt;ref&gt;Coslett, H. B. (2002). Dyslexia. Retrieved December 17, 2017, from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/surface-dyslexia&lt;/ref&gt;

While Surface dyslexia can be observed in patients with lesions in their temporal lobe, it is primarily associated with patients who have dementias. Such as Alzheimer’s or fronto-temporal dementia. Surface dyslexia is also a characteristic of semantic dementia, in which subjects lose knowledge of the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;Coslett, H. B. (2016). Acquired Dyslexia. Retrieved December 17, 2017, from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/surface-dyslexia&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment of surface dyslexics involves neuropsychological rehabilitation. The aim of the treatment is to improve the operation of the sub lexical reading route, or the patient’s ability to sound out new words. As well as the operation of the visual word recognition system, to increase the recognition of words. On a more micro level, treatment can also focus on the ability to sound out individual letters before the patient goes on to increasing the ability to sound out entire words.&lt;ref&gt;Brunsdon, &amp; Coltheart. (2005). Assessment and Treatment of Reading Disorders: A Cognitive Neuropsychological Perspective. Lecture presented in Macquarie University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquired phonological dyslexia===
Acquired phonological dyslexia is a type of dyslexia that results in an inability to read nonwords aloud and to identify the sounds of single letters. However, patients with this disability can holistically read and correctly pronounce words, regardless of length, meaning, or how common they are, as long as they are stored in memory.&lt;ref name=coltheart1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zorzi Houghton 1998" /&gt;  This type of dyslexia is thought to be caused by damage in the nonlexical route, while the lexical route, that allows reading familiar words, remains intact.&lt;ref name=coltheart1 /&gt;

==Computational modeling of the dual-route process==

A [[computational model]] of a cognitive task is essentially a computer program that aims to mimic human cognitive processing&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coltheart|first=Max|author2=Rastle, Kathleen |author3=Perry, Conrad |author4=Langdon, Robyn |author5= Ziegler, Johannes |title=DRC: A dual route cascaded model of visual word recognition and reading aloud.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 2001| volume=108|issue=1| pages=204–256| doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.1.204 |pmid=11212628}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of model helps bring out the precise parts of a theory and disregards the ambiguous sections, as only the clearly understood parts of the theory can be converted into a computer program. The ultimate goal of a computational model is to resemble human behavior as closely as possible, such that factors affecting the functioning of the program would similarly affect human behavior and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2001" /&gt;
Reading is an area that has been extensively studied via the computational model system. The dual-route cascaded model (DRC) was developed to understand the dual-route to reading in humans.&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2001" /&gt;
Some commonalities between human reading and the DRC model are:&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2005" /&gt;

* Frequently occurring words are read aloud faster than non-frequently occurring words.
* Actual words are read faster than non-words.
* Standard sounding words are read aloud faster than irregular sounding words.

The DRC model has been useful as it was also made to mimic dyslexia. Surface dyslexia was imitated by damaging the orthographic lexicon so that the program made more errors on irregular words than on regular or non-words, just as is observed in surface dyslexia.&lt;ref name=behrmann /&gt;  Phonological dyslexia was similarly modeled by selectively damaging the non-lexical route thereby causing the program to mispronounce non words. As with any model, the DRC model has some limitations and a newer version is currently being developed.&lt;ref name="Coltheart 2001" /&gt;

[[File:Genetic Manipulation.png|thumb|Cartoon illustrating genetic modification. The clippers represent an enzyme changing some base pairs in DNA.]]
'''Genetically modified livestock''' ('''GM livestock''') are organisms from the group of cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, birds, horses and fish kept for human consumption, whose genetic material ([[DNA]]) has been altered using [[genetic engineering]] techniques.  In some cases, the aim is to introduce a new [[trait (biology)|trait]] to the animals which does not occur naturally in the species, i.e. [[transgenesis]].

==Terminology==
'''Genetic modification''' is the direct manipulation of an organism's [[genome]] using [[biotechnology]]. It is a set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel [[organisms]].

'''Transgenesis''' is the process of introducing a gene from another species{{snd}} called a transgene{{snd}} into a living organism so that the organism exhibits a new property and transmits that property to its offspring.

In 2006, a pig was engineered to produce [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s through the expression of a [[roundworm]] gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2006 |title=Generation of cloned transgenic pigs rich in omega-3 fatty acids |url=http://pmbcii.psy.cmu.edu/evans/2006_Lia.pdf |journal=Nature Biotechnology |pages=435–436 |volume=24 |issue=4 |accessdate=2009-03-29 |author=Lai L |doi=10.1038/nbt1198 |pmc=2976610 |pmid=16565727 |name-list-format=vanc |display-authors=1 |last2=Kang |first2=Jing X |last3=Li |first3=Rongfeng |last4=Wang |first4=Jingdong |last5=Witt |first5=William T |last6=Yong |first6=Hwan Yul |last7=Hao |first7=Yanhong |last8=Wax |first8=David M |last9=Murphy |first9=Clifton N |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816010157/http://pmbcii.psy.cmu.edu/evans/2006_Lia.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enviropig]] was a genetically enhanced line of [[Yorkshire pig]]s in Canada created with the capability of digesting plant [[phosphorus]] more efficiently than conventional Yorkshire pigs. The project ended in 2012.&lt;ref name="Guelph"&gt;Guelph (2010). [http://www.uoguelph.ca/enviropig/index.shtml Enviropig]. Canada:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schimdt, Sarah.

Accessed 31 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; These pigs produced the enzyme [[phytase]], which breaks down the indigestible phosphorus, in their saliva. The enzyme was introduced into the pig chromosome by pronuclear [[microinjection]]. With this enzyme, the animal is able to digest cereal grain [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref name="Guelph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Canada |url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/enviropig/environmental_benefits.shtml |title=Enviropig{{snd}} Environmental Benefits &amp;#124; University of Guelph |publisher=Uoguelph.ca |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030215932/https://www.uoguelph.ca/enviropig/environmental_benefits.shtml |archivedate=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of these pigs would reduce the potential of water pollution since they excrete from 30 to 70.7% less phosphorus in manure depending upon the age and diet.&lt;ref name="Guelph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt; The lower concentrations of phosphorus in [[surface runoff]] reduces [[Algae|algal]] growth, because phosphorus is the [[limiting nutrient]] for algae.&lt;ref name="Guelph"/&gt; Because algae consume large amounts of oxygen, it can result in dead zones for fish.

==Cattle==

In 1990, the world's first transgenic bovine, [[Herman the Bull]], was developed.  At the early [[embryo]] stage, Herman was genetically engineered in a laboratory by Gen Pharm International. Scientists micro-injected cells with the human [[Genetic code|gene coding]] for [[lactoferrin]].  The [[Dutch Parliament]] changed law in December 1992 to allow Herman to reproduce.  Eight calves were born in 1994 following a [[breeding program]] established at Gen Pharm's European laboratory.  All calves inherited the lactoferrin production gene.&lt;ref name=USDA1994&gt;{{cite web|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture|year=1994|title=Herman the bull - Herman becomes a father.

Researchers have developed GM dairy cattle to grow without horns (sometimes referred to as "[[Poll (livestock) |polled]]") which can cause injuries to farmers and other animals.  The process is called [[genetic editing]].  A short strip of DNA was taken from the genome of [[Red Angus]] cattle, where it is known to suppress horn growth, and inserted into cells taken from an elite [[Holstein]] bull called "Randy". Each of the progeny will be a clone of Randy, but without his horns, and their offspring should also be hornless&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/agriculture/geneticmodification/10023561/Scientists-design-health-and-safety-cow-with-no-horns.html|accessdate=December 18, 2015|title=Scientists design ‘health and safety’ cow with no horns|author=Hall, M.|date=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goats==
{{See also|Genetically modified mammals#Genetically modified goats}}
Goats have been genetically engineered to produce milk containing strong spiderweb-like silk proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Zyga, Lisa (2010). "[http://phys.org/news194539934.html/ Scientist bred goats that produce spider silk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430100830/http://phys.org/news194539934.html/ |date=April 30, 2015 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

The goat gene sequence has been modified, using fresh umbilical cords taken from kids, in order to code for the human enzyme [[lysozyme]]. Researchers wanted to alter the milk produced by the goats, to contain lysozyme in order to fight off bacteria causing [[diarrhea]] in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://undark.org/article/gmo-goats-lysozyme-uc-davis-diarrhea/|title=These GMO Goats Could Save Lives.

==Fish==

===Salmon===
{{See also||Genetically modified fish#AquAdvantage salmon|Genetically modified fish#AquAdvantage salmon 2}}
In November 2015, the FDA of the USA approved the GM [[AquAdvantage]] salmon created by [[AquaBounty]] for commercial production, sale and consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AquAdvantage Salmon|url=https://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/developmentapprovalprocess/geneticengineering/geneticallyengineeredanimals/ucm280853.htm|publisher=FDA|access-date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the first genetically modified animal to be approved for human consumption.  The fish is essentially a GM Atlantic salmon with a [[Chinook salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus tshawytscha'') gene inserted.  This allows the fish to produce GH all year round for faster growth as the wild-type fish produces the hormone for only part of the year.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt;  The fish also has a second gene inserted from the eel-like [[ocean pout]] that acts like an "on" switch for the hormone.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt;  Pout also have [[antifreeze protein]]s in their blood, which allow the GM salmon to survive near-freezing waters and continue their development.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite web|author=Firger, J.|publisher=CBS News|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/controversy-swims-around-genetically-modified-fish/|year=2014|title=Controversy swims around genetically modified fish|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wild-type salmon takes 24 to 30 months to reach market size (4–6&amp;nbsp;kg) whereas the producers of the GM salmon claim it requires only 18 months for the GM fish to achieve this.&lt;ref name="CBS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fda.gov"&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/VeterinaryMedicineAdvisoryCommittee/UCM224760.pdf Environmental Assessment for AquAdvantage Salmon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReutersNov19"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/20/us-aquabounty-technologies-fda-idUSKCN0T826T20151120#yDLkHQMESrDJvbit.97|author1=Steenhuysen, J.  |author2=Polansek, T.|title=U.S. clears genetically modified salmon for human consumption|publisher=Reuters|date=November 19, 2015|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been claimed that to prevent the genetically modified fish inadvertently breeding with wild salmon, all the fish will be female and reproductively sterile.&lt;ref name="ReutersNov19" /&gt;  However, it has also been claimed that a small percentage of the females will remain fertile.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/12/21/fda-salmon-nature/1784933/|accessdate=November 28, 2015|year=2012|publisher=USA Today|title=FDA: Genetically engineered fish would not harm nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some opponents of the GM salmon have dubbed it the "Frankenfish".&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/ready-to-eat-the-first-gm-fish-for-the-dinner-table-8430639.html|title=Ready to eat: the first GM fish for the dinner table|year=2012|accessdate=November 28, 2015|publisher=The Independent|author=Connor S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triploid rainbow trout and largemouth bass===
Genetically modified [[triploid]] fish have been used to stock waterways for angling.  Triploid fish are sterile (wildtype are diploid) and therefore their metabolism is targeted to growth rather than reproduction.  They grow to large weights making them attractive to anglers.  In 2008, the US state of Washington bought more than 40,000 triploid [[rainbow trout]] (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and stocked them in 95 inland lakes to increase fish-license sales.  Triploid [[largemouth bass]] (''Micropterus salmoides''), a fish which is keenly sought by anglers, have also been developed.&lt;ref name="Merwin"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Field and Stream|volume=103|issue=8|author=Merwin, J.|year=2009|title=Trophy gluttony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
In 1968, a 14-year-old girl begins keeping a diary, in which she records her thoughts and concerns about issues such as crushes, weight loss, sexuality, social acceptance, and relating to her parents. The dates and locations mentioned in the book place its events as occurring between 1968 and 1970 in [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Oregon]], and [[New York City]]. The two towns in which the diarist's family reside during the story are not identified, and are only described as being college towns.

The diarist's father, a college professor, accepts a [[dean (education)|dean]] position at a new college, causing the family to relocate. The diarist has difficulty adjusting to her new school, but soon becomes best friends with a girl named Beth. When Beth leaves for summer camp, the diarist returns to her hometown to stay with her grandparents. She meets an old school acquaintance, who invites her to a party. There, glasses of [[cola]]—some of which are laced with [[LSD]]—are served. The diarist unwittingly ingests LSD and has an intense and pleasurable [[drug trip|trip]]. Over the following days the diarist socializes with the other teens from the party, willingly uses more drugs, and loses her virginity while on LSD. She worries that she may be pregnant, and her grandfather has a minor [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Overwhelmed by her worries, the diarist begins to take sleeping pills, first stolen from her grandparents, then later prescribed by her doctor upon returning home. Her friendship with Beth ends, as both girls have moved in new directions.

The diarist befriends a [[hip (slang)|hip]] girl, Chris, with whom she continues to use drugs. They date college students Richie and Ted, who deal drugs and persuade the two girls to help them by selling drugs at schools. When the girls walk in on Richie and Ted stoned and having sex with each other, they realize their boyfriends were just using them to make money. The girls report Richie and Ted to the police and flee to [[San Francisco]]. Chris gets a job in a boutique with a glamorous older woman, Shelia. Shelia invites both girls to lavish parties, where they resume taking drugs. One night Shelia and her new boyfriend introduce the girls to [[heroin]] and brutally [[rape]] them while they are under the influence of the drug. Traumatized, the diarist and Chris move to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] where they open a jewelry shop. Although the shop is a success, they quickly grow tired of it and miss their families; they return home for a happy Christmas.

Back at home, the diarist encounters social pressure from her drug scene friends, and has problems getting along with her parents. Chris and the diarist try to stay away from drugs, but their resolve lapses and they end up on [[probation]] after being caught in a police raid. The diarist gets high one night and runs away. She travels to several cities,  [[hitchhiking]] partway with a girl named Doris who is a victim of [[child sexual abuse]]. The diarist continues to use drugs, supporting her habit through [[prostitution]], and experiences [[homelessness]] before a priest reunites her with her family. Now determined to avoid drugs, she faces hostility from her former friends, especially after she calls the parents of one girl who shows up high for a babysitting job. The diarist's former friends harass her at school and threaten her and her family. They eventually drug her against her will; she has a [[bad trip]] resulting in physical and mental damage, and is sent to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. There she bonds with a younger girl named Babbie, who has also been a drug addict and [[child prostitution|child prostitute]].

Released from the hospital, the diarist returns home, finally free of drugs. She now gets along better with her family, makes new friends, and is romantically involved with Joel, a responsible student from her father's college. She is worried about starting school again, but feels stronger with the support of her new friends and Joel. In an optimistic mood, the diarist decides to stop keeping a diary and instead discuss her problems and thoughts with other people.

The epilogue states that the subject of the book died three weeks after the final entry. The diarist was found dead in her home by her parents when they returned from a movie. She died from a drug overdose, either accidental or premeditated.

==Production==
The manuscript that later became ''Go Ask Alice'' was initially prepared for publication by [[Beatrice Sparks]], a [[Mormons|Mormon]] therapist and youth counselor then in her early 50s, who had previously done various forms of writing. Sparks had reportedly noted that the general public at that time lacked knowledge about youth drug abuse, and she likely had both educational and moral motives for publishing the book.&lt;ref name=katsoulis /&gt;&lt;ref name=goldberg /&gt;&lt;ref name=nilsenhouse&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nilsen |first=Alleen Pace |date=October 1979 |title=The House That Alice Built |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/29873595/Go-Ask-Alice-Lit-Crit-The-House-That-Alice-Built |journal=School Library Journal |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=109-112 |doi= |access-date=2016-12-26 |via=Scribd.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sparks later claimed that the book was based on a real diary she received from a real teenage girl,&lt;ref name=nilsenhouse /&gt; although this claim was never substantiated&lt;ref name=katsoulis /&gt; and the girl has never been identified&lt;ref name=mikkelson /&gt; (see [[#Authorship|Authorship and veracity controversies]]). 

With the help of [[Art Linkletter]], a popular [[talk show]] host for whom Sparks had worked as a [[ghostwriter]], the manuscript was passed on to Linkletter's literary agent, who sold it to Prentice Hall.&lt;ref name=nilsenhouse /&gt; Linkletter, who had become a prominent anti-drug crusader after the 1969 suicide of his daughter [[Diane Linkletter|Diane]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Johnson |first=Ted |date=2010-05-27 |title=Art Linkletter's War on Drugs |url=https://variety.com/2010/biz/opinion/art-linkletters-war-on-drugs-39200/ |dead-url=no |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location=New York City |publisher=Variety.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107142420/http://variety.com/2010/biz/opinion/art-linkletters-war-on-drugs-39200/ |archive-date=2017-01-07 |access-date=2017-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also helped publicize the book.&lt;ref name=pwadvances&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Prentice-Hall has built up large advances... |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yr9EAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=art+linkletter+go+ask+alice&amp;dq=art+linkletter+go+ask+alice&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5vtLxn5DRAhXJ6iYKHXYrDi4Q6AEIMDAE |magazine=Publishers Weekly |edition=bound volume |location=New York City |publisher=R.R.

===Critical response===
''Go Ask Alice'' received positive initial reviews, including praise from Webster Schott in ''The New York Times'', who called it an "extraordinary work", a "superior work" and a "document of horrifying reality [that] possesses literary quality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/07/archives/childrens-books-what-do-yas-read.html|title=Childrens Books|last=Schott|first=Webster|date=1972-05-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-26|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also recommended by ''[[Library Journal]]'', ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', and ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'',&lt;ref name=adams /&gt; and ranked number 1 on the [[American Library Association]]'s 1971 list of Best Books for Young Adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Mary |last2=Van Horn |first2=Carole |date=1972 |title=Books for Children and Young People: Critical Health Problems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MvUaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA316#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |journal=Wisconsin Library Bulletin |volume=67-68   |issue=September-October 1972 |pages=316 |edition=Google Books |publication-date=2006-10-12 |publisher=Division of Library Services, Department of Public Instruction |doi= |access-date=2017-03-04  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reviews focused on the realism of the book's material, without further addressing the literary merit of the book.&lt;ref name=durchschlag /&gt;&lt;ref name=janke /&gt;&lt;ref name=adams /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=1971-09-14 |author= |title=Go Ask Alice by Anonymous |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/anonymous-3/go-ask-alice/ |magazine=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170106211907/https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/anonymous-3/go-ask-alice/ |archivedate=2017-01-06 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2017-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nilsen and Lauren Adams, the book was not subjected to the regular forms of literary criticism because it was presumed to be the real diary of a dead teenager.&lt;ref name=nilsenreminiscing /&gt;&lt;ref name=adams /&gt; Lina Goldberg has suggested that the publishers were motivated to list the author as "Anonymous" partly to avoid such criticism.&lt;ref name=goldberg /&gt;

Years after its publication, ''Go Ask Alice'' continued to receive some good reviews, often in the context of defending the book against censors (see [[#Censorship|Censorship]]).&lt;ref name=chapman /&gt; In a 1995 ''[[Village Voice]]'' column for [[Banned Books Week]], [[Nat Hentoff]] described it as "an extraordinarily powerful account of what it's actually like to get hooked on drugs" that "doesn't preach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hentoff |first=Nat |authorlink=Nat Hentoff |date=1995-10-03 |title=Ralph Reed's Reading List |page=10 | work=The Village Voice |location=New York City |via=ProQuest |subscription=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, starting in the 1990s, the book began to draw criticism for its heavy-handedness, melodramatic style and inauthenticity, in view of the growing consciousness that it was fiction rather than a real teenager's diary (see [[#Authorship|Authorship and veracity controversies]]).&lt;ref name=oppenheimer /&gt;&lt;ref name=white /&gt;&lt;ref name=jamison /&gt;&lt;ref name=adams /&gt;&lt;ref name=valentine&gt;{{cite news|author-last=Valentine |author-first=Jenny |author-link=Jenny Valentine |editor-last=Drabble |editor-first=Emily |date=2015-08-28 |title=Banned, Burned, or Simply Life Changing: What Are the Best Dangerous Books? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/28/banned-burned-or-simply-life-changing-what-are-the-best-dangerous-books |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=2017-01-06 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231175807/http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/28/banned-burned-or-simply-life-changing-what-are-the-best-dangerous-books |archive-date=2015-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the book again for ''The New York Times'' in 1998, Marc Oppenheimer called it "poorly written", "laughably written", and "incredible", although some other writers have pointed to the material as being plausible or even appealing to young readers.&lt;ref name=adams /&gt; The portrayal of the diarist's drug use, progressing from unwittingly ingesting LSD to injecting [[amphetamine|speed]] within a few days, and making a similar quick transition from her first use of [[marijuana]] to [[heroin]], has been deemed unrealistic.&lt;ref name=white /&gt;&lt;ref name=goldberg /&gt;&lt;ref name=cuseo&gt;{{cite book |last=Cuseo |first=Allan A. |date=1992 |title=Homosexual Characters in YA Novels: A Literary Analysis 1969–1982 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Extln1Ju_WAC&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc. |page=62-64 | isbn=9780810825376 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been criticized for equating homosexuality with "degradation", illness, sin, and guilt.&lt;ref name=cuseo /&gt; More recent analyses have expressed ethical concerns with the book's presentation of fiction to young readers as a true story.&lt;ref name=nilsenreminiscing /&gt;&lt;ref name=goldberg /&gt;&lt;ref name=valentine /&gt; Despite all these criticisms, the book is frequently called a young adult classic.&lt;ref name=white /&gt;&lt;ref name=beidler /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author-last=Everson |author-first=Katie |date=2015-09-08 |title=Why I've Written a Book for Teenagers About Taking Drugs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/sep/08/teenage-drugs-books-katie-everson |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=2017-01-07 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102234506/https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/sep/08/teenage-drugs-books-katie-everson |archive-date=2017-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship and veracity controversies==
Although ''Go Ask Alice'' has been credited to an anonymous author since its publication, and was originally promoted as the real, albeit edited, diary of a real teenage girl, over time the book has come to be regarded by researchers as a [[fake memoirs|fake memoir]] written by Beatrice Sparks,&lt;ref name=nilsenreminiscing /&gt;&lt;ref name=yagoda /&gt;&lt;ref name=mikkelson /&gt;&lt;ref name=white /&gt;&lt;ref name=hendley /&gt;&lt;ref name=katsoulis /&gt;&lt;ref name=goldberg /&gt; possibly with the help of one or more co-authors.&lt;ref name=oppenheimer /&gt; Despite significant evidence of Sparks' authorship, a percentage of readers and educators have continued to believe that the book is a true-life account of a teenage girl.&lt;ref name=yagoda /&gt;&lt;ref name=katsoulis /&gt;&lt;ref name=goldberg /&gt; 

===Beatrice Sparks authorship controversy===
''Go Ask Alice'' was originally published by [[Prentice Hall]] in 1971 as the work of an unnamed author "Anonymous". The original edition contained a  note signed by "The Editors" that included the statements, "''Go Ask Alice'' is based on the actual diary of a fifteen-year-old drug user....Names, dates, places and certain events have been changed in accordance with the wishes of those concerned."&lt;ref name=yagoda&gt;{{cite book |last=Yagoda |first=Ben |date=2009 |title=Memoir: A History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tp1vhUQf68EC&amp;pg=PT158#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=New York City |publisher=Riverhead Books (Penguin Group (USA)) |page=PT158 |isbn=978-1-101-15147-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Anonymous |date=1971 |title=Go Ask Alice |url= |location=[[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]] |publisher=Prentice-Hall Inc. |page= |edition=First }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paperback edition first published in 1972 by [[Avon (publisher)|Avon Books]] contained the words "A Real Diary" on the front cover just above the title,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Anonymous |date=1971 |publication-date=1972 |title=Go Ask Alice |url= |location=New York City |publisher=[[Avon (publisher)|Avon Books]] |page=Front cover |nopp=yes|isbn= |lccn=74-159446 |edition=First paperback |id=Avon Catalog N431}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the same words were included on the front covers of some later editions.&lt;ref name=adams /&gt; [[File:Go_Ask_Alice_-_Avon_Books_paperback_edition_cover_art.jpg|thumb|left|The cover art of the Avon Books paperback edition of ''Go Ask Alice'' presented it as "A Real Diary".]]

Upon its publication, almost all contemporary reviewers and the general public accepted it as primarily authored by an anonymous teenager. According to Lauren Adams, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' magazine was the only source to question the book's authenticity on the grounds that it "seem[ed] awfully well written".&lt;ref name=adams /&gt; Reviews described the book as either the authentic diary of a real teenage girl,&lt;ref name=oppenheimer /&gt;&lt;ref name=loebker /&gt;&lt;ref name=durchschlag&gt;{{cite news |last=Durchschlag |first=Beth |date=1971-08-25 |title=The Girl Who Lived Next Door&amp;nbsp;– Till Drugs Killed Her |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/181381679/ |newspaper=[[Courier-Post]]|location=Camden, New Jersey|page=30|access-date=2017-01-07 |via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes |quote=For Alice was real and could have lived next door; her parents...decided to let her story be told.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as an edited or slightly fictionalized version of her authentic diary.&lt;ref name=janke&gt;{{cite news |last=Janke |first=Lynn |date=1971-12-18 |title=Death Hovers Over Dismal Drug Scene: Overdose Victim Leaves a Diary |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/105774143/ |newspaper=The Indianapolis Star |location= |page=6 |access-date=2016-12-21 |via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes |quote="Go Ask Alice," written anonymously, is based on the actual diary of a girl "turned on" to drugs when she was 15.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cumberland&gt;{{cite news |last=Cumberland |first=Donna, Assistant Librarian |date=1972-01-21 |title=Library Jottings: Books For Winter |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/18268671/ |newspaper=[[The Herald Bulletin|Anderson Daily Bulletin]] |location=[[Anderson, Indiana]] |page=8 |access-date=2016-12-21 |via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes |quote=The diary is published by her parents, who wish to remain anonymous...Some events have been changed to protect them, so the book is classified as fiction...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources claimed that the girl's parents had arranged for her diary to be published after her death.&lt;ref name=foster /&gt;&lt;ref name=durchschlag /&gt;&lt;ref name=cumberland /&gt; However, according to Alleen Pace Nilsen, a "reputable source in the publishing world" allegedly said that the book was published anonymously because the parents had initiated legal action and threatened to sue if the published book could be traced back to their daughter.&lt;ref name=nilsenhouse /&gt;

Not long after ''Go Ask Alice''{{'}}s publication, Beatrice Sparks began making public appearances presenting herself as the book's editor.&lt;ref name=white /&gt; (Ellen Roberts, who in the early 1970s was an editor at Prentice Hall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=dePaola |first=Tomie |date=2015 |title=The Magical World of Strega Nona: A Treasury |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKTjDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=New York City |publisher=Nancy Paulsen Books (Penguin Group (USA))|page=vi |isbn=9780399173455 |author-link=Tomie dePaola }}&lt;/ref&gt; was also credited at that time with having edited the book;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |date=1975-03-08 |title=Teachers To Discuss Textbook Censorship |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/52861588/ |newspaper=[[Kansas City Times]] |location=[[Kansas City, Missouri]] |page=4A |access-date=2016-12-21 |via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes |agency=[[The Kansas City Star|The Star]]'s Own Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; a later source refers to Roberts as having "consulted" on the book.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chrispygal.weebly.com/home/ok-this-is-really-happening |title=Christine Potter: Time Travels: OK, This Is Really Happening... |last=Potter |first=Christine |date=2015-09-25 |website=Chrispygal.weebly.com |access-date=2016-12-29 |quote=I worked with editor Ellen Roberts, who'd consulted on the old YA diary ''Go Ask Alice''. |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229193738/http://chrispygal.weebly.com/home/ok-this-is-really-happening |archive-date=2016-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Caitlin White, when Sparks' name became public, some researchers discovered that copyright records listed Sparks as the sole author—not editor—of the book, raising questions about whether she had written it herself.&lt;ref name=white /&gt; Suspicions were heightened in 1979 after two newly published books about troubled teenagers (''Voices'' and ''[[Jay's Journal]]'') advertised Sparks' involvement by calling her "the author who brought you ''Go Ask Alice''".&lt;ref name=nilsenhouse /&gt;&lt;ref name=adams /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=B. Dalton |author-link=B. Dalton  |date=1978-10-15 |title=Voices (advertisement) |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/165717619/ |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location= |page=18 (Book Review section) |access-date=2017-01-06 |via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article by Nilsen, based in part on interviews with Sparks and published in the October 1979 issue of ''[[School Library Journal]]'', Sparks said that she had received the diaries that became ''Go Ask Alice'' from a girl she had befriended at a youth conference. The girl allegedly gave Sparks her diaries in order to help Sparks understand the experiences of young drug users and to prevent her parents from reading them. According to Sparks, the girl later died, although not of an overdose. Sparks said she had then transcribed the diaries, destroying parts of them in the process (with the remaining portions locked in the publisher's vault and unavailable for review by Nilsen or other investigators), and added various fictional elements, including the overdose death. Although Sparks did not confirm or deny the allegations that the diarist's parents had threatened a lawsuit, she did say that in order to get a release from the parents, she had only sought to use the diaries as a "basis to which she would add other incidents and thoughts gleaned from similar case studies," according to Nilsen.&lt;ref name=nilsenhouse /&gt;

Nilsen wrote that Sparks now wanted to be seen as the author of the popular ''Go Ask Alice'' in order to promote additional books in the same vein that she had published or was planning to publish. (These books included ''Jay's Journal'', another alleged diary of a real teenager that Sparks was later accused of mostly authoring herself.&lt;ref name=dieterle /&gt;) Nilsen concluded, "The question of how much of ''Go Ask Alice'' was written by the real Alice and how much by Beatrice Sparks can only be conjectured."&lt;ref name=nilsenhouse /&gt; Journalist Melissa Katsoulis, in her 2009 history of literary hoaxes ''Telling Tales'', wrote that Sparks was never able to substantiate her claim that ''Go Ask Alice'' was based on the real diary of a real girl and that copyright records continued to list her as the sole author of the work.&lt;ref name=katsoulis /&gt;

Urban folklore expert Barbara Mikkelson of [[snopes.com]] has written that even before the authorship revelations, ample evidence indicated that ''Go Ask Alice'' was not an actual diary. According to Mikkelson, the writing style and content—including a lengthy description of an LSD trip but relatively little about "the loss of [the diarist's] one true love", school, gossip or ordinary "chit-chat"— seems uncharacteristic of a teenage girl's diary.&lt;ref name=mikkelson /&gt; The sophisticated vocabulary of the diary suggested that it had been written by an adult rather than a teen.&lt;ref name=mikkelson /&gt;&lt;ref name=bisbort&gt;{{cite book |last=Bisbort |first=Alan |date= |title=Media Scandals |series=Scandals in American History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-4Yjb4C2JUC&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Press|page=93 |isbn=9780313347658 |issn=1942-0102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikkelson also noted that in the decades since the book's publication, no one who knew the diarist had ever been tracked down by a reporter or otherwise spoken about or identified the diarist.&lt;ref name=mikkelson /&gt;

In hindsight, commentators have suggested various motivations for the publishers to present ''Go Ask Alice'' as the work of an anonymous deceased teenager, such as avoiding literary criticism,&lt;ref name=goldberg /&gt; lending validity to an otherwise improbable story,&lt;ref name=goldberg /&gt; and stimulating young readers' interest by having the book's anti-drug advice come from a teenager rather than an adult. Sparks said that while there were "many reasons" for publishing the book anonymously, her main reason was to make it more credible to young readers.&lt;ref name=nilsenhouse /&gt; Although the book has been classified as fiction (see [[#Fiction|Treatment of book as fiction and non-fiction]]), the publisher has continued to list its author as "Anonymous".

===Controversies involving other works by Sparks===
Sparks was involved in a similar controversy regarding the veracity of her second diary project, the 1979 book ''[[Jay's Journal]]''. It was allegedly the real diary, edited by Sparks, of a teenage boy who committed [[suicide]] after becoming involved with the [[occult]].&lt;ref name=goldberg /&gt; The publisher's initial marketing of the book raised questions about whether Sparks had edited a real teenager's diary or written a fictional diary, and recalled the same controversy with respect to ''Go Ask Alice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schwartz |first=Sheila |date=1980-09-21 |title='Jay's Journal' Deplorable  |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/114376157/ |page=17B |newspaper=Poughkeepsie Journal |location=[[Poughkeepsie, New York]] |access-date=2017-01-05 |via=Newspapers.com |subscription=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the family of real-life teenage suicide Alden Barrett contended that ''Jay's Journal'' used 21 entries from Barrett's real diary that the family had given to Sparks, but that the other 191 entries in the published book had been fictionalized or fabricated by Sparks, and that Barrett had not been involved with the occult or "devil worship".&lt;ref name=dieterle&gt;{{cite news|last=Dieterle |first=Ben |date=2004-06-03 |title=Teen Death Diary |url=http://www.slweekly.com/editorial/2004/feat_2004-06-03.cfm |dead-url=yes |newspaper=Salt Lake City Weekly |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629192655/http://www.slweekly.com/editorial/2004/feat_2004-06-03.cfm |archive-date=2006-06-29 |access-date=2016-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sparks went on to produce numerous other books presented as diaries of anonymous troubled teens (including ''Annie's Baby: The Diary of Anonymous, a Pregnant Teenager'' and ''It Happened to Nancy: By an Anonymous Teenager'') or edited transcripts of therapy sessions with teens (including ''[[Almost Lost: The True Story of an Anonymous Teenager's Life on the Streets]]''). Some commentators have noted that these books use writing styles similar to ''Go Ask Alice''&lt;ref name=adams /&gt; and contain similar themes, such as tragic consequences for spending time with bad companions, a protagonist who initially gets into trouble by accident or through someone else's actions, and portrayal of premarital sex and homosexuality as always wrong.&lt;ref name=goldberg /&gt; Although Sparks was typically listed on these books as editor or preparer, the number of similar books that Sparks published, making her "arguably the most prolific Anonymous author in publishing",&lt;ref name=bisbort /&gt; fueled suspicions that she wrote ''Go Ask Alice''.&lt;ref name=adams /&gt;&lt;ref name=bisbort /&gt;

===Linda Glovach authorship claims===
In a 1998 ''New York Times'' book review, Mark Oppenheimer suggested that ''Go Ask Alice'' had at least one author besides Sparks. He identified Linda Glovach, an author of [[young-adult novel]]s, as "one of the 'preparers'—let's call them forgers—of ''Go Ask Alice''", although he did not give his source for this claim.&lt;ref name=oppenheimer /&gt; ''Publishers Weekly'', in a review of Glovach's 1998 novel ''Beauty Queen'' (which told the story, in diary form, of a 19-year-old girl addicted to [[heroin]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glovach |first=Linda |date=1998 |title=Beauty Queen |url= |location=New York City |publisher=HarperCollins  |page= |isbn=978-0-06-205161-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also stated that Glovach was "a co-author of ''Go Ask Alice''".&lt;ref name=pw&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Beauty Queen |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-205161-5 |magazine=[[Publishers Weekly]] |location=New York City |publisher=publishersweekly.com |date= |access-date=2016-12-22 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222161131/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-205161-5 |archive-date=2016-12-22 |quote=FYI: Glovach is a co-author of Go Ask Alice.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment of book as fiction and non-fiction==
[[File:Go_Ask_Alice_-_Cover_art_of_2011_Arrow_Books_(UK)_paperback_edition.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the 2011 Arrow Books paperback edition, containing the words "This Is Alice's True Story"]]Following Sparks' statements that she had added fictional elements to ''Go Ask Alice'', the book was classified by its publishers as fiction (and remains so classified as of 2016) and a disclaimer was added to the copyright page: "This book is a work of fiction. Any references to historical events, real people, or real locales are used fictitiously. Other names, characters, places, and incidents are the product of the author's imagination, and [[all persons fictitious disclaimer|any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental]]."&lt;ref name=yagoda /&gt; 

Despite the classification and the disclaimer, ''Go Ask Alice'' has frequently been taught as non-fiction in schools and sold as non-fiction in bookstores.&lt;ref name=goldberg /&gt; The publishers also continued to suggest that the book was true by including the "Editors' Note" stating that the book was based on an actual diary, and listing the author as "Anonymous", with no mention of Sparks.&lt;ref name=yagoda /&gt; As of 2011, a UK paperback edition published and marketed by [[Random House|Arrow Books]] contained the statement "This Is Alice's True Story" on the front cover.&lt;ref name=alicearrow /&gt;

==Censorship==
''Go Ask Alice'' has been a frequent target of censorship [[challenge (literature)|challenge]]s due to its inclusion of profanity and references to runaways, drugs, sex and rape.&lt;ref name=businessclarksville /&gt; Alleen Pace Nilsen wrote that in 1973, ''Go Ask Alice'' was "''the'' book that teens wanted to read and that adults wanted to censor" and that the censors "felt the book did more to glorify sex and drugs than to frighten kids away from them."&lt;ref name=nilsenreminiscing /&gt; Challenges began in the early 1970s following the initial publication of the book, and continued at a high rate through the ensuing decades.&lt;ref name=businessclarksville /&gt; 

Some challenges resulted in the removal of the book from libraries, or in parental permission being required for a student to check the book out of a library.&lt;ref name=businessclarksville /&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', in the 1970s it became common practice for school libraries to keep ''Go Ask Alice'' off library shelves and make it available to students only upon request, a practice which was criticized as being a form of censorship.&lt;ref name=whatreviewerswrote /&gt; A 1982 survey of school librarians across the United States, co-sponsored by the [[National Council of Teachers of English]], found that ''Go Ask Alice'' was the most frequently censored book in high school libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=The Associated Press| authorlink=Associated Press |date=1982-11-28 |title=Librarians Say 'Go Ask Alice' Is Censored Most in Schools |url= | work=The New York Times |location= |page=73 |via=ProQuest |subscription=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schoollibrary&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/135026205/ |title=School Library Censorship Increasing |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1982-12-05 |newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]] |location=[[Palm Beach County, Florida]] |access-date=2016-12-22 |page=AA10 |agency=Associated Press| via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Decades after its original publication, ''Go Ask Alice'' became one of the most challenged books of the 1990s and 2000s.

The likely authoring of the book by one or more adults rather than by an unnamed teenage girl has not been an issue in censorship disputes.&lt;ref name=yagoda /&gt;&lt;ref name=businessclarksville /&gt; Nilsen and others have criticized this on the basis that the dishonesty of presenting a probable fake memoir to young readers as real should raise greater concerns than the content.&lt;ref name=nilsenreminiscing /&gt;&lt;ref name=goldberg /&gt;&lt;ref name=valentine /&gt;

==Adaptations==

== In popular culture ==

Stand-up comedian [[Paul F. Tompkins]]' 2009 comedy album ''Freak Wharf'' contains a track entitled "Go Ask Alice" in which he derides the book as "the phoniest of balonies" and jokingly suggests it was authored by the writing staff of the police drama series ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''. The album title itself comes from a passage in the book in which the diarist refers to a mental hospital as a "freak wharf".

American [[metalcore]] band [[Ice Nine Kills]] included a song related to the book, entitled "Alice", on their 2015 album ''[[Every Trick in the Book]]''.

==Background==
The poet [[John Mayne]] from [[Dumfries]], South West Scotland, a comparatively obscure follower of the Scottish Muses, had attempted a poem on the subject of [[Halloween]] in 1780.&lt;ref name=May/&gt; Having twelve stanzas, the poem makes note of pranks at Halloween; ''"What fearfu' pranks ensue!"'', as well as the supernatural associated with the night, ''"Bogies"'' (ghosts).&lt;ref name=May/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ulsterscots/words/bogie Ulster Scots - Words and Phrases:"Bogie"] ''[[BBC]]'' Retrieved December 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The poem appeared in ''Ruddimans Weekly Magazine'', November 1780, published by [[Walter Ruddiman]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=May/&gt; That the [[Ayrshire]] poet Burns actually saw and was influenced by Mayne's composition is apparent, as he appears to communicate with Mayne's work, and also echoes some of his imagery.&lt;ref name=May&gt;Robert Chambers [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sdVkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=halloween+poem+(burns)&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YaX2TI2CH4uwhQfP_8GKCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=halloween%20poem%20(burns)&amp;f=false The life and works of Robert Burns, Volume 1] Lippincott, Grambo &amp; co., 1854 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Crawford [https://books.google.com/books?id=BDCsAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=scottish+halloween+traditions+-+burns+poem&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_qv2TKz9EIyIhQee78ShAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Burns: a study of the poems and songs] Stanford University Press, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; According to Burns, Halloween is "thought to be a night when witches, devils, and other mischief-making beings are all abroad on their baneful midnight errands".&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]] (1833) [https://books.google.com/books?id=y9A0uAW929EC&amp;pg=PA342&amp;dq=thought+to+be+a+night+when+witches,+devils,+and+other+mischief-making+beings&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WZMvTdfWMY6AhQfL-ZjhCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=thought%20to%20be%20a%20night%20when%20witches%2C%20devils%2C%20and%20other%20mischief-making%20beings&amp;f=false The Penny Cyclopaedia of the Society for the Difussion of Useful Knowledge, Volume 1] p.342.

==Analysis==

A poem recited by Scots at Halloween, Robert Burns' poetry revolves around country and town life, the life he knew, and by using [[Scots language|Scots]] alongside English, and by the sheer power of his expression in both, Burns gives an account of the charms of the West of Scotland.&lt;ref name=Bur/&gt;{{According to whom|date=November 2017}}

== Characteristics ==
The poem has 28 stanzas.

[[File:Accra Homowo um1900 300dpi.jpg|thumb|A street in [[Accra]]. Many people from nearby neighborhoods and the surrounding area flock to the city center in order to attend the celebration of the Homowo Festival, the annual main festival of the [[Ga people|Ga]], around 1900]]
[[File:Course cycliste organisée à Teshie lors du festival Homowo 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Bicycle race]] in Teshie during the Homowo Festival in 2009]]

'''Homowo''' is a festival celebrated by the [[Ga-Adangbe people|Ga people]] of [[Ghana]]. The [[festival]] starts in the month of May with the planting of crops before the [[rainy season]] starts. During the festival, they perform a dance called Kpanlogo. The Ga people celebrate Homowo in the remembrance of the famine that once happened in their history in precolonial Ghana.

== Etymology ==
The word Homowo (''Homo'' - hunger, ''wo'' - hoot) can mean "to hoot (or jeer) at hunger" in the Ga language.&lt;ref name="roots"&gt; The [[Library of Congress]]'s article on Homowo. Retrieved 08 September 07&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of Homowo started with a period of hunger leading to [[famine]] due to failure of the seasonal [[rain]]s needed by crops in the [[Greater Accra Region]], where the Ga people predominantly dwell.  When the rains returned to normal, the Ga people celebrated by creating the Homowo festival, hence its name and meaning. Homowo is greatly celebrated in all the towns in the Ga state with celebrations climaxing in Gamashie. The celebration begins with the planting of maize, which will be used in preparing the food for the festival named Kpokpoi or Kpekple. During this period, noise making is prohibited or banned since it is believed that it will hinder the maturity of the crop. The meal is eaten with [[Palm Nut Soup]] and it is also sprinkled within the town. This is normally done by traditional leaders and family heads. Celebration includes marching down roads and streets beating drums, chanting, face painting, singing and traditional dances. On this day there is usually a lot of traffic and roads are usually blocked off to accommodate the festival. Even though it is a Ga tradition, many other ethnic groups are welcomed to also join in the celebration.

Some of the towns that celebrate Homowo are La, Teshie, Nungua, Osu, Ga-Mashie, Tema among others.

"'''I've Got You Under My Skin'''" is episode 14 of season one in the television show ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. Just as [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]] succeeds at opening [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] up about [[Allen Francis Doyle|Doyle]] and the events surrounding his death, she suffers a vision about an ancient Ethros demon, which turns out to have been possessing a young boy, Ryan Anderson, for years. Angel, [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce|Wesley]] and Cordelia perform an exorcism that expels the demon from the child, but it escapes the trap they set and roams free to possess once more. Even worse, they learn that the mass-murdering Ethros demon does ''not'' pose the biggest threat to the Anderson family's well-being.

==Plot==
Cordelia finally gets Angel to talk about [[Allen Francis Doyle|Doyle's]] death when she suddenly has a vision. Angel and Wesley go to the envisioned house in the suburbs when a boy named Ryan from the house walks out onto the street. Angel saves him from an oncoming car, and he talks with the parents, Paige and Seth. Noticing that something is off but not sure what is going on, Angel takes advantage of Paige's overflowing gratitude and takes her up on a dinner invitation about which Seth clearly disapproves. Outside, Wesley finds glowing goo called "plakticine" (similar to [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]]) oozing from the foundation all around the house and they realize someone in the house is possessed by a powerful mass-murdering Ethros demon. Angel suspects the father, but the only way to be sure which family member is possessed is to have each ingest [[eucalyptus]] powder, which will force the demon to manifest. They mix the powder with brownies that Angel brings to dinner, where Angel watches Seth carefully and it isn't until the daughter Stephanie screams that he sees the demon horrifically manifesting in Ryan before the boy falls unconscious. Paige is frantic and accuses Angel of poisoning her son, but Seth supports Angel, reminding Paige that something has been truly wrong with the boy since long before Angel's advent. They agree to attempt an exorcism and take the boy and his parents back to Angel's place for preparations.

Cordelia establishes a magic circle of protection around the bed to bind Ryan there. Stressing that Ryan is not himself anymore, Angel warns Seth and Paige, particularly Paige, that they risk being killed if they break the barrier or go anywhere near the boy. Angel and Wesley try to make contact with the priest reputed to be professionally trained to perform exorcisms but find that he has died and they must attempt the exorcism themselves. Meanwhile, Ryan has seemingly regained consciousness and commences tormenting Paige with guilt at leaving him abandoned and alone in the dark. Her resolve breaks, and when she rushes to his side he begins strangling her; after a tense few minutes, Wesley and Angel rush into the bedroom and manage to pull Paige from Ryan's choke hold, but their efforts send the demon deeper, and the boy again lapses into unconsciousness. Upon learning from Cordelia's research that expelling the demon will send him to the nearest "warm body", Angel sends her to procure an Ethros box from Rick's Magick &amp; Stuff, which is supposed to hold the Ethros demon. Rick's, however, does not have an Ethros Box, so Cordelia instead buys a box intended for another type of demon. While Cordelia shops, Wesley attempts the exorcism. He manages to raise the demon far enough to animate the boy once more, and the Ethros cruelly taunts him about his inadequacies as a youth and as a Watcher until Wesley grows visibly more distracted and vulnerable. He fails. Someone or something telekinetically uses marbles on the table to write the words, "Save me". The demon taunts Angel and he wraps his hand with a length of cloth, grabs the cross and Wesley's small volume of incantations, and strides into the bedroom. Holding the cross pressed to Ryan's chest, Angel ignores the pain of his hand sizzling through the protective layers and begins to chant, his voice growing louder and more commanding as he repeats the ritual phrases until, finally, he shouts, "Now get the hell out!" With an invisible rush, the demon is expelled from the boy, but the box Cordelia bought is unable to contain the demon's energy and shatters.

Some time later, after sending the Andersons home, the AI team tries to determine the demon's current whereabouts. They realize the Ethros demon will need to take corporeal form to recharge itself after expending so much energy to escape. Leaving Cordelia behind, Welsey and Angel search the sea caves and find the Ethros demon. They are surprised when the evil being reveals that the boy Ryan is  soulless. The demon had been inside the boy, but unable to manifest because of Ryan's naturally evil personality until Ryan ate Angel's brownies. They realize that the "save me" message was from the demon, and the boy walking in front of the car on the first night was the demon sleepwalking Ryan to kill him. Angel kills the demon swiftly, and he and Wesley realize that the Andersons are in even greater danger now that they believe themselves safe at last.

That night in the Andersons' home after everyone is asleep, Ryan, his door unlocked for the first time in a long time, steals matches from Seth's bedstand, then locks his parents' door shut with a toy block. Ignoring his now-awake parents as they struggle to open the door, the boy sloshes gasoline over his sister's toys and furniture, then lights a match and tosses it down. The room ignites with a whoosh, cutting Stephanie off from the door by a wall of flame. Seth and Paige finally burst out and find Ryan staring entranced at the roaring flames while Stephanie screams from behind them. Angel suddenly crashes through the window opposite and scoops Stephanie into his arms as Wesley hustles Ryan and his parents down the hall to safety. A little while later, Angel and Seth stand outside while firemen contain the blaze. Behind Seth, Paige and Stephanie huddle together near the front door. Detective [[Kate Lockley]] comes over to inform Seth that [[Social Services]] is taking custody of Ryan, and that they can see him in the morning, but that there won't be anything to report until after the evaluation. Angel redirects Seth's attention from the son he cannot save to the wife and daughter he has already protected. Almost imperceptibly nodding his thanks, Seth turns to embrace his welcoming family. Angel makes his own way out to the sidewalk.

==Production==

===Writing===
This was "one of the very early scripts that we wrote before Doyle was killed," says writer [[Tim Minear]]. He struggled with the story until coming up with the idea that Angel should accidentally call Wesley "Doyle", which gave the script a cohesive theme about the pain of losing a family member.  At the end of the episode Seth Anderson loses his son, and at the beginning Angel has lost someone like a son; Minear says both are "desperately trying to keep their family together, and through no fault of their own, they can't."&lt;ref name="Minear"&gt;{{Citation |title=ANGEL: Season One, Episode By Episode with Tim Minear - Part 3 |first=Edward |last=Gross |date=August 28, 2000 |publisher=TimMinear.net |accessdate=2007-09-17 |url=http://www.timminear.net/archives/angel/000041.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joss Whedon]] came up with the twist that Ryan Anderson was more evil than the demon who possessed him. He also cut the priest who, in the first draft of the script, performed the exorcism. Whedon questioned why Wesley couldn't perform the ritual, and Minear says, "Suddenly it makes perfect sense, because Angel's problem at the beginning of the story is, 'I let Doyle die... because he did something that I couldn't do.' Now you have Wesley saying, 'I can perform this exorcism; you can't.'" When Angel later saves Wesley's life, Minear says "he's sort of atoning for the Doyle thing."&lt;ref name="Minear"/&gt;

===Continuity===
* Cordelia squabbling in the kitchen with a coworker-turned-friend is so reminiscent of past episodes (e.g., "[[Rm w/a Vu]]"), that Angel actually calls Wesley 'Doyle.'
* When Ethros speaks with Doyle's voice, he refers to events in "[[Hero (Angel)|Hero]]," also discussed earlier the previous day by Cordelia and Angel.
* Just as he indicates to Cordelia at the end of "[[Somnambulist (Angel)|Somnambulist]]," Angel here tells Wesley that being prepared to kill him if he turns evil again is a good thing.
* Angel and Wesley each seem to possess a double-bladed Bavarian fighting axe. Cordelia asks [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] about Angel's in "[[I Will Remember You (Angel)|I Will Remember You]]" when, believing [[Angel Investigations]] is closing its doors forever, she begins tagging items for inventory. Wesley brings his new one into the office in "[[Expecting (Angel)|Expecting]]," prompting Cordelia's friend Serena to remark, "nice ax."
* When Angel, Cordelia and Wesley initially suspect that the father is the possessed person, Wesley says that a father "doesn't need to be possessed to terrorize his children," then quickly stops talking. This is one of the earliest hints at Wesley's issues with his own father.
*This episode marks the second instance of a human being fully or partially soulless; the first was Buffy  in "[[Living Conditions (Buffy episode)|Living Conditions]]."

===Cultural references===
* [[I've Got You Under My Skin (song)|I've Got You Under My Skin]]: This episode shares its title with a song that became a signature of [[Frank Sinatra]].
* [[Lizzie Borden]]: When Wesley mentions the famous Massachusetts woman accused of murdering her parents with an axe, Angel explains that the Ethros demon possessing her was only an adolescent.
* [[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]: During the discussion about how to determine which Anderson family member is possessed, Cordelia asks if the demon will manifest by spinning its host's head around. Later, she asks whether Angel wants to protect his bedroom floor, in case there's "any big vomiting." These phrases both refer to the film ''The Exorcist''. (Incidentally, Cordelia previously referred to ''The Exorcist'' in "[[I Only Have Eyes for You (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|I Only Have Eyes for You]]".)
* [[Thighmaster]]: When Angel cites Wesley's lack of resistance even to sales suggestion, Wesley protests that his second Thighmaster was a free gift.
* [[Fivefold kiss|Blessed be]]: Rick the Clerk's greeting to Cordelia is a common Wiccan greeting.

The '''jigsaw''' technique is a method of organizing classroom activity that makes students dependent on each other to succeed. It breaks classes into groups and breaks assignments into pieces that the group assembles to complete the (jigsaw) puzzle. It was designed by social psychologist [[Elliot Aronson]] to help weaken racial cliques in forcibly integrated schools.&lt;ref name=" jigsaw website "/&gt;&lt;ref name="aronsonBasics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Aronson |first=  E. (n.d.)|title=Jigsaw Basics}} Retrieved December 5, 2012, from [https://www.jigsaw.org/pdf/JigsawBasics.pdf jigsaw.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jigsawClassroom"&gt;{{cite web|last=Perkins, D. V. |first= &amp; Tagler, M. J. (n.d.)|title=Jigsaw Classroom}} Retrieved December 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique splits classes into mixed groups to work on small problems that the group collates into a final outcome.&lt;ref name="jigsaw website"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lestik, M.|first=  &amp; Plous, S. |title=Jigsaw Classroom|year=2012}} Retrieved October 24, 2012, from [http://www.jigsaw.org jigsaw.org]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an in-class assignment is divided into topics. Students are then split into groups with one member assigned to each topic. Working individually, each student learns about his or her topic and presents it to their group. Next, students gather into groups divided by topic. Each member presents again to the topic group. In same-topic groups, students reconcile points of view and synthesize information. They create a final report. Finally, the original groups reconvene and listen to presentations from each member. The final presentations provide all group members with an understanding of their own material, as well as the findings that have emerged from topic-specific group discussion.

== History ==
In the late 1950s, America was going through desegregation of public schools. In 1954, the [[Brown v. Board of Education]] decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] created a legal requirement for integration of public schools by ruling that separating schools made them inherently unequal. Actual integration was a painful process, taking years.

Schools were plagued with fights, discrimination, and hate crimes. White supremacist groups and hateful white students terrorized new students. This prevented students from feeling safe in their schools and harmed all their learning abilities. Students often could hardly sit in the same room together without incident, much less work together. This created a problem for teachers, students, parents, communities, and the country alike, as an entire generation of students were distracted from learning by rampant hatred and discrimination.

It was at this time that psychologists were pulled in to advise schools on what to do to correct this problem. In 1971, Dr. [[Elliot Aronson]] was hired to advise an [[Austin, Texas]] school district on how to defuse the problems of hostile classrooms and distrust between the students. Aronson was a psychologist at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] at the time, and took a psychological approach to help fix the problems in the classrooms. 
Competition among students had become extremely high. It was quickly realized that the competitive nature of the classroom encouraged students to taunt each other and discriminate against those different than them, so that they might vault themselves higher in status. In order to counter this problem, students were placed in diversified groups so that they would be required to work together and reduce the competitive atmosphere. Students were having difficulty adjusting to the mixing of ethnicity in the classroom. Aronson created an atmosphere for increased collaboration and reduction of the resistance to work with one another. Aronson created assignments that made every member of the group equally important. The students had to pay attention and obtain much information from other group members. This allows for each member of the group to add a small piece of the larger picture so that they are all important to the group. This teaches the students to rely on each other and reduces their competitive attitudes toward each other because they need everyone in their group to do well because their grade depends on the other students.&lt;ref name=" jigsaw website "/&gt;

==Research findings==
Students in jigsaw classrooms ("jigsaws") showed a decrease in prejudice and stereotyping, liked in-group and out-group members more, showed higher levels of self-esteem, performed better on standardized exams, liked school more, reduced absenteeism, and mixed with students of other races in areas other than the classroom compared to students in traditional classrooms ("trads").

===Bridgeman===
Diane Bridgeman demonstrated that jigsaws displayed greater empathy than trads. She assessed fifth-graders.

Half of her subjects had spent two months in a jigsaw classroom while the other half were in a traditional classroom. The children viewed cartoons to assess their empathy. Trads displayed lower empathy than jigsaws.

===Geffner===
Geffner assessed fifth-graders' attitudes about themselves, school, and other students. He worked in the Santa Cruz County, California, school district which had a ratio of 50% Caucasian students to 50% Hispanic students. He assessed trads, jigsaws and students in classrooms that used a cooperative technique that did not rely on interdependence ("coops"). He used a modified version of Blaney's questionnaire and a modified version of the Pictorial Concept Scale for Children. This scale placed cartoon stick figures in various situations, including five self-esteem dimensions: athletic abilities, scholastic abilities, physical appearance, family interactions and social interactions. These measures were used as pre- and post-intervention measures. Interventions lasted eight weeks.

Coops and jigsaws improved or maintained positive attitudes about themselves, school, peers and academic abilities and self-esteem. Trads demonstrated poorer attitudes about peers, themselves, and academic abilities.

===Blaney, Stephan, Rosenfield, Aronson and Sikes===
The first experiment with the jigsaw classroom was by Blaney, Stephan, Rosenfield, Aronson, and Sikes in 1977. The technique was assessed in ten fifth grade classes across seven schools.

Three fifth grade classes from each school were the controls. Trad teachers were peer-rated as good teachers. The experimental classes worked in jigsaw groups for 45 minutes a day, three days a week, for six weeks. Both groups used similar curricula. The jigsaw groups contained members from all ethnic groups. Student questionnaires assessed attitudes about themselves, school and toward peer teaching, cooperation and attitudes towards group members other students in the class. These measures were used as pre- and post-intervention.

Significant increases were seen in jigsaw self-esteem accompanied by a decrease in trad self-esteem. Jigsaw students liked school more, (Caucasians generally, Mexican-Americans slightly, but not African-Americans.) Trad students liked school less (Caucasians generally, not Mexican-Americans, and African-Americans significantly.) The authors contribute this to the fact that Mexican-American jigsaws may have felt forced to participate in peer teaching. Two other questions produced significant results. Competitiveness among jigsaws decreased and increased among trads. Jigsaws felt they could learn more from other students while trads did not. Students reported increase liking of their group members, but they also increased their liking of other students in the class.&lt;ref name=" jigsaw website "/&gt;

===Hänze and Berger===

Hänze and Berger assessed 12th-grade physics classes in 2007. They took eight 12th-grade classes and randomly assigned them to either the jigsaw technique or direct instruction. Students were assessed for academic performance and completed a questionnaire looking at personality variables (goal orientation, self-concept, and uncertainty orientation). The topics (motion of electrons and electromagnetic oscillations and waves) were introduced through direct instruction in both branches. Students completed the learning experience questionnaire after the instruction as a pretest measure. Jigsaws were given the learning experience questionnaire after working in the expert group and after working in the jigsaw group. Trads were given the learning experience questionnaire at the end of the lesson.

Academic performance was reasessed a few days after the learning unit. Clear difference emerged in the learning experience, but not in academic performances. Jigsaws showed higher achievement in their "expert" areas, but trads scored better on areas that jigsaws learned from their peers. Jigsaws had a more favorable view of the learning experience, stronger intrinsic motivation, greater interest in the topic and more cognitive activation and involvement than trads. Jigsaws were more involved and more interested in the material and were seen as more competent, more socially related to other students and more autonomous. Indirect effects on performance were implied because students viewed themselves as more competent, but without direct impact on achievement.&lt;ref name="12thGrade"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hänze, M. |first=  &amp; Berger, R. |title=Cooperative learning, motivational effects, and student characteristics: An experimental study comparing cooperative learning and direct instruction in 12th grade physics classes|year=2007 |journal=Learning and Instruction |volume=17 |pp=29–41 |doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2006.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perkins and Saris===

Perkins and Saris assessed an undergraduate statistics course in 2001. They noted that a part of class instruction was doing worksheets. Worksheets give immediate feedback, allow for repeated practice, make students active rather than passive learners and allow students to ask for help from the instructor. Drawbacks include students' uneven readiness the substantial time required to complete.

Students worked in groups on two separate occasions. In the first, four worksheets were supplied. Pairs of students were given the same worksheet and worked together to compute various statistical quantities. For the first study an example of the computation and interpretation were provided. After discussion, students received one of two worksheets that directed them through the steps for completing the procedures for one of the remaining designs with a partial solution for each step.

The handout also contained the next-to-last step for the other design. One group of students received step-by-step instruction and partial solutions for the second and a nearly complete solution for the third design and the other group received step-by-step information for the third design and the almost complete solution for the second. Students were instructed to work with a classmate holding a complementary handout. Students were then asked to rate the exercise on usefulness of getting help, giving help, working with classmates, providing an alternative to a lecture, saving time and understanding the statistical procedures.

Students perceived the jigsaw procedure as being very positive especially as an alternative learning experience. Jigsaws rated the technique as more useful for practical purposes than for interpersonal purposes such as working with others or giving/getting help. Students appreciated the technique as a time-saver and viewed it is a change of pace.&lt;ref name="statisticsCourse"&gt;{{cite web|last=Perkins, D. V. |first=  &amp; Saris, R. N. |title=A "Jigsaw Classroom" technique for undergraduate statistics courses|year=2001 |journal=Teaching of Psychology |volume=28 |pp=111–113|accessdate= December 5, 2012 |url=http://top.sagepub.com/content/28/2/111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walker and Crogan===

Walker and Crogan looked at the effects of a [[cooperative learning]] environment, the jigsaw method and traditional classes on academic performance, self-esteem, liking of school, liking of peers and racial prejudice in Australia. They looked at 103 students in grades 4–6 at one private and one public school. Cooperative learning was used as a baseline measure for the effects of cooperation.

The sixth-grade and fifth grade classes hosted coops and trads, respectively. The study was confounded by changes in procedures for the coops and the departure of the trad teacher, resulting in a shortened, four week schedule. The choice to designate the sixth grade class as "traditional cooperation" rather than "failed jigsaw" was criticized by Bratt. In the public school, a fourth-grade class experienced a three-week jigsaw program. The trad class was a split fourth/fifth-grade class. Each experimental branch had a same-school control.

For the private school, there were 31 students in the experimental group and 29 students in the control group. At the public school, there were 20 students and two teachers in the experimental group, with 23 students and only one teacher in the control group. Teachers were given a description of the program and the key facts were discussed with them.

Public school jigsaw groups balanced ethnicity, academic ability and sex evenly. "Best" friends and "worst" enemies were separated. Prior to implementation, jigsaws familiarized themselves with their group peers, practiced their roles as peer tutors and practiced relevant skills such as discussing main ideas, reading for meaning, listening and quizzing peers on important information.

At the private school, students in the experimental class received the cooperative learning program for 90 minutes each day, twice a week, for four weeks. At the public school, students in the experimental class received the Jigsaw program for an hour a day, five days a week, for three weeks. Measures were taken pre- and post-intervention. Academic performance data was available only from the public school. Self-esteem was measured by the Piers-Harris Children's Self-concept Scale (CSCS). Students rated their classmates according to how much they would like to work and play with them. Racial prejudice measures were assessed students’ attitudes to Asian-Australians, Aborigines and European-Australians using one measure of social distance and one of stereotyping.

Academic performance improved for those in the Jigsaw group. Jigsaw self-esteem increased at both schools compared to trads, for liking of school and for playing with peers but the gains were not significant. Jigsaws increased their ratings in working with peers when compared to their relative control group. Coops were not motivated by the prospect of working cooperatively.

Jigsaws liked ingroup and outgroup peers more in work-oriented relationships, but not for coops. Social distance ratings for Asian-Australian and European-Australian children decreased across the program, but European-Australian ratings increased. Jigsaws attributed fewer negative traits to Asian- and European-Australians. Coops showed an increase in stereotyping. The study demonstrated that the Jigsaw method is effective in Australian social conditions in producing positive change in academic performance, attitudes to peers and prejudice. Cooperative learning on the other hand produced generally negative results. Interdependence seemed to be more important than cooperation.&lt;ref name="walkerCrogan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker, I. |first= &amp; Crogan, M. (1998)|title=Academic performance, prejudice, and the jigsaw classroom: New pieces to the puzzle}} ''Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology'', ''8'', 381-393&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bratt ===

Bratt presented two studies on Jigsaw, one in grade 6 (Study 1), one in grades 8 to 10 (Study 2). Bratt focused on the claimed effectiveness of Jigsaw to reduce prejudice. The first study gave similar findings as Walker and Crogan, but Bratt stressed that the data could not be interpreted as establishing positive Jigsaw effects.
Bratt’s Study 1 included two schools, with one Jigsaw class and one control class at each school. The experiment covered seven weeks. The analysis focused on ethnic Norwegian children (n = 34 in each class).&lt;ref name="BrattC"&gt;Bratt, C. (2008). The jigsaw classroom under test: No effect on intergroup relations present. ''Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology'', ''18'', 403-419&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of sixth graders was confounded by the fact that the Jigsaw class had two teachers whereas the control class had only one teacher.&lt;ref name="BrattC"/&gt;

Study 2 assessed 11 Jigsaw classes and 11 matched control classes. Jigsaw teachers were well trained and repeatedly met during the eight-week experiment. The analysis focused on 264 ethnic Norwegian students. Study 2 failed to indicate effects of Jigsaw on intergroup attitudes, cross-group friendship, [[common ingroup identity]], empathy and attitudes toward school. These variables were measured before, immediately after and six months after the first measure. 

Bratt concluded that the two studies did not support Jigsaw. Bratt also pointed out methodological limitations in previous studies, arguing that due to these limitations there was still no empirical evidence to conclude that the Jigsaw technique reduces prejudice. For instance, Walker and Crogan reclassified a Jigsaw class as a control class after the Jigsaw technique failed in this class.&lt;ref name="BrattC"/&gt;

'''Kindergarten''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɪ|n|d|ər|ˌ|g|ɑːr|t|ən}}, {{IPAc-en|audio=GT Kindergarten AE.ogg|US|-|d|ən}}; from [[German language|German]] {{IPA-de|ˈkɪndɐˌɡaːɐ̯tn̩||GT Kindergarten deutsch.ogg}}, literally meaning 'garden for the children')&lt;ref&gt;The term was coined in the metaphorical sense of "place where children can grow in a natural way", not in the literal sense of having a "garden".&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[preschool]] educational approach based on playing, singing, practical activities such as drawing, and social interaction as part of the transition from home to school. Such institutions were originally created in the late 18th century in [[Bavaria]] and [[Strasbourg]] to serve children whose parents both worked outside home. The term was coined by the German [[Friedrich Fröbel]], whose approach globally influenced early-years education. Today, the term is used in many countries to describe a variety of [[educational institution]]s and [[learning space]]s for children ranging from two to seven years of age, based on a variety of teaching methods.
==History==
[[File:Max_Liebermann_Kleinkinderschule_in_Amsterdam_1880.jpg|thumb|Kindergarten in Amsterdam 1880, by [[Max Liebermann]]]]In 1779, [[Johann Friedrich Oberlin]] and Louise Scheppler founded in [[Strasbourg]] an early establishment for caring for and educating pre-school children whose parents were absent during the day.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Lorenzo Knapp (1843), ''Female biography; containing notices of distinguished women, in different nations and ages''. Philadelphia: Thomas Wardle. p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, in 1780, similar infant establishments were established in [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Berger, [http://www.kindergartenpaedagogik.de/414.html "Kurze Chronik der ehemaligen und gegenwärtigen Ausbildungsstätten für Kleinkindlehrerinnen, Kindergärtnerinnen, Hortnerinnen ... und ErzieherInnen in Bayern"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904234012/http://www.kindergartenpaedagogik.de/414.html |date=September 4, 2013 }} in "Das Kita-Handbuch", ed.

He published many works on the subject, and his work became the model for infant schools throughout England and further afield. Play was an important part of Wilderspin's system of education. He is credited with inventing the [[playground]]. In 1823, Wilderspin published ''On the Importance of Educating the Infant Poor'', based on the school. He began working for the Infant School Society the next year, informing others about his views. He also wrote ''The Infant System, for developing the physical, intellectual, and moral powers of all children from 1 to seven years of age''.

[[File:Frederick-Froebel-Bardeen.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|[[Friedrich Fröbel]] was one of the most influential founders of kindergartens, and he coined the name in 1840.]]
Countess [[Theresa Brunszvik]] (1775–1861), who had known and been influenced by [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]], was influenced by this example to open an ''Angyalkert'' ("angel garden" in Hungarian) on May 27, 1828, in her residence in [[Budapest|Buda]], the first of eleven care centers that she founded for young children.&lt;ref&gt;Budapest Lexikon, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Public Preschool Education In Hungary: A Historical Survey, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836 she established an institute for the foundation of preschool centers. The idea became popular among the nobility and the middle class and was copied throughout the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

[[Friedrich Fröbel]] (1782–1852) opened a "play and activity" institute in 1837 in the village of [[Bad Blankenburg]] in the [[principality]] of [[Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]], Thuringia, as an experimental social experience for children entering school. He renamed his institute ''{{lang|de|Kindergarten}}'' on June 28, 1840, reflecting his belief that children should be nurtured and nourished "like plants in a garden".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fi/books?id=QfBV-nd1bqAC&amp;q=p%C3%A4dagogischen+n%C3%A4hrbodens#v=snippet&amp;q=p%C3%A4dagogischen%20n%C3%A4hrbodens&amp;f=false Kinder bilden Sprache - Sprache bildet Kinder], p. 24 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Women trained by Fröbel opened kindergartens throughout Europe and around the world. The [[First Kindergarten|first kindergarten]] in the US was founded in [[Watertown, Wisconsin]] in 1856 and was conducted in German by Margaretha Meyer-Schurz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watertownhistory.org Watertown Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Peabody]] founded the first English-language kindergarten in the US in 1860. The first free kindergarten in the US was founded in 1870 by [[Conrad Poppenhusen]], a German industrialist and philanthropist, who also established the [[Poppenhusen Institute]]. The first publicly financed kindergarten in the US was established in [[St. Louis]] in 1873 by [[Susan Blow]].

Canada's first private kindergarten was opened by the [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyan Methodist Church]] in [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]], in 1870.

{{see also|Education in Afghanistan}}
[[File:AF-kindergarten.jpg|frame|A kindergarten classroom in Afghanistan]]

In [[Afghanistan]], children between the ages of 3 and 6 attend kindergartens ({{lang-prs|کودکستان}}; {{lang-ps|وړکتون}}). Although kindergartens in Afghanistan are not part of the school system, they are often run by the government.

Early Childhood Development programs were first introduced during the Soviet occupation with the establishment in 1980 of 27 urban preschools, or kodakistan. The number of preschools grew steadily during the 1980s, peaking in 1990 with more than 270 in Afghanistan. At this peak, there were 2,300 teachers caring for more than 21,000 children in the country. These facilities were an urban phenomenon, mostly in Kabul, and were attached to schools, government offices, or factories. Based on the Soviet model, these Early Childhood Development programs provided nursery care, preschool, and kindergarten for children from 3 months to 6 years of age under the direction of the Department of Labor and Social Welfare.

The vast majority of Afghan families were never exposed to this system, and many of these families were in opposition to these programs due to the belief that it diminishes the central role of the family and inculcates children with Soviet values. With the onset of civil war after the Soviet withdrawal, the number of kindergartens dropped rapidly. By 1995, only 88 functioning facilities serving 2,110 children survived, and the Taliban restrictions on female employment eliminated all of the remaining centers in areas under their control. In 2007, there were about 260 kindergarten/pre-school centers serving over 25,000 children. Though every government center is required to have an early childhood center,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} at present, no governmental policies deal with early childhood and no institutions have either the responsibility or the capacity to provide such services.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Australia===
{{See also|Education in Australia}}
In each state of Australia, ''kindergarten'' (frequently referred to as "kinder" or "kindy") means something slightly different. In [[Tasmania]], New South Wales and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], it is the first year of primary school. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], kindergarten is a form of [[preschool]] and may be referred to interchangeably as preschool or kindergarten. In Victoria and Tasmania, the phrase for the first year of primary school is called ''Prep'' (short for "preparatory"), which is followed by grade 1. 

In Queensland, kindergarten is usually an institution for children around the age of 4 and thus it is the precursor to preschool and primary education. In recent years though, Kindergartens have been taking children as young as 6 months old. 

The year preceding the first year of primary school education in Western Australia, South Australia or the [[Northern Territory]] is referred to respectively as ''pre-primary'', ''reception'' or ''transition''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.det.wa.edu.au/education/ece/enrolments.html#compare&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
{{see also|Education in Bangladesh}}
In [[Bangladesh]], the term "kindergarten", or "KG School" (Kindergarten School), is used to refer to the schooling children attend from 3 to 6 years of age. The names of the levels are nursery, ''shishu'' (children), etc. But the view of kindergarten education has changed much from previous years. Almost every rural area now has at least one Kindergarten School, with most being run in the [[Bengali language]]. They also follow the textbooks published by the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) with a light modification, adding some extra books in syllabus. The grades generally start from Nursery (sometimes "Play"), "KG" afterwards, and ends with the 5th grade. Separate from the National Education System, kindergarten is contributing greatly toward achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goal]] of universal primary education in Bangladesh.

===Bulgaria===
{{see also|Education in Bulgaria}}
In [[Bulgaria]], the term ''detska gradina'' (деτска градина) refers to the schooling children attend from 3 to 7 (in some cases 6) years of age. Since 2012, two years of pre-school education are compulsory. These two years of mandatory pre-school education may be attended either at kindergarten or in preparatory groups at primary schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eli-net.eu/fileadmin/ELINET/Redaktion/user_upload/Bulgarian_Short_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

[[File:Student teachers Kindergarten 1898.jpg|thumb|Student teachers training in a kindergarten class in 1898 in Toronto, Canada]]

Schools outside of Ontario and the Northwest Territories generally provide one year of kindergarten, except some private schools offer junior kindergarten for 4-year-olds (school before kindergarten is most commonly referred to as pre-school). After kindergarten, the child begins grade one. The province of [[Nova Scotia]] refers to Kindergarten as Grade Primary.

The province of Ontario and the Northwest Territories provide two years of kindergarten. Within the province of [[Quebec]], junior kindergarten is called ''prématernelle'' (which is not mandatory), is attended by 4-year-olds, and senior kindergarten is called ''maternelle'', which is also not mandatory by the age of 5, this class is integrated into primary schools. Within the French school system in the province of [[Ontario]], junior kindergarten is called ''maternelle'' and senior kindergarten is called ''jardin d'enfants'', which is a [[calque]] of the German word ''Kindergarten''.

===Chile===
{{see also|Education in Chile}}
In Chile, the term equivalent to Kindergarten is "''Educación parvularia''", sometimes also called "''Educación Preescolar''". It is the first level of the [[Education in Chile|Chilean educational system]]. It meets the needs of boys and girls integrally from their birth until their entry to the ''Educación Básica'' (Primary education), without being considered as compulsory. Generally, schools imparting this level, the JUNJI (National Council of Kindergarten Schools) and other private institutions have the following organization of groups or subcategories of levels:
*'''Low nursery:''' It addresses babies from 85 days to 1 year old.
*'''High nursery:''' It addresses children from 1 to 2 years old.
*'''Low Middle Level:''' It addresses children from 2 to 3 years old.
*'''High Middle Level:''' It addresses children from 3 to 4 years old.
*'''First level of transition:''' Often called "''Pre-kinder''", it addresses children from 4 to 5 years old.
*'''Second level of transition''': Usually called "''Kinder''", it addresses children from 5 to 6 years old. It is the last phase of this type of education, by finishing it, children go to "''Primero Básico''" ([[First grade]] of primary education).&lt;ref&gt;[http://600.mineduc.cl/docs/informacion/info_guia/guia_parv.pdf Chilean Ministry of Education – Help Guide, Educación Parvularia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707011709/http://600.mineduc.cl/docs/informacion/info_guia/guia_parv.pdf |date=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===

[[File:北京师范大学实验幼儿园 - Experimental Kindergarten of Beijing Normal University - 2010.11 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Chinese kindergarten, primary, and secondary schools are sometimes affiliated with tertiary institutions, e.g. Experimental Kindergarten of [[Beijing Normal University]], [[Beijing]], [[China]]]]
In China, pre-school education, before the child enters formal schooling at 6 years of age, is generally divided into a "nursery" or "preschool" stage and a "kindergarten" (幼儿园 (yòu'éryuán) stage. These can be two separate institutions, or a single combined one in different areas. Where there are two separate institutions, it is common for the kindergarten to consist of the two upper years, and the preschool to consist of one lower year. Common names for these three years are:
# Nursery (or "preschool" or "playgroup")  (小班/xiăo bān): 3- to 4-year-old children
# Lower Kindergarten (中班/zhōng bān): 4- to 5-year-old children
# Upper Kindergarten (大班/dà bān): 5- to 6-year-old children.

In some places, children at 5-6 years may in addition or instead attend "reception" or "preparatory" classes (学前班/xué qián bān) focusing on preparing children for formal schooling.

State (public) kindergartens only accept children older than 3 years, while private ones do not have such limitations.

===Denmark===
{{Main|Danish pre-school education}}

Kindergarten is a day-care service offered to children from age three until the child starts attending school. Kindergarten classes (grade 0) are voluntary and are offered by primary schools before a child enters 1st grade.

Two-thirds of established day-care institutions in [[Denmark]] are municipal day-care centres while the other third are privately owned and are run by associations of parents or businesses in agreement with local authorities. In terms of both finances and subject-matter, municipal and private institutions function according to the same principles.

Denmark is credited with pioneering (although not inventing) [[forest kindergarten]]s, in which children spend most of every day outside in a natural environment.

===Egypt===
{{see also|Education in Egypt}}

In Egypt, children may go to kindergartens for two years (KG1 and KG2) between the ages of four and six.

===France===
[[File:Trondes Salle d'asile.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The wording ''{{lang|fr|salle d'asile}}'' was the former name of current ''{{lang|fr|école maternelle}}'']]
{{see also|Education in France}}
In France, pre-school is known as ''{{lang|fr|école maternelle}}'' (French for "nursery school", literally "maternal school"). Free ''{{lang|fr|maternelle}}'' schools are available throughout the country, welcoming children aged from 3 to 6 (although in many places, children under three may not be granted a place). The ages are divided into ''{{lang|fr|grande section}}'' (GS: 5-year-olds), ''{{lang|fr|moyenne section}}'' (MS: 4-year-olds), ''{{lang|fr|petite section}}'' (PS: 3-year-olds) and ''{{lang|fr|toute petite section}}'' (TPS: 2-year-olds). It is not compulsory, yet almost all children aged 3 to 5 attend. It is regulated by the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of National Education]].

In Germany, a ''{{lang|de|Kindergarten}}'' (masculine: ''der'' Kindergarten, plural ''{{lang|de|Kindergärten}}'') is a facility for the care of pre-school children who are typically at least three years old. By contrast, ''{{lang|de|Kinderkrippe}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Krippe}}'' refers to a crèche for the care of children before they enter ''{{lang|de|Kindergarten}}'' (9 weeks to about three years), ''{{lang|de|Kindertagesstätte}}''—literally "children's day site", usually shortened to ''{{lang|de|Kita}}''—is an [[umbrella term]] for any day care facility for pre-schoolers.

Attendance is voluntary, and usually not free of charge. Pre-school children over the age of one are entitled to receive local and affordable daycare.&lt;ref name="SGBVIII24"&gt;Achtes Buch Sozialgesetzbuch, §24;  children under the age of one are entitled to daycare if the caretaker is working, seeking work or attending school (section one); children from one to three years (section two) and from over three until they enter school (section three) are unconditionally entitled to receive day care.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the federal system, {{lang|de|Kindergärten}} fall under the responsibility of the [[States of Germany|states]],&lt;ref name="GG30"&gt;Grundgesetz Artikel 30, "Kulturhoheit der Länder"&lt;/ref&gt; which usually delegate a large share of the responsibility to the municipalities. Due to the [[subsidiarity principle]] stipulated by §4 [[:de:Achtes Buch Sozialgesetzbuch|SGB VIII]], there are a multitude of operators, from municipalities, churches and welfare societies to parents' initiatives and profit-based corporations. Many {{lang|de|Kindergärten}} follow a certain educational approach, such as [[Montessori]], [[Reggio Emilia approach|Reggio Emilia]], "{{lang|de|Berliner Bildungsprogramm}}" or [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]]; [[forest kindergarten]]s are well established. Most ''{{lang|de|Kindergärten}}'' are subsidised by the community councils, with the fees depending on the income of the parents.

Even in smaller townships, there are often both [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Lutheran]] kindergartens available. Places in crèches and kindergarten are often difficult to secure and must be 'reserved' in advance, although the situation has improved with a new law in effect August 2013. The availability of childcare, however, varies greatly by region. It is usually better in eastern regions, and in big cities in the north, such as Berlin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesslocationcenter.de/en/welcome-to-berlin/family-friendly-city/daycare|title=Child care in Berlin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Hamburg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbez.org/news/germanys-child-care-law-aims-get-more-moms-back-work-111198|title=Germany’s child care law aims to get more moms back to work  - WBEZ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and poorest in parts of [[Southern Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/law-goes-into-effect-requiring-child-care-for-most-german-children-a-914320.html|title=Law Goes into Effect Requiring Child Care for Most German Children|author=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany|date=August 1, 2013|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All caretakers in ''{{lang|de|Kita}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Kindergarten}}'' must have a three-year qualified education, or are under special supervision during training.

''{{lang|de|Kindergärten}}'' can be open from 7am to 5pm or longer and may also house a crèche (''{{lang|de|Kinderkrippe}}'') for children between the ages of eight weeks and three years, and possibly an afternoon ''{{lang|de|Hort}}'' (often associated with a primary school) for school-age children aged 6 to 10 who spend the time after their lessons there. Alongside nurseries, there are day-care nurses (''{{lang|de|Tagesmütter}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Tagespflegepersonen}}'') working independently of any pre-school institution in individual homes and looking after only three to five children, typically up to the age of three. These nurses are supported and supervised by local authorities.

The term ''{{lang|de|Vorschule}}'' ("pre-school") is used both for educational efforts in ''{{lang|de|Kindergärten}}'' and for a mandatory class that is usually connected to a primary school. Both systems are handled differently in each [[States of Germany|German state]]. The ''{{lang|de|Schulkindergarten}}'' is a type of ''{{lang|de|Vorschule}}''.

===Hong Kong===
{{see also|Education in Hong Kong}}
Pre-primary Services in [[Hong Kong]] refers to provision of education and care to young children by kindergartens and child care centres. Kindergartens, registered with the Education Bureau, provide services for children from three to six years old. Child care centres, on the other hand, are registered with the Social Welfare Department and include nurseries, catering for children aged two to three, and creches, looking after infants from birth to two.

At present, most of the kindergartens operate on half-day basis offering upper, lower kindergarten classes and nursery classes. Some kindergartens operate full-day kindergarten classes too. Child care centres also provide full-day and half-day services with most centres providing full-day services.

The aim of pre-primary education in Hong Kong is to provide children with a relaxing and pleasurable learning environment to promote a balanced development of different aspects necessary to a child's development such as the physical, intellectual, language, social, emotional and aesthetic aspects.

To help establish the culture of self-evaluation in kindergartens and to provide reference for the public in assessing the quality and standard of pre-primary education, the Education Bureau has developed Performance Indicators for pre-primary institutions in Hong Kong. Commencing in the 2000/01 school year, Quality Assurance Inspection was launched to further promote the development of quality Early Childhood Education.

===Hungary===
{{see also|Education in Hungary}}
[[File:OVODA.jpg|thumb|A [[Hungary|Hungarian]] pre-school class having outdoor activities, March 2007]]
In [[Hungary]] a kindergarten is called an ''{{lang|hu|óvoda}}'' ("place for caring"). Children attend kindergarten between ages 3–6/7 (they go to school in the year in which they have their 7th birthday). Attendance in kindergarten is compulsory from the age of 3 years, though exceptions are made for developmental reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caboodle.hu/nc/news/news_archive/single_page/?tx_ttnews&amp;#91;tt_news&amp;#93;=9571 Hungary lowers mandatory school age to three] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222936/http://www.caboodle.hu/nc/news/news_archive/single_page/?tx_ttnews&amp; |date=December 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though kindergartens may include programs in subjects such as foreign languages and music, children spend most of their time playing. In their last year, children begin to be prepared to attend elementary school.

Most kindergartens are state-funded. Kindergarten teachers are required to have a diploma.

===India===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Baroda High School, Alkapuri]] --&gt;
{{see also|Education in India}}
In [[India]], there are only informal directives pertaining to pre-primary education, for which pre-primary schools and sections need no affiliation. Directives state that children who are three years old on 30 May in the given academic year are eligible to attend Nursery and Kindergarten classes. Typically, children spend 3 to 4 years of their time in pre-primary school after which they are eligible to attend 1st Standard in Primary School which falls under HRD ministry norms. Primary education is now compulsory in India, and accompanied with mid-day meals, in most parts of the country run by the government. Pre-primary is not mandatory, however preferred. All government schools and affiliated private schools allow children who are 5 years of age as of 30 May to enroll to standard 1 of a primary school.

===Italy===

[[File:Nursery school classroom.jpg|thumb|Typical classroom layout in an [[:it:Asilo nido|Italian nursery school]]. From left to right: restroom, bathroom, playroom, and outdoor playground.]]

In [[Italy]], pre-school education refers to two different grades:
* Nursery schools, called ''{{lang|it|[[:it:Asilo nido|asili-nido]]}}'' for children between 3 and 36 months;
* [[:it:Scuola dell'infanzia|Maternal schools]] formerly ''{{lang|it|scuola materna}}'' and now ''{{lang|it|scuola dell'infanzia}}'', for children 3 to 5 years old.

Italian ''{{lang|it|asili-nido}}'' were officially instituted in a 1971 State Law (L. 1044/1971), and may be ruled by either private or public institutions. They were originally established to allow mothers a chance to work out of their homes, and were therefore seen as a social service. Today, they mostly serve the purpose of general education and social interaction. In Italy, much effort has been spent on developing a pedagogical approach to children's care: well known is the so-called [[Reggio Emilia approach]], named after the city of Reggio Emilia, in [[Emilia-Romagna]].

''{{lang|it|Asili-nido}}'' normally occupy small one-story buildings, surrounded by gardens; usually suitable for no more than 60 or 70 children. The heart of the ''{{lang|it|asili-nido}}'' are the classrooms, split into playroom and restroom; the playroom always has windows and doors leading to the outside playground and garden.

Maternal schools (''{{lang|it|scuola materna}}'') were established in 1968 after State Law n. 444 and are a full part of the official Italian education system, though attendance is not compulsory. Like ''{{lang|it|asili-nido}}'' (nursery schools), maternal schools may be held either by public or private institutions.

Early childhood education begins at home, and there are numerous books and television shows aimed at helping mothers &amp; fathers of preschool children to educate their children and to parent more effectively. Much of the home training is devoted to teaching manners, proper social behavior, and structured play, although verbal and number skills are also popular themes. Parents are strongly committed to early education and frequently enroll their children in preschools.
Kindergartens (幼稚園 yōchien), predominantly staffed by young female junior college graduates, are supervised by the Ministry of Education but are not part of the official education system. The 58% of kindergartens that are private accounted for 77% of all children enrolled. In addition to kindergartens, there exists a well-developed system of government-supervised day-care centers (保育園 hoikuen), supervised by the Ministry of Labor. Whereas kindergartens follow educational aims, preschools are predominantly concerned with providing care for infants and toddlers. Just as there are public and private kindergartens, there are both public and privately run preschools. Together, these two kinds of institutions enroll well over 90 percent of all preschool-age children prior to their entrance into the formal system at [[first grade]]. The Ministry of Education's 1990 Course of Study for Preschools, which applies to both kinds of institutions, covers such areas as human relationships, health, environment, language, and expression. Starting from March 2008 the new revision of curriculum guidelines for kindergartens as well as for preschools came into effect.

===South Korea===
{{see also|Education in South Korea}}
In [[South Korea]], children normally attend kindergarten ({{lang-ko|유치원}} ''yuchi won'') between the ages of three or four and six or seven in the Western age system. (Korean ages are calculated differently from Western ages: when they are born they are considered one-year-olds, rather than one day old. Additionally, every January 1, everyone's age increases by one year regardless of when their birthday is. Hence in Korea, kindergarten children are called five-, six- and seven-year-olds.) The school year begins in March. It is followed by primary school. Normally the kindergartens are graded on a three-tier basis.

Korean kindergartens are private schools, and monthly costs vary. Korean parents often send their children to English kindergartens to give them a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] in English. Such specialized kindergartens can be mostly taught in Korean with some English lessons, mostly taught in English with some Korean lessons, or completely taught in English. Almost all middle-class parents send their children to kindergarten.

Kindergarten programs in South Korea attempt to incorporate much academic instruction alongside more playful activities. Korean kindergartners learn to read, write (often in English as well as Korean) and do simple arithmetic. Classes are conducted in a traditional classroom setting, with the children focused on the teacher and one lesson or activity at a time. The goal of the teacher is to overcome weak points in each child's knowledge or skills.

Because the education system in Korea is very competitive, kindergartens are becoming more intensely academic. Children are pushed to read and write at a very young age. They also become accustomed to regular and considerable amounts of [[homework]]. These very young children may also attend other specialized afternoon schools, taking lessons in art, piano or violin, [[taekwondo]], ballet, soccer or mathematics.

===Kosovo===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
In [[Kosovo]], kindergarten is known as ''Çerdhe'' or ''Kopshti i fëmijëve'', and they serve as Day Care Centers. There are public and private kindergartens, and they are for children under the age of 3. Children between 3–6 years old go to ''Institucione parashkollore'', which are different from the Day Care Centers, because here children start the basic learning process, and they serve as preparatory institutions for the Primary School. After the age of 6, children continue in Primary School. However, neither the Day Care Centers nor the Preparatory Institutions are mandatory.

===Kuwait===
{{see also|Education in Kuwait}}
In [[Kuwait]], Kuwaiti children may go to free government kindergartens for two years (KG1 and KG2) between the ages of four and six.

===Luxembourg===

In Luxembourg, a Kindergarten is called ''Spillschoul'' (literally "Playschool", plural ''Spillschoulen''). It is a public education facility which is attended by children between the age of 4 (or 5) and 6 when they advance to the ''Grondschoul'' (elementary school).

===Macedonia===
{{see also|Education in Macedonia}}
The [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] equivalent of kindergarten is ''detska gradinka'' ({{lang|mk|детска градинка}}), sometimes called ''zabavishte'' ({{lang|mk|забавиште}}) when the kids are younger than 4 years. ''Detska gradinka'' is not part of the state's mandatory education, because the educational process in the country begins at the age of 5 or 6, i.e. first grade.

===Malaysia===
{{see also|Education in Malaysia}}
In [[Malaysia]], kindergarten is known as ''{{lang|zsm|tadika}}''. Most kindergartens are available to children of ages five and six (and some are available to children as young as four). For children up to the age of three (or four), there are [[pre-school playgroup]]s. There are no fixed rules for when a child needs to go to a kindergarten, but the majority will when the child turns 5 years old. The child will usually attend kindergarten for two years, before proceeding to [[primary school]] at age 7.&lt;ref name="Malaysia"&gt;[[Education in Malaysia#School grades|Education in Malaysia - School grades]], view Malaysian school grades here.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
{{see also|Education in Mexico}}
In [[Mexico]], kindergarten is called ''kínder'', with the last year sometimes referred to as ''preprimaria'' (''primaria'' is the name given to grades 1 through 6, so the name literally means "prior to elementary school"). The kindergarten system in Mexico was developed by professor [[Rosaura Zapata]], who received the country's highest honor for her contribution. It consists of three years of pre-school education, which are mandatory before elementary school. Previous nursery is optional and may be offered in either private schools or [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]].

At private schools, kinders usually consist of three grades, and a fourth one may be added for nursery. The fourth one is called maternal. It goes before the other three years and is not obligatory. While the [[first grade]] is a [[pre-school playgroup|playgroup]], the other two are of classroom education.

In 2002, the [[Congress of Mexico|Congress of the Union]] approved the ''Law of Obligatory Pre-schooling'', which made pre-school education for three to six-year-olds obligatory, and placed it under the auspices of the federal and state ministries of education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senado.gob.mx/internacionales/assets/docs/relaciones_parlamentarias/america/foros/parla_latino/salud5.pdf Senado.gob.mx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012114537/http://www.senado.gob.mx/internacionales/assets/docs/relaciones_parlamentarias/america/foros/parla_latino/salud5.pdf |date=October 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/16/20/37423645.pdf OECD.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mongolia===
{{see also|Education in Mongolia}}
In [[Mongolia]], kindergarten is known as "цэцэрлэг" or ''tsetserleg''. As of September 2013, there are approximately 152 kindergartens registered in the country. From those 152 kindergartens, 142 are state owned. Children begin kindergarten at the age of 2 and finish it by 5. The education system before kindergarten in Mongolia is called "ясль", which accepts children between 0 and 2 years of age.

===Morocco===
{{see also|Education in Morocco}}
In [[Morocco]], pre-school is known as ''école maternelle'', ''kuttab'', or ''ar-rawd''. State-run, free ''maternelle'' schools are available throughout the kingdom, welcoming children aged from 2 to 5 (although in many places, children under 3 may not be granted a place). It is not compulsory, yet almost 80% of children aged 3 to 5 attend. It is regulated by the Moroccan department of education.

===Nepal===
{{see also|Education in Nepal}}
In [[Nepal]], kindergartens are run as private institutions, with their lessons conducted in English. The kindergarten education in Nepal is most similar to that of Hong Kong and India. Children start attending kindergarten from the age of 2 until they are at least 5 years old.

The kindergartens in Nepal have the following grades:
#Nursery/playgroup: 2- to 3-year-olds
#Lower Kindergarten: 3- to 4-year-olds
#Upper Kindergarten: 4- to 5-year-olds

===Netherlands===
{{see also|Education in Netherlands}}
In the [[Netherlands]], the equivalent term to kindergarten was ''{{lang|nl|kleuterschool}}''. From the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century the term ''{{lang|nl|Fröbelschool}}'' was also common, after [[Friedrich Fröbel]]. However, this term gradually faded in use as the verb ''{{lang|nl|Fröbelen}}'' gained a slightly derogatory meaning in everyday language. Until 1985, it used to be a separate non-compulsory form of education (for children aged 4–6 years), after which children (aged 6–12 years) attended the primary school (''lagere school''). After 1985, both forms were integrated into one, called ''{{lang|nl|basisonderwijs}}'' (Dutch for primary education). For children under 4, the country offers private, subsidized daycares (''{{lang|nl|kinderdagverblijf}}''), which are noncompulsory but nevertheless very popular.

=== New Zealand ===
{{See also|Education in New Zealand}}
In New Zealand, kindergarten can refer to education in the 2 years preceding primary school, from age 3 to 4. Primary Education starts at age 5. 

===Norway===
{{see also|Education in Norway}}
In [[Norway]], ''barnehage'' (children garden) is the term equivalent to kindergarten, used for children in the ages between 10 months and 6 years. The first ''barnehager'' were founded in Norway in the late 19th century. Although they have existed for 120 years, they are not considered part of the education system. They are both publicly and privately owned and operated. The staff, at minimum the manager, should be educated as ''barnehagelærer'' (kindergarten teacher), previously known as ''førskolelærer'' (pre-school teachers). The children spend most of the time outdoors. There is also an institution called ''barnepark'' (children's park), which does not need to have certified staff.

===Peru===
{{see also|Education in Peru}}
In [[Peru]], the term ''nido'' refers to the schooling children attend from 3 to 6 years of age. It is followed by primary school classes, which last for six years. Some families choose to send their children to primary school at the age of 6. In 1902 the teacher Elvira Garcia and Garcia co-founder of the Society cited above, organized the first kindergarten for children 2 to 8 years old, Fanning annex to the Lyceum for ladies. Her studies and concern for children led her to spread through conferences and numerous documents, the importance of protecting children early and to respond to the formation of a personality based on justice and understanding, as well as the use of methods Fröbel and from Montessori and participation of parents in this educational task.

===Philippines===
{{see also|Education in the Philippines}}
In the [[Philippines]], education officially starts at the Elementary level and placing children into early childhood education through kindergarten is optional to parents. Early childhood education in the Philippines is classified into:
* '''Center-based programs''', such as the [[Barangay]] daycare service, public and private pre-schools, kindergarten or school-based programs, community or church-based early childhood education programs initiated by nongovernment organizations or people's organizations, workplace-related child care and education programs, child-minding centers, health centers and stations; and
* '''Home-based programs''', such as the neighborhood-based playgroups, family day care programs, parent education and home visiting programs.

Early childhood education was strengthened through the creation of the Early Childhood Care and Development Act of 2000 (Republic Act No. 8980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2000/ra_8980_2000.html|title=R.A. 8980|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Department of Education disseminated copies of the Kindergarten Education Act through Republic Act No. 10157 making it compulsory and mandatory in the entire nation. As a provision in this law, children under five years old are required to enroll in a kindergarten in any public elementary school in the country. This goes with the implementation of the K-12 system in the Basic Education Curriculum.

===Romania===
[[File:Ca_20140313_(13128220205).jpg|thumb|Kindergarten children in 1942 in [[Slobozia]], Romania]]
{{see also|Education in Romania}}
In [[Romania]], ''{{lang|ro|grădiniţă}}'', which means "little garden", is the favored form of education for preschool children usually aged 3–6. The children are divided in three groups: "little group" (''{{lang|ro|grupa mică}}'', age 3–4), "medium group" (''{{lang|ro|grupa mijlocie}}'', age 4-5) and "big group" (''{{lang|ro|grupa mare}}'', age 5-6). In the last few years, private kindergartens have become popular, supplementing the state preschool education system. Kindergarten is optional. The "preparatory school year" (''clasa pregătitoare'') is for children aged 6–7, and since it became compulsory in 2012,&lt;ref name="Mediafax"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediafax.ro/social/clasa-pregatitoare-obligatorie-din-septembrie-ce-vor-invata-copiii-si-cum-vor-fi-evaluati-9167096 |title=Clasa pregătitoare, obligatorie din septembrie.

[[File:Detsad Leningrad 1930s.jpg|thumb|Detsad 1920s|Children of a kindergarten on a walk, Leningrad, Russia, 1930s]]
In the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], {{lang|ru|Детский сад}} (''dyetskiy sad'', literal translation of "children's garden") is a preschool educational institution for children, usually 3 to 6 years of age.

===South Africa===
{{see also|Education in South Africa}}
Kindergartens (commonly known as creche) in [[South Africa]] provide from 0-6 years of age spent of preschool programs for children of all ages up to six. The one to three-year program, known as ''nursery'', ''kindergarten 1'' (K1), and ''kindergarten 2'' (K2), prepares children for their first year in primary school education. Some kindergartens further divide nursery into N1 and N2.

===Spain===
In Spain, kindergarten is called ''{{lang|es|infantil}}'', ''{{lang|es|ciclo infantil}}'' or ''{{lang|es|guardería}}'', and serves children from 3 to 6 years of age. It's commonly known by some people as ''{{lang|es|parvulitos}}''.

1º ciclo de Educación Infantil (from 0 to 3 years of age)
2º ciclo de Educación Infantil (from 3 to 6 years of age).

===Sudan===

Kindergarten in Sudan is divided into private and public kindergarten. Preschool is compulsory in Sudan. The proper kindergarten age spans from 3–6 years. The curriculum covers Arabic, English, religion, mathematics and more.

===Sweden===
{{see also|Education in Sweden}}
In [[Sweden]], kindergarten activities were established in the 19th century, and have been widely expanded since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="LeesLees2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Lees|author2=Lynn Hollen Lees|title=Cities and the Making of Modern Europe, 1750-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1V8-EdwtO8C&amp;pg=PA177|date=December 13, 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83936-5|pages=177–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="froebelweb.org"/&gt; The first Swedish kindergarten teachers were trained by [[Henriette Schrader-Breymann]] at the [[Pestalozzi-Fröbel Haus]], which she founded in 1882.&lt;ref name="LeesLees2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="froebelweb.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.froebelweb.org/images/niece.html|title=Henriette Schrader-Breymann|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
{{see also|Education in Taiwan}}
While many public kindergartens and preschools exist in [[Taiwan]], private kindergartens and preschools are also quite popular. Many private preschools offer accelerated courses in various subjects to compete with public preschools and capitalize on public demand for academic achievement. Curriculum at such preschools often encompasses subject material such as science, art, physical education and even mathematics classes. The majority of these schools are part of large school chains, which operate under franchise arrangements. In return for annual fees, the chain enterprises may supply advertising, curriculum, books, materials, training, and even staff for each individual school.

There has been a huge growth in the number of privately owned and operated English immersion preschools in Taiwan since 1999. These English immersion preschools generally employ native English speaking teachers to teach the whole preschool curriculum in an "English only" environment. The legality of these types of schools has been called into question on many occasions, yet they continue to prosper. Some members of Taiwanese society have raised concerns as to whether local children should be placed in English immersion environments at such a young age, and have raised fears that the students abilities in their mother language may suffer as a result. The debate continues, but at the present time, the market for English Immersion Preschools continues to grow.

===Ukraine===

In 2010, a total of 56% of children aged one to six years old had the opportunity to attend [[preschool education]], the Education and Science Ministry of Ukraine reported in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/78029/ Education Ministry: Some 44 percent of children unable to attend kindergarten], [[Kyiv Post]] (August 11, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Many preschools and kindergartens were closed previously in light of [[Economy of Ukraine|economic]] and [[Demographics of Ukraine|demographic]] considerations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Avq58dqJwMkC&amp;pg=PA1226&amp;dq=kindergarten+Ukraine&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=7PFuTOHXFYGRjAem-pD8CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGYQ6AEwCTge#v=onepage&amp;q=kindergarten%20Ukraine&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of Motherhood] by [[Andrea O'Reilly]], [[Sage Publications, Inc]], 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-4129-6846-1}} (page 1226)&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{see also|Education in the United Kingdom}}
&lt;!-- The opening paragraph covers both nursery and reception/first year(s) of primary education, because "kindergarten" is used in either sense in other English-speaking countries. --&gt;
The term kindergarten is rarely used in the UK to describe modern pre-school education or the first year(s) of compulsory primary school education. Pre-schools are usually known as creche, nursery schools or [[pre-school playgroup|playgroups]], while the first year of compulsory schooling is known as [[Reception (school)|Reception]] in England, ''Dosbarth Derbyn'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ("reception class") and Primary One in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Nursery forms part of the [[Foundation Stage]] of education. In the 1980s, England and [[Wales]] officially adopted the [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] system whereby children start school either in the term or year in which they will become five depending on the policy of the [[local education authority]]. In Scotland, schooling becomes compulsory between the ages of 4½ and 5½ years, depending on their birthday (school starts in August for children who were 4 by the end of the preceding February).

However, the word "kindergarten" is used for more specialist organisations such as [[forest kindergarten]]s and is sometimes used in the naming of private nurseries that provide full-day child care for working parents. Historically the word was used during the nineteenth century when activists like [[Adelaide Manning]] were introducing educators to the work of [[Friedrich Fröbel]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Sutherland, ‘Manning, (Elizabeth) Adelaide (1828–1905)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2007 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48424, accessed 26 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, parents have the option of nursery for their children at the ages of three or four years, before compulsory education begins. Before that, less structured childcare is available privately. The details vary between England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

Some nurseries are attached to state [[infant school|infant]] or primary schools, but many are provided by the private sector. The Scottish government provides funding&lt;ref name="scottish-state-funding"&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Young-People/Early-Education-Child-Care/17970/11874 Childcare regulations] of the Scottish Government&lt;/ref&gt; so that all children from the age of three until they start compulsory school can attend five sessions per week of two and a half hours each, either in state-run or private nurseries. Working parents can also receive from their employers childcare worth £55 per week free of income tax,&lt;ref name="taxfreevouchers"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/childcare/ Tax Free Childcare Regulations], UK government HMRC&lt;/ref&gt; which is typically enough to pay for one or two days per week.

The Scottish Government defines its requirements for nursery schools in the Early Years Framework&lt;ref name="earlyyears"&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/257007/0076309.pdf Early Years Framework], Scottish Government, January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and the Curriculum for Excellence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/curriculumforexcellence/index.asp Ltscotland.org.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801110701/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/curriculumforexcellence/index.asp |date=August 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each school interprets these with more or less independence (depending on their [[Educational management|management]] structure) but must satisfy the Care Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carecommission.com|title=Care Commission|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322080915/http://www.carecommission.com/|archivedate=March 22, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to retain their licence to operate. The curriculum aims to develop:
* confident individuals
* effective contributors
* responsible citizens

===United States===
{{see also|Education in the United States}}
[[File:1921 Locust yearbook p. 100 (Kindergarten).jpg|thumb|1921 kindergarten class at the [[East Texas State Normal College]] Training School]]
In the US, kindergarten is usually part of the [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] educational system. In most state and private schools, children begin kindergarten at age 5 and attend for one year. They do activities such as [[addition]] (+), [[subtraction]] (-), and playing outside on the [[playground]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecs.org/clearinghouse/86/62/8662.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-three states require their school districts to offer a kindergarten year.&lt;ref name="nces53"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kindergarten requirements, by state: 2010 |url=http://nces.ed.gov/programs/statereform/tab5_3.asp|work=Table 5.3|publisher=[[National Center for Education Statistics]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|date=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a typical US kindergarten [[classroom]], resources like [[toy]]s, [[picture book]]s, and [[crayon]]s are available for children's use. The daily schedule varies from town to town, but there are some similarities.  In the [[morning]], the children usually do [[circle time]]. This includes saying the [[pledge of allegiance]], looking at the [[calendar]], and discussing the [[weather]] and [[season]] that day. Next, the children work on different subjects:

In [[math]], kindergartners usually do single digit [[addition]] and [[subtraction]], learn to count with "more or less" games, become acquainted with a [[clock]], and learn [[skip counting]] to prepare them for one digit [[multiplication]]. 

In [[language arts]] (English), children learn [[sight word]]s, (cat, fun), [[rhyming]], blends, and silent e. They then learn how to write, form sentences, and are required to write three complete sentences by the end of the year.

In [[social studies]], kindergartners learn about the [[month]]s, [[U.S. state]]s, the [[continent]]s, and sometimes about people performing community functions (e.g. [[Physician|doctor]], [[barber]], [[teacher]]) and places (e.g."You go to a [[hospital]] when you're sick or to have [[surgery]]." "You go to a [[park]] to [[play (activity)|play]].")

After a few lessons, there is a break for [[lunch]]. Children either fetch their own [[Lunch box|lunchboxes]] brought from home or get a lunch from the [[cafeteria]] and eat it (or take) there or in the classroom. Sometimes after lunch the children have [[recess (break)|recess]], some students' favorite part of the day, when they can go outside to [[Play (activity)|play]] on [[swing (seat)|swings]], [[playground slide|slides]],  play [[ basketball]], or socialize. After recess kindergartners go back inside to do more learning. Some schools let children take a nap or do free choice (blocks, [[tic tac toe]], [[play doh]], etc.)
When kindergarten is over for the day, parents or guardians come to pick up their child or the children ride a bus home.

This book in polar studies and polar exploration literature was described by the Women's Review of Books as, "...part of a long overdue effort to rewrite the old sexist and racist histories of exploration".&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne Kay, “Ice Follies,” Women’s Review of Books 11 (7), 1994, 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Publishers Weekly]] described it as “making a good case for her intriguing central thesis“.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8166-2091-3|title = Nonfiction Book Review: Gender on Ice by Lisa Bloom|website = PublishersWeekly.com|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12103">There have been many notable instances of unruly behaviour at [[classical music]] concerts, often at the premiere of a new work or production:

* 1802 (December 18, London): [[William Reeve]], ''[[Family Quarrels]]''. Part of the Jewish audience catcalled because of perceived anti-Jewish slights.&lt;ref&gt;Chancellor, Valerie E. (2002). "Anti-Racialism or Censorship? The 1802 Jewish Riots at Covent Garden Opera". Opera Quarterly 18 (1): 18–25.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1830 (August 25, Brussels): [[Daniel Auber]], ''[[La muette de Portici]]''. Audience members at a performance in Brussels left before the end of the opera to join pre-planned riots that were already taking place across the city, marking the beginning of the [[Belgian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Slatin, Sonia. "Opera and Revolution: La Muette de Portici and the Belgian Revolution of 1830 Revisited", ''Journal of Musicological Research'' 3 (1979), 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1838 (September 10, Paris): [[Hector Berlioz]], ''[[Benvenuto Cellini (opera)|Benvenuto Cellini]]''. The audience hissed at most of the music after the first few numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hberlioz.com/Special/cwasselin_1e.htm Wasselin, Christian, "Benvenuto Cellini" on the Hector Berlioz website] for a more detailed inside story of the opera&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1868 (March 5, Milan): [[Arrigo Boito]], ''[[Mefistofele]]''. The audience came predisposed to drown out Boito's claquers and succeeded in making the music inaudible with their hisses and boos.&lt;ref&gt;Halperson, Maurice. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gk80AQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=boito%20mefistofele%20fiasco&amp;pg=RA16-PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Romance of Music], 56", ''[[Musical America]]'', September 8, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaisen, Jay.

* 1913 (March 9, Rome): [[Francesco Balilla Pratella]], ''Musica Futurista''. At the second performance of the work, the audience booed, threw garbage at the orchestra, and some fighting occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Payton, Rodney J. "The Music of Futurism: Concerts and Polemics", ''[[The Musical Quarterly]]'', (1976) LXII (1): 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-M_jhnOuboC&amp;pg=PA415&amp;lpg=PA415&amp;dq=russolo+riot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MeVcjrZCmP&amp;sig=ku3et2V05tdekW4YHGDjzhrV7us&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jySCS-KFDo76nAemqJGXBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=russolo%20riot&amp;f=false |title=Music of the Twentieth-century Avant-garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1913 (March 31, Vienna): [[Alban Berg]], ''[[Altenberg Lieder]]''. As part of a front in Vienna's ongoing style wars, the audience booed and catcalled loudly, and some punches were thrown. The event came to be known as the [[Skandalkonzert]].&lt;ref name="Barker"&gt;Barker, Andrew (1997).

* 1913 (May 29, Paris): [[Igor Stravinsky]], ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''. Dueling factions tried to drown each other out during the ballet's premiere, unwittingly launching generations of exaggerations of what actually happened in the hall that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bullard |first=Truman |title=The first performance of Igor Stravinsky's Sacre du printemps |publisher=Ann Arbor University (microfilm copy) |location= Ann Arbor, Michigan |year=1971|oclc= 937514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pieter C. van den Toorn, "Stravinsky and The Rite of Spring", [http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=ft967nb647&amp;chunk.id=d0e414 Chapter 1: Point of Order]&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1914 (April 21, Milan): [[Luigi Russolo]], three works for [[intonarumori]] (''The Awakening of a City'', ''The Meeting of Automobiles and Aeroplanes'' and ''Dining on the Hotel Terrace''). A concert organized by the [[Futurism|Futurists]] to provide the first public demonstration of their experimental "noise-making" instruments called intonarumori resulted in an expected fracas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nice|first1=James|title=Music Futurista: The Art of Noises|url=http://www.ltmrecordings.com/musica_futurista_the_art_of_noises_ltmcd2401.html|website=www.ltmrecordings.com|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Futurists led by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] fighting members of the audience in the stalls.&lt;ref name="Sitsky2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorn|first=Benjamin|editor=Larry Sitsky|title=Music of the Twentieth-century Avant-garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-M_jhnOuboC&amp;pg=PA415|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29689-5|page=415|chapter=Luigi Russolo (1885-1947)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1917 (May 18, Paris): [[Erik Satie]], ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]''. One faction of the audience booed, hissed, and was generally unruly, but they were eventually silenced by an enthusiastic ovation.&lt;ref&gt;Peterkin, Norman. "Erik Satie's 'Parade'", ''[[The Musical Times]]'', Vol. 60, No. 918 (Aug. 1, 1919), 426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/0003_satie/satie.shtml |title=Springtime in Paris: Erik Satie |publisher=Music.minnesota.publicradio.org |date=2000-03-01 |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1923 (March 4, New York): [[Edgard Varèse]], ''[[Hyperprism (Varèse)|Hyperprism]]''. The audience laughed throughout and hissed at the conclusion, which prompted Varèse to repeat the work in hopes of a more serious response.&lt;ref&gt;"Taxi Toots Sound Sweet After Music By Composers Guild: Many Hisses Greet Conclusion of 'Hyperprism'; Dissenters Told to Leave and Piece Is Played Over Again", ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', March 5, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1924 (June 15, Paris): [[Erik Satie]], ''[[Mercure (ballet)|Mercure]]''. The police were called to the premiere due to unruly behavior that sprung from the Parisian cultural infighting of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Orledge, "Erik Satie's Ballet Mercure" (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1926 (June 19, Paris): [[George Antheil]], ''[[Ballet Mécanique]]''. The premiere performance received a large ovation despite some unruly behavior in the audience, including an outburst by [[Ezra Pound]], but there were some fistfights in the street after the concert.&lt;ref&gt;Key, Susan, Larry Rothe, and Thomas M. Tilson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vu3O9-Yk8E4C&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;vq=antheil&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false American Mavericks]''. San Francisco, Calif: San Francisco Symphony, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1926 (November 27, Cologne): [[Béla Bartók]], ''[[The Miraculous Mandarin]]''. The plot caused a commotion in the audience, which began leaving during the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vinton|first=John|title=The Case of the Miraculous Mandarin|journal=[[The Musical Quarterly]]|date=January 1964|volume=L|issue=1|pages=13|doi=10.1093/mq/L.1.1|url=http://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/L/1/1.full.pdf+html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1954 (December 2, Paris): [[Edgard Varèse]], ''[[Déserts]]''. The audience loudly jeered the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Mattis, Olivia. "Varèse's Multimedia Conception of Déserts", The Musical Quarterly, Vol. 76, No. 4 (Winter, 1992), p. 557.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1961 (April 13, Venice): [[Luigi Nono]], ''[[Intolleranza 1960]]''. The opera's premiere was disrupted by shouts from a [[neo-fascist]] faction in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Boyden, Matthew, and Nick Kimberly.

* 1968 (December 9, Hamburg): [[Hans Werner Henze]], ''[[Das Floß der Medusa]]''. Students hung a [[Che Guevera]] banner, the [[Red flag (politics)|Red]], and [[Anarchist symbolism#Black flag|Black]] flags causing the chorus to protest, and the police to make arrests, which prompted Henze to cancel the concert.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Schnabel]], "Zum Untergang einer Uraufführung" and "Postscriptum nach dreiunddreissig Tagen", in Hans Werner Henze and Ernst Schnabel, ''Das Floss der Medusa: Text zum Oratorium'', 47–61 &amp; 65–79 (Munich: Piper-Verlag, 1969);&lt;br /&gt;[[Andrew Porter (music critic)|Andrew Porter]], "Henze: The Raft of the Frigate 'Medusa' – Oratorio" [record review of DGG 139428-9], ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' 47, no. 563 (April 1970): 1625;&lt;br /&gt;Anon.

* 1973 (January 18, New York): [[Steve Reich]], ''[[Four Organs]]''. At a [[Carnegie Hall]] performance of the work, the conservative audience tried yelling and sarcastically applauding to hasten the end of the piece, which received both boos and cheers during the ovation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold C.

In response to the pandemonium when different factions in the audience yelled each other down, Esfahani stopped his performance and started playing with the ensemble [[Concerto Köln]] a concerto by [[C.

The '''Bronze of [[Luzaga]]''' is a plate of 16 x 15 centimeters which has, in 8 lines, 123 [[Celtiberians|celtiberian]] characters engraved in the [[metal]] with a bradawl or similar, and which has 7 holes, perhaps in order to be held. Since its discovery in the late nineteenth century, it has been lost.

'''Macaroni art''', sometimes referred to as '''macaroni crafts''' or '''pasta art''', is artwork that is made of dry [[macaroni]] or [[List of pasta|other pasta]].&lt;ref name="parents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parents.com/fun/arts-crafts/kid/pasta-crafts/|title=Use Your Noodle: 6 Crafts to Make with Pasta|publisher=parents.com|accessdate=2014-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works commonly consist of individual pieces of macaroni glued to a surface to produce a [[mosaic]]. However, works may take the form of sculptures.

This type of art is produced during arts and crafts classes at pre-school.&lt;ref name="artistshelpingchildren"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artistshelpingchildren.org/pastacraftsideasactivitieskids.html|title=Pasta Crafts for Kids: Ideas for Arts and Crafts Activities with Spaghetti &amp; Macaroni Noodles for Toddlers, Children, and Preschoolers|publisher=artistshelpingchildren.org|accessdate=2014-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it has evolved to become an artform practiced by adults.{{Citation needed|reason=Questionable|date=November 2017}}

==In popular culture==
Pasta art was used to advertise a [[Nancy Sinatra]] concert at the world famous [[Fillmore West|Fillmore Auditorium]] in San Francisco. The art the poster was made from is composed entirely of ''Pasta e Fagioli'' (pasta and beans). Alphabet pasta spells out the lyrics for her hit "These Boots Are Made For Walking".&lt;ref name="nancy sinatra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicposters.com/Nancy_Sinatra/poster/New_Fillmore_Series/194|title=Nancy Sinatra at the Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA June 28, 1995|publisher=Classicposters.com|accessdate=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another example of pasta art was featured in an episode of the television sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]''. [[Cosmo Kramer]] produced a small sculpture made of [[fusilli]] called "Fusili Jerry".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2880">The '''Maharadia Lawana''' (sometimes spelled '''Maharadya Lawana''' or '''Maharaja Rāvaṇa''') is a [[Maranao people|Maranao]] epic which tells a local version of the Indian epic [[Ramayana]].&lt;ref name="Francisco1969"&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Francisco|first=Juan R.|date=|title=Maharadia Lawana|url=http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-07-02-1969/franciso-maharadia%20lawana.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its English translation is attributed to Filipino Indologist [[Juan R. Francisco]], assisted by Maranao scholar Nagasura Madale, based on Francisco's ethnographic research in the [[Lake Lanao]] area in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="Guillermo2011"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=GBWye7c8NuYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Maharadia%20Lawana&amp;f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of the Philippines |last=Guillermo |first=Artemio R. |date=2011-12-16 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810875111 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page="264"}}

It narrates the adventures of the monkey-king, Maharadia [[Ravana|Lawana]], whom the Gods have gifted with immortality.&lt;ref name="Guillermo2011"/&gt;

Francisco first heard the poem being sung by Maranao bards around Lake Lanao in 1968.  He then sought the help of Maranao scholar Nagasura Madale, resulting in a rhyming English translation of the epic.&lt;ref name="Guillermo2011"/&gt;

Francisco believed that the Ramayana narrative arrived in the Philippines some time between the 17th to 19th centuries, via interactions with Javanese and Malaysian cultures which traded extensively with India.&lt;ref name="Francisco1989"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=FRANCISCO|first=JUAN R.|date=1989|title=The Indigenization of the Rama Story in the Philippines|jstor=42633135|journal=Philippine Studies|volume=37|issue=1|pages=101–111|doi=10.2307/42633135}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=101}}

By the time it was documented in the 1960s, the character names, place names, and the precise episodes and events in Maharadia Lawana's narrative already had some notable differences from those of the Ramayana.  Francisco believed that this was a sign of "indigenization", and suggested that some changes had already been introduced in Malaysia and Java even before the story was heard by the Maranao, and that upon reaching the Maranao homeland, the story was "''further indigenized to suit Philippine cultural perspectives and orientations.''"&lt;ref name="Francisco1989"/&gt;{{rp|page="103"}}

'''Markiyan Kamysh''' ({{lang-uk|Маркіян Камиш}}, born 19 October 1988) is a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] novelist, who represents [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone|Chernobyl]].

==Biography==
Markiyan Kamysh is the only person representing the Chernobyl underground in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://markian.info/?p=2363|title=Interview for "Etnie". In English {{!}} Маркіян Камиш|last=|first=|date=|website=markian.info|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For seven years he has been illegally, like a stalker, investigating and writing about the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]]. He made more than 100 expeditions behind the barbed wire and lived in the Zone for more than a year, and has walked more than 10,000&amp;nbsp;km within the Zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/society/2016/04/160328_kamysh_chornobyl_hiker_ko|title="Чому я ходжу в Чорнобильську зону" - розповідь нелегала|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC Україна|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamysh's debut novel [http://markian.info/?page_id=1538 “A Stroll to the Zone”] about [[Stalker (1979 film)|illegal Chernobyl tourists (stalkers)]] has been called the most sensational debut of Ukrainian literature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://litakcent.com/2015/11/06/pislja-stalkera/|title=Після Сталкера|last=|first=|date=2016-07-11|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months after its publication in Ukraine and after a lot of positive reviews, it has been translated into French and published by [[Groupe Flammarion|Arthaud (Groupe Flammarion)]].

In France, the novel has been released under the title “La Zone” and been welcomed with great warmth by French critics. Cult French magazine [[Le Nouvel observateur|Le Nouvel Observateur]] has called it ''“Stunning book”''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/monde/20160425.OBS9213/tchernobyl-30-ans-apres-avec-un-stalker-de-la-zone.html|title=Tchernobyl 30 ans après : au coeur de la zone interdite|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monaco Hebdo]] magazine has included it in the list of choices of the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.monacohebdo.mc/16897-la-selection-de-mai|title=Culture Sélection de mai - Monaco Hebdo|date=2016-05-12|work=Monaco Hebdo|access-date=2017-09-15|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian publishing house Keller Editore has bought rights to this text and signed an agreement on translation and publication of “La Zone” in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nora-druk.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1270:lr-&amp;catid=38:anons&amp;Itemid=57|title="Оформляндію" видадуть в Італії|last=|first=|date=|website=nora-druk.com|language=uk-ua|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ukrainian novelist [[Andrey Kurkov]] said about this text: ''"The book "A Stroll to the Zone" (La Zone) by Markian Kamysh is definitely double discovery for any reader! The first discovery is the author himself with his vivid and very dynamic narrative, and the other one - the content of the book that will open for you completely unknown reality - life in Chernobyl zone behind the barbed wire, life described by those who made this zone their secret and illegal playground. Markian Kamysh is one of them and that's why the book is also an honest first hand experience!".''

The Ukrainian film director [[Myroslav Slaboshpytskyi]] ([[The Tribe (2014 film)|The Tribe]]) said about ''"A Stroll to the Zone"'': ''“A new breath and new voice in Ukrainian literature”''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chytomo.com/books-for-summer/5-knig-yaki-radit-prochitati-rezhiser-miroslav-slaboshpickij|title=5 книг, які радить прочитати режисер Мирослав Слабошпицький|date=2016-07-11|work=Читомо|access-date=2017-09-15|language=uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8800">'''Movie Star News''' was{{when|date=October 2014}} a NYC landmark and is a collection of vintage pin-up, bondage, and Hollywood publicity photos amassed over the course of 73 years by [[Irving Klaw]], his sister [[Paula Klaw]] and nephew [[Ira Kramer]]– nearly 3 million images and 250,000 negatives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Movie Star News’ pin-up collection to be auctioned off as famed store closes  |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/movie-star-news-pin-up-collection-auctioned-famed-store-closes-article-1.1125052|website=NY Daily News|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 1,500 prints of [[Bettie Page]], known as the queen of pin-ups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYC Movie, Pin-Up Collection Slated for Auction|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/nyc-movie-pin-collection-slated-auction|website=Big Story|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of the film collection covers the years 1938 to 1979 with many photos dating back to 1915; 11,500 movies and 5,000 actors are represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Movie Collector's Treasure Trove|url=http://www.knpr.org/son/archive/detail2.cfm?SegmentID=9120|website=KNPR|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning==
The family business, which eventually became '''Movie Star News''', began in 1938 when he and his sister Paula opened a struggling used bookstore at 209 East 14th Street in Manhattan.

After he observed teenagers frequently tearing out photos from his movie magazines, he saw an opportunity and started selling movie star stills and lobby photo cards. He set up a small box of used movie stills. When these quickly sold, he contacted the studios for more stills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klaw |first1=Rick |title=The Notorious Irving Klaw |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A346301 |website=Austin Chronicle |accessdate=26 August 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410053213/http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A346301 |archivedate=April 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Irving approached the studios directly back when most Hollywood studio publicity departments lined Manhattan's 11th Ave and discovered they were in the habit of throwing away their publicity materials after a film had had its run. Irving bought as much as he wanted for almost nothing, convincing publicity departments he was doing them a favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scheinman|first1=Stuart|title=A Movie Collector's Treasure Trove|url=http://www.knpr.org/son/archive/detail2.cfm?SegmentID=9120|website=KNPR|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irving would take these originals and negatives meant for magazine and newspaper art departments and reproduce 8×10 glossies of them directly for the purchasing public. The customers could order by item number from catalogs of sample photos. These sold so well that he stopped selling books and moved the store from the basement to the street-level storefront and renamed it '''Irving Klaw Pin Ups'''. Business thrived, and the self-named "Pin-Up King" moved to 212 East 14th Street and took on the name "'''Movie Star News'''".

==Archiving==
In later years the studios, having thrown away their publicity archives would often have to rent their own photos back from Irving. Around the time that Klaw started his bookstore, he also began a mail-order magic trick business, the Nutrix Novelty Library. Like book sales, magic novelties were a financial bust. However, Klaw soon realized that mail order could enhance his movie-still business. He placed advertisements in magazines and shipped catalogs. Before long, mail order was the mainstay of Movie Star News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klaw |first1=Rick |title=The Notorious Irving Klaw |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A346301 |website=Austin Chronicle |accessdate=26 August 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410053213/http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A346301 |archivedate=April 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War Two, Movie Star News sold pin-ups of movie stars to the troops with a mailing list of 100,000 names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYC Movie, Pin-Up Collection Slated for Auction|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/nyc-movie-pin-collection-slated-auction|website=Big Story|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fetish photography==

By the late 1940s, he was receiving frequent requests for "Damsel-in-distress" photos of actresses being bound and gagged, spanked, and flogged. Sometime between 1947 and 1950, Irving Klaw was approached by a prominent lawyer with some "special needs." He offered to pay all the costs if Klaw would produce original bondage pictures for him. Klaw would retain the rights. His first bondage model was [[Lili Dawn]]. She was photographed in midtown studios by various freelance photographers. Eventually, Klaw rented the third floor over '''Movie Star News''' and turned it into a shooting studio. By 1955, Irving Klaw was allegedly grossing $1.5 million a year, primarily through mail order of his fetish pics.

While he worked with many different models, Klaw's images with [[Bettie Page]] were his most popular and best known. He met Page when he contacted camera clubs looking for models for his burgeoning fetish photography business. Page was the most popular pin-up of the 1950s, appearing on more covers than anyone else in the decade. While she was Playboy's Playmate of the Month for January 1955, Page is best remembered for Klaw's bondage photos and the nudes by [[Bunny Yeager]].

Klaw always went to great pains to make sure his photographs contained no nudity, which would make the material pornographic and hence illegal to sell via mail. Models were often required to wear two pairs of panties so that no pubic hair could be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foster|first1=Richard|title=The Real Bettie Page|date=1999|publisher=Citadel Press|location=Secaucus, NJ|isbn=0806520752}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He and Paula, who actually posed and took most of the photos, started selling bondage and fetish photos using burlesque dancers like [[Baby Lake]], [[Tempest Storm]], and [[Blaze Starr]] as models. Klaw always went to great pains to make sure his photographs contained no sex acts or nudity, which would have made the material pornographic and hence illegal to sell via mail.

Through his production company Nutrix Co. (and later also Mutrix Corp), Klaw also published and distributed illustrated adventure/bondage serials by fetish artists [[Eric Stanton]], [[Gene Bilbrew]], [[Adolfo Ruiz]] and others.

Irving Klaw had an unusually close relationship with his sister Paula. The story of Irving and his business has primarily been told through her anecdotes. Paula often ran the front end of the store, but when Klaw began to produce his own photographs and films, Paula befriended the models, often treating them as her own daughters. When another photographer wasn't available, she would grab the camera and shoot the photos. In 1963, in an attempt to satisfy the courts, Irving destroyed his photographs and movies, Paula, unbeknownst to her brother, preserved his legacy – and her financial future – by hiding thousands of the images. After her brother's death, she became fiercely protective of his reputation and his work. Without Paula's foresight, Irving Klaw might have been just an odd, barely remembered footnote in the annals of pin-up history and Fifties puritanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klaw |first1=Rick |title=The Notorious Irving Klaw |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A346301 |website=Austin Chronicle |accessdate=26 August 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410053213/http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A346301 |archivedate=April 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closing==
In the early 1980s '''Movie Star News''' moved to 134 W. 18th Street to avoid rising rents on 14th street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=movie star news|url=http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2011/07/movie-star-news.html|website=Vanishing New York|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012 '''Movie Star News''' moved to Las Vegas Nevada and continues to sell originals and reproductions from the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYC MOVIE, PIN-UP COLLECTION SLATED FOR AUCTION|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/nyc-movie-pin-collection-slated-auction|website=Big Story|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music lessons''' are a type of formal instruction in playing a [[musical instrument]] or [[singing]]. Typically, a student taking music lessons meets a music teacher for one-on-one training sessions ranging from 30 minutes to one hour in length over a period of weeks or years. For vocal lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand and breathe, and how to position the head, chest, and mouth for good vocal tone. For instrument lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand with the instrument, how to hold the instrument, and how to manipulate the fingers and other body parts to produce tones and sounds from the instrument. Music teachers also assign technical exercises, musical pieces, and other activities to help the students improve their musical skills. While most music lessons are one-on-one (private), some teachers also teach groups of two to four students (semi-private lessons), and, for very basic instruction, some instruments are taught in large group lessons, such as piano and acoustic guitar. Since the widespread availability of high speed. low latency [[Internet]], private lessons can also take place through live video chat using [[webcam]]s, [[microphone]]s and [[videotelephony]] online.

Music lessons are part of both amateur music instruction and professional training. In amateur and recreational music contexts, children and adults take music lessons to improve their singing or instrumental playing skills and learn basic to intermediate techniques. In professional training contexts, such as music conservatories, university music performance programs (e.g., [[Bachelor of music]], [[Master of music]], [[Doctor of Musical Arts|DMA]], etc.), students aiming for a career as professional musicians take a music lesson once a week for an hour or more with a music professor over a period of years to learn advanced playing or singing techniques. Many instrumental performers and singers, including a number of [[pop music]] celebrities, have learned music "[[learning music by ear|by ear]]", especially in [[folk music]] styles such as [[blues]] and popular styles such as [[rock music]]. Nevertheless, even in folk and popular styles, a number of performers have had some type of music lessons, such as meeting with a [[vocal coach]] or getting childhood instruction in an instrument such as piano.

For vocal lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand and breathe, and how to position the head and mouth for good vocal tone. For instrument lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand with the instrument, how to hold the instrument, and how to manipulate the fingers and other body parts to produce tones and sounds from the instrument. For wind and brass instruments, the teacher shows the student how to use their lips, tongue, and breath to produce tones and sounds. For some instruments, teachers also train students in the use of the feet, as in the case of piano or other keyboard instruments that have damper or sustain pedals on the piano, the [[pedal keyboard]] on a [[pipe organ]], and some drums and cymbals in the [[drum kit]] such as the bass drum pedal and the hi-hat cymbal pedal. In addition to teaching fingering, teachers also provide other types of instruction. A [[guitar]] player learns how to strum and pluck strings; players of [[wind instrument]]s learn about breath control and [[embouchure]], and [[singer]]s learn how to make the most of their [[vocal cords]] without hurting the throat or vocal cords.

Teachers also show students how to achieve the correct posture for most efficient playing results. For all instruments, the best way to move the fingers and arms to achieve a desired effect is to learn to play with the least tension in your hands and body.  This also prevents forming habits that can injure the skeletal frame and muscles.  For example, when playing the [[piano]], ''fingering''—which fingers to put on which keys—is a skill slowly learned as the student advances, and there are many standard techniques a teacher can pass on.

There are many myths and misconceptions among music teachers, especially in the Western classical tradition, about "good" posture and "bad" posture. Students who find that playing their instruments causes them physical pain should bring this to their teachers' attention. It could be a potentially serious health risk, but it is often overlooked when learning to play an instrument. Learning to use one's body in a manner consistent with the way their anatomy is designed to work can mean the difference between a crippling injury and a lifetime of enjoyment. Many music teachers would caution students about taking "no pain, no gain" as an acceptable response from their music teacher regarding a complaint of physical pain.  Concerns about use-related injury and the [[ergonomics]] of musicianship have gained more mainstream acceptance in recent years. Musicians have increasingly been turning to medical professionals, physical therapists, and specialized techniques seeking relief from pain and prevention of serious injury. There exists a plurality of special techniques for an even greater plurality of potential difficulties. The [[Alexander Technique]] is just one example of these specialized approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uic.edu/sph/glakes/harts1/HARTS_library/musichaz.txt Occupational Hazards In Music]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory and history ==
To fully understand [[music]] being played, the student must learn the basics of the underlying [[music theory]]. Along with [[musical notation]], students learn rhythmic techniques—like controlling [[tempo]], recognizing [[time signature]]s, and the theory of [[harmony]], including [[chord (music)|chord]]s and [[key signature]]s. In addition to basic theory, a good teacher stresses ''musicality'', or how to make the music sound good. This includes how to create good, pleasing tone, how to do musical phrasing, and how to use [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness and softness) to make the piece or song more expressive.

Most music lessons include some instruction in the history of the type of music that the student is learning. When a student is taking Western [[classical music]] lessons, music teachers often spend some time explaining the different eras of western classical music, such as the [[Baroque Era]], the [[Classical period music|Classical]] era, the [[Romantic Era]], and the [[contemporary classical music era]], because each era is associated with different styles of music and different [[performance practice]] techniques. Instrumental music from the Baroque era is often played in the 2000s as teaching pieces for piano students, string instrument players, and wind instrument players. If students just try to play these Baroque pieces by reading the notes from the score, they might not get the right type of interpretation. However, once a student learns that most Baroque instrumental music was associated with dances, such as the [[gavotte]] and the [[sarabande]], and keyboard music from the Baroque era was played on the [[harpsichord]] or the pipe organ, a modern-day student is better able to understand how the piece should be played. If, for example, a [[cello]] player is assigned a gavotte that was originally written for harpsichord, this gives the student insight in how to play the piece. Since it is a dance, it should have a regular, clear pulse, rather than a Romantic era-style shifting [[tempo rubato]]. As well, since it was originally written for the harpsichord, a light-sounding keyboard instrument in which the strings are plucked with quills, this suggests that the notes should be played relatively lightly, and with spaces between each note, rather than in a full-bodied, sustained [[legato]].

== Technical exercises ==
Although not universally accepted, many teachers drill students with the repetitive playing of certain patterns, such as [[scale (music)|scales]], [[arpeggio]]s, and [[rhythm]]s. Scales are often taught because they are the building blocks of melody in most Western art music. In addition, there are flexibility studies, which make it physically easier to play the instrument. 
Percussion instruments use rudiments that help in the development of sticking patterns, roll techniques and other little nuances such as flams and drags.

There are sets of exercises for piano designed to stretch the connection between fourth and fifth fingers, making them more independent. Brass players practice ''lip slurs'', which are unarticulated changes in [[embouchure]] between [[Harmonic series (music)#Terminology|partial]]s.  Woodwind players (Saxophone, Clarinet, and Flute) have a multitude of exercises to help with tonguing techniques, finger dexterity, and tone development. Entire books of [[etude]]s have been written to this purpose.

== Pieces ==
Teachers typically assign the student pieces (or songs for vocal students) of slowly increasing difficulty. Besides using pieces to teach various musical rudiments (rhythm, harmony, pitch, etc.) and teach the elements of good playing (or singing) style, a good teacher also inspires more intangible qualities—such as expressiveness and musicianship. Pieces (or songs) are more enjoyable for most students than theory or scale exercises, and an emphasis on learning new pieces is usually required to maintain students' motivation. However, the teacher must not over-accommodate a student's desire for "fun" pieces.  Often the student's idea of fun music is popular vocal selections, movie soundtracks, and [[TV show]] theme songs, etc. While some of these "fun" pieces can be performed, pieces should also be selected for pedagogical reasons, such as challenging the student and honing their skills. Student should learn something from every piece they play.  In addition, for students to be well rounded they must play many types of pieces by composers and songwriters from different eras, ranging from [[Renaissance music]] to pieces from the 20th and 21st century.  A varied repertoire increases the student's musical understanding and skill.

== Examinations ==
A popular measure of progress, especially for children, is external assessment of the progress of the pupil by a regular [[music examination|examination]].  A number of exam boards assess pupils on music theory or practice.  These are available for almost every musical instrument. A common method to mark progress is graded examinations—for example from grade 1 (beginner) to grade 8 (ready to enter higher study at music school).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musiceducationmadness.org/lesson_plans-shtml/ Lesson Plans]&lt;/ref&gt; Some teachers prefer other methods of target-setting for their pupils.  The most common is the pupil's concert, which gives experience in playing in public and under a certain degree of pressure, without outright criticism or a more or less arbitrary marking system.  Another is the graded system of books followed by teachers of the [[Suzuki method]], in which the completion of each book is celebrated, without a system of marking or ranking of pupils.

== Extra-musical benefits ==
[[File:Jean-Marc Nattier, La Leçon de musique (1710).jpg|right|220px|thumb|[[Jean-Marc Nattier]], ''The music lesson'', (1711)]]

Some studies suggests that music lessons provide children with important developmental benefits beyond simply the knowledge or skill of playing a musical instrument. Research suggests that musical lessons may enhance intelligence and academic achievement, build self-esteem and improve discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Dianne|title=The Positives of Learning About Music|url=http://www.justmusiclessons.com.au/the-positives-of-learning-about-music/|publisher=Shine Music|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent [[Rockefeller Foundation]] Study found that music majors have the highest rate of admittance to medical schools, followed by biochemistry and the humanities.  On [[SAT]] tests, the national average scores were 427 on the verbal and 476 on math.  At the same time, music students averaged 465 on the verbal and 497 on the math -  38 and 21 points higher, respectively.{{cn|date=January 2015}}  However, the observed correlation between musical and mathematical ability may be inherent rather than acquired.  Furthermore, it is possible that the correlation between taking music lessons and academic ability exists because both are strongly correlated with parental income and education.  Even if music lessons had no impact on academic ability, one would expect to see a correlation between music lessons and academic ability.

Skills learned through the discipline of music may transfer to [[study skills]], communication skills, and cognitive skills useful in every part of a child's studies at school, though.  An in-depth [[Harvard University]] study found evidence that spatial-temporal reasoning improves when children learn to make music, and this kind of reasoning improves temporarily when adults listen to certain kinds of music, including Mozart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rauscher|first1=Frances H.|title=Music and spatial task performance|journal=Nature|date=14 October 1993|volume=365|issue=611|doi=10.1038/365611a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v365/n6447/abs/365611a0.html|accessdate=20 January 2015|pmid=8413624}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding (named ''The [[Mozart effect]]'') suggests that music and spatial reasoning are related psychologically (i.e., they may rely on some of the same underlying skills) and perhaps neurologically as well. However, there has been considerable controversy over this as later researchers have failed to reproduce the original findings of Rauscher (e.g. Steele, Bass &amp; Crook, 1999), questioned both theory and methodology of the original study (Fudis &amp; Lembesis 2004) and suggested that the enhancing effects of music in experiments have been simply due to an increased level of arousal (Thompson, Schellenberg &amp; Husain, 2001).

A relationship between music and the strengthening of [[math]], [[dance]], [[Reading (process)|reading]], creative thinking and visual arts skills has also been reported in [[literature]]. (Winner, Hetland, Sanni, as reported in ''The Arts and Academic Achievement - What the Evidence Shows'', 2000) However recent findings by Dr. Levitin of [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]], undermines the suggested connection between musical ability and higher math skills. In a study conducted on patients with [[Williams syndrome]] (a genetic disorder causing low intelligence), he found that even though their [[intelligence]] was that of young children, they still possessed an unusually high level of musical ability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5617">An official system of weights and measures was established{{cn|date=February 2015}} in the ancient 
[[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] under the Achaemenid dynasty (550-350 BCE). The shekel and mina ("profane" or "sacred") were units of both weight and volume. A shekel or mina weight was equal to the weight of that volume of water. The talent was a measure of weight used for large amounts of coinage. Some related units were used in Persia in the 19th century, and are still used in contemporary Iran.

===Volume===
The ''shekel'' and ''mina'' ("profane" or "sacred") were units of both weight and volume. A ''shekel'' or ''mina'' weight was equal to the weight of that volume of water. Note that the values given for the ''mina'' do not match the definitions.

: 1 ''shekel'' = 8.3 ml (approximately 1 cubic ''aiwas'').
: 1 profane ''mina'' = 50 ''shekel'' = 500 ml (approximately 27 cubic ''aiwas'').
: 1 sacred ''mina'' = 60 ''shekel'' = 600 ml (approximately 1 cubic ''dva'').
: 1 talent (volume) = 60 profane ''mina'' = 25 liters (approximately 1  cubic ''trayas'').

===Weight===
The '''talent''' was a measure of weight used for large amounts of coinage (bullion, bulk coin), rather than an individual coin. Seven [[Babylonia]]n talents equalled ten Attic talents, according to a list of the revenues of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus the Great (Cyrus II of Persia)]] recorded in [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Book III, 90-96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Burn, Andrew R. |title=Persia and the Greeks: the defence of the West, c. 546-478 BC |publisher=Duckworth |location=[London] |year=1984 |pages=123–126 |isbn=0-7156-1765-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''𐎣𐎼𐏁''' (karša) or '''𐎣𐎼𐏁𐎹𐎠''' (karšayā) is a unit of weight equal to 10 Babylonian ''shekels'' or 1/6 Babylonian ''mina'' weighing approximately 83g.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum No. 91117 Inscribed weight; http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=367895&amp;partId=1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Garfield's PET FORCE (front cover).JPG|thumb|150px|The cover of the first book, ''The Outrageous Origin''.]]

'''''Pet Force''''' is a series of books for young readers. It is a spin-off of ''[[Garfield]]'', in which the main animal characters of the comic series are portrayed as [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es. The action takes place on planet Polyester.

[[20th Century Fox]] has released a computer-animated direct-to-video film ''[[Garfield's Pet Force]]''.

== Story ==
In another [[universe]], one which exists parallel to Garfield's own, a team of five [[superheroes]] known as "Pet Force" serve Emperor [[Jon Arbuckle|Jon]] as protectors of his throne. Ruling the galaxy from the planet Polyester, Jon's reign is constantly opposed by the evil Vetvix. When Vetvix uses a new weapon and strips Pet Force of their powers, and sends them to a ghostly dimension where they will be trapped forever, Jon is forced to have his right-hand man, Sorcerer Binky, use a dimensional portal to find five alternate versions of the heroes to take their place. In Garfield's universe, ''Pet Force'' is a best-selling comic book, and when Nermal buys the limited-edition 100th issue, it becomes a portal through which they are pulled into the alternate universe, becoming the new Pet Force. Although they return to their own universe after the initial adventure, they subsequently return to fight Vetvix and other evils when needed.

==Books==
*'''Book #1:''' The Outrageous Origin (1998)
*'''Book #2:''' Pie-Rat's Revenge (1998)
*'''Book #3:''' K-Niner: Dog of Doom (1998)
*'''Book #4:''' Menace of the Mutanator (1998)
*'''Book #5:''' Attack of the Lethal Lizards (1999)

==Characters==
The characters in Pet Force include characters from the original Garfield universe, as well as some entirely new characters.

===Heroes===

====Garzooka====
Garzooka is the [[superhero]] version of [[Garfield]] and the leader of Pet Force. Garzooka's abilities are [[Gamma radiation|gamma-radiated]] hairballs, [[superhuman strength]], and razor-sharp claws in his right hand that can rend solid steel.   While the original Garzooka was heroic and a born leader, the Garzooka created from Garfield is lazy and gluttonous, though he still focuses on the task at hand.

====Odious====
Odious is the superhero version of [[Odie]] and the dumbest of the Pet Force. Odious, like his normal comic counterpart Odie, does not talk. He drools, licks, and barks, which is how he acts in the original Garfield comics. Odious' abilities are a "super-stretchy stun tongue" that causes a [[Coma|total mental meltdown]] in anyone he uses it against, super-slippery saliva, and superhuman strength.

====Abnermal====
Abnermal is the superhero version of [[Nermal]]. Unlike the rest of the team, Abnermal quickly takes to his superpowers and is overjoyed to be a hero. Abnermal's abilities include his Pester Power, the ability to create force fields, and a [[body temperature]] of [[absolute zero]] that allows him to freeze anything he touches and project ice blasts. In the movie, he is given super speed.

====Starlena====
Starlena is the superhero version of [[List of Garfield characters#Arlene|Arlene]]. Starlena's abilities are a siren song that puts anyone who hears it into a deep trance, to which only Garzooka, Odious and the Lethal Lizard member Snake are immune, and the ability to fly. In the movie, she is granted the power to freeze enemies with her eyes.

====Compooky====
Compooky, half [[teddy bear]], half [[robot]], is a superhero version of Garfield's teddy bear, [[List of Garfield characters#Pooky|Pooky]]. Despite being an inanimate teddy bear in Garfield's universe, in the alternate universe Compooky can speak and is furthermore highly intelligent. Having no real combat abilities, he normally stays on board their ship while the others deal with the crisis. He does not exist in the movie version of Pet Force.

===Villains===

====Vetvix====
A beautiful and powerful sorceress, Vetvix is the main [[villain]] of the Pet Force, an evil [[veterinarian]]. The source of her evil is a power crystal on her headband. Vetvix's main source of minions is an animal-splicing machine that allows her to mix and match parts from other animals and create [[Chimera (genetics)|new creatures]] that are entirely under her control. She is also highly skilled with [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[genetics]]. She is the opposite of [[List of Garfield characters#Dr. Liz Wilson|Dr. Liz]]. Emperor Jon might have strong feelings for her.

====K-Niner====
K-Niner is a [[Doberman Pinscher|Doberman]] with enhanced intelligence and superhuman strength, as well as a British accent and demeanor. Vetvix created a brain-booster that he then used to increase the intelligence of various other dogs, and gave those dogs mind-controlling collars to place on their owners and make them think they were dogs. Eventually, he was defeated by Pet Force and transformed back into a regular Doberman.

====The Space Pie-Rat====
A large rat with a monstrous appetite, he is Vetvix's main minion until he rebels against her and is defeated. He steals food from any planet he visits and wears a fake [[pegleg]] and an [[eyepatch]], despite having both eyes; he just likes the look. When he is successfully manipulated by Vetvix into repairing her power crystal for her, she punishes him for his betrayal by [[Teleportation|teleporting]] him into the core of an [[asteroid]].

====The Mutanator====
A monster created by Vetvix from the pieces of Pet Force minus Garzooka, the Mutanator possessed all the powers of the original four members, including Compooky's super-computer intelligence, Starlena's siren song, Odious' super-strength, and Abnermal's force fields and ice powers. Because of Garzooka's reluctance to injure his friends, the Mutanator was able to defeat him, but was later split apart and restored to the original members of Pet Force.

====The Lethal Lizards====
A trio of reptiles from the swamp planet of Reptilius, mutated by energy emitted from Vetvix's [[laboratory]] during her experiments with the Mutanator and K-Niner. They acquire superpowers and [[humanoid]] forms and, after learning of Vetvix's plans and Emperor Jon, decide to take over the universe themselves. The trio do not get along very well, often insulting each other with dry wit and sarcasm, and their arguments sometimes even escalate to physical violence. In the end, Pet Force defeats them, and they are carted off to prison. Their members consist of:
* '''Dragon''': A ten-foot-tall [[Komodo dragon]], and the leader of the group, who also has a short temper and dislikes to give up any position of power among his gang or admit when he is wrong. He is noted by Garzooka as having superpowers similar to his own; he possesses superhuman strength, razor-sharp claws, and [[Fire breathing|the ability to breathe fire]]. Due to his mutation, he is also intelligent enough to figure out how to capably fly a [[spacecraft|spaceship]].
* '''[[Chameleon]]''': A five-foot-tall chameleon who possesses potentially unlimited [[shapeshifting]] powers in addition to a long tongue similar to Odious's. In addition, his eyes can rotate independently of one another, allowing him to look in two directions at once.
* '''[[Snake]]''': A fifteen-foot-long [[boa constrictor]]. Before his mutation, he was barely a foot long and had no [[fang]]s. He can squeeze his opponents with incredible force, open his mouth incredibly wide to swallow people whole, and his venom can kill a victim within a few minutes. Also, as he has no ears and is thus deaf, he is completely immune to the effects of Starlena's siren song.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1361">'''Philosophy of design''' is the study of assumptions, foundations, and implications of [[design]].  The field is defined by an interest in a set of problems, or an interest in central or foundational concerns in design.  In addition to these central problems for design as a whole, many philosophers of design consider these problems as they apply to particular disciplines (e.g. [[philosophy of art]]).  Although most practitioners are [[philosopher]]s, several prominent [[designer]]s and [[artist]]s have contributed to the field.

[[File:Puck 1629.JPG|thumb|Illustration from the title page of ''Robin Goodfellow: His Mad Pranks and Merry Jests'' (1629)]]

In [[English folklore]], '''[[Puck (mythology)|Puck]]''' is a mythological [[fairy]] or mischievous [[nature]] [[sprite (creature)|sprite]]. Puck is also a generalized personification of land spirits. In more recent times, the figure of '''Robin Goodfellow''' is identified as a puck. The [[Old English]] "puca" is a kind of half-tamed [[woodland]] [[sprite (creature)|sprite]], leading folk astray with echoes and lights in nighttime woodlands (like the [[Germanic paganism|German and Dutch]] "Weisse Frauen" and "Witte Wieven" and [[French people|the French]] "Dames Blanches," all "White Ladies"), or coming into the farmstead and souring milk in the churn. '''Puck''' has appeared many times in popular culture.

==Examples==
Puck's [[Puck (Shakespeare)|most famous appearance]] is in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.

As Robin Goodfellow, Puck appears in a roughly contemporaneous [[English literature#Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] play, ''[[Grim the Collier of Croydon]]'' (1600). It is unknown how Shakespeare's Puck appeared on the stage; but the figure in ''Grim'' was costumed "in a suit of leather close to his body; his face and hands coloured russet-coloured, with a flail."

Puck is the story-framer in ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'' (1906) and ''[[Rewards and Fairies]]'' (1910) short story cycles by [[Rudyard Kipling]].

In [[Susanna Clarke]]'s short story "[[The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories|The Ladies of Grace Adieu]]," Robin Goodfellow appears as a mischievous yet caring servant to Auberon.

In [[Orson Scott Card]]'s novel ''[[Magic Street]]'', and in his short film, ''Remind me Again'', we meet Puck, [[Titania|Queen Titania]], and [[Oberon]] in a modern, urban setting. In [[Raymond E. Feist]]'s novel ''[[Faerie Tale]]'', Puck is a fey being in the faerie court and is portrayed as a jester of sorts, and stays true to the mythology of him as a trickster. At times throughout the novel he is referred to as Puck, Putz, and Aerial, and assists the main characters to prevent evil King Oberon from seizing global power over humanity. In [[Pamela Dean]]'s ''[[Tam Lin (novel)|Tam Lin]]'' (a modern retelling of the [[Tam Lin|Scottish faerie ballad]]), the character of Robin Armin is implied to be Puck; he [[Robert Armin|used a similar name]] while performing as a singer and actor for [[King's Men (playing company)|The King's Men]], and had been the inspiration for the Shakespearean Puck and several other comic characters, but he and the others of his troupe were unsuccessful in luring the Bard off to the Fair Lands.

In [[Mercedes Lackey]]'s novel ''[[The Wizard of London]]'' Robin Goodfellow/Puck steps in to play himself in a boarding school's production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' when no one suitable can be found for the part. He reappears throughout the novel mainly in his friendlier aspect, but becomes extremely dangerous when crossed.

The [[List of characters in The Sandman#Puck|Puck]] who appears in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' is a trickster and maker of mischief.

''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' was an [[United States|American]] and then [[United Kingdom|British]] humour magazine, somewhat similar to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.

In the animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'', [[Oberon's children#Puck|Puck]] is a traditional trickster and an important supporting character. During the long exile from [[Avalon]], Puck comes across [[Oberon's children#Titania|Queen Titania]] in the human guise of Anastasia Renard, the wife of [[David Xanatos]]' aged and ailing business rival Halcyon Renard. He also meets a nearly emotionless businessman named Preston Vogel, working in Halcyon's employ. Amused with the "wooden behavior" of the mortal, Puck decides to play the [[Double act|straight man]] for a while, and reinvents himself as [[List of Gargoyles characters#Owen Burnett|Owen Burnett]], who becomes Xanatos' business manager.

In the 1989 movie ''[[Dead Poets Society]]'', one of the main characters, Neil Perry, plays the part of Puck in a secondary school rendition of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''.

In ''[[Michael Buckley (author)|Michael Buckley]]'''s ''[[The Sisters Grimm]]'' series, Puck is an Everafter who takes on the form of an 11-year-old boy. He is described as rude, selfish, and immature, and occasionally plays pranks on the Grimm Family. He helps them solve most of their cases, and lives with them in their house.

Puck plays a central role in [[Mark Chadbourn]]'s fantasy trilogy, [[Kingdom of the Serpent]], comprising the novels ''Jack of Ravens'', ''The Burning Man'', and ''Destroyer of Worlds''.  Puck manipulates the heroes in an epic battle between good and evil over two thousand years of human history.

The children's theater play ''Robin Goodfellow'' by [[Aurand Harris]] is a retelling of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' from Puck's point of view.

In [[Kentaro Miura]]'s dark fantasy manga [[Berserk (manga)|Berserk]], Puck is one of the main character's earliest companions. He is a fairy-like elf of the Pisky race, and serves as comedy relief.
Puck, the faerie dragon, is the name of a hero in the game mod ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'' and its sequel ''[[Dota 2]]''.

Puck is a small rat-boy in Final Fantasy 9 who messes around with other people.

Puck is also one of the lead characters of [[Julie Kagawa]]'s Iron Fey series. When the series begins, he hovers around as the lead character's bodyguard but as it progresses, he reveals himself to be one of the love interests of the heroine.

In the [[Nightside (book series)|Nightside]] series by [[Simon R. Green]] Puck is the only imperfect elf. Born as son of queen Mab and a Camelot knight, Puck is the only hunchback fairy. He is mischievous and usually deceives the main character for a long time. Later in the series he ends the elf civil war between Oberon and Mab by deceiving and killing his own mother, when she wouldn't give up her revenge.

The [[Cal Leandros series]] by [[Rob Thurman]] predominantly features the character Robin Goodfellow, also known as Rob Fellows. The character has crossed over into the author's [[Trickster series]].

Puck also appears in several books of author [[Mercedes Lackey]]'s [[Elemental Masters]] series.  He appears in [[The Wizard of London]], [[Unnatural Issue]], and [[Home From the Sea]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41044">'''Serbian art''' refers to the [[visual arts]] of the [[Serbs]] and their nation-state [[Serbia]]. The medieval heritage includes [[Byzantine art]], preserved in architecture, frescos and icons of the many Serbian Orthodox monasteries. In the Early modern period, Serbian visual arts began to be influenced by Western art, culminating in the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in the late 18th century. The beginning of modern Serbian art is placed in the 19th century.

==Prehistory==
Currently, Europe's oldest known civilization was discovered in [[Serbia]], namely [[Lepinski Vir]] and [[Vinča culture]]. In Serbia, [[Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)]] (Serbian: Археолошка налазишта/Arheološka nalazišta) are many and have the highest level of state protection under the Law on Cultural Heritage. See: [[Prehistoric sites in Serbia]] and [[Prehistory of Southeastern Europe]] for artifacts and sculpture found at the archeological sites of Lepinski Vir. Here are some images of Serbian prehistory art.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.ca/search?q=serbian+prehistory+art&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA791CA791&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTwIzyyO_dAhWpxYMKHXk4BJkQsAR6BAgCEAE&amp;biw=1858&amp;bih=959&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman period==
Geographically Serbia was always part of the [[Roman Empire]] whether it was ruled from [[Rome]] or from [[Byzantium]]. The Roman ruins are found throughout the [[Balkan Peninsula]].

==Medieval Serbian art==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
Church architecture developed under the patronage of the medieval Serbian state. The most distinctive piece of medieval Serbian architecture was the [[Studenica monastery]] founded by [[Stefan Nemanja]], the founder of medieval Serbia ca. 1190. This monastery also featured significant works of art including its Byzantine style [[fresco]] paintings. Its church also features extensive sculptures based on Psalms and the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]]. UNESCO added this monastery to its list of World Cultural Heritage sites in 1986. It was the model for other monasteries at [[Mileševa monastery|Mileševa]], [[Sopoćani]] and the [[Visoki Dečani]]. The influence of Byzantine art became more influential after the capture of [[Constantinople]] in 1204 in the [[Fourth Crusade]] when many Greek artists fled to Serbia. Their influence can be seen at the Church of the Ascension at [[Mileševa]] as well as in the wall paintings at the Church of the Holy Apostles at [[Peć]] and at the Sopoćani Monastery. Icons also formed a significant part of church art. The influence of Byzantine architecture reached its [[Serbian Orthodox Church#Serbo-Byzantine Style|peak]] after 1300 including the rebuilding of the [[Our Lady of Ljeviš]] (ca. 1306–1307) and [[St. George]] at [[Staro Nagoričane]] as well as the [[Gračanica monastery]]. Church decorative paintings and religious arts and crafts also developed further in the period. The most noteworthy painters at the time were [[Michael Astrapas and Eutychios]] (fl. 1294-1317) and before them, '''Deacon Jovan''' and '''Rufin'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macedonia.co.uk/client/index1.aspx?page=223&lt;/ref&gt;

Icon of the Holy Virgin [[Pelagonitissa]], dating from 1421, is considered one of the last outstanding achievements of icon painting, a representation of the then still-living Byzantine iconography. Its author '''Makarije Zograf''' worked on the icon in the Church of Transfiguration in the monastery of the village [[Zrze]], near [[Prilep]], and many other Serbian monasteries during the fifteenth century. Makarije Zograf and his brother Metropolitan '''Jovan Zograf''' cared for the monastery endowment until it was transferred to Constantine, the village head (''kmet'').&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=mkYWAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=makarije+zograf&amp;dq=makarije+zograf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj57Lie0pPeAhUJwYMKHVtCC60Q6AEIXzAI&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Visoki Dečani monastery]] in [[Metohija]] was built between 1330 and 1350. Unlike other Serbian monasteries of the period, it was built with [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] features by master-builders under the monk Vitus of Kotor. Its frescoes feature 1000 portraits portraying all of the major themes of the New Testament. The cathedral features [[iconostasis]], [[Hegumen|hegumen's]] throne and carved royal sarcophagus. In 2004, UNESCO listed the Dečani Monastery on the World Heritage List.

There was a further spate of church building as the Serbian state contracted to the Morava basin in the late 14th century. Prince [[Stefan Lazarević]] was a poet and patron of the arts who founded the church at [[Manasija monastery|Resava]] at [[Morava rivers, Serbia|Morava]] with the wall paintings having a theme of parables of Christ with the people portrayed wearing feudal Serbian costumes.

Manuscripts were another significant feature of Serbian medieval art. ''Miroslav's Gospel'' features lavish calligraphy and miniatures and is a significant artwork as well as a notable work of literature. The [[Chludov Psalter]] dating from the 14th century is beautifully decorated and was probably owned by a high-ranking noble. Serbian princes were well known in the 15th century for supporting manuscripts employing [[scribe]]s and artists to create manuscripts besides icons and frescoes. [[Lovro Dobričević]] (1420-1478) of [[Kotor]] was a Venetian painter of Serbian origin, though Roman Catholic by confession, who first started to paint in the Serbian Orthodox [[Savina Monastery, Montenegro|Savina Monastery]] in Zeta and [[Serbian Despotate]] (now [[Montenegro]]) in the mid-15th century.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.visit-montenegro.com/montenegro/montenegro-museum-in-the-open/monastery-savina/&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 19th century, Serbian medieval art was used as inspiration for notable architect [[Andrey Damyanov]] who, between 1835 and 1878, along the [[Vardar]] and [[Morava Valley]]s and Bosnia, built around 40 churches and other buildings. &lt;ref name="balkanologie"&gt;[http://journals.openedition.org/balkanologie/1932?file=1 Journal Balkanologie] by Bernard Lory, December 2002, retrieved 3-4-2018 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adapting to the social demand of its Serbian sponsors, Damyanov combined simultaneously traditional elements of the 15th century Morava school with Occidental baroque elements found North of Sava river.&lt;ref name="balkanologie"/&gt;

Thanks are due to field scientist and academic [[Gabriel Millet]] who was the first to bring Serbian art to the attention of the West in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/3641241/Contribution_de_Gabriel_Millet_%C3%A0_l%C3%A9tude_de_lart_Serbe&lt;/ref&gt;The other is Serbian-American scientist [[Michael Pupin]], who gathered an international team of scholars and public figures to support the preservation of architectural heritage during and after the [[Great War]]. In 1918, Sir [[Thomas Graham Jackson]], in Pupin's "Serbian Orthodox Church" on the medieval Serbian churches, refuted the notion that Serbian art was nothing more than a branch of [[Byzantine art]] and showed that Serbian art had an original character of its own.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- INSERT THESE IN THE TABLE [http://www.sv-luka.org/ikone/sericins.htm]https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Mihajlo-Pupin-South-Slavs-Monuments-vol-I-Serbian-Orthodox-Church-New-York-and_fig1_282186492&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox fresco painting represents the peak of Serbian medieval art. Its birth went in line with the creation and development of medieval Serbian state, but unlike Serbian state it didn't cease to exist during the Ottoman occupation. While Serbian architecture has seen mixed influences of both [[Byzantine]] and [[Medieval Italy|medieval Italian states]], fresco and icon painting remained deeply rooted in solely eastern byzantine tradition. 
 
Frescos were being painted under the patronage of Serbian rulers, as the highest form of religious decorative form. Following the political expansion and military growth, the 13th and 14th century are marked as the period when the biggest amount of newly built or existing sanctuaries have been decorated, mostly by unknown artists. Studenica monastery has been built in 1196 under the patronage of [[Stefan Nemanja]], the founder of [[Nemanjić dynasty]], and ever since it enjoyed the care of Stefan's descendants as the ''archi-model''. Its most representative fresco, ''The Crucifixion'', was made twelve years later, in 1208, on the blue background brought into contrast with golden-yellow of Christ's bare crucified body. In the second half of 14th century an unknown artist painted monumental ''The Dormition of the Virgin'' in Sopoćani monastery, which remained the supreme achievement of byzantine painting tradition. 
 
However, the most famous Serbian medieval fresco is the ''Myrrhbearers'' (or the "White Angel")&lt;ref name="Art in the middle ages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/isk/vdjuric-medieval_art.html |title=Art in the middle ages |publisher=rastko.rs |accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Mileševa monastery|Mileševa]] monastery, painted in 1235, on the southern wall of the church. It depicts [[Archangel Gabriel]] sitting on Christ's grave. The identity of its author is unknown. In the 16th century, the ''White Angel'' was over-painted with another fresco, and so was hidden until the 20th century when the fresco was restored.&lt;ref name="novosti-mileseva"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/srbija.73.html:391503-Manastir-Mileseva---crkva-Belog-andjela | title=Manastir Mileševa - crkva Belog anđela | publisher=[[Večernje novosti]] | date=5 August 2012 | accessdate=19 December 2014 |trans-title=Mileševa Monastery - the Church if the White Angel | language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fresco was sent as a message in the first [[Satellite television|satellite broadcast]] signal from [[Europe]] to [[United States|America]] after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], as a [[symbol]] of [[peace]] and [[civilization]].&lt;ref name="prijepolje"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.turizamprijepolje.org.rs/index.php/n-s-ir-il-sh-v-i-b-li-nd | title=Манастир Милешева и Бели Анђео | publisher=Tourist Organisation of Preijepolje | accessdate=19 December 2014 |trans-title=Mileševa Monastery and the White Angel | language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the same signal, containing the White Angel, was transmitted to space in an attempt to communicate with [[extraterrestrial life]] forms.&lt;ref name="52vikenda"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.srbija.travel/download/brosure/52_vikenda_smanjen.pdf | title=52 vikenda u Srbiji | publisher=Tourist Organisation of Serbia | author=Mihaljčić, Milena | year=2013 | location=Belgrade | pages=30 | isbn=978-86-6005-278-2 |trans-title=52 Weekends in Serbia | language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vesti-online.com/Vesti/Srbija/272313/Filaret-zinuo-na-Belog-andela | title=Filaret zinuo na Belog anđela | publisher=Vesti Online | date=25 November 2012 | accessdate=19 December 2014 | author=Lončar, R. |trans-title=Filaret Gasps at the White Angel | language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another notable mention is the fresco of Serbian queen [[Simonida]], in [[Gračanica monastery]], today located on the disputed territory of [[Kosovo]]. Born as Simonis Palaiologina, she was a daughter of the Byzantine Emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] (r. 1282–1328) and [[Irene of Montferrat]], and the fourth wife of Serbian king [[Stefan Milutin]] (r. 1282–1321). Two celebrated Serbian poems were inspired by the beauty of the fresco. Two dark stains on the places where queen's eyes were supposed to be have created a common belief that her eyes were being ''carved out'' by [[Albanian people|Albanian]]s, hence the well-known strophe by [[Milan Rakić]]:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Your eyes were gouged out, oh beautiful image, 
On a pilaster at approach of night, 
Knowing that no one would witness the pillage,
An Albanian’s knife robbed you of your sight.&lt;ref&gt;''Simonida'', Kosara Gavrilović translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
However, between 1971 and 1976, during the conservation works in the monastery, it was discovered that for centuries the queen's eyes were lying under what actually was (unsuccessfully intentionally damaged) grey layer. Once the patches were removed, ''Simonida'' was shown to media with light-blue eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.danas.rs/danasrs/drustvo/terazije/ko_je_simonidi_iskopao_oci.14.html?news_id=199228 | title=Ko je Simonidi iskopao oci | publisher=Danas | accessdate=June 9, 2017 | language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th and 17th centuries==
The Ottoman conquest of Serbia during the 15th century is traditionally said to have had a negative impact of the visual arts. The Serbs became part of the [[Rum Millet]] (Christian community), and were regarded a lower class ([[rayah]]). The Serbian nobility was not integrated into the Ottoman state system. The church was abolished in long periods by the Ottoman government. As the nobility and church were the main sources of patronage for architects and artists, the Early Modern period is considered an artistically less productive period in Serbian art. Despite the general trend, remarkable monuments were built. There was some resumption of artistic endeavour after the restoration of the Serbian Patriarchate in 1557. '''Zograf Longin''' (1530-1600) and [[Georgije Mitrofanović]] were the leading painters of the late 16th and early 17th century. Mitrofanović's work on the church at the [[Morača Monastery]] is considered one of his best. Traditional Serbian art was beginning to show some Baroque influences at the end of the 18th century as shown in the works of [[Nikola Nešković]], [[Teodor Kračun]] and [[Jakov Orfelin]]. Among the icon painters working in the Byzantine tradition in Old Slavonia were '''Nikola Klisur''' (mid-17th century)&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=JEpLAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=nikola+klisur&amp;dq=nikola+klisur&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTibCj4ZPeAhUH7YMKHa2ZAUEQ6AEIPTAD&lt;/ref&gt;and '''Ostoja Mrkojević''' (late 17th century).&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=vI4MAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=ostoja+mrkojevic&amp;dq=ostoja+mrkojevic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn0fW245PeAhUlzIMKHTp6D8AQ6AEIKzAA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baroque===
Painting of the Early Baroque did not create a homogeneous group of painters. It developed under the Russian-Ukrainian and Southern Balkans basis and the influences that had slowly arrived from Western European art centers. The first generation of Baroque painters nourished on the learnings of the Russian painter Jov Vasilievich and Vasilije Romanovich, then the trainee of the Kiev Academy of painting,[[Dimitrije Bačević]], Vasilije Ostojić, Joakim Marković, Jovan Popović, Amvrosije Janković, Dimitrije Popović, Teodor Stefanov Gologlavac, and [[Stefan Tenecki]]. The work of Balkan icon painters in the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] throughout the 18th century. Teodor Simonov (born in Moschopolis) worked for the Serbian Orthodox [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]] during the eight decade of the 18th century. Simonov painted the walls of the church monastery in Stolni Beograd, today's [[Székesfehérvár]] in Hungary. The works of [[Jovan Četirević Grabovan]] who completed part of his education in [[Imperial Russia]], and returned to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] to settle in [[Osijek]] in [[Slavonia]] where he developed a rich icon-painting activity. The works of others who also came originally from southern parts of the Balkans (once known as [[Old Serbia]]) such as [[Hristofor Žefarović]] and [[Janko Halkozović]], created in the spirit of the Levant Baroque, relying on the transferred experience of Italian Renaissance art and the Byzantine tradition, which resulted in a distinctive model of Baroque icons. The originator of the more direct rotation on Central European models was Joakim Marković, whose work is linked to the first portraits and [[Still life]]s, and in church painting of historical compositions and heraldic depictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=СЛИКАРСТВО РАНОГ БАРОКА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XVIII ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/slikarstvo-ranog-baroka.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High Baroque art was reflected on the firmer cultural orientation towards Vienna, as well as church and school reforms. The changes are visible in the works of [[Teodor Kračun]] who in his work represents a significant step towards understanding the actual Central European art. The retrospective Orthodox heritage confronted the emphasized emotionality and the movement as a fundamental element of artistic expression. Scenes are placed in the real world, Christ and Mary are depicted according to the rules of the secular ruler iconography and rely on graphic templates from popular illustrated Bibles. The group of representatives of the High Baroque include [[Mojsej Subotić]], [[Grigorije Davidović Opšić]], [[Grigorije Jezdimirović]] and [[Lazar Serdanović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=СЛИКАРСТВО ВИСОКОГ БАРОКА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XVIII ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/slikarstvo-visokog-baroka.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence and development of Late Baroque painting had been determined by the cultural and political changes of the time of Joseph II. Conceptual changes in the era of enlightened and learned man - the Enlightenment - marked the last decade of the 18th century. The learned artist, traveling the European capitals of Art, accepts and implements the ideas of the Enlightenment reforms. Among the artists who took Serbian painting of Central European Late Baroque formulation, [[Jakov Orfelin]] and [[Teodor Ilić Češljar]] stand out. They are joined by woodcarvers [[Aksentije Marković]] and [[Marko Vujatović]]. Neoclassicism as the style of the new era, based on the ideas of the Enlightenment, would not jeopardize the ruling Late Baroque conception in the first decades of the next century. Such a sequence is identified in the works of painters [[Stefan Gavrilović]], [[Jovan Isajlović Stari]], [[Georgije Mišković]] and Mihajlo Živković.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=СЛИКАРСТВО КАСНОГ БАРОКА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XVIII ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/slikarstvo-kasnog-baroka.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the important painters were [[Nikola Nešković]], [[Teodor Kračun]], [[Teodor Ilić Češljar]], [[Pavel Đurković]], [[Dimitrije Bačević]], [[Georgije Bakalović]], [[Stefan Gavrilović]], [[Jovan Četirević Grabovan]], [[Jovan Pačić]], and others.

==19th century drawing and painting==

===Religious art===
Printed magazines with engravings became a popular method of communicating through art, of both religious and irreligious themes. The printing of engravings of figures of prominent Serbian rulers fitted in the ideas of continuity of Serbian statehood. Monasteries on Fruška Gora and other ones in the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]] issued engraved magazines in which protector saints with monasteries were represented. Graphical arts of the 18th century were the first class documents of appearance and condition of monastery buildings before photographs. In the last decades of the 18th century, the written word suppressed visual arts as the main communication activity in religious magazines, with graphical arts becoming more and more used in illustrated books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=РЕЛИГИОЗНО СЛИКАРСТВО XIX ВЕКА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/religiozno-slikarstvo-19-veka.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphical arts===
In the first decades of the 19th century a new graphic technique of lithography experience a real boom in the countries of Western Europe. Serbian artists gradually introduced it to the history of national arts in the 19th century. In contrast to modest attempts of scarce individuals, the lithography becomes an important branch of Serbian art only with the emergence of [[Anastas Jovanović]]. Independent printed magazines on religious themes which prevailed in the 18th century became scarcer in the 19th century, only accounting for a part of the graphic production. As a medium very suitable for spreading political ideas, lithography dominates with national-historical themes. Sketch portraits and templates for lithography were dealt by many Serbian painters: [[Jovan Isajlović Mlađi]], [[Jovan Popović (artist)|Jovan Popović]], [[Uroš Knežević]], [[Pavle Simić]], [[Pavle Čortanović]], [[Steva Todorović]], [[Đorđe Krstić]], while being technically performed in Vienna and Pest by lithographers [[Gabriel Decker]] (1821-1855), [[Friedrich Karl Leiboldt]], [[Josef Bauer (lithographer)|Josef Bauer]] (1820-1905), [[Vincent Katzler]] (1823-1882) and others. At the end of the 19th century popular oleographs appear, as the first reproduction of popular works, most often with motifs from folk life and depictions of historical figures and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=ГРАФИКА XIX ВЕКА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/grafika-19-veka.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassicism===
{{further|Neoclassicism}}
Under the influence of the ides of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Rationalism]], at the end of the 18th and beginning of 19th century, Serbian art came to leave baroque pictorial poetics and acceptance of the aesthetic ideals of the [[Vienna Academy of Fine Arts]], characterized by [[eclecticism]] of different stylistic expressions, of the late baroque to neo-classical. In addition to religious painting, which was still dominant, the portrait gains increasing importance. Portraits complete the picture of the new society created in that time and point to the idea of permanent memory of individuals within the family or the wider community. The gallery of characters, in addition to church prelates and priests, senior officers, a significant places is taken by eminent members of civil society from the first decades of the 19th century: lawyers, university professors, writers, wealthy merchants, and their wives, the status shown by marked clothing and jewelry. Stylistic features of paintings of that era: a balanced composition, precise modeling, rigorous academic drawing, color of reduced register, expressed in the works of [[Stefan Gavrilović]], [[Arsa Teodorović]] and [[Pavel Đurković]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=НЕОКЛАСИЦИЗАМ - АРСЕНИЈЕ ТЕОДОРОВИЋ И ПАВЕЛ ЂУРКОВИЋ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/neoklasicizam-arsenije-teodorovic-i-pavel-djurkovic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biedermeier===
{{further|Biedermeier}}
In the 1830s the Serbian art scene is added by a generation of painters who transferred Bidermeier and [[Nazarene movement|Nazarene art]] programs from Central Europe. As a stylistic expression that deeply permeated the Serbian art at that time, Biedermeir was most suitable for the wide layers of citizens that concerned about themselves, their family and home. In the changed social circumstance in which the middle class had become the bearer of social changes, the family becomes the basic unit of modern society and the main scene of private life. Awareness of family is confirmed and visualized in family portraits, in group or of some of its members. Family portraits depict the social status of the family, but at the same time they have a private character and are part of narrow family cult. In addition to portraits, Biedermeir painting is also focused on the [[Genre art]] and [[Still life]]. The most important representatives of the Biedermeier expression in Serbian painting are [[Konstantin Danil]], [[Katarina Ivanović]], [[Dimitrije Avramović]] and [[Nikola Aleksić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=БИДЕРМАЈЕР - КОНСТАНТИН ДАНИЛ И НИКОЛА АЛЕКСИЋ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/bidermajer-konstantin-danil-i-nikola-aleksic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/en/biedermeier.html#&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism===
{{further|Romanticism}}
In the mid-19th century Serbian artistic creativity was marked with reception of content and design of civil works (Biedermaier), but at the same time the development of a program of historicism. For the penetration of Romanticist conceptions, education and stays of Serbian painters in Vienna and Munich, as well as trips to Italy, were crucial. Social and political conditions contributed to the Romantic expression in Serbian art accomplishing its highest achievements in the late 1860s and beginning of 1870s. In stylistic and thematic view, Romanticism brought notable innovations: greater freedom of strokes and composition, warm colors complemented by the play of light and shadow. Most Serbian artists of that period reflected national-historical content in painting compositions, however, client needs kept iconography and portrait painting popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=EПОХА РОМАНТИЗМА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/epoha-romantizma.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of notable Romanticist painters include [[Katarina Ivanović]] (1811–1882), [[Đura Jakšić]] (1832–1878), [[Pavle Simić]] (1818–1876), [[Novak Radonić]] (1826–1890) and [[Steva Todorović]] (1832–1925).

===Historicism===
{{further|Historicism (art)}}
In accordance with the general ideas of Historicism, as the dominant characteristics of the culture of the 19th century in European context, the top role in the process of constituting national identity was held by events and figures from national history. They represented a representative of the golden age of the nation, which in Serbian culture of the 19th century was equated with the period of the rule of the [[Nemanjić dynasty]]. Idealization of a glorious past, regardless of whether it was based on real facts or myth, it was the main tool in the constitution and the homogenization of the nation. This idealized past was directly at the service of the glorification of the present, which emphasized the idea of rebuilding the former Serbian glory. These ideas are directly reflected in the visual art of the epoch - historical compositions, but also patriotic scenes that illustrate the events of the recent past are gaining more and more importance. They praise the nation through the idealization of events and personalities, becoming at the same time engaged means of communication with the aim to awaken national and patriotic feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=ИСТОРИЗАМ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/istorizam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of notable Historicist painters include [[Đura Jakšić]] (1832–1878) and [[Pavle Simić]] (1818–1876).

===Academicism===
{{further|Academic art}}
In the last decades of the 19th century, Serbian painters began to stay at Munich as a center of education and its Academy of Fine Arts, which compared to the Viennese, was more [[avant garde]] and progressive. However, the larger number of them remained faithful to the Vienna Academy where the education system was still based on the constitutional education, traditional practices and technical skills. The highest level of Academicism in Serbian painting of the late 19th century are portraits of [[Paja Jovanović]] (1859–1957) and [[Uroš Predić]] (1857–1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=АКАДЕМИЗАМ - ПАЈА ЈОВАНОВИЋ И УРОШ ПРЕДИЋ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/akademizam-paja-jovanovic-i-uros-predic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalism===
{{further|Orientalism}}
Orientalism indicates interest in Oriental scenes in the visual arts of the 19th century. Napoleon's campaign in Egypt, the conquest of Algeria, as well as travel books and other literary descriptions encouraged the enthusiasm and imagination of artists. Islamic countries of the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa had become the preferred travel destination for many artists. Scenes of squares, bazaars, harem and various folklore events entered European painting. Orientalism rarely had a purely documentary character and more often depicted the enthusiasm of Europeans for beauty, vividness and allure of the unknown and exotic world. The wild nature and unusual customs, combined with the gorgeous colors and light, had become a great inspiration to European artists. During a long period of education, [[Paja Jovanović]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ebritic.com/?p=660281&lt;/ref&gt;along with classes at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, attended the School of historical painting of [[Leopold Müller (painter)]], famous for its oriental motifs. There is no doubt that Miller's crucial lessons determined his painting preference. Noting the increased interest of Europe to the events in the Balkans, he traveled during the holidays to Albania, Montenegro, Dalmatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia gathering sketches and studies of the life of the Balkan peoples. Precisely these themes brought Paja Jovanović worldwide fame and popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=ОРИЈЕНТАЛИЗАМ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/orijentalizam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Realism===
{{further|Realism (art movement)}}
In the last decades of the 19th century, with Serbian painters attending the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, Realism entered the Serbian art scene. In stylistic view, Realists, succeeding the Romantic agitation, brought calm and order in painting. In Serbian painting Realism never took root in the true sense, in the symbiosis of thematics and techniques. Serbian painters, taught artistically to express in a new form, return to be faced with the difficult solvable problems of adapting the conditions of an economically, socially and culturally underdeveloped environment, which was unwilling to accept new social themes which European Realism advocated. Serbian painters therefore continue to paint portraits, religious and historical compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=РЕАЛИЗАМ - ЂОРЂЕ КРСТИЋ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/realizam-djordje-krstic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===
{{further|Symbolism (arts)}}
Symbolism in European painting appeared at the end of the 19th century as a reaction to the beautified world of academic realism and commercialization of art. As a formulated artistic phenomenon on a European scale it was also present at the Munich art scene, where some Serbian painters were formed. Representatives of Symbolism proclaimed turning of indirect, associative and suggestive mode of expression. They used mythological symbols, dreams and imagination as a visual language of the soul. In addition to depicting themselves, they painted mythological, religious and allegorical compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=СИМБОЛИЗАМ - СТЕВАН АЛЕКСИЋ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/simbolizam-stevan-aleksic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern visual arts==
[[Cyril Kutlík]] set up the first school of art in Serbia in 1895. Many of his students went to study in Western Europe, especially France and Germany and brought back avant-garde styles. [[Nadežda Petrović]] was influenced by [[Fauvism]] while [[Sava Šumanović]] worked in [[Cubism]].

After World War I, the [[Belgrade School of Painting]] developed in the [[Belgrade|capital]] with some members such as [[Milan Konjović]] working in a Fauvist manner, while others such as [[Marko Čelebonović]] working in a style called ''Intimisme'' based on the use of colours.

Some artists chose to emigrate: thus [[Yovan Radenkovitch]] (1901–1979) left Belgrade for Paris in the 1930s, befriending [[Matisse]] and [[Vlaminck]] and adopting a style greatly inspired by [[Fauvism]], before eventually leaving Europe to show his work in New York, in 1941; meeting with considerable acclaim, he decided, in the 1950s, to settle in the USA – near [[Waterbury]], [[Connecticut]], where several of his paintings are still kept today, in [[Mattatuck Museum]].

[[Socrealism]] was the dominant school after World War II with the rise to power of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. However, that period did not last long &amp;ndash; during the 1960s, Serbian artists started to break free from the constraints of the Communists led by figures such as [[Petar Lubarda]] and [[Milo Milunović]]. The [[Mediala group]] featuring [[Vladimir Veličković]] was formed in the 1970s to promote [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] figurative painting. Serbian art was split between those basing their works on the traditions of Serbian work such as frescoes and iconography and those exploring international styles.

The first part of 21st century, with young artists like [[Jovanka Sanijenovic]] or [[Simonida Rajčević]], marks a predominance of a figurative art linked to realism – a realism «where everything is real and nothing is real – considering contemporary time as needing a return to what is real and concrete, and at the same time social and existential.&lt;ref&gt;Gordana Biba Marković, ''[http://www.domkulturecacak.org/node/474 XV Prolećni Anale]''. Dom kulture Čačak, 20 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied art and design==
[[File:Pirot kilim serbian rug.png|thumb|100px|Pirot Kilim with the ornament Rašićeva ploča]]
Applied art and design through the centuries have evolved in Serbia through crafts. The wealth of forms, the variety of materials with powerful color schemes and ornamentation folk art represented a strong stimulus for the affirmation of applied art, which in the second half of the 19th century, gets its first artists in Serbia. End of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century were marked by the work of individual personalities, each of them made a significant contribution to the development and the history of applied art in Serbia. These were people of different professions and some of them include: [[Mihailo Valtrović]], [[Vladislav Titelbah]], [[Dragiša Milutinović]], [[Dragutin Inkiostri Medenjak]].

==Performance art==
[[File:artistIsPresent.jpg|thumb|right|Marina Abramović performed "The Artist Is Present" at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in March 2010.]]
[[Maga Magazinović]], philosopher and choreographer, was one of the most important figures of contemporary physical practice in Serbia before the Second World War. The emancipation of the body in her work was realized through the application of gymnastics, dance and physical education. During the '60s and '70s history of the contemporary dance developed in the framework of [[performance art]], [[body art]] and [[happening]]s. On the status of the body can meditate in the works of [[Marina Abramović]] and [[Katalin Ladik]]. The performance art of the eighties was marked by a specific attitude toward ideology. This attitude is manifested in the work within the context of using utopian socialist iconography. During the '90s performance art was focused on the fight against the regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sveske.ba/en/content/drugost-druge-scene-u-srbiji Drugost druge scene u Srbiji]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marina Abramović]] is the most prominent Serbian performance artist.  Active for over three decades, she has been described as the "grandmother of performance art." She pioneered a new notion of identity by bringing in the participation of her observers. Her art focuses on the theme of “confronting pain, blood, and physical limits of the body,” while relying on the extent of these discomforts based on the actions of her audience members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Demaria|first1=Cristina|title=The Performative Body of Marina Abramovic|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|date=August 2004|volume=11|issue=3|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another performance artists include [[Gabrijel Savić Ra]], [[Nela Antonović]], [[Lidija Antonović]], [[Predrag Radovančević]], etc.

'''Straight edge''' (sometimes abbreviated '''sXe''' or signified by '''XXX''' or '''X''') is a [[subculture]] originated from [[hardcore punk]] whose adherents refrain from using [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[tobacco]] and other [[Recreational drug use|recreational drugs]], in reaction to the excesses of [[punk subculture]].&lt;ref name="exclaim"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://exclaim.ca/Features/Research/straight_edge_punk-complicated_contradictions_of_straight |title= The Complicated Contradictions of Straight Edge Punk |author= Sutherland, Sam |date= July 2006 |publisher= [[Exclaim!]] |accessdate= February 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Krist |first= Josh |title= White Punks on Hope |url= http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1996-08-22/music/white-punks-on-hope/2 |accessdate= 22 February 2010 |newspaper= [[Phoenix New Times]] |date= 22 August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, this extends to refraining from engaging in [[Promiscuity|promiscuous sex]], following a [[vegetarian]] or [[vegan]] diet or not using [[caffeine]] or [[prescription drug]]s.&lt;ref name=exclaim/&gt; The term ''straight edge'' was adopted from the 1981 song "[[Straight Edge (song)|Straight Edge]]" by the hardcore punk band [[Minor Threat]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Punk" /&gt;

Straight edge emerged amid the early-1980s hardcore punk scene. Since then, a wide variety of beliefs and ideas have been associated with some members of the movement, including vegetarianism and animal rights.&lt;ref name="Wood (1999) 130-40"&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1999|pp=130–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood1999"&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1999|pp=141–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the commonly expressed aspects of the straight edge subculture have been abstinence from alcohol, nicotine, and illegal drugs, there have been considerable variations on how far to take the interpretations of "abstaining from intoxicants" or "living drug-free". Disagreements often arise as to the primary reasons for living straight edge. Though Straight Edge politics have varied significantly, from explicitly revolutionary to outright conservative, the latter that has mostly dominated, at least in public perception. Left leaning activists have often approached Straight Edge with skepticism, ridicule or even outright hostility in part due to what they perceived as the Straight Edge movement's self-righteous militancy. &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|2010|pp=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/Sober_Living_for_the_Revolution.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, William Tsitsos wrote that straight edge had gone through three eras since its founding in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="wtsitsos" /&gt; [[Bent edge]] began as a counter-movement to straight edge by members of the Washington, D.C. [[Washington, D.C. hardcore|hardcore]] scene who were frustrated by the rigidity and intolerance in the scene.&lt;ref name="Andersen (2003)"&gt;{{harvnb|Andersen|2003|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[youth crew]] era, which started in the mid-1980s, the influence of music on the straight edge scene was at an all-time high. By the early 1990s, militant straight edge was a well-known part of the wider punk scene. In the early to mid-1990s, straight edge spread from the United States to Northern Europe,&lt;ref name="Kuhn 2010 121"&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|2010|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="Kuhn 2010 132"&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|2010|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Middle East,&lt;ref name="Kuhn 2010 112"&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|2010|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and South America.&lt;ref name="Kuhn 2010 66"&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|2010|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of the 2000s, militant straight edge punks had largely left the broader straight edge culture and movement.&lt;ref name="Haenfler (2006)"&gt;{{harvnb|Haenfler|2006|pp= 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1970s and early 1980s===
[[File:Minor-threat-malcolm-riviera.jpg|thumb|[[Minor Threat]], pictured in 1981, coined the term ''straight edge'']]

In the 1970s, the [[punk subculture]] was associated with the use of [[intoxicative inhalant]]s, substances such as [[contact cement|model airplane glue]] that were inhaled for the [[Substance intoxication|intoxicating effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghodse, Hamid. ''Ghodse's Drugs and Addictive Behaviour: A Guide to Treatment''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, William Tsitsos wrote that straight edge had gone through three eras since its founding in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="wtsitsos" /&gt; Later analysts have identified another era that has taken place since Tsitsos's writing.&lt;ref name="Kuhn (2010)"&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|2010|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straight edge grew out of [[hardcore punk]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and was partly characterized by shouted rather than sung vocals.&lt;ref name="haenfler11"&gt;{{harvnb|Haenfler|2006|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straight edge individuals of this early era often associated with the original punk ideals such as individualism, disdain for work and school, and live-for-the-moment attitudes.&lt;ref name="wtsitsos"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsitsos|1999}} {{Page needed|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was influenced by the political and social climate of its origin, around the time of the "Just Say No" campaign and a rise in conservative viewpoints. The discipline of the subculture came from a mix of leftist radicalism and conservative influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haenfler|first=Ross|date=2004|title=Rethinking Subcultural Resistance: Core Values of the Straight Edge Movement|url=|journal=Journal of Contemporary Ethnography|volume=33|pages=406-436|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Straight edge sentiments can be found in songs by the early 1980s band [[Minor Threat]].&lt;ref name="Wood (1999) p. 137-38"&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1999|pp=137–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; This anti-inebriation movement had been developing in punk prior to Minor Threat, but their song "Straight Edge" was influential in giving the scene a name, and something of a (somewhat unwilling) figurehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Azerrad|2001|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minor Threat frontman [[Ian MacKaye]] is often credited with birthing the Straight edge name and movement and in later years has often spoken out about how he never intended it to be a movement.

Straight edge sentiments can also be found in the song "Keep it Clean" by English punk band [[The Vibrators]], and the 1970s [[The Modern Lovers|Modern Lovers]] song "I'm Straight" (which rejected drug use).&lt;ref name="Spin straight edge article"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldfein|1989|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the few prominent 1970s [[hard rock]] icons to explicitly eschew alcohol and drug use, [[Ted Nugent]] was also a key influence on the straight edge ideology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Rollins]] reports that he and friend [[Ian MacKaye]] (vocalist for [[Minor Threat]]) "would read about the Nuge and the thing that really rubbed off on us was the fact that he didn't drink or smoke or do drugs ... [Nugent's performance] was the craziest thing we'd ever seen onstage and here's this guy saying, 'I don't get high.' We thought that was so impressive." {{harv|Azerrad|2001|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Straight edge started on the East Coast of the United States in Washington D.C., and quickly spread throughout the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="tbarlett"&gt;{{harvnb|Barlett|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, bands on the West Coast, such as America's Hardcore, Stalag 13, [[Justice League (band)|Justice League]], and [[Uniform Choice]], were gaining popularity. In the early stages of this subculture's history, concerts often consisted of both punk bands and straight edge bands. Circumstances soon changed and the early 1980s would eventually be viewed as the time "before the two scenes separated".&lt;ref name="haenfler11" /&gt; Early straight edge bands included [[Minor Threat]], [[State of Alert]], [[Government Issue]], [[Teen Idles]], [[The Faith (American band)|The Faith]], [[7 Seconds (band)|7 Seconds]], [[SSD (band)|SSD]], [[DYS (band)|DYS]], and [[Negative FX]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Punk"&gt;{{harvnb|Cogan|2008|p=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blush|2001|pp=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blush|2010|pp=163–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bent edge====
{{Main|Bent edge}}

Bent edge began as a counter-movement to straight edge by members of the Washington, D.C. [[Washington, D.C. hardcore|hardcore]] scene who were frustrated by the rigidity and intolerance in the scene.&lt;ref name="Andersen (2003)"/&gt; This idea spread, and on Minor Threat's first tour in 1982, people would come up to the band to identify themselves as bent, crooked, or curved edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|2010|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counter-movement was short lived and faded away by the end of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Mullaney, Jamie L. "All In Time: Age And The Temporality Of Authenticity In The Straight-Edge Music Scene." Journal of Contemporary Ethnography 41.6 (2012): 611-635. Academic Search Premier. Web. 9 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth crew (mid-1980s)===
[[File:Youth of Today at SO36 (2010) - 2.jpg|thumb|[[Youth of Today]], [[Youth Crew]] pioneers]]
During the [[youth crew]] era, which started in the mid-1980s, the influence of music on the straight edge scene seemed to be at an all-time high. The new branches of straight edge that came about during this era seemed to originate from ideas presented in songs, and many youth crew bands had a strong [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] influence.&lt;ref name="Tsitsos 404"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsitsos|1999|p=404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable youth crew bands included: [[Youth of Today]],&lt;ref name="Tsitsos 404" /&gt; [[Gorilla Biscuits]],&lt;ref name="Tsitsos 404" /&gt; [[Judge (band)|Judge]], [[Bold (band)|Bold]], [[Chain of Strength]], [[Turning Point (U.S. band)|Turning Point]], [[Uniform Choice]], and [[Slapshot (band)|Slapshot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haenfler|2006|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s, the band Youth of Today became associated with the straight edge movement, and their song "Youth Crew" expressed a desire to unite the scene into a movement.&lt;ref name="haenfler12"&gt;{{harvnb|Haenfler|2006|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetarianism became an important theme in straight edge during this era,&lt;ref name="Wood (1999) p. 139"&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1999|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting with Youth of Today's 1988 song "No More", which contained lyrics condemning the consumption of meat.&lt;ref name="youthoftoday"&gt;{{harvnb|Youth of Today|1988}} as cited in {{harvnb|Haenfler|2006|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This catalyzed a trend towards [[animal rights]] and [[veganism]] within the straight edge movement that would reach its peak in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Wood (1999) p. 139" /&gt;

===1990s===
&lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD BANDS THAT HAVE ONE OR TWO MEMBERS WHO ARE EDGE! --&gt;
By the early 1990s, straight edge became a well-known part of the wider punk and DIY scene and underwent musical and political shifts. In the early part of the decade, a number of straight edge punks and their bands picked up on the [[vegetarian]] and other social justice politics of the mid-1980s and began more comprehensively advocating for [[social justice]], [[animal rights|animal liberation]], veganism, and straight edge, itself. During this period, the straight edge scene birthed two major offshoots: the more [[conservative]] [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline]]&lt;ref name="Wood (1999) p. 140"&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1999|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the religiously influenced [[Hare Krishna in popular culture#Straight Edge subculture|Krishna Consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1999|pp=143–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the majority of straight edge punks and Hare Krishna converts were pacifists, those influenced by hardline showed a willingness to resort to violence in order to promote their subculture.&lt;ref name="haenfler88"&gt;{{harvnb|Haenfler|2006|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musically, the straight edge scene was increasingly drawing from [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and was a founding influence on [[metalcore]].

====Outside the United States====
[[File:Xponrx.jpg|thumb|left|140px|The Brazilian vegan straight edge band [[Point of No Return (band)|Point of No Return]] in 2006.]]
In the early to mid-1990s, straight edge spread from the United States to Northern Europe,&lt;ref name="Kuhn 2010 121"/&gt; Eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="Kuhn 2010 132"/&gt; the Middle East,&lt;ref name="Kuhn 2010 112"/&gt; and South America.&lt;ref name="Kuhn 2010 66"/&gt; It grew around the world due to the relentless touring of youth crew bands and the ease of ordering records from American record labels via mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|2010|pp=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fluff Fest]], which has been held in the Czech Republic since 2000 and draws audiences from across Europe, is linked to straight edge through its organizers and showcases prominent straight edge bands.&lt;ref name="Kuhn 137"&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|2010|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
&lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD BANDS THAT HAVE ONE OR TWO MEMBERS WHO ARE EDGE! --&gt;
By the beginning of the 2000s, only small groups of militant straight edge individuals remained.&lt;ref name="Haenfler (2006)"/&gt; Contrary to news reports that portrayed straight edge as a gang,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2003|pp= 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haenfler|2006|p= 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; several studies have shown that straight edge individuals as a whole are mostly peaceful people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2003|p= 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, there was a growing amount of tolerance of people who do not follow the straight edge lifestyle by straight edge individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2003|pp= 46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this incarnation of straight edge, the musical styles of the bands involved are more varied, ranging from a youth crew revival style to [[metalcore]] to [[posicore]].&lt;ref name="Haenfler (2006)" /&gt; Straight edge bands from the 2000s include [[Champion (band)|Champion]], [[Down to Nothing]], [[Embrace Today]], [[Have Heart]], and [[Throwdown (band)|Throwdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haenfler|2006|p= 219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology ==
In the early stages of straight edge, the philosophy was to rebel through self-control. With the ability to control one’s actions would better suit them to stand up against the mainstream. The first wave of straight edge did not impose rules on others, rather participants chose to follow the ways of self-control. With the second wave of straight edge these rules were used to control others. In addition the second wave experienced a change in music style. Where the first wave was influenced by hardcore punk, the second brought in aspects of heavy metal which further pushed for power and control over others. The slowing down of the music reflected the focus of individuals in their journey to self control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsitsos|first=William|date=1999|title=Rules of Rebellion: Slamdancing, Moshing, and the American Alternative Scene|url=|journal=Popular Music|volume=18|pages=397-414|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches ==
While some straight edge groups are treated as a "[[gang]]" by law enforcement officials,&lt;ref name="national geographic special2"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Inside Straight Edge|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/episodes/inside-straight-edge/|accessdate=1 January 2013|series=Inside|network=National Geographic Society|season=|seriesno=|number=|minutes=50|transcript=|quote=|language=|episodelink=|serieslink=|credits=Writer: David Shadrack Smith. Directors: Jim Gaffey and David Shadrack Smith|airdate=9 April 2008|began=|ended=|transcripturl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2006 study found the vast majority of people who identify as straight edge are nonviolent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2006|pp=38, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the early [[Washington, D.C.]] hardcore punk scene is often praised for its commitment to positive social change, both the youth crew movement of the 1980s and the vegan movement of the 1990s have drawn criticism. Straight edge has often been approached with skepticism and hostility, despite the ideologically less dogmatic and more multifaceted character of contemporary straight edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|2010|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== X symbol ==
[[File:ToKill2-stillarbeit.de.jpg|thumb|Italian straight edge band To Kill performing at a club]]
The letter X is the most known symbol of straight edge, and is sometimes worn as a marking on the back of both hands, though it can be displayed on other body parts as well. Some followers of straight edge have also incorporated the symbol into clothing and pins. According to a series of interviews by journalist Michael Azerrad, the straight edge X can be traced to the [[Teen Idles]]' brief West Coast tour in 1980.&lt;ref name="mazerrad"&gt;{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's members were scheduled to play at [[San Francisco]]'s [[Mabuhay Gardens]], but when they arrived, club management discovered that they were all under the legal drinking age and would be denied entry to the club. As a compromise, management marked each of the members' hands with a large black X as a warning to the club's staff not to serve alcohol to the band.

Upon returning to Washington, D.C., the band suggested this same system to local clubs as a means to allow teenagers in to see musical performances without being served alcohol.&lt;ref name="mazerrad" /&gt; The Teen Idles released a record in 1980 called ''[[Minor Disturbance]]'' with the cover shot being two hands with black Xs on the back.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Punk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mark soon became associated with the straight edge lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Punk" /&gt; It can also be used by [[drinking establishment]]s to note a patron as under the drinking age, regardless of their views towards drugs and alcohol.

Later bands used the X symbol on album covers and other paraphernalia in a variety of ways. The cover of ''No Apologies'' by [[Judge (band)|Judge]] shows two crossed [[gavel]]s in the X formation.&lt;ref name="Wood 2006 p.119"&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2006|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other objects that have been used include shovels, baseball bats, and hockey sticks.&lt;ref name="Wood 2006 p.119" /&gt; A variation involving a trio of Xs is often used in flyers and tattoos. It can also be ironic, based on the fact that three Xs was popularized in cartoons and television shows to signify alcohol or poison. [[Moonshine]]rs used an X to note how many times a particular batch of moonshine ran through the still, adding additional irony.&lt;ref name="Re-imagining being 'straight' in straight edge."&gt;{{harvnb|Helton|Staudenmeier|2002|p=445}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is sometimes abbreviated by including an X with the abbreviation of the term "straight edge" to give "sXe".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haenfler|2006|pp=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By analogy, hardcore punk is sometimes abbreviated to "hXc".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hannon|2010|pp=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Veganism ==
By the late 1990s, many straight edge participants gave veganism the same degree of importance as abstinence from intoxicants, and some groups styled themselves "vegan straight edge",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haenfler|2006|pp=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes abbreviated "xVx".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pieslak|2015|pp=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bands such as [[Earth Crisis]] and [[Vegan Reich]] emphasized [[animal rights]] and [[environmentalism]] as social justice issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsitos|2016|pp=205–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps owing to the "DIY" ethic of the punk subculture, some advocated [[direct action]], and became associated with the radical groups [[Animal Liberation Front]] and [[Earth Liberation Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pieslak|2015|pp=177–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California band Vegan Reich is most associated with the [[Hardline (subculture)|"Hardline" subculture]], which espouses the [[sanctity of life]], and draws connections between animal rights and anti-abortion activism.&lt;ref name="Pieslak 2015 183"&gt;{{harvnb|Pieslak|2015|pp=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsitos|2016|pp=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Hardline movement have been described as espousing Old Testament-style spirituality,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsitos|2016|pp=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; militancy, and violence.&lt;ref name="Pieslak 2015 183"/&gt; Violent activism has been described as an "extreme minority" within the vegan straight edge movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helton|Staudenmeier|2002|pp=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haenfler writes that straight edge participants see veganism as an extension of the movement's emphasis on positivity, much like their preference to reserve sex for emotionally meaningful relationships.&lt;ref name="Haenfler 2004 427"&gt;{{harvnb|Haenfler|2004|pp=427}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to focus more on personal responsibility than confronting systemic issues in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haenfler|2004|pp=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, veganism is not seen as a matter of personal purity, but rather is rooted in strong belief in animal rights, and a means of personally rejecting the exploitation of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helton|Staudenmeier|2002|pp=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hold that veganism is "true straight edge", and their promotion of veganism and animal liberation has been described as evangelistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helton|Staudenmeier|2002|pp=452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global communication''' is the term used to describe ways to connect, share, relate and mobilize across geographic, political, economic, social and cultural divides. It redefines soft and hard power as well as information power and diplomacy in ways not considered by traditional theories of [[International relations theory|international relations]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Global Communication implies a transfer of knowledge and ideas from centers of power to peripheries and the imposition of a new intercultural hegemony by means of the "[[soft power]]" of global news and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tehranian|first1=Maijd|title=Global Communication and international relations: changing paradigms and policies|journal=The International Journal of Peace Studies|url=http://www.gmu.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''study of global communication''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies the continuous flows of information used in transferring values, opinions, knowledge, culture across boundaries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=="International" Or "Global"==
With the end of the twentieth century and the turn of a new millennium, the global arena and the field of international communication were undergoing significant changes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some authors started to use the term global communication because it goes beyond the bounds of individual states and emphasizes communication between and among peoples across borders and, importantly, the rise of transnational media corporations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[International communication]] traditionally refers to communication between and among nation-states and connotes issues of national sovereignty, control of national information resources, and the supremacy of national governments.

Nevertheless, earlier International communication theories have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The old theories only explain part of the global picture and the theories of modernization, dependency, and cultural imperialism have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The term "global", implies a declining role of the state and state sovereignty. As a term, "international" has within it notions of bilateral or multilateral decisions. "Global" could be seen as an aspiration, also as a fear, of the weakening of the state. In addition, global may imply something more pervasive, more geographically inclusive than international. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==

The study of global communication increased dramatically after World War II due to military considerations coupled with their economic and political implications. Earlier attempts at theorizing have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

More global communication research was written in the decade from 1945–1955; most of the research of the 1950s dealt with propaganda and the cold war. By 1970, global communication research had grown to include a great variety of subjects, especially comparative mass communication systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |edition=1st |title=The Handbook of Comparative Communication Research |url= |publisher=Routledge |date=2012-03-21 |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-415-80275-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; communication and national development and propaganda and public opinion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frederick |first1=Howard H. |title=Global communication and international relations |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RBsQAQAAMAAJ|isbn=9780534193447 |date=1993-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the point of view of global communication scholars, previous theories of [[Modernization theory|modernization]], dependency, and [[cultural imperialism]] have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication. The old theories only explain part of the global picture.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mcphail |first1=Thomas L. |title=Global Communication Theories, stakeholders, and Trends |date=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Global_Communication.html?id=MAco-KZGZNIC|isbn=9781444358100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological development===
The emergence of global communication technologies may be considered the origin of the field of global communication in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Numerous technical advances such as the creation of a new major global communication phenomenon, [[Telecommunication convergence|convergence]], digital environments and the internet are some of the major engines driving the change from [[international communication]] to global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Global power shifts===
With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union's collapse|Soviet Union]], the shadow of [[Cold War]] has lifted to reveal shifting political, economic, and cultural alliances and conflicts. The increasing importance of these currents, especially in the cultural sphere, demands a reconsideration of the nature of the international communication field within the rubric of international relations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Global Communication in Transition: The End of Diversity?|url = https://www.amazon.com/Global-Communication-Transition-Diversity-Values-ebook/dp/B00YFRD9G6/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450650195&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=global+communication+in+transition|publisher = SAGE Publications, Inc|date = 1996-02-05|first = Hamid|last = Mowlana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News agencies and propaganda===
Three key players are usually recognized as the founders of the international [[News agency|news agencies]]. In 1835, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] created the world's first news agency; In 1849, [[Bernhard Wolff]] started publishing stock market news and daily reports from Paris, London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt; In 1849, [[Paul Reuter|Paul Julius Freiherr von Reuter]] established his own commercial service, the [[Reuters|Reuter]] agency, and organized a worldwide exchange of news in 1870.

In 1859, Reuter, [[Havas]] and the German [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau|Wolff]] agency reached an agreement to exchange news from all over the world, which was known as the League of Allied Agencies, or the " Ring Combination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "The Ring Combination": Information, Power, and the World News Agency Cartel|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YDVlAAAAMAAJ|publisher = University of Chicago, Department of History|date = 1999-01-01|first = Alexander Scott|last = Nalbach}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, [[Associated Press|American News Agency Associated Press]] was founded and was formally admitted into the "Ring Combination" in 1887.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There are some major factors that point to the growing importance of global communication in the world of the twenty-first century:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# world population explosion

# from [[geopolitics]] to [[Gaia philosophy|gaiapolitics]]

# increased [[cross-cultural communication]]
# changing concept of community
# greater [[Centralisation|centralization of control]]
# information explosion
# changes in technologies
# greater dependence on global communication
# greater [[interdependence]] and democracy
# impact of communication on peace and war

== Theoretical approaches and perspectives ==

=== Transcultural political economy ===

Transcultural Political Economy is a concept that is presented in Global Communications by Paula Chakravartty and Yeuzhi Zhao. This concept looks at global communications and media studies in three major areas: global flows of information and culture, decentralizing the conceptual parameters of global information and media studies, and the normative debates in global communications in the context of neoliberalism. Transcultural Political Economy is a multidisciplinary study that focuses on the tensions between political economy and cultural studies. It "integrate[s] institutional and cultural analyzes and address urgent questions in global communications in the context of economic integration, empire formation, and the tensions associated with adapting new privatized technologies, neoliberalized and globalized institutional structures, and hybrid cultural forms and practices". Transcultural Political Economy addresses the issues surrounding the practice of neoliberalism and its creation of unequal power structures within the world system. 
&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty, P. &amp; Zhao, Y. (2008). Global Communications: toward a transcultural political economy. Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Globalization theory ===
{{See also|Globalization}}

Globalization theory was popularized in the 1990s as a model for understanding global communication. The concept of [[globalization]] inspired a number of theories from various schools of thought in communication studies that each emphasize different aspects of [[globalization]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Globalization, development and the mass media |last=Sparks |first=Colin |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7619-6161-1 |location=Thousand Oaks, California |pages=126–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many globalization theories highlight actors in the business sector as leaders in the processes of global integration. Transnationalizing business is often celebrated as progression toward a more interconnected world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Globalization theories are often associated with theories of modernity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some scholars view globalization as the social, political, economic, and cultural integration of societies into a capitalist system; Others see globalization as a successor to modernity, while some see it as an iteration of imperialism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some question the usefulness and legitimacy of globalization theory, arguing that it does not adequately conceptualize current international relations or function as a lens through which to examine everyday events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Globalization Theory: A Post Mortem |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/pal/ip/2005/00000042/00000001/art00002 |journal=International Politics |date=2005-03-01 |pages=2–74 |volume=42 |issue=1 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800098 |first=Justin |last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars criticize globalization theories as overzealous toward and unrealistic about the extent of global integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why the World Isn't Flat in International Politics: Enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last=Ghemawat |first=Pankaj |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-205-77876-8 |location=United States |pages=322–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars criticize social theorists for offering opinions and predictions based on theory with little practical evidence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In contrast, some scholars work to dispute the pessimistic views of globalization theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Art |editor1-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Jervis |editor2-first=Robert |title=International politics: enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last1=Micklethwait |first1=John |last2=Woolridge |first2=Adrian |chapter=Why the Globalization Backlash is Stupid in International Politics |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn= |location=United States |pages=348–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World systems theory ===
World-system theory is a macro-sociological perspective that seeks to explain the dynamics of the "capitalist world economy" as a "total social system". A world-system is what Wallerstein terms a "world-economy", integrated through the market rather than a political centre, in which two or more regions are interdependent with respect to necessities like food, fuel, and two or more polities compete for domination without the emergence of one single centre forever.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfrank, Walter L. (2000). "Paradigm Regained? The Rules of Wallerstein's World-System Method. Journal of World-Systems Research. Vol. 6. N. 2 pp. 150-195&lt;/ref&gt; World-system theory was first articulated by Immanuel Wallerstein. There are three major sources of the world-system theory which conceived by Wallerstein: the Annales school's general methodology, Marx's focus on accumulation process and competitive class struggles and so on, and dependence theory's neo-Marxist explanation of development processes.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Barfield (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=V5dkKYyHclwC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=&amp;redir_esc=y The dictionary of anthropology, Wiley-Blackwell]'', {{ISBN|1-57718-057-7}},&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the transnational division of labor, world-system divides the world into core countries, peripheral countries, semi-peripheral countries and external areas. The core countries usually developed a strong central governments, extensive bureaucracies and large mercenary armies, which permit the local bourgeoisie to obtain control over international commerce and extract capital surpluses from the trade for benefits.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Paul Halsall(1997) [https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/Wallerstein.asp Modern History Sourcebook: ''Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral countries often lack strong central governments or been controlled by core countries, they export raw materials and rely on coercive labor practices.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Semi-peripheries which served as buffers between the core and the peripheries. They retain limited but declining access to international banking and the production of high-cost high-quality manufactured goods.[3] External areas such as Russia maintain their own economic systems, they want to remain outside the modern world economy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Modernisation theory ===

The theory of modernization was developed by Daniel Lerner (1958) in the "Passing of traditional society." Lerner's description of "modernised" is an individual having the ability to be empathetic and being able to see oneself in another person's situation. This concept has come from the transition of traditional societies to modern societies, where modern societies is distinctively industrial, urban, literate, and participant. This theory looks at development in a linear fashion, concluding that nations need to develop into a modern society to make it a sustainable and flourishing nation. Developing modernized societies include technological advancement, and developing media sectors to help create a participatory culture. 
&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, D. (1958). The passing of traditional society: Modernising the Middle East. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-colonialism ===
''See also:'' [[Post-structuralism]], [[imperialism]], [[modernity]],

Post-colonialism is a theoretical approach to looking at literature that examines the colonizer-colonized experience. It deals with the adaptation of formerly colonized nations and their development in cultural, political, economical aspects. Some Notable theoreticians include: [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Edward Said]], [[Gayatri Spivak]], [[R Siva Kumar]], [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]], [[Derek Gregory]].

=== Cultural imperialism ===
Cultural imperialism is a mighty civilization exerts culture influence over another. Less economically prominent cultures often import culture from Western countries, which have the economic means to produce a majority of the world's cultural media, mostly via the global transmission of media.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Ketchum, [http://classroom.synonym.com/meaning-cultural-imperialism-7841.html What Is the Meaning of Cultural Imperialism?]&lt;/ref&gt; The weak civilization adopts the mighty civilization's customs, philosophies, worldviews and general ways of life. The theoretical foundations of the academic study of cultural imperialism mostly come from Michel Foucault's concept of biopower, governmentality and Edward Saïd's concept of Post-colonialism, which theories see cultural imperialism as the cultural legacy of colonialism or forms of Western hegemony. Media effect study which integrated with political-economy traditional is the core argument of cultural imperialism. There are two opposite effects of media study. The negative one is that Western media imposes socio-political conflicts to the developing country and the latter one's resistance to the media effects to preserve their traditional cultural identities.&lt;ref&gt;G. K., &amp; Tan. A.S. (1987), ''American TV in the Philippines: A test of cultural impact''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; The positive effects are the issues of the process of civilization such as women's right or racial equality with exposing to Western media.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, J. G., &amp; Morgan, M. (1988). ''Culture clash: Impact of U.S. television in Korea''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; Now the term of cultural imperialism usually refers to America's global culture expansion to the rest of world, which include brand name products, video media, fast food and so on.

=== Communication for development (C4D) ===
[[Communication for Development|Communication for Development (C4D)]] is a [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] oriented aspect of global communication studies that approaches [[Global Development|global development]] with a focus on action and participation for social change enacted through communication systems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Evaluating Communication for Development: A Framework for Social Change|last = Lennie &amp; Tacchi|first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D underlines "voice, citizenship and collective action" as central values that promote citizen-led development where the visiting party provides guidance rather than direction within the host community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Speaking up and talking back?: Media empowerment and civic engagement among east and southern African youth|last = Tufte, Wildermuth, Hansen-Skovmoes, &amp; Mitullah|first = |publisher = [UNESCO] International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media, Nordicom.|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Göteborg, Sweden|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D often incorporates bottom-up theories of social change with the aim to create sustainable change which is believed to be more likely to occur if the efforts are planned, implemented, and sustained by community members themselves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some development workers and academics suggest that a shared definition of communication for development should be clarified, because disagreement within the field can detract from the characteristics that most scholars view as central to current development, including [[participatory action research]] (PAR).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many C4D projects revolve around media systems as a central site for social change,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which differentiates C4D from other approaches to development. Theories behind C4D highlight that development projects should be contextually situated and that communication technology will affect different types of social change accordingly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Global media studies ===
Global media studies is a field of media study in a global scope. Media study deals with the content, history and effects of media. Media study often draws on theories and methods from the disciplines of cultural studies, rhetoric, philosophy, communication studies, feminist theory, political economy and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan, Daniel and Katz, Elihu (1992). ''Media Events''. London, England: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-55956-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these study approaches, political economic analysis is non-ignorable in understanding the current media and communication developments. But the political economic research has become more resilient because of stronger empirical studies, and the potential connections to policy-making and alternative praxis.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Wasko (2009). Global Media Studies. Television &amp; New Media. Volume 10 Number 1 January 2009 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country has its own distinct media ecosystem. The media of mainland China is state-run, so the political subjects are under the strict regulations set by the government while other areas such as sports, finance, and increasingly lucrative entertainment industry face less regulation from government.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cfr.org/about/ Council on Foreign Relations.]''&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has a well-developed media sector, but the mass media is threatened by the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism which hinder the form of Canada's media identity.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, John A. (1969). ''Mass Media in Canada''. The Ryerson Press. p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the media in America are controlled by large for-profit corporations who reap revenues from advertisings, subscriptions and the sale of copyrighted materials. Currently, six corporations (Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, News Corporation, Time Warner, Viacom and CBS Corporation) have controlled roughly 90% of the America media.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Lutz (2012) ''[http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6 These 6 Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America.]'' Business Insider. 14 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Such successes come from the policies of the federal government or the tendency to natural monopolies in the industry.

== Central debates ==

=== Global power shifts ===

[[Frog#Locomotion|Immanuel Wallerstein]]'s world system theory develops a basic framework to understand global power shifts in the rise of the modern world. Wallerstein proposes four different categories: '''core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external''', in terms of different region's relative position in the world system. The core regions are the ones that benefited the most from the capitalist world economy, such as England and France. The peripheral areas relied on and exported raw materials to the core, such as Eastern Europe and Latin America. The semi-peripheries are either core regions in decline or peripheries attempting to improve their relative position in the world system, such as Portugal and Spain. The external areas managed to remain outside the modern world economy, such as Russia.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/wallerstein_summary.php/ Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic types of global power shifts in the 21st century. One is traditional power transition amongst states, which follows Wallerstein's world system theory. For instance, the global power shifts from the West to the East since the rise of Asia. The other is power diffusion, the way that power move from states to non-states actors. For instance, "climate change, drug trade, financial flows, pandemics, all these things that cross borders outsider the control of governments."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/joseph_nye_on_global_power_shifts/transcript?language=en#t-832180/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global public sphere ===
[[Public sphere]] theory, attributed to [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]], is a theory that in its basic premise conceives of [[democratic governments]] as those that can stand criticism that comes from public spheres. [[Public sphere]]s are places, physical or imagined, where people discuss any kind of topic, particularly topics of a societal or political nature. Global public sphere is, therefore, a public that is made of people from across the globe, who come together to discuss and act on issues that concern them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of global public sphere is linked to the shift of public sphere, from restricted to nation-state, to made of individuals and groups connected across as well as within borders.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Plato, it can be argued that philosophers have been thinking about versions of a common space for all people to debate in; however, a global public sphere that can fit the description above began to appear much later. In the second half of the 20th century, the legacy of World War II and technological advancements created a new sense of the global and started the economic and political phenomena that we now call [[globalization]]. This includes the expansion of humankind into space, which gave individuals the sense of a global unity, the growth of satellite technology, which allowed for people across the globe to view the same television channels, and the internet, which can provide access to an unprecedented amount of information and spaces to connect with other people.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Cultural industries ===
The term "[[culture industry]]" appeared in the [[post-war period]]. At that time, culture and industry were argued to be opposites.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unctad.org/en/Docs/ditctab20103_en.pdf|title = Creative Economy 2010 Report|date = 2010|publisher = UNCTAD}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural industry|Cultural industries]]" are also referred to as the "[[Creative industries]].

==== Definitions and scope of cultural industries ====

In the present day, there remain different interpretations of culture as an industry. For some, cultural industries are simply those industries that produce cultural goods and services.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), the cultural industries are regarded as those industries that "combine the creation, production and commercialization of contents which are intangible and cultural in nature. These contents are typically protected by copyright and they can take the form of goods or services". According to [[UNESCO]], an essential part of cultural industries is that they are "central in promoting and maintaining cultural diversity and in ensuring democratic access to culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.unesco.org/themes/protecting-our-heritage-and-fostering-creativity |title=Protecting Our Heritage and Fostering Creativity |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cultural industries" combines the cultural and economic, which gives the cultural industries a distinctive profile.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In France, the "cultural industries" have recently been defined as a set of economic activities that combine the functions of conception, creation and production of culture with more industrial functions in the large-scale manufacture and commercialization cultural products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/Politiques-ministerielles/Etudes-et-statistiques|title = de la prospective et des statistiques|last = |first = |date = 2006|journal = Département des études|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, economic activities involved in the preservation of heritage are also included in the definition of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/87-542-x/2011001/section/s3-eng.htm|title=Defining culture|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global cultural industries ====
Since the rise of the cultural industries has occurred simultaneously with [[economic globalization]], cultural industries have close connections with globalization and global communication.

[[Herbert Schiller]] argued that the 'entertainment, communications and information (ECI) complex were having a direct impact on culture and human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Culture Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science Press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Herbert Schiller|Schiller]] argued, the result of transnational corporate expansion is the perpetuation of [[cultural imperialism]], defined as "the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Cultural Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second wave of transnational corporate expansion, which began in the 1970s with the emergence of [[Free trade zone|Export Processing Zones]] in developing countries, is focused on the development of [[global production networks]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Creative Industries|last=Flew|first=Terry|publisher=Polity Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-7456-4839-2|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=19–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was described as a "new international division of labour" (NIDL) by the German political economists Frӧbel et al. (1980).

Ernst and Kim have argued that GPNs are changing the nature of the multinational corporation itself, from "stand alone overseas investment projects, to "global network [[flagship]]s" that integrate their dispersed supply, knowledge and customer bases into global and regional production networks", entailing a shift from top-down hierarchical models of corporate control to increasingly networked and collective forms of organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Production Networks, Knowledge Diffusion, and Local Capacity Formation|last = Ernst |first=D. |last2=Kim |first2=L. |date = 2002|journal = Research Policy |volume=31|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global media empires ====
The largest firms in media and media-related industries have a very high international profile.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Global media empires such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[News Corporation]], [[Time Warner|Time-Warner]] and [[Viacom]]-[[CBS]] now derive 25-45 per cent of their revenues outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding Global Media|last = Flew.T|first = |publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Basingstoke, UK|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often argued that the global media are dominated by a small number of powerful media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. Herman and McChesney (1997) argued that the global media were "dominated by three or four dozen large [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporations]] (TNCs) with fewer than ten mostly US-based media conglomerates towering over the global market."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Global Media: The New Missionaries of Global Capitalism|last = Herman,E.S &amp; McChesney, R.W|first = |publisher = Cassell|year = 1997|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Manfred Steger]] has observed that " to a very large extent, the global cultural flows of our time are generated and directed by global media empires that rely on powerful communication technologies to spread their message."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last = Steger.M|first = |publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2003|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that during the last two decades, a few very large TNCs would come to dominate the global market for entertainment, news, television, and film.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Diaspora ===
[[Diaspora]] is often confused with [[wikt:exodus|exodus]]. Diasporas are minority groups that have a sense of connection with a larger community outside of the borders they currently inhabit, and through diasporic media create a sense of a larger identity and community, whether imagined or real.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In scholarly work about diaspora in communication studies, the view of nation and culture as interchangeable terms is no longer prevalent. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] theorized of hybridity, which he distinguished from "old style pluralism", "nomadic voyaging of the postmodern", and "global homogenization". Hybridity is the retention of an original identity and strong ties to an original country and tradition, but with the understanding that there is no unchanged, ideal nation of the past that they can return to. To be hybrid is to also adapt to a new culture and tradition without simply assimilating in it, but rather negotiating a place between the "original" and "new" cultures.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In Communication studies, diaspora is discussed as the identity that unifies people across time and space, sometimes existing in physical spaces and other times existing in imagined 'non-spaces'. However, it has been argued that the concept of 'diaspora' implies ethnic homogeneity and essentializes identity to only ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; One of the most cited and well-known works in the field of diasporic media is [[Hamid Naficy]]'s work on exiled Iranian Americans' creation of cable television in the United States.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Diasporic media refer to media that address the needs of particular ethnic, religious, and/or linguistic groups that live in multicultural settings {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . Diasporic media can be in the diaspora's traditional language or in another language, and they can include news or media from the "origin" country or they can contain the diaspora's local news or media. Diasporic media can be created in radio, television, film, music, in newspapers, magazines, and other publishing, as well as online. It can be argued that the development and spread of satellite television is an instrumental element of the growth of diasporic media today. Satellite television allowed migrants to access the news and popular culture from their homeland, as well as allowing people who speak the same language to access the same channels that might be produced outside of the "homeland"&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Diasporic Media Across Europe: Multicultural Societies and the Universalism–Particularism Continuum|journal = Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies|pages = 481–498|volume = 31|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/13691830500058794|first = Myria|last = Georgiou|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary studies of diaspora show that diasporic media are part of the change in the tendency Immanuel Wallerstein described in his world systems theory. The world systems theory postulates that much of the flow of people in the world has been from the 'periphery', or economically-developing states, towards the centre; which are often metropolitan, economically-wealthy states that grew their wealth in colonialist entrepreneurship. However, contrary to the movement of people, the flow of information (including media products), has tended to be from the centre to the periphery.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Go with the Flow: Diasporas and Media|last = Sinclair|first = John|date = February 2000|journal = Television &amp; New Media|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Cunningham|first2 = Stuart|issue = 1:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology and media ===
The advancement of media and technology have played the pivotal role in process of [[globalization]] and global communication.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding the media|last = Devereux|first = Eoin|publisher = SAGE|year = 2007|isbn = 9781412929912|location = London, Los Angeles|pages = 28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cable television]], [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]], [[digitalization]], direct broadcast [[satellite]]s as well as the [[Internet]] have created a situation where vast amounts of information can be transferred around the globe in a matter of seconds.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

During the early 20th century, [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], [[telephony]], and [[radio]] started the process of global communication.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Media, Historic Development of|last = Monroe|first = E. Price|date = 2003|journal = Encyclopedia of International Media and Communications, Volume 2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As media technologies developed intensely, they were thought to create, in Marshall McLuhan’ s famous words, a ‘‘global village.’’&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]], the world’ s first [[artificial satellite]], on October 4, 1957, marked the beginning of technologies that would further interconnect the world.  The first live global television broadcast occurred when [[Neil Armstrong]] stepped onto the moon in July 1969.  In November 1972, pay TV caused expansion of cable when [[Service Electric]] offered Home Box Office over its cable system. By 2000, over direct broadcast satellite, a household could receive channels from all over the world. Now with the [[World Wide Web]], [[Smartphone|smart phones]], [[Tablet computer|tablet devices]], smart televisions and other digital media devices, billions of people are now able to access media content that was once tied to particular communications media ([[Input/output|print]], broadcast) or platforms ([[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[radio]], [[television]], [[Film|cinema]]).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Justice ===
Justice in communication studies includes, but is not limited to, the concern with democratic process and fostering democratic publics  {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]] theorized of [[public sphere]] (in ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'') as the space that is created whenever matters of common concern are discussed between the state and civil society. Thus, public sphere includes not only the media, but also public protest in the form of marches, demonstrations, et cetera. There are, however, critiques of political economy in whose view it is impossible to work within the current system to produce democratic publics. Such a critique is that produced by [[Karl Marx]], who saw institutions such as parliament, the state, the 'acceptable' public sphere, economic enterprises, and so on as structurally produced and perpetuated by a capitalist system, and thus they can not be mobilized to change it. In such a system, there can only be illusory justice, which is fair only within the logic of the system. This illusion of justice is produced through dominating [[ideology]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Justice and Communication: Mill, Marx, and Habermas|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|journal = Social Justice Research|date = 2009-02-19|issn = 0885-7466|pages = 134–155|volume = 22|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|language = en|first = Martin|last = Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue of justice in communication studies is the question of decolonizing research methods and theoretical discourse {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . The idea of decolonizing research comes from a rejection of the functionalist approach, which assumed that research can be conducted in a vacuum, free of ideology or the researcher's biases. This approach assumed cultures to be unchanging, homogenous, and isolated from each other. The purpose of decolonizing research and discourse is to 'uncloak' research as an unbiased power structure, and produce research that is more self-aware. The approach in decolonizing research methods attempts to create methodologies that treat the people in the study as participants or partners, rather than subjects - which is a term that in itself carries strong connotations of colonialism. Decolonizing research also involves moving away from Eurocentric models that are assumed to work anywhere else, and instead to create work that is more useful in local contexts. Decolonial approaches specifically seek to produce knowledge about the mechanisms and effects of colonialism. These approaches allow former subjects to 'talk back', which is a reflection of independent agency, on the colonizer's own terms of research, rather than to be 'given' a voice, which is an unequal power structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decolonial Methodologies: Social Justice Perspectives in Intercultural Technical Communication Research|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2190/TW.44.3.e|journal = Journal of Technical Writing and Communication|pages = 297–327|volume = 44|issue = 3|doi = 10.2190/tw.44.3.e|first = Godwin Y.|last = Agboka|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
''Sweet Hope'' (2011), an award-winning [[historical novel]] by [[Mary Bucci Bush]], tells the story of Italian immigrants living in [[Peon|peonage]] on a [[Mississippi Delta]] cotton plantation in the early 1900s. It was inspired by the experiences of Bush's grandmother, Pasquina Fratini Galavotti, who worked on the [[Sunnyside Plantation]] in Arkansas as a child. 

== Plot ==
&lt;!--
     TO DO: Expand this section 
--&gt;
Two families develop an uneasy friendship while eking out a living on a cotton plantation named Sweet Hope. The Pascalas are Italian immigrants working as [[Indentured servitude|indentured]] laborers; the Halls are African-American [[sharecroppers]]. Like the other workers at Sweet Hope, the Pascalas and the Halls face disease, poverty, and a dangerous manager. The black sharecroppers help the Italians learn English and survive in an unfamiliar climate.&lt;ref name="ruvoli" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pw" /&gt;

The Pascalas are paid in [[company scrip]] and forbidden to leave the plantation until their debt is worked off. Having arrived too late in the year to start a crop, they keep falling further into debt. After attempting to negotiate with management for better conditions, the Italians organize against the plantation company. When the sharecroppers stand up for the Italians, it triggers "a tragic chain of events that implicates individuals, families, company, town, and the justice system."&lt;ref name="ruvoli" /&gt;

== Background ==

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, thousands of Italians were lured to the [[American South]] to work on plantations and in factories, where they were often exploited. In 1907, the U.S. Department of Justice appointed [[Mary Grace Quackenbos]] to investigate complaints that workers in the South were being held in peonage. A major focus of the investigation was Sunnyside, a cotton plantation in Arkansas.&lt;ref name="bucci-background"&gt;{{cite web |website=MaryBucciBush.com |title=Story Behind Sweet Hope |url=http://www.marybuccibush.com/story-behind-sweet-hope |accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Mary Bucci Bush heard many stories about the Sunnyside plantation from her grandmother and great aunt, who had worked there as children. ''Sweet Hope'' was inspired by their accounts. In the 1970s, Bush began recording interviews with her grandmother. In the late 1980s she spent several weeks camping out on the Sunnyside site, interviewing survivors and descendants of plantation workers.&lt;ref name="vernon" /&gt; Over the years she made several more trips to the area. On one of them, she happened to meet the historian Randolph Boehm, who was researching a biography of Quackenbos. Boehm introduced Bush to Ernesto Milani, who was researching Sunnyside from the perspective of the Italian government. The three writers shared their research and lectured together at conferences.&lt;ref name="bucci-background" /&gt;

Although Bush is careful to note that ''Sweet Hope'' is a work of fiction, she dedicated it to "all the inhabitants of Sunnyside Plantation, Italian and African American, whose voices were never heard and whose stories were never told."&lt;ref name="bucci-background" /&gt;

== Publication history ==

After years of research and revision, Bush spent several more years trying to find a publisher for her novel. She was told the market for historical fiction was small. Another reason, she suggested in an interview, was a lack of interest in the stories of Italian Americans other than mobsters.&lt;ref name="vernon" /&gt;

The novel was published by a Canadian press, Guernica Editions, in 2011. Excerpts have appeared in literary journals such as ''Syracuse University Magazine'' (1990) and ''Fili D'Aquilone'' (in Italian, 2016);&lt;ref name="francavilla"&gt;{{cite web |website=Fili D'Aquilone |last1=Francavilla |first1=Manuela |title=Amicizie Italo-Afroamericane: Un Racconto di Mary Bucci Bush |date=2016 |url=http://www.filidaquilone.it/num042francavilla.html |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in anthologies, including [[Mary Jo Bona]]'s ''The Voices We Carry: Recent Italian American Women's Fiction'' (2007), [[Anthony Tamburri]]'s ''From the Margin: Writings in Italian Americana'' (2000), [[Maria Mazziotti Gillan]]'s ''Growing Up Ethnic in America'' (1999), and [[Terry Wolverton]]'s ''HERS 2: Brilliant New Fiction by Lesbian Writers'' (1997).&lt;ref name="bush"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bush |first1=Mary Bucci |title=Sweet Hope |publisher=Guernica Editions |date=2011 |isbn=9781550713428 |page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

''Sweet Hope'' won the [[Tillie Olsen]] Book Prize from the [[Working Class Studies Association]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="wcsa"&gt;{{cite web |website=Working Class Studies Association |title=Previous WCSA Award Winners |url=https://wcstudiesassociation.wordpress.com/awards-history/ |accessdate=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a finalist for [[Binghamton University]]'s John Gardner Book Award and the 2012 Paterson Fiction Prize.&lt;ref name="iawa"&gt;{{cite web |website=Italian American Writers Association |title=IAWA Newsletter |date=September 2012 |accessdate=December 18, 2017 |url=http://www.iawa.net/september2012.pdf |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012 it was the subject of a panel discussion at the annual conference of the Italian American Studies Association.&lt;ref name="mccormick"&gt;{{cite web |website=Kathleen Z. McCormick |title=Academic Writing |accessdate=December 17, 2017 |url=https://www.kathleenzmccormick.com/academic-writing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

While not widely reviewed, the book has been praised by several critics. Thom Vernon of the ''[[Arkansas Review]]'' classes ''Sweet Hope'' with [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'', [[Rebecca Harding Davis]]'s ''[[Life in the Iron Mills]]'', [[Pietro Di Donato]]'s ''[[Christ in Concrete]]'', and other notable works that give voice to the working poor.&lt;ref name="vernon"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vernon |first1=Thom |title=Sweet Hope in Delta: An Interview with Mary Bucci Bush on Italians, African Americans, and Ghosts |journal=Arkansas Review |volume=43 |issue=3 |date=2012 |pages=181-195 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/interviews/85349525/sweet-hope-delta-interview-mary-bucci-bush-italians-african-americans-ghosts-sunnyside-plantation}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' calls the book "thoroughly researched and engaging."&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;{{cite web |website=Publishers Weekly |title=Sweet Hope |accessdate=December 17, 2017 |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-55071-342-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Italian Americana]]'', UCLA professor Joanne Ruvoli writes, "This heartbreaking historical novel makes an important contribution to the story of Italian Americans in the United States."&lt;ref name="ruvoli"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruvoli |first1=Joanne |title=Reviewed Work: ''Sweet Hope'' by Mary Bucci Bush |journal=Italian Americana |volume=31 |issue=1 |date=2013 |pages=112-113 |jstor=41932500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Also, Kenneth Scambray reviewed it in L'Italo Americano'' but I've only seen references to the review, not the actual review. --&gt;

[[File:Bern Nationalbibliothek Sammlung-9.jpg|thumb|The Swiss Literary Archives, at the [[Swiss National Library]].]]

The '''Swiss Literary Archives''' (SLA - ''Schweizerische Literaturarchiv'') in [[Bern]] collects [[literary estate]]s in all four national languages of [[Switzerland]] ([[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Romansh language]]). It is part of the [[Swiss National Library]] operated by the [[Federal Office of Culture]] within the [[Federal Department of Home Affairs]].

The archives were founded in 1991 and are located in the building of the [[Swiss National Library]]. The foundation can be tracked back to the last will of the writer [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], who died in 1989. Dürrenmatt gave his literary remains to the state, but under the condition that the state establishes a national archive for literature. 

The Swiss Literary Archives today contain around 100 important literary estates and premortal-estates and about 120 partial estates and collections, including material from:

'''Teen dating violence''' is the [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], or [[psychological abuse|psychological]] / [[emotional abuse|emotional]] [[abuse]] (or [[violence]]) within a dating relationship among adolescents.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web | last = CDC | author-link = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | title = Teen dating violence | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date = June 29, 2015 | accessdate = November 15, 2015 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/teen_dating_violence.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Intimate partner violence]] (IPV) has been a well examined and documented phenomenon in adults; however, there has not been nearly as much study on violence in adolescent dating relationships, and it is therefore not as well understood. The research has mainly focused on Caucasian youth, and there are yet no studies which focus specifically on IPV in adolescent same-sex romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Chu | first1 = Ann T. | last2 = Sundermann | first2 = Jane M. | last3 = DePrince | first3 = Anne P. | contribution = Intimate partner violence in adolescent romantic relationships | editor-last1 = Donohue | editor-first1 = William T. | editor-last2 = Benuto | editor-first2 = Lorraine T. | editor-last3 = Woodward Tolle | editor-first3 = Lauren | title = Handbook of adolescent health psychology | page = 193 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | location = New York, New York | year = 2013 | isbn = 9781461466338 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=KX29BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intimate partner violence (IPV) in adolescents is an important realm of study as, in addition to the usual negative effects of abuse, this violence occurs at a critical period in the social and mental development of a person.  This is also an important topic from a [[gender studies]] perspective as almost 32% of male adolescents engage in some form of violence, whether sexual, physical or emotional, towards their partners while adolescent violence from females is nearly half of that rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bachman | first1 = Ronet | last2 = Peralta | first2 = Robert | title = The relationship between drinking and violence in an adolescent population: does gender matter? | journal = [[Deviant Behavior (journal)|Deviant Behavior]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–19 | doi = 10.1080/016396202317192008 | date = January 2002 | ref = harv }} [http://www3.uakron.edu/publications/relationshiprp.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the United States public health authority, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), "[a]dolescents and adults are often unaware that teens experience dating violence."&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

==Gender differences==
{{see also|Domestic violence#Gender differences}}
The literature on IPV among adolescents indicates that the rates are similar for the number of girls and boys in heterosexual relationships who report experiencing IPV, or that girls in heterosexual relationships are more likely than their male counterparts to report perpetrating IPV.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Knox | first1 = Lyndee | last2 = Lomonaco | first2 = Carmela | last3 = Alpert | first3 = Elaine | contribution = Adolescent relationship violence | editor-last1 = Mitchell | editor-first1 = Connie | editor-last2 = Anglin | editor-first2 = Deirdre | title = Intimate partner violence: a health-based perspective | pages = 514, 516 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = Oxford New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780199720729 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q04QO7UmyowC&amp;pg=PA514 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Jessica R. | last2 = Ghandour | first2 = Reem M. | last3 = Kub | first3 = Joan E. | title = Female perpetration of violence in heterosexual intimate relationships: adolescence through adulthood | journal = [[Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse]] | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 227–249 | doi = 10.1177/1524838008324418 | pmc = 2663360 | date = October 2008 | ref = harv | pmid=18936281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ely et al. stated that, unlike domestic violence in general, equal rates of IPV perpetration is a unique characteristic with regard adolescent dating violence, and that this is "perhaps because the period of adolescence, a special developmental state, is accompanied by sexual characteristics that are distinctly different from the characteristics of adult."&lt;ref name="Rapp-Paglicci"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Ely | first1 = Gretchen | last2 = Dulmus | first2 = Catherine N. | last3 = Wodarski | first3 = John S. | contribution = Adolescent dating violence | editor-last1 = Rapp-Paglicci | editor-first1 = Lisa A. | editor-last2 = Roberts | editor-first2 = Albert R. | editor-last3 = Wodarski | editor-first3 = John S. | title = Handbook of violence | page = 36 | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780471214441 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=YtOvUULaNZEC&amp;pg=PA36 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Wekerle and Wolfe theorized that "a mutually coercive and violent dynamic may form during adolescence, a time when males and females are more equal on a physical level" and that this "physical equality allows girls to assert more power through physical violence than is possible for an adult female attacked by a fully physically mature man."&lt;ref name="Rapp-Paglicci"/&gt;

Regarding studies that indicate that girls are as likely or more likely than boys to commit IPV, the authors emphasize that substantial differences exist between the genders, including that girls are significantly more likely than boys to report having experienced severe IPV, such as being threatened with a weapon, punched, strangled, beaten, burned, or raped, and are also substantially more likely than boys to need  psychological help or experience physical injuries that require medical help for the abuse, and to report sexual violence as a part of dating violence. They are also more likely to take IPV more seriously. By contrast, boys are more likely to report experiencing less severe acts, such as being pinched, slapped, scratched or kicked. Girls are more likely to report committing less serious forms of IPV, including as a means of self-defense, whereas boys are more likely to report committing more severe acts of IPV, including threats, physical violence and controlling a partner.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; That girls are more likely to engage in IPV as a result of self-defense is supported by findings that previous victimization is a stronger predictor of perpetration in females than in males.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{citation | last1 = Edwards | first1 = Katie M. | last2 = Dardis | first2 = Christina M. | last3 = Gidycz | first3 = Christine A. | contribution = The role of victimization experiences in adolescent girls and young women's aggression in dating relationships | editor-last = Paludi | editor-first = Michele A. | title = The psychology of teen violence and victimization, volume 2, Part I. Impact of teen violence on adolescents, family, and peers | pages = 71–82 | publisher = Praeger | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780313393761 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research indicates that boys who have been abused in childhood by a family member are more prone to IPV perpetration, while girls who have been abused in childhood by a family member are prone to lack empathy and [[self-efficacy]]; but the risks for the likelihood of IPV perpetration and victimization among adolescents vary and are not well understood.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;

==Controversies and arguments==
There is a common misconception that aggression is stable over time. That is, young people who are labeled as or considered to be violent and aggressive at any point in time are then assumed to be dangerous for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Loeber | first1 = Rolf | last2 = Stouthamer-Loeber | first2 = Magda | title = Development of juvenile aggression and violence: some common misconceptions and controversies | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 242–259 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.242 | pmid = 9491750 | date = February 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a contentious issue because there is a desire to protect both parties involved (or that have the potential to become involved) in teen dating violence. While classifying the perpetrator as a threat may be detrimental to his or her life and future relationships, not classifying the perpetrator this way may put future partners at risk.

There is considerable debate over whether we as a society have an accurate picture of the prevalence and severity of teen dating violence by gender. It is important to note that although male and female adolescents do not differ in "overall frequency of violence in dating relationships," females are subject to "significantly higher levels of severe violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Molidor | first1 = Christian | last2 = Tolman | first2 = Richard M. | title = Gender and contextual factors in adolescent dating violence | journal = [[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–194 | doi = 10.1177/1077801298004002004 | pmid = 12295440 | date = April 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact begs the question of whether abuse should be evaluated based on “severity” and how that can and should be measured, or if all abuse should be considered equally harmful.

[[Age of consent]] is an issue that cannot be ignored in the discussion of teenage dating violence. Teenage sex is regulated in such a way that "age of consent laws render teenagers below a certain age incapable of consent to sexual activity with adults, and sometimes with peers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sutherland | first = Kate | title = From jailbird to jailbait: age of consent laws and the construction of teenage sexualities | journal = [[William &amp; Mary Law School#Law journals|William &amp; Mary Journal of Women and the Law]] | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–349 | ssrn = 1586883 | date = Spring 2003 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/wmjwl9&amp;div=20 | ref = harv }} [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1167&amp;context=wmjowl Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the adult may be just a few months older than the minor. There are a number of states in which "age of consent statutes are used to prosecute consensual sex between two persons both under the age of consent." This type of prosecution has been deemed unconstitutional in some states by citing violation of privacy rights, but remains in effect in other states. Sexual behavior and aggression can be so deeply intertwined that the legality of underage consensual sex is sure to have an effect on teen dating violence.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Nature vs. nurture==
{{OR section|date=September 2015}}
Significant research has been done on the causes behind violent behavior in adolescent dating relationships with the intention of guiding the creation of dating violence prevention programs, and in turn has provided findings on the roles of nature and nurture in the development of such behavior with a strong favor towards nurture factors. A study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health examined the potential association between a spectrum of childhood adverse experiences and physical violence in relationships before age 21 for both members. The subjects were asked questions about violence in their adolescent relationships, as either victim or perpetrator, and their childhood surrounding twelve different adversities: parental death, parental divorce, long-term separation from parent, parental mental illness, parental substance abuse disorder, parental criminality, inter-parental violence, serious physical illness in childhood, physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, and family economic adversity. The results demonstrated a strong positive correlation between ten out of the twelve childhood adversities and physically violent behavior in a teen relationship, with 13.8% responding with experiences of sexual violence, and 11.6% experiencing inter-parental violence. This points to a strong influence of experience, or nature, on violent tendencies in adolescent relationships. Multiple other studies corroborate these findings, citing childhood bullying, assault, and maltreatment as significant indicators for future violence in adolescent dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Elizabeth | last2 = Breslau | first2 = Joshua | last3 = Chung | first3 = W.J. Joanie | last4 = Green | first4 = Jennifer Greif | last5 = McLaughlin | first5 = Katie A. | last6 = Kessler | first6 = Ronald C. | title = Adverse childhood experiences and risk of physical violence in adolescent dating relationships | journal = [[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]] | volume = 65 | issue = 11 | pages = 1006–1013 | doi = 10.1136/jech.2009.105429 | pmid = 21321063 | date = November 2011 | ref = harv | pmc=3686487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there has been little explicit study of the relationship between nature and teen dating violence, there has been proven correlation between testosterone levels and violent tendencies that could come to fruition in adolescent dating relationships. Higher testosterone levels “manifests itself in various intensities and forms from; thoughts, anger, verbal aggressiveness, competition, dominance behavior, to physical violence.”  A study published in the International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism reported, “Testosterone plays a significant role in the arousal of these behavioral manifestations in the brain centers involved in aggression and on the development of the muscular system that enables their realization. There is evidence that testosterone levels are higher in individuals with aggressive behavior, such as prisoners who have committed violent crimes.” However, the study also noted that many cases of high testosterone levels are disarmed through socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Batrinos | first = Menelaos L. | title = Testosterone and aggressive behavior in man | journal = International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 563–568 | doi = 10.5812/ijem.3661 | pmc = 3693622 | date = June 2012 | ref = harv | pmid=23843821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, because children are exposed to relationships early in their life through their parents and being so malleable at a young age, most evidence points to an adverse experience or experiences in childhood as fodder for such behavior in adolescence.

==Prevalence and approaches==
The literature on IPV among adolescents primarily focuses on Caucasian youth, and there are yet no studies which focus specifically on IPV in adolescent same-sex romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;

====Statistics====
While dating, domestic and sexual violence affect women regardless of their age, teens and young women are especially vulnerable.

A survey conducted by Teenage Research Unlimited stated that "[10] percent of teens have been threatened physically via e-mail, IM, text messaging, chat rooms, etc."

A 2008 [[meta-analysis]], which examined 62 [[empirical research]] studies between 1996 and 2006, relating to domestic violence in heterosexual intimate relationships from adolescence through to adulthood in the United States, reported on research findings that consistently show that adolescent females commit significantly more acts of domestic violence in intimate relationships than adolescent males. It stated, however, that the "data also suggest that females who commit acts of domestic violence may experience more violent or frequent IPV victimization than males" and that "[t]he highest rates [for female-perpetrated IPV] were found for emotional violence, followed by physical and sexual violence. Prevalence rates varied widely within each population, most likely due to methodological and sampling differences across studies." The authors added, "Few longitudinal studies existed, limiting the extent to which we could identify developmental patterns associated with female perpetrated intimate partner violence." They found a few studies which reported prevalence rates of IPV perpetration among females at two or more time points, which they stated made "it difficult to obtain a clear picture of the developmental patterns associated with this type of violence." There was also only one study that reported on prevalence rates over time for female perpetrated IPV among adolescents. "This study found a significant increase in prevalence over a six month period; however, they measured lifetime perpetration of IPV, therefore, it is unclear if there was an actual increase or simply an accumulation of violence," stated the authors. "Together, these studies provide very limited evidence that female perpetration of IPV may follow a similar developmental trajectory as other forms of violence. [...] Unfortunately, many of the studies included in this review used modified or alternative instruments making it difficult to accurately compare prevalence estimates."&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

In a 2009 survey, the CDC found that 9.8% of high school students in the U.S. reported having been intentionally physically hurt by their boyfriend or girlfriend in the preceding 12&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; A 2011 CDC nationwide survey of the U.S. population reported that 23% of females and 14% of males who ever experienced rape, other physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner first experienced some form of partner violence between 11 and 17 years of age.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The ages between 16 and 24 are when youth are the most susceptible to dating violence. Also, according to the CDC, one in ten teens will be physically abused between seventh and twelfth grade. Because of this abuse, victims are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, employ precarious sexual conduct, develop eating disorders, and attempt suicide.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The above numbers are notable in their magnitude and in their discrepancy, indicating that at some point between birth and high school a huge number of males are learning that it is useful and acceptable to abuse their dating partners in some way. The reciprocal of males learning violent behaviors is that women are not learning this fact and are instead learning through our culture and through violence directed at them that they are to be submissive. Males learning violent behaviors coupled with females thinking it normative creates a cycle of women being abused, learning to accept it and imparting this idea to their children and repeating the process. According to a study conducted by Susan M. Sanders she found that many adolescents do not always view aggressive behavior as violent or abusive and roughly 77.6% young girls agreed that after a physical altercation such as being kicked by their partner that they would cease to date them. The study conducted demonstrated that many adolescents, primarily females were more susceptible to leave only after a physical altercation took place. With these studies it was found that once a physical altercation took place the victim  would then view it as abusive and eventually desire to leave the relationship.&lt;ref&gt; Susan, M. S.(2003) Teen Dating Violence: The Invisible Peril. New York. Peter Lang Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescent dating violence is a subject which must be understood in order for true equality between the sexes to be achieved and to help stop partner violence in adults before it occurs.

====Legislation====
In the United States, the National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) states that "[p]olicymakers can play a role in preventing teen dating violence".&lt;ref name=NCSL&gt;{{cite web | title = Teen dating violence | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120609073629/http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/health/teen-dating-violence.aspx | archive-date = 9 June 2012 | url = http://www.ncsl.org/?tabid=17582 | website = ncsl.org | publisher = [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] | date = May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lists those states that currently have laws requiring school boards to develop and adopt programs to address this issue. Further, according to NCSL "[i]n 2011 at least eight states have introduced legislation to address teen dating violence".&lt;ref name=NCSL/&gt; On January 31, 2011, President Obama proclaimed February 2011 to be "National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = President of the United States | author-link = President of the United States | title = Presidential proclamation--National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, 2011 | url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/31/presidential-proclamation-national-teen-dating-violence-awareness-and-pr | website = whitehouse.gov | publisher = [[White House]] | date = 31 January 2011 | access-date = 13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the U.S. first recognized "National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Week", sponsored by Senator [[Mike Crapo]], to "increase public awareness and education of the prevalence of teen dating violence among our nation's teens".&lt;ref name=Crapo&gt;{{cite web | last = Crapo | first = Mike (Sen.) | author-link = Mike Crapo | title = Teen dating violence awareness week | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130219164115/http://www.crapo.senate.gov/issues/teen_dating_violence.cfm | archive-date = 19 February 2013 | url = http://www.crapo.senate.gov/issues/teen_dating_violence.cfm | website = crapo.senate.gov | date = 19 February 2013 | access-date = 13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first week in February was so recognized through 2009. Beginning in 2010, Senator Crapo joined the Department of Justice in recognizing the month of February as Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month.&lt;ref name=Crapo/&gt;

====National helpline and organizations====
The National Dating Abuse Helpline, created by [[National Domestic Violence Hotline]], is a 24-hour nationwide Web-based and telephone resource created to help teens and young people who are experiencing dating abuse. They offer information on building healthy relationships and how to recognize warning signs. It is the only helpline in the country serving all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hingorani | first = Jitin | title = New national teen dating abuse helpline to provide urgent support for teens | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090214073216/http://www.jwi.org/site/c.okLWJ3MPKtH/b.2541101/k.7124/New_National_Teen_Dating_Abuse_Helpline_to_Provide_Urgent_Support_for_Teens.htm | archive-date = 14 February 2009 | url = http://www.jwi.org/site/c.okLWJ3MPKtH/b.2541101/k.7124/New_National_Teen_Dating_Abuse_Helpline_to_Provide_Urgent_Support_for_Teens.htm | website = jwi.org | publisher = Resources, Training &amp; Education: Domestic Violence Newsletters, Jewish Women International | date = March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Circle of Reason''' ('''COR''') is a [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul|Twin Cities]], [[Minnesota]]-based international society of [[Theism|theists]], [[Atheism|atheists]], [[Conservatism|conservatives]], and [[Liberalism|liberals]] who espouse the [[social philosophy]] of '''pluralistic rationalism''' (also '''plurationalism''' or '''methodological rationalism''').&lt;ref name="pluralism1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pluralism2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pluralism3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pluralism4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="circleofreason"&gt;[http://www.circleofreason.org The Circle of Reason].

==Overview==
Pluralistic rationalism is described in cultural media as "commitment to reason[ing], regardless of one's worldview,"&lt;ref name="ST_OITNB"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160202184143/http://primary.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2015/06/16/orange_is_the_new_black_is_the_new_star_trek_and_not_just_because_of_kate.html "Orange Is the New Black Is the New Star Trek," Katy Waldman, ''Slate'', June 16, 2015]. Retrieved July 07, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the society itself as "communal commitment to more consistently practice the basic methodological tenets of a reasoning lifestyle (reality's acceptance, assumption's denial, and emotion's mastery) irrespective of our theological, ethical, cultural or political worldviews."&lt;ref name="circleofreason" /&gt;  According to The Circle of Reason, pluralistic rationalism is practiced through encouraging not a particular worldview, but rather factualism, skepticism, and moderationism; and furthermore through discouraging their opposing practices of denialism, dogmatism, and emotionalism -- or "denials of reality, unquestioned assumptions (potentially false realities), and emotive arguments or actions (dissociation from reality)." Plurationalist practices include discouraging the verbal, printed or televised use of insults (which the group asserts is immoral because, as ''ad hominem'' argumentation, it seeks to "irrationally persuade by evoking emotionality.") Because plurationalists hold that "as a sapient being one's best tool to survive is one's ability to reason," they claim people's basic universalized moral imperative must then be "to consistently allow, and encourage, others to reason."&lt;ref name="circleofreason" /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Reflecting the plurationalist society's call to "more consistently use everyday reasoning regardless of our worldviews,"&lt;ref name="circleofreason" /&gt; its institutional practices have included organizing the [[United States|United States']] first reported "theist + atheist" dialogue group, "Secular Bible Study," for reasoning discussion on the historical context, societal impact and cultural relevance of the Bible and religion,&lt;ref name="pluralism1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pluralism2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Strib"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140118163109/http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/39916382.html?refer=y "Secular Bible Study casts wide net," ''Star Tribune'', February 20, 2009].

'''''The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time''''' is a 2003 [[mystery novel]] by British writer [[Mark Haddon]]. Its title quotes the fictional detective [[Sherlock Holmes]] in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1892 short story "[[The Adventure of Silver Blaze]]". Haddon and ''The Curious Incident'' won the [[Whitbread Book Awards]] for Best Novel and Book of the Year,&lt;ref name="costabookawards" /&gt; the [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] for Best First Book,&lt;ref name="vic" /&gt; and the [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]].&lt;ref name=prize2003/&gt; Unusually, it was published simultaneously in separate editions for adults and children.&lt;ref name= "Ezard"&gt;{{cite news |last= Ezard |first= John |authorlink= |title= Curious incident of writer's literary hat trick: Whitbread list means Haddon could be three time winner |work= [[The Guardian]] |location= London |publisher= Guardian News and Media |date= 13 November 2003 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/nov/13/books.whitbreadbookawards2003 |accessdate= 21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel is narrated in the [[first-person narrative|first-person perspective]] by Christopher John Francis Boone, a 15-year-old boy who describes himself as "a mathematician with some behavioural difficulties" living in [[Swindon]], Wiltshire. Although Christopher's condition is not stated, the book's blurb refers to [[Asperger syndrome]], [[high-functioning autism]], or [[savant syndrome]]. In July 2009, Haddon wrote on his blog that "''Curious Incident'' is not a book about Asperger's... if anything it's a novel about difference, about being an outsider, about seeing the world in a surprising and revealing way. The book is not specifically about any specific disorder," and that he, Haddon, is not an expert on autism spectrum disorder or Asperger syndrome.&lt;ref name="mh-autism" /&gt;

The book uses prime numbers to number the chapters, rather than the conventional successive numbers.

==Plot==
Christopher John Francis Boone a fifteen-year-old boy with an [[autism spectrum]] condition, lives with his father, who has told him that his mother, Judy, died two years ago. The boy discovers the dead body of the neighbour's dog, Wellington, speared by a garden fork. Mrs Shears, the dog's owner, calls the police, and Christopher comes under suspicion. When a policeman touches him, he hits the policeman, and is arrested, then released with a [[police caution]]. He decides to investigate the dog's death, despite his father's orders to stay out of other people's business. He is severely limited by his fears and difficulties when interpreting the world around him. Throughout his adventures, Christopher records his experiences in a book, which he calls a "murder mystery novel". During his investigation, Christopher meets people whom he has never before encountered, even though they live on the same street, including the elderly Mrs Alexander, who informs Christopher that his mother had an affair with Mr Shears and had been with him for a long time.

Christopher's father, Ed, discovers the book and confiscates it after a brief fight with the boy. While searching for the confiscated book, Christopher uncovers a trove of letters which his mother wrote to him, dated after her supposed death, which his father has also hidden. He is so shocked by his father lying about his mother's death that he is unable to move, curls up on the bed, vomits and groans for several hours until his father returns home. Ed realizes that Christopher has read the letters and cleans him up. He then confesses that he had indeed lied about Judy's death and also that it was he who killed Wellington, stating that it was a mistake resulting from his anger after a heated argument with Mrs Shears. Christopher, having lost all trust in his father and fearing that Ed might try to kill him since he had already killed the dog, decides to live with his mother and runs away. He remembers his mother's address from the letters and embarks on an adventurous trip to London, where his mother lives with Mr Shears.

After a long and event-filled journey, evading policemen and feeling ill from the [[information overload|overwhelmingly large amount of information]] and stimuli from the trains and crowds around him, he finally finds his way to his mother and Mr Shears's home, and waits outside until they arrive. Judy is delighted that Christopher has come to her; she is upset that Ed told Christopher that she was dead. Mr Shears does not want Christopher living with them and never did. Very soon after arriving, Christopher wants to return to Swindon in order to take his mathematics [[A-level]]. His mother leaves Mr Shears, their relationship having broken down because of their conflict about Christopher and Mr Shears's rejection of Christopher. Judy then moves into a rented room in Swindon. After an argument with Ed, she agrees to let Ed meet Christopher for daily brief visits. Christopher remains terrified of his father and makes repeated attempts to prevent him from talking. He hopes Ed will be imprisoned for killing Wellington, although his mother explains that for this to happen, Mrs Shears would have to press charges.

The story ends with Ed getting Christopher a [[Golden Retriever]] puppy, whom Christopher gets to name, and promising that he will rebuild trust with Christopher slowly, "no matter how long it takes". Christopher asserts that he will take further [[A-level]] exams and attend university. He completes his mathematics A-level with top grades despite having eaten and slept very little. Earlier in the story he talks about wanting to become an astronaut, but at the end he declares that his goal is to become a scientist. The book ends with Christopher optimistic about his future, having solved the mystery of the murdered dog, gone to London on his own, found his mother, written a book about his adventures, and achieved an A in his A-level maths exam.

== Themes ==

=== Social disability ===
In a June 2003 interview with [[NPR]]'s [[Terry Gross]] on her program ''[[Fresh Air]]'', Haddon said about Christopher, "If he were diagnosed, he would be diagnosed as having Asperger's syndrome, which is a form of autism. I suppose you'd call it high-function autism in that he can function on, you know, a day-to-day basis, in a kind of rudimentary way. But he has a serious difficulty with life in that he really doesn't empathize with other human beings. He can't read their faces. He can't put himself in their shoes. And he can't understand anything more than the literal meaning of whatever's said to him, although I'm very careful in the book not to actually use the word 'Asperger's' or 'autism.' ... Because I don't want him to be labelled, and because, as with most people who have a disability, I don't think it's necessarily the most important thing about him... And as a good friend of mine said after reading the book, a friend who is himself a mathematician, it's not a novel about a boy who has Asperger's syndrome; it's a novel about a young mathematician who has some strange behavioural problems. And I think that's right."&lt;ref name= "NPR"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Terry Gross]] interviewing Mark Haddon |date=26 June 2003 |title=Children's Book Writer and Illustrator Mark Haddon |medium= |url=https://ondemand.npr.org/anon.npr-mp3/npr/fa/2003/06/20030626_fa_02.mp3 |access-date=30 November 2018 |format= |time=2:25 minutes in |publisher=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haddon added, in the conversation with Terry Gross, "I have to say honestly that I did more research about the London Underground and the inside of Swindon Railway Station, where some of the novel takes place, than I did about Asperger's syndrome. I gave him kind of nine or 10 rules that he would live his life by, and then I didn't read any more about Asperger's because I think there is no typical person who has Asperger's syndrome, and they're as large and diverse a group of people as any other group in society. And the important thing is that I did a lot of imagining, that I did a lot of putting myself into his shoes in trying to make him come alive as a human being rather than getting him right, whatever that might mean."

Haddon states on his website that, although he had read "a handful of newspaper and magazine articles about, or by, people with Asperger's and autism" in preparation for writing the book, he knows "very little" about Asperger's syndrome and that Christopher Boone is inspired by two different people. According to Haddon, none of these people can be labelled as having a disability. Haddon added that he "slightly regret[s]" that the term Asperger's syndrome appeared on the cover of his novel.&lt;ref name="mh-autism" /&gt; In 2010, in an interview with ''[[The Independent]]'', he was described as "now thoroughly irritated that the word Asperger's appeared on subsequent editions of the novel, because now everyone imagines that he is an expert and he keeps getting phone calls asking him to appear at lectures."&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

In a critical essay on the novel, Vivienne Muller quotes some praise by experts on [[Disability#Theory|disability theory]]: "In its presentation of Christopher's everyday experiences of the society in which he lives, the narrative offers a rich canvas of experiences for an ethnographic study of this particular cognitive condition, and one which places a positive spin on the syndrome. The reader in this instance acts as ethnographer, invited to see what Mark Osteen claims is a 'quality in autistic lives that is valuable in and of itself' (cited in [S.] Adams 2005, p.1). Along similar lines, [Alex] McClimens writes that Haddon's novel is 'an ethnographic delight' and that 'Haddon's achievement is to have written a novel that turns on the central character's difference without making that difference a stigmatising characteristic' (2005, p.24)." Muller adds that the novel "works with a strong sense of the disabled speaking subject, drawing readers into Christopher's cognitive/corporeal space through an incremental layering of his perspectives and reactions... The narrative also bristles with diagrams, maps, drawings, stories, texts that inform Christopher's lexicon for mapping meaning in a world of bewildering signs and sounds." She also admires such elements as "the digressive stream-of-connectedness-and-disconnectedness way in which Christopher writes and thinks; the obsessive focus on minutiae; his musings about why animals behave the way they do; his quasi philosophizing on death and life and the afterlife; his ambition to be an astronaut..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Muller |first= Vivienne |title= Constituting Christopher: Disability Theory and Mark Haddon's ''The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time'' |journal= Papers: Explorations into Children's Literature |volume= 16 |issue= 2 |date= December 2006 |page= 118+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of children's books which "teach about emotional life," Laura Jana wrote, "On the one hand, this is a story of how an undeniably quirky teenage boy clings to order, deals with a family crisis, and tries to make sense of the world as he sees it. But it also provides profound insight into a disorder—autism—that leaves those who have it struggling to perceive even the most basic of human emotions. In so doing, ''The Curious Incident'' leaves its readers with a greater appreciation of their own ability to feel, express, and interpret emotions. This mainstream literary success made its way to the top of the ''New York Times'' bestseller list for fiction at the same time it was being touted by experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism-spectrum disorder as an unrivaled fictional depiction of the inner workings of an autistic teenage boy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Jana |first= Laura A. |title= Feelings 101: Teaching about Emotional Life through Literature |journal= Contemporary Pediatrics |volume= 22 |issue= 2 |date= February 2005 |page= 87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphor ===
Christopher often comments on his inability to appreciate some metaphors and similes. He gives as an example a quote that he found in "a proper novel": "I am veined with iron, with silver and with streaks of common mud. I cannot contract into the firm fist which those clench who do not depend on stimulus." Haddon told Terry Gross, "Funnily enough, it's actually a quote from Virginia Woolf. It's Virginia Woolf on an off day, in the middle, I think, of ''[[The Waves]]''. An author whom I love actually, but who sometimes got a little too carried away."&lt;ref name= "NPR" /&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Awards ===
The book was joint winner of the 2004 [[Exclusive Books Boeke Prize|Boeke Prize]], won the [[2003 Whitbread Awards|2003 Whitbread]] Book of the Year award and sold more than two million copies.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; Haddon also was one of the winners of the 2004 [[Alex Awards]], which "honor the 10 top adult books with appeal for adolescents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Adult Books that Appeal to Teens |journal= Reading Today |volume= 22 |issue= 1 |date= August–September 2004 |page= 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as winning the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, Haddon earned the Book Trust teenage fiction award.&lt;ref name= "Ezard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarvas"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.themodernword.com/reviews/haddon.html |author= Sarvas, Mark |date= 27 January 2004 |title= ''The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time'' |publisher= The Modern Word |accessdate= 21 April 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130402052001/http://www.themodernword.com/reviews/haddon.html |archivedate= 2 April 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time'' was also [[Short list|long-listed]] for the [[Man Booker Prize]], and "many observers were surprised that it did not advance to the shortlist." [[John Carey (critic)|John Carey]], chairman of the Booker panel of judges, told ''The Guardian'', "We have several clashes of opinion among the judges but I found Haddon's book about a boy with Asperger's syndrome breathtaking."&lt;ref name= "Sarvas" /&gt;

=== Critical reaction ===
A survey in Great Britain, conducted by the [[BBC]]'s literacy campaign for [[World Book Day (United Kingdom)|World Book Day]], found ''Curious Incident'' to be among "the top five happy endings, as voted on by readers" in novels (the others were ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' and ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]'', the last of which ''Curious'' outranked).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Happy Endings |journal= Reading Today |volume= 23 |issue= 5 |date= April–May 2006 |page= 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[School Library Journal]]'' praised it as a "rich and poignant novel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title= Haddon, Mark. ''The Curious Incident of the Dog on Night-Time'' |magazine= [[School Library Journal]] |volume= 50 |issue= 4 |date= April 2004 |page= S64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' said, "Haddon does something audacious here, and he does it superbly. He shows us the way consciousness orders the world, even when the world doesn't want to be ordered," adding that "the great achievement of this novel is that it transcends its obvious cleverness. It's more than an exercise in narrative ingenuity. Filled with humor and pain, it verges on profundity in its examination of those things—customs, habits, language, symbols, daily routines, etc.—that simultaneously unite and separate human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Matthews |first= Charles |title= Narrator is Autistic – Reasoning is Artistic |work= [[San Jose Mercury News]] |date= 22 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A reviewer for ''[[The Christian Century]]'' described it as "an absorbing, plausible book": "The reader becomes absorbed not only in the mystery of a murdered dog and a missing mom, but also in the mysterious world of an autistic child."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title= ''The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time'' |magazine= [[The Christian Century]] |volume= 122 |issue= 25 |date= 13 December 2005 |page= 23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer for ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' wrote that the story is "a touching evolution, one that Haddon scripts with tenderness and care... a unique window into the mind of a boy who thinks a little differently, but like many kids his age, doesn't quite know how to feel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Freeman |first= John |title= BOOKS: Whodunit Unveils Autistic Boy's Mind |work= [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |date= 29 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Roger Soder called it "visceral" and a "delightful story," declaring, "All of us in our Spokane Book Club are special education professionals and so have considerable experience with kids with this disability, and we found the story believable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Soder |first= Roger  |title= Books for Summer Reading |journal= Phi Delta Kappan |volume= 86 |issue= 10 |date= June 2005 |page= 777 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical professionals' reviews ===
Alex McClimens, whom Muller quoted above, also wrote, "This magnificent essay in communication is compulsory reading for anyone with the slightest interest in autistic spectrum disorders. This book is also required reading for those who simply enjoy a fascinating story... we are offered a first person narrative to match anything by contemporary writers. Mark Haddon has created a true literary character and his handling of the teenage Asperger's heroic adventure is brilliantly crafted. He uses the literal mind-set of his hero to mask the true direction of the plot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= McClimens |first= Alex |title= ''The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time'' (Adult version) |journal= [[Learning Disability Practice]] |volume= 8 |issue= 4 |date= May 2005 |page= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer Paul Moorehead calls the book "a fairly ripping adventure story" and writes, "It's also quite a feat of writing. The actual use of language is somewhat austere—an unavoidable consequence of having a boy with autism as a narrator—but it has its own beauty, and it works. So persuasive and so effective is the construction of Christopher, not only is he a character you're rooting for, he's also the character in the story you understand the best. It's startling how believably and comfortably this story puts you into what you might have thought were likely to be some pretty alien shoes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Moorehead |first= Paul |title= Comfortable in Alien Shoes |journal= [[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] |volume= 174 |issue= 9 |pages= 1307–1308 |date= 25 April 2006 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.060083|pmc= 1435967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewer David Ellis, naming ''Curious Incident'' an "ambitious and innovative novel," wrote that Haddon "manages to avoid the opposing pitfalls of either offending people with autism and their families or turning Christopher into an object of pity. Instead of becoming the focus of the plot, the autism enhances it. The unemotional descriptions amplify many moments of observational comedy, and misfortunes are made extremely poignantly." He concludes that Christopher's story is "far more enjoyable and likely to stay with you for far longer than any medical textbook."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ellis |first= David S. J. |title= ''The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time'' |journal= Student BMJ |volume= 12 |date= February 2004 |page= 84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Texas community reactions ===
The novel was selected as a recommended book for the 2006 Galveston Reads program, a literacy encouragement program in [[Galveston County, Texas]]. Kimball Brizendine, the Mayor of [[Friendswood, Texas|Friendswood]], issued a proclamation declaring "Galveston County Reads Day" and encouraging "all citizens, teens to seniors" to read the novel. Five days later, he retracted the statement, declaring that it was "not [his] intention to endorse this readership [''sic''] for our younger readers." The journal ''[[American Libraries]]'' reported, "City Council member Chris Peden went a step further, asserting to the January 28 ''Galveston County Daily News'' that while he hadn't read ''Curious Incident'' in its entirety, he had noted that the 'F word' appeared on page four and that 'later in the book, the [lead character] says there is no God and there is no life after death. Clearly, these are not ideas we should promote to kids'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=news&amp;template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=115300|title= ''Curious Incident'' Triggers Curious Reaction in Texas |magazine= [[American Libraries]] |volume= 37 |issue= 3 |date= March 2006 |page= 19 |accessdate= 29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, 2007, some parents in [[Bryan, Texas]], "were appalled to see what their kids were reading" and protested the inclusion of the book in high school libraries, with one parent claiming that ''Curious Incident'' and another book (''[[Catalyst (novel)|Catalyst]]'' by [[Laurie Halse Anderson]]) were "unsuitable for not just some but all high school students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.docstoc.com/docs/134973582/Curious-Incident-Challenge-List |author= Roggenkamp, Karen |date= |title= Challenges to ''The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime'' |publisher= Texas A&amp;M University |location= Commerce, TX |accessdate= 29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tianlong''' ({{zh|s=天龙|t=天龍|p=''tiānlóng''|w=''t'ien lung''}}; lit. "heavenly dragon") is a flying [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] in [[Chinese mythology]], a star in [[Chinese astrology]], and a [[proper name]].

==Word==
The term ''tianlong'' combines ''tian'' [[Wikt:天|天]] "heaven" and ''long'' [[Wikt:龍|龍]] "dragon". Since ''[[tian]]'' literally means "heaven; the heavens; sky" or figuratively "Heaven; God; gods", ''tianlong'' can denote "heavenly dragon; celestial dragon" or "holy dragon; divine dragon".

Tianlong 天龍 is [[homophonous]] with another name in [[Chinese folklore]]. Tianlong 天聾 "Heavenly Deaf" (with the character ''long'' [[Wikt:聾|聾]] "deaf" combining the "ear [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]]" [[Wikt:耳|耳]] and a ''long'' 龍 [[phonetic]] element) and ''Diya'' 地啞 "Earthly Dumb" are legendary attendants to Wenchang 文昌, the patron deity of literature.

==Meanings==
From originally denoting "heavenly dragon", ''Tianlong'' 天龍 semantically developed meanings as [[Buddhist]] "heavenly Nāgas" or "Devas and Nāgas", "centipede", and "proper names" of stars, people, and places.

===Dragons===
Among [[Chinese classic texts]], ''tian'' "heaven" and ''long'' "dragon" were first used together in [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1122 BCE – 256 BCE) writings, but the word ''tianlong'' was not recorded until the [[Han Dynasty]] (207 BCE – 220 CE).

The ancient ''[[Yijing]]'' "Book of Changes" exemplifies using ''tian'' "heaven" and ''long'' "dragon" together. ''Qian'' 乾 "The Creative", the first [[Hexagram (I Ching)|hexagram]], says (tr. Wilhelm 1967:9), "Nine in the fifth place means: Flying dragons in the heavens. It furthers one to see the great man." The "Commentary on the Decision" (彖傳, tr. Wilhelm 1967:371) explains, "Because the holy man is clear as to the end and the beginning, as to the way in which each of the six stages completes itself in its own time, he mounts on them toward heaven as though on six dragons." And the "Commentary on the Images" (象傳, tr. Wilhelm 1967:371) says, "'Flying dragon in the heavens.' This shows the great man at work."

The earliest usage of ''tianlong'' 天龍 "heavenly dragon", according to the ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'', is in the ''Xinxu'' 新序 "New Prefaces" by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] (79–8 BCE). It records a story (Yuan 2006:213) about Zigao, the [[Duke of Ye]], who professed to love dragons. After he carved and painted dragon images throughout his house, a [天龍] heavenly dragon [or ''fulong'' 夫龍 in some editions] came to visit, but Ye was scared and ran away. 

The ''[[Fangyan]]'' 方言 dictionary (12) by [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]] (53 BCE – 18 CE) has another early usage of ''tian'' and ''long''. It defines ''[[panlong (mythology)|panlong]]'' 蟠龍 "coiled dragon" as 未陞天龍, syntactically meaning either "Dragons which do not yet ascend to heaven" (Visser 1913:73) or "Heavenly Dragons which do not yet ascend" (Carr 1990:113).

===Asterisms===
''Tianlong'' Heavenly Dragon names both the Western [[constellation]] [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] and a star in the [[Chinese constellation]] [[Azure Dragon (Chinese constellation)|Azure Dragon]].

''Tianlongza'' 天龍座 "Heavenly Dragon Seat/Constellation" is the Chinese translation of Draco (from Latin "Dragon"), a constellation near the [[North Celestial Pole]]. The (1578 CE) ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' pharmacopeia's entry for ''long'' "dragon" describes (Read 1934:301) "a pearl under its chin", and Read notes, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The constellation Draco has the appearance of guarding and encircling the northern pole which is the centre of the movement of the fixed stars. The Chinese paintings of the Dragon straining after a mystical "Pearl" undoubtedly relate to this relationship to the North Pole Star, though other explanations are given for this. (1934:306-7) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Tianlong'' 天龍 "Heavenly Dragon" is the 3rd star in ''Fangxiu'' 房宿 "[[Room (Chinese constellation)]]" and corresponds to the Western constellation [[Scorpius]]. "Room" is the 4th of the [[Twenty-eight mansions]] in the Azure Dragon, which is one of the celestial [[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four Symbols]]. [[Wolfram Eberhard]] (1968:243) notes, "When the dragon star appeared in the sky it was customary to make a sacrifice supplicating for rain," and this springtime dragon festival occurs on the 2nd day of the 2nd month. 

===Centipede===
The ''Bencao Gangmu'' entry for ''wugong'' 蜈蚣 "[[centipede]]" lists ''tianlong'' 天龍 "heavenly dragon" as an alternate name. [[Li Shizhen]]'s commentary reviews earlier Chinese commentators and texts. The ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' (2, tr. Mair 1994:20–21) says, "People eat meat, deer eat grass, [蝍且] giant centipedes savor snakes, hawks and crows relish mice." The ''[[Huainanzi]]'' (17, tr. Carr 1990:111) says, "The [騰蛇] [[Teng (mythology)|ascending snake]] can drift in the mist, yet it is endangered by the [蝍蛆] centipede." The ''[[Erya]]'' dictionary (15) defines ''jili'' 蒺蔾 "thorns; puncture vine; bramble" as ''jieju'' 蝍蛆 "centipede; cricket"; which [[Guo Pu]]'s commentary says resembles a ''huang'' 蝗 "locust" with a large abdomen, long horns, and which eats snake brains. Although ''jieju'' can also mean ''xishuai'' 蟋蟀 "cricket", Li concludes it means the snake-controlling ''wugong'' "centipede" that the ''Fangyan'' dictionary (11) also calls ''maxian'' 馬蚿 "horse/giant millipede" or ''juqu'' 蛆蟝. According to Eberhard (1968:159), centipedes were snake predators, and "the enmity between snake and centipede occurs in many folktales and customs."

===Buddhist usages===
In [[Chinese Buddhist]] terminology, ''tianlong'' means either "heavenly [[Nāga]]s (dragon gods)" or "[[Deva (Buddhism)|Devas]] (heavenly gods) and Nāgas".

First, ''tianlong'' 天龍 means "heavenly dragon/nāga" as the first of four nāga classes in [[Mahayana]] tradition (tr. Visser 1913:21-2).
# ''Heavenly Nāgas'' (天龍), who guard the Heavenly Palace and carry it so that it does not fall.
# ''[[Shenlong|Divine Nāgas]]'' (神龍), who benefit mankind by causing the clouds to rise and the rain to fall.
# ''[[Dilong|Earthly Nāgas]]'' (地龍) who drain off rivers (remove the obstructions) and open sluices (outlets).
# ''[[Fucanglong|Nāgas who are lying hidden]]'' (伏藏龍) who guard the treasures of the "[[Cakravartin]]" (轉輪王) and blesses mankind.

Hangzhou Tianlong 杭州天龍 "Heavenly Dragon from [[Hangzhou]]" was a 9th-century [[Zen|Chan]] Buddhist master who enlightened [[Juzhi Yizhi]] by holding up one finger. The ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'' (tr. Cleary 1977:123-8) calls this "Chu Ti's One-Finger Ch'an" [[kōan]].
 
Second, ''tianlong'' 天龍 translates [[Sanskrit]] ''deva-nāga'' "Devas and Nāgas", the 2 highest categories of the ''Tianlong Babu'' 天龍八部 "8 kinds of beings that protect the [[Dharma]]". The lower 6 categories are ''yecha'' 夜叉 "[[Yaksha]]; cannibalistic devils; nature spirits", ''gantapo'' 乾闥婆 "[[Gandharva]]; half-ghost music masters", ''axiuluo'' 阿修羅 "[[Asura]]; evil and violent demigods", ''jialouluo'' 迦樓羅 "[[Garuda]]; golden bird-like demons that eat dragons", ''jinnaluo'' 緊那羅 "[[Kinnara]]; half-human half-bird celestial music masters", and ''maholuluojia'' 摩睺羅迦 "Mahoraga; earthly snake spirits".

''Tianlong Babu'' 天龍八部 is also the title of a 1963 [[wuxia]] novel by [[Jin Yong]], translated as English ''[[Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils]]''. This Chinese title is further used by movies, television series, and a [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]].

===Proper names===
Tianlong is a common name in [[Standard Chinese]]. Tianlongshan 天龍山 "Heavenly Dragon Mountain", which is located near [[Taiyuan]] in [[Shanxi]], is famous for the [[Tianlongshan Grottoes|Tianlongshan Shiku 天龍山石窟 Grottoes]]. The commercial name Tianlong "Heavenly Dragon" is used by companies, [[Tianlong Hotel|hotels]], and [[gungfu]] schools.

[[Image:Tenryu-Ji Garden.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tenryū-ji]] garden]]
[[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''Tenryū'' 天龍 or 天竜, a [[loanword]] from Chinese ''Tianlong'', is a comparable proper name. A famous example is ''[[Tenryū-ji]]'' 天龍寺 "Heavenly Dragon Temple" in [[Kyoto]], which is headquarters of the Tenryū-ji Branch of the [[Rinzai]] sect. Tenryū place names include a waterway ([[Tenryū River]] 天竜川), a city ([[Tenryū, Shizuoka]] 天竜市), and a village ([[Tenryū, Nagano]] 天龍村). Further examples include [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] names ([[Japanese cruiser Tenryū]] 天龍), and personal names ([[Genichiro Tenryu]] 天龍源一郎, a wrestler).

'''Uptown Oakland''' or '''The Uptown''' is a neighborhood in  [[Downtown Oakland|Downtown]] [[Oakland, California]].  Its boundaries are ill-defined, but most definitions include the area between 27th Street to the north, [[San Pablo Avenue]] to the west, [[Oakland City Center|City Center]] to the south, and Harrison St to the east.  The neighborhood has become an important [[entertainment district]] in recent years.&lt;ref name=sfbtpost&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2011/11/25/moving-ahead-in-oakland-post-occupy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The area near 20th Street and Broadway had been Oakland's main [[shopping district]] in the mid-20th century. Several buildings from that era remain, including the [[Capwell's]] department store, which later became [[Sears]] and is currently being developed into a mixed-use retail and office building called "Uptown Station;"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/12/19/downtown-oaklands-uber-building-is-bought-by-cim-group-rehab-will-continue/|title=Downtown Oakland’s Uber building is bought by CIM Group, rehab will continue|date=2017-12-19|work=The Mercury News|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[I. Magnin]] department store; the [[Paramount Theater (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theater]]; and the [[Fox Oakland Theatre]]. The Payless Drug Store and Market located at Telegraph Ave. and 20th St, housed the drug store small produce markets and seafood sellers. It included a SAAG's sausage counter and even a USO branch.
This structure was demolished in the early 1960s to construct a parking structure for Capwell's Department store. The area was home to one of the original [[Kwik Way]] hamburger outlets and also at Broadway and Grand Ave the Oakland branch of Breuners furniture.

West of [[Telegraph Avenue]], the neighborhood was for many years largely made up of [[parking lot]]s and garages. The area has gone through several failed [[urban renewal]] projects and proposals, including proposals for a shopping mall, an entertainment district, high-rise housing, and a professional baseball stadium. The area now contains several attractive high-rise apartment buildings.

==Development==
During [[Jerry Brown]]'s time as Mayor (1999-2007) The Uptown District was deemed the Entertainment center of the city.  Redevelopment has taken place by large upscale apartments and restaurants, bringing some much needed money and foot traffic into the area. The centerpiece has been the city government's 10K program, an effort to bring 10,000 additional residents to the downtown area. The largest of the new apartment complexes is a five-story, three-building apartment complex called "The Uptown"&lt;ref name=uptown&gt;http://www.theuptown.net/&lt;/ref&gt; built by [[Forest City Enterprises]], including a new dog-friendly park called Fox Square.  A new surface street, '''Rashida Muhammad Street''', was named after the late community activist who died of lung cancer in 2006. [[Alice Walker]] immortalized Rashida Muhammad's (aka Dessie X. Woods) story in her collection of essays ''Living by the Word''.  The street was built with the stated goal of The Uptown project of enhancing and building a new community in the area.  This complex also features the "Remember Them" sculpture by [[Mario Chiodo]], a local artist.&lt;ref name=remember&gt;http://remember-them.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture, when it is complete, will be one of the largest bronze sculptures in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Jones.
