[[File:Ecozone Afrotropic.svg|300px|thumb|The Afrotropical realm, marked in blue]]
:''See [[Tropical Africa]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] for other aspects.''
The '''Afrotropical realm''' is one of the Earth's eight [[biogeographic realm]]s. It includes [[Africa]] south of the [[Sahara Desert]], the southern and eastern fringes of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], the island of [[Madagascar]], southern [[Iran]] and extreme southwestern [[Pakistan]], and the islands of the western [[Indian Ocean]]. It was formerly known as the '''Ethiopian Zone''' or '''Ethiopian Region'''.

==Major ecological regions==
Most of the Afrotropic, with the exception of Africa's southern tip, has a [[tropical]] climate. A broad belt of deserts, including the [[Atlantic Desert|Atlantic]] and [[Sahara Desert|Sahara]] deserts of northern Africa and the [[Arabian Desert]] of the Arabian Peninsula, separate the Afrotropic from the [[Palearctic]] realm, which includes northern Africa and temperate [[Eurasia]].

===Sahel and Sudan===
South of the Sahara, two belts of [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical grassland and savanna]] run east and west across the continent, from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. Immediately south of the Sahara lies the [[Sahel]] belt, a transitional zone of semi-arid short grassland and [[acacia]] savanna. Rainfall increases further south in the [[Sudanian Savanna]], also known simply as the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]], a belt of taller grasslands and savannas. The Sudanian Savanna is home to two great [[flooded grasslands and savannas|flooded grasslands]], the [[Sudd]] wetland in [[South Sudan]], and the [[Niger Inland Delta]] in [[Mali]]. The [[forest-savanna mosaic]] is a transitional zone between the grasslands and the belt of [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forests]] near the equator.

===[[Southern Arabian woodlands]]===
South Arabia, expressed as being mostly Yemen and parts of western Oman and southwestern Saudi Arabia, has few permanent forests. Some of the notable are [[Jabal Bura']], Jabal [[Raymah]], and [[Jabal Badaj]] in the Yemeni highland escarpment, and the seasonal forests in eastern Yemen and the [[Dhofar]] region of Oman. Other woodlands scatter the land and are very small and are predominantly [[juniper]] or [[acacia]] forests.

===Forest zone===
The [[forest zone]], a belt of lowland [[tropical moist broadleaf forests]], runs across most of equatorial Africa's [[intertropical convergence zone]]. The [[Upper Guinean forests]] of West Africa extend along the coast from [[Guinea]] to [[Togo]]. The [[Dahomey Gap]], a zone of forest-savanna mosaic that reaches to the coast, separates the Upper Guinean forests from the [[Lower Guinean forests]], which extend along the [[Gulf of Guinea]] from eastern [[Benin]] through [[Cameroon]] and [[Gabon]] to the western [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The largest tropical forest zone in Africa is the [[Congolian forests]] of the [[Congo Basin]] in Central Africa. A belt of tropical moist broadleaf forest also runs along the [[Indian Ocean]] coast, from southern [[Somalia]] to [[South Africa]].

===East African grasslands and savannas===
* ''Acacia''-''Commiphora'' grasslands
* [[Serengeti]]

===Eastern Africa's highlands===
[[Afromontane]] region, from the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] to the [[Drakensberg Mountains]] of South Africa, including the [[East African Rift]]. Distinctive flora, including ''[[Podocarpus]]'' and ''[[Afrocarpus]]'', as well as giant ''[[Lobelia]]s'' and ''[[Dendrosenecio|Senecio]]s''.
* [[Ethiopian Highlands]]
* [[Albertine rift montane forests]]
* [[East African montane forests]] and [[Eastern Arc forests]]

===Southern African woodlands, savannas, and grasslands===
[[File:Afrotropic-Ecozone-Southern Africa.svg|200px|thumb|Southern Africa as described in Plant Taxonomic Database Standards No. 2]]
* [[Miombo woodlands]]
* Zambezian mopane and ''Baikiaea'' woodlands
* [[Bushveld]]

===Deserts of southern Africa===
* [[Namib Desert]]
* [[Kalahari Desert]]
* [[Karoo]]
* [[Tankwa Karoo]]
* [[Richtersveld]]

===Cape floristic region===
The [[Cape floristic region]], at Africa's southern tip, is a [[Mediterranean climate]] region that is home to a significant number of endemic taxa, as well as to plant families like the [[protea]]s (''Proteaceae'') that are also found in the [[Australasian realm]].

===Madagascar and the Indian Ocean islands===
{{main|Ecoregions of Madagascar}}
[[Madagascar]] and neighboring islands form a distinctive sub-region of the realm, with numerous [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] [[taxon|taxa]] like the [[lemur]]s. Madagascar and the [[Seychelles]] are old pieces of the ancient supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], and broke away from Africa millions of years ago. Other Indian Ocean islands, like the [[Comoros]] and [[Mascarene Islands]], are volcanic islands that formed more recently. Madagascar contains several important biospheres, as its [[biodiversity]] and ratio of endemicism is extremely high.

==Endemic plants and animals==

===Plants===
The Afrotropical realm is home to a number of endemic plant families. [[Ecoregions of Madagascar|Madagascar and the Indian Ocean Islands]] are home to ten endemic families of flowering plants; eight are endemic to Madagascar ([[Asteropeiaceae]], [[Didymelaceae]], [[Didiereaceae]], [[Kaliphoraceae]], [[Melanophyllaceae]], [[Physenaceae]], [[Sarcolaenaceae]], and [[Sphaerosepalaceae]]), one to [[Seychelles]] ([[Mesdusagynaceae]]) and one to the [[Mascarene Islands]] ([[Psiloxylaceae]]). Twelve plant families are endemic or nearly endemic to South Africa (including [[Curtisiaceae]], [[Heteropyxidaceae]], [[Penaeaceae]], [[Psiloxylaceae]] and [[Rhynchocalycaceae]]) of which five are endemic to the [[Cape floristic region|Cape floristic province]] (including [[Grubbiaceae]]). Other endemic Afrotropic families include [[Barbeyaceae]], [[Montiniaceae]], [[Myrothamnaceae]] and [[Oliniaceae]].

===Animals===
{{main|Fauna of Africa}}
The East African Great Lakes ([[Lake Victoria|Victoria]], [[Malawi]], and [[Tanganyika]]) are the center of biodiversity of many freshwater fishes, especially [[cichlid]]s (they harbor more than two-thirds of the estimated 2,000 species in the family).&lt;ref&gt;I.P.Farias et al., Total Evidence: Molecules, Morphology, and the Phylogenetics of Cichlid Fishes, Journal of Experimental Zoology (Mol Dev Evol) 288:76–92 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The West African coastal rivers region covers only a fraction of West Africa, but harbours 322 of West African's fish species, with 247 restricted to this area and 129 restricted even
to smaller ranges. The central rivers fauna comprises 194 fish species, with 119 endemics and only 33 restricted to small areas.&lt;ref&gt;T.Moritz and K. E. Linsenmair, West African fish diversity – distribution patterns and possible conclusions for conservation strategies (in African Biodiversity: Molecules, Organisms, Ecosystems, Springer, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afrotropic has various endemic [[bird]] families, including [[ostrich]]es (Struthionidae), [[sunbird]]s, the [[secretary bird]] (Sagittariidae), [[guineafowl]] (Numididae), and [[mousebird]]s (Coliidae). Also, several families of [[passerines]] are limited to the Afrotropics; These include [[rock-jumper]]s (Chaetopidae) and [[rockfowl]] (Picathartidae).

Africa has three endemic orders of mammals, the [[Tubulidentata]] ([[aardvark]]s), [[Afrosoricida]] ([[tenrec]]s and [[golden mole]]s), and [[Macroscelidea]] ([[elephant shrew]]s). The [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|East-African plains]] are well known for their diversity of large mammals.

Four species of great apes ([[Hominidae]]) are endemic to Africa: both species of [[gorilla]] (western gorilla, ''Gorilla gorilla'', and eastern gorilla, ''Gorilla beringei'') and both species of [[chimpanzee]] ([[common chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes'', and [[bonobo]], ''Pan paniscus''). [[Human]]s and their ancestors originated in Africa.

===Maine Green Line===
On December 9, 2014, Anbaric and [[National Grid plc|National Grid]] announced the formation of [http://www.greenlineinfrastructurealliance.com Green Line Infrastructure Alliance].&lt;ref&gt;National Grid Press Release  http://www.nationalgridus.com/aboutus/a3-1_news2.asp?document=9003 | Retrieved December 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance aims to provide benefits to New England's energy consumers by providing consumers with access to large-scale, cost-effective sources of renewable and zero-emission energy; diversifying the region’s energy portfolio, thereby easing the constraints on the natural gas pipeline system and providing access to affordable clean energy; enabling the New England states to meet all current clean energy targets by 2020 at affordable prices and enhancing the reliability and resilience of the region’s power grid.

The Alliance's first project will be Maine Green Line, a hybrid land-and-sea HVDC project that will initially deliver 1,000MW of wind from northern Maine, firmed up by imports of hydropower from eastern Canada, via a submarine cable to Massachusetts.  Maine-based constructor Cianbro Development Corporation will be a part of this project. Connecticut-based PowerBridge has been part of the Maine Green Line Development team.

'''Atmospheric focusing''' is a phenomenon occurring when a large [[shock wave]] is produced in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], as in a [[nuclear explosion]] or large extraterrestrial object impact. The shock wave is [[refraction|refracted]] horizontally by density variations in the atmosphere so that it can have impacts in localized areas much further away than the theoretical extent of its blast effect. In large bombs, some effects may thus be found hundreds of kilometers from the blast site (such as in the case of the [[Tsar Bomba]] test, where damage was caused up to approximately 1,000&amp;nbsp;km away).

This effect operates similarly to the patterns made by sunlight on the bottom of a pool, the difference is that the light is bent at the contact point with the water while the shock wave is distorted by [[density]] variations (e.g. due to temperature variations) in the atmosphere. Variations of [[wind]] can cause a similar effect. This will disperse the shock wave at some places and focus it at others. For powerful shock waves this can cause damage farther than expected; the shock wave energy density will decrease beyond expected values [[inverse-square law|based on uniform geometry]] {{nobr|(&lt;math&gt;1/r^2&lt;/math&gt;}} falloff for weak shock or acoustic waves, as expected at large distances).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="58147">[[File:Nauvoo Temple basement.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Temple architecture (LDS Church)|Floorplan]] of the [[Nauvoo Temple]] basement. The basement of the temple was used as the [[baptistery]], containing a large [[baptismal font]] in the center of the main room.]]

'''Baptism for the dead''', '''vicarious baptism''' or '''proxy baptism''' today commonly refers to the religious practice of [[Baptism (Mormonism)|baptizing]] a person on behalf of one who is dead—a living person receiving the [[rite]] on behalf of a deceased person.

Baptism for the dead is best known as a doctrine of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], which has practiced it since 1840. It is currently practiced by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), where it is performed only in dedicated [[List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|temples]], as well as in several other current [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|factions]] of the movement. Those who practice this rite view baptism as an essential requirement to enter the [[Kingdom of God]], and therefore practice baptism for the dead to offer it by proxy to those who died without the opportunity to receive it. The LDS Church teaches that those who have died may choose to accept or reject the baptisms done on their behalf.

The modern term itself is derived from a phrase "baptised for the dead" occurring in one verse of the [[New Testament]] ({{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=1 Corinthians|chapter=15|verse=29}}), though the meaning of that phrase is an open question among scholars. Early [[heresiologists]] [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (''Panarion'' 28) and [[Chrysostom]] (''Homilies'' 40) attributed the practice respectively to the [[Cerinthus|Cerinthians]] and to the [[Marcionite]]s, whom they identified as heretical "[[Gnostic]]" groups.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Ferguson ''Baptism in the early church: history, theology, and liturgy ''  2009 p299 "Tertullian twice in an antiheretical context comments on 1 Corinthians 15:29, "baptism for the dead." 4. Later writers say the Marcionites practiced baptism on behalf of the dead. 5. It was also said that they ..."&lt;/ref&gt; For that reason, the practice was forbidden by the early Church, and is therefore not practiced in modern [[mainstream Christianity]], whether [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], or any [[Protestant]] churches.

==Practice==

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
In the practice of  the LDS Church, a living person, acting as proxy, is [[Baptism (Latter Day Saints)|baptized]] by immersion on behalf of a deceased person of the same sex. After giving a short prayer, which includes the name of the deceased individual, the proxy is immersed briefly in the water, then brought up again. Baptism for the dead is an [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] of the church, performed only in [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]], and is based on the belief that baptism is required for entry into the [[Kingdom of God]].&lt;ref name="Gospel Topics: Baptisms for the Dead"/&gt;

===Community of Christ===
Some members of the early [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (RLDS Church; now known as the [[Community of Christ]]) also believed in baptism for the dead,&lt;ref name="centerplace1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerplace.org/library/study/bap4dead.htm |title=Baptism For The Dead |publisher=Centerplace.org |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was never officially sanctioned by that organization and was considered highly controversial.&lt;ref name="centerplace1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerplace.org/library/books/DifferencesThatPersist.pdf |title=Differences That Persist between the RLDS and LDS Churches |format=PDF |publisher= |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a 1970 [[World Conference (Community of Christ)|church world conference]], a [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] and two letters written by [[Joseph Smith]] appertaining to baptism for the dead were removed as sections and placed in the appendix of the RLDS Church's [[Doctrine and Covenants]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerplace.org/hs/dc/rdc-107.htm "Appendix A: Section 107"], [http://www.centerplace.org/hs/dc/rdc-109.htm "Appendix B: Section 109"], [http://www.centerplace.org/hs/dc/rdc-110.htm "Appendix C: Section 110"], [[Doctrine and Covenants]] (RLDS 1970 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; at a 1990 world conference, the three documents were removed entirely from the RLDS Church's scriptural canon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] (RLDS 1990 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Latter Day Saint churches===
In the [[Restoration Branches]] movement, which broke from the RLDS Church in the 1980s, the question of baptism for the dead is at best unsettled. Many adherents reject the validity of the ordinance completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.centerplace.org/rlds/AResponseToPaulTrask.htm |title= A Response to Paul Trask, Part Way To Utah |first=  B.

Other Latter-day Saint denominations that accept baptism for the dead include the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite)]]. The Strangite Church performed baptisms for the dead during the 1840s in [[Voree, Wisconsin]], and later during the 1850s on [[Beaver Island, Michigan]]. In each case, the practice was authorized by on the basis of what [[James J. Strang]] reported as a revelation. The question of whether the Strangite Church still practices proxy baptism is an open one, but belief is considered orthodox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.strangite.org/BaptismDead.htm |title=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints – Mormons – Baptism for the Dead |publisher=Strangite.org |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2012-08-23 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DsxjinaF?url=http://www.strangite.org/BaptismDead.htm |archive-date=2013-01-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Christian churches===
As part of their sacraments, the [[New Apostolic Church]] and the [[Old Apostolic Church]] also practice baptism for the dead, as well as [[Eucharist|Communion]] and Sealing to the Departed. In this practice a proxy or substitute is baptised in the place of an unknown number of deceased persons. According to NAC and OAC doctrine the deceased do not enter the body of the substitute.

===Outside of Christianity===
Outside of Christianity, proxy baptisms were practiced by the [[Mandaeanism|Mandaeans]] of [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tvedtnes|1999|loc=Footnote 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=March 2014|reason=various texts are cited but not quoted}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.mandaeanunion.com/history-english/item/170-brief-history-on-the-mandaeans |at=Mandaen Literature |title= The Mandeans: Their History, Religion, and Mythology |website=MandaeanUnion.com |publisher= Mandaean Society in America |date= 27 March 2013 |accessdate= 2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2014|reason=says nothing of baptism for the dead or even of baptism of the dead}}

==Early Christianity==
Mormon scholar, John A. Tvedtnes says: "Baptism for the dead was performed by the dominant church until forbidden by the sixth canon of the [[Council of Carthage (397)]]. Some of the smaller sects, however, continued the practice."&lt;ref name="Tvedtnes 1977"&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/1977/02/insights/proxy-baptism?lang=eng |title= Proxy Baptism |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= February 1977 |first= John A. |last= Tvedtnes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141202190836/https://www.lds.org/ensign/1977/02/insights/proxy-baptism?lang=eng |archive-date= 2014-12-02 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not give the text of that canon, which, if it is included in what has been called the Code of Canons of the African Church as canon 18, reads: "It also seemed good that the Eucharist should not be given to the bodies of the dead. For it is written: 'Take, Eat', but the bodies of the dead can neither 'take' nor 'eat'. Nor let the ignorance of the presbyters baptize those who are dead."&lt;ref&gt;[http://orthodoxchurchfathers.com/fathers/npnf214/npnf2245.htm#P8034_1634057 Orthodox Church Fathers: Christian Theology Classics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tertullian attributes the practice of 1 Corinthians "baptised for the dead" to the [[Marcionite]]s.&lt;ref name=Marcion5/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2014}}

[[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (between 310–320 – 403) reported that he had heard it said that, among followers of [[Cerinthus]], if one of them died before baptism, another was baptized in that person's name:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For their school reached its height in this country, I mean Asia, and in Galatia as well. And in these countries I also heard of a tradition which said that when some of their people died too soon, without baptism, others would be baptized for them in their names, so that they would not be punished for rising unbaptized at the resurrection and become the subjects of the authority that made the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masseiana.org/panarion_bk1.htm#28 ''Panarion'' 28, 6.4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906041916/http://www.masseiana.org/panarion_bk1.htm |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Chrysostom]] (c. 347–407) mockingly attributes to the [[Marcionites]] of the late 4th century a similar practice: if one of their followers who was [[catechumen|being prepared for baptism]] died before receiving baptism, the dead person's corpse was addressed with the question whether he wished to be baptized, whereupon another answered affirmatively and was baptized for the dead person.&lt;ref name=Homily40&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf112.iv.xli.html#fna_iv.xli-p6.2 |title=John Chrysostom, Homily XL on 1 Corinthians |publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tvedtnes applies the term "baptism ''for'' the dead":
{{Quote|That baptism for the dead was indeed practiced in some [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] Christian circles is indicated by the decisions of two late fourth century councils. The fourth canon of the [[Synod of Hippo]], held in 393, declares, "The Eucharist shall not be given to dead bodies, nor baptism conferred upon them." The ruling was confirmed, Tvedtnes says, four years later in the sixth canon of the [[Third Council of Carthage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tvedtnes|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} the text of which is: "It also seemed good that the Eucharist should not be given to the bodies of the dead. For it is written: 'Take, Eat', but the bodies of the dead can neither 'take' nor 'eat'. Nor let the ignorance of the presbyters baptize those who are dead."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3816.htm "Council of Carthage (A.D.419), Commonly Called The Code of Canons of the African Church", canon 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1 Corinthians 15:29===
In the context of insisting that "in Christ shall all be made alive .. Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul wrote in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:29|KJV}}: "Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?" Different views have been expressed on the meaning of the phrase "baptized for the dead", and on whether Paul gave his approval to the practice.

====Meanings of the verb ''baptizein''====
The Greek verb in Paul's phrase "baptized for the dead" is ''baptizein'', which in Jewish Greek has a wider reference than "baptism", applying primarily to the masculine noun ''baptismos'' "ritual washing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G909&amp;t=KJV |title=masculine noun baptismos 4x NT uses |publisher=Blueletterbible.org |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verb occurs four times in the Septuagint in the context of [[ritual]] washing, ''baptismos'': Judith cleansing herself from menstrual impurity, [[Naaman]] washing seven times to be cleansed from leprosy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Wolff ''Baptism: The Covenant and the Family'' 2009 p45 "This word occurs but four times in the Septuagint, and in no case with the Baptist meaning. 1st. "Judith baptized herself in a fountain of water, by the camp." (Judith xii. 7.) She was then purifying herself from her uncleanness."&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament only, the verb ''baptizein'' can also relate to the neuter noun ''baptisma'' "baptism", a [[neologism]] unknown in the [[Septuagint]] and other pre-Christian Jewish texts.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan David Lawrence ''Washing in Water: Trajectories of Ritual Bathing in the Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Literature'' (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2006), p294&lt;/ref&gt; This broadness in the meaning of ''baptizein'' is reflected in English Bibles rendering "wash", where Jewish ritual washing is meant, for example in Mark 7:4, which states that the Pharisees "except they wash (Greek "baptize"), they do not eat",&lt;ref&gt;ἐὰν μὴ βαπτίσωνται οὐκ ἐσθίουσιν.`&lt;/ref&gt; and "baptize" where ''baptisma'', the new Christian rite, is intended. The older ritual washing use of ''baptizein'' is relevant in the context of funerals since any Jew coming into contact with the dead body must undertake ritual washing.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Wigoder ''The Encyclopedia of Judaism'' 1989 p768 "The dead body renders the house in which it is situated and anyone coming in contact with the body ritually impure, tame met. ... (ritual washing of the body). Any person touching a corpse must wash his hands as soon as possible"&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second Temple]] and early [[Rabbinical]] period the regulations on "ritual washing" (Greek masculine noun ''baptismos'') expanded and multiplied. This is documented in the [[Halakhah]] Tractate Yadayim&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Neusner]] ''The Halakhah: An Encyclopaedia of the Law of Judaism''  2000 "TRACTATE YADAYIM I. AN OUTLINE OF THE HALAKHAH OF YADAYIM The hands are deemed perpetually unclean, a realm of uncleanness — fingertips to wrist — distinct from the rest of the body.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence.''Washing in Water: Trajectories of Ritual Bathing in the Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Literature'' (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2006) chapter ''Dead Sea Scrolls''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Leithart]] (2007) suggests that Paul's comment "why do they.." is an analogy between baptism (i.e. neuter concept noun ''baptisma'') with Jewish ritual washing (i.e. masculine concrete noun ''baptismos'') for contact with the dead following the Mosaic regulations in Numbers 19.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Leithart|Peter J. Leithart]] ''The Baptized Body'' 2007 p136 "Paul uses a distancing third person—"they" baptize for the dead. Why not "we"? Paul might well be referring to Jewish practices. Under the ceremonial laws of Torah, every washing was a washing "for the dead" (cf. Num. 19). Uncleanness was a ceremonial form of death, and through washings of various sorts the unclean dead were restored to life in fellowship with.."&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "ritually washed for the dead" does not occur in [[intertestamental]] literature, but a possibly related idea of [[prayer for the dead]] occurs in [[2 Maccabees]]. Since the New Testament idea of "baptism" (Greek ''baptisma''), the rite of baptism, is not mentioned in the verse, it is open to interpretation whether the verb ''baptizein'' refers to "ritual washing" (Greek ''baptismos'') or "the rite of baptism" (Greek ''baptisma'') or is an analogy between both.&lt;ref&gt;Alan C. Mitchell, [[Daniel J. Harrington]] (2007) ''Hebrews'', p. 119. "2. instruction about cleansings, laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment: The word for "cleansings", baptismos, is not exclusively used for Christian baptism, as is baptisma" ([[BDAG]], 165)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meaning of the phrase====
In his book ''Against Marcion'', [[Tertullian]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; said that the vain practice ("whatever it may have been") to which Paul alluded in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:29|ËSV}} witnessed to belief in bodily resurrection, something that [[Marcion]] denied, and that, in fact, "baptized for the dead" means baptized for the body destined to die and rise again.&lt;ref name=Marcion5&gt;([http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/03125.htm''Against Marcion'' 5, 10]&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat similarly, John Chrysostom explained Paul's mention of people being "baptized for the dead" as a reference to the profession of faith they made in their own [[Resurrection of the dead|future resurrection]] before being baptized.&lt;ref name=Homily40/&gt;

Some interpret "baptized for the dead" as a metaphor for martyrdom, as in {{bibleverse||Mark|10:38}} and {{bibleverse||Luke|12:50}} baptism is a metaphor for suffering or martyrdom; accordingly they would translate it as "being baptized with a view to death".&lt;ref name=Tyndale&gt;Tyndale Bible Dictionary, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-8423-7089-9}}, article ''Baptism for the dead''&lt;/ref&gt; In this interpretation, the phrase is closely linked with what Paul says immediately afterwards&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the suffering that he himself faces and is enabled to endure precisely because of his faith in his resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-r001.html |title=What does the Bible mean when it refers to the "Baptism of the dead?" |publisher=Christiananswers.net |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visualbiblealive.com/resources.php?encyc_id=877&amp;img_id=88150&amp;action=encyclopedia&amp;frame=divEncyc |title='&amp;#39;Baptism for the Dead'&amp;#39; |publisher=Visual Bible Alive |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is similar to that of John Chrysostom.

Others interpret the phrase as referring to simple baptism of an individual. For [[Martin Luther]] it regarded a practice of being baptized ''above'' (the first of the meanings of the preposition ὑπέρ, generally translated in this passage as ''for'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artfl.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.74:7:143.lsj |title=Liddell and Scott: ὑπέρ |publisher=Artfl.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tombs of the dead. [[John Calvin]] saw it as a reference to being baptized when close to death.&lt;ref name=Tyndale/&gt;

Yet another interpretation sees the phrase as referring to vicarious baptism on behalf of dead people performed in the belief that the dead were thereby benefitted in some way. This belief is put forward as the reason why, when Paul compares the Corinthians' experience to that of the Israelites in crossing the Red Sea and being fed on manna, he insists that the Israelites were not thereby prevented from sinning.&lt;ref name=Tyndale/&gt;

====Approved by Paul?====
The Tyndale Bible Dictionary concludes that Paul probably did not approve the practice of baptism for the dead. He refers to its practitioners as "they", not as "you" (the Corinthian Christians to whom he wrote).&lt;ref&gt;Tyndale Bible Dictionary (Tyndale House 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-8423-7089-9}}), P. 146&lt;/ref&gt; The note in the Catholic [[New American Bible]] is more cautious: "Baptized for the dead: this practice is not further explained here, nor is it necessarily mentioned with approval, but Paul cites it as something in their experience that attests in one more way to belief in the resurrection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/1corinthians/1corinthians15.htm |title=New American Bible, note on 1 Corinthians 15:29 |publisher=Usccb.org |date=2011-03-13 |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, it stays close to what [[Tertullian]] wrote in the year 207 or 208, when he said that Paul's only aim in alluding to the practice of baptism for the dead, "whatever it may have been", was "that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such a resurrection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/03125.htm |title=Tertullian, Against Marcion, book V, chapter 10 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other views====
[[Elaine Pagels]] (1992) seeks to explain 1 Corinthians as having reference to the [[Valentinius|Valentinian]] sect later numbered among the "[[Gnostic]]" heresies.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine H. Pagels ''The gnostic Paul: gnostic exegesis of the Pauline letters'' 1992 p83 "Paul now argues his case for the resurrection from the practice of baptism for the dead. ... According to their own sacramental practice, the pneumatic elect receive baptism for "the dead" that is, for the psychics."&lt;/ref&gt; However Pagels view of Paul's epistles is not supported by other scholars.

Joel R. White argues from the context of the passage that 1 Cor 15:29 is referring to the apostles, especially Apollos and Paul himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=White |first1=Joel |title="Baptized on Account of the Dead": The Meaning of 1 Corinthians 15:29 in it's Context |journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |date=1997 |volume=116 |issue=3 |page=487-499}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Mainstream Christian denominations generally do not accept the Latter-day Saint interpretation of "baptism for the dead", mentioned in {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=1 Corinthians|chapter=15|verse=29}}, though a few contemporary Christian churches do practice such an ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Copts|Coptic Christians]]; see: {{harvnb|Tvedtnes|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2012|reason=the source admits not finding evidence of the claimed contemporary Coptic practice, and even as evidence of past Coptic baptism ''for'' the dead cites imaginative pseudepigraphic accounts of baptism ''of'' the dead}}

==LDS Church doctrine==
[[File:Salt Lake temple baptismal font.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Baptismal font in the [[Salt Lake Temple]], circa 1912, where baptisms for the dead are performed by proxy. The font rests on the backs of twelve oxen representing the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]]]]

Members of the LDS Church believe that baptism is a prerequisite for entry into the kingdom of God as stated by [[Jesus]] in {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=John|chapter=3|verse=5}}: "Except that a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" ([[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]]).

The LDS Church teaches that performing baptisms for the dead allows this saving [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] to be offered on behalf of those who have died without accepting or knowing Jesus Christ or his teachings during their mortal lives. It is taught that this is the method by which all who have lived upon the earth will have the opportunity to receive baptism and to thereby enter the Kingdom of God.

Among other Biblical references, Latter-day Saints cite Peter's statements that Jesus preached to the spirits of the dead (KJV 1 Peter 3:19; 4:6) as evidence that God in his justice provides an opportunity for the deceased to hear and accept the gospel, if they don't receive that chance in mortality. As Peter affirmed in Acts 2:37–38, the next step after acceptance of the gospel is baptism for the remission of sins, which "doth also now save us" (KJV 1 Peter 3:21).

The LDS Church teaches that those in the afterlife who have been baptized by proxy are free to accept or reject the ordinance done on their behalf. Baptism on behalf of a deceased individual is not binding if that individual chooses to reject it in the afterlife.&lt;ref name="Gospel Topics: Baptisms for the Dead"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.lds.org/study/topics/baptisms-for-the-dead |title=Baptisms for the Dead |website=Gospel Topics |publisher= [[LDS Church]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202194044/https://www.lds.org/topics/baptisms-for-the-dead?lang=eng |archive-date=2014-12-02 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Condie |first= Spencer J. |author-link= Spencer J.

Any member of the LDS Church, male or female, who is at least 12 years old and holds a current temple recommend may act as a proxy in this ordinance. Men must also hold the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic priesthood]] prior to entering the temple. Men act as proxy for deceased men, and women as proxy for deceased women. The concept of a spiritual proxy is compared by some in the LDS Church to the belief that Jesus acted as proxy for every human when he atoned for the sins of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hinckley |first= Gordon B. |author-link= Gordon B.

Historically, only adult male holders of the [[Melchizedek priesthood (LDS Church)|Melchizedek priesthood]] who had undergone the [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]] ordinance were permitted to baptize others as proxies for the dead. In 2018, this policy was changed to allow boys who hold the [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic priesthood]] office of [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priest]], generally between 16 and 18-years old, to officiate in baptisms for the dead.&lt;ref name = boybaptisms&gt;{{Citation | url = http://kutv.com/news/local/lds-policy-changes-to-allow-youth-to-officiate-assist-in-temple-baptisms|last=Curtis|first = Larry D.| title = LDS policy changes to allow youth to officiate, assist in temple baptisms | work  = | publisher  = KUTV | accessdate = January 11, 2018 | ref = none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern origin===
According to the LDS Church, the practice of baptism for the dead is based on a revelation received by the prophet [[Joseph Smith]]. Smith first taught the doctrine at the funeral sermon of a deceased member of the church, [[Seymour Brunson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Cook| first=Lyndon|author2=Andrew F. Ehat| title=The Words of Joseph Smith |date=June 1991| publisher=Grandin Book Co.| isbn=0-910523-39-8 | page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter written on October 19, 1840, to the church's [[Quorum of the Twelve|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] (who were on a mission in the United Kingdom at the time), Smith refers to the passage in {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=1 Corinthians|chapter=15|verse=29}} (KJV):
{{cquote|I presume the doctrine of 'baptism for the dead' has ere this reached your ears, and may have raised some inquiries in your minds respecting the same. I cannot in this letter give you all the information you may desire on the subject; but aside from knowledge independent of the Bible, I would say that it was certainly practiced by the ancient churches; and Saint Paul endeavors to prove the doctrine of the resurrection from the same, and says, 'Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?'&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''4''':231.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

LDS Church [[Standard Works|scripture]] expands further upon this doctrine and states that such baptisms are to be performed in [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Covenant 124|verse=29}}, {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Covenant 127|verse=5|range=-10}} and {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Covenant 128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vicarious baptism is performed in connection with other vicarious ordinances in temples of the LDS Church, such as the [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]] and [[celestial marriage]].

Initially, women could be baptized for dead men, and vice versa; this, however, was changed in order to ensure that the person being baptized for a dead man could also be ordained on their behalf to the priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;Brigham Young (August 31, 1873), ''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' '''16''':160.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genealogy and baptism===
The LDS Church teaches that deceased persons who have not accepted, or had the opportunity to accept, the gospel of Christ in this life will have such opportunity in the afterlife. The belief is that as all must follow Jesus Christ, they must also receive all the ordinances that a living person is expected to receive, including baptism. For this reason, members of the LDS Church are encouraged to research their [[genealogy]]. This research is then used as the basis for church performing temple ordinances for as many deceased persons as possible. As a part of these efforts, [[Mormons]] have performed temple ordinances on behalf of a number of high-profile people, including the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]],&lt;ref name=WW1&gt;{{Citation | author = [[Wilford Woodruff]]| publication-date = 1878 | title = The Journal of Discourses of Brigham Young, His Counselors, and the Twelve Apostles | volume = 19 | publisher = William Budge | editor = D.

While members of the LDS Church consider vicarious ordinances for the deceased a great service, some non-members have taken offense. Sensitive to the issue of proxy baptizing for non-Mormons not related to church members, the church in recent years has published a general policy of performing temple ordinances only for relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url  = https://familysearch.org/platform/ordinances/policy |title = FamilySearch : Who you can do ordinances for}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the church is in the process of removing sensitive names (such as Jewish Holocaust victims) from its [[International Genealogical Index]] (IGI). [[D. Todd Christofferson]] of the church's [[Quorums of the Seventy#Presidency of the Seventy|Presidency of the Seventy]] stated that removing the names is an "ongoing, labor intensive process requiring name-by-name research .... When the Church is made aware of documented concerns, action is taken .... Plans are underway to refine this process."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Mormons Renew Their Vow to Stop Baptizing Deceased Jews

In 2008, a directive from the Vatican [[Congregation for the Clergy]] directed Catholic dioceses to prevent the LDS Church from "microfilming and digitizing information" contained in Catholic sacramental registers so that those whose names were contained therein would not be subjected to vicarious Mormon baptism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://genealogy.about.com/b/2008/05/05/vatican-orders-catholic-parish-registers-off-limits-to-lds-church.htm |title= Vatican Orders Catholic Parish Registers Off-Limits to LDS Church |first= Kimberly |last= Powell |date= May 5, 2008 |work= Genealogy.

===Jewish Holocaust victims===

The LDS Church performs vicarious baptisms for individuals regardless of their race, sex, creed, religion, or morality.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Some members of the LDS Church have been baptized for both victims and perpetrators of [[The Holocaust]], including [[Anne Frank]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], contrary to church policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title=Wiesel to Mormon Church: stop proxy baptisms of Jews|author=MSNBC's The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell| year=2012| url=http://video.msnbc.msn.com/the-last-word/46407233#46407233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Jew]]ish Holocaust survivors and some Jewish organizations have objected to this practice.

Since the early 1990s, the LDS Church has urged members to submit the names of only their own ancestors for ordinances, and to request permission of surviving family members of people who have died within the past 95 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://www.lds.org/manual/members-guide-to-temple-and-family-history-work |title= Member's Guide to Temple and Family History Work |year= 2012 |chapter-url= http://www.lds.org/manual/members-guide-to-temple-and-family-history-work/chapter-7-providing-temple-ordinances |chapter= Chapter 7: Providing Temple Ordinances |publisher= LDS Church |pages= 29–36 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141202194659/https://www.lds.org/manual/members-guide-to-temple-and-family-history-work/chapter-7-providing-temple-ordinances |archive-date= 2014-12-02 |dead-url= no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of thousands of improperly submitted names not adhering to this policy have been removed from the records of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Mormons, Jews Set Up Group to Study Concerns |journal= [[Meridian Magazine]] |year= 2005 |url= http://www.meridianmagazine.com/churchupdate/050412study.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100207065406/http://meridianmagazine.com/churchupdate/050412study.html |archivedate= 2010-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Church [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Boyd K. Packer]] has stated the church has been open about its practice of using public records to further temple ordinance work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Packer |first= Boyd K |authorlink= Boyd K. Packer  |title= [[The Holy Temple]] |year= 1980 |publisher= [[Bookcraft]] |isbn= 0-88494-411-5 |page= 266 |quote= For a number of years the Church had negotiated with the government of Israel for permission to microfilm the archives of that nation. These records, including many carefully kept genealogies, are priceless records of the human family and have a tie to great events in the history of the world. The officials had learned all they wanted to know about the Church storage procedures and were impressed. They insisted however that someone be sent to talk to them about the doctrine relating to our desire for their records. They wanted to know why we wanted their records. In 1977 I received the assignment to go to Israel and meet with their official archivists and scholars on the matter .... I explained to them our great interest in the Old Testament and our kinship with Israel. We talked of family, of patriarchal lineage and blessings. We talked of the doctrine of agency. But all of these things were not central to the point. It might seem that in order to obtain a favorable decision we would have to be 'diplomatic' and not mention ordinances—especially baptism. But we were on the Lord's errand, and so I told them—plainly, bluntly—that we desired their records in order to provide baptism, Christian baptism, for their forebears and for ours. The reaction was immediate and intense. The meeting thereafter was most interesting! We came away uncertain as to the outcome. But we were on the Lord's errand. We were serving the work of redemption for the dead. We had told the truth without any shade of misrepresentation. In due time the answer came. We received approval to microfilm and preserve those records which were sanctified by the suffering of our brethren of the house of Israel.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the guidelines, some members of the church have submitted names without adequate permission. In December 2002, independent researcher Helen Radkey published a report showing that, following a 1995 promise from the church to remove Jewish Holocaust victims from its International Genealogical Index, the church's database included the names of about 19,000 who had a 40 to 50 percent chance "to be Holocaust victims ... in Russia, Poland, France, and Austria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jewishgen.org/infofiles/ldsagree.html|title= The Issue of The Mormon Baptisms of Jewish Holocaust Victims and Other Jewish Dead: Mormons Hijack Dead or Alive Jewish Souls |accessdate=2009-01-27 |author = Bernard I.

Church official [[D. Todd Christofferson]] told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the church expends massive amounts of resources attempting to purge improperly submitted names, but that it is not feasible to expect the church to find each and every last one, and that the agreement in 1995 did not place this type of responsibility on the centralized church leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Urbina| first=Ian| title=Again, Jews Fault Mormons Over Posthumous Baptisms |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/21/nyregion/again-jews-fault-mormons-over-posthumous-baptisms.html | work=The New York Times| date=2003-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish groups, including the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], spoke out against the vicarious baptism of Holocaust perpetrators and victims in the mid-1990s and again in the 2000s when they discovered the practice, which they consider insensitive to the living and the dead, was continuing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/West/12/10/baptizing.the.dead.ap/ |title= Mormons meet with Jews over baptizing Holocaust victims |publisher= CNN.com |date= December 11, 2002 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20041012121102/http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/West/12/10/baptizing.the.dead.ap/ |archivedate= 2004-10-12 |quote= Vicarious baptism had even been performed for Simon Wiesenthal himself after his death. The Center found the practice insulting and an affront to Jews who died because of their religion. Rabbi Marvin Hier of the center said: 'If these people did not contact the Mormons themselves, the adage should be: Don't call me, I'll call you. With the greatest of respect to them, we do not think they are the exclusive arbitrators of who is saved.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |journal= National Post |date= June 6, 2001 |first= Jan |last= Cienski |quote= Aaron Breitbart, a researcher with the Center believes the church was showing insensitivity to the living and their dead ancestors. 'They did not get baptized when they were alive and they had a choice, and doing so after they are dead is beyond the ethical bounds.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Abraham Cooper, complained that infamous figures such as Adolf Hitler and [[Eva Braun]] appeared on LDS genealogical records: "Whether official or not, the fact remains that this is exactly the kind of activity that enraged and hurt, really, so many victims of the Holocaust and caused alarm in the Jewish community."&lt;ref name=Thiessen_2005-04-09/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |newspaper= The Salt Lake Tribune |date= October 9, 1999 |first= Bob |last= Mims}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors and their Descendants|American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors]] announced that, since church members had repeatedly violated previous agreements, it would no longer negotiate with the church to try to prevent vicarious baptism. Speaking on the anniversary of [[Kristallnacht]], Ernest Michel, a Holocaust survivor who reported on the [[Nuremberg Trials]], speaking as the honorary chairman of the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors, called on the LDS Church to "implement a mechanism to undo what [they] have done", and declared that the LDS Church had repeatedly violated their agreements, and that talks with Mormon leaders were now ended. Jewish groups, he said, would now turn to the court of public opinion for justice.&lt;ref name="Hajela"&gt;{{cite news |first= Deepti|last= Hajela|author2=Jennifer Dobner |title= Jewish group wants Mormons to stop proxy baptisms|agency= Associated Press|page= |date=11 November 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-11|quote= |url= http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j9l-R1TIM_X5myzSoEzLN7QnqdSwD94C9QH80}}{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michel called the practice a revision of history that plays into the hands of [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]], stating: "They tell me, that my parents' Jewishness has not been altered but ... 100 years from now, how will they be able to guarantee that my mother and father of blessed memory who lived as Jews and were slaughtered by Hitler for no other reason than they were Jews, will someday not be identified as Mormon victims of the Holocaust?"&lt;ref name="Hajela"/&gt;

Church officials, in response, stated that the church does not teach that vicarious baptisms coerce deceased persons to become Mormons, nor does the church add those names to its list of church members.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/background-explanation-of-temple-baptism |type=Press release |title=Background Explanation of Temple Baptism |work=Newsroom |publisher=LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=D.

Church officials stated in 2008 that a new version of the [[FamilySearch]] application had been developed and was being implemented in an effort to prevent the submission of Holocaust victim names for temple ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Buddy |last=Blankenfeld|title=Jewish group at odds with LDS Church over temple work for ancestors|work=ABC 4 News|date=11 November 2008|accessdate=2008-11-11|url=http://www.abc4.com/content/about_4/links_numbers/story.aspx?content_id=d1c20f95-896e-4cc0-a5d3-52dd7d9f5467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the issue re-emerged after it was found that the parents of Holocaust survivor and Jewish rights advocate [[Simon Wiesenthal]] were added to the genealogical database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mormons baptise parents of Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal|work=BBC News|date=15 February 2012|accessdate=2012-02-16|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17036046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, news stories announced that [[Anne Frank]] had been baptized by proxy for the ninth time, at the [[Santo Domingo Dominican Republic Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Mormon Baptism Targets Anne Frank—Again|work= Huffington Post|date=21 February 2012 |accessdate=2012-03-03|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/21/mormons-posthumous-baptism-anne-frank_n_1292102.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Drummond's Island''' was a conflict between the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] and the village of [[Utiroa]] on April 1841 at Drummond's Island, which is now named [[Tabiteuea]]. &lt;ref&gt;Ellsworth, pp. 72–74&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of the conflict was the disappearance of the American seaman John Anderson, who was suspected to have been murdered by the village natives. In retaliation, the members of the expedition killed twelve of the natives and burned the village to the ground. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.b3007323|title=Narrative of the United States exploring expedition.

== Background ==
The USS ''Peacock'' was commanded by Lieutenant [[William L. Hudson]], the commander of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]]. [[Charles Wilkes]] had ordered Hudson to explore [[Tabiteuea|Drummond's Island]], named after a member of the expedition. Lieutenant Hudson learned from a member of his crew that a merchant ship had wrecked on a reef off the island's northwest coast years before. Most of its crew were massacred, except for a "white woman"{{cn|date=October 2018}} and a child, who was supposed to still be alive.{{cn|date=October 2018}} On April 6, the ''Peacock'' anchored off [[Utiroa]] on Drummond's Island. Hudson went ashore with a couple of Navy officers, a marine detachment, as well as the [[Office of Naval Research|Scientific Corps]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Initially, the natives were described as calm and peaceful;{{whom|date=October 2018}} they led the Americans to their village center. {{lang|gil|Tabiteuea}} means "land of no chiefs"{{cn|date=October 2018}} in [[Gilbertese language|Gilbertese]],{{cn|date=October 2018}} and the natives themselves practiced [[egalitarianism]],{{cn|date=October 2018}} which meant the Americans had no [[tribal chief]], or leader, to consult with.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Utiroa was said to be where the massacre had taken place. Other than studying the flora and fauna of the island, Hudson wanted to inquire about the shipwreck and the stranded woman and child. The natives spoke nothing of the incident but "parts of the vessel were found"{{cn|date=October 2018}} inside the village's huts, though most of the buildings were deemed off-limits.&lt;ref name="Ellsworth_72-73"&gt;Ellsworth, pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

The Americans returned to their ship after several hours but returned the next day, April 7. All was well until Lieutenant Hudson and his men were on their way back to the ''Peacock''. They noticed that a member of the procession, seaman John Anderson, was missing.{{cn|date=October 2018}} A search was undertaken which went unnoticed by the Gilbertese, who appeared to be arming themselves with swords, spears, and other weapons.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Eventually, the search was discontinued. As the Americans were boarding their [[captain's gig|gig]] and armed boats, the natives tried to surround the sailors and marines. The natives threw rocks and waved their weapons as the boats shoved off. No one was harmed; Lieutenant Hudson decided to wait for Anderson until April 9, by which time the {{USS|Flying Fish|1838|6}} had arrived.&lt;ref name="Ellsworth_72-73"/&gt;

== Battle ==
After it became apparent that the sailor would not return, Hudson attacked the town to administer punishment against the natives.{{cn|date=October 2018}} About eighty marines and sailors under Lieutenant William M. Walker of the [[US Marines|Marine Corps]] were divided into three sections and landed at daylight. Meanwhile, the ''Peacock'' maneuvered into firing position off Utiroa and the ''Flying Fish'' covered the landing of men in seven boats. In case the landing party was overwhelmed, the schooner would provide covering fire and rescue the survivors.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[File:Drummonds Island warrior by Agate.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Warrior drawn by Alfred Agate]]
Around 700 Gilbertese warriors were dancing in the jungle near the beach and as the boats pulled in, Lieutenant Walker demanded they let Seaman Anderson go. However, the demand was ignored and the natives entered the water and headed for the boats, forcing them to retreat for a small distance. After this Walker turned his boats around and opened fire with a rocket at the mass of warriors.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He then ordered his men to begin volley fire and devastated the natives according to the ''Peacock''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s log book. A little while later the natives "fled to the bush"{{cn|date=October 2018}} so the American vessels pulled in close to shore, within "pistol shot"{{cn|date=October 2018}} range. Then the landing was made.&lt;ref&gt;Ellsworth, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gilbertese were not gone for long. Many returned to defend their villages and they unsuccessfully skirmished with Americans for hours. When all the buildings of Utiroa were burned, Walker and his men moved on to another nearby village and destroyed it as well.{{cn|date=October 2018}} They then tried to inquire about the shipwrecked survivors but again nothing was uncovered so Lieutenant Walker led his men back to the boats.

There were no American combat casualties, but the armed boats were damaged in some way during the action, and they were repaired aboard USS ''Peacock'' as she sailed to rejoin Commander Wilkes in the sloop-of-war {{USS|Vincennes|1826|6}} with the USS ''Flying Fishing'' company. Twelve islanders were killed in the fighting and others were wounded.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Later during the expedition, the ''Peacock'' sank without loss of life in July 1841, while sailing into the mouth of the [[Columbia River]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellsworth, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lychnophora ericoides - Arnica do campo, candeia.jpg|thumb|''[[Lychnophora]] ericoides'' in the campos rupestres [[habitat]].]]
The '''campos rupestres''' ("rocky fields") is an [[terrestrial ecoregion|ecoregion]] of the [[montane]] [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|subtropical savanna]] [[biome]], located in eastern [[Brazil]]. It is situated within the South American [[Atlantic Forest]], and borders the [[Cerrado]] subtropical savanna ecoregion.

==Geography==

The Portuguese term ''campos rupestres'' means "rocky fields", but is used to describe the shrubby savanna vegetation that grows in this habitat.
It is found at elevations from {{convert|700|to|2000|m}}.
It is known for high levels of endemism at the genus and species levels.{{sfn|Maria}}
The [[Köppen climate classification]] is "Cwa": warm temperate, dry winter, hot summer.{{sfn|Campos Rupestres montane savanna – Myers|loc=Climate Data}}

The ecoregion consists of a series of relatively small and isolated grasslands in the [[Espinhaço Mountains]] of eastern Brazil, surrounded by lowland and montane forests.{{sfn|Campos Rupestres montane savanna – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}
It also forms discontinuous enclaves in the [[Mantiqueira Mountains]] and the [[Serra dos Órgãos]] range. They are found in the states of [[Bahia]], [[Espírito Santo]], [[Minas Gerais]], and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]].

The soil of the [[Serra do Cachimbo]] in the [[Mato Grosso tropical dry forests]] ecoregion is white sand.
It has an extensive region of campos rupestres.{{sfn|Locklin}}

==Natural history==

===Flora===

The campos rupestres ecoregion consists of open plant formations subject to drought growing on rocks that do not retain water.
In appearance it is similar to savanna, but the flora are different with species such as ''[[Calea lutea]]'' and others that are found in [[caatinga]] forest.{{sfn|Locklin}}
This montane savanna ecoregion is a chief center of biodiversity in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Cactaceae]].{{sfn|Hogan|2011}}
A large percentage of South American Cactaceae species are present within the campos rupestres.

===Fauna===
Indigenous mammals include [[Brazilian Tapir|tapir]]s, [[capybara]]s, [[bush dog]]s, and [[armadillo]]s.
Indigenous [[reptile]]s include [[crocodile]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[tortoise]]s and [[iguana]]s.
The [[riparian zone]]s offer habitat for birds, reptiles, and mammals that require more water than the plateau species.

Endangered mammals include [[fossorial giant rat]] (''Kunsia fronto''), [[orange-brown Atlantic tree-rat]] (''Phyllomys brasiliensis'') and [[giant otter]] (''Pteronura brasiliensis'').
Endangered amphibians include Izecksohn's treefrog (''[[Bokermannohyla izecksohni]]'') and the reticulate leaf frog (''[[Phyllomedusa ayeaye]]'') .
Endangered birds include [[Brazilian merganser]] (''Mergus octosetaceus'') and [[yellow-bellied seedeater]] (''Sporophila nigricollis'').{{sfn|Campos Rupestres montane savanna – Myers|loc=All Endangered}}

==Conservation and threats==

The campos rupestres ecoregion is well-preserved, but only 5% is protected by federal conservation units, mostly in the Serra do Cipó and Serra do Sincorá of the Espinhaço Range.
The main threats come from mining, extraction of native plants for ornamental use, cattle ranching, fires, tourism and urban expansion.
The ecoregion is altered by changes to the surrounding forests, which are being forested and cleared for pasturage, and by burning of savannas.{{sfn|Maria}}

'''The China Energy Research Report''' (hereafter referred to as the Report) is one of the leading works of Prof. Yi-Ming Wei’s team in the [[China CEEP|Center of Energy &amp; Environmental Policy Research]]. The Report is a publication of series in every two years with a specific theme at one time, based on China’s critical energy strategies, aiming to provide scientific and technical support for public and private policy decisions. 2014 saw the release of its fifth installment.

==Summary of Released Reports==
* China Energy Report (2006): Strategy and Policy Research
* China Energy Report (2008): CO2 Emissions Research
* China Energy Report (2010): Energy Efficiency Research
* China Energy Report (2012): Energy Security Research
* China Energy Report (2014): Energy Poverty Research

==Review of Released Reports==

===China Energy Report (2014): Energy Poverty Research===
The 2014 Report is the fifth in a series of such reports. It is based on the fact that China, as the largest developing country, has been challenged with the more serious and more complicated energy poverty issue. This report reviews and summarizes the tools and methods of evaluating the global energy poverty, then establishes an indicator system of measuring and assessing China’s energy poverty from a temporal and spatial perspective. Besides, many critical issues like the relations between energy poverty and economic growth, climate change and energy accessibility, clean energy and energy poverty, solid fuels and health, policies and acts on energy poverty elimination, are also discussed in this Report.

===China Energy Report (2012): Energy Security Research===
China has been more relying on the import of fossil fuels since 2009 soon after China became the biggest energy consumer and second largest oil importer, giving rise to more crisis and risks. Under such circumstances, the 2012 Report systematically discusses a series of topics pertaining to energy security, such as the complexity of the global energy market, risks assessment of China’s energy import, policies for strategic energy reserves, energy crisis and China’s economic growth, renewables and energy poverty, the environmental and health effects of energy consumption, energy conservation potentials for key sectors and regions, energy supply security warning and studies of international energy security.

===China Energy Report (2010): Energy Efficiency Research===
Energy, followed by CO2 emissions, is not only an environmental problem, but recognized as an economic, political and social strategic issue. In a global path of sustainable development, it is aware that achieving energy conservation as well as energy efficiency improvements is one of the most important and effective way to address climate change and energy challenges.
The 2010 Report proposes the connotation as well as the measurements of energy efficiency based on a comprehensive study of international energy situation. It is well extended to several analyses such as the effects of economic structure on the macro energy efficiency, the difference between urban and rural residential energy consumption and characteristics of regional residential energy consumption, energy efficiency of major industries and sectors, the effects of fuel price on oil demand, energy efficiency policy design and simulation.

===China Energy Report (2008): CO2 Emissions Research===
The global climate change has posed a hard question of how to use fossil fuels wisely to human beings. In this context, the 2008 Report focuses on energy use and CO2 emissions. the characteristics of China’s energy consumption and CO2 emissions, factors of CO2 emissions under different economic growth levels, the emissions trajectory of China’s carbon-intensive sectors and regions, global carbon market, mitigation technologies and policies.

===China Energy Report (2006): Strategy and Policy Research===
Energy has been considered as, the same as labor and capital, a basic productive factor and strategic resource. The 2006 Report, the first installment of the series, focuses on China’s energy strategies and management and provides implications according to different policy portfolios.

The city of Zion was founded by Dowie as a religious community to establish a society on the principles of the [[Kingdom of God]].&lt;ref name=CCChist&gt;[http://www.ccczion.org/history/history.htm The History of Christ Community Church] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822023459/http://www.ccczion.org/history/history.htm |date=August 22, 2006 }}, accessed June 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Members are sometimes called Zionites (not to be confused with the [[Zionites (Germany)|German Zionites]]).&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;"Christian Catholic Church".

Over the years there have been many changes to the church founded by John Alexander Dowie. He was a popular [[faith healer]] and started the church and the Zion community with utopian ideals. Under [[Wilbur Glenn Voliva]], Dowie's successor, the church was noted for its adherence to a [[flat earth]] cosmology. The succession of pastors after Voliva moved the church back to mainstream Protestant doctrine.

In the early 20th century, the Christian Catholic Church had worldwide appeal. The church's magazine, ''The Leaves of Healing'', was distributed in the U.S., Australia, Europe, and southern Africa. At its height, Dowie's movement had some 20,000 adherents.&lt;ref name=Blumhofer31-34&gt;Blumhofer, Edith L.

Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994 pp. 499–505, 520-521, 537-538&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Dowie's emphasis on faith healing and [[Christian primitivism|restorationism]] the church is considered a forerunner of [[Pentecostalism]].&lt;ref name=Blumhofer31-34/&gt;

The name Christian Catholic Church is still used for Christ Community Church's worldwide fellowship of churches and mission work.&lt;ref name=CCChist/&gt; As of 2008, it has about 3,000 members in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt; Missionary work is conducted in Japan, Philippines, Guyana, Palestine, Indonesia, and the Navajo Nation.&lt;ref name=CCCmissions&gt;[http://www.ccczion.org/missions/missions.htm World Missions at Christ Community Church] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124013617/http://www.ccczion.org/missions/missions.htm |date=January 24, 2010 }}, accessed June 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Missionary work continues among the African Zionists under the banner of Zion Evangelical Ministries of Africa (ZEMA).

== John Alexander Dowie ==
{{main article|John Alexander Dowie}}
John Alexander Dowie was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, May 25, 1847, to an evangelical family. The family emigrated to Australia in 1860, with Dowie returning to attend the University of Edinburgh from 1867 to 1872, at which time he once more sailed for Australia. In 1876 Dowie married and he began his evangelistic ministry three years later in [[Melbourne]].

Dowie emigrated to [[San Francisco]] in 1888 where he founded the Ministry of Divine Healing. After years of traveling across the country preaching and healing, he finally settled in Chicago and in 1893 set up a tabernacle at the World's Columbian Exposition. During the next seven years, Dowie founded the Christian Catholic Church that met in several city locations including the Chicago Auditorium (1896). In 1900 he purchased land along the shores of Lake Michigan, north of Chicago near the Illinois–Wisconsin border and founded a religious utopian community that he called [[Zion, Illinois|Zion]].

He also founded a commercial enterprise, which came to be called Zion Industries, to support the community. Initially its main product was Scottish lace and it enjoyed considerable success.

Dowie proselytized vigorously both in person and by means of several serial publications, chief among them being [http://leavesofhealing.googlepages.com ''Leaves of Healing,''] and gained a lot of adherents. At its height in 1905, the church claimed some 30,000 members worldwide, of whom some 7500 settled in Zion. Two notable features of Dowie's preaching were [[faith healing]] and what he called holy living—his followers were admonished to abstain from tobacco, alcohol, pork products, doctors and medicines, the "apostate churches", etc.

Dowie had progressive views on race relations for his day and welcomed blacks into his church, of whom some 200 settled in Zion. He later sent some of them as missionaries to South Africa, where they established [[Zionist Churches|churches]] that became very influential.

As the community of Zion grew in size and prosperity, Dowie adopted an increasingly lavish lifestyle, building himself a 25-room mansion and dressing himself in ornate ecclesiastical robes modeled after those worn by Aaron, the high priest, described in Leviticus. Due to this and other financial mismanagement, the church was threatened with bankruptcy. In 1905 Dowie suffered the first of a series of debilitating strokes. In 1906 his followers revolted, ousted him from leadership and elected [[Wilbur Glenn Voliva]] as the new leader of the church. A splinter group rejected the new leadership, left Zion, and some of them went on to become influential leaders of the budding [[Pentecostal]] movement. Dowie died of another stroke on March 9, 1907.

A bizarre sidelight on Dowie's later years is that he became embroiled in an acrimonious public dispute with a controversial Indian Muslim religious figure, [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], founder of the [[Ahmadiyya]] movement. In 1903 they engaged in a widely publicized ''prayer duel,'' each calling upon God to punish the other to expose him as a false prophet. Ahmad and his followers proclaimed Dowie's rapidly ensuing illness, disgrace, and death as a vindication of their religious beliefs. Ahmad died in 1908, a year later than Dowie.

== Wilbur Glenn Voliva ==
{{main article|Wilbur Glenn Voliva}}
Wilbur Glenn Voliva succeeded Dowie as General Overseer of Zion in 1906 and renamed the church to "Christian Catholic Apostolic Church". He kept tight control on his some 6000 followers, which made up the community, even up to the point of dictating their choice of marriage partners. All real estate in Zion, while sold at market rates, was conveyed under an 1100-year lease, subject to many restrictions and subject to termination at the whim of the General Overseer. Religions other than the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church were effectively banned - visiting preachers from rival sects were harassed and hounded out of town by the city police force.

He diversified Zion Industries to include a bakery which produced the popular Zion brand fig bar cookies and White Dove chocolates. Zion was a one company town and its workers were paid substandard wages.

A strict code of morality was imposed in the town on all persons who set foot inside city limits. It was unlawful for women to wear short dresses, high heels, bathing suits or lipstick. Ham, bacon, oysters, liquor and tobacco were banned, as were drugstores, medical buildings, movie theaters, and globes (as they challenged Voliva's flat-earth cosmology). A ten o'clock curfew was rigidly enforced. You could be arrested for whistling on Sunday. These laws were enforced by Voliva's police force, called the Praetorian Guard, whose helmets carried the word 'PATIENCE' and whose sleeves bore images of doves. Policemen wore Bibles and clubs on their belts.

Voliva gained a lot of nationwide notoriety by his vigorous advocacy of flat earth doctrine. He offered a widely publicized $5000 challenge for anyone to disprove flat earth theory, but on terms of his own choosing. The church schools in Zion taught the flat earth doctrine. His 5,000 watt radio station, [[WCPT (AM)|WCBD]], broadcast his diatribes against round earth astronomy, and the evils of evolution.

Like his predecessor Dowie, Voliva increasingly developed an overtly lavish lifestyle, which began to alienate his followers, especially after the hardships brought on by the [[Great Depression]], which forced the town's sole employer, Zion Industries, into bankruptcy. In 1935 Voliva tried to revive the flagging fortunes of the church by instituting the annual Zion Passion Play, along the lines of the famous one in [[Oberammergau Passion Play|Oberammergau]]. However, in 1937 a disgruntled employee set the church's huge Shiloh Tabernacle, where the play took place, ablaze. Shortly thereafter, Voliva was forced into [[personal bankruptcy]]. In 1942 after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, Voliva made a tearful public confession to his followers that he had misappropriated church funds for his personal use and committed other misdeeds. Shortly thereafter on October 11, 1942 he died, and the church all but dissolved.

A small remnant was reorganized under the leadership of Michael Mintern but a second fire destroyed the Zion Auditorium in April 11, 1959. At this time the Robson family from England were living in an apartment in the building. They were out of the building at the time. Had they been at home they would have perished, as the fire appliances were not able to reach the fourth floor. This was felt to be God's provision as He kept them out of the building that day. The church in Zion was later renamed to Christ Community Church.

'''Cloud iridescence''' or '''irisation''' is a [[iridescence|colorful]] [[optical phenomenon]] that occurs in a [[cloud]] and appears in the general proximity of the [[Sun]] or [[Moon]]. The colors resemble those seen in [[soap bubble]]s and oil on a water surface. It is a type of [[photometeor]]. This fairly common phenomenon is most often observed in [[altocumulus cloud|altocumulus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gedzelman |first=Stanley David |title=In Praise of Altocumulus |journal=Weatherwise |date=1 June 1988 |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=143–49 |doi=10.1080/00431672.1988.9930533}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cirrocumulus cloud|cirrocumulus]], [[lenticular cloud|lenticular]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/irisation-meteorology Answers.com - Sci-Tech Dictionary:irisation]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cirrus cloud]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite APOD |date=25 November 2007 |title=An Iridescent Cloud Over Colorado |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/irid1.htm |title=Iridescent Clouds |publisher= Atmospheric Optics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sassen |first=Kenneth |title= Cirrus cloud iridescence: a rare case study |journal= Applied Optics |date=1 January 2003 |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=486 |doi= 10.1364/AO.42.000486 |bibcode= 2003ApOpt..42..486S}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes appear as bands parallel to the edge of the clouds. Iridescence is also seen in the much rarer [[polar stratospheric cloud]]s, also called nacreous clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/nacr1.htm |title= Nacreous Clouds |publisher=Atmospheric Optics}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The colors are usually [[pastel (color)|pastel]], but can be very [[colorfulness|vivid]] or mingled together, sometimes similar to [[mother-of-pearl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tierra.rediris.es/megacryometeors/photometeors.pdf '''PHOTOMETEORS''', by Jesús Martínez-Frías] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213022627/http://tierra.rediris.es/megacryometeors/photometeors.pdf |date=2009-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When appearing near the Sun, the effect can be difficult to spot as it is drowned in the Sun's glare. This may be overcome by shielding the [[sunlight]] with one's hand or hiding it behind a tree or building. Other aids are dark glasses, or observing the sky reflected in a [[convex mirror]] or in a pool of water.

==Etymology==
Irisations are named after the Greek goddess [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], goddess of [[rainbow]]s and messenger of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]] to the mortals below.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MAiKY4xU6y8C&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=Cloud+iridescence+Irisation&amp;lr= The '''Cloudspotter's Guide''' By Gavin Pretor-Pinney, Page 233]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Mechanism==
Iridescent clouds are a [[diffraction]] phenomenon caused by small [[drop (liquid)|water droplets]] or small [[ice crystals]] individually [[light scattering by particles|scattering light]]. Larger ice crystals do not produce iridescence, but can cause [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halos]], a different phenomenon.

Irisation is caused by very uniform water droplets [[diffraction|diffracting]] light (within 10 degrees from the [[Sun]]) and by first order [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] effects&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4Abp5FdhskAC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=Cloud+iridescence+Irisation&amp;lr= '''Color and Light in Nature''' By David K. Lynch, William Charles Livingston, Page 133]&lt;/ref&gt; (Beyond about 10 degrees from the Sun). It can extend up to 40 degrees from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tierra.rediris.es/megacryometeors/photometeors.pdf '''PHOTOMETEORS''', by Jesús Martínez-Frías] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213022627/http://tierra.rediris.es/megacryometeors/photometeors.pdf |date=2009-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If parts of clouds contain small water droplets or ice crystals of similar size, their cumulative effect is seen as colors. The cloud must be optically thin, so that most rays encounter only a single droplet. Iridescence is therefore mostly seen at cloud edges or in semi-[[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] clouds, while newly forming clouds produce the brightest and most colorful iridescence. When the particles in a thin cloud are very similar in size over a large extent, the iridescence takes on the structured form of a [[corona (optical phenomenon)|corona]], a bright circular disk around the Sun or Moon surrounded by one or more colored rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/corona.htm |title=Corona |publisher=Atmospheric Optics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shaw |first1=Joseph A. |last2=Pust |first2= Nathan |title= Icy wave-cloud lunar corona and cirrus iridescence |journal=Applied Optics |date=12 August 2011 |volume=50 |issue=28 |pages=F6 |doi= 10.1364/AO.50.0000F6 |bibcode= 2011ApOpt..50F...6S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cocobolo chess pieces.jpg|thumb|300px|Chess pieces made of cocobolo]]

'''Cocobolo''' is a [[tropical]] [[hardwood]] of [[Central America]]n trees&lt;ref name=woodmag /&gt; belonging to the genus ''[[Dalbergia]]''. Only the [[heartwood]] of cocobolo is used; it is usually orange or reddish-brown, often with darker irregular traces weaving through the wood. The heartwood changes color after being cut, and can be polished to a lustrous, glassy finish; being quite dense, some has a [[specific gravity]] of over 1.0, and will sink in water. The [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] (not often used) is a creamy yellow, with a sharp boundary between it and the heartwood.

==Provenance==
Cocobolo is yielded by two to four closely related species of the genus ''[[Dalbergia]]'', of which the best known is ''[[Dalbergia retusa]]'', a fair-sized tree, reported to reach {{convert|75|–|80|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|3|ft|m|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in diameter&lt;ref name=woodmag /&gt;; it probably is the species contributing most of the wood in the trade. Because of the high value of the timber, the trees yielding it have been heavily exploited, so they have become rare outside of national parks, reserves, and plantations. Only relatively small amounts of this prized wood reach the world market, and it is expensive.

==Oil content==
Cocobolo heartwood contains oil, which lends a strong, unmistakable floral odor even to well seasoned wood and occasionally stains the hands with prolonged exposure. The high natural oil content of the wood makes it difficult to achieve a strong glue joint, as in applying [[Wood veneer|veneer]]s or guitar fingerboards, and can inhibit the curing of some varnishes, particularly oil-based finishes. Acetone may be used to remove surface oils before gluing.&lt;ref name=woodmag&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.woodmagazine.com/materials-guide/lumber/wood-species-1/cocobolo/| title= Cocobolo | website= WoodMagazine.com| accessdate= March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oil can induce allergic reactions if inhaled or exposed to unprotected skin and eyes. A [[dust collection system]], coupled with the use of [[personal protective equipment]] such as respirators, is highly recommended when machining this wood.

==Uses==
Because it stands up well to repeated handling and exposure to water, a common use is for [[Pistol grip|gun grip]]s and [[Knife#Handle|knife handle]]s, and duck calls. It is very hard, fine textured, and dense, yet easily machined. The abundance of natural oils, however, causes the wood to clog abrasives and fine-toothed saw blades, like other hard, dense [[tropical timber|tropical woods]]. Besides its use on guns and knives, cocobolo is favored for fine inlay work on custom, high-end [[cue stick]]s, police [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], pens, brush backs, bowls, pipes, jewelry boxes, desktops and other expensive specialty items.

==Musical instruments==
Due to its density and hardness, even a large block of the cut wood will produce a clear musical tone if struck. Renowned for its "warm, rich palette"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oboechicago.com/HOWxlOB.pdf|title=The Howarth XL Oboe|last=|first=|date=|website=Oboe Chicago|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, cocobolo is used to make musical instruments, such as [[oboe]]s, [[flute]]s and [[clarinet]]s--especially boutique, custom barrel joints for B-flat clarinets. Other woodwind instruments, such as bagpipes, (even the bagpipes' chanter's more basic relatives, duck and goose calls) have been successfully made using cocobolo instead of the orchestral and Celtic instruments' customary mpingo, or [[African blackwood]], known in the trade as [[grenadilla]]. Additionally, cocobolo has been used to make fingerboards, as well as entire necks and bodies of guitars and bass guitars, having been employed as a substitute for [[Brazilian Rosewood]] since that fellow Dalbergia member was [[CITES]] listed in 1992. Additionally, cocobolo is used to an extent in building drums.

==Conservation==
Logs, sawn wood, and [[Wood veneer|veneer]] sheets from the [[Guatemala]]n populations of Cocobolo (''Dalbergia retusa''), have been listed under [[CITES#Appendix III|CITES Appendix III]]{{Clarify|date=August 2014}} since 2008. In 2011, [[Panama]] extended that listing to include all products except seeds and pollen and finished products packaged and ready for retail trade. 

As of January 2, 2017, Cocobolo is protected as a [[CITES]] Appendix II&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php|title=Appendices |website=CITES|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; species, along with [[Bubinga]] (Guibourtia demeusei, G. pellegriniana, and G. tessmanni), other true [[Dalbergia|rosewoods]] (Dalbergia spp.) and related species found in the Dalbergia genus, such as Tulipwood, Kingwood, and African Blackwood.

A '''depletion force''' is an effective attractive force that arises between large [[colloidal]] particles that are suspended in a dilute solution of ''depletants'', which are smaller solutes that are preferentially excluded from the vicinity of the large particles.&lt;ref name=physicaa&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mao|first=Y. |author2=M.E.

Lekkerkerker|title=Depletion force in colloidal systems|journal=Physica A |date=May 1995|volume=222|issue=1–4|pages=10–24|doi=10.1016/0378-4371(95)00206-5|bibcode = 1995PhyA..222...10M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lekkerkerker&gt;{{cite book|last=Lekkerkerker|first=H.N.W.|author2=Tuinier, R.|title=Colloids and the Depletion Interaction|publisher=Springer: Heidelberg|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest reports of depletion forces that lead to particle coagulation is that of Bondy, who observed the separation or 'creaming' of rubber latex upon addition of polymer depletant molecules (sodium alginate) to solution.&lt;ref name="Bondy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bondy|first=C.|title=The creaming of rubber latex|journal=Trans. Faraday Soc.|date=1939|volume=35|pages=1093|doi=10.1039/TF9393501093}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, depletants can include [[polymers]], [[micelles]], [[osmolytes]], ink, mud, or paint dispersed in a [[wikt:continuous phase|continuous phase]].&lt;ref name=physicaa /&gt;&lt;ref name=textbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Butt|first=Hans-Jürgen|title=Physics and chemistry of interfaces|year=2006|publisher=Wiley-VCH-Verl.|location=Weinheim|isbn=978-3-527-40629-6|pages=116–117|edition=2., rev. and enl.|author2=Graf,, Karlheinz |author3=Kappl, Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depletion forces are often regarded as [[entropic forces]], as was first explained by the established Asakura-Oosawa model.&lt;ref name="AsakuraOosawa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asakura|first=Sho|author2=Oosawa,F|title=On Interaction between Two Bodies Immersed in a Solution of Macromolecules|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|date=1 January 1954|volume=22|issue=7|pages=1255|doi=10.1063/1.1740347|bibcode = 1954JChPh..22.1255A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="[2] Asakura"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asakura|first=Sho|author2=Oosawa,F.|title=Interaction between Particles Suspended in Solutions of Macromolecules|journal=Journal of Polymer Science|year=1958|volume=33|pages=183–192|doi=10.1002/pol.1958.1203312618|bibcode = 1958JPoSc..33..183A }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory the depletion force arises from an increase in osmotic pressure of the surrounding solution when colloidal particles get close enough such that the excluded cosolutes (depletants) cannot fit in between them.&lt;ref name= seminar /&gt;
Because the particles were considered as hard-core (completely rigid) particles, the emerging picture of the underlying mechanism inducing the force was necessarily entropic.

== Causes ==

=== Sterics ===
The system of colloids and depletants in solution is typically modeled by treating the large colloids and small depletants as dissimilarly sized [[hard spheres]].&lt;ref name=physicaa /&gt; Hard spheres are characterized as non-interacting and impenetrable spheres. These two fundamental properties of hard spheres are described mathematically by the ''hard-sphere potential''. The hard-sphere potential imposes steric constraint around large spheres which in turn gives rise to ''excluded volume'', that is, volume that is unavailable for small spheres to occupy.&lt;ref name=seminar /&gt;

==== Hard-sphere potential ====
In a colloidal dispersion, the colloid-colloid interaction potential is approximated as the interaction potential between two hard spheres. For two hard spheres of diameter of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the interaction potential as a function of interparticle separation is:

:&lt;math&gt;V(h)=\left\{ \begin{matrix}0 &amp; \mbox{if}\quad h\geq \sigma \\ \infty &amp; \mbox{if}\quad h&lt; \sigma \end{matrix} \right.&lt;/math&gt;

called the hard-sphere potential where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the center-to-center distance between the spheres.&lt;ref name=binary&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biben|first=Thierry|author2=Peter Bladon |author3=Daan Frenkel |title=Depletion effects in binary hard-sphere fluids|journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter|year=1996|volume=8|issue=50|pages=10799–10800|bibcode = 1996JPCM....810799B |doi = 10.1088/0953-8984/8/50/008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If both colloids and depletants are in a [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]], there is interaction potential between colloidal particles and depletant particles that is described similarly by the hard-sphere potential.&lt;ref name=seminar /&gt; Again, approximating the particles to be hard-spheres, the interaction potential between colloids of diameter &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; and depletant sols of diameter &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;V(h)=\left\{ \begin{matrix}0 &amp; \mbox{if}\quad h\geq \Big( \frac{D+d}{2} \Big)\\ \infty &amp; \mbox{if}\quad h&lt; \Big( \frac{D+d}{2} \Big) \end{matrix} \right. &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the center-to-center distance between the spheres. Typically, depletant particles are very small compared to the colloids so &lt;math&gt;d \ll D&lt;/math&gt;

The underlying consequence of the hard-sphere potential is that dispersed colloids cannot penetrate each other and have no mutual attraction or repulsion.

==== Excluded volume ====
[[File:Overlap volume between hard spheres.png|thumb|Excluded volumes of hard spheres overlap resulting in an increase in the total volume available to depletants. This increases the entropy of the system and lowers the Helmholtz free energy]]
When both large colloidal particles and small depletants are in a [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], there is a region which surrounds every large colloidal particle that is unavailable for the centers of the depletants to occupy. This steric restriction is due to the colloid-depletant hard-sphere potential.&lt;ref name=seminar&gt;{{cite web|last=Mravlak|first=Marko|title=Depletion Force|publisher=University of Ljubljana department of physics|url=http://mafija.fmf.uni-lj.si/seminar/files/2007_2008/depletion.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=binary /&gt;  The volume of the excluded region is

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{E}= \frac{\pi \big(D+d \big)^3}{6}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter of the large spheres and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter of the small spheres.

When the large spheres get close enough, the excluded volumes surrounding the spheres intersect. The overlapping volumes result in a reduced excluded volume, that is, an increase in the total free volume available to small spheres.&lt;ref name=physicaa /&gt;&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt; The reduced excluded volume, &lt;math&gt;V'_\mathrm{E}&lt;/math&gt; can be written

:&lt;math&gt;V'_\mathrm{E}=V_\mathrm{E}- \frac{2 \pi l^2}{3}  \bigg[ \frac{3 \left(D+d \right)}{2} -l \bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;l=(D+d)/2-h/2&lt;/math&gt; is half the width of the lens-shaped region of overlap volume formed by spherical caps. The volume available &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{A}&lt;/math&gt; for small spheres is the difference between the total volume of the system and the excluded volume. To determine the available volume for small spheres, there are two distinguishable cases: first, the separation of the large spheres is big enough so small spheres can penetrate in between them; second, the large spheres are close enough so that small spheres cannot penetrate between them.&lt;ref name= seminar /&gt; For each case, the available volume for small spheres is given by

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{A}=\left\{ \begin{matrix}V-V_\mathrm{E} &amp; \mbox{if}\quad h\geq D+d\\V-V'_\mathrm{E} &amp; \mbox{if}\quad h&lt; D+d \end{matrix} \right. &lt;/math&gt;

In the latter case small spheres are depleted from the interparticle region between large spheres and a depletion force ensues.

===Thermodynamics===
The depletion force is described as an [[entropic]] force because it is fundamentally a manifestation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which states that a system tends to increase its [[entropy]].&lt;ref name=seminar /&gt; The gain in translational entropy of the depletants, owing to the increased available volume, is much greater than the loss of entropy from flocculation of the colloids.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt; The positive change in entropy lowers the [[Helmholtz free energy]] and causes colloidal flocculation to happen spontaneously. The system of colloids and depletants in a solution is modeled as a [[canonical ensemble]] of hard spheres for statistical determinations of thermodynamic quantities.&lt;ref name=seminar /&gt;

However, recent experiments&lt;ref name="Politi2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Politi|first=R|author2=Harries, D.|title=Enthalpically Driven Peptide Stabilization by Protective Osmolytes|journal=Chem.

Colloid Interface Sci.|year=2015|volume=20|pages=3–10|doi=10.1016/j.cocis.2014.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that depletion forces can be enthalpically driven. In these instances, the intricate balance of interactions between the solution components results in the net exclusion of cosolute from macromolecule. This exclusion results in an effective stabilization of the macromolecule self-association, which can be not only enthalpically dominated, but also entropically unfavorable.

==== Entropy and Helmholtz energy ====
The total volume available for small spheres increases when the excluded volumes around large spheres overlap. The increased volume allotted for small spheres allows them greater translational freedom which increases their entropy.&lt;ref name=physicaa /&gt; Because the [[canonical ensemble]] is an [[wikt:athermal|athermal]] system at a constant volume the Helmholtz free energy is written

:&lt;math&gt;A=-TS&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the Helmholtz free energy, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the entropy and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature. The system's net gain in entropy is positive from increased volume, thus the Helmholtz free energy is negative and depletion flocculation happens spontaneously.

The free energy of the system is obtained from a statistical definition of Helmholtz free energy

:&lt;math&gt;A=-k_\mathrm{B}T \ln Q&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] for the canonical ensemble. The partition function contains statistical information that describes the canonical ensemble including its total volume, the total number of small spheres, the volume available for small spheres to occupy, and the [[de Broglie wavelength]].&lt;ref name=seminar /&gt; If hard-spheres are assumed, the partition function &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;Q= \frac{V_\mathrm{A}^N}{N! \Lambda^{3N}}&lt;/math&gt;

The volume available for small spheres,&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{A}&lt;/math&gt; was calculated above.&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of small spheres and &lt;math&gt; \Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[de Broglie wavelength]]. Substituting &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; into the statistical definition, the Helmholtz free energy now reads

:&lt;math&gt;A=-k_\mathrm{B}T\ln \bigg( \frac{V_\mathrm{A}^N}{N! \Lambda^{3N}} \bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude of the depletion force, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the change in Helmholtz free energy with distance between two large spheres and is given by&lt;ref name=seminar /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}=- \bigg( \frac{ \partial A}{ \partial h} \bigg)_T&lt;/math&gt;

The entropic nature of depletion forces was proven experimentally in some cases. For example, some polymeric crowders induce entropic depletion forces that stabilize proteins in their native state.&lt;ref name="Minton1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minton|first=A.|title=Excluded Volume as a Determinant of Macromolecular Structure and Reactivity|journal=Biopolymers|year=1981|volume=20|pages=2093–2120|doi=10.1002/bip.1981.360201006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Y.C.|author2=Mittal, J.|title=Crowding Induced Entropy-Enthalpy Compensation in Protein Association Equilibria|journal=Phys.

Other examples include many systems with hard-core only interactions.&lt;ref name="Biben1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biben|first1=Thierry|last2=Bladon|first2=Peter|last3=Frenkel|first3=Daan|title=Depletion effects in binary hard-sphere fluids|journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter|volume=8|issue=50|year=1996|pages=10799–10821|issn=0953-8984|doi=10.1088/0953-8984/8/50/008|bibcode = 1996JPCM....810799B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Osmotic pressure ===
The depletion force is an effect of increased osmotic pressure in the surrounding solution.
When colloids get sufficiently close, that is when their excluded volumes overlap, depletants are expelled from the interparticle region. This region between colloids then becomes a [[Phase (matter)|phase]] of pure solvent. When this occurs, there is a higher depletant concentration in the surrounding solution than in the interparticle region.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= seminar /&gt; The resulting density gradient gives rise to an [[osmotic pressure]] that is [[anisotropic]] in nature, acting on the outer sides of the colloids and promoting flocculation.&lt;ref name="[2] Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 3960–3963 (1999)" /&gt; If the hard-sphere approximation is employed, the osmotic pressure is:

:&lt;math&gt;p_0= \rho k_\mathrm{B} T&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; is osmotic pressure and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is [[number density]] of small spheres and &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{B}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]].

==The Asakura-Oosawa model==
Depletion forces were first described by Sho Asakura and Fumio Oosawa in 1954. In their model, the force is always considered to be attractive. Additionally, the force is considered to be proportional to the [[osmotic pressure]]. The Asakura-Oosawa model assumes low [[macromolecule]] densities and that the density distribution, &lt;math&gt; \rho(r)&lt;/math&gt;, of the macromolecules is constant.  Asakura and Oosawa described four cases in which depletion forces would occur. They first described the most general case as two solid plates in a [[solution]] of macromolecules. The principles for the first case were then extended to three additional cases.&lt;ref name="[2] Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 3960–3963 (1999)" /&gt; 
[[File:Asakura-Oosawa Model, Two Plates in a solution of Macromolecules.png|thumb|Two plates in a solution of macromolecules. Macromolecules are excluded from between the plates. This results in pure solvent between the plates and a force equal to the osmotic pressure acting upon the plates.]]

===Free energy change due to the depletion force===
In the Asakura-Oosawa model for depletion forces, the change in free-energy imposed by an excluded cosolute, &lt;math&gt;\Delta G&lt;/math&gt;, is:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta G(r)= \Pi \Delta V_{exclusion}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; is the osmotic pressure, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta V_{exclusion}&lt;/math&gt; is the change in excluded volume (which is related to molecular size and shape). The very same result can be derived using the [[Kirkwood-Buff solution theory]].&lt;ref name="COCIS2015"/&gt;

===Solid plates in a solution of macromolecules===
In the first case, two solid plates are placed in a solution of rigid spherical macromolecules.&lt;ref name="AsakuraOosawa"/&gt;  If the distance between two plates, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, is smaller than the diameter of [[Solution|solute]] molecules, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, then no solute can enter between the plates. This results in pure [[solvent]] existing between the plates. The difference in concentration of macromolecules in the solution between the plates and the bulk solution causes a force equal to the osmotic pressure to act on the plates. In a very dilute and monodisperse solution the force is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;p=k_\mathrm{B}TN \left( \frac{\partial \ln Q}{\partial a} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Asakura-Oosawa first two cases.png|thumb|In the first case the force on the plates is zero until the diameter of the macromolecules is larger than the distance between the plates. In case two the force increases as the length of the rods increases.]]
where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the force, and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of solute molecules. The force causes the entropy of the macromolecules to increase and is attractive when &lt;math&gt;a&lt;d&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="[2] Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 3960–3963 (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bechinger|first=C.|author2=Rudhardt, D. |author3=Leiderer, P. |author4=Roth, R. |author5= Dietrich, S. |title=Understanding Depletion Forces beyond Entropy|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=1 November 1999|volume=83|issue=19|pages=3960–3963|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.3960|arxiv = cond-mat/9908350 |bibcode = 1999PhRvL..83.3960B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rod-like macromolecules===
Asakura and Oosawa described the second case as consisting of two plates in a solution of rod like macromolecules. The rod like macromolecules are described as having a length, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;l^2 \ll A&lt;/math&gt;, the area of the plates. As the length of the rods increases, the concentration of the rods between the plates is decreased as it becomes more difficult for the rods to enter between the plates due to steric hindrances. As a result, the force acting on the plates increases with the length of the rods until it becomes equal to the osmotic pressure.&lt;ref name="AsakuraOosawa" /&gt; In this context, it is worth mentioning that even the isotropic-nematic transition of [[lyotropic liquid crystal]]s, as first explained in Onsager's theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume = 51| issue =4|year = 1949| pages = 627–659| doi =10.1111/j.1749-6632.1949.tb27296.x|title=The effects of shape on the interaction of colloidal particles|bibcode = 1949NYASA..51..627O| last1=Onsager| first1=Lars }}&lt;/ref&gt; can in itself be considered a special case of depletion forces.&lt;ref name="Forsyth1977"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forsyth|first=P.A.|author2=Marčelja, S. |author3=Mitchell, D.J. |author4= Ninham, B.W. |title=Onsager transition in hard plate fluid|journal=J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans. 2 |year=1977|volume=73|pages=84–88|doi=10.1039/F29777300084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plates in a solution of polymers===
The third case described by Asakura and Oosawa is two plates in a solution of polymers. Due to the size of the polymers, the concentration of polymers in the neighborhood of the plates is reduced, which result the [[conformational entropy]] of the polymers being decreased. The case can be approximated by modeling it as diffusion in a vessel with walls which absorb diffusing particles. The force, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, can then be calculated according to:
	
:&lt;math&gt;p= -Ap_o \Bigg\{(1-f)- a \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial a} \right) \Bigg\}&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation &lt;math&gt; 1-f &lt;/math&gt; is the attraction from the osmotic effect. &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial a}&lt;/math&gt; is the repulsion due to chain molecules confined between plates. &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is on order of &lt;math&gt;\langle r \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, the mean end-to-end distance of chain molecules in free space.&lt;ref name=seminar /&gt;

===Large hard spheres in a solution of small hard spheres===
The final case described by Asakura and Oosawa describes two large, hard spheres of diameter &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, in a solution of small, hard spheres of diameter &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. If the distance between the center of the spheres, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, is less than &lt;math&gt;(D + d)&lt;/math&gt;, then the small spheres are excluded from the space between the large spheres. This results in the area between the spheres having a reduced concentration of small spheres and therefore reduced entropy. This reduced entropy causes a force to act upon the large spheres pushing them together.&lt;ref name=seminar /&gt; This effect was convincingly demonstrated in experiments with vibrofluidized granular materials where attraction can be directly visualized.&lt;ref name="Urbach2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melby|first=P.|author2=Prevost, A. |author3=Egolf, D.A. |author4= Urbach, J.A. |title=Depletion force in a bidisperse granular layer|journal=Phys.

==Improvements upon the Asakura and Oosawa model==

=== Derjaguin approximation ===

====Theory====
Asakura and Oosawa assumed low concentrations of macromolecules. However, at high concentrations of macromolecules, structural correlation effects in the macromolecular liquid become important. Additionally, the repulsive interaction strength strongly increases for large values of &lt;math&gt;R/r&lt;/math&gt; (large radius/small radius).&lt;ref name="[2] Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 3960–3963 (1999)" /&gt; In order to account for these issues, the [[Derjaguin approximation]], which is valid for any type of force law, has been applied to depletion forces. The Derjaguin approximation relates the force between two spheres to the force between two plates. The force is then integrated between small regions on one surface and the opposite surface, which is assumed to be locally flat.&lt;ref name=seminar /&gt; [[File:Derjaguin Approximation.png|thumb|The Derjaguin Approximation relates the force between two spheres to the force between two plates.]]

====Equations====
If there are two spheres of radii &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; on the &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; axis, and the spheres are &lt;math&gt;h+R_1+R_2&lt;/math&gt; distance apart, where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, then the force, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction is

:&lt;math&gt;F(h) \approx 2 \pi \left( \frac{R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2} \right) W(h)&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, &lt;math&gt;W(h) =\textstyle \int_{h}^{\infty} f(z)dz&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the normal force per unit area between two flat surfaces distance &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; apart. 
			
When the Derjaguin approximation is applied to depletion forces, and 0&lt;h&lt;2Rs, then the depletion force given by the Derjaguin approximation is

:&lt;math&gt;F(h)=- \pi \epsilon \left(R_B+R_S \right) \big [p( \rho )(2R_S-h)+ \gamma ( \rho , \infty) \big ]&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the geometrical factor, which is set to 1, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma ( \rho , \infty) = 2 \gamma (\rho)&lt;/math&gt;, the interfacial tension at the wall-fluid interface.&lt;ref name=seminar /&gt;

=== Density functional theory ===

====Theory====
Asakura and Oosawa assumed a uniform particle density, which is true in a homogenous solution. However, if an external potential is applied to a solution, then the uniform particle density is disrupted, making Asakura and Oosawa's assumption invalid. [[Density functional theory]] accounts for variations in particle density by using the [[grand canonical potential]]. The grand canonical potential, which is a state function for the [[grand canonical ensemble]], is used to calculate the probability density for microscopic states in macroscopic state. When applied to depletion forces, the grand canonical potential calculates the local particle densities in a solution.&lt;ref name=seminar /&gt;

====Equations====
Density functional theory states that when any fluid is exposed to an external potential, &lt;math&gt;V(R)&lt;/math&gt;, then all equilibrium quantities become functions of number density profile, &lt;math&gt;\rho(R)&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the total free energy is minimized. The Grand canonical potential, &lt;math&gt; \Omega \left( \big[ \rho (R) \big] ; \mu , T \right)&lt;/math&gt;, is then written
			
:&lt;math&gt; \Omega \left( \big[ \rho (R) \big] ; \mu , T \right) =A \left( \big[ \rho (R) \big] ; T \right)- \int d^3R \big[ \mu - V(R) \big] \rho (R),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the chemical potential, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature, and &lt;math&gt;A [\rho]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[helmholtz free energy]].&lt;ref name="[4]Phys. Rev. E 57, 6785–6800 (1998)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Götzelmann|first=B.|author2=Evans, R. |author3=Dietrich, S. |title=Depletion forces in fluids|journal=Physical Review E|volume=57|issue=6|pages=6785–6800|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.57.6785|bibcode = 1998PhRvE..57.6785G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enthalpic depletion forces ==
The original Asakura-Oosawa model considered only hard-core interactions. In such an athermal mixture the origin of depletion forces is necessarily entropic. If the intermolecular potentials also include repulsive and/or attractive terms, and if the solvent is considered explicitly, the depletion interaction can have additional thermodynamic contributions.

The notion that depletion forces can also be enthalpically driven has surfaced due to recent experiments regarding protein stabilization induced by compatible osmolytes, such as [[trehalose]], [[glycerol]], and [[sorbitol]]. These osmolytes are preferentially excluded from protein surfaces, forming a layer of preferential hydration around the proteins. When the protein folds - this exclusion volume diminishes, making the folded state lower in free energy. Hence the excluded osmolytes shift the folding equilibrium towards the folded state. This effect was generally thought to be an entropic force, in the spirit of the original Asakura-Oosawa model and of [[macromolecular crowding]]. However, thermodynamic breakdown of the free-energy gain due to osmolyte addition showed the effect is in fact enthalpically driven, whereas entropy can even be disfavorable.&lt;ref name="Politi2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benton2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sukenik2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COCIS2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sukenik2013_b"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sukenik|first=S|author2=Sapir, L. |author3=Gilman-Politi, R. |author4= Harries, D. |title=Diversity in the mechanisms of cosolute action on biomolecular processes.|journal=Faraday Discussions|year=2013|volume=160|pages=225–237|doi=10.1039/C2FD20101A|bibcode = 2013FaDi..160..225S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many cases, the molecular origin of this enthalpically driven depletion force can be traced to an effective "soft" repulsion in the potential of mean force between macromolecule and cosolute. Both Monte-Carlo simulations and a simple analytic model demonstrate that when the hard-core potential (as in Asakura and Oosawa's model) is supplemented with an additional repulsive "softer" interaction, the depletion force can become enthalpically dominated.&lt;ref name="Sapir2014"/&gt;

== Measurement and experimentation ==
Depletion forces have been observed and measured using a variety of instrumentation including [[atomic force microscopy]], [[optical tweezers]], and hydrodynamic force balance machines.

=== Atomic force microscopy ===
[[Atomic force microscopy]] (AFM) is commonly used to directly measure the magnitude of depletion forces. This method uses the deflection of a very small cantilever contacting a sample which is measured by a laser. The force required to cause a certain amount of beam deflection can be determined from the change in angle of the laser. The small scale of AFM allows for [[dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] particles to be measured directly yielding a relatively accurate measurement of depletion forces.&lt;ref&gt;Milling, A. J.; Kendall, K. "Depletion, Adsorption, and Structuring of Sodium Poly(acrylate) at the Water-Silica Interface: An Atomic Force Microscopy Force Study" Langmuir. 2000. 16: pp. 5106-5115.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optical tweezers ===
The force required to separate two [[colloid]] particles can be measured using [[optical tweezers]]. This method uses a focused laser beam to apply an attractive or repulsive force on dielectric micro and nanoparticles. This technique is used with [[dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] particles by applying a force which resists depletion forces. The displacement of the particles is then measured and used to find the attractive force between the particles.

=== Hydrodynamic force balance ===
HFB machines measure the strength of particle interactions using liquid flow to separate the particles. This method is used to find depletion force strength by adhering to a static plate one particle in a [[dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] particle doublet and applying shear force through fluid flow. The [[drag (physics)|drag]] created by the dispersion particles resists the depletion force between them, pulling the free particle away from the adhered particle. A force balance of the particles at separation can be used to determine the depletion force between the particles.&lt;ref&gt;Piech, M.; Weronski, P.; Wu, X.; Walz, J.Y. "Prediction and Measurement of the Interparticle Depletion Interaction Next to a Flat Wall" Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. 2002. 247: pp. 327-341.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colloidal destabilization ==

=== Mechanism ===
Depletion forces are used extensively as a method of destabilizing [[colloids]]. By introducing particles into a colloidal [[dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]], attractive depletion forces can be induced between dispersed particles. These attractive interactions bring the dispersed particles together resulting in [[flocculation]].&lt;ref name="Casey"&gt;Casey, T.J. "Unit Treatment Processes in Water and Wastewater Engineering". Aquavarra Research Ltd. 2006. Chp. 3, pp. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roth"&gt;Roth, R.; Gotzelmann, B.; Dietrich, S. "Depletion Forces Near Curved Surfaces". American Physical Society. 1998. 82:2 pp. 448-451.&lt;/ref&gt; This destabilizes the [[colloid]] as the particles are no longer dispersed in the liquid but concentrated in [[Flocculation|floc]] formations. Flocs are then easily removed through [[filtration]] processes leaving behind a non-dispersed, pure liquid.&lt;ref name="Bratby"&gt;Bratby, J. "Coagulation and Flocculation in Water and Wastewater Treatment". IWA Publishing. London: 2006. pp. 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water treatment ===
The use of depletion forces to initiate [[flocculation]] is a common process in water treatment. The relatively small size of dispersed particles in waste water renders typical filtration methods ineffective. However, if the dispersion was to be destabilized and [[flocculation]] occur, particles can then be filtered out to produce pure water. Therefore, coagulants and [[flocculants]] are typically introduced to waste water which create these depletion forces between the dispersed particles.&lt;ref name="Casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bratby" /&gt;

=== Winemaking ===
Some wine production methods also use depletion forces to remove dispersed particles from wine. Unwanted colloidal particles can be found in wine originating from the [[must]] or produced during the winemaking process. These particles typically consist of [[carbohydrates]], pigmentation molecules, or [[proteins]] which may adversely affect the taste and purity of the wine.&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, Juan; Peinado, Rafael. "Enological Chemistry". Elsevier Inc. San Diego: 2012. pp. 325-326.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[flocculants]] are often added to induce floc [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] for easy [[filtration]].

===Common flocculants===
The table below lists common [[flocculants]] along with their chemical formulas, net [[electrical charge]], [[molecular weight]] and current applications.

== Biological systems ==
There are suggestions that depletion forces may be a significant contributor in some biological systems, specifically in membrane interactions between [[cell (biology)|cell]]s or any membranous structure.&lt;ref name="Roth" /&gt; With concentrations of large molecules such as [[proteins]] or [[carbohydrates]] in the [[extracellular matrix]], it is likely some depletion force effects are observed between cells or [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s that are very close. However, due to the complexity of most biological systems, it is difficult to determine how much these depletion forces influence membrane interactions.&lt;ref name="Roth" /&gt; Models of vesicle interactions with depletion forces have been developed, but these are greatly simplified and their applicability to real biological systems is questionable.

== Generalization: anisotropic colloids and systems without polymers ==
Depletion forces in colloid-polymer mixtures drive colloids to form aggregates that are densely packed locally. This local dense packing is also observed in colloidal systems without polymer depletants. Without polymer depletants the mechanism is similar, because the particles in dense colloidal suspension act, effectively, as depletants for one another&lt;ref name="vanAndersPNAS2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Anders| first=Greg| last2=Klotsa| first2=Daphne| last3=Ahmed| first3=N.

==Status and delays==
Several delays in production occurred and there has not been a public demonstration of the uniquely high [[energy density]] claims of the inventors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lyle |url=http://gm-volt.com/2010/04/22/zenneestor-update/ |title=Zenn/EESTOR Update - April 22, 2010 |publisher=gm-volt.com |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the speculation that the claims are false. In January 2007 EEStor stated in a press release "EEStor, Inc. remains on track to begin shipping production 15 kilowatt-hour Electrical Energy Storage Units (EESU) to [[ZENN Motor Company]] in 2007 for use in their electric vehicles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/eestor-announces-two-key-production-milestones-automated-production-line-proven-third-631210.htm |title=EEStor Announces Two Key Production Milestones: Automated Production Line Proven and Third Party Verification of All Key Production Chemicals Completed |publisher=Marketwire.com |date=2007-01-17 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, EEStor co-founder Richard Weir told CNET production would begin in the middle of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kanellos |first=Michael |url=http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9770849-7.html |title=''Is EEStor delaying its power system for cars?'' - September 4, 2007 |publisher=news.com |date=2007-09-04 |accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, it was reported he stated "as soon as possible in 2009".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/21171/page2/ |title=Better Batteries Charge Up |publisher=Technology Review |date= |accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ZENN Motor Company]] (ZMC) denied there was a delay, just a clarification of the schedule, separating "development" and "commercialization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?ch=specialsections&amp;sc=batteries&amp;id=18086&amp;a=f|title=Official Response from Zenn on delay of EEStor (under Comment section written by afjerry on 09/11/2007 at 9:47 PM)|date=2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008 Zenn stated in a quarterly report a "late 2009" launch was scheduled for an EEStor-enabled EV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zenncars.com/media/documents/FY08_Q2_Management_Discussion_Analysis.pdf |title=ZENN : Management's Discussion and Analysis |publisher=Zenncars.com |accessdate=2013-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319213824/http://www.zenncars.com/media/documents/FY08_Q2_Management_Discussion_Analysis.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009 Zenn announced that production of the lead acid based ZENN LSV would end April 30, 2010. At that time Zenn did not announce a date for production of an EEstor based car.&lt;ref name="Zenn_cancels_production" /&gt;



In July 2009 ZENN Motor Company invested an additional $5 million in EEStor, increasing its share of ownership to 10.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emediaworld.com/press_release/release_detail.php?id=623265 |title=ZENN Motor Company increases ownership of EEStor |publisher=Emediaworld.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Zenn press release indicates they were able to get a 10.7% stake because other EEStor investors did not increase their stake.&lt;ref name="zenncars.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zenncars.com/media/press_rel/07_08/EEStor_confirms_progress_July30.pdf |title=News Release : Zenn Motor Company's Strategic Energy Storage Partner, EESTOR Inc.

==Recent events==
The company continues to issue press releases on its ongoing research and activities.  No products have been made for commercial sales. 


==Skepticism from experts and lack of demonstrated claims==
EEStor's claims for the EESU exceed by [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] the energy storage capacity of any capacitor currently sold. Many in the industry have expressed skepticism about the claims. Jim Miller, vice president of advanced transportation technologies at [[Maxwell Technologies]] and capacitor expert, stated he was skeptical because of [[Leakage (electronics)|current leakage]] typically seen at high voltages and because there should be [[Fracture mechanics|microfractures]] from temperature changes. He stated "I'm surprised that [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers|Kleiner]] has put money into it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/business/18086/ |title=Battery Breakthrough? |publisher=Technology Review |date= |accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EEStor's claims for the comprehensive permittivity, breakdown strength, and leakage performance of their dielectric material far exceeded those understood to be consistent with the fundamental physical capabilities of any known elemental material or composite structure.  For example, the thermochemical theory of polar molecular bond strengths has been confirmed to be valid for a wide range of materials, and shows that there exists a near universal inverse relationship between a material's permittivity and its ultimate breakdown strength.&lt;ref name="McPherson"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Trends in the Ultimate Breakdown Strength of High Dielectric-Constant Materials, J.W. McPherson et.al., IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, 2003|journal=IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices|volume=50|issue=8|pages=1771–1778|doi=10.1109/TED.2003.815141|year=2003|last1=McPherson|first1=J.W.|last2=Jinyoung Kim|last3=Shanware|first3=A.|last4=Mogul|first4=H.|last5=Rodriguez|first5=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  EEstor's initially claimed material results exceeded the limits of this fundamental relationship by orders of magnitude.

==Patent description and claims==
EEStor reports a large relative [[permittivity]] (19818) at an unusually high [[electric field]] strength of 350&amp;nbsp;MV/m, giving 10,000&amp;nbsp;J/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[dielectric]]. Voltage independence of permittivity was claimed up to 500&amp;nbsp;V/μm to within 0.25% of low voltage measurements. Variation in permittivity at a single voltage for 10 different components was claimed by measurements in the patent to be less than +/- 0.15%.&lt;ref name="USPTO-7466536" /&gt; If true, their capacitors store at least 30 times more energy per volume than (other) cutting-edge methods such as nanotube designs by Dr Schindall at M.I.T.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rle.mit.edu/rleonline/People/JoelSchindall_cv.pdf |title=Joel Schindall, Ph.D. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612162723/http://www.rle.mit.edu/rleonline/People/JoelSchindall_cv.pdf |archive-date=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ducharme's plastics research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.unl.edu/~ducharme/ |title=Stephen Ducharme |publisher=Physics.unl.edu |date=1996-07-09 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and breakthrough ceramics discussed by Dr. Cann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.orst.edu/node/461 |title=High Energy Density Dielectrics Based on Bi-Perovskites &amp;#124; Department of Physics |publisher=Physics.orst.edu |date=2009-04-29 |accessdate=2013-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319214617/http://www.physics.orst.edu/node/461 |archivedate=2012-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Northrop Grumman and BASF have also filed patents with similar theoretical energy density claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2007121274|application}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|7023687}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The EEStor patents cite a journal article&lt;ref&gt;S. A. Bruno, D. K. Swanson, and I. Burn, J. Am Ceram. Soc. 76, 1233 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Philips|Philips Corporation]] patent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|6078494}}&lt;/ref&gt; as exact descriptions of its "calcined composition-modified barium titanate powder." The Philips patent describes "doped barium-calcium-zirconium-titanate" (CMBT) and reports a permittivity of up to 33,500 at 1.8&amp;nbsp;V/μm, but does not report the permittivity at high electric fields such as the 350&amp;nbsp;V/μm EEStor claims. EEStor coats its 0.64 micrometer (average size) CMBT particles with 10&amp;nbsp;nm aluminum oxide (6% by volume) and immerses them in 6% [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] plastic by volume, giving 88% CMBT. The patent claims the [[aluminum oxide]] coating and PET matrix reduce the net permittivity to 88% of the CMBT permittivity. The Philips patent did not use either aluminum oxide or PET. The dielectric in solution is [[Screen-printing|screen-printed]] and dried in 10&amp;nbsp;μm layers, alternating with 1&amp;nbsp;μm aluminum plates (used to apply the working 3500&amp;nbsp;V).

EEStor's US patent 7033406 mentions aluminum oxide and calcium magnesium aluminosilicate glass as coatings,&lt;ref name="USPTO-7033406" /&gt; although their subsequent US patent 7466536 mentions only aluminum oxide.&lt;ref name="USPTO-7466536" /&gt;  Nickel was mentioned in the earlier US patent as the electrode but the later patent uses 1&amp;nbsp;μm aluminum plates as a less expensive alternative. According to the patents, both changes were made possible by selecting the PET matrix because it is pliable enough to fill voids at only 180&amp;nbsp;°C.

EEStor's latest (2016) US patent WO2016094310&lt;ref name="USPTO-WO2016094310" /&gt; mentions a polymer matrix which can include epoxy and ceramic powders including composition modified barium titanate (CMBT). The patent also mentions a layer thickness of 0.1 microns to 100 microns.  It also indicates the CMBT particle density in the polymer matrix can be up to 95%.&lt;ref name="eestorpatentWO2016094310" /&gt;  Phase 4 and Phase 5 testing reports used an epoxy/CMBT solution. More recent testing reports from March 2017 are showing samples with CMBT ratios of over 80% and in that same report EEStor mentions plans for near term samples with thickness of 70 microns with plans for greater levels of densification with near complete densification. A targeted near term goal of 110 wh/l energy density 70 micron layer is in development currently.&lt;ref name="eestorreleasemarch27"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eestorcorp.com/release_march-27-2017.html |title=March 27 EEStor PR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 30, 2013 ZENN announces completion of the purchase of Series A preferred shares of EEStor (includes [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]] shares and other private holders shares) and the associated rights for US$1.5 million which gives ZENN a total ownership of 41% in EEStor.&lt;ref name="zenncompletes-kpshares"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eestorcorp.com/assets/zenn-completes-eestor-share-purchase.pdf |title=Dec 30 ZENN PR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 8, 2014 ZENN and EEStor complete an exchange offer which gives ZENN a total ownership of 71.3% in EEStor. Following the ZENN controlling ownership on May 19, Ian Clifford assumes role of CEO following the resignation of James Kofman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eestorcorp.com/assets/zenn-announces-completion-of-exchange-offer-for-eestor-shares.pdf |title=ZENN ownership to 71.3 percent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eestorcorp.com/assets/zenn-announces-appointment-of-new-director.pdf |title=Ian Clifford assumes control as CEO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], an '''entropic force''' acting in a system is an [[emergence|emergent phenomenon]] resulting from the entire system's statistical tendency to increase its [[entropy]], rather than from a particular underlying force on the atomic scale.&lt;ref name="Müller2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Müller |first=Ingo |title=A History of Thermodynamics: The Doctrine of Energy and Entropy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u13KiGlz2zcC&amp;pg=PA115|date=2007 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3-540-46227-9 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roos2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roos |first1=Nico |title=Entropic forces in Brownian motion |journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=82 |issue=12 |year=2014 |pages=1161–1166 |issn=0002-9505 |doi=10.1119/1.4894381 |arxiv=1310.4139}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The entropic force can be considered as a emergent of the entropic interaction. The concept of entropic interaction was usually used in a subjunctive mood. For example: "macromolecule links, as if, entropically repulse from each other at a short distance and entropically are attracted to each other at a long distance”.&lt;ref&gt;Bresler S. E. and Erusalimsky B. L., Physics and chemistry of macromolecules, Nauka, M.-L., 1965, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; In a modern view&lt;ref&gt; Vilenchik Lev Z., “Quintessence: A Thermodynamic Approach to the Phenomena of Nature”, Nova Science Publishers, NY, (2016), p.25 {{ISBN|978-1536122435}} {{ISBN|1536122432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vilenchik Lev Z., “Entropic Essence of Nature”, International Journal of Theoretical Physics Nonlinear optics and Group Theory, Volume 17, Number 4, pp. 295-307, (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; the entropic interaction is considered to be a real-life interaction, and it is viewed as a mutual influence of open thermodynamic systems on each other by means of transferring information about their states, changing their entropies and translation of these systems into more probable conditions. The entropic interaction is a quintessential physical interaction that is realized by well-known basic interactions (gravitational, electromagnetic, nuclear strong and weak) through the processes that occur elsewhere in the universe including the solar system, our planet Earth, and living organisms. The basic interactions are considered to be daughter of the entropic interaction. The entropic interaction is not a consequence of existence of some entropy charge and a field accompanying it. It should not be referred to as a distribution of the entropy in the space. Entropy interaction reflects only an “order” and “structure” of the space, the state of the space and physical systems in it and, ultimately, affects the energy, behavior and evolution of such systems as well as the space as a whole. The entropic interaction results in the alteration of symmetry, free energy, and other characteristics of the physical system. Using this interaction, all material objects in Nature exert a certain influence on each other, regardless of the distance between them.

==Mathematical formulation==

In the [[canonical ensemble]], the entropic force &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt; associated to a macrostate partition &lt;math&gt;\{\mathbf{X}\}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:&lt;ref name = "Neumann_1980"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neumann RM | title = Entropic approach to Brownian movement | journal = American Journal of Physics | year = 1980 | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 354 | doi = 10.1119/1.12095 |bibcode = 1980AmJPh..48..354N |arxiv=1310.4139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Verlinde2011" /&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{X_0}) = T \nabla_{\mathbf X} S(\mathbf{X})|_{\mathbf X_0}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature, &lt;math&gt;S(\mathbf{X})&lt;/math&gt; is the entropy associated to the macrostate &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the present macrostate.
Heat dispersion

==Examples==

===Mach's Principle===

According to [[Mach's principle]] &lt;ref&gt;Ernst Mach, Mechanics, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;, local physics laws are determined by a large-scale structure of the universe and changes in any part of the universe affect a corresponding impact on all of its parts&lt;ref&gt;Hawking S.W. &amp; George Francis Rayner G.F. The Large-Scale Structure of Space-Time. Cambridge University Press. (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;  First of all, such changes are due by the entropic interaction. Once they have a place in one part of the universe, the entropy of the universe as a whole changes as well. That is, the entire universe “feels” such changes at the same time. In other words, the entropic interaction between different parts of any thermodynamic system happens instantly without the transfer of any material substance, meaning it is always a long-range action. After that, some processes emerge inside the system to transfer some substances or portions of energy in the appropriate direction. These actions are produced by one (or few) of basic interactions according to the mode of short-range action &lt;ref&gt;Vilenchik Lev Z., “Coexistence of Short-Range and Long-Range Actions at Interactions of Material Objects and Phase Transitions”, Journal of Nature Science and Sustainable Technology (JNSST), Volume 12, Issue 2, pp.131-139(2018)&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Heat dispersion.===

Heat dispersion is one of the examples of the entropic interaction. When one side of a metal pole is heated, a non-homogeneous temperature distribution is created along the pole. Because of entropic interaction between different parts of the pole, the entropy of the entire pole will decrease instantly. At the same time, the tendency appears to obtain a homogeneous distribution of the temperature (and by that to increase the entropy of the pole). This would be a long-range action. The process of [[heat conductivity]] will emerge to realize this tendency by a short-range action. Overall, this is an example of co-existence of the long and short-range actions in one process.

===Pressure of an ideal gas===

The [[internal energy]] of an [[ideal gas]] depends only on its temperature, and not on the volume of its containing box, so it is not an [[energy]] effect that tends to increase the volume of the box as gas [[pressure]] does. This implies that the [[pressure]] of an ideal gas has an entropic origin.&lt;ref name = "Taylor_2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor |last2=Tabachnik |title=Entropic forces—making the connection between mechanics and thermodynamics in an exactly soluble model|journal=European Journal of Physics|date=2013|volume=34|issue=3|doi=10.1088/0143-0807/34/3/729|pages=729–736|bibcode=2013EJPh...34..729T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is the origin of such an entropic force? The most general answer is that the effect of thermal fluctuations tends to bring a thermodynamic system toward a macroscopic state that corresponds to a maximum in the number of [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microscopic states (or micro-states)]] that are compatible with this macroscopic state. In other words, thermal fluctuations tend to bring a system toward its macroscopic state of maximum [[entropy]].&lt;ref name = "Taylor_2013" /&gt;

===Brownian motion ===

The entropic approach to [[Brownian motion|Brownian movement]] was initially proposed by R. M. Neumann.&lt;ref name = "Neumann_1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Neumann_1977"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neumann RM|title=The entropy of a single Gaussian macromolecule in a noninteracting solvent|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|date=1977|volume=66|issue=2|pages=870|doi=10.1063/1.433923|bibcode = 1977JChPh..66..870N }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neumann derived the entropic force for a particle undergoing three-dimensional Brownian motion using the [[Boltzmann equation]], denoting this force as a ''diffusional driving force'' or ''radial force''. In the paper, three example systems are shown to exhibit such a force:
* [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic system]] of [[molten salt]]
* [[surface tension]] and
* [[Rubber elasticity|Elasticity of rubber]].

===Polymers===
{{main article|Ideal chain}}
A standard example of an entropic force is the [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of a freely-jointed [[polymer]] molecule.&lt;ref name = "Neumann_1977"/&gt; For an [[ideal chain]], maximizing its entropy means reducing the distance between its two free ends. Consequently, a force that tends to collapse the chain is exerted by the ideal chain between its two free ends. This entropic force is proportional to the distance between the two ends.&lt;ref name = "Taylor_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith1992&gt;{{Cite journal  |last1 = Smith  |first1 = SB  |last2 = Finzi  |first2 = L  |last3 = Bustamante  |first3 = C  |title = Direct mechanical measurements of the elasticity of single DNA molecules by using magnetic beads  |journal = Science  |volume = 258  |issue = 5085  |pages = 1122–6  |year = 1992  |pmid = 1439819 |bibcode = 1992Sci...258.1122S |doi = 10.1126/science.1439819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The entropic force by a freely-jointed chain has a clear mechanical origin, and can be computed using constrained Lagrangian dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waters|first1=James T.|last2=Kim|first2=Harold D.|title=Force distribution in a semiflexible loop|journal=Physical Review E|date=18 April 2016|volume=93|issue=4|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.93.043315|arxiv=1602.08197|bibcode=2016PhRvE..93d3315W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrophobic force===
{{See also|Hydrophobic effect#Cause}}
[[Image:Drops I.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Water drops on the surface of grass.]]Another example of an entropic force is the [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] force. At room temperature, it partly originates from the loss of entropy by the 3D network of water molecules when they interact with molecules of [[Solution|dissolved substance]]. Each water molecule is capable of
* donating two [[hydrogen bond]]s through the two protons
* accepting two more hydrogen bonds through the two [[Orbital hybridisation#sp3|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized]] [[lone pair]]s
Therefore, water molecules can form an extended three-dimensional network.  Introduction of a non-hydrogen-bonding surface disrupts this network.  The water molecules rearrange themselves around the surface, so as to minimize the number of disrupted hydrogen bonds.  This is in contrast to [[hydrogen fluoride]] (which can accept 3 but donate only 1) or [[ammonia]] (which can donate 3 but accept only 1), which mainly form linear chains.

If the introduced surface had an ionic or polar nature, there would be water molecules standing upright on 1 (along the axis of an orbital for ionic bond) or 2 (along a resultant polarity axis) of the four sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Life Science Article on Hydrophobic Effect; See Figure 4: {{cite web |url=http://xibalba.lcg.unam.mx/~rgalindo/bioquimica/BQPosgrado2011/I%20FQ%20repaso/HydrophobicEffect.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222124741/http://xibalba.lcg.unam.mx/~rgalindo/bioquimica/BQPosgrado2011/I%20FQ%20repaso/HydrophobicEffect.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These orientations allow easy movement, i.e. degrees of freedom, and thus lowers entropy minimally. But a non-hydrogen-bonding surface with a moderate curvature forces the water molecule to sit tight on the surface, spreading 3 hydrogen bonds tangential to the surface, which then become locked in a [[Clathrate compound|clathrate]]-like basket shape. Water molecules involved in this clathrate-like basket around the non-hydrogen-bonding surface are constrained in their orientation.   Thus, any event that would minimize such a surface is entropically favored. For example, when two such hydrophobic particles come very close, the clathrate-like baskets surrounding them merge.  This releases some of the water molecules into the bulk of the water, leading to an increase in entropy.

Another related and counter-intuitive example of entropic force is [[protein folding]], which is a [[spontaneous process]] and where hydrophobic effect also plays a role.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiley.com/college/pratt/0471393878/student/review/thermodynamics/7_relationship.html&lt;/ref&gt; Structures of water-soluble proteins typically have a core in which hydrophobic [[side chains]] are buried from water, which stabilizes the folded state.&lt;ref name="Pace"/&gt; Charged and [[chemical polarity|polar]] side chains are situated on the solvent-exposed surface where they interact with surrounding water molecules. Minimizing the number of hydrophobic side chains exposed to water is the principal driving force behind the folding process,&lt;ref name="Pace"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pace CN, Shirley BA, McNutt M, Gajiwala K | title = Forces contributing to the conformational stability of proteins | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–83 | date = 1 January 1996 | pmid = 8566551 | url = http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/reprint/10/1/75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24187909"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Compiani M, Capriotti E |title=Computational and theoretical methods for protein folding |journal=Biochemistry |volume=52 |issue=48 |pages=8601–24 |date=Dec 2013 |pmid=24187909 |doi=10.1021/bi4001529 |url=http://biofold.org/emidio/pages/documents/papers/Compiani_Biochemistry2013.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904053433/https://biofold.org/emidio/pages/documents/papers/Compiani_Biochemistry2013.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colloids===

Entropic forces are important and widespread in the physics of [[colloid]]s,&lt;ref name="vanAndersPNAS2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Anders| first=Greg| last2=Klotsa| first2=Daphne| last3=Ahmed| first3=N. Khalid| last4=Engel| first4=Michael| last5=Glotzer| first5=Sharon C.| date=2014| title=Understanding shape entropy through local dense packing|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=111| issue=45|pages=E4812–E4821|doi=10.1073/pnas.1418159111|arxiv=1309.1187| pmid=25344532| pmc=4234574|bibcode=2014PNAS..111E4812V}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they are responsible for the [[depletion force]], and the ordering of hard particles, such as the [[crystallization]] of hard spheres, the isotropic-[[nematic]] transition in [[liquid crystal]] phases of hard rods, and the ordering of hard polyhedra.&lt;ref name="vanAndersPNAS2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DamascenoScience2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Damasceno| first=Pablo F.|last2=Engel|first2=Michael|last3=Glotzer|first3=Sharon C.|date=2012| title=Predictive Self-Assembly of Polyhedra into Complex Structures|journal=Science|volume=337| issue=6093|pages=453–457|doi=10.1126/science.1220869|arxiv=1202.2177|pmid=22837525|bibcode=2012Sci...337..453D}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Entropic forces arise in colloidal systems due to the [[osmosis|osmotic pressure]] that comes from particle crowding. This was first discovered in, and is most intuitive for, colloid-polymer mixtures described by the [[Depletion force#The Asakura-Oosawa model|Asakura-Oosawa model]]. In this model, polymers are approximated as finite-sized spheres that can penetrate one another, but cannot penetrate the colloidal particles. The inability of the polymers to penetrate the colloids leads to a region around the colloids in which the polymer density is reduced. If the regions of reduced polymer density around two colloids overlap with one another, by means of the colloids approaching one another, the polymers in the system gain an additional free volume that is equal to the volume of the intersection of the reduced density regions. The additional free volume causes an increase in the entropy of the polymers, and drives them to form locally dense-packed aggregates. A similar effect occurs in sufficiently dense colloidal systems without polymers, where osmotic pressure also drives the local dense packing&lt;ref name="vanAndersPNAS2014" /&gt; of colloids into a diverse array of structures &lt;ref name="DamascenoScience2012" /&gt; that can be rationally designed by modifying the shape of the particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Anders| first=Greg| last2=Ahmed| first2=N.

==Controversial examples==
Some forces that are generally regarded as [[force|conventional forces]] have been argued to be actually entropic in nature. These theories remain controversial and are the subject of ongoing work. [[Matt Visser]], professor of mathematics at Victoria University of Wellington, NZ in "Conservative Entropic Forces" &lt;ref name="visser2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Visser|first=Matt|title=Conservative entropic forces|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|volume=2011|issue=10|arxiv=1108.5240|year=2011|doi=10.1007/JHEP10(2011)140|bibcode=2011JHEP...10..140V}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticizes selected approaches but generally concludes:
{{quote|There is no reasonable doubt concerning the physical reality of entropic forces, and no reasonable doubt that classical (and semi-classical) general relativity is closely related to thermodynamics. Based on the work of Jacobson, [[Thanu Padmanabhan]], and others, there are also good reasons to suspect a thermodynamic interpretation of the fully relativistic Einstein equations might be possible.}}

===Gravity===
{{main article|Entropic gravity}} 
In 2009, [[Erik Verlinde]] argued that gravity can be explained as an entropic force.&lt;ref name="Verlinde2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verlinde |first=Erik |doi=10.1007/JHEP04(2011)029 |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics  |volume=2011 |issue=4 |pages=29 |title=On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton |bibcode = 2011JHEP...04..029V |arxiv = 1001.0785 |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It claimed (similar to Jacobson's result) that gravity is a consequence of the "information associated with the positions of material bodies". This model combines the thermodynamic approach to gravity with [[Gerard 't Hooft]]'s [[holographic principle]]. It implies that gravity is not a [[fundamental interaction]], but an [[emergent phenomenon]].&lt;ref name="Verlinde2011"/&gt;

===Other forces===
In the wake of the discussion started by Verlinde, entropic explanations for other fundamental forces have been suggested,&lt;ref name="visser2011"/&gt; including [[Coulomb's law]],&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4965, ''Coulomb Force as an Entropic Force'', T. Wang&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4631, ''Simple field theoretical approach of Coulomb systems. Entropic effects'', D. di Caprio, J.P. Badiali, M. Holovko&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5561, ''Entropic Corrections to Coulomb's Law, '' A. Sheykhi, S. H. Hendi&lt;/ref&gt; the [[electroweak]] and [[strong force]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4147,'' Emergent Gauge Fields'', Peter G.O. Freund&lt;/ref&gt; The same approach was argued to explain [[dark matter]], [[dark energy]] and [[Pioneer anomaly|Pioneer effect]].&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1506 ''Unification of Dark Matter and Dark Energy in a Modified Entropic Force Model'', Zhe Chang, Ming-Hua Li, Xin Li&lt;/ref&gt;

==Links to adaptive behavior==
It was argued that [[causal entropic force]]s lead to spontaneous emergence of tool use and social cooperation.&lt;ref name="Freer-A"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wissner-Gross | first1 = A.D. | authorlink1 = Alexander Wissner-Gross | last2 = Freer | first2 = C.E. | authorlink2 = Cameron Freer | year = 2013 | title = Causal Entropic Forces | url = http://www.alexwg.org/publications/PhysRevLett_110-168702.pdf | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 110 | issue = 16 | pages = 168702| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.168702 | pmid = 23679649 |bibcode = 2013PhRvL.110p8702W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.4375, ''Comment on Phys.

Kappen&lt;/ref&gt; Causal entropic forces by definition maximize entropy production between the present and future time horizon, rather than just greedily maximizing instantaneous entropy production like typical entropic forces.

A formal simultaneous connection between the mathematical structure of the discovered laws of nature, intelligence and the entropy-like measures of complexity was previously noted in 2000 by Andrei Soklakov&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0009007, ''Andrei N.

[[Image:GIUK gap.png|thumb|350px|The GIUK gap in the North [[Atlantic]]]]
The '''GIUK gap''' is an area in the northern [[Atlantic Ocean]] that forms a [[naval warfare|naval]] [[choke point]]. Its name is an [[acronym]] for ''[[Greenland]], [[Iceland]]'', and the ''[[United Kingdom]]'', the gap being the open ocean between these three landmasses. The term is typically used in relation to military topics.

==Importance to the Royal Navy==

The GIUK gap was particularly important to the [[Royal Navy]], as any attempt by northern European forces to break into the open Atlantic would have to be made either through the heavily defended [[English Channel]], one of the world's busiest seaways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-searchandrescue/mcga-hmcgsar-sarsystem/channel_navigation_information_service__cnis_/the_dover_strait.htm| title=The Dover Strait| publisher=[[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]]| year=2007| accessdate=2010-04-17| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831173118/http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-searchandrescue/mcga-hmcgsar-sarsystem/channel_navigation_information_service__cnis_/the_dover_strait.htm| archivedate=2010-08-31| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or through one of the exits on either side of [[Iceland]]. As the British also control the strategic port of [[Gibraltar]] at the entrance to the [[Mediterranean]], this means [[Spain]], [[France]], and [[Portugal]] are the only Continental European countries that possess direct access to the Atlantic Ocean that cannot easily be blocked at a choke point by the Royal Navy.

==History==
Since the beginning of the twentieth century, the exploitation of the GIUK gap by northern forces and measures to patrol and secure the gap by opposing forces have played an important role in naval and in overall military planning.

===World War II===
From the start of [[World War II]] in 1939, German ships used the gap to break out from their bases in northern [[Germany]] (and from [[German U-boat bases in occupied Norway|occupied Norway]] after April 1940) with a view to attacking Allied shipping [[convoy]]s, but Allied blocking efforts in the [[North Sea]] and in the GIUK gap impeded such break-outs. British forces [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands|occupied the Faroe Islands]] in April 1940, and [[Invasion of Iceland|Iceland]] in May 1940; the [[United States|United States of America]] took over effective control of Greenland in 1940. But the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' profited greatly from the [[fall of France]] in June 1940, after which German [[submarine]]s could operate from bases on the French coast. Between 1940 and 1942, the [[Denmark Strait]] between Iceland and Greenland remained one of the few areas that [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[patrol bomber]]s could not reach, and thus became the centre for considerable action.

The origin of the term "gap" dates to this period, when there was a gap in air coverage known as the [[Mid-Atlantic gap]] or the "Greenland air gap". This gap was an area that land-based aircraft could not reach and where, as a result, they could not carry out their [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] duties. The air-surveillance gap eventually closed in 1943 when longer-ranged versions of aircraft such as the [[Short Sunderland]] and [[B-24 Liberator]] came into service.

===Cold War===
The GIUK gap again became the focus of naval planning in the 1950s, as it represented the only available outlet into the Atlantic Ocean for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] submarines operating from their bases on the [[Kola Peninsula]].  [[NATO]] worried that if the [[Cold War]] "turned hot", naval convoys reinforcing Europe from the U.S. would suffer unacceptable losses if Soviet submarines could operate in the North Atlantic. The United States and Britain based much of their post-war naval strategy on blocking the gap, installing a chain of underwater listening posts right across it during the 1950s - an example of a  [[SOSUS]] "sound surveillance system". This deployment of sonar surveillance in the gap, and elsewhere, hampered the Soviet [[Northern Fleet]]'s ability to deploy its submarines without detection.&lt;ref name="Sasgen 2009 p. 44"&gt;{{cite book | last=Sasgen | first=P. | title=Stalking the Red Bear: The True Story of a U.S. Cold War Submarine's Covert Operations Against the Soviet Union | publisher=St. Martin's Press | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-4299-6697-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZG3KtuVqVoC&amp;pg=PT44 | access-date=2018-03-13 | page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Navy's primary mission during the Cold War, excluding its nuclear deterrent role, involved [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW). The development of the [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|''Invincible''-class anti-submarine carriers]] stemmed from this [[military doctrine|doctrine]]: their primary mission involved anti-submarine warfare using [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] helicopters. The [[Type 23 frigate]] originated as a pure ASW platform; its mission expanded following the [[Falklands War]] of 1982.

The Soviets planned to use the GIUK gap to intercept any [[NATO]] ships, especially [[aircraft carriers]], heading towards the Soviet Union.  Ships and submarines as well as [[Tupolev Tu-142]] maritime-surveillance aircraft aimed to track any threatening ships.

The advent of longer-ranged Soviet submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBM's) allowed the Soviet Navy to deploy their ballistic missile submarine (SSBN's) within protected bastions in the Barents Sea and reduced their need to transit the GIUK gap. The much reduced, post-Cold War Russian Navy has even less need to transit the GIUK gap.

Crossing the GIUK gap was a major strategic move for Ocean Venture in 1992, in which 84 NATO ships, including 4 US aircraft carriers, departed from their usual August exercise pattern, deployed a decoy south toward the mid-Atlantic, and then entered waters in a move that had historically been associated with a risk of destabilizing detante.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=usnavalwarcollege|title=CSF 2017 {{!}} John F.

==Bird migration==
The GIUK gap is also a route for [[bird migration|migratory bird]]s such as the [[northern wheatear]] to cross the Atlantic to reach Greenland and eastern Canada.

==In popular culture==
* The GIUK line is mentioned in the film ''[[The Bedford Incident]]''.  
* In [[Tom Clancy]]'s first novel ''[[The Hunt for Red October]]'', the line was used to detect Soviet submarines entering the [[North Atlantic]] in pursuit of the rogue [[Typhoon-class submarine]] ''Red October'', whose officers were defecting to the [[United States]] with clandestine stealth technology. The event causes significant political and military tension between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].
* In Clancy's second novel ''[[Red Storm Rising]]'', the line is featured more prominently after a war breaks out between [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The [[Soviet Union]] launches a surprise attack on the NATO airbase [[NAS Keflavik]] and invades [[Iceland]]. This causes the line to be destroyed, creating a gap in NATO's surveillance and allowing the [[Soviet Navy]] to enter the [[North Atlantic]]. The subsequent Soviet submarine attacks and air raids cause serious damage to [[US Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] ships and naval vessels in [[Exercise Reforger|Atlantic convoys]], hindering NATO's war effort during the defense against the less-successful Soviet invasion of [[West Germany]]
* Early editions of the ''[[Harpoon (computer game)|Harpoon]]'' naval warfare simulation were based around defending the GIUK Gap. Tom Clancy used the simulation to test the naval battles for ''[[Red Storm Rising]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerharpoon.com/hce|title=Harpoon Naval Warfare Simulation Game - AGSI - Harpoon Commanders Edition (HCE)}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The location of Iceland in the gap made it a participant in the Cold War and a target for a nuclear strike, especially through the introduction of the aforementioned atomic bomber NATO base. [[Halldór Laxness]] dramatized the tension of these geopolitics from the perspective of an Icelandic maid in the novel ''[[The Atom Station]]''.

The '''Himalayan Geothermal Belt''' (HGB) is a region that extends for {{convert|3000|km}} through India, Tibet, Yunnan, Myanmar and Thailand, and that contains many geothermal fields.

==Location==

The Himalayan Geothermal Belt was formed as a result of the collision of the [[Indian Plate]] with the [[Eurasian Plate]], which created the [[Himalayas]].
The belt is more than {{convert|150|km}} wide.{{sfn|Himalayan Geothermal Belt, Geothermal Education Office}}
The HGB has an extension to the westward that shows in warm or hot springs in the [[Peshawar]] region of Pakistan. 
These are clustered along the Main Karakoram Thrust, Main Mantle Thrust and Main Central Thrust.{{sfn|Hochstein|Regenauer-Lieb|1998|p=75}}
Some authors consider that the belt extends yet further west and should be called the Mediterranean-Himalayan Geothermal Belt.{{sfn|Dor|Zhao|2000|p=1083}}

==Mechanisms==

Heat transfer in the HGB mainly occurs in "heat bands", {{convert|30|to|50|km}} wide, within which there are at least 600 associated geothermal systems. 
These may be interpreted as segments of [[Strike-slip tectonics|slip line]]s caused by deformation of the ductile crust in the Asian [[tectonic plate]].
In the eastern Himalayas the heat bands transfer two to three times as much heat as in the western Himalayas. 
This may be due to the Indian plate rotating in a counter-clockwise direction as it penetrates the Asian plate.{{sfn|Hochstein|Regenauer-Lieb|1998|p=75}}
The thermal waters in Tibet were thought to be meteoric in origin, and the heat source to be decaying radioactive nuclides. 
Due to studies in the 1990s and deep drilling results it is now thought that the heat source is granite that has remelted to magma due to the collision of the plates.{{sfn|Dor|Zhao|2000|p=1083}}

The warmest hot spring in the westward extension at {{convert|68|°C}} is the [[Garam Chashma]] Hot Springs, which emerge from in post-collisional [[leucogranite]]s of the [[Hindu Kush]] Range that date from  20–18 Ma. Reservoir temperatures may be as high as {{convert|260|°C}}.
It is not clear whether the circulation of deep groundwater in this region is driven by topography or by tectonic lateral stress.{{sfn|Hochstein|Regenauer-Lieb|1998|p=75}}

==Commercial potential==

More than 150 of the geothermal fields have the potential to generate energy.{{sfn|Himalayan Geothermal Belt, Geothermal Education Office}}
There is a binary plant in Thailand that generates 300 kWe from 117 degrees C water.{{sfn|Himalayan Geothermal Belt, Geothermal Education Office}}
The [[Yangbajain Geothermal Field]] is in the [[Lhasa-Gangdise terrane]].{{sfn|Shen|1996|p=25}}
It is in an active part of a slip-fault zone of the [[Nyainqentanglha Mountains]] and fractured Himalayan granite. 
A shallow reservoir has temperatures up to {{convert|165|°C}}, while a deep reservoir has temperatures up to {{convert|329|°C}}. 
The first 1&amp;nbsp;MWe turbine came into operation in September 1977, and capacity had been increased to 25.18&amp;nbsp;MWe by 1991.{{sfn|Dor|Zhao|2000|p=1083}}
As of 2007 another 7 MWe was being generated by seven small plants in Tibet and Yunnan.{{sfn|Eckstein|Yousafza|Dahl|2007}}

"'''Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily'''" is the third episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on October 1, 1995. In the episode, the Simpson children are put in the custody of [[Ned Flanders|Ned]] and [[Maude Flanders]] after a series of misadventures. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] are forced to attend a parenting class so they can get their children back. Learning that none of the children have been [[baptized]], Flanders sets up a baptism, but Homer and Marge are able to stop him just in time.

The episode was written by [[Jon Vitti]] and directed by [[Susie Dietter]]. The story was pitched by another writer on the show, [[George Meyer]]. It was the first episode on which writers [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] served as [[show runner]]s. The episode features cultural references to the 1965 film ''[[Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!]]'' and [[Sonny &amp; Cher]]'s song "[[I Got You Babe]]". Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a [[Nielsen rating]] of 9.0, and was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.

==Plot==
When [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] is sent home from school with [[head lice]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] without shoes, Marge and Homer are accused of being negligent parents. Two [[Child Protective Services]] agents arrive at their house and take Bart, Lisa, and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] to a [[foster home]]—right next door, at the house of [[Ned Flanders]]. 

Bart and Lisa hate living with the Flanders, but Maggie enjoys it as she gets more attention from Flanders than she did with Homer. Meanwhile, Homer and Marge are forced to attend a special class for bad parents so they can get their children back. 

When Flanders finds out that the children were not [[baptized]], he takes it upon himself to give the kids an emergency baptism. When Homer and Marge are declared decent parents, they quickly head for the Springfield River to stop Flanders. Just as Flanders is about to pour [[holy water]] on Bart, Homer shoves Bart over to prevent the water from hitting him. The Simpson family is reunited, and they head home together.

==Production==
"Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily" was the first episode to be made after [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] became [[show runner]]s of ''The Simpsons''. They wanted to start the season with an episode centering on the Simpson family.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"&gt;{{cite video |people=Weinstein, Josh |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] by writer [[George Meyer]] at a story retreat. Story retreats were held twice a year at a hotel room close to the studio lot, where all the writers gathered to pitch their ideas.&lt;ref name="Vitti"&gt;{{cite video |people=Vitti, Jon |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen episodes were pitched at this particular story retreat. Out of them all, Weinstein considered this episode to be the best, and he thought the pitch by Meyer was the best he had ever heard.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt; Oakley and Weinstein selected former full-time staff writer [[Jon Vitti]] to write the episode, wanting a "heavy hitter", since it was going to start the seventh production season. Vitti retained in his script most of what Meyer pitched at the retreat.&lt;ref name="Oakley"&gt;{{cite video |people=Oakley, Bill |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was directed by [[Susie Dietter]]. There is a statue portraying ''The Simpsons'' writer [[John Swartzwelder]] outside the courthouse in the episode. Oakley said that this was a mistake because he and Weinstein thought that [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] was located in [[Swartzwelder County]], incorrectly going off a montage in the [[The Simpsons (season 3)|season three]] episode "[[Dog of Death]]". That montage depicts Springfield as being located in [[Springfield County]]; Swartzwelder is the adjoining county.&lt;ref name="Oakley"/&gt; The appearance of the female Child Protective Services agent is based on a teacher both Oakley and Weinstein had in high school that they hated.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt; [[List of cast members of The Simpsons|Cast]] member [[Hank Azaria]]'s [[voice acting|voice]] for the character [[Cletus Spuckler|Cletus]] was slightly distorted in this episode because, over the summer between seasons, Azaria and the producers had forgotten what Cletus sounds like.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt;

==Cultural references==
Ned and Maude Flanders sing Maggie to bed with their own version of [[Sonny &amp; Cher]]'s song "[[I Got You Babe]]". The ''[[Itchy &amp; Scratchy]]'' cartoon that Lisa and Bart watch is called "Foster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!", a reference to the 1965 film ''[[Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!]]''. Flanders says that he used to let his sons watch ''[[My Three Sons]]'', but it got them "all worked up" before bedtime.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The headline of a newspaper that Marge gives to Lisa for her history project is "40 Trampled at Poco Concert", a reference to American rock band [[Poco]].&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Groening |editor1-first=Ray |editor1-last=Richmond |editor1-link=Ray Richmond |editor2-first=Antonia |editor2-last=Coffman |title=[[The Simpsons episode guides#The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family|The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family]]  |edition=1st |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=[[HarperPerennial]] |lccn=98141857 |ol=433519M |oclc=37796735 |isbn=978-0-06-095252-5 |page=183 |ref={{harvid|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While riding in Flanders's car, Maggie spins her head around with a scary smile on her face to look at Bart and Lisa, as in the 1973 film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.&lt;ref name="Dietter"&gt;{{cite video |people=Dietter, Susie |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, the episode finished 53rd in the ratings for the week of September 25 to October 1, 1995, with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 9.0.&lt;ref name=ratings&gt;{{cite news |title=Nielsen Ratings |date=October 5, 1995 |page=4 |work=[[The Tampa Tribune]]}} Retrieved on January 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', and ''[[Melrose Place]]''.&lt;ref name=ratings/&gt;

Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode, saying that "its best elements come from the amusing bizarreness of the Flanders home, but Homer and Marge’s classes are also fun. Chalk this one up as season seven's first great episode."&lt;ref name=dvdmovieguide&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2008-12-01 |url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonseven.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season (1995) |publisher=DVD Movie Guide |date=2006-01-05 |author=Jacobson, Colin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Marge tells Bart and Lisa that someday they will have to be adults and take care of themselves, just before Homer comes to Marge about a spider near his car keys. She concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-12-01 |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason7.php |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=2006-01-16 |author=Malkowski, Judge |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204055914/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason7.php |archivedate=2008-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it "one of the most disturbing episodes, as Bart and Lisa are dragged into the Flanders' sinister lifestyle." They thought the ending, when Ned tries to baptize the children, was "nail-biting stuff", and Maggie speaking was "a truly shocking moment". The authors added: "It's astonishing that anything this radical made it on to prime time television. The final moments are perhaps the most moving in the entire series, a wonderful affirmation of everything the series, and the Simpson family, are about."&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season7/page3.shtml |title=Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily |accessdate=2009-01-04 |author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matt Groening]], the creator of ''The Simpsons'', thought the episode was "fantastic" and he called it one of his favorites. He particularly liked the ending which he thought was "sweet".&lt;ref name="Groening"&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents ==

This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. '''For natural gas alone''', the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987.

A "significant incident" results in any of the following consequences:
* fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization
* $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars
* liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel)
* releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion

PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. PHMSA Corrective Action Orders are at https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/CAO_opid_0.html. PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation-reports. NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

* On January 7, 2003, at a “high consequence area” in [[Anaheim, California]], a downed power line struck a [[Southern California Gas]] casing vent; electricity travelled along the casing and arced onto the natural gas transmission line inside the casing, perforating the steel pipe with a one-inch puncture. Two more leaks were found at locations where the electricity left the transmission line. The pipe was manufactured in 1947.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 2002-2009, PHMSA Pipeline Incident Flagged Files, https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 24, an [[Enbridge]] crude oil pipeline ruptured at a terminal in [[Douglas County, Wisconsin]]. Some of the crude oil flowed into the [[Nemadji River]]. Over {{convert|100,000|USgal|L}} were spilled.&lt;ref name="nwf"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fuel Oil Incident List |url=http://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/Media-Center/News-by-Topic/Global-Warming/2010/~/media/PDFs/Global%20Warming/Reports/Full-Oil-Incident-List.ashx |accessdate=October 30, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803143750/http://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/Media-Center/News-by-Topic/Global-Warming/2010/~/media/PDFs/Global%20Warming/Reports/Full-Oil-Incident-List.ashx |archivedate=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 2, a natural gas pipeline ruptured near [[Viola, Illinois]], resulting in the release of natural gas which ignited. A l6-foot section of the pipe fractured into three sections, which were ejected to distances of about 300 yards from the failure site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Re: CPF No. 3-2003-1002-H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320031002H/320031002H_CAO_02072003.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311083600/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320031002H/320031002H_CAO_02072003.pdf |archivedate=March 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 24-inch diameter natural gas transmission pipeline ruptured and a fire resulted on the ANR southwest mainline about 5 miles upstream of the New Windsor compressor station. Thirty people were evacuated as a precaution. Investigators found that the failure occurred in part due to cold weather acting on a major sag bend passing under a creek bed. The ambient temperatures contributed to pipe contraction and saturated soil over the pipe increased frost heave, apparently flexing the pipe until it separated around its circumference at a seam. The pipe was manufactured in 1949.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;
* On February 20, a 24-inch gas transmission pipeline started leaking in [[Scott County, Missouri]], underneath the [[Mississippi River]]. A shifted pipeline weight has caused damage to the pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No 3-2003-1005-H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320031005H/320031005h_cao_03042003_text.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224172944/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320031005H/320031005h_cao_03042003_text.pdf |archivedate=February 24, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On or about February 22, 2003, approximately 788 barrels of gasoline were discharged from a portion of [[Plantation Pipeline]] in [[Hull, Georgia]], some of which entered into an unnamed tributary of East Sandy Creek and its adjoining shorelines. The spill resulted from a failed gasket on a buried block valve.
* On February 27, dropping temperatures caused an [[Enbridge]] pipeline to fail in [[Samaria, Michigan]]. 130 barrels of crude oil were spilled.
* On March 13, a seam failed on an 8-inch Dixie Pipeline propane line near [[Appling, Georgia]], releasing about 110,000 gallons of propane. There were no injuries. The pipe split due to seam failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Re: CPF No. 2-2003-5002H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/220035002H/220035002h_cao_03242003_text.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215131725/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/220035002H/220035002h_cao_03242003_text.pdf |archivedate=February 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/271056 |title=March 13, 2003 – ProPublica |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714135720/http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/271056 |archivedate=July 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 23, a 24-inch [[El Paso Natural Gas]] pipeline near [[Eaton, Colorado]] exploded. The explosion sent flames 160 meters in the air, forcing evacuations. No one was injured. The heat from the flames melted the siding of two nearby houses and started many smaller grass fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Re: CPF No, 5-2003-1002H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/520031002H/520031002h_corrective%20action%20order_04032003_text.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028015353/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/520031002H/520031002h_corrective%20action%20order_04032003_text.pdf |archivedate=October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 1, a 12-inch [[ConocoPhillips]] petroleum products pipeline ruptured, spilling about 1,000 barrels of diesel fuel near [[Ponca City, Oklahoma]], with most of the fuel getting into Doga Creek. There were no injuries. Low Frequency ERW pipe seam failure was suspected as the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Re: CPF No. 4-2003-S009H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420035009H/CPF420035009H.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207182901/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420035009H/CPF420035009H.pdf |archivedate=February 7, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 2, 2003, at [[Playa del Rey, California]], atmospheric corrosion caused a pinhole leak on a [[Southern California Gas]] instrument gas supply line, resulting in an unplanned emergency shutdown. After shutdown, the blowdown released natural gas and liquids (crude oil and water) into the atmosphere, causing mist damage to neighboring homes, landscaping and vehicles. The faulty part was installed in 1970. Public and private property damage was $2,395,000.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;
* On May 1, a 26-inch [[Williams Companies]] natural gas transmission pipeline failed near [[Lake Tapps, Washington]]. About 120 people were evacuated from a neighboring elementary school, a supermarket, and 30 to 40 houses in approximately a {{convert|4|mi|km|adj=on}} area. There was no fire or injuries. Land movement was suspected at first, but the failure was later determined to be from [[stress corrosion cracking]]. There were four previous failures on this pipeline in the preceding eight years. The pipe was manufactured and installed in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Re: CPF No. 5-2003-1003-8 |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/520031003H/520031003H.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209173544/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/520031003H/520031003H.pdf |archivedate=February 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="primis.phmsa.dot.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 5-2003-1003-8 |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/520031003H/520031003HA.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220173528/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/520031003H/520031003HA.pdf |archivedate=February 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 8, an 8-inch LPG pipeline failed near [[Lebanon, Ohio]]. About 80 houses and one school in the area were evacuated. There was no fire or injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Re: CPF No. 3-2003-5014H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320035014H/320035014H_CAO_05162003.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211092103/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/Comm/Reports/enforce/documents/320035014H/320035014H_CAO_05162003.pdf |archivedate=February 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 20, a 30-inch gas transmission pipeline exploded and burned near [[Nederland, Texas]]. The cause of the failure was internal corrosion, and the damages were estimated to be $6,901,322.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firehouse.com/topic/rescue-and-special-ops/natural-gas-pipeline-explodes-texas |title=Natural Gas Pipeline Explodes in Texas |publisher=Firehouse |date=May 21, 2003 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/271121 |title=May 20, 2003 – ProPublica |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020202955/http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/271121 |archivedate=October 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Houston Pipeline Company explosion did public and private property damage of $5,170,000. The cause of the leak was galvanic corrosion on the part installed in 1975. The rupture and fire damaged nearby electric lines and several unoccupied buildings that were part of the Sunoco terminal facility.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;
* On June 17, 2003, at [[West Salem, Wisconsin]], a canoeist reported seeing bubbles in the Lacrosse River and noted the pipeline signs. Investigators found a Northern Natural Gas pipe exposed in the river bottom. The leak was from a circumferential crack that appears to have started to crease in the pipe during its original installation in 1963.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;
* On July 2, 2003, a small single engine aircraft had mechanical failure shortly after takeoff from the [[Linden, New Jersey]] airport and was forced to attempt an emergency landing at the Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Duke) compressor station. The aircraft collided with some pipeline facilities resulting in nearly $60,000 damage to the natural gas compressor station.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; 
* On July 2, excavation damage to a natural gas distribution line resulted in an explosion and fire in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. A contractor hired by the city of Wilmington to replace sidewalk and curbing, dug into an unmarked natural gas service line with a backhoe. Although the service line did not leak where it was struck, the contact resulted in a break in the line inside the basement of a nearby building, where gas began to accumulate. A manager for the contractor said that he did not smell gas and therefore did not believe there was imminent danger and that he called an employee of the gas company and left a voice mail message. At approximately 1:44&amp;nbsp;p.m., an explosion destroyed two residences and damaged two others to the extent that they had to be demolished. Other nearby residences sustained some damage, and the residents on the block were displaced from their houses for about a week. Three contractor employees sustained serious injuries. Eleven additional people sustained minor injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAB0401.pdf |format=PDF |title=National Transportation Safety Board |date=July 2, 2003 |website=Ntsb.gov |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203115859/http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAB0401.pdf |archivedate=February 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On July 3, a jury found Texas-New Mexico Pipeline (TNMP) Company guilty of fraud, gross negligence and willful misconduct in concealing a 1992 crude oil pipeline leak beneath a [[Midland, Texas]] residential subdivision, before selling the pipeline to EOTT Energy in 1999. Oil was discovered in the water table in late 2000, and in March 2001 a group of Midland residents sued EOTT, TNMP and Equilon. Residents living on affected land also received settlements. The spill was estimated in 2003 to be 9,000–13,000 barrels. 190 boxes full of TNMP documents about the pipeline dating from the late 1980s to early 1990s (prior to EOTT Energy taking over the pipeline) were dug up from a 45-foot-deep hole at a site along the company's pipeline in New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/070303/reg_070303068.shtml |title=Texas-New Mexico Pipeline Co. found guilty of negligence in Midland oil leak &amp;#124; Lubbock Online &amp;#124; Lubbock Avalanche-Journal |publisher=Lubbock Online |date=July 3, 2003 |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130110820/http://lubbockonline.com/stories/070303/reg_070303068.shtml |archivedate=January 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2003/06/09/newscolumn1.html?page=all |title=More pipeline documents may be collecting dust near Midland |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025065451/http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2003/06/09/newscolumn1.html?page=all |archivedate=October 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On July 10, a 16-inch diameter [[Citgo]] petroleum products pipeline failed in [[Cook County, Illinois]]. About 25 barrels of gasoline were spilled from the pipeline. A crack in the pipe had developed at a dent.

* On July 30, a [[Kinder Morgan]] pipeline in [[Tucson, Arizona]] ruptured and sprayed 16,548 gallons of gasoline on five houses under construction, flooding nearby streets with gasoline. The resulting pipeline closure caused major gas shortages and price increases in the state. The failure at first was thought to be from LF [[Electric resistance welding|ERW]] flaws, but tests showed it was due to [[stress corrosion cracking]]. A hydrostatic test that was performed on this pipeline after repairs failed again {{convert|40|ft|m}} from the first failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Re: CPF No. 4-2003-$0108 |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420035010H/420035010H.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209173530/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420035010H/420035010H.pdf |archivedate=February 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/12news/news/articles/0820gas-main20-ON-CP.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120719031704/http://www.azcentral.com/12news/news/articles/0820gas-main20-ON-CP.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 19, 2012 |title=Pipeline fails tests; gas shortage likely to continue |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=August 20, 2003 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:t9p8LUOjuhIJ:www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/congress/2003_h/031009-bannigan.doc+kinder+morgan+arizona+pipeline+failure&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESg8hYg86MCQY-i1SSpC-LhS3cL279Iin8fPjcY0Hhd_iPnaHrkKkURTBaX62d8mArqYe8Qlz_pMKohUdKElB1OSBK-K_84Q2AJWNaup8w3YQXxN6VdBnpo3UAbLvGUMMjdCzpVr&amp;sig=AHIEtbQ4teiQyeIt8vRqcO3Zlsh3wScSeQ |title=Google Drive Viewer |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/Alispdfs/46leg/1r/House/ArizonaFuelSupplyReport111303.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – ArizonaFuelSupplyReport11_13_03.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028121307/http://www.azleg.state.az.us/Alispdfs/46leg/1r/House/ArizonaFuelSupplyReport111303.pdf |archivedate=October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/271171 |title=July 30, 2003 – ProPublica |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714134204/http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/271171 |archivedate=July 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 8, a 26-inch [[Kinder Morgan]] and Myria Holdings [[Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America]] transmission pipeline ruptured in [[Caddo County, Oklahoma]], releasing about 84,000 MCF of natural gas. A 54-foot long section of 26" diameter pipe had blown out and landed 30 feet from the ditch. Evacuations took place within 3/4 of a mile from the release, but there was no fire or casualties. [[Stress corrosion cracking]] was identified as the pipe failure's cause. The 26-inch diameter pipe was manufactured in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHMSA Corrective Action Order, CPF No.4-2003-1008H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420031008H/420031008H.pdf |accessdate=28 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209173459/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420031008H/420031008H.pdf |archivedate=February 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On October 14, a leak on what was originally the [[Big Inch]] 24-inch diameter natural gas transmission pipeline occurred in [[Orange County, Indiana]]. There were no injuries or evacuations. The longitudinal crack was attributed to external corrosion; the pipe had been installed in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 3-2003-1010H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320031010H/320031010H_CAO_10242003.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208175830/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320031010H/320031010H_CAO_10242003.pdf |archivedate=February 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 2, a Texas Eastern Transmission natural gas pipeline exploded in [[Bath County, Kentucky]], about 1.5&amp;nbsp;km south of a [[Duke Energy]] pumping station. A fire burned for about an hour before firefighters extinguished it. No one was injured and no property damage was reported. Investigators found that the pipe, manufactured in 1957, had two separate manufacturing defects.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;
* On November 9, an 8-inch [[Buckeye Partners]] pipeline failed near [[Mazon, Illinois]]. While repairs were being tested on this pipeline on November 14, another section of this pipeline failed about 1500 feet from the first leak. About ten barrels of gasoline and diesel fuel were spilled by the two leaks, requiring soil removal. External corrosion caused both failures. There were no injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 3-2003-5026H|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 13, another section of the same [[Williams Companies]] gas transmission pipeline that failed on May 1, 2003, failed in [[Lewis County, Washington]]. There was no fire this time. Gas flowed for three hours before being shut off. Gas pressure had already been reduced 20% on this pipeline after the May 1 explosion. External corrosion and [[stress corrosion cracking]] were seen in this 26-inch diameter pipe, which had been manufactured in 1956.&lt;ref name="primis.phmsa.dot.gov"/&gt;

[[Illinois]] has a variety of [[protected area]]s, including 123 state protected areas - [[state park]]s, [[wildlife area]]s, [[recreation area]]s, [[nature reserve]]s, and [[state forest]]s. There are also federal and local level protected areas in the state. These levels interact to provide a variety of recreation opportunities and conservation schemes, sometimes in a small area. For instance, {{convert|1500|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[Shabbona Lake State Park]] lies in DeKalb County which has its own {{convert|1000|acre|km2|sing=on}} forest preserve system, while the city of DeKalb has a {{convert|700|acre|km2|sing=on}} park system. There is one [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in Illinois, [[Cahokia]].

==Overview==
Illinois has a wide variety of state owned and administered [[protected area]]s: state parks, state forests, state recreation areas, state fish and wildlife areas, state natural areas, and one state trail. They are all administered by the [[Illinois Department of Natural Resources]]. In addition, several of the state historic sites, administered by its [[Illinois Historic Preservation Division]], also include nature reserves.

There is also one [[United States National Forest|national forest]], [[Shawnee National Forest]], and several other sites administered by the [[National Park Service]], including portions of National Trails. There are also [[National Wildlife Refuge]]s.

'''Macroecology''' is the subfield of [[ecology]] that deals with the study of relationships between organisms and their [[natural environment|environment]] at large spatial scales to characterise and explain statistical patterns of abundance, distribution and diversity.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}  The term was coined by [[James Brown (ecologist)|James Brown]] of the [[University of New Mexico]] and Brian Maurer of [[Michigan State University]] in a 1989 paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brown J.H. &amp; Maurer B.A. (1989) Macroecology: the division of food and space among species on continents. [[Science (journal)|Science]], 243, 1145-1150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Macroecology approaches the idea of studying [[ecosystem]]s using a "top down" approach.  It seeks understanding through the study of the properties of the system as a whole; Kevin Gaston and Tim Blackburn make the analogy to seeing the forest for the trees.&lt;ref name = "Gaston&amp;Blackbun"&gt;Gaston, K.J. and T.M. Blackburn. 2000. ''Pattern and Process in Macroecology''.  Blackwell Science. {{ISBN|0-632-05653-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macroecology examines how global development in climate change affect [[wildlife]] populations. Classic ecological questions amenable to study through the techniques of macroecology include questions of [[species richness]], [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]], the [[species-area curve]], range size, body size, and [[abundance (ecology)|species abundance]].  For example, the relationship between abundance and range size (why species that maintain large local population sizes tend to be widely distributed, while species that are less abundant tend to have restricted ranges) has received much attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first= J.H.| title= Macroecology| year= 1995| publisher= University of Chicago Press| isbn= 0-226-07614-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40255">'''Mass in special relativity''' incorporates the general understandings from the laws of motion of special relativity along with its concept of [[mass–energy equivalence]]. The word ''[[mass]]'' is given two meanings in [[special relativity]]: one (''rest'' or ''invariant mass'', and its equivalent ''rest energy'') is an invariant quantity which is the same for all observers in all reference frames; the other (''relativistic mass'' or the equivalent ''total energy'' of the body) is dependent on the velocity of the observer. The term ''relativistic mass''  tends not to be used in particle and nuclear physics and is often avoided by writers on special relativity.&lt;ref name=roche&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roche |first=J |year=2005 |title=What is mass? |journal=[[European Journal of Physics]] |volume=26 |issue= 2|page=225 |arxiv= |bibcode= 2005EJPh...26..225R|doi=10.1088/0143-0807/26/2/002 |url=http://www.marco-learningsystems.com/pages/roche/what-is-mass.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They do, however, talk about the (total) energy of a body, which is the equivalent to its relativistic mass, rather than the rest energy equivalent to its rest mass.  The measurable inertia and gravitational attraction of a body in a given frame of reference is determined by its relativistic mass, not merely its rest mass.  For example, light has zero rest mass but contributes to the inertia (and weight in a gravitational field) of any system containing it.

== Terminology ==
The term ''mass'' in special relativity usually refers to the rest mass of the object, which is the Newtonian mass as measured by an observer moving along with the object. The ''[[invariant mass]]'' is another name for the ''rest mass'' of single particles. The more general invariant mass (calculated with a more complicated formula) loosely corresponds to the "rest mass" of a "system". Thus, invariant mass is a natural unit of mass used for systems which are being viewed from their [[center of momentum]] frame (COM frame), as when any closed system (for example a bottle of hot gas) is weighed, which requires that the measurement be taken in the center of momentum frame where the system has no net momentum. Under such circumstances the invariant mass is equal to the relativistic mass (discussed below), which is the total energy of the system divided by ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (the [[speed of light]] squared).

The concept of invariant mass does not require bound systems of particles, however. As such, it may also be applied to systems of unbound particles in high-speed relative motion. Because of this, it is often employed in particle physics for systems which consist of widely separated high-energy particles. If such systems were derived from a single particle, then the calculation of the invariant mass of such systems, which is a never-changing quantity, will provide the rest mass of the parent particle (because it is conserved over time).

It is often convenient in calculation that the invariant mass of a system is the total energy of the system (divided by ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the COM frame (where, by definition, the momentum of the system is zero). However, since the invariant mass of any system is also the same quantity in all inertial frames, it is a quantity often calculated from the total energy in the COM frame, then used to calculate system energies and momenta in other frames where the momenta are not zero, and the system total energy will necessarily be a different quantity than in the COM frame. As with energy and momentum, the invariant mass of a system cannot be destroyed or changed, and it is thus conserved, so long as the system is closed to all influences. (The technical term is [[isolated system]] meaning that an idealized boundary is drawn around the system, and no mass/energy is allowed across it.)

The term ''relativistic mass'' is also sometimes used. This is the sum total quantity of energy in a body or system (divided by ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). As seen from the [[center of momentum]] frame, the relativistic mass is also the invariant mass, as discussed above (just as the relativistic energy of a single particle is the same as its rest energy, when seen from its rest frame). For other frames, the relativistic mass (of a body or system of bodies) includes a contribution from the "net" kinetic energy of the body (the kinetic energy of the [[center of mass]] of the body), and is larger the faster the body moves. Thus, unlike the invariant mass, the ''relativistic mass'' depends on the observer's [[frame of reference]]. However, for given single frames of reference and for isolated systems, the relativistic mass is also a conserved quantity.

Although some authors present relativistic mass as a ''fundamental'' concept of the theory, it has been argued that this is wrong as the fundamentals of the theory relate to space–time. There is disagreement over whether the concept is pedagogically useful.&lt;ref name=okun&gt;

Oxford lecturer John Roche states that relativistic mass is not referenced in nuclear and particle physics, and that about 60% of authors writing about special relativity do not introduce it.&lt;ref name=roche/&gt;

If a stationary box contains many particles, it weighs more in its rest frame, the faster the particles are moving. Any energy in the box (including the kinetic energy of the particles) adds to the mass, so that the relative motion of the particles contributes to the mass of the box. But if the box itself is moving (its [[center of mass]] is moving), there remains the question of whether the kinetic energy of the overall motion should be included in the mass of the system. The invariant mass is calculated excluding the kinetic energy of the system as a whole (calculated using the single velocity of the box, which is to say the velocity of the box's center of mass), while the relativistic mass is calculated including invariant mass ''plus'' the kinetic energy of the system which is calculated from the velocity of the center of mass.

Relativistic mass and rest mass are both traditional concepts in physics, but the relativistic mass corresponds to the total energy. The relativistic mass is the mass of the system as it would be measured on a scale, but in some cases (such as the box above) this fact remains true only because the system on average must be at rest to be weighed (it must have zero net momentum, which is to say, the measurement is in its [[center of momentum]] frame).  For example, if an electron in a [[cyclotron]] is moving in circles with a relativistic velocity, the mass of the cyclotron+electron system is increased by the relativistic mass of the electron, not by the electron's rest mass. But the same is also true of any closed system, such as an electron-and-box, if the electron bounces at high speed inside the box. It is only the lack of total momentum in the system (the system momenta sum to zero) which allows the kinetic energy of the electron to be "weighed." If the electron is ''stopped'' and weighed, or the scale were somehow sent after it, it would not be moving with respect to the scale, and again the relativistic and rest masses would be the same for the single electron (and would be smaller). In general, relativistic and rest masses are equal only in systems which have no net momentum and the system center of mass is at rest; otherwise they may be different.

The invariant mass is proportional to the value of the total energy in one reference frame, the frame where the object as a whole is at rest (as defined below in terms of center of mass). This is why the invariant mass is the same as the rest mass for single particles. However, the invariant mass also represents the measured mass when the [[center of mass]] is at rest for systems of many particles. This special frame where this occurs is also called the [[center of momentum frame]], and is defined as the [[inertial frame]] in which the [[center of mass]] of the object is at rest (another way of stating this is that it is the frame in which the momenta of the system's parts add to zero). For compound objects (made of many smaller objects, some of which may be moving) and sets of unbound objects (some of which may also be moving), only the center of mass of the system is required to be at rest, for the object's relativistic mass to be equal to its rest mass.

A so-called ''massless'' particle (such as a photon, or a theoretical graviton) moves at the speed of light in every frame of reference. In this case there is no transformation that will bring the particle to rest. The total energy of such particles becomes smaller and smaller in frames which move faster and faster in the same direction. As such, they have no rest mass, because they can never be measured in a frame where they are at rest. This property of having no rest mass is what causes these particles to be termed "massless." However, even massless particles have a relativistic mass, which varies with their observed energy in various frames of reference,

==Invariant mass==

The [[invariant mass]] is the ratio of [[four-momentum]] (the four-dimensional generalization of [[classical three-dimensional momentum|classical momentum]]) to [[four-velocity]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

:&lt;math&gt;p^\mu = m v^\mu\,&lt;/math&gt;

and is also the ratio of [[four-acceleration]] to [[four-force]] when the rest mass is constant. The four-dimensional form of Newton's second law is:
:&lt;math&gt;F^\mu = m A^\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

==The relativistic energy-momentum equation==
{{Refimprove|date=February 2016}}
[[File:Invariant and additive masses.svg|thumb|right|Dependency between the rest mass and ''E'', given in 4-momentum (''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) coordinates;&lt;br&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c'' = ''E''|427x427px]]
The relativistic expressions for ''E'' and ''p'' obey the relativistic [[energy–momentum relation]]:&lt;ref name=taylor /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 - (pc)^2 = \left(mc^2\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt; is the rest mass, or the invariant mass for systems, and ''E'' is the total energy.

The equation is also valid for photons, which have &lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0:
:&lt;math&gt;E^2 - (pc)^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore
:&lt;math&gt;E = pc&lt;/math&gt;

A photon's momentum is a function of its energy, but it is not proportional to the velocity, which is always c.

For an object at rest, the momentum &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt; is zero, therefore
:&lt;math&gt;E_0 = mc^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt; [true only for particles or systems with momentum = 0]

The rest mass is only proportional to the total energy in the rest frame of the object.

When the object is moving, the total energy is given by
:&lt;math&gt;E = \sqrt{\left(mc^2\right)^2 + (pc)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

To find the form of the momentum and energy as a function of velocity, it can be noted that the four-velocity, which is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\left(c, \vec{v}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, is the only four-vector associated with the particle's motion, so that if there is a conserved four-momentum &lt;math&gt;\left(E, \vec{p}c\right)&lt;/math&gt;, it must be proportional to this vector. This allows expressing the ratio of energy to momentum as
:&lt;math&gt;pc = E \frac{v}{c} &lt;/math&gt;,

resulting in a relation between &lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;v&lt;/var&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;E^2 = \left(mc^2\right)^2 + E^2 \frac{v^2}{c^2},&lt;/math&gt;

This results in 
:&lt;math&gt;E = {mc^2 \over \sqrt{1 - \displaystyle{v^2 \over c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;p = {mv \over \sqrt{1 - \displaystyle{v^2 \over c^2}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

these expressions can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;E_0 = mc^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;E = \gamma mc^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;p = mv \gamma \,.&lt;/math&gt;
:

where the factor &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

When working in [[system of units|units]] where ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, known as the [[natural unit system]], all the relativistic equations are simplified and the quantities [[energy]], [[momentum]], and [[mass]] have the same natural dimension:&lt;ref name="QFT"&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Field Theory |edition=2nd |first1=Franz |last1=Mandl |first2=Graham |last2=Shaw |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-118-71665-6 |page=70 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jTBzQfctvHAC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=jTBzQfctvHAC&amp;pg=PT70 Extract of page 70]&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;m^2 = E^2 - p^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The equation is often written this way because the difference &lt;math&gt;E^2 - p^2&lt;/math&gt; is the relativistic length of the energy [[4-momentum|momentum four-vector]], a length which is associated with rest mass or invariant mass in systems. Where ''m'' &gt; 0 and ''p'' = 0, this equation again expresses the mass-energy equivalence ''E'' = ''m''.

== The mass of composite systems ==
{{Refimprove|date=February 2016}}
The rest mass of a composite system is not the sum of the rest masses of the parts, unless all the parts are at rest. The total mass of a composite system includes the kinetic energy and field energy in the system.

The total energy ''E'' of a composite system can be determined by adding together the sum of the energies of its components. The total momentum &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; of the system, a vector quantity, can also be computed by adding together the momenta of all its components.  Given the total energy ''E'' and the length (magnitude) ''p'' of the total momentum vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;, the invariant mass is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - (pc)^2}}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

In a mathematical system where c = 1, for systems of particles (whether bound or unbound) the total system invariant mass is given equivalently by the following:

:&lt;math&gt; m^2 = \left(\sum E\right)^2 - \left\|\sum \vec{p} \ \right\|^2&lt;/math&gt;

Where, again, the particle momenta &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; are first summed as vectors, and then the square of their resulting total magnitude ([[Euclidean norm]]) is used. This results in a scalar number, which is subtracted from the scalar value of the square of the total energy.

For such a system, in the special [[center of momentum frame]] where momenta sum to zero, again the system mass (called the invariant mass) corresponds to the total system energy or, in units where c=1, is identical to it. This invariant mass for a system remains the same quantity in any inertial frame, although the system total energy and total momenta are functions of the particular inertial frame which is chosen, and will vary in such a way between inertial frames as to keep the invariant mass the same for all observers. Invariant mass thus functions for systems of particles in the same capacity as "rest mass" does for single particles.

Note that the invariant mass of an [[isolated system]] (i.e., one closed to both mass and energy) is also independent of observer or inertial frame, and is a constant, conserved quantity for isolated systems and single observers, even during chemical and nuclear reactions. The concept of invariant mass is widely used in [[particle physics]], because the invariant mass of a particle's decay products is equal to its [[rest mass]]. This is used to make measurements of the mass of particles like the [[z particle|Z boson]] or the [[top quark]].

==Conservation versus invariance of mass in special relativity==
{{Refimprove|date=February 2016}}
Total energy is an additive conserved quantity (for single observers) in systems and in reactions between particles, but rest mass (in the sense of being a sum of particle rest masses) may not be conserved through an event in which rest masses of particles are converted to other types of energy, such as kinetic energy. Finding the sum of individual particle rest masses would require multiple observers, one for each particle rest inertial frame, and these observers ignore individual particle kinetic energy. Conservation laws require a single observer and a single inertial frame.

In general, for isolated systems and single observers, relativistic mass is conserved (each observer sees it constant over time), but is not invariant (that is, different observers see different values). Invariant mass, however, is both conserved ''and'' invariant (all single observers see the same value, which does not change over time).

The relativistic mass corresponds to the energy, so [[conservation of energy]] automatically means that relativistic mass is conserved for any given observer and inertial frame. However, this quantity, like the total energy of a particle, is not invariant. This means that, even though it is conserved for any observer during a reaction, its absolute ''value'' will change with the frame of the observer, and for different observers in different frames.

By contrast, the rest mass and invariant masses of systems and particles are ''both'' conserved ''and'' also invariant. For example: A closed container of gas (closed to energy as well) has a system "rest mass" in the sense that it can be weighed on a resting scale, even while it contains moving components. This mass is the invariant mass, which is equal to the total relativistic energy of the container (including the kinetic energy of the gas) only when it is measured in the [[center of momentum frame]]. Just as is the case for single particles, the calculated "rest mass" of such a container of gas does not change when it is in motion, although its "relativistic mass" does change.

The container may even be subjected to a force which gives it an overall velocity, or else (equivalently) it may be viewed from an inertial frame in which it has an overall velocity (that is, technically, a frame in which its [[center of mass]] has a velocity). In this case, its total relativistic mass and energy increase. However, in such a situation, although the container's total relativistic energy and total momenta increase, these energy and momentum increases subtract out in the ''invariant mass'' definition, so that the moving container's invariant mass will be calculated as the same value as if it were measured at rest, on a scale.

===Closed (meaning totally isolated) systems===

All conservation laws in special relativity (for energy, mass, and momentum) require isolated systems, meaning systems that are totally isolated, with no mass-energy allowed in or out, over time. If a system is isolated, then both total energy and total momentum in the system are conserved over time for any observer in any single inertial frame, though their ''absolute values'' will vary, according to different observers in different inertial frames. The invariant mass of the system is also conserved, but does ''not'' change with different observers. This is also the familiar situation with single particles: all observers calculate ''the same'' particle rest mass (a special case of the invariant mass) no matter how they move (what inertial frame they choose), but different observers see different total energies and momenta for the same particle.

Conservation of invariant mass also requires the system to be enclosed so that no heat and radiation (and thus invariant mass) can escape. As in the example above, a physically enclosed or bound system does not need to be completely isolated from external forces for its mass to remain constant, because for bound systems these merely act to change the inertial frame of the system or the observer. Though such actions may change the total energy or momentum of the bound system, these two changes cancel, so that there is no change in the system's invariant mass. This is just the same result as with single particles: their calculated rest mass also remains constant no matter how fast they move, or how fast an observer sees them move.

On the other hand, for systems which are unbound, the "closure" of the system may be enforced by an idealized surface, inasmuch as no mass-energy can be allowed into or out of the test-volume over time, if conservation of system invariant mass is to hold during that time. If a force is allowed to act on (do work on) only one part of such an unbound system, this is equivalent to allowing energy into or out of the system, and the condition of "closure" to mass-energy (total isolation) is violated. In this case, conservation of invariant mass of the system also will no longer hold. Such a loss of rest mass in systems when energy is removed, according to ''E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' where ''E'' is the energy removed, and ''m'' is the change in rest mass, reflect changes of mass associated with movement of energy, not "conversion" of mass to energy.

===The system invariant mass vs. the individual rest masses of parts of the system===

Again, in special relativity, the rest mass of a system is not required to be equal to the sum of the rest masses of the parts (a situation which would be analogous to gross mass-conservation in chemistry). For example, a massive particle can decay into photons which individually have no mass, but which (as a system) preserve the invariant mass of the particle which produced them. Also a box of moving non-interacting particles (e.g., photons, or an ideal gas) will have a larger invariant mass than the sum of the rest masses of the particles which compose it. This is because the total energy of all particles and fields in a system must be summed, and this quantity, as seen in the [[center of momentum frame]], and divided by c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is the system's invariant mass.

In special relativity, mass is not "converted" to energy, for all types of energy still retain their associated mass. Neither energy nor invariant mass can be destroyed in special relativity, and each is separately conserved over time in closed systems. Thus, a system's invariant mass may change ''only'' because invariant mass is allowed to escape, perhaps as light or heat. Thus, when reactions (whether chemical or nuclear) release energy in the form of heat and light, if the heat and light is ''not'' allowed to escape (the system is closed and isolated), the energy will continue to contribute to the system rest mass, and the system mass will not change. Only if the energy is released to the environment will the mass be lost; this is because the associated mass has been allowed out of the system, where it contributes to the mass of the surroundings.&lt;ref name=taylor&gt;

==The relativistic mass concept==

===Transverse and longitudinal mass ===
{{Further information|Electromagnetic mass}}
Concepts that were similar to what nowadays is called "relativistic mass", were already developed before the advent of special relativity. For example, it was recognized by [[J. J. Thomson]] in 1881 that a charged body is harder to set in motion than an uncharged body, which was worked out in more detail by [[Oliver Heaviside]] (1889) and [[George Frederick Charles Searle]] (1897). So the electrostatic energy behaves as having some sort of electromagnetic mass &lt;math&gt;m_{em} =(4/3)E_{em}/c^2&lt;/math&gt;, which can increase the normal mechanical mass of the bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=J. J. Thomson |date=1881 |title=[[s:On the Electric and Magnetic Effects produced by the Motion of Electrified Bodies|On the Electric and Magnetic Effects produced by the Motion of Electrified Bodies]] |journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]  |series=5 |volume=11 |issue=68 |pages=229–249 |doi=10.1080/14786448108627008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  |author=G. F. C. Searle  |date=1897  |title=[[s:On the Steady Motion of an Electrified Ellipsoid|On the Steady Motion of an Electrified Ellipsoid]]  |journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]  |series=5 |volume=44 |issue=269 |pages=329–341 |doi=10.1080/14786449708621072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, it was pointed out by Thomson and Searle that this electromagnetic mass also increases with velocity. This was further elaborated by [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1899, 1904) in the framework of [[Lorentz ether theory]]. He defined mass as the ratio of force to acceleration, not as the ratio of momentum to velocity, so he needed to distinguish between the mass &lt;math&gt;m_L = \gamma^3 m&lt;/math&gt; parallel to the direction of motion and the mass &lt;math&gt;m_T = \gamma m&lt;/math&gt; perpendicular to the direction of motion (where &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lorentz factor]], ''v'' is the relative velocity between the aether and the object, and ''c'' is the speed of light). Only when the force is perpendicular to the velocity, Lorentz's mass is equal to what is now called "relativistic mass". [[Max Abraham]] (1902) called &lt;math&gt;m_L&lt;/math&gt; ''longitudinal mass'' and &lt;math&gt;m_T&lt;/math&gt; ''[[transverse mass]]'' (although Abraham used more complicated expressions than Lorentz's relativistic ones). So, according to Lorentz's theory no body can reach the speed of light because the mass becomes infinitely large at this velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  |author=H. A. Lorentz  |date=1899  |title=[[s:Simplified Theory of Electrical and Optical Phenomena in Moving Systems|Simplified Theory of Electrical and Optical Phenomena in Moving Systems]]  |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]]  |volume=1 |pages=427–442 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also [[Albert Einstein]] initially used the concepts of longitudinal and transverse mass in his 1905 electrodynamics paper (equivalent to those of Lorentz, but with a different &lt;math&gt;m_T&lt;/math&gt; by an unfortunate force definition, which was later corrected), and in another paper in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  |author=A.

The precise relativistic expression (which is equivalent to Lorentz's) relating force and acceleration for a particle with non-zero rest mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; moving in the ''x'' direction with velocity ''v'' and associated Lorentz factor &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  f_x &amp;= m \gamma^3 a_x &amp;= m_L a_x, \\
  f_y &amp;= m \gamma a_y &amp;= m_T a_y, \\
  f_z &amp;= m \gamma a_z &amp;= m_T a_z.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Relativistic mass===
In special relativity, an object that has nonzero rest mass cannot travel at the speed of light. As the object approaches the speed of light, the object's energy and momentum increase without bound.

In the first years after 1905, following Lorentz and Einstein, the terms longitudinal and transverse mass were still in use. However, those expressions were replaced by the concept of ''relativistic mass'', an expression which was first defined by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Richard C. Tolman]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Lewis, Gilbert N.  |author2=Tolman, Richard C. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1909|title=[[s:The Principle of Relativity, and Non-Newtonian Mechanics|The Principle of Relativity, and Non-Newtonian Mechanics]]|journal=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|volume=44|pages=709–726|doi=10.2307/20022495|issue=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They defined the total energy and mass of a body as
:&lt;math&gt;m_\text{rel} = \frac{E}{c^2}\!&lt;/math&gt;,

and of a body at rest
:&lt;math&gt;m_0 = \frac{E_0}{c^2}\!&lt;/math&gt;,

with the ratio
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{m_\text{rel}}{m_0} = \gamma\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Tolman in 1912 further elaborated on this concept, and stated: “the expression m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(1 - v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1/2&lt;/sup&gt; is best suited for THE mass of a moving body.”&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{citation |author=R. Tolman |date=1911 |title=[[s:Derivation of Fifth Fundamental Equation|Note on the Derivation from the Principle of Relativity of the Fifth Fundamental Equation of the Maxwell-Lorentz Theory]]|journal=Philosophical Magazine |volume=21|issue=123 | pages=296–301 |doi=10.1080/14786440308637034}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=R.

In 1934, Tolman argued that the relativistic mass formula &lt;math&gt;m_\text{rel} = E / c^2 \!&lt;/math&gt; holds for all particles, including those moving at the speed of light, while the formula &lt;math&gt;m_\text{rel} = \gamma m_0 \!&lt;/math&gt; only applies to a slower-than-light particle (a particle with a nonzero rest mass). Tolman remarked on this relation that "We have, moreover, of course the experimental verification of the expression in the case of moving electrons to which we shall call attention in §29. We shall hence have no hesitation in accepting the expression as correct in general for the mass of a moving particle."&lt;ref name="RT34"&gt;

When the relative velocity is zero, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is simply equal to 1, and the relativistic mass is reduced to the rest mass as one can see in the next two equations below. As the velocity increases toward the speed of light ''c'', the denominator of the right side approaches zero, and consequently &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; approaches infinity.

In the formula for momentum

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = m_\text{rel}\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

the mass that occurs is the relativistic mass. In other words, the relativistic mass is the proportionality constant between the velocity and the momentum.

While [[Newton's second law]] remains valid in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \frac{d(m_\text{rel}\mathbf{v})}{dt}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

the derived form &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = m_\text{rel}\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; is not valid because &lt;math&gt;m_\text{rel}\,&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;{d(m_\text{rel}\mathbf{v})}\!&lt;/math&gt; is generally not a constant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/mass.html |title=What is relativistic mass? |author1=Philip Gibbs |author2=Jim Carr |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see the section above on transverse and longitudinal mass).

Even though Einstein initially used the expressions "longitudinal" and "transverse" mass in two papers (see [[#Transverse and longitudinal mass|previous section]]), in his first paper on &lt;math&gt;E = mc^2&lt;/math&gt; (1905) he treated ''m'' as what would now be called the ''rest mass''.&lt;ref name=inertia&gt;{{Citation  |author=A.

Einstein never derived an equation for "relativistic mass", and in later years he expressed his dislike of the idea:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eugene Hecht |date=19 August 2009 |title=Einstein Never Approved of Relativistic Mass |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.3204111 |journal=Phys.

Instead of introducing ''M'' it is better to mention the expression for the momentum and energy of a body in motion. |Albert Einstein in letter to [[Lincoln Barnett]], 19 June 1948 (quote from [[Lev Okun|L.B.

===Controversy===

Okun and followers reject the concept of relativistic mass.&lt;ref name=okun /&gt; Also Arnold B. Arons has argued against teaching the concept of relativistic mass:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For many years it was conventional to enter the discussion of dynamics through derivation of the relativistic mass, that is the mass–velocity relation, and this is probably still the dominant mode in textbooks.  More recently, however, it has been increasingly recognized that relativistic mass is a troublesome and dubious concept.  [See, for example, [https://www.worldscientific.com/phy_etextbook/6833/6833_02.pdf Okun (1989)].]... The sound and rigorous approach to relativistic dynamics is through direct development of that expression for ''momentum'' that ensures conservation of momentum in all frames:
:&lt;math&gt;p = {m_0 v \over {\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;
rather than through relativistic mass. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

C. Alder takes a similarly dismissive stance on mass in relativity. Writing on said subject matter, he says that ''"its introduction into the theory of special relativity was much in the way of a historical accident"'', noting towards the widespread knowledge of ''E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' and how the public's interpretation of the equation has largely informed how it is taught in higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Carl|date=September 30, 1986|title=Does mass really depend on velocity, dad?|url=https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~phys191r/References/b5/Adler1987.pdf|journal=American Journal of Physics|publisher=American Association of Physics Teachers|volume=55|issue=8|pages=739–743|via=HUIT Sites Hosting|doi=10.1119/1.15314|bibcode=1987AmJPh..55..739A}}&lt;/ref&gt; He instead supposes that the difference between rest and relativistic mass should be explicitly taught, so that students know why mass should be thought of as invariant ''"in most discussions of inertia."'' 

Many contemporary authors such as Taylor and Wheeler avoid using the concept of relativistic mass altogether:
:"''The concept of "relativistic mass" is subject to misunderstanding. That's why we don't use it. First, it applies the name mass – belonging to the magnitude of a 4-vector – to a very different concept, the time component of a 4-vector. Second, it makes increase of energy of an object with velocity or momentum appear to be connected with some change in internal structure of the object. In reality, the increase of energy with velocity originates not in the object but in the geometric properties of spacetime itself.''"&lt;ref name=taylor /&gt;

While space-time has the unbounded geometry of Minkowski-space, the velocity-space is bounded by ''c'' and has the geometry of [[Beltrami–Klein model|hyperbolic geometry]] where relativistic-mass plays an analogous role to that of Newtonian-mass in the barycentric-coordinates of [[Euclidean geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jeMu4s-tUBIC Hyperbolic Triangle Centers: The Special Relativistic Approach], Abraham A. Ungar, Springer, 2010, {{ISBN|978-90-481-8636-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection of velocity to hyperbolic-geometry enables the 3-velocity-dependent relativistic-mass to be related to the 4-velocity Minkowski-formalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=euclid.cma/1305810734 When Relativistic Mass Meets Hyperbolic Geometry], Abraham A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2735">The '''Mousterian Pluvial''' was a prehistoric wet and rainy (pluvial) period in [[North Africa]]. It occurred during the [[Upper Paleolithic]], toward the latter part of the [[Mousterian]] era. That is, it began around 50,000 years ago, lasted roughly 20,000 years, and ended about 30,000 years ago.

During the [[Mousterian]] [[Pluvial]], the now-desiccated regions of northern Africa were well-watered, bearing lakes, swamps, and river systems that no longer exist. What is now the [[Sahara desert]] supported typical African wildlife of grassland and woodland environments: herbivores from [[gazelle]] to [[giraffe]] to [[ostrich]], predators from [[lion]] to [[jackal]], even [[hippopotamus]] and [[crocodile]], as well as extinct forms like the [[Camelops|Pleistocene camel]]. In these respects the Mousterian Pluvial resembled the earlier [[Abbassia Pluvial]]; the later [[Neolithic Subpluvial]] was a weaker re-iteration of the same pattern.

The Mousterian Pluvial was caused by large-scale [[climatology|climatic]] changes during the last [[ice age]]. By 50,000 years ago, the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] ("Würm glaciation" in Europe) was well-advanced; growing [[ice sheet]]s in North America and Europe displaced the standard climatic zones of the northern hemisphere southward. The temperate zones of Europe and North America acquired an Arctic or [[tundra]] climate, and the rain bands typical of the temperate zones dropped to the latitudes of northern Africa.

Curiously, the same influences that created the Mousterian Pluvial also appear to have brought it to a close. In the period of its fullest development, c. 30,000 to 18,000 years ago, the [[Laurentide ice sheet]] covered an enormous geographic area and even increased its altitude to 1750 m (more than 1 mile). It generated its own long term weather patterns, which affected the [[jet stream]] passing over the North American continent. The jet stream effectively split in two, creating a new dominant weather pattern over the northern hemisphere that brought harsher conditions to several regions (including parts of [[Central Asia]] and the [[Middle East]]), changes that included an end to the Mousterian Pluvial and a return to a more arid climate in northern Africa.

There is only one nuclear reactor in Ghana, the [[Ghana_Research_Reactor-1|Ghana Research Reactor]], located in [[Accra]].
== Purpose ==
The [[Ghana Atomic Energy Commission]] has been investigating the use of nuclear power and is a member of the [[International Nuclear Library Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Participating libraries|url=http://inln.iaea.org/libraries.htm|publisher=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]]|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission is working with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] to implement nuclear power in Ghana as part of a wider project, [[Sustainable Energy Development for Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ghana to adopt nuclear power?|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/27450/1/ghana-to-adopt-nuclear-power.html|newspaper=Graphic|date=1 November 2002|author=Joe Okyere|author2=Salome Donkor|agency=Modern Ghana}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghana also has a Graduate School of Nuclear and Allied Sciences which trains undergraduate and postgraduate students in the techniques of nuclear science application in such areas as agriculture, medicine, and research.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Clark, Nancy L.

''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these organizations focus more on research and the one research reactor located in Ghana than on nuclear power.

The [[government of Ghana]] planned to commission the building of a nuclear power plant by 2018. President [[John Agyekum Kufuor]] supported the future building of nuclear power plants, seeing it as part of a solution to the country's energy problems. He initiated a Nuclear Power Committee to study the issue. In 2011, the director of the National Nuclear Research Institute, Benjamin Nyarko, also said he believed nuclear power could prevent future [[energy crisis|energy crises]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3926">The '''ozone depletion potential''' ('''ODP''') of a [[chemical compound]] is the relative amount of degradation to the [[ozone layer]] it can cause, with [[trichlorofluoromethane]] (R-11 or CFC-11) being fixed at an ODP of 1.0.  [[Chlorodifluoromethane]] (R-22), for example, has an ODP of 0.05. CFC 11, or R-11 has the maximum potential amongst chlorocarbons because of the presence of three chlorine atoms in the molecule.

The first proposal of ODP came from Wuebbles in 1983. It was defined as a measure of destructive effects of a substance compared to a reference substance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciesin.org/TG/OZ/odp.html Ozone-Depletion and Chlorine-Loading Potential of Chlorofluorocarbon Alternatives]&lt;/ref&gt;

Precisely, ODP of a given substance is defined as the ratio of global loss of ozone due to the given substance to the global loss of ozone due to CFC-11 of the same mass.

ODP can be estimated from the molecular structure of a given substance. [[Chlorofluorocarbons]] have ODPs roughly equal to 1. Brominated substances have usually higher ODPs in range 5–15, because of more aggressive bromine reaction with ozone. [[Hydrochlorofluorocarbons]] have ODPs mostly in range 0.005 - 0.2 due to the presence of the hydrogen which causes them to react readily in the [[troposphere]], therefore reducing their chance to reach the [[stratosphere]] where the ozone layer is present. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) have no chlorine content, so their ODP is essentially zero.

ODP is often used in conjunction with a compound's [[global warming potential]] (GWP) as a measure of how environmentally detrimental it can be. GWP represents the potential of a substance to contribute to [[global warming]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In a broad sense, haloalkanes that contain no hydrogen are stable in the troposphere and decompose only in the stratosphere. Those compounds that contain hydrogen also react with OH radicals and can therefore be decomposed in the troposphere, as well.  The ozone depletion potential increases with the heavier halogens since the C-''X'' bond strength is lower. Note the trend of the CClF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-X series in the table below.

'''ParkinsonSAT''', '''PSat''' or '''Naval Academy OSCAR 84''', is a [[U.S.]] [[technology demonstration]] [[satellite]] and an [[amateur radio satellite]] for Packet Radio. It was built at the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] and was planned as a double satellite (ParkinsonSAT A and B). The name ParkinsonSAT was chosen in honor of [[Bradford Parkinson]], the father of the [[GPS|GPS system]]. After successful launch, the satellite was assigned the '''OSCAR number 84'''.

==Mission==
The satellite was launched on May 20, 2015, with an [[Atlas V]] rocket along with the main payload X-37B OTV-4 and 9 other CubeSat satellites ([[X-37B OTV-4]], [[GEARRS 2]], [[LightSail A]], [[OptiCube 1]], [[OptiCube 2]], [[OptiCube 3]], [[USS Langley]], [[AeroCube 8A]], [[AeroCube 8B]] and [[BRICSat-P]]) from [[Cape Canaveral AFS]], [[Florida]].

ParkinsonSAT is a student satellite project. It was partly funded by the [[Aerospace Corporation]]. It has a [[transponder]] for transmitting [[telemetry]] from remote measuring points (eg drifting buoys). This telemetry is to be transmitted to a network of ground stations. A second transponder enables multi-user text transmission in PSK31 mode. This transponder was built by the [[Brno University of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urel.feec.vutbr.cz/esl/files/Projects/PSAT/P%20sat%20transponder%20WEB%20spec02.htm|title= P-sat Transponder WEB Specification|publisher=Brno University of Technology|accessdate=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the project consisted of 2 identical satellites: '''PSat-A''' and '''PSat-B''', 2 identical '''1.5U Cubesats''', which should be brought together in a 3U starter into space. During the long wait for a launch opportunity in 2014, the construction of the satellite was changed again. The [[solar cell]]s have been replaced by new, more efficient cells. The other originally named PSat-B CubeSat was rebuilt and started as BRICSat-P.

==Frequencies==

* 145.825 MHz APRS Uplink and Downlink (1200 [[Band (radio)|Band]] AX.25)

About [http://www.tamu.edu/upress/BOOKS/2000/heldrich.htm ''Good Friday''], author Jonathan Holden remarked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In his magnificent poem 'Momentum,' as throughout ''Good Friday'', the poet Philip Heldrich, like the late W. C. Williams, demonstrates audaciously how, while 'pulled and tugged in the swirl of rush hour traffic,' we can, out of the American quotidian, locate and frame that which is beautiful."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Final Judge X.J. Kennedy added:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Philip Heldrich writes shapely poems that go places and share some wisdom with us. . . . He can capture a good deal of territory in a limited number of well-crafted words."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About his award-winning collection of essays, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071116145721/http://www.midlist.org/showbook.cfm?booknum=61X ''Out Here in the Out There: Essays in a Region of Superlatives''], the American Library Associations's [http://www.ala.org/ala/booklist/booklist.htm ''Booklist'']  noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Poet and pop culture aficionado Heldrich searches for the lyrical within his small midwestern meatpacking town and beyond. For Heldrich, lover of words, there is beauty to be found at the local dump: magazines (Kansas Farmer), discarded beverage bottles (“Golden Sound Basil Seed Drink”), even machine names (the “cram-a-lot” baler is a favorite). The resulting essays are a happy melding of social commentary with the best sort of travel writing. A finely crafted ode to target practice and male bonding set in a high country meadow in Colorado quietly evolves into a memorial for a lost friend. Another piece perfectly captures the surreal nature of the academic conference, made even more dreamlike by taking place in Norman, Oklahoma, five hours before a championship football game. (Heldrich succumbs to Husker and Sooner mania.) Driving around “out there,” whether it be Disneyland or the Central Plains, the author puts pen to paper, accurately capturing the essence of American culture."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Philip Heldrich served as Executive Director of the [http://swtxpca.org Southwest/Texas Popular and American Culture Associations].  He was an Associate Professor in the Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Sciences Program at the [http://www.tacoma.washington.edu/ ''[[University of Washington Tacoma]]''].

==Cancer and death==

Heldrich was diagnosed with cancer in early 2009. He underwent chemotherapy treatment and continued to teach courses in writing fiction, creative nonfiction and poetry. He died on November 11, 2010, due to complications from his illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Obituary |publisher =UW Tacoma |date=November 15, 2010|url=http://www.tacoma.uw.edu/news/remembering-ias-faculty-member-philip-heldrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4038">A '''primary mineral''' is any mineral formed during the original crystallization of the host igneous [[Primary Rock|primary rock]] and includes the essential mineral(s) used to classify the rock along with any accessory minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Ailsa Allaby and Michael Allaby. "primary mineral." A Dictionary of Earth Sciences. 1999. Encyclopedia.com. 1 Oct. 2016. &lt;http://www.encyclopedia.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ore]] deposit [[geology]], [[hypogene]] processes occur deep below the earth's surface, and tend to form deposits of primary minerals, as opposed to [[supergene]] processes that occur at or near the surface, and tend to form secondary minerals.&lt;ref name="Rakovan2003"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00357529.2003.9926759 | title=A Word to the Wise: Hypogene &amp; Supergene | author=Rakovan, John | journal=Rocks &amp; Minerals | year=2003 | volume=78 | issue=6 | page=419 | doi=10.1080/00357529.2003.9926759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elemental and mineralogical composition of primary rocks is determined by the chemical composition of the [[Volcano|volcanic]] or [[magma]]tic flow from which it is formed. Extrusive rocks (such as [[basalt]], [[rhyolite]], [[andesite]] and [[obsidian]]) and intrusive rocks (such as [[granite]], [[granodiorite]], [[gabbro]] and [[peridotite]]) contain primary minerals including [[quartz]], [[feldspar]], [[plagioclase]], [[muscovite]], [[biotite]], [[amphibole]], [[pyroxene]] and [[olivine]] in varying concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;Dept. of Land, Air and Water Resources. University of California Davis. http://lawr.ucdavis.edu/classes/Ssc219/biogeo/prim.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

For the classical discussions of the origin of primary ores, see the two publications "Ore Deposits" (1903 and 1913).&lt;ref&gt;Rickard, T.F.; Ore Deposits: Engineering and Mining Journal, 1903; and Emmons, S.F.; Ore Deposits: A. I. M. E., 1913: pp. 837-846.&lt;/ref&gt; According to W.A. Tarr (1938) the primary mineral deposits are the result of direct magmatic action; he states that the splitting of magmas results in the basic igneous rocks and their accompanying group of accessory minerals formed by the first crystallization in the magma, on the one hand, and in the acidic igneous rocks and a second group of accessory minerals which were formed by deposition from the residual [[mother liquor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tarr, W.A.; 1938: Introductory Economic Geology; McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern soil science offers the following definition: "Primary Minerals: The thickness of the earth's crust varies from 10 km under the ocean to 30 km under the continents. Of the 88 naturally occurring elements on earth, only 8 make [up] most of the crust. The earth's crust and soils are dominated by the silicic acid in combination with Na, Al, K, Ca, Fe and O ions. ...Those elements are components of primary minerals, whereas primary minerals are components of parent rocks. There are almost 3000 known minerals, but only 20 are common and just 10 minerals make up 90 % of the earth's crust. Primary minerals are defined as minerals found in soil but not formed in soil. This definition is different from that of secondary minerals, which are defined as minerals formed in soils."&lt;ref&gt;Grunald, S.; "Primary Mineral Components of Soils"; https://soils.ifas.ufl.edu/faculty/grunwald/teaching/eSoilScience/primary.shtml#parent&lt;/ref&gt; This is further defined by Dr. Broome of North Carolina State:&lt;ref&gt;http://broome.soil.ncsu.edu/ssc012/Lecture/topic4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Two types of minerals are found in natural systems: primary and secondary. 
*Whether the mineral is primary or secondary depends on the mode of formation and not on the mineral composition.
*minerals that crystallize from cooling magma are called primary.
*minerals that crystallize during the weathering of primary minerals are called secondary minerals.

Primary rocks are the source of primary minerals and [[primary water]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7712">Several hundred metals, compounds, alloys and ceramics possess the property of [[superconductivity]] at low temperatures. The [[SU(2)]] [[Quark color|color quark]] matter adjoins the list of superconducting systems. Although it is a mathematical abstraction, its properties are believed to be closely related to the [[SU(3)]] 
[[quark matter|color quark matter]], which exists in nature when ordinary matter is compressed at supranuclear densities above ~ 0.5 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; nucleon/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup &gt;.

==Superconductors in Lab==

Superconducting materials are characterized by the loss of resistance and two parameters: a critical temperature T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and a critical magnetic field which brings the 
superconductor to its normal state.  In 1911, [[H. Kamerlingh Onnes]] discovered the superconductivity of mercury at a temperature below 4 K. Later, 
other substances with superconductivity at temperatures up to 30 K were found. Superconductors prevent the penetration of the external magnetic field 
into the sample when the magnetic field strength is less than the critical value. This effect was called the [[Meissner–Ochsenfeld effect|Meissner effect]].
[[High-temperature superconductivity]] was discovered in the 1980s. Of the known compounds, the highest critical temperature T&lt;sub&gt;с&lt;/sub&gt; = 135 K belongs to 
HgBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8+x&lt;/sub&gt;.

Low-temperature superconductivity has found a theoretical explanation in the model of Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer ([[BCS theory]]).

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The physical basis of the model is the phenomenon of [[Cooper pairing]] of electrons. Since a pair of electrons carries an integer spin, the correlated states of the electrons can form a Bose-Einstein condensate.
An equivalent formalism was developed by [[Nikolay Bogolyubov|Bogoliubov]]

Cooper pairing of nucleons takes place in ordinary nuclei. The effect manifests itself in the [[Semi-empirical mass formula|Bethe–Weizsacker mass formula]], the last pairing term 
of which describes the correlation energy of two nucleons. Because of the pairing, the binding energy of even-even nuclei systematically exceeds the binding energy of odd-even and 
odd-odd nuclei.

==Superfluidity in neutron stars==

The superfluid phase of neutron matter exists in neutron stars. 
The superfluidity is described by the BCS model with a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction potential.
By increasing the density of nuclear matter above the saturation density, quark matter is formed. It is expected that dense quark matter at low 
temperatures is a color superconductor.

==Superconductivity with dense two-color QCD==

The BCS formalism is applicable without modifications to the description of quark matter with color group SU(2), where Cooper pairs are colorless. The [[Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model]] 
predicts the existence of the superconducting phase of SU(2) color quark matter at high densities

in which the properties of cold quark matter can be described based on the first principles of [[quantum chromodynamics]]. 
The possibility of modeling on the lattices of two-color QCD at finite chemical potentials for even numbers of the quark flavors is associated with the positive-definiteness 
of the integral measure and the absence of a [[sign problem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="910">The '''Shkarofsky function''' is a [[physics]] formula which describes the behavior of [[microwave]]s.

'''Strongly symmetric matter''': If the predictions of [[supersymmetry]] and, more so, [[string theory]] are correct, then during the time of the [[Planck Epoch]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the [[Big Bang]]) all four fundamental forces were of equal strength and united into a single fundamental force. However, shortly thereafter, during the [[grand unification epoch]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang) gravity began to separate from the other three forces of electromagnetism, the strong, and weak nuclear force. After gravity had separated, the strong nuclear force was quick to follow and separated itself from the [[electroweak force]], ending the epoch. The phrase 'strongly symmetric matter' refers to the united forces present during the Planck Epoch.

The process is simply feeding a bundle of continuous filament yarns into a small jet nozzle with various amounts of slack (overfeed). High pressure air ( &gt; 100 PSI ) creates a suction and a turbulent airstream which tangles any slack into a yarn with a similar hand as a [[spinning (textiles)|spun]] yarn. It is the turbulent airflow that tangles the fibers. This method of yarn productions creates a yarn that is normally more even than a spun yarn and does not [[Pill (textile)|pill]] like a spun yarn.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

'''Turboswing''' is a type of grease filter used in [[kitchen ventilation]] to remove grease particles from the air. It is typically installed inside the [[extractor hood]]s of restaurant kitchens. Its operation is based on a rotating filtering medium.&lt;ref name="vent2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inrs-ventilation2012.fr/uploads/documents/TaipaleA..pdf|title=Ventilation 2012|work=Inrs-ventilation2012.fr|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vtt.fi/files/reviews/2010/mav/rotating_kitchen_filter.htm|title=VTT Review 2010|work=Vtt.fi|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==

]]

The main difference between turboswing and most common filters is that in turboswing filters the filtering medium is not static. There is a perforated disk rotating at high speed.&lt;ref name="vent2012"/&gt; When the grease particles go through the rotating disk they are separated from the air.

After separation, [[centrifugal force]] due to the rotating disk throws particles against the inner walls of the filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arven.es/arven_new/catalogo/campanas-extractoras/sistema-filtracion-turboswing|title=Arven, Fabricantes de Campanas extractoras, Unidades de Ventilación, Filtros electroestáticos. - Sistema de filtración TurboSwing|author=|work=Arven.es|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particles then drip down the walls of the chamber onto the lower collection basin, where they stay until they are removed through the tap at the bottom of the filter dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digipaper.fi/vtt_impulse/56725/index.php?pgnumb=52|title=VTT Impulse 2/2010 - Sivu 48|work=Digipaper.fi|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smaller particles==
Turboswing filters can remove grease particles starting from 4μm, as opposed to 8μm for common filters. This is because the filtering medium is moving, and this increases the probability of collision between the filter and the particle.&lt;ref name="vent2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="absfrench"&gt;[http://www.inrs-ventilation2012.fr/uploads/documents/Recueil%20des%20r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9s%20-%20Abstracts.pdf] {{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindab.com/lv/pro/about-lindab/news/Pages/Jeven-prezent%C4%93-jauno-TurboSwing-tauku-separatoru.aspx |title=Par Jeven prezentē jauno TurboSwing tauku separatoru |publisher=Lindab.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/49319/Natalia%20Shevchenko.pdf?sequence=1 |format=PDF |author=Natalia Shevchenko |title=Problems of Grease and Its Solutions in Commercial Kitchens |publisher=Publications.theseus.fi |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varying airflow==
Turboswing filters can work with varying [[airflow]]s. The grease extraction level is not affected by the airflow. This means that this kind of filter can be used in restaurants that turn down the air volumes at non-peak times in order to [[Energy conservation|save energy]].

The explanation is that if the airflow is lower, the particles go through the rotating disk at a slower speed, therefore increasing, the collision probability. Other filters like cyclonic filters require the airflow to be high on a permanent basis, or else the performance of the filter drops. Therefore, the use of filters like turboswing make it possible to save vast amounts of energy in restaurant kitchen ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hightech.fi/direct.aspx?area=htf&amp;prm1=953&amp;prm2=article|title=High Technology Finland - Energy &amp; The Environment|work=Hightech.fi|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venti.dk/page178.aspx?recordid178=222|title=Produkter TS|work=Venti.dk|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat recovery==
Turboswing grease filters make it possible to do heat recovery with the air of a kitchen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmsnewsletters.co.uk/newshost/cyclone/index.php?issue=13|title=Modular Canopies Available To All|work=Bmsnewsletters.co.uk|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike common filters, turboswing filters extract the small particles responsible for making the heat exchanger dirty.&lt;ref name="absfrench"/&gt;

Heat recovery makes it possible to save energy in the ventilation of a building. In particular, kitchen air is hotter than the air in most other rooms, and therefore a large amount of energy can potentially be saved. However, when it comes to the ventilation of a kitchen, if the correct kind of filter is not used, heat recovery can be very difficult or even impossible, because of the presence of grease particles in the air. Grease particles accumulate at the heat exchanger, rendering it useless very quickly.&lt;ref name="popravko"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/38854/Popravko%20Veronika.pdf?sequence=1 |format=PDF |author=Popravko Veronika |title=Heat Recovery Potential of a Canteen |publisher=Publications.theseus.fi |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to have heat recovery in a kitchen, the air must be completely clear of grease, in other words, both large and small grease particles must be removed from the air. Static filters cannot adequately deal with small particles, therefore making it impossible to recover heat. Turboswing filters exhibit high performance in dealing with small particles, and this is why they enable heat recovery to be done with kitchen air.&lt;ref name="vent2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="popravko"/&gt;
