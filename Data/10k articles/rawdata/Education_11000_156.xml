'''4T Center - Vietnam Youth Education Support Center''' is a [[social organization]] in [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]], based on [[non-profit]] operation with the mission of education support and comprehensive development for Vietnamese [[Youth]]. Its abbreviation name is '''4T Center''' which comes from these four words in Vietnamese: "'''T'''am" (Heart), "'''T'''ri" (Mind), "'''T'''ai" (Talent) and "'''T'''ay" (Hand), representing important qualities of a young person.

==History==
4T Center initiated as a group of volunteers gathering students from different universities in Hannoi. The idea of establishing a Center for Vietnamese youth also came from a young Vietnamese, Mr. Nguyen Tung Lam, Deputy Director of 4T Center. After two years of operating as a [[social entrepreneur]], 4T Center was officially founded on 23 September 2011 as a social organization under its [[Parent Organization]] "Vietnam Association for Promoting Education".&lt;ref&gt;''Giới thiệu chung - Trung tâm 4T'', [http://www.4t.org.vn/ Trang chủ]&lt;/ref&gt; Since its establishment, 4T has established connection with other [[organizations]] in Vietnam and the World. At the end of 2011, 4T became the first partner organization of [[4-H]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4-h.org/ 4-H official website]&lt;/ref&gt; and took part in the 2nd International 4-H Youth Winter Camp in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.korea4-h.or.kr/4-H_in_Korea/4-H_YouthWinterCamp/Overview.aspx/ |title=''4-H Youth Winter Camp'', Executive Leaders Conference |access-date=2012-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622033526/http://english.korea4-h.or.kr/4-H_in_Korea/4-H_YouthWinterCamp/Overview.aspx |archive-date=2013-06-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current programs==
'''&lt;big&gt;Kid-camp&lt;/big&gt;''' holds [[non- formal education]] activities for kids from 8-18 providing chance of learning by doing through playing activities to learn and exchange essential skills and other moral values. The fund is from parents’ participation fee. The program is coordinated by 4T Center with the participation of volunteers in 4Tclubs. Kid-camps include weekend camps and summer camps in variety of topic such as Sport Camp, International Camp, Skill Camp, Career Training Camp and Countryside Camp.&lt;ref&gt;''4T Volunteer'', [http://www.tienphong.vn/Gioi-Tre/536392/Tinh-nguyen-4T.html/ Tien Phong Online newspaper] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226182350/http://www.tienphong.vn/Gioi-Tre/536392/Tinh-nguyen-4T.html |date=2012-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Youth clubs&lt;/big&gt;''' is an operating model for youth to join voluntarily, lead the clubs, expand their members and launch [[community]] service to practice [[democracy]] and exchange essential skills like teamwork or leadership. Clubs operate based on membership fee and other self-raising fund activities. Youth expand their members and launch [[community service]] programs involving in training, environmental conservation, camping, events or other [[extracurricular]] activities for kids.

'''&lt;big&gt;Youth projects&lt;/big&gt;''' focus on emerging problems of youth and get direct involvement of youth in solving these problems. Forms of training, workshops and non-formal educational activities are launched to provide necessary knowledge and skills for youth to actively participate in the projects. 4T staffs are key project officers to coordinate clubs’ network to implement project. Expense is from business sponsors, local or [[international funds]] and other self-funding activities.

'''&lt;big&gt;Youth events&lt;/big&gt;''' are prominent events towards youth to attract concern of the society on youth development such as [[festival]], [[workshop]], camps in variety of topics. In 2011, an event was held by 4T Center called "Hello Summer Camp". This event attracts concerns of journalists and participation of numerous parents and children.&lt;ref&gt;"Sôi động ngày hội Hello Summer Camp", [http://www.tgvn.com.vn/printContent.aspx?ID=11831/''The World and Vietnam Report Newspaper'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Responsible parents network&lt;/big&gt;''' sets up a parental network to enhance their responsibilities and concerns about their children’s [[extracurricular activities]], encouraging their support in activities’ organizing and sponsor for comprehensive development of their children.

==Projects==

===Website ''truonghocvungcao.vn''===
The project, aiming at providing a better education for children in [[mountainous]] areas, has set up a website named [https://web.archive.org/web/20120415142000/http://truonghocvungcao.vn/ truonghocvungcao] or ''"mountainous schools"''.  Arose from the reality that educational development in these areas has to cope with a lot of difficulties such as high dropout rate of school students, lack of teaching materials and studying equipment as well as poor education infrastructure, 4T Center proposed a project on supporting Education in remote Areas. A website has been established to provide information about educational condition of schools in these areas of Hoa Binh and Son La province. The information needed for the website has been collected and compiled by groups of volunteers from 4T’s youth network. The website is an information channel to update news about obstacles in educational conditions of mountainous students as well as raise funds and supports from sponsors, parents, businesses and the whole community for a better future of poor students.

===Empowering Youth Integrity===
The project is the cooperation among 4T Center, Towards Transparency Organization and [[Transparency International]] to strengthen Youth capacity in fighting [[corruption]]. 4T Center and its partner organization realized that it is important to promote [[integrity]] as a core personal value among youth. Integrity education program will be introduced to students in selected secondary schools in Hanoi through extra-curriculum lessons. Youth in 4T clubs network will be the [[facilitator]]s of integrity lessons for their junior fellows. As integrity peer trainers, the youth are expected to be good examples of integrity for their peers and younger fellows to follow. Apart from non-formal integrity educational program in schools, youth will be provided chances to expand their understanding about anti-corruption through a competition called "Flat Connection"&lt;ref&gt;Information of Flat Connection, [http://www.facebook.com/ketnoiphang2012/ ''Flat connection Facebook address]&lt;/ref&gt; and an integrity festival. The project started from October 2011 and will end in June 2012.

'''Academic Competition for Excellence''' (often shortened to '''ACE''') is a format of [[high school]] [[quizbowl]] played in the [[Mid-Atlantic States|mid-Atlantic]], especially in the Commonwealth of [[Virginia]]. There are several leagues in West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina, although many of the Virginia leagues have become feeders for [[Virginia High School League]] Scholastic Bowl competition, or play the VHSL format instead of the ACE format. (The Scholastic Bowl format allows districts to keep playing their old formats during the regular season.)  ACE teams also exist throughout Arkansas, though the game follows a slightly different format.

Most quizbowl formats feature teams of three to five players from each school, competing on questions that span the realm on human knowledge. There are rarely pre-assigned reading lists, or limitations on subject matter. Informal limits, based on what students might reasonably be taught, or have learned in outside reading, do exist, and some competitions will restrict the amount of [[popular culture]] in each match. 

The ACE format requires each school to field five teams of four players each. The five teams compete in four subject areas -- [[Mathematics]], [[Science]], [[Social Studies]], and [[English studies|English]] -- and a fifth team plays in an All-Around competition. No student can play on two subject-area teams, although he/she can play on a subject-area team and the All-Around team. The wide variety of students (a school needs at least 16 players to compete) that can play in the ACE format makes it popular with administrators. An ACE competition usually has two schools, and consists of the five teams from each school competing one at a time. 

The subject-area competitions usually have questions from subject areas that are determined before the season begins. For Math, Science, and Social Studies this is usually fairly open-ended: 
* Math questions are usually written in the areas of [[algebra]], [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], and sometimes [[calculus]].
* Science questions are usually written in the areas of [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[earth science]], and sometimes [[computer science]].
* Social Studies questions are usually written in the areas of [[US history]], [[World history]], [[Geography]], and [[civics]].

English questions are usually written from a pre-assigned reading list. The list usually consists of a number of novels, short stories, plays, and poems, and questions are about details from those works. 

All-Around questions are from the four subject areas (again, using the reading list for English questions.) Usually, [[fine arts]], [[philosophy]], [[religion]], and [[current events]] questions are included in the All-Around competition, but [[popular culture]] and [[sports]] are specifically excluded. (This appeals to some administrators.)

== History of ACE ==
ACE leagues began appearing in Virginia during the early and mid-1980s. The format proved popular and was widely copied by administrators across Virginia. Some leagues mirrored VHSL districts, but some leagues were more geographic in scope. During the late 1990s, some of the Virginia leagues switched to the VHSL format, and others changed their competition dates to the fall and began sending their champions to VHSL regional competition. Most of Western Virginia still refers to their Scholastic Bowl team as their "ACE team."

== ACE leagues ==
* [[Academic Competition (WSFCS)]] -- [[Forsyth County, North Carolina|Forsyth County]], NC
* Eastern Panhandle, WV
* James River ACE—area south of Charlottesville and west of Richmond, corresponds with the VHSL James River District
* Jefferson ACE—Charlottesville area, VA (disbanded, replaced by VHSL Jefferson District competition)
* [[Mountain Academic Competition Conference]] -- Roanoke-Galax area, VA
* Rockingham County (NC) Academic Competition Challenge -- [[Reidsville, NC]] area
* [[Scholastic Competition for Academic Excellence League]] -- Martinsville area, VA, and formerly Lynchburg area, VA
* [[Southwest Academic Conference]] -- Bristol-Wytheville-Marion area, VA
* Valley ACE—Harrisonburg area, VA (disbanded, and members joined the VHSL competition for their districts.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3366">{{grading}}
'''Academic grading in Israel''' refers to the main [[grade (education)|grading scale]] used in [[Israel]]i schools. The scale, from 0 to 100, is employed at virtually all levels of [[education in Israel]], from elementary school, through high school and undergraduate academic studies, to graduate university degrees.

The 100-point grading scale sometimes used is as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Percentage !! Description !! Letter grade equivalent
|-
| 95–100 || {{rtl-lang|he|מצוין}} (Excellent) || A
|-
| 85–94 || {{rtl-lang|he|טוב מאוד}} (Very good)||A/B
|-
| 75–84 || {{rtl-lang|he|טוב}} (Good)||B/C
|-
| 65–74 || {{rtl-lang|he|כמעט טוב}} (Almost good)||C/D
|-
| 60–64 &lt;br&gt; 55–64 || {{rtl-lang|he|מספיק}} (Sufficient)||D/F
|-
| 45–54 || {{rtl-lang|he|מספיק בקושי}} (Barely sufficient (usually means failed))|| F
|-
|   &lt;45 || {{rtl-lang|he|בלתי מספיק/נכשל}} (Insufficient/Failed)|| F
|}

In many schools and universities, percentage-based grading is directly used without such partitions. This grading scheme is similar to the one used in [[Academic grading in India|India]]. It has the advantages of being precise and having a simple method of calculating GPA (a simple/weighted average of grades).

In secondary school (years 7–12), any grade below 55 is considered a failing grade. In the [[Bagrut examination]]s, any grade below 55 equals failure. In most universities{{cn|date=February 2013}}{{dubious|date=February 2013}} and colleges, any grade below 60 is considered as failure.

In Israeli academic institutions, [[latin honors|honors]] are usually bestowed upon graduates with 88 or better, with ''summa cum laude'' associated with a grade of 95 or higher, although some institutions have different practices.

The Israeli education system rarely employs curved grading at any stage (including at the academic level). To compensate for this, most academic institutions require that candidates undergo the [[Psychometric Entrance Test]], which in Israel provides examinees with an overall score of 200–800, the average being 535.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nite.org.il National Institute of Testing and Evaluation]'s report of 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law school grading==
Although the vast majority of Israeli academic institutions refrain from grading on a curve, the situation is different with law schools; only certain law faculties do not use curved grading. In most Israeli universities' and colleges' law faculties, the average grade is "normalized" to around 79 (i.e., 79/100 or C+ on a lettered GPA scale).

Different Institutes vary in their grading systems. "Insufficient" usually refers to "54" although, in some Institutes it might be lower or higher (up to even 64 for Medical School).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.huji.ac.il/ShowPage.asp?cat%3D443%26in%3D436 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618062233/http://info.huji.ac.il/ShowPage.asp?cat=443&amp;in=436 |archivedate=2012-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4163">[[File:CarlXVIGustafiLund1990.jpg|thumb|200px|Academic procession on the occasion of the conferment of doctoral degrees at [[Lund University]], [[Sweden]] in 1990. King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]] is wearing a doctoral hat as holder of an honorary doctorate, and to the right of him is seen [[Rector (academia)|rector]] magnificus Håkan Westling in his purple robes of office.]]
An '''academic procession''' is a traditional ceremony in which university dignitaries march together wearing traditional [[academic dress]]. An academic procession forms a usual part of college and university graduation exercises. At many U.S. universities, the colors and styles of regalia are determined by a uniform dress code established in 1895{{ref|dress}}.

[[File:Academic dress KCL.jpg|thumb|200px|Graduation procession of [[King's College London]], showcasing the academic dresses created by globally-renowned fashion designer [[Vivienne Westwood]] during the Summer 2008 graduation.]]

The installation of a university president is usually accompanied by a much more elaborate academic procession, involving visiting celebrants from other universities. In such processions, the order of appearance is governed by the institution's date of founding, oldest first. For example, when [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] was installed at [[Columbia University|Columbia]] in 1948:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...dignitaries from the world's oldest universities&amp;mdash;[[University of Bologna|Bologna]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Paris|Paris]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and [[University of Florence|Florence]]&amp;mdash;led the procession, and representatives from over three hundred American colleges and universities followed, including [[Harvard University|Harvard]]'s [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]], [[Yale University|Yale]]'s [[Charles Seymour]], [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]]'s [[Harold Stassen]], and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]'s Harold Dodds, and some two hundred other presidents.{{ref|eisenhower}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The order of academic processions explains in part why universities have a tendency to use strained rationales to claim traditional dates of founding that are as early as possible. For example, the University of Pennsylvania's George E. Thomas{{ref|thomas}} writes of a

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...debate over the founding date of the University that began in 1896 when The Alumni Register promoted the story that the University’s origins lay in George Whitefield’s Charity School that was ostensibly founded in 1740.  Because this school was to be located in the church building later acquired by the board founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1749 to house his new Academy, it could be claimed as the beginning of the University... this mergers-and-acquisitions model of institutional history had the desired effect of placing Penn ahead of Princeton in academic processions that in turn represented, in highly schematized form, the pecking order of American higher education. (The year before, in 1895, elite universities banded together to establish a national system of academic regalia that asserted an age- and class-based hierarchy and was most obviously expressed by placement in academic processions.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''African School of Economics''' (ASE) is a [[private university]] headquartered in [[Abomey-Calavi]] (near [[Cotonou]]), [[Republic of Benin]].

It is the expansion of the Institute for Empirical Research in Political Economy (IERPE, IREEP in French), founded in 2004, into a full-fledged pan-African university. Faculty members come from top universities in the US, Canada and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boulin|first1=Jean-Eric|title=Léonard Wantchékon : « En Afrique, la Chine a pris les devants sur les États-Unis »|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/8300/economie/l-onard-wantch-kon-en-afrique-la-chine-a-pris-les-devants-sur-les-tats-unis/|website=Jeune Afrique|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently (2016) it offers four graduate programs at the Masters level: Master in Mathematics, Economics and Statistics (MMES), Master in Business Administration (MBA), Master in Public Administration (MPA) and Master in Development Economics (MDE). ASE also offers a PhD program in Economics and two Certificate Programs, Impact Evaluation and Quantitative Finance.

==History==
The school is a continuation of the success of the [http://www.ireep.org Institute of Empirical Research in Political Economy (IERPE)] founded by [[Leonard Wantchekon]] in 2004 in Cotonou, Benin. A nonprofit training and research initiative in Political Economy and Applied Statistics, IERPE provides expertise in public policy and trains executives for the public and private sector in West Africa. The opening ceremony took place on August 29, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanschoolofeconomics.com/ase-in-the-press/163-ase-grand-opening-featured-at-educ-action ASE Grand Opening featured at magazine Educ Action] ''africanschoolofeconomics.com''.

[[File:African School of Economics and IREEP staff group picture.jpg|thumb|right|ASE and IERPE staff group picture (2014)]]
Since its inception, the Institute expanded its activities to include a successful Masters of Public Economics and Applied Statistics (MEPSA). The MEPSA has had 74 African graduates, all whom are in high demand in the West African region:  more than 75% of the graduates of the classes of 2006-2009 are employed in research centers throughout West Africa, in the World Bank and in different governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lander|first1=Jessica|title=Politics: Training Africa’s Leaders|url=http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2014/03/19/pages/1183/index.xml|website=Princeton Alumni Weekly|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MEPSA program is accredited by the Ministry of Education in Benin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IERPE: Promoting High School Math Education in Benin|url=http://www.thinktankinitiative.org/sites/default/files/TTI-SS_47_IERPE_0.pdf|website=Think Tank Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASE aims to meet the urgent need for an academic institution capable of generating the necessary human capital in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;*[https://chrisblattman.com/2015/03/24/economics-has-an-africa-problem/ Economics has an Africa problem?] ''Chris Blattman's Blog, Associate Professor of Political Science &amp; International and Public Affairs at Columbia University'' March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the region has seen significant improvements in primary and secondary education in the past few decades there is still a pressing need for advanced education centers.  Through its PhD programs, ASE hopes to provide the missing African voice in many Africa-related academic debates. Furthermore, through the Master in Business Administration (MBA), Master in Public Administration (MPA), Executive MBA and MPA (EMBA and EMPA), Master in Mathematics, Economics and Statistics (MMES), and Master in Development Studies (MDS) programs, ASE aims to provide the technical capacity that will enable more Africans to be hired into top management positions in development agencies and multinational corporations operating on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dossa|first1=Jean-Claude|title=Enseignement superieur en Afrique: La 1ère pierre de l’African School of Economics posée au Bénin|url=http://levenementprecis.com/2010/07/23/enseignement-superieur-en-afrique-la-1ere-pierre-de-l’african-school-of-economics-posee-au-benin/|website=L'Événement Précis}}&lt;/ref&gt; This should foster sustainable hiring practices that will retain talent and experience in Africa.

'''Amy Morris Bradley''' (September 12, 1823 – January 15, 1904) was an American educator from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maine]]. She established the first English-language school in [[Central America]]. She also spent over 30 years establishing free schools in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]].

==Early years==
She was born September 12, 1823, in [[East Vassalboro, Maine]]. She was a granddaughter of Asa Bradley, a soldier of the [[American Revolution]].{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=113}}

When she was six years old, her mother died, leaving a large family of children, Amy being the youngest.{{sfn|Howe|Graves|1904|p=476-78}}

==Career==
In 1840, she began to teach in country schools, and four years later was appointed principal of one of the grammar schools in [[Gardiner, Maine]]. In 1846, she became assistant teacher in the Winthrop grammar school of [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]], and afterward in the Putnam Grammar School, [[East Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. She taught until the autumn of 1849, when, hampered by [[pneumonia]], she was compelled to seek a milder climate. The winter of 1850-51 was passed in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] at the home of a brother, but with little benefit; and during the two years following, she was an invalid at her old home in Maine.

== Time in Central America ==
She was advised by her physician to live somewhere that was free from frost, in 1853, she went to [[San Jose, Costa Rica]], where her health improved. In three months after her arrival, she established the first English school in Central America.  She quickly mastered the Spanish language, and her pupils rapidly acquired the English. For nearly four years, she continued her educational work in San Jose.{{sfn|Howe|Graves|1904|p=476-78}}{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=113}}

=== Spanish Skills ===
In the summer of 1857, Bradley returned to her early home in East Vassalboro, where her father died in January, 1858. The knowledge of Spanish acquired by Bradley in Costa Rica led the [[New England Glass Company]], of East Cambridge to seek her services in translating letters.{{sfn|Howe|Graves|1904|p=476-78}}{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=113}}

== American Civil War service ==
She was in Cambridge in 1861, when the first gun was fired at [[Fort Sumter]]. After the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], she offered her services to the government as an army nurse. On 1 September 1861, she began working at the hospital of the Third Maine Regiment, encamped near [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. She was transferred to the Fifth Maine Regiment, and was soon appointed matron of the Seventeenth Brigade Hospital, General Slocum's Brigade, of which she had charge during the winter. In the spring of 1862, she responded to a call from the Relief Department of the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], and went with [[Dorothea Dix]] to [[Fort Monroe]]. She was assigned to service on the transport boats, and labored throughout the [[Peninsula Campaign]]. In December, 1862, she was sent to Convalescent Camp, Alexandria, and remained in charge of the Relief Department until the close of the [[American Civil War]].{{sfn|Howe|Graves|1904|p=476-78}}{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=113}}

==Wilmington schools==
[[File:Amy Morris Bradley.png|thumb|Bradley in later years]]
In 1866, at the request of the Soldiers' Memorial Society, of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and under the auspices of the [[American Unitarian Association]], she went to Wilmington, North Carolina, as a teacher of poor white children. Her position at first was a trying one, for she was a stranger and a northerner. She opened her school on 9 January 1867, with three children, in a humble building. Within a week, 67 pupils were enrolled, and soon two additional teachers were engaged by her, and, as the number of pupils rapidly increased, new schools were opened, the "Hemenway," the "Pioneer" and the "Normal," and the corps of teachers increased accordingly. Within a few months, citizens co-operated with the trustees of the Peabody Fund and other benefactors in erecting the needed buildings and forwarding the work started by Bradley. On 13 November 1871, the cornerstone of the Tileston Normal School was laid, and it was opened in October, 1872. This building was the gift of [[Mary Tileston Hemenway]], who had been interested in Bradley's work from its beginning, and whose appreciation of its importance found expression in the annual contribution of US$5,000 toward the support of the Tileston Normal School, from its opening in 1872 to its close in 1891. Failing health led Miss Bradley to resign her position in 1891.{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=113}} In all, Bradley spent over 30 years establishing free schools in Wilmington.{{sfn|American Unitarian Association|1908|p=1417}}

A collection of Bradley's manuscripts, papers, and diaries reside at the [[Duke University]] Library in Durham, North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amy Morris Bradley papers, 1806-1970; (bulk 1841-1921).|url=https://search.library.duke.edu/search?id=DUKE000847157|website=Duke University Libraries|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	  	
Bradley's religious affiliation was an Unitarian. She died in January 1904.{{sfn|Howe|Graves|1904|p=476-78}} She is buried at Oakdale Cemetery in Wilmington, North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amy Morris Bradley|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/28865960|website=Find a Grave|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anton Theophilus Boisen''' (29 October 1876 – 1 October 1965) was an American chaplain. He was a leading figure in the hospital chaplaincy and [[clinical pastoral education]] movements.&lt;ref name=Hart1994&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15228969409511257 | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 49–65 | last = Hart | first = Curtis W. | title = Anton Boisen: Madness, Mental Health and the Ministry | journal = Journal of Religion, Disability &amp; Health | date = 1994 | url = http://www.informaworld.com/10.1080/15228969409511257 }} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|49}}

==History==
Born in [[Bloomington, Indiana]], Boisen was the son of Hermann Balthsar Boisen and Elisabeth Louisa (Louise) Wylie.  Both his father and his maternal grandfather, [[Theophilus Adam Wylie]] from whom his middle name stemmed, were professors at [[Indiana University]]. When his father died in 1884, his family moved into [[Wylie House|Theophilus Wylie’s home]] .

Boisen graduated from [[Indiana University]] in 1897 and taught French and German, first in high school then later as a tutor at the university.  During this period he suffered the first of several major psychotic episodes he would experience.  Recovering from it, Boisen went on to study forestry and graduate from the [[Yale University School of Forestry]] in 1905.  He went on to work for the U.S. Forest Service for several years before suffering a second psychotic episode.

He entered the [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York]] and graduated in 1911.  Boisen moved from the Presbyterian to the Congregational Church, and worked for the next ten years in rural church survey work, in pastorates in both [[Kansas]] and [[Maine]].  For two years during [[World War I]], Boisen worked with the [[YMCA]] in Europe.   In 1917, Boisen returned from Europe and experienced another breakdown, but recovered to accept an offer to join the [[Interchurch World Movement]]. As part of that work, he moved to [[North Dakota]] to conduct a rural survey.

When the Interchurch World Movement collapsed in 1920, Boisen again fell victim to psychosis, and his family had him hospitalized at Westboro State Hospital, where it took him fifteen months to recover.  While at Westboro, Boisen experienced a [[religious calling]] to work to bring religion and medicine closer together.&lt;ref name=ACPE&gt;{{cite web|last=Leas |first=Robert |url=http://www.acpe.edu/cpehistory.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121210114406/http://www.acpe.edu/cpehistory.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-10 |title=History Corner |work=Association for Clinical Pastoral Education }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release, Boisen began studies in the psychology of religion at [[Andover Theological Seminary]] where he remained from 1922 to 1924 working especially with the physician and ethicist Richard Cabot.  In 1924 William Bryan of the Worcester State Hospital invited Boisen to become a hospital chaplain, and the following year he began a program at the hospital for the clinical training of theological students.&lt;ref name=ACPE/&gt;

Also during this period, Boisen began a five-year stint lecturing each fall quarter to students in the social ethics department of [[Chicago Theological Seminary]].  Boisen's ideas about mental illness began to mature during this period.  He explored the concept that mental illness represents a crisis brought about by the failure to grow into higher social loyalties, including loyalty to God.  In this way mental illness was purposive, he believed, and could be cured by the power of religion.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In 1930 he joined with others in forming the Council for the Clinical Training of Theological Students, which would expose students for extended periods to people suffering illness and crisis, mainly in mental hospitals.&lt;ref name=Hart1994/&gt;{{Rp|60–62}}  In the same year, however, the death of his mother helped to precipitate still another brief period of mental illness.&lt;ref name=Hart1994/&gt;{{Rp|57}}  This breakdown caused Cabot to withdraw his support for Boisen as chaplain at Worcester State Hospital and Boisen influence in the Council to wane.&lt;ref name=ACPE/&gt;

In 1932 Boisen became chaplain at [[Elgin State Hospital]]&lt;ref name=Hart1994/&gt;{{Rp|50}} near [[Chicago]] to be closer to Chicago Theological Seminary and to Alice Batchelder, a love interest who worked in Chicago.  While there Boisen organized a Chicago Council for the Clinical Training of Theological Students,&lt;ref name=ACPE/&gt; functioning effectively until he learned in 1935 Alice Batchelder was dying of cancer.  The discovery resulted in his brief hospitalization in Baltimore, Maryland, but in December 1935 he returned to his chaplaincy post at Elgin where he remained as chaplain until 1954, then chaplain emeritus at Elgin until his death.

==Views==
Boisen believed that some mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, could be interpreted as one's attempts to solve "problems of the soul".&lt;ref name=ACPE /&gt; Later, he explored the concept that mental illness represents a crisis brought about by the failure to grow into higher social loyalties, including loyalty to God. In this way mental illness was purposive, he believed, and could be cured by the power of religion.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Published works==
In 1936 he published his ideas about religion and mental health in ''Exploration of the Inner World'', which he dedicated to Batchelder.&lt;ref name=Hart1994/&gt;{{Rp|51,56}}  The book was praised by the ''New York Times Review of Books'' as being a "significant contribution to the religious literature field."&lt;ref name=ACPE/&gt; Boisen continued to expound his religious views in additional articles and books, notably ''Religion in Crisis and Custom'' (1955) and ''Out of the Depths'' (1960), his autobiography.

The ''Chinese university ranking'' is a [[College and university rankings|ranking of universities]] in [[Mainland China]] compiled by Wu Shulian, a researcher at the [[Chinese Academy of Management Science]] (unconfirmed). He has been studying "Chinese University Ranking" since 1991 and leader of "Chinese University Ranking Research Group".

==Introduction==
The [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], Chinese University Alumni Association, [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]], and many other academic organizations constantly ranks universities in [[mainland China]] and in the World in many aspects/fields, including the general ranking, rankings of [[engineering]], [[natural science]]s, [[medicine]], social sciences, law, [[philosophy]], [[management]], etc. This college ranking has met with controversies in China, and counters criticisms that its biased metrics debase many highly respected universities but inflate many second-tier universities.

The leader of this university ranking program is Wu Shulian, who's claimed to be a researcher at the Academy (Guangdong branch). However, his position has not been confirmed by the [[Chinese Academy of Management Science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edu.sina.com.cn/l/2002-05-21/24804.html 武书连简介(图)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GTC"&gt;Ya, Wen, [http://opinion.globaltimes.cn/Observer/2009-05/429561.html "Universities in fee-for-ranking scandal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707031434/http://opinion.globaltimes.cn/Observer/2009-05/429561.html |date=July 7, 2011 }}, ''The [[Global Times]]'', May 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There are not much information about the ranking team. Some sources claim that the team leader  Wu Shulian was born in Shandong, studied electronic engineering at Tsinghua University and got master's degree of management engineering from Zhejiang University.

The methodology of this ranking is quite similar to the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]. As any university ranking, this ranking has also continuously suffered with numerous criticisms.

==Top 100 universities==

The annual ranking has been continuously released since 1996. Top 100 universities out of 2,236 colleges and universities (general/integrated ranking) since 2002 are as below, as well as 1996 ranking.

* &lt;ref&gt;Top 10 in 1996, [http://learning.sohu.com/20050221/n224361530.shtml 盘点1987～2005中国大学排行榜  (Summarily Counting 1987-2005 Chinese university rankings)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The rank once tried category ranking in 1998. To list top 5, comprehensive universities ranking: 1. [[Nanjing University]], 2. [[Peking University]], 3. [[Fudan University]], 4. [[Shandong University]], 5. [[Jilin University]], and technological universities ranking:  1. [[Tsinghua University]], 2. [[Zhejiang University]], 3. [[Southeast University]], 4. [[Huazhong University of Science and Technology]], 5. [[Xi'an Jiaotong University]]. However, many schools developed to be comprehensive universities soon later, including through mergers.
* Since about the year 2000 there were peaks of mergers of universities for several years, and one of the reasons for them is to become comprehensive universities.
* [[China University of Petroleum]] has two branches: One in Beijing and the other one in [[Qingdao]], [[Shandong Province]]. The Qingdao branch is ranked among Top 100 (no. 83).
* [[China University of Geosciences]] also has two branches: One in Beijing and the other one in [[Wuhan]], [[Hubei Province]]. Both branches are ranked among Top 100 (Wuhan no. 72 and Beijing no. 88).

==Controversies==
In 2009, the leader of this university ranking program, Mr. Wu Shulian, was reported to have been involved in a fee-for-ranking scandal, involving universities being able to pay money to the ranking program in order to boost their rankings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/05/universities-in-fee-for-ranking-scandal/]&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the creditability of his ranking came under criticism.

The [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China]] strongly opposes all university rankings, especially those based on payment of “fees”, a ministry spokeswoman Xu Mei said. The sharp comments came in response to a recent story that [[Chengdu University of Technology]] (CDUT) had possibly paid to climb the “China university rankings” table.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edu.sina.com.cn/focus/utop.html Top Universities], Education section of [[Sina.com|Sina News]]&lt;/ref&gt; The university had invited “program director” Wu Shulian to lecture in 2004 and in 2006, a source at the university told the Beijing-based People's Daily. After Wu had received his 50,000 yuan “remittance”, the school's ranking rose from 116 in 2004 to 92 in 2007. It fell to 103 in 2009, ''[[People's Daily]]'' reported.&lt;ref name="GTC"/&gt;

A study (referred as the study within this paragraph) by anonymous group from Chinese University of Science and Technology showed that [[California Institute of Technology]] would rank out of this Chinese university ranking if calculated by Wu Shulian's ranking standard, which was considered ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=王磊|script-title=zh:加州理工排不进"武书连大学排行榜"前五百|url=http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2012-05/15/nw.D110000zgqnb_20120515_1-03.htm|accessdate=August 22, 2012|newspaper=[[China Youth Daily]]|date=May 15, 2012|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; This widespread controversy has greatly affected the credit of this ranking program and has been reported by many medias.&lt;ref&gt;http://edu.qq.com/a/20120515/000010.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sc.sina.com.cn/edu/info/gaokao/2012-05-15/114021121.html&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Wu Shuliang officially responded with published paper in Higher Education Development and Evaluation,&lt;ref&gt;http://edu.qq.com/a/20120928/000272.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_4b2cb00e0102e0a0.html&lt;/ref&gt; addressing several important mistakes made by the study. The mistakes include failure to correctly use Mr. Wu Shuliang's ranking method, failure to show the calculation process and thus cannot be repeated, inappropriate publishing classified data by [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China]], inappropriate use of unavailable/non-equivalent indices/scores for [[California Institute of Technology]] which constitutes 78.79% of total indices/scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wushulianvip.blog.163.com/blog/static/167901482201251425320419/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202195709/http://wushulianvip.blog.163.com/blog/static/167901482201251425320419/ |archivedate=February 2, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://baike.baidu.com/view/163202.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Wu Shuliang's paper shows [[California Institute of Technology]] clearly ranks much higher than any of Chinese Universities using his published method with proper treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12988">'''Christopher Cherniak''' is an American [[neuroscientist]], a member of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] Philosophy Department. Cherniak’s research trajectory started in theory of knowledge and led into computational neuroanatomy and genomics. The underlying linkage between the areas concerns models of the agent: The work began with more realistic, bounded-resource models of rationality. From this epistemology in turn stemmed a research program concerning optimal-wiring models of global brain and genome anatomy, a structuralist approach.

==Minimal Agents==
Cherniak’s monograph ''Minimal Rationality'' states that&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | title=Minimal rationality
 | publisher=MIT Press
 | isbn=0-262-03122-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bounded-resource models of the agent characterize human rationality as falling between nothing and perfection. The apercu motivating the rationality critiques is conveyed by the realization that standard idealizations entail some deductive omniscience - for instance, triviality of portions of the deductive sciences. Such ideal agent/logicians, if computational, would have to violate [[Church's Theorem]] on undecidability of first-order logic. This insight in turn indicates that [[NP-completeness]] is of parallel interest: computational intractability of a cosmos-consuming scale is a practical counterpart to traditional absolute uncomputability - another layer of impossibility for the idealizations.

This is part of the philosophical significance of computational complexity.

This research program proceeds from a holistic rather than compartmentalized perspective, where philosophy and science are distinct but inextricably interconnected. For instance, the classical paradoxes of semantics (e.g., the [[Liar Paradox]]) and set theory (e.g., [[Russell's Paradox]]) can be reexamined not as pathology, but instead as signs of use of “quick and dirty heuristics” - that is, speed-reliability tradeoffs of correctness for feasibility. Three disparate fields thereby converge: (a) computational complexity theory, (b) empirical psychology of quick and dirty heuristics, (c) philosophical theory of bounded-resource rationality. In this way, the bounded rationality models serve as a foundation of current “[[behavioral economics]]”.

==Brainwiring Optimization==
In addition, it is perhaps natural to extend the bounded-resource approach along these lines down from rationality to the brainwiring hardware level. In particular, longrange connectivity is a critically constrained neural resource, with strong evolutionary pressure to employ efficiently. Connection minimization seems a first law of brain [[tractography]], an organizing principle driving neuroanatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 | first=Christopher 
 | last=Cherniak
 | year=1994
 | title=Philosophy and computational neuroanatomy
 | journal= Philosophical Studies
 | volume=73
 | pages=89–107

The Cherniak laboratory has therefore been gauging how well wiring-optimization ideas from computer microchip design apply to brain structure. "Save wire" turns out to be a strongly predictive model. Wiring minimization can be detected at multiple levels (e.g., placement of the entire brain, layout of its ganglia and/or cortex areas, subcellular architecture of dendrite arbors, etc.). Much of this biological structure seems to arise "for free, directly from physics".

A key specific wiring problem is component placement optimization:  Given a set of interconnected components, what are the positionings of the components that minimize total connection costs (e.g., wirelength)? This concept seems to account quite precisely for aspects of neuroanatomy at multiple hierarchical levels. For instance, the nervous system of the roundworm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' includes eleven ganglionic components, which have 11! (~40,000,000) alternative possible anteroposterior orderings. In fact, the actual here is the ideal, in that the actual layout turns out to require the minimum total wirelength,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 | first=Christopher 
 | last=Cherniak

 | volume=14
 | pages=2418–2427
 | url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/14/4/2418.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; a predictive success story. However, such problems are NP-complete; exact solutions generally appear to entail bruteforce searches, with exponentially exploding costs. Despite local minimum traps, this neuroanatomy optimization can be approximated well by “mesh of springs” energy-minimization mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A corresponding approach can be applied to placement of interconnected functional areas of [[cerebral cortex]]. A first strategy is to use a simpler connection cost measure, conformance of a cortex layout to a wire-saving Adjacency Heuristic: If components are connected, then they are placed adjacent to each other. Sampling of all possible layouts is still required to verify the best ones. For 17 core visual areas of macaque cortex, the actual layout of this subsystem ranks in the top 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; layouts best minimizing their adjacency costing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | pmc=327154
 | volume=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar high optimality rankings also hold for the core set of visual areas of cat cortex, and also for rat olfactory cortex and amygdala.

In addition, a “Size Law” appears to apply to systems with such local-global tradeoffs: If a complete system is in fact perfectly optimized, then the smaller the subset of it evaluated by itself, the poorer the optimization tends to appear. (This is a generalization of a related perspective-dependent idea seen in theology, to account for the [[problem of evil]] – of apparent imperfections in the Universe with an omnipotent, benevolent deity.) The Size Law applies well to each of the above cortex systems, as well as elsewhere (e.g., for microchip design).

With such a network optimization framework, these “Save wire” results have been extended and replicated for the complete living human cerebrum via fMRI,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; another predictive success.

Neuron dendrite and axon arbors also appear significantly to approximate minimum-cost Steiner trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | doi=10.1103/physreve.59.6001}}&lt;/ref&gt; These structures are derivable via fluid dynamics. This seems to constitute some of the most complex biostructure presently obtainable from simple (non-DNA) physical processes. Such a “Physics suffices” account of biological morphogenesis constitutes a “Nongenomic Nativism”. One rationale for the pre-biotic pervading the biotic in this way is to cope with the “genomic bottleneck”: Like other organism systems, the genome has limited capacities. So the more neuroanatomy “for free, directly from physics”, the less the genome information-carrying load.

Another question arises: Neural wiring minimization is of course valuable, but why should it seem to have such a high priority – sometimes apparently near-maximal? The significance of ultra-fine neural optimization remains an open question.

An additional issue concerns how the intentional level of mind meshes with the hardware level of brain. Prima facie, that relationship appears in tension: In some aspects, the brainwiring appears virtually perfectly optimized, yet the rationality has layers of impossibility between it and perfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | publisher=College Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps this is another manifestation of irreducibility of the mental – the well-known  poor fit of the two domains with each other.

==Genome as NanoBrain==

A next chapter of this research program: Concepts from the theory of computation can be applied to understand the structure and function of organisms' DNA. The Crick-Watson [[double-helix]] model emerged at the same place and time as Turing's final work, namely Cambridge around 1950, so an idea of DNA-as-Turing-machine-tape has floated around for decades.

In particular, the genome can be treated like a "nano-brain” or pico-computer to see whether similar connection minimization strategies also appear in gene networks. As sketched above, for decades, wiring optimization in the brain has been reported that begins to approach some of the most precisely confirmed predictions in neuroscience.

Now a connection-minimization idea is being explored for the human genome. Information transmission may not be cost-free even within a cell, nucleus, or genome. For example, a statistically significant supra-chromosomal homunculus – a global representation of the human body - appears to extend over the entire genome in the nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In addition, finer-scale somatotopic mappings seem to occur on individual autosomal chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''eLesson Markup Language''' ('''eLML''')  is an open source [[XML]] framework for creating electronic lessons. It is a "spin-off" from the GITTA project, a Swiss [[GIS]] eLearning project, and was launched in spring 2004. The eLML project is hosted at [[Sourceforge]]. The aim of eLML was to offer authors a tool that ensured conformity to pedagogical guidelines.

== Pedagogical model behind eLML ==
eLML is based on a teaching model called ECLASS (Gerson, 2000 [http://www.westga.edu/~distance/ojdla/winter34/gerson34.html]). ECLASS is an abbreviation for the following elements:
* Entry: Stands for the introduction into the lesson or a unit (the sub-category of a lesson)
* Clarify: A clarify element is used to explain some theory, models, principles or facts
* Look: Examples that help the student to understand the theory
* Act: This elements animates the student to become active, try out a model or discuss issues
* Self-Assessment: Check if the learning objectives of the lesson or unit were fulfilled
* Summary: Provides a brief summary of either the whole lesson or an individual unit

The original ECLASS model was slightly modified and e.g. additional elements like glossary, bibliography and metadata were added to be able to create a self-contained e-learning course. Furthermore, the three elements clarify, look and act together form a so-called "learning object" and these elements can be used in any sequence order and can even be used multiple times within one learning object. This allows that an author can start with an example (look) and then follow by explaining the theory (clarify) behind it or the other way round. Also the uncommon but sometimes very successful approach where the student starts with a short exercise (act) and only after having tried out some solutions can read the theory (clarify) behind it and see some real-world examples (look). The ECLASS model is on one hand flexible enough to represent different learning scenarios and to meet all the requirements needed by the creators of the e-learning lessons but ensures on the other hand that the content complies with the defined didactical guidelines.

These didactical guidelines where then mapped into an XML structure that allowed a strict checking if the author has correctly used the pedagogical model or not. The details are explained in detail below.

== The XML structure of eLML ==
The described pedagogical model ECLASS is mapped onto an XML structure using XML Schema, as shown in this illustration:
 [[Image:Elml schema screenshot en.png|thumb]]

An eLML lesson always starts with either the mandatory introduction (element entry) or a concise listing of the lesson’s learning objectives (element goals). The unit elements, described below, contain the actual content of a lesson. Following the units a lesson can have a summary and/or up to five self-assessments followed by an optional further reading and glossary section to list important resources and to describe terms used within the lesson. The XML Schema ensures that all glossary terms used in a lesson are defined in the glossary. The [[Harvard Referencing]] System or the [[APA style]] can be used for the bibliography. All citations, references, further readings etc., must be listed within the bibliography section, otherwise the XML parser issues an error and the lesson is not valid.

Through an amount of mandatory elements eLML ensures that at least the minimal metadata elements are filled out even though many authors do not like to fill in metadata information. The eLML metadata elements are a subset of the IMS [[Learning object metadata]] (LOM) that can be used to store data about the length of the lessons, the author(s), copyrights, the required knowledge to attempt this lesson and the basic technical requirements. The bibliography style elements and the metadata section are defined in a separate XML schema and thus can be replaced by other standards or definitions.

Within each unit a similar structure as on lesson level is employed. However, the elements glossary, bibliography and metadata are always defined for the whole lesson on lesson level. The actual content within a unit is stored in a number of so-called "learning objects" (not to be confused with the learning objectives – called "goals" within eLML). Each learning object describes a certain concept, model, equation, term, or process using all or some of the three elements clarify (theory), look (example) and act in free order. These three elements can have a special visual representation when transformed into a presentation format – e.g. a "gear" icon for act elements as used in GITTA to signalize the student that he or she has to "do" something – but their main purpose is to guide authors while creating content. Using the elements clarify, look and act, the author has to think about how a certain concept can be presented best to the student. Whether a learning object starts with some theory (clarify element) and continues with one or more examples (look elements) or, alternatively, the student first does something (act element) and then read the theory afterwards (clarify element) is left to the author.

== Transformation and Presentation of an eLML lesson ==

Thanks to the use of standards like [[XML]], [[XSLT]] or [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] all eLML lessons can be transformed and viewed with any web-browser on any platform and are totally software-independent. The two main transformation files that are included in the eLML package can transform a lesson into an "online" (both [[XHTML]] 1.1 and [[HTML5]]) and into a "print" ([[PDF]]) version (using [[XSL Formatting Objects]]) with one click. Both versions can be customized offering personalized layouts (see example below). More transformation files provided by eLML cover the following output formats: [[ODF]] (Open Document Format), [[DocBook]], [[LaTeX]] and since 2010 also [[eBooks]] based on the [[ePub]] format. Since eLML supports both the IMS Global "Content Package" and the [[SCORM]] standard, the content can also easily be imported into any modern [[Learning Management System]] (LMS) like [[WebCT]] or [[OLAT]]. To create nice looking templates eLML offers a tool called "Template Builder" and it has built-in support for a CSS-framework called [[YAML]]. The following illustration shows an eLML lesson transformed into many different layouts and formats:

[[Image:Elml layout.png|thumb]]

== Tools for eLML ==
Starting with version 5, eLML offers a wide range of tools: The ''eLML Editor'' to create lessons (based on the Firedocs Mozilla Firefox XML-Editor, the ''Template Builder'' to create layout templates (created as a Google Summer of Code project), and Add-On's for Apache Lenya CMS etc. With eLML 7 release a new transformation tool to create online lessons in various formats was launched: ''EasyELML''.

==Copyright and legal issues==
eLML is an open source project and available under the [[Apache License|Apache 2 License]]. The main communication between the community users goes via the [[Sourceforge]] website, specially via the eLML-Users Mailinglist (for general issues) and the RFE (Feature Request) Tracker (for discussions about new features).

For primary and secondary education, government schools educate approximately 60% of Australian students, with approximately 40% in private or independent schools.&lt;ref name="absyear" /&gt; At the tertiary level, the majority of [[List of universities in Australia|Australia's universities]] are public, and student fees are subsidised through a [[Tertiary education fees in Australia|student loan program]] where payment becomes due when graduates reach a certain income level.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertiary education fees in Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For primary and secondary schools, a national [[Australian Curriculum]] has been progressively developed and implemented since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/curriculumhistory|title=Curriculum version history|last=|first=|date=|website=The Australian Curriculum|publisher=Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority|language=en-AU|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704204435/http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/curriculumhistory|archive-date=4 July 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Education Index]], published with the [[United Nations|UN]]'s [[Human Development Index]] in 2008, based on data from 2006, lists Australia as 0.993, the highest in the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf|title=Human development indices|date=18 December 2008|publisher=Human Development Reports|accessdate=16 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219191319/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf|archivedate=19 December 2008|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Australia signed the [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]], which aims to combat discrimination and [[racial segregation]] in the field of education.

== Regulation and funding ==
The regulation, operation, and funding of education is the responsibility of the [[States and territories of Australia|States and territories]], because the Federal Government does not have a specific [[Section 51 of the Constitution of Australia|constitutional power]] to pass laws with respect to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html|title=COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA CONSTITUTION ACT - SECT 51 Legislative powers of the Parliament [see Notes 10 and 11]|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=19 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411044012/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html|archivedate=11 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Federal government helps fund independent or private schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aea2013210/s21.html|title=AUSTRALIAN EDUCATION ACT 2013 - SECT 21 Financial assistance for schools|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=19 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131190538/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aea2013210/s21.html|archivedate=31 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; helps fund public universities and subsidises tertiary education through [[Tertiary education fees in Australia|a national student loan scheme]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/hefa1988221/|title=HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING ACT 1988|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=19 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324005521/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/hefa1988221/|archivedate=24 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regulates vocational education providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nveatra2011492/|title=NATIONAL VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING REGULATOR ACT 2011|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=19 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319235130/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nveatra2011492/|archivedate=19 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-compulsory education is regulated within the [[Australian Qualifications Framework]], a unified system of national qualifications in schools, vocational education and training, and the tertiary education sector.

The Federal Government's involvement in education has been the responsibility of a number of departments over the years,&lt;ref&gt;These include: Department of Education, Employment and Training (DEET) (1988), [[Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs]] (DEETYA) (1996), [[Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs]] (DETYA) (1997), [[Department of Education, Science and Training (Australia)|Department of Education, Science and Training]] (DEST) (2001), [[Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations]] (DEEWR) (2007), [[Department of Education (Australia)]] (2013), [[Department of Education and Training (Australia)]] (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; the present version of which is the [[Department of Education and Training (Australia)|Department of Education and Training]].

The academic year in Australia varies between States and institutions, but generally runs from late January/early February until early/mid-December for primary and secondary schools, with slight variations in the inter-term holidays&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.det.wa.edu.au/education/termdates/|title=School Term Dates|publisher=[[Department of Education (Western Australia)]]|accessdate=2 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414193850/http://www.det.wa.edu.au/education/termDATES/|archivedate=14 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schools.nsw.edu.au/calendar/?do=setViewPeriod&amp;categoryid=21&amp;viewType=yearView|title=School Calendar|publisher=[[Department of Education and Training (New South Wales)]]|accessdate=16 February 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011041034/http://www.schools.nsw.edu.au/calendar/?do=setViewPeriod&amp;categoryid=21&amp;viewType=yearView|archivedate=11 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decs.sa.gov.au/custserve/|title=South Australian State Schools Term Dates|publisher=[[Department of Education and Children's Services]]|accessdate=16 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214133409/http://www.decs.sa.gov.au/custserve/|archivedate=14 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.det.nt.gov.au/students/at-school/term-dates|title=Term Dates|publisher=[[Department of Education and Training (Northern Territory)]]|accessdate=16 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730080814/http://www.det.nt.gov.au/students/at-school/term-dates|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.vic.gov.au/about/keydates/termdates.htm|title=Term Dates – Key Dates|publisher=[[Department of Education and Early Childhood Development (Victoria)]]|accessdate=16 February 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209113302/http://www.education.vic.gov.au/about/keydates/termdates.htm|archivedate=9 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.det.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/108521/Term_Dates_and_Public_Holidays_2010.pdf |title=Term Dates and Public Holidays |publisher=[[Department of Education and Training (Australian Capital Territory)]] |accessdate=16 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sMxdjxAk?url=http://www.det.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/108521/Term_Dates_and_Public_Holidays_2010.pdf |archivedate=30 August 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.qld.gov.au/public_media/calendar/holidays.html|title=State Schools Holidays and Qld Public Holidays|publisher=[[Department of Education, Training and Employment (Queensland)|Department of Education and Training (Queensland)]]|accessdate=16 February 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207231458/http://education.qld.gov.au/public_media/calendar/holidays.html|archivedate=7 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.tas.gov.au/school/termdates|title=Term dates for Tasmanian Government school students|publisher=[[Department of Education (Tasmania)]]|accessdate=16 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221230445/http://www.education.tas.gov.au/school/termdates|archivedate=21 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and TAFE colleges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tafe.sa.edu.au/Default.aspx?tabid=1316|title=Term Dates|publisher=[[TAFE SA]]|accessdate=16 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001071549/http://www.tafe.sa.edu.au/Default.aspx?tabid=1316|archivedate=1 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swin.edu.au/studentoperations/calendar/useful-information.html#tafe|title=TAFE Term Dates|publisher=[[Swinburne University of Technology]]|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tafensw.edu.au/students/calendar.htm|title=Student calendar|publisher=[[TAFE NSW]]|accessdate=16 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516072536/http://www.tafensw.edu.au/students/calendar.htm|archivedate=16 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from late February until mid-November for universities with seasonal holidays and breaks for each educational institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitiesaustralia.edu.au/documents/universities/semester_dates/UA-Semester-Dates-2010.pdf |title=Summary of 2010 Principal Academic Dates for Australian Universities |publisher=Universities Australia |accessdate=16 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001090804/http://www.universitiesaustralia.edu.au/documents/universities/semester_dates/UA-Semester-Dates-2010.pdf |archivedate=1 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preschool==
Preschool and pre-prep programmes in [[Australia]] are relatively unregulated, and are not compulsory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playgroupaustralia.com.au/files/pdf/playgroupAU_page_Vision_and_Mission.pdf|title=Vision and Mission|publisher=Playgroup Australia|format=PDF|accessdate=29 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503225437/http://playgroupaustralia.com.au/files/pdf/playgroupAU_page_Vision_and_Mission.pdf|archivedate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first exposure many Australian children have to learning with others outside of traditional parenting is [[day care]] or a parent-run [[Pre-school playgroup#Playgroups in Australia|playgroup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.playgroupaustralia.com.au/files/pdf/playgroupAU_page_History.pdf|publisher=Playgroup Australia|accessdate=29 June 2010|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808164309/http://www.playgroupaustralia.com.au/files/pdf/playgroupAU_page_History.pdf|archivedate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sort of activity is not generally considered schooling, as [[preschool education in Australia|preschool education]] is separate from primary school in all states and territories, except Western Australia where pre-school education is taught as part of the primary school system&lt;ref name="resp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeufederal.org.au/Ec/PreschoolEducationSheetNo2.pdf |title=The Structures of Preschool Education in Australia |format=PDF |accessdate=18 February 2010 |date=October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sMxe4dQq?url=http://www.aeufederal.org.au/Ec/PreschoolEducationSheetNo2.pdf |archivedate=30 August 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Victoria where the state framework, [http://www.education.vic.gov.au/Documents/childhood/providers/edcare/veyldframework.pdf VEYLDF] covers children from birth to 8 years old, is used by some schools over the federal framework. In Queensland, preschool programmes are often called Kindergarten or Pre-Prep, and are usually privately run but attract state government funding if run for at least 600 hours a year and delivered by a registered teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Office for Early Childhood Education and Care|title=Kindergarten programs|url=http://deta.qld.gov.au/earlychildhood/families/kindy-programs.html|accessdate=22 September 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514104023/http://deta.qld.gov.au/earlychildhood/families/kindy-programs.html|archivedate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of whether a school is part of the Government, Catholic or independent systems, they are required to adhere to the same curriculum frameworks of their state or territory. The curriculum framework however provides for some flexibility in the syllabus, so that subjects such as [[religious education]] can be taught. Most school students wear uniforms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/living-in-australia/settle-in-australia/everyday-life/education/whatforme.htm|title=What schooling and training is there for my family and me?|publisher=[[Department of Immigration and Citizenship]]|accessdate=16 February 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415213947/http://www.immi.gov.au/living-in-australia/settle-in-australia/everyday-life/education/whatforme.htm|archivedate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are varying expectations and some Australian schools do not require uniforms. A common movement among secondary schools to support [[student voice]] has taken form as organisations such as [[VicSRC]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] bring together student leaders to promote school improvement.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Most Catholic schools are either run by their local parish, local diocese and their state's Catholic education department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaide.catholic.org.au/sites/CatholicEducationOfficesSA/about-us/catholic-education-office|title=Catholic Education Office|accessdate=12 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118230304/http://www.adelaide.catholic.org.au/sites/CatholicEducationOfficesSA/about-us/catholic-education-office|archivedate=18 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cecnsw.catholic.edu.au/dbpage.php?pg=about&amp;_navlink=2|title=About CEC|publisher=Catholic Education Commission of NSW|accessdate=12 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513055533/http://www.cecnsw.catholic.edu.au/dbpage.php?pg=about&amp;_navlink=2|archivedate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Independent schools include schools operated by secular educational philosophies such as [[Waldorf education|Steiner]] or [[Montessori]]; however, the majority of independent schools are religious, being [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Islam]]ic or non-denominational. In addition, many private schools are also Catholic, but independent of those run by the Church and Catholic education departments, which are classed as systemic schools. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isca.edu.au/html/school_about.htm|title=About Independent Schools|publisher=Independent Schools Council of Australia|accessdate=12 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004214749/http://www.isca.edu.au/html/school_about.htm|archivedate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Catholic and independent schools charge high fees, and because of this, Government funding for these schools is often criticised by the [[Australian Education Union]] and the [[Australian Greens|Greens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parra.catholic.edu.au/our-schools/school-fees/school-fees.aspx|title=School Fees|publisher=Catholic Education – Diocese of Parramatta|accessdate=12 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031010347/http://www.parra.catholic.edu.au/our-schools/school-fees/school-fees.aspx|archivedate=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeufederal.org.au/Debates/ReidPaper.html|last=Reid|first=Alan|title=The Redefinition of Public Education|date=May 1999|publisher=The Australian Education Union|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215174248/http://www.aeufederal.org.au/Debates/ReidPaper.html|archivedate=15 February 2008|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- | colspan = "4" style="border-top: solid 2px;background-color: #bbf;"| VCE

== Issues and controversies ==
===Government education policy===
Despite a substantial increase in government spending per student over the past ten years (after correcting for [[inflation]]), the proportion of students who are proficient in math, reading and science have actually declined over that same period. The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and the [[Menzies Research Centre]] have both concluded that increasing school funding above a basic level has little effect on student proficiency. Instead, they both recommend greater autonomy. That is, the states should merely monitor the performance of the schools. Individual principals should have full authority and responsibility for ensuring student proficiency in core areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===School violence===
In [[Queensland]], the Education Minister of the State of Queensland said in July 2009 that the rising levels of [[school violence|violence in schools]] in Queensland were "totally unacceptable" and that not enough had been done to combat violent behaviour. In Queensland, 55,000 school students had been suspended in 2008, nearly a third of which were for "physical misconduct".&lt;ref&gt;Chilcott, T., &amp; Odgers, R. (9 July 2009).

In [[South Australia]], 175 violent attacks against students or staff were recorded in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/26/2609043.htm School violence 'dealt with'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210154740/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/26/2609043.htm |date=10 February 2010 }}.

The [[European Union]]'s '''Erasmus Mundus''' programme aims to enhance quality in higher education through [[scholarship]]s and academic co-operation between the EU and the rest of the world.

Erasmus Mundus comprises three actions:
* Joint programmes
* Partnerships
* Attractiveness projects

==Erasmus Mundus Joint Programmes==
Under Action 1, Erasmus Mundus supports Joint Programmes ([[Master's degree|Masters Courses]] and Joint Doctorates) that are operated by consortia of higher education institutions from the EU and (since 2009) elsewhere in the world. They provide an integrated course and joint or multiple diplomas following study or research at two or more higher education institutions.
 
Erasmus Mundus funds a number of scholarships for students and academics studying or teaching on Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses. Since 2010, fellowships have also been available for doctoral candidates following one of the Joint doctorates.

Scholarships cover participation costs, subsistence costs, and insurance for the duration of the study period. Many students also have the right to a contribution to travel costs.

==Erasmus Mundus partnerships==
Under Action 2, Erasmus Mundus Partnerships bring together higher education institutions from Europe and from a particular region in the world. Together, the partnerships manage mobility flows between the two regions for a range of academic levels—undergraduate, masters, doctorate, [[post-doctorate]]—and for academic staff.

Scholarships cover participation costs, subsistence costs, insurance for the duration of the study period, plus a contribution to travel costs.

==Erasmus Mundus Attractiveness Projects==
Under Action 3, Erasmus Mundus funds projects to enhance the attractiveness and visibility of European higher education worldwide. Activities focus on the international dimension of higher education, often targeting a particular region or academic discipline.

== Funding ==
Funding is available for:
* European joint masters and doctorates
* Partnerships with non-European higher education institutions and scholarships for students and academics
* Projects to promote European higher education worldwide

==In popular culture==
Pakistani novelist [[Nimra Ahmed]]'s novel "Jannat K Patte" (Leaves of Heaven) is based on [[Erasmus Programme]], where the protagonist Haya went to [[Sabancı University]] through Erasmus Mundus, which marked the turning point in her life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urdunovelsonline.com/category/nimra-ahmed/ Online novels by Nimra Ahmed]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Faculty of Political Science of the University of Ankara''' ({{lang-tr|'''Ankara Üniversitesi Siyasal Bilgiler Fakültesi'''}}, more simply known as "'''''SBF'''''") is the oldest faculty of [[social science]] in [[Turkey]], being the successor of the "'''Mekteb-i Mülkiye'''" (also known as the "'''Mülkiye'''") which was established in [[Istanbul]] on February 12, 1859, under the reign of [[Sultan Abdulaziz]], then moved to [[Ankara]] in 1936 under a new name, and was incorporated to [[Ankara University]] on April 3, 1950, under its current name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siyasiilimler.org.tr/docpdf/The_Origins_of_Political_Studies-Ilter_Turan.pdf İlter Turan - "Political Science in Turkey,  The Origins of Political Studies", Istanbul Bilgi University.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Faculty of Political Science provides higher education in the fields of Social Science, Public Finance, Economics, Public Administration, Labor Economics, Business Administration and International Relations.
It is considered to be one of the most influential institutes in the political life of Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politics.ankara.edu.tr/english/index.php|title=Ankara University, Faculty of Economic Science|first=|date=|website=www.politics.ankara.edu.tr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The faculty was founded in Istanbul as a community college in 1859 and has undergone series of changes since the establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Carter Vaughn Findley, Ottoman Civil Officialdom: A Social History, Princeton University Press, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; It was named Mekteb-i Mülkiye-i Şahane under the Ministry of Internal Affairs but in 1918 the name was changed to "Mekteb-i Mülkiye" under the Ministry of Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Mülkiyeusa.com/#!meet-the-faculty/aboutPage Mülkiye USA - Meet the Faculty]&lt;/ref&gt; After the founding of the Republic, at the request of Atatürk, the school was moved to Ankara, and named the School of Political Science. The length of study was also increased to 4 years. On March 23, 1950, the school was placed under Ankara University, and its name was changed to Ankara University, Faculty of Political Science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.ankara.edu.tr/english/?bil=bil_icerik&amp;icerik_id=284&amp;menu=0&amp;ens_birim=0 SBF - Faculty Information]&lt;/ref&gt; The school has been a symbol of freedom of expression and organization. Holders of every different political view have found there an environment in which they could freely express themselves on a democratic platform as an important difference between Mülkiye and other universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Mülkiye-celebrates-glorious-history.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=Mülkiye-celebrates-glorious-history-2006-12-05 Hurriyet Daily News - Mülkiye celebrates glorious history, 05.12.2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/14683857.2014.882079 | volume=14 | title=The role of academics in Turkey's politics: the Mülkiye Junta and the transformation of the Republican People's Party | year=2014 | journal=Southeast European and Black Sea Studies | pages=109–128 | last1 = Emre | first1 = Yunus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masters and Doctorate programs were implemented in the 1955-56 academic year. In 1982, the faculty adopted the new framework, increasing the number of specialization departments to six: International Relations, Political Science and Public Administration, Economics, Public Finance, Business Administration, Labor Economics and Industrial Relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.ankara.edu.tr/english/index.php SBF - Departments]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2008-2009 academic year, Foreign Language Preparatory School has been mandatory.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Staff and Alumni==
The faculty currently has 172 academic staff (42 professors, 33 associate professors, 34 assistant professors, 18 research assistants with doctorates, 35 research assistants pursuing doctorate degrees, four lecturers and six experts) and 78 administrative staff.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The faculty's alumni, who are also called Mülkìyelìler, are employed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, Public Finance and in public institutions including banks and private companies. A number of alumni have served as prime ministers, ministers, deputies, ambassadors, and governors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=Mülkiye-8211-an-elite-school-or-a-school-for-elites-2009-12-28 Hurriyet Daily News - Mülkiye; an elite school or a school for elites?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mülkiyeliler Birliği, the faculty's Alumni Association is a non-governmental organization with branches across the country. It organizes variety of courses, seminars, symposiums and exhibitions. It also publishes magazines and books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://Mülkiye.org.tr/ Mülkiyeliler Birliği]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education Facilities==
The faculty has several teaching facilities to meet the needs of various courses and departments. In addition to the two amphis, the faculty has a 450-seat conference hall, several large classrooms, seminar rooms, multipurpose rooms and computer centers.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

For all departments, English language preparation classes have been mandatory since 2008-2009. In addition, foreign language courses are available. Since the 1992-1993 academic year, language courses covering the departmental terminology have been given as electives.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The library specializes in the field of social sciences. There are 108,000 Turkish and foreign language books. The library has a collection of 46,000 domestic and overseas periodicals and newspaper collections of historical value. The library has a 300-seat reading room, as well as the "Hande Mumcu Reading Room" for periodicals and the "Ali Cankaya Room" with tapes and CD-ROMs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.ankara.edu.tr/english/index.php?bil=bil_icerik&amp;icerik_id=281&amp;menu=0&amp;ens_birim=0 SBF - Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The faculty has published the Journal of Political Science (SBF Dergisi) four times a year since 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.ankara.edu.tr/english/?bil=bil_sbfdergisi SBFJournal]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and Housing Facilities==
In addition to a canteen (Coffee Mülkiye) and two tea centers, there is a dining room which provides service to faculty, academic and administrative staff.

Although there are many student dormitories at the University of Ankara, they are not sufficient to accommodate all students. To compensate this shortcoming, there are many private and state dormitories in Ankara which give housing services to students.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The faculty offers a wide range of social and sporting activities including theater, cinema, art, music and dance ensembles, plus over 30 communities of thought.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The faculty's basketball team, Mülkiyespor, which is supported by Alumni, competes in the secondary league.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Traditional Cow Festival==
One of the most colorful aspects of social life in the faculty is the traditional cow festival organized once a year since the 1930s, prior to final exams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.wix.com/ugd/74930a_c192ac9f76dd43b29d6bd529b1c78e61.pdf Pınar Karataş - "The Cow Feast in Mülkiye: Its Characteristics of Ritual and Role in Mülkiyeli Identity Formation"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Cow Festival ({{lang-tr|İnek Bayramı}}) is the famous celebration when the top student in a given class is forced to parade the streets on a cow – a play on words since “cow” is slang for nerd in Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=Mülkiye-8211-an-elite-school-or-a-school-for-elites-2009-12-28 Hurriyet Daily News - Mülkiye; an elite school or a school for elites?]&lt;/ref&gt; It is organized by a Festival Organization Committee (Feskom) elected from third and fourth year students. Faculty members, students and alumni join in the opening ceremony, reading the prayer of that year together. A "reading cow sculpture" was built in front of the faculty by the Festival Organization Committee 2000.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

'''Higher education in Afghanistan''' outlines government policies to reform higher education at Afghan universities and the impact of these reforms. The term [[higher education]] is a synonym for post-secondary education, third stage, third level or tertiary education.  

== Context of reform ==
Higher education was one of the eight pillars of the ''Afghan National Development Strategy'' for 2008–2014. In December 2009, the Afghan [[Ministry of Higher Education (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Higher Education]] launched the ''National Higher Education Strategic Plan: 2010''–''2014''. Its two main goals were to improve quality and broaden access to higher education, with an emphasis on gender equity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=578–580|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Higher Education Review for 2012: an Update on the Current State of Implementation of the National Higher Education Strategic Plan: 2010-2014|last=Ministry of Higher Education|first=|publisher=Government of Afghanistan|year=2013|isbn=|location=Kabul|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Higher Education Strategy|last=Ministry of Higher Education|first=|publisher=Government of Afghanistan|year=2010|isbn=|location=Kabul|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the most striking responses to the destruction of the higher education system has been the effort spelled out in the Afghan Ministry of Higher Education’s (MoHE) National Higher Education Strategic Plan: 2010–2014 (MoHE 2009c) to not only rebuild the system that remained in 2001, but
also transform it into a modern, merit-based system that is once again one of the best in South Asia, as had been the case before the Russian invasion, as well as one that meets international standards, making it competitive with other systems in the region.&lt;ref&gt; Babury, M. Osman; Fred, M. Hayward (2014). Afghanistan Higher Education: The Struggle for Quality, Merit, and Transformation, Planning for Higher Education Journal, SCUP, v. 42. no.2&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''National Higher Education Strategic Plan: 2010''–''2014'' was the outcome of a series of consultation workshops with Afghan universities undertaken by the Ministry of Higher Education in 2009 with support from [[UNESCO]] and the [[World Bank]]. The ''National Higher Education Strategic Plan: 2010''–''2014'' built on an earlier framework for the reform of higher education developed by the Ministry of Higher Education with the support of UNESCO's International Institute for Educational Planning in 2004. The earlier reform had covered a wide spectrum, including the institutional structure of universities, questions of governance, recruitment and retention of staff and students, the relationship between teaching and research, management, finance and the procurement of equipment, land and textbooks.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001899/189958e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report 2010: the Current Status of Science around the World|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2010|isbn=978-92-3-104132-7|location=Paris|pages=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial issues ==
According to the ''National Higher Education Strategic Plan: 2010''–''2014,'' higher education was to represent 20% of the country’s education budget by 2015, equivalent to US$800 per student by 2014 and US$1 000 by 2015. The approved budget for 2012 for higher education was US$47.1 million, equivalent to US$471 per student. By 2014, only 15% (US$84.13 million) of the US$564 million in funding requested of donors by the Ministry of Higher Education had materialized since 2010. The main donors were the [[World Bank]], [[United States Agency for International Development|USAid,]] the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]], [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], India, France and Germany.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Enrollment trends ==
The Ministry of Higher Education has largely surpassed its target for raising university enrollment, which doubled between 2011 and 2014 to 153,314. The government had tabled on the number of students doubling to 115,000 by 2015. A shortfall in funding has prevented the construction of facilities from keeping pace with the rapid rise in student rolls, however. Many facilities also still need upgrading; there were no functioning laboratories for physics students at Kabul University in 2013, for instance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to a progress report by the Ministry of Higher Education, the number of women students tripled between 2008 and 2014 to 30,467, yet women still represented just one in five university students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Part of the growth in university student rolls can be attributed to ‘night school’, which extends access to workers and young mothers. Having a ‘night shift’ for students also makes use of limited space that would otherwise be vacant in the evenings. The night shift is proving increasingly popular, with 16,198 students enrolling in 2014, compared to just 6,616 two years earlier. Women represented 12% (1,952) of those attending evening classes in 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Gender strategy ==
Within its ''Higher Education Gender Strategy'' (2013), the Ministry of Higher Education has developed an action plan to augment the number of women students and faculty. A pillar of this plan is the construction of women’s dormitories. With help from the US State Department, one was completed in Herat in 2014 and another two are planned for Balkh and Kabul. They should house about 1,200 women in total. The ministry also requested funds from the National Priority Programme budget for the construction of ten additional dormitories for 4,000 women students; six of these were completed in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Higher Education Gender Strategy|last=Ministry of Higher Education|first=|publisher=Government of Afghanistan|year=2013|isbn=|location=Kabul|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the targets outlined in the ''Higher Education Gender Strategy'' (2013), women were to represent 25% of university students by 2014 and 30% by 2015. By 2014, they accounted for 19.9% of students, down from 20.5% in 2010.  Female enrolment has accelerated since 2010 but male enrolment has progressed faster. Girls still encounter more difficulties than boys in completing their schooling and are penalized by the lack of university dormitories for women. In 2012, there was a net intake of 66% of girls and 89% of boys at the level of primary education. Boys could expect to complete 11 years of schooling and girls seven.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://en.unesco.org/gem-report/report/2015/education-all-2000-2015-achievements-and-challenges|title=Education for All Global Monitoring Report, 2000-2015: Achievements and Challenges|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 2014, 117 women (23% of the total) were pursuing a master's degree at Afghan universities, compared to 508 men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The ''Higher Education Gender Strategy'' fixes a target for women to make up 20% of faculty members by 2015. By October 2014, 690 faculty members were women (14%). The ''Strategy'' also advocates increasing the number of women faculty who hold a master's degree or a PhD. By October 2014, 203 women held a master's degree, compared to 1,277 men, and 10 women a PhD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Quality of higher education ==
By 2014, the Curriculum Commission established by the Ministry of Higher Education had approved the curricular reviews and upgrades for one-third of Afghanistan’s public and private faculties. Progress in meeting recruitment goals has also been steady, since staffing is covered by the regular budget allocations. One of the ministry’s priorities has been to increase the number of master’s programmes. This will broaden opportunities for women, in particular, given the difficulties they face in going abroad for master’s and PhD training. For instance, half of the students enrolled in the two new master’s programmes in education and public administration in 2013 were women. Five of the eight master's degrees granted by Kabul University between 2007 and 2012 were also obtained by women. By 2015, a total of 25 master's programmes were available.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2008, 5.2% of the 2,526 faculty members at Afghan universities held a PhD, 30.1% a master's degree and 63.8% a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; One priority of the Ministry of Education has been to increase the share of faculty and augment the number of those who hold a master's degree or PhD. The wider choice of academic programmes has enabled more faculty to obtain a master's degree but doctoral students still need to study abroad, in order to increase the small pool of PhDs in Afghanistan. The share of master’s and PhD-holders has dropped in recent years, as the number of faculty members at Afghan universities has risen; the drop in the share of PhD-holders from 5.2% to 3.8% between 2008 and 2014 was also due to a wave of retirement. By October 2014, there were 5,006 faculty members. Some 1,480 of them held a master's degree (29.6% of the total) and 192 a PhD (3.8%). A further 625 faculty were expected to graduate with a master's degree by December 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Two schemes enable faculty to study abroad. Between 2005 and 2013, 235 faculty members completed their master's degree abroad, thanks to the World Bank’s Strengthening Higher Education Programme. In 2013 and 2014, the Ministry of Higher Education’s development budget funded the study abroad of 884 faculty working towards their master's degree and 37 faculty enrolled in doctoral programmes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Afghan students may apply for a scholarship to complete their master's degree or PhD at the [[South Asian University]] in India, which offers subsidized tuition fees to all students from the member countries of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]]. In February 2016, the Afghan Students Alumni ran a Seminar at Avicenna University in Kabul on Academic Opportunities for MA and PhD Programmes at the South Asian University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.sau.ac.in/seminar-on-academic-opportunities-for-ma-and-phd-programmes-in-south-asian-university-sau/|title=Seminar on Academic Opportunities for MA and PhD Programmes in South Asian University (SAU)|last=Zubair Yousufi|first=Ahmad|date=1 March 2016|work=South Asian University website|access-date=24 May 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grants to revive the research culture ==
In order to revive Afghanistan’s research culture, research units have been installed at 12 universities as part of the World Bank’s Higher Education Systems Improvement Project.  These are  Kabul University, Kabul Polytechnic University, Herat University, Nangarhar University, Balkh University, Kandahar University, Kabul Education University, Albiruni University, Khost University, Takhar University, Bamyan University and Jawzjan University. In parallel, the Ministry of Higher Education developed a digital library in 2011 and 2012 which provides all faculty, students and staff with access to about 9,000 academic journals and 7,000 e-books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Participation in research is now a requirement for the promotion of faculty at every level. In the first round of competitive bidding in 2012, research grants were approved for projects proposed by faculty members from Kabul University, Bamyan University and Kabul Education University. Projects concerned the use of IT in learning and research; challenges of the new middle school mathematics curriculum; the effect of automobile pollution on grapevines; integrated management of nutrients in wheat varieties; traditional ways of blending concrete; and the effect of different methods of collecting sperm from bulls. The research committee established at each of the 12 universities approved nine research proposals in 2013 and a further 12 in 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Ministry of Higher Education has been working with the Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand to develop joint educational programmes. As part of this collaboration, 12 university faculty members were seconded to the institute in 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Work began on drafting a national research policy in 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Towards greater financial autonomy for universities ==
A major goal of the Ministry of Higher Education is to grant some financial autonomy to universities, which as of 2015 were not entitled to charge tuition fees or keep any income. The ministry cites a World Bank study from 2005 of Pakistan, which repealed similar restrictive legislation about a decade ago. ‘Now, Pakistani universities, on average, earn 49% of their budget (with some as high as 60%) from income they raise and gifts,’ observes the ministry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The aim of the reform is to foster entrepreneurship, university–industry ties and the universities’ capacity to provide services. The ministry has prepared a proposal which would allow higher education institutions to keep funds that they earn from entrepreneurial activities, such as drugs analysis done by the Faculty of Pharmacy at Kabul University for the Ministry of Public Health. They would also be able to keep income from night courses and donations from benefactors and alumni. In addition, they would be entitled to set up foundations which could accumulate funds for major projects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The ministry’s position was vindicated by the outcome of a pilot project implemented in 2012 which gave universities in Kabul greater authority over procurement and expenditure below a certain financial threshold. The ministry’s plans have been put on hold, however, by the failure of parliament to pass the Higher Education Law, which was approved by the Education Committee in 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Research output ==
Afghan scientists produced just 1.4 publication per million inhabitants in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded), the lowest ratio in South Asia. The world average was 176 per million. However, the number of Afghan articles catalogued in this international database increased from seven to 44 between 2005 and 2014. Some 96.5% of articles produced between 2008 and 2014 had a foreign co-author. Most partners were based in the USA (97 articles), followed by the United Kingdom (52), Pakistan (29), Egypt and Japan (26 each). Afghan articles were the most highly cited of any country in South Asia, with 9.7% of them featuring among the 10% most cited articles worldwide, compared to a G20 average of 10.2%. A high citation rate is common for countries producing a very small volume of scientific publications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Of the publications produced by Afghan scientists between 2008 and 2014, 114 (59%) of those catalogued in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science concerned medical sciences and 33 biological sciences. Ten articles concerned agriculture, five chemistry and two engineering.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2628">{{Unreferenced|date=March 2007}}'''Islamic University of Technology''' ([[Islamic University of Technology|IUT]]) was first known as '''Islamic Center for Technical and Vocational Training''' '''(ICTVTR)'''. It was the time of its birth in the year 1978. The 9th [[Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers]] '''(ICFM)''' held in [[Dakar]], Republic of [[Senegal]] on 24–28 April 1978. The establishment of IUT in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] was then approved by the then foreign ministers. All the members of the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC) agreed to cooperate for the implementation of the project.

==Development==
[[Image: Five Fundamentals Gate, Islamic University of Technology.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Five Fundamentals Gate]]
The implementation of the establishment commenced with the holding of the first meeting of the Board of Governors in June, 1979.
*Foundation stone of ICTVTR was laid by the late President [[Ziaur Rahman]] of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh on March 27, 1981 in the presence of [[Yasser Arafat|Yasir Arafat]], the then chairman of the [[PLO]], and [[Habib Chatty]], the then [[Secretary General]] of OIC.
*ICTVTR was formally inaugurated by [[H.M. Ershad]], the then president of Peoples Republic of Bangladesh on July 14, 1988.
*The 22nd [[ICFM]] held in [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]] on 10–11 December 1994 renamed the ICTVTR as Islamic Institute of Technology (IIT).
IIT was formally inaugurated by [[Begum Khaleda Zia]] the then Prime Minister of Bangladesh on 21 September 1995.
*The 28th ICFM held in [[Bamako]], Republic of [[Mali]] on 25–29 June 2001 commended the efforts of IIT and decided to rename the IIT as Islamic University of Technology (IUT).
IUT was formally inaugurated by Begum Khaleda Zia Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh on '''November 29, 2001.

==Advancement==
The University has advanced much in a short time and still infrastructure is going on by availing the financing under loan from [[Islamic Development Bank]] (IDB) with guarantee provided by the Government of Bangladesh.

University started offering long regular courses from December 1986 and completed 24 academic years until 2010. The 24th Convocation was held at the IUT auditorium on 2 November 2010. Her Excellency Begum [[Sheikh Hasina]], Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh was the Chief Guest on the occasion.

The '''interactive acculturation model''' ('''IAM''') seeks to integrate within a common theoretical framework the following components of [[immigrants]] and host community relations in [[multicultural]] settings:
# [[acculturation]] orientations adopted by immigrant groups in the host community;
# acculturation orientations adopted by the host community towards special groups of immigrants;
# interpersonal and intergroup relational outcomes that are the product of combinations of immigrant and host community acculturation orientations.
The framework of these established among a structural political/governmental environment. Ultimately, the goal of the model is to present a [[indeterminism|non-determinist]], more dynamic account of immigrant and host [[community acculturation]] in multicultural settings.&lt;ref&gt;Bourhuis et al., 1996.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially the model takes both sides of immigration (host and immigrant) and compares the values and desire to hold on to historical and cultural ties of the immigrant population versus the desire or degree to which the host population is willing to accommodate the immigrant influx. Examples of questions posed to the host population include:
# Do you find it acceptable that immigrants maintain their cultural [[Cultural heritage|heritage]]?
# Do you accept that immigrants adopt the culture of your host community?
The model derives two important pieces of data:
# the level to which the immigrant population is willing maintain its historical and cultural roots against;
# its desire (or lack thereof) to integrate and adopt the history and cultural traits of the host society.
The model essentially categorizes the population, based on the responses, as being in favor of [[social integration|integration]], [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], or separation. When cross compared with the level of accommodation the host society is willing to provide, the model predicts whether the immigrant population will become fully assimilated, marginalized, or even isolated from the host society.&lt;ref name="Bourhis 377"&gt;Bourhis 377.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|It is unclear which entry this is in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State attitudes to immigration and acculturation==
In the past, [[acculturation]] has been described in both a macro level where there is emphasis on processes and effects on [[populations]] and at a micro level where it describes the [[psychological]] effect on individuals. Bourhis et al., reference the earlier work of both Graves and Berry&lt;ref&gt;Berry, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; in the identification of individual psychological change that the immigrant experiences during their integration into a host culture. These changes are observed in the individual who is influenced by the new culture as well as participating and interacting within the new culture. To further understand the social and psychological effects of immigrant acculturation, the Bourhis team starts their model with an analysis of structural policies that address immigration, particularly in host nations.

===State policies===

The Bourhis et al. article delineates first the [[ideologies]] that make up the basis of the policies that are present in the host state. The study very much accepts the notion that these policies are very influential in the dynamics and the eventual [[acculturation]] process that goes on by the host and immigrant people. The Bourhis team categorized the host nation policies in the manner of Breton&lt;ref name="Breton, 1988"&gt;Breton, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; into state immigration policies that spell out quantities, type and origin of allowed immigrants, conditions and rules and then go on further to define the living rules that immigrants must live by in the host country such as work permits, ability to naturalize, etc. In addition we also have identified state integration policies that addressed mechanisms to help immigrants with joining into the host culture as well as measures to aid in host country acceptance of immigrants. These two types of policies may be symbiotic or at odds with each other in terms of goals and focus. The Bourhis team was primarily concerned with Western countries and noticed that in these nations, the policies, research, implementation and responsibility for both immigration and integration often resided in one sole governmental agency. This agency was often chartered with duties of writing statues, enforcing [[immigration]] laws and very possibly may be the governmental focus for assimilation and [[social integration|integration]] policy. Based on international conventions and referencing previous work by Kaplan,&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; sovereign countries possess the right and responsibility to define the limits and scope of nationality. Each country is presumed to have the right to decide who is a national and what does it take to be a national of that nation. Nations will derive their immigration policies based on a multitude of factors but in the context of state and national attitudes toward the [[immigrant populations]]. These policies define not only numbers and bureaucratic processes but also address the illegal immigration and the methods of countering it. As with all state policy, the laws enacted reflect both the majority host nation attitudes as well as help form these attitudes. The Bourhis model is premised on the adaptation of four groupings for state policies.&lt;ref name="Breton, 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drieger, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helly, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The state integration policies are not exclusive and permanent to a particular host country. The ideologies exist as a combination of the state policies and the surrounding public support that it is deemed were the basis of these policies. The state policies are usually not codified into constitutional form and are modified over time to reflect the changing circumstances and attitudes of both the people and the government. The following are described by Bourhis in the explanation of the IAM:

===Pluralist ideologies===

A construct based on the idea that the host nation expects immigrant populations to adhere and adopt host nation public values such as democracy and individual freedom but are free to maintain individual and native cultural values as long as they are within the wide confines and boundaries of host laws (native language use is OK but [[polygamy]] would not be acceptable). The policies adopted by the state would reflect a positive view of immigrants maintaining their diverse cultures and would support these differences not only socially but possibly financially. It is this last detail of financial support or government enactment of positive policy that differentiates this from a more civic ideology and state policy. Some Scandinavian countries as well as other western democracies have at times leaned this way to encourage cultural diversity and set acculturation as a state goal.

===Civic ideologies===

These policies would also maintain the premise that immigrants adopt host nation public values and that individual values are not to be dictated or regulated by the host government. But in [[civic ideologies]], there is no public financial support for these private values or for the continuation and flourishing of the particular culture. The cultural identities and values are allowed but not promoted by the host nation in a government policy of non-intervention. Many European countries and various Latin American countries espouse a civic ideology to some extent. These countries often witness flourishing immigrant populations that maintain a cultural identity and sometimes language.

===Assimilation ideology===

These are the set of beliefs and policies that support both the adoption of public values by the immigrant population but also of some private values of host nation dominant culture. We would expect these policies to dictate such aspects like a single language in the schools and encourage voluntary (sometimes mandatory) cultural integration at all levels to homogenize the expressions of the immigrant population with that of the host nation. This could not only be voluntary but encouraged or mandated and expected to happen over time. The US had essentially assimilation policies until the great influx of immigrants during the last half of the past century at which time the country has softened its attitudes and policies toward a more civic ideology. A variant to the assimilation ideology is the [[Republican ideology]] similar to that expressed in France as far back as the revolution that supposes a "[[universal man]]" that is able to suppress less desired, backward, cultural traits and require a "leveling out" in order to fully participate as an equal in the society.

===Ethnist ideology===

This is basically the idea that the state can mandate the whole of public and private values and make them a precondition to full [[citizenship]]. It occasionally is manifested in the mandatory taking of host country values as necessary by the immigrant populations or more often this ideology is expressed in a requirement to be part of an ethnicity, religion or race to be accepted as a citizen. Governments may enact blood relations requirement or parentage to conditions for citizenship. Witness countries like Switzerland, Israel and Japan where immigrants are not accepted as they lack the ethnic blood to become full members of the citizenry and can only be allowed a lesser status such as guest worker or second class citizen.

==Immigrant population attitudes==
The attitudes of immigrant populations that shape their acculturation and level of assimilation into the host society vary widely. One attitude in particular that has been explored is the concept of [[biculturalism]]. Under Gordon's (1964) proposal, he identifies a unidimensional model of acculturation that immigrant groups undergo over time as they strive to maintain equilibrium between their own culture/heritage against those of their adoptive host state. This equilibrium is essentially biculturalism, where the immigrant population retains features of their heritage culture while adopting key elements of the host’s culture. Biculturalism is transitory however,&lt;ref&gt;Goldlust, Richmond, 1974.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaFromboise, Coleman, &amp; Gerton, 19993.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over time, the immigrant population eventually assimilates into the culture of the host nation and becomes a "rightful member" of the majority, to fit into the existing social structure of the host society.&lt;ref&gt;Woldemikael, 1987. &lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===

Critics of the unidimensional model cite the influx of technologically and culturally advanced European powers into less developed societies into the new world that in essence assimilated the host society. The unidimensional model fails to account for the fact that the host majority is also changed by the presence of culturally distinctive immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Taft, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bidimensional model of acculturation===

Efforts to explain further acculturation and assimilation among immigrant populations led to the formulation of the Bidimensional model of acculturation. Under this model, more importance is placed in viewing the importance immigrant populations identify with the aspects of their own culture.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berry, 1980.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Berry’s model of acculturation, immigrant’s attitudes are described as being focused on two points; 1) "Is it considered to be of value to maintain cultural identity and characteristics?" and 2) "Is it considered to be of value to maintain relationships with other groups?"

Various studies among Portuguese, Hungarian, Korean, and Lebanese immigrant in Canada and Indian Immigrants in the US found that the majority of these groups desired "integration" versus marginalization.&lt;ref name="Bourhis 377"/&gt; Further results off the study would go on to show that these groups who desired integration suffered less from "acculturation stress" than others. According to Berry,&lt;ref&gt;Berry, 1990b&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fact that integration was the most widely preferred mode of acculturation in his studies suggests that pluralism [where a state expects immigrants will adopt the public values of the host country (democratic ideals and [[Penal code|criminal codes]]) but has mandate defining private value s] may constitute the ideology that best reflects the orientation of many [[first-generation immigrant]]s in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Bourhis 373.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|It is unclear which entry this is in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can thus be argued that immigrants desire to hold on to elements of their own culture but also assimilate aspects of their host culture, thus becoming "integrated" into their host society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4820">An '''intern architect''' or '''architectural intern''' is a person who is working professionally in the field of architecture in preparation for registration or licensure as an [[architect]]. An intern need not have attained a [[professional degree]] in architecture to begin accruing experience hours, but said degree is a prerequisite for licensure.

In the United States, Canada, and other countries, an intern architect is enrolled in a regulated program, such as the [[Intern Development Program]] (IDP) in the United States or the [[Intern Architect Program]] (IAP) in Canada, while working under the supervision of a licensed architect and preparing for professional registration exams.

The use of the title "architect" (or any derivation thereof) is legally protected in the United States, Canada, and other countries. Most U.S. states and all Canadian provinces, however, allow the use of the terms "intern architect" or "architectural intern" for a person enrolled in an architectural internship program.

==Intern Development Program (United States)==
{{Main|Intern Development Program}}
The Intern Development Program (IDP) is a national program, developed and administered by [[NCARB]], in the United States designed to provide structured training for Intern Architects to ensure that they are exposed to most aspects of the architectural profession prior to attaining professional licensure.

A candidate works under the tutelage of one or more architects as mentor(s) on a regular basis.  Additionally, the intern architect selects a sponsor, who is an architect who does not work for the firm where the intern is employed.  Together, the mentor and the sponsor work with the intern to make sure that the intern is actively working towards satisfying the requirements of the IDP program.

The program prescribes the minimum experience hours required in various activities pertaining to practice in architecture before attaining professional licensure.  Interns track these hours using experience reports that are verified and confirmed by their mentor.  These activities fall into four categories: Pre-Design, Design, Project Management, and Practice Management, each of which includes tasks that architects will perform as part of their professional responsibilities.  In total, interns must complete 5600 hours of reported experience before attaining professional licensure. In most states Interns may begin taking the [[Architect Registration Examination]] (ARE) while they are participating in the Intern Development Program, but will not attain professional licensure before successful completion of both the ARE and IDP.

===History===
The IDP was created jointly in the 1970s by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB) and the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) and is administered by NCARB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncarb.org/idp/index.html IDP Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024025948/http://www.ncarb.org/idp/index.html |date=2008-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intern Architect Program (Canada)==
{{Main|Intern Architect Program}}
The Intern Architect Program (IAP) is a national program in Canada that documents and evaluates internship activities, provides structure to the transition between education and registration, and encourages involvement of practitioners in the development of new architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

It is open to the public and its resources can be used for free on site. In addition, the Center hosts business and social events in its historic reading room. The library is part of the civic legacy of Mr. James J. Hill.

The James J. Hill Center was completed after his death and funded by his widow, Mary T. Hill, and children Mary Hill, Rachel Hill Boeckmann, Clara Hill Lindley, Louis W. Hill, and Charlotte Hill Slade. &lt;ref&gt;http://jjhill.org/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt; It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975.

[[File:Priestley.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Priestley by [[Ellen Sharples]] (1794)&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, ''Iconography'', 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Joseph Priestley]] ({{OldStyleDate|24 March|1733|13 March}} &amp;ndash; 8 February 1804) was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[natural philosopher]], [[English dissenters|Dissenting]] [[clergyman]], [[Political philosophy|political theorist]], and [[theologian]]. While his achievements in all of these areas are renowned, he was also dedicated to improving education in Britain; he did this on an individual level and through his support of the [[Dissenting academies]]. His [[grammar]] textbook was innovative and highly influential. More importantly, though, Priestley introduced a [[liberal arts]] curriculum at [[Warrington Academy]], arguing that a practical education would be more useful to students than a classical one. He was also the first to advocate the study and teaching of [[Historiography#Modern historiography|modern history]], an interest driven by his belief that humanity was improving and could bring about [[Millennialism|Christ's Millennium]].

==Personal and institutional teaching==
Priestley was a teacher in one way or another throughout his entire adult life. Once he discovered how much he enjoyed teaching, he consistently returned to this calling. At the school he established in [[Nantwich]], [[Cheshire]], he taught a wide range of topics to the town's children: [[Latin]] (and perhaps Greek), [[History of geography#Marco Polo to the 18th century|geography]], [[mathematics]], and [[English grammar]]. Unusually for the time, he also taught [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 77-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of this school, he was offered the position of tutor of modern languages and rhetoric at [[Warrington Academy]]. In later years, when he lived in [[Leeds]] and [[Birmingham]], he created classes for the youth of his parishes; in Birmingham his three classes totaled 150 students and he helped organize the New Meeting [[Sunday school]]s for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 242-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having received an excellent education at Daventry, a [[Dissenting academies|Dissenting academy]], and convinced that education was the key to shaping people and the world's future, Priestley continued to support the Dissenting academies throughout his life. For example, he advised the founders of [[New College at Hackney]] on its curriculum and preached a charity sermon on the "proper Objects of Education" to help raise money for the school. After emigrating to America in 1794, Priestley continued the educational projects that had always been important to him. He attempted to find funding for the Northumberland Academy and donated his library to it, but the academy did not open until 1813 and closed soon after. He communicated with [[Thomas Jefferson]] regarding the proper organization of a university and when Jefferson founded the [[University of Virginia]], it was Priestley's curricular principles that dominated the school. Jefferson also passed Priestley's advice on to [[James Madison (Episcopal Bishop)|Bishop James Madison]], whose [[College of William &amp; Mary]] also followed Priestley's maxims.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 339-343.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wherever Priestley went, he also instructed people in [[natural philosophy]]. In Nantwich, he bought scientific instruments, such as a [[microscope]], for the school, and encouraged his students to give public presentations of their experiments. In [[Calne]], where he was a tutor to the son of [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]], Priestley convinced his patron to buy expensive equipment with which to teach his son the fundamentals of natural philosophy. He wrote in his ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]'' (1778), published during these years, that children should not only be educated in the ancient subjects of rhetoric and grammar but should also become acquainted with science early in their lives since scientific understanding underpins the progress of the human race.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 14; Schofield, Vol. 2, 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Priestley moved to Birmingham in 1780, he encouraged the town's children to play with his apparatus and ask questions about his laboratory: the Priestley home became a place of scientific education for the town's children. Priestley's rain gauge and "perambulator" (a wheelbarrow for recording distances) delighted them. The boys often played with his air-gun, aiming at a wig of Priestley's which he had fastened to a post. Priestley designed [[magic lantern]] shows for them and shocked them with his electrical machine.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 245-6; Gibbs, 140; Uglow, 319-20; 407; Jackson, 227-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational philosophy==
In 1765, Priestley dedicated his ''[[Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life]]'' (1765),&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life]]''. London: Printed for C. Henderson under the Royal Exchange; T. Becket and De Hondt in the Strand; and by J. Johnson and Davenport, in Pater-Noster-Row, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; to the governing board of Warrington Academy. In it he argues that young people's education should anticipate their practical needs, something he accused the current universities, Dissenting and Establishment alike, of failing to do. In Priestley's eyes, the contemporary focus on a traditional [[classics|classical education]] prevented students from acquiring useful skills. This principle of utility guided his unusual curricular recommendations. He proposed that students study English and the modern languages instead of the classical languages, learn practical mathematics, read modern rather than ancient history, and study the constitution and laws of England. He believed that these topics would prepare his students for the commercial middle-class life that most of them would live; he did not believe that the poor should receive this same education, arguing "it could be of no service to their country, and often a real detriment to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1766 Warrington Academy replaced its old classical curriculum with Priestley's new [[liberal arts]] model.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, 52-4; Schofield, Vol. 1, 124-5; Watts, 95-7; Sheps, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars of education have argued that this work and his later ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]'' (1778) (often reprinted with the ''Essay on Education'')&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]. More especially, as it respects the conduct of the mind''. Bath: Printed by R. Cruttwell; London: J. Johnson, 1778.&lt;/ref&gt; made Priestley the "most considerable English writer on educational philosophy" between [[John Locke]] and [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 121; see also Watts, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
[[File:PriestleyGrammar.png|left|upright|thumb|Title page from the first edition of Priestley's ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar|Rudiments]]'' (1761)]]
Priestley's first successful educational venture was the establishment of a local school in [[Nantwich]]. Believing that all students should have a good grasp of the [[English language]] and its [[Grammar#History|grammar]] before learning any other language and dismayed at the quality of the instruction manuals available, Priestley wrote his own textbook: ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar]]'' (1761).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar]]; adapted to the use of schools. With observations on style''. London: Printed for R. Griffiths, 1761.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was very successful—it was reprinted for over fifty years. Its humor may have contributed to its popularity; for example, Priestley illustrated the ''[[couplet]]'' with this rhyme:

::Beneath this stone my wife doth lie:
::She's now at rest, and so am I.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Jackson, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley also quoted from the most famous English authors, encouraging the middle-class association between reading and pleasure, a reading that would also, Priestley hoped, foster morality. Priestley's innovations in the teaching and description of English grammar, particularly his efforts to disassociate it from Latin grammar, made his textbook revolutionary and have led twentieth-century scholars to describe him as "one of the great grammarians of his time."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Schofield, Vol. 1, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rudiments'' influenced all of the major grammarians of the late eighteenth century: [[Robert Lowth]], [[James Harris (grammarian)|James Harris]], [[John Horne Tooke]] and even the American [[Noah Webster]]. The resounding success of Priestley's book was one of the reasons that [[Warrington Academy]] offered him a teaching position in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 83-5; 99-100; Jackson, 52; Gibbs, 16; Watts, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Priestley's philosophy was founded on the fervent belief that a thorough understanding of history was necessary not only to worldly success but also to spiritual growth.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 135; 149.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "my view was, not merely to make history intelligible to persons who may choose to read it for amusement, but .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. to facilitate its subserviency to the highest uses to which it can be applied: to contribute to its forming the able statesman and the intelligent and useful citizen."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in McLachlan, 253.&lt;/ref&gt; His abiding interest in history, particularly [[Historiography#Modern historiography|modern history]], sets Priestley apart from his contemporaries. Priestley was the first person to advocate the serious study of modern history; no other British university was teaching the subject at the time and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] would not begin until 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Warrington Academy, Priestley gave a series of lectures on history and government; in 1788 he finally published them as ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]''. Need first edition publication information.&lt;/ref&gt; They cover a wide array of topics—"forms of government, the feudal system, the rise of corporations, law, agriculture, commerce, the arts, finance and taxation, colonies, manners, population, war and peace"—demonstrating how all-encompassing Priestley believed the study of history to be.&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; In this text, he narrates a version of history in which all events are "an exhibition of the ways of God;" studying history and nature, according to Priestley, "leads us to the knowledge of his perfections and of his will."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in McLachlan, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding history thus allows one to comprehend the natural laws God established and the perfection towards which they allow the world to tend. This [[Millennialism|millennial]] outlook is tied together with Priestley's belief in scientific progress and the improvement of the human race. Priestley maintained that each age improves upon the previous one and studying history allows people to see and participate in that progress.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Essay on the First Principles of Government]]'' (1768) he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Highly as we think of the ''wisdom of our ancestors'' we justly think of ourselves, of the present age, wiser and . . . must see that we can . . . improve upon institutions that have been transmitted to us. Let us not doubt but that every generation in posterity will be as much superior to us in political, and all kinds of knowledge, and that they will be able to improve upon the best civil and religious institutions that we can prescribe for them. [Priestley's emphasis]&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This millennial conception of history was in direct contrast to the two dominant historical paradigms of the time: [[Edward Gibbon|Edward Gibbon's]] decline narrative found in his ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' and [[David Hume|David Hume's]] cyclical narrative found in his ''[[History of England (Hume)|History of England]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Gibbon and Hume, Priestley did not limit himself to narrating a version of history in these ''Lectures''; he also presented a method for historical research and was one of the first to argue for the primacy of original documents in the study of history. He also contended that much could be learned from "material evidence" of former civilizations, such as "ancient coins, medals and inscriptions," as well as "exchequer rolls, public and private ledger books, letters, diaries, monetary, financial and exchange systems, systems of fortifications and city plans . . . [in addition to] ballads and works of fiction."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 254-5; McLachlan, 256; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was well received and was employed by many educational institutions, such as the Dissenting academy at Hackney,&lt;!-- Is New College at Hackney the same as [[Homerton College, Cambridge]]? --&gt; [[Brown University|Brown]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 259; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory underpinning Priestley's [[millennialism|millennial]] view of history and his educational philosophy, was [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley's]] theory of association. Hartley's [[Association of Ideas|associationism]], an expansion of [[John Locke|John Locke's]] theories in ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) and laid out in ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749), postulated that the human mind operated according to natural laws and that the most important law for the formation of the self was "associationism." For Hartley, associationism was a physical process: vibrations in the physical world traveled through the nerves attached to people's sense organs and ended up in their brains. The brain connected the vibrations of whatever sensory input it was receiving with whatever feelings or ideas that the brain was simultaneously "thinking." These "associations" were impossible to avoid, formed as they were simply by experiencing the world; they were also the foundation of a person's character. Locke famously warns against letting "a foolish maid" convince a child that "goblins and sprites" are associated with the darkness, for "darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. Ed. [[Roger Woolhouse]]. New York: Penguin Books (1997), 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Associationism provided the scientific basis for Priestley's belief that man is "perfectible" and served as the foundation for all of his pedagogical innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 87; 93; Sheps, 137-9; 147-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Priestley viewed education as one of the primary forces shaping a person's character as well as the basis of morality, he, unusually for his time, promoted the education of women. Alluding to the language of Locke's ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', he wrote: "certainly, the minds of women are capable of the same improvement, and the same furniture, as those of men."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Watts, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that if women were to care for children and be intellectually stimulating companions for their husbands, they had to be well-educated. Although Priestley advocated education for middle-class women, he did not extend this logic to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charts of biography and history===
[[File:PriestleyChart.gif|thumb|right|A redacted version of Priestley's ''Chart of Biography'' (1765)]]
As a supplement to his lectures on history, Priestley also designed and published ''[[A Chart of Biography]]'' (1765)&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[A Chart of Biography]]''. London: J. Johnson, St. Paul's Church Yard, 1765 and Joseph Priestley, ''A description of a chart of biography''. [Warrington] : Printed at Warrington, 1764; ''A Description of a Chart of Biography''. Warrington: Printed by William Eyres, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''New Chart of History'' (1769) (which he dedicated to [[Benjamin Franklin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[A New Chart of History]]''. London: Engraved and published for J. Johnson, 1769; ''A Description of a New Chart of History''. London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1770.&lt;/ref&gt; These charts and their accompanying ''Descriptions'' would allow students, Priestley said, to "trace out distinctly the dependence of events to distribute them into such periods and divisions as shall lay the whole claim of past transactions in a just and orderly manner."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 141-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chart of Biography'' covers a vast timespan, from 1200 BC to 1800 AD, and includes two thousand names. Priestley organized his list into six categories: Statesman and Warriors; Divines and Metaphysicians; Mathematicians and Physicians (natural philosophers were placed here); Poets and Artists; Orators and Critics (prose fiction authors were placed here); and Historians and Antiquarians (lawyers were placed here). Priestley's "principle of selection" was fame, not merit; therefore, as he mentions, the chart is a reflection of current opinion. He also wanted to ensure that his readers would recognize the entires on the chart. Priestley had difficulty assigning his all of his people to individual categories; he attempted to list them in the category under which their most important work had been done. [[Machiavelli]] is therefore listed as a historian rather than a statesman and [[Cicero]] is listed as a statesman instead of an orator. The chart was also arranged in order of importance; "statesmen are placed on the lower margin, where they are easier to see, because they are the names most familiar to readers."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 253; Sheps, 142-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chart of History'' lists events in 106 separate locations; it illustrates Priestley's belief that the entire world's history was significant, a relatively new development in the eighteenth century, which had begun with [[Voltaire]] and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]. The world's history is divided up into the following geographical categories: Scandinavia, Poland, Russia, Great Britain, Spain, France, Italy, Turkey in Europe, Turkey in Asia, Germany, Persia, India, China, Africa and America. Priestley aimed to show the history of empires and the passing of power; the subtitle of the ''Description'' that accompanied the chart was "A View of the Principle Revolutions of Empire that have taken place in the World" and he wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The capital use [of the ''Charts'' was as] a most excellent mechanical help to the knowledge of history, impressing the imagination indelibly with a just image of the rise, progress, extent, duration, and contemporary state of all the considerable empires that have ever existed in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As Arthur Sheps in his article about the ''Charts'' explains, "the horizontal line conveys an idea of the duration of fame, influence, power and domination. A vertical reading conveys an impression of the contemporaneity of ideas, events and people. The number or density of entries . . . tells us about the vitality of any age."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Voids in the chart indicated intellectual Dark Ages, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Charts'' were popular for decades—the ''[[A New Chart of History]]'' went through fifteen editions by 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the [[University of Edinburgh]] to grant him a [[Doctor of Laws|Doctor of Law degree]] in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 118-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious education==
[[File:PriestleyInstitutes.png|left|thumb|upright|Title page from the second edition of ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]'']]
Priestley pondered what form the best religious education would take throughout his life. In the 1760s, when he was a student at [[Daventry Academy]], he imbibed the pedagogical principles of its founder, [[Philip Doddridge]]; although he was dead, Doddridge's emphasis on academic rigor and freedom of thought lived on at the school and impressed Priestley. These ideals would always be a part of Priestley's educational programs. He began writing one of these while still at Daventry, the ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]''. Need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he did not publish the work until 1772, when he was at [[Leeds]]. In an effort to increase and stabilize membership at his church there, he taught three religious education classes. He subdivided the young people of the congregation into three categories: young men from 18-30 to whom he taught "the elements of natural and revealed religion" (young women may or may not be included in this group); children under 14 to whom he taught "the first elements of religious knowledge by way of a short catechism in the plainest and most familiar language possible"; and "an intermediate class" to whom he taught "knowledge of the Scriptures only."&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 170; Gibbs, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the later [[Sunday school]]s established by [[Robert Raikes]], Priestley aimed his classes at middle-class Rational Dissenters; he wanted to teach them "the principles of natural religion and the evidences and doctrine of revelation in a regular and systematic course," something their parents could not provide.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley wrote texts for the courses he envisioned: ''A Catechism for Children and Young Persons'' (1767), which went through eleven English-language editions;&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A catechism for children, and young persons''. Need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Scripture Catechism, consisting of a Series of Questions, with References to the Scriptures instead of Answers'' (1772), which went through six British editions by 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A scripture catechism, consisting of a series of questions, with references to the scriptures instead of answers''. need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt; He aimed to write non-sectarian ''Catechisms'', but in this he failed. He offended many orthodox readers by focusing on God's benevolence instead of on Adam's sin and Christ's atonement. Priestley implemented this same system of religious instruction over a decade later in [[Birmingham]], when he became a minister at New Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 170-1; Gibbs, 37; Watts, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Brien was the leader of the [[Catholic Church in Scotland]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1582371/Cardinal-Keith-OBrien-condemns-Gordon-Brown-over-monstrous-embryo-Bill.html Cardinal O'Brien, the church's leader in Scotland], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 18 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holyrood.com/content/view/530/10524/ He was the leader of Scotland’s 800,000 or so Catholics], Interview – Cardinal Keith O'Brien, ''[[Holyrood Magazine]]'', 8 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and had been the head of its [[Bishops' Conference of Scotland|conference of bishops]] until he stepped down as archbishop in February 2013.

On 20 March 2015, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] announced that though he remained a member of the [[College of Cardinals]] O'Brien would not exercise his rights or duties as a cardinal, in particular voting in [[papal conclaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11486525/Pope-Francis-strips-disgraced-Cardinal-Keith-OBrien-of-privileges-but-not-title.html|title=Pope Francis strips disgraced Cardinal Keith O’Brien of privileges but not title|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien died after a fall on 19 March 2018, two days after his 80th birthday.

==Early life and education==
O’Brien was born at [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]], in [[County Antrim]], Northern Ireland, on 17 March 1938. After [[primary education]] in Ballycastle, his family moved to Scotland where his father was serving with the [[Royal Navy]] at [[Faslane]]. O'Brien initially attended St Stephen's Primary School, [[Dalmuir]] before continuing to [[secondary school]] at [[Our Lady &amp; St Patrick's High School|St Patrick's High School]], [[Dumbarton]]. His family then moved to [[Edinburgh]], where he completed his secondary education at [[Holy Cross Academy]].

O'Brien studied at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he gained a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[chemistry]] in 1959 (and later a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education|Diploma in Education]] in 1966). His studies for the priesthood were at [[St Andrew's College, Drygrange]], [[Roxburghshire]], and he was ordained priest on 3 April 1965 by his predecessor, Cardinal [[Gordon Gray (cardinal)|Gordon Gray]]. Initially, serving as curate at Holy Cross, Edinburgh from 1965 until 1966, he completed his teacher training certificate at [[Moray House College of Education]]. From 1966 to 1971, he was employed by [[Fife]] County Council as a teacher of mathematics and science; he also served as chaplain to St Columba's Secondary School, initially in [[Cowdenbeath]] and then in [[Dunfermline]], while assisting at St Bride's Parish, Cowdenbeath.

O'Brien was then moved to full-time parish apostolate in St Patrick's, [[Kilsyth]] from 1972 until 1975 and then St Mary's, [[Bathgate]] from 1975 until 1978. He served as spiritual director to the students at St Andrew's College, Drygrange from 1978 until 1980 then as Rector of [[Blairs College|St Mary's College, Blairs]], the junior seminary near [[Aberdeen]], from 1980 until 1985.

==Archbishop and cardinal==
O’Brien was nominated Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh on 30 May 1985 and was consecrated by Cardinal Gray, then [[Archbishop Emeritus]] of St Andrews and Edinburgh, at St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh on 5 August 1985. [[Pope John Paul II]] created him [[Cardinal-Priest]] of [[Santi Gioacchino ed Anna al Tuscolano|Ss Joachim and Anne ad Tusculanum]] on 21 October 2003.

O'Brien was made Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] in 2005, appointed Grand Prior of the Scottish Lieutenancy of the [[Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem]] in 2001 and appointed Knight Grand Cross (KGCHS) of that order in 2003.

In 2004 O'Brien was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from [[St Francis Xavier University]], Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada, an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from the [[University of St Andrews]], and an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from the [[University of Edinburgh]].  In 2015 there were calls for the honorary degree from St Andrews University to be revoked due to [[#Sexual misconduct and consequences|admission of sexual impropriety]]. Professor Manfredi La Manna wrote, "I, for one, would not recognise as a colleague someone who admitted abusing his position of power for sexual gratification with subordinates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/pope-revokes-rights-of-cardinal-keith-o-brien-1-3723826|title=Pope revokes rights of Cardinal Keith O’Brien|website=Scotsman.com|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-34223035|title=Cardinal's degree will not be revoked|date=11 September 2015|accessdate=6 October 2017|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The University decided against this noting, "(...) that revocation cannot change or ameliorate the wrongs of the past and that, notwithstanding the very real hurt and loss caused by the actions of the honorand, it would be no more than an empty gesture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/homenews/13715186.St_Andrews_University__Keith_O_Brien_will_keep_his_honorary_degree/|title=St Andrews University: Keith O'Brien will keep his honorary degree|website=HeraldScotland|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Brien was Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Argyll and the Isles from 1996 to 1999, when Bishop Ian Murray took over the diocese. O'Brien took part in the [[Papal conclave, 2005|2005 Papal Conclave]] which elected [[Pope Benedict XVI]]. In anticipation of the 2010 visit of Pope Benedict to England and Scotland, O'Brien and [[Vincent Nichols]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Westminster|Archbishop of Westminster]], said that the crisis involving [[Seán Brady]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]], over the priest [[Brendan Smyth (priest)|Brendan Smyth]] and other clerical abuse charges is one for the Irish Catholic Church and should not overshadow Benedict's visit. O'Brien and Nichols were asked whether the pope would respond to charges made against the church about [[Catholic sex abuse cases|clerical sex abuse]] during his four-day visit, the first papal visit to the UK since John Paul II in 1982.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} O'Brien said he did not know; Nichols said English, Welsh and Scottish bishops had "robust" rules in place to protect children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0317/1224266442376.html|title=Crisis will not overshadow UK visit by Pope Benedict, say church leaders|work=The Irish Times|date=3 March 2010|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Campaigners for victims of abuse want an investigation of the way O'Brien dealt with all allegations of abuse while he was leader due to O'Brien's [[#Sexual misconduct and consequences|sexual misconduct admission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9918880/Scottish-priests-out-of-control-sexually-says-former-abuse-adviser.html|title=Scottish priests 'out of control sexually', says former abuse adviser|first=John|last=Bingham|date=8 March 2013|accessdate=6 October 2017|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mario Conti]], Archbishop emeritus of Glasgow, said all the Scottish Catholic bishops except O'Brien cooperated over an independent inquiry into the handling of child abuse in Scotland between 1952 and 2012 with the results to be published.  The inquiry was delayed because O'Brien and only O'Brien withdrew cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/latest-news/5603 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 August 2013 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827063149/http://www.thetablet.co.uk/latest-news/5603|archivedate=27 August 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When O'Brien announced on 25 February 2013 that Pope Benedict had accepted his resignation as archbishop, he said he would not exercise his right to participate in the [[papal conclave, 2013|conclave in March]] to elect Benedict's successor.&lt;ref name="resignationtext"/&gt; On 20 March 2015, Pope Francis accepted O'Brien's renunciation of all duties as cardinal, an event extremely rare in Church history. Though he remained a cardinal until his death in 2018, he no longer participated in any public, religious or civil events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-accepts-disgraced-scottish-prelates-resignation-from-cardinal-status-87693/|title=Pope accepts disgraced Scottish prelate's resignation from cardinal status|work=Catholic News Agency|date=20 March 2015|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curial appointments===
After his creation as cardinal, O'Brien was appointed a member of the [[Pontifical Council for Social Communications]] and also a member of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People. He was President of the Bishops' Conference of Scotland and fulfilled various engagements at the request of other members of the Conference. He was sometimes referred to as the "[[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of Scotland",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2009-03-27a.556.0 "In his speech on his ten-minute Bill, he mentioned that Cardinal O'Brien, the Primate of Scotland, had made a public statement..."], [[Evan Harris]] MP, [[Oxford West &amp; Abingdon]], [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]], 27 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; however this title or position has never existed.

===Resignation as archbishop===
O'Brien tendered his resignation from the governance of the Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh to the [[Pope]] some time in 2012, in view of his 75th birthday in March 2013; the Pope accepted it ''[[nunc pro tunc]]'' on 13 November 2012 and decided it would become effective on 25 February 2013. He remained a cardinal.&lt;ref name="resignationtext"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21575931|title=Cardinal Keith O'Brien resignation: Statement in full|newspaper=BBC News|date=25 February 2013|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement of his resignation followed allegations initially in ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper that O'Brien had engaged in [[#Sexual misconduct and consequences|inappropriate sexual conduct]] with junior clergy. The Pope appointed [[Philip Tartaglia]] as temporary apostolic administrator in O'Brien's place. In July, [[Leo Cushley]], a priest from [[Motherwell]], was named to succeed O’Brien as archbishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rome-based Scot replaces disgraced Cardinal O'Brien|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-23432423|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual misconduct and consequences==&lt;!--This heading linked from 3 places within article--&gt;
In 2013 allegations became public that O'Brien had engaged in inappropriate, sometimes predatory sexual activity from the 1980s to 2003.

===Accusations and admission===
[[File:O'Brien resignation, St, Bennet's, Greenhill.JPG|thumb|[[Reporter]]s outside St Bennets, O'Brien's [[Edinburgh]] residence, on the day he resigned]]
On 23 February 2013 ''[[The Observer]]'' reported that O'Brien had been accused of inappropriate sexual behaviour involving four men (three serving priests, and one former priest) within the Diocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh dating back to the 1980s.&lt;ref name="The Observer 23 02 2013"&gt;{{cite news|author=Catherine Deveney|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/23/cardinal-keith-o-brien-accused-inappropriate|title=UK's top cardinal accused of 'inappropriate acts' by priests|work=The Guardian|accessdate=24 February 2013|location=London|date=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former priest resigned the priesthood when O’Brien became a bishop and stated, "I knew then he would always have power over me. (…) I left to preserve my integrity."&lt;ref name=CatherineDeveney/&gt;  It was reported that one complainant needed long term counselling due to the actions of O'Brien.&lt;ref name=Zaimov&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/britains-top-cleric-cardinal-keith-obrien-resigns-following-inappropriate-behavior-accusations-90719/ |title=Britain's Top Cleric Cardinal Keith O'Brien Resigns Following 'Inappropriate Behavior' Accusations |publisher=Christianpost.com |date=25 February 2013 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the four, referred to only as "Priest C", alleges that the degree of control a superior has over subordinate priests made it hard for him to refuse O'Brien's demands. "He [the bishop above a priest] has immense power over you. He can move you, freeze you out, bring you into the fold&amp;nbsp;... he controls every aspect of your life."&lt;ref name=CatherineDeveney&gt;{{cite news|author=Catherine Deveney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/23/cardinal-keith-o-brien-accused-inappropriate |title=UK's top cardinal accused of 'inappropriate acts' by priests |work=The Guardian |date= 23 February 2013|accessdate=14 June 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complaint demanding O'Brien's immediate resignation was lodged with the Vatican's ambassador to the United Kingdom and there were efforts to silence at least one critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21646348 |title=Cardinal O'Brien complainant 'warned' of risk of damage to Church |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=3 March 2013 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Brien initially contested the allegations. According to the [[BBC]], a source within the church said that O'Brien "doesn't know who his accusers are and doesn't know what they're accusing him of".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21584820|title=Cardinal 'upset' over resignation|date=26 February 2013|accessdate=6 October 2017|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 February 2013 he did not attend a special service to celebrate the eight-year tenure of Pope Benedict XVI at St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh. It was widely reported that he had asked for legal advice and been advised not to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21563345|title=Cardinal Keith O'Brien 'accused of inappropriate acts'|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February 2013 it was announced that O'Brien's previously submitted resignation as archbishop would take effect that same day and a temporary apostolic administrator was appointed in his place. O'Brien said that he would not participate in the [[Papal conclave, 2013|oncoming conclave]],&lt;ref name="bbcresignation"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21572724|title=Cardinal Keith O'Brien resigns as Archbishop|newspaper=BBC News|date=25 February 2013|accessdate=25 February 2013|author=Pigott, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; although entitled to do so. O'Brien then made no further public appearance until early May 2013.

On 3 March 2013, the Scottish Catholic Media Office released a statement from O'Brien in which he said "I ... admit that there have been times that my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop and cardinal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmo.org/articles/statement-from-cardinal-obrien.html |title=Statement from Cardinal O'Brien |publisher=Scmo.org |date=3 March 2013 |accessdate=14 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508143824/http://www.scmo.org/articles/statement-from-cardinal-obrien.html |archivedate= 8 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/03/cardinal-keith-obrien-admits-sexual-misconduct Cardinal Keith O'Brien admits and apologises for sexual misconduct] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He said he intended to retire permanently from the public life of the church.&lt;ref name=huff43/&gt; Archbishop [[Philip Tartaglia]], temporary successor to O'Brien, said the "credibility and moral authority" of the church had been damaged.&lt;ref name=huff43&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/03/04/cardinal-keith-obrien-sex-scandal-catholic-church-scotland_n_2807423.html |title=Cardinal Keith O'Brien Sex Scandal 'A Serious Blow' To Catholic Church In Scotland |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.uk |date= |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in March 2013 a former priest announced his intention to sue O'Brien, saying O'Brien had [[Groping|groped]] and kissed him as a 19-year-old [[seminarian]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Simon |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/9931979/Cardinal-Keith-OBrien-being-sued-by-alleged-abuse-victim.html |title=Cardinal Keith O'Brien being sued by alleged abuse victim |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=15 March 2013 |accessdate=14 June 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Brien was further accused of trying to grope a priest in 2003 in Rome at a drinks party to celebrate his becoming a cardinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bingham |first=John |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9934881/Cardinal-Keith-OBrien-accused-of-sex-assault-while-in-office-as-Cardinal.html |title=Cardinal Keith O'Brien accused of sex assault while in office as Cardinal |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=16 March 2013 |accessdate=14 June 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also alleged that O'Brien had been in a long-term physical relationship with one of the complainants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/cardinal-was-in-physical-relationship-with-accuser.20550591|title=Cardinal was in physical relationship with accuser|date=21 March 2013|work=Herald Scotland|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed that O'Brien remained sexually active until 2009 at least.&lt;ref name="Scotsman23/03/2014"/&gt;

O'Brien faced allegations of a “culture of cronyism” within his archdiocese&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/blogs/571/17 |title=Does Cardinal O'Brien deserve banishment or pardon?

In 2015 ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Glasgow Herald]]'' reported allegations that in at least 40 cases young clerics were encouraged to let O'Brien hear their [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confessions]], and the religious act was used for sexual grooming.  It was claimed as common knowledge that O'Brien was gay, but there was allegedly reluctance to accept O'Brien's actions as a [[sexual predator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13207559.Disgraced_Cardinal_Keith_O_Brien_facing_fresh_accusations_of_sexual_misconduct/|title=Disgraced Cardinal Keith O'Brien facing fresh accusations of sexual misconduct|website=HeraldScotland|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims of O'Brien's sexual abuse felt unable to complain because within the church only a pope has ever been able to discipline a cardinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/18/catholic-church-in-scotland-must-support-abuse-survivors-review-says|title=Catholic church in Scotland asks forgiveness from child abuse victims|first=Severin Carrell Scotland|last=editor|date=18 August 2015|accessdate=6 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After publication of the [[McLellan Report]] in 2015 [[Andrew McLellan]] said the church's treatment of O'Brien showed that secrecy is still an "important part of the atmosphere" within the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/catholic-church-apologises-to-victims-of-abuse-1-3861440|title=Catholic Church apologises to victims of abuse|website=Scotsman.com|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecclesiastical response===
On 27 April 2013 ''[[The Scotsman]]'' reported that Cardinal [[Marc Ouellet]] would head an investigation into O'Brien, and that appointment of Scottish bishops had been halted until the inquiry was completed.&lt;ref name=Scotsman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/cardinal-o-brien-scandal-no-to-new-scots-bishops-1-2912079 |title=Cardinal O'Brien scandal: No to new Scots bishops |publisher=Scotsman.com |date=27 April 2013 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicted another report suggesting that the Vatican would not hold a formal investigation or publish any formal report because "The Church doesn't work that way."&lt;ref name=McGinty&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen McGinty|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/no-vatican-action-expected-on-cardinal-o-brien-1-2912345 |title=No Vatican action expected on Cardinal O'Brien |publisher=Scotsman.com |date=28 April 2013 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   No decision had been made to demote or [[laicization|laicise]] O'Brien.&lt;ref name=Scotsman/&gt;&lt;ref name=McGinty/&gt;

O'Brien returned to Scotland and attempted to settle in the church-owned cottage he had planned as his retirement home in [[Dunbar]], East Lothian. One of his accusers, a former [[seminarian]], stated, "Keith O'Brien is giving the impression he wants a nice peaceful little retirement now.

The Vatican stated on 15 May 2013 that O'Brien "will be leaving Scotland for several months for the purpose of spiritual renewal, prayer and penance" and "Any decision regarding future arrangements for His Eminence [Cardinal Keith O'Brien] shall be agreed with the Holy See."&lt;ref  name=vatsaid&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=22553 |title=Independent Catholic News, Vatican statement on Cardinal Keith O'Brien, 15 May 2013 |publisher=Indcatholicnews.com |date=15 May 2013 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of O'Brien objected to the church requiring O'Brien to leave Scotland; Canon John Creanor threatened legal action to prevent O'Brien's "forced [[exile]]", and said he had a legal team ready.  [[Richard Holloway]], former [[Bishop of Edinburgh]] of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], said that forcing O'Brien into [[Freedom of movement|exile from Scotland would breach international law]]. Holloway likened O'Brien's forced exile to the tactics of "[[extraordinary rendition]]" (extrajudicial transfer) of the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rosemary Goring |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/columnists/cardinals-victims-need-all-our-sympathy.21126761 |title=The Herald (Scotland): Cardinal's victims need all our sympathy, 20 May 2013 |publisher=Heraldscotland.com |date=20 May 2013 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four complainants said that O'Brien needed psychological counselling rather than prayer and penance. One accusing priest said, "Keith is extremely [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and needs help to be challenged out of his [[denial#Types|denial]]. If he does not receive treatment, I believe he is still a danger to himself and to others." The four accusers believed there was a smokescreen, with the full story untold, and wanted an investigation to reveal the extent of O'Brien's actions.&lt;ref Name="Devenney18/05/2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Catherine Deveney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/18/cardinal-obrien-still-danger-say-accusers |title=Cardinal Keith O'Brien still a danger, say abuse accusers |publisher=Guardian |date= 18 May 2013|accessdate=14 June 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the scandal, the Catholic Church in Scotland failed to act. {{As of|2013|7}} O'Brien was still Britain's most senior Catholic. According to the director of communications of the Catholic media office (which was largely unavailable for official comment), Peter Kearney, only Rome could handle the O'Brien affair; nobody in Scotland had authority to challenge a cardinal.&lt;ref name=Deveney0518&gt;{{cite news|author=Catherine Deveney| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/18/cardinal-banished-church-denial|title=Catherine Deveney writing in The Observer: Three months on, a cardinal is banished but his church is still in denial|website=Theguardian|date= 18 May 2013|accessdate=14 June 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Catherine Deveney writing in The Observer, Archbishop Tartaglia who was temporary leader of St Andrews and Edinburgh following O'Brien's resignation, failed to confront the issue, and behind the scenes "church insiders" were critical; one told her that "He is completely lacking in leadership qualities". Kearney told the Observer there could be no Scottish investigation because the nuncio had rightly not identified the complainants. But he had; Kearney apparently didn't know that [[Joseph Toal]], [[Bishop of Argyll and the Isles (Catholic)|bishop of Argyll and the Isles]], had been given names and asked to be a contact point.&lt;ref name=Deveney0518/&gt;

Deveney said that this issue is no longer about personal failure, but systemic failure, and reports that theologian [[Werner Jeanrond]] said "As a church, we have failed to come to terms with homosexuality. The highest clerical representative of the church is himself a victim of the system which didn't allow him to own his homosexuality." She adds that there are many other scandals involving Scottish clergy, including at least one bishop; misdeeds include sexual misconduct, heavy drinking, payoffs to cover scandals and serious abuse, and says that "O'Brien knows where the bodies lie. And the hierarchy knows he knows." She says that this issue is not about Scottish clergy, but is worldwide.&lt;ref name=Deveney0518/&gt;

In July 2013 O'Brien was reported to be in a monastery in Europe or an enclosed abbey in the English [[The Midlands|Midlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marshall |first=Chris |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/cardinal-keith-o-brien-successor-to-be-named-1-3011018 |title=New Archbishop Cushley promises ‘reconcilliation’ - Top stories |publisher=The Scotsman |date=24 July 2013 |accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Severin Carrell and Lizzy Davies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/24/vatican-appoints-leo-cushley-archbishop-edinburgh |title=Vatican appoints replacement for disgraced Cardinal Keith O'Brien &amp;#124; UK news |publisher=theguardian.com |date=24 July 2013 |accessdate=7 August 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013 there was a report that O'Brien would face no further punishment, which disappointed alleged victims and victims' groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/vatican-finished-with-cardinal-keith-o-brien-1-3199974 |title=Vatican ‘finished with Cardinal Keith O’Brien’ |publisher=Scotsman.com |date=23 November 2013 |accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apostolic visitation====
After some delay, it was reported in The Observer on 23 June 2013 that the Vatican had decided to hold an [[apostolic visitation]].  This is a formal high-level inspection into the affair, in which the "visitator" is given authority directly by the pope.  In this case the visitator was archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh, who had not yet been appointed at the time.  Papal nuncio [[Antonio Mennini]] told one of the complainants, a former priest known as "Lenny", of the decision. Anyone affected would be able to give evidence; if there was considered to be sufficient evidence, a deeper process would take place in Rome. Lenny was relieved that the facts would finally be examined, but said that the visitation also had to examine "whether any promotions were awarded to the cardinal’s cronies".&lt;ref name="Scotsman 24/6/13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

According to the article, senior figures in Rome said the visitation would also deal with the more general accusations of moral failings in the church in Scotland.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|author=Catherine Deveney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/23/vatican-obrien-sex-abuse-claims-inquiry |title=Vatican agrees to inquiry into Cardinal O'Brien's sexual conduct &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= 23 June 2013|accessdate=23 June 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was criticism of the choice of O'Brien's successor as Archbishop of Edinburgh as visitator; [[Thomas P. Doyle|Tom Doyle]], a canon lawyer who had worked at the nunciature in Washington and later represented Catholic abuse victims all over the world, said that the whole point was for someone from outside to investigate, and that the choice of O'Brien's successor would make the church  "look like fools". Doyle said that dealing with a previous case, widespread  child abuse in Ireland, by an apostolic visitation had been a "total farce", and that only totally independent investigations have elicited significant truth in similar cases, as with (non-ecclesiastical) [[grand jury|grand juries]] in the United States and government [[statutory authority|statutory commissions]] in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Scotsman 24/6/13"&gt;{{cite web|author=Victoria Raimes|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/top-stories/vatican-to-launch-cardinal-keith-o-brien-probe-1-2973987 |title=Vatican to launch Cardinal Keith O’Brien probe |publisher=Scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

The complainants have been negotiating with Archbishop [[Leo Cushley#Keith O'Brien|Leo Cushley]] but have also appealed to [[Pope Francis]]. They would like an investigation into the way the diocese was governed, the manner of O'Brien's appointment, whether close associates were appointed to positions of power and also the extent of O'Brien's predatory behaviour. Cushley promised to hand over the requests personally but discouraged public discussion of the case.&lt;ref name="Deveney01/13/2014"&gt;{{cite web|author=Catherine Deveney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/01/cardinal-keith-o-brien-accusers-justice-pope-francis |title=Cardinal Keith O'Brien's accusers take fight for justice to the pope |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During O'Brien's lifetime a Canonical trial remained possible but unlikely.&lt;ref name="Scotsman23/03/2014"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/disgraced-keith-o-brien-faces-vatican-trial-1-3316333 |title=Disgraced Keith O’Brien faces Vatican ‘trial’ |publisher=Scotsman.com |date=23 February 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Lenny" claims the finances of the  Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh under O'Brien are being investigated internally to find if there were irregularities.

O'Brien had since January 2014 been living, initially incognito, in a home provided by the Catholic Church &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/03/keith-obrien-stripped-of-the-rank-of-cardinal-an-extraordinary-disgrace-for-the-scottish-church/|title=Keith O’Brien stripped of the rank of cardinal – an extraordinary disgrace for the Scottish Church - Coffee House|date=20 March 2015|website=Blogs.spectator.co.uk|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the village of [[Ellington, Northumberland|Ellington]], [[Northumberland]], fifty miles south of the Scottish border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/revealed-sex-shame-cardinal-keith-3867102|title=Revealed: Sex shame cardinal Keith O'Brien enjoying retirement in £208k Northumberland bungalow provided by Catholic Church|first=Keith|last=McLeod|date=16 July 2014|website=Dailyrecord.co.uk|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Brien later moved to Newcastle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/19/cardinal-keith-obrien-disgraced-catholic-church-leader-dies Cardinal Keith O'Brien, disgraced Catholic church leader, dies] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Scicluna]] investigated O'Brien in April 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/04/vatican-bishop-investigates-sexual-allegations-cardinal-keith-obrien|title=Vatican to investigate sexual allegations against Cardinal Keith O'Brien|first=Lizzy|last=Davies|date=4 April 2014|accessdate=6 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such an investigation of a cardinal appears unprecedented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/news/accountability/disgraced-cardinals-archdiocese-subject-vatican-investigation|title=Disgraced cardinal's archdiocese subject of Vatican investigation|date=4 April 2014|website=Ncronline.com|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are concerns that the report, allegedly "hot enough to burn the varnish" from the Pope's desk, remains unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/blogs/1/601/report-into-cardinal-o-brien-should-be-published|title=Report into Cardinal O'Brien should be published|website=Thetablet.co.uk|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Scicluna's apostolic visitation, the Holy See announced on 20 March 2015 that Pope Francis had "accept[ed] the resignation of Cardinal Keith Patrick O’Brien from the rights and duties of a Cardinal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url = http://www.scmo.org/articles/church-welcomes-pope-francis’-decision-to-accept-cardinal-o’brien’s-resignation.html | publisher = Scottish Catholic Media Office | archive-date= 26 September 2015 | dead-url = yes| title =Church welcomes Pope Francis’ decision to accept Cardinal O’Brien’s resignation| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150926213953/http://www.scmo.org/articles/church-welcomes-pope-francis%E2%80%99-decision-to-accept-cardinal-o%E2%80%99brien%E2%80%99s-resignation.html |date=26 September 2015 | accessdate = 9 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen Jr.|first1=John L.|title=In rare step, Scottish prelate caught in sex scandal quits as cardinal|url=http://www.cruxnow.com/church/2015/03/20/in-rare-step-scottish-prelate-caught-in-sex-scandal-quits-as-cardinal/|accessdate=20 March 2015|work=Crux|date=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement for the Catholic Church in Scotland confirmed that O'Brien would continue to live outside Scotland until such time as his age and infirmity required that situation to be reviewed. He retained the title of Cardinal, but did not any longer carry out the functions of a cardinal and was only allowed to wear a cardinal's robes in private.  According to the [[Holy See Press Office]] O'Brien would not take part in papal elections, act as papal adviser, or take part in Vatican congregations and councils and loses other roles of a cardinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/news/global/pope-francis-accepts-scotland-cardinals-decision-renounce-duties-rights-office|title=Pope Francis accepts Scotland cardinal's decision to renounce duties, rights of office|date=20 March 2015|website=Ncronline.com|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist David Gibson wrote that "Those developments, [Scicluna's unpublished report, the home bought for O'Brien, that O'Brien was not officially punished] plus the fact that O'Brien can keep the title of cardinal&amp;nbsp;... may also keep the issue on the boil rather than cooling it off."&lt;ref name=DavidGibson&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/scandal-scarred-cardinal-keith-obrien-renounces-rights-and-privileges-of-his-office/2015/03/20/5dfac2a2-cf1e-11e4-8730-4f473416e759_story.html|title=Scandal-scarred Cardinal Keith O'Brien renounces 'rights and privileges' of his office|last=Gibson|first=David|date=20 March 2015|accessdate=6 October 2017|newspaper=The Washington Post|agency=Religion News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecclesiastical historian Christopher Bellitto said, "What's odd, in this papacy especially, is that O'Brien loses the power, but not the pomp,&amp;nbsp;... a red hat is still a red hat, even if there is no punch behind it."&lt;ref name=DavidGibson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A similar situation also occurred when the late former Cardinal of the [[Archdiocese of Vienna]], in Vienna, Austria, [[Hans Hermann Groër]], who was found to have abused many, was asked by [[Pope John Paul II]] to relinquish his duties as archbishop and cardinal; he denied the allegations until his death.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests]] is concerned that the transparency Pope Francis promised is absent and the cardinal's wrong or abusive actions have been kept secret.  There is further concern that other clerics failed to disclose abuse by O'Brien which they reasonably should have known or suspected. Abusive bishops have resigned in the past, but action against complicit clerics and bishops who conceal abuse would be a helpful innovation because it would help prevent further abuse and concealment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/03/20/cardinal-steps-down-over-sexual-impropriety-allegations-a-first-for-a-cardinal-since-1927/|title=Cardinal steps down over sexual impropriety allegations, a first since 1927|first=Michelle|last=Boorstein|date=20 March 2015|accessdate=6 October 2017|website=Washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and death==
O'Brien said, while criticising a parliamentary bill on embryology in 2008, that he carried an [[organ donor]] card.&lt;ref name=yt/&gt; O'Brien suffered from heart problems and was fitted with a [[pacemaker]] after complaining of dizzy spells and fainting prior to [[Passion Sunday|Passion Sunday Mass]] in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7315421.stm|title=Scotland: Cardinal O'Brien gets pacemaker|publisher=BBC News|date=26 March 2008|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he announced that he would not attend the 2013 conclave he said "Approaching the age of 75 and at times in indifferent health, I tendered my resignation as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh to Pope Benedict XVI some months ago."&lt;ref name="resignationtext"/&gt;

O'Brien died after a fall on 19 March 2018, two days after his 80th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work= BBC News |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-43455753 | accessdate= 20 June 2018 | date= 19 March 2018 | title= Cardinal Keith O'Brien dies after fall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
O'Brien was often forthright in his political and spiritual views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6707465.stm|title=Scotland: The 'Cardinal of Controversy'|publisher=BBC News|date=31 May 2007|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, at the [[Synod of Bishops (Catholic)|European Synod of Bishops]], O'Brien declared who he saw fit to be the next Archbishop of [[Westminster]], following the death of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Basil Hume|Hume]]. He named his candidate, [[Timothy Radcliffe]], Master General of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] order ([[Black Friars]]). At the synod, Radcliffe had made an appeal to O'Brien, saying that there was a crisis of authority going in the church, but the answer could not be ''more'' emphasis on authority. In the presence of the Pope, Radcliffe went on: the church should not only speak ''about'' the poor, the divorced people, women who had had abortions, homosexuals, but should also take at heart ''their'' experiences, eat their bread, take what they had to offer. "They'll blame us being associated with the wrong people but we have a good precedent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trouw.nl/krantenarchief/2001/07/03/2365391/Een_kwajongenspassie_voor_de_waarheid.html|title=archiveDay|language=nl|work=Trouw|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secularism===
In 2011 he criticised "aggressive secularism" denouncing what he claimed was the way Christians had been prevented from acting in accordance with their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13179851 | title=Cardinal Keith O'Brien criticises secularism | publisher=BBC | date=24 April 2011 | accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien said aggressive secularism threatened the Christian heritage and he wanted religion to remain in the public sphere.  Specifically legislation requiring Christians to tolerate homosexuality was a type of [[secularism]] O'Brien opposed, and he called on Christians of all [[Christian denomination|denominations]] to unite in combating secularism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Referring to equality legislation which prevents discrimination against homosexuals, he [O'Brien] said Christians faced being sidelined in British society because they were not willing to publicly endorse lifestyles that run contrary to their belief system.&lt;ref name=Herald2011&gt;{{cite web|author=Caroline Wilson |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/cardinal-on-attack-over-secularism.13422707 |title=Cardinal on attack over secularism |publisher=Heraldscotland.com |date=25 April 2011 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;His [O'Brien's Easter 2011] homily included instances where Christians had fallen foul of equality legislation, preventing discrimination against gay people, and swiftly drew fire from groups campaigning against religious privilege in public life.&lt;ref name=Butt&gt;{{cite news|author=Riazat Butt|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/24/cardinal-keith-obrien-aggressive-secularity |title=Cardinal Keith O'Brien warns of threat from 'aggressive secularism' |publisher=Guardian |date= 24 April 2011|accessdate=14 June 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Evan Harris]] of the [[National Secular Society]] and the [[British Humanist Association]] called O'Brien's statements  "paranoid and unjustified".&lt;ref name=Herald2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Butt/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2011&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13179851 |title=Cardinal Keith O'Brien criticises secularism |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=24 April 2011 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homosexuality===
Before becoming a cardinal, O'Brien had been regarded as "liberal" on the issue of [[homosexuality]], noting the significant number of homosexual priests ministering within the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;''The Telegraph'', October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; However, in December 2004 he told [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|members of the Scottish Parliament]] that homosexuals were "captives of sexual aberrations", comparing homosexuals to prisoners in [[Edinburgh (HM Prison)|Saughton jail]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/28862.aspx?r=4552&amp;i=34249 |title=Official Report Debate Contributions - Parliamentary Business : Scottish Parliament |publisher=Scottish.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later referred to homosexuality as a "moral degradation".&lt;ref name=Masters/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gerry Braiden |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/cardinal-was-in-physical-relationship-with-accuser.20550591#.UUr9rjhjYWg.gmail |title=Cardinal was in physical relationship with accuser |publisher=Heraldscotland.com |date=21 March 2013 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; But O'Brien did rebuke Bishop [[Joseph Devine]] in 2005 who had suggested that homosexuals should not be allowed to teach in Catholic schools commenting, "I don't have a problem with the personal life of a person as long as they are not flaunting their sexuality."&lt;ref&gt;''The Scotsman'', 28 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006 he criticised [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] over the introduction of [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnerships]] in the UK, and [[Scottish Parliament|Holyrood]] members over the liberalisation of [[divorce laws in Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4571190.stm Cardinal in family life broadside], [[BBC]], 1 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2006 he opposed proposals to change the law which would require Catholic adoption agencies to place children with homosexuals in the same way as with heterosexuals, calling them [[totalitarian]].&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Times, 24 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, O'Brien reiterated the Catholic Church's continued opposition to civil partnerships and suggested that there should be no laws that "facilitate" same-sex relationships, saying that
{{quote|The empirical evidence is clear, same-sex relationships are demonstrably harmful to the medical, emotional and spiritual well being of those involved, no compassionate society should ever enact legislation to facilitate or promote such relationships, we have failed those who struggle with same-sex attraction and wider society by our actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sconews.co.uk/latest-edition/14858/scotland-fails-homosexual-people|title=Scotland fails homosexual people|publisher=SCO News|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2012, O'Brien criticised in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' government proposals to introduce [[same-sex marriage]], saying it was "madness", and would "redefine society since the institution of marriage is one of the fundamental building blocks of society", and thus shame the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/9121424/We-cannot-afford-to-indulge-this-madness.html |title=We cannot afford to indulge this madness|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=29 April 2012|location=London|first=Keith|last=O'Brien|date=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative MP [[Margot James]], who was considered one of the most influential gay women in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/gay-power-the-pink-list-406297.html "Gay Power: The Pink List 2009"] ''The Independent'', 2 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; called these comments "scaremongering" and said: "I think it is a completely unacceptable way for a prelate to talk. I think that the government is not trying to force Catholic churches to perform gay marriages at all. It is a purely civil matter." The Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, [[Harriet Harman]], said that, "We have had prejudice, discrimination and homophobia for hundreds of years. That doesn't make it right [...] I don't want anybody to feel that this is a licence for whipping up prejudice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/04/catholic-leader-government-gay-marriage|title=Catholic leader calls government's gay marriage plans 'madness'|work=The Guardian|date=4 March 2012|accessdate=16 July 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Hodges]] wrote: "I can't remember the last time I read a more morally and intellectually bankrupt rant from a senior member of the clergy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danhodges/100141250/gay-marriage-people-of-faith-need-a-better-spokesman-than-cardinal-keith-obrien|title=Gay marriage:  people of faith need a better spokesman than Cardinal Keith O'Brien|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=16 July 2012|location=London|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LGBT rights campaigners [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]] awarded O'Brien "Bigot of the Year" at their annual awards in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Peck, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/britains-most-senior-catholic-is-named-bigot-of-the-year-8274698.html "Britain's most senior Catholic is named 'Bigot of the Year'"], ''The Independent'', 2 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The award was criticised by the first minister of Scotland, [[Alex Salmond]], as being "clearly wrong" and "not conducive to a proper and dignified debate on the important issue of equality in Scotland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20175530|title=Storm over Stonewall's Cardinal Keith O'Brien 'bigot' award|publisher=BBC|date=2 November 2012|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clerical celibacy===
On 22 February 2013, in an interview with the BBC, O'Brien said he was open to the possibility of removing the requirement of [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|celibacy in the priesthood]].&lt;ref name=BBC22Feb13&gt;{{cite news|title=Cardinal Keith O'Brien: 'Allow priests to marry'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-21552628|publisher=BBC Scotland|accessdate=22 February 2013|date=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion and embryo research===
In May 2007 O'Brien urged Roman Catholics to reject political candidates who support what he called the "social evil" of abortion, and said that such Catholic politicians should not expect to remain full members of the church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6706743.stm Cardinal sounds abortion warning], [[BBC]], 31 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

During March 2008, O'Brien highlighted the issue of the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008|Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill]] being debated in Parliament, denouncing the government for a "monstrous attack on human rights" through its "evil" endorsement of "Frankenstein" experiments. Some scientists suggested that he intentionally used inflammatory language to stir up opposition to the bill; others argued he was sticking up for morals and forced the Government to allow MPs to vote freely on the issue. ([[Gordon Brown]] had originally imposed a three-line whip on Labour MPs, meaning they had to back the bill, regardless of personal convictions.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/politics/Cardinal-O39Brien-attacks-embryo-research.3903501.jp|title=Cardinal O'Brien attacks embryo research|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=21 March 2008|accessdate=29 April 2012|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Times|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article3603020.ece|title=Cardinal Keith O'Brien branded a 'liar' on embryo research by Labour peer|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=4rfv21mar&gt;{{cite news|title=Cardinal O'Brien Condemns "Monstrous" Embryo Research|url=http://www.4rfv.co.uk/nationalnews.asp?id=73347|accessdate=3 March 2013|newspaper=4rfv|date=21 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Brien himself narrated a five-minute video recording in which he stated the "many, many concerns" of the Catholic Church concerning the bill which was to be voted on in Parliament. It was posted on [[YouTube]], and sent as a [[DVD]] to every member of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scmo.org/articles/cardinal-obrien--bishop-tartaglia-continue-opposition-to-hfea-bill.html |title=Scottish Catholic Media Office: Cardinal O'Brien &amp; Bishop Tartaglia continue opposition to HFEA Bill, 10 April 2008 |publisher=Scmo.org |date= |accessdate=14 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405173002/http://scmo.org/articles/cardinal-obrien--bishop-tartaglia-continue-opposition-to-hfea-bill.html |archivedate= 5 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video O'Brien made clear he was not against medical research, and supported research with non-embryonic [[stem cell]]s, but was opposed to using embryos which would later be destroyed. He expressed the church's concerns over "human-animal hybrids".&lt;ref name=yt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22MR984zgvo |title=Link to 10 April 2008 YouTube video in which O'Brien himself talks about the Human Embryology and Fertilisation Bill |publisher=Youtube.com |date=10 April 2008 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British politics===
In February 2010 the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]], [[Jim Murphy]], said in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that faith was "at the very foundations of the Labour Party" and encouraged openness to religion in public life. O'Brien responded by saying he "welcomed the sentiment" but pointed out that "a tangible example by the Government over the last decade that it acknowledged or endorsed religious values would also have been welcomed. Instead we have witnessed this Government undertake a systematic and unrelenting attack on family values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/british_government_systematically_attacking_family_values_cardinal_obrien_states|title=British government systematically attacking family values, Cardinal O'Brien states|agency=Catholic News Agency|date=25 February 2010|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien said to the leader of the [[Scottish Labour Party]], [[Iain Gray]], "I hope he [Pope Benedict XVI] gives you hell [during his September 2010 visit] for what has happened over the past 10 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bussey|first=Katrine|url=http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1621309?UserKey=|title=Pope could give Labour Party 'hell'|publisher=Press and Journal|date=25 February 2010|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8534457.stm|title=Cardinal launches attack on Labour|publisher=BBC News|date=24 February 2010|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011 O'Brien called British foreign policy "anti-Christian" for greatly increasing  aid to [[Pakistan]] without requiring any commitment from the Pakistani government to  religious freedom for Christians and other minorities. He made this statement in the wake of the assassination of Pakistani minister [[Shahbaz Bhatti]], who had spoken out against [[Blasphemy law in Pakistan|the country's blasphemy law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=17854|title=Cardinal O'Brien attacks UK's 'anti-Christian foreign policy' on Independent Catholic News|publisher=Indcatholicnews.com|date=15 March 2011|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====British monarchy====
O'Brien has called for a 310-year-old law banning Catholics from taking the throne to be repealed. He said the [[Act of Settlement of 1701]] was hampering efforts to curb sectarianism. Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] said that "in principle" he supported reforming the law on royal succession to remove the ban on Catholics, or people married to Catholics, ascending the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-13449886|title=Catholic church leader criticises royal succession rule|publisher=BBC|date=19 May 2011|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scottish independence====
In an interview with the [[University of St Andrews]] philosopher [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]], published in the ''[[Catholic Herald]]'' in October 2006, O'Brien stated that he would be "happy" if Scots voted for [[Scottish independence|independence]] and predicted that independence is coming "before too long". He drew parallels with the independence of the [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland]]: "it is difficult to argue that ecclesiastical independence is acceptable but political independence is not".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061017233423/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1527572006 Catholic leader backs Scottish independence], ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'', 15 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poverty====
In 2011 Keith O'Brien preached a [[homily]] including the quote below.
{{quote|Travelling around our own Archdiocese and visiting schools, primary or secondary basically every week I realise that there are more and more children needing a nourishing meal provided by the State each day and this is accomplished throughout schools with the help of the State. No one can say that unemployment is no longer with us – rather at times it seems to be increasing. Further with the present economic recession biting harder and harder the needs of our people have become increasingly difficult to satisfy and it is not just the “poorest of the poor” who have to be helped by the [[St Vincent de Paul Society]] but rather people who might have considered themselves rather well off.  In previous years it might have been relatively easy to recognise the signs of poverty in our community – but that is not quite the same at this present time when not only do the poor become poorer but very often the rich become poor! I would put it to the members of the St Vincent de Paul Society that they should consider how best to answer those calls for alleviation of poverty by an increasing number in our society who previously were and consider themselves “well off” but now find themselves and their families in rather straitened circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archdiocese-edinburgh.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=380:st-vincent-de-paul|title=St Vincent de Paul|website=Archdiocese-edinburgh.com|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Leonardo da Vinci''''' is a 1997 interactive [[CD-ROM]] game by [[Branded Entertainment Network|Corbis]], consisting of a "computerized viewing tool which permits the user to examine English translations of the [[Codex Leicester|Codex [Leicester]]] superimposed onto facsimiles of its pages".&lt;ref name="wolfstonelaw.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfstonelaw.com/leonardo_essay.html|title=Gary Wolfstone reviews Leonardo da Vinci Digitized|website=www.wolfstonelaw.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802003530/http://www.wolfstonelaw.com/leonardo_essay.html|archivedate=2015-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool, known as Codescope, is licensed by Corbis.

==Development==
In 1994, [[Bill Gates]] acquired the Codex Leicester.&lt;ref name="wolfstonelaw.com"/&gt; In 1997, Gates' privately held company Corbis released a CD-Rom version of the manuscript.&lt;ref name="wolfstonelaw.com"/&gt; On October 25, 1996 it was announced the game would be ready for the holiday season ([[Microsoft Windows]] in November and [[Macintosh]] in December&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Corbis+Announces+%22Leonardo+da+Vinci%22+CD-ROM.-a018795189|title=Corbis Announces "Leonardo da Vinci" CD-ROM. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but this was ultimately postponed.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"/&gt; The game was one in a line of educational/entertainment CD-ROMs with subjects including [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and the [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/400162/setting-a-standard-in-multimedia-software/|title=Setting A Standard In Multimedia Software|first=Wade|last=Roush|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's promotion was kick-started by being featured in a Da Vinci exhibition at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/doug_rowan-the-curator|title=The Curator - Edge.org|website=www.edge.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421031456/https://www.edge.org/conversation/doug_rowan-the-curator|archivedate=2018-04-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3392">'''Louisa Mary Barwell''' (1800–1885) was an English musician and educational writer.

==Life==
Barwell was born Louisa Mary Bacon in the parish of St. Peter Mancroft, [[Norwich]], on 4 March 1800. She was the daughter of [[Richard Mackenzie Bacon]] by his wife Jane Louisa (Noverre), born 1768, died 1808. At the age of eighteen she was associated with her father in the editorship of the ''[[Quarterly Musical Magazine and Review]]''. A talented musician with a fine voice, she played from score at sight.

After her marriage with John Barwell, wine merchant at Norwich (born 1798, died 1876), she devoted attention to educational works, developing a comprehension of child nature, physical and mental. She contributed to the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Education]]'' from about the year 1831, anticipating later views and plans of education. Her husband, who shared her interest in this subject, was largely instrumental in securing the success of a scheme by which a charity day-school for girls at Norwich was converted into an industrial training-school for girls.

With [[Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg]], in whose school at [[Hofwyl]] near [[Berne]] their sons were placed, the Barwells formed a close friendship. In the literary society of Norwich, as portrayed by [[Harriet Martineau]], Mrs. Barwell held an important place. Her closest friend was [[Anne Isabella Byron, Baroness Byron|Lady Noel Byron]], whose correspondence with her was constant, and whose papers she arranged, in the later years of Lady Byron's life. She survived her friend nearly a quarter of a century, dying on 2 February 1885, leaving four sons and a daughter.

==Works==
Her publications were:

* ‘Little Lessons for Little Learners,’ 1883 (in monosyllables; fourteen subsequent editions). 
* ‘The Value of Time,’ 1834. 
* ‘The Value of Money,’ 1834. 
* ‘Little Lessons for Little Learners,’ 2nd series, 1835 (many subsequent editions). 
* ‘The Elder Brother,’ 1835. 
* ‘Edward the Crusader's Son,’ 2 vols., 1836. 
* ‘Remember, or Mamma's Birthday,’ 1837. 
* ‘Nursery Government,’ 1837. 9. ‘Sunday Lessons for Little Children,’ 1838. 
* ‘The Novel Adventures of Tom Thumb the Great, showing how he visited the Insect World and learned much Wisdom,’ 1838. 
* ‘Trials of Strength, Moral and Physical,’ 1839. 
* ‘The Nursery Maid,’ 1839. 
* ‘Letters from Hofwyl,’ 1842 (published at Lady Byron's suggestion). 
* ‘Gilbert Harland, or Good in Everything,’ 1850. 
* ‘Childhood's Hours,’ 1851 (ordered by the queen to be used in the royal nursery). 
* ‘Flora's Horticultural Fête,’ 1880 (poem for the benefit of the children's infirmary established at Norwich by her friend [[Jenny Lind-Goldschmidt]]).

'''Miriam Beerman''' (born 1923) is an [[Americans|American]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[Printmaking|printmaker]].

Beerman was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]], where she later earned her BFA from the [[Rhode Island School of Design|Rhode Island School for Design]].  After earning her degree, she studied with various established artists including [[Yasuo Kuniyoshi]] at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] in [[New York City|NYC]], with [[Adja Yunkers]] at [[The New School|the New School for Social Research]] in NYC, and [[Stanley William Hayter]] at Atelier 17 in [[Paris]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heller|first=Jules|title=North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century: A Biographical Dictionary|year=1995|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|location=New York and London|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Beerman maintains the gestural brushstrokes of the [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionists]], her work focuses on bestial characters who convey the intense emotion found in her images.  Her work includes automatic gestures, vivid colors, and [[Stippling|stippled]] textures that help evoke the feeling of devastation.  Some of her themes include biblical plagues, [[the Holocaust]], Hiroshima, and nuclear threat.&lt;ref&gt;Weld, Alison. "Miriam Beerman On Line Gallery." Miriam Beerman On Line Gallery. Miriam Beerman, n.d. Web. 12 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The breadth of Beerman's career is evident through her grants, awards, and exhibitions list.  Some include a CAPS grant from [[New York State Council on the Arts]] (1971), the [[Childe Hassam]] purchase award from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] (1977), the Camargo Foundation Award (1980), a distinguished artist grant from the [[New Jersey State Council on the Arts]] (1987), and a 40-year retrospective of her work, held at the [[New Jersey State Museum|State Museum of New Jersey]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] (1991).&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who in American Art. 20th ed. R.R. Bowker Co., 1993-1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has been exhibited globally, including at the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]], and at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in [[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|NY]].

In 2000, Beerman was an Artist's Book Resident at the [[Women's Studio Workshop]] in [[Rosendale, New York]]. During her residency, Beerman published ''Faces'', a limited-edition portfolio of eight drypoint prints with text from ''[[The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge]]'' by [[Rainer Maria Rilke]].  The images are rough, humorous and tragic, echoing the artist’s humanistic concerns.&lt;ref&gt;“Faces.” Women’s Studio Workshop. Retrieved 2014-01-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicolas Gouïn Dufief''' (c. 1776–1834) was an [[émigré]] French teacher.{{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=132}}

==Life==
He was a native of [[Nantes]], was born in or about 1776. His father, a knight of the [[Order of Saint Louis]], served during the revolution as a volunteer under the French princes in Germany; his mother, the Countess [[Victoire Aimée Libault Gouïn Dufief]], was personally engaged in the many battles fought by her relative, General [[François de Charette]], against the revolutionists, for which she was afterwards known as "the heroine of La Vendée". {{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=133}}

Dufief, though a stripling of fifteen, joined in 1792 the royal naval corps assembled under the [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing]] at [[Enghien]], and went through the campaign with his regiment in the army of the brothers of [[Louis XVIII]] until its disbandment. The same year he sought refuge in England, but soon afterwards sailed for the [[West Indies]], and was attracted thence to [[Philadelphia]], which he reached in July 1793. During his sojourn in America, he became acquainted with Dr. [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and other eminent men. 
Here, too, he published an essay on ''[[The Philosophy of Language]]'', in which he first explained to the world how he was led to make those discoveries "from which my system of universal and economical instruction derives such peculiar and manifold advantages". 
For nearly twenty-five years he taught French with success in America and in England, to which he returned about 1818. {{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=133}}

He died at [[Pentonville]], London, 12 April 1834.

==Works==
His chief work is ''Nature displayed in her mode of teaching Language to Man; being a new and infallible Method of acquiring Languages with unparalleled rapidity; deduced from the analysis of the human mind, and consequently suited to every capacity: adapted to the French. To which is prefixed a development of the author's plan of tuition'', 2 volumes octavo, London, 1818, which despite its size and costliness reached a twelfth edition in the author's lifetime. Shortly before his death he completed ''A Universal, Pronouncing, and Critical French-English Dictionary'', octavo, London, 1833. He was author, too, of ''The French Self-interpreter, or Pronouncing Grammar'', duodecimo, Exeter (1820?).{{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=133}}

The '''Petites écoles de Port-Royal''' was the name given to a teaching system set up in 1637 by the intellectuals who gathered at [[Port-Royal-des-Champs]] in the middle of the 17th century at the height of the [[Jansenist]] controversy. They functioned until 1660.

== Origin ==
The monastery of [[Port-Royal-des-Champs]] was more or less abandoned in favour of that in Paris (for health reasons - the site was [[malaria]]l) when in 1637 [[Jean Duvergier de Hauranne]], abbot of Saint-Cyran, decided to set up a school for 30 children here, headed by his friend, the priest [[Antoine Singlin]]. This school shared the building with the ''Solitaires'', intellectuals or politicians who had decided to go into retreat to perfect their spiritual life, many of whom taught at the school.

Its teachers' intellectual calibre made Petites écoles de Port-Royal a place of intellectual excellence, but also of experimentation in teaching methods (based on French and not Latin and thus revolutionary for the time) and in [[Text normalization|normalization]] of the French language. They also withdrew from the [[Jesuit]] teaching system, which mainly taught in Latin, even when their young students had not mastered Latin. Class sizes were small (never more than 25 children) to create a teacher-pupil relationship that was very strict but also marked by trust and admiration. Discipline was very severe, but many of its teaching rules demonstrate a real concern for what would later be called [[child psychology]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Jean Racine]] was taught here from 1655 to 1666, and the economist [[Pierre Le Pesant de Boisguilbert]] was also taught here.

Its teachers were also drawn from among the major intellectuals of the time:
*[[Blaise Pascal]], who wrote a new method of teaching children to read 
*[[Claude Lancelot]], who wrote the famous ''Grammaire de Port-Royal'', foundational text for the [[Text normalization|normalization]] of the French language
*[[Pierre Nicole]], moralist and logician
*[[Jean Hamon (doctor)|Jean Hamon]], doctor and classicist

[[File:Paisos catalans.svg|thumb|Catalan-speaking territories]]
'''La Plataforma per la Llengua''' (the Pro-Language Platform) is a non-governmental organisation born in 1993 in [[Barcelona]] ([[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]]), in order to defend and promote [[Catalan language]] all over the [[Països Catalans|Catalan-speaking territories]] in the European States where it is spoken: [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Andorra]] and [[Italy]]. Their activities include the development of sociolinguistic studies and a constant monitoring on the status of the [[Catalan language]], in collaboration with other organizations, foundations and public agencies. Even it is based in Barcelona, it has delegations in [[Valencian Community]], [[Alghero]] and in several Catalan regions. Moreover,  La Plataforma per la Llengua works together with some [[Northern Catalonia]], [[La Franja]], [[Andorra]] and [[Balearic Islands]] organisations. There are so many aims; one of them is to guarantee the linguistic rights to Catalan-speaking people and the use of [[Catalan language]] as a connexion tool in all the fields and territories where it is spoken .

As of 2016, there were 12,000 associates, more than 55,000 followers on Facebook and more than 30,000 followers on Twitter. Also, every six months, the NGO publishes a magazine called Corbella whose print run is 9,000 copies. In 2008, this magazine was awarded a prize for being the best cultural association media. The prize was awarded by the Federació d’Ateneus de Catalunya.

The Association is supported by a consultative council consisting of Salvador Cardús, Jordi Font, Josep M. López Llaví, Albert Manent, Isidor Marí, Fèlix Martí, Jordi Porta, Jordi Sànchez, Josep Mª Terricabras, Miquel Sellarès, Vicenç Villatoro, [[Isabel-Clara Simó]], Miquel Strubell, Patrícia Gabancho and Abelard Saragossà.

On 23 September 2012, [[Martí Gasull i Roig]], one of the organisation's founders and the main Plataforma per la Llengua coordinator, died in an accident on a mountain ([[Manaslu]]), in [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkspain.com/news-spain/21748/catalan-climber-amongst-manaslu-avalanche-dead|title=Catalan climber amongst Manaslu avalanche dead |accessdate=4 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/nepal-ids-avalanche-victims-killed-mt-manaslu-170322021.html|title=Nepal IDs avalanche victims killed on Mt. Manaslu|accessdate=4 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martí Gasull i Roig work’s has been appreciated many times.

[[File:Plataforma per la Llengua (2).JPG|thumb|Magazines Plataforma per la Llengua]]

La Plataforma per la Llengua was born in 1993. His first public action was collecting 18,000 [[Coca-Cola]] tins, which was a score, in [[Plaça de Catalunya]], in [[Barcelona]], 12 December 1993. The goal was asking for Catalan business tagging. A draw that said "Etiquetem en català" (Let’s tag in Catalan) was made with all the collected tins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www10.gencat.net/pres_casa_llengues/AppJava/frontend/llengues_bp.jsp?id=88&amp;idioma=5|publisher=Linguamon|title=Raising awareness of labelling in one's own language.

Between 1995 and 2000 some protestation acts took place in cinemas to ask for dubbing and Catalan subtitling. Also, there were campaigns to pressure the government and the multinationals with massive messages, certificates and public reports to media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.plataforma-llengua.cat/media/assets/1587/Resum_estudi_cinema-en.pdf |publisher=Plataforma per la Llengua|title=Study on the practices and legislative environment of language in the cinema in different European countries, Quebec and Catalonia|accessdate=4 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, relevant multinationals like Warner made films in Catalan about the Story of Harry Potter. In 2011, La Plataforma per la Llengua made Catalan government write a cinema law that guarantee 50% of copies in Catalan. However, in 2013 it hasn’t been yet enforced. In 1997, La Plataforma per la Llengua played a relevant role in the discussion of other laws filed by the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]], like the Act on linguistic policy, the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]] 2006, the Act on reception for immigrants and returnees to Catalonia 2010 or Catalan Consumer Code 2010. Some small changes were made in the documents that involved Catalan language, but most of them haven’t been yet applied.

In business area, there was a very unfavourable situation in 2000, and by intensive campaigns, some goals were achieved: Catalan language was introduced in some big multinationals like Apple, Microsoft, Vodafone, Orange, Telefónica, Carrefour, Nokia, Samsung, Siemens, Carrefour, Decathlon, Schlecker, Facebook, Google, Twitter or IKEA.

From 2000 La Plataforma per la Llengua started growing. Before, it was an organisation supported by Col•lectiu l’Esbarzer, but then, an associates basis and a professional structured were created. A new work methodology was applied, reports were written and a consumer net appear. Some events were organised in order to make citizens realise about the linguistic points and claim a business improvement as well as an autonomic government improvement of [[Catalonia]], [[Valencian Community]], [[Aragon]] and [[Balearic Islands]] and Spanish, French and Italian States.
    
In 2004, the first Festa de la Joguina en Català (The Game Party in Catalan) was celebrated some days before Christmas. Since then, it has been celebrated once a year to claim children can play in Catalan. In 2005, the first Festa d’Acollida d’Estudiants Universitaris Erasmus (Welcome party for university students with [[Erasmus Programme]]) in Barcelona to increase Catalan language in university courses and make new arrival students use Catalan in university courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www10.gencat.cat/pres_casa_llengues/AppJava/frontend/llengues_bp_print.jsp?id=171&amp;idioma=5|title=Festa means Party|accessdate=4 Dec 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210211026/http://www10.gencat.cat/pres_casa_llengues/AppJava/frontend/llengues_bp_print.jsp?id=171&amp;idioma=5|archivedate=10 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.plataforma-llengua.cat/media/assets/1305/feeling-08-desplegable.pdf |title=Welcome to Catalonia|accessdate=4 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.plataforma-llengua.cat/media/assets/1162/guia_universitats.pdf |title=What’s this Catalan thing?|accessdate=4 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the first Dia de Sant Jordi act ([[Saint George's Day]]), Catalonia’s patron, was celebrated in [[Plaça de Catalunya]], in [[Barcelona]], with other immigrants organisations to reclaim the use of Catalan as a common language. Since then, the organisation has worked together with a 30 immigrant organisations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www10.gencat.net/pres_casa_llengues/AppJava/frontend/llengues_bp.jsp?id=212&amp;idioma=5|title=Catalan, a shared Language|accessdate=4 Dec 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213134631/http://www10.gencat.net/pres_casa_llengues/AppJava/frontend/llengues_bp.jsp?id=212&amp;idioma=5|archivedate=13 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to established the linguistic diversity of Catalan Community and the use of Catalan as a cohesion tool, by using a hundred linguistic partners formed by a Catalan and a person who wants to learn it, and by videos about social cohesion in Catalan that have had a thousand visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWm0gqsjuoI&amp;list=FLjv3RMJ77vnoJgfOetD5-RA&amp;index=1|title=lipdub for the Language|accessdate=4 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

La Plataforma per la Llengua put into groups a hundred local governments and Catalan institutions that had the compromise to use only the products tagged in Catalan. After having achieved tagging in Catalan in the products like wine, cava, water, milk and beer, finally, after strong campaigns towards the government, in 2010, the Catalan Consumer Code 2010 comprised the obligation of tagging in Catalan the products distributed in Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catalannewsagency.com/society-science/item/study-shows-that-9-out-of-10-products-are-not-labeled-in-catalan|title=Catalan and the official languages of the European Union |accessdate=4 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

La Plataforma per la Llengua has complained again by campaigns that Catalan is the only European language with so many million speakers that is neither official of [[European Union]] nor of a state of European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://international.reagrupament.cat/?p=7542|title=Catalan and the official languages of the European Union|accessdate=4 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JInDzLhMby0|title=Catalan and the official European Union languages|accessdate=5 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 a report was written, it complained more than 500 actions that Catalan people need to use [[Spanish Language]] and the valid Catalan banning in Spain.

La Plataforma per la Llengua has acted to answer to the [[Government of Spain]] attacks and to the some other Spanish Autonomic Government attacks. These attacks were against people who spoke Catalan, specially, in learning and against the recognition of the official language too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helpcatalonia.cat/2012/05/sentences-of-high-court-of-justice.html#uds-search-results|title=Plataforma per la Llengua deplores the sentences of  the High Court of Justice that impose the use of Spanish in Catalonia|accessdate=4 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complaints about failure to take action and about Spanish police aggressions, as well as the aggressions of other civil servants against citizens that express themselves in Catalan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://understandcatalonia.blogspot.com.es/2013/06/severe-cases-of-linguistic.html|title=Severe cases of linguistic discrimination|accessdate=4 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.plataforma-llengua.cat/que-fem/estudis-i-publicacions/171|title= If you address me in Catalan I'll suspend the proceedings" Castrated language rights in Europe|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ara.cat/en/to-Catalan-Ill-European-Parliament_0_1540645999.html |work=[[Ara (newspaper)|Ara]]|title= "If you talk to me in Catalan, I’ll call this trial off": European Parliament to hear about discrimination of Catalan speakers|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Primary education''' and '''elementary education'''  is typically the first stage of [[formal education]], coming after [[preschool]] and before [[secondary education]] (The first two grades of primary school, Grades 1 and 2, are also part of [[early childhood education]]). Primary education usually takes place in a [[primary school]] or [[elementary school]]. In some countries, primary education is followed by [[middle school]], an [[educational stage]] which exists in some countries, and takes place between primary school and [[high school]] [[college]]. Primary Education in Australia consists of grades foundation to grade 6. In the United States, primary education is Grades 1 - 3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naeyc.org/sites/default/files/globally-shared/downloads/PDFs/about-us/people/NAEYC_Strategic_Direction.pdf|title=Strategic Direction: National Association for the Education of Young Children|website=naeyc.org|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elementary education usually consists of grades 1-6.

==Millennium Development Goal==
{{Main article|Millennium Development Goals}}
[[File:Millennium_Development_Goals,_UN_Headquarters,_New_York_City,_New_York_-_20080501.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Millennium_Development_Goals,_UN_Headquarters,_New_York_City,_New_York_-_20080501.jpg|thumb|A poster at the [[United Nations Headquarters]] in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States, showing the Millennium Development Goals]]
The [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goal 2]] was to achieve [[universal primary education]] by the year 2015, by which time their aim was to ensure that all children everywhere, regardless of race or gender, will be able to complete primary schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/education.shtml|title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals|date=|website=Un.org|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact that the United Nations specifically focused on [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[South Asia]], as they are both home to the vast majority of children out of school, they hypothesized that they might not have been able to reach their goal by 2015.  According to the September 2010 fact sheet, this was because there were still about 69 million school-age children who were not in school with almost half of the demographic in sub-Saharan Africa and more than a quarter in Southern Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/MDG_FS_2_EN.pdf|title=GOAL 2 : Achieve Universal Primary Education|website=Un.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to achieve the goal by 2015, the United Nations estimated that all children at the official entry age for primary school would have had to have been attending classes by 2009.  This would depend upon the duration of the primary level, as well as how well the schools retain students until the end of the cycle.

Not only was it important for children to be enrolled in education, but countries will also have needed to ensure that there are a sufficient number of teachers and classrooms to meet the demand of pupils. As of 2010, the number of new teachers needed in sub-Saharan Africa alone, equaled the current teaching force in the region.&lt;ref name="autogenerated182"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/MDG%20Report%202010%20En%20r15%20-low%20res%2020100615%20-.pdf#page=18|title=GOAL 2 : Achieve Universal Primary Education|website=Un.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the gender gap for children not in education had also been narrowed. Between 1999 and 2008, the number of girls not in education worldwide had decreased from 57 percent to 53 percent, however it should also be noted that in some regions, the percentage had increased.&lt;ref name="autogenerated182" /&gt;

According to the [[United Nations]], there are many things in the regions that have already been accomplished.  Although enrollment in the sub-Saharan area of Africa continues to be the lowest region worldwide, by 2010 "it still increased by 18 percentage points—from 58 percent to 76 percent—between 1999 and 2008."  There was also progress in both Southern Asia and North Africa, where both areas saw an increase in enrollment, For example, In Southern Asia, this had increased by 11 percent and in North Africa by 8 percent- over the last decade.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Major advances had been made even in the poorest of countries like the abolition of primary school fees in [[Burundi]] where there was an increase in primary-school enrollment which reached 99 percent as of 2008.  Also, [[Tanzania]] experienced a similar outcome.  The country doubled its enrollment ratio over the same period. Moreover, other regions in Latin America such as [[Guatemala]] and  [[Nicaragua]], and [[Zambia]] in Southern Africa "broke through the 90 percent towards greater access to primary education."&lt;ref name="autogenerated182" /&gt;

{{main article|Education in Indonesia}}The Indonesian term for elementary school is "sekolah dasar" and it consists of six grades.

===India===
{{main article|Education in India}}In India, elementary schools provide education from Class&amp;nbsp;1 to Class&amp;nbsp;8. The children in these classes are generally aged between 6 and 15 years. It is the next stage after kindergarten (Pre-Nursery, Nursery, Prep or Lower Kindergarten and Upper Kindergarten). The next stage after primary education is Middle School (Class 7th to 10th). In most schools in North India, children in Classes 1st to 3rd are taught English, [[Hindi]], Mathematics, [[Environmental Science]], and General Knowledge. In class 4th and 5th the environmental science subject is replaced by General Science and Social Studies. However some schools may introduce this concept in Class&amp;nbsp;3 itself. Some schools may also introduce a third language in Class&amp;nbsp;5th or even in Class&amp;nbsp;4th. [[Sanskrit]] and local state language are the most common third languages taught in Indian schools. At some places, primary education is labeled as the education of Class&amp;nbsp;3rd to Class&amp;nbsp;5th and up to class&amp;nbsp;2nd as pre-primary education. This is because many new concepts are introduced in this class. Children are taught painting instead of drawing and colouring, exams are taken, and [[Word Sum Puzzle]] in maths are introduced along with geometry.

The [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]] (NCERT) is the apex body for school education in India.&lt;ref name="I09RA-2332"&gt;''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'',  233&lt;/ref&gt; The NCERT provides support and technical assistance to a number of schools in India and oversees many aspects of enforcement of education policies.&lt;ref&gt;''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 230–234&lt;/ref&gt; In India, the various bodies governing school education system are:

* The state government boards, in which the majority of Indian children are enrolled.
* The [[Central Board of Secondary Education|Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)]] board.
* The [[CISCE|Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE)]] board.
* The [[National Institute of Open Schooling]].
* International schools affiliated to the [[International Baccalaureate]] Programme or the [[Cambridge International Examinations]].
* Islamic [[Madrasah]] schools, whose boards are controlled by local state governments, or autonomous, or affiliated with [[Darul Uloom Deoband]].
* Autonomous schools like Woodstock School, [[Auroville]],  [[Visva-Bharati University|Patha Bhavan]] and [[Ananda Marga|Ananda Marga Gurukula]].

===Philippines===
{{main article|Education in the Philippines}}In the Philippines, the Department of Education mandates that elementary school lasts for 7&amp;nbsp;years in the public school system starting with Kindergarten and grade&amp;nbsp;1 and culminating with grade&amp;nbsp;6. After successful completion of the 7-year programme shall a student graduate, be awarded an elementary diploma and can move-on to a 4-year junior high school programme (most private schools will require an entrance examination). However most private schools (which usually call the elementary level as "grade school"), especially exclusive schools and those accredited to have a high degree of autonomy from the Department of Education usually extend their programmes to 7th&amp;nbsp;grade and can also include levels such as nursery, kindergarten or preparatory (prep) as entry levels prior to 1st&amp;nbsp;grade. Subjects usually taken up include Communication Arts in Mother Tongue (until Grade 3), English (some private schools break this down into Language and Reading) and Filipino, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies (taught in Mother Tongue from Grade 1-Grade 3, Filipino in Grades 4-6), Music, Art, Physical Education and Health (collectively known as MAPEH), Values Education and Technology and Livelihood Education (TLE). Students in the 6th&amp;nbsp;grade, whether studying in a public or private school are required to undergo a National (Elementary) Achievement Test (NAT) even if grade&amp;nbsp;6 isn't the terminal level in that school. The NAT is similar to certain schemes like Primary School Leaving Examination of Singapore (PSLE) except that that NAT score isn't used as a basis to admit students to a high school. Kindergarten, Grade&amp;nbsp;1 to Grade&amp;nbsp;6 are affected with the K-12&amp;nbsp;education.

{{main article|Education in Germany}}Depending on the [[States of Germany|federal state]], primary schools provide education from Class 1 to Class 4 or from Class 1 to Class 6. After primary school students may attend a [[Hauptschule]], [[Mittelschule]], [[Regionale Schule]] or a [[Realschule]], which are more vocationally orientated, a [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]], which is more academically oriented, or a [[Gesamtschule]], which is comparable to a [[Comprehensive School]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The first school for German children is called Grundschule. It takes usually four years, the pupils are between six and ten years old. The education consists of learning to read, write, basic math and general knowledge. In some schools, a first foreign language is introduced, usually English. In the final year of primary school, children receive a recommendation as to which further school they can attend.

* Kindergarten: 3–6 years
* Grade 1: 6–7 years
* Grade 2: 7–8 years
* Grade 3: 8–9 years
* Grade 4: 9–10 years
* Grade 5: 10–11 years ([[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]] only)
* Grade 6: 11–12 years (Berlin and Brandenburg only)

Depending on the recommendation they received from their teacher, children proceed to their mandatory secondary education in either Hauptschule (Grades 5-9, sometimes 10th grade is added which is then called "Werkrealschule"), Realschule (Grades 5-10), or Gymnasium (Grades 5-12). Upon the successful completion of Grades 11 and 12 in the Gymnasium, students receive the Abitur, a diploma with the permission to enter post-secondary education (similar to the A-level or High School Diploma). The Abitur will not be received at the end of Haupt- and Realschule, but graduating students are eligible to enter the 10th Grade of the Gymnasium if they wish to obtain the Abitur.

===Ireland===
{{main article|Education in the Republic of Ireland}}Primary school teaching in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] consists of 8 class levels. These are:

* Junior Infants (4–5 years)
* Senior Infants (5–6 years)

* 5th class (Rang a cúig, 10–11 years)
* 6th class (Rang a sé, 11–12 years)

Junior and Senior infants correspond to [[Kindergarten]].

The subjects mainly taught in primary school are:

* English (Béarla, Spellings are taught more in Primary education, not taught in Secondary although if you make a spelling mistake in Secondary English work, you would be corrected)
* Maths (Mata)
* Irish (Gaeilge)
* Modern European language (i.e. French or/and German) (very rarely)
* History (Stair)
* Geography (Tíreolaíocht/Tír Eolas, direct translation "Country-science/Country information")

* Art (Ealaín)
* Drama (Drámaíocht)
* Music (Ceol)
* SPHE (Social, Personal, Health Education) (OSPS, Oideachas Sóisialta, Pearsanta, Sláintiúil)

Secondary school teaching in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] consists of 6 class levels. These are:

* 1st year (12–13 years)
* 2nd year (13–14 years)

* 4th year/Transition Year(TY) (15–16 years) This year is optional.
* 5th year (16–17 years)
* 6th year (17–18 years)

The content of the Religion course taught depends on the management of the school. Many schools are managed and owned by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], with a lesser number belonging to the [[Church of Ireland]] and to the Multi Denominational Group [[Educate Together]] and a handful run by other religions such as [[Islam in Ireland|Muslims]]. Each school body decides on the emphasis of its religious instruction. In Catholic schools 2nd and 6th class prepare children for [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]] and [[Confirmation]] respectively. In the Church of Ireland this preparation is done when the pupil is aged about 14 years, and is in secondary school.

Children may start at primary school at any age between four and six years of age. Most children finish primary school at or around twelve years of age.

===Italy===
Primary school teaching in Italy consists of 5 grades. Before the First Grade, there is the kindergarten (''scuola dell'infanzia'' in Italian), which is not compulsory and lasts 3 years.

* Third grade (8–9 years)
* Fourth grade (9–10 years)

Almost all 4-year-olds (99.3%) in the Netherlands indeed attend primary school, although this is not ''compulsory'' until children reach the age of 5. Primary school is free of charge. In most schools, children are grouped by age in mixed ability classes, with one teacher for all subjects. Primary school consists of 8 groups (thus 8 years of schooling). During the first two years (both kindergarten), children receive an average of 22 hours of education, during the last 6 years children receive an average of 25 hours per week. Schools are open 5 days a week, but all children have a half day on Wednesdays (ending at noon). At the end of primary school, in group 8, schools advise on secondary school choice. Most schools use a national test to support this advice, for instance the 'Citotoets', a test developed by the Central Institute for Test development.

* group 1: age 4-5 (kindergarten)
* group 2: age 5-6 (kindergarten)

===Portugal===
{{Main article|Education in Portugal}}In [[Portugal]], the primary education (''ensino primário'') is known as the 1st cycle of the basic education (''1º ciclo do ensino básico''). It includes the first four years of compulsory education (''1ª classe'', ''2ª classe'', ''3ª classe'' and ''4ª classe''), their pupils being children between six and ten years old. After the education reform of 1986, the former primary education became part of the basic education (''educação básica'').

After that they can choose to (although it is very uncommon not to) study at a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] for three years where they pick a program devoted to a particular direction (i.e. [[Science]], [[Aesthetics]], [[Civics]]). During the gymnasium all students have some subjects they have to study, but not during all three years.

If there are more people who wish to read than spots, the ones with the highest grades are accepted. This is either a preparation for University or for work.

During the year before children start compulsory school, all children are offered a place in a pre-school class (''förskoleklass''), which combines the pedagogical methods of the pre-school with those of compulsory school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skolverket.se/sb/d/2651/a/14987|title=Who is the preschool class for?|date=2016-03-17|website=Skolverket.se|location=SE|language=sv|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skolverket.se/sb/d/2651|title=What is a preschool class?|date=2016-03-17|website=Skolverket.se|location=SE|language=sv|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between ages 7 and 15, children attend compulsory comprehensive school (''grundskola''), divided in three stages.

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|Education in United Kingdom}}{{Intricate detail|section|date=July 2018}}[[Elementary school (England and Wales)|Elementary schools in England and Wales]] were publicly funded schools which provided a basic standard of education for children aged from six to 14 between 1870 and 1944. These were  set up to enable children to receive manual training and elementary instruction and provided a restricted curriculum with the emphasis on [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]] and [[arithmetic]] ([[the three Rs]]). The schools operated on a 'monitorial' system, whereby one teacher supervised a large class with the assistance of a team of monitors, who were quite often older pupils. Elementary school teachers were paid by results. Their pupils were expected to achieve precise standards in reading, writing and arithmetic such as reading a short paragraph in a newspaper, writing from dictation, and working out sums and fractions.&lt;ref name="Gillard2"&gt;Gillard D. [http://www.educationengland.org.uk/history/chapter02.html "Towards a State System of Education"]. In: ''Education in England'', 2011 http://www.educationengland.org.uk, accessed 20 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1944 around 80 per cent of the school population attended elementary schools through to the age of 14. The remainder transferred either to secondary school or junior technical school at age 11. The school system was changed with the introduction of the [[Education Act 1944]]. Education was restructured into three progressive stages which were known as primary education, [[secondary education]] and [[further education]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Anthony Newsam, 'Elementary school', ''Microsoft Encarta'' 2004 edition (CD-Rom), 1993-2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, schools providing primary education are now known as [[Primary school|primary schools]]. They generally cater for children aged from four to eleven ([[Reception (school)|Reception]] to [[Year Six]] or in Northern Ireland and Scotland P1 to P7). Primary schools are often subdivided into [[Infant school|infant schools]] for children from four to seven and [[Junior school|junior schools]] for ages seven to 11. In the (diminishing) minority of areas where there is a "three-tier" system, children go to [[lower school]] or "first school" until about 9, then [[middle school]] until about 13, then [[upper school]]; in these places, the term "primary school" is not usually used.

In the UK schools providing primary education in the [[State school|state]] sector are known as primary schools. They generally cater for children aged from four to eleven ([[Reception (school)|Reception]] to [[Year Six]]; in Northern Ireland and Scotland Primary One to Primary Seven).

In areas that adopted a three-tier system, the term primary school is often used as an alternative to [[First School]], taking in ages up to 9 or 10 years old, although for education planning purposes, the term "primary education" in these areas will still cover the age groups as in a two-tier system.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In the private sector, fee-paying schools which provide primary education are known as [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory schools]], and they often cater for children up to the age of thirteen. As their name suggests, preparatory schools are designed to prepare pupils for entrance examinations for fee-paying [[Independent school (UK)|independent schools]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In the United States, authority to regulate education resides constitutionally with the individual states. The direct authority of the [[U.S. Congress]] and the federal [[U.S. Department of Education]] is essentially limited to regulation and enforcement of federal constitutional rights. Great indirect authority is exercised through federal funding of national programs and block grants; but there is no obligation upon any state to accept these funds, and the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government otherwise may propose but not enforce national goals, objectives and standards, which generally lie beyond its jurisdiction.

Nevertheless, education has had a relatively consistent evolution throughout the United States. All states have historically made a distinction between two genres of K-12&amp;nbsp;education and three genres of K-12&amp;nbsp;school. The genres of education are primary and secondary; and the genres of school are elementary school(Primary school have in common term as well), middle or junior high school, and high school (historically, "senior" high school to distinguish it from the junior school).

Primary education (or "primary school" meaning "primary education") still tends to focus on basic academic learning and socialization skills, introducing children to the broad range of knowledge, skill and behavioral adjustment they need to succeed in life - and, particularly, in secondary school. Secondary education or secondary school has always focused on preparing adolescents for higher education or/and for careers in industries, trades or professions that do not require an academic degree.

Over the past few decades, schools in the USA have been testing various arrangements which break from the one-teacher, one-class model.  Multi-age programs, where children in different grades (e.g. Kindergarten through to [[second grade]]) share the same classroom and teachers, is one increasingly popular alternative to traditional elementary instruction.  Another alternative is that children might have a main class and go to another teacher's room for one subject, such as science, while the science teacher's main class will go to the other teacher's room for another subject, such as social studies.  This could be called a two-teacher, or a rotation. It is similar to the concept of teams in [[Middle school|junior high school]].  Another method is to have the children have one set of classroom teachers in the first half of the year, and a different set of classroom teachers in the second half of the year. Primary School is also known as Elementary school.

43 of the states are now using the Common Core Standards which claim to better prepare students for college and career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/standards-in-your-state/|title=Standards in Your State : Common Core State Standards Initiative|website=Corestandards.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 15 the teenagers go to Ensino Médio (Mid Teaching/School), which is equivalent High School in other countries, but it is only 3 years long (grades 10 to 12) and can either be a regular or technical course.

Primary school is mandatory and consists in nine years called Ensino Fundamental, separated into Ensino Fundamental I (1st to 5th grades) and Ensino Fundamental II (6th to 9th grades).

* 1st grade: 6 to 7 years old (former pre-school);
* 2nd grade: 7 to 8 years old
* 3rd grade: 8 to 9 years old
* 4th grade: 9 to 10 years old
* 5th grade: 10 to 11 years old
* 6th grade: 11 to 12 years old
* 7th grade: 12 to 13 years old
* 8th grade: 13 to 14 years old
* 9th grade: 14 to 15 years old

Primary school is followed by the optional three years called Ensino Médio (former Científico, Liceu or Ginásio).

* 1st grade: 15- to 16-year-olds
* 2nd grade: 16- to 17-year-olds
* 3rd grade: 17- to 18-year-olds

'''Rachel Scott or Cook''' &lt;small&gt;(8 March 1848 &amp;ndash; 29 November 1905)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (married name Mrs [[C. P. Scott|C.P. Scott]]), was a British women's education reformer, based in Manchester, who organised and promoted equality for women.

== Early life and personal education ==
Rachel Susan Cook came from an academic family in [[St Andrews]], one of five sisters. Her paternal line included three generations of divinity professors, including a Moderator of the Church of Scotland .&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/nov/29/cp-scott-wife-rachel-scott-obituary-manchester-guardian-archive-1905|title=The death of Mrs C.P. Scott – archive, 29 November 1905|date=2016-11-29|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her education at St Andrew's senior school [[Madras College]], by a private tutor and then as one of the first 6 female students enrolled at the [[Hirton College for Women|College for Women]] at Hirton, which later became the University of Cambridge's [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Girton College 1869 -1932|last=Stephen|first=Barbara|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; with another Scottish woman, [[Louisa Innes Lumsden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women|last=Elizabeth L. Ewan, Sue Innes, Sian Reynolds, Rose Pipes|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, such women graduates were&lt;blockquote&gt;"..rather special people..exceptionally able, determined, ambitious." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stott|first=Mary|date=June 2018|title=sidelines: Graduated contributions|url=|journal=The Guardian|volume=30 June 1972|pages=11|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1872, Cook graduated as one of the first women at the University of Cambridge with honours in the classic [[Cambridge Tripos|Tripos]], at second class.

This achievement was significant given the challenges women faced in higher education. [[Sarah Woodhead]], Cook and Lumsden were considered 'the Girton pioneers' with Cook also described as:&lt;blockquote&gt;"a tall, dark, willowy beauty with the melancholy air of one of Rossetti's nymphs, classical features and graceful movements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title='That Infidel Place': A Short History of Girton College 1869-1969|last=Bradbrook|first=M.C.|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus Ltd.|year=1969|isbn=|location=London|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;She was recognised by [[George Eliot]] saying that she was "sylphlike" and the most beautiful woman she had ever seen, and there still remains in the minds of those who knew her then a memorable picture of her uncommonness, her dramatic instinct and critical quickness, and her eagerness and radiance of mind.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Campaign for women's education ==
In 1874 she married Charles Scott known as [[C. P. Scott]], editor of the [[Manchester Guardian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide 1866-1928|last=Crawford|first=Elizabeth|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=453}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to Manchester, where she soon joined the governing body of the city's Girls' High School. She continued to champion women's higher education by creating a home-based university level teaching facility, supported by sympathetic professors from Owens College. Through her unstinting efforts this became incorporated into [[Owens College]] in 1883.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Scott also served on the [[Withington Girls' School|Withington Girls School]] governing body and was interested in the co-educational school [[Lady Barn House School|Ladybarn House School]] and took a lead role in education in the City; her eloquent elocution at public events to raise support for education for women and girls, was remarked upon on in her obituary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Her final speech in 1900 was in the [[Free Trade Hall]] to the assembled Manchester Girls' High School community.

Publishing anonymously, Scott translated classical Latin and French texts, as well as a guide to pictures in the Manchester Jubilee Exhibition of 1887. With her husband who was the editor, she contributed critical items to the Manchester Guardian &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and her influence and contribution was also recognised in her husband's obituary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ratcliffe|first=S.K.|date=June 2018|title=C. P. Scott of the Manchester Guardian|url=|journal=The Contemporary Review|volume=London Vol.146 (July 1, 1934)|pages=144|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now the university sector in the UK has more applicants from women than men and the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings|Times Higher]] and [[The Guardian|Guardian]] are debating this.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8130">'''Richard M. Felder''' (born 1939 in [[New York City]]) is the Hoechst Celanese Professor Emeritus of Chemical Engineering at [[North Carolina State University]].
With Ronald Rousseau and Lisa Bullard, he is coauthor of  ''Elementary Principles of Chemical Processes'' (4th Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2015), a widely-used text for the introductory chemical engineering course, and with Rebecca Brent, he is coauthor of [https://educationdesignsinc.com/book/ ''Teaching and Learning STEM: A Practical Guide''] (Jossey-Bass, 2016), a guidebook for instructors of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses. He has authored or coauthored over 300 papers on chemical process engineering and engineering and science education. Most of his publications and resources he has developed for instructors and students can be found on his website [http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/RMF.html ''Resources in Science and Engineering Education''].

==Education and career history==
Felder received a BChE degree from the [[City College of New York]] in 1962 and a PhD in chemical engineering from [[Princeton University]] in 1966. He spent a year as a NATO Postdoctoral Fellow at the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] (Harwell, England) and then two years as a research engineer at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].In 1969 he joined the chemical engineering faculty at [[North Carolina State University]], and he retired to emeritus status in 1999. He spent sabbatical semesters at the University of Colorado (1982), Georgia Tech (1990), the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2003), and Smith College (2006).

==Professional contributions==

===Engineering research===
For roughly the first half of his career, Felder carried out research on a variety of topics, starting with his doctoral and postdoctoral research on energy distributions of energetic atoms in irradiated media, progressing through mathematical modeling of mixing and diffusion in chemical reactors, fluidized bed gasification of coal, and diffusion of gases and vapors in polymer membranes, and concluding with stochastic modeling of specialty chemicals manufacturing processes. His [http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Papers/Technical_Papers.html technical publications] are listed on his website.

===Introductory chemical engineering textbook===

Felder coauthored ''Elementary Principles of Chemical Processes'' with Dr. Ronald W. Rousseau and (in the fourth edition) Dr. Lisa G. Bullard. The book first appeared in 1978 and became the standard textbook for the introductory chemical engineering course in the United States. It has been adopted by more than 90% of all U.S. chemical engineering departments and at many institutions abroad in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Korean editions.

===Research and writing on teaching and learning===
Beginning in the late 1980s, Felder shifted his career focus from disciplinary engineering research to education, including educational research. Besides his book [https://educationdesignsinc.com/book/ ''Teaching and Learning STEM: A Practical Guide''], he has authored or coauthored [http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Papers/Education_Papers.html two book chapters and over 200 education related articles] and over 100 [http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Columns.html ''Random Thoughts''] columns in the quarterly journal ''Chemical Engineering Education''. His research and publications deal with many aspects of teaching and learning, with his primary emphasis being on [http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Student-Centered.html student-centered instructional methods] including ''active learning'' (involving students in course-relevant activities during classes rather than relying entirely on lecturing as the medium of instruction) and ''cooperative learning'' (getting students to complete assignments and projects in teams under conditions that include holding all team members individually accountable for all of the work done). For Dr. Felder's teaching philosophy, see [http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Papers/LiberatoInterview(JSciEd).pdf "An Interview with Richard M. Felder"], which appeared in the ''Journal of Science Education'', (2002), vol. 3, no. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;62–65.

===Faculty development===
Felder has given over 300 education-related seminars and—with his wife and colleague, [http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Rebecca.html Dr. Rebecca Brent]—over 300 [https://educationdesignsinc.com/workshops/ teaching workshops] on campuses throughout the United States and abroad. He is the co-founder (with Dr. James Stice) of the ''National Effective Teaching Institute'' sponsored by the [[American Society for Engineering Education]], and co-directed it from 1991 through 2015. The NETI has been given every year since its inaugural offering, reaching over 1000 participants from more than 200 universities and colleges.

===Index of Learning Styles===
Felder co-developed and validated an on-line instrument called the [https://educationdesignsinc.com/index-of-learning-styles/ ''Index of Learning Styles''] that assesses students' preferences on four dimensions of a [http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Learning_Styles.html learning styles] model he had previously co-developed with Dr. Linda K. Silverman. The instrument is accessed by close to a million users every year.

==History of the School==
[[File:Sir bernard lovell photo.jpg|thumb|Sir [[Bernard Lovell]] (1913-2012) is part of a long and distinguished history of Physics in Manchester going back to 1874.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;]]
The school has origins dating back to 1874 when [[Balfour Stewart]] was appointed the first [[Langworthy Professor]] of Physics at [[Victoria University of Manchester|Owens College, Manchester]]. Stewart was the first to identify an electrified atmospheric layer (now known as the [[ionosphere]]) which could distort the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. The theory of the ionosphere was postulated by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1839, Stewart published the first experimental confirmation of the theory in 1878.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; Since then, the school has hosted many award-winning scientists&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; including:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25944">'''Stanislas Idzikowski''' (1894 – 12 February 1977) was a [[Polish National Ballet|Polish dancer]] and [[ballet master]], active in England, and with such historic companies as [[Anna Pavlova|Pavlova]]'s, [[Ballets Russes]], and [[Vic-Wells]]. During his performance career, 1910-1933, he became famous for his brilliant classical technique, and for the development of ballet roles. With [[Cyril W. Beaumont|Beaumont]] he co-authored an influential book on the [[Enrico Cecchetti|Cecchetti Method]], still in print. He later taught dance in London.

==His start in ballet: Warsaw to London==
Born in [[Warsaw]] Stanisław Idzikowski at the age of ten began his formal dance training, at the ballet school of the [[Teatr Wielki, Warsaw|Wielki Theatre]] in his native city.&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont (1926), p.1. Inspired seeing a [[Tchaikovsky]] ballet, he sought ballet school. His father was a sculpture.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his early instructors was the Italian dancer and teacher [[Enrico Cecchetti]], who would later prove important for his professional life.&lt;ref&gt;Koegler (1977). p.269 (Idzikowski: Teatr Wielki, Cecchetti), p.110 (Cecchetti: moves to Teatr Wielki in 1902).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Enrico Cecchetti" at Cecchetti website: at Teatro Wielki 1902-1905.&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied with Stanislav Gilbert and Anatole Vilzak.&lt;ref&gt;"Stanislas Idzidkowski" at ''Cecchetti'' website: teachers.&lt;/ref&gt; Auguste Berger a [[Bohemia]]n then instructed him which led to his stage debut in ''Ali Baba'', a ballet [[divertissement]].&lt;ref&gt;Related perhaps to the [[opéra bouffe]] [[Ali-Baba (Lecocq)|Ali Baba]] by [[Charles Lecocq]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Idzikowski was sixteen, he relocated to England, and Anglicized his given name Stanisław to Stanislas. His performing career in [[West End of London|London's West End]] then began, doing musical and ballet productions, e.g., [[The Belle of New York (musical)|''The Belle of New York'']] in 1911. He danced in the touring company of Russian ballet star [[Anna Pavlova]] in 1912. He traveled to [[Lausanne]] in 1914 where he met the impresario [[Sergei Diaghilev]]. Cecchetti then recommended him for the [[Ballets Russes]]; he soon became a leading dancer.&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont (1926), pp. 1-2: Berger, debut, London, ''Belle'', Pavlova, Diaghilev, Cecchetti. The company then left to tour America.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Reference: Cecchetti, London's Empire Theatre 1911, Pavlova 1912, Kosloff 1913, Ballets Russes 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (1998), Wielki, Cecchetti, Anglicized name, West End, Ballets Russes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Stanislas Idzikowski" at ''Cecchetti'' website: re Pavlova, Ballets Russes.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Diaghilev's ''Ballets Russes''==
[[File:Russia-2000-stamp-Sergei Diaghilev.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, Russian stamp. Idzikowski danced here, 1914-1924, 1925-1929.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Reference: years at Ballets Russes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Contra'': Koegler (1977), p.269 (at BR: 1914-1926, 1928-1929).&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
[[File:Sergei Diaghilev 01.jpg|thumb|150px|Diaghilev 1872-1929.]]

A small, muscular man, Idzikowski had developed a strong classical ballet technique and was capable of performing virtuosic feats.&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont (1926), pp. 2, 4 (technique).&lt;/ref&gt; With the Diaghilev company, he first assumed roles made famous by [[Vaslav Nijinsky]],&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Reference: "Though unusually short he was a dazzling virtuoso with an extraordinary jump, and took over many of Nijinski's roes... ."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (2005): [[Léonide Massine]] was also a "a replacement for Nijinsky" (p.60).  Massine the dancer "took over Nijinsky's roles in ''[[Petrouchka]]'', [[Cleopatra ballet|''Cléopâtra'']], [[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|''Schéhérazade'']], and [[Afternoon of a Faun (Nijinsky)|''L'Après-midi d'un Faune'']]" (p. 185).&lt;/ref&gt; its former star performer and a world celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (2014), p.5: "Vaslav Nijinsky, possibly the greatest genius of twentieth century dance".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Nijinska (1981), pp. 472-487: Nijinsky's departure from Ballets Russes in 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in choreographer [[Michel Fokine]]'s ballets Idzikowski danced: the role of [[Harlequin]] in [[Carnaval (Schumann)|''Le Carnaval'']]; in [[Petrushka (ballet)|''Petrushka'']], the title role; and in ''[[Le Spectre de la Rose]]'', the Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont (1926), p.2: Idzikowski's first roles at Ballets Russes: Carnaval, Petrushka, Rose.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Stanislas Idzikowski'' at ''Cecchetti'' website: his roles.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balanchine (1954), per Nijinsky's roles in ''Le Carnaval'' p.79, ''Petrouchka'' p.268, ''Le Spectre de la Rose'' p.356.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet their interpretive approach could differ. As Harlequin, Nijinsky expressed a "spirit of subtle mockery and cynical worldly wisdom". While Idzikowski, according to [[Cyril W. Beaumont|Beaumont]], danced the part with a "mischievous certainty, but always good natured".&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont (1926), p.3 (quotes per Harlequin in ''Le Carnaval'').&lt;/ref&gt;  

&lt;blockquote&gt;These roles "previously seemed the particular property of that great genius Nijinsky. Few things are more unnerving to a dancer than to execute a dance which the public is accustomed to see performed by someone else."&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont (1926), p.2 (quote per Nijinsky).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Adams: At first many saw Idzikowski as "the understudy to Nijinsky, but [he] was as good, in every way, as the great man himself."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Idzikowshi was particularly celebrated for his phenomenal ''elevation'' and dazzling ''batterie''.&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont (1926), pp. 2, 4, 5: classical ballet technique.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Reference: technique.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant (1950, 1982), ''elevation'' p.45 ("the height attained in springing steps [jumps]"), ''batterie'' pp. 22-23 ("legs beat together, or one leg beats against the other"), ''beats'' p.23 ("during a jump by striking the calves sharply together").&lt;/ref&gt; As before him Cecchetti in 1890, and Nijinsky in 1907, Idzikowski in 1921 performed as the Blue Bird in the [[pas de deux]] from [[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|''The Sleeping Beauty'']] of [[Tchaikovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Balanchine (1954), pp. 336-354: ''The Sleeping Beaty''; at p.353: Nijinsky in 1911 in the ''pas de deus'' [as the Blue Bird]; at 336, 475: Idzikowski as Blue Bird in London 1921; at 348: the Blue Bird role.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nijinska (1982), pp. 207-210: Nijinsky as Blue Bird in 1907 at [[Maryinsky Theatre]], Sankt-Peterberg; Cecchetti as Blue Bird in 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont (1926), p.4: Idzikowski and ''[[La Belle au Bois Dormant]]'', p. 3: ''La Princesse Echantée''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (1989), pp. 342-344, at 343 ([[Lydia Lopokova]] and Idzikowski in ''The Sleeping Princess''), cf. pp. 408-409.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greskovic (2000), p.71, the 1890 choreography for Cecchetti's Blue Bird was likely devised by the dancer-teacher himself." Cf. 291-292, 425.&lt;/ref&gt; "[His] most famous role was the Blue Bird in ''The Sleeping Princess'' of 1921" premiering in London.&lt;ref&gt;Koegler (1977), quote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Possessed of a strong sense of comedy and drama, he also became known for the character roles he created in the ballets of [[Léonide Massine]], including the role of the Cat in [[Kikimora]] (1916), Battista in [[The Good-Humoured Ladies|''Les Femmes de Bonne Humeur'']] (1917), the Spark (Dandy) in [[El sombrero de tres picos|''Le Tricorne'']] (1919), the Snob in ''[[La Boutique Fantasque]]'' (1919),&lt;ref&gt;Massine (1968), pp. 135-136. The choreographer Massine provides this description of a scene from the ballet ''La Boutique Fantasque'' where toys come to life. Idzi played the 'snob': 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When he was given a slice of melon, Idzikowski, in a brilliant extempore piece of miming, ate it as if playing on a mouth-organ. To shatter his conceit I made the melon-seller knock him over with the barrow, but springing into the air, he came to rest with a bow and one hand raised to twirl his mustache."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balanchine (1954), p.58, describes the same scene in another version: a melon hawker slices a piece for the snob who soon "trips over the hawker, only to rise again in a mechanical miracle."&lt;/ref&gt; and Corviello in [[Pulcinella (ballet)|''Pulcinella'']] (1920).&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont (1926), pp. 3-5 (the five ballet roles).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (1989), pp. 406-408 (the five ballets, plus ''The Sleeping Princess''). Kikimora in 1917 incorporated into ''Contes Russes'' (p.406) aka ''Children's Tales'' (p.336).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Reference (the five ballets).&lt;/ref&gt; Among his other original roles was the Cock on his perch in [[Renard (Stravinsky)|''Le Renard'']] (1923), [[choreography|choreographed]] by [[Bronislava Nijinska]].&lt;ref&gt;Baer (1986), p.74 (''Le Renard'', music by [[Igor Stravinsky]]), cf. pp. 29-30. For Ballets Russes' ''Les Fâcheux'' (1924), "Stanislas Idzikowski the bravura dancer [was] cast by Nijinska as Lysandre the dancing master." Yet because a dispute arose over the costume's wet dye, Diaghilev asked Nijinska to dance this amusing character, originally created by [[Molière]] (Baer, p.41).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (1989), p.409: Nijinska as the Fox, Idzikowski as the Cock, in ''Le Renard'' (1923).&lt;/ref&gt;

Having briefly left Ballets Russes in 1924, Idzikowski in 1925 rejoined the company.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Reference. He and [[Lydia Lopokova]] left &lt;/ref&gt; He danced with [[Alexandra Danilova]] in its production of [[Jack in the Box (Satie)|Jack in the Box]], with music by the late [[Erik Satie]], choreography by [[George Balanchine]].&lt;ref&gt;Koegler (1977), p.277: ''Jack in the Box''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (1989), p.409: "Jack in the Box" with [[Alexandra Danilova|Danilova]] and Idzikowski.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Balanchine Catalogue'' website. He created the role of the Puppet.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kochno (1970), p.243, ''Jack in the Box''.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Sergei Diaghilev]] unexpectedly died in 1929, however, the ballet world lost not only the gifted impresario, but also his company as "the Ballets Russes collapsed".&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (1989), pp. 157 (quote). Diaghilev's death caught the company "unawares" and resulted in its "demise" (p.376).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koegler (1977), p. 50: For 20 years Diaghilev led "the ballet of his time in all its forms, until his death in 1929, after which [his] company dissolved."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soirées de Paris, Vic-Wells, other posts==
[[File:Lydia Lopokova 1922.jpg|thumb|150px|Lydia Lopokova in 1922]]

In 1924, both on leave from Ballets Russes, Idzikowski appeared with his frequent dance partner [[Lydia Lopokova]] at the [[London Coliseum]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Preference: "He left the [Ballets Russes] company in 1924 to dance with Lopokova at the Coliseum and with Comte de Beaumont's ‘Soirées de Paris’."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' obituary: paired with Lopokova.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Garafola (1989), p.216: Coliseum.&lt;/ref&gt; She also was drawn to Soirées de Paris, a new dance enterprise organized by Étienne de Beaumont.&lt;ref&gt;A Beaumont different from the co-author of Cecchetti book.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a potential competitor of Diaghilev. "Artistic considerations" caused Lopokova to respond "with enthusiasm to [[Léonide Massine|Massine]]'s offer of a place in his new company." Idzikowski also signed. Massine at Soirée de Paris wrote choreography for new ballets, including [[Mercure (ballet)|''Mercure'']]. [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] designed decor. Staged in Paris, it was the Soirée's first and only season.&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (2005), pp. 171 (quotes), 172 ("Stas", too), 173-178 (Massine), 175, 176, 177 ("Stas"). Soirées de Paris was similar to [[Ballets Suédois]], both being newly founded competitors of Ballets Russes (pp. 171, 177).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kochno (1970), pp. 256-257 (re ''Mercure''). Though friends Diaghilev looked on "Beaumont as a rival". Besides his closest collaborators, "The leading dancers of the new company were Lopoukhova and Idzikowski and the ballet master was Massine, all deserters from his own group" (.p.256). ''Soirées'' was short-lived; ''Mercure'' then entered Diaghilev's repertoire (p.257).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massine (1968), pp. 158-160, 162. For Soirées de Paris, Massine wrote five ballets (p.158), including ''Mercure'' (p,159-160). He fails to mention competition with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koegler (1977), p.491: Les Soirées de Paris of 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;  

"As a guest artist with the [[Vic-Wells|Vic‐Wells Ballet]] in the early 1930's, Mr. Idzikowski lent the prestige of his name to the struggling young company that is now Britain's [[The Royal Ballet|Royal Ballet]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' obituary: quote re Vic-Wells.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Reference: Idikowski as 'guest artist' at Vic-Wells.&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the lead male role in ''Les Rendezvous'', a ballet-divertissement choreographed by [[Frederick Ashton|Ashton]], mounted in 1933. "The leading pair of 'lovers' was performed by [[Alicia Markova]] and Stanislas Idzikowski."&lt;ref&gt;Grekovic (2000), p.88 (quote re ''Les Rendezvous'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balanchine (1954), pp. 309-310: Markova and Idzikowski.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koegler (1977), p.439: Idzikowski in ''Les Rendezvous''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vic-Wells company was directed by [[Ninette de Valois|de Valois]], an 'alumnus' of Ballets Russes.&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (1989), pp. 376-377: Diaghilev alumni.&lt;/ref&gt; For Vic-Wells, Idzikowski also performed his well-known Blue Bird role in the revised, one-act  [[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|''Aurora's Wedding'']], and his Harlequin in [[Carnaval (ballet)|''Carnaval'']].&lt;ref&gt;David Adams, "Stanislas Idzikowski".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Baer (1986), pp. 28, 29: [[Bronislava Nijinska|Nijinska]]'s 1922 choreography of the one-act ballet ''Aurora's Wedding'' from the five-act ''The Sleeping Princess''.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1928 to 1930 Idzikowski had managed and directed his own ballet company.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Reference: Stanislas Idzikowski.&lt;/ref&gt; He later associated with the commercial production of films: ''The Gods Go a-Begging'' (1934),&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Koegler (1977), p.224.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carnival (1935 film)|''Carnival'']] (1935), and ''[[Peg of Old Drury]]'' (1935).&lt;ref&gt;''Stanislas Idzikowski'' at IMDb (3 films).&lt;/ref&gt; For several years starting in 1939, Idzikowski served as ballet master for [[Mona Inglesby]]'s [[International Ballet]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Independent'' obituary: Mona Inglesby.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book with Beaumont on Cecchetti==
[[File:Enrico Cecchetti -circa 1900.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cecchetti, c.1900]]

In 1918 [[Enrico Cecchetti]] (1850-1928), by then a renowned dancer, ballet master and pedagogue,&lt;ref&gt;Homans (2010), pp. 241-242. Cecchetti had "taught most of Diaghilev's [Ballets Russes] dancers' (pp. 291-292).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balanchine (1954), p.471.&lt;/ref&gt; opened a school in London. Idzikowski, his former student, joined a group of friends and associates in strongly advocating his 'Russo-Italian' method of training students. At Cecchetti's urging, Idzikowski then started to work with the maestro,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Massine (1968), pp. 167-168 (Idzikowski and Cecchetti re the book).&lt;/ref&gt; and later with the balletomane [[Cyril W. Beaumont]], to preserve and codify the [[Cecchetti method]] of teaching. Until then it had been largely developed and handed down orally. &lt;ref&gt;"Cyril Beaumont" at ''Cechetti'' website: method's evolution dated back to 1820s and [[Carlo Blasis]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonstration of basic positions and exercises were made by Cecchetti and by Idzikowski, with commentary, which were then drawn by [[Randolph Schwabe]] and reduced by Beaumont to a written text. The collaboration resulted in the co-authorship by Beaumont and Idzikowski of a technical manual, completed in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont and Idzikowski (1922, rev'd 1932; reprint 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Cyril Beaumont" at ''Cechetti'' website: a more detailed and slightly different narration of book's composition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Enrico Cecchetti" at ''Cecchetti'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' obituary: book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balanchine (1954), p.475: 1922 book.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[E]ach pupil is constructed differently, both physically and temperamentally, so that each requires adaptations of the lesson in order to supply his own particular needs."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"What then ar the qualifications of an experienced professor? First, his school-the sources of his own knowledge. Second, his reputation as a teacher and his distinction as a dancer. Third, his personal qualities; he should be conscientious, patient, and a good disciplinarian. Fourth, his capacity both as a practical demonstrator and theoretical exponent. ..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[A]s your experience increases, you may with advantage study the sister arts of mime, music, painting, drawing, and sculpture. ... Seek to discover why these works afford your pleasure. Thus you will learn what is meant by grace and beauty. Endeavor to apply these same principles to your own art." &lt;ref&gt;Beaumont and Idzikowski (2003), pp. 18 and 20 (quotes).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, the London dancer [[Celia Franca]] became a dance student of Idzikowsky.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose &amp; Franca (1954, 1974), p. [vii]: "This book is dedicated to ''M. STANISLAS IDZIKOWSKI as a small token of our respect, esteem, and affection by'' Celia Franca ''(his grateful pupil), and'' Kay Ambrose ''(his sincere admirer)''."&lt;/ref&gt; Franca became the first artistic director of the [[National Ballet of Canada]] and co-founded the [[National Ballet School of Canada]]; both institutions use the Cecchetti method. In 1922 Beaumont moved to found the [[Cecchetti Society]],&lt;ref&gt;"Cyril Beaumont" at ''Cechetti'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; which merged with the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|ISTD]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Koegler (1977), p.110.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As ballet teacher in London==
Acting as ballet master he had instructed performers in various ballet companies. From 1933 he had taught, eventually from his own dance studio in London. There he was accompanied on piano by his longtime partner Wanda Evina (1891-1966). Since 1916 they had been romantically linked. Evina was British, a professional dancer, and an accomplished pianist.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolova (1960, 1989), Wanda Evina: girlfriend of Stanislas in 1916, p.86; Ballets Russes dancer, pp. 102, 136, 229.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Stanislas Idzikowski" at (''Cecchetti'' website} by Scott. "Madame Evina danced with Idzi in the Diaghilev Company" and later became the pianist at his studio.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked also with the [[Royal Academy of Dance]].&lt;ref&gt;"Stanislas Idzikowski"" at (''Cecchetti'' website) by Adams.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Reference: teaching.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among his students was [[Margot Fonteyn]]. She remembered him as a guest teacher during her early years at [[Sadler's Wells]] under [[Ninette de Valois]], which would have been in the mid 1930s: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"My favorite was Stanislas Idzikowski, affectionately known as Idzi, a brilliant dancer who had been with the Diaghilev Ballet. He was diminutive, dapper, and precise, speaking rather good English with a clipped Polish accent. Severe but never unkind, he knew exactly what he expected of his students and explained clearly how to achieve it."&lt;ref&gt;Fonteyn (1975, 1976), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the death of Madame Evina, he retired from ballet at age 72.&lt;ref&gt;"Stanislas Idzikowski" at (''Cecchetti'' website) by Adams.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptions of Idzikowsky==

"He is quiet, though animated in conversation, but moody and sensitive in the highest degree." "In stature he is short... . His torso and limbs are those of an athlete. The muscular development of his calves and thighs is extraordinary. ... [His] cheek bones high... , wavy hair... almost white... , [with] deep set, blue eyes."&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont (1926), pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

"He taught class in a suit with the stiff color, the vest, and spats and street shoes. With all this, he could still do a double tour en l'air and land in a perfect fifth."&lt;ref&gt;David Adams, "Stanislas Idzikowski".&lt;/ref&gt;

"How describe those difficult steps performed with an ease which makes them appear elementary to the ordinary spectator, while the professional onlooker, swayed between astonishment and rapture, can scarce believe the evidence of his eyes."&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont (1926), p.4, re the ballet [[Les Sylphides]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Images on-line==
''The Art of Stanislas Idzikowsky'' (London 1926) is a thin volume published in a limited edition of 350 copies, with six visual art works, twelve photographs, and five pages of text. Before the title page comes [[Glyn Philpot]]'s monochrome portrait. The text by [[Cyril W. Beaumont]] then describes Idzikowski in various roles and as a presence in ballet. A sketch by [[Randolph Schwabe]] is of the dancer in costume, seated in his dressing room. Following are four color images of Idzikowski in ballet poses, reproductions of paintings by Vera Willoughby. Lastly, the twelve publicity photographs are of him in various costumes of his choreographed roles.&lt;ref&gt;See below, External Links: ''Art of Stanislas Idzikowsky'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;  

A brief {1:32}, low quality video of Idzikowski and [[Lydia Lopokova]] exists. The two were often paired. Here they are in costume as the Harlequin and Columbine in the ballet ''Le Carnaval''. Lopokova was married to [[John Maynard Keynes]], the English economist.&lt;ref&gt;Homans (2010), pp. 410-411 (husband Keynes).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See External Links: "Ballets Russes on film..." showing a very brief clip, at youtube.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Stargazing Live''''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[live television|live]] [[television programme]] on [[astronomy]] that was broadcast yearly since its first broadcast on [[BBC Two]] in January 2011. The series was primarily presented by scientist [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]] and comedian and amateur astronomer [[Dara Ó Briain]] with support from TV presenter and biochemist [[Liz Bonnin]] and astronomer [[Mark Thompson (astronomer)|Mark Thompson]]. It was broadcast from [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]]&lt;ref name="bbcnews"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/tv_and_radio/newsid_9309000/9309366.stm | title=Jodrell Bank Observatory to host BBC Stargazing Live | date=21 December 2010 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and featured live links from scientific facilities in [[Hawaii]], [[South Africa]], [[Norway]] and [[NASA]].

== Overview ==

The first series was scheduled to coincide with the partial [[Solar eclipse of January 4, 2011|Solar eclipse of 4 January 2011]],&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt; a [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] of [[Jupiter]] and [[Uranus]], and the [[Quadrantids|Quadrantid]] [[meteor shower]].&lt;ref name="bbcscott"&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/northeastscotlandnorthernisles/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_9318000/9318210.stm |title=BBC News - Stargazing Live |work=news.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=4 January 2011 |date=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also featured [[Jonathan Ross]] learning how to spot planets, and a discussion with the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref name="bbcprogrammes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wnvpf/episodes/2011 | title=BBC - Episodes from Stargazing LIVE broadcast in 2011 | publisher=BBC | accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newly qualified British [[European Space Agency|ESA]] astronaut [[Tim Peake]] appeared as a guest.

Scientific advisors for the first series included Dan Hillier, manager of the [[Royal Observatory, Edinburgh]], visitor centre.&lt;ref name="bbcscott" /&gt;

To coincide with each series of the show, hundreds of ''Stargazing Live'' events were run across the UK, including [[star party|star parties]] and '[[sidewalk astronomy]]' sessions. Many of these events were organised by local [[astronomy society|astronomy societies]] and [[university|universities]].&lt;ref name="bbcevents"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/features/stargazing/index.shtml | title=BBC Stargazing Live - Events | publisher=BBC | accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show returned for a second series on 16–18 January 2012. The first episode had a theme about the [[moon]], including a live interview with 'the last man on the moon', [[Apollo 17]] astronaut [[Eugene Cernan]]. The second episode had a focus on [[black holes]], and the third on the possible existence of [[extra-terrestrial life]].&lt;ref name="twitter2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/ProfBrianCox/status/93744450936909824 | title=Brian Cox on Twitter | date=20 July 2011 | accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each episode included different guests, such as [[impressionist]] and amateur astronomer, [[Jon Culshaw]] on the second night. The final episode also included a feature titled the "Great Big Dulverton Switch Off"&lt;ref name="bbcevents" /&gt; where every light in the town of [[Dulverton]], [[Somerset]] was switched off live on TV to highlight the issue of [[light pollution]]. Each episode of the series was immediately followed by ''Back to Earth'', an additional half-hour discussion of the main show.

The second series was a co-production with the [[Open University]], with OU science consultants Dr Andrew Norton, Dr Dave Rothery and Dr Stephen Serjeant.&lt;ref name="ou"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/whats-on/ou-on-the-bbc-stargazing-live | title=OU on the BBC: Stargazing LIVE | publisher=[[Open University]] | date=15 December 2011 | accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2012 series, viewers were encouraged to help locate possible [[exoplanets]], planets orbiting stars outside the [[Solar System]], by volunteering some time on the [[Planet Hunters]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.planethunters.org | title=Planet Hunters | publisher=[[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|Zooniverse]] | accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; online [[citizen science]] project. This led to the discovery of a new [[Neptune]]-sized exoplanet by two amateur astronomers, one in [[Peterborough]], England, to be named [[Threapleton Holmes B]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/9026837/Amateur-stargazers-discover-new-planet.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |title=Amateur stargazers discover new planet |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=20 January 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third series returned with another three episodes. As with the last series, a "Back to Earth" chat was held after each episode. A citizen science project was again featured, this time asking viewers to help in identifying areas of interest in aerial photographs of the surface of [[Mars]]. Another feature which ran across the three nights involved the construction of a modern version of [[William Herschel]]'s 20-foot telescope at the [[University of Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ariel/20970167 | title=BBC builds William Herschel's telescope for Stargazing Live | publisher=BBC | date=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth series appeared in January 2014, with the citizen science project asking viewers to look for evidence of [[gravitational lensing]] in deep space photographs, which resulted in the discovery of dozens of previously unknown galaxies. The series also featured live broadcasts from Norway with the aim of capturing the [[aurora borealis]] on camera; although the show's publicity emphasised that the unpredictable nature of the aurora meant this attempt could easily fail, an unexpectedly large [[coronal mass ejection]] that week resulted in strong auroral activity, with live footage of the phenomenon being captured on all three nights.

Stargazing Live returned in 2015 but it was not held in the usual January slot which has been the usual month for all previous events, it was held on 18 to 20 March instead to coincide with next total solar eclipse &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/StargazingLive |title=BBC Stargazing LIVE |work=Facebook |date= |accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redditchastro.org.uk/?p=1511 |title=BBC Stargazing Live 2015 |work=Redditch Astronomical Society |date= |accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herts.ac.uk/bayfordbury/visit-bayfordbury-observatory/public-open-evenings |title=Bayfordbury Observatory: Public open evenings |work=University of Hertfordshire |date= |accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which took place on 20 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEgoogle/SEgoogle2001/SE2015Mar20Tgoogle.html |title=Total Solar Eclipse of 2015 March 20 |work=Heliophysics Science Division, NASA |date= |accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2015, the BBC confirmed two special episodes of ''Stargazing Live'' which aired on 15 December 2015, with Dara Ó Briain and Professor Brian Cox, covering the launch of [[Expedition 46]] to the [[International Space Station]] with British [[astronaut]] [[Tim Peake]] aboard. The first special entitled ''Blast Off Live: A Stargazing Special'' covered the launch of Expedition 46 at 11:05&amp;nbsp;am. A latter programme ''Stargazing Live Special: Tim Peake Docking'' covered the missions' docking with the ISS that same evening.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/bbc-tim-peake |title=Tim Peake - Britain’s first International Space Station astronaut – on the BBC |date= 6 November 2015 |accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously the BBC confirmed a sixth series of ''Stargazing Live'', which began in January 2016, featuring coverage of Tim Peake aboard the International Space Station.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

The seventh series of Stargazing Live was broadcast from Australia on March 18–20, 2017, taking advantage of the Equinox to match the last three-quarters of an hour of darkness in Australia or an 8:00pm broadcast time in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b019h4g8 |title=Stargazing Live |work=BBC Two |accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stargazing Live in Australia==
In 2017, following on from the seventh series of BBC Stargazing Live in Australia, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC TV]] broadcast  an Australia-focused series on 4–6 April 2017, co-anchored by Brian Cox and Australian television presenter [[Julia Zemiro]] and featuring [[Kumi_Taguchi_(journalist)|''Kumi Taguchi'']]. The BBC Australian program was similar to the UK format, as the hosts were joined by professional astrophysicists such as [[Lisa Harvey-Smith]] and [[Chris Lintott]], amateur astronomer Greg Quicke, and Indigenous Australian Michael Anderson who shared the astronomical knowledge of Indigenous Australians and their connection with the cosmos. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tv.press.abc.net.au/abc-presents-stargazing-live |title=ABC presents Stargazing Live
 |work=ABC |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second Australian series aired on 22-24 May, 2018. It featured a Guinness World Record for the most people simultaneously observing an object in the night sky, when approximately 40,000 registered citizens watched the moon for 10 minutes on the 23rd May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-24/stargazing-world-record-announcement/9797184 |title=Stargazing Live breaks world record for most people looking at the night sky at once |work=ABC |accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Susan Campbell Bartoletti''' (born 1958) is an American writer of [[children's literature]] whose work includes ''[[Kids on Strike!]]'' and ''[[Hitler Youth: Growing Up in Hitler's Shadow]]''.

She was born in [[Harrisburg]], [[Pennsylvania]], but eventually the family ended up in a small town in northeastern Pennsylvania. She graduated from the [[University of Scranton]] in 1982.

Campbell Bartoletti began her career as an eighth-grade English teacher before deciding to pursue writing in earnest. Seeing her student write and create original work, she was inspired to create her own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Susan Campbell Bartoletti|url = http://www.scbartoletti.com/?page_id=2|website = www.scbartoletti.com|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In connection with her students, Susan said that "I felt immense satisfaction in watching my students grow as writers. I wanted to practice what I preached, so I joined a writers group and got serious about my own writing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Susan Campbell Bartoletti's Biography {{!}} Scholastic.com|url = http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/contributor/susan-campbell-bartoletti|website = Scholastic Teachers|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sold her first short story in 1989. Three years later, in 1992, Campbell Bartoletti published her first [[picture book]], ''Silver at Night.'' She held a rigid routine, waking early in the morning in order to write before she left to teach. In 1997, she turned to writing full-time. Since then, her works have received a number of awards, including the NCTE Orbis Pictus Award for Nonfiction, the SCBWI Golden Kite Award for Nonfiction, the Jane Addams Children's Book Award, and the Newberry Honor Medal in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Susan Campbell Bartoletti's Biography {{!}} Scholastic.com|url = http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/contributor/susan-campbell-bartoletti|website = Scholastic Teachers|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Rough Guide to True Crime''''' is a non-fiction paperback reference guide to national and international true crime cases by American [[True crime|crime writer]] [[Cathy Scott]]. It was released in the UK and US in August 2009 by [[Penguin Books]] through its [[Rough Guides]] imprint.

== Summary ==
''The Rough Guide to True Crime'' is a compilation of a variety of cases, including historic crimes, with sections broken down by the type of offenses and who committed them. It includes black-and-white photos as illustration. Psychological profiles are included throughout by forensic expert Dr. Louis B. Schlesinger, who explains the psychology of serial killers, murderers, hit men and burglars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/Cathy-Scott/The-Rough-Guide-to-True-Crime/6708060/ True crime Reviews: ''The Rough Guide to True Crime'' (Book) by Cathy Scott (2009): reviews.waterstones.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The book features [[serial killer]] [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], mob hitman [[Richard Kuklinski|Richard "The Iceman" Kuklinski]], [[John Wayne Glover]] "The Granny Killer," and British "Doctor of Death" [[Harold Shipman]].

Scott's story from ''The Rough Guide to True Crime'' about mob enforcer [[Herbert Blitzstein]] was selected for inclusion in the July 2012 retrospective of crime writing, ''[[Masters of True Crime|Masters of True Crime: Chilling Stories of Murder and the Macabre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebigthrill.org/2012/07/masters-of-true-crime-by-r-barri-flowers-editor/ ''The Big Thrill'' magazine, "Masters of True Crime by R. Barri Flowers (Editor)"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The author appeared on [[BlogTalkRadio]]'s "True Murder" show and described some of the crimes included in the book that were committed in the 19th century as "a different time in America, where people like [[Billy the Kid]] could walk in and just rob a bank" and get away with it. And while "there was nothing glamorous about what they did, they are a part of lore."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blogtalkradio.com/dan-zupansky1/2010/01/28/true-murder-episode-1-diane-fanning-baby-be-mine True Murder-Episode 3-Cathy Scott; ''The Rough Guide to True Crime'' 01/27 by True Murder | Blog Talk Radio&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
The book was featured at [[BookExpo America]] 2009's trade fair in [[Dorling Kindersley|DK Publishing]]'s booth in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/trade-shows-events/article/14565-bookexpo-america-2009-around-the-bea-booths-c-d.html ''Publishers Weekly'': BookExpo America 2009: Around the BEA Booths: C - D&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review, ''[[True Crime Zine|True Crime Book Reviews]]'' wrote, "From the Moors murders and Harold Shipman, to the murder of 2pac, this guide illuminates the psychology in play behind the most intriguing crimes in history, from the absurd to the appalling. ''The Rough Guide to True Crime'' explores the best of the haunting genre of True Crime."&lt;ref&gt;[http://truecrimebookreviews.blogspot.com/2009/05/new-true-crime-books-august-2009.html ''True Crime Book Reviews'': New True Crime Books August 2009&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faculty of Law===
The [[Université de Moncton École de droit|University of Moncton's Faculty of Law]] is one of only two French-language [[common law]] schools in the world. (The [[University of Ottawa]] also offers a common law education in French.) The school was founded in 1978 in order to respond to the needs of francophone communities outside Quebec. As Quebec practices [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], there was a need to instruct francophone lawyers in common law to practice in other parts of Canada. The University of Ottawa law school teaches both common and civil law, as does McGill; thus the University of Moncton's Faculty of Law is the only exclusively French, exclusively common law school in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.umoncton.ca/droit/Information__generale/Introduction.html |title=Université de Moncton, Campus de Moncton – Faculté de droit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=17 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014043507/http://www.umoncton.ca/droit/Information__generale/Introduction.html |archive-date=14 October 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

U de M offers both the [[Juris Doctor|JD]] and the graduate [[Master of Laws|LLM]]. The school also offers joint degrees: the JD-[[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] (Masters of Business) and JD-MEE (Masters of Environmental Studies). As well, students who already possess a civil law degree (an [[LL.L]] or a [[Bachelor of Civil Law|BCL]]) from a Canadian school can enroll at U de M for two semesters to complete an LLB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.umoncton.ca/droit/imgs_demande/02Conditionsetpolitiquesgeneralesdadmission.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327055532/http://www0.umoncton.ca/droit/imgs_demande/02Conditionsetpolitiquesgeneralesdadmission.pdf |archive-date=27 March 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical Training Centre===

The '''École des technologies numériques appliquées''' ('''ETNA''') is a [[France|French]] private school in [[computer science]] localized at [[Ivry-sur-Seine]]. Created in 2005 by Patrice Dumoucel, the school since 2006 is part of [[IONIS Education Group]]. The certification delivered by the school are recognized by the [[France|French state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://textes.droit.org/JORF/2010/07/22/0167/0008 Arrêté du 12 juillet 2010 portant enregistrement au répertoire national des certifications professionnelles]&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://textes.droit.org/JORF/2010/07/22/0167/ Journal officiel de la République Française du 22 juillet 2010, édition n°167]&lt;/ref&gt;

The school is from the same group as [[École Pour l'Informatique et les Techniques Avancées|EPITA]] and [[École pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies|EPITECH]]. The partnership ETNA/EPITA/EPITECH allows students to use the equipment to the two other universities. ETNA graduates can proceed to others courses at the [[IONIS School of Technology and Management]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.ionis-stm.com/ IONIS School of Technology and Management]&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[Master's in business administration|MBA]] at the ''[[Institut supérieur de gestion]]''. Students of ETNA can prepare major certifications  ([[Microsoft]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[Oracle Database|Oracle]]).

== Curriculum ==

The course is a three-year [[dual education system]] and includes 200 hours of lessons and 400 hours of practical cases study per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.capcampus.com/mba-458/etna-ecole-des-technologies-numeriques-appliquees-o20371.htm ETNA, Ecole des technologies numériques appliquées]&lt;/ref&gt;
Two specializations are available : [[software development]] or system and [[computer network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.jobingenieur.com/ETNA ETNA ECOLE DES TECHNOLOGIES NUMÉRIQUES APPLIQUÉES]&lt;/ref&gt;

Students choose one of these two in the second year.

The main lessons of the first year of study offers the following subjects:  [[management]], [[database]], [[IPv4]] network, web technologies, system administration, PHP / [[World Wide Web|web]], culture [[computer]], English, [[mathematics]] and method.
The second year can address the following topics: project, business valuation, English, [[mathematics]], drafting and document analysis, and [[marketing]] / business / management.
During the last year, the curriculum includes the subjects: project, English, [[mathematics]], drafting and document analysis, [[marketing]] / business / management and [[psychology]] work.

Since September 2013, the school will start a new program in 2 years after French ''[[Baccalauréat]]'' which will be entirely free. 250 tickets are available. The innovation is that there are graduate students who will pay for the students in training (250 euros per month during three years).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.meltycampus.fr/ionis-group-evoque-son-avenir-a158109.html Ionis Education Group évoque son avenir]&lt;/ref&gt;
