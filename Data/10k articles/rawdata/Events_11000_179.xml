In November 2010, there was a '''major security crisis''' in the Brazilian city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and some of its neighboring cities. The city's criminal drug trafficking factions initiated a series of attacks in response to the government placing permanent police forces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2010/11/25/rio-de-janeiro-vive-guerra-contra-o-trafico-ataques-a-veiculos-continuam.jhtm|title=Rio de Janeiro vive guerra contra o tráfico; ataques a veículos continuam|publisher=noticias.uol.com.br|date= November 25, 2010|accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; into Rio's slums.

In response to the attacks, the local police forces with the aid of the [[Brazilian Army]] and [[Brazilian Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] initiated a large scale offensive against two of the largest drug trafficking headquarters in the city, located in the Vila Cruzeiro and the neighboring [[Complexo do Alemão]]. The operation is considered a success by the government and local media and a large quantity of illegal drugs, weapons and money were confiscated.

==Overview==
Violent acts by drug dealers consisted of incinerating cars, buses and trucks on the streets (over 181 motor vehicles were incinerated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jb.com.br/rio/noticias/2010/11/29/ataques-contra-veiculos-cessaram-desde-a-noite-de-domingo/|title=Ataques contra veículos cessaram desde a noite de domingo|publisher=jb.com.br|date= December 2, 2010|accessdate=December 2, 2010|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and armed conflicts between the police and the [[drug dealers]] at different places of those cities. Being an elevated emergency situation, the local police, along with the [[Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais|BOPE]], the [[Brazilian Army]], and the [[Brazilian Marine Corps]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,beltrame-agradece-marinha-por-carros-blindados,645277,0.htm|title=Beltrame agradece Marinha e diz que operações no Rio vão continuar|publisher=Estadão.com.br|date= November 25, 2010|accessdate=November 27, 2010|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been summoned in order to restore the peace in the city and counter-attack the drug traffickers by taking control of their headquarters in the favelas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/world/americas/29brazil.html?ref=drug_abuse_and_traffic|title=Brazilian Forces Claim Victory in Gang Haven|publisher=New York Times|date=November 28, 2010 |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; located at the group of slums named [[Complexo do Alemão]], which was finally taken by the police around 10:00 am of November, 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/rio/mat/2010/11/28/policia-invade-complexo-do-alemao-923129542.asp|title=Polícia invade Complexo do Alemão|publisher=www.g1.globo.com|date= November 28, 2010|accessdate=November 28, 2010|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/fuerzas/brasilenas/toman/control/favela/Rio/apenas/resistencia/elpepuint/20101128elpepuint_1/Tes|title=Las fuerzas brasileñas toman el control de la favela de Río sin apenas resistencia|publisher=El País|date= November 28, 2010|accessdate=November 28, 2010|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the favela violence, over 40 people (almost all of them criminals) had been killed in the conflict&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sic.sapo.pt/online/noticias/mundo/violencia+entre+policia+e+traficantes+no+rio+de+janeiro+ja+fez+39+mortos.htm|title=Violência entre polícia e traficantes no Rio de Janeiro já fez 39 mortos|publisher=www.sic.sapo.pt/online/homepage|date= November 26, 2010|accessdate=November 27, 2010|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 200 people arrested. Though the attacks ended, the police and military forces still occupy the [[Complexo do Alemão]], the largest favela in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

==Timeline of the crisis==
;November 21
:In the afternoon, six heavily armed individuals incinerated two cars at [[Linha Vermelha]], one of Rio's most important highways. Since then similar attacks started occurring throughout the city and another group of criminals opened fire against a [[Brazilian Air Force]] Vehicle.
;November 22
:A police captain was shot at Dom Helder Camara Avenue. In addition to the attacks on cars, mass robberies happen in some streets. The government implies that "a small criminal faction" is responsible for the attacks and patrolling is increased. Three people were killed.
;November 23
:A large scale operation from Rio's Military police invaded several slums of the city in search of those responsible for the series of attacks. Some sources indicate that the order for the attacks came from drug lords imprisoned in the [[Catanduvas prison|Catanduvas Federal Maximum Security Prison]]. Three people died and five were arrested.
;November 24
:The attacks on civilian and police targets intensify. The government declares an order calling all able members of the police force to reinforce patrols including those on license and performing administrative duties. Eight criminals imprisoned in the city responsible for taking part in the crisis are transferred to the Catanduvas Prison. Fifteen suspects were killed and at least thirty were arrested. The local government asked for the [[Brazilian Marine Corps]]' support to launch a counter offensive on the criminals.
;November 25
:The Rio's Special Task Forces (BOPE) invades one of the city's most dangerous areas at the [[Vila Cruzeiro]] with the aid of several  Marine Corps' armored vehicles. Dozens of criminals desperately fled to their nearby headquarters at the [[Complexo do Alemão]]. Details of the operation, including the criminals' run, are broadcast by the local TV stations to the whole world.
;November 26
:The Brazilian government sent hundreds of soldiers from the Army and members of the Federal Police Force to further increase security in the city and put the Complexo do Alemão under siege. So far more than 100 vehicles were destroyed and around 40 people killed since the start of the crisis. The President [[Luís Inácio Lula da Silva]] declares that the Federal Government fully supports Rio's government to end the situation as soon as possible. Spouses and lawyers of some of the imprisoned leaders of the criminal factions are arrested on suspicion of relaying their orders to start the attacks to their cohorts out of prison.
;November 27
:The Joint task force composed of members of the local police, Army and Marine Corps gives an ultimatum to the criminals at the [[Complexo do Alemão]] to surrender while residents evacuate the premises in spite of the impending invasion. The wave of attacks on civilian targets start to fade.
;November 28
:The Complexo do Alemão is taken over by the police with little resistance, but only a few criminals supposed to be hiding in the place are arrested. Further investigations point that the majority managed to escape through rough terrains around the Complex or through a network of illegal water canals built under the favelas.

===Aftermath===
Just after the occupation of the Complexo do Alemão and Vila Cruzeiro by the Army, the attacks on vehicles stopped and crisis came to an end. The police managed to apprehend around 40 tonnes of [[marijuana]] and 250 kilos of [[cocaine]] along with many other illicit drugs, dozens of weapons including pistols, assault rifles, explosives, machine guns, hundreds of stolen motorcycles and more than 30 stolen cars. The drugs were destroyed while the police were charged with the task of returning the stolen vehicles to their rightful owners. The losses suffered by the criminals are stated to surpass 200 million reais (around 120 million US dollars), not including the confiscated houses belonged to the faction's main leaders, fully equipped with many luxury items including multiple pools, jacuzzis and high level electronic hardware.

Through a deal between the State government and the Federal government, the troops will remain stationed in the occupied area until a permanent police force is installed to maintain security. Despite the fact that most of the criminals managed to escape, the operation is considered by the local media as a major victory against crime in Rio de Janeiro and a turning point in the war against drug trafficking in Brazil.

The '''2016 clown sightings''' were reports of people disguised as armed [[evil clown]]s in incongruous settings, such as near forests and schools. The incidents were reported in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and subsequently in other countries and territories from August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creepy clown sightings reported in more communities in South Carolina|url=http://fox8.com/2016/09/02/creepy-clown-sightings-reported-in-more-communities-in-south-carolina/|publisher=[[WJW (TV)]]|access-date=September 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes article"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rogers|first1=Katie|title=Creepy Clown Sightings in South Carolina Cause a Frenzy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/us/creepy-clown-sightings-in-south-carolina-cause-a-frenzy.html?_r=0|website=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=NYTimes.com|accessdate=September 3, 2016|date=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGurty|first1=Frank|last2=Prentice|first2=Chris|title=Clown sightings spook South Carolina, perplex police|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/clown-sightings-spook-south-carolina-perplex-police-202822588.html|website=[[Yahoo!]]|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=September 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Chris|title=South Carolina Police Chief to Creepy Clowns: 'The Clowning Around Needs to Stop'|url=http://www.people.com/article/south-carolina-police-chief-says-clowning-around-needs-to-stop|website=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=People.com|accessdate=September 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/killer-clowns-inside-the-terrifying-hoax-sweeping-america-w442649|title='Killer Clowns': Inside the Terrifying Hoax Sweeping America|date=2016-09-30|author=Zuppello, Suzanne|work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sightings were first reported in [[South Carolina]] when a 9-year-old boy told his mother that two suspicious males dressed as [[clown]]s tried to lure him into the nearby woods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/05/clown-sightings-south-carolina-alabama|title=Clown sightings: the day it all began|date=2016-10-05|author=Teague, Matthew|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-October 2016, clown sightings and attacks had been reported in nearly all [[U.S. state]]s, 9 out of 13 [[provinces and territories of Canada]], and 18 other countries.

Prior to the spate of incidents in 2016, numerous sightings of people dressed as clowns in odd or incongruous settings have occurred throughout the world since 2013. The proliferation of videos and images of these precursor sightings spread through social media posts and viral sharing of the content, most notably from [[DM Pranks]], a YouTube user from [[Perugia]], Italy.&lt;ref name="DM Pranks"/&gt;

While most of the 2016 incidents appeared to be wholly unsubstantiated or lacked evidence of criminal activity (with many incidents being deemed [[practical jokes]]), a few led to arrests. Some people were cited or arrested for making violent threats to schools, and some incidents involved robberies and assaults on children and adults.&lt;ref name="KOTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newson6.com/story/33402994/pryor-woman-attacked-by-woman-two-men-wearing-clown-masks|title=Pryor Woman Attacked By Woman, Two Men Wearing Clown Masks|date=2016-10-16|publisher=[[KOTV-DT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="concord"/&gt;&lt;ref name="phoenix"/&gt;

By mid-October 2016, in the wake of hundreds of "clown sightings" in the United States and Canada, the phenomenon had spread from North America to Europe, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South America.

==Scope, timeline and effects of sightings==

===Precursor sightings===
One possible precursor event was the 2013 sightings of a "creepy clown" in [[Northampton, England]]. The Northampton clown sightings, which were in the town during September and October 2013, were the work of three local filmmakers Alex Powell, Elliot Simpson, and Luke Ubanski.&lt;ref name="Northampton"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/10/northampton-clown-unmasked/309900/|title=Northampton Solves the Mystery of The Creepy Clown|first=Connor|last=Simpson|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clown shared similar looks to [[It (character)|Pennywise the Dancing Clown]] from Stephen King's book ''It''. The trio started a [[Facebook]] page for the so-called "Northampton clown" and were using the appearances to drive traffic to the page.&lt;ref name="Northampton"/&gt;

In March 2014, Matteo Moroni from [[Perugia]], [[Italy]], owner of the YouTube channel [[DM Pranks]], began dressing up as an evil clown and terrifying unsuspecting passersby, with his videos racking up hundreds of millions of views.&lt;ref name="DM Pranks"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why I am a 'killer clown'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37612735|agency=BBC|date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rash of sightings appeared in [[California]] in October 2014, which centered around the "Wasco clown", and primarily occurred in the [[Wasco, California]] area with photos appearing on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/mysterious-clowns-terrorizing-california-city/story?id=26157014|title=Mysterious Clowns Terrorizing California City|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=13 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person in clown attire was spotted in a cemetery in [[Chicago, Illinois]] in July 2015. This occurrence involved two residents who spotted the "creepy clown" scaling the gate at the Rosehill Cemetery late at night. After the clown entered the cemetery, they turned to face the residents and began waving slowly as they made a video recording. After waving for a few seconds, the clown ran into a dark wooded area and was not seen again. Police investigation of the sighting did not lead to any arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/creepy-clown-trespasses-in-chicago-cemetery_us_55b2810ae4b0224d88322911|title=Creepy Clown Menaces Chicago Cemetery|first1=David Moye|last1=Reporter|first2=The Huffington|last2=Post|date=24 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 sightings and effects===
The 2016 clown phenomenon began in [[Greenville, South Carolina]] in early August, followed by incidents in [[Canada]] shortly afterward. It later spread around the U.S.&lt;ref name="morrisjd"/&gt;

In early October 2016, further incidents were reported in Canada and the first occurrences in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]]. British communities were described as "horrified" and pressure had been placed on police resources.&lt;ref name="Scotland Courier" /&gt;

===Internet===

==Commentary==
Explanations include that some clown sightings were promotional stunts for [[Rob Zombie]]'s ''[[31 (film)|31]]'' or [[Andy Muschietti|Andrés Muschietti]]'s [[It (2017 film)|2017 film adaptation]] of [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[It (novel)|It]]'', both of which feature one or more characters dressed as clowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/07/clown-sightings-have-spread-to-north-carolina-now-police-are-concerned-about-creepy-copycats/|title=Clown sightings have spread to North Carolina.

Author and folklorist [[Benjamin Radford]], who wrote the non-fiction book ''Bad Clowns'', said that the craze could be an example of the "[[snowball effect]]", where rumor and legitimate concerns mix with the human penchant for a good story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/health/creepy-clowns-rumors-trnd/index.html |title=What's with all the clowns everywhere? 6 legit possibilities |author=AJ Willingham |date=5 October 2016 |work=CNN |accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Verge]]'' dismissed the sightings as a case of [[mass hysteria]], stating that a [[Coulrophobia|fear of clown]]s (which is common in children and adults) may be an underlying cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/7/13191788/clown-attack-threats-2016-panic-hoax-debunked |title=The 2016 clown panic: 10 questions asked and answered |author=Angela Chen |date=7 October 2016 |work=The Verge |access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' likewise claimed that "The Great Clown Panic of 2016 has been perpetuated by pretty much everyone except actual clowns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/10/12/13122196/clown-panic-hoax-history |title=The great clown panic of 2016 is a hoax. But the terrifying side of clowns is real. |date=12 October 2016 |access-date=3 November 2016 |author=Aja Romano |work=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Horror Story: Cult|seventh season]] of anthology horror series ''[[American Horror Story]]'' seems to have{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} capitalised on this craze, where the main protagonists are members of a cult which terrorise and murder their victims whilst disguised as clowns.

The year '''652 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]], it was known as '''year 102 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'' '''.

== Events ==

=== Middle East ===

* [[Elam]] withdraws from her [[Military alliance|alliance]] with king [[Shamash-shum-ukin]] of [[Babylon]], who launches a premature attack on his half brother [[Ashurbanipal]] at year's end without waiting for reinforcements that have been promised by the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] king [[Psamtik I]].

=== Asia Minor ===

* Cimmerian forces from [[Anatolia]] conquer [[Sardis]] and reach the peak of their power.

He has helped the rebellion of Psamtik I, but he receives no support from his erstwhile Assyrian ally Ashurbanipal. Gyges falls in a battle against the [[Cimmerians]] under king [[Tugdamme]] (approximate date). 
* [[Ardys of Lydia|Ardys]] succeeds his father Gyges as the second Mermnad king of [[Lydia]]. During his reign he finds payment of [[tribute]] to [[Assyria]] preferable to rule by the Cimmerians, who will be routed a few decades later.

=== Asia ===

'''''Anne de Bretagne''''' is a [[rock opera]] by [[Alan Simon (musician)|Alan Simon]], based on the life of [[Anne of Brittany]]. The story follows the historical events that made her the last Duchess of independent [[Brittany]] and twice-crowned queen of France.

==Background==
In 2007, Alan Simon visited an exhibition about Anne of Brittany at the [[Château des ducs de Bretagne]]. He got the idea to write an opera about Anne after seeing the [[reliquary]] of her heart; he then spent months researching her life. He wanted to write an opera connected to Brittany, and decided on Anne because "in spite of the hundreds of streets, hotels and schools that carried her name, no one knew her story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bringing Anne de Bretagne back|url=http://www.connexionfrance.com/briging-anne-de-bretagne-back-to-life-11224-news-article.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|work=[[The Connexion]]|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the opera based on [[Renaissance music]], [[classical music]] and [[folk rock]].&lt;ref name=Sebillet1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sebillet|first1=Louise|title=La Duchesse Anne célébrée par un rock opéra|url=http://www.ouest-france.fr/la-duchesse-anne-celebree-par-un-rock-opera-2797149|accessdate=11 March 2015|work=[[Ouest-France]]|date=2 September 2014|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performances and recording==
The recording for the studio album took place between August 2007 and February 2009, with more than 200 musicians participating. The first two performances took place on 29 and 30 June 2009, at [[Nantes]], in the courtyard of the [[castle of the Dukes of Brittany]]. On this occasion, the show was played in front of nearly 6000 people. The live show was recorded and later released on CD and DVD. Costumes for the show were designed by Jeanine Lérin-Cagnet and Elise Bossard.

On 5–11 November 2010, a [[folk rock]] version of ''Anne de Bretagne'' was performed in [[Ploemeur]], [[Nantes]], [[Quimper]] and [[Rennes]]. This version had some changes compared to the original show—it was more [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] and did not have the [[bagad]] or symphony orchestra. There was also a new narrator, as [[Jean-Claude Dreyfus]] could not participate in the tour. For this tour, the narrator was Jean-Louis Jossic, who also played the role of Louis XII.

In April 2012, the folk rock version was performed in [[Bouvron, Loire-Atlantique|Bouvron]], [[Romorantin-Lanthenay]], [[Rennes]] and [[Plougastel-Daoulas]]. There were some changes to the original cast, and the title role was played by Bleunwenn Mevel of [[Tri Yann]]. On 22 September 2012, a [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] version was performed in [[Redon]].

On 19 September 2014, the show was performed in [[Vannes]] as part of Celti'Vannes, a Breton cultural festival. The festival coincided with the 500th anniversary of [[Anne of Brittany]]'s death.&lt;ref name=Sebillet1/&gt;

'''Anti-prom''', also known as '''morp''' (''prom'' spelled in reverse), is a social event often staged by [[high school]] [[student]]s as a [[protest]] against, or [[boycott]] of, their school's official [[prom]], as an alternative celebration. Other times, it may be an unofficial prom, planned by the students themselves so that it is not under the control of the school. 

Some of the more common reasons for the creation of an anti-prom include the desire to curb the large cost of a traditional prom, to listen to music other than that expected to be played at the official prom, to have a smaller, more personal get-together, ones that cannot find a date or have been rejected for a prom date, don't like the food, or have looser and less strict rules than the school's (often relating to dress rules or alcohol consumption). {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Another common anti-prom is an unofficial dance set up by freshmen and sophomores as they cannot go to prom without a junior or senior. 

The attendees of an anti-prom usually disagree with the values of the high school [[Youth subculture|in-crowd]] who, stereotypically, organize the prom from the preparatory stages to the after-parties. In particular, anti-prom attendees protest what they regard as the [[vanity]], excess, and conformity that the prom culture expects from students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]| url=http://www.slate.com/id/2129379/|author=Ann Hulbert|title=Take Back the Prom|date=November 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-proms do not follow any prescribed format, catering instead to the varied tastes of the large spectrum of students who feel dissociated from prom culture.  Nevertheless, anti-prom participants are generally concerned with arranging social activities that are not only fun and enjoyable, but which also serve as an assertion of solidarity and of the legitimacy of social difference. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Queer proms==
[[Sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] sometimes plays a role in leading students to form and attend an anti-prom (sometimes referred to as a '''gay prom''' or '''queer prom'''): [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], [[queer]], and [[questioning (sexuality)|questioning]] ([[LGBTQQ]]) students who feel that attending their school's traditional prom with a same-sex partner or not identifying in traditional gender identity fashion would be problematic might choose to hold their own gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/ci_22132835/hayward-gay-prom-is-focus-new-film|title=Hayward Gay Prom is focus of new film|author=Rebecca Parr|work=Hayward Daily Review|date=December 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay proms began to form in the 1990s, with one of the longest running and oldest being the [[Hayward Gay Prom]], which was first held in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=20060112&amp;id=oK5AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JSEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5790,913594|title=Alliance to host Tracy's first gay prom|author=Brenda Huang|date=January 12, 2006|work=San Joaquin News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Beginning in February 2011, Bahrain saw sustained pro-democracy protests, centered at [[Pearl Roundabout]] in the capital of [[Manama]], as part of the wider [[Arab Spring]]. Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February (later referred to by protesters as [[Bloody Thursday (2011)|Bloody Thursday]]), which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12490286 |title=Bahrain protests: Police break up Pearl Square crowd |date=17 February 2011 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests continued for a month reaching over 100,000 participants in a nation of about 500,000 citizens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = [[Michael Slackman|Slackman, Michael]] | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/world/middleeast/23bahrain.html?_r=1 | title = Bahraini Protesters' Calls for Unity Belie Divisions |work=[[The New York Times]] | date=22 February 2011 | accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Staff | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/bahrain-king-orders-release-of-political-prisoners-2222371.html | title = Bahrain King Orders Release of Political Prisoners | agency= [[Associated Press]]|work=The Independent |location=UK | date=22 February 2011 | accessdate=15 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Slackman (25 Feb 2012).

==Arrest==

BCHR said Alqudaishi was arrested on 13 May by plainclothes policemen near his house in [[Bilad Al Qadeem]], a neighbourhood of [[Manama]]. However, Noura [[Al-Khalifa]] the chief prosecutor for juveniles said the arrest happened on 14 May when Alqudaishi was "blocking a street outside Manama with garbage containers and wood planks".&lt;ref name="AJE 12.6.2012"/&gt;

"It was Saturday, and we were playing. They came and blocked the street, and then left, so we went back out and played a game, and then some civilians came and took pictures of us", Alqudaishi said.&lt;ref name="AJE 12.6.2012(2)"&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/06/2012612162139131543.html "Bahraini boy describes arrest and detention"].

I want my mother'. He is frightened and says they are going to punish him. He is only a child".&lt;ref name="Independent 12.6.2012"/&gt; However, a statement by the government said that Alqudaishi "is receiving social care and tutoring at the [detention] centre".&lt;ref name="CNN 12.6.2012"&gt;Salma Abdelaziz (12 June 2012).

According to chief prosecutor, Alqudaishi pleaded guilty of the charges saying it was on his third attempt to block the street when he was arrested. She further claimed that Alqudaishi said he along with his friends were given three [[Bahraini Dinar]]s (about $8) by "a man accused of stirring trouble".&lt;ref name="AJE 12.6.2012"/&gt;

Khamees suggested that the accusations made against her client were not true because it is impossible for Alqudaishi to block a road with a garbage container because it is "so heavy that you would need two grown men to lift it".&lt;ref name="Independent 12.6.2012"/&gt; She confirmed Alqudaishi pleaded guilty, but according to her, he then added "a man told me in the investigation that I would be released immediately if I said I dropped trash in the street."&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 10.6.2012"/&gt; Amnesty International stated that the boy "confessed because police promised to release him if he did".&lt;ref name="AFP 20.6.2012"/&gt;

The trial was postponed to 20 June.&lt;ref name="AJE 12.6.2012"/&gt; On 5 July the court handed verdict allowing him to stay home while a social worker monitor him for a year.&lt;ref name="WP 5.7.2012"/&gt; However, charges were not dropped and his legal status are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/07/201275153034365580.html "Bahrain child to be 'monitored' at home"].

A number of rights groups called for Alqudaishi's immediate release. Among them is the Ireland-based [[Bahrain Rehabilitation and Anti-Violence Organization]] which issued a statement regarding the "growing number of children detained for investigation in security cases". BCHR expressed its concern for targeting children under fifteen.&lt;ref name="CNN 10.6.2012"&gt;Samira Said (10 June 2012).

The organization criticized the proceedings as "completely out of step with international standards, or even Bahrain's own penal code".

Khamees said "[a]uthorities should be more than satisfied with the time Hasan has spent in jail and the damage they have caused to the boy by imprisoning him" and that the government should "treat children better".&lt;ref name="CNN 12.6.2012"/&gt; She also named the boy a [[political prisoner]].&lt;ref name="AJE 12.6.2012(2)"/&gt;

{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Cyrus the Great}}
At the '''Battle of Pteria''' ({{lang-grc|Πτερία}}) in 547 BC, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] forces of [[Cyrus the Great]] fought a drawn battle with the invading [[Lydia]]n forces of [[Croesus]], forcing Croesus to withdraw back west into his own kingdom.

==Background==
Formerly, the Lydians and [[Medes]] had arranged that the natural boundary between the two empires would be the [[Kızıl River|Halys River]]. Croesus learned of the sudden Persian uprising and defeat of his longtime rivals, the Medes. He attempted to opportunistically use these set of events to expand his borders upon the eastern frontier of Lydia.  He made an alliance with Chaldea, Egypt and  several Greek city-states, including [[Sparta]].

==Motives==
Croesus may have intended re-instating his brother-in-law, Astages on the Median throne.  It is also possible that he was trying to pre-empt a Persian invasion of Lydia.

==Battle==
Croesus began the campaign with an invasion of [[Cappadocia]], crossing the [[Halys River|Halys]] and capturing [[Pteria (Turkey)|Pteria]], then capital of the district and formidable as a fortress; The city was sacked, and the inhabitants enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'', (Penguin Books, 1983), I., p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Cyrus had advanced to halt the Lydian incursion, and the armies met in the vicinity of the fallen city. The battle appears to have been fierce, but indecisive; Both sides sustained considerable casualties; in the aftermath, the outnumbered Croesus withdrew across the Halys. The retreat of Croesus is represented by [[Herodotus]] as a strategic decision to suspend operations until their armies were more evenly matched, by arrival of reinforcements from his allies the [[Babylonians]], the [[Egyptians]] and particularly the [[Spartans]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus ''The Histories'', (Penguin Books, 1983), I., p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Though losses were more or less equal, Croesus apparently thought he had inflicted sufficiently heavy losses on the [[Persians]] to cripple Cyrus for the winter, as he disbanded his army shortly after reaching his own territory.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, I., p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Among historians, the outcome of the battle remains debatable and unclear. Before all of this, and prior to his invasion, Croesus asked the [[Oracle of Delphi]] for advice. The Oracle suggested vaguely that, "if King Croesus crosses the Halys River, a great empire will be destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus. 9.31&lt;/ref&gt; Croesus received these words with delight, instigating a war that would ironically and eventually end not the Persian Empire but his own. The dispersal of Croesus' army exposed Lydia to the unexpected invasion of Cyrus, who followed almost immediately on Croesus' steps, pursuing him to Sardis.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, I., p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The rival kings fought again at the [[Battle of Thymbra]], before Sardis, which ended in a decisive victory for Cyrus the Great.

'''''Bingo: Scenes of Money and Death''''' is a 1973 play by English [[Marxist]] playwright [[Edward Bond]]. It depicts an ageing [[William Shakespeare]] at his [[Warwickshire]] home in 1615 and 1616, suffering pangs of conscience in part because he signed a contract which protected his landholdings, on the condition that he would not interfere with an [[enclosure]] of common lands that would hurt the local peasant farmers. Although the play is fictional, this contract has a factual basis.&lt;ref&gt;Worthen 708&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bingo'' is a [[political theatre|political drama]] heavily influenced by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Epic theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Worthen 707&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation of the title==

In an interview with the ''Sunday Times'', Bond said, "Art has very practical consequences. Most 'cultural appreciation' ignores this and is no more relevant than a game of '[[Bingo (UK)|bingo]]' and less honest."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Hay 197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical basis==

Bond cites ''William Shakespeare'' by E.K. Chambers as his source for information about the Welcombe enclosure, on which ''Bingo'' is based.&lt;ref&gt;Bond "Introduction" 12&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction to ''Bingo'' Bond describes this incident: "A large part of his income came from rents (or [[tithe]]s) paid on common fields at Welcombe near [[Stratford-Upon-Avon|Stratford]]. Some important landowners wanted to enclose these fields... and there was a risk that the enclosure would affect Shakespeare's rents. He could either side with the landowners or with the poor who would lose their land and livelihood. He sided with the landowners. They gave him a guarantee against loss – and this is not a neutral document because it implies that should the people fighting the enclosers come to him for help he would refuse it. Well, the town did write to him for help and he did nothing."&lt;ref name="Bond Introduction 6"&gt;Bond "Introduction" 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==

*'''[[William Shakespeare]]''' – Bond's Shakespeare is depressed and introspective, concerned more with financial security than with art or the people around him; he is notably silent during several scenes.
*'''[[Judith Quiney|Judith]]''' – Shakespeare's daughter; she resents Shakespeare's treatment of her mother
*'''William Combe''' – A wealthy landowner scheming to enclose the common lands for his own profit
*'''Old Man''' – Shakespeare's gardener, mentally handicapped after spending three years in a [[impressment|press gang]]
*'''Old Woman''' – The Old Man's wife, Shakespeare's housekeeper; Bond based her on Shakespeare's daughter [[Susanna Hall]].&lt;ref name="Bond Introduction 3"&gt;Bond "Introduction" 3&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Young Woman''' – A displaced beggar woman, prostitute, and [[pyromaniac]]
*'''Son''' of the Old Man and Woman, a religious zealot who leads a rebellion party against Combe
*'''[[Ben Jonson]]''' – Shakespeare's drinking buddy and theatrical rival
*'''Jerome''', '''Wally''', and '''Joan''' – Peasant workers who join the Son in fighting Combe
*'''2nd Old Woman''' – Shakespeare's wife [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|Anne Hathaway]]; she is heard but never seen on stage

==Plot summary==

===Part one===

====Scene One====

Shakespeare is seated in his garden when the Young Woman arrives to beg. The Old Man takes her into the back garden for sex. The Old Woman tries to sound out Shakespeare's intentions with regards to Combe's land scheme and warns him that it will ruin local families. Combe arrives to convince Shakespeare to sign a contract stating that he will not interfere with the scheme, in exchange for the security of his own lands. Shakespeare hands Combe a paper stating his terms. The Old Man enters, followed by the Son, berating the Old Man for his sexual misconduct with the Young Woman. Combe interrogates her, but disbelieves her story, taking a haughty moralistic attitude. Combe and the Son take the Young Woman to be whipped for [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] and prostitution.

====Scene Two====

Six months later. The Old Woman tells Judith about her husband's condition and his history with the [[impressment|press gang]], but Judith takes a moralistic tone, condemning the Old Man for his infidelity and irresponsibility. Later, Shakespeare and the Old Man are in the garden when the Young Woman returns. She is physically decimated, having been living in burned out barns all winter, supported by the Old Man. Shakespeare tells Judith to give the woman food and clothing, but Judith resents her and refuses. The woman hides in the orchard when Combe arrives to give Shakespeare the contract, which he signs. Judith enters and tells Combe that the woman has returned; he sends his men to apprehend her. Judith berates her father for his toleration of their misconduct and his lack of sympathy with the local people: "You don't notice these things. You must learn that people have feelings. They suffer."&lt;ref&gt;Bond Lines 448-9 (All line references come from Worthen)&lt;/ref&gt; Judith soon feels guilty at being the cause of the woman's punishment, and regrets turning her in. The Old Man breaks down crying because he knows that the woman will be executed for arson, having burned down several barns. He describes the public spectacle of an execution as a festivity he used to enjoy, but can no longer endure.

====Scene Three====

The Young Woman has been executed, and hangs on a gibbet on stage. While Shakespeare sits alone, the Son and several local labourers eat lunch. The Son talks about the woman's sin, also making pointed comments about Shakespeare. The Son and his friend Wally look into the dead woman's face and engage in vehement prayer, jumping and shouting. When they leave, Shakespeare tells Judith about the violent scene of a [[bear-baiting]] that took place next to the theatre, saying "When I go to [[Globe Theatre|my theatre]] I walk under sixteen severed heads on a gate. You hear bears in the pit while my characters talk."&lt;ref&gt;Bond 689–691&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare relates his despair: "What does it cost to stay alive? I'm stupified by the suffering I've seen."&lt;ref&gt;Bond 675-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part two===

====Scene Four====

Shakespeare and [[Ben Jonson]] are drinking in a tavern. Jonson has come to tell Shakespeare that the [[Globe Theatre]] has burned down, and to ask Shakespeare what he is writing. Their conversation and their attitude towards literature are unglamorous: "I hate writing. Fat white fingers excreting dirty black ink. Smudges. Shadows. Shit. Silence" Jonson says.&lt;ref&gt;Bond 808–810&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson recounts a life of violence, compared with Shakespeare's "serene" existence. As the two get increasingly inebriated, the Son and the workers enter, having just had an encounter with Combe's men while destroying Combe's ditches and fences. They see themselves as religious soldiers against the "rich thieves plunderin' the earth."&lt;ref&gt;Bond 925&lt;/ref&gt; Combe confronts them, claiming that he represents progress and realism.

====Scene Five====

Shakespeare is walking home from the tavern through the fresh snow, coming across the Old Man, who is throwing snowballs. Judith enters and scolds Shakespeare; Shakespeare tells her that after temporarily abandoning her mother, he tried to love Judith with money, but ended up making her materialistic and vulgar. She leaves him, and as he sits alone in the snow, several dark figures run by backstage, and a gunshot is heard. The Old Woman comes to bring Shakespeare home.

====Scene Six====

Shakespeare is in bed, half delirious, repeating the phrase "Was anything done?"&lt;ref&gt;Bond 1197&lt;/ref&gt; Judith and her mother knock on the door calling for Shakespeare to let them in, gradually becoming hysterical when he does not respond, until finally he slips his will to them under the door and they leave. The Son enters, and tells Shakespeare that in a scuffle with Combe's men he shot his father, the Old Man. Combe enters, and the Son hypocritically accuses him of shooting the Old Man. While Combe and the Son argue, Shakespeare takes poison pills he had taken from Jonson. Combe and the Son leave, unaware that Shakespeare is dying. Judith enters, and paying no care to her dying father, she ransacks the room looking for money or a second will.

==Production history==

Bingo was first presented at the [[Northcott Theatre]], Devon on 14 November 1973. It was directed by Jane Howell and John Dove, with the following cast:
*Shakespeare – [[Bob Peck]]
*Old Man – [[Paul Jesson]]
*Son – David Howey
*William Combe – [[David Roper]]
*Ben Jonson – Rhys McConnochie
*Old Woman – [[Joanna Tope]]
*Judith – Sue Cox
*Young Woman – Yvonne Edgell
It was revived at the Young Vic Theatre, opening 16 Feb 2012, directed by Angus Jackson, with a cast led by [[Patrick Stewart]] (Shakespeare), [[John McEnery]] (Old Man), [[Catherine Cusack]] (Judith) and [[Richard McCabe]] (Ben Jonson).

==Bond's Introduction==

Like [[George Bernard Shaw]], Bond generally wrote lengthy prose introductions for his plays. Bond begins the introduction to ''Bingo'' by mentioning the minor historical inaccuracies he introduced into the play for dramatic purposes; for example, the Globe Theatre burned down in 1613 rather than in 1616, and [[Michael Drayton]] was also present at Shakespeare's "last binge."&lt;ref name="Bond Introduction 3"/&gt; The rest of the introduction explains Bond's view of the relationship between "human values," society, and art. Although he finds much suffering and violence in his own and in Shakespeare's time, Bond is not ultimately pessimistic; he attributes this violence not to human nature but to the arrangement of society, which can be reformed. Reflecting his [[Marxism|Marxist]] views, Bond argues that the demands of capitalism force people to act in aggressive, self-interested ways that conflict with their innate human values: "We're wrong when we assume we're free to use money in human ways," Bond writes.&lt;ref&gt;Bond "Introduction" 7&lt;/ref&gt; He then argues that the proper role of art is to work against this corrupted version of society: "(Art) always insists on the truth, and tries to express the justice and order that are necessary to sanity but are usually destroyed by society."&lt;ref&gt;Bond "Introduction" 5&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare's dilemma in ''Bingo'' is that he is caught between his financially motivated behaviour and his artistic sensibility of the destructiveness of that behaviour: "Shakespeare's plays show this need for sanity and its political expression, justice. But how did he live? His behavior as a property-owner made him closer to Goneril than [[King Lear|Lear]]. He supported and benefitted from the Goneril-society – with its prisons, workhouses, whipping, starvation, mutiliation, pulpit-hysteria and all the rest of it."&lt;ref name="Bond Introduction 6" /&gt;

'''Béthanie''' ({{zh|t=伯大尼修院}}) is a historic building complex located in [[Pok Fu Lam]], in [[Hong Kong]] built in 1875 as a [[sanatorium]] by the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]] ({{lang-fr|Missions Étrangères de Paris}}).&lt;ref name="leaflet"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hkapa.edu/asp/general/images/Bethanie_Handbill.pdf# |title=Leaflet about Béthanie |access-date=2009-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527153808/http://www.hkapa.edu/asp/general/images/Bethanie_Handbill.pdf# |archive-date=2010-05-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[List of Grade II historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade II historic building]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/historical.pdf List of Graded Historic Buildings in Hong Kong (as at 6 November 2009)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709224215/http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/historical.pdf |date=July 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Béthanie and the nearby [[Dairy Farm International Holdings|Dairy Farm]] cowsheds were allocated in 2003 to the [[Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts]]. After a series of renovations, the complex reopened in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com.hk/around-town/features/8974/bethanie-house.html# |title=''Time Out Hong Kong'': "Bethanie House" |access-date=2009-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728151930/http://www.timeout.com.hk/around-town/features/8974/bethanie-house.html# |archive-date=2014-07-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now used by the Academy's School of Film and Television. In addition to educational facilities, it includes two performance venues, an exhibition hall, a chapel and a museum.&lt;ref name="leaflet" /&gt;

== Location ==

Béthanie is located at [[Pok Fu Lam Road|No. 139, Pok Fu Lam Road]], on [[Hong Kong Island]]. Situated between the pine trees, with the seaview of the coast, Béthanie's geographical site provided an ideal restorative place for the French priests to recover from [[tropical disease]]s at that time.

Today, the  [[Chinese Cuisine Training Institute]] (CCTI) is located adjacent to Béthanie. Drivers can reach Béthanie by following signs leading to the CCTI.

== History==

===Before World War II (1875–1941)===
[[File:Neo-gothic structures in Bethanie.JPG|thumb|[[Neo-gothic]] structures]]
Béthanie was the first sanatorium to be built in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;Le Pichon, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leaflet2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hkapa.edu/media/general/download/pr/Bethanie_A4_12p.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521095827/http://www.hkapa.edu/media/general/download/pr/Bethanie_A4_12p.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally bought from a certain J.J. dos Remedios in June 1873&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uhall.com.hk/portal/aboutUhall/TheCastle.php&lt;/ref&gt;, in 1875, the Missions Étrangères de Paris, led by Pierre-Marie Osouf, finished building Béthanie to serve as a place for priests and missionaries from all over Asia to recover from [[tropical disease]]s before returning to their missions. At the same time, the missionaries and priests organized a small-scale printing press in Béthanie to work. The printing press turned out to be a successful operation, publishing religious items of 28 languages. Osouf's assistant, Fr. Charles Edmond Patriat, supervised the construction of the building and became the first Superior of Béthanie upon its opening in 1875. In 1887, Patriat requested a leave of absence and was succeeded by Fr. Holhaan.

During its early years, Béthanie suffered many deaths of missionaries due to the immature medicinal technology as well as the spread of incurable [[tuberculosis]]. Between 1875 and 1886, 11 fathers had died under the age of 50.&lt;ref&gt;Le Pichon, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; However, in its functions throughout a near century, the sanatorium had successfully nursed back to health hundreds of sick missionaries. In 1886, upon the appointment of Fr. Holhaan as Superior, Béthanie had seen an increase from 15 to 20 annual visitors in its initial years, to more than 40 in 1887–1890, and well over 50 in the following years. Due to the increase in volume of visitors, an average of 20 visitors at once were occupying the 14 available rooms in Béthanie. In the years of the 1890s, Fr. Holhaan found supplies to be stretched and rooms to be overcrowded, therefore leading to his first plan of enlargement for Béthanie in 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Le Pichon, p. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time as well, an internal debate regarding the future of Béthanie was impeding the construction plans. The problem arose of whether or not nuns from the French [[Sisters of Charity of St. Paul|Convent of St. Paul de Chartres]] in Hong Kong could be invited to help with patient care in the sanatorium. Of the next five years, the topic was discussed persistently but was eventually decided against. Fr. Holhaan felt that priorities of Béthanie's future lay within the expansion of the building and in 1896 construction began and was completed within the following year. The overall construction and expansion of the building cost the ''Missions Étrangères de Paris'' $15,820, roughly equivalent to the annual running costs of the establishment.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Le Pichon, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The sanatorium continued to run smoothly for the next fifty years.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

===World War II and afterwards (1941-1974)===

It was not until the second day of [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupation]] in December 1941 that troops forced their way into the building searching each corner, taking material goods as well as ransacking the building. The missionaries were put under two days' house arrest without food or water and were then forced to leave their own premises.&lt;ref&gt;Le Pichon, p.126-127&lt;/ref&gt; In desperation for fuel, the Japanese devastated the 50-year-old coniferous trees that covered the grounds of the sanatorium, leaving it bare. At the end of the war, Japanese surrender led to a prompt return of the ''Missions Étrangères de Paris'' back to Béthanie. In the years of recovery, patients were sent to the French Hospital run by the Sisters of St Paul de Chartres as the new superior of Béthanie since 1946, Fr Vignal, supervised the refurbishment of the house which was re opened in February 1949.

After the [[Chinese civil war#Fighting in mainland China .281946.E2.80.931950.29|Communist Revolution of 1949]], growing pressures mounted on the expulsion of missionaries and Béthanie felt the mounting pressure of political unrest. In the 2 years that followed, Béthanie was again working well beyond capacity, serving 70 missionaries, totaling 4,950 days of stay.&lt;ref&gt;Le Pichon, p.129-130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closure and redevelopment===

In 1974, the Fathers sold Béthanie to [[Hongkong Land]] for redevelopment. In time, Hongkong Land determined the site too difficult to develop. In an exchange of land agreement, the Hong Kong government took Béthanie subject to a demolition order. For the next five years the threat of destruction loomed over the sanatorium. In 1978, a group of students studying at the [[University of Hong Kong]] occupied the buildings while waiting for an additional accommodation on campus to be constructed. A new appreciation for the heritage site arose and the community began to feel the responsibility of preserving it. In 1981, Béthanie was saved and declared a Grade II listed building. During its hundred years of operation, the death rate was incredibly low: the number of deaths coincidentally equaled with the number of years of operation - 100 in all, or in an average of one a year.

Throughout the time period of 1978 - 1997, Béthanie continued to be used by the University of Hong Kong as a storage warehouse, where it slowly deteriorated due to neglect. In 2000, the [[Architectural Services Department]] commissioned a study to investigate the restoration of the Béthanie buildings. It was not until March 2003, when the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] (LEGCO) approved funds for the [[Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts]] to restore Béthanie.&lt;ref name="leaflet2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Pichon, A.

{{stack end}}

In 2003, after considering the restoration options and future developments of Béthanie, the Legislative Council decided to support the restoration of the place and its two nearby Dairy Farm cowsheds, by providing funds to the [[Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts]] (APA).  It took roughly three years to complete the project (including renovation and search for missing artefacts) and cost an estimated HK $80 million.  The alteration of the cowsheds led to a development of different facilities.

'''George C. Tso Memorial Chapel'''
Designed with a [[neo-Gothic]] structure, the George C. Tso Memorial Chapel has been used since 17 December 2006 for regular religious service by the Emmanuel Church-Pokfulam, a daughter church of St. John's Cathedral (Anglican), which carries on the historical Christian use of the site. Every Sunday, a congregation of worship is held. Also, the chapel is open for public use and admiration, including weddings and guided tours.
The heritage building has retained its original charm and appeal from the restoration project.  Many of its distinctive features, such as the stained glass windows, paneled doors and altar, have all been preserved or restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emmanuel.org.hk/bethanie-restoration/ Emmanuel Church, Pofulam - restoration of Béthanie]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wellcome Theatre'''
To mark the 120th anniversary of its founding in 1886, Dairy Farm sponsored the transformation of the two historic octagonal cowsheds into a modern theatre. The first octagon is a foyer and exhibition area; the second is an intimate 150 seat performance space equipped with advanced acoustics for music and audio/visual support for seminars, film screenings and corporate events. The adjacent foyer is suitable for exhibitions, cocktail receptions and corporate functions. The original octagonal roof and milking stalls have been retained for visitors’ appreciation.

'''School of Film and Television'''
The School of Film and Television is a branch school of the HKAPA which became functional in September 2006. Most of the facilities and classrooms are now in use but certain facilities such as the TV studio are kept in the academy's Wan Chai campus. The School of Film and Television has its own individual environment, with its own building, garden and roof garden.  These settings can provide students with rest areas and place for gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hk.education.nextmedia.com/F5F72008/index.php?fuseaction=Form7.Article&amp;issueID=20050701&amp;articleID=4994185# |title=''香 港 演 藝 學 院 - 電 影 電 視 學 院''(2005).

'''Museum of Béthanie'''
The basement of Béthanie, once used as a wine cellar and dry goods storage, has now been converted into a museum displaying historical items of Bethanie and the French missionary’s activities in Asia throughout the past 300 years.

'''Jackie Chan Screening Room'''
The Jackie Chan suite is located on the second floor.  It was funded through a donation by the Jackie Chan Charitable Fund.  The suite is built with modern facilities for the School of Film and Television such including a 70-seat screening room, an audio/visual room and a product design room.

'''Sir Yuk Pao Studio'''
Today, Sir Yuk Pao Studio, sponsored by Dr Helmut Sohmen and Professor Anna Pao Sohmen, serves as a spectacular multi-function room on the second floor of Béthanie. The room was originally a pitched roof with tiles.  Due to the limited space, it was later reconstructed with a flat roof.  It was not until the restoration project when the distinctive pitch roof was brought back into the design, using double-glazed panels of glass. The studio has a floor area of {{convert|21|m2|ft2}} is equipped with wall mirrors, dance bars, glazed windows and other technical facilities and non-permanent seating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hkapa.edu/ASP/general/general_venues_YKPao.asp?lang=eng&amp;mode=gui# |title=HKAPA Sir Yuk Pao Studio |access-date=2009-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212032900/http://www.hkapa.edu/asp/general/general_venues_YKPao.asp?lang=eng&amp;mode=gui# |archive-date=2009-12-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architectural style ==

Béthanie is one of the outstanding European-style historical buildings in Hong Kong.  It represents the city's few magnetic examples of [[French colonial]] architectures.{{Weasel inline|date=October 2009}}

Throughout the mid-19th century, the significant penetration of Western culture into Hong Kong led to the emergence of a new culture blend of 'east meets west' which was an influential factor in Hong Kong's architecture. French architecture was seen as a vehicle for cultural interchange and its influence on the formation of this distinctive Hong Kong identity was profound. Some even believe that 'the story of French architecture in Hong Kong was the story of Hong Kong itself'.{{Weasel inline|date=October 2009}}

[[File:Rib vault in Bethanie chapel, Hong Kong.JPG|thumb|[[Rib vault]]s in Béthanie chapel.]]

The influence of French architectural style spread as Hong Kong developed during three key phases – Arrival (the second half of the 19th century), Expansion (the early 20th century to the Japanese occupation) and Renewal (post-war to present)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.consulfrance-hongkong.org/spip.php?article2136&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on [[neo-gothic]] design, Béthanie is a stylish composition of symmetrical cylinders. Apart from that, [[ogive]], [[tracery]], [[stained glass]] as well as Gothic arched windows can be found in the building.  With a high ceiling and pitched roof, the George C. Tso Memorial Chapel is a typical illustration of neo-gothic architectures in Béthanie, though in a much simpler style and smaller scale. Among its nineteen stained glass windows, nine were originals.  The remaining ones, either in disrepair or missing, were reproduced hand-made in the Philippines.  Also, only four out of the twelve statues of the apostles, originally standing on corbels above the altar, have been found. Although the genuine ones were unavailable for exhibition, the Academy has replicated the statues with a silicone molding technique. Moreover, many neo-gothic structures within the perimeter have been conserved.  One of these examples are the [[flying buttress]]es that were used to support the exteriors of buildings in the past.  Although no longer functional, they have been restored to maintain authenticity.  The [[Rib vault]]s, built in to support the ceiling and roof have also been retained in the chapel for decorative purposes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The efforts in restoration led Béthanie to receive a [[UNESCO]] Asia-Pacific Heritage Award in 2008, for the modernized appearance in the aftermath of the restoration project.  The honour is attributed to architect Philip Liao and Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts associate director of operations, Philip Soden.  A citywide search to recover the original furnishings was carried out to restore the site to its historical appearance.  According to Soden, the hardest part of the restoration was to equip the building with air conditioning, fire services and lighting without affecting the overall appearance of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.turbojethorizon.com/2009/09/golden-oldies/# |title=TurboJet Horizon,Golden Oldies |access-date=2009-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229111055/http://www.turbojethorizon.com/2009/09/golden-oldies/# |archive-date=2009-12-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contribution to history and religion ==

=== Hong Kong - French relations===

Béthanie witnessed the changes of Hong Kong-Franco relation hence contributing to history. Examples are shown below:

====  1964-2008: French International School ====

In 1964, on the premises of the Béthanie sanatorium in [[Pok Fu Lam]], the first "small French-speaking school" was founded. At first, it could only accommodate 35 students. Over the years, the school has moved its location several times: from the ''[[Alliance française]]'' in Wan Chai to the Catholic centre, and then, in 1975, to the former military hospital on Borrett Road. In 1984 the ''Lycée Victor Ségalen'' was founded, with a new constitution and in new buildings at [[Jardine's Lookout]]. Once again, the school quickly reached its maximum capacity, and it became necessary to find additional premises in Kowloon to admit new students. In 1999, a new campus was opened on [[Blue Pool Road]]. Today, the ''Lycée Ségalen'' is the largest French International School in Asia, with more than 1700 students and 200 employees.&lt;ref name=16stories&gt;[http://www.consulfrance-hongkong.org/spip.php?article2113&amp;var_recherche=b%C3%A9thanie#tdm ''16 stories about Hong Kong-France relations''(n.d.). Retrieved on 14 October 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

====  French architectural legacy in Hong Kong  ====

Buildings erected in Hong Kong by the French community since 1848 represent a major non-British contribution to the history of Hong Kong. Among those still surviving today are the Béthanie sanatorium and the St Paul’s church ; and perhaps the most visible, the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]], an elegant neo-classical three-storey building, with red bricks walls and [[Doric order|Doric]] and Ionic columns.&lt;ref name=16stories/&gt;

====  The French “Fathers” of the bauhinia  ====

The floral emblem of Hong Kong, the [[bauhinia]], (as represented on the flag of the Hong Kong S.A.R. since 1997), was discovered by French people. The plant was first observed in Hong Kong by the Fathers of the French Foreign Missions near Mount Davis and was later studied by the Fathers of the Béthanie sanatorium in Pokfulam from specimens growing in their gardens in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=16stories/&gt;

====  1848-2008: 160 years of relationships between France and Hong Kong  ====

In 2008, the Consulate General of France celebrated the 160th anniversary of the French presence in the territory. The French Mission building Béthanie in Pokfulam is one of their evident marks on Hong Kong history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consulfrance-hongkong.org/spip.php?article1335&amp;var_recherche=b%C3%A9thanie ''1848-2008: 160 years of relationships between France and Hong Kong''(n.d.). Retrieved on 14 October 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===

[[File:Religious service in Bethanie chapel 17 Dec 2006.jpg|thumb|Regular religious services re-commenced in the Béthanie Chapel on 17 Dec 2006.]]
Béthanie has had a long history under the occupancy of French priests and missionaries. Over the last century or so, the complex has served a number of religious purposes. From its roots as a sanatorium for priests to a printing press for HKU, Béthanie's roots were tied in deeply with early French Christianity and continued on throughout the 20th century.

The Béthanie's chapel is still used for religious purposes.  Notably, the Béthanie Chapel has been used since 17 December 2006 for regular Sunday services by the Emmanuel Church - Pokfulam a daughter church of St. John's Cathedral (Anglican), which carries on the historical Christian use of the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emmanuel.org.hk/ Emmanuel Church, Pofulam - a daughter church of St. John's Cathedral (Anglican / Episcopal)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the chapel is also made available to the public for weddings, other religious services and ceremonies.

'''''Children of the Century''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Les Enfants du Siècle'''}}) is a 1999 French film based on the true tale of the tumultuous love affair between two French literary icons of the 19th century, novelist [[George Sand]] ([[Juliette Binoche]]) and poet [[Alfred de Musset]] ([[Benoît Magimel]]).

==Plot summary==
[[File:Juliette Binoche.JPG|thumb|left|Study from life of Juliette Binoche as George Sand by Reginald Gray 1999. (collection Mrs. Fran Robinson, Yorkshire, UK.)]]

The story begins as [[George Sand]] quits her marital home and arrives in Paris with her two children. Meanwhile, the young poet and dandy [[Alfred de Musset]] is busy making a name for himself both as a womaniser and a talented poet and critic. Sand and Musset first meet at a literary dinner and quickly recognise in each other a like minded love of literature. At first their relationship remains platonic, but soon the pair embark on a tumultuous affair that will lead them to Venice and the creation of their finest works of literature.

==Background and production==
The film was shot on location in [[Paris]], [[Nohant]] and [[Venice]] from August to December 1998. In an interview with ''[[The Irish Times]]'' entitled "Playing with Sand", [[Diane Kurys]] revealed that she was shooting in the actual rooms Sand and Musset had occupied in the [[Palazzo Dandolo|Hotel Danieli]], while [[Juliette Binoche]] revealed that Sand's estate had loaned the production some of her possessions including a sapphire ring and jewel-encrusted dagger. When asked about her inspiration for the film, Kurys mentioned that Musset's account of the affair in his book ''La Confession d'un Enfant du Siècle'' was her starting point. Binoche said that her attraction to the part was due to "Sand's combination of strengths and weaknesses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Following Sand's footsteps | url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/1999/0320/99032000201.html | format = fee required | publisher = The Irish Times | date = 1999-03-20 | accessdate = 2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Cloudbusting'''" is a song written, produced and performed by [[British (people)|British]] singer [[Kate Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cloudbusting|url=http://mubi.com/films/cloudbusting|publisher=MUBI|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the second single released from her number one 1985 album ''[[Hounds of Love]]''. "Cloudbusting" peaked at No. 20 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].

The song is about the very close relationship between psychologist and philosopher [[Wilhelm Reich]] and his young son, Peter, told from the point of view of the mature Peter. It describes the boy's memories of his life with Reich on their family farm, called [[Orgonon]] where the two spent time "cloudbusting", a rain-making process which involved using a machine designed and built by Reich - a machine called a [[cloudbuster]] - to point at the sky. The lyric further describes the elder Reich's abrupt arrest and imprisonment, the pain of loss the young Peter felt, and his helplessness at being unable to protect his father. The song was inspired by Peter Reich's 1973 memoir, ''A Book of Dreams'', which Bush read and found deeply moving.&lt;ref&gt;http://gaffa.org/dreaming/hol_clb2.html Interview with Bush about inspiration for song&lt;/ref&gt;

In a retrospective review of the single, [[Allmusic]] journalist Amy Hanson praised the song for its "magnificence" and "hypnotic mantric effects". Hanson wrote: "Safety and danger are threaded through the song, via both a thoughtful lyric and a compulsive cello-driven melody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Weblog|url=http://music.metafilter.com/archived.mefi/2/01/2013/|publisher=MeFi Music|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even more startling, but hardly surprising, is the ease with which Bush was able to capture the moment when a child first realizes that adults are fallible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/cloudbusting-mt0003655152|title=Cloudbusting - Kate Bush - Song Info - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The [[music video]], directed by [[Julian Doyle (filmmaker)|Julian Doyle]], was conceived by [[Terry Gilliam]] and Kate Bush as a short film. The video features [[Canadians|Canadian]] actor [[Donald Sutherland]] playing the role of Wilhelm Reich, and Bush in the role of his young son, Peter. The video shows the two on the top of a hill trying to make the cloudbuster work. Reich leaves Peter on the machine and returns to his lab. In flashback, he remembers several times he and Peter enjoyed together as Reich worked on various scientific projects, until he is interrupted by government officials who arrest him and ransack the lab. Peter senses his father's danger and tries to reach him, but is forced to watch helplessly as his father is driven away. Peter finally runs back to the cloudbuster and activates it successfully, to the delight of his father who sees it starting to rain.

Filming took place at [[The Vale of White Horse]] in [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]]. The hill on which the machine is positioned is [[Dragon Hill, Uffington|Dragon Hill]], immediately below the [[Uffington White Horse]], a prehistoric hill carving which can be seen briefly in a couple of the shots. Bush found out in which hotel Sutherland was staying from actress [[Julie Christie]]'s hairdresser and went to his room to personally ask him to participate in the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Donald+Sutherland/ Donald Sutherland Interview] by [[Suicide Girls]] 7 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the music video was shown at some cinemas as an accompaniment to the main feature. Due to difficulties on obtaining a [[work visa]] for Sutherland at short notice, the actor offered to work on the video for free. Although the events depicted in the story took place in [[Maine]], the newspaper clipping in the music video reads "The [[Oregon]] Times," likely a reference to Reich's home and laboratory "[[Orgonon]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=VanDevender|first=Steve|title=Love-Hounds Digest #8.38|url=http://gaffa.org/archives/1992-06/msg00060.html|accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cloudbusting machine in the video was designed and constructed by people who worked on the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien creature]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaffa.org/dreaming/hol_clb2.html|title=* * DREAMING * *   A 'Best of' Love-Hounds Collection  Hounds Of Love  The Songs  "Cloudbusting" Pt. 2|author=Wieland Willker|date=September 1995 – June 1996|quote=worked with some designers that worked on the Alien|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehomegroundandkatebushnewsandinfoforum.yuku.com/topic/17191|title=HR Giger and the Cloudbuster|year=2009|quote=HR Giger designed the cloudbuster. ... one of those fan myths|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bears only a superficial resemblance to the real cloudbusters, which were smaller and with multiple narrow, straight tubes and pipes, and were operated while standing on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theorderoftime.com/science/free_energy/4.html Image of actual cloudbuster&lt;/ref&gt; In a reference to the source material of the song, Bush pulls a copy of Peter Reich's ''A Book of Dreams'' from Sutherland's coat.&lt;ref&gt;http://gaffa.org/dreaming/hol_clb2.html Book in Sutherland's jacket pocket.&lt;/ref&gt;

The full length video features a longer version of the song which is different from the ''Organon Mix'' released on 12 inch.

Around the time of the release Bush sent Peter Reich a VHS copy of the music video. Reich was immediately a fan. He later told ''[[Dazed]]'' magazine "Quite magically, this British musician had tapped precisely into a unique and magical fulfilment of father-son devotion, emotion and understanding. They had captured it all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/27217/1/the-story-behind-kate-bush-s-cloudbusting-video|title=The story behind Kate Bush’s Cloudbusting video|first=|last=Dazed|date=30 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cover versions==
[[Utah Saints]] sampled the song's line "I just know that something good is going to happen" for their song [[Something Good (Utah Saints song)|"Something Good"]] (1992) as well as scenes from Bush's video for their video. It reached No. 4 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]&lt;ref name=utah&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/27142/utah-saints/|title=Official Charts &gt; Utah Saints|publisher=The Official UK Charts Company|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and No. 8 when re-mixed and re-released in 2008&lt;ref name=utah/&gt; (the latter of which used a different sample from another artist).

Italian metal band [[Novembre (band)|Novembre]] covered this song, as did as American rock band [[The Twilight Singers]]. American singer-songwriter [[Charlotte Martin]] covered this song in 2007 on her all-covers album ''Reproductions''. Scottish pop act [[Swimmer One]] recorded an electro cover version of this song in 2005, released by [[Dogbox Records]]. UK punk band [[P.A.I.N.]] used a sample in their song ''Eastern Dub (Wilhelm Reich in Hell)'', without the permission of record label EMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox-fanzine.de/web/print/pdf/s/212/itv/902/interviews.212.html|title=Grow more Weed|last=Brunner|first=Simon|date=December 2002|work=Ox Fanzine|accessdate=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neil Halstead]] covered the track for [[American Laundromat Records]] children's charity compilation ''Sing Me to Sleep - Indie Lullabies'' in 2010.

Irish singer [[Gemma Hayes]] covered the song in 2009, and performed it on her tours in 2011 and 2012.

[[Wild Nothing]] covered ''Cloudbusting'' in 2010.

In 2012, [[Geographer (band)|Geographer]] released a version of the song on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geographermusic.com/news/120571|title=We Covered Kate Bush - Cloudbusting|date=8 January 2012|work=Ox Fanzine|accessdate=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neil Cicierega]]'s 2014 album of mashups, ''[[Mouth Silence]]'', features a mashup between ''Cloudbusting'' and [[Katy Perry]]'s song ''[[California Gurls]]'', called ''Orgonon Gurlz.'' Cicierega has publicly stated that ''Cloudbusting'' is one of his favorite songs, while ''California Gurlz'' is his least.

Canadian alternative rock singer-songwriter [[Matthew Good]] covered the song with [[Holly McNarland]] on his 2015 album ''[[Chaotic Neutral (album)|Chaotic Neutral]]''.

In late 2016 U.S. dance act Just Us released a cover of the song, but titled it ''Everytime It Rains''. In February 2017 they rerecorded the vocals with the vocalist Lucy Pullin and released the track with record label support, and titled it ''Cloudbusting''.

==Track listing==
The [[B-Side]] to the single was "Burning Bridge", in which a woman desperately pleads with her lover to step up his level of commitment to her. The 12" featured the additional track "My Lagan Love", a traditional Irish melody with lyrics by John Carder Bush, Kate Bush's brother. The 12" version of "Cloudbusting" was a special remix called "The Organon Re-Mix" in which the verses were downplayed and the main focus was the development of the song's chorus. In the USA, this mix was issued as "The Meteorological Mix", a title used in the UK for 12" version of Bush's later single "[[The Big Sky (song)|The Big Sky]]".

On March 27, 2016, hackers under the banner, [[Anonymous (hacktivist group)|Anonymous Philippines]] hacked into the website of the Philippine [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC) and [[Website defacement|defaced it]]. The hackers left a message calling for tighter security measures on the [[Optical scan voting system|vote counting machines (VCM)]] to be used during the [[Philippine general election, 2016|2016 Philippine general election]] in May 9.&lt;ref name=telecomasia&gt;{{cite news|title=Massive data breach exposes all Philippines voters|url=http://www.telecomasia.net/content/massive-data-breach-exposes-all-philippines-voters|accessdate=21 April 2016|publisher=Telecom Asia|date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the day a separate group of hackers, LulzSec Pilipinas posted an online link to what it claims to be the entire database of COMELEC and updated the post to include three mirror link to the index of the database's downloadable files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bueza|first1=Michael|last2=Manuel|first2=Wayne|title=Experts fear identity theft, scams due to Comelec leak|url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/127870-comelec-leak-identity-theft-scams-experts|accessdate=21 April 2016|publisher=Rappler|date=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaked files by LulzSec Pilipinas amounts to 340 gigabytes.&lt;ref name=trendmicro/&gt;

The {{Sc1|COMELEC}} website returned to normal at 03:15 ([[Philippine Standard Time|PST]]) on 28 March 2016. {{Sc1|COMELEC}} spokesperson, James Jimenez, stated on his Twitter account that, as they continue to scour the site, all databases would remain temporarily off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/560552/scitech/technology/comelec-website-back-to-normal-after-hacking|title=Comelec website back to normal after hacking|work=GMA News|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident was considered the biggest private leak data in the Philippine history and leaving millions of registered voters at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/127870-comelec-leak-identity-theft-scams-experts|title=Experts fear identity theft, scams due to Comelec leak|accessdate=21 April 2016|date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://interaksyon.com/article/126807/comeleaks--lawmakers-voter-database-breach-compromises-may-9-elections-pnp-joins-probe|title='COMELEAKS' Lawmakers: Voter database breach compromises May 9 elections; PNP joins probe|work=Interaksyon|accessdate=22 April 2016|date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

55 million registered voters are at risk due to the data breach according to security firm, [[Trend Micro]] potentially surpassing the [[Office of Personnel Management data breach]] which affected 20 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=John|title=Every one of the Philippines’ 55m voters could be in danger of fraud|url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/enterprise/2016/04/11/philippines-fraud-hackers-leak-elections|accessdate=21 April 2016|publisher=Silicon Republic|date=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A searchable website, called ''wehaveyourdata'', was set up containing sensitive data on Filipino registered voters was set up as early as April 21. The website was taken down with the assistance of the [[Department of Justice (United States)|U.S. Department of Justice]] since the domain of the website was bought from a US-based web hosting company. The website itself was found to be hosted in Russia.&lt;ref name=taken_down&gt;{{cite news|title=Searchable website with hacked data taken down – Comelec|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/04/22/Comelec-hack-voters-data-wehaveyourdata.html|accessdate=22 April 2016|publisher=CNN Philippines|date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent of the breach==
[[Trend Micro]] conducted its own investigation on the extent of the data breach. It found that 1.3 million records of Overseas Filipino voters, which included passport numbers and expiry dates were included in the data dumps by the hackers. The security firm found the breach as "alarming" since it said that the data are easily accessible to the public were in plain text. It also added that 15.8 million record of fingerprints along with a list of people who have run for office since the 2010 elections were found by the firm's investigation.
&lt;ref name=trendmicro&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malig|first1=Jojo|title=Comelec hacking threatens security of voters: Trend Micro|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/halalan2016/focus/04/07/16/comelec-hacking-threatens-security-of-voters-trend-micro|accessdate=21 April 2016|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs|ABS-CBN News]] |date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm also found files concerning candidates running in the election with the filename "VOTESOBTAINED" which the firm infers to reflect the number of votes received by the particular candidates. It said that the figures of the "VOTESOBTAINED" files were set to NULL at the time Trend Micro conducted its investigation.&lt;ref name=trendmicro/&gt;

The Commission on Elections chairman, Andres Bautista said that he was told that no confidential information was leaked, saying the breach would not affect the election body's preparation for the 2016 elections.&lt;ref name=trendmicro/&gt; The commission also emphasized that the database on its website is accessible to the public and no sensitive information is hosted on the website. It said that the results website that the election body is planning will be hosted in a different website with a different and better set of security measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Santos|first1=Tina|title=Comelec shrugs off hacking|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/776683/comelec-shrugs-off-hacking|accessdate=21 April 2016|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It further added that the database might be fake saying that no biometrics date were compromised by the hackers as opposed to Trend Micro's findings. COMELEC also noted that Trend Micro accessed the dumped data by hackers on its investigation and said that it has no capability of validating the data since it had no access to its original database.&lt;ref name=nobiometrics&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gotinga|first1=JC|title=Comelec: No biometrics in leaked data|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/04/12/Comelec-No-biometrics-in-leaked-data-hack.html|accessdate=21 April 2016|publisher=CNN Philippines|date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perpetrators==
On April 12, COMELEC announced that the National Bureau of Investigation had a "very good lead" regarding the hackers behind the breach. The perpetrators are to be charged of violations of the [[Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012|Cybercrime Prevention Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Santos|first1=Tina|title=NBI finds lead on hackers who defaced Comelec website|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/779228/nbi-finds-lead-on-hackers-who-defaced-comelec-website|accessdate=21 April 2016|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April, the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] (NBI) apprehended one of the suspected hackers, later identified as Paul Biteng,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/563546/news/nation/nbi-releases-suspected-comelec-hacker-s-mugshot|title=NBI releases suspected Comelec hacker’s mugshot|accessdate=21 April 2016|date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 20-year-old [[Information Technology|IT]] graduate student, in his home in [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampaloc]], [[Manila]].

About eight days later, a second hacker, named Joenel de Asis — also a 23-year-old Computer Science graduate, apprehended by NBI at his house in [[Muntinlupa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/04/29/1578060/nbi-arrests-2nd-comelec-hacker|title=NBI arrests 2nd Comelec hacker|work=The Philippine Star|accessdate=29 April 2016|date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press conference held on April 29, COMELEC chairperson Andres D.

Biteng breached the server of the Comelec website, while De Asis downloaded the 340 gigabyte voter database five days before the website was defaced on March 27. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geducos |first= Argyll Cyrus |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/comeleak-wont-affect-may-9-polls/|title=Second Comelec hacker arrested|work= ‘Comeleak’ won’t affect May 9 polls|accessdate=2 May 2016|date=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While De Asis leaked the data though the Lulzsec Pilipinas website, he denied that their group created the website, ''wehaveyourdata''.&lt;ref name="secondhacker105"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestandard.com.ph/news/-main-stories/top-stories/204610/second-comelec-hacker-arrested.html|title=Second Comelec hacker arrested|work=The Standard|accessdate=30 April 2016|date=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He assured that the data leak will not affect the upcoming elections as they did not hack Vote Counting Machines (VCMs) since it is connected to a different server.&lt;ref name="secondhacker070"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/04/29/Comelec-hacker-data-leak.html|title=Hacker who allegedly leaked Comelec data now in NBI custody|work=CNN Philippines|accessdate=29 April 2016|date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="secondhacker105"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/comelec-data-leak-has-no-effect-on-elections-says-hacker/|title=Comelec data leak has no effect on elections, says hacker|work=Manila Bulletin|accessdate=29 April 2016|date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third hacker, which is yet to be identified, is still at large.

==Measures==
On April 21, COMELEC announced that they will be making consultations with [[Microsoft]] and other [[cybersecurity]] experts based in the United Kingdom, Singapore and the United States. A technical working group tasked to look on the issue of hacking was also formed which is to be led by Director James Jimenez of the Comelec Information and Education Department.&lt;ref name="taps_experts"&gt;{{cite news|title=Comelec taps cybersecurity experts|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/breaking_news/comelec-taps-cybersecurity-experts/|accessdate=21 April 2016|publisher=The Manila Times|date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website will be transferred to the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]]'s server.

==Charges==
The [[National Privacy Commission]] decided on December 28, 2016 (case no. 16-001) said that the COMELEC found responsible for violating the Data Privacy Act of 2012 and the criminal prosecution of Chairman Andres Bautista is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Comeleak’: Poll chief rapped for data breach|url=http://thestandard.com.ph/news/-main-stories/top-stories/225981/-comeleak-poll-chief-rapped-for-data-breach.html|work=Manila Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comelec's Bautista faces criminal raps over massive data leak|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/01/05/17/comelecs-bautista-faces-criminal-raps-over-massive-data-leak|work=ABS-CBN News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crash Override Network''' is a support group for victims of large scale online abuse, including [[revenge porn]] and [[doxing]].&lt;ref name="Free of charge"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/13/online-abuse-how-women-are-fighting-back | title=Online abuse: how women are fighting back | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=13 April 2016 | accessdate=13 April 2016 | author=Alexander, Leigh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="destructoid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;

== History ==
Crash Override was founded by game developers [[Zoë Quinn]] and Alex Lifschitz,&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; and is staffed exclusively by victims of online abuse whose identities are kept anonymous outside the group.&lt;ref name="tnw" /&gt; Quinn and Lifschitz were subjected to online abuse during the [[Gamergate controversy]], having both received death threats and doxing attacks.&lt;ref name="csm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes20150204" /&gt;

Crash Override formed a partnership with [[Feminist Frequency]] in March 2016, which serves as its fiscal sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://feministfrequency.com/2016/03/03/feminist-frequency-and-crash-override-partnership/|title=Feminist Frequency and Crash Override Partnership|last=Sarkeesian|first=Anita|date=3 March 2016|website=Feminist Frequency|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The founders of Crash Override consider it a conversation starter, a repository for addressing problems that others in and out of the gaming community "have long hoped would simply go away."&lt;ref name=latimes20150204 /&gt; The organisation's services are divided into three categories: ongoing assistance for victims, crisis centre support, and community outreach.&lt;ref name=pc /&gt;&lt;ref name="monitor" /&gt; They provide post-crisis counseling services,&lt;ref name=destructoid /&gt; help seeking shelter,&lt;ref name=monitor /&gt; and access to experts in information security, [[White hat (computer security)|white hat hacking]], law enforcement, public relations and threat monitoring.&lt;ref name=pc /&gt;&lt;ref name=tnw /&gt; The network tailors a unique plan of action for each victim&lt;ref name=monitor /&gt; and works with law enforcement, the media, and social media.&lt;ref name=monitor /&gt; They promise to help victims regardless of previous affiliations and ideology, including Gamergate supporters.&lt;ref name=destructoid /&gt;

The group has been credited with defusing a [[swatting]] attack by advising the target to preemptively contact the police.&lt;ref name=wired /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/13/gamergate-hits-new-low-with-attempts-to-send-swat-teams-to-critics | title=Gamergate hits new low with attempts to send SWAT teams to critics | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=13 January 2015 | accessdate=26 September 2016 | author=Hern, Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quinn said the launch of Crash Override Network led to a renewed and heightened campaign of abuse, and the website underwent daily hack attempts.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt; In May 2015 the organisation became an official [[Twitter]] trusted safety resource.&lt;ref name=ars20150520 /&gt;

The '''''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill''' (also referred to as the '''BP oil spill'''/'''leak''', the '''BP oil disaster''', the '''Gulf of Mexico oil spill''', and the '''Macondo blowout)''' is an industrial disaster that began on 20 April 2010, in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on the [[BP]]-operated [[Macondo Prospect]],&lt;ref name=nyt020810&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/us/03spill.html |title=Gulf Spill Is the Largest of Its Kind, Scientists Say |first1= Campbell |last1=Robertson |first2= Clifford |last2=Krauss |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2 August 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-4"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/7924009/BP-leak-the-worlds-worst-accidental-oil-spill.html |title=BP leak the world's worst accidental oil spill |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=3 August 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="largest in US hist"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-05-27-oil-spill-news_N.htm | title = Obama, in Gulf, pledges to push on stopping leak | first1=Rick | last1=Jervis | first2=Alan | last2=Levin | agency = [[Associated Press]] | newspaper = [[USA Today]] | date=27 May 2010 | accessdate= 3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-05-25-oil-spill-victims-memorial_N.htm|title=Memorial service honors 11 dead oil rig workers|publisher=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered to be the largest marine [[oil spill]] in the history of the petroleum industry and estimated to be 8% to 31% larger in volume than the previous largest, the [[Ixtoc I oil spill]].

Numerous investigations explored the causes of the explosion and record-setting spill.  The U.S. government September 2011 report pointed to defective cement on the well, faulting mostly BP, but also rig operator [[Transocean]] and contractor [[Halliburton]].&lt;ref name="BOERMEPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-17"/&gt; Earlier in 2011, a White House commission likewise blamed BP and its partners for a series of cost-cutting decisions and an inadequate safety system, but also concluded that the spill resulted from "systemic" root causes and "absent significant reform in both industry practices and government policies, might well recur".&lt;ref name="AutoBB-16"/&gt;

In November 2012, BP and the [[United States Department of Justice]] settled federal criminal charges with BP pleading guilty to 11 counts of [[manslaughter]], two [[misdemeanors]], and a felony count of lying to Congress.  BP also agreed to four years of government monitoring of its safety practices and ethics, and the Environmental Protection Agency announced that BP would be temporarily banned from new contracts with the US government.  BP and the Department of Justice agreed to a record-setting $4.525&amp;nbsp;billion in fines and other payments.&lt;ref name=nyt151112/&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes290113/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-21"/&gt;  {{as of|2013|February|}}, criminal and civil settlements and payments to a trust fund had cost the company $42.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2013/02/05/bp-fighting-a-two-front-war-as-macondo-continues-to-bite-and-production-drops/ | work=Forbes | first=Agustino | last=Fontevecchia | title=BP Fighting A Two Front War As Macondo Continues To Bite And Production Drops – Forbes | date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that BP was primarily responsible for the oil spill because of its gross negligence and reckless conduct.&lt;ref name="Times - barbier - 18 billion"/&gt; In July 2015, BP agreed to pay $18.7 billion in fines, the largest corporate settlement in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/02/us-bp-gulfmexico-settlement-idUSKCN0PC1BW20150702|title=BP reaches $18.7 billion settlement over deadly 2010 spill|work=Reuters|date=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The well is situated in the [[Macondo Prospect]] in [[Mississippi Canyon]] Block 252 (MC252) of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], in the United States' [[exclusive economic zone]]. The [[Macondo well]] is found roughly {{convert|41|mi}} off the [[Louisiana]] coast.&lt;ref name="USA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP"/&gt; BP was the operator and principal developer of the Macondo Prospect with a 65% share, while 25% was owned by [[Anadarko Petroleum Corporation]], and 10% by [[Mitsui Oil Exploration Co.#United States operations|MOEX Offshore 2007]], a unit of [[Mitsui]].&lt;ref name="subsea"/&gt;

===Explosion===

{{Main|Deepwater Horizon explosion}}[[File:Deepwater Horizon fire seen by US Coast Guard helicopter.ogv|thumb|Supply boats continued to battle the fire, viewed from a Coast Guard helicopter]]

At approximately {{Nowrap|9:45&amp;nbsp;pm [[Central Time Zone (Americas)|CDT]]}}, on 20 April 2010, high-pressure [[methane]] gas from the well expanded into the [[marine riser|drilling riser]] and rose into the drilling rig, where it ignited and exploded, engulfing the platform.&lt;ref name="upstream220410" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo1" /&gt; At the time, 126 crew members were on board: seven BP employees, 79 of Transocean, and employees of various other companies.&lt;ref name="mail180610" /&gt;  Eleven missing workers were never found despite a three-day [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] (USCG) search operation and are believed to have died in the explosion.&lt;ref name="Times search end" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huffington151112a" /&gt; Ninety-four crew members were rescued by [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or helicopter, 17 of whom were treated for injuries.&lt;ref name="upstream220410" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nola 0422" /&gt; The Deepwater Horizon sank on the morning of 22 April 2010.

The oil leak was discovered on the afternoon of 22 April 2010 when a large oil slick began to spread at the former rig site.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-24"/&gt; The oil flowed for 87 days. BP originally estimated a flow rate of {{convert|1000|to|5000|oilbbl/d}}. The [[Flow Rate Technical Group]] (FRTG) estimated the initial flow rate was {{convert|62000|oilbbl/d}}.&lt;ref name="BBC 29/4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-28"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AP 60k barrels"/&gt; The total estimated volume of leaked oil approximated [[Orders of magnitude (volume)#Terrestrial|{{convert|4.9|Moilbbl|MUSgal m3}}]] with plus or minus 10% uncertainty,&lt;ref name=report2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=report2011Live/&gt; including oil that was collected,&lt;ref name="ap110113"/&gt; making it the world's largest accidental spill.&lt;ref name=nyt020810/&gt;&lt;ref name=hoch&gt;{{cite news|first=Maureen |last= Hoch |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2010/08/new-estimate-puts-oil-leak-at-49-million-barrels.html |title=New Estimate Puts Gulf Oil Leak at 205 Million Gallons |publisher=MacNeil/Lehrer Productions|work = PBS NewsHour|date = 2 August 2010 |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; BP challenged the higher figure, saying that the government overestimated the volume. Internal emails released in 2013 showed that one BP employee had estimates that matched those of the FRTG, and shared the data with supervisors, but BP continued with their lower number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/08/bp-oil-spill-flow-rate-emails_n_2260275.html | work=Huffington Post | first=John | last=Rudolf | title=New BP Oil Spill Emails Suggest Cover-Up | date=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oilprice/&gt; The company argued that government figures do not reflect over {{convert|810000|oilbbl|MUSgal m3}} of oil that was collected or burned before it could enter the Gulf waters.&lt;ref name="ap110113"/&gt;

According to the satellite images, the spill directly affected {{convert|68000|sqmi}} of ocean, which is comparable to the size of [[Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name="area of spill"/&gt;&lt;ref name=norse&gt;{{cite journal | title= Impacts, Perception, and Policy Implications of the BP/Deepwater Horizon Oil and Gas Disaster | first1 = Elliott A. | last1 = Norse | first2 = John |last2 = Amos | journal = Environmental Law Reporter | url= http://mcbi.marine-conservation.org/publications/pub_pdfs/Norse-and-Amos-2010.pdf |date=November 2010 | volume = 40 | issue = 11 | pages = 11058–11073 | accessdate = 22 February 2013 | issn = 0046-2284}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early June 2010, oil had washed up on {{convert|125|mi}} of Louisiana's coast and along the Mississippi, Florida, and Alabama coastlines.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-50"/&gt; Oil sludge appeared in the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] and on [[Pensacola Beach]] and the [[Gulf Islands National Seashore]].&lt;ref name=Kunzelman/&gt; In late June, oil reached [[Gulf Park Estates, Mississippi|Gulf Park Estates]], its first appearance in Mississippi.&lt;ref name="McConnaughey"/&gt; In July, [[Tarball (oil)|tar balls]] reached [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]] and the shores of [[Lake Pontchartrain]].&lt;ref name=Lozano/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-51"/&gt; In September a new wave of oil suddenly coated {{convert|16|mi}} of Louisiana coastline and marshes west of the Mississippi River in [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines Parish]].&lt;ref name="AutoBB-52"/&gt; In October, weathered oil reached Texas.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-53"/&gt; {{as of|2011|July|}}, about {{convert|491|mi}} of coastline in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida were contaminated by oil and a total of {{convert|1074|mi}} had been oiled since the spill began.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-12"/&gt; {{as of|2012|December|}}, {{convert|339|mi}} of coastline remain subject to evaluation and/or cleanup operations.&lt;ref name=Ramseur/&gt;

Concerns were raised about the appearance of underwater, horizontally extended plumes of dissolved oil. Researchers concluded that deep plumes of dissolved oil and gas would likely remain confined to the northern Gulf of Mexico and that the peak impact on dissolved oxygen would be delayed and long lasting.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-62"/&gt;
Two weeks after the wellhead was capped on 15 July 2010, the surface oil appeared to have dissipated, while an unknown amount of subsurface oil remained.&lt;ref name="GillisRobertson"/&gt; Estimates of the residual ranged from a 2010 NOAA report that claimed about half of the oil remained below the surface to independent estimates of up to 75%.&lt;ref name=Talev/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-43"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-44"/&gt;

That means that over {{convert|100|e6USgal}} (2.4 million barrels) remained in the Gulf.&lt;ref name="Ramseur" /&gt; {{as of|2011|January|}}, tar balls, oil sheen trails, fouled wetlands marsh grass and coastal sands were still evident. Subsurface oil remained offshore and in fine silts.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-10" /&gt; In April 2012, oil was still found along as much as {{convert|200|mi}} of Louisiana coastline and tar balls continued to wash up on the barrier islands.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-15" /&gt; In 2013, some scientists at the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill and Ecosystem Science Conference said that as much as one-third of the oil may have mixed with deep ocean sediments, where it risks damage to ecosystems and commercial fisheries.&lt;ref name="nature260113" /&gt;

In 2013, more than {{convert|4600000|lb|t}} of "oiled material" was removed from the Louisiana coast.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nwf.org/2013/06/40000-pound-tar-mat-reminds-us-the-oil-spill-is-not-over/|title=40,000-Pound Tar Mat Reminds Us the Oil Spill is Not Over|publisher=|date=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although only "minute" quantities of oil continued to wash up in 2013, patches of tar balls were still being reported almost every day from Alabama and Florida Panhandle beaches. Regular cleanup patrols were no longer considered justified but cleanup was being conducted on an as-needed basis, in response to public reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/16/gulf-oil-spill-cleanup_n_3451488.html | work=Huffington Post | title=BP Pulls Out of Gulf Cleanup, Leaving Unanswered Questions Behind | date=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first thought that oil had not reached as far as [[Tampa Bay, Florida]]; however, a study done in 2013 found that one of the plumes of dispersant-treated oil had reached a shelf {{convert|80|mi}} off the Tampa Bay region.  According to researchers, there is "some evidence it may have caused lesions in fish caught in that area".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Toxicity and Mutagenicity of Gulf of Mexico Waters During and After the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill|first1=John H.|last1=Paul|first2=David|last2=Hollander|first3=Paula|last3=Coble|first4=Kendra L.|last4=Daly|first5=Sue|last5=Murasko|first6=David|last6=English|first7=Jonelle|last7=Basso|first8=Jennifer|last8=Delaney|first9=Lauren|last9=McDaniel|first10=Charles W.|last10=Kovach|date=3 September 2013|journal=Environ.

[[File:BP oil containment domes.jpg|thumb|right|Concept diagram of underwater oil containment domes originally planned for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. At this stage, there were 2 remaining oil leaks from the fallen pipeline.]]
[[File:Oil containment chamber Port Fourchon LA 100426-G-8744K-021.jpg|thumb|upright|Oil [[containment dome]] under construction in Port Fourchon, Louisiana, at [[Wild Well Control]] on 26 April]]

First, BP unsuccessfully attempted to close the [[blowout preventer]] valves on the wellhead with [[Remotely operated vehicle|remotely operated underwater vehicles]].&lt;ref name=leakfix/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 02/5"/&gt; Next, it placed a 125-tonne (280,000&amp;nbsp;lb) containment dome over the largest leak and piped the oil to a storage vessel. While this technique had worked in shallower water, it failed here when gas combined with cold water to form [[Methane clathrate|methane hydrate]] crystals that blocked the opening at the top of the dome.&lt;ref name="thestar1405"/&gt; Pumping heavy [[drilling fluid]]s into the blowout preventer to restrict the flow of oil before sealing it permanently with cement ("[[top kill]]") also failed.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-81"/&gt;

BP then inserted a riser insertion tube into the pipe and a stopper-like washer around the tube plugged at the end of the riser and diverted the flow into the insertion tube.&lt;ref name="upstream150510"/&gt; The collected gas was flared and oil stored on board the [[drillship]] ''[[Discoverer Enterprise]]''.&lt;ref name="bp240510"/&gt; Before the tube was removed, it collected {{convert|924000|USgal|oilbbl m3}} of oil.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-82"/&gt; On 3 June 2010, BP removed the damaged [[drilling riser]] from the top of the blowout preventer and covered the pipe by the cap which connected it to another riser.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-83"/&gt; On 16 June, a second containment system connected directly to the blowout preventer began carrying oil and gas to service vessels, where it was consumed in a clean-burning system.&lt;ref name="upstream170610"/&gt; The United States government's estimates suggested the cap and other equipment were capturing less than half of the leaking oil.&lt;ref name="Kunzelman"/&gt; On 10 July, the containment cap was removed to replace it with a better-fitting cap ("Top Hat Number 10").&lt;ref name="AutoBB-84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-85"/&gt; Mud and cement were later pumped in through the top of the well to reduce the pressure inside it which didn't work either. A final device was created to attach a chamber of larger diameter than the flowing pipe with a flange that bolted to the top of the blowout preventer and a manual valve set to close off the flow once attached. On 15 July, the device was secured and time was taken closing the valves to ensure the attachment under increasing pressure until the valves were closed completing the temporary measures.&lt;ref name="Yahoo7-20100715"/&gt;

===Explosives ===

In mid-May, United States Secretary of Energy [[Steven Chu]] assembled a team of nuclear physicists, including [[hydrogen bomb]] designer [[Richard Garwin]] and [[Sandia National Laboratories]] director Tom Hunter.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-86"/&gt; Oil expert [[Matthew Simmons]] maintained that a nuclear explosion was the only way BP could permanently seal the well and cited successful Soviet attempts to seal off runaway gas wells with nuclear blasts. A spokesperson for the U.S. Energy Department said that "neither Energy Secretary Steven Chu nor anyone else" ever considered this option.&lt;ref name=cnbc020610/&gt;&lt;ref name=raw290510/&gt; On 24 May, BP ruled out conventional explosives, claiming that if blasts failed to clog the well, "we would have denied ourselves all other options."&lt;ref name="AutoBB-87"/&gt;

=== Well declared "effectively dead" ===

Transocean's ''[[Development Driller III]]'' started drilling a first [[relief well]] on 2 May 2010. ''[[GSF Development Driller II]]'' started drilling a second relief on 16 May 2010.&lt;ref name="relief_map"/&gt;&lt;ref name="upstream170510"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-90"/&gt; On 3 August 2010, first test oil and then drilling mud was pumped at a slow rate of approximately {{convert|2|oilbbl|L}} per minute into the well-head. Pumping continued for eight hours, at the end of which time the well was declared to be "in a static condition."&lt;ref name="AutoBB-91"/&gt; On 4 August 2010, BP began pumping cement from the top, sealing that part of the flow channel permanently.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-92"/&gt;

On 3 September 2010, the 300-[[ton]] failed blowout preventer was removed from the well and a replacement blowout preventer was installed.&lt;ref name="20100903BlowoutPreventerRemoved"/&gt;&lt;ref name="20100904BlowoutPreventerOnBoat"/&gt; On 16 September 2010, the relief well reached its destination and pumping of cement to seal the well began.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-93"/&gt; On 19 September 2010, [[National Incident Commander]] [[Thad Allen]] declared the well "effectively dead" and said that it posed no further threat to the Gulf.&lt;ref name="Aspress"/&gt;

===Recurrent or continued leakage===
[[File:Flickr - DVIDSHUB - Oil Spill.jpg|thumb|The Discoverer Enterprise and the Q4000 work around the clock burning undesirable gases from the still uncapped Deepwater Horizon well in the Gulf of Mexico. 26 June 2010]]
In May 2010, BP admitted they had "discovered things that were broken in the sub-surface" during the "top kill" effort.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Oil slicks were reported in March&lt;ref name=msnbc220311/&gt; and August 2011,&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref name="aljazeera3"/&gt; in March&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"/&gt; and October 2012,&lt;ref name="AutoBB-98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-99"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aeppli_2013&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 2013.&lt;ref name=onwingsofcare/&gt; Repeated scientific analyses confirmed that the sheen was a chemical match for oil from Macondo well.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-95"/&gt;

The USCG initially said the oil was too dispersed to recover and posed no threat to the coastline,&lt;ref name=nola010911/&gt; but later warned BP and Transocean that they might be held financially responsible for cleaning up the new oil.&lt;ref name=nola101012/&gt; USGS director [[Marcia McNutt]] stated that the riser pipe could hold at most {{convert|1000|oilbbl}} because it is open on both ends, making it unlikely to hold the amount of oil being observed.&lt;ref name=bw111012/&gt;

In October 2012, BP reported that they had found and plugged leaking oil from the failed containment dome, now abandoned about {{convert|1500|ft}} from the main well.&lt;ref name=cbc171212/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbc131212/&gt;&lt;ref name=nola251012/&gt; In December 2012, the USCG conducted a subsea survey; no oil coming from the wells or the wreckage was found and its source remains unknown.&lt;ref name=Ramseur/&gt;&lt;ref name=nola281212/&gt; In addition, a white, milky substance was observed seeping from the wreckage. According to BP and the USCG, it is "not oil and it's not harmful."&lt;ref name=cbs310113/&gt;

In January 2013, BP said that they were continuing to investigate possible sources of the oil sheen. Chemical data implied that the substance might be residual oil leaking from the wreckage. If that proves to be the case, the sheen can be expected to eventually disappear. Another possibility is that it is formation oil escaping from the subsurface, using the Macondo well casing as flow conduit, possibly intersecting a naturally occurring fault, and then following that to escape at the surface some distance from the wellhead. If it proves to be oil from the subsurface, then that could indicate the possibility of an indefinite release of oil. The oil slick was comparable in size to [[cold seeps|naturally occurring oil seeps]] and was not large enough to pose an immediate threat to wildlife.&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC-Sheen-1-13"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://science.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/01/31/16792048-mystery-oil-sheen-grows-near-site-of-bp-gulf-disaster-says-researcher | title=Mystery 'oil sheen' grows near site of BP Gulf disaster, says researcher | work=NBC News | date=31 January 2013 | accessdate=21 February 2014 | author=Roach, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Containment, collection and use of dispersants ==
{{main|Deepwater Horizon oil spill response}}
The fundamental strategies for addressing the spill were containment, dispersal and removal.  In summer 2010, approximately 47,000&amp;nbsp;people and 7,000&amp;nbsp;vessels were involved in the project. By 3 October 2012, federal response costs amounted to $850&amp;nbsp;million, mostly reimbursed by BP.  {{as of|2013|January|}}, 935&amp;nbsp;personnel were still involved. By that time cleanup had cost BP over $14&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=Ramseur/&gt;

It was estimated with plus-or-minus 10% uncertainty that {{convert|4.9|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil was released from the well; {{convert|4.1|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil went into the Gulf.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-153"/&gt; The report led by the Department of the Interior and the NOAA said that "75% [of oil] has been cleaned up by Man or Mother Nature"; however, only about 25% of released oil was collected or removed while about 75% of oil remained in the environment in one form or another.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-149"/&gt; In 2012, Markus Huettel, a [[Benthic zone|benthic ecologist]] at Florida State University, maintained that while much of BP's oil was degraded or evaporated, at least 60% remains unaccounted for.&lt;ref name=ng220312/&gt;

In May 2010, a local native set up a network for people to volunteer their assistance in cleaning up beaches. Boat captains were given the opportunity to offer the use of their boat to help clean and prevent the oil from further spreading. To assist with the efforts the captains had to register their ships with the Vessels of Opportunity, however an issue arose when more boats registered than actually participated in the clean up efforts - only a third of the registered boats. Many local supporters were disappointed with BP's slow response, prompting the formation of The Florida Key Environmental Coalition.  This coalition gained significant influence in the clean up of the oil spill to try and gain some control over the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/florida-keys-environmentalists-act-protect-against-bp-oil-spill-summer-2010|title=Florida Keys environmentalists act to protect against BP oil spill summer 2010 {{!}} Global Nonviolent Action Database|website=nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Containment ===
[[File:Tedx-oil-spill-0075.jpg|thumb|right|Oil containment boom used in an attempt to protect barrier islands]]
[[Boom (containment)|Containment booms]] stretching over {{convert|4200000|ft|km}} were deployed, either to corral the oil or as barriers to protect marshes, mangroves, shrimp/crab/oyster ranches or other ecologically sensitive areas. Booms extend {{convert|18|-|48|in|m}} above and below the water surface and were effective only in relatively calm and slow-moving waters. Including one-time use [[sorbent]] booms, a total of {{convert|13300000|ft|km}} of booms were deployed.&lt;ref name=butler/&gt; Booms were criticized for washing up on the shore with the oil, allowing oil to escape above or below the boom, and for ineffectiveness in more than three to four-foot (90–120&amp;nbsp;cm) waves.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-104"/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian190610/&gt;&lt;ref name=mnn090610/&gt;

The [[Louisiana barrier island plan]] was developed to construct [[barrier island]]s to protect the coast of Louisiana. The plan was criticised for its expense and poor results.&lt;ref name=sa080610/&gt;&lt;ref name=pm220610/&gt; Critics allege that the decision to pursue the project was political with little scientific input.&lt;ref name=advocate110710/&gt; The EPA expressed concern that the booms would threaten wildlife.&lt;ref name=ap090910/&gt;

For a time, a group called Matter of Trust, citing insufficient availability of manufactured oil absorption booms, campaigned to encourage hair salons, dog groomers and sheep farmers to donate hair, fur and wool clippings, stuffed in pantyhose or tights, to help contain oil near impacted shores, a technique dating back to the Exxon Valdez disaster.&lt;ref name="BBC News human hair mats"&gt;{{cite web |title=How can human hair mop up the oil spill? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8674539.stm |website=BBC News |accessdate=5 June 2018 |date=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wash Post May 2010 hair booms"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Farhi |first1=Paul |title=Matter of Trust creates hair-and-nylon booms to help clean up BP oil spill in Gulf |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/07/AR2010050704893.html |website=Washington Post |accessdate=5 June 2018 |date=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of Corexit dispersant ===
[[File:C-130 support oil spill cleanup.jpg|thumb|right|A C-130 Hercules sprays [[Corexit]] dispersant onto the Gulf of Mexico|alt=A large four propeller airplane sprays Corexit onto oil-sheen water]]
The spill was also notable for the volume of [[Corexit]] [[Oil dispersants|oil dispersant]] used and for application methods that were "purely experimental."&lt;ref name=butler/&gt; Altogether, {{convert|1.84|e6USgal|m3}} of dispersants were used; of this {{convert|771000|USgal|m3}} were released at the wellhead.&lt;ref name=staff4/&gt; Subsea injection had never previously been tried but due to the spill's unprecedented nature BP together with USCG and EPA decided to use it.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-120"/&gt; Over 400&amp;nbsp;sorties were flown to release the product.&lt;ref name=butler/&gt; Although usage of dispersants was described as "the most effective and fast moving tool for minimizing shoreline impact",&lt;ref name=butler/&gt; the approach continues to be investigated.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-114"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-115"/&gt;

A 2011 analysis conducted by [[Earthjustice]] and Toxipedia showed that the dispersant could contain cancer-causing agents, hazardous toxins and [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine-disrupting]] chemicals.&lt;ref name=pqarchiver/&gt; Environmental scientists expressed concerns that the dispersants add to the toxicity of a spill, increasing the threat to [[sea turtle]]s and [[bluefin tuna]]. The dangers are even greater when poured into the source of a spill, because they are picked up by the current and wash through the Gulf.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-127"/&gt; According to BP and federal officials, dispersant use stopped after the cap was in place;&lt;ref name=Bolstad/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-139"/&gt; however, marine toxicologist [[Riki Ott]] wrote in an open letter to the EPA that Corexit use continued after that date&lt;ref name="AutoBB-138"/&gt; and a [[Government Accountability Project|GAP]] investigation stated that "[a] majority of GAP witnesses cited indications that Corexit was used after [July 2010]."&lt;ref name=GAP&gt;{{cite web|title=Corexit: Deadly Dispersant in Oil Spill Cleanup|url=http://www.whistleblower.org/program-areas/public-health/corexit|work=GAP|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a NALCO manual obtained by [[Government Accountability Project|GAP]], Corexit 9527 is an “eye and skin irritant. Repeated or excessive exposure ... may cause injury to red blood cells (hemolysis), kidney or the liver.” The manual adds: “Excessive exposure may cause central nervous system effects, nausea, vomiting, anesthetic or narcotic effects.” It advises, “Do not get in eyes, on skin, on clothing,” and “Wear suitable protective clothing.” For Corexit 9500 the manual advised, “Do not get in eyes, on skin, on clothing,” “Avoid breathing vapor,” and “Wear suitable protective clothing.” According to [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] requests obtained by GAP, neither the protective gear nor the manual were distributed to Gulf oil spill cleanup workers.

Corexit EC9500A and Corexit EC9527A were the principal variants.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-116"/&gt; The two formulations are neither the least toxic, nor the most effective, among EPA's approved dispersants, but BP said it chose to use Corexit because it was available the week of the rig explosion.&lt;ref name=csm0515/&gt;&lt;ref name=csm0517/&gt; On 19 May, the EPA gave BP 24&amp;nbsp;hours to choose less toxic alternatives to Corexit from the National Contingency Plan Product Schedule, and begin applying them within 72 hours of EPA approval or provide a detailed reasoning why no approved products met the standards.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-131"/&gt; On 20 May, BP determined that none of the alternative products met all three criteria of availability, non-toxicity and effectiveness.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-133"/&gt; On 24 May, EPA Administrator [[Lisa P. Jackson]] ordered EPA to conduct its own evaluation of alternatives and ordered BP to reduce dispersant use by 75%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/science/earth/01dispersants.html | work=The New York Times | first=Matthew L. | last=Wald | title=BP Used Much Dispersant Despite E.P.A. Directive of Rarely | date=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-134"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-135"/&gt; BP reduced Corexit use by {{convert|25689|to|23250|USgal|L}} per day, a 9% decline.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-136"/&gt; On 2 August 2010, the EPA said dispersants did no more harm to the environment than the oil and that they stopped a large amount of oil from reaching the coast by breaking it down faster.&lt;ref name="Bolstad"/&gt; However, some independent scientists and EPA's own experts continue to voice concerns about the approach.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

Underwater injection of Corexit into the leak may have created the oil plumes which were discovered below the surface.&lt;ref name=csm0517/&gt; Because the dispersants were applied at depth, much of the oil never rose to the surface.&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt; One plume was {{convert|22|mi}} long, more than {{convert|1|mi|m}} wide and {{convert|650|ft}} deep.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-141"/&gt; In a major study on the plume, experts were most concerned about the slow pace at which the oil was breaking down in the cold, {{convert|40|°F|°C|sp=us}} water at depths of {{convert|3000|ft|-2}}.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-142"/&gt;

In late 2012, a study from [[Georgia Tech]] and [[Universidad Autonoma de Aguascalientes]] in Environmental Pollution journal reported that Corexit used during the BP oil spill had increased the [[toxicity]] of the oil by 52 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/what-bp-doesnt-want-you-know-about-2010-gulf-spill-63015|title=Drowning in Oil|date=22 April 2013|publisher=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scientists concluded that "Mixing oil with dispersant increased toxicity to ecosystems" and made the gulf oil spill worse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/12/chemical-dispersant-made-bps-gulf-oilspill-52-times-more-toxic|title=Chemical Dispersant Made BP Oilspill 52 Times More Toxic|publisher=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/50032789/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/dispersant-makes-oil-spills-times-more-toxic/|title=Dispersant makes oil from spills 52 times more toxic|date=30 November 2012|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Removal ===

[[File:Skimming Oil in Gulf of Mexico.jpg|thumb|right|Oil skimming vessels (distance) in the Gulf of Mexico]]
[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 100506-N-6070S-819.jpg|thumb|right|Dark clouds of smoke and fire emerge as oil burns during a controlled fire in the Gulf of Mexico, 6 May 2010]]
The three basic approaches for removing the oil from the water were: combustion, offshore filtration, and collection for later processing. USCG said {{convert|33|e6USgal|m3}} of tainted water was recovered, including {{convert|5|e6USgal|m3}} of oil. BP said {{convert|826800|oilbbl}} had been recovered or flared.&lt;ref name=Schoof/&gt; It is calculated that about 5% of leaked oil was burned at the surface and 3% was skimmed.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-149"/&gt; On the most demanding day 47,849 people were assigned on the response works.&lt;ref name=report2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=report2011Live/&gt;

From April to mid-July 2010, 411&amp;nbsp;controlled ''in-situ'' fires remediated approximately {{convert|265000|oilbbl|MUSgal m3}}.&lt;ref name=butler/&gt; The fires released small amounts of [[toxin]]s, including cancer-causing [[dioxin]]s. According to [[EPA]]'s report, the released amount is not enough to pose an added cancer risk to workers and coastal residents, while a second research team concluded that there was only a small added risk.&lt;ref name=ap121110/&gt;

[[File:Beach Clean up during DWH (8743617563).jpg|thumb|left|Workers cleaning a beach affected by the spill.]]

Oil was collected from water by using [[Skimmer (machine)|skimmers]]. In total 2,063 various skimmers were used.&lt;ref name=report2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=report2011Live/&gt; For offshore, more than 60&amp;nbsp;open-water skimmers were deployed, including 12&amp;nbsp;purpose-built vehicles.&lt;ref name=butler/&gt; EPA regulations prohibited skimmers that left more than 15 parts per million (ppm) of oil in the water. Many large-scale skimmers exceeded the limit.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-144"/&gt; Due to use of [[Corexit]] the oil was too dispersed to collect, according to a spokesperson for shipowner [[TMT (Today Makes Tomorrow)|TMT]].&lt;ref name="AutoBB-148"/&gt; In mid-June 2010, BP ordered 32&amp;nbsp;machines that [[Centrifugal water-oil separator|separate oil and water]], with each machine capable of extracting up to {{convert|2000|oilbbl/d}}.&lt;ref name="The_Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes20100624"/&gt; After one week of testing, BP began to proceed&lt;ref name="abcnews1"/&gt; and by 28 June, had removed {{convert|890000|oilbbl|m3}}.&lt;ref name="BP100626"/&gt;

After the well was captured, the cleanup of shore became the main task of the response works. Two main types of affected coast were sandy beaches and [[marsh]]es. On beaches the main techniques were sifting sand, removing tar balls, and digging out tar mats manually or by using mechanical devices.&lt;ref name=report2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=report2011Live/&gt; For marshes, techniques such as vacuum and pumping, low-pressure flush, vegetation cutting, and [[bioremediation]] were used.&lt;ref name=butler/&gt;

=== Oil-eating microbes ===
Dispersants are said to facilitate the digestion of the oil by microbes. Mixing dispersants with oil at the wellhead would keep some oil below the surface and in theory, allowing [[microbe]]s to digest the oil before it reached the surface. Various risks were identified and evaluated, in particular that an increase in microbial activity might reduce subsea oxygen levels, threatening fish and other animals.&lt;ref name="science735"/&gt;

Several studies suggest that microbes successfully consumed part of the oil.&lt;ref name=Ramseur/&gt;&lt;ref name=valentine/&gt; By mid-September, other research claimed that microbes mainly digested natural gas rather than oil.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-158"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-microbes-helped-clean-bp-s-oil-spill|title=How Microbes Helped Clean BP's Oil Spill|first=David|last=Biello|publisher=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt; David L. Valentine, a professor of microbial geochemistry at [[UC Santa Barbara]], said that the capability of microbes to break down the leaked oil had been greatly exaggerated.&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"/&gt;  However, biogeochemist Chris Reddy, said natural microorganisms are a big reason why the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was not far worse.&lt;ref name="MicrobesSA2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Biello|first1=David|title=How Microbes Helped Clean BP's Oil Spill|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-microbes-helped-clean-bp-s-oil-spill/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=26 December 2017|date=28 April 2015|quote=The microbes did a spectacular job of eating a lot of the natural gas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MicrobesSA2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Biello|first1=David|title=Slick Solution: How Microbes Will Clean Up the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-microbes-clean-up-oil-spills/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=26 December 2017|date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetically modified]] ''[[Alcanivorax borkumensis]]'' was added to the waters to speed digestion.&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-160"/&gt; The delivery method of microbes to oil patches was proposed by the Russian [[Research and Development Institute of Ecology and the Sustainable Use of Natural Resources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= West Siberian research institute to help clean up Deepwater Horizon spill|url= http://en.rian.ru/business/20100727/159965187.html|agency= [[RIA Novosti]]|location= Moscow|date= 27 July 2010|accessdate= 8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup==
On 15 April 2014, BP claimed that cleanup along the coast was substantially complete, but the [[United States Coast Guard]] responded by stating that a lot of work remained. Using physical barriers such as floating booms, cleanup workers' objective was to keep the oil from spreading any further. They used skimmer boats to remove a majority of the oil and they used [[sorbent]]s to absorb any remnant of oil like a sponge. Although that method did not remove the oil completely, chemicals called [[dispersant]]s are used to hasten the oil's degradation to prevent the oil from doing further damage to the marine habitats below the surface water. For the Deep Horizon oil spill, cleanup workers used {{convert|1400000|usgal}} of various chemical dispersants to further breakdown the oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gulf Oil Spill|url = http://ocean.si.edu/gulf-oil-spill|website = Smithsonian Ocean Portal|accessdate = 23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State of Louisiana was funded by BP to do regular testing of fish, shellfish, water, and sand. Initial testing regularly showed detectable levels of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, a chemical used in the clean up. Testing over the past year reported by GulfSource.org, for the pollutants tested have not produced results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulfsource.org/ GulfSource.org] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517175405/http://www.gulfsource.org/ |date=17 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Turtle Rescue and Rehabilitation.jpg|thumb|left|Capturing heavily oiled young turtles 20 to 40 miles offshore for rehabilitation; 14 June 2010]]
The spill area hosts 8,332&amp;nbsp;species, including more than 1,270&amp;nbsp;fish, 604 [[polychaete]]s, 218&amp;nbsp;birds, 1,456&amp;nbsp;[[mollusks]], 1,503&amp;nbsp;[[crustacean]]s, 4&amp;nbsp;sea turtles and 29&amp;nbsp;marine mammals.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-165" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-166" /&gt; Between May and June 2010, the spill waters contained 40 times more [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs) than before the spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/ua/ncs/archives/2010/sep/osu-researchers-find-heightened-levels-known-carcinogens-gulf|title=OSU researchers find heightened levels of known carcinogens in Gulf – News and Research Communications|publisher=Oregon State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-174" /&gt; PAHs are often linked to oil spills and include [[carcinogen]]s and chemicals that pose various health risks to humans and marine life. The PAHs were most concentrated near the Louisiana Coast, but levels also jumped 2–3 fold in areas off Alabama, Mississippi and Florida.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-174" /&gt; PAHs can harm marine species directly and [[microbe]]s used to consume the oil can reduce marine [[oxygen]] levels.&lt;ref name="collins" /&gt;  The oil contained approximately 40% [[methane]] by weight, compared to about 5% found in typical oil deposits.&lt;ref name="methane" /&gt; Methane can potentially suffocate marine life and create "dead zones" where oxygen is depleted.&lt;ref name="methane" /&gt;

A 2014 study of the effects of the oil spill on [[bluefin tuna]] funded by [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), [[Stanford University]], and the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] and published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', found that the toxins from oil spills can cause irregular heartbeats leading to [[cardiac arrest]].  Calling the vicinity of the spill "one of the most productive ocean ecosystems in the world", the study found that even at very low concentrations "PAH cardiotoxicity was potentially a common form of injury among a broad range of species in the vicinity of the oil."&lt;ref name="LATimes-fish-toxins" /&gt; Another peer-reviewed study, released in March 2014 and conducted by 17 scientists from the United States and Australia and published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]], found that tuna and [[amberjack]] that were exposed to oil from the spill developed deformities of the heart and other organs that would be expected to be fatal or at least life-shortening.
The scientists said that their findings would most likely apply to other large predator fish and "even to humans, whose developing hearts are in many ways similar."  BP responded that the concentrations of oil in the study were a level rarely seen in the Gulf, but ''The New York Times'' reported that the BP statement was contradicted by the study.&lt;ref name="Wines-24-March-14" /&gt;

The oil dispersant [[Corexit]], previously only used as a surface application, was released underwater in unprecedented amounts, with the intent of making it more easily biodegraded by naturally occurring microbes. Thus, oil that would normally rise to the surface of the water was [[emulsified]] into tiny droplets and remained suspended in the water and on the sea floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/world/2010/06/05/14277081.html|title=Oil spill's environmental costs|publisher=Toronto Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The oil and dispersant mixture permeated the [[food chain]] through [[zooplankton]].&lt;ref name="AutoBB-174"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ortmann/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-187"/&gt; Signs of an oil-and-dispersant mix were found under the shells of tiny [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]] larvae.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; A study of insect populations in the coastal marshes affected by the spill also found a significant impact.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-191"/&gt; Chemicals from the spill were found in migratory birds as far away as Minnesota. [[Pelican]] eggs contained "petroleum compounds and Corexit".&lt;ref name="AutoBB-115"/&gt; Dispersant and PAHs from oil are believed to have caused "disturbing numbers" of [[mutated]] fish that scientists and commercial fishers saw in 2012, including 50% of shrimp found lacking eyes and eye sockets.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-197"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-196"/&gt; Fish with oozing sores and lesions were first noted by fishermen in November 2010.&lt;ref name="aljazeera2"/&gt; Prior to the spill, approximately 0.1% of Gulf fish had lesions or sores. A report from the [[University of Florida]] said that many locations showed 20% of fish with lesions, while later estimates reached 50%.&lt;ref name="aljazeera2"/&gt; In October 2013, [[Al Jazeera]] reported that the gulf ecosystem was "in crisis", citing a decline in seafood catches, as well as deformities and lesions found in fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/10/gulf-ecosystem-crisis-after-bp-spill-2013102065313544754.html|title=Gulf ecosystem in crisis after BP spill|first=Dahr|last=Jamail|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, it was reported that the spill was "already having a 'devastating' effect on marine life in the Gulf".&lt;ref name="AutoBB-195"/&gt;  Damage to the [[ocean floor]] especially endangered the [[Louisiana pancake batfish]] whose range is entirely contained within the spill-affected area.&lt;ref name="fish2fork"/&gt;  In March 2012, a definitive link was found between the death of a [[Deep-water coral|Gulf coral community]] and the spill.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-188"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-189"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-190"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abc031210"/&gt; According to NOAA, a [[cetacean]] Unusual Mortality Event (UME) has been recognized since before the spill began, NOAA is investigating possible contributing factors to the ongoing UME from the Deepwater Horizon spill, with the possibility of eventual criminal charges being filed if the spill is shown to be connected.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-13"/&gt; Some estimates are that only 2% of the carcasses of killed mammals have been recovered.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-183"/&gt;

Mike Robicheux, a Louisiana physician, described the situation as "the biggest public health crisis from a chemical poisoning in the history of this country."&lt;ref name=aljazeera170511/&gt; In July, after testing the blood of BP cleanup workers and residents in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida for [[volatile organic compound]]s, environmental scientist [[Wilma Subra]] said she was "finding amounts 5 to 10 times in excess of the 95th percentile"; she said that "the presence of these chemicals in the blood indicates exposure."&lt;ref name=aljazeera291010/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=democracynow070710/&gt; [[Riki Ott]], a marine toxicologist with experience of the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]], advised families to evacuate the Gulf.&lt;ref name=Aguilar22July&gt;Rose Aguilar, "[http://archive.truthout.org/toxic-dispersants-causing-widespread-illness61604 Experts: Health Hazards in Gulf Warrant Evacuations]", ''Truthout'', 22 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She said that workers from the Valdez spill had suffered long-term health consequences.&lt;ref&gt;"Health of Exxon Valdez cleanup workers was never studied", ''Herald-Review'' (McClatchy), 4 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 26 May 2010 hospitalization of seven fishermen that were working in the cleanup crew, BP requested that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health perform a Health Hazard Evaluation. This was to cover all offshore cleanup activities, BP later requested a second NIOSH investigation of onshore cleanup operations. Tests for chemical exposure in the seven fishermen were negative; NIOSH concluded that the hospitalizations were most likely a result of heat, fatigue, and terpenes that were being used to clean the decks. Review of 10 later hospitalizations found that heat exposure and dehydration were consistent findings but could not establish chemical exposure. NIOSH personnel performed air monitoring around cleanup workers at sea, on land, and during the application of Corexit. Air concentrations of volatile organic compounds and PAHs never exceeded permissible exposure levels. A limitation of their methodology was that some VOCs may have already evaporated from the oil before they began their investigation. In their report, they suggest the possibility that respiratory symptoms might have been caused by high levels of ozone or reactive aldehydes in the air, possibly produced from photochemical reactions in the oil. NIOSH did note that many of the personnel involved were not donning personal protective equipment (gloves and impermeable coveralls) as they had been instructed to and emphasized that this was important protection against transdermal absorption of chemicals from the oil.

A 2012 survey of the health effects of the spill on cleanup workers reported "eye, nose and throat irritation; respiratory problems; blood in urine, vomit and rectal bleeding; seizures; nausea and violent vomiting episodes that last for hours; skin irritation, burning and lesions; short-term memory loss and confusion; liver and kidney damage; central nervous system effects and nervous system damage; hypertension; and miscarriages". Dr. James Diaz, writing for the ''American Journal of Disaster Medicine'', said these ailments appearing in the Gulf reflected those reported after previous oil spills, like the Exxon Valdez. Diaz warned that "chronic adverse health effects, including cancers, liver and kidney disease, mental health disorders, birth defects and developmental disorders should be anticipated among sensitive populations and those most heavily exposed". Diaz also believes neurological disorders should be expected.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-239"/&gt;

Two years after the spill, a study initiated by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] found [[Biomarker (medicine)|biomarkers]] matching the oil from the spill in the bodies of cleanup workers. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Other studies have reported a variety of mental health issues, skin problems, breathing issues, coughing, and headaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=13-P13-00004&amp;segmentID=6|title=Living on Earth: Research Update on the Impact of BP Oil Spill|first=Living on Earth / World Media Foundation / Public Radio|last=International|publisher=LCE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, during the three-day "Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill &amp; Ecosystem Science Conference",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill &amp; Ecosystem Science Conference (21–23 January 2013, New Orleans, LA)|url=http://www.imber.info/Meetings/IMBER-Relevant-Meetings/meetings-2013/January-2013/Gulf-of-Mexico-Oil-Spill-Ecosystem-Science-Conference-21-23-January-2013-New-Orleans-LA|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; findings discussed included a '"significant percentage" of Gulf residents reporting mental health problems like anxiety, depression and [[PTSD]].

A study that investigated the health effects among children in Louisiana and Florida living less than 10 miles from the coast found that more than a third of the parents reported physical or mental health symptoms among their children. The parents reported "unexplained symptoms among their children, including bleeding ears, nose bleeds, and the early start of menstruation among girls," according to David Abramson, director of Columbia University's National Center for Disaster Preparedness.&lt;ref name=nola220113/&gt;

A cohort study of almost 2,200 Louisiana women found "high physical/environmental exposure was significantly associated with all 13 of the physical health symptoms surveyed, with the strongest associations for burning in nose, throat or lungs ; sore throat; dizziness and wheezing.

On 30 April 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] ordered the federal government to hold the issuing of new offshore drilling leases and authorized the investigation of 29&amp;nbsp;oil rigs in the Gulf in an effort to determine the cause of the disaster.&lt;ref name="bloomberg010510"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS/AP"/&gt; Later a six-month offshore drilling (below {{convert|500|ft}} of water) moratorium was enforced by the [[United States Department of the Interior]].&lt;ref name=upstream240610/&gt; The moratorium suspended work on 33&amp;nbsp;rigs,&lt;ref name=upstream240610/&gt; and a group of affected companies formed the [[Back to Work Coalition]].&lt;ref name="KATC web"&gt;{{cite web|last=Durio |first=Katie |title=Back to Work Coalition Established to Address Federal Permitting Issues |url=http://www.katc.com/news/back-to-work-coalition-established-to-address-federal-permitting-issues/#_ |publisher=KATC.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929001142/http://www.katc.com/news/back-to-work-coalition-established-to-address-federal-permitting-issues/ |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June, a [[United States federal judge]] on the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana]] [[Martin Leach-Cross Feldman]] when ruling in the case ''[[Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar]]'', lifted the moratorium finding it too broad, arbitrary and not adequately justified.&lt;ref name=upstream240610/&gt; The ban was lifted in October 2010.

On 28 April 2010, the [[National Energy Board]] of Canada, which regulates offshore drilling in the [[Canadian Arctic]] and along the [[British Columbia Coast]], issued a letter to oil companies asking them to explain their argument against safety rules which require same-season relief wells.&lt;ref name="canadian regulator response"/&gt; On 3 May California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] withdrew his support for a proposed plan to allow expanded [[Offshore oil and gas in California|offshore drilling projects in California]].&lt;ref name="CSM20100503"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC20100503"/&gt; On 8 July, Florida Governor [[Charlie Crist]] called for a special session of the state legislature to draft an amendment to the state constitution banning offshore drilling in state waters, which the legislature rejected on 20 July.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-242"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-243"/&gt;

In October 2011, the [[United States Department of the Interior]]'s [[Minerals Management Service]] was dissolved after it was determined it had exercised poor oversight over the drilling industry. Three new agencies replaced it, separating the regulation, leasing, and revenue collection responsibilities respectively, among the [[Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement]], the [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management]], and [[Office of Natural Resources Revenue]].

In March 2014, BP was again allowed to bid for oil and gas leases.&lt;ref name="Robertson and Schwartz"&gt;{{cite news|title = BP shifts its position on Gulf payouts|last1 = Robertson|first1 = Campbell|last2 = Schwartz|first2 = John|work = [[The Charlotte Observer]]|agency = [[The New York Times]]|date = 27 April 2014|page = 4A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NOLA BP Oil Flood Protest Take Tar From Feathers.JPG|thumb|Protesters advocating boycott of BP]]
On 30 April, President Obama dispatched the Secretaries of the [[U.S. Department of the Interior|Department of Interior]] and [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]], as well as the [[EPA Administrator]] and NOAA to the Gulf Coast to assess the disaster.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-278"/&gt; In his 15 June speech, Obama said, "This oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced... Make no mistake: we will fight this spill with everything we've got for as long as it takes. We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused. And we will do whatever's necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy."&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;  Interior Secretary Ken Salazar stated, "Our job basically is to keep the boot on the neck of British Petroleum."&lt;ref name="Rand Paul"/&gt; Some observers suggested that the Obama administration was being overly aggressive in its criticisms, which some BP investors saw as an attempt to deflect criticism of his own handling of the crisis.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-287"/&gt; [[Rand Paul]] accused President Obama of being anti-business and "un-American".&lt;ref name="Rand Paul"/&gt;

Public opinion polls in the U.S. were generally critical of the way President Obama and the federal government handled the disaster and they were extremely critical of BPs response. Across the US, thousands participated in dozens of protests at BP gas stations and other locations,&lt;ref name="AutoBB-279"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-281"/&gt; reducing sales at some stations by 10% to 40%.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-282"/&gt;

Industry claimed that disasters are infrequent and that this spill was an isolated incident and rejected claims of a loss of industry credibility.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-284"/&gt; The [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API) stated that the offshore drilling industry is important to job creation and economic growth.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-284"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-283"/&gt; CEOs from the top five oil companies all agreed to work harder at improving safety.  API announced the creation of an offshore safety institute, separate from API's lobbying operation.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-285"/&gt;

The [[Organization for International Investment]], a [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]]-based advocate for overseas investment in the United States, warned that the heated rhetoric was potentially damaging the reputation of British companies with operations in the United States and could spark a wave of U.S. protectionism that would restrict British firms from government contracts, political donations and lobbying.&lt;ref name="guardian140710"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-286"/&gt;

In July 2010, President Obama issued an executive order, specifically citing the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, that adopted recommendations from the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force and established the National Ocean Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-stewardship-ocean-our-coasts-and-great-lakes | title=Executive Order 13547 --Stewardship of the Ocean, Our Coasts, and the Great Lakes| date=19 July 2010| publisher=The White House Office of the Press Secretary| access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council called together a number of federal committees and departments engaged in ocean issues to work with a newly established committee for conservation and resource management.&lt;ref name=bglobe&gt;{{cite web| url=https://bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/06/21/trump-rescinds-obama-ocean-policy/8CLXSSGh9ZDu16k9MWkE5J/story.html| title=Trump rescinds Obama-era ocean policy| author=David Abel| date=22 June 2018| publisher=Boston Globe| access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, the executive order establishing the National Ocean Council was revoked by President Trump in an effort to roll back bureaucracy and "benefit ocean industries employ millions of Americans."&lt;ref name=bglobe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/28/bp-deepwater-horizon-oil-spill-report| title=Deepwater Horizon disaster altered building blocks of ocean life| author=Oliver Milman| date=28 June 2018| publisher=The Guardian| access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom reactions ===
In the UK, there was anger at the American press and news outlets for the misuse of the term "British Petroleum" for the company – a name which has not been used since British Petroleum merged with the American company [[Amoco]] in 1998 to form BP. It was said that the U.S. was 'dumping' the blame onto the British people and there were calls for British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] to protect British interests in the United States.  British pension fund managers (who have large holdings of BP shares and rely upon its dividends) accepted that while BP had to pay compensation for the spill and the environmental damage, they argued that the cost to the company's market value from President Obama's criticism was far outweighing the direct clean-up costs.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-287"/&gt;

Initially, BP downplayed the incident; its CEO [[Tony Hayward]] called the amount of oil and dispersant "relatively tiny" in comparison with the "very big ocean."&lt;ref name="AutoBB-288"/&gt; Later, he drew an outpouring of criticism when he said that the spill was a disruption to Gulf Coast residents and himself adding, "You know, I'd like my life back."&lt;ref name="AutoBB-289"/&gt; BP's chief operating officer [[Doug Suttles]] contradicted the underwater plume discussion noting, "It may be down to how you define what a plume is here… The oil that has been found is in very minute quantities."&lt;ref name="AutoBB-290"/&gt; In June, BP launched a PR campaign and successfully bid for several search terms related to the spill on Google and other search engines so that the first sponsored search result linked directly to the company's website.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-291"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-292"/&gt; On 26 July 2010, it was announced that CEO Tony Hayward was to resign and would be replaced by [[Bob Dudley]], who is an American citizen and previously worked for Amoco.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-293"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-294"/&gt;

Hayward's involvement in Deepwater Horizon has left him a highly controversial public figure. In May 2013, he was honored as a "distinguished leader" by the University of Birmingham, but his award ceremony was stopped on multiple occasions by jeers and walk-outs and the focus of a protest from [[People &amp; Planet]] members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wragg|first=Tom|url=http://brightgreenscotland.org/index.php/2013/03/why-we-disrupted-tony-haywood-at-the-university-of-birmingham/|title=Why we disrupted Tony Hayward’s award at the University of Birmingham|publisher=Bright Green|date=21 March 2013|accessdate=21 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329001725/http://brightgreenscotland.org/index.php/2013/03/why-we-disrupted-tony-haywood-at-the-university-of-birmingham/|archivedate=29 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Hayward was awarded an honorary degree from [[Robert Gordon University]]. This was described as "a very serious error of judgement" by Friends of the Earth Scotland, and "a sick joke" by the university's Student President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheyne|first=James|title=University defends degree for Deepwater Horizon boss Tony Hayward|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/232676-robert-gordon-university-gives-degree-to-former-bp-boss-tony-hayward/|publisher=STV|date=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International reactions ===
The U.S. government rejected offers of cleanup help from Canada, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United Nations. 
The U.S. State Department listed 70 assistance offers from 23 countries, all being initially declined, but later, 8 had been accepted.&lt;ref name="stpdf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-295"/&gt; The USCG actively requested skimming boats and equipment from several countries.&lt;ref name="csmhelp"/&gt;

=== Investigations ===
{{Main|Deepwater Horizon investigation}}
In the United States the ''Deepwater Horizon'' investigation included several investigations and commissions, including reports by the USCG National Incident Commander, Admiral [[Thad Allen]], the [[National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling]], [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement]] (BOEMRE), [[National Academy of Engineering]], [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], [[Government Accountability Office]], National Oil Spill Commission, and [[Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board]].&lt;ref name=Ramseur/&gt; The Republic of the Marshall Islands Maritime Administrator conducted a separate investigation on the marine casualty.&lt;ref name=MHL/&gt; BP conducted its internal investigation.

An investigation of the possible causes of the explosion was launched on 22 April 2010 by the USCG and the [[Minerals Management Service]].&lt;ref name=upstream220410/&gt; On 11 May the United States administration requested the National Academy of Engineering conduct an independent technical investigation.&lt;ref name=doi110510/&gt; The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling was established on 22 May to "consider the root causes of the disaster and offer options on safety and environmental precautions."&lt;ref name=wh220510/&gt; The investigation by [[United States Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] was announced on 1 June 2010.&lt;ref name="Holder-06-01"/&gt; Also the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] conducted a number of hearings, including hearings of Tony Hayward and heads of Anadarko and Mitsui's exploration unit.&lt;ref name=upstream170610/&gt;&lt;ref name=upstream090710a/&gt; According to the US Congressional investigation, the rig's [[blowout preventer]], built by [[Cameron International Corporation]], had a hydraulic leak and a failed battery, and therefore failed.&lt;ref name="BBC 13/5"/&gt;

On 8 September 2010, BP released a 193-page report on its web site. The report places some of the blame for the accident on BP but also on [[Halliburton]] and [[Transocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oilspillnews.net/bp-oil-spill-news/all-eyes-on-bp-report-on-gulf-oil-spill-disaster-%C2%AB-artesia-news/ |title=All eyes on BP report on Gulf |last1=Weber |first1=Harry R. |last2=Kunzelman |first2=Michael |last3=Cappiello |first3=Dina |work=Oil Spill News/Artesia News |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=8 September 2010 |accessdate=20 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723113948/http://www.oilspillnews.net/bp-oil-spill-news/all-eyes-on-bp-report-on-gulf-oil-spill-disaster-%C2%AB-artesia-news/ |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that on 20 April 2010, managers misread pressure data and gave their approval for rig workers to replace drilling fluid in the well with seawater, which was not heavy enough to prevent gas that had been leaking into the well from firing up the pipe to the rig, causing the explosion. The conclusion was that BP was partly to blame, as was Transocean, which owned the rig.&lt;ref name="dailymail1"/&gt; Responding to the report, Transocean and Halliburton placed all blame on BP.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Clayton for the Christian Science Monitor. 8 September 2010 [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0908/Transocean-Halliburton-blast-BP-report-on-cause-of-blowout-oil-spill Transocean, Halliburton blast BP report on cause of blowout, oil spill]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 November 2010, a report by the Oil Spill Commission said that there had been "a rush to completion" on the well and criticised poor management decisions. "There was not a culture of safety on that rig," the co-chair said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11720907|title=Gulf oil spill: President's panel says firms complacent|publisher=BBC|date= 9 November 2010|accessdate= 12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a final report on 5 January 2011.&lt;ref name="telegraph-finalreport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="osc-final-report"/&gt; The panel found that BP, Halliburton, and Transocean had attempted to work more cheaply and thus helped to trigger the explosion and ensuing leakage.&lt;ref name="msnbc-finalreport"/&gt; The report stated that "whether purposeful or not, many of the decisions that BP, Halliburton, and Transocean made that increased the risk of the Macondo blowout clearly saved those companies significant time (and money)."&lt;ref name="msnbc-finalreport"/&gt; BP released a statement in response to this, saying, that "even prior to the conclusion of the commission's investigation, BP instituted significant changes designed to further strengthen safety and risk management."&lt;ref name="nyt-finalreport"/&gt; Transocean, however, blamed BP for making the decisions before the actual explosion occurred and government officials for permitting those decisions.&lt;ref name="wpost-finalreport"/&gt; Halliburton stated that it was acting only upon the orders of BP when it injected the cement into the wall of the well.&lt;ref name="nyt-finalreport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="startribune-finalreport"/&gt; It criticized BP for its failure to run a [[cement bond log]] test.&lt;ref name="wpost-finalreport"/&gt; In the report, BP was accused of nine faults.&lt;ref name="nyt-finalreport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="startribune-finalreport"/&gt; One was that it had not used a diagnostic tool to test the strength of the cement.&lt;ref name="msnbc-finalreport"/&gt; Another was ignoring a pressure test that had failed.&lt;ref name="nyt-finalreport"/&gt; Still another was for not plugging the pipe with cement.&lt;ref name="msnbc-finalreport"/&gt; The study did not, however, place the blame on any one of these events. Rather, it concluded that "notwithstanding these inherent risks, the accident of April 20 was avoidable" and that "it resulted from clear mistakes made in the first instance by BP, Halliburton and Transocean, and by government officials who, relying too much on industry's assertions of the safety of their operations, failed to create and apply a program of regulatory oversight that would have properly minimized the risk of deepwater drilling."&lt;ref name="nyt-finalreport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="startribune-finalreport"/&gt; The panel also noted that the government regulators did not have sufficient knowledge or authority to notice these cost-cutting decisions.&lt;ref name="msnbc-finalreport"/&gt;

On 23 March 2011, BOEMRE (former MMS) and the USCG published a forensic examination report on the blowout preventer, prepared by [[Det Norske Veritas]].&lt;ref name=dnv230311/&gt; The report concluded that the primary cause of failure was that the blind shear rams failed to fully close and seal due to a portion of drill pipe buckling between the shearing blocks.

The US government report issued in September 2011 stated that BP is ultimately responsible for the spill, and that Halliburton and Transocean share some of the blame.&lt;ref name="BOERMEPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-296"/&gt; The report states that the main cause was the defective cement job, and Halliburton, BP and Transocean were, in different ways, responsible for the accident.&lt;ref name="BOERMEPR"/&gt; The report stated that, although the events leading to the sinking of Deepwater Horizon were set into motion by the failure to prevent a well blowout, the investigation revealed numerous systems deficiencies, and acts and omissions by Transocean and its ''Deepwater Horizon'' crew, that had an adverse impact on the ability to prevent or limit the magnitude of the disaster.  The report also states that a central cause of the blowout was failure of a cement barrier allowing hydrocarbons to flow up the wellbore, through the riser and onto the rig, resulting in the blowout.  The loss of life and the subsequent pollution of the Gulf of Mexico were the result of poor risk management, last‐minute changes to plans, failure to observe and respond to critical indicators, inadequate well control response, and insufficient emergency bridge response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling at the Macondo well and for the operation of the drilling platform.&lt;ref name="BOERMEPR"/&gt;

{{main|Gulf Coast Claims Facility}}
{{see also|Kenneth Feinberg}}

On 16 June 2010, after BP executives met with President Obama, BP announced and established the Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF), a $20 billion fund to settle claims arising from the Deepwater Horizon spill.&lt;ref name=upstream170610/&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonell"/&gt; This fund was set aside for natural resource damages, state and local response costs, and individual compensation, but could not be used for fines or penalties.&lt;ref name=upstream170610/&gt; Prior to establishing the GCCF, emergency compensation was paid by BP from an initial facility.&lt;ref name=bdo/&gt;

The GCCF was administrated by attorney [[Kenneth Feinberg]]. The facility began accepting claims on 23 August 2010.&lt;ref name=" McDonell"/&gt; On 8 March 2012, after BP and a team of plaintiffs' attorneys agreed to a class-action settlement, a court-supervised administrator Patrick Juneau took over administration.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-277"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap250412/&gt; Until this more than one million claims of 220,000 individual and business claimants were processed and more than $6.2 billion was paid out from the fund. 97% of payments were made to claimants in the [[States of the Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf States]].&lt;ref name=bdo/&gt; In June 2012, the settlement of claims through the GCCF was replaced by the court supervised settlement program.  During this transition period additional $404 million in claims were paid.&lt;ref name=ap100113/&gt;

The GCCF and its administrator Feinberg had been criticized about the amount and speed of payments as well as a lack of transparency.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-274"/&gt; An independent audit of the GCCF, announced by Attorney General Eric Holder, was approved by Senate on 21 October 2011.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-275"/&gt; An auditor [[BDO Consulting]] found that 7,300 claimants were wrongly denied or underpaid. As a result, about $64 million of additional payments was made.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-277"/&gt;
The Mississippi Center for Justice provided pro bono assistance to 10,000 people to help them "navigate the complex claims process." In a [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/opinion/shirking-responsibility-in-the-gulf.html ''New York Times''] opinion piece, Stephen Teague, staff attorney at the Mississippi Center for Justice, argued that BP had become "increasingly brazen" in "stonewalling payments." "But tens of thousands of gulf residents still haven't been fully compensated for their losses, and many are struggling to make ends meet. Many low-wage workers in the fishing and service industries, for example, have been seeking compensation for lost wages and jobs for three years."&lt;ref name="NYTTeague30jul2013"&gt;{{cite news |title=Shirking Responsibility in the Gulf |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/opinion/shirking-responsibility-in-the-gulf.html |author=Stephen Teague|date=31 July 2013|location=Biloxi, Miss|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, BP made a motion in court to freeze payments on tens of thousands of claims, arguing inter alia that a staff attorney from the Deepwater Horizon Court-Supervised Settlement Program, the program responsible for evaluating compensation claims, had improperly profited from claims filed by a New Orleans law firm. The attorney is said to have received portions of settlement claims for clients he referred to the firm.&lt;ref name="NYTTeague30jul2013"/&gt; The federal judge assigned to the case, Judge Barbier, refused to halt the settlement program, saying he had not seen evidence of widespread fraud, adding that he was "offended by what he saw as attempts to smear the lawyer administering the claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/19/bp-oil-spill-payments_n_3623940.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Jessica | last=Leader | title=Judge Rules Against BP Over Settlement Payout Request | date=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil litigation and settlements ===
{{Main|Deepwater Horizon litigation}}

{{See also|Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar}}

By 26 May 2010, over 130 lawsuits relating to the spill had been filed&lt;ref name="Timeslitigation"/&gt; against one or more of BP, Transocean, [[Cameron International Corporation]], and [[Halliburton|Halliburton Energy Services]],&lt;ref name="BP, Transocean Lawsuits Surge"/&gt; although it was considered likely by observers that these would be combined into one court as a [[multidistrict litigation]].&lt;ref name="BP, Transocean Lawsuits Surge" /&gt; On 21 April 2011, BP issued $40 billion worth of lawsuits against rig owner Transocean, cementer Halliburton and [[blowout preventer]] manufacturer Cameron. The oil firm alleged failed safety systems and irresponsible behaviour of contractors had led to the explosion, including claims that Halliburton failed to properly use modelling software to analyze safe drilling conditions.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-297"/&gt; The firms deny the allegations.

On 2 March 2012, BP and plaintiffs agreed to settle their lawsuits. The deal would settle roughly 100,000 claims filled by individuals and businesses affected by the spill.&lt;ref name="settleAP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt030312"/&gt; On 13 August, BP asked US District Judge [[Carl Barbier]] to approve the settlement, saying its actions "did not constitute [[gross negligence]] or willful misconduct".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; On 13 January 2013, Judge Barbier approved a medical-benefits portion of BP's proposed $7.8 billion partial settlement. People living for at least 60 days along oil-impacted shores or involved in the clean-up who can document one or more specific health conditions caused by the oil or dispersants are eligible for benefits, as are those injured during clean-up.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-298"/&gt; BP also agreed to spend $105 million over five years to set up a Gulf Coast health outreach program and pay for medical examinations.&lt;ref name=ap110113/&gt; According to a group presenting the plaintiffs, the deal has no specific cap.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-299"/&gt; BP says that it has $9.5 billion in assets set aside in a trust to pay the claims, and the settlement will not increase the $37.2 billion the company budgeted for spill-related expenses.&lt;ref name=settleAP /&gt; BP originally expected to spend $7.8 billion. By October 2013 it had increased its projection to $9.2 billion, saying it could be "significantly higher."&lt;ref name="2014 appeal fail"/&gt;

On 31 August 2012, the US [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) filed papers in federal court in New Orleans blaming BP for the Gulf oil spill, describing the spill as an example of "gross negligence and willful misconduct." In their statement the DOJ said that some of BP's arguments were "plainly misleading" and that the court should ignore BP's
argument that the Gulf region is "undergoing a robust recovery".  BP rejected the charges saying "BP believes it was not grossly negligent and looks forward to presenting evidence on this issue at trial in January."&lt;ref name=cnn050912/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-9-12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/05/deepwater-horizon-us-bp-oil-spill|title=Sorry – this page has been removed.|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DOJ also said Transocean, the owner and operator of the Deepwater Horizon rig, was guilty of gross negligence as well.&lt;ref name=cnn050912&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/05/news/companies/bp-oil-spill/index.html|title=DOJ accuses BP of 'gross negligence' in Gulf oil spill|date=5 September 2012|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stuartsmith&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuarthsmith.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/7229-2.pdf |title=UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA IN RE: OIL SPILL BY THE OIL RIG : MDL NO. 2179 “DEEPWATER HORIZON” IN THE GULF : OF MEXICO, ON APRIL 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 November 2012, BP and the US Department of Justice reached a settlement. BP will pay $4.5 billion in fines and other payments, the largest of its kind in US history. In addition, the U.S. government temporarily banned BP from new federal contracts over its "lack of business integrity".&lt;ref name=ct281112/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn281112/&gt;  The plea was accepted by Judge [[Sarah Vance]] of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana]] on 31 January 2013.&lt;ref name=upstream310113/&gt; The settlement includes payments of $2.394&amp;nbsp;billion to the [[National Fish and Wildlife Foundation]], $1.15&amp;nbsp;billion to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, $350&amp;nbsp;million to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] for oil spill prevention and response research, $100&amp;nbsp;million to the North America Wetland Conservation Fund, $6&amp;nbsp;million to General Treasury and $525&amp;nbsp;million to the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;ref name=nyt151112/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ramseur/&gt; Oil sector analysts at London-based investment bank Canaccord Genuity noted that a settlement along the lines disclosed would only be a partial resolution of the many claims against BP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/122140/BP_Will_Pay_45B_in_Plea_Deal_over_Macondo|title=BP Will Pay $4.5B in Plea Deal over Macondo|website=www.rigzone.com|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 January 2013, the US Justice Department announced "Transocean Deepwater Inc. has agreed to plead guilty to violating the [[Clean Water Act]] and to pay a total of $1.4&amp;nbsp;billion in civil and criminal fines and penalties".&lt;ref name="AutoBB-302"/&gt;  $800&amp;nbsp;million goes to Gulf Coast restoration Trust Fund, $300&amp;nbsp;million to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, $150&amp;nbsp;million to the [[National Wild Turkey Federation]] and $150&amp;nbsp;million to the National Academy of Sciences.

On 25 July 2013, Halliburton pleaded guilty to destruction of critical evidence after the oil spill and said it would pay the maximum allowable fine of $200,000 and will be subject to three years of probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Halliburton Pleads Guilty to Destroying Evidence After Gulf Spill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/business/halliburton-pleads-guilty-to-destroying-evidence-after-gulf-spill.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=27 September 2013|first=Clifford|last=Krauss|date=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July 2013, Alaska inventor and oil field veteran Chris McIntyre filed suit against BP, alleging that the company used his design to cap the Macondo Well without compensation. McIntyre sent BP the design for the capping device on 14 May 2010. BP subsequently used McIntyre's design (or one very similar) to shut in the well on 15 July 2010. BP maintains that its employees first conceived of the design some days before McIntyre. Both parties agree that the device did not exist prior to 20 April 2010. The case, Christopher McIntyre v. BP Exploration &amp; Production is currently on appeal with the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals|United States Court for the Ninth Circuit]] in San Francisco. McIntyre seeks [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]] to the District Court of Alaska for a [[jury trial]].

In January 2014, a panel of the [[U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]] rejected an effort by BP to curb payment of what it described as "fictitious" and "absurd" claims to a settlement fund for businesses and persons affected by the oil spill. BP said administration of the 2012 settlement was marred by the fact that people without actual damages could file a claim. The court ruled that BP hadn't explained "how this court or the district court should identify or even discern the existence of 'claimants that have suffered no cognizable injury.'"&lt;ref name="2014 appeal fail"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-appeals-court-affirms-bp-033211520.html | title=BP appeal to stop 'fictitious' U.S. oil spill claims fails | work=Yahoo Finance | date=11 January 2014 | agency=Reuters | accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court then went further, calling BP's position "nonsensical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Tom|title=Judges Call BP’s Arguments "Nonsensical"|url=http://neworleans.legalexaminer.com/toxic-substances/judges-call-bps-arguments-nonsensical/|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=The Legal Examiner|date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lahav|first1=Alexandra|title=The ideas that underly BP’s cert petition don’t make sense|url=http://neworleans.legalexaminer.com/toxic-substances/professor-lahav-the-ideas-that-underly-bps-cert-petition-dont-make-sense/|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=The Legal Examiner|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] later refused to hear BP's appeal after victims and claimants, along with numerous Gulf coast area chambers of commerce, objected to the oil major's efforts to renege on the Settlement Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Tom|title=BP’s Appeal Fails to Interest Supreme Court, Cert Denied|url=http://tampa.legalexaminer.com/toxic-substances/bps-appeal-fails-to-interest-supreme-court-cert-denied/|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=The Legal Examiner|date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Halliburton agreed to settle a large percentage of legal claims against it by paying $1.1 billion into a trust by way of three installments over two years.&lt;ref name="HalliburtonDeepwater"&gt;{{cite news|title=Halliburton to pay around $1.1 bn for US oil spill claims|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/02/us-halliburton-settlement-macondo-idUSKBN0GX1DT20140902|date=2 September 2014|accessdate=3 September 2014|publisher=''Reuters''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justice Department lawsuit===
BP and its partners in the oil well, Transocean and Halliburton, went on trial on 25 February 2013 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana in New Orleans to determine payouts and fines under the Clean Water Act and the Natural Resources Damage Assessment. The plaintiffs included the U.S. Justice Department, Gulf states and private individuals. Tens of billions of dollars in liability and fines were at stake. A finding of gross negligence would result in a four-fold increase in the fines BP would have to pay for violating the federal Clean Water Act, and leave the company liable for punitive damages for private claims.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Richard|title=BP to begin presenting its defense Monday in Gulf oil spill trial|url=http://www.nola.com/news/gulf-oil-spill/index.ssf/2013/04/bp_to_begin_presenting_its_def.html|accessdate=13 April 2013|newspaper=The Times-Picayune|date=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial's first phase was to determine the liability of BP, Transocean, Halliburton, and other companies, and if they acted with gross negligence and willful misconduct.&lt;ref name=upstream250213/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomberg260213/&gt; The second phase scheduled in September 2013 focused on the flow rate of the oil and the third phase scheduled in 2014 was to consider damages.&lt;ref name=upstream260213/&gt; According to the plaintiffs' lawyers the major cause of an explosion was the mishandling of a rig safety test, while inadequate training of the staff, poor maintenance of the equipment and substandard cement were also mentioned as things leading to the disaster.&lt;ref name=bloomberg260213/&gt;&lt;ref name=upstream260213/&gt; According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' the U.S. government and Gulf Coast states had prepared an offer to BP for a $16&amp;nbsp;billion settlement. However, it was not clear if this deal had been officially proposed to BP and if BP has accepted it.&lt;ref name=reuters230213/&gt;

On 4 September 2014, U.S. District Judge [[Carl Barbier]] ruled BP was guilty of gross negligence and willful misconduct. He described BP's actions as "reckless." He said Transocean's and Halliburton's actions were "negligent." He apportioned 67% of the blame for the spill to BP, 30% to Transocean, and 3% to Halliburton. Fines would be apportioned commensurate with the degree of negligence of the parties, measured against the number of barrels of oil spilled. Under the Clean Water Act fines can be based on a cost per barrel of up to $4,300, at the discretion of the judge. The number of barrels was in dispute at the conclusion of the trial with BP arguing 2.5 million barrels were spilled over the 87 days the spill lasted, while the court contends 4.2 million barrels were spilled. BP issued a statement strongly disagreeing with the finding, and saying the court's decision would be appealed.&lt;ref name="BPverdict"&gt;{{cite news|title=BP found "grossly negligent' in Gulf of Mexico oil spill|url=http://www.neworleanssun.com/index.php/sid/225407625|date=4 September 2014|accessdate=5 September 2014|publisher=''New Orleans Sun''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbier ruled that BP had acted with “conscious disregard of known risks" and rejected BP's assertion that other parties were equally responsible for the oil spill. His ruling stated that BP "employees took risks that led to the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history,” that the company was “reckless,” and determined that several crucial BP decisions were “primarily driven by a desire to save time and money, rather than ensuring that the well was secure.” The ruling means that BP, which had already spent more than $28 billion on cleanup costs and damage claims, may be liable for another $18 billion in damages, four times the Clean Water Act maximum penalties and many times more than the $3.5 billion BP had already allotted. BP strongly disagreed with the ruling and filed an immediate appeal. The size of the ruling "casts a cloud over BP’s future," ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported.&lt;ref name="Times - barbier - 18 billion"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Campbell|last2=Krauss|first2=Clifford|title=BP May Be Fined Up to $18 Billion for Spill in Gulf|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/business/bp-negligent-in-2010-oil-spill-us-judge-rules.html|accessdate=6 September 2014|work=The New York Times|date=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg-sept-5-14"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fisk|first1=Margaret Cronin|last2=Calkins|first2=Lauren Brubaker|last3=Feeley|first3=Jef|title='Worst Case' BP Ruling on Gulf Spill Means Billions More in Penalties|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-04/bp-found-grossly-negligent-in-2010-gulf-of-mexico-spill.html|accessdate=5 September 2014|agency=Bloomberg LLP|date=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal charges ===
{{Main|Deepwater Horizon litigation}}

In addition to the private lawsuits and civil governmental actions, the federal government charged multiple companies and five individuals with federal crimes.

In the November 2012 resolution of the federal charges against it, BP agreed to plead guilty to 11 felony counts related to the deaths of the 11 workers and paid a $4 billion fine.&lt;ref name=nyt151112/&gt; Transocean's plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge as part of its $1.4 billion fine.

In April 2012, the Justice Department filed the first criminal charge against Kurt Mix, a BP engineer, for obstructing justice by deleting messages showing that BP knew the flow rate was three times higher than initial claims by the company, and knew that "Top Kill" was unlikely to succeed, but claimed otherwise.&lt;ref name=huffington240412/&gt;&lt;ref name="ProPublica201204"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ201204/&gt; Three more BP employees were charged in November 2012. Site managers Donald Vidrine and Robert Kaluza were charged with manslaughter for acting negligently in their supervision of key safety tests performed on the rig prior to the explosion, and failure to alert onshore engineers of problems in the drilling operation.&lt;ref name=guardian151112/&gt; David Rainey, BP's former vice-president for exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, was charged with obstructing Congress by misrepresenting the rate that oil was flowing out of the well.&lt;ref name=bloomberg281112/&gt; Lastly, Anthony Badalamenti, a Halliburton manager, was charged with instructing two employees to delete data related to Halliburton's cementing job on the oil well.&lt;ref name="cbshalliburtonmanager"&gt;{{cite web|title=Halliburton manager gets 1 year probation in Gulf oil spill.|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/halliburton-manager-gets-1-year-probation-in-gulf-oil-spill/|website=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the charges against individuals resulted in any prison time, and no charges were levied against upper level executives.

The '''Donaldson Awards''' were a set of theatre awards established in 1944 by the drama critic [[Robert Francis (critic)|Robert Francis]]&lt;ref name=lisa/&gt; in honor of W. H. Donaldson (1864–1925), the founder of ''The Billboard'' (now ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'') magazine.

Categories included "best new play", "best new musical", "best performance", "best debut" and "best costumes and set design". The winners were chosen by votes of the theatre community at large with no predetermined nominees and the winners were presented with a gold key and a scroll.&lt;ref name=lisa&gt;Sagolla, Lisa Jo (2003). ''The Girl Who Fell Down{{spaced ndash}} A Biography of Joan McCracken''.  Boston:  [[University Press of New England]]. {{ISBN|978-1-555-53573-5}}. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', "The Donaldson Awards are the stages' accolades to their own."&lt;ref&gt;Francis, Robert (April 27, 1946).  [https://books.google.com/books?id=9BkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=%22Donaldson%20Awards%20%22&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Donaldson%20Awards%20%22&amp;f=false "Revivals in New Donaldson Awards"].  ''[[Billboard (magazine)|The Billboard]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards were discontinued in 1955 having been overshadowed by the Antoinette Perry Awards ([[Tony Awards]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bordman, Gerald Martin; Hischak, Thomas S. (2004).

The '''Emergency Architects Foundation''' is a [[France|French]] [[non-governmental organization]],
''[[:fr:Reconnaissance d'utilité publique|reconnue d'utilité publique]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081005125620/http://www.amif.asso.fr/article.php3?id_article=478]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is organised as a not-for-profit foundation with the French Order of Architects as supporters and is accredited by the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]].
The Emergency Architects Foundation is also present in Australia (Emergency Architects Australia) and in Canada (Emergency Architects Canada).
The aim of Emergency Architects is to bring help and technical aid to the victims of natural, technological and human [[disasters]], not only in safety and security evaluations of the populations but also in post-disaster reconstruction programs focused on long-term development and risk mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.innovationlejournal.com/spip.php?article1399]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Emergency Architects Foundation was created in April 2001 by Patrick Coulombel (architect) in [[Amiens]] in Picardy, France as a result of the flooding of the [[River Somme]] in 2001. A group of architects formed the organisation so as to mobilize technical assistance to the disaster victims and protect the rich cultural heritage of the region.

Emergency Architects Australia (EAA) was started in 2005 in response to the Indonesian tsunami and since that has worked in Indonesia, Pakistan, the Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Timor Leste, Papua New Guinea, Cook Islands, India and Australia. The president of EAA is [[Andrea Nield]]. EAA has over 300 members and is supported by the Union of International Architects, Australian Institute of Architects National, the Victorian and NSW RAIA Chapters, and The Council of the City of Sydney. Among the important collaborators are The European Union, UNHCR, UNICEF, NZAID, Australian Red Cross, World Vision, and Caritas.&lt;ref&gt;Emergency Architects Australia Annual Report 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Emergency Architects Canada was founded in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newser.com/archive-world-news/1G1-153502806/architects-without-borders.html]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The president is Bernard Mac Namara.

Emergency Architects has already led 28 actions in 24 countries, made more than 39,600 assessments and about 8,500 buildings.

At the moment, the foundation is undertaking 12 programs in the following countries: [[Afghanistan]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Indonesia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Pakistan]], [[Peru]], [[Sri Lanka]] [[Chad]], [[East Timor]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Architecture Bulletin, January/February 2009" Exhibitions, Global Studio and Emergency Architects"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims ==

The main objectives of the Emergency Architects Foundation are:
# to support and develop architects' humanitarian engagement in France and worldwide and thus to contribute to the development of architecture,
# to train architects with skills to help populations affected by natural, technological or human disasters,
# to encourage architects training in France and in the World
# to preserve and promote architectural, historical and cultural world heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Architectes de l'Urgence, un nouveau metier de l'humanitaire, Patrick Coulombel, ed: l'Harmettan, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functioning ==

The architects, engineers and planners have used their professional expertise (knowledge of risk prevention and of building) to provide appropriate and sustainable assistance to the populations affected by natural (tsunami, earthquake), technological (chemical factory explosion) or human (civil) disasters.
They always work with local populations and use local materials in their buildings.

The foundation employs 533 persons from 23 countries. Overall, more than 1,200 architects and engineers have been involved in Emergency Architects achievements in 21 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081005125620/http://www.amif.asso.fr/article.php3?id_article=478]&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Fields of operation ==

The foundation takes part in the following operations:

''' Emergency'''
* ''Cartographic Evaluation Missions'' and '' Field work evaluation'', in order to allow to the architects to quickly understand the disaster and its effects on the population, to estimate the extent of damage, to identify and define the human and logistical means for ensuring the immediate safety of populations and their quick rehousing.
* ''Facilitate ethical partnerships'' between Emergency Architects, local communities, local governments and aid organisations.
* ''Safety of the populations'' by the installation of safety perimeters around damaged construction which could present potential danger, survey public services and housing, organize strategies for stabilisation or evacuation of inhabitants in case of danger, and by identifying strategic methods to provide security of a population.
* ''Missions in [[Refugee camps]]'' to improve living conditions of refugee populations in these Refugee camps.

'''Rebuilding'''
* Help to rebuild sustainable and decent housing and restore basic economic and education infrastructure.
Re-house displaced populations.
* Risk prevention: Analyse relevant environmental, urban, technological and architectural factors with regards to rebuilding safely.
* Capacity building: Preserve traditional know-how while adding features to make them resistant to future disasters.
Promote the training of locals, from masons to architects.

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 2017''' was the 62nd edition of the annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It took place in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]], following [[Jamala]]'s win at the {{Escyr|2016||2016 contest}} in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] with the song "[[1944 (song)|1944]]". This was the second time the contest took place in Kiev, after {{Escyr|2005}}, as well as the fourth [[Eurovision (network)|Eurovision event]], after the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]] in {{Escyr|2009|Junior}} and {{Escyr|2013|Junior}}. The contest was held at the [[International Exhibition Centre]] and consisted of two semi-finals on 9 and 11 May, and the final on 13 May 2017. All three live shows were hosted by [[Oleksandr Skichko]], [[Volodymyr Ostapchuk]] and [[Timur Miroshnychenko]].

Forty-two countries participated in the contest. {{Esccnty|Portugal}} and {{Esccnty|Romania}} returned to the contest after a year's absence, while {{Esccnty|Bosnia and Herzegovina}} withdrew on financial grounds. {{Esccnty|Russia}} had originally planned to participate, but announced their withdrawal on 13 April 2017, after their representative, [[Julia Samoylova]], was banned from entering Ukraine by virtue of having travelled directly from [[Russia]] to [[Crimea]] in 2015, a region that was [[Crimean crisis|annexed by Russia]] in 2014, to give a performance, which is illegal under Ukrainian law.

The winner was [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017|Portugal]] with the song "[[Amar pelos dois]]" (Loving For Both of Us), performed by [[Salvador Sobral]] and written by his sister [[Luísa Sobral]]. This was Portugal's first win – and first top five placing – in 53 years of participation, the longest winless run by a country in Eurovision history. It was also the first winning song entirely performed in a country's native language since {{Esccnty|Serbia|y=2007}}'s "[[Molitva]]" in {{Escyr|2007}}, and the first winner written in [[triple metre]] since {{Esccnty|Ireland|y=1996}}'s "[[The Voice (Eimear Quinn song)|The Voice]]" in {{Escyr|1996}}. Additionally, this was the second consecutive year in which a returning country won the contest following Ukraine's victory in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]]. The top three countries – Portugal, {{Esccnty|Bulgaria|y=2017}} and {{Esccnty|Moldova|y=2017}} – achieved the highest placing in their Eurovision history, while host country Ukraine received its worst placing to date in a Eurovision final. Out of the "Big Five" countries, only Italy, the pre-contest favourite,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jiandani|first1=Sanjay|title=Eurovision Italy: Francesco Gabbani hot favorite to win Eurovision; 50 million views and counting! - ESCToday.com|url=http://esctoday.com/142464/italy-francesco-gabbani-hot-favorite-win-eurovision-50-million-views-counting/|website=ESCToday|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; finished in the top ten, coming sixth. The EBU reported that 182 million viewers worldwide watched the contest, 22 million fewer than the 2016 record.

{{doubleimage|right||200||thumb|Stage design of the contest.}}The preliminary dates for the contest were announced on 14 March 2016 at a meeting of Heads of Delegation in Stockholm, with the semi-finals expected to take place on 16 and 18 May and the final on 20 May 2017. These preliminary dates were chosen by the EBU to avoid the contest coinciding with any major television and sporting events scheduled to take place around that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brey|first1=Marco|title=Follow live: Heads of Delegation meet in Stockholm|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=follow_live_heads_of_delegation_meet_in_stockholm|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=15 March 2016|date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the EBU announced on 24 June that the preliminary dates for the contest had been brought forward a week, with the semi-finals scheduled for 9 and 11 May and the final on 13 May.&lt;ref name=hostcity_search/&gt; This was reportedly due to a request from UA:PBC, as the initial preliminary dates coincided with the Remembrance Day for the victims of the [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars]] on 18 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiwibloggs.com/2016/06/24/eurovision-2017-ukraine-broadcaster-proposes-new-dates/145614/|title=Eurovision 2017: Ukraine broadcaster NTU proposes new dates|first=Robyn|last=Gallagher|date=24 June 2016|publisher=wiwibloggs|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=prelim_uefa&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Eersel|first1=Dennis|title=Eurovision 2017: Preliminary dates moved because of Remembrance Day|url=http://www.escdaily.com/eurovision-2017-preliminary-dates-moved-remembrace-day/|website=escdaily.com|publisher=ESC Daily|accessdate=4 July 2016|date=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the current dates coincide with the second leg of the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] and [[2016–17 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]] semi-finals.&lt;ref name=prelim_uefa/&gt;

===Semi-final allocation draw===
The draw to determine the allocation of the participating countries into their respective semi-finals took place at Column Hall on 31 January 2017, hosted by [[Timur Miroshnychenko]] and Nika Konstantinova. The thirty-seven semi-finalists had been allocated into six pots, based on historical voting patterns as calculated by the contest's official televoting partner Digame. Drawing from different pots helps to reduce the chance of so-called "bloc voting" and increase suspense in the semi-finals.&lt;ref name="draw"&gt;{{cite web |last=Jordan |first=Paul |date=25 January 2017 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=251653 |title=Semi-Final Allocation draw to take place in Kyiv |publisher=eurovision.tv |accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual design ===
The theme for the contest, ''Celebrate Diversity'', was unveiled on 30 January. Executive Supervisor for the contest, [[Jon Ola Sand]], explained that "[t]he notion of celebrating diversity is at the heart of Eurovision values From EAMV Recording Label: it is all-inclusive and all about countries around Europe, and beyond, joining together to celebrate both our common ground and our unique differences, as well as some great music." The logo and visual design of the contest incorporates imagery of stylized [[bead]]s, with the main logo using the beads to form a [[History of jewellery in Ukraine|traditional]] neck amulet.&lt;ref name="pinknews-2017theme"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision will officially ‘celebrate diversity’ this year|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/02/06/eurovision-will-officially-celebrate-diversity-this-year/|website=Pink News|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slogan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=Paul|title=Ukraine is ready to Celebrate Diversity in 2017|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=ukraine_is_ready_to_celebrate_diversity_in_2017|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=30 January 2017|date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{Esc|Russia}} – Russia had originally planned to participate in the contest with the song "[[Flame Is Burning]]", performed by [[Julia Samoylova]].

*{{Esc|Slovakia}} – [[Radio and Television Slovakia]] (RTVS) explained on 12 April 2016 that Slovakia's absence from the contest since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]] was due to the ''"cost involved in participation"''.

[[Channel One Russia]] (C1R) announced on 12 March 2017 that they would participate at the contest with "[[Flame Is Burning]]", performed by [[Yulia Samoylova|Julia Samoylova]]. However, Samoylova was issued a three-year travel ban on entering Ukraine by the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] (SBU) on 22 March,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Service of Ukraine forbids entering Ukraine for three years to citizen of Russian Federation Yulia Samoilova|url=http://ssu.gov.ua/en/news/1/category/2/view/2997|website=Security Service of Ukraine official website|date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by virtue of illegally travelling directly from [[Russia]] to [[Crimea]], a region that was [[2014 Russian annexation of Crimea|annexed by Russia in 2014]], in 2015 to give a performance.&lt;ref name=DWJS13317&gt;[http://m.dw.com/en/ukraine-investigates-russias-newly-chosen-eurovision-candidate/a-37916396 Ukraine investigates Russia's newly chosen Eurovision candidate], [[Deutsche Welle]] (13 March 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39354775|title=Eurovision Samoilova: Ukraine bars Russian singer over Crimea visit|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entry to Crimea by non-Ukrainian citizens via Russia is illegal under Ukrainian law;&lt;ref name=DWJS13317/&gt; however, Samoylova confirmed that she performed in Crimea in 2015.&lt;ref name=GJS13317&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/13/russia-strikes-provocative-note-for-eurovision-in-ukraine Russia strikes provocative note for Eurovision in Ukraine], [[The Guardian]] (13 March 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dw-ukraineban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ukraine investigates Russia's newly chosen Eurovision candidate|url=http://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-investigates-russias-newly-chosen-eurovision-candidate/a-37916396|website=DW|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-ukraineban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ukraine bans Russia's Eurovision entrant over Crimea tour|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/22/ukraine-bans-russia-eurovision-entrant-over-crimea-tour|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EBU responded by stating its commitment to ensuring that all participating countries would be able to perform in Kiev, while expressing their disappointment at the lack of compromise from C1R and UA:PBC.&lt;ref name="bbc-ukrainerussiaban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision 2017: Ukraine bars Russian singer Samoilova from contest|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39354775|website=BBC News|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; C1R were offered the opportunity to allow Samoylova to perform via satellite from a venue of their choice,&lt;ref name="bbc-remoteperform"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision: Russia's entry Julia Samoilova 'could perform via satellite'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-39367029|website=BBC News|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but such a compromise was rejected by both C1R and the Ukrainian Government.&lt;ref name="sputnik-noch1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia's Channel One Rejects Eurovision Organizers' Video Broadcast Offer|url=https://sputniknews.com/russia/201703231051902764-russia-rejects-eurovision-broadcast-offer/|publisher=Sputnik International|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Первый канал отказался дистанционно транслировать выступление Самойловой на "Евровидении"|url=https://tjournal.ru/42335-pervii-kanal-otkazalsya-distancionno-translirovat-vistuplenie-samoilovoi-na-evrovidenii|publisher=TJournal|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director General of the EBU, Ingrid Deltenre, condemned Ukraine's actions, describing them as "abusing the Contest for political reasons" and "absolutely unacceptable"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EBU Chief Describes Ukraine’s Behaviour As "Absolutely Unacceptable"|url=https://www.escxtra.com/2017/03/29/ebu-chief-ukraine-behaviour-unacceptable/|publisher=escXtra|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; C1R announced their withdrawal from the contest on 13 April, stating that they also might not broadcast the contest.&lt;ref name="Russia Withdrawal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Первый канал не будет транслировать Евровидение-2017|url=http://www.1tv.ru/news/2017-04-13/323468-pervyy_kanal_ne_budet_translirovat_evrovidenie_2017|website=www.1tv.ru|publisher=[[Russia-1]]|accessdate=13 April 2017|language=Russia|date=13 April 2017|trans-title=The first channel will not broadcast ESC 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russia Withdrawal 2"/&gt; C1R had not organised accommodation before their artist announcement, as is typically the case, and refused to attend the meeting of Heads of Delegation. By announcing their artist just before the deadline for entry submission to the contest and not booking a hotel, it was speculated that C1R had not intended to go due to audiences booing Russian artists in previous contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trouw.nl/cultuur/wilde-rusland-wel-naar-het-songfestival-in-kiev-~a73339b0/|title=Wilde Rusland wel naar het songfestival in Kiev?|website=Trouw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Russian [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] celebrations on 9 May, Samoylova gave another performance in Crimea, including the song which was intended to represent Russia at the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-music-eurovision-russia-singer-idUSKBN18615V|title=Banned from Eurovision, Russian singer performs in Crimea|date=11 May 2017|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2017|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli broadcaster compromise===
Under a proposal by Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and Finance Minister [[Moshe Kahlon]], the [[Israeli Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA) was reorganised into two separate entities: the [[Israeli Broadcasting Corporation|Israel Public Broadcasting Corporation]] (IPBC), with responsibility for "general programming" such as entertainment, and another with responsibility for news and current affairs programming. The IPBC is also branded as ''"''KAN''"'' ({{lang-he|כאן|lit=Here}}). The EBU informed the IPBC executive board on 7 April that such a compromise would render them unable to remain a member without an outlet for news and current events programming. It has been reported that the IBA may cease to be a member of the EBU.&lt;ref name="IBA-compromise"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovoix.com/2017/04/07/israel-national-broadcaster-ebu/|title=Israel's national broadcaster no longer meets EBU requirements|date=7 April 2017|website=eurovoix.com|publisher=Euroviox|accessdate=8 April 2017|author=NPBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IBA was expected to close down on 15 May 2017 before the IPBC was expected to launch. However, on 9 and 10 May 2017 the IBA unexpectedly closed down most of their operations in news and current affair programs.&lt;ref name="IBA-Closure1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-shuts-down-public-broadcaster-iba-and-ends-mabat-lahadashot/ |title=Public broadcasters reduced to tears over sudden shutdown |last=Berger |first=Robert |date=10 May 2017 |publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Eurovision was the last program that [[Channel 1 (Israel)|Channel 1]] aired under the IBA, where minimal staff of twenty people remained to ensure a smooth transmission on Channel 1.&lt;ref name="IBA-Close"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IBA-Closure3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/life/television/.premium-1.788380 |title=Anger and Tears as Plug Pulled on Flagship News Show on Israeli Public Broadcaster|last=Stern  |first=Itay |date=10 May 2017 |publisher=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Eurovision the station displayed a slide about its closure. During the voting portion of the live telecast of the final Ofer Nachshon, Israeli voting spokesperson since 2009, bid farewell on behalf of the IBA before revealing their jury points.&lt;ref name="IBA-Closure4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/uk-media-erroneously-report-israel-leaving-eurovision/ |title=UK media falsely report Israel leaving Eurovision |author1=JTA |authorlink=www.timesofisrael.com/writers/jta/ |date=14 May 2017 |website=The Times of Israel |accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was incorrectly reported by several British media outlets and in other countries as Israel leaving the Contest.&lt;ref name="IBA-Closure4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3555930/israel-quits-eurovision-2017-live-on-air-after-44-years/|title=Israel quits Eurovision 2017 live on air after 44 years|date=13 May 2017|work=The Sun|accessdate=16 May 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IPBC applied for EBU membership later that year and was accepted, thus Israel continued to participate. They went on to win the contest the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/05/14/israel-may-return-at-the-2018-eurovision-song-contest-after-all-6636413/|title=Israel may return at the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest after all|date=14 May 2017|website=metro.co.uk|accessdate=14 May 2017|author=Benny Royston}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government passed a law splitting new corporation into two entities - one in charge for entertainment programs and the second is for news, which may create an obstacle for either entity joining EBU. However, the [[Supreme Court (Israel)|High Court of Justice]] issued a temporary injunction, blocking the split. If the split is cancelled permanently, the new [[Israeli Broadcasting Corporation|Israel Public Broadcasting Corporation]] meets all requirements for joining EBU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Magid|first1=Jacob|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/high-court-temporarily-puts-news-division-back-in-broadcasters-hands/|title=High Court temporarily puts news division back in broadcaster’s hands|publisher=timesofisrael.com|accessdate=16 May 2017|date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argument for using pre-recorded vocals live===
[[Norsk rikskringkasting]] (NRK) had discussions with the EBU regarding the abolition of the rule prohibiting pre-recorded vocals during live performances at the contest. Such a rule is intended to guarantee the authenticity of live performances.&lt;ref name=NRK-dispute&gt;{{cite web|title=JOWST from Norway: We're in it to win it|url=http://eurovisionworld.com/?esc=jowst-from-norway-were-in-it-to-win-it|website=eurovisionworld.com|publisher=Eurovisionworld|date=24 March 2017|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion stems from when Norwegian representative [[JOWST]] stated his displeasure at the rule in an interview on 24 March, in reference to the sampling technique of [[Chopping (sampling technique)|chopped vocals]] in his song "[[Grab the Moment]]" which cannot be attributed in the live performance.&lt;ref name=NRK-dispute /&gt;

Such discussions were also in place in {{Escyr|1999}}, when [[Backing track|pre-recorded vocals]] during the [[Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999|Croatian]] entry, "[[Marija Magdalena]]", performed by [[Doris Dragović]], led to objections by the Norwegian delegation — led at the time by [[Jon Ola Sand]]. Such objections led the EBU to consider deducting a third of Croatia's final score, reducing it from 118 points to 79. However, such a deduction never occurred.{{Citation needed|reason=The 1999 Wikipedia article discusses this topic with references, but no information can be found.|date=April 2017}} The possible abolition of the rule, alongside the abolition of the live orchestra in 1999, has led some fans and critics of the contest to argue that the contest has become too commercialised and the authenticity of live performances has been compromised.&lt;ref name=NRK-dispute /&gt;

After discussing the matter with the EBU, NRK were granted an exception to the rule. JOWST stated that "[the Norwegian delegation] have now been allowed to use the recorded vocal tracks, [...]. But [they] have also practiced a plan B with the backing vocalists, if there are big protests from others in Kiev."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/rampelys/musikk/melodi-grand-prix-eurovision/her-staar-jowst-paa-eurovision-scenen-for-foerste-gang/a/23987353/|title=Her står JOWST på Eurovision-scenen for første gang|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both JOWST and [[Aleksander Walmann]] think that had "Grab the Moment" been in the semi-final of the 2018 contest following an abolition of the rule, they would have had an advantage. NRK stated on 2 May that JOWST are aiming to perform the song acoustically as a back-up, bringing with them two additional backing vocalists who will perform the pre-recorded vocals live using a filter applied by the sound engineering team so as not to compromise on sound quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/kultur/slik-skal-jowst-vinne-eurovision-1.13497642|title=Slik skal JOWST vinne Eurovision|first=|last=NRK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norwegian jury replacement===
Norwegian jury member [[Per Sundnes]] made comments on NRK preview show ''Adresse Kiev'' on 17 April 2017 against [[Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017|Irish representative]] [[Brendan Murray]], saying: "It's been a long time since they've gotten up and I do not think they'll do it again. They try the same formula year after year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tv.nrk.no/serie/eurovision-song-contest/MUHU07008117/17-04-2017|title=NRK TV - Se Adresse Kiev|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comments were not welcomed by the Irish delegation, who subsequently reported the matter to the EBU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovoix.com/2017/05/08/norway-per-sundnes-removed-juror/|title=Norway: Per Sundnes Removed As Juror|first=Anthony Granger • 2 days|last=ago|date=8 May 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Irish Independent]] reported on 8 May that Sundnes had been replaced due to an alleged breach in jury rules. Commenting on the decision, the Head of Delegation for Ireland, Michael Kealy, said: "I'm glad that the European Broadcasting Union have reacted swiftly to this situation and that all jury members are impartial. It's only fair that each song in the Eurovision Song Contest is judged on its individual merits on the night." Sundnes was subsequently replaced by Erland Bakke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/music-news/eurovision-juror-replaced-due-to-breach-of-rules-following-comments-about-irelands-entry-35693101.html|title=Eurovision juror replaced 'due to breach of rules' following comments about Ireland's entry - Independent.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sundnes stated in an interview with [[Verdens Gang]] on 9 May: "I do not know anything about the jury stuff, just that I'm not [in it]. It was not really surprising. The same thing happened in [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016|Sweden]] last year with the Swedish professional jury."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/rampelys/tv/melodi-grand-prix-eurovision/per-sundnes-kastet-ut-av-fagjuryen-i-eurovision-song-contest/a/23993285/|title=Per Sundnes kastet ut av fagjuryen i Eurovision Song Contest|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NRK admits that they made a mistake by letting Sundnes sit in both the professional jury and the judging panel of ''Adresse Kiev''. However, when they were informed by the EBU that this was against the rules, they rectified the situation quickly. Project manager for [[Melodi Grand Prix]], Stig Karlsen, stated: "We have received some concerns from several teams that Per has been in the jury, while at the same time he has been meaningful in the program. Therefore, we took a new assessment.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/kultur/vg_-per-sundnes-kastet-ut-av-fagjuryen-i-eurovision-song-contest-1.13507924|title=Per Sundnes ut av Eurovision-jury etter irsk klage|first=|last=NRK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Estonian technical issues ===
On 11 May 2017, during the transmission of the second semi-final, the microphone of the Estonian representative seemed to have malfunctioned as singer [[Laura Põldvere]] could not be heard for approximately two seconds by viewers at home. It was later revealed that the Estonian delegation considered appealing to the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]] to allow [[Laura Põldvere|Laura]] and [[Koit Toome]] to perform their entry "[[Verona (song)|Verona]]" again as a result of the error, but later decided against it. Mart Normet, the Head of Delegation for Estonia, explained "If there has been such a powerful performance for three minutes and given an absolute maximum, then this energy again does not come back when you go on stage again". The EBU responded to the situation, reportedly describing the error as purely technical, as the microphone was supposed to automatically come on. Instead, a sound technician was forced to respond by manually switching on the microphone via the sound desk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Estonia: Delegation considered appealing to perform again|url=https://eurovoix.com/2017/05/12/estonia-delegation-considered-appealing-perform/|website=eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|date=12 May 2017|accessdate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country ultimately failed to reach the grand final, with Põldvere expressing her annoyance, however stating "I do not think it’s so tremendously influenced when a few words remain unheard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ernits|first1=Ruth|title=Eesti eurotiim selgitas tehnilise apsu tagamaid|url=http://menu.err.ee/595375/eesti-eurotiim-selgitas-tehnilise-apsu-tagamaid|website=eer.ee|publisher=Eesti Rahvusringhääling|date=12 May 2017|accessdate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Salvador Sobral's political message ===
[[File:Salvador and Luísa Sobral, May 2017.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Salvador Sobral]] and [[Luísa Sobral]] at the first semi-final winners' press conference]]
[[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017|Portugal]]'s representative, Salvador Sobral drew attention to the [[European migrant crisis]] by turning up to the first semi-final winners' press conference in an "S.O.S. Refugees" shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZO53kPHJus&amp;t=426s|title=Eurovision Song Contest 2017 - Winners' press conference - First Semi-Final|website=YouTube|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If I'm here and I have European exposure, the least thing I can do is a humanitarian message", Sobral said. "People come to Europe in plastic boats and are being asked to show their [[birth certificates]] in order to enter a country. These people are not immigrants, they're refugees running from death. Make no mistake. There is so much bureaucratic stuff happening in the [[refugee camps]] in Greece, [[Turkey]] and Italy and we should help create legal and safe pathways from these countries to their destiny countries", he added, earning a round of applause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/lifestyle/eurovision-contestants-share-emotions-qualifying-final.html|title=Eurovision contestants share emotions after qualifying for final - KyivPost|date=10 May 2017|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, EBU ordered a ban so that he could not wear it for the remainder of the contest.&lt;ref name=SOS&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herbet|first1=Emily|title=Portugal: EBU Ban Salvador Sobral from Wearing "S.O.S Refugees" Jumper|url=https://eurovoix.com/2017/05/13/portugal-ebu-salvador-sobral-refugees/|website=Eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|date=13 May 2017|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EBU explained that Sobral's jumper was used as a means of "political message," which violates the rules of the contest.&lt;ref name=SOS /&gt; However, Sobral argued in his winning press conference that it was not political, but a message of [[humanitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=ESC'17: The Winners Press Conference - Portugal Salvador Sobral|url=https://eurovoix.com/2017/05/14/esc17-winners-press-conference-portugal-salvador-sobral/|website=Eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|date=13 May 2017|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jamala stage invasion ===
A performance by Jamala during the voting interval of the final was disrupted by a man draped in an Australian flag who invaded the stage and briefly [[Mooning|mooned]] the audience before being removed by security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-05-13/eurovision-performance-gatecrashed-by-bum-flashing-stage-invader|title=Eurovision performance gatecrashed by bum-flashing stage invader|last1=Taylor|first1=Frances|date=13 May 2017|website=radiotimes.com|access-date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later identified as Ukrainian prankster [[Vitalii Sediuk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9news.com.au/entertainment/2017/05/14/08/02/australia-has-mooning-moment-at-eurovision|title=Eurovision streaker in Australian flag identified as Ukrainian prankster Vitalii Sediuk|date=14 May 2017|website=9news.com.au|publisher=[[Nine Network]]|access-date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the incident the EBU released a statement reading: "A person took to the stage at the beginning of Jamala's performance of I Believe in U at tonight's Eurovision Song Contest in Kyiv. He was quickly removed from the stage by security and out of the arena. He is currently being held and questioned by the police at the venue police office." The last time an unauthorised person gained access to the stage was in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010#Incidents|2010]] when the Spanish performance was disrupted by [[Jimmy Jump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://eurovoix.com/2017/05/14/esc17-streaker-identified-ukrainian-prankster/ |title=ESC’17 streaker identified as Ukrainian prankster |last=Granger |first=Anthony |date=4 May 2017|accessdate=4 May 2017 |publisher=Eurovoix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Salvador Sobral's victory speech ===

After getting his trophy, Salvador Sobral began a speech talking the quality of music and stated "We live in a world of disposable music – fast-food music without any content," and "I think this could be a victory for music that actually means something. Music is not fireworks. Music is feeling", prompting angry reactions from across Europe, including Swedish contestant, [[Robin Bengtsson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7793093/portugal-salvador-sobral-quietly-wins-eurovision-song-contest-2017|title=Portugal's Salvador Sobral Quietly Wins Eurovision Song Contest|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other awards ==
The Marcel Bezençon Awards, the OGAE voting poll and the Barbara Dex Awards are awards that will be contested by the entries competing at the Eurovision Song Contest 2017, in addition to the main winner's trophy.

=== Marcel Bezençon Awards ===
{{further|Marcel Bezençon Awards}}
The Marcel Bezençon Awards were first handed out during the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002]] in [[Tallinn, Estonia]], honouring the best competing songs in the final. Founded by [[Christer Björkman]] ([[Sweden]]'s representative in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1992]] and the current Head of Delegation for Sweden) and Richard Herrey (a member of the [[Herreys]] and the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1984]] winner from Sweden), the awards are named after the creator of the annual competition, [[Marcel Bezençon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marcel Bezençon Award – an introduction|url=http://poplight.zitiz.se/marcelbezenconaward/en|publisher=Poplight.se|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017033001/http://poplight.zitiz.se/marcelbezenconaward/en |archivedate=17 October 2013|accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards are divided into three categories: Press Award, Artistic Award, and Composer Award.

{{further|OGAE}}
Organisation Générale des Amateurs de l'Eurovision (more commonly known as OGAE) is an international organisation that was founded in 1984 in [[Savonlinna]], [[Finland]] by Jari-Pekka Koikkalainen.&lt;ref name="OGAE Clubs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision Fanclub Network|url=http://www.ogae.net/|website=ogae.net|publisher=OGAE|author=[[OGAE]]|date=15 June 2012|accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation consists of a network of over 40 Eurovision Song Contest fan clubs across Europe and beyond, and is a [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental]], [[Non-politics|non-political]], and [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] company.&lt;ref name=Members&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroviisuklubi.fi/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=41|title=Klubi-info: Mikä ihmeen OGAE?|publisher=OGAE Finland|accessdate=17 June 2012|date=5 June 2012|language=Finnish|trans-title=The club info: What on Earth is OGAE?}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what has become an annual tradition for the OGAE fan clubs, a voting poll will run prior to the main Eurovision Song Contest allowing members from over 40 clubs to vote for their favourite songs of the contest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38352">'''Evropesma''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: ''Европесма''; [[Serbia]]'s version of the name) or '''Europjesma''' (''Еуропјесма''; [[Montenegro]]'s version of the name) was a pop song contest in [[Serbia and Montenegro]] which ran from 2004 to 2006. The winning song represented the country in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It was organized by the Serbia and Montenegro union of broadcasters [[UJRT]] (consisting of [[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]] and [[RTCG]]).

In 2005 and 2006, [[Beovizija]] and [[Montevizija]] served as [[Serbia]]'s and [[Montenegro]]'s semi-finals for Evrop(j)esma (respectively). After the dissolution of the state union between Serbia and Montenegro, the semifinal contests took over the role of this festival.

==Voting process==
[[RTCG]] argued that fairly anonymous representatives from [[Montenegro]] have little chance against a number of big music stars that generally take part on behalf of [[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]], and who are usually famous in Montenegro itself. [[RTCG]] failed to engage any of the big [[Montenegro]] stars that could actually gain [[televote]]s to take part in [[Montevizija]]. Because of this, RTCG demanded that televoting should only be a part of the decision on who is going to win the competition. As a result, there are four judges appointed by RTCG, four by RTS and televoting was the ninth jury member. Points are allocated as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 or 12 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 in 2004).

==Winners==
*2004 [[Željko Joksimović]] (won 2nd place in the [[ESC 2004]])
*2005 [[No Name (Montenegrin band)|No Name]] (won 7th place in the [[ESC 2005]])
*2006 [[No Name (Montenegrin band)|No Name]] (disputed by [[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]], unverified by [[UJRT]])

==2004 event and controversy==
The first ''Evrop(j)esma'', held February 21, 2004, in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]], featured 24 performers, 19 from Serbia and only 5 from [[Montenegro]]. Four of the songs that represented RTS were selected in [[Beovizija 2004]], which was in part a semifinal for Evrop(j)esma. The representatives for RTCG were selected internally, and the others were selected by [[UJRT]]. [[Željko Joksimović]] won the 2004 Evropesma with "Lane moje", going on to reach second place in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]. The members of the Serbian jury didn't give a single point to the songs that represented [[Montenegro]] and member of Montenegrin jury didn't give points to winner and the runner up of Beovizija, which caused some controversy.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==2005 event and controversy==

''Europjesma 2005'' was held on March 4, 2005, in [[Podgorica]], [[Montenegro]]. Even before the contest started there were some controversies. RTCG said that RTS was favoring their entrants [[Ogi Radivojević]] and [[Jelena Tomašević]], runner up and winner, respectively, of [[Beovizija 2005]]. [[Željko Joksimović]], author of the song "Jutro" performed by Jelena Tomašević, even arranged a winning party for Jelena, before the show. RTCG judges voted by awarding few points to any of the Serbian performers, while giving the maximum points the band [[No Name (Montenegrin band)|No Name]] (who also won the [[televoting|televote]]).

Before allowing ''[[Zauvijek moja]]'' to be confirmed as [[Serbia and Montenegro]]'s entry, the [[EBU]] launched an investigation into a number of formal complaints, which also related to hotly disputed allegations of plagiarism. However, after prolonged deliberations, the song was given the green light.

There were rumors that the televote, which only lasted for 10 minutes, was free of charge in Montenegro and not in Serbia, but it was proven false.

==2006 event and controversy==
''2006 Evropesma'', held in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]], on March 11, 2006, saw the same voting pattern from the judges from both republics: this year's favorites, once again winners and the runner up of [[Beovizija 2006]], [[Flamingosi]] (Serbian-Montenegrin duo) feat.  [[Ljubiša Stojanović Louis|Louis]] and [[Ana Nikolić]], respectively, received no points from the RTCG judges. The judges appointed by RTS in turn awarded eight points to  [[No Name (Montenegrin band)|No Name]] and four points to [[Stevan Faddy]], enough for No Name to score another win. The Beovizija favorites Flamingosi finished second. The televote placed Beovizija favorites first and second and No Name third.

The stir began during the voting, as the audience started leaving the event in the midst of it, after realizing that their favourites were not going to win. The remaining audience booed No Name off the stage, and threw objects (such as bottles) at the stage, as they came out to accept the award and perform their song again, in the Eurovision Song Contest tradition. The audience then wooed Flamingosi on stage and they performed their song with the other finalists from Beovizija present on stage.

As a result, the Executive Board of [[UJRT]] did not accept the victory of No Name, stating that voting violated the merits of the competition, albeit not being found irregular. [http://www.rts.rs/euro/jedna_vest.asp?source=komentar&amp;IDNews=468 Source: UJRT statement]

The Director General of the RTS and the head of UJRT, [[Aleksandar Tijanić]], wrote a letter to his counterpart at the RTCG, [[Radovan Miljanić]], suggesting that a new contest be held, featuring five songs from both semi-finals that got the most points. The winner would be selected solely through [[televoting]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rts.rs/euro/jedna_vest.asp?source=komentar&amp;IDNews=469&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, RTCG requested from the [[European Broadcasting Union]] that they intervene in accepting the voting results from the controversial contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtcg.me/index.php?akcija%3Dvijesti%26id%3D16813 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722174714/http://www.rtcg.me/index.php?akcija=vijesti&amp;id=16813 |archivedate=July 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Broadcasting Union responded on March 18, 2006, two days before the deadline for the submission of the national entry to the [[2006 Eurovision Song Contest]], by suggesting that the broadcasters find a solution on their own.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/5804&lt;/ref&gt; This was to no avail, and finally, on March 20, 2006, Serbia and Montenegro officially withdrew from the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest. As the UJRT broadcast the semifinal and final, the viewers were able to vote, but only those in Serbia.

As the withdrawal left an empty slot in the final, [[Croatia]] and their representative [[Severina Vučković|Severina]] took it. The [[2005 Eurovision Song Contest]] [[Croatia]]n representative [[Boris Novković]] won 11th place, one place below the cutoff for the direct entry into the final.

'''''Freaknik: The Musical''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] [[television special]] produced by [[T-Pain]]. It features the voice of T-Pain as the Ghost of Freaknik, as well as the voices of entertainers such as [[Lil Wayne]], [[Young Cash]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Sophia Fresh]], and [[Rick Ross]], and [[comedian]]s such as [[Andy Samberg]] and [[Charlie Murphy]] who provide additional voices. It was scheduled to air on [[Cartoon Network]]'s late night programming block [[Adult Swim]] sometime in 2009, but after several push-backs, it premiered on March 7, 2010. The musical is based on the actual music festival [[Freaknik|of the same name]] that used to take place in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

A [[#Soundtrack|soundtrack]] was released by [[Jive Records|Jive]] and [[Nappy Boy Entertainment|Nappy Boy]] on April 20, 2010. The 50-minute uncut version of ''Freaknik: The Musical'' has been released on [[DVD]] and other forms of home media.

== Plot ==
The movie starts at a party that a group of young adults ([[Christopher "Kid" Reid]] and [[Affion Crockett]]) claims is the best [[House Party (film)|party]] they have ever attended. An elderly man ([[Lil Jon]]) joins the party and explains the history of [[Freaknik]]. He tells them that Freaknik threw the biggest party of all time, until it was broken up by the police in 1998; he claims the police "killed" Freaknik. Kid n' Play tried to convince that Freaknik is an urban legend like [[Candyman (film)|Candyman]], but as Play looks in the mirror, they were eaten by a swarm of wasps. The group is then led by the old man in [[summoning]] Freaknik, who appears as the Ghost of Freaknik Past ([[T-Pain]]).

The scene changes to a radio announcer named Mr. Thanksgiving ([[DJ Drama]]), who is interviewing Freaknik. Mr. Thanksgiving and Freaknik explain that a rapping contest will be held, the victory of which will get "a lifetime supply of [[money]], [[clothes]], and [[Prostitution|hoes]]". The scene changes once more to the bedroom of Virgil ([[Young Cash]]), Big Uzi ([[Rick Ross]]), and Light Skin ([[CeeLo Green]]), collectively known as the Sweet Tea Mobsters, a group of young adult rappers from Sweet Tea, Florida, who hope to achieve fame. The group decides to drive to Atlanta to participate in the aforementioned contest, along with their [[Cannabis (drug)|weed]]-smoking (and supplying) friend Doela Man ([[DJ Pooh]]).

During their journey, Light Skin tells of a secret society of African Americans called the [[Sigma Pi Phi|Boule]], fraternity parlance for "a council of noblemen", that seeks to guide the course of black culture. The members of this organization are parodies of [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Al Sharpton]] ([[Charlie Murphy]]), [[Bill Cosby]] ([[Kel Mitchell]]), [[Russell Simmons]] ([[Affion Crockett]]), [[O. J. Simpson]], and [[Jesse Jackson]].  They wear medallions inscribed "10%", an allusion to the [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] essay [[The Talented Tenth]], which says that a class of exceptional members of the black race will rise to lead it.

The Sweet Tea Mobsters make a number of pit stops, including a detour at a college fraternity party where they meet two alcoholic fraternity members ([[Bill Hader]] and [[Andy Samberg]]). While Virgil is fueling the gas tank, A car, inhabited by four sexy-looking women ([[Sophia Fresh]]) named Leacosia ([[Sophia Fresh|Crystal]]), Toprameneesha ([[Sophia Fresh|Skye]]), Obamaniqua ([[Sophia Fresh|Cole Rose]]), and Suzie ([[Sophia Fresh|Crystal]]), arrives. He tried to refuse, but the girls beg in song, besides Leacosia giving Virgil a kiss in the form of a gun. He accepts.

Meanwhile, Freaknik meets Rev. Sharpton, who tried to force him to work for the Boule. The plan fails as Freaknik says that he will "never, ever turn his back on his own people", so he escorts Sharpton out via trapdoor.

At the party, the group meets the Fruit Bowl Boys ([[Kel Mitchell]], [[Affion Crockett]], and [[Denzel Whitaker]]), who later become the group’s biggest competition and are from the mostly white suburbs of Sweet Tea, Florida (although they resemble the Sweet Tea Mobsters). On their long, winding road trip, the Sweet Tea Mob gets lost in New Orleans and are confronted by a gangster ([[Snoop Dogg]]) who makes them visit his boss, Trap Jesus ([[Lil Wayne]]). Upon meeting Trap Jesus, the group loses hope, thinking it is the end, but instead he inspires them to compete and gives them one of his many [[Lamborghini]]s to use to get to Atlanta. However, they crash the Lamborghini when Big Uzi becomes enraged after hearing the Fruit Bowl Boys talking about his jail experience. The group gives up except Virgil, who believes that winning the contest is their destiny. The rest of the group still doesn't believe him until they are given a ride in an airplane by the "Flying [[Malcolm X|Malcolms]]."

Meanwhile, the Freaknik character is elected the "ghost mayor of Atlanta" and dubs the city "Freaknation." Soon after, President [[Barack Obama]] hands the presidency over to the ghost of Freaknik, a move that greatly angers Oprah, which wants to see Freaknik destroyed. She devises a plan to send a giant robotic monster called the "Perminator" (a robotic version of Al Sharpton, rebuilt from Sharpton's corpse after he got hit by lightning while blowing out his hair) to Atlanta to destroy Freaknik. Meanwhile, at the party, the Fruit Bowl Boys begin singing "Shank Ya in the Shower." The Sweet Tea Mobsters arrive at Atlanta at the same time as the Perminator begins its attack; it kills the Fruit Bowl Boys almost immediately. He seems to have Freaknik down for the count, but mass love from the crowd empowers Freaknik as the Mob performs, giving him the ability to grow to a monstrous size. Using the love of his fans, Freaknik is able to destroy the Perminator.

After the fight, Freaknik declares the Sweet Tea Mobsters the winners of the contest, but Virgil refuses the prize and tears the check in half. He tells Freaknik that he doesn't need it as long as Freaknik comes back every year, but before he can finish speaking, a golden lion statue-shaped ship comes right in, inhabited by the members of the Boule. But as Freaknik is about to disqualify them, a dog-shaped spacecraft called the "[[Mothership Connection]]" arrives, killing the Boule and their ship (Note: This scene can only be seen on the uncut version of the special). It is inhabited by three brightly colored aliens who are actually [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], [[Bootsy Collins]], and Gene "King Poo Poo Man" Anderson. They say they have come to take Freaknik because "there are other galaxies that need his powers of positivity", saying that maybe someday he will return and they can "funk it up" once again. Freaknik gives Virgil his gold chain and says that Atlanta will always be his home. Suzie approaches Freaknik, telling him her baby (which looks like Freaknik) needs a father. Freaknik then rushes on board the ship with Clinton, Collins, and Anderson. Mr. Thanksgiving, the radio DJ from the beginning of the show, then speaks, saying how crazy that was and they'll see us next time; Freaknik is seen dancing on the Mothership as it leaves Earth. And after the end credits, we see Sweet Tea taping the check back together.

'''Hugh Falkus''' (15 May 1917 – 30 March 1996) was a British [[writer]], filmmaker and presenter, [[World War II]] [[aviator|pilot]] and [[angling|angler]]. In an extremely varied career, he is perhaps best known for his seminal books on [[angling]], particularly [[salmon]] and [[sea trout]] fishing; however, he was also a noted filmmaker and broadcaster for the [[BBC]].

==Biography==

Hugh Edward Lance Falkus was born to James Falkus, a [[Surrey]] bank manager, and his wife Alice Maud. James retired early to a boat, first on the [[Essex]] marshes and then in [[Devon]], upon which Hugh was sent to the [[Culford School|East Anglian School]], in [[Suffolk]]. According to his entry in the [[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Hugh caught his first fish when he was four, learned to shoot when he was six, and was an expert helmsman by the age of fifteen. By eighteen he had learned to fly, and at twenty he became a pilot in the [[RAF]].

On 11 July 1939 he married Doris Marjorie Walter, and they had two sets of twins (three sons and a daughter). The youngest son, Anthony, born in 1952, died in infancy. The older twins, Christopher and Malcolm, born in 1940, had successful careers, Christopher becoming a prominent publisher while Malcolm's career has been in economic history. Falkus' only daughter, Rowena Mary, is a Benedictine nun.

In June 1940 Falkus' [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] was shot down over [[France]]&lt;ref name=Indie&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burnett|first1=David|title=Hugh Falkus: Obituary|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/hugh-falkus-obituary-1302872.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=14 July 2015|date=2 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he spent the rest of the [[Second World War|war]] in German prison camps, including [[Stalag Luft III]] the [[Stalag Luft III escape|Great Escape]] camp. After the war he left Doris and in 1950 he married Diana Vaughan, the young editor of ''Argosy'' magazine, but on 12 May 1951 Diana was drowned, along with Charles Osborne, Bill Brendon and Sam Lee, in a boating accident off the coast of [[Achill Island]] in [[County Mayo]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], while they were making a film about the local shark hunting industry.  Filming near the Daisy Rocks, a huge wave estimated to be 27 feet high capsized and sank the lifeboat being used for the filming.  Falkus, a powerful swimmer, took command and ensure other members of the party including his wife were equipped with flotation devices; roping them together into a raft, and then set out for help. He collapsed unconscious having narrowly survived after swimming over a mile to the shore, before being able to tell his rescuers the location of the accident and its survivors.  As efforts were made to revive him, rescue parties went to the wrong location, Achill Head, based on guesswork. Falkus immediately upon recovering consciousness told the correct location but by then it was too late and the others had died from cold. His wife's remains and one other person's were recovered. [[Docunentary "Shark Island" by David Mullins RTE Documentaries September 2017]]

In 1952 Falkus married Lady Margaret Vane-Tempest-Stewart, second daughter of the [[Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 7th Marquess of Londonderry|7th Marquess of Londonderry]], but the marriage was short-lived. By 1955 Falkus had settled in [[Eskdale, Cumbria|Eskdale]], [[Cumberland]], which he had come to know and love through his friendship with Bill Fowler, a bomber pilot from Long Yocking, Eskdale, who he had met in a prisoner of war camp. In 1958 Falkus married Kathleen Armstrong, daughter of a local farming family. He lived with her at Cragg Cottage, Eskdale, for most of the rest of his life, writing about fishing and natural history and making television films on related subjects. He wrote, produced and presented a series of ''[[Natural World (TV series)|The World About Us]]'' films for the BBC, and with the Nobel Prize-winning zoologist Professor [[Nikolaas Tinbergen|Niko Tinbergen]] he made a film about gull behaviour called ''Signals for Survival'' which won the Italia prize in 1969,&lt;ref name=Indie/&gt; and first prize for the BBC at the 1969 [[Rose d'Or|Montreux Film Festival]]. He was reportedly and according to his biographer, Chris Newton, a sexual predator, gaining the punning nickname "Huge Phallus" at the BBC.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clover |first1=Charles |title=A fisherman's women |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3671836/A-fishermans-women.html |publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=14 July 2015 |date=15 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was still having affairs in his late sixties, upsetting his friends by deserting Kathleen, his wife of 25 years for a woman named Romille.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

Falkus' masterwork ''Sea Trout Fishing, A Practical Guide'' (HF &amp; G Witherby 1962, enlarged edition 1975) became a best-seller and has never been out of print; it "established his reputation as the father of modern sea-trout fishing" according to his biographer, Chris Newton. It was followed in 1984 by ''Salmon Fishing, a Practical Guide'', also a best-seller which remains in print.

Falkus was a controversial and outspoken figure, insisting on being right and bullying people.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

He was awarded the [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s [[Cherry Kearton Medal and Award]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="RGS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/5733E422-4831-4451-B7D8-052E80E8CD75/0/MedalWinners19702012.pdf |title=Medals and Awards |publisher=[[Royal Geographical Society]] |accessdate=28 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002055718/http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/5733E422-4831-4451-B7D8-052E80E8CD75/0/MedalWinners19702012.pdf |archivedate=2 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Hugh Falkus died of cancer and bronchopneumonia at Cragg Cottage on 30 March 1996. His son Christopher had predeceased him, dying in 1995 of heart disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2526">'''Ibn Fuladh''', also known as '''Ibn Puladh''', was a [[Daylamite]] military officer who is known for revolting against his [[Buyid]] overlords. He was the son of [[Fuladh ibn Manadhar]], a prominent Buyid officer who was son of Manadhar, an [[Justanid]] king.

Ibn Fuladh, in order to gain [[Qazvin]] as his fief, revolted against the Buyid ruler [[Majd al-Dawla]] in 1016. Majd al-Dawla, however, refused to make him governor of Qazvin, which made Ibn Fuladh threaten him around the countryside of his capital in [[Ray, Iran|Ray]].&lt;ref name="Bosworth"&gt;Bosworth (1997), pp. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Majd al-Dawla then requested the aid of his vassal, the [[Bavandid]] ruler [[Abu Ja'far Muhammad]], who managed to defeat Ibn Fuladh and repel him from Ray.&lt;ref name="Bosworth"/&gt; Ibn Fuladh then requested aid from the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Manuchihr]], who was a rival of the Buyids. Ibn Fuladh agreed to become Manuchihr's vassal in return for his aid. The following year, a combined army of Ibn Fuladh and Manuchihr besieged Ray, which forced Majd al-Dawla to make Fuladh the governor of [[Isfahan]].&lt;ref name="Bosworth"/&gt; However, the [[Kakuyid]] ruler [[Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar]], who was the original ruler of Isfahan, defeated Ibn Fuladh, and possibly killing him during the battle.&lt;ref name="Bosworth"/&gt;

He gained national attention during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]] when, during a videotaped campaign stop in [[Ohio]] by then [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee Senator [[Barack Obama]], Wurzelbacher asked Obama about his small business tax policy. Obama's response included the statement, "when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody." Obama's response was seized upon by [[conservative media]], and by Obama's rival, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee Senator [[John McCain]], as an indication that Obama was interested in the [[redistribution of wealth]] and had a [[socialism|socialist]] view of the economy.

==2008 presidential election==

===Encounter with Barack Obama===
On October 12, 2008, during a campaign break before the final presidential debate at Hofstra University, Obama visited a working class Toledo, Ohio neighborhood.&lt;ref name="In Working Class Ohio"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/10/in-working-clas.html | title = In Working-Class Ohio, Obama Meets Amorous Dogs, Skeptical Plumber | accessdate = October 20, 2008 | date = October 12, 2008 | authorlink = Jake Tapper | last = Tapper | first = Jake | publisher = ABC News | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081016044809/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/10/in-working-clas.html | archivedate = October 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wurzelbacher watched as the candidate engaged numerous residents in conversation.

Obama responded with an explanation of how his tax plan would affect a small business in this bracket. Obama said, "If you're a small business, which you would qualify, first of all, you would get a 50 percent tax credit so you'd get a cut in taxes for your health care costs. So you would actually get a tax cut on that part. If your revenue is above 250, then from 250 down, your taxes are going to stay the same. It is true that, say for 250 up&amp;nbsp;— from 250 to 300 or so, so for that additional amount, you'd go from 36 to 39 percent, which is what it was under [[Bill Clinton]]."&lt;ref name="ABC News video"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=6031110|title = ABC News video 'Joe the Plumber'|date = October 15, 2008|accessdate = October 20, 2008|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081019073936/http://abcnews.go.com/video/playerIndex?id=6031110|archivedate = October 19, 2008|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama also said, "It's not that I want to punish your success. I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance at success, too... My attitude is that if the economy's good for folks from the bottom up, it's gonna be good for everybody. If you've got a plumbing business, you're gonna be better off [...] if you've got a whole bunch of customers who can afford to hire you, and right now everybody's so pinched that business is bad for everybody and I think when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody."&lt;ref name="McCain, Obama get tough"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ha9qKZFKzFvH74G3c5PxRG_lHRIAD93RC8FG0 | title = McCain, Obama get tough, personal in final debate | last = Fouhy | first = Beth | date = October 15, 2008 |accessdate = October 17, 2008 |agency = Associated Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021004119/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ha9qKZFKzFvH74G3c5PxRG_lHRIAD93RC8FG0|archivedate=October 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spread the Wealth"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/10/spread-the-weal.html | title = 'Spread the Wealth'? | accessdate = October 29, 2008 | date = October 14, 2008 | authorlink = Jake Tapper | last = Tapper | first = Jake | work = "Political Punch" blog | publisher = ABCNews.com | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081026174223/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/10/spread-the-weal.html | archivedate = October 26, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wurzelbacher spoke to [[Katie Couric]] of ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' on October 15, shortly after the conclusion of the final debate. Asked whether Obama's proposed $250,000 tax threshold would affect him, Wurzelbacher replied: "Not right now at presently, but (...) he's going to do that now for people who make $250,000 a year. When's he going to decide that $100,000 is too much? (...) You're on a slippery slope here. You vote on somebody who decides that $250,000 and you're rich? And $100,000 and you're rich? (...)

Wurzelbacher held a press conference at his home on the morning of October 16, following the debates, where he refused to express support for either candidate. "I'm not telling anybody anything" about which candidate he prefers, he said, adding, "It's a private booth. I want the American people to vote for who they want to vote for."&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-campaign17-2008oct17,0,373757.story |title='Joe the Plumber' still a topic for McCain, Obama |accessdate=October 16, 2008 |date=October 16, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Seema |last=Mehta |author2=Michael Muskal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018012808/http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-campaign17-2008oct17,0,373757.story |archivedate=October 18, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, Wurzelbacher appeared on ''[[Your World with Neil Cavuto]]'' on [[Fox News]]. [[Neil Cavuto]] asked if Wurzelbacher was persuaded by Obama's plan. Wurzelbacher said that he was not and that he was more frightened upon hearing it. Wurzelbacher suggested that Obama's plan was socialist in nature.&lt;ref name = "Plumber From Ohio"/&gt;

That same day, Wurzelbacher also appeared on ''[[Good Morning America]]''. [[Diane Sawyer]] asked him if he was taking home $250,000 now, Wurzelbacher said with a laugh "No, not even close."&lt;ref name="ABC-vid"&gt;{{cite web

Wurzelbacher answered, "Oh no, no, no one's contacted me as far as if I was going to be on the debate or as far as my name being used. No. I have been contacted by them and asked to show up at a rally. But, other than that, no. I just happened to be here and Barack Obama happened to show up."&lt;ref name="ABC-vid"/&gt;

On November 2, Wurzelbacher appeared again on ''Your World with Neil Cavuto'', where he expressed concern that Barack Obama's tax plans would go down "a slippery slope" and eventually raise his taxes. Wurzelbacher also questioned Obama's patriotism saying "there's too many questions with Barack Obama, and his loyalty to our country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Joe_Plumber_questions_Obamas_loyalty_to_1102.html|title=Joe the Plumber questions Obama's loyalty to America|date=November 2, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106042640/http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Joe_Plumber_questions_Obamas_loyalty_to_1102.html|archivedate=November 6, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===References on the campaign trail===
On October 18, McCain told a campaign rally in [[Melbourne, Florida]] that he had phoned Wurzelbacher for the first time on October 17. McCain said, "He's a great guy, proud of his grandfather who served in the US Marine Corps. We're going to fight for Joe, my friends, we are going to fight for him. The question Joe asked about our economy is important, because Senator Obama's plan would raise taxes on small businesses that employ 16 million Americans.

The [[McCain-Palin]] campaign's senior strategist [[Steve Schmidt]] said that John McCain's strategy in the final weeks of the presidential campaign was based primarily on his differences with Obama on economic issues, which they would continue to highlight through the story of Joe the Plumber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Draper |first=Robert |title=The Making (and Remaking) of McCain |publisher=''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' |date=October 26, 2008 |accessdate=October 26, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/26/magazine/26mccain-t.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026045826/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/26/magazine/26mccain-t.html |archivedate=October 26, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nagourney"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/us/politics/17campaign.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title=Polls Cause Campaigns to Change Their Itineraries |last=Nagourney|first=Adam|author2=Jim Rutenberg|date=October 16, 2008|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the final presidential debate, McCain and his running mate [[Sarah Palin]] frequently repeated the charge in campaign speeches that "Joe the Plumber" would pay higher taxes under Obama and Biden's plan, although according to tax analysts neither Wurzelbacher nor the company he works for would actually be subject to higher taxes under Obama's tax plan.&lt;ref name="Real Deal"/&gt; Obama's "spread the wealth around" quote was later used by the McCain campaign, comparing the Democratic policies to [[socialism]].&lt;ref name="Drogin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-na-campaign19-2008oct19,0,6341003.story|title=John McCain compares Barack Obama's policies to socialism|last=Drogin|first=Bob|author2=Mark Z.

===Campaign===
{{wikinews|Super Tuesday 2012: 'Joe the Plumber' wins GOP congressional primary}}
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2012#District 9}}
On October 7, 2011, Wurzelbacher filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to challenge Democratic Representative [[Marcy Kaptur]] in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2012#District 9|2012 race for Ohio's 9th congressional seat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Joe the Plumber' files for a congressional run|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2011/10/3685288/joe-plumber-files-congressional-run|date=October 10, 2011|first=Reid|last=Pillifant|publisher=Capital New York|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011083231/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2011/10/3685288/joe-plumber-files-congressional-run|archivedate=October 11, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the March 6, 2012 primary, Wurzelbacher gained the nomination as the Republican candidate in the race, defeating challenger Steven Kraus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title='Ohio's 'Joe the Plumber' gets GOP nod for Congress' | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2012/03/06/national/a214104S55.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307153424/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2012%2F03%2F06%2Fnational%2Fa214104S55.DTL | archivedate=March 7, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He ran in the November 2012 general election against Kaptur, who had won the Democratic primary against [[Dennis Kucinich]] after the two incumbents' respective Congressional districts were collapsed into one as a result of post-[[United States 2010 Census|2010 Census]] [[redistricting]] by the state's Republican-controlled legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title='Dennis Kucinich concedes defeat to Marcy Kaptur in Ohio Democratic primary' | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57392078-503544/dennis-kucinich-concedes-defeat-to-marcy-kaptur-in-ohio-democratic-primary/ | work=CBS News | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308071527/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57392078-503544/dennis-kucinich-concedes-defeat-to-marcy-kaptur-in-ohio-democratic-primary/ | archivedate=March 8, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost the election, with Kaptur, who had been the heavy favorite, receiving over 70% of the vote.&lt;ref name="marcy kaptur coasts" /&gt;

==Controversies==

===Plumbing credentials===
Regarding his statement to Barack Obama about intending to buy the plumbing firm that employed him, Wurzelbacher later said that the idea of buying the company was discussed during his job interview six years prior.&lt;ref name="TBlicense"/&gt; Court records show that Wurzelbacher made $40,000 in 2006.&lt;ref name="Joe ... is Focus"/&gt;

As part of the background on McCain's use of "Joe the Plumber" during the 2008 campaign, several media outlets researched his professional plumbing credentials.  One ''[[Toledo Blade]]'' article stated: "Mr. Wurzelbacher said he works under Al Newell's license, but according to Ohio building regulations, he must maintain his own license to do plumbing work. He is also not registered to operate as a plumber in Ohio, which means he's not a plumber." "Mr. Joseph [business manager of the local union] said Mr. Wurzelbacher could only legally work in the townships, but not in any municipality in Lucas County or elsewhere in the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Wurzelbacher was not a member of the [[United Association|United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters]] (the national plumbers' union) and never served an [[apprenticeship]].&lt;ref name="Spotlight"/&gt;

===Tax controversy===
[[ABC News]] reported on October 16, 2008, that there was a judgment [[lien]] against Wurzelbacher for non-payment of $1,182 in owed Ohio state income taxes dating to January 2007, but "no action has been taken against him outside of filing the lien." Barb Losie, deputy clerk of the [[Lucas County, Ohio|Lucas County]] Court of Common Pleas, said that "there is a 99 percent chance [Wurzelbacher] doesn't know about the lien, unless he did a credit report or was ready to pay his taxes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Vote2008/story?id=6047360&amp;page=1 |title=America's Overnight Sensation Joe the Plumber Owes $1,200 in Taxes |accessdate=October 25, 2008 |last=Ibanga |first=Imaeyan |author2=Goldman, Russell |date=October 16, 2008 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023053035/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Vote2008/story?id=6047360&amp;page=1 |archivedate=October 23, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While on ''[[Hannity &amp; Colmes]]'', Wurzelbacher stated that he was unaware of the tax lien prior to it being reported in the press.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hannity &amp; Colmes]].

===Database search controversy===
{{Main|Controversial Ohio database searches of Joe Wurzelbacher}}
Prior to the 2008 election, Vanessa Niekamp, an employee of Ohio's Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS), at the behest of its director, [[Helen Jones-Kelley]], used state computers to search for information on Joe Wurzelbacher. On November 20, 2008, Niekamp reported the violation to the State Inspector General.

In June 2012, Wurzelbacher's election campaign released a video in which he claimed that the implementation of [[Gun Control|gun control]] resulted in Europe's Jews being unable to defend themselves during the [[Holocaust]], explaining that "In 1939, Germany established gun control. From 1939 to 1945, six million Jews and seven million others unable to defend themselves were exterminated." In the same video, Wurzelbacher stated that the implementation of gun control by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1911 resulted in Armenians being unable to defend themselves against the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/06/19/3098531/jewish-democragts-slam-joe-the-plumber-for-holocaust-remarks Jewish Dems slam candidate ‘Joe the Plumber’ for Holocaust remarks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623075454/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/06/19/3098531/jewish-democragts-slam-joe-the-plumber-for-holocaust-remarks |date=June 23, 2012 }}, Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), June 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CBSJoe&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57456545-503544/joe-the-plumber-links-gun-control-to-holocaust/ "Joe the Plumber" links gun control to Holocaust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620014311/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57456545-503544/joe-the-plumber-links-gun-control-to-holocaust/ |date=June 20, 2012 }} by Brian Montopoli, CBS News, June 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Luke |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/19/joe-the-plumber-gun-control-holocaust_n_1609652.html |title='Joe The Plumber' Claims Gun Control Caused The Holocaust |work=Huffington Post |date=June 19, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824180404/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/19/joe-the-plumber-gun-control-holocaust_n_1609652.html |archivedate=August 24, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/video/campaign/233575-joe-the-plumber-campaign-video-blames-holocaust-on-gun-control 'Joe the Plumber' campaign video blames Holocaust on gun control] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625020204/http://thehill.com/video/campaign/233575-joe-the-plumber-campaign-video-blames-holocaust-on-gun-control |date=June 25, 2012 }} by Cameron Joseph, ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', June 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cleveland.cbslocal.com"&gt;[http://cleveland.cbslocal.com/2012/06/20/joe-the-plumber-links-holocaust-with-gun-control/ ‘Joe The Plumber’ Links Holocaust With Gun Control] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621055211/http://cleveland.cbslocal.com/2012/06/20/joe-the-plumber-links-holocaust-with-gun-control/ |date=June 21, 2012 }}, CBS Cleveland, June 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

If people are looking to be offended by this video, they are probably serving a political agenda. Unfortunately there are a lot of whiners out there." Wurzelbacher's spokesman, Phil Christofanelli, also defended the video, stating that Wurzelbacher was a "student of history" who knows that the Founding Fathers "understood that the 2nd Amendment was always the people's last defense against tyrannical government."&lt;ref name=CBSJoe/&gt;

===Illegal immigration remark===
In August 2012, Wurzelbacher drew criticism for a comment he made about illegal immigration. During a campaign rally for Arizona State Senator [[Lori Klein (politician)|Lori Klein]], Wurzelbacher said, "For years I've said, you know, put a damn fence on the border, going to Mexico and start shooting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/08/14/joe-the-plumber-calls-to-start-shooting-immigrants-at-the-border/ |title=Joe the Plumber calls to 'start shooting' immigrants at the border |publisher=The Raw Story |date=August 14, 2012 |accessdate=February 18, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606173447/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/08/14/joe-the-plumber-calls-to-start-shooting-immigrants-at-the-border/ |archivedate=June 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about the comment later, he said that he didn't care about being "politically incorrect." Klein defended Wurzelbacher, telling reporters his comments were just a joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bingham |first=Amy |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/13/joe-the-plumber_n_1773590.html |title=Joe The Plumber: 'Put A Damn Fence On The Border Going To Mexico And Start Shooting' |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=August 13, 2012 |accessdate=February 18, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905090656/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/13/joe-the-plumber_n_1773590.html |archivedate=September 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bingham |first=Amy |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/joe-the-plumber-unfiltered-build-a-damn-fence-and-start-shooting/ |title=Joe the Plumber Unfiltered: Build a 'Damn Fence' and 'Start Shooting' |publisher=Abc News |date=August 14, 2012 |accessdate=February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Published reaction to Santa Barbara, California, mass shooting===
In an open letter to the parents of victims who died in the [[2014 Isla Vista killings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=An Open Letter: To the parents of the victims murdered by Elliot Rodger | last=Wurzelbacher | first=Joe | date=27 May 2014 | publisher=BarbWire: "Politics and Culture / News and Opinion From a Decidedly Biblical Worldview" | url=http://barbwire.com/2014/05/27/open-letter-parents-victims-murdered-elliot-rodger/ | accessdate=27 May 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528073405/http://barbwire.com/2014/05/27/open-letter-parents-victims-murdered-elliot-rodger/ | archivedate=May 28, 2014 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wurzelbacher wrote of his right to "protect my family"

'''Legal observers''' are individuals, usually representatives of civilian [[human rights]] agencies, who attend [[Demonstration (people)|public demonstrations]], [[protest]]s and other activities where there is a potential for conflict between the public or activists and the [[police]], [[security guard]]s, or other law enforcement personnel. The purpose of legal observers is to monitor, record, and report on any unlawful or improper behaviour. Legal or human rights observers act as an independent third party within a conflictual civil protest context, observing police behaviour in order to keep police accountable for their actions. Legal observers can write [[incident report]]s describing police violence and misbehaviour and compile reports after the event. The use of video and still cameras, incident reports and audio recorders is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.activistrights.org.au/cb_pages/organising_legal_support.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004022928/http://www.activistrights.org.au/cb_pages/organising_legal_support.php |archivedate=2009-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that the concept of using legal observers first emerged during protests in the 1930s in the [[East End of London]], where police [[agents provocateur]] were used during protests by the [[British Union of Fascists]] (BUF).{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} There were large counter-protests and it was alleged that the police sided with the BUF. Another case of legal observing was that carried out by the [[Black Panthers]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Legal observers were used by [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] (then known as the National Council for Civil Liberties) in [[Wapping]], [[London]], during the mid-1980s. The Wapping demonstration was in response to large protests by labour unions against the industrial relations policies of media magnate [[Rupert Murdoch]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In the United States, the [[National Lawyers Guild]] (NLG) holds registered trademarks for the words "legal observer"&lt;ref&gt;https://trademarks.justia.com/778/13/legal-observer-77813382.html&lt;/ref&gt; alone, as well as the words "legal observer" on a green background. The National Lawyers Guild Legal Observer certification program was established in 1968 in New York City in response to protests at Columbia University and citywide antiwar and civil rights demonstrations. That same year, guild students organized for the defense of people swept up in mass arrests at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The NLG Legal Observer certification program requires legal observers to take a training course and is part of a comprehensive system of legal support designed to enable people to express their political views as fully as possible without unconstitutional disruption or interference by the police and with the fewest possible consequences from the criminal justice system. Legal observers are trained and directed by National Lawyer Guild attorneys. The presence of legal observers may serve as a deterrent to unconstitutional behavior by law enforcement during a demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nlg.org/lo-trainings/&lt;/ref&gt; 

NLG worked with the [[Bureau des Avocats Internationaux]], the [[Institute for Justice &amp; Democracy in Haiti]], and the [[International Association of Democratic Lawyers]] to debut legal observers in Haiti during [[May Day]] protests of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlg.org/haitian-legal-organization-debuts-countrys-first-legal-observers-at-may-day-protests/ Haitian Legal Organization &amp; NLG Debut Country’s First Legal Observers at May Day Protests]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, legal observers are associated with such groups as [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]] (UK), [[Green and Black Cross]] (UK), the [[G8 Legal Collective]] (Scotland), and others. In Australia in the 1970s, priests acted as legal observers during the large [[Moratorium Marches]] against the Vietnam War. In September 2000, Pt'chang Nonviolent Community Safety Group organised a large legal observer team for the [[S11 (protest)|S11 protest]] against the World Economic Forum in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ptchang/downloads/s11_legal_observer_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In Sydney, the Legal Observers Project, formally based at the Community Law Centre at the [[University of Technology]], Sydney, and renamed Human Rights Monitors, was established in April 2001. This group reformed as Sydney Copwatch in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ptchang/downloads/s11_legal_observer_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights organizations such as [[Amnesty International]] sometimes dispatch human rights observers who serve similar roles to legal observers.

This is a list of all [[tropical cyclones]] that have existed between [[3rd parallel north|3°N]] and [[3rd parallel south|3°S]] of the [[equator]]. Tropical cyclones are relatively rare in this region, particularly outside of the [[Tropical cyclone basins#Northwestern Pacific Ocean|Northwestern Pacific Ocean]]. This is primarily due to a weak [[Coriolis effect]] within the region, and only seventeen known storms have formed since records began.

&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE the first paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Louisiana Purchase Historic State Park]]. --&gt;The '''Louisiana Purchase Historic State Park''' commemorates the initial point from which the lands acquired through the [[Louisiana Purchase]] (1803) were subsequently surveyed. The [[protected area]] encompasses {{convert|37.5|acre|ha}} of forested [[wetlands]], a landform which is regionally in decline due to agricultural development practices that include draining such areas. In the center of the park is a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} marker erected in 1926 on the survey point by the L'Anguille Chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]]. The site was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (1972) and designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] (1993).&lt;ref name=nris&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE the first paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Louisiana Purchase State Park]]. --&gt;

==Description==
&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE this paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Louisiana Purchase Historic State Park]]. --&gt;The historic state park is located at the eastern end of [[Arkansas Highway 362]], southeast of [[Blackton, Arkansas]], at the [[tripoint]] junction of [[Lee County, Arkansas|Lee]], [[Monroe County, Arkansas|Monroe]], and [[Phillips County, Arkansas|Phillips]] counties. It is a {{convert|37.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} parcel of [[swamp]], or forested wetlands, which is remarkably unchanged from the time when surveyors came here in 1815.  This type of wetlands is becoming increasingly rare because of the practice of draining and clearing such land for agricultural use.  The boardwalk, {{convert|950|ft|m}} long, leads to the site of the marker, with occasional interpretive signs describing the ecology of the area and the significance of the [[national historic landmark]].&lt;ref name="nhlnom"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Historic Landmark Nomination: Louisiana Purchase Survey Marker / Louisiana Purchase Initial Point Site|url={{NHLS url|id=72000206}} |format=pdf|author=William D. Baker|date=September 16, 1991|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE this paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Louisiana Purchase Historic State Park]]. --&gt;

&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE this paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Louisiana Purchase Historic State Park]]. --&gt;The Louisiana Purchase Survey Marker is {{convert|6|ft|m}} in height and is about {{convert|4.5|ft|m}} wide at the base. It typically stands in about {{convert|1|ft|m}} of swamp water. The inscription reads: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"This stone marks the base established November 10, 1815, from which the lands of the Louisiana Purchase were surveyed by [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|United States engineers]]. The first survey from this point was made to satisfy the claims of the soldiers of the [[War of 1812]] with land bounties"''.&lt;ref name="nhlnom"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE this paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Louisiana Purchase Historic State Park]]. --&gt;

==History==
On April 30, 1803, negotiators for the United States and the [[First French Empire]], signed the Louisiana Purchase agreement, by which the United States acquired {{convert|830000|sqmi|sqkm}} of land west of the [[Mississippi River]], doubling its size. President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], which traveled west along the Missouri and associated rivers, eventually reaching the Pacific Coast, from 1804 to 1806.

President [[James Monroe]] ordered a survey of the territory in 1815, in order to permit the orderly award of land in the territory to military veterans of the War of 1812. [[Prospect K. Robbins]] and [[Joseph C. Brown]] were commissioned to identify a starting point for the survey work in what is now eastern Arkansas. The team led by Robbins traveled north from the mouth of the [[Arkansas River]], while that of Brown traveled west from the mouth of the [[St. Francis River]]. On October 27, 1815, Robbins' party crossed the east-west line laid down by Brown's party at this point, formally establishing the [[Fifth Principal Meridian]]. The {{convert|55|mi|km}} of land Robbins traversed is even today some of the most difficult terrain in the state to negotiate. Brown's party traversed {{convert|26|mi|km}} of land alternately described as "good for farming" and containing "briers and thickets in abundance". Brown's party eventually surveyed as far west as present-day [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], while Robbins continued north to the [[Missouri River]]. Two trees near the site were blazed to mark the meeting point of the two survey lines.&lt;ref name="nhlnom"/&gt;

Although survey work based on this point continued in subsequent years, covering most of Arkansas, [[Missouri]], [[Minnesota]], [[Iowa]], and [[North Dakota|North]] and [[South Dakota]], the initial point was forgotten. It was rediscovered in 1921 by surveyors working the line between Phillips and Lee counties, who found the blazed trees. The [[Marianna, Arkansas]] chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution began a campaign to memorialize the spot, culminating in the placement of the stone marker and a dedication ceremony on October 27, 1926, the 111th anniversary of the point's establishment.&lt;ref name="nhlnom"/&gt;

One forgotten feature of the dedication ceremony was that four local landowners each gave deeds for {{convert|2|acre|ha}} of land surrounding the point, which would have created an eight-acre park.  Arkansas designated the area as a state park in 1961, but appropriated no funds for land purchases or development.  The Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission, recognizing the swamp's natural significance, provided funds to purchase the 37.5 acres which now make up the park. The Commission holds a conservation easement on the property to limit development.&lt;ref name="nhlnom"/&gt;

'''[[Melodifestivalen]] 1985''' was the selection for the 25th song to represent [[Sweden]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It was the 24th time that this system of picking a song had been used. 90 songs were submitted to [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] for the competition. The final was broadcast on [[SVT1|TV1]] but was not broadcast on radio. The presenter, Eva Andersson, was the 1980 [[Miss Sweden]]. No [[orchestra]] was used, as all songs were performed to backing track. There have been claims that this was because SVT could not afford to hire the orchestra for two shows, as they were hosting the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|Eurovision Song Contest]] in 1985.

Seventeen-year-old [[Pernilla Wahlgren]], singing "[[Piccadilly Circus (song)|Piccadilly Circus]]", was the favourite to win. However, she finished 4th and the following day [[Lasse Anrell]] from Swedish newspaper ''[[Expressen]]'' was "angry". 85% of the ''Expressen'' readers who phoned afterwards said that "the wrong song" won.

[[Kikki Danielsson]] won with the song "[[Bra vibrationer (song)|Bra vibrationer]]", which throughout the years has become something of a [[signature song]]. This was the fourth victory in a row for [[Bert Karlsson]]'s label [[Mariann Grammofon AB]]. Five of the songs were, alone or not, written by [[Ingela Forsman|Ingela 'Pling' Forsman]] and [[Monica Forsberg]].

'''The Minnesota Renaissance Festival''' is a [[Renaissance fair]], an interactive outdoor event which focuses on recreating the look and feel of a fictional 16th Century "England-like" fantasy kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ward|first=Bill| url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/130587713.html | title=Don't look to Ren Fest for history lesson | work=Star Tribune | date=September 27, 2011 | accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates during weekends from mid-August until the final week in September on a site near the [[Minnesota River]] in [[Shakopee, Minnesota|Shakopee]], a suburb of the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ward|first=Bill| url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/128827278.html | title=Fantasy meets reality at Renaissance Festival | work= Star Tribune| date=August 31, 2011 | accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minnesota Renaissance Festival began in September 1971 on a {{convert|22|acre|m2|sing=on}} field in [[Jonathan, Minnesota]]. More than 25,000 people visited the two weekend grand opening of the festival then named “A Celebration of Nature, Art, and Life!” It was later moved to its current site in Shakopee where it continues as one of the oldest and largest Renaissance fairs in the United States. It has played host to the early careers of such national acts as the magicians [[Penn &amp; Teller]] and [[The Flying Karamazov Brothers]] juggling troupe, and it currently hosts acts such as Zilch the Torysteller, [[Twig the Fairy]], Puke and Snot, Johnny Phoenix, The Tortuga Twins, The Danger Committee and Vilification Tennis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.renaissancefest.com/entertainment.html&lt;/ref&gt; On August 19, 1975, [[Penn &amp; Teller]] did their first show together at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|author=Jillette, Penn |author-link=Penn Jillette |user=pennjillette |number=104745893533716480 |date=August 19, 1975 |title=36 years ago today,Teller and I did our first show together at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival...}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jason Mraz]] also worked as a pickle boy early in his performance career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bream|first1=Jon|title=Mystic Lake lets Mr. Sunshine in|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/music/124798254.html|work=Star Tribune|date=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival features over 700 entertainers, 275 crafters, and 120 food booths.

The Minnesota Renaissance Festival is one of several such events in the [[United States]] owned and operated by Mid-America Festivals.

Because the land on which the festival was built is leased, in 2014 Mid-America Festivals announced that 2016 would likely be the last season in its current location.  The lease contained a clause in which the owners could terminate the lease at any time.  In 2016 Mid America Festivals announced the lease term would expire in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.renaissancefest.com/Assets/New%20Graphics%202016/Renaissance%20Lease%20Extended%20to%202019.pdf|title=Press Release: MN Renaissance Festival|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Minnesota Reanaissance Festival|access-date=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, several sites are under consideration, including properties in other parts of Scott County and near Belle Plaine, Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://belleplaineherald.com/Content/News/Local/Article/Renaissance-Festival-Eyeing-Possible-New-Home-Near-B-P-/7/39/5848|title=Renaissance Festival Eyeing Possible New Home Near B.P.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Travel to the Festival ==

The Minnesota Renaissance Festival provides free parking at its site in Shakopee and directions from its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.renaissancefest.com/contact.html |title=Park and Directions - Minnesota Renaissance Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parking is available in two parking lots accessible by a single dirt road crossing active train tracks onto its 400 acre campus&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/blog/real_estate/2016/06/renaissance-festival-signs-lease-through-2019.html |title=Minnesota Renaissance Festival Signs New Lease}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Limited access to and from the festival site has led to significant transportation issues including delays as long as two hours either entering or leaving the fairgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.citypages.com/arts/dos-and-donts-of-the-minnesota-renaissance-festival-6579357 |title=Dos and Don'ts of the Minnesota Renaissance Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traffic problems have created significant backups and delays along Minnesota Highway 169&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.belleplaineherald.com/Content/News/Area-News/Article/Mid-America-Festivals-Buys-Land-for-Possible-Renaissance-Fest-Site/7/40/8536 |title=Mid-America Festivals Buys Land for Possible Renaissance Fest.

In the 1980s, the [[Minnesota Transportation Museum]] provided train trips to the Renaissance Festival using [[Northern Pacific 328]]. These trains used [[Chicago &amp; North Western Railway]] tracks between Minneapolis and Merriam Junction, which is located next to the Renaissance Festival grounds. The rail line was severed between Hopkins and Chaska in 1991.

The '''National Theatre''' in [[Oslo]] ('''{{lang-no|Nationaltheatret}}''') is one of [[Norway]]'s largest and most prominent venues for performance of dramatic arts.

The theatre had its first performance on 1 September 1899 but can trace its origins to [[Christiania Theatre]], which was founded in 1829. There were three official opening performances, on subsequent days in September: first, selected pieces by [[Ludvig Holberg]], then ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' by [[Henrik Ibsen]], and on the third day ''[[Sigurd I of Norway|Sigurd Jorsalfar]]'' by [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]].

==History==
The National Theatre was founded as a private institution and weathered several financial crises until 1929, when the Norwegian government started providing modest support. A number of famous Norwegians have served as artistic directors for the theatre, but [[Vilhelm Krag]] who took over in 1911, is credited as having brought the theatre into its "golden age."
[[File:NationalTheatretBack.jpg|thumb|left]]
The theatre is often considered the home for Ibsen's plays, and most of his works have been performed here. Notable is also the children's Christmas play, ''The Journey to the Christmas Star'' ({{lang|no|Reisen til Julestjernen}}), written by the then theatre's finance director [[Sverre Brandt]] and performed for the first time in 1924.

The main building is centrally located between the [[Royal Palace, Oslo]] and the [[Parliament of Norway]].  It is served by [[National Theatre Station]] and [[National Theatre metro station]]s.  It was designed by [[architect]] [[Henrik Bull]].
The theatre organisation manages four stages: the main stage ({{lang|no|Hovedscenen}}), the amphitheatre ({{lang|no|Amfiscenen}}) and Painting Parlour ({{lang|no|Malersalen}}) within the main building.  The fourth is the Torshov Theatre ({{lang|no|Torshovteatret}}) in the [[Torshov]] district of Oslo.
{{As of|2009}}, the theatre's artistic director was [[Hanne Tømta]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">'''Nordic Challenge Cup''' (NCC) was the predecessor of the popular and long-running [[sports car racing]] series [[Interserie]], which is known as the "European [[Can-Am]]" and still exists today. NCC consisted of only three races in 1969 and was replaced by Interserie in 1970. It is now mostly remembered for the large number of [[Formula One]] drivers competing in it. Among these drivers were [[Jochen Rindt]], who won the F1 [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Championship]] [[wikt:Posthumous|posthumously]] in 1970, and [[Jackie Oliver]]. The series also launched the career of [[Leo Kinnunen]] who went on to win the [[World Sportscar Championship]] the next year.

{{Campaignbox Guadalcanal}}
{{Campaignbox Solomons}}

{{Nihongo|'''Operation ''Ke'''''|ケ号作戦|Ke-gō Sakusen}} was the largely successful withdrawal of Japanese forces from [[Guadalcanal]], concluding the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] of World {{nowrap|War II}}. The operation took place between 14 January and 7 February 1943, and involved both [[Imperial Japanese Army|army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|navy]] forces under the overall direction of the Japanese [[Imperial General Headquarters]] (IGH). Commanders of the operation included [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] and [[Hitoshi Imamura]].

The Japanese decided to withdraw and concede Guadalcanal to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces for several reasons. All attempts by the Japanese army to recapture [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]], the airfield on Guadalcanal in use by Allied aircraft, had been repulsed with heavy losses.  Japanese ground forces on the island had been reduced from 36,000 to 11,000 through starvation, disease, and battle casualties. Japanese naval forces in the area were also suffering heavy losses attempting to reinforce and resupply the ground forces on the island. These losses, plus the projected resources needed for further attempts to recapture Guadalcanal, were affecting strategic security and operations in other areas of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]]. The decision to withdraw was endorsed by [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Hirohito]] on 31 December 1942.

The operation began on 14 January 1943 with the delivery of a battalion of infantry troops to Guadalcanal to act as [[rearguard]] for the evacuation. Around the same time, Japanese army and navy air forces began an [[air superiority]] campaign around the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. During the air campaign, a US [[cruiser]] was sunk in the [[Battle of Rennell Island]]. Two days later, Japanese aircraft sank a US [[destroyer]] near Guadalcanal. The withdrawal was carried out on the nights of 1, 4, and 7 February by destroyers.

At a cost of one destroyer sunk and three damaged, the Japanese evacuated 10,652 men from Guadalcanal. During the evacuation 600 died and 3,000 more required extensive hospital care. On 9 February, Allied forces realized that the Japanese were gone and declared Guadalcanal secure, ending the six-month campaign for control of the island.

==Background==

===Guadalcanal Campaign===
{{Main|Guadalcanal Campaign}}

On 7 August 1942, the US [[1st Marine Division]] landed on Guadalcanal, [[Tulagi]], and [[Florida Islands]] in the [[Solomon Islands]]. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as [[Military base|bases]] for threatening the [[materiel|supply]] routes between the US and Australia, and to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign with the eventual goal of capturing or neutralizing the major Japanese base at [[Rabaul]] while also supporting the Allied [[New Guinea campaign]]. The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Hogue, ''Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal'', pp. 235–236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking the Japanese by surprise, by nightfall on 8 August the Allied troops (mainly [[United States Marine Corps]]) [[Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo|secured Tulagi]] and nearby small islands as well as the Japanese airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal. The Allies later renamed it "Henderson Field". Allied aircraft operating out of Henderson were called the "[[Cactus Air Force]]" (CAF) after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, pp. 14–15, Miller, p. 143; Frank, p. 338; Shaw, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters (IGH) assigned the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s (IJA) [[Seventeenth Army (Japan)|17th Army]], a [[corps]]-sized command headquartered at Rabaul under the command of Lieutenant General [[Harukichi Hyakutake]], the task of retaking Guadalcanal.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, pp. 96–99; Dull, p. 225; Miller, pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the threat by CAF aircraft, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) was unable to use large, slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island. Instead, warships based at Rabaul and the [[Shortland Islands]] were used to carry forces to Guadalcanal. The Japanese warships, mainly light [[cruiser]]s and [[destroyer]]s from the [[IJN 8th Fleet|Eighth Fleet]] under the command of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Gunichi Mikawa]], were usually able to make the round trip down "[[The Slot]]" to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack. These high speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the "[[Tokyo Express]]" by Allied forces and "Rat Transportation" by the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 202, 210–211, Morison, pp. 81, 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RabaulStrategicArea.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Solomon Islands]] area in the south [[Pacific]]. The Japanese base at [[Rabaul]] is at the upper left. [[Guadalcanal]] (lower right) lies at the southeastern end of "[[The Slot]]".]]

Using forces delivered to Guadalcanal in this manner, the Japanese army tried three times to retake Henderson Field, but was defeated each time.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 141–158, 218–246, 337–367.&lt;/ref&gt; After the third failure, an attempt by the IJN to deliver the rest of the IJA [[38th Infantry Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|38th Infantry Division]] and its heavy equipment failed during the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] from 12–15 November. Because of this failure, the Japanese canceled their next planned attempt to recapture Henderson Field.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 428–492, Morison, pp. 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-November, Allied forces attacked the Japanese at [[Battle of Buna-Gona|Buna-Gona]] in New Guinea. Japanese [[Combined Fleet]] naval leaders, headquartered at [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] and under the overall command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, felt Allied advances in New Guinea posed a greater threat to the security of the Japanese Empire than an Allied military presence in the southern Solomons. Therefore, Combined Fleet naval staff officers began to prepare plans for abandoning Guadalcanal and shifting priorities and resources to operations around New Guinea. At this time, the navy did not inform the army of their intentions in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt;

As December began, the Japanese experienced considerable difficulty in keeping their troops on Guadalcanal resupplied because of Allied air and naval attacks on the Japanese supply chain of ships and bases. The few supplies delivered to the island were not enough to sustain Japanese troops who, by 7 December, were losing about 50&amp;nbsp;men each day to malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks. The Japanese had delivered almost 30,000 army troops to Guadalcanal since the campaign began, but by December only about 20,000 of that number were still alive; of those, only around 12,000 remained more or less fit for combat duty, with the rest incapacitated by battle wounds, disease, or malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 493–527; Hough, pp. 364–365; Morison, pp. 324–325. The [[malaria]] rate among Japanese troops on Guadalcanal at this time was near 100% and some may have even engaged in [[cannibalism]] because of the lack of food.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IJN continued to suffer losses and damage to its ships in attempting to keep the Japanese on Guadalcanal resupplied. One destroyer was sunk by American warships at the [[Battle of Tassafaronga]] on 30 November. Another destroyer plus a submarine were sunk and two destroyers damaged by American [[PT boat]] and CAF air attacks during subsequent resupply missions from 3–12 December. Compounding the navy's frustration, very few of the supplies carried on these missions reached Japanese army forces on the island. Combined Fleet leaders began telling their army counterparts the losses and damage to warships engaged in the resupply effort threatened future strategic plans for protecting the Japanese Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 513–524; Morison, pp. 318–321; Griffith, p. 268; Toland, p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision to withdraw===
[[File:TakushiroHattori.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Takushiro Hattori]], staff officer at [[Imperial General Headquarters]]]]

Throughout November, Japan's top military leaders at the IGH in Tokyo continued to openly support further efforts to retake Guadalcanal from Allied forces. At the same time, lower-ranking staff officers began to discreetly discuss abandoning the island. [[Takushiro Hattori]] and [[Masanobu Tsuji]], each of whom had recently visited Guadalcanal, told their colleagues on the staff that any further attempt to retake the island was a lost cause. [[Ryūzō Sejima]] reported that the attrition of IJA troop-strength on Guadalcanal was so unexpectedly severe that future operations would be untenable. On 11 December  two staff officers, IJN Commander Yuji Yamamoto and IJA Major Takahiko Hayashi, returned to Tokyo from Rabaul and confirmed Hattori's, Tsuji's, and Sejima's reports. They further reported that most of the IJN and IJA officers at Rabaul appeared to support abandoning Guadalcanal. Around this time, Japan's [[Ministry of War of Japan|War Ministry]] informed the IGH that there was insufficient shipping to support both the effort to retake Guadalcanal and transport strategic resources to maintain Japan's economy and military forces.&lt;ref&gt;Hayashi, p. 62, Griffith, p. 268, Frank, pp. 534–536, Toland, pp. 421–423.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December, a delegation of IGH staff officers led by IJA Colonel [[Joichiro Sanada]], chief of the IGH's operations section, arrived at Rabaul for discussions about future plans concerning New Guinea and Guadalcanal. [[Hitoshi Imamura]], commander of the 8th Area Army in charge of IJA operations in New Guinea and the Solomons, did not directly recommend a withdrawal from Guadalcanal but openly and clearly described the current difficulties involved with any further attempts to retake the island. Imamura also stated that any decision to withdraw should include plans to evacuate as many of the soldiers from Guadalcanal as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 268, Frank, pp. 536–538, Jersey, p. 384, Hayashi, p. 62. The 8th Area Army commanded the 17th Army on Guadalcanal and the [[Eighteenth Army (Japan)|18th Army]] in New Guinea (Miller, p. 337). Sejima was included in the delegation to Rabaul.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanada returned to Tokyo on 25 December and recommended to the IGH that Guadalcanal be abandoned immediately and all priority given to the campaign in New Guinea. The IGH's top leaders agreed with Sanada's recommendation on 26 December and ordered their staffs to begin drafting plans for the withdrawal from Guadalcanal and establishment of a new defense line in the central Solomons.&lt;ref&gt;Jersey, p. 384, Frank, p. 538, Griffith, p. 268, Hayashi, pp. 62–64, Toland, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December, General [[Hajime Sugiyama]] and Admiral [[Osami Nagano]] personally informed [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Hirohito]] of the decision to withdraw from Guadalcanal. On 31 December, the Emperor formally endorsed the decision.&lt;ref&gt;Hayashi, pp. 62–64, Griffith, p. 268, Frank, p. 539, Toland, p. 426. During the conference with Sugiyama and Nagano, the Emperor asked Nagano, "Why was it that it took the Americans just a few days to build an air base and the Japanese more than a month or so?" (The IJN originally occupied Guadalcanal and began constructing the airfield). Nagano apologized and replied that the Americans had used machines while the Japanese had to rely on manpower. (Toland, p. 426.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plan and forces===
On 3 January, IGH informed the 8th Area Army and the Combined Fleet of the decision to withdraw from Guadalcanal. By 9 January, the Combined Fleet and 8th Area Army staffs together completed the plan, officially called Operation ''[[Ke (kana)|Ke]]'' after a [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]] in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[Kana]] vocabulary, to execute the evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 338, Frank, pp. 540–541, Morison, pp. 333–334, Rottman, p. 64, Griffith, p. 269, Jersey, p. 384, Hayashi, p. 64. Imamura and [[Jinichi Kusaka]], IJN commander at Rabaul, at first objected to the withdrawal order but accepted it on being reminded that it had the Emperor's endorsement.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan called for a battalion of army infantry to land by destroyer on Guadalcanal around 14 January to act as a rear guard during the evacuation. The 17th Army was to begin withdrawing to the western end of the island about 25 or 26 January. An [[air superiority]] campaign around the southern Solomons would begin on 28 January. The 17th Army would be picked up in three lifts by destroyers the first week of February with a target completion date of 10 February. At the same time, Japanese air and naval forces would conduct conspicuous maneuvers and minor attacks around New Guinea and the [[Marshall Islands]] along with deceptive radio traffic to try to confuse the Allies as to their intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, p. 541, Morison, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gunichi Mikawa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Gunichi Mikawa]], commander of the 8th Fleet]]

Yamamoto detailed [[aircraft carrier]]s {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Jun'yō||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuihō||2}}, battleships {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kongō||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Haruna||2}} – with four heavy cruisers and a destroyer as the screening force – under [[Nobutake Kondō]] to provide distant cover for ''Ke'' around [[Ontong Java]] in the northern Solomons. The evacuation runs were to be carried out by Mikawa's 8th Fleet, consisting of heavy cruisers {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Chōkai||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Kumano||2}}, light cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Sendai||2}}, and 21 destroyers. Mikawa's destroyers were charged with conducting the evacuation. Yamamoto expected that at least half of Mikawa's destroyers would be sunk during the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 542, 547–550, Morison, pp. 338, 363, Rottman, p. 64, Griffith, p. 278, Jersey, pp. 392–393. The 21 destroyers do not include {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Suzukaze||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Hatsukaze||2}} which were damaged on Tokyo Express runs to Guadalcanal on 2 and 10 January. ''Suzukaze'' was damaged in the Slot by a near miss from a bomb dropped by a CAF aircraft. ''Hatsukaze'' was damaged by a PT boat torpedo between Doma Cove and Tassafaronga at Guadalcanal. Both Express missions together were able to successfully deliver about 80 tons of supplies, a significant boost for the 17th Army's depleted stores.  Kondō's force consisted of carriers ''Zuihō'' and ''Jun'yō'', battleships ''Kongō'' and ''Haruna'', heavy cruisers {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Atago||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Takao|1930|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Myōkō||2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Haguro||2}}, light cruisers {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Jintsū||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Agano||2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Nagara||2}}, destroyers {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Kagerō|1938|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Asagumo|1937|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Shigure|1935|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Suzukaze||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Samidare|1935|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Ōshio||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Hatsuyuki|1928|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Shikinami|1929|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Arashio||2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Arashi||2}}, and support ships [[Nippon Maru (1936)|''Nippon Maru'']] and [[Ken'yō Maru (1939)|''Ken'yō Maru'']].&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporting the air superiority portion of the operation were the IJN's 11th Air Fleet and the IJA's 6th Air Division, based at Rabaul with 212 and 100 aircraft, respectively. 64 aircraft from carrier {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}}{{'}}s air group were also temporarily assigned to Rabaul. An additional 60 floatplanes from the IJN's "R" Area Air Force, based at Rabaul, [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], and the [[Shortland Islands]], brought the total number of Japanese aircraft involved in the operation to 436. The combined Japanese warship and naval air units in the area formed the [[Southeast Area Fleet]], commanded by [[Jinichi Kusaka]] at Rabaul.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, p. 543.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposing the Japanese and under the command of [[United States Navy]] [[Admiral]] [[William Halsey, Jr.]], commander of Allied forces in the South Pacific, were fleet carriers {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}, six [[escort carrier]]s, three fast battleships, four old battleships, 13 cruisers, and 45 destroyers. In the air, the [[Thirteenth Air Force|13th Air Force]] numbered 92 fighters and bombers under [[United States Army]] [[Brigadier General]] [[Nathan Farragut Twining|Nathan F. Twining]] and the [[Cactus Air Force|CAF]] on Guadalcanal counted 81 aircraft under [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] Brigadier General [[Francis P. Mulcahy]]. [[Rear Admiral]] [[Aubrey Fitch]] was overall commander of Aircraft South Pacific. The air units of the fleet and escort carriers added another 339 aircraft. In addition, 30 heavy bombers were stationed in New Guinea with sufficient range to conduct missions over the Solomon Islands. In total, the Allies possessed around 539 aircraft available to oppose the ''Ke'' operation.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 542–543. The four old battleships in Halsey's fleet were {{USS|Maryland|BB-46|2}}, {{USS|Colorado|BB-45|2}}, {{USS|New Mexico|BB-40|2}} and {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|2}} (Frank, p. 751). Fifty-five [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] and 60 [[B-24 Liberator|B-24]] heavy bombers with the range to reach Guadalcanal were assigned to the [[Fifth Air Force|5th Air Force]] in New Guinea, but only about 30 of them were operational at any one time (Frank, p. 752).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the first week of January, disease, starvation, and battle had reduced Hyakutake's command to about 14,000 troops, with many of them too sick and malnourished to fight. The 17th Army possessed three operable [[artillery|field cannon]], with very little ammunition. In contrast, the Allied commander on the island, US Army Major General [[Alexander Patch]], fielded a combined force of US Army and [[US Marines]], designated the [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]], totaling 50,666 men. At Patch's disposal were 167 artillery weapons, including [[M116 howitzer|{{convert|75|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}]], [[M101 howitzer|{{convert|105|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}]], and [[M114 155 mm howitzer|{{convert|155|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}]] [[howitzer]]s, and plentiful stocks of shells.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 543–544, Rottman, p. 64. American artillery totals do not include anti-aircraft or coastal defense guns (Frank, p. 752). At this time, the Japanese 2nd Division was down to 3,700 still alive of the original 12,000 delivered to Guadalcanal.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation===
On 1 January, the Japanese military changed their radio communication codes, making it more difficult for Allied [[Military intelligence|intelligence]], which had previously partially broken Japanese radio ciphers, to divine Japanese intentions and movement. As January progressed, Allied [[reconnaissance]] and radio [[traffic analysis]] noted the buildup of ships and aircraft at Truk, Rabaul, and the Shortland Islands. Allied analysts determined that the increased radio traffic in the Marshalls was a deception meant to divert attention from an operation about to take place in either New Guinea or the Solomons. Allied intelligence personnel misinterpreted the nature of the operation; on 26 January, the [[United States Pacific Command|Allied Pacific Command]]'s intelligence section informed Allied forces in the Pacific that the Japanese were preparing for a new offensive, called ''Ke'', in either the Solomons or New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 545–546, Morison, pp. 340, 351, D'Albas, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January, an Express mission of nine destroyers delivered the Yano Battalion, designated as the rear guard for the ''Ke'' evacuation, to Guadalcanal. The battalion, commanded by Major Keiji Yano, consisted of 750 infantry and a battery of [[mountain gun]]s crewed by another 100 men. Accompanying the battalion was Lieutenant Colonel [[Kumao Imoto]], representing the 8th Area Army, who was to deliver the evacuation order and plan to Hyakutake. The 17th Army had not yet been informed of the decision to withdraw. CAF and 13th Air Force air attacks on the nine destroyers during their return trip damaged destroyers {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Arashi||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Tanikaze|1940|2}} and destroyed eight Japanese fighters escorting the convoy. Five American aircraft were shot down.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 279, Frank, pp. 559–560, Morison, p. 339, Rottman, p. 64, Jersey, pp. 386–388, Toland, p. 427. The men of the Yano Battalion were drawn from personnel originally intended as replacements for the 38th Infantry Division's 230th Infantry Regiment already on Guadalcanal. Most of them were untrained reservists with an average age of 30. Also delivered on this mission were 150 communications specialist from the 8th Area Army to help coordinate the operation  The first strike on the Express convoy on 15 January was by 15 CAF [[SBD Dauntless|SBD]]s escorted by seven [[F4F Wildcat]]s and six [[P-39 Airacobra]]s. Two SBDs, one Wildcat, and two P-39s were downed along with three fighters from the IJA's 6th Air Division (Frank, p. 754). The second, later airstrike consisted of nine B-17s, presumably from the 13th Air Force, and 14 fighters, presumably from the CAF, suffered no losses and shot down five of ten F1M2 "Pete" aircraft from the "R" Area Air Force that were protecting the convoy. ''Arashi'' was forced to go to Truk for repairs. ''Tanikaze''{{'}}s captain, Commander Motoi Katsumi, was killed by the air attack (Nevitt, ''CombinedFleet.com'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Late on 15 January, Imoto reached 17th Army's headquarters at Kokumbona and informed Hyakutake and his staff of the decision to withdraw from the island. Grudgingly accepting the order on the 16th, the 17th Army staff communicated the ''Ke'' evacuation plan to their forces on the 18th. The plan directed the 38th Division, which was currently defending against an American [[Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse|offensive]] on ridges and hills in the interior of the island, to disengage and withdraw towards Cape Esperance on the western end of Guadalcanal beginning on the 20th. The 38th's retirement would be covered by the [[2nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|2nd Infantry Division]], in place on Guadalcanal since October 1942, and the Yano Battalion, both of which would then follow the 38th westward. Any troops unable to move were encouraged to kill themselves to "uphold the honor of the Imperial Army".&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 541, 560–562, Miller, p. 349, Jersey, pp. 368, 388–389, Griffith, pp. 279–284, Rottman, p. 64, Toland, pp. 428–429. Marching to Kokumbona, Imoto later related that he passed numerous, unburied bodies and sick and emaciated Japanese soldiers. At first upon hearing the order to withdraw, Hyakutake, his chief of staff, Major General [[Shuichi Miyazaki]], and senior staff officer Colonel [[Norio Konuma]] contemplated disobeying the order and sacrificing the 17th Army in a final attack on Allied forces. Hyakutake finally accepted the order at noon on 16 January. The delay in informing the 17th's subordinate units apparently was in part because Konuma had to carry the orders on foot, first to the 38th Division, then to the 2nd Division.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdrawal westward===
Patch initiated a new offensive just as the 38th Division began to withdraw from the inland ridges and hills that it had occupied. On 20 January, the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]], under Major General [[J. Lawton Collins]], attacked several hills, designated Hills 87, 88, and 89 by the Americans, that formed a ridge that dominated Kokumbona. Encountering much lighter resistance than anticipated, the Americans seized the three hills by the morning of 22 January. Shifting forces to exploit the unexpected breakthrough, Collins quickly continued the advance and captured the next two hills, 90 and 91, by nightfall, placing the Americans in position to isolate and capture Kokumbona and trap the Japanese 2nd Division.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, pp. 367–368, Frank, pp. 568–570, Miller, pp. 319–329, Morison, pp. 342–343. In the offensive, the 2nd Marine Division pressed the Japanese 2nd Division on the coast as the U.S. 25th Division, using two of its three regiments, the 27th and 161st, attacked inland. The 161st was originally tasked with capturing three nearby hills, Hills X, Y, and Z, but was retasked to support the 27th after the latter captured Hill 87 much more quickly than anticipated.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GuadKokumbonaJan23-25.gif|thumb|left|American forces capture Kokumbona and begin the push westward, 23–25 January.]]

Reacting quickly to the situation, the Japanese hurriedly evacuated Kokumbona and ordered the 2nd Division to retire westward immediately. The Americans captured Kokumbona on 23 January. Although some Japanese units were trapped between the American forces and destroyed, most of the 2nd Division's survivors escaped.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, p. 570, Miller, p. 329–332, Morison, p. 343. Morison says about 600 Japanese troops were killed in the taking of Kokumbona.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still fearing a renewed and reinforced Japanese offensive, Patch committed the equivalent of only one regiment at a time to attack the Japanese forces west of Kokumbona, keeping the rest near Lunga Point to protect the airfield. The terrain west of Kokumbona favored the Japanese efforts to delay the Americans as the rest of the 17th Army continued its withdrawal towards Cape Esperance. The American advance was hemmed into a corridor only {{convert|300|-|600|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide between the ocean and the thick, inland jungle and steep coral ridges. The ridges, running perpendicular to the coast, paralleled numerous streams and creeks that crossed the corridor with "washboard regularity."&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, pp. 284–285, Frank, pp. 570–572, Hough, pp. 369–371, Miller, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January, a combined U.S. Army and Marine unit called the Composite Army-Marine (CAM) Division advancing westward encountered the Yano Battalion at the Marmura River. Yano's troops temporarily halted the CAM's advance and then slowly withdrew westward over the next three days. On 29 January, the Yano retreated across the Bonegi River, where soldiers from the 2nd Division had constructed another defensive position.&lt;ref&gt;Jersey, pp. 373, 375–376 Frank, p. 572, Morison, p. 343, Griffith, p 285, Hough, p. 369–371, Miller, p. 341, Shaw, pp. 50–51. At this time, the CAM consisted of units from the [[6th Marine Regiment (United States)|6th Marine Regiment]] and US Army's 147th Infantry Regiment. According to Jersey, also defending the Bonegi were troops from the 229th Regiment.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese defenses at the Bonegi held up the American advance for almost three days. On 1 February, with help from a shore bombardment by the destroyers {{USS|Wilson|DD-408|6}} and {{USS|Anderson|DD-411|2}}, the Americans successfully crossed the river but did not immediately press the advance westward.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, p. 572, Morison, pp. 343–344, Jersey, pp. 373–374, 381, Miller, pp. 341–342. Between 10 and 31 January the Americans lost 189 soldiers and Marines killed.  Exact Japanese casualties in the Marmura and Bonegi River actions are unknown but Japanese records described their losses as "heavy". During this time, the Americans captured 105 Japanese soldiers, 240 machine guns, 42 field pieces, 10 antiaircraft guns, 9 antitank guns, 142 mortars, 323 rifles, 18 radios, 1 radar, 13 trucks, 6 tractors, and 1 staff car, besides a quantity of ammunition, land mines, flame throwers, and piles of documents (Miller p. 342).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air campaign===
The ''Ke'' air superiority campaign began in mid-January with nightly harassment attacks on Henderson Field by 3–10 aircraft, causing little damage. On 20 January, a lone [[Kawanishi H8K]] bombed [[Espiritu Santo]]. On 25 January, the IJN sent 58 Zero fighters on a daylight raid to Guadalcanal. In response, the CAF sent aloft eight [[F4F Wildcat|Wildcat]] and six [[P-38 Lightning|P-38]] fighters, which shot down four Zeros without loss.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 573–574, 756, Morison, pp. 340, 347. In addition to the four Zeros destroyed, six or more Zeros were damaged. One [[Mitsubishi G4M]] bomber sent along as a decoy failed to return. Two G4M's were lost during the night harassment campaign. A Zero was lost in a 20 January raid on [[Port Moresby]]. [[Chester Nimitz]] and Secretary of the Navy [[Frank Knox]] visited Espiritu Santo on 20 January and Guadalcanal on 21 January but were uninjured by the bombing attacks.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second large raid was conducted on 27 January by nine [[Kawasaki Ki-48]] "Lily" light bombers escorted by 74 [[Nakajima Ki-43]] "Oscar" fighters from the IJA's 6th Air Division from Rabaul. Twelve Wildcats, six P-38s, and 10 [[Curtiss P-40|P-40s]] from Henderson met the raid over Guadalcanal. In the resulting action, the Japanese lost six fighters while the CAF lost one Wildcat, four P-40s, and two P-38s. The "Lily"s dropped their bombs on American positions around the [[Matanikau River]], causing little damage.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 574, 756, Morison, pp. 347–348. The leader of the raid was Lieutenant Colonel Shuichi Okamoto. Two [[Mitsubishi Ki-46]] "Dinah"s from the 76th Independent Chutai also accompanied the raid. The "Lily"s were from the 45th Sentai. Thirty-six of the "Oscar"s were from the 1st Sentai, 33 from the 11th Sentai, and five were from the Headquarters of the 12th Air Wing.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Rennell Island===
{{Main|Battle of Rennell Island}}

Believing that the Japanese were beginning a major offensive in the southern Solomons aimed at Henderson Field, Halsey responded by sending, beginning on 29 January, a resupply convoy to Guadalcanal supported by most of his warship forces, separated into five [[task force]]s. These five task forces included two fleet [[aircraft carrier|carriers]], two [[escort carrier]]s, three [[battleship]]s, 12 cruisers, and 25 destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, pp. 351–352, Frank, p. 577. The supply convoy consisted of four transports escorted by four destroyers and was designated Task Group (TG) 62.8.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:US cruisers of Task Force 18 at sea en route to Guadalcanal on 29 January 1943.jpg|thumb|left|Giffen's Task Force 18 heads towards Guadalcanal on 29 January.]]

Screening the approach of the transport convoy was Task Force 18 (TF&amp;nbsp;18), under Rear Admiral [[Robert C. Giffen]], with three heavy and three light cruisers, two escort carriers, and eight destroyers. A fleet carrier task force, centered on carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, steamed about {{convert|250|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} behind TF&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 577–578, Crenshaw, p. 62, Morison, pp. 352–353.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to protecting the supply convoy, TF&amp;nbsp;18 was charged with rendezvousing with a force of four U.S. destroyers, stationed at [[Tulagi]], at 21:00 on 29 January in order to conduct a sweep up "[[The Slot]]" north of Guadalcanal the next day to screen the unloading of the transports at Guadalcanal.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, p. 578.&lt;/ref&gt; As the escort carriers were too slow to allow Giffen's force to make the scheduled rendezvous, Giffen left the carriers behind with two destroyers at 14:00 on 29 January and steamed ahead.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

Giffen's force was being tracked by Japanese submarines, who reported on Giffen's location and movement to their naval headquarters units.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 354, Tagaya, p. 66 says that it was a Japanese search airplane that spotted Giffen.&lt;/ref&gt; Around mid-afternoon, based on the submarine's reports, 16 [[Mitsubishi G4M]] "Betty" from the [[705 Air Group]] and 16 [[Mitsubishi G3M]] "Nell" [[bomber]]s from the [[701 Air Group]] took off from Rabaul carrying torpedoes to attack Giffen's force, now located between [[Rennell Island]] and Guadalcanal.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, pp. 354–355, Tagaya, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The torpedo bombers attacked Giffen's ships in two waves between 19:00 and 20:00. Two torpedoes hit the heavy cruiser {{USS|Chicago|CA-29|6}}, causing heavy damage and bringing her to a dead stop. Three of the Japanese aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships. In response, Halsey sent a [[tugboat|tug]] to take ''Chicago'' under tow and ordered Giffen's task force to return to base the next day. Six destroyers were left behind to escort ''Chicago'' and the tugboat.&lt;ref&gt;Crenshaw, pp. 62–63, Morison, pp. 355–359, Frank, pp. 579–580.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 16:00 on 30 January, a flight of 11 Mitsubishi torpedo bombers from the [[751 Air Group]], based at [[Kavieng]] and staging through [[Buka, Papua New Guinea|Buka]], attacked the force towing ''Chicago''. Fighter aircraft from ''Enterprise'' shot down eight of them, but most of the Japanese aircraft were able to release their torpedoes before crashing. One torpedo hit the destroyer {{USS|La Vallette|DD-448|6}}, causing heavy damage. Four more torpedoes hit ''Chicago'', sinking her.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, pp. 360–363, Frank, pp. 580–581, Crenshaw, pp. 64–65, Tagaya, pp. 66–67. One other Mitsubishi G4M on a scouting mission was shot down by ''Enterprise'' aircraft just before the final attack on ''Chicago''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The transport convoy reached Guadalcanal and successfully unloaded its cargo on 30–31 January. The rest of Halsey's warships took station in the [[Coral Sea]] south of the Solomons to wait for the approach of any Japanese warship forces supporting what the Allies believed to be an imminent offensive. The departure of TF&amp;nbsp;18 from the Guadalcanal area removed a significant potential threat to the ''Ke'' operation.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 363, Griffith, p. 285. After unloading their cargo, the transports evacuated the [[2nd Marine Regiment (United States)|2nd Marine Regiment]] from the island. The 2nd Marines had been on Guadalcanal since the beginning of the campaign.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 18:30 on 29 January, two [[corvette]]s from the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]], {{HMNZS|Moa|T233|2}} and {{HMNZS|Kiwi|T102|2}}, intercepted the Japanese submarine {{Ship|Japanese submarine|I-1||2}}, which was attempting a supply run, off of Kamimbo on Guadalcanal. The two corvettes rammed and sank ''I-1'' after a 90-minute battle ({{coord|09|13|S|159|40|E|scale:3000000|display=inline,title}}).&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 574–576, Hackett and Kingsepp [http://www.combinedfleet.com/I-1.htm HIJMS Submarine I-1 : Tabular Record of Movement], Morison, pp. 348–350, Jersey, p. 372. ''Moa'' and ''Kiwi'' were based at Tulagi along with two other New Zealand corvettes- {{HMNZS|Matai|T01|2}} and {{HMNZS|Tui|T234|2}}. ''Moa'' was under the command of (then) Lieutenant Commander [[Peter Phipps]]. ''I-1'' was under the command of Lieutenant Commander Eiichi Sakamoto. Sixty-six of the submarine's crew survived to reach shore, but Sakamoto was killed along with 26 others of his crew. The submarine's gunnery officer, Ensign Ko Oikawa, was captured by ''Moa''. ''I-1'' sank in shallow water, leaving about {{convert|15|ft|m}} of the sub sticking out of the water at a 45° angle. On the night of 2 February, three of the sub's survivors along with 11 other IJN personnel present on Guadalcanal unsuccessfully attempted to destroy the wrecked sub. On 10 February, a raid by nine [[Aichi D3A]] divebombers escorted by 28 Zeros from the 582nd Naval Air Group at Buin struck the wreck, damaging it further but failing to destroy it. On 13 and 15 February, Japanese submarine ''I-2'' attempted unsuccessfully to locate the wreck and complete its destruction. Allied divers later recovered five code books from the submarine, including one for a version of the JN-25 code. Assuming that the code had been compromised, the IJN upgraded three major naval codes. (Hackett and Kingsepp)&lt;/ref&gt;

===First evacuation run===
Leaving his cruisers at Kavieng, Mikawa gathered all 21 of his destroyers at the Japanese naval base in the Shortlands on 31 January to begin the evacuation runs. Rear Admiral [[Shintaro Hashimoto]] was placed in charge of this group of destroyers, titled the Reinforcement Unit. The "R" Area Air Force's 60 floatplanes were tasked with scouting for the Reinforcement Unit and helping defend against Allied PT boat attacks during the nighttime evacuation runs. Allied B-17 bombers attacked the Shortlands anchorage on the morning of 1 February, causing no damage and losing four aircraft to Japanese fighters. This same day, the IJA's 6th Air Division raided Henderson Field with 23 "Oscar"s and six "Lily"s but caused no damage and suffered the loss of one fighter.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 582–583, 757–758. The Reinforcement Unit included Destroyer Squadron 10 (DesRon10).  DesRon10 was normally under the command of Rear Admiral [[Susumu Kimura]], but Kimura was injured when the U.S. submarine {{USS|Nautilus|SS-168|2}} damaged his flagship {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Akizuki|1941|2}} with a torpedo near Shortland on 19 January (Nevitt, [http://www.combinedfleet.com/akizuk_t.htm IJN Akizuki: Tabular Record of Movement]). Kimura was replaced by Rear Admiral [[Tomiji Koyanagi]] who was also designated as commander of the Reinforcement Unit, but for the ''Ke'' operation Hashimoto was selected to command the unit. On the night of 28 January, six of the Reinforcement Unit's destroyers, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Tokitsukaze|1939|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Kuroshio||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Shirayuki|1928|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Urakaze|1940|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Hamakaze|1940|2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Kawakaze|1936|2}}, had landed 328 men in the [[Russell Islands]] in case the islands were needed as a staging and support area for the evacuation. A CAF attack on these men injured 17 of them. The "R" Area Air Force on 1 February consisted of 12 [[Aichi E13A]], 12 [[Nakajima A6M2-N]], and 36 [[Mitsubishi F1M]] aircraft operating from the [[seaplane tender]]s {{Ship|Japanese seaplane tender|Kamikawa Maru||2}}, ''Kunikawa Maru'', and ''Sanyo Maru''. Frank states that ''Sendai'' and ''Suzuya'' contributed six [[Aichi E16A]] aircraft, but ''Suzuya'' was in Japan at this time (Hackett and Kingsepp, [http://www.combinedfleet.com/suzuya_t.htm HIJMS SUZUYA: Tabular Record of Movement]) but ''Kumano'' was at Kavieng. The 204th, 253rd, 582nd, and ''Zuikaku''{{'}}s Air Groups stationed their Zeros and [[Aichi D3A]] at Buin for the operation. The 252nd Air Group was deployed to the Shortlands airfield. The B-17 raid on 1 February was intercepted by five Zeros from the 253rd, 12 from the 204th, 14 from the 582nd, and 17 from the 252nd.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GuadFinalJan26-Feb9.gif|thumb|right|Map of the final phase of the Guadalcanal Campaign, 26 January – 9 February, showing the American advances and Japanese defensive positions and evacuation points.]]

Believing that the Japanese might be retreating to the south coast of Guadalcanal, on the morning of 1 February Patch landed a reinforced battalion of army and Marine troops, about 1,500 men under the command of Colonel Alexander George, at Verahue on Guadalcanal's south coast. The U.S. troops were delivered to the landing location by a naval transport force of six [[landing craft tank]]s and one transport destroyer ({{USS|Stringham|DD-83|6}}), escorted by four other destroyers (the same destroyers that were to have joined TF&amp;nbsp;18 three days earlier). A Japanese reconnaissance aircraft spotted the naval landing force. Believing that the force posed a threat to that night's scheduled evacuation run, an airstrike of 13 [[Aichi D3A]]2 "Val" [[dive bomber]]s escorted by 40 Zeros departed Buin, Bougainville to attack the ships.&lt;ref&gt;Jersey, pp. 376–378, Frank, p. 583, Morison, pp. 364–365, Miller, pp. 343–345, Zimmerman, p. 162. Patch's landing force consisted of the 2nd Battalion, 132nd Infantry Regiment, the 132nd's anti-tank company, an additional company (Company M) from the regiment, one platoon from the regiment's Company K, Battery F of the [[10th Marine Regiment (United States)|10th Marines]] with 75mm pack howitzers, one platoon of the 65th Engineers, and detachments from the 101st Medical Regiment, 26th Signal Company, and service personnel. The Japanese dive bombers were from the 582nd Air Group escorted by 21 Zeros from the 582nd and 19 Zeros from ''Zuikaku''{{'}}s air group.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mistaking the Japanese strike aircraft as friendly, the U.S. destroyers withheld fire until the "Val"s began their attack. Beginning at 14:53, destroyer {{USS|De Haven|DD-469|6}} was rapidly hit by three bombs and sank almost immediately {{convert|2|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} south of [[Savo Island]] with the loss of 167 of her crew, including her captain. Destroyer {{USS|Nicholas|DD-449|6}} was damaged by several near-misses. Five "Val"s and three Zeros were lost to anti-aircraft fire and CAF fighters. The CAF lost three Wildcats in the engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 584–585, Morison, p. 366, Brown, p. 81, Jersey, p. 377. With the two destroyers were LCTs ''63'' and ''181'' whose machine-guns assisted in shooting at the attacking aircraft. ''Nicholas'' and other ships recovered 146 ''De Haven'' survivors. ''De Haven''{{'}}s captain was Charles E. Tolman. Two of ''Nicholas'' crew were killed in the attack. Destroyers {{USS|Radford|DD-446|2}} and {{USS|Fletcher|DD-445|2}} were still near Verahue with two other LCTs at the time of the raid. The four destroyers together made up Destroyer Squadron 21 under the command of Captain Robert Briscoe. Jersey says the LCTs involved in the operation were ''58'', ''60'', ''62'', ''156'', and ''158''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hashimoto departed the Shortlands at 11:30 on 1 February with 20 destroyers for the first evacuation run. Eleven destroyers were designated as transports screened by the other nine. The destroyers were attacked in the late afternoon near [[Vangunu]] by 92 CAF aircraft in two waves. {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Makinami|1941|2}}, Hashimoto's flagship, was heavily damaged by a near miss. Four CAF aircraft were shot down. Hashimoto transferred to {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Shirayuki|1928|2}} and detached {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Fumizuki|1926|2}} to tow ''Makinami'' back to base.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 585–586, 758, Morison, p. 366, Jersey, pp. 392–393. Assigned as transports were {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Kazegumo||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Makigumo|1941|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Yūgumo|1941|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Akigumo|1941|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Tanikaze|1940|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Urakaze|1940|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Hamakaze|1940|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Isokaze|1939|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Tokitsukaze|1939|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Yukikaze|1939|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Ōshio||2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Arashio||2}}. Screening were {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Makinami|1941|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Maikaze||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Kawakaze|1936|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Kuroshio||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Shirayuki|1928|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Fumizuki|1926|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Satsuki|1925|2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Nagatsuki|1926|2}}. A [[coastwatchers|coastwatcher]] on Vella Lavella, either [[Henry Josselyn]] or [[John Keenan (coastwatcher)|John Keenan]] (Feldt, Eric, ''The Coast Watchers'', Penguin Books, 1991 (1946), p. 241.) sighted the destroyers at 13:20 and notified Allied forces on Guadalcanal. The CAF aircraft claimed to have shot down 17 Zeros escorting the destroyers, but actual Japanese aircraft losses are unknown. After the attack, ''Makigumo'' and ''Yugumo'' were reassigned as escorts due to the departure of ''Makinami'' and ''Fumizuki''. ''Makinami'' went to Japan for repairs, which were completed in September 1943 (Nevitt, ''CombinedFleet.com'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven U.S. PT boats awaited Hashimoto's destroyers between Guadalcanal and [[Savo Island]]. Beginning at 22:45, Hashimoto's warships and the PT boats engaged in a series of running battles over the next three hours. Hashimoto's destroyers, with help from "R" Area aircraft, sank three of the PT boats.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 587–588, Morison, pp. 367–368, Jersey, pp. 393–395, Toland, pp. 429–430.  ''PT 111'' was sunk by gunfire from ''Kawakaze'' at 22:54, suffering two crewmen killed. ''PT 37'' was sunk by destroyer gunfire sometime later, with all but one of her crew killed (nine). ''PT 123'' was bombed and sunk by an "R" Area aircraft, killing four.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, the transport destroyers arrived off of two pick-up locations at Cape Esperance and Kamimbo at 22:40 and 24:00 respectively. Japanese naval personnel ferried the waiting troops out to the destroyers in barges and landing craft. Rear Admiral [[Tomiji Koyanagi]], second-in-command of the Reinforcement Unit, described the evacuees: "They wore only the remains of clothes that were so soiled their physical deterioration was extreme. Probably they were happy but they showed no expression. Their digestive organs were so completely destroyed, we couldn't give them good food, only porridge."&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 587–588.&lt;/ref&gt; Another officer added that, "Their buttocks were so emaciated that their anuses were completely exposed, and on the destroyers that picked them up they suffered from constant and uncontrolled diarrhea."&lt;ref&gt;Jersey, pp. 391–392, Frank, p. 588. IJN personnel from the 4th Maizuru [[Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces|SNLF]], under Commander Namihira Sasakawa, assisted with the loading. Sasakawa supervised the Cape Esperance embarkation point and Commander Tamao Shinohara the Kamimbo embarkation point.&lt;/ref&gt;

After embarking 4,935 soldiers, mainly from the 38th Division, the transport destroyers ceased loading at 01:58 and prepared to depart for the return trip to the Shortlands. About this time, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Makigumo|1941|2}}, one of the screening destroyers, was suddenly wracked by a large explosion, caused by either a PT boat torpedo or a [[naval mine]]. Informed that ''Makigumo'' was immobilized, Hashimoto ordered her abandoned and scuttled ({{coord|09|15|S|159|47|E|scale:3000000}}). During the return trip, the Reinforcement Unit was attacked by CAF aircraft at 08:00, but sustained no damage and arrived at the Shortlands without further incident at 12:00 on 2 February.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 285, Frank, p. 588, Morison, pp. 367–368, Brown, p. 81, Dull, p. 268. Of the 5,000 evacuated this night, 2,316 were from the 38th Division, all that remained of the 8,000 originally landed on the island. U.S. destroyer-minelayers {{USS|Tracy|DD-214|2}}, {{USS|Montgomery|DD-121|2}}, and {{USS|Preble|DD-345|2}} had previously laid mines between Doma Cove and Cape Esperance and one of these may have claimed ''Makigumo''. Five ''Makigumo'' crewmembers were killed, 237 were rescued (Nevitt, ''CombinedFleet.com''). Eight 11th Air Fleet G4Ms attacked Henderson Field during the night, causing no damage. Six CAF [[SBD Dauntless|SBDs]] attacked Hashimoto's force as it loaded the troops, also causing no damage. Among the troops evacuated this night was [[Tadayoshi Sano]], commander of the 38th Division.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second and third evacuation runs===
On 4 February, Patch ordered the 161st Infantry Regiment to replace the 147th at the front and resume the advance westward. The Yano battalion retreated to new positions at the Segilau River and troops were sent to block the advance of George's force along the south coast. Meanwhile, Halsey's carrier and battleship task forces remained just beyond Japanese air attack range about {{convert|300|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} south of Guadalcanal.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 589–590, Jersey, pp. 378–380, 383, 400–401, Miller pp. 342–343, 346. The Japanese knew the approximate size of George's force after extracting the information from two American soldiers captured in a skirmish near Titi on the south coast. After their interrogations, the two Americans were [[summary execution|summarily executed]]. Assisting the Yano Battalion, now numbering about 350 men after battle losses, were about 60 men from the 124th and 28th Infantry Regiments. On 3 February, the Japanese lost five G4M bombers from an abortive attack on Halsey's fleet, including one carrying Lieutenant Commander Genichi Mihara, commander of the 705th Air Group. The US 161st Regiment at this time was under the command of Colonel [[James Dalton II]] (Miller, p. 346).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Asagumo-1.jpg|thumb|left|{{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Asagumo|1937|2}}]]

Kondō sent two of his force's destroyers, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Asagumo|1937|2}} and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Samidare|1935|2}}, to the Shortlands to replace the two destroyers lost in the first evacuation run. Hashimoto led the second evacuation mission with 20 destroyers south toward Guadalcanal at 11:30 on 4 February. The CAF attacked Hashimoto in two waves beginning at 15:50 with a total of 74 aircraft. Bomb near-misses heavily damaged {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Maikaze||2}}, and Hashimoto detached {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Nagatsuki|1926|2}} to tow her back to Shortland. The CAF lost 11 aircraft in the attack while the Japanese lost one Zero.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 590–591, Morison, pp. 369–370, Jersey, p. 395, Dull, p. 268. US aircraft losses included four [[Grumman TBF Avenger]]s, three [[Douglas SBD Dauntless]]es, three [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]s, and one [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]]. ''Maikaze'' went to Japan for repairs which were completed in July 1943 (Nevitt, ''CombinedFleet.com'').&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. PT boats did not sortie to attack Hashimoto's force this night and the loading went uneventfully. The Reinforcement Force embarked Hyakutake, his staff, and 3,921 men, mainly from the 2nd Division, and reached Bougainville without incident by 12:50 on 5 February. A CAF airstrike launched that morning failed to locate Hashimoto's force.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 285, Frank, p. 591, Morison, p. 370. The evacuees included [[Masao Maruyama (Japanese Army officer)|Masao Maruyama]], commander of the 2nd Division. Japanese aircraft harassed Henderson Field and one [[PBY Catalina]] and five [[SBD Dauntless|SBDs]] from the CAF tried to attack Hashimoto without success during the loading.&lt;/ref&gt;

Believing that the Japanese operations on 1 and 4 February had been reinforcement, not evacuation missions, the American forces on Guadalcanal proceeded slowly and cautiously, advancing only about {{convert|900|yd|m|abbr=on}} each day. George's force halted on 6 February after advancing to Titi on the south coast. On the north coast, the 161st finally began their attack westward at 10:00 on 6 February and reached the Umasani River the same day. At the same time, the Japanese were withdrawing their remaining 2,000 troops to Kamimbo.&lt;ref&gt;Jersey, pp. 391, 394, Frank, pp. 592–591, Miller, pp. 345–346. The Japanese rear guard was commanded by a Colonel Yutaka Matsuda.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 February, the 161st crossed the Umasani and reached Bunina, about {{convert|9|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} from Cape Esperance. George's force, now commanded by George F. Ferry, advanced from Titi to [[Maravovo|Marovovo]] and dug in for the night about {{convert|2000|yd|m|abbr=on}} north of the village.&lt;ref&gt;Jersey, p. 383, Frank, pp. 593–594, Miller, pp. 345–347.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aware of the presence of Halsey's carriers and other large warships near Guadalcanal, the Japanese considered canceling the third evacuation run, but decided to go ahead as planned. Kondō's force closed to within {{convert|550|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} of Guadalcanal from the north to be ready in case Halsey's warships attempted to intervene. Hashimoto departed the Shortlands with 18 destroyers midday of 7 February, this time taking a course south of the Solomons instead of down the Slot. A CAF strike force of 36 aircraft attacked Hashimoto at 17:55, heavily damaging {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Isokaze|1939|2}} with a bomb near miss. ''Isokaze'' retired escorted by ''Kawakaze''. The Allies and the Japanese each lost one aircraft in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 594–595, Morison, p. 370, Jersey, p. 396, Dull, p. 268. The CAF strike force consisted of 15 [[SBD Dauntless|SBDs]], 20 Wildcats, and one [[P-38 Lightning|F5A]]. The F5A and one of the 49 Zeros escorting the convoy were shot down. Ten crewmembers were killed on ''Isokaze'', which was repaired at Truk and returned to action in March 1943 (Nevitt, ''CombinedFleet.com'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving off Kamimbo, Hashimoto's force loaded 1,972 soldiers by 00:03 on 8 February, unhindered by the U.S. Navy. For an additional 90 minutes, destroyer crewmen rowed their boats along the shore calling out again and again to make sure no one was left behind. At 01:32, the Reinforcement Group left Guadalcanal in its wake and reached Bougainville without incident at 10:00, completing the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, pp. 285–286, Frank, p. 595, Morison, p. 370, Jersey, pp. 396–400, Dull, p. 268. According to Jersey, the Yano Battalion had lost a total of 101 men covering the withdrawal. ''Yūgumo'' and ''Akigumo'' retrieved the Japanese troops from the Russells.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
At dawn on 8 February, the U.S. Army forces on both coasts resumed their advances, encountering only a few sick and dying Japanese soldiers. Patch now realized that the Tokyo Express runs over the last week were evacuation, not reinforcement missions. At 16:50 on 9 February, the two American forces met on the west coast at the village of Tenaro. Patch sent a message to Halsey stating, "Total and complete defeat of Japanese forces on Guadalcanal effected 16:25 today...the Tokyo Express no longer has a terminus on Guadalcanal."&lt;ref&gt;Jersey, p. 383, Frank, pp. 596–597, Morison, p. 371, Miller, pp. 346–348.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese had successfully evacuated a total of 10,652 men from Guadalcanal, about all that remained of the 36,000 total troops sent to the island during the campaign. Six hundred of the evacuees succumbed to their injuries or illnesses before they could receive sufficient medical care. Three thousand more required lengthy hospitalization or recuperation. After receiving word of the completion of the operation, Yamamoto commended all the units involved and ordered Kondō to return to Truk with his warships. The 2nd and 38th Divisions were shipped to Rabaul and partially reconstituted with replacements. The 2nd Division was relocated to the [[Philippines]] in March 1943 while the 38th was assigned to defend Rabaul and [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]]. The [[8th Area Army]] and [[Southeast Area Fleet]] reoriented their forces to defend the central Solomons at [[Kolombangara]] and [[New Georgia]] and prepared to send the reinforcements, mainly consisting of the 51st Infantry Division, originally detailed for Guadalcanal to New Guinea. The [[Seventeenth Army (Japan)|17th Army]] was rebuilt around the [[6th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|6th Infantry Division]] and headquartered on Bougainville. A few Japanese stragglers remained on Guadalcanal, many of whom were killed or captured by Allied patrols. The last known [[Japanese holdout]] surrendered in October 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 596–597, Morison, pp. 370–371, Rottman, pp. 64–65, D'Albas, p. 238, Griffith, pp. 269, 286, Jersey, pp. 400–401, Hayashi, pp. 65–66. Morison and D'Albas say 11,706 were evacuated. Hayashi says 11,083. More recent historical accounts use the 10,652 number. Among the last soldiers evacuated were 264 members of the 28th Infantry Regiment, all that remained of the 1,945 landed in August and September 1942. Of the approximately 4,000 members of the 35th Infantry Brigade landed in August and September 1942, 618 were evacuated during ''Ke''. IJN personnel evacuated numbered 870, the rest were IJA. Jersey says that "hundreds" of stragglers were left behind on Guadalcanal. The Japanese 51st Infantry Division was almost completely wiped out en route to New Guinea during the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]] in March 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

In hindsight, historians have faulted the Americans, especially Patch and Halsey, for not taking advantage of their ground, aerial, and naval superiority to prevent the successful Japanese evacuation of most of their surviving forces from Guadalcanal. Said [[Chester Nimitz]], commander of Allied forces in the Pacific, of the success of Operation Ke, "Until the last moment it appeared that the Japanese were attempting a major reinforcement effort. Only the skill in keeping their plans disguised and bold celerity in carrying them out enabled the Japanese to withdraw the remnants of the Guadalcanal garrison. Not until all organized forces had been evacuated on 8 February did we realize the purpose of their air and naval dispositions."&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, pp. 285–286, Frank, p. 597, Zimmerman, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the successful campaign to recapture Guadalcanal from the Japanese was an important strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies. Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their campaign against Japan, ultimately culminating in Japan's defeat and the end of World {{nowrap|War II}}.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, p. 597, Rottman, p. 64, Miller, pp. 348–350.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paris Fashion Week''' ({{lang-fr|Semaine de la mode de Paris}}) is a series of designer presentations held semiannually in [[Paris]], [[France]] with spring/summer and autumn/winter events held each year. Dates are determined by the [[Fédération française de la couture|French Fashion Federation]]. Paris Fashion Week is held at venues throughout the city. It is widely considered the most prestigious of the Big Four Fashion Weeks. 

In addition to [[ready-to-wear]] shows, there are men's and [[haute couture]] shows, which are held semiannually for the spring/summer and autumn/winter seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modeaparis.com/en/fashion-shows/Schedules/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113182639/http://www.modeaparis.com/en/fashion-shows/Schedules |archivedate=2016-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, every year, famous brands like [[Dior]], [[Chanel]], [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Givenchy]], and Céline host their shows in historical places such as the Carrousel du Louvre and the Grand Palais.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rove.me/to/paris/paris-fashion-week|title=Paris Fashion Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Big 4==
Paris Fashion Week is part of the global "Big 4" [[fashion week]]s, the others being [[London Fashion Week]], [[Milan Fashion Week]] and [[New York Fashion Week]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradford|first1=Julie|title=Fashion Journalism|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2xeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Susan|last=Dillon|title=The Fundamentals of Fashion Management|publisher= A&amp;C Black|year=2011|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XFMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schedule begins with New York, followed by London, and then Milan and ends in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fashionweekonline.com/big4|title=Big 4 Fashion Week Calendar (New York, London, Milan, Paris) {{!}} Fashion Week Online®|work=Fashion Week Online®|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Although the first fashion week was held in New York, the event itself derives from "salon shows" ("défilés de mode" in French, literally "fashion parades") in Paris couture salons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/a10274/history-of-fashion-week/&lt;/ref&gt;

A fashion week consists of a week of organized events of multiple designer’s collections. Before this organized event was recognized in [[New York City]], fashion showings were being held in Paris as early as the 1700s. These early showings were only to clients purchasing items and were shown on mannequins.&lt;ref&gt;Di Boscio, Chere. “Timeline: The History of Haute Couture.” Eluxe Magazine. N.p., 31 Jan. 2015. Web. 5 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1800s, showings began to change. [[Charles Frederick Worth]], noted for [[haute couture]], began showing multiple pieces together and of a higher design. [[Jeanne Paquin]] is the first designer to make her showings public and [[Paul Poiret]] is the first to host parties after his events.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;McConnell, Molli. “Paris Fashion Week: A Guide To The Iconic Event.” The Culture Trip. N.p., n.d. Web. 29 Jan. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1800s Mme [[Pauline von Metternich]], an Austrian Princess and wife to the Ambassador of Paris, saw one of Worth’s sketches and employed him to make her a gown. He gained much recognition through his powerful clients and opened his own haute couture house in Paris in 1858, which sold luxury fashion to upper class women.

==[[Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture]]==
In 1868 the [[Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture]] was created to set the specifications to determine what constituted a ‘couture house’.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;Di Boscio, Chere. “Timeline: The History of Haute Couture.” Eluxe Magazine. 31 Jan. 2015. Web. 5 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The group decided that to be defined a piece of [[haute couture]] the clothing must have been; custom-made to fit the wearer, hand-sewn by multiple skilled artisans in the separate fields of embroidery, stitching, and beading, and only the most high quality of materials may be used.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

==L’Association de Protection des Industries Artistiques Saisonnieres==
Fifty-three years after the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture was created, in 1921 the French press created L’Association de Protection des Industries Artistiques Saisonnieres, or PAIS to protect couture designs from being copied.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; To ensure the copyright of the designers, their creations were photographed on a model or mannequin from the front, back, and sides to catalog the design.

==The first Paris Fashion Week== 
In 1945 the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture established another set of rules to regulate and determine Haute Couture houses.&lt;ref name="Bazaar"/&gt; In order to meet the criteria, the house had to ensure they followed the updated rules with one of them being that in each season, a couture house must present a collection of at least 35 runs with both daytime and evening wear to the Paris press.&lt;ref name=Bazaar&gt;Bazaar UK, Harper’s BAZAAR. “The History of Haute Couture.” Harper’s BAZAAR. N.p., 10 July 2014. Web. 1 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Others included having at least 20 members on staff, and that every design must include fittings and be made-to-order for the clientele.&lt;ref name=Bazaar/&gt; The following biannual events of Haute Couture houses in accordance with the new guidelines set by the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture have been seen as the first pair of fashion weeks in Paris.

==First fashion week under the Fédération Française de la Couture==
The first recognized Paris Fashion Week was held in 1973 and organized Haute Couture, Ready-to-Wear, and Men’s Fashion into one grouped showing by the [[Fédération Française de la Couture]].&lt;ref&gt;“History of Fashion Week.” Fashion Week Online. N.p., n.d. Web. 12 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was a fundraiser held at the [[Palace of Versailles]] to restore the palace. The amount aimed to reach to repair the palace was estimated at $60 million USD which converts to 53,026,956 Euros.&lt;ref name="HighSnob" /&gt; The fundraiser was started because the French government had stated they could not handle the cost of the renovations. It was overseen by the founder of New York Press Week, now known as [[New York Fashion Week]], [[Eleanor Lambert]], in accordance with, the at the time Versailles curator, Gereld van der Kemp.&lt;ref name="Guide" /&gt; The restorations and renovations included [[Marie Antoinette]]’s dressing room, [[Louis XV]]’s children’s play room, and a staircase which began construction in 1722 but was never finished.&lt;ref name="HighSnob"&gt;Banks, Alec. “Paris Fashion Week History.” Highsnobiety. N.p., 2 July 2015. Web. 29 Jan. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both American and Parisian designers attended the event including; [[Anne Klein]], [[Bill Blass]], [[Stephen Burrows]], [[Oscar de la Renta]], [[Hubert de Givenchy]], and [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]].&lt;ref name="HighSnob" /&gt; The French designer’s each held their own showing set to various themes whose pieces included; a rocket ship, pumpkin coach and a rhinoceros pulling a gypsy caravan.

The American designers, due to errors in measurement conversion, collectively held one showing under the common theme of Paris using both Caucasian and African-American models.&lt;ref name="HighSnob" /&gt; The American designers’ use of diversity in models marked the event as the first time African-American models had walked a French runway.&lt;ref name="HighSnob" /&gt;

The event gained much publicity because of the designers involved and is given the nickname "The Battle of Versailles" because of its location and the tension between the American and Parisian designers during the run of the show.&lt;ref name="HighSnob" /&gt;

{{Campaignbox Iraq War}}

The [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] began on March 20. On March 18, US President [[George W. Bush]] had set a deadline for the ruler of [[Iraq]], [[Saddam Hussein]], and his two sons, [[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein|Qusay]], to leave the country or face military action. By the time of the ultimatum, political and military preparations for the invasion were well advanced.  

Plans for securing Iraqi cities following the invasion, infrastructure reconstruction, and transitioning the country into a post-war government – plans to "win the peace" — were either nonexistent or woefully inadequate. The lack of a post-invasion security plan allowed widespread [[looting]] and the violent [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|insurgency]] that immediately followed the invasion. The looting "caused far more damage to Iraq's infrastructure than the bombing campaign" and suggested to the insurgents that the US military was vulnerable. The [[Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction]] wrote, "There was insufficient systematic planning for human capital management in Iraq before and during the U.S.-directed stabilization and reconstruction operations."&lt;ref&gt;Rajiv Chandrasekaran, ''Imperial Life in the Emerald City,'' pages 31 and 46&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Scarborough, Rowan. [http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20060227-102546-2603r.htm "U.S. lacked plan for rebuilding Iraq, report says"]. The Washington Times, February 28, 2006. Retrieved April 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[UK Minister of Defence]] [[Geoff Hoon]] commented on this issue in 2007 and said, "There was an enormous amount of post-war planning. It's one of the things that the newspapers have never troubled to look at. I accept, and I've said so publicly, that we perhaps did not anticipate quite the kinds of trouble that we would have. I think we thought that because the population of Iraq hated Saddam Hussein, they would simply come out on the streets and everything would be fine... I don't think we quite estimated the degree of control that Saddam's people had in Iraqi society... So the kind of things we were planning for, with the benefit of hindsight, perhaps weren't quite the right things. But they were the right things in terms of the problems that we anticipated, which was the lack of food, water. We probably didn't quite appreciate, as I say, the ruthlessness of some of Saddam's [followers]."&lt;ref&gt;Hoon, Geoff. Question and Answer Session at West Nottinghamshire College; November 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military preparations ==
{{main|2003 invasion of Iraq}}

== Political preparations ==

Political preparation for war began in earnest during the period of weapons inspections in Iraq over the winter of 2002–2003, carried out by a team led by [[Hans Blix]] with the authority of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441]]. The U.S. and its principal allies, the United Kingdom, Spain and [[Portugal]], maintained a skeptical position on the results of the inspections procedure.  Under pressure from his Secretary of State, [[Colin Powell]], and his main ally, the UK, President Bush decided to try to obtain UN backing for an invasion. The so-called "second resolution" (the first being 1441) was eventually drafted and presented to the UN Security Council. It was a tough resolution, calling for immediate compliance with the previous resolutions requiring disarmament, and setting a 10-day deadline for compliance. Critics saw it as an unrealistic ultimatum designed to provide the U.S. with a cause for war, and it met considerable opposition in the security council, with opponents including the permanent members France, China, and Germany. After a period of intense diplomacy, President Bush met with his British, Spanish and Portuguese counterparts, Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], Prime Minister [[José María Aznar]] and Prime Minister [[José Manuel Barroso]] in the [[Azores]], Portugal on March 15 and 16. Declaring that "diplomacy had failed," he announced the intention to drop the proposed resolution. Subsequently, both the U.S. and the UK accused France of effectively blocking the negotiations by threatening to veto the proposed resolution "whatever the circumstances", but France maintained that its position had been intentionally misconstrued. Lacking the "second resolution", the U.S. announced its intention to attack Iraq regardless if Saddam Hussein did not abdicate.

The U.S.'s rationale for war depended on several contentions. First, it contended that Iraq was in possession of [[weapons of mass destruction]], which it claimed he might be willing to supply to terrorists. Second, it accused Iraq of supporting terrorism, notably through payments to families of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[suicide bomber]]s. In this way, the U.S. contended, Iraq presented a threat that it would be justified in removing, placing this as a new interpretation of the doctrine of self-defence. Third, it stated that the U.S. was legally justified in taking military action by previous UN resolutions, most notably 1441, which stated that "serious consequences" would result from a failure to disarm on Iraq's part.

A '''procession''' (French ''procession'' via Middle English, derived from Latin, ''processio'', from ''procedere'', to go forth, advance, proceed) is an organized body of people walking in a formal or ceremonial manner.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Procession|volume=22|pages=414–416 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Funeral Procession - 15th Century - Project Gutenberg eText 16531.jpg|thumb|A funeral procession, illustrated in a manuscript of the ''Hours of the Virgin''. Fifteenth century. [[British Museum]], Add. MS. 27697.]]

==History==
[[File:A Royal Procession.jpg|thumb|A Royal Procession]]
Processions have in all peoples and at all times been a natural form of public celebration, as forming an orderly and impressive ceremony. Religious and triumphal processions are abundantly illustrated by ancient monuments, e.g. the religious processions of Egypt, those illustrated by the rock-carvings of [[Hattusa|Boghaz-Keui]], the many representations of processions in Greek art, culminating in the great Panathenaic procession of the [[Parthenon Frieze]], and Roman triumphal reliefs, such as those of the [[arch of Titus]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Greco-Roman practice===
Processions played a prominent part in the great festivals of Greece, where they were always religious in character. The games were either opened or accompanied by more or less elaborate processions and sacrifices, while processions from the earliest times formed part of the worship of the old nature gods, as those connected with the [[cult of Dionysus]] and the [[Phallic processions]], and later formed an essential part of the celebration of the great religious festivals (e.g. the processions of the [[Thesmophoria]], and that of the [[Great Dionysia]]), and of the mysteries (e.g. the great procession from Athens to Eleusis, in connection with the [[Eleusinia]]).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Of the Roman processions, the most prominent was that of the [[Roman triumph|Triumph]], which had its origin in the return of the victorious army headed by the general, who proceeded in great pomp from the Campus to the Capitol to offer sacrifice, accompanied by the army, captives, spoils, the chief magistrate, priests bearing the images of the gods, amidst strewing of flowers, burning of incense and the like ([[Ovid]], ''Trist.'' iv. 2, 3 and 6). Connected with the triumph was the ''[[pompa circensis]]'', &lt;!--forthcoming article; please remove this note when link is blue--&gt;or solemn procession that preceded the games in the circus. It first came into use at the ''[[Ludi Romani]]'', when the games were preceded by a great procession from the Capitol to the Circus. The [[praetor]] or [[consul]] who appeared in the ponipa circensis wore the robes of a triumphing general (see Mommsen, Staatsrec/zt I. 397 for the connection of the triumph with the ''[[ludi]]''). Thus, when it became customary for the consul to celebrate games at the opening of the consular year, he came, under the empire, to appear in triumphal robes in the processus consularis, or procession of the consul to the Capitol to sacrifice to Jupiter.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Christian practice===
[[File:Stuttgart 2009 040 (RaBoe).jpg|thumb|Christian Easter [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] procession in Stuttgart, Germany (detail)]]
[[File:Carretería.jpg|thumb|Christian Easter procession in Malaga, Spain]]

After the ascendency of Christianity in the [[Roman Empire]], the consular processions in [[Constantinople]] retained their religious character, now proceeding to [[Hagia Sophia]], where prayers and offerings were made; but in Rome, where Christianity was not so widely spread among the upper classes, at first the tendency was to convert the procession into a purely civil function, omitting the pagan rites and prayers, without substituting Christian ones&lt;ref&gt;Daremberg and Saglio, ''[[Dictionnaire des Antiquités Grecques et Romaines]]'', s.v. Consul.&lt;/ref&gt; Only after Theodosius did the processions become a religious event, replete with icons, crosses, and banners. There were other local processions connected with the primitive worship of the country people, which remained unchanged, but they were eventually overshadowed by the popular piety of the [[Early Church|Church]]. Such were those of the [[Ambarvalia]], [[Robigalia]], which were essentially rustic festivals, [[lustration]]s of the fields, consisting in a procession round the spot to be purified, leading the sacrificial victims with prayers, hymns, and ceremonies to protect the young crops from evil influence.&lt;ref&gt;See Preller, Rm. Mythologie, pp. 370-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tertullian]] (2nd century) uses ''processio'' and ''procedere'' in the sense of to go out, appear in public, and, as applied to a church function, ''processio'' was first used in the same way as ''collecta'', i.e. for the assembly of the people in a church.&lt;ref&gt;[[Du Cange]], s.v.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense it appears to be used by [[Pope Leo I]],&lt;ref&gt;Ep. IX. ad Diosc. episc. c. 445: ''qui nostris processionibus et ordinationibus frequenter interfuit''.&lt;/ref&gt; while in the version by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] of the 17th canon of the [[Council of Laodicea]] (about 363–364) {{lang-grc|σονάξεσι}}, is translated by ''processionibus''.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Dic. of Class. Antiq. s.v. Procession.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the processions that formed part of the ritual of the [[Catholic Mass|Eucharist]], those of the introit, the gospel and the oblation, the earliest records date from the 6th century and even later,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Louis Duchesne]], ''Origines'', 2nd ed., pp. 77, 154, 181; 78, 194.&lt;/ref&gt; but they evidently were established at a much earlier date. As to public processions, these seem to have come into rapid vogue after the recognition of Christianity as the religion of the empire. Those at [[Jerusalem]] would seem to have been long established when described by the author of the ''[[Egeria (pilgrim)|Peregrinatio Sylviae]]'' towards the end of the 4th century.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Very early were the processions accompanied by hymns and prayers, known as ''[[litaniae]]'', ''[[rogationes]]'' or ''[[supplicationes]]''. It is to such a procession that reference appears to be made in a letter of [[St Basil]],&lt;ref&gt;c. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; which would thus be the first recorded mention of a public Christian procession. The first mention for the Western Church occurs in [[St Ambrose]].&lt;ref&gt;c. 388, Ep. 40 16, Ad Theodos. ''monachos ... qui psalmos canentes ex consuetudine usuque veteri pergebant ad celebritatem Machabaeorum martyrum''.&lt;/ref&gt; In both these cases the litanies are stated to have been long in use. There is also mention of a procession accompanied by hymns, organized at Constantinople by [[St John Chrysostom]] (c. 390-400) in opposition to a procession of [[Arianism|Arians]], in [[Sozomen]].&lt;ref&gt;Hist. eccl. viii. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In times of calamity litanies were held, in which the people walked in robes of penitence, fasting, barefooted, and, in later times, frequently dressed in black (''litaniae nigrae''). The cross was carried at the head of the procession and often the gospel and the relics of the saint were carried. [[Gregory of Tours]] gives numerous instances of such litanies in time of calamity; thus he describes&lt;ref&gt;Vita S. Remig. I.&lt;/ref&gt; a procession of the clergy and people round the city, in which relics of [[St Remigius]] were carried and litanies chanted in order to avert the plague. So, too, [[Gregory the Great]]&lt;ref&gt;Ep. xi. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; writes to the Sicilian bishops to hold processions to prevent a threatened invasion of Sicily. A famous instance of these penitential litanies is the ''litania septiformis'' ordered by Gregory the Great in the year 590, when Rome had been inundated and pestilence had followed.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In this litany seven processions, of clergy, laymen, monks, nuns, matrons, the poor, and children respectively, starting from seven different churches, proceeding to hear mass at [[St. Maria Maggiore]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Gregory of Tours]], Hist. Fr. x. i, and Johann. Diac. Vita Greg. Magn. i. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; This litany has often been confused with the ''litania major'', introduced at Rome in 598 (vide supra), but is quite distinct from it. Funeral processions, accompanied with singing and the carrying of lighted tapers, were very early customary (see [[ceremonial use of lights]]), and akin to these, also very early, were the processions connected with the translation of the relics of martyrs from their original burying place to the church where they were to be enshrined.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. St Ambrose, Ep. 29 and St Augustine, De civitate Dei, xxii. 8 and Conf. viii. 7, for the finding and translation of the relics of Saints [[Gervasius and Protasius]].&lt;/ref&gt; From the time of the [[emperor Constantine I]] these processions were of great magnificence.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Some liturgists maintain that the early Church in its processions followed Old Testament precedents, quoting such cases as the procession of the [[ark of the covenant|ark]] round the walls of Jericho,&lt;ref&gt;Josh. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; the procession of David with the ark,&lt;ref&gt;2 Sam. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; the processions of thanksgiving on the return from captivity, &amp;c. The liturgy of the early Church as Duchesne shows&lt;ref&gt;Origines, ch. i.&lt;/ref&gt; was influenced by that of the Jewish synagogue, but the theory that the Church's processions were directly related to the Old Testament ritual is of late origin.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Festivals involving processions were adopted by the Christian Church from the pagan calendar of Rome. The ''litaniae majores et minores'', which are stated by [[Hermann Usener]]&lt;ref&gt;''Alte Bittgange'', in Zeller, ''Philosophische Aufsatze'', p. 278 seq.&lt;/ref&gt; to have been first instituted by [[Pope Liberius]] (352-366). It is generally acknowledged that they are the equivalent of the Christian Church of the Roman lustrations of the crops in spring, the [[Ambarvalia]], &amp;c. The ''litania major'', or great procession on St Mark's day (April 25) is shown to coincide both in date and ritual with the Roman [[Robigalia]], which took place ad. vii. Kal. Mai., and consisted in a procession leaving Rome by the [[Flaminian gate]], and proceeding by way of the [[Milvian bridge]] to a sanctuary at the 5th milestone of the [[Via Claudia]], where the flamen quirinalis sacrificed a dog and a sheep to avert blight (robigo) from the crops.&lt;ref&gt;Fasti praenestini, C.T.L.T., p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; The litania major followed the same route as far as the Milvian bridge, when it turned off and returned to St Peter's, where mass was celebrated. This was already established as an annual festival by 598, as is shown by a document of [[Gregory the Great]]&lt;ref&gt;Regist. ii.&lt;/ref&gt; that inculcates the duty of celebrating litaniam, quae major ab omnibus appellatur. The ''litaniae minores'' or [[rogation]]s, held on the three days preceding [[Ascension Day]], were first introduced into Gaul by Bishop [[Mamertus of Vienne]] (c. 470), and made binding for all Gaul by the [[First Council of Orleans]] (511). The litaniae minores were also adopted for these three days in Rome by [[Pope Leo III]] (c. 800).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

A description of the institution and character of the Ascensiontide rogations is given by [[Sidonius Apollinaris]].&lt;ref&gt;Ep. v. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The solemnity of these, he says, was first established by Mamertus. Hitherto they had been erratic, lukewarm, and poorly attended (vagae, tepentes, infrequentesque). Those he instituted were characterized by fasting, prayers, psalms, and tears. In the Ambrosian rite the rogations take place after [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]], and in the Spanish on the Thursday to Saturday after [[Whitsuntide]], and in November ([[Synod of Girona]], 517).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Imperial China===
[[Dream of the Red Chamber|The Story of the Stone]], written in the 18th century, contains a description of the procession accompanying an Imperial Concubine:
{{quote|&lt;center&gt;
Presently a faint sound of music was heard and the Imperial Concubine's procession at last came in sight.
First came several pairs of [[eunuch]]s carrying embroidered banners.
Then several more pairs with [[ceremony|ceremonial]] pheasant-feather fans.
Then eunuchs swinging gold-inlaid censers in which special 'palace [[incense]]' was burning.
Next came a great gold-coloured 'seven phoenix' [[umbrella]] of state, hanging from its curve-topped shaft life a great drooping bell-flower.  In its shadow was borne the Imperial Concubine's travelling wardrobe: her head-dress, robe, sash and shoes. 
Eunuch gentlemen-in-waiting followed carrying her rosary, her embroidered handkerchief, her spittoon, her fly-whisk, and various other items.
Last of all, when this army of attendants had gone by, a great gold-topped [[Litter (vehicle)|palanquin]] with phoenixes embroidered on its yellow curtains slowly advanced on the shoulders of eight eunuch bearers.&lt;ref&gt;The Story of the Stone by Cao Xuequin, translated by David Hawkes, published by Penguin Books, 1973.  Volume I, page 356&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==Procession elements==
[[File:TÜRKA XIX üldlaulupeo rongkäigus 01.JPG|thumb|Preparations for [[Estonian Song Festival]] procession by [[University of Tartu Folk Art Ensemble]]. Over 42 000 persons participated in that procession in 2014.]]
Many elements may be used to make a procession more significant than just "people walking in the same direction":

* A special '''mode of transport''', such as a ceremonial [[barge]], elephant [[howdah]], horse-drawn [[carriage]], or a [[Litter (vehicle)|palanquin]] carried on the shoulders of others. [[Cleopatra]]'s arrival to seduce [[Mark Antony]] on a perfumed barge has taken on legendary proportion. African kings sometimes ride in palanquins carved to look like luxury cars or other [[status symbol]]s, while Muslim brides travel in camel howdahs as shown in ''Bride Arriving in a Village, Biskra, [[Algeria]]'' by [[Philippe Pavy]]. The [[Pope]] has traditionally been carried in a special [[sedan chair]] known as the [[sedia gestatoria]]. In humbler terms, a [[mayor]], [[grand marshal]], or fair "queen" of a local parade will often ride in the town's fanciest [[automobile]].
* '''Music''', including everything from the [[choir]] of a church procession to the [[marching band]] of a military procession. Criers may march before the procession, yelling to clear the way for it. Some high school [[homecoming]] parades include trucks filled with people who do nothing but make as much noise as possible.
* '''Order of precedence''': even without showy display, a group of people walking forward may be said to form a procession if their order and placement clearly visualize a hierarchy or symbiotic relationship. For instance, one's nearness to the king or others of high rank had important political connotations when the royal family walked to or from chapel services at the [[palace of Versailles]]. Similarly, precedence came into play when the grandest [[Edwardian]] parties progressed from the sitting room to the dining room, and the stylized movement and hierarchy of marching military units clearly sets up a formal procession.
* '''Bearers''' of [[banner]]s, fans, [[icon]]s, treasure, or other eye-catching items, or leading exotic animals. This was a very important part of [[Roman triumph]]s, as booty gave the Roman populace visual proof of the warrior's success. The most elaborate evolution of this is the spectacular [[Float (parade)|float]]s of [[Carnival]] [[parade]]s. A simpler example is the [[ring bearer]] at a wedding.
* '''Scent''', provided by flower bearers or censers of [[incense]].
* '''Skilled performers''', such as acrobats or dancers
* Special '''costume''': traditionally, the costumes of [[acolyte]]s, [[footmen]], [[ceremonial guards]], or slaves help show off the wealth of the person staging a procession. An ornate example was the embroidered [[train]] of [[George IV of the United Kingdom]], carried at his coronation by nine lords in waiting with their own matching silken clothes, capes, ruffs, and plumed hats. Other examples include the [[Swiss Guard]] and high vestments of the Pope. The formal, matching clothes of bridesmaids and groomsmen are in the same tradition, although sometimes purchased at the attendant's expense rather than by the people honored in the ceremony. In egalitarian times and places, whoever has taken the time and money to put together something impressive may appear in a parade; such costumes are of course the focal point of [[Halloween]] parades such as that staged in [[Greenwich Village]], New York. Finally, processions may be staged simply to show off the costumes as one part of a larger event, such as at fashion pageants, military reenactments, pop concerts, or Renaissance Festivals.
* Special '''lighting''': [[candlelight vigil]]s for the deceased or to show political solidarity often include a candlelit procession. [[Fireworks]] illuminate such diverse events as coronations, parades, and Thai royal barge processions.
* '''Spectacle''', such as an aircraft [[flypast|flyover]], or the confetti of New York [[ticker tape parade]]s
* '''The dispensing of gifts''', at one time often food or money. Today, most people are familiar with the dispensing of beads at [[Mardi Gras]] and the throwing of candy at local fair parades.

==Functions of processions==

===Advertisement===
[[File:060611 Mons (20).JPG|thumb|upright|The Petit Doudou actors in the procession of the Golden Car in [[Mons]] ([[Belgium]])]]
[[Edo period|Edo-period]] documenters enjoyed drawing the processions of [[Red light districts|pleasure district]] beauties, such as ''Courtesan Parading With Attendants'' by [[Suzuki Harunobu]]. Similar parading courtesans feature in ''Cherry Blossom in the Evening on the Nakanomachi in Yoshiwara'' by [[Utagawa Hiroshige]] and ''True Scenery of the Gay Quarter of Minatozakimachi Shinminato'' by [[Utagawa Sadahide]]. The [[Lord Mayor's Show]] in [[London]] has long featured displays by the city's official trade guilds. Parades were at one time important advertisement when a traveling [[circus]] arrived in a new town. Today, many parades in the United States are sponsored by department stores, such as [[Macy's]], which expect the public spectacle to lure shoppers to the store.

===Change in government===
The ''Reception of the Ambassadors From Siam at the [[Château de Fontainebleau]]'' was one such example, documented by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] in 1864. The signing of surrender by Japanese diplomats and soldiers aboard an American [[battle ship]] at the end of [[World War II]] involved a strictly codified procession on and off the ship.[[File:14th Century Medieval Chariot.jpg|thumb|Royal procession, design from the 14th century.|110px]] Processions play an important role in coronations, such as that of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] in 1953, the [[Shah]] of [[Iran]] in 1967, [[Otumfuo Osei Tutu II]] of the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] in 1999, and [[Norodom Sihamoni]] of [[Cambodia]] in 2004.

===Display of power===
Such as ancient Roman triumphs, the [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] processions of [[India]], and modern reviewing of the troops by generals and heads of state. ''Return From Vienna'', a painting by [[Jozef Brandt]], shows war booty taken from the Turks being escorted into eastern [[Europe]] by soldiers.

===Entertainment===
Some processions are arranged for [[entertainment]], purely for [[fun]], such as those of community organizations and friendly societies, so popular in [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States of America]].

===Solidarity===
Religious ceremonies have since prehistory employed the procession of holy objects to inspire solidarity of belief. The [[Doge of Venice|Doges of Venice]] once staged elaborate [[barge]] processions to bless the waters on which Venice's tightly controlled maritime economy depended. Symbolic processions were an important tool in the non-violent protest of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Marches on political capitals often include formal processions. [[Gay Pride]] parades also started with this basis in [[New York City]].

===Events===

Processions used to mark the '''beginning or end of an event''', such as parades at the beginning of [[county fairs]] or at the [[Olympic Games]], or processions that begin and end [[funeral]]s, [[graduation]]s, and [[wedding]]s.

Processions are found in almost every form of religious worship, such as [[Holy Week]] processions. Some biblical examples were the processions with the [[Ark of Covenant]] and the procession of [[Jesus on a donkey]] into Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Processions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a narrower sense of going forth, proceeding, the term is used in the technical language of [[theology]] in the phrase Procession of the [[Holy Ghost]], expressing the relation of the Third Person in the Triune Godhead to the Father and the Son.

It is impossible to describe in detail the vast development of processions during the [[Middle Ages]]. The most important and characteristic of these still have a place in the ritual of the [[Catholic Church]], as well as those of the [[Church of England]] and the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]].

The '''Procession Path''' (Lat. ''ambitus templi'') is the route taken by processions on solemn days in large churches—up the north aisle, round behind the high altar, down the south aisle, and then up the centre of the nave.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Procession Path |volume=22 |page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Orthodox===

====Outdoors====

Typically the procession commences with the phanarion (a lantern) followed by the cross,&lt;ref group=note&gt;For which reason this is called in {{lang-ru|Крестный ход}}, ''Krestnyi khod'', ''cross procession''&lt;/ref&gt; flanked by processional [[Khorugv|banners]] and [[icons]], then choir and clergy, the deacons with [[Thurible#Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Usage|censers]], the priests with [[icon]]s, and then the faithful. Hymns particular to the event are sung. Typically the outside of the church is circled thrice; however, some processions proceed to a designated place where a ceremony, ''e.g.'', a baptism or burial, is performed.

*Well-known processions prescribed annually include:
**'''[[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter)''' &amp;mdash; During the [[Easter Vigil|Paschal Vigil]] at midnight on Easter Sunday.
**[[Easter Week|'''Bright Week''']] Each day following at the end of the [[Divine Liturgy]], when the [[Artos]] is carried and the paschal [[Canon (hymnography)|canon]] is sung.
**[[Holy Saturday|'''Great Saturday''']] With the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|epitaphios]] carried around the church thrice, as at a priest's funeral, the choir singing the [[Trisagion]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;In some traditions, a procession takes place on [[Palm Sunday]] as well.&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''[[Epiphany (holiday)|Theophany]]''' &amp;mdash; When the [[Holy water#Blessing of holy water at Theophany|Great Blessing of Waters]] is at a body of water or an external [[baptistry]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;A similar procession takes place sundry other times when the [[Lesser Blessing of Waters]] is performed.&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''[[Paraklesis]]''' &amp;mdash; Often on the [[Patron Saint|patronal feast]] of a church, a procession around the outside of the church in conjunction with the paraklesis (prayer of intercession) to the church's namesake
** [[Lity (Orthodox Vespers)|'''Lity''']] &amp;mdash; May be held outdoors with a procession
** [[Holy Thursday#Local customs|'''Great Thursday''' &amp;mdash; Sundry local customs]]
*Well-known processions for occasional events include:
**'''[[Funeral]]''' &amp;mdash; The coffin is carried to the grave accompanied by singing of the [[Trisagion]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;If the deceased is a [[priest]] or [[bishop]] the clergy chant the [[Andrew of Crete|Great Canon of St. Andrew]]&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Consecrations in Eastern Christianity#Consecration of a church|'''Consecration of a church''']] &amp;mdash; The relics to be placed in the altar are, after an [[all-night vigil]], carried in solemn procession to a nearby church, placed on the altar for an early divine liturgy, and then carried in solemn procession back to the church being consecrated.&lt;ref name="GBN"&gt;{{Citation |year=2000 |publication-date=2000 |title=The Great Book of Needs: Expanded and Supplemented (Volume 2): The Sanctification of the Temple and other Ecclesiastical and Liturgical Blessings |pages=57 |place=[[South Canaan Township, Pennsylvania|South Canaan, Pennsylvania]] |publisher=[[Saint Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary|Saint Tikhon's Seminary Press]] |isbn=1-878997-56-4 |url=http://www.stspress.com/products-page/service-books/great-book-of-needs-vol-2/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholics===
For the Roman Catholic Church, the rules governing them are laid down in the [[Rituale Romanum]] (Tit. ix.), and they are classified in the following way:

# ''Processiones generales'', in which the whole body of the clergy takes part.
# ''Processiones ordinariae'', on yearly festivals, such as the feast of the [[Purification of the Virgin]] ([[Candlemas]]), the procession on [[Palm Sunday]] or [[Holy Week]], the ''[[Litaniae]] Majores'' and ''Minores'', the [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Feast of Corpus Christi]], [[Forty Hours' Devotion]] and on other days, according to the custom of the churches.
# Processiones extraordinariae, or processions ordered on special occasions, e.g. to pray for rain or fine weather; in time of storm, famine, plague, war, or, in ''quacumque tribulatione''; processions of thanksgiving; [[Translation (relic)|translation]] of [[relics]]; or the dedication of a church or a cemetery.

There are also processions of honor, for instance to meet a royal personage, or the [[bishop]] on his first entry into his [[diocese]] (Pontif. Tom. iii.).

Those taking part in processions are to walk bare-headed (weather permitting), two and two, in decent costume, and with reverent mien; clergy and laity, men and women, are to walk separately. The cross is carried at the head of the procession, and banners embroidered with sacred pictures in places where this is customary; these banners must not be of military or triangular shape. [[Violet (color)|Violet]] is the [[liturgical colours|prescribed colour]] for processions, except on Corpus Christi, or on a day when some other colour is mandated. The officiating priest wears a [[cope]], or at least a [[surplice]] with a violet stole, while other priests and clergy wear surplices.

Where the [[Sacramental bread#Catholic Church|Host]] is carried in procession (often encased in a [[monstrance]]), it is covered always by a canopy, and accompanied by lights. At the ''litaniae majores'' and ''minores'' and other penitential processions, joyful hymns are not allowed, but the litanies are sung, and, if the length of the procession requires, the penitential and [[gradual psalms]]. As to the discipline regarding processions the bishop, according to the [[Council of Trent]] (Sess. 25 de reg. cap. 6), appoints and regulates processions and public prayers outside the churches.

The observance or variation of the discipline belongs to the [[Congregation of Rites]]; in pontifical processions, which are regulated by the masters of the ceremonies (''magistri ceremoniarum pontificalium''), these points are decided by the chief cardinal deacon. As to processions within the churches, some difference of opinion having arisen as to the regulating authority, the Congregation of Rites has decided that the bishop must ask, though not necessarily follow, the advice of the chapter in their regulation.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Reformed churches===
[[File:Walsinghamprocession.jpg|thumb|Procession with the statue of the Blessed Virgin, Anglican National Pilgrimage at [[Walsingham]], 2003]]
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] abolished in all Protestant countries those processions associated with the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] (Corpus Christi); the [[Eucharist|Sacrament of the Lord's Supper]], according to the 28th [[Thirty-nine Articles|Article of Religion]] of the Church of England was not by Christ's ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshiped. It also abolished those associated with the cult of the Blessed Virgin and the saints. The stern simplicity of [[Calvinism]], indeed, would not tolerate religious processions of any kind, and from the Reformed Churches they vanished altogether. The more conservative temper of the Anglican and Lutheran communions, however, suffered the retention of such processions as did not conflict with the reformed doctrines, though even in these Churches they met with opposition and tended after a while to fall into disuse.

Liturgical processions were revived in the Church of England by the members of the [[Oxford Movement]] during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cutts, E. L. (1895) ''A Dictionary of the Church of England''; 3rd ed. London: S. P. C. K.; p. 482&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Ritual Notes'', an Anglo-Catholic liturgical manual, it is stated that "A solemn procession as part of the ceremony proper to the occasion, is ordered to be held respectively at Candlemas; on Palm Sunday; at the Rogations (i.e. on April 25th and the three days preceding Ascension); and on Corpus Christi ..." "A procession is a distinct act of worship in itself, though it is desirable (and accords with ancient practice) that it should have a definite purpose, such as to commemorate some notable event, or to honour the Blessed Sacrament".&lt;ref&gt;Cairncross, Henry, et al., comps. (1935) ''Ritual Notes''; 8th ed. London: W. Knott; p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lutheran]] practice has varied at different times and in different countries. Thus, according to the [[Württemberg]] Kirchenordnung of 1553, a funeral procession was prescribed, the bier being followed by the congregation singing hymns; the Brandenburg Kirchenordnung (1540) directed a cross-bearer to precede the procession and lighted candles to be carried, and this was prescribed also by the Waldeck Kirchenordnung of 1556. At present funeral processions survive in general only in the country districts; the processional cross or crucifix is still carried. In some provinces also the Lutheran Church has retained the ancient rogation processions in the week before Whitsuntide and, in some cases, in the month of May or on special occasions (e.g. days of humiliation, Busstage), processions about the fields to ask a blessing on the crops. On these occasions the ancient litanies are still used.

==Processions in art==
[[File:WLA lacma West Bengal Vase with Processional Scenes ca 100 BC.jpg|thumb|150px|Vase with Processional Scenes, [[West Bengal]]/[[Chandraketugarh]], circa 100 BC]]
The wealth of display associated with processions makes them a rich subject for literary and visual [[art]]. Some examples include:
* Processions were popular subjects for the [[romanticism|Romantic]] painters of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Fantastical [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] was the subject of ''Sleigh Ride'' by [[Wenig]]. ''Spring'', a painting by [[Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], displays a romanticized Roman procession, while his ''[[The Finding of Moses (Alma-Tadema painting)|Finding of Moses]]'' shows an heiress of the Pharaoh proceeding to the palace with her [[wikt:entourage|entourage]]. The exotic ''Queen of Sheba's Visit to King Solomon'' by [[Edward Poynter]] touches on a longstanding convention of elaborate processions from "the East". [[Walter Crane]] depicted Beauty being escorted by wigged monkeys in his 1874 ''Beauty and the Beast''.
* the opera ''[[Aida]]'' is known for its triumphal procession. The first staging included a live elephant on stage.
* the processions of [[Tarkhaan]]s and Tarkheenas are emblematic of Tashbaan's wealth and glamour in the book [[The Horse and His Boy]] by [[C. S. Lewis]]

===In film===
* elaborate Chinese [[wedding]] processions feature in the films ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' and ''[[The Last Emperor]]''
* in the film ''[[Pillow Book]]'', the [[heroine]] compares her wedding procession with the procession of a [[Heian Period]] empress. In another film by the same director, [[Peter Greenaway]], the act of [[Prospero]] simply walking through his house becomes a lush, visual procession because of the house's wealth of literary and visual symbolism.
* the Buddha discovers [[death]], old age, and [[poverty]] while watching an elaborate procession in the film ''[[Little Buddha]]''
* the Nazi entourage in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', upon arriving at their island base, begin an elaborate trek to the centre of the island, with soldiers holding aloft National Socialist standards. The procession is somewhat ostentatious given the climate, prompting the black-dressed Gestapo agent to remove his hat and wipe the sweat from his brow.
* the film ''[[Jefferson in Paris]]'' includes a scene during which [[Thomas Jefferson]] and his daughter watch one of the daily processions that make up the royal ritual at Versailles
[[File:Funeral Elisabeth.jpg|thumb|Illustration of part of the funeral procession of Queen Elizabeth I]]
* the funeral procession of [[Elizabeth I of England]] is portrayed in the film ''[[Orlando (film)|Orlando]]''
* the triumphal procession of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] and [[Paris]] into [[Troy]] begins the 2004 film of the same name
* a spectacular procession introduces Prince Akeem's appointed bride in the film ''[[Coming to America]]''

;Fantasy
* a utopian parade is depicted by [[James Gurney]] in his ''Dinosaur Parade''
* Processions appear in several ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, including award ceremonies at the end of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'', a funeral procession at the end of ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'', and a military procession during ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''
* the god [[Ra]] appears in a formal procession shortly before being overthrown in the film ''[[Stargate]]''
* the procession of [[Audrey Hepburn]] as an Italian [[princess]] set up the dilemma of her [[fictional character|character]] at the beginning of the film ''[[Roman Holiday (1953 film)|Roman Holiday]]''
* the procession of Prince Ali in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' allows the hero to show off his newfound prestige
* the procession of the wicked [[Skeksis]] into their regeneration chamber, and the following procession of their spiritual counterparts, the Mystics, marks the climax of the film ''[[Dark Crystal]]''

'''Production car racing''', showroom stock racing, street Stock,  pure stock, and U-car racing are all categories of [[auto racing]] where unmodified (or very lightly modified) production cars race each other, outright and also in classes.  

Cars usually have a protective [[roll cage]] and run race tires (either [[slick tire|slick]]s or [[radial tire|radials]]).  Some freedoms are allowed, like [[gearbox]] coolers, giving the cars increased performance and components longevity. Production car racing, known in the US as "showroom stock", is an economical and rules restricted version of touring car racing.

Many production racing categories are based on particular makes of cars. There are many [[Porsche]] and [[Audi]] racing series around the world.  These are also called "one make series".  Some series use a handicapped start, where the smaller cars are released up to 45 seconds ahead of the larger cars, and are slowly caught, the idea being that all the cars are together at the finish of the race. Many series follow the [[group N]] regulation with a few exceptions. There are several different series that have run all over the world, most notably, Japan's Super Taikyu and [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]]'s Firehawk Series which ran between the 1980s to 1990s all over the United States.

Major races include the [[Bathurst 6 Hour]], Bahrain 24 Hour, Dubai 24 Hour and Malaysian 12 Hour and sanctioned by organisations such as the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] and [[SCCA]]. Normally using an entry level formula, it has grown into a stand-alone series, with national, state and club events and championships. The first NASCAR "strictly stock" race was held at [[Charlotte Speedway]], on June 19, 1949. Where a racing class requires that the cars raced be production vehicles only slightly adapted for racing, manufacturers typically produce a limited run of such vehicles for public sale so that they can legitimately race them in the class.  These cars are commonly called "homologation specials".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rallycars.com/Cars/Homologation.html www.rallycars.com], Homologation Specials.&lt;/ref&gt;

In British [[oval racing]], the term "production car racing" has been used as an alternative for [[hot rod]]s, as run in the West Country during the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, and a production car world championship race was held twice in the 1970s, won by [[Spence Morgan]] in 1974 and [[Ralph Sanders]] in 1975, both driving [[Ford Anglia]]s.  The West Country production cars were later reclassified as hot rods to come in line with the country's other promoters although this causes some confusion with the history of the West country racing as there was another class called hot rods that ran on those tracks.

The '''ROKS ''Cheonan'' sinking''' occurred on 26 March 2010, when {{ship|ROKS|Cheonan|PCC-772|2}}, a {{sclass-|Pohang|corvette}} of the [[Republic of Korea Navy]], carrying 104 personnel, sank off the country's west coast near [[Baengnyeong Island]] in the [[Yellow Sea]], killing 46 seamen. The cause of the sinking remains in dispute, although overwhelming evidence points to North Korea.

A South Korean-led official investigation carried out by a team of international experts from South Korea, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Sweden&lt;ref name="UN-S/2010/281" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ROKMOD-report-592 /&gt; presented a summary of its investigation on 20 May 2010, concluding that the warship had been sunk by a [[North Korea]]n [[torpedo]]&lt;ref name="dailynk1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&amp;num=6392|title=Results Confirm North Korea Sank ''Cheonan''|publisher=Daily NK|accessdate=20 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522235650/http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&amp;num=6392|archivedate=22 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article7131533.ece|title='All out war' threatened over North Korea attack on warship ''Cheonan''|work=The Times|location=London|date=20 May 2010|accessdate=25 May 2010|first=Anne|last=Barrowclough}}&lt;/ref&gt; fired by a [[midget submarine]].&lt;ref name=yono/&gt;  The conclusions of the report resulted in significant controversy within South Korea.

==Background==
[[File:ROKS Cheonan sinking, location map.svg|thumb|right|The location of the sinking.]]
{{Main article|North Korea&amp;nbsp;– South Korea relations}}
[[Baengnyeong Island]] is a [[South Korea]]n island in the [[Yellow Sea]], off the [[Ongjin, South Hwanghae|Ongjin]] peninsula in [[North Korea]]. It lies less than {{convert|10|mi|km}} from the North Korean coast, and is over {{convert|100|mi|km}} from the South Korean mainland. The island is to the south and west of the [[Northern Limit Line]], the ''de facto'' [[maritime boundary]] dividing South Korea (ROK) from [[North Korea]] (DPRK).

The broader point is that the maritime demarcation line here is NOT a formal extension of the Military Demarcation Line; compare [http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200211/21/eng20021121_107188.shtml "NLL—Controversial Sea Border Between S.Korea, DPRK, "] ''People's Daily'' (PRC), 21 November 2002; retrieved 22 Dec 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The locations of specific islands are reflected in the configuration of each maritime boundary, including
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;1–[[Yeonpyeong Island]]&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dd&gt;2–[[Baengnyeong Island]]&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dd&gt;3–[[Daecheong Island]]&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;

The area is the site of considerable tension between the two states; although it was provided in the [[armistice]] agreement for the [[stalemate]] of the [[Korean war]] that the islands themselves belonged to the South, the sea boundary was not covered by the [[armistice]], and the sea is claimed by the North.

The situation is further complicated by the presence of a rich fishing ground used by DPRK and Chinese fishing vessels, and there have been [[Northern Limit Line#Incidents along the line|numerous clashes]] over the years between naval vessels from both sides attempting to police what both sides regard as their [[territorial waters]]. These have been referred to as "[[Northern Limit Line#Incidents along the line|crab wars]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/nll.htm|title=Northern Limit Line (NLL) West Sea Naval Engagements|publisher=globalsecurity.org|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of ship sinkings on both sides===
In late May 2010, [[Bruce Cumings]], a [[University of Chicago]] expert on Korean affairs, commented that the sinking should be regarded as part of long-running tensions in a naval [["no-man's land"|no-man's land]].&lt;ref name="dn" /&gt; He noted a [[Battle of Daecheong|confrontation in November 2009]] in which several North Korean sailors died, and an incident in 1999 when 30 North Koreans were killed and 70 wounded when their ship sank.&lt;ref name="dn" /&gt;

In both incidents, the North Koreans were the first to open fire.&lt;ref name="dn" /&gt;  In the 1999 incident the South Koreans escalated matters by initiating a campaign of boat 'bumping' in order to stop what the South saw as a violation of its maritime borders. Considering these previous incidents, Cumings said that the ''Cheonan'' sinking was "ripped out of context, the context of a continuing war that has never ended."&lt;ref name="dn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/5/27/nk|title=Historian Bruce Cumings: US Stance on Korea Ignores Tensions Rooted in 65-Year-Old Conflict; North Korea Sinking Could Be Response to November '09 South Korea Attack|publisher=Democracy Now!|date=27 May 2010|accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military concerns===
General [[Walter Sharp]], Commander of the South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command at the time had, on 24 March, testified before the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|US House Appropriations Committee]], in part, on the need to strengthen the ROK-U.S. alliance, the need for on-site advanced training of the Air Force, the need to improve the quality of life and provide tour normalization for troops serving one-year tours, planned relocation of bases, and the scheduled 2012 transition of Operational Control (OPCON) to ROK hands. He also warned of the possibility that North Korea could "even launch an attack on the ROK."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/olc/docs/testSharp04082011.pdf|title=See p. 12, STATEMENT OF GENERAL WALTER L.

On 30 March 2010 it was reported that one South Korean naval diver (ROKN UDT/SEAL CWO Han Ju-ho) had died after losing consciousness while searching for survivors, and another had been hospitalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8594226.stm|title=Diver dies at South Korean warship rescue site|date=30 March 2010|work=BBC News|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 April 2010, South Korean officials said that a private fishing boat involved in the rescue operations had collided with a [[Cambodia]]n freighter, sinking the fishing boat and killing at least two people, with seven reported missing.&lt;ref name=AP-20100403 /&gt; The same day, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea said that the body of one of the 46 missing sailors had been found.&lt;ref name=AP-20100403 /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC fishing boat"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8601540.stm|title=Nine missing as S Korean boat sinks in warship search|work=BBC News|date=3 April 2010|accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on 3 April 2010 South Korea called off the rescue operation for the missing sailors, after families of the sailors asked for the operation to be suspended for fear of further casualties among the rescue divers. The military's focus then shifted towards salvage operations, which were predicted to take up to a month to complete.&lt;ref name=AP-20100403&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jQydsIWmNQZpwRriADac51u5rx8gD9ERMARG1|title=SKorea stops underwater search for missing sailors|author=Kwang-Tae Kim|date=3 April 2010|work=The Associated Press|accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported on 19 May 2010, that a team of investigators from Sweden, Australia, Britain, and the United States had concluded that a North Korean torpedo sank the ship.

On 7 May 2010, a government official said that a team of South Korean civilian and military experts&lt;ref name="report"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/asia_pacific/10130309.stm Excerpts: South Korea ship sinking report], BBC, 20 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; had found traces of [[RDX]], a high explosive more powerful than [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] and used in torpedoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/05/113_65519.html Explosives from torpedo found on sunken ship, by Lee Tae-hoon] [[Korea Times]], 7 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 May 2010, the discovery of a fragment of metal containing a serial number similar to one on a North Korean torpedo salvaged by South Korea in 2003 was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2920725|title=Probe IDs torpedo that sunk ''Cheonan'': sources|publisher=JoongAng Daily|date=20 May 2010|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Chosun Ilbo]]'', South Korean investigators told their journalists that they believe that one or two North Korean submarines, a {{sclass2-|Yono|submarine|1}} and the other a {{sclass2-|Sang-O|submarine|1}}, departed a naval base at Cape Bipagot accompanied by a support ship on 23 March 2010. One of the subs, according to the report, detoured around to the west side of [[Baengnyeong Island]], arriving on 25 March 2010. There, it waited about {{convert|30|m|ft}} under the ocean's surface in waters {{convert|40|to|50|m|ft}} deep for ''Cheonan'' to pass by.&lt;ref name=yono/&gt;

Investigators believe that the submarine fired the torpedo from about 3&amp;nbsp;km away. The attack appears to have been timed for a period when tidal forces in the area were slow. The North Korean vessels returned to port on 28 March 2010.&lt;ref name=yono&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Chosun Ilbo]]|title=How Did N.

[[File:CHT-02D torpedo propulsion section showing 1번 marking.jpg|thumb|CHT-02D torpedo propulsion section showing 1번 marking]]
The torpedo parts recovered at the site of the explosion by a dredging ship on 15 May which include the 5×5 bladed contra-rotating propellers, propulsion motor and a steering section, was claimed to match the schematics of the CHT-02D torpedo included in introductory brochures provided to foreign countries by North Korea for export purposes. An incorrect, though similar, torpedo schematic had by mistake been shown at the televised RIG briefing for comparison with the recovered parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2010/06/29/49/0301000000AEN20100629007300315F.HTML|title=Investigators admit using wrong blueprint to show N.

The correct schematic has never been made public. The markings in [[Hangul]], which reads "1번" (or No. 1 in English), found inside the end of the propulsion section, is consistent with the marking of a previously obtained North Korean torpedo, but inconsistent with one found seven years ago, which is marked "4호."&lt;ref name=Hankyoreh-20100521&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/421856.html|title=Questions raised following ''Cheonan'' announcement|publisher=The Hankyoreh| date=21 May 2010| accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have pointed out that '호" is the term used most often in the North, rather than "번."&lt;ref name=Hankyoreh-20100521 /&gt; Russian and Chinese torpedoes are marked in their respective languages. The CHT-02D torpedo manufactured by North Korea utilizes acoustic/wake homing and passive acoustic tracking methods.&lt;ref name=ROKMOD-report-592 /&gt;

Simulations indicated that {{convert|250|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of [[TNT equivalent]] explosive at {{convert|6|to|9|m|ft}} depth, {{convert|3|m|ft}} to the port of the center line, would result in the damage seen to ''Cheonan''.&lt;ref name=ROKMOD-slides&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mnd-policy.tistory.com/353|title="Smoking Gun" Briefing Slides|work=South Korean Ministry of Defense|date=20 May 2010|accessdate=31 July 2010}} ([http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/files/MND_slides.pdf PDF version of partial slide set])&lt;/ref&gt;

The full report had not been released to the public at this time,&lt;ref name="time mag"&gt;{{cite news|title=South Korea's Case for How the ''Cheonan'' Sank|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2010455,00.html|work=Time|accessdate=15 August 2010|date=13 August 2010|first=Bill|last=Powell}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the South Korean legislature was provided with a five-page synopsis of the report.&lt;ref name="LA times 24" /&gt;

====Full report====
A draft copy of the report was obtained by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] in early August 2010, before the final report was released. According to ''Time'', the report assessed in detail ten possible alternative scenarios, with extensive discussion and explanation of why those ten were not possible. It finally settled on the eleventh explanation, which was a North Korean attack, which it said was a "high possibility."&lt;ref name="time mag"/&gt;

In support of this conclusion, the report says that witnesses had reported seeing flashes of light or sounds of an explosion, as well as that the [[US Navy]] analysis of the wreck concluded that a torpedo containing 250 kilograms of explosives had collided with ''Cheonan'' six to nine meters below the waterline. Damage to the hull supported this conclusion, while inconsistent with what would be expected if the ship had run aground or had been hit with a missile.&lt;ref name="time mag"/&gt;

On 13 September 2010, the full report was released.&lt;ref name=RIG-report&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nautilus.org/publications/essays/napsnet/sr/Cheonan.pdf |title=Joint Investigation Report On the Attack Against the ROKS Ship ''Cheonan'' |work=Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Korea |date=September 2010 |isbn=978-89-7677-711-9 |oclc=868822578 |accessdate=4 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016214912/http://www.nautilus.org/publications/essays/napsnet/reports/Cheonan.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded that ''Cheonan'' had been sunk due to a torpedo explosion, which, while not having contacted the ship, exploded several meters from the hull of the ship and caused a shockwave and bubble effect of sufficient strength to severely damage and sink the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seoul reaffirms N.

Lee Jung Hee, a lawmaker with the opposition [[Democratic Labor Party (South Korea)|Democratic Labor Party]], was sued for defamation by seven people at South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. Lee said during a speech in the national assembly that while the Defense Ministry had said there was no feed from a thermal observation device showing the moment the warship's stern and bow split apart, such a video did exist.

Near the end of May a team of [[Russian Navy]] submarine and torpedo experts visited South Korea to conduct an assessment of the South Korean led investigation. The team returned to Russia with samples for further physical-chemical analysis.&lt;ref name=rian-20100608&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20100608/159349260.html|title=Russian experts inspect to probe ''Cheonan'' issue at home|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=8 June 2010|accessdate=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; No official statement on the assessment has been made. It was claimed that the assessment concluded ''Cheonan'' was not sunk by a North Korean bubble jet torpedo, but did not come to any firm conclusion about the cause of the sinking.&lt;ref name=hani-20100710&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/popups/print.hani?ksn=429769|title=Government protests Russia's Conflicting ''Cheonan'' findings|author=Lee Yeong-in|publisher=[[The Hankyoreh]]|date=10 July 2010|accessdate=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hindu]]'' quoted a Russian Navy source stating that "after examining the available evidence and the ship wreckage Russian experts came to the conclusion that a number of arguments produced by the international investigation in favour of the DPRK's involvement in the corvette sinking were not weighty enough”.&lt;ref name=hindu-20100609&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article450117.ece|title=Russian probe undercuts ''Cheonan'' sinking theory|author=Vladimir Radyuhin|work=The Hindu |date=9 June 2010|accessdate=23 July 2010|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 July 2010, ''[[The Hankyoreh]]'' published what it claimed was a detailed summary of the Russian Navy expert team's analysis.&lt;ref name="hani-russian-navy-summary-analysis"/&gt; According to ''The Hankyoreh'', the Russian investigators concluded that ''Cheonan'' touched the sea floor and damaged one of its propellers prior to a non-contact explosion, possibly caused by setting off a mine while the ship was trying to maneuver into deeper water. Visual examination of the torpedo parts South Korea found purportedly indicated that it had been in the water for more than 6 months.&lt;ref name=hani-russian-navy-suspect-mine&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/ISSUE/75/432232.html|title=Russia's ''Cheonan'' investigation suspects that the sinking ''Cheonan'' ship was caused by a mine in water|publisher=The Hankyoreh|date=27 July 2010|accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the following day South Korean officials responded with "a full-scale refutation".&lt;ref name=hani-russian-navy-summary-response&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/432422.html|title=Lee administration responds to Russian investigation report|publisher=The Hankyoreh|date=28 July 2010|accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 August 2010 Russian UN ambassador [[Vitaly Churkin]] stated that his country's investigative report's conclusions into the sinking would not be made public.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yonhap]]'', "Moscow Not To Make Public Probe Outcome On ''Cheonan''{{'}}s Sinking: Amb. Churkin", 5 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Withholding the investigation results was seen as insensitive by South Korea, but avoided political damage to a number of states.&lt;ref name=kt-20101012&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/10/113_74440.html|title=Why Russia doesn't share its Cheonan results with Seoul|author=Sunny Lee|date=12 October 2010|publisher=Korea Times|location=Seoul|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese claims===
During talks between the American and Chinese governments in late May 2010, Chinese officials were reported by [[Yoichi Shimatsu]], a commentator for the Chinese state-run [[CCTV-9]], to have claimed that the sinking of ''Cheonan'' had been as a result of an American [[naval mine|rising mine]], which was moored to the seabed and propels itself into a ship detected by sound or magnetics, planted during anti-submarine exercises that were conducted by the South Korean and US navies shortly before the sinking. To back up their claims, the Chinese said that North Korean submarines such as the one believed to have sunk ''Cheonan'' were incapable of moving undetected within South Korean waters, and a rising mine would have damaged the ship by splitting the hull, as was done to ''Cheonan'', rather than simply holing the vessel as a conventional torpedo does. A conventional torpedo traveling at {{convert|40|–|50|kn}} would also be completely destroyed upon impact, which was claimed to contradict the torpedo parts found later. (The original report, however, did not assert that a conventional torpedo strike had occurred, but rather that the torpedo had exploded underneath the ship, thus breaking its back. See above under '''Investigation'''.) &lt;ref name="new american media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newamericamedia.org/2010/05/did-an-american-mine-sink-the-south-korean-ship.php|title=Did an American Mine Sink South Korean Ship?|author=Yoichi Shimatsu,|publisher=New America Media|date=27 May 2010|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' journalist [[Peter Foster (journalist)|Peter Foster]] in a blog post noted that while not everyone (including Russia and China) was convinced of the truth of the [[ROKS Cheonan sinking#Cause of sinking|international inquiry into the ROKS ''Cheonan'' sinking]], some conspiracy theories and unanswered questions on the sinking, including one ascribing responsibility of the sinking to a rising mine deployed during a joint US-South Korean Foal Eagle anti-submarine exercises, ought to be read "with a large pinch of salt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cheonan sinking: top ten conspiracy theories| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peterfoster/100042229/cheonan-sinking-top-ten-conspiracy-theories/| newspaper=The Daily Telegraph | location=London| date=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other international research===
A separate investigation conducted by scientists at the [[University of Manitoba]] yielded results that conflict with the official investigation's findings. According to the leader of the investigation, residue on the hull of the ship that was claimed to have been [[aluminum oxide]], which is a byproduct of explosions such as that of a torpedo, had a far higher ratio of oxygen to aluminum, leading the researchers to conclude that "we cannot say that the substance adhering to the ''Cheonan'' was the explosion byproduct of aluminum oxide."&lt;ref name=hankyoreh-20100628&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/427801.html|title=Scientists question ''Cheonan'' investigation findings|publisher=The Hankyoreh|date=28 June 2010|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South Korean Ministry of Defense issued a rebuttal to the findings, saying, "The detonation of explosives containing aluminum occurs within hundreds of thousandths of a second under high temperatures of more than 3,000 degrees Celsius and high pressures of more than 200,000 atm, and most of it becomes noncrystalline aluminum oxide."&lt;ref name=hankyoreh-20100628 /&gt;

A report published online by ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on 8 July 2010 noted several instances of groups or individuals disagreeing with the official report.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100708/full/news.2010.343.html|title=Controversy over South Korea's sunken ship|publisher=Nature|date=8 July 2010|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nautilus.org/napsnet/napsnet-policy-forum/rush-to-judgment-inconsistencies-in-south-koreas-cheonan-report/|title=Rush to Judgment: Inconsistencies in South Korea's Cheonan Report|author=Seunghun Lee and J.J. Suh|publisher=Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability|id=Policy Forum 10-039|date=15 July 2010|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article also notes the rebuttal of those disagreements by analysts and government officials, with one analyst arguing that the sinking was "consistent with North Korea's behaviour in the past."&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;

In 2013, an academic paper was published analysing the available seismic data. It calculated that the sesmic data recorded would be accounted for by a {{convert|136|kg|lb|abbr=on}} TNT-equivalent charge, similar to the explosive yield of land control mines which had been abandoned in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00024-012-0554-9 |title=Underwater Explosion (UWE) Analysis of the ROKS Cheonan Incident |author=So Gu Kim, Yefim Gitterman |journal=Pure and Applied Geophysics |volume=170 |issue=4 |date=10 August 2012 |doi=10.1007/s00024-012-0554-9 |issn=0033-4553 |accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hankyoreh-20120914&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/551681.html |title=New evidence that Cheonan was sunk by an old mine |author=Kang Tae-Ho |newspaper=Hankyoreh |date=14 September 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014, an academic paper was published analysing the spectra of the seismic signals and hydroacoustic reverberation waves generated. The paper found it doubtful that the vibrations of the water column were caused by an underwater explosion, instead finding that the recorded seismic spectra were consistent with the natural vibration frequencies of a large submarine with a length of around {{convert|113|m|ft}}. This raised the possibility that the sinking was caused by a collision with a large submarine, rather than an explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/aav/2014/514346/ |title=What Really Caused the ROKS Cheonan Warship Sinking? |author=Hwang Su Kim and Mauro Caresta |journal=Advances in Acoustics and Vibration |date=20 November 2014 |doi=10.1155/2014/514346 |accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of North Korea}}

=== South Korea ===
[[President of South Korea|South Korean President]] [[Lee Myung-bak]] convened an emergency meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Orders were given to the military to concentrate on rescuing the survivors. In [[Seoul]], police were put on alert. At the time, a spokesman for the South Korean military stated that there was no evidence that [[North Korea]] had been involved in the incident.&lt;ref name="BBC8589507"/&gt; A large group of relatives of the missing sailors protested outside the navy base at [[Pyeongtaek]] over the lack of information provided to them.&lt;ref name=BBC8590515/&gt;

On 28 March relatives were taken to the site of the sunken vessel. Some relatives stated that survivors had claimed that the ''Cheonan'' had been in a poor state of repair.&lt;ref name=AP-20100328&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jQydsIWmNQZpwRriADac51u5rx8gD9ENJ9B83|title=Angry families visit site of sunken SKorean ship|author=Mark TranSi-Young Lee and Hyung-Jin Kim|date=28 March 2010|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean media have raised the issue of why the sister ship {{ship|ROKS|Sokcho|PCC778|2}}, which was operating nearby, did not come to the rescue of the sinking ship but instead fired shots at radar images which were later confirmed to be migratory birds.&lt;ref name=kt-20100401&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2010/04/137_63498.html|title=Military Under Fire&amp;nbsp;– Questions Grow Over Crisis Management Capability|date=1 April 2010|publisher=Korea Times|location=Seoul|accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 April 2010, President Lee Myung-bak visited Baengnyeong Island. He reiterated that it was risky to speculate over the cause, and the joint military and civilian investigation team would determine the cause. He said, "We have to find the cause in a way that satisfies not only our people but also the international community".&lt;ref name=kt-20100405&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/04/113_63696.html|title=Lee Warns Against Speculation Over ''Cheonan''|author=Na Jeong-ju|date=5 April 2010|publisher=Korea Times|location=Seoul|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president of South Korea has mourned the victims and said that he will respond "resolutely" to the sinking without yet laying blame for its cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Korea mourns victims of ship sinking|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8643374.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May Lee Myung-bak said the South would "resort to measures of self-defense in case of further military provocation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea." He also supported readopting the official description of the North as the "main enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-05/25/c_13314888.htm|title=ROK president gives nod to calling DPRK "main enemy"|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131119020347/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-05/25/c_13314888.htm|archivedate=19 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea pursued measures from the [[United Nations Security Council]] after the incident, although the language used in the country's statements towards such measures became progressively weaker. In announcements made soon after the sinking, the government said that any draft presented by South Korea would explicitly state that North Korea was responsible for the incident, but by early July, the language had been reduced to only referring to "those responsible," in response to concerns from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/428559.html|title=Requested Security Council ''Cheonan'' measures weaken considerably|publisher=The Hankyoreh|date=2 July 2010|accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Diplomatic====
Since the incident, the South Korean government has been reluctant to engage in further diplomacy with North Korea over disputes such as North Korea's [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons program]]. In response to a request by China, in April 2011 South Korea agreed to talks, but South Korean government officials commented that an apology from North Korea for the sinking would probably be necessary to facilitate any significant progress in the dialogues.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Korea Herald]]'', "Seoul Insists On N. Korea Apology Before Dialogue", 18 April 2011; ''[[Yonhap]]'', "Seoul Renews Demand For N. Korea's Responsible Steps Over Deadly Attacks", 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military====
On 2 May it was reported that South Korea's naval minister vowed "retaliation" against those responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=S. Korea minister vows retaliation over warship sinking|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/restofasia/S-Korea-minister-vows-retaliation-over-warship-sinking/Article1-538274.aspx|work=Hindustan Times|date=2 May 2010|accessdate=2 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505141833/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/restofasia/S-Korea-minister-vows-retaliation-over-warship-sinking/Article1-538274.aspx|archivedate=5 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admiral Kim Sung-chan, at a publicly televised funeral for ''Cheonan''{{'}}s dead crew members in Pyeongtaek, stated that, "We will not sit back and watch whoever caused this pain for our people. We will hunt them down and make them pay a bigger price."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Korea Herald]]'', "Navy Chief Vows Revenge For ''Cheonan''", 30 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 May President Lee proposed "extensive reformations" for the South Korean military regarding the sinking incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=대우 (Dae-u)|last=김 (Kim)|script-title=ko:"작전,무기,군대조직,문화도 다바꿔라" 軍 전방위 개혁 예고|date=4 May 2010|url =http://biz.heraldm.com/common/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20100504000486|work=Herald Economics|accessdate=5 May 2010|language=Korean|trans-title="Change All Of Plans, Weapons, Organization, Culture" Military Announces Omni-directional Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the official report was released South Korea has said that it will take strong countermeasures against the North.&lt;ref name="stuff1"&gt;{{cite news|title=North Korea accused of sinking ship|date=20 May 2010|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/asia/3721583/North-Korea-accused-of-sinking-ship|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trade====
On 24 May 2010, South Korea announced it would stop nearly all its trade with North Korea as a result of the official report blaming North Korea for the sinking. South Korea also announced it would prohibit North Korean vessels from using its shipping channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/south-korea-cuts-trade-ties-with-north-over-sinking-20100524-w7y6.html|title=South Korea cuts trade ties with North over sinking|last=Choe Sang-Hun|date=24 May 2010|work=The Age|accessdate=24 May 2010|location=Melbourne, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', the trade embargoes were "the most serious action" South Korea could take short of military action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/world/asia/25korea.html?ref=world|title=Pentagon and U.N.

====Psychological warfare====
The South Korean military announced that it would resume [[psychological warfare]] directed at North Korea. This would include both loudspeaker and [[FM radio]] propaganda broadcasts across the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ). Meanwhile, a North Korean military commander stated, “If South Korea establishes new psychological warfare services, we will fire against them in order to eliminate them,” according to a report carried by the [[Korean Central News Agency]] (KCNA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&amp;num=6406|title=Psychological Warfare Will Resume|last=Kim So Yeol|date=24 May 2010|work=[[Daily NK]]|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea began propaganda broadcasts into North Korea by radio on 25 May. North Korea responded by putting its troops on high alert, and severed most remaining ties and communications with South Korea in response to what it called a "smear campaign" by Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/on_re_as/as_korea_ship_sinks |accessdate=25 May 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korean military propaganda FM broadcasts were resumed at 18:00 (local time) starting with the song "HuH" by [[K-pop]] band [[4minute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allkpop.com/2010/05/south-korea-starts-border-propaganda-war-with-4minute|title=South Korea resumes border propaganda broadcast with 4minute!|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the propaganda broadcasts, South Korea reinstalled loudspeakers at eleven places along the DMZ. There was originally a plan to also use electronic signs, although due to cost, the plan was reportedly being reconsidered. On 13 June, South Korean media announced that the South Korean Defense Minister, Kim Tae-young, had said that anti-North Korea broadcasts were planned to resume after the [[United Nations Security Council]] took action against North Korea in response to the sinking of ''Cheonan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2010/06/13/3/0401000000AEN20100613003100315F.HTML|title=S. Korea reconsiders installing electronic signboards against N. Korea|date=13 June 2010|work=Yonhap|accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suppressing internal dissent====
Discourse over the events leading to the sinking of ''Cheonan'' was tightly controlled by the South Korean government in the months after the incident. On 8 May 2010, a former [[Senior Presidential Secretary|senior presidential secretary]] who served under Roh Moo-hyun, Park Seon-won,&lt;ref&gt;Korean newspapers have [[romanized]] his name as ''Park Seon-won''; however, papers he published while as a [[visiting fellow]] at the [[Brookings Institution]] indicate he romanizes his name as ''Sun-won Park''.&lt;/ref&gt; was charged with [[libel]] by South Korea's Defense Minister, Kim Tae-young, over comments he made during a 22 April interview on [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] radio asking for greater disclosure from the military and government. Park Seon-won's response to the charge was: "I asked for the disclosure of information for a transparent and impartial investigation into the cause of the ''Cheonan'' sinking;" he added that "the libel suit seeks to silence public suspicion over the incident."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Pres. Secretary Sued for Spreading ''Cheonan'' Rumors|date=8 May 2010|url=http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?bicode=040000&amp;biid=2010050896608|accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea's Minister of Public Administration and Security, Maeng Hyung-kyu, announced on 20 May 2010 that the government was stepping up efforts to prosecute people who spread "groundless rumors" over the internet: "Anyone who makes false reports or articles about the incident could seriously damage national security. We will not let these be the basis of any risks the nation faces." Moreover, he announced the government would step up efforts to prevent "illegal gatherings" regarding the sinking of ''Cheonan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gov't warns against 'groundless rumors'|date=20 May 2010|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/05/117_66222.html|accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A South Korean military oversight board, the Board of Inspection and Audit, has accused senior South Korean naval leaders of lying and hiding information. Said the board, "Military officers deliberately left out or distorted key information in their report to senior officials and the public because they wanted to avoid being held to account for being unprepared."&lt;ref name="LA times 24"/&gt;

In 2013, a documentary film named ''Project Cheonan Ship'' was released in South Korea about the sinking, including a number of possible alternative causes for the sinking. Members and relatives of the South Korean navy sought a court injunction to block the film’s release on the basis that the film distorted the facts. The injunction was denied in court, however, a major cimema chain, [[Megabox (movie theatres)|Megabox]], withdrew the film after warnings from conservative groups that they planned to picket showings the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2013/09/project-cheonan-ship-steve-borowiec/ |title=South Korea: Film raises questions about Cheonan sinking |publisher=Index on Censorship |date=17 September 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-20130905&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/09/05/film-about-korean-sunken-ship-opens-in-theaters/ |title=Controversial Film About Warship Sinking Opens in Theaters |author=Jeyup S. Kwaak |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=5 September 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===
North Korea's [[Korean Central News Agency]] (KCNA) released an official response to the investigation on 28 May 2010, asserting, amongst other things, that it is unbelievable that part of a torpedo doing so much damage to a ship would survive: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Besides, the assertion that the screw shaft and engine remained undamaged and unchanged in shape is also a laughing shock. Even U.S. and British members of the international investigation team, which had blindly backed the South Korean regime in its 'investigation', were perplexed at the exhibit in a glass box.&lt;ref name="(North) Korean News News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2010/201005/news28/20100528-18ee.html|title=Military Commentator on Truth behind "Story of Attack by North"|publisher=(North) Korean News|accessdate=28 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130218140842/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2010/201005/news28/20100528-18ee.html|archivedate=18 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 17 April 2010, it was reported that North Korea officially denied having had anything to do with the sinking, responding to what it referred to as "The puppet military warmongers, right-wing conservative politicians and the group of other traitors in South Korea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Miyoung Kim|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63G0CN20100417|title=North Korea denies it sank South's navy ship|publisher=Reuters|date=17 April 2010|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article from KCNA entitled "Military Commentator Denies Involvement in Ship Sinking" stated that the event was an accident.

&lt;blockquote&gt;... we have so far regarded the accident as a regretful accident that should not happen in the light of the fact that many missing persons and most of rescued members of the crew are fellow countrymen forced to live a tiresome life in the puppet army.&lt;ref name="kcna0417"&gt;"[http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2010/201004/news17/20100417-15ee.html Military Commentator Denies Involvement in Ship Sinking ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511090436/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2010/201004/news17/20100417-15ee.html |date=11 May 2010 }}", ''[[Korean Central News Agency]]''. 17 April 2010. Retrieved 28 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 21 May 2010, North Korea offered to send their own investigative team to review the evidence compiled by South Korea,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Hankyoreh]]'', "N. Korea's Reinvestigation Proposal Alters ''Cheonan'' Situation", 21 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[the Hankyoreh]] quoted Kim Yeon-chul, professor of unification studies at [[Inje University]], commenting on the offer: "It is unprecedented in the history of inter-Korean relations for North Korea to propose sending an investigation team in response to an issue that has been deemed a 'military provocation by North Korea,'"and thus "The ''Cheonan'' situation has entered a new phase."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/421857.html|title=N. Korea's reinvestigation proposal alters ''Cheonan'' situation|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea also warned of a wide range of hostile reactions to any move by South Korea to hold it accountable for the sinking.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the South puppet group comes out with 'response' and 'retaliation', we will respond strongly with ruthless punishment including the total shutdown of North-South ties, abrogation of the North-South agreement on non-aggression and abolition of all North-South cooperation projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Miyoung Kim|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/asia/3725039/North-Korea-declares-phase-of-war-with-south|title=North Korea declares phase of war with south|publisher=Reuters|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 24 May, new reports indicated Kim Jong-il had ordered the armed forces of North Korea to be ready for combat a week before.&lt;ref name="aljaz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2010/05/201052534421773321.html|title=Asia-Pacific – S Korea resumes border broadcasts|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, North Korea released a list of measures that it will take in response to South Korea's sanctions. This would include the cutting of all ties and communications, except for the [[Kaesong Industrial Region|Kaesong industrial complex]]. They would revert to a wartime footing in regard to South Korea and disallow any South Korean ships or aircraft to enter the territory of North Korea.&lt;ref name="statement"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64O3YU20100525|title=Text from North Korea statement|publisher=Reuters|date=25 May 2010|accessdate=26 May 2010|first=Jonathan|last=Thatcher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May, North Korea announced that it would scrap an agreement aimed at preventing accidental naval clashes with South Korea. It also announced that any South Korean vessel found crossing the disputed maritime border would be immediately attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia_pacific/10170019.stm| title=North Korea scraps South Korea military safeguard pact|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 May 2010|date=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May, KCNA stated that "it is the United States that is behind the case of ''Cheonan''. The investigation was steered by the U.S. from its very outset." It also accused the United States of manipulating the investigation and named the administration of US President [[Barack Obama]] directly of using the case for "escalating instability in the Asia-Pacific region, containing big powers and emerging unchallenged in the region."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-05/28/c_13321709.htm DPRK accuses U.S. of cooking up, manipulating "Cheonan case"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170832/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-05/28/c_13321709.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}, by Xiong Tong, Xinhua News Agency, 28 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May, North Korea warned the United Nations to be wary of evidence presented in the international investigation, likening the case to the claims of weapons of mass destruction that the United States used to justify its [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war against Iraq]] in 2003 and stated that "the U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks it can occupy the Korean Peninsula just as it did Iraq with sheer lies." The North Korea foreign minister warned the [[United Nations Security Council]] of risks of being "misused". It also accused the United States of joining South Korea in putting "China into an awkward position and keep hold on Japan and South Korea as its servants."&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt;

High ranking North Korean military officials denounced the international investigation and said North Korea does not have the type of submarines that supposedly carried out the attack. They also dismissed claims regarding writings on the torpedo and clarified that "when we put serial numbers on weapons, we engrave them with machines." South Korea's [[Yonhap News Agency]] quoted South Korean officials as saying that North Korea has about ten of the {{sclass-|Yeono|submarines}}.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt;

On 2 November, KCNA published a detailed rebuttal of the South Korean joint investigative team report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2010/201011/news02/20101102-10ee.html |title="Cheonan" Case Termed Most Hideous Conspiratorial Farce in History |newspaper=KCNA |date=2 November 2010 |accessdate=5 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101123810/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2010/201011/news02/20101102-10ee.html |archivedate=1 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Rodong Sinmun]]'' claimed that the "probability of a torpedo attack on (the) Cheonan Warship" was 0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rodong.rep.kp/InterEn/index.php?strPageID=SF01_02_01&amp;newsID=2012-06-28-0011|title=Probability of Torpedo Attack on Cheonan Warship: 0%|publisher=''[[Rodong Sinmun]]''|author=Ri Song Ho|work=rodong.rep.kp|date=28 June 2012|accessdate=29 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130218214048/http://www.rodong.rep.kp/InterEn/index.php?strPageID=SF01_02_01&amp;newsID=2012-06-28-0011|archivedate=18 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
{{Main article|Reactions to the 2010 ROKS Cheonan sinking}}
When the official report on the sinking was released on 20 May there was widespread international condemnation of North Korea's actions. China was one of few exceptions, simply terming the incident "unfortunate" and "urged stability on the peninsula". This was speculated to be China's concern for instability in the [[Korean Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="stuff1"/&gt;

On 14 June 2010, South Korea presented the results of its investigation to United Nations Security Council members.&lt;ref name="UN-S/2010/281"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/DPRK%20S%202010%20281%20SKorea%20Letter%20and%20Cheonan%20Report.pdf|title=Letter dated 4 June 2010 from the Permanent Representative of the Republic of Korea to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council|work=United Nations Security Council|author=Park In-kook|date=4 June 2010|id=S/2010/281|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franceonu.org/spip.php?article3753|title=North Korea – Developments at the UN|publisher=Permanent Mission of France to the United Nations|date=July 2010|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent meeting with council members North Korea stated that it had nothing to do with the incident.&lt;ref name="UN-S/2010/294"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/NKorea%20S%202010%20294.pdf|title=Letter dated 8 June 2010 from the Permanent Representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council|work=United Nations Security Council|author=Sin Son Ho|date=8 June 2010|id=S/2010/294|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July 2010 the United Nations Security Council made a [[Presidential Statement]] condemning the attack but without identifying the attacker.&lt;ref name="UN-S/PRST/2010/13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ft-20100709&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4208c344-8b6e-11df-ab4d-00144feab49a.html|title=North Korea escapes blame over ship sinking|author=Harvey Morris|date=9 July 2010|work=Financial Times|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; China had resisted U.S. calls for a tougher line against North Korea.&lt;ref name=nyt-20100629&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/30/world/asia/30korea.html|title=China Returns U.S. Criticism Over Sinking of Korean Ship|author=Andrew Jacobs and David E.

==Later reports==
A member of the North Korean cabinet who defected to the south in 2011 said on 7 December 2012 that the crew of the North Korean submarine which sank ''Cheonan'' had been honored by the North Korean military and government. The defector, known by the alias "Ahn Cheol-nam", stated that the captain, co-captain, engineer, and boatswain of the mini-sub which sank ''Cheonan'' had been awarded "[[Hero of the DPRK]]" in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;''[[JoongAng Ilbo]]'', [http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2012/12/07/31/0401000000AEN20121207008700315F.HTML N.

The '''Silver Spring monkeys''' were 17 wild-born [[macaque]] monkeys from the [[Philippines]] who were kept in the Institute for Behavioral Research in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]].&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt; From 1981 until 1991, they became what one writer called the most famous lab animals in history, as a result of a battle between animal researchers, animal advocates, politicians, and the courts over whether to use them in research or release them to a sanctuary. Within the scientific community, the monkeys became known for their use in experiments into [[neuroplasticity]]—the ability of the adult primate brain to reorganize itself.&lt;ref&gt;Doidge, Norman. ''The Brain That Changes Itself''. Viking Penguin, 2007, p. 136: Doidge calls them the most famous lab animals in history.
*Blum, Deborah. ''The Monkey Wars''. Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The monkeys had been used as research subjects by [[Edward Taub]], a psychologist, who had cut [[Dorsal root ganglion|afferent ganglia]] that supplied sensation to the brain from their arms, then used arm slings to restrain either the good or [[Deafferentation|deafferented]] arm to train them to use the limbs they could not feel.&lt;ref&gt;Doidge 2007, p. 141-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1981, [[Alex Pacheco (activist)|Alex Pacheco]] of the animal-rights group [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) began working undercover in the lab, and alerted police to what PETA viewed as unacceptable living conditions for the monkeys.&lt;ref name=Pacheco&gt;Pacheco, Alex and Francione, Anna.

*The [[National Institutes of Health]] initially said that Taub's laboratory was "grossly unsanitary" and suspended his funding, a decision that was later reversed; see Dajer, T. "Monkeying with the Brain", ''Discover'', January 1992, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; In what was the first police raid in the U.S. against an animal researcher, police entered the Institute and removed the monkeys, charging Taub with 17 counts of animal cruelty and failing to provide adequate veterinary care. He was convicted on six counts; five were overturned during a second trial, and the final conviction was overturned on appeal in 1983, when the court ruled that Maryland's animal cruelty legislation did not apply to federally funded laboratories.&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt;

The ensuing battle over the monkeys' custody saw celebrities and politicians campaign for the monkeys' release, an amendment in 1985 to the Animal Welfare Act, the transformation of PETA from a group of friends into a national movement, the creation of the first North American [[Animal Liberation Front]] cell, and the first animal research case to reach the United States Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson 1991.

Lantern Books, 2000, p. xv, says the case triggered the formation of the first North American ALF cell.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1991, PETA's application to the Supreme Court for custody was rejected.  Days later, the last two monkeys were killed after veterinarians determined they were suffering and should be euthanized.&lt;ref name="NYT041491"&gt;{{cite news|title=2 Lab Monkeys Killed After Top Court Acts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/14/us/2-lab-monkeys-killed-after-top-court-acts.html?sq=Silver+Spring+monkeys&amp;scp=5&amp;st=nyt|accessdate=24 April 2018|agency=Associated Press|publisher=New York Times|date=14 April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the subsequent dissection of the monkeys, it was discovered that significant [[Cortical map|cortical remapping]] had occurred, suggesting that being forced to use limbs with no sensory input had triggered changes in their brains' organization.&lt;ref name=LearyJune1991&gt;Leary, Warren E.

Known as [[constraint-induced movement therapy]], it has helped stroke survivors regain the use of limbs paralysed for many years, and has been hailed by the American Stroke Association as at the forefront of a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz and Begley 2002, p. 160.

==Background==
{{animal testing}}

===Edward Taub===
[[Edward Taub]] (born 1931) is a behavioral neuroscientist currently based at the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]]. He became interested in [[behaviorism]] while studying philosophy at Columbia University, and went on to study under [[Fred S. Keller|Fred Keller]] and [[William N. Schoenfeld|Wiliam N. Schoenfeld]], the experimental psychologists. He took a job as a research assistant in a neurology lab to gain more understanding of the [[nervous system]], and became involved in [[Body schema#Deafferentation|deafferentation]] experiments with monkeys.

An ''[[afferent nerve]]'' is a sensory nerve that conveys impulses from the skin and other sensory organs to the spine and the brain. ''Deafferentation'' is a surgical procedure in which the [[spinal cord]] is opened up and the sensory nerves cut so that these impulses do not reach the brain.  A monkey whose limbs have been deafferented will not feel them, or even be able to sense where they are in space. At his trial in 1981, Taub told the court that deafferented monkeys are notoriously difficult to look after, because they regard their deafferented limbs as foreign objects, mutilating them and trying to chew them off.&lt;ref name=Schwartz149&gt;Schwartz and Begley 2002, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Taub continued working with deafferented monkeys at New York University, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1970. Engaged in what he saw at first as [[pure research]], he conducted several kinds of deafferentation experiments. He deafferented monkeys' entire bodies, so that they could feel no part of themselves. He deafferented them at birth. He removed monkey fetuses from the uterus, deafferented them, then returned them to be born with no sense of their own bodies.&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt;

When Taub began his research in the neurology lab, the prevalent view was that monkeys would not be able to use limbs they could not feel. [[Norman Doidge]] writes that Taub wondered whether the reason the monkeys abandoned use of the deafferented limbs was simply that they were still able to use their good ones. He tested his idea by deafferenting one arm of a monkey and restraining the good arm in a sling. The monkey subsequently used its deafferented arm to feed and move itself around. He reasoned that, if a monkey refused to use a deafferented arm because it could rely on its good arm, then deafferenting both arms would force the monkey to use them, a finding that seemed paradoxical, but which his experiments confirmed. He even deafferented the entire spinal cord, so that the monkey received no sensory input from any of its limbs, but it still used them. Doidge writes that Taub had an epiphany, guessing that the reason the monkeys would not use their deafferented limbs was simply because they had learned not to, an idea he called "[[learned non-use]]."&lt;ref&gt;Doidge 2007, pp. 139, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alex Pacheco===
Alex Pacheco (born 1958) was a graduate student at George Washington University when he volunteered in May 1981 to work as a research assistant in Taub's lab. ''The Washington Post'' writes that he was raised in Mexico, the son of a doctor, and wanted to become a priest. He took a tour of a slaughterhouse in the 1970s and said it changed his life; he read [[Peter Singer]]'s ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975), stopped eating meat, and became an animal rights activist. He worked on the anti-whaling ship, the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]], joined the [[Hunt Saboteurs Association]] in England, and when he returned to the United States to study political science at George Washington, he teamed up with [[Ingrid Newkirk]], a local poundmaster, to form People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in March 1980. The point of taking the research position in Taub's lab was to gain firsthand experience of what happens in animal research laboratories, so he looked through a list of government-funded labs and chose the one nearest his home in Takoma Park.&lt;ref  name=Carlson/&gt; Taub offered him an unpaid position and put him to work with a student, Georgette Yakalis.&lt;ref name=Pacheco /&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:TwoSilverSpringmonkeys.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Two of the Silver Spring monkeys, photographed inside the Institute by Alex Pacheco]] --&gt;
Inside the Institute for Behavioral Research, Taub was conducting deafferentation experiments on 16 male [[crab-eating macaque]]s (''Macaca fascicularis''),  and one female [[rhesus macaque]] (''Macaca mulatta''), each about 14&amp;nbsp;inches tall, all born wild in the Philippines.  Each monkey lived alone in a wire cage measuring 18&amp;nbsp; x&amp;nbsp;18&amp;nbsp;inches, with no bedding, no food bowl, and no environmental enrichment, the cages kept in a windowless room measuring 15&amp;nbsp;ft square.&lt;ref name=Guillermo13&gt;Guillermo, Kathy Snow.

New York: Basil Blackwell, 1985, pp. 135–147.&lt;/ref&gt; Pacheco writes that 12 of the 17 monkeys had had one or both arms deafferented, while according to the ''Laboratory Primate Newsletter'' 10 had undergone deafferentation, the seven others acting as the control group.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;Clarke, A.S. [http://www.brown.edu/Research/Primate/lpn27-3.html 'Silver Spring' Monkeys at the San Diego Zoo], ''Laboratory Primate Newsletter'', Volume 27, No. 3, July 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers had named the monkeys Chester, Paul, Billy, Hard Times, Domitian, Nero, Titus, Big Boy, Augustus, Allen, Montaigne, Sisyphus, Charlie, Brooks, Hayden, Adidas, and Sarah. Sarah, the lone female, was a control subject, which meant she had been left intact. She had been purchased from a dealer, Litton Laboratories, when she was one day old, and had lived since then, for eight years, in the Institute.&lt;ref name=Carlson&gt;Carlson, Peter. "The Strange Case of the Silver Spring Monkeys," ''The Washington Post'' magazine, February 24, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul was the eldest. He had had one arm deafferented. He had chewed off all the fingers on that hand and pulled the skin and flesh off the palm, exposing the bone. Billy had undergone surgery to deafferent both arms, and used his feet to pick up food pellets.&lt;ref name=Guillermo13/&gt;

==Police raid and charges==

===Pacheco's description of the laboratory===
Pacheco wrote that he found the monkeys living in filthy conditions. He found frozen monkey corpses in a refrigerator, and others floating in formaldehyde.&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt; He alleged that, in the surgery room, human and monkey records were scattered everywhere, including under the operating table, while soiled clothes, old shoes, rat droppings, and urine covered the floor, with cockroaches in the drawers, on the floor, and around the scrub sink. He said the wires of the cages were caked in filth, with feces piled in the bottom of the cages, and urine and rust on every surface, with the 17 monkeys picking at scraps of food that had fallen through the wire floor of the cages into the waste tray below. He alleged that the cages had not been cleaned for months, that there were no dishes to keep the food away from the feces, and that there was nothing for the monkeys to sit on but the cages' wire bottoms. He wrote that 12 of the monkeys had deafferented limbs, with 39 of their fingers deformed or missing. He described them as neurotic, attacking their deafferented limbs as though they were foreign objects:&lt;ref name=Pacheco/&gt;

{{quote|No one bothered to bandage the monkeys' injuries properly (on the few occasions when bandages were used at all), and antibiotics were administered only once; no lacerations or self-amputation injuries were ever cleaned. Whenever a bandage was applied, it was never changed, no matter how filthy or soiled it became. They were left on until they deteriorated to the point where they fell off the injured limb. Old, rotted fragments of bandage were stuck to the cage floors where they collected urine and faeces. The monkeys also suffered from a variety of wounds that were self-inflicted or inflicted by monkeys grabbing at them from adjoining cages. I saw discoloured, exposed muscle tissue on their arms. Two monkeys had bones protruding through their flesh. Several had bitten off their own fingers and had festering stubs, which they extended towards me as I discreetly took fruit from my pockets. With these pitiful limbs they searched through the foul mess of their waste pans for something to eat.&lt;ref name=Pacheco/&gt;}}

===Informal inspections and raid===
Pacheco decided to document the conditions in the lab. He told Taub he wanted to work at night, and took photographs that showed the monkeys' living conditions. He showed them in July to animal rights activists, including [[Cleveland Amory]], who gave him money for a better camera and some walkie-talkies, so that a look-out outside could alert him if visitors arrived unexpectedly. He also asked Peter Hamilton of the Vancouver-based Lifeforce Foundation to assist with the investigation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In August, Pacheco began inviting veterinarians and scientists into the lab to witness the conditions. According to ''The Washington Post'', Geza Teleki, a primatologist at George Washington University, wrote that he had never seen a lab so poorly maintained, and psychologist Donald Barnes, a former primate researcher, wrote that it was a "miserable and unhealthful environment for the primates" and a health hazard for humans. One local veterinarian, Richard Weitzman, agreed that the lab was very dirty, but said the monkeys seemed well fed and "in pretty good health".&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt;

Pacheco reported the situation to the [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] police, who raided the laboratory on September 11, 1981 under Maryland's Prevention of Cruelty to Animals law. PETA tipped off the media beforehand, so that the raid was witnessed by several reporters and a camera crew, to the irritation of the police. The officers later testified that the monkeys were living in filthy conditions. Richard Swain, who led the raid, told ''The Washington Post'' in 1991: "It was absolutely filthy, just incredibly dirty, like nothing I've ever been in. I've executed lots and lots of search warrants. I've worked in murder, in narcotics, in vice, but this was the first time I went into a room and I felt legitimately concerned for my health just being there." Taub was charged with 17 counts of animal cruelty and failing to provide adequate veterinary care.&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt;

The police removed the monkeys from the lab to the basement of a house in Rockville owned by Lori Kenealy of the local humane society. Peter Carlson writes in ''The Washington Post'' that they were given toys, groomed with toothbrushes by the activists, watched 24 hours a day, and allowed to watch daytime soap operas. In the meantime, Taub's lawyers went to court and demanded their return, and ten days after the raid a judge granted the request. And suddenly, Carlson writes, the monkeys disappeared. Kenealy was not at home when it happened, and insisted she knew nothing about it. Richard Swain, who had led the police raid, arrested her and put her in the local jail overnight. PETA was told there could be no legal action against Taub without the monkeys as evidence. Carlson writes that, just as suddenly as they had disappeared, they were returned five days later, this time with Spanish moss in their cages after a holiday in Florida, according to the activists. After another brief stand-off, the monkeys were returned to Taub.&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt;

===Taub's response===
Taub said he had been set up. He said his laboratory had been clean when he left on vacation, but that Pacheco had failed to clean the cages, had neglected the animals, then subjected the laboratory to false reports of cruelty. During Taub's vacation that August, which lasted over two weeks, on seven different days in which the animals were supposed to have been fed and the cage area cleaned, the two caretakers failed to show up for work. Taub estimated the probability of seven absences in that 2.5 week period at seven in a trillion based on the previous 14 months of attendance records from the workers. On three of those absentee days, Pacheco brought people in to look at the monkeys.&lt;ref name=Science11dec1981&gt;Holder, Constance. "Scientist convicted for monkey neglect," ''Science'', December 11, 1981, volume 214, pp. 1218–1220.&lt;/ref&gt; Taub's research assistant, John Kunz, a graduate student, said it was simply that the caretakers took advantage of Taub's absence to have a holiday of their own.&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt;

During the trial in October and November 1981 of Taub and Kunz, Taub told the court—as reported by ''The Baltimore Sun''—that the monkeys had been given "gentle" treatment, and had what he called a "remarkable record of health." He acknowledged that they had not been seen by a veterinarian in the previous two years, because he was an expert himself in the treatment of deafferented monkeys. Responding to the images of the monkeys with open sores and decaying bandages, he said that using salves, ointments, and bandages is more dangerous than leaving the conditions untreated; monkeys feel no pain from the deafferented limbs and learn to ignore them, he said, whereas drawing attention to the wounds with salves or bandages would cause the animals to bite or claw at them. Bandages might be necessary where the wounds had grown out of control, or where there was massive infection, and it was sometimes better to let the bandages deteriorate, he said. Taub also testified that some of the photographs Pacheco took had been staged for dramatic effect.&lt;ref name=Ettlin&gt;Ettlin, David Michael. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1782061222.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+01%2C+1981&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Sun+%281837-1985%29&amp;desc=Taub+denies+allegations+of+cruelty&amp;pqatl=google "Taub denies allegations of cruelty"], ''The Baltimore Sun'', November 1, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Doidge wrote in 2007 that, according to Taub, the monkeys in the photographs had been placed in positions that were not part of the laboratory procedure, a claim Pacheco denied.&lt;ref&gt;Doidge 2007, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; As for the dirt, Taub said "monkey rooms are dirty places," and that it was normal in laboratories for fecal matter to lie on the floor and food to drop through the cage bottoms into waste trays. He said employees had used brooms and mops on the floor, and had emptied the waste trays nearly every day. He said the monkeys had been given fresh fruit twice a week, and that he disagreed with the veterinarians who testified for the prosecution that the female monkey, Sarah, was underweight.&lt;ref name=Ettlin/&gt;

===National Institutes of Health investigation===
The National Institutes of Health (NIH), which had financed Taub's research, suspended his $115,000 research grant.&lt;ref name=Ettlin/&gt; It initiated its own investigation, and sent the Office for the Protection from Research Risks (OPRR) to assess Taub's lab. OPRR found that the lab's animal care failed in significant ways, and concluded that it was grossly unsanitary.&lt;ref name=Science11dec1981/&gt; Based on the OPRR investigation, NIH suspended the remaining funding for the experiments, over $200,000, because of violations of its animal care guidelines.&lt;ref name=Boffey&gt;Boffey, Philip M. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9901E1D81039F934A15753C1A967948260 "Animals in the lab: Protests accelerate, but use is dropping"], ''The New York Times'', October 27, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; William Raub and Joe Held, officials at NIH, wrote in the ''Neuroscience Newsletter'' in April 1983 that deafferented monkeys kept at NIH since May 1981, and subjected to the same surgical procedures, had not developed lesions comparable to those in five of the deafferented monkeys from Taub's lab. "Based on these observations," they wrote, "it would appear that fractures, dislocations, lacerations, punctures, contusions, and abrasions with accompanying infection, acute and chronic inflammation, and [[necrosis]] are not the inevitable consequences of deafferentation."&lt;ref name="Schwartz149" /&gt; After the appeal, according to Doidge writing in 2007, 67 professional societies made representations on Taub's behalf, and the NIH reversed its decision not to fund his research.&lt;ref&gt;Doidge 2007, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 neuroscientist [[David Hubel]], referring to both the Silver Spring monkeys case and a [[Unnecessary Fuss|PETA film]] about the University of Pennsylvania's head injury clinic in 1984, said the science was sound, that the people involved were not cruel, and that at the time there was a "laxness of standards" in animal care that, he wrote, would hardly be conceivable today.&lt;ref&gt;Hubel, David. [http://hubel.med.harvard.edu/papers/Arewewillingtofight.pdf "Are we willing to fight for our research?"], ''Annual Review of Neuroscience'', vol 14, 1991, accessed December 12, 2010; {{doi|10.1146/annurev.ne.14.030191.000245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials and appeal==

===First trial (October 1981)===
According to Peter Carlson, every aspect of the case was disputed by experts on both sides during the first trial in October 1981. The prosecution said that Taub's lab was filthy and unhealthy, and federal inspection reports and witnesses supported the charge. Taub said the lab was no dirtier than any other, and he also produced federal inspection reports and witnesses to support his position. Veterinarians speaking for the prosecution said Taub's failure to bandage the monkeys' wounds was a threat to their health; veterinarians for the defense, including two who had worked with monkeys whose limbs had been deafferented, said bandaging them would cause the animals to attack the limbs. Carlson writes that the prosecution produced 70 photographs of dirty conditions and injured monkeys, while researchers who had worked in the lab testified for the defense that they had never seen the lab looking like that. The judge—District Court Judge Stanley Klavan—found Taub guilty of six counts of cruelty to animals for failing to provide adequate veterinary care in respect of six of the monkeys, and acquitted him of the other 11 charges against him. He fined Taub $3,000. The laboratory assistant, John Kunz, was acquitted of all 17 charges.&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt;

===Second trial and appeal (1982 and 1983)===
Taub managed to secure a second trial in June 1982. After three weeks at the Montgomery County Circuit Court, a jury acquitted him of five of the convictions, and upheld the sixth charge of inadequate veterinary care of Nero, whose wounds were such that an NIH veterinarian later amputated his deafferented arm. Taub was fined $500. The sixth charge was set aside on appeal, when the court ruled that Maryland's Prevention of Cruelty to Animals law did not apply to federally funded laboratories.&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt;

==Fight for custody==
After the monkeys were returned to Taub's custody, they were transferred to an NIH facility.&lt;ref name=Sideris&gt;Sideris, Lisa; McCarthy, Charles; and Smith, David H. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080603111554/http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/40_1/40_1Roots.shtml "Roots of Concern with Nonhuman Animals in Biomedical Ethics"], ''ILAR Journal'', volume 40, issue 1, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; They were later removed to the Tulane Regional Primate Research Center in Covington, Louisiana, still under the care and control of the NIH.&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Post'', January 5, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Two primate sanctuaries, Moorpark College in California and Primarily Primates in Texas, offered them a permanent home, but the NIH refused to release them.&lt;ref name=Barnard&gt;Barnard ND et al.

They were moved by the NIH to the Delta Primate Center in June 1986, where animal rights activists, who had been able to visit and groom the animals at the previous center, were told they could no longer see them.&lt;ref name=Reinhold&gt;Reinhold, Robert.

A lawsuit filed by PETA and others sought to block euthanasia and transfer the animals to a facility under their control. The New England Anti-Vivisection Society and PETA ran ads in ''The New York Times'' on December 26, 1989, ''The Washington Post'' on December 27, and in ''The Washington Times'' on January 3, 1990, asking President Bush to save the monkeys, and concerned citizens to petition the White House. After the court denied custody to PETA, two of the monkeys, Titus and Allen, were kept for the National Institutes of Health at a Tulane University primate center, where they were later euthanized.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Warren E.

==Final experiments and euthanasia==
[[Image:Homunculus-de.svg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Homunculus|homunculi]] showing which parts of the body are controlled by the [[sensory cortex]] and [[motor cortex]]. Taub's research on the Silver Spring monkeys challenged the [[paradigm]] that brain functions are fixed in certain locations.]]
The [[NIH]] had said in 1987 that no further invasive research would be conducted on the monkeys, but in fact further experiments were performed on them in 1990. NIH presented the experiments in the lawsuit for custody of the animals in 1989. It proposed to perform deep surgical anesthesia during all procedures followed by euthanasia. After euthanasia, tissue examination would continue.&lt;ref name=Barnard/&gt; The court allowed a group of researchers from the NIH to conduct a terminal experiment on January 14, 1990 on one of the monkeys who had become ill. Under anesthesia, electrodes were placed in his brain and hundreds of recordings taken. The ''Laboratory Primate Newsletter'' said it revealed an "unprecedented degree of reorganization of the sensory cortex. An 8&amp;ndash;10-millimeter-wide area that would normally receive input from the hand was found to have completely filled in with input from the face." Brainmapping studies were conducted on the remaining monkeys on July 6, 1990, three days after PETA's application for custody was rejected. The monkeys were subsequently euthanized.&lt;ref name=Newsletter29&gt;''Laboratory Primate Newsletter'', Volume 29, Number 2, October 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; During these experiments, scientists discovered an unpredicted change in thalamus structure apparently caused by progressive nerve degeneration through the [[dorsal root ganglia]] (which were severed) and the dorsal columns all the way to the [[thalamus]] (a second order synaptic target).&lt;ref&gt;Jones E.G. and Pons T.P. "Thalamic and brainstem contributions to large-scale plasticity of primate somatosensory cortex," ''Science'',  volume 282, issue 5391, 1998, pp. 1121–1125; {{PMID|9804550}}

==Constraint-induced movement therapy==
Based in part on his work with the Silver Spring monkeys, Taub went on to develop novel physical therapy techniques to help stroke victims, and those with other forms of brain injury, regain the use of affected limbs. The American Stroke Association regards Taub's therapy, known as [[constraint-induced movement therapy]] (CI), as "at the forefront of a revolution" in the treatment of stroke survivors.&lt;ref name=ASA&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.strokeassociation.org/STROKEORG/LifeAfterStroke/RegainingIndependence/PhysicalChallenges/Constraint-Induced-Movement-Therapy_UCM_309798_Article.jsp | title=Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy |type= excerpt from "A Rehab Revolution" 2004 | work=Stroke Connection Magazine |origyear=September/October 2004 |date= May 27, 2014 |accessdate= 2016-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With CI therapy, the patient is forced to use the affected limb, to whatever minimal extent he can, by having the unaffected one restrained. The affected limb is then used intensively for three to six hours each day for at least two weeks. As a result of engaging in repetitive movements with the affected limb, the brain grows [[Neuroplasticity|new neural pathways]] that control the limb's use, as a result of which stroke victims who were seriously disabled for many years have reportedly regained the use of limbs that were almost completely paralysed.&lt;ref name=ASA/&gt;

[[File:S Eustachio - teatro Argentina 1010120.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|The facade of Teatro Argentina]]
[[File:Pannini, Giovanni Paolo - Musical Fête - 1747.png|thumb|The Teatro Argentina ([[Giovanni Paolo Panini|Panini]], 1747, [[Musée du Louvre]])]]
The '''Teatro Argentina''' is an [[opera house]] and theatre located in [[Largo di Torre Argentina]], a square in [[Rome, Italy]]. One of the oldest theatres in Rome, it was constructed in 1731 and inaugurated on 31 January 1732&lt;ref name=PLANT&gt;Plantamura, 10&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[Berenice]]'' by [[Domenico Sarro]]. It is built over part of the curia section of the [[Theatre of Pompey]]. This curia was the location of the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]].

==History==
The house was commissioned by the Sforza-Cesarini family and designed by the architect [[Gerolamo Theodoli]] with the auditorium laid out in the traditional horseshoe shape. [[Duke Francesco Sforza-Cesarini]], who ran the Argentina Theatre from 1807 to 1815, was a "theatre fanatic" who continued until his death to run up debts.&lt;ref name=PLANT/&gt; [[Rossini]]'s ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' was given its premiere on 20 February 1816, just after Duke Francesco's death and, in the 19th century, the premieres of many notable operas took place in the theatre, including  [[Verdi]]'s ''[[I due Foscari]]'' on 3 November 1844 and ''[[La battaglia di Legnano]]'' on 27 January 1849.&lt;ref name=PLANT/&gt;

From 1919 to 1944, more musical offerings than dramatic ones were presented, although the theatre premiered works by [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Maxim Gorky]] during this time. As well, a series of operas was presented in the winter of 1944-45 in honor of the American and British troops.

The venue was used for classical-music recordings by the Santa Cecilia orchestra in the 1950s. 

In 1994, the theatre became the home of the [[Teatro Stabile]] company of Rome, currently directed by Mario Martone. It offers a variety of programmes, some being large-scale productions, although more plays than music or opera are presented today.

==Technical information==
The inside of the theatre is constructed of wood with six levels of boxes characterizing the design, and has been restored many times.{{sfn|Landriani|1830|pp=162–163}} It seats 696 people, including 344 in the stalls and with 40 boxes on five levels seating an additional 352.&lt;ref&gt;Technical information pdf on the theatre's website&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantamura notes that the theatre's acoustics were regarded as being excellent and that the architect who designed the [[La Fenice]] opera house in Venice, [[Gianantonio Selva]], modeled his design after the Argentina.&lt;ref name=PLANT/&gt;

|}

==In popular culture==
In the novel ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas]], the Teatro Argentina was the setting for an important scene during a performance of ''[[Parisina (opera)|Parisina]]'' by [[Gaetano Donizetti]].

'''Tristan Foison''' (born 6 November 1961)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.https://www.tobias-broeker.de/research-effects/tristan-foison-vc/|title=20th century violin concertante&amp;nbsp;– Tristan Foison|work=tobias-broeker.de|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819141428/http://https/|archivedate=19 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a French musician and composer. He is most famous for attempting to claim a composition by [[Alfred Desenclos]] as his own, but actually fabricated many details about his life.

==Early life==
Foison was born and raised in France. He was adopted by Michele Foison, a professional musician and student of [[Olivier Messiaen]]. He learned to play the Ondes Martenot and later tried to study it at the Conservatoire de Paris, but was rejected. Tristan Foison then studied first at the Conservatoire à Rayonnement Régional de Boulogne-Billancourt and from 1985 at the Conservatoire Saint-Maur-des-Fossés. He now lives near Paris.&lt;ref&gt;"The Atlanta Journal Constitution" from 29. July 2001: ''A classical puzzle&amp;nbsp;– Accused of stealing another composer's work, Tristan Foison takes another enigmatic turn" by Pierre Ruhe&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
He claimed to have won the [[Peabody Mason International Piano Competition]], the [[Geneva International Music Competition]] and the Georges Bizet Competition, as well as conducted orchestras including [[London Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[Prague Symphony Orchestra]] or the [[Orchestre de Paris]]. He also claimed to have been chosen by [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]] to perform with him the ''Concerto for 2 Pianos'' by [[Mozart]] with the [[Paris Orchestra]] in 1987. Later that year, he emigrated to the US and settled in [[Atlanta]]. He made his living as a musician, worked at the Peggy Still School of Music and was music director of the [[Rome Symphony Orchestra]] in [[Rome, Georgia]]. He performed in concerts on the piano and the [[Ondes Martenot]] and composed [[classical music]].&lt;ref&gt;article "Tristan Foison to give recital" in the ''Rome News Tribune'' from 17. September 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;article "Symphony works on challenges" by Amy Knowles in the ''Rome News Tribune'' from 12. Oktober 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;article "Dr. Tristan S. Foison" in the ''Rome News Tribune'' from 08. July 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compositions===
* ''Suite Liturgique'', for chorus (won the ''Prix Maurice Ravel'' in Paris)
* ''La Foret'', opera
* ''Requiem'', for chorus
* ''Violin Concerto''

==The "Desenclos Incident"==
On 18 May 1999 the ''Requiem'' by Tristan Foison was performed by the [[Capitol Hill Chorale]] of Washington, D.C. and was marked as the world premiere of the composition, which Tristan Foison claimed to have written. The ''Requiem'' was recognised immediately in the concert as [[plagiarism]], because a person from the audience had sung the work a year earlier with his chorus and knew that it was composed by French composer [[Alfred Desenclos]]. After verification, Foison was confronted by the choral director. Shortly after this talk he vanished from the classical music scene.&lt;ref name="philipkennicott"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2001/06/07/a-composers-too-familiar-refrain/bf1c5bbd-b261-42d8-9649-795f6e093c9d/|title=A Composer's Too-Familiar Refrain|author=Philip Kennicott|date=7 June 2001|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; All known biographical information comes from his [[curriculum vitae]].

===Aftermath===
After the discovery of the Desenclos fraud, journalists checked his CV. They found that the following other claims were false:

* He took part at the 1980 International Piano Competition Ferruccio Busoni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concorsobusoni.it/en/hall-of-fame?y=1980&amp;ya=1980|title=Hall of Fame|work=concorsobusoni_2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* He took part at the 37th Prague Spring International Music Competition in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;private message from the Prague Spring Competition to Tobias Broeker (www.tobias-broeker.de) on 14 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
* He won the [[Prix de Rome]].
* He studied with conductor [[Robert Shaw (conductor)|Robert Shaw]].&lt;ref name="philipkennicott"/&gt;
* He wrote the violin concerto actually written by French composer [[Raymond Gallois-Montbrun]], in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tobias-broeker.de/research-effects/tristan-foison-vc/|title=20th century violin concertante&amp;nbsp;– Tristan Foison|work=tobias-broeker.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''Maddox'' (DD-731)''', an {{Sclass-|Allen M. Sumner|destroyer}} was named for [[Captain (U.S. Marine Corps)|Captain]] [[William A. T. Maddox]], of the [[United States Marine Corps]]. She was [[Keel laying|laid down]] by the [[Bath Iron Works]] Corporation at [[Bath, Maine|Bath]] in [[Maine]] on 28 October 1943, [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 19 March 1944 by Mrs. Harry H. Wilhoit, granddaughter of Captain Maddox, and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 2 June 1944.

''Maddox'' screened the ships of the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] during strikes against enemy targets in the western Pacific where she was struck by an enemy Japanese ''[[kamikaze]]'' aircraft off [[Taiwan|Formosa]] on 21 January 1945. She also covered the Marine landings at [[Okinawa]], and operated with the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]] in support of [[United Nations]] Forces during the [[Korean War]]. ''Maddox'' participated in the [[Blockade of Wonsan]], an 861-day siege bombardment of the city.

After 1953, she alternated operations along the west coast of the United States and in [[Hawaii]]an waters, with regular deployments to the western Pacific with the Seventh Fleet. ''Maddox'' departed [[Long Beach Naval Shipyard|Long Beach]] 13 March 1964. At first steaming with fast carrier groups in the [[Sea of Japan]] and the [[East China Sea]], she headed south 18 May and established patrol off the coast of [[South Vietnam]]. During August she was involved in a skirmish with North Vietnamese torpedo boats, the [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident|''Maddox'' incident]], which led to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and increased U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].

==Service history==

=== World War II ===
Following shakedown and antisubmarine exercises, ''Maddox'' departed [[Boston]] on 27 August for [[Norfolk, Virginia]] en route to the Pacific. Arriving at [[Ulithi]] 21 October 1944, she was assigned to Fast Carrier TG 38.1 of the [[United States Third Fleet|3d Fleet]]. As a member of this task group, ''Maddox'' took part in the preparation and the covering operations for the [[Mindoro]] and [[Luzon]] invasions, 4 November 1944 to 21 January 1945. During this period she served in the screen and on picket station in the South and East China Seas, while carrier-based planes [[South China Sea raid|struck air and naval bases]] from [[Saigon]] to [[Formosa]]. Hit by a ''kamikaze'' off Formosa on 21 January 1945, ''Maddox'' headed for [[Ulithi]] for repairs. Departing on 14 March, the destroyer steamed off the Japanese home islands where she was on [[Radar picket|picket]] station during the air strikes on [[Kyushu]] and southern [[Honshu]]. She proceeded to Okinawa on 23 March to provide support for preinvasion strikes, remaining on duty there after the invasion date of 1 April. For almost three months, until 13 June 1945, ''Maddox'' continued to provide support for this campaign in the form of shore bombardment and carrier screening for raids on Kyushu and [[Shikoku]].

On 8 July, ''Maddox'' sailed from [[Leyte]] to participate in the operations of the third Fleet off the islands of [[Honshu]] and [[Hokkaido]]. From 10 July until the cessation of offensive action 15 August, she provided screening, picket, and shore bombardment services.

Following the Japanese surrender, ''Maddox'' continued to patrol off Japan until departing [[Tokyo Bay]] 20 September with military passengers for the United States. Delivering her passengers to San Francisco on 5 October, she proceeded to [[San Diego]], arriving on the 14th. She operated there until 1 February 1946, when she returned to the Far East to support the movement of naval occupation forces between [[Shanghai]], [[Tsingtao]], and Taku in China, and the ports of [[Pusan]] and [[Jinsen]] in Korea.

===Korean War===
Returning to San Diego 24 March 1947, she operated for the next three years off the west coast conducting reserve training cruises, serving as a [[training ship]] in antisubmarine warfare and gunnery and participating in maneuvers with the 1st Task Fleet.

On 1 May 1950, ''Maddox'' departed San Diego for the Far East, arriving Hong Kong 26 June, the day after the commencement of hostilities in [[Korea]]. Departing for South Korea the next day, she acted as [[plane guard]] and antisubmarine screen for the [[aircraft carrier]]s {{USS|Valley Forge|CV-45|6}} and {{HMS|Triumph|R16|6}}. She operated there until August, when she departed for Formosa. On 4 May, she helped form the initial Formosa (later Taiwan) Patrol Force to prevent [[People's Republic of China|Communist Chinese]] invasion of Taiwan.

''Maddox'' returned to Korea 7 September and assumed coastal blockade and bombardment duties. She continued this assignment, which included a diversionary bombardment of [[Samchok]] coordinated with the [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon landings]] on 15 September, until departing for the United States early in January 1951. Arriving at San Diego on 31 January 1951, she served as a training ship and underwent overhaul before departing 1 December 1951 for her second Korean duty. Through February 1952, she screened carriers off the east coast of Korea and provided shore bombardment support for the U.N. land forces. During March she operated with the Taiwan Patrol Force, returning to Korea in April. From 16 April through 17 May she participated in the siege of Wonsan, following which she resumed screening duties for fast carriers.

In June ''Maddox'' returned to San Diego, arriving on 26 June, to stay only one month before departing for her new home port of [[Long Beach Naval Shipyard|Long Beach]]. After local operations and overhaul, ''Maddox'' again sailed for the Far East on 2 February 1953. As on her second Korean deployment, the destroyer again guarded the fast carriers along the eastern coast of Korea; participated in shore bombardments, this time as far north as [[Hungnam]], and served, for a two-week period, in the Taiwan Patrol Force. After completing her 1953 Korean tour on 12 August she departed for Long Beach, arriving on 30 August.

===1954—1964===
''Maddox'' operated off the west coast until the next spring. (''Maddox'' is featured in the Hollywood film ''Return from the Sea'', released by Allied Artists in 1954.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Return from the Sea|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047405/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May 1954, she sailed for duty with the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]]. On this tour, which lasted until 5 December, she took part in antisubmarine warfare tactics and attack carrier exercises off Kyushu, Korea, and Luzon as well as operating with the Taiwan Patrol Force.

From 14 June 1955 through 2 March 1962, ''Maddox'' completed six additional cruises to the Far East. These cruises included combined defense exercises with the forces of other [[SEATO]] nations and training operations with South Korean, [[Republic of China Navy|Nationalist Chinese]], and [[Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force]]s.

Having operated off the west coast for two years, from March 1962, ''Maddox'' departed Long Beach 13 March 1964 for another tour with the 7th Fleet. At first steaming with fast carrier groups in the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea, she headed south 18 May and established patrol off the coast of South Vietnam.

=== Gulf of Tonkin incident ===
{{Main|Gulf of Tonkin incident}}
On 31 July 1964 she commenced her first leg of a [[DESOTO patrol]] in the [[Tonkin Gulf]]. Initially a routine patrol, it later developed into a naval action with global repercussions. On 2 August 1964, ''Maddox'', cruising in international waters 28 miles off the coast of [[North Vietnam]], engaged three North Vietnamese Navy (NVN) [[P 4-class torpedo boat|P4]] [[motor torpedo boats]], from Torpedo Squadron 135.&lt;ref&gt;Moise, p. 70, 78&lt;/ref&gt; The P4s, {{convert|66|ft|m|adj=on}} long aluminum-hulled torpedo boats each armed with two torpedoes which mounted a {{convert|550|lb|kg|abbr=on}} [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] warhead&lt;ref&gt;Moise, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; and capable of exceeding {{convert|40|kn}}, approached at high speeds from several miles away.  The commander of the 7th Fleet's Destroyer Division 192, Captain [[John J. Herrick]],&lt;ref&gt;Moise, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; who was aboard ''Maddox'' in charge of the mission, ordered the ship's captain (Commander Herbert Ogier) to have gun crews fire upon the torpedo boats if they came within {{convert|10,000|yd|m}}. When they did, the American sailors fired three rounds to warn off the North Vietnamese boats.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, Mike. "[http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2004/1/2004_1_45.shtml Anatomy of a Crisis]" ''American Heritage'', March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The NVN torpedo boats were commanded by three brothers: Van Bot commanded boat ''T-333'', Van Tu commanded ''T-336'', and ''T-339'' was commanded by Van Gian.&lt;ref&gt;Moise, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;  The torpedo boats initially conducted their attack in numerical order, with ''T-333'' spearheading the assault.  Maximum effective range for their torpedoes was {{convert|1,000|yd|m}},&lt;ref name="Moise, p. 79"&gt;Moise, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; but ''Maddox''{{'}}s 5-inch gun's range was {{convert|18,000|yd|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;Moise, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  As the boats pressed home their attack and came within {{convert|5,000|yd|m}}, ''T-333'' attempted to run abeam of ''Maddox'' for a side shot, while the remaining two boats continued their stern chase.  The two chasers, ''T-336'' and ''T-339'', fired first, but due to ''Maddox''{{'}}s heavy fire of 5-inch shells, the torpedo boats had discharged their torpedoes at excessive range, all four underwater missiles missing their mark.  ''T-333'' fired its torpedoes, without effect, but dueled ''Maddox''{{'}}s 5-inch guns with its twin {{convert|14.5|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} [[machine gun]], achieving one hit on the destroyer.&lt;ref name="Moise, p. 79"/&gt; The ship altered her course to avoid the torpedoes, which were observed passing on the starboard side.  Soon, four [[F-8 Crusader]]s from an aircraft carrier in the region, {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|6}}, arrived on the scene and attacked the three torpedo boats. The combination of fire from ''Maddox'' and the F-8s severely damaged all three boats, and forced them to retreat to the bases from which they came. Several NVN sailors were wounded, and four were killed. No US sailors were killed or wounded, and ''Maddox'' did not sustain serious damage;{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} one of the four Crusaders sustained some 14.5&amp;nbsp;mm machine gun fire hits, as a large portion of its left wing was "missing",&lt;ref&gt;Moise, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; but managed to return to ''Ticonderoga''.

On 4 August, another DESOTO patrol off the North Vietnamese coast was launched by ''Maddox'' and {{USS|Turner Joy}}, in order to "show the flag" after the first incident. This time their orders indicated that the ships were to close to no more than {{convert|11|mi|km}} from the coast of North Vietnam.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon3/pent4.htm Pentagon Papers]&lt;/ref&gt; During an evening and early morning of rough weather and heavy seas, the destroyers received radar, sonar, and radio signals that they believed signaled another attack by the North Vietnamese navy. For some two hours the ships fired on radar targets and maneuvered vigorously amid electronic and visual reports of enemies.  At 0127 [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] time, Herrick sent a cable in which he admitted that the attack may never have happened and that there may actually have been no North Vietnamese craft in the area: "Review of action makes many reported contacts and torpedoes fired appear doubtful. Freak weather effects on radar and overeager sonarmen may have accounted for many reports. No actual visual sightings by ''Maddox''. Suggest complete evaluation before any further action taken." Since then, numerous accounts have supported the theory that there was no attack on 4 August at all, including North Vietnamese military commander [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]], who in 1995 admitted 2 August attack but asserted that the 4 August attack had never occurred.

=== Vietnam War ===
After arrival at Long Beach, ''Maddox'' remained in a leave and upkeep status until mid‑January 1965, then conducted training exercises and repairs in preparation for her next WestPac deployment. She departed Long Beach on 10 July and commenced operating with the fast carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin in early August. For the next four months, ''Maddox'' alternated duty with the carriers with gunfire support missions off the coast of South Vietnam. At the end of November she sailed for home, arriving at Long Beach 16 December.

After conducting upkeep and local exercises off the California coast, summer 1966 saw her engaged in a training cruise for midshipmen which included a trip to [[Pearl Harbor]]. ''Maddox'' departed California 20 November for another deployment with the 7th Fleet, sailing by way of Pearl Harbor, [[Midway Atoll|Midway]], [[Guam]], and Taiwan.

After a successful tour consisting primarily of providing gunfire support, interrupted by a visit to [[Singapore]] and a crossing of the [[Equator]] on 8 February 1967, ''Maddox'' departed [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]], [[Philippine Islands]], for home by way of Australia, New Zealand, and Pearl Harbor. She arrived at Long Beach 7 June 1967 and conducted local exercises until entering Long Beach Naval Shipyard 13 October for overhaul. She remained in overhaul until February 1968; then, after refresher training off the west coast, departed for WestPac 5 July.  After completion of overhaul and type training, ''Maddox'' once again deployed to the Far East in July 1968, returning in December 1968 to her home port, Long Beach, for overhaul and upkeep. ''Maddox'' was decommissioned in 1969 and assigned to the [[Naval Reserve Force]]. She was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 2 July 1972.

''Maddox'' received four battle stars for World War II service, and six for Korean service.

===Republic of China Navy===

On 6 July 1972 she was transferred to [[Taiwan]], commissioned into the [[Republic of China Navy]], and renamed ''Bo Yang'' and served with the Naval Weapons school. The ship was decommissioned and scrapped in 1985.

'''''Unnecessary Fuss''''' is a film produced by [[Ingrid Newkirk]] and [[Alex Pacheco (activist)|Alex Pacheco]] of [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA), showing footage shot inside the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s Head Injury Clinic in Philadelphia.

The footage was shot in 1983–1984 by the researchers themselves as they inflicted brain damage on baboons  with a hydraulic device.&lt;ref&gt;The video footage released by PETA can be viewed at:
*[http://www.animalliberationfront.com/MediaCenter/UnnFuss.wmv Part 1] *[http://www.animalliberationfront.com/MediaCenter/UnnFuss00.wmv Part 2] *[http://www.animalliberationfront.com/MediaCenter/UnnFuss01.wmv Part 3] *[http://www.animalliberationfront.com/MediaCenter/UnnFuss02.wmv Part 4] *[http://www.animalliberationfront.com/MediaCenter/UnnFuss03.wmv Part 5]&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments were conducted as part of a research project into head injuries caused by vehicle and sports accidents. The footage shows the researchers laughing at the baboons as the brain damage is inflicted.&lt;ref&gt;Carbone, Larry. ''What Animals Want: Expertise and Advocacy in Laboratory Animal Welfare Policy''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2004, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sixty hours of audio- and videotape were removed from the laboratory during a raid in May 1984 by the [[Animal Liberation Front]], who handed it over to PETA. It was subsequently edited down to 26 minutes with a voice-over commentary by Newkirk, before being distributed to the media and Congress. Charles McCarthy, director of the Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR) wrote that the film had overstated the deficiencies in the clinic, but that the OPRR had found serious violations of the [[Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals]].&lt;ref name=oprr/&gt; As a result of the publicity, the lab was closed, the chief veterinarian fired, and the university placed on probation.

The title of the film comes from a statement made to ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' by the head of the clinic, neurosurgeon Thomas Gennarelli before the raid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcw.edu/display/router.asp?docid=1673 "Neurosurgery chair, Thomas Gennarelli M.D.], [[University of Wisconsin]].&lt;/ref&gt; He declined to describe his research to the newspaper because, he said, it had "the potential to stir up all sorts of unnecessary fuss ..."&lt;ref&gt;Palango, Paul. ''Globe and Mail'', March 6, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deborah Blum]] writes that "it is difficult to put into words just how ugly [this] brief movie is."&lt;ref name=Blum118&gt;Blum, Deborah. ''Monkey Wars'', [[Oxford University Press]], paperback edition 1995, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The film shows at least one sedated but not anesthetized baboon with his wrists and ankles tied, strapped to an operating table, his shaved head secured with dental cement inside a helmet. A hydraulic device known as Penn 2 slams the baboon's head from behind, pushing it forward at a 60-degree angle with a force of what the researchers said was up to 1000 ''[[g-force|''g'']]'', apparently intended to simulate whiplash.&lt;ref name=Newkirk193&gt;[[Ingrid Newkirk|Newkirk, Ingrid]]. ''Free the Animals''. Lantern Books, 2000, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sideris&gt;Sideris, Lisa, McCarthy, Charles, &amp; Smith, David H.

After the injury is sustained, the baboon's head is dislodged from the helmet using a hammer and screwdriver. One sequence shows part of the baboon's ear being torn off along with the helmet. After pulling the baboon's head from the helmet, the researcher is heard to laugh, saying: "It's a boy," then, "Looks like I left a little ear behind."&lt;ref name=Newkirk194&gt;[[Ingrid Newkirk|Newkirk, Ingrid]]. ''Free the Animals''. Lantern Books, 2000, pp. 194–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

The footage shows the researchers laughing at injured baboons, performing [[Cauterization|electrocautery]] on an apparently conscious baboon, smoking cigarettes and pipes during surgery, and playing loud music as the animals are injured. A researcher is seen holding a seriously injured baboon up to the camera, while others speak to the animal: "Don't be shy now, sir, nothing to be afraid of," followed by laughter, and "He says, 'you're gonna rescue me from this, aren't you? Aren't you?'," followed by more laughter.&lt;ref name=Blum118/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newkirk194/&gt;

While one baboon was being injured on the operating table by the hydraulic device, the camera panned to a brain-damaged, drooling monkey strapped into a high chair in a corner of the room, with the words "Cheerleading in the corner, we have B-10. B-10 wishes his counterpart well. As you can see, B-10 is still alive. B-10 is hoping for a good result," followed by laughter. In another sequence, one researcher is heard to say: "You better hope the ... anti-vivisection people don't get a hold of this film." &lt;ref name=Newkirk196&gt;[[Ingrid Newkirk|Newkirk, Ingrid]]. ''Free the Animals''. Lantern Books, 2000, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

==OPRR investigation==
An investigation was conducted by 18 veterinarians from the [[American College of Laboratory Animal Medicine]], commissioned by the Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR). Charles R. McCarthy, director of the OPRR at the time, wrote that "[d]espite the fact that ''Unnecessary Fuss'' grossly overstated the deficiencies in the Head Injury Clinic, OPRR found many extraordinarily serious violations of the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals ... Furthermore, OPRR found deficiencies in the procedures for care of animals in many other laboratories operated under the auspices of the university."&lt;ref name=oprr/&gt;

The violations included that the depth of anaesthetic coma was questionable; that most of the animals were not seen by a veterinarian either before or after surgery, survival surgical techniques were not carried out in the required aseptic manner; that the operating theater was not properly cleaned; and that smoking was allowed in the operating theater despite the presence of oxygen tanks.&lt;ref name=Sideris/&gt;&lt;ref name=McCarthy/&gt;

When PETA made its 26-minute film available, the OPRR initially refused to investigate because the film had been edited from 60 hours of videotape. For over a year PETA refused to release the original footage. When they eventually handed over the unedited material, the OPRR discovered that the footage of the brain damage being inflicted involved just one baboon out of the 150 who had received the Penn 2 injuries. The film gave the impression that the brain-damage scenes involved several animals.&lt;ref name=oprr&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070423073833/http://onlineethics.org/reseth/nbac/hmccarthy.html Ethical and Policy Issues in Research Involving Human Participants (Internet Archive copy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The OPRR identified 25 errors in Newkirk's voice-over commentary. One example was where an accidental water spill over a conscious baboon during a surgical procedure was identified, incorrectly, by one of the Head Injury Clinic's researchers, and subsequently by Newkirk, as "perhaps acid."&lt;ref name=Sideris/&gt;&lt;ref name=UN&gt;*[[Ingrid Newkirk|Newkirk, Ingrid]] &amp; [[Alex Pacheco (animal rights)|Pacheco, Alex]].

==Sit-in and clinic's closure==
Animal-rights activists held a three-day sit-in at the [[National Institutes of Health]]. [[Margaret Heckler]], then [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services]] secretary, supported closing the clinic. The government concluded that the violations seen on the footage were sufficient to justify the clinic's closure.&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;McCarthy, Charles. R.

The university's chief veterinarian was fired, new training programs were initiated, and the university was placed on probation, with quarterly progress reports to OPRR required.

{{VG history|expandmenu=1}}

The '''video game crash of 1983''' &lt;!-- it should be noted that the title "American"/"North American" is not used in any other language for this article--&gt; (known as the '''Atari shock''' in [[Japan]]) was a large-scale [[recession]] in the [[video game industry]] that occurred from 1983 to 1985, primarily in [[North America]]. The crash was attributed to several factors, including [[market saturation]] in the number of game consoles and available games, and waning interest in console games in favor of personal computers. Revenues peaked at around $3.2 billion in 1983, then fell to around $100 million by 1985 (a drop of almost 97 percent). The crash was a serious event that brought an abrupt end to what is retrospectively considered the [[History of video game consoles (second generation)|second generation]] of [[console game|console video gaming]] in North America.

The crash shook the then-booming industry, and led to the bankruptcy of several companies producing [[home computer]]s and [[video game console]]s in the region. It lasted about two years. Analysts of the time expressed doubts about the long-term viability of [[video game console]]s and software. The North American video game console industry recovered a few years later, mostly due to the widespread success of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in {{vgy|1985}}; Nintendo designed the NES as the Western branding for its Famicom console originally released in 1983 to avoid the missteps that caused the 1983 crash and avoid the stigma that video games had at that time.

== Causes and factors ==
[[File:Atari-2600-Wood-4Sw-Set.jpg|thumb|Atari 2600, the most popular console prior to the crash.]]
=== Prior history ===
Prior to 1982, the most significant home console was the [[Atari 2600]], along with numerous dedicated single-game consoles such as variants of ''Pong''. The Atari 2600 was launched in 1977, but in its first few years, had modest sales. In 1980, Atari created a licensed version of ''[[Space Invaders (arcade game)|Space Invaders]]'' from [[Taito]], which became known as the [[killer application]] for the console; sales of the Atari 2600 quadrupled, and the game was the first title to sell more than a million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ultimate History of Video Games |first=Steven |last=Kent |page=190 |publisher=[[Three Rivers Press]] |isbn=0-7615-3643-4 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weiss |first=Brett |title=Classic home video games, 1972–1984: a complete reference guide |year=2007 |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]] |location=Jefferson, N.C. |isbn=0-7864-3226-8 |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flooded console market ===
Spurred by Atari's success, there were many consoles introduced on the market, including the Atari 2600, [[Atari 5200]], [[ColecoVision]], [[Magnavox Odyssey²|Odyssey²]] and the [[Intellivision]]. In addition to this, Mattel and Coleco created devices that allowed them to play Atari&amp;nbsp;2600 games on their consoles, and others created Atari 2600/Intellivision clones such as the [[Coleco Gemini]], the [[Sears]] Tele-Games systems ([[Private label|private-labeled]] versions of the Atari 2600 and Intellivision), and Tandyvision (an Intellivision clone for [[Radio Shack]]).

Each of these consoles had its own library of games produced by the console maker, and many had large libraries of games produced by third-party developers. In 1982, analysts noticed trends of saturation, mentioning that the amount of new software coming in will only allow a few big hits, that retailers had too much floor space for systems, along with price drops for home computers could result in an industry shakeup.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Robert S. (Dec 12, 1982). "Home Video Games Are Coming Under a Strong Attack". ''[[The Gainesville Sun|Gainesville Sun]]''. Retrieved from https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&amp;dat=19821212&amp;id=L2tWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=q-kDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1609,4274079&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the rapid growth of the video game industry led to an increased demand for video games, but which the manufacturers over-projected. An analyst for [[Goldman Sachs]] had stated in 1983 that the demand for video games was up 100% from 1982, but the manufacturing output increased by 175%, creating a surplus in the market.&lt;ref name="nytimes 1983"/&gt; [[Raymond Kassar]], the CEO of Atari, had recognized in 1982 that there would become a point of saturation for the industry, but did not expect this to occur until about half of American households had a video game console; at the time, only about 15 million machines had been sold, far below this expected point.&lt;ref name="nytimes 1983"/&gt;

=== Competition from home computers ===
{{see also|History of personal computers}}
[[File:Commodore-64-Computer-FL.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Commodore 64]] survived the crash and went on to become one of the best selling computers of all time.]]
The first microcomputers such as the [[Altair 8800]] and [[Apple I]] were marketed to a niche of electronics hobbyists as most required assembly from a kit. In 1977, factory-assembled machines with [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] in ROM became available, including the "Trio of '77": the [[Apple II]], [[Commodore PET]], and [[TRS-80 Model I]]. The latter two retailed for under $1,000, but lacked game joysticks and high-resolution color video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/PETx/petfaq.html|title=Commodore PET FAQ|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914113247/http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/PETx/petfaq.html|archivedate=September 14, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-party developers created games for all of these platforms. The TRS-80 benefited from Radio Shack's retail stores, which displayed computers and accessories locally in an era where many personal computers were mail-ordered from manufacturers.

In 1979, Atari unveiled the Atari 400 and 800 computers, built around a chipset originally meant for use in a game console, and which retailed for the same price as their respective names. In 1981, [[IBM]] introduced the [[IBM 5150]] PC with a $1,565 base price&lt;ref name="ibmpc25"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/pc25/pc25_birth.html|title=IBM Archives: The birth of the IBM PC|date=January 23, 2003|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102212336/http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/pc25/pc25_birth.html|archivedate=January 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Inflation|US|1565|1981|fmt=eq}}), while [[Sinclair Research]] introduced its low-end [[ZX81]] microcomputer for [[GBP|£]]70 ({{Inflation|UK|70|1981|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}).  By {{vgy|1982}}, new desktop computer designs were commonly providing better color graphics and sound than game consoles and personal computer sales were booming. The [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A|TI 99/4A]] and the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 400]] were both at $349 ({{Inflation|US|349|1982|fmt=eq}}), [[Radio Shack]]'s [[Tandy Color Computer|Color Computer]] sold at $379 ({{Inflation|US|379|1982|fmt=eq}}), and [[Commodore International]] had just reduced the price of the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]] to $199 ({{Inflation|US|199|1982|fmt=eq}}) and the [[Commodore 64|64]] to $499 ({{Inflation|US|499|1982|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref name="Ahl"&gt;Ahl, David H.

By 1983, consumers found that most predicted uses of home computers were unrealistic, except for games. Children used most home computers{{r|mitchell19830906}}—Coleco planned to market its [[Coleco Adam|Adam]] home computer to "boys age 8 to 16 and their fathers ... the two groups that really fuel computer purchases"&lt;ref name="coleco19830928"&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg_I9TGYM-w |title=Coleco Presents The Adam Computer System |date=May 3, 2016 |orig-year=1983-09-28 |time=44:30 |quote=We're doing that with five new television commercials, which have just been completed, and which will be shown in conjunction with the Adam launch date.

We believe those are the two groups that really fuel computer purchases, [boos] and we've directed right at 'em [more boos] - oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Women, we've a commercial for you, trust me, but the key point is that our research, which is consumer research, directed that thought [inaudible] from the research, and we've directed our commercials at that target user group. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103132547/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg_I9TGYM-w |archivedate=January 3, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;—so games dominated home computers' software libraries. A 1984 compendium of reviews of Atari 8-bit software used 198 pages for games compared to 167 for all other software types.&lt;ref name="aw1984"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/Atari_Software_1984#page/n3/mode/2up |title=The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |author1=Stanton, Jeffrey |author2=Wells, Robert P. |author3=Rochowansky, Sandra |author4=Mellin, Michael |pages=TOC |isbn=020116454X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because computers generally had more [[Computer storage|memory]] and faster [[central processing unit|processors]] than a console, they permitted more sophisticated games. They could also be used for tasks such as [[word processing]] and home accounting. Games were easier to duplicate, since they could be packaged as [[floppy disk]]s or [[cassette tape]]s instead of [[Read-Only Memory|ROM]] modules (though some cassette-based systems retained ROM modules as an "instant-on" option). This opened the field to a [[cottage industry]] of third-party software developers. Writeable storage media allowed players to save games in progress, a useful feature for increasingly complex games which was not available on the consoles of the era.

In 1982, a price war began between Commodore and Texas Instruments, and home computers became as inexpensive as video-game consoles;&lt;ref name="pollack19830619"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/19/business/the-coming-crisis-in-home-computers.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Coming Crisis in Home Computers |work=The New York Times |date=June 19, 1983 |accessdate=January 19, 2015 |author=Pollack, Andrew |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120040951/http://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/19/business/the-coming-crisis-in-home-computers.html?pagewanted=all |archivedate=January 20, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; after Commodore cut the retail price of the 64 to $300 in June 1983 some stores began selling it for as little as $199.{{r|mitchell19830906}} [[Dan Gutman]], founder in 1982 of ''Video Games Player'' magazine, recalled in 1987 that "As the first wave of the personal computer boom started, the video games market began to taper off. People asked themselves, 'Why should I buy a video game system when I can buy a computer that will play games and do so much more?'"{{r|gutman198712}} ''[[The Boston Phoenix]]'' stated in September 1983 about the cancellation of the [[Intellivision III]], "Who was going to pay $200-plus for a machine that could only play games?"&lt;ref name="mitchell19830906"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gn0hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tYoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5584%2C3561802 |title=A summer-CES report |work=Boston Phoenix |date=September 6, 1983 |accessdate=January 10, 2015 |author=Mitchell, Peter W. |pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commodore explicitly targeted video game players. Spokesman [[William Shatner]] asked in VIC-20 commercials "Why buy just a video game from Atari or Intellivision?", stating that "unlike games, it has a real computer keyboard" yet "plays great games too".&lt;ref name="cbmtvad"&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK9VU1aJvTI |title=Commodore VIC-20 ad with William Shatner |date=June 9, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406170423/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK9VU1aJvTI |archivedate=April 6, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company offered competitive upgrades, where rival systems could be traded for a discount toward the purchase of a Commodore 64. Commodore's ownership of chip fabricator [[MOS Technology]] allowed manufacture of [[integrated circuit]]s in-house, so the VIC-20 and C64 sold for much lower prices than competing home computers.

"I've been in retailing 30 years and I have never seen any category of goods get on a self-destruct pattern like this", a [[Service Merchandise]] executive told ''The New York Times'' in June 1983.{{r|pollack19830619}} The price war was so severe that in September Coleco CEO [[Arnold Greenberg (Coleco)|Arnold Greenberg]] welcomed rumors of an [[IBM PCjr|IBM 'Peanut']] home computer because "IBM is a company that knows how to make money". "I look back a year or two in the videogame field, or the home-computer field", Greenberg added, "how much better everyone was, when most people were making money, rather than very few".&lt;ref name="coleco19830928b"&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg_I9TGYM-w |title=Coleco Presents The Adam Computer System |date=May 3, 2016 |publisher=YouTube |orig-year=1983-09-28 |time=1:06:55 |quote=IBM is just not another strong company making a positive statement about the home-computer field's future.

By that year, Gutman wrote, "Video games were officially dead and computers were hot". He renamed his magazine ''Computer Games'' in October 1983, but "I noticed that the word ''games'' became a dirty word in the press. We started replacing it with ''simulations'' as often as possible". Soon "The computer slump began ... Suddenly, everyone was saying that the home computer was a fad, just another hula hoop". ''Computer Games'' published its last issue in late 1984.&lt;ref name="gutman198712"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/COMPUTEs_Apple_Applications_Vol._5_No._2_Issue_6_1987-12_COMPUTE_Publications_US#page/n65/mode/2up |title=The Fall And Rise of Computer Games |work=Compute!'s Apple Applications |date=December 1987 |accessdate=August 18, 2014 |author=Gutman, Dan |pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' founder Russell Sipe noted that "the arcade game crash of 1984 took down the majority of the [[Video game journalism|computer game magazines]] with it."

The U.S. game industry lobbied in Washington, D.C. for a smaller $1 coin, closer to the size of a quarter, arguing that inflation (which had reduced the quarter's spending power by a third in the early 1980s) was making it difficult to prosper.&lt;ref name=cernylong&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/196403/Video_Sonys_Mark_Cerny_gives_the_long_view_of_the_game_industry.php |author=Mark Cerny |title=The Long View |publisher=[[Game Developers Conference]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721161854/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/196403/Video_Sonys_Mark_Cerny_gives_the_long_view_of_the_game_industry.php |archivedate=July 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, the dollar coin in use was the [[Eisenhower dollar]], a large coin impractical for vending machines. The [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]] was introduced in 1979, and its size fit the video game manufacturers' demands, but it was a failure with the general public. Ironically, the new coin's similarity to the quarter was one of the most common complaints. In Canada, existing dollar bills were removed from circulation and [[loonie|replaced with coins]] in 1987.

Arcade machines in Japan had standardized the use of [[100 yen coin|¥100 coins]], worth roughly $1, which industry veteran [[Mark Cerny]] proposed as a reason for the stability of the game industry in Japan,&lt;ref name=cernylong /&gt; where the crash was known as the "Atari shock".&lt;ref name=downmany&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sh.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:213024/FULLTEXT01.pdf |title=Down Many Times, but Still Playing the Game: Creative Destruction and Industry Crashes in the Early Video Game Industry 1971-1986 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501201148/http://sh.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:213024/FULLTEXT01.pdf |archivedate=May 1, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loss of publishing control ===
In {{vgy|1979}}, [[Activision]] became the industry's first [[third-party developer]].{{r|mj19821226}} It was founded by Atari [[game programmer|programmers]] who left the company because Atari did not allow credits to appear on their games and did not pay employees a royalty based on sales. At the time, Atari was owned by [[Warner Communications]], and the developers felt that they should receive the same recognition that musicians, directors, and actors got from Warner's other divisions. After Activision went into business, Atari quickly sued to block sales of Activision's products, but failed to secure a [[restraining order]] and ultimately settled the case in {{vgy|1982}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0202/052.html |work=Forbes |first=Peter C. |last=Beller |title=Activision's Unlikely Hero |date=February 2, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806105646/https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0202/052.html |archivedate=August 6, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This court case legitimized third-party development, encouraging companies such as [[Quaker Oats]] (with their [[US Games]] division) to rush to open video-game divisions, hoping to impress both stockholders and consumers.

Until 1982, few third-party console games existed other than Activision's. [[Imagic]] and [[Games by Apollo]] demonstrated their own 2600 cartridges in January 1982, and Coleco announced several 2600 and [[Intellivision]] games. [[Parker Brothers]], CBS Video Games, and [[Mattel]] also announced 2600 cartridges at the February [[Toy Fair]], and Coleco announced the [[ColecoVision]]. At the Summer 1982 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], 17 companies including [[MCA Inc.]] and [[20th Century Fox|Fox Video Games]] announced 90 new Atari games.&lt;ref name="goodman1983spring"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Goodman |first=Danny |author-link=Danny Goodman |date=Spring 1983 |title=Home Video Games: Video Games Update |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n1/vgupdate.php |magazine=Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games |page=32 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107020633/http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n1/vgupdate.php |archivedate=November 7, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1983, an estimated 100 companies were vying to get a foothold in the video game market.&lt;ref name="nytimes 1983"/&gt;

Attempting to imitate Activision, the new companies attempted to use programmers unfamiliar with game development to produce, Crane said, "the worst games you can imagine".&lt;ref name=aa20160509&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arcadeattack.co.uk/david-crane/ |title=INTERVIEW&amp;nbsp;– DAVID CRANE (ATARI/ACTIVISION/SKYWORKS) |work=[[Arcade Attack]] |date=May 9, 2016 |accessdate=May 10, 2016 |author=Adrian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509160135/http://www.arcadeattack.co.uk/david-crane/ |archivedate=May 9, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies lured away each other's programmers or used [[reverse engineering]] to learn how to make games for proprietary systems. Atari even hired several programmers from Mattel's Intellivision development studio, prompting a lawsuit by Mattel against Atari that included charges of [[industrial espionage]].

Despite the lessons learned by Atari in the loss of its programmers to Activision, Mattel continued to try to avoid crediting game designers. Rather than reveal the names of [[Blue Sky Rangers|Intellivision game designers]], in a 1981 ''TV Guide'' interview, Mattel instead required that they change their names to protect their collective identities.

In the second half of 1982 the number of cartridges grew from 100 in June to more than 400 in December. Experts predicted a glut in 1983, with 10% of games producing 75% of sales.&lt;ref name="mj19821226"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nwsdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QX8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3635%2C1989311 |title=Stream of video games is endless |work=Milwaukee Journal |date=December 26, 1982 |accessdate=January 10, 2015 |pages=Business 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[BYTE]]'' stated in December that "in 1982 few games broke new ground in either design or format ...

By September 1983 the ''Phoenix'' stated that 2600 cartridges "is no longer a growth industry".{{r|mitchell19830906}} Activision, Atari, and Mattel all had experienced programmers, but many of the new companies&amp;nbsp;rushing to join the market&amp;nbsp;did not have the expertise or talent to create quality games. Titles such as ''[[Chase the Chuck Wagon]]'' (about dogs eating food, funded by the dog food company [[Ralston Purina|Purina]]), ''[[Skeet Shoot]]'', and ''[[Lost Luggage (video game)|Lost Luggage]]'' were examples of games made in the hopes of taking advantage of the video-game boom.

=== Immediate effects ===
The release of so many new games in {{vgy|1982}} flooded the market.  Most stores had insufficient space to carry new games and consoles. As stores tried to return the surplus games to the new publishers, the publishers had neither new products nor cash to issue refunds to the retailers. Many publishers, including [[Games by Apollo]] and [[US Games]], quickly folded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Unable to return the unsold games to defunct publishers, stores marked down the titles and placed them in discount bins and sale tables. Recently released games which initially sold for US $35 (equivalent to $92 in 2018) were in bins for $5 ($13 in 2018).&lt;ref name=prince198309&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Prince |first=Suzan |date=September 1983 |title=Faded Glory: The Decline, Fall and Possible Salvation of Home Video |url=https://archive.org/stream/Video_Games_Volume_1_Number_12_1983-09_Pumpkin_Press_US#page/n17/mode/2up |magazine=Video Games |publisher=Pumpkin Press |access-date=2016-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daglow198808"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Changing Role of Computer Game Designers |work=Computer Gaming World |date=August 1988 |last=Daglow |first=Don L. |pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crane said that "those awful games flooded the market at huge discounts, and ruined the video game business".{{r|aa20160509}} By June {{vgy|1983}}, the market for the more expensive games had shrunk dramatically and was replaced by a new market of rushed-to-market, low-budget games.

A massive industry shakeout resulted. [[Magnavox]] abandoned the video game business entirely. [[Imagic]] withdrew its [[Initial public offering|IPO]] the day before its stock was to go public; the company later collapsed.

One of the more predominant effects of the 1983 crash was on Atari. In 1982, it had published large volumes of Atari 2600 games that they had expected to sell well, including a port of ''[[Pac-Man]]'' and game adaption of the film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. However, due to the quality of these games and other market factors, much of Atari's production did not get sold. In September 1983, Atari discreetly buried much of this excess stock, as well as unsold stock of earlier games, in a landfill near [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]], though Atari did not comment about their activity at the time. Misinformation related to sales of ''Pac-Man'' and ''E.T.'' led to an [[urban legend]] of the [[Atari video game burial]] that millions of unsold cartridges were buried there. Gaming historians received permission to dig up the landfill as part of a documentary in 2014, during which former Atari executives clarified that only about 700,000 cartridges had been buried in 1982, backed by estimates made during the excavation, and disproving the scale of the urban legend. Despite this, Atari's burial remains an iconic representation of the 1983 video game crash.&lt;ref name="InfoWorld"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John C |last1=Dvorak |date=August 12, 1985 |title=Is the PCJr Doomed To Be Landfill? |journal=[[InfoWorld]] |volume=7 |issue=32 |page=64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ai8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA64&amp;dq=atari+landfill#v=onepage&amp;q=atari%20landfill&amp;f=false |accessdate=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCAdvisor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/tablets/3298074/hp-touchpads-to-be-dumped-in-landfill/ |title=HP TouchPads to be dumped in landfill? |first=Simon |last=Jary |publisher=[[PC Advisor]] |date=August 19, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108045640/http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/tablets/3298074/hp-touchpads-to-be-dumped-in-landfill/ |archivedate=November 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904006104576502744235853146?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Book Review: Super Mario |publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]] |first=James |last=Kennedy |date=August 20, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906225910/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904006104576502744235853146?mod=googlenews_wsj |archivedate=September 6, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, while some stores sold new games and machines, most retailers stopped selling video game consoles or reduced their stock significantly, reserving floor or shelf space for other products. This was the most formidable barrier that confronted [[Nintendo]], as it tried to market its [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] system in the United States. Retailer opposition to video games was directly responsible for causing Nintendo to brand its product an ''"Entertainment System"'' rather than a ''"console"'', using terms such as ''"control deck"'' and ''"Game Pak"'', as well as producing a toy robot called ''[[R.O.B.]]'' to convince toy retailers to allow it in their stores. Furthermore, the design for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) used a front-loading cartridge slot to mimic how [[video cassette recorder]]s, popular at that time, were loaded, further pulling the NES away from previous console designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=NES |url=http://g4tv.com/gamemakers/episodes/4844/NES.html |series=Icons |serieslink=Icons (TV series) |credits= |network=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] |airdate=December 1, 2005 |season=4 |number=5010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016233741/http://www.g4tv.com/gamemakers/episodes/4844/NES.html |archivedate=October 16, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/25smartest/index22.shtml |title=25 Smartest Moments in Gaming |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |page=22 |date=July 21–25, 2003 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902124439/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/25smartest/index22.shtml |archivedate=September 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/18/9554885/nintendo-entertainment-system-famicom-history-masayuki-uemura | title = 7 things I learned from the designer of the NES | first = Sean | last = O'Kane | date = October 18, 2015 | accessdate = September 21, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crash also affected [[Amusement arcade|video game arcade]]s. While the number of arcades in the United States had doubled to 10,000 from 1980 to 1982, the crash lead to a closure of around 1,500 arcades, and revenues of those that remained open had fallen by 40%.&lt;ref name="nytimes 1983"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/17/business/video-games-industry-comes-down-to-earth.html | title = Video Games Industry Comes Down To Earth |first= N.R. | last = Kleinfield | date = October 17, 1983 | accessdate = September 21, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North American video game crash had two long-lasting results. The first result was that dominance in the home console market shifted from the United States to Japan. By {{vgy|1986}}, three years after its introduction, 6.5 million Japanese homes—19% of the population—owned a Family Computer, and Nintendo began exporting it to the U.S.;{{r|takiff19860620}} by {{vgy|1987}} the Nintendo Entertainment System was very popular in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Consalvo, Mia |year=2006 |title=Console video games and global corporations: Creating a hybrid culture |journal=New Media Society |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=117–137 |doi=10.1177/1461444806059921 |url=http://nms.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/8/1/117 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228191914/http://intl-nms.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/1/117.pdf |archivedate=February 28, 2008 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the U.S. video game market recovered in the late 1980s the NES was by far the dominant console, leaving only a fraction of the market to a resurgent Atari. By 1989, home video game sales in the United States had reached $5 billion, surpassing the 1982 peak of $3 billion during the previous generation. A large majority of the market was controlled by Nintendo; it sold more than 35 million units in the United States, exceeding the sales of other consoles and personal computers by a considerable margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Playing with Power in Movies, television, and Video Games: From Muppet Babies to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles |first=Marsha |last=Kinder |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=0-520-07776-8 |page=90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raDNu1lThHQC&amp;pg=PA90 |accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Japanese companies also rivaled Nintendo's success in the United States, with Sega's [[Mega Drive]]/Genesis in 1989 and NEC's [[PC Engine|PC Engine/TurboGrafx 16]] released the same year.

A second, highly visible result of the crash was the advancement of measures to control [[third-party developer|third-party development]] of software. Using secrecy to combat [[industrial espionage]] had failed to stop rival companies from reverse engineering the Mattel and Atari systems and hiring away their trained game programmers. While Mattel and Coleco implemented lockout measures to control third-party development (the [[ColecoVision]] BIOS checked for a copyright string on power-up), the Atari 2600 was completely unprotected and once information on its hardware became available, little prevented anyone from making games for the system. Nintendo thus instituted a strict licensing policy for the NES that included equipping the cartridge and console with lockout chips, which were region-specific, and had to match in order for a game to work. In addition to preventing the use of unlicensed games, it also was designed to combat [[software piracy]], rarely a problem in the United States or Western Europe, but rampant in East Asia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

[[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] achieved a technical victory in one court case against [[Sega]], challenging this control, even though it ultimately yielded and signed the Sega licensing agreement. Several publishers, notably [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]] (Atari), [[Color Dreams]], and [[Camerica]], challenged Nintendo's control system during the 8-bit era by producing unlicensed NES games. The concepts of such a control system remain in use on every major video game console produced today, even with fewer "cartridge-based" consoles on the market than in the 8/16-bit era. Replacing the security chips in most modern consoles are specially encoded [[optical disc]]s that [[Copy protection#Video game console systems|cannot be copied]] by most users and can only be read by a particular console under normal circumstances.

[[File:Sega-Genesis-Mod1-Set.jpg|thumb|right|Released in 1988, the [[Sega Genesis]] was the first real challenger to Nintendo's market dominance in North America.]]
Nintendo reserved a large part of NES game revenue for itself by limiting most third-party publishers to only five games per year on its systems (some companies tried to get around this by creating additional company labels like [[Konami]]'s [[Ultra Games]] label); Nintendo would ultimately drop this rule by 1993 with the release of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/5930361/how-konami-cheated-to-get-around-a-silly-nintendo-rule | title=  Konami's Cheat to Get Around a Silly Nintendo Rule | first = Luke | last=  Plunkett | date = July 21, 2012 | accessdate = September 21, 2018 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also required all cartridges to be manufactured by Nintendo, and to be paid for in full before they were manufactured. Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo, so publishers assumed all the financial risk of selling all units ordered. As a result, some publishers lost more money due to distress sales of remaining inventory at the end of the NES era than they ever earned in profits from sales of the games.

Nintendo portrayed these measures as intended to protect the public against poor-quality games, and placed a [[Nintendo Seal of Quality|golden seal of approval]] on all licensed games released for the system. Further, Nintendo implemented its proprietary [[10NES]], a [[lockout chip]] which was designed to prevent cartridges made without the chip from being played on the NES. The 10NES lockout was not perfect, as later in the NES's lifecycle methods were found to bypass it, but it did sufficiently allow Nintendo to strengthen its publishing control to avoid the mistakes Atari had made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/07/time-to-feel-old-inside-the-nes-on-its-30th-birthday/ | title = The NES turns 30: How it began, worked, and saved an industry | first=  Andrew | last=  Cunningham | date = July 15, 2013 | accessdate = September 21, 2018 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; These strict licensing measures backfired somewhat after Nintendo was accused of [[Competition law|trust]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=U.S. Court of Appeals |author2=Federal Circuit |year=1992 |title=Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of America Inc. |work=Digital Law Online |url=http://digital-law-online.info/cases/24PQ2D1015.htm |accessdate=March 30, 2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/618x69H52?url=http://digital-law-online.info/cases/24PQ2D1015.htm |archivedate=August 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long run, this pushed many western third-party publishers such as [[Electronic Arts]] away from Nintendo consoles, and would actively support competing consoles such as the [[Sega Genesis]] or [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]]. Most of the Nintendo platform-control measures were adopted by later console manufacturers such as Sega, Sony, Microsoft, and Intellivision Entertainment although not as stringently.

The '''Warren County Farmers' Fair Balloon Festival''' was started in 2001 and takes place during the week of the County Fair in [[Warren County, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/warrenreporter/index.ssf/2009/07/warren_county_farmers_fair_bal_1.html |title=Warren County Farmers' Fair &amp; Balloon Festival offers affordable, community-oriented fun |publisher=New Jersey On-Line |date=2009-07-13 |first=Kevin M. |last=Lechiski |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fair itself was established in 1937 by the Warren County Farmers' Fair Association. The event is a non-profit 501(c)6, agriculture in nature.

The balloon festival was started by pilot Fred Grotenhuis, who has flown [[hot air ballon|hot air balloons]] since the mid 80's. The festival began with approximately 15 balloons and to date has grown to about 30 balloons. The event features some balloon races, including the typical hare and hound races, in addition to the Bicycle Balloon Race.

In March 2014, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) ''reported'' a major Ebola outbreak in [[Guinea]], a western African nation,&lt;ref name=CDC2014Out&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Evaluation of US Patients Suspected of Having Ebola Virus Disease | url = http://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00364.asp|website=CDC | accessdate = 5 August 2014 | date = 1 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the disease then rapidly spread to the neighboring countries of [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]] with smaller outbreaks occurring in [[Senegal]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Mali]]; the resulting '''[[West African Ebola virus epidemic]]''' is the largest Ebola outbreak ('''''cases and deaths''''') ever documented.&lt;ref name="CDC2014Out"/&gt;

{{Ebola virus disease epidemic}}
{{Main|West African Ebola virus epidemic}}
Researchers believe that a 2-year-old boy who lived in the village of [[Meliandou]], [[Guéckédou Prefecture]], [[Guinea]] was the [[index case]] of the current [[Ebola virus disease]] epidemic. The boy died in December 2013. His mother, sister, and grandmother then became ill with similar symptoms and also died. Although Ebola represents a significant public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and was documented&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/179/Supplement_1/S120.long|title=Ebola Virus Outbreak among Wild Chimpanzees Living in a Rain Forest of Côte d'Ivoire|date=Feb 1999|DOI=10.1086/514296|last=Formenty|first=Pierre|journal=J.

===Data sources===
Data comes from reports by the World Health Organization Global Alert and Response Unit&lt;ref group="Resource"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://who.int/csr/don/en/ | title=Disease Outbreak News (DONs) | website=Global Alert and Response (GAR) | publisher=[[WHO]] | deadurl=no&lt;!--present in archive.org--&gt; |accessdate= 11 April 2015}}{{Fastdelta}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the WHO's Regional Office for Africa.&lt;ref group="Resource" name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news.html | title=Disease Outbreak News | website=Regional Office for Africa | publisher=[[WHO]] | deadurl=no&lt;!--present in archive.org--&gt; |accessdate= 11 April 2015}}{{Fastdelta}}&lt;/ref&gt; All numbers are correlated with United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), if available.&lt;ref group="Resource"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://wca.humanitarianresponse.info/en | title=West and Central Africa | website=HumanitarianResponse.info | publisher=[[OCHA]] | deadurl=no&lt;!--present in archive.org--&gt; |accessdate= 11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reports are sourced from official information from the affected countries' health ministries.

===Understanding the data and its limitations===
Each row of the table represents the best available information cross-checked from multiple sources on the day it was reported. The data may be inaccurate for the following reasons: 
* Each data source or report may or may not include suspected cases that have not yet been confirmed.
* Each source or report may or may not include probable cases.
* Case numbers may be revised downward if a probable or suspected case is later found to be negative. &lt;small&gt;(Numbers may differ from reports as per respective Government reports. See notes at the bottom for stated source file.)&lt;/small&gt;
* The reports usually refer to cumulative data totals since the start of the 2014 epidemic. When new data becomes available or old data is revised the correction could apply either to the past or the present.
* The number of deaths may be revised downwards if it is later found from testing those deaths were not from Ebola.
* There are variable delays in gathering, correcting and reporting the data from multiple sources.
* It is not possible to infer the rate of growth or decline in the spread of the disease from the cumulative data or the graphs; they simply reflect a timeline of the available data as reported on any given date. The real-world spread could be slowing while reported cumulative cases rise at a faster rate due to improved reporting, or the real-world spread could be increasing with flat cumulative data due to lack of reporting.
