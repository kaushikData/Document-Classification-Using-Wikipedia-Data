'''ADS-AC''' is an experimental [[open-source model|open source]] program which implements Absolutely Dynamic System, a proposed mechanism for [[Artificial consciousness|AC]].

==Theory==
ADS-AC uses a system of "points" or "nodes" connected by "links" to create a structure of "knots". The nodes have no properties other than their links to other nodes in order to maintain their absolute dynamicity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3860">[[Image:Mineraly.sk - realgar.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Agathodaemon created his 'fiery poison' by fusing a mineral (probably [[realgar]] (''seen here'') or [[orpiment]]) with [[natron]].]]
'''Agathodaemon''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀγαθοδαίμων}}, ''Agathodaímōn''; {{circa|lk=no|300}}) was an [[alchemy|alchemist]] in [[Late Antiquity|late]] [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], known only from fragments quoted in medieval alchemical treatises, chiefly the ''Anepigraphos'', which refer to works of his believed to be from the 3rd century.&lt;ref name="Brian"&gt;Brian P. Copenhaver, ''Hermetica: the Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a new English translation, with notes and introduction''. Cambridge University Press, 1992. {{ISBN|978-0-521-36144-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is primarily remembered for his various descriptions of [[Chemical element|elements]] and [[mineral]]s, most particularly his descriptions of a method of producing [[silver]],&lt;ref name="Brian" /&gt; and of a substance he had created, which he called a 'fiery [[poison]]', and which, judging by his account, was [[arsenic trioxide]], a highly toxic [[amphoteric]] [[oxide]].&lt;ref name="John" /&gt;

He described the 'fiery poison' as being formed when a certain mineral (most probably [[realgar]] or [[orpiment]]) was fused with [[natron]] (naturally occurring [[sodium carbonate]]), and that dissolved in water to give a clear [[solution]]. He also wrote of how, when he placed a fragment of [[copper]] into the solution, the copper turned a deep green hue, lending further validity to the suggestion that orpiment or realgar was used, as they are both [[arsenic]] ores, and this would be the hue achieved from the copper after it had been placed in the arsenic trioxide had the substance formed been [[copper arsenite]].&lt;ref name="John"&gt;John Emsley, ''The Elements of Murder: A History of Poison''. Oxford University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-19-280600-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agathodaemon's discoveries exist as part of the foundations for later use of poison, as arsenic and related substances were used regularly in later centuries as means of poisoning and murder. Since the only records of his existence are references in later works, he may be apocryphal, but since the practice of alchemy itself began to decline around the time he is believed to have lived, and it may be that much of his writing was lost.&lt;ref name="Brian" /&gt; Some of the writings of other alchemists on alchemy of the time were preserved and saved by a [[sect]] of dissident [[Christian]]s, who called themselves [[Nestorian Christians|Nestorians]] and who were able to escape to [[Persia]] around 400.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Bowland, ''What Does the Future Hold for Mankind''. Xlibris Corporation, 2002. {{ISBN|1-4010-4043-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} This information that was gathered by the Nestorians eventually passed on to the [[Arab]]s, and this in part contributed to the flourishing of alchemy in that region and in their hands; the modern English word "alchemy" comes from the [[Arabic language]], and many of the foundations for alchemy in Western nations were laid by the Arabs.&lt;ref name="John" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jastrow, ''Story of Human Error''. Ayer Publishing, 1936. {{ISBN|0-8369-0568-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13027">'''Agricultural biotechnology''', also known as '''agritech''', is an area of [[agricultural science]] involving the use of scientific tools and techniques, including [[genetic engineering]], [[molecular markers]], [[molecular diagnostics]], [[vaccines]], and [[tissue culture]], to modify living organisms: plants, animals, and [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://absp2.cornell.edu/resources/briefs/documents/warp_briefs_eng_scr.pdf | title=What is Agricultural Biotechnology? | publisher=Cornell University | accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Crop biotechnology is one aspect of agricultural biotechnology which has been greatly developed upon in recent times. Desired trait are exported from a particular species of Crop to an entirely different species. These [[transgene]] crops possess desirable characteristics in terms of flavor, color of flowers, growth rate, size of harvested products and resistance to diseases and pests.

== History ==
Farmers have manipulated plants and animals through selective breeding for tens of thousands of years in order to create desired traits. In the 20th century, a surge in technology resulted in an increase in agricultural biotechnology through the selection of traits like increased yield, pest resistance, [[drought resistance]], and herbicide resistance. The first food product produced through [[biotechnology]] was sold in 1990, and by 2003, 7 million farmers were utilizing biotech crops. More than 85% of these farmers were located in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://absp2.cornell.edu/resources/briefs/documents/warp_briefs_eng_scr.pdf|title=Agricultural Biotechnology|last=|first=|date=2004|website=cornell.edu|publisher=PBS, ABSP II, US Agency for International Development|access-date=1 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crop modification techniques ==

=== Traditional breeding ===
Traditional [[crossbreeding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.biofortified.org/portfolio/infographic-crop-modification-techniques/|title=Infographic: Crop Modification Techniques - Biology Fortified, Inc.|newspaper=Biology Fortified, Inc.|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been used for centuries to improve crop quality and quantity. Crossbreeding mates two sexually compatible species to create a new variety with the desired traits of the parents. For example, the [[honeycrisp apple]] exhibits a specific texture and flavor due to the crossbreeding of its parents.  In traditional practices, pollen from one plant is placed on the female part of another, which leads to a hybrid that contains genetic information from both parent plants. Plant breeders select the plants with the traits they're looking to pass on and continue to breed those plants. Note that crossbreeding can only be utilized within the same or closely related species.

=== Mutagenesis ===
[[Mutation]]s can occur randomly in the [[DNA]] of any organism. In order to create variety within crops, scientists can randomly induce mutations within plants. [[Mutation breeding|Mutagenesis]] uses radioactivity to induce random mutations in the hopes of stumbling upon the desired trait. Scientists can use [[mutagen|mutating chemical]]s such as [[ethyl methanesulfonate]], or radioactivity to create random mutations within the DNA. [[Atomic gardening|Atomic gardens]] are used to mutate crops. A radioactive core is located in the center of a circular garden and raised out of the ground to radiate the surrounding crops, generating mutations within a certain radius. Mutagenesis through radiation was the process used to produce [[ruby red grapefruit]]s.

=== Polyploidy ===
[[Polyploidy]] can be induced to modify the number of chromosomes in a crop in order to influence its fertility or size. Usually, organisms have two sets of [[chromosome]]s, otherwise known as a [[diploidy]]. However, either naturally or through the use of chemicals, that number of chromosomes can change, resulting in fertility changes or size modification within the crop. Seedless watermelons are created in this manner; a 4-set chromosome watermelon is crossed with a 2-set chromosome watermelon to create a [[Seedless fruit|sterile (seedless) watermelon]] with three sets of chromosomes.

=== Protoplast fusion ===
[[Protoplast fusion]] is the joining of cells or cell components to transfer traits between species.  For example, the trait of male sterility is transferred from radishes to red cabbages by protoplast fusion. This male sterility helps plant breeders make hybrid crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Beuckeleer|first=Mariani|last2=De Beuckeleer|first2=Celestina|last3=De Beuckeleer|first3=Marc|last4=Truettner|first4=Jessie|last5=Leemans|first5=Jan|last6=Goldberg|first6=Robert|year=1990|title=Induction of Male Sterility in Plants by a Chimaeric Ribonuclease Gene.|url=|journal=Nature|volume=437.6295|pages=737–41|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RNA interference ===
[[RNA interference]] (RNAIi) is the process in which a cell's [[RNA]] to protein mechanism is turned down or off in order to suppress genes. This method of genetic modification works by interfering with messenger RNA to stop the synthesis of proteins, effectively silencing a gene.

=== Transgenics ===
[[Transgenics]] involves the insertion of one piece of DNA into another organism's DNA in order to introduce a new gene(s) into the original organism. This addition of genes into an organism's genetic material creates a new variety with desired traits.  The DNA must be prepared and packaged in a test tube and then inserted into the new organism. New genetic information can be inserted with [[biolistics]]. An example of transgenics is the rainbow papaya, which is modified with a gene that gives it resistance to the [[papaya ringspot virus]].

=== Genome editing ===
[[Genome editing]] is the use of an enzyme system to modify the DNA directly within the cell. Genome editing was used to develop herbicide resistant canola to help farmers control weeds.

== Improved nutritional content ==
Agricultural biotechnology has been used to improve the nutritional content of a variety of crops in an effort to meet the needs of an increasing population.  Genetic engineering can produce crops with a higher concentration of vitamins. For example, [[golden rice]] contains three genes that allow plants to produce compounds that are converted to [[vitamin A]] in the human body. This nutritionally improved rice is designed to combat the world's leading cause of blindness—[[vitamin A deficiency]]. Similarly, the Banana 21 project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.banana21.org/about.html|title=About Banana21|website=www.banana21.org|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; has worked to improve the nutrition in bananas to combat [[micronutrient deficiencies]] in Uganda. By genetically modifying bananas to contain vitamin A and iron, Banana 21 has helped foster a solution to micronutrient deficiencies through the vessel of a staple food and major starch source in Africa. Additionally, crops can be engineered to reduce toxicity or to produce varieties with removed [[allergen]]s.

== Genes and traits of interest for crops ==

=== Agronomic traits ===

==== Insect resistance ====

One highly sought after trait is [[pest resistance|insect resistance]]. This trait increases a crop's resistance to bugs and allows for a higher yield. These genetically engineered crops can now produce their own Bt (''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]''), which contains toxin-producing proteins that are non-harmful to humans. [[Bt corn]] and cotton are now commonplace, and cowpeas, sunflower, soybeans, tomatoes, tobacco, walnut, sugar cane, and rice are all being studied in relation to Bt.

==== Herbicide tolerance ====

Weeds have proven to be an issue for farmers for thousands of years; they compete for soil nutrients, water, and sunlight and prove deadly to crops. Biotechnology has offered a solution in the form of herbicide tolerance. Chemical herbicides are sprayed directly on plants in order to kill weeds and therefore competition, and [[herbicide resistant]] crops have to the opportunity to flourish.

==== Disease resistance ====

Often, crops are afflicted by disease spread through insects (like [[aphid]]s). Spreading disease among crop plants is incredibly difficult to control and was previously only managed by completely removing the affected crop. The field of agricultural biotechnology offers a solution through genetically engineering virus resistance. Developing GE disease-resistant crops now include [[cassava]], [[maize]], and [[sweet potato]].

==== Temperature tolerance ====

Agricultural biotechnology can also provide a solution for plants in extreme temperature conditions. In order to maximize yield and prevent crop death, genes can be engineered that help to regulate cold and heat tolerance. For example, papaya trees have been genetically modified in order to be more tolerant of hot and cold conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Figueroa-Yañez|first=Luis|last2=Pereira-Santana|first2=Alejandro|last3=Arroyo-Herrera|first3=Ana|last4=Rodriguez-Corona|first4=Ulises|last5=Sanchez-Teyer|first5=Felipe|last6=Espadas-Alcocer|first6=Jorge|last7=Espadas-Gil|first7=Francisco|last8=Barredo-Pool|first8=Felipe|last9=Castaño|first9=Enrique|date=2016-10-20|title=RAP2.4a Is Transported through the Phloem to Regulate Cold and Heat Tolerance in Papaya Tree (Carica papaya cv. Maradol): Implications for Protection Against Abiotic Stress|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165030|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=10|pages=e0165030|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0165030|issn=1932-6203|pmc=5072549|pmid=27764197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other traits include water use efficiency, nitrogen use efficiency and salt tolerance.

=== Quality traits ===
Quality traits include increased nutritional or dietary value, improved food processing and storage, or the elimination of toxins and allergens in crop plants.

== Common GMO crops ==
Currently, only a small number of [[genetically modified crops]] are available for purchase and consumption in the United States. The USDA has approved soybeans, corn, canola, sugar beets, papaya, squash, alfalfa, cotton, apples, and potatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mvgs.iaea.org/|title=MVD|website=mvgs.iaea.org|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; GMO apples ([[arctic apples]]) are non-browning apples and eliminate the need for anti-browning treatments, reduce food waste, and bring out flavor. The production of Bt cotton has skyrocketed in India, with 10 million hectares planted for the first time in 2011, resulting in a 50% insecticide application reduction. In 2014, Indian and Chinese farmers planted more than 15 million hectares of Bt cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org|title=International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications - ISAAA.org|website=www.isaaa.org|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety testing and government regulations ==
Agricultural biotechnology regulation in the US falls under three main government agencies: The [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). The USDA must approve the release of any new GMOs, EPA controls the regulation of insecticide, and the FDA evaluates the safety of a particular crop sent to market. On average, it takes nearly 13 years and $130 million of research and development for a [[genetically modified organism]] to come to market. The regulation process takes up to 8 years in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gmo.geneticliteracyproject.org/FAQ/what-does-it-take-to-bring-a-new-gm-product-to-market/|title=What does it take to bring a new GM product to market? #GMOFAQ|newspaper=GMO FAQ|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The safety of GMOs has become a topic of debate worldwide, but scientific articles are being conducted to test the safety of consuming GMOs in addition to the FDA's work. In one such article, it was concluded that Bt rice did not adversely affect digestion and did not induce horizontal gene transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Kai|last2=Ren|first2=Fangfang|last3=Han|first3=Fangting|last4=Liu|first4=Qiwen|last5=Wu|first5=Guogan|last6=Xu|first6=Yan|last7=Zhang|first7=Jian|last8=Wu|first8=Xiao|last9=Wang|first9=Jinbin|date=2016-10-05|title=Edible Safety Assessment of Genetically Modified Rice T1C-1 for Sprague Dawley Rats through Horizontal Gene Transfer, Allergenicity and Intestinal Microbiota|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0163352|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=10|pages=e0163352|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0163352|issn=1932-6203|pmc=5051820|pmid=27706188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air France Flight 406 was an international scheduled passenger flight originating in [[Brazzaville]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]] with a final destination of [[Paris]], [[France]], with intermediate stops in [[Fort Lamy]], [[Chad]], and [[Marseille]], France. The flight was flown by Lockheed L-1649 Starliner, F-BHBM ''De Grasse''.

After taking off from Fort Lamy and while cruising at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet, the Starliner broke up after its [[empennage]] failed. The aircraft crashed to Earth approximately 35 miles from Edjele oilfield and near the Libya border.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D90hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4EUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7493,845020&amp;dq=air+france+crash+edjele&amp;hl=en Seek to reach wreckage of French airliner]&lt;/ref&gt; All people on board Flight 406 were killed in the crash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19610510-0 Aircraft accident Lockheed L-1649A Starliner F-BHBM Edjele]&lt;/ref&gt;

18 children were killed in the crash of Flight 406. Among them were the three young children, who, along with their mother Polly Lukens, the wife of the United States [[Charge d'Affaires]] in the [[Central African Republic]], were on Flight 406 headed for [[London]]. Also among the dead were the Count and Countess de Morte Mart plus two Central African Republic Ministers. Rumors began to surface after Flight 406's crash that it had been an assassination by enemies of the Central African Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=53xWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HeYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5307,2419532&amp;dq=air+france+polly&amp;hl=en 18 children die in desert crash]&lt;/ref&gt;

Air France Flight 406 was the worst aviation disaster involving a Lockheed Starliner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/dblist.php?Type=333 Aviation Safety Database Lockheed L-1649 Starliner]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
The most probable cause of Air France Flight 406 crashing was sabotage with a [[nitrocellulose]] explosive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aviation Disasters Second Edition |last1=Gero |first1=David |publisher=Patrick Stephens Limited |year= 1996 |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the various game settings of [[Palladium Books]], Alien Intelligences are fictional, vastly powerful beings of unknown origin that are stated to be a combination of equal parts spirit, magical energy, and physical flesh. They are said to exist on different planes of existence simultaneously, and in the Palladium hierarchy of powers, most Alien Intelligences, apart from the Vampire Intelligences, are more powerful than the mightiest Gods in Palladium. In fact, some of the most powerful Gods of the Palladium Megaverse were themselves spawned by the Alien Intelligences.

==Morality in Alien Intelligences==
Alien Intelligences are perceived by the vast majority of sentient beings everywhere in the Megaverse as creatures of pure evil intent, and with good reason. While many (perhaps most) Alien Intelligences do indeed gain a great deal of amusement from the suffering of other beings, for the vast majority of Intelligences, the simple fact of the matter is that they consider themselves as far above most sentient beings as those sentient beings consider themselves above pets and livestock, and treat those beings as such. Even Gods, Angels, Demons, and lesser Alien Intelligences are potentially susceptible to being treated as nothing more than pawns, slaves, and in some cases, food.

==Types of Alien Intelligences==

==="Generic" Alien Intelligences===
Most Alien Intelligences follow the standard template: a fleshy mound that may or may not take any recognizable shape, a single eye in the middle of the mass of flesh (although there can be hundreds or even thousands of these; most Intelligences don't actually need these eyes to see), and in many cases, a series of tentacles protruding from the Main Body. "Generic" Alien Intelligences have the ability to possess the bodies of "willing" hosts (in most cases any essence fragment that is taken into a host body will forever destroy or consume the original personality and/or soul of anyone tricked into accepting such a deal), the raising, controlling, and/or turning of large numbers of dead, most of the standard abilities of Palladium Gods, and the ability to send out a limited number of essence fragments to better interact with the physical world around them-although these fragments must merge with physical matter in order to be of any use.

===Vampire Intelligences===
In the Palladium Megaverse, Vampire Intelligences are seemingly the most numerous of their kind, and potentially the most dangerous, especially with the fall of the Old Ones that kept them in check. They are actually minor Old Ones but were deemed too "weak" in comparison to the other Old Ones and were not included in the super-spell that put the Old Ones and many of the greater Intelligences to sleep. Due to the virulent nature of their existence and the universal hatred throughout the Megaverse of vampiric infestation, Vampire Intelligences are hated by almost every sentient being in the Megaverse, from the least to the most powerful, and from the most stalwart Champions of Light to the most evil Devils and Demons. Very, very rarely does any other creature ever willingly work with or for them.

Vampire Intelligences are notable amongst Alien Intelligences in that they can produce an unlimited number of essences (which fuses with a mortal, living creature to form a Vampire), and that the essence fragments can, if so desired, create a corporeal servant-a last line of defense within the Vampire Intelligence's lair-without the need to possess a living victim (most essence fragments are intangible in form and must bond to a solid body in order to interact with the physical world in any way). Vampire Intelligences are, however, much weaker than their brethren in terms of both mystic might and damage capacity.

===Elemental Intelligences===
Most if not all Greater Elementals summoned by Warlocks, Shifters, and Elemental Fusionists (a name that some Warlocks prefer to be called by), are actually fragments of Elemental Intelligences themselves.

Elemental Intelligences are noteworthy amongst Intelligences, and most sentient life in general, in that they have absolutely no comprehension of morality, one way or the other. Elemental Intelligences cannot comprehend most human emotions-apart from anger-and never ever engage in any activity, good or evil, for pleasure. An Elemental Intelligence, asked or commanded by another being to retrieve an object from point B, will start from point A and simply tear through a village of women and children without the slightest regret: it cannot comprehend why it is "wrong" to kill the innocent, and it has no comprehension of life or death, good or evil.

To date, no Elemental Intelligence has been given stats in Palladium Canon, but their essence fragments are moderately powered by Alien Intelligence standards. This might indicate that the powers of Elemental Intelligences rival or exceed those of their brethren.

===Zllyphan===
A "sub-species" of Alien Intelligences whose essence fragments can only bond with the now-soulless bodies of the recently deceased. Despite that limitation, there is no apparent limit to the number of bodies that they can reanimate in this manner, the bodies themselves are restored to the appearance of full health and vigor, and furthermore any and all of those bodies are for all intents and purposes that of the Intelligence itself; everything that they see or hear the Main Body of the Intelligence sees and hears also.

Currently in Rifts Earth, on the land once known as British Isles, a Zllyphan named Zazshan has successfully re-created the legend of the Knights of the Round Table; his essence fragments are simultaneously masquerading as the Lady Guinevere, the Sorcerer Merlin, a cadre of the inner circle of Knights, and even as the Lady of the Lake-all of whom seemingly act on their own separate "agendas". Zllyphan are relatively low-powered for Alien Intelligences (although still considerably more powerful than Vampire Intelligences).

===Splugorth===
The most successful and well-organized of the Alien Intelligences, this sub-species of Alien Intelligences follow the "generic" template for Intelligences in every way, including massive damage capacity (surpassing that of all but the most powerful of Gods), the ability to send out a limited number of essence fragments, create Witches (which they typically and almost exclusively do in the form of the Splugorth High Lords), and host of other capabilities. As a species, their might is exceeded only by that of unique Intelligences such as Apsu, Nxla, and the Lord of the Deep. The Splugorth are confined principally to the [[Rifts (role-playing game)|Rifts]] Game Setting, and their past relationship of these creatures to the dreaded Old Ones, if any, is unknown.

===Unique/Greater Alien Intelligences===
There are one-of-a-kind Intelligences in the Palladium Megaverse that dwarf the power of the Gods and even most other Intelligences. Fortunately for the Megaverse, these beings are few and far between, and they are generally hated and plotted against even by other powerful Intelligences, if for no other reason than that these Greater Intelligences would likely enslave or destroy the lesser ones.

These beings include but are not limited to: Cronus, Nxla, the Lord of the Deep, Apsu, Tikilik, the Rainbow Serpent, the Tarnow Crystal Intelligence (implied to have been imprisoned in the crystal as a punishment by the Old Ones themselves), Devy'Orhal, the Conqueror, Zurvan, and the Dweller Beneath.

===[[Old Ones (Palladium Books)|The Old Ones]]===
The most powerful of all Alien Intelligences, the Old Ones were the creators of the "science" of magic, the inventors of Rune Wizardry, and possess the same standard abilities of most Intelligences, only on a far greater level (they each have millions of points of Mega Damage Capacity, for example).

It took the combined martial and mystic might of thousands of races and billions of sentient beings throughout the Megaverse to defeat them....and the effort might have failed even then had not one of the Old Ones' number been present to cast the super-spell that put them to sleep. They could not be destroyed, for fear that the resulting magical backlash would destroy all creation.

==Powers and abilities==
Alien Intelligences can, for the most part, enjoy many of the powers and abilities of Gods, including but not limited to Deific Perception (the ability to tell what manner of creature another being is just by looking at it, no matter what disguise it currently wears), effortless inter-Dimensional teleportation, the summoning of attendant minions from anywhere in the Megaverse to do its bidding, and a wide range of other Prototypical Deific powers. Unlike Gods, however, Alien Intelligences don't need the worship of sentient beings in order to continue to exist.

Most Intelligences can grant powers to favored minions through Witchery pacts as Gods can: in return for varying degrees of servitude, Intelligences can grant these Witches the ability to cast magic, can vastly increase the physical strength and ability of these minions to withstand physical damage, and in a few select cases the Intelligences can grant a longer life span or even immortality to these loyal servants.

One of the Intelligences' most significant abilities, however, is their capability to splinter the essence of their being into multiple Essence Fragments; these fragments are not just a piece of the Intelligence that spawned it, they actually are the Intelligence itself; everything that these fragments ever see or do, the Intelligence sees and does. The amount of essence fragments that a given Intelligence can dispatch at one time are limited by the "species" of Intelligence, although some special types of Intelligences such as the Vampire Intelligences, the Zllyphan Intelligences, and unique Intelligences like Nxla can create a potentially unlimited number of these.

==Weaknesses==
For all their vast range of powers, Alien Intelligences have weaknesses all their own.

Physically, they cannot alter their form to create a seemingly more fair appearance to mortals, as Gods can do: they have to possess the bodies of other sentient beings to walk among them, and some Intelligences are incapable of even that. They also cannot, for the most part, see through the eyes of their worshippers as Gods can, nor do they possess the unique ability of Palladium Gods to create viable offspring with other lifeforms (in fact, Alien Intelligences cannot reproduce sexually with other species at all).

Alien Intelligences seem to reproduce very slowly, if "reproduction" is the proper term to use at all; some Intelligences in canon, such as the ruler of Rifts Atlantis known as Splynncryth, are given an age which implies a date of origin or birth, but the means by which the Intelligences replenish their numbers remains an unknown at present. In any event, it appears to be a slow process: in Palladium Books canon, less than a hundred or so Alien Intelligences are cited throughout the entire Megaverse, and the fear and hatred of these beings makes them prime targets for revenge, treachery, and even assassination-often at the hands of other, rival Intelligences.

Arguably, their greatest weakness, however, is not physical but mental. In holding "lesser" creatures in such low regard, Alien Intelligences frequently underestimate the ingenuity of the sentient pets, slaves, and livestock below them, and have on more than one occasion been defeated and even destroyed at the hands of an unanticipated insurrection against their rule. Even the [[Old Ones (Palladium Books)|Old Ones]] themselves, far and away the mightiest beings ever to exist in the Palladium Megaverse, were lulled into a false sense of security, and were eventually defeated by a Megaversal uprising that they never expected. Furthermore, many of those participating in the rebellion were their trusted minions.

'''Aminoallyl nucleotide''' is a nucleotide with a modified base containing an [[allylamine]]. They are used in post-labeling of [[nucleic acid]]s by [[fluorescence]] detection in [[microarray]]. They are reactive with [[N-Hydroxysuccinimide]] ester group which helps attach a [[Fluorophore|fluorescent dye]] to the primary amino group on the nucleotide. These nucleotides are known as 5-(3-amino[[allyl]])-nucleotides since the aminoallyl group is usually attached to carbon 5 of the [[pyrimidine]] ring of [[uracil]] or [[cytosine]]. The primary [[amine]] group in the aminoallyl moiety is [[aliphatic]] and thus more reactive compared to the amine groups that are directly attached to the rings ([[aromatic]]) of the bases. Common names of aminoallyl [[nucleosides]] are initially abbreviated with aa- or AA- to indicate aminoallyl. The 5-carbon sugar is indicated with or without the lowercase "d" indicating [[deoxyribose]] if included or [[ribose]] if not. Finally the [[nitrogenous base]] and number of [[phosphates]] are indicated (i.e. aa-UTP = aminoallyl uridine [[triphosphate]]).

==History==
[[File:Heatmap using aminoallyl nucleotide.png|thumb|Hierarchically clustered heat map using aa-dUTPs&lt;ref name=microarraypic&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogan|first=Daniel J.|author2=Riordan, Daniel P. |author3=Gerber, André P. |author4=Herschlag, Daniel |author5= Brown, Patrick O. |title=Diverse RNA-Binding Proteins Interact with Functionally Related Sets of RNAs, Suggesting an Extensive Regulatory System|journal=PLoS Biology|date=2008|volume=6|issue=10|pages=e255|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060255|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0060255|accessdate=29 April 2014 |pmid=18959479 |pmc=2573929}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The goal of combining fluorescence and nucleic acids has been to provide a non-[[Isotopic labeling|isotopic]] tag that is detectable to study [[DNA]] or [[RNA]]. This type of labeling allows scientists to study DNA or RNA in their structure, function, or formation with other nucleic acids.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kricka|first=LJ|author2=Fortina, P|title=Analytical ancestry: "firsts" in fluorescent labeling of nucleosides, nucleotides, and nucleic acids.|journal=Clinical Chemistry|date=Apr 2009|volume=55|issue=4|pages=670–83|pmid=19233914|doi=10.1373/clinchem.2008.116152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first base modification for fluorescent labeling occurred in 1971 with a [[4-thiouridine]] and [[4-thiouracil]].&lt;ref name=Thio&gt;{{cite journal|last=Secrist III|first=John A.|author2=Jorge R. Barrio |author3=Nelson J.

As instrumentation and technologies become more advanced in the field of [[DNA microarray]], better reagents and techniques will be needed to further scientific studies. Fluorescent labeling with [[Cyanine#Cy3 and Cy5|Cy3]] was shown to be more insufficient and skew results; the method of aminoallyl nucleotide incorporation was opted instead. Using aminoallyl nucleotides as indirect fluorescent labeling seemed to nullify the sensitivity issues seen in [[Cyanine#Cy3 and Cy5|cyanine-labeling]].&lt;ref name="RNA methodologies"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farrell|first=Robert|title=RNA Methodologies: A Laboratory Guide for Isolation and Characterization|page=597|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OG2XubAE2BEC&amp;pg=PA597&amp;lpg=PA597&amp;dq=aminoallyl+nucleotides+beginning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X7KfNkMaKj&amp;sig=TfBMiZdE63UrHriKuBJ-r4q0OgU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9CFFU5zbO6amygHcqIFA&amp;ved=0CHYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=aminoallyl%20nucleotides%20beginning&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the image above, on the left is a modified nucleoside with an [[iodine]] (the iodine is added via [[electrophilic halogenation]]) in the fifth carbon in the pyrimidine ring. Its formation can be associated with a reaction with an allylamine and various reagents via heck coupling are able to remove the [[halogen]] group from the base and add the allylamine to become the aminoallyl nucleoside shown on the right.&lt;ref name=Synthesis /&gt; The product on the right is then used to in [[molecular biology]] in RNA synthesis.&lt;ref name="RNA methodologies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dUTP product information" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Modified Nucleotide catalog" /&gt;

Aminoallyl NTPs are used for indirect DNA labeling in [[PCR]], [[nick translation]], [[primer extension]]s and [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] synthesis.&lt;ref name="Trilink biotechnology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Biotechnology|first=Trilink|title=DNA labeling|url=http://www.trilinkbiotech.com/cart/scripts/prodList.asp?idCategory=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; These labeled NTPs are helpful because of their application in molecular biology labs where they do not have the capacity to handle radioactive material. For example, 5-(3-Aminoallyl)-Uridine(AA-UTPs) are more effective for high density labeling of DNA than pre-labeling the DNA. After the enzymatic addition of the NTPs, amine reactant fluorescent dyes can be added for detection of the DNA molecule.&lt;ref name="Modified Nucleotide catalog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Biotechnology|first=Trilink|title=Modified Nucleotides|url=http://www.trilinkbiotech.com/work/ntps.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When incorporated into DNA or RNA molecules by DNA/RNA [[polymerase]], 5-(3-aminoallyl)-UTP provide a reactive group for the addition of other chemical groups. Thus aminoallyl modified DNA or RNA can be labeled with any compound which has an amine-reactive group.
aa-NTPs incorporated into DNA/RNA in combination with a secondary dye coupling reagents can probe for an array analysis.&lt;ref name="dUTP product information"&gt;{{cite web|last=Biosystems|first=Applied|title=Modified Nucleotide 5-(3-aminoallyl)-UTP|url=http://tools.lifetechnologies.com/content/sfs/manuals/sp_8436.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

cDNA relies on aminoallyl labeling for detection purposes. Although direct labeling of dNTP is the quickest and cheapest method of fluorescent labeling, it is disadvantageous as the sequence allows for only one modified nucleotide for use. Another disadvantage of direct labeling is the bulky nucleotides, however this can be overcome by indirect labeling using aminoallyl modified nucleotides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibriel|first=Abdullah|title=Options available for labeling nucleic acid samples in DNA micro-array-based detection methods|journal=BRIEFINGS IN FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS|date=17 April 2012|volume=II|issue=4|pages=311–318}}&lt;/ref&gt; An easy way to check for labeling success is the color;Good labeling will result in visible blue (Cy5) or red (Cy3) color in the final material.&lt;ref name="A laboratory Manual"&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Michael|title=Molecular Cloning-A Laboratory Manual|url=http://www.molecularcloning.com/index.php?prt=112|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Process of preparing amino allyl-labelled cDNA.jpg|thumb|Process of preparing amino-allyl labeled cDNA]]

Another process which uses aminoallyl labeling is [[NASBA (molecular biology)|NASBA]] ( Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification), a highly sensitive technique for amplifying RNA. In this specific case, the aaUTP modified RNAs were tagged with fluorescent market Cy3. NASBA combined with aminoallyl-UTP labeling is very useful for many different areas of microbial diagnostics including environmental monitoring, bio threat detection, industrial process monitoring and clinical microbiology.&lt;ref name=NASBA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ott|first=Scheler,|author2=Barry Glynn|title=Fluorescent labeling of NASBA amplified tmRNA molecules for microarray applications|journal=BMC Biotechnology|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA microarray is another method which utilizes specifically AA-NTP's making DNA microarray testing quicker and cheaply.&lt;ref name=Microarray&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xiang|first=CC|author2=Kozhich, OA|author3=Chen, M|author4=Inman, JM|author5=Phan, QN|author6=Chen, Y|author7= Brownstein, MJ|title=Amine-modified random primers to label probes for DNA microarrays.|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=Jul 2002|volume=20|issue=7|pages=738–42|pmid=12089562|doi=10.1038/nb0702-738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-synthesis labeling avoids the problems found in direct enzymatic incorporation of Cy-labeled dNTPs by generating probes with equal labeling effectiveness. With indirect labeling, amine-modified NTPs are incorporated during [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|reverse transcription]], RNA amplification, or [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]. Amino allyl-NTPs are incorporated with similar efficiency as unmodified NTPs during polymerization.&lt;ref name="cRNA Better"&gt;{{cite journal|last='t Hoen|first=PA|last2=de Kort |first2=F |last3=van Ommen |first3=GJ |last4=den Dunnen |first4=JT|title=Fluorescent labelling of cRNA for microarray applications.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=Mar 1, 2003|volume=31|issue=5|pages=e20|pmid=12595569|accessdate=|doi=10.1093/nar/gng020|pmc=149842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaposi-Novak|first=P|author2=Lee, JS|author3= Mikaelyan, A|author4= Patel, V|author5= Thorgeirsson, SS|title=Oligonucleotide microarray analysis of aminoallyl-labeled cDNA targets from linear RNA amplification.|journal=BioTechniques|date=Oct 2004|volume=37|issue=4|pages=580, 582–6, 588|pmid=15517970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns with labeling:
The amine group, in aminoallyl-modified nucleotide, is reactive with dyes such as the cyanine series, or other patented dyes. A problem arises when the dyes react with [[buffering agents]] which are necessary for the proper storage of the nucleotides. However, a carbonate buffer can be used to overcome this problem.&lt;ref name="concerns with labeling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soundy|first=P|first2=C. |last2=Wheeler |first3=H. |last3=Latham |title=Preparing highly fluorescent, evenly labelled probes for microarray hybridization using the amino allyl method with CyScribe Post-Labelling Kit|journal=Life Science News|volume=9|pages=17–19|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asexual reproduction is the primary form of reproduction for [[single-celled organism]]s such as [[archaea]] and [[eubacteria|bacteria]]. Many [[plant]]s and [[Fungus|fungi]] sometimes reproduce asexually.

While all [[prokaryote]]s reproduce without the formation and fusion of gametes, mechanisms for [[lateral gene transfer]] such as [[Bacterial conjugation |conjugation]], [[Transformation (genetics) |transformation]] and [[Transduction (genetics) |transduction]] can be likened to [[sexual reproduction]] in the sense of [[genetic recombination]] in [[meiosis]].&lt;ref name="Narra"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Narra, H.

==Types==

===Fission===
{{main|Fission (biology)}}

An important form of [[Fission (biology)|fission]] is binary fission, where the parent organism is replaced by two daughter organisms, because it literally divides in two. Only [[prokaryote]]s (the [[archaea]] and the [[bacteria]]) reproduce asexually through binary fission. [[Eukaryote]]s (such as [[protist]]s and unicellular [[fungi]]) may reproduce in a functionally similar manner by [[mitosis]]; most of these are also capable of sexual reproduction.

Multiple fission at the cellular level occurs in many [[protist]]s, e.g. [[sporozoa]]ns and [[algae]]. The [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of the parent cell divides several times by [[mitosis]], producing several nuclei. The cytoplasm then separates, creating multiple daughter cells.&lt;ref name="ebrit"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/498542/reproduction/76146/Multiple-fission |title=Cell reproduction |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fap"&gt;{{cite book |author=Britannica Educational Publishing |title=Fungi, Algae, and Protists |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-61530-463-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_U9MB4iUpDIC&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=multiple%20fission&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q=multiple%20fission&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aff"&gt;{{cite book |author=P.Puranik |author2=Asha Bhate |title=Animal Forms And Functions: Invertebrata |publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons |year=2007 |isbn=978-81-7625-791-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-kdq6RyyVE0C&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=multiple%20fission&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q=multiple%20fission&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[apicomplexa]]ns, multiple fission, or [[schizogony]] appears either as [[protozoal merogony|merogony]], [[sporogony]] or [[gametogony]]. Merogony results in [[merozoite]]s, which are multiple daughter cells, that originate within the same cell membrane,&lt;ref name="margulis"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Margulis, Lynn |author1link=Lynn Margulis |author2=McKhann, Heather I. |author3=Olendzenski, Lorraine |title=Illustrated glossary of protoctista: vocabulary of the algae, apicomplexa, ciliates, foraminifera, microspora, water molds, slime molds, and the other protoctists |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett learn |year=2001 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=y55Efu3baksC&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=Merogony%20multiple%20division&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q=Merogony%20multiple%20division&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-86720-081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tanada"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Yoshinori Tanada |author2=Harry K.

=== Budding===
[[File:S cerevisiae under DIC microscopy.jpg|thumb|The yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' reproducing by [[budding]]]]
{{main|Budding}}

Some cells split via [[budding]] (for example [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae |baker's yeast]]), resulting in a "mother" and "daughter" cell. The offspring organism is smaller than the parent. Budding is also known on a multicellular level; an animal example is the [[Hydra (genus) |hydra]], which reproduces by budding. The buds grow into fully matured individuals which eventually break away from the parent organism. 

Internal budding is a process of asexual reproduction, favoured by parasites such as ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''. It involves an unusual process in which two (''endodyogeny'') or more (''endopolygeny'') daughter cells are produced inside a mother cell, which is then consumed by the offspring prior to their separation.&lt;ref name=smyth&gt;{{cite book |author1=Smyth, James Desmond |author2=Wakelin, Derek |title=Introduction to animal parasitology |year=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=101–102 |edition=3 |isbn=0-521-42811-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, budding (external or internal) is present in some worm like [[Taenia (genus) |Taenia]] or [[Echinococcus |Echinococci]]; these worm produce cyst and then produce (invaginated or evaginated) [[protoscolex]] with [[budding]].

=== Vegetative propagation===
{{main|Vegetative propagation}}
[[File:Bryophyllum daigremontianum nahaufnahme1.jpg|thumb|Vegetative plantlets of mother-of-thousands, ''[[Bryophyllum daigremontianum|Bryophyllum (Kalanchoe) daigremontianum]]'']]

Vegetative propagation is a type of asexual reproduction found in plants where new individuals are formed without the production of seeds or spores by [[meiosis]] or [[syngamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/gloss6/asexual.html |title=Asexual Reproduction |publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of vegetative reproduction include the formation of miniaturized plants called plantlets on specialized leaves (for example in [[kalanchoe]]) and some produce new plants out of [[rhizome]]s or [[stolon]] (for example in [[Garden strawberry |strawberry]]). Other plants reproduce by forming [[bulb]]s or [[tuber]]s (for example [[tulip]] bulbs and [[dahlia]] tubers). Some plants produce [[adventitious]] shoots and may form a [[clonal colony]], where all the individuals are clones, and the clones may cover a large area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/communities/aspen/grow.shtml |title=Celebrating Wildflowers - Fading Gold - How Aspens Grow |publisher=Fs.fed.us |date=11 May 2010 |accessdate=13 August 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100923073834/http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/communities/aspen/grow.shtml | archivedate= 23 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spore formation===
{{main|Sporogenesis}} 
Many multicellular organisms form [[spore]]s during their [[biological life cycle]] in a process called '''''sporogenesis'''''. Exceptions are animals and some protists, who undergo ''meiosis'' immediately followed by fertilization. Plants and many algae on the other hand undergo ''sporic meiosis'' where meiosis leads to the formation of [[haploid]] spores rather than gametes. These spores grow into multicellular individuals (called [[gametophyte]]s in the case of plants) without a fertilization event. These haploid individuals give rise to [[gamete]]s through [[mitosis]]. Meiosis and gamete formation therefore occur in separate generations or "phases" of the life cycle, referred to as [[alternation of generations]]. Since sexual reproduction is often more narrowly defined as the fusion of gametes ([[fertilization]]), spore formation in plant [[sporophyte]]s and algae might be considered a form of asexual reproduction (agamogenesis) despite being the result of [[meiosis]] and undergoing a reduction in [[ploidy]]. However, both events (spore formation and fertilization) are necessary to complete sexual reproduction in the plant life cycle.

Fungi and some algae can also utilize true asexual [[spore]] formation, which involves [[mitosis]] giving rise to reproductive cells called mitospores that develop into a new organism after dispersal. This method of reproduction is found for example in [[Conidium |conidial fungi]] and the [[red algae]] ''Polysiphonia'', and involves sporogenesis without meiosis. Thus the chromosome number of the spore cell is the same as that of the parent producing the spores. However, mitotic sporogenesis is an exception and most spores, such as those of plants, most [[Basidiomycota]], and many algae, are produced by [[meiosis]].

=== Fragmentation===
[[File:Tu - Linckia guildingi.jpg |thumb |right |alt=Regeneration from an arm |''[[Linckia guildingi]]'' "comet", a [[starfish]] regrowing from a single arm]]
{{main|Fragmentation (reproduction)}}

Fragmentation is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent. Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual. Fragmentation is seen in many organisms. Animals that reproduce asexually include [[planarian]]s, many [[annelid]] worms including [[polychaete]]s&lt;ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesPolychRepro"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ruppert, E. E. |author2=Fox, R. S. |author3=Barnes, R. D. | title=Invertebrate Zoology | chapter=Annelida | publisher=Brooks / Cole | edition=7 | isbn=0-03-025982-7 | year=2004 | pages=434–441}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[oligochaete]]s,&lt;ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesOligochRepro"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ruppert, E.E. |author2=Fox, R.S. |author3=Barnes, R.D.  |last-author-amp=yes | title=Invertebrate Zoology | chapter=Annelida | publisher=Brooks / Cole | edition=7 | isbn=0-03-025982-7 | year=2004 | pages=466–469}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[turbellarians]] and [[sea stars]]. Many fungi and plants reproduce asexually. Some plants have specialized structures for reproduction via fragmentation, such as ''[[Gemma (botany) |gemma]]'' in [[Marchantiophyta |liverworts]]. Most [[lichen]]s, which are a [[Symbiosis |symbiotic]] union of a fungus and [[Photosynthesis |photosynthetic]] algae or bacteria, reproduce through fragmentation to ensure that new individuals contain both symbiont. These fragments can take the form of ''soredia'', dust-like particles consisting of fungal hyphen wrapped around photobiont cells.

Clonal Fragmentation in multicellular or colonial organisms is a form of asexual reproduction or cloning where an organism is split into fragments. Each of these fragments develop into mature, fully grown individuals that are clones of the original organism. In [[echinoderm]]s, this method of reproduction is usually known as '''fissiparity'''.&lt;ref name="skold"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sköld, Helen Nilsson |author2=Obst, Matthias |author3=Sköld, Mattias |author4=Åkesson, Bertil |editor1=Baruch Rinkevich |editor2=Valeria Matranga |title=Stem Cells in Marine Organisms |chapter=Stem Cells in Asexual Reproduction of Marine Invertebrates |publisher=Springer |year=2009 |page=125 |isbn=978-90-481-2766-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eP2p0VF6VcC&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=Fissiparity&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q=Fissiparity&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers claim today that due to many environmental and [[Epigenetics |epigenetic]] differences, that clones originated in the same ancestor might actually be genetically and epigenetically different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Neuhof |first1=Moran |last2=Levin |first2=Michael |last3=Rechavi |first3=Oded |title=Vertically and horizontally-transmitted memories – the fading boundaries between regeneration and inheritance in planaria |journal=Biology Open |date=26 August 2016 |pages=bio.020149 |doi=10.1242/bio.020149 |pmid=27565761 |url=http://bio.biologists.org/content/early/2016/08/26/bio.020149 |accessdate=30 August 2016 |pmc=5051648 |volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agamogenesis===
Agamogenesis is any form of reproduction that does not involve a male gamete. Examples are [[parthenogenesis]] and [[apomixis]].

==== Parthenogenesis====
[[File:Aphid-giving-birth.jpg |thumb |[[Aphid]] giving birth to live young from an unfertilized egg]]
{{main|Parthenogenesis}}

Parthenogenesis is a form of [[agamogenesis]] in which an unfertilized egg develops into a new individual. Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in many plants, [[invertebrate]]s (e.g. water fleas, [[rotifer]]s, aphids, [[stick insect]]s, some ants, bees and parasitic wasps), and [[vertebrate]]s (e.g. some reptiles, amphibians, rarely birds). In plants, [[apomixis]] may or may not involve parthenogenesis.

==== Apomixis and nucellar embryony====
{{main|Apomixis |Nucellar embryony}}

Apomixis in plants is the formation of a new [[sporophyte]] without fertilization. It is important in ferns and in flowering plants, but is very rare in other seed plants. In flowering plants, the term "apomixis" is now most often used for [[agamospermy]], the formation of seeds without fertilization, but was once used to include [[vegetative reproduction]]. An example of an [[apomictic]] plant would be the [[triploid]] European [[dandelion]]. Apomixis mainly occurs in two forms: In gametophytic apomixis, the embryo arises from an unfertilized egg within a diploid embryo sac that was formed without completing meiosis. In [[nucellar embryony]], the embryo is formed from the diploid [[nucellus]] tissue surrounding the embryo sac. Nucellar embryony occurs in some [[citrus]] seeds. Male apomixis can occur in rare cases, such as the Saharan Cypress ''[[Cupressus dupreziana]]'', where the genetic material of the embryo are derived entirely from [[pollen]].

== Alternation between sexual and asexual reproduction==
{{see also |Plant reproduction#Sexual reproduction}}
[[File:Soybeanaphidlifecycle.gif|thumb|upright=1.7|[[Aphid]] populations are often entirely female during the summer, with sexual reproduction only to produce eggs for overwintering.]]

Some species can alternate between sexual and asexual strategies, an ability known as '''[[heterogamy]]''', depending on conditions. Alternation is observed in several [[rotifer]] species (cyclical parthenogenesis e.g. in [[Brachionus]] species) and a few types of insects, such as [[aphid]]s which will, under certain conditions, produce eggs that have not gone through meiosis, thus cloning themselves. The cape bee [[Apis mellifera capensis |''Apis mellifera'' subsp. ''capensis'']] can reproduce asexually through a process called [[thelytoky]]. A few species of amphibians, reptiles , and birds have a similar ability.For example, the freshwater crustacean ''[[Daphnia]]'' reproduces by parthenogenesis in the spring to rapidly populate ponds, then switches to [[sexual reproduction]] as the intensity of competition and predation increases. Another example are monogonont [[rotifer]]s of the genus ''[[Brachionus]]'', which reproduce via cyclical parthenogenesis: at low population densities females produce asexually and at higher densities a chemical cue accumulates and induces the transition to sexual reproduction. Many protists and fungi alternate between sexual and asexual reproduction.

For example, the slime mold ''[[Dictyostelium]]'' undergoes binary fission (mitosis) as single-celled amoebae under favorable conditions. However, when conditions turn unfavorable, the cells aggregate and follow one of two different developmental pathways, depending on conditions. In the social pathway, they form a multicellular slug which then forms a fruiting body with asexually generated spores. In the sexual pathway, two cells fuse to form a giant cell that develops into a large cyst. When this macrocyst germinates, it releases hundreds of amoebic cells that are the product of meiotic recombination between the original two cells.&lt;ref name="MehrotraAneja1990"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mehrotra, R. S. |author2=Aneja, K. R. |title=An Introduction to Mycology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUorj_O2dcsC&amp;pg=PA83 |accessdate=4 August 2010 |date=December 1990 |publisher=New Age International |isbn=978-81-224-0089-2 |pages=83 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hyphae of the common mold (''[[Rhizopus]]'') are capable of producing both mitotic as well as meiotic spores. Many algae similarly switch between sexual and asexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="ColeSheath1990"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cole, Kathleen M. |author2=Sheath, Robert G. |title=Biology of the red algae |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F7CWXuYZFq8C&amp;pg=PA469 |accessdate=4 August 2010 |year=1990 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-34301-5 |pages=469–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of plants use both sexual and asexual means to produce new plants, some species alter their primary modes of reproduction from sexual to asexual under varying environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="ReekieBazzaz2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Edward G.

== Inheritance in asexual species==
For example, in the [[rotifer]] ''[[Brachionus]] calyciflorus'' asexual reproduction (obligate [[parthenogenesis]]) can be inherited by a recessive allele, which leads to loss of sexual reproduction in homozygous offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Stelzer | first1=C.-P. | last2=Schmidt | first2=J. | last3=Wiedlroither | first3=A. | last4=Riss | first4=S. | year=2010 | title=Loss of Sexual Reproduction and Dwarfing in a Small Metazoan | url= | journal=PLoS ONE | volume=5 | issue=9 | page=e12854 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0012854 | pmid=20862222 | pmc=2942836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Scheuerl | first1=T. | last2=Riss | first2=S. | last3=Stelzer | first3=C.P. | year=2011 | title=Phenotypic effects of an allele causing obligate parthenogenesis in a rotifer | journal=Journal of Heredity | volume=102 | issue=4 | pages=409–415 | doi=10.1093/jhered/esr036 | pmid=21576287 | pmc=3113615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Inheritance of asexual reproduction by a single recessive locus has also been found in the [[parasitoid wasp]] ''Lysiphlebus fabarum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sandrock, C.; Vorburger, C. |title=Single-locus recessive inheritance of asexual reproduction in a parasitoid wasp |journal=Curr.

== Examples in animals==

Asexual reproduction is found in nearly half of the animal phyla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Minelli, Alessandro |year=2009 |title=Asexual reproduction and regeneration |work=Perspectives in Animal Phylogeny and Evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=123–127 |url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=jIASDAAAQBAJ |isbn=978-0198566205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parthenogenesis occurs in the [[hammerhead shark]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Savage |first=Juliet Eilperin |title=Female Sharks Can Reproduce Alone, Researchers Find |work=Washington Post |date= 23 May 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/22/AR2007052201405.html |accessdate=27 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[blacktip shark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081010173054.htm |title='Virgin Birth' By Shark Confirmed: Second Case Ever |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2008.02018.x |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=11 October 2008 |accessdate=13 August 2010 |last1=Chapman |first1=D.

S. |journal=Journal of Fish Biology |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=1473–1477}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the sharks had reached sexual maturity in captivity in the absence of males, and in both cases the offspring were shown to be genetically identical to the mothers. The [[New Mexico whiptail]] is another example.

Reptiles use the [[ZW sex-determination system]], which produces either males (with ZZ sex chromosomes) or females (with ZW or WW sex chromosomes). Until 2010, it was thought that the ZW chromosome system used by reptiles was incapable of producing viable WW offspring, but a (ZW) female [[boa constrictor]] was discovered to have produced viable female offspring with WW chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/boa-constrictor-produces-fatherless-babies-1.947269 |title=Boa constrictor produces fatherless babies |publisher=CBC News - Technology &amp; Science |date=3 November 2010 |accessdate=2014-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female boa could have chosen any number of male partners (and had successfully in the past) but on these occasions she reproduced asexually, creating 22 female babies with WW sex-chromosomes.

[[Polyembryony]] is a widespread form of asexual reproduction in animals, whereby the fertilized egg or a later stage of embryonic development splits to form genetically identical clones. Within animals, this phenomenon has been best studied in the parasitic [[Hymenoptera]]. In the [[9-banded armadillos]], this process is obligatory and usually gives rise to genetically identical quadruplets. In other mammals, [[monozygotic twinning]] has no apparent genetic basis, though its occurrence is common. There are at least 10 million identical human twins and triplets in the world today.

Bdelloid [[rotifer]]s reproduce exclusively asexually, and all individuals in the class [[Bdelloidea]] are females. Asexuality evolved in these animals millions of years ago and has persisted since. There is evidence to suggest that asexual reproduction has allowed the animals to evolve new proteins through the [[Matthew Meselson#The Meselson Effect |Meselson effect]] that have allowed them to survive better in periods of dehydration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pouchkina-Stantcheva |first1=N. N. |last2=McGee |first2=B. M. |last3=Boschetti |first3=C. |last4=Tolleter |first4=D. |last5=Chakrabortee |first5=S. |last6=Popova |first6=A.

Molecular evidence strongly suggests that several species of the [[stick insect]] genus ''[[Timema]]'' have used only asexual (parthenogenetic) reproduction for millions of years, the longest period known for any insect.&lt;ref&gt;T Schwander et al. 2011 [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernard_Crespi/publication/51229091_Molecular_Evidence_for_Ancient_Asexuality_in_Timema_Stick_Insects/links/09e4150c275a94a2f3000000.pdf?origin=publication_detail_rebranded&amp;ev=pub_int_prw_xdl&amp;msrp=3jbAy9o0vRIPC8TuLfCJvD5lajPdDDYLfLsPFiv5UrSyxGt%2FBZUu%2BNDde0AubakD8i6Yx8W%2FoABrb3hFrpxptQ%3D%3D_p8EM6gNHdTLusDRkGyuq3a97zIt3JGLVYvJVJeLG1kTrnfjQvXkScZt6EtJmYNp0Gk07q03wI%2B9OwfDIlvNQAQ%3D%3D&amp;inViewer=1 Molecular evidence for ancient asexuality in Timema stick insects] Current Biology 21:1129-34&lt;/ref&gt;

In the grass [[thrips]] genus ''[[Aptinothrips]]'' there have been several transitions to asexuality, likely due to different causes.&lt;ref&gt;CJ van der Kooi &amp; T Schwander (2014) [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tanja_Schwander/publication/260836273_EVOLUTION_OF_ASEXUALITY_VIA_DIFFERENT_MECHANISMS_IN_GRASS_THRIPS_%28THYSANOPTERA_Aptinothrips_%29/links/53ff35850cf283c3583c85eb.pdf?ev=pub_int_doc_dl&amp;origin=publication_list&amp;inViewer=true&amp;msrp=IBQJNWHpvxIAz3kONxRs8lTmXkKo1guqdmdPS1nMBZfNi9jW2N4vYE9azjJYBcME9kDVA%2FNkFnIUCPr6PoRwA8mV7UHkNdi%2BXuQAXGzsOF4%3D_vYneys1Jb1%2FxWwUcusStqzATbxMR6TZFR7HaHHn4s78IUjlt1FtUb2aBzYwzHRu00%2BKqO5aVfYnB9YNnlAkhDQ%3D%3D Evolution of asexuality via different mechanisms in grass thrips (Thysanoptera: Aptinothrips)] Evolution 86:1883–1893&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Babelfy''' is a software [[algorithm]] for the disambiguation of text written in any language. Specifically, Babelfy performs the tasks of [[Multilinguality|multilingual]] [[Word Sense Disambiguation]] (i.e., the disambiguation of common nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) and [[Entity Linking]] (i.e. the disambiguation of mentions to encyclopedic entities like people, companies, places, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;A. Moro, A. Raganato, R. Navigli. [http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli/pubs/TACL_2014_Babelfy.pdf Entity Linking meets Word Sense Disambiguation: a Unified Approach]. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL), 2, pp. 231-244, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Babelfy is based on the [[BabelNet]] multilingual semantic network and performs disambiguation and entity linking in three steps:

* It associates with each [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] of the BabelNet semantic network, i.e., either [[concept]] or [[named entity]], a semantic signature, that is, a set of related vertices. This is a preliminary step which needs to be performed only once, independently of the input text.
* Given an input [[Written text|text]], it extracts all the linkable fragments from this text and, for each of them, lists the possible [[meaning (linguistics)|meanings]] according to the [[semantic network]].
* It creates a [[Graph (data structure)|graph-based]] semantic interpretation of the whole text by linking the candidate meanings of the extracted fragments using the previously-computed semantic signatures. It then extracts a dense [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] of this representation and selects the best candidate meaning for each fragment.

As a result, the text, written in any of the 271 [[language]]s supported by BabelNet, is output with possibly overlapping semantic annotations.

[[File:President Barack Obama's long form birth certificate.jpg|thumb|right|In response to the conspiracy theories, the [[White House]] released copies of the President's long-form birth certificate on April 27, 2011, and posted an image of it to the White House website,&lt;ref name="Long Form Birth Certificate Posted on White House website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Certificate of Live Birth|publisher=White House|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/birth-certificate.pdf |website =obamawhitehouse.archives.gov |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaffirming that he was born on August 4, 1961, in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii.]]

During [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|campaign for president]] in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]], throughout his [[Presidency of Barack Obama|presidency]], and afterwards, a number of [[conspiracy theories]] falsely asserted Obama was ineligible to be [[President of the United States]] because he was not a [[Natural-born-citizen clause of the U.S. Constitution|natural-born citizen of the U.S.]] as required by [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article Two of the Constitution]].

Theories alleged that Obama's published [[birth certificate]] was a forgery—that his actual birthplace was not [[Hawaii]] but [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]]. Other theories alleged that Obama became a citizen of [[Indonesia]] in childhood, thereby losing his [[U.S. citizenship]]. Still others claimed that Obama was not a natural-born U.S. citizen because he was born a [[multiple citizenship|dual citizen]] (British and American). A number of political commentators have characterized these various claims as a [[Racism in the United States|racist]] reaction to Obama's status as the first [[African-American]] president of the United States.&lt;ref name="racism"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2011/apr/27/barack-obama-obama-administration|date=April 27, 2011|first=Michael|last=Tomasky|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=July 20, 2011|title=Birthers and the persistence of racial paranoia}}

These claims were promoted by [[Fringe theory|fringe&lt;!--- Please consult the talk page or the FAQ at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories/FAQ before removing the word "fringe"----&gt; theorists]] (pejoratively referred to as "[[wikt:birther|birthers]]"), some of whom sought court rulings either to declare Obama ineligible to take office, or granting access to various documents which they claimed would evidence such ineligibility; none of these efforts were successful. Some political opponents, especially in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], have expressed skepticism about Obama's citizenship or been unwilling to acknowledge it;&lt;ref name="Crary-New burst"/&gt; some have proposed legislation which would require presidential candidates to provide proof of eligibility.&lt;ref name="Crary-New burst"/&gt;

==Release of the birth certificates==

[[Image:BarackObamaCertificationOfLiveBirthHawaii.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Scanned image]] of Barack Obama's birth certificate released by his presidential campaign in June 2008.&lt;ref name="factcheck"/&gt;]]
On June 12, 2008, Obama's campaign responded to the rumors by posting an image of Obama's birth certificate on the "''[[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008#"Fight the Smears" website|Fight The Smears]]''" website.&lt;ref name="hits back"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5juMJpMhCS5TDzEF2Ds-frHSuHQLQ|title=Obama hits back at Internet slanders|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=Google News|date=June 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obama-truth"/&gt;

The image is a scan of a laser-printed document obtained from and certified by the Hawaii Department of Health on June 6, 2007. It is a "Certification of Live Birth", sometimes referred to as a short form birth certificate, and contains less information than the longer "Certificate of Live Birth", which Hawaii no longer issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Applying for Hawaiian Home Lands|publisher=State of Hawaii Department of Hawaiian Homelands|url=http://hawaii.gov/dhhl/applicants/appforms/applyhhl|accessdate=July 23, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706011650/http://hawaii.gov/dhhl/applicants/appforms/applyhhl |archivedate=July 6, 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ex-Hawaii official denounces 'ludicrous' birther claims|publisher=MSNBC|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42519951/ns/politics-more_politics/|accessdate=April 19, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413051908/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42519951/ns/politics-more_politics/|archivedate=April 13, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked about this, Hawaiian Department of Health spokeswoman Janice Okubo explained that Hawaii stopped issuing the longer "Certificate" in 2001 when their birth records were "put into electronic files for consistent reporting", and therefore Hawaii "does not have a short-form or long-form certificate".&lt;ref name="HSB20090606"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Born Identity|first=June|last=Watanabe|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/content/20090606_kokua_line|newspaper=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|date=June 6, 2009|accessdate=January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "record of live birth", partially handwritten and partially typed, was created and submitted in 1961 when Obama was born, and is "located in a bound volume in a file cabinet on the first floor of the state Department of Health". The document was used to create the state's electronic records, and has been examined by state officials multiple times since the controversy began.&lt;ref name="AG" /&gt;

In releasing the certificate, the Obama website declared that the rumors "aren't actually about that piece of paper&amp;nbsp;– they're about manipulating people into thinking Barack is not an American citizen".&lt;ref name="obama-truth"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fightthesmears.com/articles/5/birthcertificate|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922222958/http://fightthesmears.com/articles/5/birthcertificate|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 22, 2008|title=The truth about Barack's birth certificate|publisher=Obama for America|date=June 12, 2008|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign also provided the [[Daily Kos]] blog with a copy of the document.&lt;ref name="found and posted"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Geraghty, Jim |date=June 12, 2008 |url=http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NWVjN2I1MjlhM2ZjZjRjYzBkODAxZjZkZGQyYWNkMDk= |title=Obama's Certification of Live Birth Found and Posted at Daily Kos |work=National Review |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715161516/http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/9471/obamas-certification-live-birth-found-and-posted-daily-kos |archivedate=July 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fight smears"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fightthesmears.com/|title=Fight the Smears|accessdate=February 1, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203021238/http://fightthesmears.com/|archivedate=February 3, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to this release, ''[[National Review]]'' columnist Jim Geraghty, wrote on June 12, 2008:

Frequent arguments of those questioning Obama's eligibility related to the fact that he did not originally release a copy of his "original" or "long form" birth certificate, but rather a "short form" version that did not include all of the information given on 1961 Hawaii-issued birth certificates. It was claimed that the use of the term "certification of live birth" on the first document means it is not equivalent to a "birth certificate".

====Rejection by conspiracy theorists====
The release of the certificate in 2008 resulted in a fresh round of questions. It was asserted that the certificate had been digitally forged with [[Adobe Photoshop]] and lacked a stamped seal of the state, which led them to demand that Obama release his "original" 1961 birth certificate.&lt;ref name="Weigel-Change"/&gt; [[Jerome Corsi]], author of the book ''[[The Obama Nation|The Obama Nation: Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality]]'', told [[Fox News]] that "the campaign has a false, fake birth certificate posted on their website... it's been shown to have watermarks from Photoshop. It's a fake document that's on the Web site right now, and the original birth certificate the campaign refuses to produce."&lt;ref name="factcheck"/&gt; This view was rejected by [[FactCheck.org]], which viewed the Obama campaign's hard copy of the Certification of Live Birth and reported that:

{{quote|FactCheck.org staffers have now seen, touched, examined and photographed the original birth certificate. We conclude that it meets all of the requirements from the State Department for proving U.S. citizenship. Claims that the document lacks a raised seal or a signature are false. We have posted high-resolution photographs of the document as "supporting documents" to this article. Our conclusion: Obama was born in the U.S.A. just as he has always said.&lt;ref name="factcheck"/&gt;}}

====Hawaii Department of Health response====
The director of Hawaii's Department of Health, Chiyome Fukino, issued a statement confirming that the state held Obama's "original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures".&lt;ref name="Reyes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; Noting "there have been numerous requests for Sen.

According to the website [[TVNewser]], [[CNN]]'s researchers stated in 2009 that the original birth certificate no longer existed, as Hawaii discarded all paper birth records in 2001, and the certification of live birth was the official copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gold|first=Matea|work=Los Angeles Times|title=CNN President Jon Klein declares Obama birther story 'dead'|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/07/cnn-president-jon-klein-declares-birther-story-dead.html|date=July 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contradicting this report, Janice Okubo, public information officer for the Hawaii DOH, said "We don't destroy vital records."&lt;ref name="officials confirm" /&gt; The Health Department's director emphasized the assertion:

Joshua Wisch, a spokesman for the Hawaii Attorney General's office, stated in 2011 that the original "long form" birth certificate&amp;nbsp;— described by Hawaiian officials as a "record of live birth" kept in the archives of the Hawaii Department of Health is "... a Department of Health record and it can't be released to anybody", including President Obama. Wisch added that state law does not authorize photocopying such records.&lt;ref name="AG"/&gt;

===Long form, 2011===
On April 22, 2011, Obama asked [[Loretta Fuddy]], director of the Hawaii Department of Health, for certified copies of his original Certificate of Live Birth ("long-form birth certificate").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/birth-certificate-correspondence.pdf|title=Correspondence with the Hawaii State Department of Health|accessdate=April 27, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502024801/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/birth-certificate-correspondence.pdf|archivedate=May 2, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accompanying the letter was a written request from Judith Corley, Obama's personal counsel, requesting a waiver of the department's policy of issuing only computer-generated certificates. Corley stated that granting the waiver would relieve the department of the burden of repeated inquiries into the President's birth records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/gov/newsroom/press-releases/AttachmentsToCertificateOfLiveBirthRelease.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809165634/http://hawaii.gov/gov/newsroom/press-releases/AttachmentsToCertificateOfLiveBirthRelease.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 9, 2011|title=Attachments to Certificate of Live Birth Release|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 25, 2011, Fuddy approved the request and witnessed the copying process as the health department's registrar issued the certified copies. The same day, Corley personally visited the department headquarters in Honolulu to pay the required fee on Obama's behalf, and received the two requested certified copies of the original birth certificate, an accompanying letter from Fuddy attesting to the authenticity of same, and a receipt for the processing fee. Fuddy said that she had granted the exception to its normal policy of issuing only computer-generated copies by virtue of Obama's status, in an effort to avoid ongoing requests for the birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=USA Today|first=David|last=Jackson|date=April 27, 2011|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/04/obama-releases-birth-records/1|title=Obama releases his Hawaii birth certificate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=71462e6edb79c23595f73fe38&amp;id=9d8904b9d5|title=Hawaii Health Department Grants President Obama's Request for Certified Copies of 'Long Form' Birth Certificate|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==False claims==

===Born in Kenya===
Some opponents of Obama's presidential eligibility claim that he was born in Kenya and was therefore not born a United States citizen. Whether Obama having been born outside the U.S. would have invalidated his U.S. citizenship at birth is debated. [[Political commentator]] Andrew Malcolm, of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', wrote that Obama would still be eligible for the presidency, regardless of where he was born, because his mother was an American citizen, saying that Obama's mother "could have been on Mars when wee Barry emerged and he'd still be American."&lt;ref name=Malcolm&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/06/barack-obama-birth-certificate.html|title=More questions about Barack Obama's birth certificate, still|last=Malcolm|first=Andrew|date=June 30, 2009|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contrary view is promoted by [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] Law Professor [[Eugene Volokh]], who has said that in the hypothetical scenario that Obama was born outside the U.S., he would {{em|not}} be a natural-born citizen, since the then-applicable law would have required Obama's mother to have been in the U.S. at least "five years after the age of 14", but Ann Dunham was three months shy of her 19th birthday when Obama was born.&lt;ref name="Volokh"&gt;Volokh interpreted the law differently in {{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-birth-certificate-30-oct30,0,1742172.story|title=Rumor calls Obama's birth certificate fake But his critics don't appear to have proof|last=Janega|first=James|date=October 30, 2008|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=February 1, 2011}}, but later posted a correction at {{Cite web|url=http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2008_11_30-2008_12_06.shtml#1227910730|title=Correction About Natural-Born Citizen Law|last=Volokh|first=Eugene|date=December 1, 2008|work=The Volokh Conspiracy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708201948/http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2008_11_30-2008_12_06.shtml|archivedate=July 8, 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;!--PLEASE NOTE: This is a legitimate reference to a blog entry.

====Obama's paternal step-grandmother's version of events====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS ABOUT THE SUBSECTION HEADING: there is a link in "Barack Obama presidential eligibility litigation#Keyes v. Bowen" that links here. Therefore, if you change this subsection heading, please fix the appropriate link --&gt;
An incorrect but popularly reported claim is that his father's stepmother, [[Sarah Onyango Obama|Sarah Obama]], told [[Anabaptist]] Bishop Ron McRae in a recorded transatlantic telephone conversation that she was present when Obama was born in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2009/07/24/liddy/|title=No, Obama's grandmother didn't say he was born in Kenya|first=Alex|last=Koppelman|date=July 23, 2009|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy newspapers]] gave an explanation of how the story about Obama's step-grandmother began. The tape is cut off in the middle of the conversation, before the passage in which she clarifies her meaning: "'Obama was not born in [[Mombasa]]. He was born in America,' the translator says after talking to the woman. ... Another response later says, 'Obama in Hawaii. Hawaii. She says he was born in Hawaii.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomma|first=Steven|title=Here's the truth: 'Birther' claims are just plain nuts|publisher=McClatchy Newspapers|date=July 30, 2009|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/227/story/72794.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Obama shed more light on the controversy in a 2007 interview with the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. In the interview, Obama's paternal step-grandmother stated that six months after Barack Obama Sr. and Ann Dunham were married, she received a letter at her home in Kenya announcing the birth of Barack Obama II, who was born August 4, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jones |first=Tim |title=Barack Obama: Mother not just a girl from Kansas |work=Hartford Courant |date=March 27, 2007 |url=http://www.courant.com/news/nationworld/world/chi-0703270151mar27-archive,0,2145571.story |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821054242/http://www.courant.com/news/nationworld/world/chi-0703270151mar27-archive%2C0%2C2145571.story |archivedate=August 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a June 2012 interview at her Kenyan home, Sarah Obama was asked: "Some people want to believe that the president was born in Kenya. Have these people ever bothered you or asked for his birth certificate?" Her response was: "But Barack Obama wasn't born in Kenya."&lt;ref name=Carmon&gt;{{cite news|last=Carmon|first=Irin|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/06/22/barack_obama_wasnt_born_in_kenya/|title=Barack Obama wasn't born in Kenya|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fake Kenyan birth certificate====
On August 2, 2009, [[Orly Taitz]] released and attached to court documents a purported Kenyan birth certificate which she said, if authenticated and shown to be genuine, would significantly narrow and shorten the discovery and pre-trial litigation period in the [[Barack Obama presidential eligibility litigation#Keyes v. Bowen|''Keyes v. Bowen'']] lawsuit, in which the plaintiffs asked for a judicial order that Obama provide documentation that he is a natural-born citizen of the United States. Legal papers submitted describe the document as an "unauthenticated color photocopy of certified copy of registration of birth".&lt;ref name="CopyofKenyanDocument"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Kenyan Birth Certificate: Obama Birthers Latch On To Forgery|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/03/kenyan-birth-certificate_n_249850.html|first=Rachel|last=Weiner|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/08/04/Birther-She-has-Obama-birth-certificate/UPI-75631249420557/ "Kenya 'birth certificate' said to be fake"], United Press International. August 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
The document was almost immediately revealed to be a forgery. It purports to have been issued by the "Republic of Kenya", when in fact, such a state did not yet exist at the time of Obama's birth as indicated on the document (Kenya was a [[British Kenya|British Colony]] until 1963).&lt;ref&gt;Snopes.com: [http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/birthers/kenyacert.asp Kenyan Mistake.] February 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, evidence was unearthed that the alleged Kenyan birth certificate was a modified version of a 1959 Australian birth certificate found on an online genealogy website.&lt;ref&gt;Rosendorff, Dina.

===Not born in Hawaii===
Despite the existence of Obama's Hawaii certification of live birth, [[Barack Obama presidential eligibility litigation#Terrence Lakin|Terry Lakin's]] attorney, among others, have claimed that anyone, including foreign-born children, could acquire a Hawaiian certification of live birth, and so Obama's possession of such a certificate does not prove that he was born in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cooper|first=Anderson|title=Release birth certificate, military doctor demands|url=http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/06/video-release-birth-certificate-military-doctor-demands-2/|work=CNN: Anderson Cooper 360|date=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the suggestion that this could have applied to Obama was rejected by Janice Okubo, director of communications for the Hawaii Department of Health: "If you were born in [[Bali]], for example, you could get a certificate from the state of Hawaii saying you were born in Bali. You could not get a certificate saying you were born in Honolulu. The state has to verify a fact like that for it to appear on the certificate".&lt;ref name="Weigel-dogs"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Weigel|first=David|work=[[Washington Independent]]|title={{-'}}Birther' Movement Dogs Republicans|url=http://washingtonindependent.com/51489/birther-movement-picks-up-steam|date=July 17, 2009|accessdate=July 20, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725043238/http://washingtonindependent.com/51489/birther-movement-picks-up-steam|archivedate=July 25, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another fact that refutes this specific claim is that the law allowing foreign-born children to obtain Hawaiian birth certificates did not exist until 20 years after Obama was born, while Obama's published birth certificate says his birth information was recorded four days after his birth in 1961, and explicitly states that he was born in Honolulu.&lt;ref name="Kornhaber"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kornhaber|first=Spencer|title=Meet Orly Taitz, Queen Bee of People Obsessed With Barack Obama's Birth Certificate|url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2009-06-18/news/orly-taitz/1|work=OC Weekly|location=Costa Mesa, CA|date=June 17, 2009|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Obama birth announcement.jpg|thumb|left|303px|The Barack Obama birth announcement, published in ''[[The Honolulu Advertiser]]'' on August 13, 1961.]]
In 1961, birth notices for Barack Obama were published in both the ''[[Honolulu Advertiser]]'' and the ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]'' on August 13 and 14, 1961, respectively, listing the home address of Obama's parents as 6085 Kalanianaole Highway in Honolulu.&lt;ref name="honadv-09Nov08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="factcheck"/&gt; On November 9, 2008, in response to the persistent rumors, the ''Advertiser'' posted on its web site a screenshot of the announcement taken from its microfilmed archives. Such notices were sent to newspapers routinely by the Hawaii Department of Health.&lt;ref name="honadv-09Nov08"/&gt;

In an editorial published on July 29, 2009, the ''Star-Bulletin'' pointed out that both newspapers' vital-statistics columns are available on microfilm in the main state library.

It has been suggested that Obama obtained Indonesian citizenship (and thus may have [[United States nationality law#Loss of citizenship|lost U.S. citizenship]]) when he lived there as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornhaber|2009|p=[http://www.ocweekly.com/2009-06-18/news/orly-taitz/4 4]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an attempt to prove that Obama was no longer a U.S. citizen (or held dual citizenship), some claim his 1981 trip to Pakistan took place at a time when there was supposedly a ban on United States passport holders entering that country, which would in turn have required him to use a non-U.S. passport. There was in fact no such ban. A ''New York Times'' article and [[U.S. State Department]] travel advisories from 1981 make it clear that travel to Pakistan by U.S. passport holders was legal at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Barbara Crossette|authorlink=Barbara Crossette|title=Lahore, a Survivor With a Bittersweet History|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/14/travel/lahore-a-survivor-with-a-bittersweet-history.html|work=The New York Times|date=June 14, 1981|accessdate=March 23, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220094017/http://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/14/travel/lahore-a-survivor-with-a-bittersweet-history.html|archivedate=February 20, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_Travel"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lahore; Letters to the Travel Editor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/23/travel/l-lahore-243000.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=lahore%20travel%201981&amp;st=cse|first=John S.|last=Brims|work=The New York Times|date=August 23, 1981|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="State_Advisory"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Travel Advisory No. 81-33A|work=Passport Services/Bureau of Consular Affairs|publisher=U.S Department of State|date=August 17, 1981|url=http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/travel/cis/southasia/TA_Pakistan1981.pdf|accessdate=March 23, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806051033/http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/travel/cis/southasia/TA_Pakistan1981.pdf|archive-date=August 6, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[April Fools' Day]] hoax email circulated on the Internet starting in 2009.  It falsely claimed that Obama applied to Occidental College under the name "Barry Soetoro" claiming to be "a foreign student from Indonesia" in order to obtain a Fulbright scholarship (which does not exist for undergraduate students from Indonesia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/birthers/occidental.asp|title=The Occidental Tourist|date=September 17, 2009|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputes over "natural-born citizen" requirements==
Another theory of Obama's ineligibility is that, regardless of his place of birth, he does not meet the constitutional definition of a [[natural-born citizen]].

The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] states: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States...." According to law professor [[Gabriel J. Chin]], "there is agreement that 'natural born citizens' include those made citizens by birth under the 14th Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Who's really eligible to be president?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/04/20/chin.natural.born/index.html|first=Gabriel|last=Chin|publisher=CNN|date=April 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/citizen.asp|title=Native Son|publisher=[[Snopes]]|date=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this agreement, two similar but distinct theories nonetheless contend Obama, although born in Hawaii, does not qualify as a "natural-born citizen".&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{Cite news|title=Court won't review Obama's eligibility to serve |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-obama-birth-certificate1dec08,0,7258812.story |date=December 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 12, 2010 |first=Tim |last=Jones |work=Chicago Tribune |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024151754/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-obama-birth-certificate1dec08%2C0%2C7258812.story |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnes-Obama"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Obama Citizenship&amp;nbsp;– Supreme Court Declines To Hear Challenge|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/08/AR2008120803710.html|first=Robert|last=Barnes|work=The Washington Post |date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parental citizenship===
Some campaigners, such as the Tennessee-based Liberty Legal Foundation, contend that in order for a person to be a natural-born citizen within the meaning of Article II, Section 1, it is necessary that both parents be U.S. citizens at the time of that person's birth. Those who subscribe to this theory argue that since Obama's father was not a U.S. citizen, Obama could not have been a natural-born citizen, and is therefore ineligible to be President of the United States. The Liberty Legal Foundation has cited a passage in the decision on an 1875 voting rights case which came before the U.S. Supreme Court—''[[Minor v. Happersett]]''—in which the court stated there was no doubt that "all children born in a country of parents who were its citizens" were natural-born citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/10/28/41005.htm|title=Birthers Sue Democratic National Committee|first=Jamie|last=Ross|date=October 28, 2011|work=[[Courthouse News Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertylegalfoundation.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Federal-DNC-Complaint.pdf Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=Josve05a |fix-attempted=yes }}, pp. 3, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This legal theory on Obama's eligibility was unsuccessfully litigated several times, most notably in ''[[Ankeny v. Governor of the State of Indiana]]'' (2008).

===Dual citizenship===
Others, including New Jersey attorney [[Donofrio v. Wells|Leo Donofrio]], have falsely claimed that a person cannot be a natural-born citizen if he is a dual citizen at birth. Those who subscribe to this theory argue that because Obama's father was a [[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies]] at the time Obama was born, Obama was born a dual citizen and therefore was not a natural-born citizen.&lt;ref name="Barnes-Obama"/&gt;

In August 2008, the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' ran an online article asserting that Obama is both a U.S. and a Kenyan citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/aug/06/things-you-might-not-know-about-barack-obama/|title=Things you might not know about Barack Obama|date=August 6, 2008|work=Rocky Mountain News|location=Denver, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt; This turned out to be incorrect according to FactCheck.org, which noted that Obama was indeed born a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC) under British law, by virtue of his descent from a Kenyan father at a time when Kenya was a British colony, but lost CUKC citizenship and became a Kenyan citizen when that country gained independence in 1963. However, Kenya's 1963 constitution prohibited dual citizenship in adulthood. Obama therefore automatically lost his Kenyan citizenship on his 23rd birthday in 1984, by failing to formally renounce any non-Kenyan citizenship and swear an oath of allegiance to Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Obama's Kenyan Citizenship?|publisher=[[FactCheck.org]]|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2008/08/obamas-kenyan-citizenship/|first=Joe|last=Miller|date=September 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the paper apologized for the error and published a correction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/aug/15/eight-word-gaffe-ripples-across-web/ | last1 = Temple | first1 = John | newspaper = Rocky Mountain News | title = TEMPLE: 8-word gaffe ripples across Web | date = August 15, 2008 | accessdate = August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the article continued to provide fuel for online rumors about Obama's eligibility for the presidency. The [[Constitution of Kenya|current Kenyan constitution]] effective since 2010 permits dual citizenship, but requires those who lost Kenyan citizenship prior to 2010 to complete a registration process in order to regain citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;https://fns.immigration.go.ke/infopack/citizenship/regaining/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigners and proponents==
[[Image:No-obama.jpg|thumb|A protestor questioning the legitimacy of Obama's birth certificate]]
Notable advocates of the view that Obama may not be eligible for the Presidency include [[Philip J. Berg]], a [[Pennsylvania]] attorney and [[9/11 conspiracy theories|9/11 conspiracy theorist]]. Berg describes himself as a "moderate to liberal" Democrat who backed [[Hillary Clinton]] for president.&lt;ref&gt;Rizo, Chris (December 8, 2008).

[[Orly Taitz]], a California dentist and attorney who emigrated from the [[Soviet Union]] to [[Israel]], then to the United States, and holds dual U.S. and Israeli citizenship, has been called the "queen bee of the birthers", because she is often seen as the face of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/08/13/orly_taitz|title=What Orly Taitz Believes|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|last=Winant|first=Gabriel|date=August 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable advocates include [[Andy Martin (American politician)|Andy Martin]], a [[perennial candidate]] who was "widely credited with starting the cyberwhisper campaign" that Obama is a secret Muslim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/us/politics/13martin.html?_r=1&amp;hp|title=The Man Behind the Whispers|first=Jim|last=Rutenberg|work=The New York Times|date=October 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert L.

The website AmericaMustKnow.com encouraged visitors to lobby members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] to vote against Obama's confirmation as President and become [[faithless electors]].&lt;ref name="Weigel-Change"/&gt; Electors around the country received numerous letters and e-mails contending that Obama's birth certificate is a forgery and that he was born in Kenya, and requesting that Obama be denied the presidency.&lt;ref name="Crummy-Electors"&gt;{{Cite news|title=State's 9 electors unmoved by anti-Obama pitch|url=http://www.denverpost.com/president08/ci_11201168|author=Crummy, Karen E.|work=The Denver Post|date=December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the online campaigners coordinated their efforts with weekly conference calls, in which they discussed the latest news and how to advance the story.&lt;ref name="Barr-Whisper"&gt;{{cite news|title=Whisper campaign persists despite election |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/politico/20081207/pl_politico/16257 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211013725/http://news.yahoo.com/s/politico/20081207/pl_politico/16257|archivedate=December 11, 2008|author=Barr, Andy|work=The Politico|date=December 7, 2008|accessdate=December 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some celebrities have promoted or touched upon the ineligibility claims, as well. In August 2009, actor [[Chuck Norris]], while not embracing the eligibility claims, wrote an [[open letter]] to Obama urging that he officially release his "original birth certificate", saying, "Refusing to post your original birth certificate is an unwise political and leadership decision that is enabling the 'birther' controversy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creators.com/conservative/chuck-norris/what-obama-and-my-wife-have-in-common.html "What Obama and My Wife Have in Common"], Chuck Norris, August 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, [[Baltimore Orioles]] baseball player [[Luke Scott]] asserted in a [[Yahoo!]] interview that Obama "was not born here" and that his birth certificate was never released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hypervocal.com/politics/2010/meet-luke-scott-hes-a-baseball-birther/ Meet Luke Scott: He’s a Baseball Birther] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213154517/http://hypervocal.com/politics/2010/meet-luke-scott-hes-a-baseball-birther/ |date=December 13, 2010 }}, HyperVocal.com, December 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' reported that, in April 2011 during his stage show, [[Charlie Sheen]] said, "For starters, I was fucking born here, how about that?

Hill interviewed birther conspiracy advocate [[Orly Taitz]] at the National Religious Broadcasters Convention in Nashville for a February 10, 2009, segment [[podcast]]ed online by the [[IRN/USA Radio Network]]. During ''The Matthew Hill Show'' he stated:

During a December 3, 2009 interview on [[Rusty Humphries]]' [[radio talk show]], Humphries asked [[Sarah Palin]] if she would make Barack Obama's birth certificate a campaign issue in 2012, should she decide to run.

I don't know if I would have to bother to make it an issue, because I think that members of the electorate still want answers." Humphries followed up, asking whether she thinks Obama's birth certificate is a fair question to be looking at. Palin answered, "I think it's a fair question, just like I think past association and past voting records&amp;nbsp;– all of that is fair game.

In response, on July 21, 2010, ''[[The Hutchinson News]]'', a local paper in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]], withdrew their endorsement of Mann, saying that Mann "questions the citizenship of President Barack Obama despite evidence that is irrefutable to most objective, rational people&amp;nbsp;– including a birth certificate released by the Hawaii secretary of state and birth announcements printed in Honolulu's two major newspapers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hutchnews.com/Editorialblogs/edit-congress-withdraw-endorsement--1|title=U.S. House News withdraws endorsement of Tracey Mann for 'birther' views|date=July 21, 2010|work=The Hutchinson News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725064435/http://www.hutchnews.com/Editorialblogs/edit-congress-withdraw-endorsement--1|archivedate=July 25, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mann responded that he was "disappointed and mystified by the ''Hutchinson News''{{'}} decision to withdraw their endorsement over a misunderstanding of [his] position", as he is not "interested in pursuing this issue in Congress", and he has "never had any interest in spending any time on the matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/07/kansas_congressional_candidate.html|title=Kansas Congressional Candidate Just Can't Stop Accidentally Being a Birther|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mann was subsequently defeated in the Republican primary by state senator [[Tim Huelskamp]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarkin, Mary (August 27, 2010), [http://www.hutchnews.com/Todaystop/huelskampwin "Republican from Fowler takes 1st Congressional District primary"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505052158/http://www.hutchnews.com/Todaystop/huelskampwin |date=May 5, 2011 }}, ''The Hutchinson News''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mike Huckabee===
On February 28, 2011, on [[Steve Malzberg]]'s radio program [[Mike Huckabee]], a 2008 candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, falsely claimed that Obama had been raised in Kenya&lt;ref name=Huckabee/&gt; and that "[Obama] probably grew up hearing that the British were a bunch of imperialists who persecuted his grandfather."&lt;ref name=Huckabee&gt;{{Cite news|title=Huckabee Questions Obama Birth Certificate|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/01/huckabee-questions-obama-birth-certificate-claims-he-was-raised-in-kenya/|first=Michael|last=Shear|date=March 1, 2011|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huckabee, speaking on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', said that he misspoke and intended to say Indonesia, characterizing his own comment as a "verbal gaffe".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-oreilly-mike-huckabee-obama-kenya-madrassa-2011-3|date=March 3, 2011|accessdate=April 19, 2011|publisher=Business Insider|last=Loeb|first=Steven|title=Huckabee: I Misspoke When I Said Obama Was From Kenya, What I Meant Was He Was Never A Boy Scout}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michele Bachmann===
In March 2011, Representative [[Michele Bachmann]] told conservative radio host Jeff Katz on his program, "I'll tell you one thing, if I was ever to run for president of the United States, I think the first thing I would do in the first debate is offer my birth certificate, so we can get that off the table." Previously on ''[[Good Morning America]]'', when asked about President Obama's origins, she replied, "Well, that isn't for me to state. That's for the president to state."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Michele Bachmann: No birth flap for me|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0311/51245.html|first=Kendra|last=Marr|work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|date=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mike Coffman===
On May 12, 2012, [[Mike Coffman]], a congressman running for re-election in the Sixth Congressional District of [[Colorado]], addressed a Republican fund-raising event in [[Elbert County, Colorado|Elbert County]]. Coffman stated that he did not know where President Barack Obama was born. Coffman went on to say of Obama that "in his heart, he's not an American. He's just not an American." Coffman issued an apology on May 16, saying that he had misspoken and that he had confidence in President Obama's citizenship and legitimacy as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_20642001/mike-coffman-says-obama-not-an-american-at|title=Coffman Speech in Elbert County|date=May 16, 2012|accessdate=June 2, 2012|work=The Denver Post|first=Kyle|last=Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 23 ''Denver Post'' op-ed piece, Coffman described his comment as "inappropriate and boneheaded."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_20694265/mike-coffman-comment-was-inappropriate-boneheaded|title=Mike Coffman: Obama comment was boneheaded|first=Mike|last=Coffman|date=May 24, 2012|work=The Denver Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arizona electors===
In December 2012, three out of the eleven [[Electoral College (United States)|electors]] from Arizona who cast their votes for [[Mitt Romney]], raised doubts about Barack Obama's birthplace. One of those electors was the chair of the [[Republican Party of Arizona]], Tom Morrissey. Morrissey later insisted that he is not a birther, but stated that "In [his] opinion, what [he has] seen from the president, produced as a birth certificate, does not convince [him] that it is a real document."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2012/12/arizona_gop_chairman_tom_morri.php|title=Arizona GOP Chairman Tom Morrissey Says He's Not a "Birther," but Obama's Birth Certificate Doesn't Seem Real|date=Dec 18, 2012|first=Matthew|last=Hendley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-2009, the natural born citizen issue was one of the hottest and most lucrative sources of fundraising for organizations on the right that raise funds through direct mail and telemarketing. Online petition sites such as that of [[Alan Keyes]], who has been collecting signatures on the birth certificate issue, are a major source for generating mailing lists of movement conservatives.&lt;ref name=Bernstein&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bernstein|first=David S.|title=Birthers In The Mainstream|url=http://thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2009/07/22/birthers-in-the-mainstream.aspx|work=The Boston Phoenix|date=July 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The web site ''WorldNetDaily'' published more than 200 articles on the subject by July 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Weigel|first=David|title=Your Facts Are Useless on Me|url=http://washingtonindependent.com/51918/your-facts-are-useless-on-me|work=The Washington Independent|date=July 21, 2009|accessdate=July 23, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725232319/http://washingtonindependent.com/51918/your-facts-are-useless-on-me|archivedate=July 25, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has sold billboards, bumper stickers and postcards asking "Where's the birth certificate?" and similar slogans in an effort which has "already raised tens of thousands of dollars."&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lewis|first=Errol|title=Obama's critics launch the birth of a nutty nation|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2009/07/23/2009-07-23_obamas_critics_launch_the_birth_of_a_nutty_nation.html|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|date=July 23, 2009|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moderate conservatives have found themselves "bombarded with birther stuff".&lt;ref name=Bernstein/&gt; Protesters at the [[Tea Party protests]] in 2009 carried signs about the birth certificate issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ingold|first=John|title=5,000 attend tax-day 'tea party' at Capitol|url=http://www.denverpost.com/rockiesmailbag/ci_12147073|work=The Denver Post|date=April 15, 2009|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which were recommended by protest organizers.&lt;ref name=Bernstein/&gt; In an incident that attracted widespread media coverage, moderate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Representative [[Michael Castle]] was booed and heckled during a July 2009 town hall meeting in [[Georgetown, Delaware]], when he told a woman protesting about Obama's birth certificate: "if you're referring to the president there, he is a citizen of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Guadiano |first=Nicole |title=Castle gets booed; video hits the Web |url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20090721/NEWS/307210003 |work=The News Journal |location=Wilmington, DE |date=July 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724082909/http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20090721/NEWS/307210003 |archivedate=July 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NBC Nightly News]] reported that other members of Congress often hear the issue too; an anonymous congressman told the program that he was reluctant to advertise his own town hall meetings for fear of this issue drowning out everything else.&lt;ref name=NightlyNews&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/32091472#32091472 "Obama's Birthplace Still blog fodder"], ''NBC Nightly News''.

A number of Republican legislators have [[United States presidential eligibility legislation|proposed legislation and constitutional amendments]] at the state and federal levels to address issues raised by the birth certificate campaigners. Some Republicans are said to "want the issue to go away", seeing it as a distraction. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] commentators have criticized the reluctance of some Republicans to distance themselves from the proponents of the conspiracy theories, suggesting that "Republican officials are reluctant to denounce the birthers for fear of alienating an energetic part of their party's base".&lt;ref name="Crary-New burst"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Crary |first=David |url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20090723/AP09/307239793 |title=New burst of attention for old doubts about Obama |agency=Associated Press |work=Omaha Press |date=July 23, 2009 |access-date=May 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326205720/http://www.omaha.com/article/20090723/AP09/307239793 |archive-date=March 26, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBC News]]' "First Read" team commented: "the real story in all of this is that Republican Party has a HUGE problem with its base right now."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Murray|first=Mark|title=First thoughts: Finding an enemy|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/07/21/2002893.aspx|publisher=MSNBC|date=July 21, 2009|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Republican National Committee]] Chairman [[Michael Steele]] released a statement through his spokesperson saying, "Chairman Steele believes that this is an unnecessary distraction and believes that the president is a U.S. citizen".&lt;ref&gt;Sargent, Greg (July 29, 2009).

Conservative [[Joel Pollak]], writing for ''[[The American Thinker]]'', has stated that the reason the "Birther theory" has caught on particularly among conservatives, is the weakness of the Republican opposition, stating:

{{quote|In the absence of strong Republican leadership, some find the Birther theory a compelling, if desperate, solution. Yet it is ultimately a self-destructive one&amp;nbsp;– not just because it is almost certainly false, but because it contradicts the essential spirit of the conservative movement.&lt;ref&gt;Pollak, Joel B.

Political analyst [[Marc Ambinder]] of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' and ''[[CBS News]]'' suggests this phenomenon goes to the heart of the dilemma now facing the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], positing that

{{quote|Republican presidential candidates need to figure out how to diffuse {{sic}} angry birthers who are bound to show up and demand their attention.

Political analyst [[Andrew Sullivan]], writing in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', stated 

{{quote|The demographics tell the basic story: a black man is president and a large majority of white southerners cannot accept that, even in 2009. They grasp conspiracy theories to wish Obama&amp;nbsp;– and the America he represents&amp;nbsp;– away.

===Opinion surveys===
In October 2008, the ''[[Orange County Register]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s OC Political Pulse poll found that a third of responding Republicans believed that Obama had been born outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=O.C. suspicions over Obama's citizenship continue|first=Martin|last=Wisckol|work=The Orange County Register|location=Santa Ana, CA|date=October 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result of the widespread publicity given to the citizenship controversy, 60% of respondents in an [[Ohio State University]] survey carried out in November 2008 had heard of the issue. However, only 10% believed the claims that Obama was not a citizen.&lt;ref name="AFP-Muslim"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Rumour that Barack Obama is Muslim was believed by 22pc|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=January 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opinion poll carried out for [[Daily Kos]] by [[Research 2000]] in July 2009 found that 77% of Americans believed that Obama was born in the U.S., while 11% didn't, and 12% were unsure. However, Republicans and Southerners were far more likely than other political or demographic groups to doubt that Obama was born in the United States. 58% of Republicans either believed that Obama was not born in the U.S. (28%) or were not sure (30%), with 42% believing that he was. An overwhelming majority of Democrats (93%) and independents (83%) believed that he was born in the U.S. Support for the belief that Obama was born outside the U.S. was strongest in the South, where only 47% of those polled believed he was born in the U.S., compared with an average of 90% of residents of the Northeast, Midwest and West.&lt;ref name="Thrush-poll"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Thrush|first=Glenn|publisher=Politico.com|title=58 percent of GOP not sure/doubt Obama born in US|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/glennthrush/0709/58_of_GOP_not_suredont_beleive_Obama_born_in_US.html|date=July 30, 2009|accessdate=July 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A marked racial disparity in the South was also apparent.

A [[Public Policy Polling]] survey carried out in August 2009 found that 32% of Republicans in [[Virginia]] thought that Obama was born in the U.S., 41% thought he was foreign-born and the remaining 27% were unsure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Goddard|first=Taegan|title=Just 32% of Virginia Republicans Think Obama is a Citizen|url=http://politicalwire.com/archives/2009/08/03/just_32_of_virginia_republicans_think_obama_is_a_citizen.html|work=Political Wire|date=August 3, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805074710/http://politicalwire.com/archives/2009/08/03/just_32_of_virginia_republicans_think_obama_is_a_citizen.html|archivedate=August 5, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Utah]], an August 2009 poll carried out for the ''[[Deseret News]]'' and [[KSL-TV]] found that 67% of Utahns accepted the evidence that Obama was born in the U.S. The poll found that those who do not believe that Obama was born in the United States, or do not know, are predominantly middle-aged, lower-income Republican-leaning individuals without a college education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bernick Jr.|first=Bob|title=Some Utahns still doubt Obama birth stats|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,705321969,00.html|work=Deseret News|location=Salt Lake City|date=August 7, 2009|accessdate=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Pew Research Center]] poll found that 80% of Americans had heard about the Obama citizenship claims by August 2009. The poll found a significant partisan divide in views of the news coverage, with 58% of Democrats saying that the allegations had received too much attention from the media. Republicans were more inclined to say that the allegations had received too little attention, with 39% expressing this view against only 26% saying that the controversy had received too much attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people-press.org/report/533/many-fault-media-coverage-of-health-care|date=August 6, 2009|title=Many Fault Media Coverage of Health Care Debate|publisher=The Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press|accessdate=April 19, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508214118/http://people-press.org/report/533/many-fault-media-coverage-of-health-care|archivedate=May 8, 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Harris Poll]] online survey of 2,320 adults conducted in March 2010, 25% of the respondents said they believed that Obama was "not born in the United States and so is not eligible to be president."&lt;ref name=HarrisPoll201003&gt;[http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NewsRoom/HarrisPolls/tabid/447/ctl/ReadCustom%20Default/mid/1508/ArticleId/223/Default.aspx {{"'}}Wingnuts' and President Obama"], Harris Polls, March 24, 2010.

The percentage of doubters plummeted after President Obama released the long form certificate in April 2011.&lt;ref name="Understanding American Government"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A Theory of Conspiracy Theories"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;  A [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] telephone poll of 1018 adults conducted in May 2011 found that 5% of respondents believed that Obama was "definitely born in another country" and 8% believed he was "probably born in another country", versus 47% believing he was "definitely" and 18% "probably" born in the US.&lt;ref name="GallupPoll-2011-05"/&gt; Broken down by political affiliation, the same poll found that 23% of self-identified Republicans, 14% of independents, and 5% of Democrats thought Obama was definitely or probably born in another country.&lt;ref name="GallupPoll-2011-05"/&gt;

In July 2016, four months before Donald Trump was elected to the presidency, 41 percent of Republicans disagreed that Obama was born in the United States and 31 percent neither agreed nor disagreed, per an NBC poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Clinton |first1=Josh |first2=Carrie |last2=Roush |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/poll-persistent-partisan-divide-over-birther-question-n627446 |title=Poll: Persistent Partisan Divide Over 'Birther' Question |publisher=NBC News  |date=August 10, 2016  |access-date=October 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dilemma for Republicans===
Because a portion of Republican voters and their [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] supporters believe Obama is not eligible to hold public office (see [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories#Opinion surveys|Opinion surveys section]]), Republicans sometimes found themselves caught in a dilemma between losing support or damaging their credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/birther-boom/ |title='Birther' Boom|work=The New York Times|first=Eric|last=Etheridge|date=July 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/40644.html|title=41% of Republicans: President Obama foreign-born|work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|first=Andy|last=Barr|date=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had "to walk the fine line of humoring conspiracy-minded supporters without explicitly questioning Obama's legitimacy..."&lt;ref name=Buck&gt;{{Cite news|title=Senate Tea-Party Candidate Accidentally Reveals What He Thinks of Birthers|date=July 26, 2010 |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/07/gop_senate_candidate_getting_t.html|first=Dan|last=Amira|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Republicans, including former Minnesota governor [[Tim Pawlenty]] and former Pennsylvania senator [[Rick Santorum]], however, have plainly rejected these claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/potential-gop-candidates-face-birther-question/2011/03/16/ABnx1Em_story.html|title=Potential GOP candidates face 'birther' question|work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|first=Nia-Malika|last=Henderson|date=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of these situations is [[Michael Castle]], then Representative for [[Delaware]], who ran in 2010 for the Senate seat vacated by Vice President [[Joe Biden]].

Proponents of claims doubting Obama's eligibility have been dubbed "birthers" by their critics, who have drawn a parallel with [[9/11 Truth Movement|9/11 conspiracy theorists]] or "truthers". Leslie Savan of ''[[The Nation]]'' has compared the so-called "birthers" to other groups as well, including those who [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|deny the moon landing]], the [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust]] or [[Climate change denial|global warming]]; "Teabaggers who refuse to believe they must pay taxes" and [[Young Earth creationism|creationists who believe the earth is 6,000 years old]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Savan, Leslie|date=July 24, 2009|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/birthers-nation?page=0,0,0,2|title=The Birthers of a Nation|work=[[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MSNBC]] political commentator [[Rachel Maddow]] has defined a "birther" as:

A number of conservative commentators have criticized its proponents and their effect on the wider conservative movement. Talk show host [[Michael Medved]] has also been critical, calling them "the worst enemy of the conservative movement" for making other conservatives "look sick, troubled and not suitable for civilized company."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Greg|last=Victor|title=New Ideas, Sharp Opinions|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=March 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative columnist [[Ann Coulter]] has referred to them as "just a few cranks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/aug/06/poll-finds-doubts-on-obamas-birth/ |title=Poll finds doubts on Obama's birth |work=The Washington Times |last1=Abruzzese |first1=Sarah |last2=Ward |first2=Jon |date=August 6, 2009 |accessdate=February 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215210350/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/aug/06/poll-finds-doubts-on-obamas-birth/ |archivedate=February 15, 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2008 presidential campaign, [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] pundit [[Steve Sailer]] similarly dismissed birthers' claims, considering the theory that Obama was born in Kenya to be especially implausible: 

{{quote|Do you know how many different flights she [Ann Dunham] would have had to take to get to Kenya in 1961? Honolulu to California, California to the East Coast, the East Coast (refueling at Gander Bay) to London, London to maybe Cairo, Cairo to Nairobi. How much would that have cost?

An editorial in the ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]'' dismissed the claims about Obama's eligibility as proposing "a vast conspiracy involving Obama's parents, state officials, the news media, the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], think-tanks and a host of yet-to-be-uncovered others who have connived since Obama's birth to build a false record so that he could eventually seek the presidency 47 years later."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Editorial|title=Peddlers of lies about Obama are an unprincipled lot|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|date=December 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[St. Petersburg Times|St. Petersburg Times']]'' fact-checking website, PolitiFact.com, concluded its series of articles on the birth certificate issue by saying:

{{quote|There is not one shred of evidence to disprove PolitiFact's conclusion that the candidate's name is Barack Hussein Obama, or to support allegations that the birth certificate he released isn't authentic.

In November 2008, commentator and social critic [[Camille Paglia]] criticized the "blathering, fanatical overkill" of the topic, but also questioned Obama's response: "Obama could have ended the entire matter months ago by publicly requesting Hawaii to issue a fresh, long-form, stamped certificate and inviting a few high-profile reporters in to examine the document and photograph it", she said.&lt;ref name="surfs"&gt;Paglia, Camille (November 12, 2008). [http://www.salon.com/opinion/paglia/2008/11/12/palin/ "Obama surfs through,"] ''Salon''.&lt;/ref&gt; A parenthetical in the same article noted that "(The campaign did make the "short-form" certificate available to [[Factcheck.org]])".&lt;ref name="surfs"/&gt;

Factcheck.org noted, "The Hawaii Department of Health's birth record request form does not give the option to request a photocopy of your long-form birth certificate, but their short form has enough information to be acceptable to the State Department."&lt;ref name="factcheck"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hawaii.gov/health/vital-records/pdf/birth.pdf "Hawaii birth record request form"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in December 2008, Alex Koppelman discussed the validity of the common argument&amp;nbsp;– that Obama should release a copy of his full, original certificate and the rumors and doubts would disappear.&lt;ref name="Alex"/&gt; Conspiracy theory experts told Koppelman that when committed conspiracists are presented with more data debunking their theory, they refuse to accept the new evidence. "Whatever can't be ignored can be twisted to fit into the narrative; every new disclosure of something that should, by rights, end the controversy only opens up new questions, identifies new plotters", he wrote.&lt;ref name="Alex"/&gt; Because Obama's release of the short-form had only "stoked the fever of conspiracy mongers", Koppelman predicted that releasing the long-form certificate "would almost certainly" continue the rumor cycle.&lt;ref name="Alex"/&gt;

In response to the notion that Obama's grandparents might have planted a birth announcement in newspapers just so their grandson could some day be president, FactCheck suggested that "those who choose to go down that path should first equip themselves with a high-quality [[tinfoil hat]]."&lt;ref name="factcheck"/&gt; Brooks Jackson, the director of FactCheck, comments that "it all reflects a surge of paranoid distress among people who don't like Barack Obama" and who want the election results to go away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Anti-Obama bloggers challenge birthplace|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/v-print/story/57036.html|first=Rick|last=Montgomery|work=Kansas City Star|date=December 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chip Berlet]], a journalist who has studied the spread of conspiracy theories, notes

Obama is not the first President to be the subject of controversy surrounding the location of his birth. [[Andrew Jackson]] was the subject of similar claims, although it is not certain that they were raised during his presidency. Some said that [[Chester A.

==Impact on the 2012 presidential election and beyond==
In May 2012, the Arizona Secretary of State, [[Ken Bennett]], asked Hawaii to verify Obama's Hawaiian birth to ensure his eligibility to appear on the November ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/2012/05/22/20120522obama-birth-hawaii-arizona-verification.html|title=Hawaii sends Arizona verification of Obama's birth|first=Yvonne Wingett|last=Sanchez|date=May 22, 2012 |work=[[The Arizona Republic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Bennett proved that he needed the information as part of the regular course of official business, Hawaii officially confirmed that the information in the copy of the Certificate of Live Birth for the President matches the original record in their files.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/05/24/arizona-birther-renaissance-sparked-by-sheriff-arpaio-secretary-of-state-bennett.html|title=Arizona Birther Renaissance Sparked By Sheriff Arpaio, Secretary of State Bennett|date=May 24, 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/hawaii-verifies-president-obama-birth-records-arizona-elections-chief-ken-bennett-article-1.1083039|title=Hawaii verifies President Obama's birth records to Arizona's elections chief Ken Bennett|date=May 23, 2012|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same month, the Mississippi state Democratic Party requested Hawaii to verify that the long-form image on the White House website matched the copy on file and they were provided with a certified verification, bearing the state seal and signed by state registrar [[Alvin T.

==White House responses==
A common claim among those arguing that President Obama was not born in Hawaii is that all doubt would be settled if Obama released his "long form" birth certificate. However, commentators noted that doing so would be disadvantageous to Obama. First, it would encourage speculation as to why it took so long to release the document. Second, caving in to his political adversaries' demands would embolden them by giving them a victory. Finally, it would open the door to demands for other personal records unrelated to his birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/08/05/birther_faq/|title=Salon's handy-dandy guide to refuting the Birthers|date=August 5, 2009|accessdate=August 5, 2009|last=Koppelman|first=Alex|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|quote=Myth #8 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809023256/http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/08/05/birther_faq/|archivedate=August 9, 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these concerns, both Obama and his press secretary have responded to reporters' questions about the issue.

===Press secretary's response===
At the end of the May 27, 2009, [[news conference|press briefing]], ''WorldNetDaily'' reporter [[Lester Kinsolving]] asked about Obama's birth certificate. [[White House press secretary]] [[Robert Gibbs]] replied, "It's on the Internet", to which Kinsolving responded "No, no, no&amp;nbsp;– the long form listing his hospital and physician." Gibbs responded as follows:

{{quote|Lester, this question in many ways continues to astound me. The state of Hawaii provided a copy with the seal of the President's birth. I know there are apparently at least 400,000 people (laughter) that continue to doubt the existence of and the certification by the state of Hawaii of the President's birth there, but it's on the Internet because we put it on the Internet for each of those 400,000 to download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/video/White-House-Press-Briefing-7/27/09#transcript|title = Official transcript of the May 27, 2009, WhiteHouse press briefing|publisher = obamawhitehouse.archives.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At a July 27, 2009, press briefing, radio talk show host [[Bill Press]] asked Gibbs if there was anything he could say to make the issue go away. Gibbs answered, "No. I mean, the God's honest truth is no," because "nothing will assuage" those who continue to pursue what he called "made-up, fictional nonsense" despite the evidence that Obama had already provided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Briefing-by-White-House-Press-Secretary-Robert-Gibbs-7-27-09/ Press briefing by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs], White House (July 27, 2009).

On August 6, 2009, Gibbs commented, "You couldn't sell this script in Hollywood," and summarized the contentions that he considered "totally crazy":

At the February 2010 [[National Prayer Breakfast]], Obama commented, "Surely you can question my policies without questioning my faith. Or for that matter my citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Obama Takes On Birthers, Uganda Anti-Gay Law At Prayer Breakfast (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/04/obama-takes-on-birthers-u_n_449087.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|first=Sam|last=Stein|date=February 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He directly addressed the issue in August 2010, in an interview with [[Brian Williams]]. Williams asked Obama about the fact that a fifth of the American people do not believe that he is either American born or a Christian. Obama responded that "there is a mechanism, a network of misinformation that in a new media era can get churned out there constantly". He then added "I can't spend all my time with my birth certificate plastered on my forehead."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/41575.html|title=President Obama blasts lies, disinformation|work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|first=Glenn|last=Thrush|date=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a few occasions, Obama has joked about the conspiracy theories surrounding his birth certificate and citizenship. At the 2010 [[White House Correspondents' Association|White House Correspondents' Dinner]], Obama said there are few things in life harder to find and more important to keep than love, and then added, "Well, love and a birth certificate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/01/2010-white-house-correspo_n_559901.html|title=Obama Kills At White House Correspondents Dinner|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2011 [[Gridiron Dinner]], Obama referred to [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s song, "[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]", and commented, "Some things just bear repeating."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/whitehouse/obama-daniels-crack-wise-at-gridiron-dinner-20110313?mrefid=mostViewed|title=Obama, Daniels Crack Wise at Gridiron Dinner|work=[[National Journal]]|first=Kathy|last=Kiely|date=March 13, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 17, 2011 ([[Saint Patrick's Day]]), Obama said, "Now, speaking of ancestry, there has been some controversy about my own background. Two years into my presidency, some are still bent on peddling rumors about my origins. So today, I want to put all those rumors to rest. It is true my great-great-great-grandfather really was from Ireland. It's true. [[Moneygall]], to be precise. I can't believe I have to keep pointing this out."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/politico44/perm/0311/wheres_this_guy_from_e2d453ec-b54c-44f5-9757-cbcec3fe786a.html|title=Obama keeps joking about birthers|work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|first=Matt|last=Negrin|date=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 17, 2012, during a televised tribute to actress [[Betty White]] on her 90th birthday, Obama taped a segment in which he wrote White a letter saying that, given her appearance and vitality, he not only could not believe she was 90, he ''did not'' believe her, and requested to see her birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2088434/Obama-asks-Betty-Whites-long-form-birth-certificate-vivacious-stars-90th-birthday.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|title=Obama asks for Betty White's long form birth certificate on vivacious star's 90th birthday|first=Michael|last=Zennie|date=January 18, 2012|work=Daily Mail|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 2011 interview with [[George Stephanopoulos]], Obama said, "I think that over the last two and a half years there's been an effort to go at me in a way that is politically expedient in the short-term for Republicans, but creates, I think a problem for them when they want to actually run in a general election where most people feel pretty confident the President was born where he says he was, in Hawaii. He doesn't have horns. We may disagree with him on some issues and we may wish that you know, the unemployment rate was coming down faster and we want him to know his plan on gas prices. But we're not really worrying about conspiracy theories or ... birth certificates. And so ... I think it presents a problem for them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Obama: Donald Trump's birth certificate talk helps me|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-obama-trump-birth-20110415,0,5233740.story?track=rss|work=Los Angeles Times|first=James|last=Oliphant|date=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 2011, referring to "sideshows and carnival barkers",&lt;ref name="MSNBCStatement"/&gt; Obama appeared in the White House press room an hour after the release of the long form and said, "I know there is going to be a segment of people for which no matter what we put out this issue will not be put to rest. But I am speaking to the vast majority of the American people, as well as to the press. We do not have time for this kind of silliness.

Later in 2011, [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012|Obama's re-election campaign]] offered for sale mugs with a picture of Obama (captioned "Made in the USA") and the image of the birth certificate. The campaign states, "There's really no way to make the conspiracy about President Obama's birth certificate completely go away, so we might as well laugh at it&amp;nbsp;– and make sure as many people as possible are in on the joke."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Made In The USA Mug|publisher=Obama for America|url=http://store.barackobama.com/made-in-the-usa-mug.html|accessdate=September 4, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723002253/http://store.barackobama.com/made-in-the-usa-mug.html|archivedate=July 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''breech birth''' is when a baby is born bottom first instead of head first. Around 3-5% of pregnant women at term (37–40 weeks pregnant) have a breech baby.&lt;ref name=Hof2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofmeyr|first1=GJ|last2=Hannah|first2=M|last3=Lawrie|first3=TA|title=Planned caesarean section for term breech delivery.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=21 July 2015|volume=7|pages=CD000166|pmid=26196961|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000166.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most babies in the breech position are born by a [[caesarean section]] because it is seen as safer than being born vaginally.&lt;ref name=Hof2015/&gt; Doctors and midwives in the developing world have thus lost many of the skills required to safely assist women giving birth to a breech baby vaginally.&lt;ref name="Hof2015"/&gt; Delivering all breech babies by caesarean section in developing countries is difficult to implement as there are not always resources available to provide this service.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Cause==
With regard to the fetal presentation during pregnancy, three periods have been distinguished.

During the first period, which lasts until the 24th gestational week, the incidence of a [[Presentation (obstetrics)#Lie|longitudinal lie]] increases, with equal proportions of breech or cephalic presentations from this lie. This period is characterized by frequent changes of presentations. The fetuses in breech presentation during this period have the same probability for breech and cephalic presentation at delivery.

During the second period, lasting from the 25th to the 35th gestational week, the incidence of cephalic presentation increases, with a proportional decrease of breech presentation. The second period is characterized by a higher than random probability that the fetal presentation during this period will also be present at the time of delivery. The increase of this probability is gradual and identical for breech and cephalic presentations during this period.

In the third period, from the 36th gestational week onward, the incidence of cephalic and breech presentations remain stable, i.e. breech presentation around 3-4% and cephalic presentation approximately 95%. In the general population, incidence of breech presentation at preterm corresponds to the incidence of breech presentation when birth occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller EC, Kouam L | year = 1981 | title = Frequency of breech presentation during pregnancy and on full term | url = | journal = Zentralbl Gynakol | volume = 103 | issue = | pages = 105–109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hill L | year = 2008 | title = Prevalence of Breech Presentation by Gestational Age | url = | journal = American Journal of Perinatology | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 92–93 | doi=10.1055/s-2007-999455 | pmid=2403797}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hughey MJ | year = 1985 | title = Fetal position during pregnancy | url = | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 153 | issue = | pages = 885–886 | doi=10.1016/s0002-9378(85)80276-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sørensen |first1=T |last2=Hasch |first2=E |last3=Lange |first3=AP |year=1979 |title=Fetal presentation during pregnancy |url= |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue= |page=477 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(79)91536-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tadmor OP, Rabinowitz R, Alon L, Mostoslavky V, Aboulafia Y.

A breech presentation at delivery occurs when the fetus does not turn to a cephalic presentation. This failure to change presentation can result from endogenous and exogenous factors. Endogenous factors involve fetal inability to adequately move, whereas exogenous factors refer to insufficient intrauterine space available for fetal movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sekulić S, Zarkov M, Slankamenac P, Bozić K, Vejnović T, Novakov-Mikić A | year = 2009 | title = Decreased expression of the righting reflex and locomotor movements in breech-presenting newborns in the first days of life | url = | journal = Early Hum Dev. | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 263–6 | doi=10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2008.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidence of breech presentation among diseases and medical conditions with the incidence of breech presentation higher than occurs in the general population, shows that the probability of breech presentation is between 4% and 50%. These data are related to:
* 1. single series of medical entities;
* 2. collections of series for some particular medical entity;
* 3. data obtained from repeated observations under the same conditions;
* 4. series of two concomitant medical conditions.

===Rates in various medical conditions===
'''Fetal entities:''' First twin 17-30%; Second twin 28-39%; [[Stillborn]] 26%; [[Prader-Willi syndrome]] 50%, [[Werdnig-Hoffman syndrome]] 10%; [[Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome]] 40%; [[Fetal alcohol syndrome]] 40%; [[Potter anomaly]] 36%; [[Zellweger syndrome]] 27%; [[Myotonic dystrophy]] 21%, [[13 trisomy syndrome]] 12%; [[18 trisomy syndrome]] 43%; [[21 trisomy syndrome]] 5%; [[de Lange syndrome]] 10%; [[Anencephalus]] 6-18%, [[Spina bifida]] 20-30%; [[Congenital hydrocephalus]] 24-37%; [[Osteogenesis imperfecta]] 33.3%; [[Amyoplasia]] 33.3%; [[Achondrogenesis]] 33.3%; [[Amelia (birth defect)|Amelia]] 50%; [[Craniosynostosis]] 8%; [[Sacral agenesis]] 30.4%; [[Arthrogriposis]] multiplex congenita 33.3; Congenital [[dislocation of the hip]] 33.3%; [[Hereditary sensory neuropathy]] type III 25%; [[Centronuclear myopathy]] 16.7%; [[Multiple pituitary hormone deficiency]] 50%; [[Isolated pituitary hormone deficiency]] 20%; [[Ectopic posterior pituitary gland]] 33.3%; Congenital bilateral [[perisilvian syndrome]] 33.3; [[Symmetric fetal growth restriction]] 40%; [[Asymmetric fetal growth restriction]] 40%; Nonimmune [[hydrops fetalis]] 15%; [[Atresia ani]] 18.2%; [[Microcephalus]] 15.4%; [[Omphalocele]] 12.5%; [[Premature birth|Prematurity]] 40%

'''Placental and amniotic fluid entities:''' Amniotic sheet perpendicular to the placenta 50%; Cornual-fundal implantation of the placenta 30%; [[Placenta previa]] 12.5%; [[Oligohydramnios]] 17%; [[Polyhydramnios]] 15.8%

'''Maternal entities:''' [[Uterus arcuatus]] 22.6%; [[Uterus unicornuatus]] 33.3%; [[Uterus bicornuatus]] 34.8%; [[Uterus didelphys]] 30-41%; [[Uterus septus]] 45.8%; [[Leiomyoma]] uteri 9-20%; Spinal cord injury 10%; Carriers of [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] 17%

'''Combination of two medical entities:''' First twin in uterus with two bodies 14.29%; Second twin in uterus with two bodies 18.52%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Braun FH, Jones KL, Smith DW | year = 1975 | title = Breech presentation as an indicator of fetal abnormality | url = | journal = J Pediatr | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 419–21 | doi=10.1016/s0022-3476(75)80977-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sekulić SR, Mikov A, Petrović DS | year = 2010 | title = Probability of breech presentation and its significance | url = | journal = J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med. | volume = 23 | issue = 10| pages = 1160–4 | doi=10.3109/14767051003677996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, women with previous Caesarean deliveries have a risk of breech presentation at term twice that of women with previous vaginal deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;Vendittelli, F., Rivière, O., Crenn-Hébert, C., Rozan, M. A., Maria, B., Jacquetin, B. (May 2008) "Is a breech presentation at term more frequent in women with a history of cesarean delivery?" ''American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology'' 198 (5): 521.e1–6. doi:10.1016/j.ajog.2007.11.009. {{PMID|18241817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest possible probability of breech presentation of 50% indicates that breech presentation is a consequence of random filling of the intrauterine space, with the same probability of breech and cephalic presentation in a longitudinally elongated uterus.&lt;ref&gt;Sekulić SR, Petrović DS, Runić R, Williams M, Vejnović TR. Does a probability of breech presentation of more than 50% exist among diseases and medical conditions? Twin Res Hum Genet. 2007; 10:649-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Types of breech depend on how the baby’s legs are lying.

* A frank breech (otherwise known as an extended breech) is where the baby’s legs are up next to its abdomen, with its knees straight and its feet next to its ears. This is the most common type of breech.
* A complete breech (flexed) breech is when the baby appears as though it is sitting crossed-legged with its legs bent at the hips and knees.
* A footling breech is when one or both of the baby’s feet are born first instead of the pelvis. This is more common in babies born prematurely or before their due date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tidy|first1=C|title=Breech Presentations (last revised 11/03/2013)|url=http://patient.info/doctor/breech-presentations|access-date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above, breech births in which the [[sacrum]] is the fetal denominator can be classified by the position of a fetus.&lt;ref name=Konar2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Konar |first=Hiralal |title=Dc dutta's textbook of obstetrics |date=2014 |publisher=Mcgraw-Hill |location=[S.l.] |isbn=978-93-5152-067-2 |page=376 |edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus sacro-anterior, sacro-transverse and sacro-posterior positions all exist, but left sacro-anterior is the most common presentation.&lt;ref name=Konar2014/&gt; Sacro-anterior indicates an easier delivery compared to other forms.

== Complications ==
Umbilical [[cord prolapse]] may occur, particularly in the complete, footling, or kneeling breech.&lt;ref name="PatientInfoProlapsedCord"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Payne |first1=J. |title=Prolapsed Cord. Pregnancy complications from prolapsed cord. |url=http://patient.info/doctor/prolapsed-cord |website=Patient info |accessdate=22 April 2016 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is caused by the lowermost parts of the baby's not completely filling the space of the dilated cervix.&lt;ref name="PatientInfoProlapsedCord" /&gt; When the waters break [[amniotic sac|the amniotic sac]], it is possible for the umbilical cord to drop down and become compressed.&lt;ref name="PatientInfoProlapsedCord" /&gt; This complication severely diminishes [[oxygen]] flow to the baby, so the baby must be delivered immediately (usually by [[Caesarean section]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Umbilical Cord Prolapse |url=https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg-50-umbilicalcordprolapse-2014.pdf |publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |accessdate=22 April 2016 |date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) so that he or she can breathe. If there is a delay in delivery, the brain can be damaged. Among full-term, head-down babies, cord prolapse is quite rare, occurring in 0.4 percent. Among frank breech babies the incidence is 0.5 percent,&lt;ref name="PatientInfoProlapsedCord" /&gt; among complete breeches 5 percent,&lt;ref name="PatientInfoProlapsedCord" /&gt; and among footling breeches 15 percent.&lt;ref name="PatientInfoProlapsedCord" /&gt;

Head entrapment is caused by the failure of the fetal head to negotiate the maternal midpelvis.  At full term, the fetal bitrochanteric diameter (the distance between the outer points of the hips) is about the same as the biparietal diameter (the transverse diameter of the skull)—simply put the size of the hips are the same as the size of the head. The relatively larger buttocks dilate the cervix as effectively as the head does in the typical head-down presentation. In contrast, the relative head size of a [[preterm baby]] is greater than the fetal buttocks. If the baby is preterm, it may be possible for the baby’s body to emerge while the cervix has not dilated enough for the head to emerge.

Because the umbilical cord—the baby’s oxygen supply—is significantly compressed while the head is in the pelvis during a breech birth, it is important that the delivery of the aftercoming fetal head not be delayed.  If the arm is extended alongside the head, delivery will not occur. If this occurs, the ''[[Løvset's manoeuvre|Løvset manoeuvre]]'' may be employed, or the arm may be manually brought to a position in front of the chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tidy|first1=C|title=Breech Presentations |url=http://patient.info/doctor/breech-presentations|website=Patient|access-date=22 April 2016|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Løvset manoeuvre involves rotating the fetal body by holding the fetal pelvis.  Twisting the body such that an arm trails behind the shoulder, it will tend to cross down over the face to a position where it can be reached by the obstetrician's finger, and brought to a position below the head. A similar rotation in the opposite direction is made to deliver the other arm. In order to present the smallest diameter (9.5&amp;nbsp;cm) to the pelvis, the baby’s head must be flexed (chin to chest). If the head is in a deflexed position, the risk of entrapment is increased.  Uterine contractions and maternal muscle tone encourage the head to flex.

[[Oxygen deprivation]] may occur from either cord prolapse or prolonged compression of the [[umbilical cord|cord]] during birth, as in [[head entrapment]]. If [[oxygen deprivation]] is prolonged, it may cause permanent [[neurological]] damage (for instance, [[cerebral palsy]]) or [[death]]. It has been suggested that a fast vaginal delivery would mean the risk of stopping baby’s oxygen supply is reduced.  However, there is not enough research to show this and a quick delivery might cause more harm to the baby than a conservative approach to the birth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofmeyr|first1=GJ|last2=Kulier|first2=R|last3=West|first3=HM|title=Expedited versus conservative approaches for vaginal delivery in breech presentation.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=21 July 2015|volume=7|pages=CD000082|pmid=26197303|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000082.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Injury]] to the [[Human brain|brain]] and [[Human skull|skull]] may occur due to the rapid passage of the baby's head through the mother's [[pelvis]]. This causes rapid decompression of the baby's head. In contrast, a baby going through labor in the head-down position usually experiences gradual molding (temporary reshaping of the skull) over the course of a few hours. This sudden compression and decompression in breech birth may cause no problems at all, but it can injure the brain. This injury is more likely in [[preterm]] babies. The fetal head may be controlled by a special two-handed grip call the Mariceau-Smellie-Veit manoeuvre or the elective application of forceps. This will be of value in controlling the rate of delivery of the head and reduce decompression. Related to potential head trauma, researchers have identified a relationship between breech birth and [[autism]].&lt;ref name="Ref_c"&gt;Deborah Bilder, MD, Judith Pinborough-Zimmerman, PhD, Judith Miller, PhD and William McMahon, MD. "Prenatal, Perinatal, and Neonatal Factors Associated With Autism Spectrum Disorders." ''Pediatrics'' 123(5), May 2009, pp. 1293–1300&lt;/ref&gt;

Squeezing the baby’s abdomen can damage internal organs. Positioning the baby incorrectly while using forceps to deliver the after coming head can damage the spine or spinal cord.  It is important for the birth attendant to be knowledgeable, skilled, and experienced with all variations of breech birth.

===Factors influencing the safety===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

* Birth attendant's skill (and experience with breech birth) – The skill of the doctor or midwife and the number of breech births previously assisted is of crucial importance. Many of the dangers in vaginal birth for breech babies come from mistakes made by birth attendants. With the majority of breech babies being delivered by cesarean section there is more risk that birth attendants will lose their skills in delivering breech babies and therefore increase the risk of harm to the baby during a vaginal delivery.&lt;ref name="Hof2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kotaska|first1=A|last2=Menticoglou|first2=S|last3=Gagnon|first3=R|last4=Farine|first4=D|last5=Basso|first5=M|last6=Bos|first6=H|last7=Delisle|first7=MF|last8=Grabowska|first8=K|last9=Hudon|first9=L|last10=Mundle|first10=W|last11=Murphy-Kaulbeck|first11=L|last12=Ouellet|first12=A|last13=Pressey|first13=T|last14=Roggensack|first14=A|last15=Maternal Fetal Medicine|first15=Committee|last16=Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of|first16=Canada|title=Vaginal delivery of breech presentation.|journal=Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada|date=June 2009|volume=31|issue=6|pages=557–66, 567–78|pmid=19646324}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Type of breech presentation – the frank breech has the most favorable outcomes in vaginal birth, with many studies suggesting no difference in outcome compared to head down babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twG4F3gjA5YC|title=Anesthetic and Obstetric Management of High-Risk Pregnancy|last=Datta|first=Sanjay|date=2004-01-09|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780387004433|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Some studies, however, find that planned caesarean sections for all breech babies improve outcome. The difference may rest in part on the skill of the doctors who delivered babies in different studies.)  Complete breech presentation is the next most favorable position, but these babies sometimes shift and become footling breeches during labour.  Footling and kneeling breeches have a higher risk of cord prolapse and head entrapment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
* [[Parity (medicine)|Parity]] – Parity refers to the number of times a woman has given birth before.  If a woman has given birth vaginally, her pelvis has "proven" it is big enough to allow a baby of that baby's size to pass through it. However, a head-down baby's head often molds (shifts its shape to fit the maternal pelvis) and so may present a smaller diameter than the same-size baby born breech.  Research on the issue has been contradictory as far as whether vaginal breech birth is safer when the mother has given birth before, or not.
* Fetal size in relation to maternal [[pelvis|pelvic]] size – If the mother's pelvis is roomy and the baby is not large, this is favorable for vaginal breech delivery.  However, prenatal estimates of the size of the baby and the size of the pelvis are unreliable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
* [[Hyperextension]] of the fetal [[head]] – this can be evaluated with ultrasound.  Less than 5% of breech babies have their heads in the "star-gazing" position, face looking straight upwards and the back of the head resting against the back of the neck.  Caesarean delivery is absolutely necessary, because vaginal birth with the baby's head in this position confers a high risk of spinal cord trauma and death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
* [[Fetal development|Maturity]] of the baby – Premature babies appear to be at higher risk of complications if delivered vaginally than if delivered by caesarean section.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
* Progress of labor – A spontaneous, normally progressing, straightforward labor requiring no intervention is a favorable sign.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
* Second [[twins]] – If a first twin is born head down and the second twin is breech, the chances are good that the second twin can have a safe breech birth.&lt;ref&gt;Kotaska A, Menticoglou S,Farine D, et al. "Vaginal delivery of breech presentation" ''J Obstet Gynaecol Can'' 2009 Jun;31(6):557-66, 567-78. (Ref is for entire section)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
[[File:Beckenendlage MRT.jpg|thumb|Breech birth position seen at MRI.]]
As in [[labour (childbirth)|labour]] with a baby in a normal head-down position, uterine contractions typically occur at regular intervals and gradually the [[cervix]] begins to thin and open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |title=First stage |url=https://stratog.rcog.org.uk/tutorial/easi-resource/first-stage-4909 |website=StratOG |accessdate=22 April 2016 |date=2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427204717/https://stratog.rcog.org.uk/tutorial/easi-resource/first-stage-4909# |archive-date=2016-04-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the more common breech presentations, the baby’s bottom (rather than feet or knees) is what is first to descend through the maternal [[pelvis]] and emerge from the vagina.&lt;ref name="PatientInfoProlapsedCord" /&gt;

At the beginning of labour, the baby is generally in an [[wikt:oblique|oblique]] position, facing either the right or left side. The baby's bottom is the same size in the term baby as the baby's head.  Descent is thus as for the presenting fetal head and delay in descent is a cardinal sign of possible problems with the delivery of the head.

In order to begin the birth, descent of podalic pole along with compaction and internal rotation needs to occur.  This happens when the mother's [[pelvic floor]] muscles cause the baby to turn so that it can be born with one hip directly in front of the other.  At this point the baby is facing one of the mother's inner thighs.  Then, the shoulders follow the same path as the hips did.   At this time the baby usually turns to face the mother's back.   Next occurs external rotation, which is when the shoulders emerge as the baby’s head enters the maternal pelvis.  The combination of maternal muscle tone and uterine contractions cause the baby’s head to [[flexion|flex]], chin to chest.   Then the  back of the baby's head emerges and finally the [[face]].

Due to the increased [[pressure]] during labour and birth, it is normal for the baby's leading hip to be bruised and [[genitalia]] to be [[Swelling (medical)|swollen]]. Babies who assumed the frank breech position in utero may continue to hold their legs in this position for some days after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClain|first1=L|title=Will my newborn be different? - Better Birth Blog|url=http://www.betterbirthblog.org/breech/breech-faq/will-my-newborn-be-different/|website=Better Birth Blog|accessdate=18 March 2016|language=en-US|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cesarean or vaginal delivery===
When a baby is born bottom first there is more risk that the birth will not be straight forward and that the baby could be harmed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hutton|first1=EK|last2=Hofmeyr|first2=GJ|last3=Dowswell|first3=T|title=External cephalic version for breech presentation before term.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=29 July 2015|volume=7|pages=CD000084|pmid=26222245|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000084.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when the baby's head passes through the mother’s pelvis the umbilical cord can be compressed which prevents delivery of oxygenated blood to the baby. Due to this and other risks, babies in breech position are usually born by a planned caesarean section in developed countries.&lt;ref name="Hof2015"/&gt;

Caesarean section reduces the risk of harm or death for the baby but does increase risk of harm to the mother compared with a vaginal delivery.&lt;ref name="Hof2015"/&gt; It is best if the baby is in a head down position so that they can be born vaginally with less risk of harm to both mother and baby. The next section is looking at [[External cephalic version]] or ECV which is a method that can help the baby turn from a breech position to a head down position.

Vaginal birth of a breech baby has its risks but caesarean sections are not always available or possible, a mother might arrive in hospital at a late stage of her labour or may choose not to have a caesarean section.  In these cases, it is important that the clinical skills needed to deliver breech babies are not lost so that mothers and babies are as safe as possible.&lt;ref name="Hof2015"/&gt; Compared with developed countries, planned caesarean sections have not produced as good results in developing countries - it is suggested that this is due to more breech vaginal deliveries being performed by experienced, skilled practitioners in these settings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Twin breech ==
[[File:Twin breech.gif|thumb|Twin Breech (vertex and non-vertex twins) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wellspan.org/getImage.ashx?id=161458|title=Twin Breech|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In twin pregnancies, it is very common for one or both babies to be in the breech position. Most often twin babies do not have the chance to turn around because they are born prematurely. If both  babies are in the breech position and the mother has gone into labour early, a cesarean section may be the best option. About 30-40% of twin pregnancies result in only one baby being in the breech position. If this is the case, the babies can be born vaginally.&lt;ref name="Delivery of Breech Second Twin"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/delivery-breech-second-twin|title=Delivery of Breech Second Twin|website=Healthline|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first baby who is not in the breech position is delivered, the baby who is presented in the breech position may turn itself around, if this does not happen another procedure may performed called the breech extraction. The breech extraction is the procedure that involves the obstetrician grabbing the second twin's feet and pulling him/her into the birth canal. This will help with delivering the second twin vaginally.&lt;ref name="Delivery of Breech Second Twin"/&gt; However, if the second twin is larger than the first, complications with delivering the second twin vaginally may arise and a cesarean section should be performed. At times, the first twin (the twin closest to the birth canal) can be in the breech position with the second twin being in the cephalic position (vertical). When this occurs, risks of complications are higher than normal. In particular, a serious complication known as [[Locked twins]]. This is when both babies interlock their chins during labour. When this happens a cesarean section should be performed immediately.

===Turning the baby===
Turning the baby, technically known as [[external cephalic version]] (ECV), is when the baby is turned by gently pressing the mother’s abdomen to push the baby from a bottom first position, to a head first position.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; ECV does not always work, but it does improve the mother’s chances of giving birth to her baby vaginally and avoiding a cesarean section. The World Health Organisation recommends that women should have a planned cesarean section only if an ECV has been tried and did not work.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conde-Agudelo|first1=A|title=Planned caesarean section for term breech delivery: RHL commentary (last revised: 8 September 2003)|url=http://apps.who.int/rhl/pregnancy_childbirth/childbirth/breech/acaguide/en/|website=The WHO Reproductive Health Library|publisher=Geneva: World Health Organization|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who have an ECV when they are 36–40 weeks pregnant are more likely to have a vaginal delivery and less likely to have a cesarean section than those who do not have an ECV.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Turning the baby before this time makes a head first birth more likely but ECV before the due date can increase the risk of early or premature birth which can cause problems to the baby.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

There are treatments that can be used which might affect the success of an ECV. Drugs called beta-stimulant tocolytics help the woman’s muscles to relax so that the pressure during the ECV does not have to be so great. Giving the woman these drugs before the ECV improves the chances of her having a vaginal delivery because the baby is more likely to turn and stay head down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cluver|first1=C|last2=Gyte|first2=GM|last3=Sinclair|first3=M|last4=Dowswell|first4=T|last5=Hofmeyr|first5=GJ|title=Interventions for helping to turn term breech babies to head first presentation when using external cephalic version.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=9 February 2015|volume=2|pages=CD000184|pmid=25674710|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000184.pub4|pmc=4171393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other treatments such as using sound, pain relief drugs such as epidural, increasing the fluid around the baby and increasing the amount of fluids to the woman before the ECV could all effect its success but there is not enough research to make this clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cluver|first1=C|last2=Gyte|first2=GM|last3=Sinclair|first3=M|last4=Dowswell|first4=T|last5=Hofmeyr|first5=GJ|title=Interventions for helping to turn term breech babies to head first presentation when using external cephalic version.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=9 February 2015|volume=2|pages=CD000184|pmid=25674710|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000184.pub4|pmc=4171393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turning techniques mothers can do at home are referred to Spontaneous Cephalic Version (SCV), this is when the baby can turn without any medical assistance.&lt;ref name="babycentre.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babycentre.co.uk/x1053586/how-can-i-turn-my-breech-baby-naturally|title=How can I turn my breech baby naturally?|website=BabyCentre|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these techniques include; a knee to chest position, the breech tilt and moxibustion, these can be performed after the mother is 34 weeks pregnant. Although there is not a lot of evidence to support how well these techniques work, it has worked for some mothers.&lt;ref name="babycentre.co.uk"/&gt;

'''Childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder''' is a psychological disorder that can develop in women who have recently [[Childbirth|given birth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lapp LK, Agbokou C, Peretti CS, Ferreri F |title=Management of post traumatic stress disorder after childbirth: a review |journal=J Psychosom Obstet Gynaecol |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=113–22 |date=September 2010 |pmid=20653342 |doi=10.3109/0167482X.2010.503330 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its symptoms are not distinct from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).&lt;ref name=Condon2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Martin | first = Colin | title = Perinatal Mental Health : a Clinical Guide | publisher = M &amp; K Pub | location = Cumbria England | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781907830495 | page = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Examples of symptoms of  childbirth-related [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] include: [[intrusive thoughts|intrusive symptoms]] such as [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[nightmare]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, as well as symptoms of [[avoidance coping|avoidance]] (including [[amnesia]] for the whole or parts of the event), problems in developing a [[Maternal bond|mother-child attachment]], not having [[sexual intercourse]] in order to prevent another [[pregnancy]], and avoidance of birth and pregnancy related issues.  Symptoms of increasing stress can be [[Perspiration|sweating]], [[Tremor|trembling]], being irritated, and sleep disturbances.&lt;ref name=Olde2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olde E, van der Hart O, Kleber R, van Son M |title=Post-traumatic stress following childbirth: a review |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16176853 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2005.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Birth can be traumatic in different ways. Medical problems can result in interventions that can be frightening. The near death of a mother or baby, heavy bleeding, and emergency operations are examples of situations that can cause psychological trauma. Premature birth may be traumatic.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Goutaudier, N, Lopez, A, Séjourné, N et al. (2011). Premature birth: subjective and psychological experiences in the first weeks following childbirth, a mixed-methods study. Journal of Reproductive and Infant Psychology, 29, 364-373.&lt;/ref&gt;
Emotional difficulties in coping with the pain of childbirth can also cause psychological trauma. Lack of support, or insufficient coping strategies to deal with the pain are examples of situations that can cause psychological trauma. However, even normal birth can be traumatic, and thus PTSD is diagnosed based on symptoms of the mother and not whether or not there were complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Beck CT | title = Birth Trauma: In the Eye of the Beholder | journal = Nursing Research | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–35 | date = January–February 2004 | pmid = 14726774 | doi = 10.1097/00006199-200401000-00005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, in the process of birth, medical professionals who are there to aid the birthing mother may need to examine and perform procedures in the genital regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beck|first=Cheryl Tatano|date=January 2004|title=Birth trauma: in the eye of the beholder|journal=Nursing Research|volume=53|issue=1|pages=28–35|issn=0029-6562|pmid=14726774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Childbirth-related PTSD is not a recognized diagnosis in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''.&lt;ref name=Condon2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Condon J |title=Women's mental health: a "wish-list" for the DSM V |journal=Arch Womens Ment Health |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=5–10 |date=February 2010 |pmid=20127444 |doi=10.1007/s00737-009-0114-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many women presenting with symptoms of PTSD after childbirth are misdiagnosed with [[postpartum depression]] or [[adjustment disorder]]s.  These diagnoses can lead to inadequate treatment.&lt;ref name=Alder2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alder J, Stadlmayr W, Tschudin S, Bitzer J |title=Post-traumatic symptoms after childbirth: what should we offer? |journal=J Psychosom Obstet Gynaecol |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=107–12 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16808085 |doi=10.1080/01674820600714632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18957">A '''cultured neuronal network''' is a [[cell culture]] of neurons that is used as a model to study the [[central nervous system]], especially the [[brain]]. Often, cultured neuronal networks are connected to an input/output device such as a [[multi-electrode array]] (MEA), thus allowing two-way communication between the researcher and the network. This model has proved to be an invaluable tool to scientists studying the underlying principles behind neuronal [[learning]], [[memory]], [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]], [[synapse|connectivity]], and [[information processing]].&lt;ref name="wagenaar"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wagenaar DA, Pine J, Potter SM |year=2006
|title= Searching for Plasticity in Dissociated Cortical Cultures on Multi-Electrode Arrays
|journal=Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine
|volume=
|pages=516&amp;ndash;35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultured neurons are often connected via computer to a real or simulated robotic component, creating a [[hybrot]] or [[animat]], respectively. Researchers can then thoroughly study learning and plasticity in a realistic context, where the neuronal networks are able to interact with their environment and receive at least some artificial sensory feedback. One example of this can be seen in the [[hybrot|Multielectrode Array Art]] (MEART) system developed by the Potter Research Group at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in collaboration with [[Symbiotica|SymbioticA]], The Centre for Excellence in Biological Art, at the [[University of Western Australia]].&lt;ref name="bakkum"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bakkum DJ, Gamblen PM, Ben-Ary B, Chao ZC, Potter SM |year=2007

==Use as a model==

===Advantages===
The use of cultured neuronal networks as a model for their ''in vivo'' counterparts has been an indispensable resource for decades.&lt;ref name="longterm"&gt;{{cite journal
|doi=10.1016/S0165-0270(01)00412-5
|vauthors=Potter SM, DeMarse TB |year=2001
|title=A New Approach to Neural Cell Culture for Long-Term Studies
|journal=Journal of Neuroscience Methods
|volume=110
|issue=1-2
|pages=17&amp;ndash;24
|pmid=11564520}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows researchers to investigate neuronal activity in a much more controlled environment than would be possible in a live organism. Through this mechanism researchers have gleaned important information about the mechanisms behind learning and memory.

A cultured neuronal network allows researchers to observe neuronal activity from several vantage points. [[electrophysiology|Electrophysiological]] recording and stimulation can take place either across the network or locally via an MEA, and the network development can be visually observed using microscopy techniques.&lt;ref name=longterm/&gt; Moreover, chemical analysis of the neurons and their environment is more easily accomplished than in an ''in vivo'' setting.&lt;ref name=longterm/&gt;&lt;ref name="ghezzi"&gt;{{cite journal

|pmid=18761373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
Cultured neuronal networks are by definition disembodied cultures of [[neuron]]s. Thus by being outside their natural environment, the neurons are influenced in ways that are not biologically normal. Foremost among these abnormalities is the fact that the neurons are usually harvested as [[neurogenesis|neural stem cells]] from a fetus and are therefore disrupted at a critical stage in network development.&lt;ref name="interfaces"&gt;{{cite journal
|vauthors=Potter SM, Wagenaar DA, Madhavan R, Demarse TB
|year=2003
|title=Long-Term Bidirectional Neuron Interfaces for Robotic Control, and In Vitro Learning Studies
|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE-EMBS
|doi=10.1109/IEMBS.2003.1280959
|issn=1094-687X
|isbn=0-7803-7789-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the neurons are suspended in solution and subsequently dispensed, the connections previously made are destroyed and new ones formed. Ultimately, the connectivity (and consequently the functionality) of the tissue is changed from what the original template suggested.

Another disadvantage lies in the fact that the cultured neurons lack a body and are thus severed from sensory input as well as the ability to express behavior – a crucial characteristic in learning and memory experiments. It is believed that such sensory deprivation has adverse effects on the development of these cultures and may result in abnormal patterns of behavior throughout the network.&lt;ref name=interfaces/&gt;

Cultured networks on traditional MEAs are flat, single-layer sheets of cells with connectivity only two dimensions. Most ''in vivo'' neuronal systems, to the contrary, are large three-dimensional structures with much greater interconnectivity. This remains one of the most striking differences between the model and the reality, and this fact probably plays a large role in skewing some of the conclusions derived from experiments based on this model.

==Growing a neuronal network==

===Neurons used===
Because of their wide availability, neuronal networks are typically cultured from dissociated rat neurons. Studies commonly employ rat [[cerebellum|cortical]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal]], and [[Spinal nerve|spinal neurons]], although lab mouse neurons have also been used. Currently, relatively little research has been conducted on growing primate or other animal neuronal networks. Harvesting neural stem cells requires sacrificing the developing fetus, a process considered too costly to perform on many mammals that are valuable in other studies.

One study, however, did make use of human neural stem cells grown into a network to control a robotic actuator. These cells were acquired from a fetus that spontaneously aborted after ten weeks in gestation.&lt;ref name="human"&gt;{{cite journal
|vauthors=Pizzi RM, Rossetti D, Cino G, Marino D, Vescovi AL, Baer W |year=2008
|title=A Cultured Human Neural Network Operates a Robotic Actuator
|journal=BioSystems
|doi=10.1016/j.biosystems.2008.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term culture===
One of the most formidable problems associated with cultured neuronal networks is their lack of longevity. Like most cell cultures, neuron cultures are highly susceptible to [[infection]]. They are also susceptible to hyperosmolality from [[growth medium|medium]] evaporation.&lt;ref name=longterm/&gt; The long timelines associated with studying neuronal plasticity (usually on the scale of months) makes extending the lifespan of neurons ''in vitro'' paramount.

One solution to this problem involves growing cells on an MEA inside a sealed chamber. This chamber serves as a non-humidified [[incubator (microbiology)|incubator]] that is enclosed by a [[fluorinated ethylene propylene]] (FEP) membrane that is permeable to select gases (i.e. gases necessary for metabolism) but impermeable to water and microbes.&lt;ref name=longterm/&gt; Other solutions entail an incubator with an impermeable membrane that has a specific mix of gases (air with 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is typical) sealed inside.&lt;ref name=longterm/&gt;

===Multi-electrode arrays (MEAs)===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:MEAinHand.jpg|thumb|An ''in vitro'' MEA |300px|right|An Example of a Multi-Electrode Array]] --&gt;

A [[multi-electrode array]] (MEA), also commonly called a microelectrode array, is a patterned array of electrodes laid out in a transparent substrate used for communication with neurons in contact with it. The communication can be, and usually is, bidirectional; researchers can both record electrophysiological data from a live network and stimulate it with a number of patterns.

This device has been an essential biosensor for more than thirty years. It has been used not only in the study of neuronal plasticity and information processing but also in [[drug]] and [[neurotoxin|toxin]] effects on neurons. Additionally, when coupled with a sealed incubation chamber this device greatly reduces the risk of culture contamination by nearly eliminating the need to expose it to air.&lt;ref name=longterm/&gt;&lt;ref name=ghezzi/&gt;&lt;ref name="caged"&gt;{{cite journal
|vauthors=Erickson J, Tooker A, Tai YC, Pine J |year=2008
|title=Caged Neuron MEA: A System for Long-Term Investigation of Cultured Neural Network Connectivity
|journal=Journal of Neuroscience Methods
|volume=175
|issue=1
|page=1&amp;ndash;16
|pmid=18775453
|pmc=2585802
|doi=10.1016/j.jneumeth.2008.07.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, commonly used MEAs have relatively poor spatial resolution. They employ approximately sixty electrodes for recording and stimulation in varying patterns in a dish with a typical culture of 50,000 cells or more (or a density of 5,000 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=array/&gt; It follows that each electrode in the array services a large cluster of neurons and cannot provide resolute information regarding signal origin and destination; such MEAs are only capable of region-specific data acquisition and stimulation.
 
Ideally it would be possible to record and stimulate from a single or a few neurons at a time. Indeed, companies such as Axion Biosystems are working to provide MEAs with much higher spatial resolution to this end (a maximum of 768 input/output electrodes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://axionbiosystems.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=44&amp;Itemid=50#maestro|title=Axion MEA Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study investigates establishing a stable one-to-one connection between neurons and electrodes. The goal was to meet the ideal interface situation by establishing a correspondence with every neuron in the network. They do so by caging individual neurons while still allowing the [[axons]] and [[dendrites]] to extend and make connections. Neurons are contained within ''neurocages'' or other sorts of containers, and the device itself could be referred to as the caged neuron MEA or [[neurochip]].&lt;ref name=caged/&gt;

Other research suggests alternative techniques to stimulating neurons ''in vitro''. One study investigates the use of a [[laser]] beam to free caged compounds such as [[neurotransmitters]] and [[neuromodulators]].&lt;ref name=ghezzi/&gt; A laser beam with wavelength in the [[Ultraviolet|UV]] spectrum would have extremely high spatial accuracy and, by releasing the caged compounds, could be used to influence a very select set of neurons.

==Network behavior==

===Spontaneous network activity===
Spontaneous network bursts are a commonplace feature of neuronal networks both ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name="bursts"&gt;{{cite conference
|first=S
|last=Potter
|title=How Should We Think About Bursts?
|booktitle=6th Int. Meeting on Substrate-Integrated Microelectrodes
|year=2008
|pages=22&amp;ndash;25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''In vitro'', this activity is particularly important in studies on learning and plasticity. Such experiments look intensely at the network-wide activity both before and after experiments in order to discern any changes that might implicate plasticity or even learning.&lt;ref name="array"&gt;{{cite journal
|doi=10.1109/TBME.2007.913987

|journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering
|volume=55
|issue=4
|pages=1382&amp;ndash;1390
|pmid=18390329}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, confounding this experimental technique is the fact that normal neuronal development induces change in array-wide bursts that could easily skew data. ''In vivo'', however, it has been suggested that these network bursts may form the basis for memories.&lt;ref name=array/&gt;&lt;ref name=bursts/&gt;

Depending on experimental perspective, network-wide bursts can be viewed either positively or negatively. In a pathological sense, spontaneous network activity can be attributed to the disembodiment of the neurons; one study saw a marked difference between array-wide firing frequency in cultures that received continuous input versus those that did not.&lt;ref name="repertoire"&gt;{{cite journal
|vauthors=Wagenaar DA, Pine J, Potter SM |year=2006

|pmc=1420316
|doi=10.1186/1471-2202-7-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; To eliminate aberrant activity, researchers commonly use [[magnesium]] or synaptic blockers to quiet the network. However, this approach has great costs; quieted networks have little capacity for plasticity&lt;ref name=bursts/&gt; due to a diminished ability to create [[action potential]]s. A different and perhaps more effective approach is the use of low frequency stimulation that emulates sensory background activity.&lt;ref name="random"&gt;{{cite journal

|issue=3
|pages=263&amp;ndash;280
|pmid=16077162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a different light, network bursts can be thought of as benign and even good. Any given network demonstrates non-random, structured bursts.&lt;ref name=bursts/&gt; Some studies have suggested that these bursts represent information carriers, expression of memory, a means for the network to form appropriate connections, and learning when their pattern changes.&lt;ref name=array/&gt;&lt;ref name=repertoire/&gt;&lt;ref name=random/&gt;&lt;ref name="neurochip"&gt;{{cite journal

|doi=10.1103/physreve.75.050901 
|volume=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Array-wide burst stability====
Stegenga et al. set out to establish the stability of spontaneous network bursts as a function of time. They saw bursts throughout the lifetime of the cell cultures, beginning at 4–7 days ''in vitro'' (DIV) and continuing until culture death. They gathered network burst profiles (BPs) through a mathematical observation of array-wide spiking rate (AWSR), which is the summation of action potentials over all electrodes in an MEA. This analysis yielded the conclusion that, in their culture of [[Wistar rat]] [[neocortex|neocortical]] cells, the AWSR has long rise and fall times during early development and sharper, more intense profiles after approximately 25 DIV. However, the use of BPs has an inherent shortcoming; BPs are an average of all network activity over time, and therefore only contain temporal information. In order to attain data about the spatial pattern of network activity they developed what they call phase profiles (PPs), which contain electrode specific data.&lt;ref name=array/&gt;

Data was gathered using these PPs on timescales of milliseconds up through days. Their goal was to establish the stability of network burst profiles on the timescale of minutes to hours and to establish stability or developmental changes over the course of days. In summary, they were successful in demonstrating stability over minutes to hours, but the PPs gathered over the course of days displayed significant variability. These finding imply that studies of plasticity of neurons can only be conducted over the course of minutes or hours without bias in network activity introduced by normal development.&lt;ref name=array/&gt;

===Learning vs. plasticity===
There is much controversy in the field of neuroscience surrounding whether or not a cultured neuronal network can learn. A crucial step in finding the answer to this problem lies in establishing the difference between [[learning]] and [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]]. One definition suggests that learning is "the acquisition of novel behavior through experience".&lt;ref name="ai"&gt;{{cite conference
|vauthors=Bakkum DJ, Shkolnik AC, Ben-Ary G, Gamblen P, DeMarse TB, Potter SM |title=Removing Some ‘A’ from AI: Embodied Cultured Networks
|booktitle=Embodied Artificial Intelligence: International Seminar, Dagstuhl Castle, Germany, July 7–11, 2003, Revised Selected Papers
|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corollary to this argument is the necessity for interaction with the environment around it, something that cultured neurons are virtually incapable of without sensory systems. Plasticity, on the other hand, is simply the reshaping of an existing network by changing connections between neurons: formation and elimination of synapses or extension and retraction of [[neurites]] and [[dendritic spines]].&lt;ref name=wagenaar/&gt; But these two definitions are not mutually exclusive; in order for learning to take place, plasticity must also take place.

In order to establish learning in a cultured network, researchers have attempted to re-embody the dissociated neuronal networks in either simulated or real environments (see [[hybrot|MEART]] and [[animat]]). Through this method the networks are able to interact with their environment and, therefore, have the opportunity to learn in a more realistic setting. Other studies have attempted to imprint signal patterns onto the networks via artificial stimulation.&lt;ref name=neurochip/&gt; This can be done by inducing network bursts&lt;ref name=bursts/&gt; or by inputing specific patterns to the neurons, from which the network is expected to derive some meaning (as in experiments with animats, where an arbitrary signal to the network indicates that the simulated animal has run into a wall or is moving in a direction, etc.).&lt;ref name=animat/&gt;&lt;ref name=human/&gt; The latter technique attempts to take advantage of the inherent ability of neuronal networks to make sense of patterns. However, experiments have had limited success in demonstrating a definition of learning that is widely agreed upon. Nevertheless, plasticity in neuronal networks is a phenomenon that is well-established in the neuroscience community, and one that is thought to play a very large role in learning.&lt;ref name=wagenaar/&gt;

'''David Francis Everett''' (1962–2013) was an Australian criminal, writer and former member of the Australian [[Special Air Service Regiment]] and [[Karen National Liberation Army]]. During his [[Manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] he was regarded as the most wanted man in the history of Australian criminals.

==Early life==
David Everett was born in rural Tasmania in 1962 to a middle-class family and joined the Australian Army as an apprentice when he was aged 15.&lt;ref name="theaustralian1"&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/soldier-of-misfortune/story-e6frg8yo-1111116713974&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
===Australian Army===
[[File:Dave Everett in SASR Graduation.png|thumb|left|1983 SASR Graduation Class]]
Everett began his career as a mechanic fixing supply trucks and joined the Special Air Service Regiment at 18 where he spent 3 and 1/2 years.

He claimed the selection course was the hardest thing he'd ever done in his life (including his prison sentence).

However, because the Australian Army was not at war, he left for [[Burma]] and took great interest in the Karen People.&lt;ref name="theaustralian1"/&gt;

===Karen National Liberation Army===
After leaving the Army in 1986, Everett joined the [[Karen National Liberation Army]] (KNLA) in Myanmar (Burma) as a mercenary, arms dealer and gun for hire using the alias "Steve". He used his skills to teach the soldiers how to survive in combat most notably instructing them in marksmanship and the planting of [[Claymore mine|claymore anti-personnel mines]]. He told a correspondent "If I get sick of it I'll go and do a nine to five job".&lt;ref name="Interview with ACA" group=Videos&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ex-SASR, Insurgency|first1=David Everett|title=David Everett, Ex-SASR, Insurgency in Burma|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/17172626/cancer-kills-notorious-sas-man/|website=YouTube|publisher=A Current Affair|accessdate=8 June 2014|ref=V1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714214943/https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/17172626/cancer-kills-notorious-sas-man/|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in Burma in 1986 he went as far as meeting with General [[Bo Mya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dangerousdaveeverett.com/photos.html |title=Photos |publisher=Dangerous Dave Everett |date= |accessdate=2014-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the Australian TV series ''A Current Affair'' words failed him when he tried to describe the atrocities committed against the Karen minority, but these atrocities inspired his cause.&lt;ref name="Interview with ACA" group=Videos /&gt;

{{quotation|''"A two-year-old kid was... Just left him for dead, you know? It's terrible stuff... That's when I said this can't go on; people shouldn't do this to each other."'' – Everett.&lt;ref name="Interview with ACA" group=Videos /&gt;}}

==Return to Australia==
In 1987 he returned to Australia and married.

Within the four years leading up to his crimes, Everett worked as a security guard, private investigator and owner-driver in a trucking business. In 1990 his wife, Amanda, gave birth to his first son Nicholas who was named after a Karen soldier he had fought with.

By most accounts Everett was a devoted father and a hard-working husband. But during those years he also spoke fervently of his wish to move to the US and work for the FBI or the CIA.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fugitives.com.au/fugitives-articles/1992/1/19/australias-mostwanted-army-hero/ |title=Australia's Most-wanted Army Hero |publisher=Fugitives.com.au |date=1992-01-19 |accessdate=2014-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminality==
[[File:Dave Everett in 1991.png|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Everett, 1991, at some stage during his pilot training.]]
Realizing the funding of the Karen rebellion was too meagre, Everett took up pilot lessons so he could smuggle weapons back to Burma. To do this he needed money and turned to armed robbery involving former SASR comrade James Reynolds and another unknown accomplice who too was suspected by police to be ex-SASR.

In 1991 in [[Perth]], Western Australia, all three - in a stunt that lasted several hours - raided the home of a theatre manager and his pregnant wife of 6 months taking the couple at gun-point in order to open the safe to gain access to the funds. They stole the money but were later caught. Everett, however, was released on bail whilst Reynolds committed suicide in prison, the third accomplice escaped capture and remained unidentified.

Afterwards he traveled first to  Cairns, and later to Magnetic Island off the North Queensland coast where he taught rappelling as part of a tour operation. Everett then fled when a chance police drug-raid took place.

He then returned to Western Australia and perpetrated two more robberies on two separate IGA shopping centres by surveying the owners, tracking them home and holding them hostage in two attempts to break into their safes, both of which were empty.

Finally he went down to an explosives storage magazine in [[Baldivis, Western Australia|Baldivis]], south of Perth, in order to get munitions for a gold robbery to pay for his mother's house that had been confiscated by the courts. In the process he set off one tonne of explosives in what is still the largest explosion in Australian criminal history having been audible from many miles away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penguin.com.au/products/9780143010654/shadow-warrior-sas-australia-s-most-wanted |title=Shadow Warrior: From the SAS to Australia's Most Wanted &amp;#124; Penguin Books Australia |publisher=Penguin.com.au |date=2014-06-27 |accessdate=2014-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison sentence===
Everett was caught in 1991 after being exposed to the police by an associate. While awaiting trial he faked his own abduction with a .22 automatic rifle he had buried in his backyard years earlier. He was recaptured 12 months later after a large police manhunt.&lt;ref name="theaustralian1"/&gt;

===Release===
Whilst in prison, Everett wrote his book and set his story straight in "Shadow Warrior". He used his time to complete a Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in international relations and journalism and in 1999 he graduated with Honours in Strategic Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dangerousdaveeverett.com/aboutdavid.html |title=About David |publisher=Dangerous Dave Everett |date= |accessdate=2014-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
Everett was released in 2002 following 10 and 1/2 years in prison. He apparently maintained good relationships with his kids and married Australian Commonwealth government lawyer Darryl Wookey. He was diagnosed with [[Worster-Drought syndrome|suprabulbar palsy]], the disease that killed his Father. He died aged 51 on 13 May 2013 after a year long battle with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defencenetwork.com/cancer-kills-notorious-sas-man |title=Cancer kills notorious SAS man |publisher=Defence Network |date=2013-05-16 |accessdate=2014-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gary Adshead The West Australian May 16, 2013, 7:17 am |url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/17172626/cancer-kills-notorious-sas-man/ |title=Cancer kills notorious SAS man - Yahoo!7 |publisher=Au.news.yahoo.com |date=2013-05-16 |accessdate=2014-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714214943/https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/17172626/cancer-kills-notorious-sas-man/ |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Conner Treen Sr.''' (July 16, 1928 – October 29, 2009), was an American [[attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] and politician from [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville, St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana]]. In 1979 he was elected as the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[List of Governors of Louisiana|Governor]] of the U.S. state of [[Louisiana]] since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. It was a sign of changing party affiliations among white conservatives in the state, who have comprised a majority of the population since at least 1900. In 1972 Treen was the first Republican elected in modern times from this state to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].

The long absence of Republicans from state positions, from the turn of the century through much of the 1960s, was due to the party having been hollowed out by the Democrats passing a new constitution in 1898 that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most African Americans]] in the state, who made up 47% of the population in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |title=Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia |accessdate=March 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |archivedate=August 23, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; But by 1900, two years after the new constitution, only 5,320 black voters were registered in the state, despite their advances in education and literacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, "Democracy, Anti-Democracy and the Canon", ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, p.12], accessed March 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; They had constituted the majority of Republican Party members in the 19th century after gaining the franchise as freedmen and citizens in the post-Civil War years.

Treen served as governor from 1980–84. He lost his bid in 1983 for reelection to his popular long-time rival, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Edwin Edwards]], who was returning after two previous terms. Treen had earlier been elected to Congress in 1972, serving from 1973-80. Treen grew up as a Democrat, but joined the Republican Party in 1962. At the time, there were about 10,000 registered Republicans in the state; African Americans, who had previously made up most of the party members, were still mostly disenfranchised. By the time of Treen's death in 2009, only a few other living Louisiana Republicans had exceeded his length of tenure in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

==Early years and family==
Treen was born in the state capital of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], to Elizabeth Treen (née Speir; 1899–1990) and Joseph Paul Treen, Sr. (1900–1986).&lt;ref name=ssdi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi|title=Social Security Death Index|publisher=ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=November 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had two brothers, Joseph Paul Treen, Jr. and [[John S. Treen|John Speir Treen]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/theadvocate/obituary.aspx?n=gov-david-conner-treen&amp;pid=135263008|title=Gov. David Conner Treen|publisher=''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]''|accessdate=November 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Treen graduated from the former [[Alcee Fortier High School]], [[State school|public school]] in New Orleans, where his classmates included the subsequent [[political consultant]] and [[journalist]] [[Victor Gold (journalist)|Victor Gold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/448398/victor-gold-rip|title=Victor Gold RIP|author=[[Quin Hillyer]]|date=June 7, 2017|accessdate=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1948 in history and [[political science]] from [[Tulane University]] in New Orleans. While at Tulane, he was a brother of [[Kappa Sigma]] [[College fraternity|fraternity]]. In 1950, he graduated from [[Tulane Law School]] and was admitted to the bar. In 1951, Treen married Dolores "Dodi" Brisbi (November 23, 1929 &amp;ndash; March 19, 2005),&lt;ref name=ssdi/&gt; a graduate of [[Newcomb College]] in New Orleans. They met during college.

Treen served in the [[U.S. Air Force]] from 1951 to 1952. After his discharge, Treen joined the law firm of Deutsch, Kerrigan &amp; Stiles. He also served as a vice president of the Simplex [[Manufacturing]] Corporation of New Orleans from 1952–57.

The Treens had three children, Jennifer (born ca. 1952), David C., Jr. and Cynthia (born April 2, 1954). (Their children married, and the Treens had a total of nine grandchildren.  Treen's eldest grandson, Jason Stewart Neville (born May 21, 1979), was one of the founding members of the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] of Louisiana; he ran unsuccessfully in 2003 for the Louisiana State Senate.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==States' Rights Party elector candidate, 1960==
In the post-World War II era, African-American veterans and other leaders pushed to regain recognition of their constitutional rights as citizens, especially in the South, where they were disenfranchised, excluded from politics, and treated as second-class citizens. The civil rights movement gained increasing force through the 1960s. In 1954 the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. By 1960 African Americans made up a declining proportion of the state's population, as many thousands had left in the Great Migration. They constituted 32% of the population.

In 1960, Treen opposed the election of both Republican [[Richard Nixon]] and Democrat [[John F. Kennedy]] as president. He ran as an [[US Presidential Electors|elector]] for the Louisiana [[Dixiecrat|States' Rights Party]] (known as the Dixiecrats), which supported [[Virginia]] Democratic [[U.S. Senator]] [[Harry F. Byrd, Sr.]] In addition to Treen, States' Rights electors from Louisiana included former State Senator [[William M. Rainach]] of [[Claiborne Parish]] (a defeated 1959 gubernatorial candidate) and [[Plaquemines Parish]] Judge [[Leander Perez]]. The Roman Catholic Church [[excommunicate]]d Perez because of his outspoken opposition to racial integration. Another elector was the "Radical Right" figure [[Kent Courtney]] of New Orleans and later [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]]. Former Congressman [[Jared Y. Sanders, Jr.]] of Baton Rouge, son of former Governor [[Jared Y. Sanders, Sr.]], was also a States Rights elector.&lt;ref&gt;''Minden Press'', [[Minden, Louisiana]], November 7, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

Treen emphasized that his states' rights group was not affiliated with the [[National States' Rights Party]], a group considered neo-Nazi, and which he said was "a disgrace to the term 'states rights.'" Treen's elector slate polled 169,572 ballots (21%) statewide. [[Jefferson Parish]], Treen's residence, which would later support him in most of his campaigns, rejected the States' Righters. It supported the Democratic national candidate Kennedy with 51.8%. Nixon and [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] electors received 230,980 (28.6%) in Louisiana. Kennedy-Johnson won the state's ten [[electoral votes]] with 407,339 (50.4%).&lt;ref&gt;State of Louisiana, Secretary of State, General election returns for November 8, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Kennedy electors was popular State Attorney General [[Jack P.F. Gremillion]]. Another was [[Edmund Reggie]] of [[Crowley, Louisiana]], a confidant of future Governor Edwin Edwards and future father-in-law of Senator [[Edward M. Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;''Minden Press'', November 7, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republican for Congress, 1962, 1964, and 1968==

In 1962 Treen joined the Republican Party (GOP), which was still small in Louisiana after having suffered a dramatic decline with the exclusion of African Americans from politics since the late 19th century. He ran in 1962 for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]], based in [[New Orleans]], against incumbent Democrat [[Hale Boggs]] (1914–1972) of New Orleans. Treen's father had urged him to challenge Boggs for renomination in the Democratic primary. As a young Democrat in 1956, Treen had supported then Republican congressional nominee [[George R. Blue]] against Boggs that year. Blue later switched to the Democrats and won election to the Louisiana House of Representatives in 1964. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Treen raised $11,000 for his 1962 campaign and polled 27,791 votes (32.8 percent) to Boggs' 57,395 (67.2 percent). {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In 1964, Treen again challenged Boggs. He improved on his earlier showing, helped by the popularity in Louisiana of the presidential candidacy of U.S. Senator [[Barry M. Goldwater]]. In addition many of his constituents were unhappy that Boggs had voted for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which most Southern Democratic Congressmen had voted against. In the 1964 campaign, Treen polled 62,881 (45 percent) to Boggs' 77,009 (55%). In 1966, Treen did not run for Congress; the GOP fielded the attorney [[Leonard L. Limes]] of New Orleans, who was badly defeated by Boggs, in the year that the [[Voting Rights Act]] was passed by Congress, enabling some African Americans to register across the South. Treen ran again in 1968 in his third and final campaign against Boggs, who was then the House [[majority whip]]. Boggs became majority leader in 1971 and was in line for Speaker. California Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] came into the district to campaign for Treen. This time, Treen almost defeated Boggs, receiving 77,633 votes (48.8%) to Boggs' 81,537 ballots (51.2%).{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Treen attributed Boggs' victory in 1968 to the supporters of former [[Alabama]] Governor [[George C. Wallace]], who ran for president on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket. Treen claimed that Wallace supporters "became very cool to my candidacy. We couldn't really believe they would support Boggs, but several Democratic organizations did come out for Wallace and Boggs, and he received just enough Wallace votes to give him the election".{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Treen did not contest the election.

==First gubernatorial campaign, 1971–1972==
{{Main|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1971–72}}

===Primary opposition from Robert M. Ross===
Treen was challenged in 1971 in the only Republican gubernatorial [[closed primary]] ever held in Louisiana. the state follows a practice of open primaries. His opponent was [[Robert Max Ross]] (August 5, 1933 – September 15, 2009), a native of [[Baskin, Louisiana|Baskin]] in [[Franklin Parish, Louisiana|Franklin Parish]], who grew up in [[Mangham, Louisiana|Mangham]] in [[Richland Parish]] in north Louisiana. Ross had a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in agriculture from [[Louisiana State University]] in Baton Rouge. Ross was a businessman in Mangham, including a [[mobile home]] park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/dclassifieds?Dato=20090917&amp;Kategori=OBITUARY&amp;Class=30&amp;Type=CAT30200&amp;Lopenr=90900159&amp;Selected=3|title=Obituary of Robert Max Ross|work=[[Monroe News Star]]|accessdate=September 17, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301002401/http://www.thenewsstar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/dclassifieds?Dato=20090917&amp;Kategori=OBITUARY&amp;Class=30&amp;Type=CAT30200&amp;Lopenr=90900159&amp;Selected=3|archivedate=March 1, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1971 primary, Treen gained the support of the party leadership, including chairman [[Charles deGravelles]] of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]]. In a campaign tour in [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]], in which he visited with Republican [[Mayor]] [[Tom Colten]], Treen said that Louisiana needed "true competition" in state government, or "a system in which two political parties operate on a continuing and permanent basis to examine and criticize each other's policies and programs." If elected, Treen said that he would be "as independent as possible" in the governorship.&lt;ref&gt;"Treen Says Louisiana Needs Two-Party System to Develop Leaders,'' ''[[Minden Press-Herald]],'' September 3, 1971, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Treen received 9,732 votes (92 percent) to Ross's 839 (8 percent). Ross challenged Treen again for governor in 1983 and ran far behind in races for the United States Senate in 1984 and 1986.  {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===1972 general election against Edwin Edwards===
For the general election against Edwards held on February 1, 1972, Treen campaigned vigorously with billboards which said, "Make a Real Change", and television spots, but he lost. His chances seemed to improve when the [[American Party (1969)|American Party]] nominee, [[Hall Lyons]] of Lafayette, a son of GOP pioneer [[Charlton Lyons]] of Shreveport, withdrew after Edwards predicted victory based on the premise that Lyons and Treen would split the more conservative vote. Lyons said that his decision to leave the race was intended to allow conservatives to unite behind Treen.&lt;ref&gt;"Lyons Says Conservatives Should Unite With Treen", ''Minden Press-Herald'', January 4, 1972, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Treen also shared the Republican ticket with other candidates. [[Morley A. Hudson]] and [[Tom Stagg]], both of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], ran for lieutenant governor and [[attorney general]], respectively, against [[Jimmy Fitzmorris]] and [[William J. Guste]]. Edwards scoffed at his challenger: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;If Treen had been a registered Democrat in the November 6 Democratic primary, he'd have gotten lost in the shuffle. Yet, while his only claim of any kind of legitimacy is that he's a Republican, he deliberately avoids use of the word 'Republican' on any of his campaign paraphernalia. He's apparently ashamed of the fact that he's a Republican.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Layton, "State Voters Decide Today Whether They Want Change", ''Minden Press-Herald'', February 1, 1972, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Treen polled 480,424 ballots (42.8%) to Edwards's 641,146 (57.2%) Treen carried twenty-seven parishes, mostly in the northern part of the state, with margins exceeding 60 percent in ten of those parishes. His tally was some 5 percentage points higher than what [[Charlton Lyons]] had scored in 1964 against [[John McKeithen]].

Edwards proclaimed that his administration would be an "Era of Excellence". ''[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]'' and its sister publication, the former ''Monroe Morning World'' (now ''[[The News-Star|Monroe News-Star]]''), analyzed the gubernatorial returns and concluded that Edwards received 202,055 black votes to only 10,709 for Treen. As Edwards' statewide margin was 160,000, the survey concluded that African Americans made the difference. They had only been able to vote in number since passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. The newspapers said that Treen received some 30,000 more votes from whites than did Edwards. Another source said that Treen, who was named Republican national committeeman after his gubernatorial race, received the backing of 55 percent of white voters but 2 percent among African Americans.&lt;ref name=cmte&gt;"Treen Named State GOP Committeeman", ''Minden Press-Herald'', March 6, 1972, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; While African Americans in the 19th and early 20th century had been part of the Republican Party, following the civil rights era, they joined the Democratic Party, which had supported their struggle to regain their constitutional rights.

Numerous Republican legislative candidates ran on the Treen ticket, but most of those outside Shreveport, Baton Rouge, and Jefferson Parish were defeated. Treen loyalist [[Bob Reese]], for instance, failed in a state senate race from [[Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana|Natchitoches Parish]] against the Democrat [[Paul L. Foshee]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Election to Congress, 1972==
After a decade of service on the Republican State Central Committee, Treen was named as the Louisiana Republican national committeeman for a two-year stint that began in 1972. He succeeded his former ticket mate, Tom Stagg, who later was appointed as a U.S. District judge in Shreveport.&lt;ref name=cmte/&gt;

Treen's friend [[James Boyce (Louisiana politician)|James H. Boyce]], a Baton Rouge [[business]]man, served as state party chairman while Treen was national committeeman. Over the years, Treen benefited from other party officials who worked on his behalf, such as National Committeeman [[Frank Spooner]] of [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], who lost the 1976 race in [[Louisiana's 5th congressional district]] to Democrat [[Jerry Huckaby]],&lt;ref&gt;Billy Hathorn, "Otto Passman, Jerry Huckaby, and Frank Spooner: The Louisiana Fifth Congressional District Election of 1976", ''Louisiana History:  The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association'', LIV No. 3 (Summer 2013), p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; and National Committeewoman [[Virginia Martinez (Louisiana politician)|Virginia Martinez]] of New Orleans, the treasurer of the national party conventions in 1980 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/la/orleans/obits/1/m-07.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, based in part on the strength of his gubernatorial race, Treen ran for the open [[Louisiana's 3rd congressional district]] seat vacated by conservative Democrat [[Patrick T. Caffery]] of [[New Iberia]]. He was a surprise winner, helped in part by the popularity of the Republican Nixon-[[Spiro Agnew|Agnew]] ticket, which carried sixty-three of the sixty-four parishes (the exception, [[West Feliciana Parish]]) in what had traditionally been Democratic Louisiana. Treen defeated Democrat [[J. Louis Watkins, Jr.]], of [[Houma, Louisiana|Houma]], 71,090 (54 percent) to 60,521 (46 percent). Treen's home parish of Jefferson helped to push him over the top, supporting him with 73 percent share of the vote. Treen was elected as the first Republican to represent Louisiana in Congress since [[Hamilton D. Coleman]] left office from the Second District in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=C000619|title=Coleman, Hamilton Dudley|publisher=bioguide.congress.gov|accessdate=August 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treen served in the congressional seat from 1973 until 1980, being re-elected twice. He resigned when he was elected as governor. As a congressman, he voted right-of-center and usually in accord with his party. He was considered a team player among House Republicans. In 1974, Treen won a comfortable reelection in a year when Democrats won the presidency. He defeated State Representative [[Charles Grisbaum, Jr.]], of Jefferson Parish, who became a close friend. Grisbaum later switched parties. After Treen became governor in 1980, Grisbaum served as one of Treen's floor leaders in the Louisiana House.

In 1975, Treen was joined by his first Louisiana Republican colleague in the U.S. House when [[Henson Moore]] won [[Louisiana's 6th congressional district]] seat based in and about Baton Rouge and the [[Florida Parishes]]. Moore won the seat formerly held by the Democrat [[John Rarick]]. In 1976, Treen polled 73.3 percent in a race against a nominal Democratic opponent, in a year when [[Jimmy Carter]], Democrat from Georgia, carried Louisiana over [[Gerald R.

==Election as governor, 1979==
In 1979, Treen hired [[Gus Weill]] for his campaign for the governorship; Weill was a Democrat who in 1958 had established the first political [[public relations]] firm in Baton Rouge and who served as John McKeithen's former campaign manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpb.org/programs/legends/weill.html|title=About Gus Weill|publisher=lpb.org|accessdate=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigning for Treen was [[U.S. Senator]] [[John Tower]] of [[Texas]]; at the Shreveport Convention Center he said, "We are not here as Republicans. We are not here as Democrats. We are here as citizens who have aspirations for our country."&lt;ref name=sjournal/&gt; Tower said that his backing for Treen was based on the candidate's "character, enormous ability, his sense of what is right, and his complete dedication to the sovereign state."&lt;ref name=sjournal&gt;''[[Shreveport Journal]]'', August 24, 1979, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Treen reached out to African Americans, but most voted for Democratic candidates. Alexandria attorney P. Spencer Torry (born 1930), an African-American female Republican, described Treen as "an honest man who keeps his word. He's promised to improve education, job training, and provide more opportunities for the minorities. I've talked to Dave Treen, and I believe him."&lt;ref&gt;''Louisiana Ledger-News'', October 22, 1979, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Treen ran in the [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] (jungle primary) for governor, the second such election held in Louisiana. He finished with 297,469 votes, nearly the same results as posted by Charlton Lyons in the 1964 general election, 284 fewer votes than Lyons had in a two-candidate field. The second spot was hotly contested between [[Louisiana Public Service Commission]]er [[Louis Lambert]] of [[Ascension Parish, Louisiana|Ascension parish]] (282,708 votes) and outgoing Lieutenant Governor [[Jimmy Fitzmorris]], of New Orleans (280,412 votes). Fitzmorris unsuccessfully sued in an attempt to force Lambert from the number-two position so Fitzmorris could face Treen in the general election.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In the Treen-Lambert general election, the defeated Democratic candidates, including the disappointed Fitzmorris, House Speaker [[E. L. Henry]] of [[Jonesboro, Louisiana|Jonesboro]], Secretary of State [[Paul Hardy]] of [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]] and State Senator [[Edgar G. "Sonny" Mouton, Jr.]], of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], all endorsed Treen. Their support helped him to defeat Lambert by 9,557 votes. Treen received 690,691 (50.3%) to Lambert's 681,134 (49.7%). He won 22 parishes in victory, compared to 27 parishes in defeat in 1972. Only ten parishes that had voted for Treen in 1972 stuck with him in 1979. His strongest parishes in victory were all in south Louisiana: Plaquemines, Lafayette, St. Tammany, and Iberia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louisiana Secretary of State]], General election returns, February 1, 1972; December 8, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the losing 1972 campaign, Treen had gained most of his support from north Louisiana. The election of 1979 seemed to indicate that Lafayette would in time replace [[Shreveport]] as the new growth center of the Louisiana GOP. Treen's victory came from Republican inroads made in the Edwards stronghold of [[Acadiana]], particularly Lafayette, [[Iberia Parish|Iberia]], [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebonne]], [[Acadia Parish|Acadia]], and [[St. Martin Parish|St. Martin]] parishes. The GOP nominee overcame large deficits from 1972 to win in 1979. Treen received 3.1% of the black vote, nearly identical to his black support in 1972. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

On March 10, 1980, Treen, aged 51, became the 51st governor of his state. His oath of office was administered by 19th Judicial Court Judge [[Douglas Gonzales]], a Republican from Baton Rouge. Gonzales gave Treen a Bible inscribed, "Dave, Upon this good book, you took your oath of office. Please keep it close so it can serve as a constant reminder of your solemn commitment to the people of this great state ..."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]'', March 11, 1980, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Treen named the Alexandria businessman and philanthropist [[Roy O. Martin, Jr.]], to the Louisiana Board of Commerce and Industry. He named [[John Henry Baker]] to the Louisiana Athletic Commission, since renamed the Louisiana State Boxing and Wrestling Commission. Martin and Baker were both delegates to the 1980 Republican National Convention in Detroit, Michigan. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} He named the [[Louisiana Tech University]] English professor [[Robert C. Snyder]] to the Louisiana State Ethics Commission, a position that Snyder held for twenty-six years, including a stint as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/shreveporttimes/obituary.aspx?n=robert-c-snyder&amp;pid=151785180|title=Robert C. Snyder Obituary|work=''The Shreveport Times|date=June 12, 2011|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1980 special election for the House seat vacated by Treen, Democrat [[Louisiana House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Billy Tauzin]] of [[Thibodaux, Louisiana|Thibodaux]] defeated fellow Democrat, [[Louisiana State Senate|State Senator]] [[Anthony Guarisco, Jr.]], of [[Morgan City, Louisiana|Morgan City]], and the Democrat-turned-Republican [[Jim Donelon]] of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]], who had just lost a Democratic race for lieutenant governor.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Secretary of State, Special U.S. House election returns, April 17, 1980; Special congressional runoff election returns, May 17, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Treen reappointed Shreveport attorney [[Robert G. Pugh]] to the [[Louisiana Board of Regents]] created by the Constitution of 1974. Pugh advised Treen on numerous issues. He developed a plan to preserve coastal [[wetlands]] through a tax on energy, but the legislature failed to approve it. Treen appointed [[Robert DeBlieux]], the outgoing Democratic mayor of Natchitoches, as the state's chief preservation officer. DeBleiux had been instrumental in obtaining designation of the [[Natchitoches Historic District]] in the middle 1970s. When Treen assumed office, some 10 of the 105 members of the [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana House of Representatives]] were Republican; all 39 state senators were Democrats.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Accomplishments as governor==
The Treen administration is known for the establishment of the [[Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts]], a statewide high school for gifted children located on the campus of [[Northwestern State University]] in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]]. Treen established the Department of Environmental Quality. He accused "political special interests" loyal to Edwin Edwards with undermining his effort.&lt;ref&gt;"Edwards sabotaging Environmental Department?", ''Minden Press-Herald'', May 19, 1983, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

During his single term, Treen appointed more African Americans to state offices than had any other previous governor in history. He took great pride in this achievement as his best.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clancy DuBos]], [http://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/remembering-dave-treen/Content?oid=1256479 "Remembering Dave Treen"], bestofneworleans.com; accessed June 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Two Treen campaign confidants, [[John H. Cade, Jr.]], of Alexandria and [[William "Billy" Nungesser]] of New Orleans, worked as unpaid advisers in the administration. Cade had managed Treen's successful congressional races in 1972, 1974, 1976, and 1978. He directed the successful 1979 gubernatorial race. Cade was the Republican state chairman from 1976 to 1978, and Nungesser chaired the GOP central committee from 1988 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ron |last=Gomez |authorlink=Ron Gomez |title=My Name Is Ron And I'm a Recovering Legislator: Memoirs of a Louisiana State Representative |location=[[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], Louisiana |publisher=Zemog Publishing |year=2000 |isbn=0-9700156-0-7 |page=65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MtRdNfgA5yQC&amp;pg=PA65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treen named [[Lockport, Louisiana|Lockport]] shipbuilder, [[Donald G. Bollinger]] as the secretary of the [[Louisiana Department of Public Safety &amp; Corrections]]. Bollinger also served for two years as the state Republican chairman prior to Nungesser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bollingershipyards.com/Our-Founder|title=Our founder: Donald G.

Stroud, Jr.]], from assistant adjutant general to [[adjutant general]] of the [[Louisiana National Guard]], a position which Stroud continued to hold until 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/shreveporttimes/obituary.aspx?n=a-m-stroud&amp;pid=180534402&amp;fhid=6593#sthash.kalJIGS7.dpuf|title=Ansel M. Stroud, Jr.|publisher=''[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]''|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treen appointed to office all of the Democratic gubernatorial candidates who endorsed him. Fitzmorris became Executive Assistant for Economic Development. Edgar Mouton was named executive counsel to Treen, but he later abandoned the administration and endorsed the return of Edwin Edwards to the governorship in 1983. Speaker E.L. Henry became the powerful Commissioner of Administration. Treen named Paul Hardy as secretary of the Department of Transportation and Development, with the former Republican mayor of [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]], [[Tom Colten]], as his assistant. Edwards loyalist George Fischer was named secretary of the Department of Health and Human Resources, one of the largest departments in state government.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Gomez, pgs. 65–6&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Democrat legislators are believed to have remained loyal to Edwards, who operated a "shadow government" from the sidelines. Edwards said on leaving office in 1980 that he was on "a brief, mandated hiatus and would be back" in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Gomez, pg. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

Treen obtained legislative passage of his "Professional Improvement Program" (or PIPs) to provide bonuses of $2,000 each to participating public school teachers. The initial $67 million appropriation for the program was increased to $90 million. PIPs allowed instructors to obtain supplemental pay for taking college-level courses and/or attending intensive workshops in order to improve teaching performance.&lt;ref&gt;"Treen vows education is top priority", ''Minden Press-Herald'', October 27, 1981, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Problems developed when numerous teachers signed up for classes with limited academic requirements and shunned the more rigorous courses. Such actions by the educators undermined the purpose of Treen's reform. Edwards dismantled the program when he returned to office in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;"Incentive pay system could replace PIPs", ''Minden Press-Herald'', October 12, 1984, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Treen signed into law a measure requiring "balanced" treatment in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] instruction regarding [[evolution]] and [[creation science]], authored by Senator [[Bill Keith (politician)|Bill Keith]] of Caddo Parish. The measure was struck down in 1987, after Treen had left office, by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in the case ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]],'' as creation science is not science but religious teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19870620&amp;id=tbgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0GADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4418,4944792|title=Ridicule sparked creationism law|work=''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', June 20, 1987|accessdate=November 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treen worked with the Lafayette delegation, including Representatives [[Michael F. "Mike" Thompson|Mike Thompson]] and [[Ron Gomez]], for construction of the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] [[Louisiana–Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns|Ragin' Cajuns]] stadium, the [[Cajundome]]. Construction began in 1982 and was completed and dedicated late in 1985, by which time Edwards had returned to the office.&lt;ref&gt;Rom Gomez, pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Treen developed a reputation for indecision and micromanagement of details. His failure to push for strong conservative policies and governmental reforms disappointed many Republican allies, as did his refusal to oust from his administration allies of Edwin Edwards. Treen presided over resumption of use of [[capital punishment in Louisiana]]. Two convicts were executed by the [[electric chair]] in December 1983 after he was defeated for re-election earlier that year. He established in 1981 the Litter Control and Recycling Commission, as a measure to improve quality of life in cities and other areas. Violators faced potential fines of $100 to $500 and/or several days of litter collection from along state highways.&lt;ref&gt;"Gov. Treen issues warning to litterbugs", ''Minden Press-Herald'', November 11, 1982, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Treen proposed a $450 million tax on [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]], to support preservation of coastal wetlands, as more was being understood about their critical role in protecting the coast. It was known as the Coastal Wetlands Environmental Levy, but the measure ran into strong opposition from conservatives and the trade association, the [[Louisiana Association of Business and Industry]] (LABI). Treen defended CWEL on the premise that it would place no undue burden on any individual or group and would increase the state coffers at a much higher yield than would a boost in the [[state income tax]].&lt;ref&gt;"Treen supports oil, gas tax", ''Minden Press-Herald'', May 7, 1982, pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; LABI director [[Edward J. Steimel]] announced immediate opposition to CWEL.&lt;ref&gt;"Steimel makes faux pas", ''Minden Press-Herald'', May 10, 1982, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt; CWEL was defeated in the Louisiana House although it received approval from a majority of lawmakers; it fell twelve votes short of the required two-thirds needed. Among the opponents were conservative legislators [[Woody Jenkins]] of Baton Rouge and [[B.F. O'Neal, Jr.]], of Shreveport.&lt;ref&gt;"CWEL" defeated in House vote", ''Minden Press-Herald'', June 18, 1982, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat of CWEL, Treen ordered a 3 percent reduction in state employment, with the goal of saving $12 million, far less than the environmental tax would have generated.&lt;ref&gt;"Treen orders cutback in state employment", ''Minden Press-Herald'', June 23, 1982, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, out of office, Treen noted that state finances had declined by $450 million, an amount which he had projected CWEL would have brought into the state treasury.&lt;ref&gt;"Treen: 'I told you so'", ''Minden Press-Herald'', April 14, 1986, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1982, Treen said that he had abandoned his call for new taxes and would attempt to cut $150 million from the state budget to provide seniority raises for state employees. [[Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[John Hainkel]], meanwhile, proposed $40 million in higher taxes, including higher tuition and fees at vocational schools and repeal of a $5 million tax exemption provided to [[Blue Cross Blue Shield]] in Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;"Treen nixes taxes in favor of trimming budget", ''Minden Press-Herald'', December 14, 1982, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1982, Treen vetoed twenty-four bills passed by the legislature on the premise that most would have added expense to the already strained state budget. One of the bills would have exempted [[Butane]] and [[propane gas]] dealers from sales taxes.&lt;ref&gt;"Gov. Treen vetoes 24 bills Wednesday", ''Minden Press-Herald'', August 5, 1982, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Treen worked to reform the state [[worker's compensation]] program, long known for its high insurance rates on business. When a 1982 reform plan failed, Treen blamed LABI because the trade association would not compromise with the Democrats to secure a bill that could pass the legislature. LABI director Ed Steimel declared the worker's compensation problem at the time to be the major roadblock to bringing new and expanded industries into the state.&lt;ref&gt;"Treen blames LABI for worker compensation failure", ''Minden Press-Herald'', July 14, 1982, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1983, a revised worker's compensation bill was passed, and money was earmarked to make the [[unemployment compensation]] fund solvent. No action was taken on a policy involving hiring out [[convict labor]]. "A majority of the Senate thought we had asked for enough. There was a lack of enthusiasm once again against a position taken by [[Victor Bussie]], the president of the state [[AFL-CIO]].&lt;ref&gt;"Special session ends Monday night: Worker's comp passes; fees increased", ''Minden Press-Herald'', January 18, 1983, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treen and Freeman==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
Treen had difficulty working with the [[Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana|lieutenant governor]], Democrat [[Bobby Freeman (politician)|Bobby Freeman]], a former state representative from [[Plaquemine, Louisiana|Plaquemine]] in [[Iberville Parish]] south of Baton Rouge. Considered a [[Liberal (politics)|liberal]] by Louisiana standards, Freeman vowed to exercise gubernatorial powers, as permitted under the state constitution, whenever Treen left the state, either on business or pleasure trips. This recurring threat made it hard for Treen to make out-of-state appearances.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Freeman quarreled with Treen over the 1983-1984 operating budget for the lieutenant governor's office. Treen recommended $411,907, an amount considerably lower than Freeman had requested; the latter said he would have to lay off six of his fifteen employees. Freeman threatened to take Treen to court if he vetoed the larger amount: "I'm certainly not going to continue cooperating with a man who threatens me and my employees."&lt;ref&gt;"Freeman lashes out at Treen", ''Minden Press-Herald'', June 30, 1983, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Treen continued to maintain that Freeman had "padded" his salary expenses by the $133,000 difference between the two budget figures. As he had threatened, Freeman filed suit against the governor.&lt;ref&gt;"Freeman sues Gov. Treen over office budget loss", ''Minden Press-Herald'', July 20, 1983, p. 5A&lt;/ref&gt; Freeman worked for the return of Edwin Edwards to the governorship. Freeman won re-election in 1983 by defeating Edwards' first lieutenant governor, fellow Democrat Fitzmorris. Treen suffered a stinging defeat by Edwards.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Facing Edwards again, 1983==
Treen and Edwards were known as fierce rivals. Treen began his campaign for a second term in December 1982, with John Cade leading the group, 'People for Dave Treen.' At first, Cade emerged as the governor's campaign spokesman so that he could concentrate on his job duties. Cade questioned Edwards' decision to forgo his gubernatorial retirement income of $40,000 per year on the grounds that Edwards was no longer "retired" because he was running to reclaim the governorship. Cade said that Edwards would have collected only $14,000 in pension and not before the age of sixty had he not engineered legislative approval of the more lucrative package.&lt;ref&gt;"Treen opens campaign against Edwards", ''Minden Press-Herald'', December 10, 1982, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

At a fundraiser in [[Thibodaux, Louisiana|Thibodaux]] to celebrate his 55th birthday, Treen said that Edwards in 1980 "left a pile of unpaid bills and a stinking surplus of [[hazardous waste]] dumps."&lt;ref&gt;"Pile of unpaid bills; a stinking surplus", ''Minden Press-Herald'', July 18, 1983, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 30, 1983, Edwards raised far more campaign cash than Treen, $5.4 million to $2.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;"Edwards outspends Treen", ''Minden Press-Herald'', July 25, 1983, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; On October 9, the comedian [[Bob Hope]] headlined a Treen fundraiser at $1,000 per ticket held in the Downtown Sheraton Hotel in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;"Hope headlines Treen fundraiser", ''Minden Press-Herald'', August 26, 1983, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Treen picked up the support of former U.S. Representative [[James Domengeaux]], a Democrat from [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] and director of the [[Council for the Development of French in Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;"Treen, Edwards list campaign contributors", April 26, 1983, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Representative [[Gillis William Long]] of Alexandria endorsed Edwards. Of Treen, Long, said: "I dealt with him for seven year [in the House], and I think he has a hard time working with people and coming up with compromise solutions."&lt;ref name=glong&gt;"Rep. Gillis Long endorses Edwards", ''Minden Press-Herald'', April 12, 1983, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Long incorrectly predicted that the Treen-Edwards showdown would be "a close race." Long said that the state political arena had changed from 1971, when he ran for governor, to the 1983 contest, from "the politics of personality to the politics of demographics."&lt;ref name=glong/&gt;

Treen challenged Edwards regarding the issuance of [[pardon]]s and [[parole]]s. Whereas Treen had signed 34 pardons in three and a half years in the office, Edwards had approved 1,526 pardons or [[commutation of sentence|commutations]] of sentences in his first two terms. One of those pardoned in 1980 was a man who became a client of and murdered Edwards' brother, Nolan Edwards, an attorney in [[Crowley, Louisiana|Crowley]].&lt;ref&gt;"Edwards pardoned killer", ''Minden Press-Herald'', August 19, 1983, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards handily unseated Treen to secure the third of his four terms as governor. Treen won a handful of parishes, including rural [[La Salle Parish]] in north Louisiana, which supported him in all three of his gubernatorial bids. Treen received 586,643 (36.3 percent) to Edwards' 1,008,282 (62.4 percent). Another 1.3 percent was cast for minor candidates, one of whom was Robert M. Ross, Treen's Republican primary rival in 1971.

==Failed nomination to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals==
After Treen's defeat for governor, President Reagan nominated him on July 22, 1987 for a seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] in New Orleans created by the death of veteran Judge [[Albert Tate, Jr.]] However, the appointment was delayed by Democratic senators on the [[U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/23/us/ex-louisiana-leader-to-be-named-a-judge.html "Ex-Louisiana Leader To Be Named a Judge"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 23, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; who objected to Treen's past membership in the [[National States' Rights Party|States' Rights Party]] and other allegations. Treen withdrew his name from consideration in late April 1988, saying that he "could not afford to defer my professional and business activities" any longer, and that "some persons on the Democrat-controlled committee would just as soon see the vacancy go unfilled until after the election....in the hope that a Democrat will succeed to the White House."{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The Senate wound up confirming Reagan's second choice, attorney [[John Malcolm Duhé, Jr.]], a [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]], later Lafayette, lawyer, who was the son-in-law of New Orleans Congressman F. Edward Hebert and former law partner of retired 3rd District Congressman Patrick T. Caffery. Another of Congressman Caffery's former law partners, Eugene Davis, was named to the federal bench in 1976 by President Gerald Ford and now sits on the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, where Duhé had served.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Other political bids considered==
Nonetheless, Treen maintained political ambitions even after his landslide defeat for re-election as governor. In 1984, he filed candidacy papers to oppose U.S. Senator [[Bennett Johnston]], but quickly withdrew from the race, apparently when polls showed the popular Johnston unbeatable even in a potentially national Republican year.&lt;ref&gt;"Candidate predicts Johnston defeat", ''Minden Press-Herald'', July 24, 1984, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Treen out of race", ''Minden Press-Herald'', July 25, 1984, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Treen considered, but decided against making, gubernatorial bids in 1991, 1995, and 2003.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Treen endorses Edwards==
In 1991, despite their differences, Treen endorsed Edwards' bid for a fourth term because the Republican candidate who survived the nonpartisan blanket primary was State Representative [[David Duke]], a former member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and  by then a [[perennial candidate]] who was troublesome to the GOP and the business community. Though Duke claimed to have ended his ties to the KKK, there was lingering suspicion that he was still in contact with neo-[[Nazi]], [[anti-Semitic]], and other radical elements. Treen denounced Duke's candidacy: "I think he is bad for our party because of his espousal of [[Nazi]]sm and racial superiority."&lt;ref&gt;"Treen: Renounce David Duke's 'garbage'", ''Minden Press-Herald'', December 22, 1989, p. 7A&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, Duke won his single victory for public office, a seat in the state House, by narrowly defeating Treen's brother, [[John S. Treen]], a home builder in Jefferson Parish. Many Republicans blamed John Treen's lackluster campaign in that race for Duke's emergence as a major player in the 1990 [[U.S. Senate]] race, when he made a noticeable bid against incumbent Johnston, and in the 1991 gubernatorial election, when Duke secured a general election berth. A new [[interest group]], the [[Louisiana Coalition against Racism and Nazism]], appeared to fight the Duke gubernatorial candidacy. Among its leaders was the Republican political activist and longtime Treen supporter, [[Beth Rickey]] of New Orleans and the journalist [[Quin Hillyer]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Congressional comeback attempt fails by 1,812 votes==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
In 1999, Treen attempted a political comeback by running [[Louisiana's 1st congressional district special election, 1999|for the U.S. House.]] By this time, his home in Mandeville had been drawn into the 1st District. That seat was being vacated by Representative [[Bob Livingston]], who left Congress in a sex scandal amid the House vote on the [[impeachment]] of President [[Bill Clinton]]. This was the eighth election that Treen's name appeared on a Louisiana ballot for Congress.

In the special election with David Duke, also trying to score a comeback, and Republican State Representative [[David Vitter]], Treen finished first with 36,719 votes (25%) to Vitter's 31,741 (22%) and Duke's 28,055 (19%). (Six other candidates, including New Orleans businessman [[Rob Couhig]], shared the remaining 33% of the votes cast.) In the low-turnout special election runoff, Vitter defeated Treen, 61,661 ballots (51%) to 59,849 (49%), a margin of 1,812 votes. The race against Vitter was a bitter contest, with attacks flying back and forth. Many of Vitter's colleagues in the state legislature supported Treen and charged that Vitter was difficult to work with as a legislator. Duke, hoping to damage Treen's chances, endorsed the former Governor, and Vitter won the seat. In 2005, Vitter left the House to become the first Republican to be elected to the U.S. Senate from Louisiana since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Treen in retirement==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Treen declared that he would run for governor again in the [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 2003|2003 election]], at the age of 75, but the party leadership coalesced behind [[Bobby Jindal]]. Treen withdrew from the pre-primary race and worked for Jindal's election. Jindal lost the general election to Democratic Lieutenant Governor [[Kathleen Babineaux Blanco]] of Lafayette (who actually lost [[Lafayette Parish]] in the election). A year later, Jindal filled the House seat that Vitter vacated to become senator, the same seat that Treen had lost in his last campaign for elective office. Treen even discussed running for governor again in 2007 but never filed candidacy papers.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In 2007, Jindal won the governor's election outright in the primary. Treen's old rival and reluctant ally, Edwin Edwards, meanwhile, went to prison for racketeering connected with his fourth gubernatorial term, the one that Treen had reluctantly blessed in preference to his greater nemesis, David Duke. Treen had urged then President [[George W. Bush]] to pardon Edwards or to commute his sentence to the time already served.

There was also speculation that Edwards actually voted for Treen in the 1979 election because he preferred to face Treen again in 1983, rather than the other Democratic possibilities who were running for governor against Treen. Earl Long similarly often quietly voted for the "anti-Long" gubernatorial candidate himself to set up a potential new governor for failure. Long would then run for governor again four years later against the "failed" (in Long's eyes) governor's stand-in. That was before Louisiana governors could succeed themselves in office. In 1997, Treen became the first Republican inducted into the [[Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame]] in [https://web.archive.org/web/20090703054258/http://cityofwinnfield.com/museum.html Winnfield, Louisiana].

==2008 Congressional bid==
Treen announced on October 23, 2007, that he would be a candidate in the March 8 [[Louisiana's 1st congressional district special election, 2008|special election]] to succeed [[Bobby Jindal]], who was elected governor. He cited his experience and political ties in Washington, D.C. as reasons for his candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/capital/index.ssf?/base/news-5/119311923630980.xml&amp;coll=1 Treen to seek Jindal's 1st District House seat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115112858/http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/capital/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-5%2F119311923630980.xml&amp;coll=1 |date=January 15, 2008 }}, nola.com, October 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Treen had lost a race for this same seat in a 1999 special election to eventual [[U.S. Senator]] [[David Vitter]]. Four Republicans filed for the seat, and two faced an April 5 runoff election restricted to registered party members: State Representative [[Timothy Burns (Louisiana politician)|Timothy G. Burns]] and State Senator [[Steve Scalise]]. Scalise won the runoff and a month later defeated Democrat Gilda Reed, a favorite of organized labor and the party's constituent groups. Treen withdrew from consideration on January 28.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/01/treen_passes_on_congressional.html Campaign watch: Two quit race for Jindal seat in U.S. House], ''[[The New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'', January 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Treen endorsed the reelection of Democratic U.S. Senator [[Mary Landrieu]] in her 2008 race against Republican state Treasurer [[John Neely Kennedy]], who resided in Mandeville, where Treen lived at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Hasten, [http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20081104/NEWS01/311040037 "Kennedy, Landrieu push for votes as Senate showdown approaches"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Daily Town Talk]]'', November 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Treen died from complications from a [[respiratory illness]] at [[East Jefferson General Hospital]] in Metairie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdsu.com/politics/21462922/detail.html Former Louisiana Gov. Dave Treen Dead At 81] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927230211/http://www.wdsu.com/politics/21462922/detail.html |date=September 27, 2011 }}, October 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Condolences and kinds words poured in from around the state, typified by [[Southeastern Louisiana University]] president [[John L. Crain]]'s tribute that Treen "was a true Louisiana icon, a Republican governor in Louisiana before it was cool". His body lay in state at the [[Louisiana State Capitol]] following a memorial service on November 2, 2009. A second memorial service was held at St. Timothy United Methodist Church in [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]] on November 3. The family requested memorials to, among several charities, the Methodist Children's Home in Mandeville.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Republican State Chairman [[Roger F. Villere, Jr.]], of Metairie called the former governor "a courageous man who loved our country and our state. He fought the political establishment in the 1960s and 1970s when it was very difficult to elect a Republican in our state, and his career in political office was marked with integrity and fiscal discipline. It is important for younger voters to understand that Louisiana's commitment to high ethical standards and the existence of a viable two-party system in our state are relatively new developments. Just a quarter century ago, neither existed in a significant way. Dave Treen laid the foundation to change all that, and for that, millions of Louisiana citizens owe him a profound debt of gratitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lagop.com/2009/10/statement-from-chairman-villere-following-the-death-of-david-treen |title=Statement from Chairman Roger Villere Following the Death of David Treen |publisher=lagop.com |accessdate=November 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713181249/http://lagop.com/2009/10/statement-from-chairman-villere-following-the-death-of-david-treen/ |archivedate=July 13, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cleopatra}}

The '''death of Cleopatra VII''', the last reigning ruler of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], occurred on either 10 or 12 August 30 BC in [[Alexandria]], when she was 39 years old. According to a popular belief, [[Cleopatra]] committed suicide by allowing an [[Asp (reptile)|asp]] ([[Egyptian cobra]]) to bite her. According to [[Greek historiography|Greek]] and [[Roman historiography|Roman historians]], Cleopatra [[Poisoning|poisoned]] herself using either a [[Neurotoxin|toxic]] ointment or sharp implement such as a hairpin. [[Primary source]] accounts are derived mainly from the works of the ancient Roman historians [[Strabo]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Cassius Dio]]. Modern scholars debate the validity of ancient reports involving snakebites as the cause of death and even if she was murdered or not. Some academics hypothesize that her [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] political rival [[Octavian]] forced her to commit suicide in the manner of her choosing. The location of [[Tomb of Antony and Cleopatra|Cleopatra's tomb]] is unknown, although it was recorded that Octavian allowed for her and husband [[Mark Antony]], who stabbed himself with a sword, to be [[Ancient Greek funeral and burial practices|buried together properly]].

Cleopatra's death effectively ended [[Final War of the Roman Republic|the final war]] of the [[Roman Republic]] between [[Second Triumvirate|triumvirs]] Octavian and Antony, in which Cleopatra aligned herself with Antony, father to three of her children. Antony and Cleopatra fled to Egypt following their loss at the 31 BC [[Battle of Actium]] in [[Roman Greece]], after which Octavian invaded Egypt and defeated their forces. Her suicide allowed her to avoid the humiliation of being paraded as a prisoner in a [[Roman triumph]] celebrating the [[Wars of Augustus|military victories of Octavian]], who would become [[Roman emperor|Rome's first emperor]] in 27 BC and known as [[Augustus]]. Octavian had her son Caesarion (also known as [[Ptolemy XV]]), rival heir of [[Julius Caesar]], killed in Egypt but spared her children with Antony and brought them to [[Rome]]. Cleopatra's death marked the end of the [[Hellenistic period]] and [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic rule]] of [[History of Egypt|Egypt]], as well as the beginning of [[Roman Egypt]], which became a [[Roman province|province]] of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref group="note" name="Grant Hellenistic period explanation"&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1972|pp=5–6}} notes that the [[Hellenistic period]], beginning with the reign of [[Alexander the Great]] (336–323 BC), came to an end with the death of Cleopatra in 30 BC. [[Michael Grant (classicist)|Michael Grant]] stresses that the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic Greeks]] were viewed by contemporary Romans as having declined and diminished in greatness since the age of [[Classical Greece]], an attitude that has continued even into the works of modern [[historiography]]. In regards to [[Hellenistic Egypt]], Grant argues that "Cleopatra VII, looking back upon all that her ancestors had done during that time, was not likely to make the same mistake. But she and her contemporaries of the first century BC had another, peculiar, problem of their own. Could the '[[Hellenistic Age]]' (which we ourselves often regard as coming to an end in about her time) still be said to exist at all, could ''any'' Greek age, now that [[Roman Republic|the Romans]] were the dominant power? This was a question never far from Cleopatra's mind. But it is quite certain that she considered the Greek epoch to be by no means finished, and intended to do everything in her power to ensure its perpetuation."&lt;/ref&gt; 

The death of Cleopatra has been depicted in [[List of cultural depictions of Cleopatra|various works of art]] in ancient, medieval, early modern, and modern times. These include the visual, literary, and performance arts, ranging from sculptures and paintings to poetry and plays, as well as modern films. Cleopatra featured prominently in the prose and poetry of ancient [[Latin literature]]. While surviving [[Roman art|ancient Roman]] depictions of her death in visual arts are rare, [[Medieval art|Medieval]], [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]], [[Baroque art|Baroque]], and [[Modern art|Modern]] works are numerous. Ancient [[Greco-Roman]] [[Roman sculpture|sculptures]] such as the ''[[Esquiline Venus]]'' and ''[[Sleeping Ariadne]]'' served as inspirations for later artworks portraying her death, universally involving the snakebite of an asp. Cleopatra's death has also involved themes of [[eroticism]] and sexuality, in works that include paintings, plays, and films, especially from the [[Victorian era]]. Modern works depicting Cleopatra's death include [[Neoclassical sculpture]], [[Orientalist painting]], and cinema.

Following the [[First Triumvirate]] and [[assassination of Julius Caesar]] in 44 BC, the Roman statesmen [[Octavian]], [[Mark Antony]], and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Aemilius Lepidus]] were [[Elections in the Roman Republic|elected]] as [[triumvirate|triumvir]]s to [[Liberators' civil war|bring Caesar's assassins to justice]], forming the [[Second Triumvirate]].{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=75}}{{sfnp|Burstein|2004|pp=xxi, 21–22}} With Lepidus marginalized in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] and eventually placed under house arrest by Octavian,{{sfnp|Bringmann|2007|p=301}}{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=98}}{{sfnp|Burstein|2004|p=27}} the two remaining triumvirs divided control over the Roman world between the [[Greek East and Latin West]], with Antony taking the former and Octavian the latter.{{sfnp|Grant|Badian|2018|}}{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=76}} [[Cleopatra VII]] of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], a pharaoh of [[Macedon]]ian [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] descent, ruling from Alexandria,{{sfnp|Roller|2010|pp=15–16}}{{sfnp|Jones|2006|pp=xiii, 3, 279}}{{sfnp|Southern|2009|p=43}} had an extramarital affair with [[Julius Caesar]] that produced a son and eventual [[List of Ptolemaic rulers|Ptolemaic]] co-ruler [[Caesarion]].{{sfnp|Bringmann|2007|p=260}}{{sfnp|Fletcher|2008|pp=162–163}}{{sfnp|Jones|2006|p=xiv}} After Caesar's death she developed a relationship with Antony.{{sfnp|Grant|Badian|2018|}}{{sfnp|Roller|2010|pp=76–84}}{{sfnp|Burstein|2004|pp=xxii, 25}}

Following their defeat in the naval [[Battle of Actium]] at the [[Ambracian Gulf]] of Greece in 31 BC, Cleopatra and Antony retreated back to Egypt to recuperate and prepare for an assault by Octavian, whose forces grew larger with the surrender of many of Antony's officers and soldiers in Greece.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=140}}{{sfnp|Burstein|2004|pp=xxii–xxiii, 30–31}}{{sfnp|Bringmann|2007|p=304}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For further validation, see {{harvnb|Southern|2009|pp=149–150}} and {{harvnb|Grout|2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After a long period of failed negotiations, Octavian's forces invaded Egypt in the spring of 30 BC.{{sfnp|Burstein|2004|pp=xxiii, 31}}{{sfnp|Roller|2010|pp=144–145}} While Octavian captured [[Pelousion]] near the eastern borders of Ptolemaic Egypt, his officer [[Cornelius Gallus]] marched from [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] and captured [[Mersa Matruh|Paraitonion]] to the west.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=145}}{{sfnp|Southern|2009|p=153}} Although Antony was able to score a small victory over Octavian's tired troops as they approached Alexandria's [[hippodrome]] on 1 August 30 BC, Antony's naval fleet and cavalry defected to Octavian soon afterwards.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=145}}{{sfnp|Bringmann|2007|p=304}}{{sfnp|Southern|2009|pp=153–154}}

With Octavian's forces in Alexandria, Cleopatra withdrew to her tomb with her closest attendants and had a message sent to Antony that she had committed suicide. Antony ordered his slave Eros to murder him, but instead Eros turned his sword on himself and committed suicide.{{sfnp|Southern|2009|p=154}}{{sfnp|Jones|2006|p=184}} In despair, Antony stabbed himself through the stomach with a sword, dying at age 53.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=145}}{{sfnp|Bringmann|2007|p=304}}{{sfnp|Burstein|2004|p=31}} In [[Plutarch]]'s telling, Antony was still alive as he was carried into the tomb of Cleopatra, telling her in his dying words that he would die honorably and that she could trust a certain [[:de:Gaius Proculeius|Gaius Proculeius]] on Octavian's side to treat her well.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=145}}{{sfnp|Southern|2009|pp=154–155}}{{sfnp|Jones|2006|pp=184–185}} The same Proculeius used a ladder to breach a window of Cleopatra's tomb and detain her inside before she could have a chance to commit suicide or burn herself to death along with her vast treasure.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=145}}{{sfnp|Jones|2006|pp=185–186}} Cleopatra was allowed to [[embalm]] Antony's body before she was forcefully escorted to the palace and eventually met with Octavian, who had also detained three of her children: [[Alexander Helios]], [[Cleopatra Selene II]], and [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (son of Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]].{{sfnp|Burstein|2004|p=31}}{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=146}}{{sfnp|Southern|2009|p=155}}

As related by [[Livy]], in her meeting with Octavian, Cleopatra told him candidly, "I will not be led in a triumph" ({{lang-grc|οὑ θριαμβεύσομαι|ou thriambéusomai}}), but Octavian only gave the cryptic answer that her life would be spared.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|pp=146–147, 213 footnote83}}{{sfnp|Gurval|2011|p=61}} He did not offer her any specific details about his plans for Egypt or her royal family.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|pp=146–147}} When a spy informed Cleopatra that Octavian intended to bring her back to [[Rome]] to be paraded as a prisoner in his [[Roman triumph]], she decided to avoid this humiliation and take her own life at age 39, in August 30 BC.{{sfnp|Bringmann|2007|p=304}}{{sfnp|Roller|2010|pp=147–148}}{{sfnp|Burstein|2004|pp=xxiii, 31–32}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For further validation, see {{harvnb|Jones|2006|p=180}} and {{harvnb|Grout|2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch elaborates how Cleopatra approached her suicide in an almost ritual process, preceded by bathing and then a fine meal including figs brought to her in a basket.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=147}}{{sfnp|Anderson|2003|p=56}}{{sfnp|Jones|2006|p=194}}

Plutarch writes that Octavian ordered his freedman [[Epaphroditus (freedman of Augustus)|Epaphroditus]] to guard her and prevent her from committing suicide.{{sfnp|Plutarch|1920|p=79}} However, Cleopatra was able to deceive him and kill herself nevertheless.{{sfnp|Plutarch|1920|p=79}} When Octavian received a note from Cleopatra requesting that she be buried next to Antony, he had his messengers rush to her.

He states unequivocally that Olympos did not describe any cause of death, only that Plutarch discussed the cause of death only after he was finished relaying the report by Olympos, introducing the tale of the asp bite in such a way that he expected his readers to have already had foreknowledge about it. {{harvnb|Maloney|2010|p=3}}, on the other hand, claims that Olympos "theorized" about Cleopatra's cause of death as being caused by an asp bite or toxic ointment.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]], who provides the earliest known historical account, believed that Cleopatra committed suicide either by asp bite or poisonous ointment.{{sfnp|Anderson|2003|p=56}}{{sfnp|Jones|2006|p=197}}{{sfnp|Gurval|2011|p=55}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For further validation, see {{harvnb|Roller|2010|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch mentions the tale of the asp brought to her in a basket of figs, although he offers other alternatives for her cause of death, such as use of a hollow implement ({{lang-el|κνηστίς|knestis}}), perhaps a hairpin,{{sfnp|Jones|2006|p=194}} which she used to scratch open the skin and introduce the toxin.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=148}} According to Cassius Dio small puncture wounds were found on Cleopatra's arm, but he echoed the claim by Plutarch that nobody knew the true cause of her death.{{sfnp|Jones|2006|pp=194–195}}{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=148}}{{sfnp|Grout|2017}} Dio mentioned the claim of the asp and even suggested use of a needle ({{lang-el|βελὁνη|belone}}), possibly from a hairpin, which would seem to corroborate with Plutarch's account.{{sfnp|Jones|2006|pp=194–195}}{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=148}}{{sfnp|Grout|2017}} Other historians such as [[Florus]] and [[Velleius Paterculus]] supported the asp bite version.{{sfnp|Jones|2006|pp=189–190}}{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=149}} Roman physician [[Galen]] mentioned the asp story,{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=149}} but he also narrated a version where Cleopatra bit her arm and introduced venom there brought to her in a container.{{sfnp|Jones|2006|pp=195–197}} [[Suetonius]] relayed the story of the asp but expressed doubt about it.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=149}}

Modern scholars have also cast doubt on the story of the [[venomous snake]]bite as the cause of death. Duane W. Roller notes the prominence of snakes in [[Egyptian mythology]] while also asserting that no surviving historical account discusses the difficulty of smuggling a large Egyptian cobra into Cleopatra's chambers and then having it behave as intended.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=148}} William Maloney concurs with this assessment, noting the incredible weight of these reptiles, but states that their venom is very powerful,{{sfnp|Maloney|2010|p=3}} whereas Roller claims the venom is only fatal if injected into a vital area of the body.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=148}} The German [[Egyptologist]] [[Wilhelm Spiegelberg]] (1870–1930) argued that Cleopatra's choice of suicide by asp bite was one that befitted her royal status, with the asp representing the ''[[uraeus]]'', sacred serpent of the [[ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egyptian]] sun god [[Ra]].{{sfnp|Gurval|2011|p=56}} However, Robert A. Gurval points out that the [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] ''[[strategos]]'' [[Demetrios of Phaleron]] (c. 350 – c. 280 BC), confined by [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] in Egypt, committed suicide by asp bite in a "curiously similar" manner, one that also demonstrated that it was not exclusive to Egyptian royalty.{{sfnp|Gurval|2011|p=58}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For further validation that [[Demetrios of Phaleron]], adviser to [[Ptolemy I Soter]], died from an asp bite, see {{harvnb|Roller|2010|p=149}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gurval notes that the bite of an Egyptian cobra contains around 175–300&amp;nbsp;mg of [[neurotoxin]], lethal to humans with only 15–20&amp;nbsp;mg, although death would not have been immediate as victims usually stay alive for several hours.{{sfnp|Gurval|2011|p=60}}

According to Gregory Tsoucalas and Markos Sgantzos, evidence suggests that Octavian ordered the poisoning of Cleopatra.{{sfnp|Tsoucalas|Sgantzos|2014|pp=19–20}} Their claim of alleged murder by Octavian is supported by other authors such as Maloney.{{sfnp|Maloney|2010|pp=3–4}} In her ''Murder of Cleopatra: History's Greatest Cold Case'' (2013), the criminal profiler [[Pat Brown (criminal profiler)|Pat Brown]] argues that Cleopatra was murdered and the details of it were covered up by Roman authorities.{{sfnp|Nuwer|2013}} Claims that she was murdered, however, contradict the majority of primary sources that report her cause of death as suicide.{{sfnp|Jones|2006|pp=180–201}} The English historian [[Patricia Southern]] speculates that Octavian could have possibly allowed Cleopatra to choose the manner of her death instead of executing her.{{sfnp|Southern|2009|p=154}} James Grout writes that Octavian may have wanted to avoid the sort of sympathy espoused for Cleopatra's younger sister [[Arsinoe IV]] when she was paraded in chains but spared during [[Military campaigns of Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's triumph]].{{sfnp|Grout|2017}} Realizing the political problems of killing a queen whose statue had been erected by his adoptive father Caesar in the Temple of [[Venus Genetrix]], Octavian perhaps permitted Cleopatra "to die by her own hand," according to Grout.{{sfnp|Grout|2017}}

Although rather artificial looking wigs set in the traditional tripartite style of long straight hair would have been required for her appearances before her Egyptian subjects, a more practical option for general day-to-day wear was the no-nonsense '[[Greco-Roman hairstyle|melon hairdo]]' in which her natural hair was drawn back in sections resembling the lines on a melon and then pinned up in a bun at the back of the head. A trademark style of [[Arsinoe II]] and [[Berenice II|Berenike II]], the style had fallen from fashion for almost two centuries until revived by Cleopatra; yet as both traditionalist and innovator, she wore her version without her predecessor's fine head veil. And whereas they had both been [[blonde]] like [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], Cleopatra may well have been a [[redhead]], judging from the portrait of a flame-haired woman wearing the royal diadem surrounded by [[Ancient Egyptian art|Egyptian motifs]] which has been identified as Cleopatra."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In his triumphal procession at Rome in 29 BC, Octavian paraded Cleopatra's children Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II, but he also presented an effigy to the crowd depicting Cleopatra with an asp clinging to her.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|pp=149, 153}}{{sfnp|Anderson|2003|p=56}}{{sfnp|Burstein|2004|p=66}} This was likely the same painting discovered in emperor [[Hadrian's Villa]] in 1818, now lost but described in an archaeological report and [[:File:Cleopatra_VII,_steel_engraving_of_the_encaustic_painting_found_at_Hadrian%27s_Villa_in_1818.jpg|depicted]] in a [[steel engraving]] by [[John Sartain]].{{sfnp|Pratt|Fizel|1949|pp=14–15}}{{sfnp|Sartain|1885|pp=41, 44}} However, the poet [[Propertius]], an eyewitness of Octavian's triumph along the [[Via Sacra]], noted that the paraded image of Cleopatra contained multiple snakes biting each of her arms.{{sfnp|Gurval|2011|p=60}}{{sfnp|Curran|2011|p=116}} Citing Plutarch, Giuseppe Pucci indicates that the effigy may have even been a statue.{{sfnp|Pucci|2011|p=202}} In his "Notes isiaques I" (1989), French Archaeologist [[:fr:Jean-Claude Grenier (égyptologue)|Jean-Claude Grenier]] observed that an ancient [[Roman portraiture|Roman statue]] of a woman wearing a [[Tyet|knot of Isis]] in the [[Vatican Museums]] portrays a snake crawling up her right breast, perhaps a depiction of Cleopatra's suicide while dressed as the [[Egyptian goddess]] [[Isis]].{{sfnp|Pucci|2011|pp=202–203, 207 footnote 28}}

The story of Cleopatra's suicide by snakebite was often depicted in [[Medieval art|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance art]]. In a [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] of a 1409 AD [[illuminated manuscript]] of the 14th-century AD poet [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''Des cas de nobles hommes et femmes'', the [[Boucicaut Master]] [[:File:Tomb of Cleopatra and Mark Antony, illuminated manuscript of Boccaccio, miniature by the Boucicaut master, 1409 AD (cropped).jpg|depicted Cleopatra and Antony lying together]] in a [[International Gothic|Gothic-style]] tomb, with a snake near Cleopatra's chest and a bloody sword through Antony's chest.{{sfnp|Anderson|2003|pp=53–54}} Illustrated versions of Boccaccio's written works, including images of Cleopatra and Antony committing suicide, first appeared in France during the [[Quattrocento]] (i.e. 15th century AD), authored by [[Laurent de Premierfait]].{{sfnp|Anderson|2003|p=51}} [[Woodcut]] illustrations of Boccaccio's ''[[De Mulieribus Claris]]'' published at [[Ulm]] in 1479 and [[Augsburg]] in 1541 depict Cleopatra's discovery of Antony's body after his suicide by stabbing.{{sfnp|Anderson|2003|pp=50–52}}

Like much of [[Medieval literature]] about Cleopatra, Boccaccio's writings are largely negative and misogynistic. However, they were countered by the 14th-century poet [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], who offered a positive view of Cleopatra.{{sfnp|Anderson|2003|pp=51–54}} Chaucer began his [[hagiography]] [[The Legend of Good Women|on virtuous pagan women]] with the life of Cleopatra, depicted in a satirical fashion as a queen engaged in [[courtly love]] with her knight Mark Antony.{{sfnp|Gurval|2011|pp=73–74}}{{sfnp|Jones|2006|pp=214–215}} However, Chaucer's depiction of her suicide included a pit of serpents rather than the Roman tale of the asps.{{sfnp|Gurval|2011|p=74}}{{sfnp|Jones|2006|pp=221–222}}

[[File:Cleopatra - Michelangelo Buonarroti.png|thumb|upright|left|''Cleopatra'', by [[Michelangelo]], c. 1535]]
During the [[Italian Renaissance]], free-standing nude depictions of Cleopatra poisoned by an asp were common.{{sfnp|Anderson|2003|p=60}} The 16th-century [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian artist]] Giovanni Maria Padovano (i.e. Mosca) created two marble reliefs of the suicide of Antony and Cleopatra, as well as various free-standing nude statues of Cleopatra being bitten by the asp that were partly inspired by ancient [[Roman sculpture]]s such as the ''[[Esquiline Venus]]''.{{sfnp|Anderson|2003|pp=56–59}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As outlined by {{harvnb|Pina Polo|2013|pp=186, 194 footnote 10}}, {{harvnb|Roller|2010|p=175}}, {{harvnb|Anderson|2003|p=59}}, scholars debate whether or not the ''[[Esquiline Venus]]''—discovered in 1874 on the [[Esquiline Hill]] in Rome and housed in the [[Palazzo dei Conservatori]] of the [[Capitoline Museums]]—is a depiction of Cleopatra, based on the [[commons:Category:Esquiline Venus (Musei Capitolini)|hairstyle and facial features]] of the woman in the sculpture, her apparent royal diadem worn over the head, and the [[uraeus]] [[Egyptian cobra]] wrapped around a vase or column at the base. As explained by {{harvnb|Roller|2010|p=175}}, the ''Esquiline Venus'' is generally thought to be a mid-1st century AD [[Interpretatio graeca|Roman copy]] of a 1st century BC Greek original from the school of [[Pasiteles]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bartolommeo Bandinelli]] created a drawing of Cleopatra as a free-standing nude committing suicide that served as the basis for a similar engraving by [[Agostino Veneziano]].{{sfnp|Anderson|2003|p=60}} Another engraving by Veneziano and a drawing by [[Raphael]] depicting Cleopatra's suicide as she slumbered were inspired by the ancient [[Greco-Roman]] ''[[Sleeping Ariadne]]'', which at the time was thought to depict Cleopatra.{{sfnp|Anderson|2003|pp=60–61}}{{sfnp|Pucci|2011|p=203}} Works of the [[French Renaissance]] also depict Cleopatra slumbering while pressing a snake to her breast.{{sfnp|Anderson|2003|p=61}} [[Michelangelo]] created a black-chalk drawing of Cleopatra's suicide by asp bite around 1535.{{sfnp|Anderson|2003|p=62}} The 17th-century [[Baroque]] painter [[Guido Reni]] [[:File:Guido Reni - Cleopatra - WGA19301.jpg|depicted Cleopatra's death]] by asp bite, although the snake depicted is tiny compared to a real Egyptian cobra.{{sfnp|Gurval|2011|p=59}}

The ''Sleeping Ariadne'', acquired by [[Pope Julius II]] in 1512, inspired the composition of [[Renaissance literature]]: three poems that were eventually carved into the [[pilaster]] frame of the statue.{{sfnp|Curran|2011|pp=114–116}} The first of these poems was published by [[Baldassare Castiglione]], which became widely circulated by 1530 and inspired the other two by [[Bernardino Baldi]] and [[Agostino Favoriti]].{{sfnp|Curran|2011|p=116}} Castiglione's poem depicted Cleopatra as a tragic but honorable ruler in a doomed love affair with Antony, a queen whose death freed her from the ignominy of Roman imprisonment.{{sfnp|Curran|2011|pp=116–117}} The ''Sleeping Ariadne'' was also commonly depicted in paintings, including those by [[Titian]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], and [[Edward Burne-Jones]].{{sfnp|Pucci|2011|p=203}} These works tended to [[Erotic art|eroticize]] the moment of Cleopatra's death, while [[Victorian era]] artists found the unconscious, recumbent female form as an acceptable outlet for their eroticism.{{sfnp|Pucci|2011|p=203}}

Cleopatra's death is featured in various works of the performing arts. In the 1607 [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Devil's Charter]]'' by [[Barnabe Barnes]], a [[snake handler]] brings the two asps to Cleopatra and allows them to bite both her breasts in a racy manner.{{sfnp|Anderson|2003|p=62}} In [[William Shakespeare]]'s 1609 play ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' the snake represents both death as well as a lover who Cleopatra desires, yielding to his pinch.{{sfnp|Anderson|2003|p=62}} Shakespeare relied on [[Thomas North]]'s 1579 translation of Plutarch for crafting his play, which can be viewed as both a comedy and a tragedy.{{sfnp|Jones|2006|p=223}} The play involved use of multiple asps, as well as the character of Charmion who killed herself by asp bite after Cleopatra.{{sfnp|Jones|2006|pp=233–234}}

===Modern era===

Mankiewicz]] contains a dramatic scene where the Egyptian queen, portrayed by [[Elizabeth Taylor]], is engaged in a slap-fight with her lover Mark Antony, portrayed by [[Richard Burton]], inside the tomb where they would be interred.{{sfnp|Wyke|Montserrat|2011|p=190}}

In other modern visual arts, Cleopatra has been depicted in mediums such as paintings and sculptures. In her 1876 sculpture ''The Death of Cleopatra'', African American artist [[Edmonia Lewis]], despite championing the non-white female form in artworks, chose to depict Cleopatra with [[Caucasian race|Caucasian features]], perhaps in keeping with Cleopatra's recorded lineage as a [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian Greek]].{{sfnp|Pucci|2011|pp=201–202}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Pucci|2011|p=201}} affirms that "to give Cleopatra a white complexion is quite correct, given her Macedonian descent. In literature, however, Cleopatra's racial features are more ambiguous." &lt;br&gt;For Cleopatra's European origins through her ancestor [[Ptolemy I Soter]], a general of [[Alexander the Great]] from the kingdom of [[Macedon]]ia in [[northern Greece]], see {{harvnb|Fletcher|2008|pp=1, 23}} and {{harvnb|Southern|2009|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis' [[Neoclassical sculpture]] offers a [[Post-mortem interval|post-mortem]] view of Cleopatra dressed in Egyptian regalia and sitting on her throne, which is decorated with two [[sphinx]] heads that represent the twins she bore with Mark Antony: Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II.{{sfnp|Smithsonian American Art Museum}} An 1880 [[commons:Category:Cleopatra by Charles Gauthier|plaster sculpture of Cleopatra committing suicide]], now found in [[Lille]], France, was once thought to be a work by [[Albert Darcq]], but a restoration and cleaning of the sculpture revealed the signature of [[Charles Gauthier]], to whom the work is now attributed.{{sfnp|The Art Tribune}} The 1874 painting ''Death of Cleopatra'' by [[Jean-André Rixens]] depicts a dead Cleopatra with very light skin, accompanied by [[Handmaiden|maidservants]] with rather dark skin, a combination frequently found in modern artworks portraying the scene of Cleopatra's death.{{sfnp|Manninen|2015|p=221, footnote 11}} [[Orientalist painting]]s by Rixens and others influenced the hybrid Ancient-Egyptian and Middle-Eastern decor found in the [[J. Gordon Edwards]]' film ''Cleopatra'' starring Bara, seen standing on a [[Persian carpet]] but with [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian wall paintings]] in the background.{{sfnp|Sully|2010|p=53}}

'''Decimation''' ({{lang-la|decimatio}}; ''decem'' = "[[10 (number)|ten]]") was a form of  military [[discipline]] used by senior commanders in the [[Roman Army]] to punish units or large groups guilty of capital offences, such as [[mutiny]] or [[desertion]]. The word ''decimation'' is derived from [[Latin]] meaning "removal of a tenth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/decimate |title=decimate. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000 |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The procedure was a pragmatic attempt to balance the need to punish serious offences with the realities of managing a large group of offenders.&lt;ref name="Polybius"/&gt;

A [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]] (roughly 480 soldiers) selected for punishment by decimation was divided into groups of ten. Each group drew lots ([[sortition]]), and the soldier on whom the lot fell was executed by his nine comrades, often by [[stoning]] or [[blunt trauma|clubbing]]. The remaining soldiers were often given rations of [[barley]] instead of [[wheat]] (the latter being the standard soldier's diet) for a few days, and required to bivouac outside the fortified security of the camp.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Watson, ''The Roman Soldier'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1969), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

As the punishment fell by lot, all soldiers in a group sentenced to decimation were potentially liable for execution, regardless of individual degrees of fault, rank, or distinction.

==Usage==
The earliest documented decimation occurred in 471 BC during the [[Roman Republic]]'s early wars against the [[Volsci]] and is recorded by [[Livy]]. In an incident where his army had been scattered, consul [[Appius Claudius Sabinus Regillensis (consul 471 BC)|Appius Claudius Sabinus Regillensis]] had the culprits punished for desertion: centurions, standard-bearers and soldiers who had cast away their weapons were individually [[scourged]] and beheaded, while of the remainder, one in ten were chosen by lot and executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0160%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D59 Titus Livius, ''Ab Urbe Condita'', book 2, chapter 59]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polybius]] gives one of the first descriptions of the practice in the early 3rd century BC:
:If ever these same things happen to occur among a large group of men... the officers reject the idea of bludgeoning or slaughtering all the men involved [as is the case with a small group or an individual]. Instead they find a solution for the situation which chooses by a lottery system sometimes five, sometimes eight, sometimes twenty of these men, always calculating the number in this group with reference to the whole unit of offenders so that this group forms one-tenth of all those guilty of cowardice. And these men who are chosen by lot are bludgeoned mercilessly in the manner described above.&lt;ref name="Polybius"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0233%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D38 Polybius, ''Histories'', book 6, chapter 38]&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice was revived by [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] in 71 BC during the [[Third Servile War]] against [[Spartacus]], and some historical sources attribute part of Crassus' success to it. The number of men killed through decimation is not known, but it varies between 1,000 (used on 10,000 men), or a cohort of around 480-500 men, meaning that 48-50 were killed.

[[Julius Caesar]] threatened to decimate the [[Legio IX Hispana|9th Legion]] during the war against [[Pompey]], but never did.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''Caesar: Life of a Colossus'', 407&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] describes the process in his work ''Life of [[Mark Antony|Antony]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/antony.html Plutarch's ''Parallel Lives'': "Antony" ~ Internet Classics Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;  After a [[Antony's Parthian War|defeat in Media]]:
:Antony was furious and employed the punishment known as 'decimation' on those who had lost their nerve. What he did was divide the whole lot of them into groups of ten, and then he killed one from each group, who was chosen by lot; the rest, on his orders were given barley rations instead of wheat.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch: ''Antony'', c. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Decimation was still being practised during the time of the [[Roman Empire]], although it was very uncommon. [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]] records that it was used by Emperor [[Augustus]] in 17 BC&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'', 24&lt;/ref&gt; and later by Galba,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Galba'', 12&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Annals (Tacitus)|Tacitus]] records that Lucius Apronius used decimation to punish a full cohort of the [[Legio III Augusta|III Augusta]] after their defeat by [[Tacfarinas]] in AD 20.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; G.R. Watson notes that "its appeal was to those obsessed with "''nimio amore antiqui moris''" – that is, an excessive love for ancient customs – and notes, "Decimation itself, however, was ultimately doomed, for though the army might be prepared to assist in the execution of innocent slaves, professional soldiers could hardly be expected to cooperate in the indiscriminate execution of their own comrades."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, ''Roman Soldier'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor [[Macrinus]] instituted a less harsh ''[[wiktionary:centesimatio|centesimatio]]'', the execution of every 100th man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/489014421|title=Constantine : Roman Emperor, Christian Victor|last=Paul,|first=Stephenson,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781590203248|edition= First |location=New York|pages=68|oclc=489014421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, the [[Theban Legion]], led by [[Saint Maurice]], was decimated in the third century AD.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Parisiensis'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]], 9550, reproduced in Louis Dupraz, ''Les passions de st Maurice d'Agaune: Essai sur l'historicité de la tradition et contribution à l'étude de l'armée pré-Dioclétienne (260-286) et des canonisations tardives de la fin du IVe siècle'' (Fribourg 1961), Appdx I. on the historicity of the Theban Legion.&lt;/ref&gt; The Legion had refused, to a man, to accede to an order of the Emperor, and the process was repeated until none were left. They became known as the Martyrs of Agaunum.

The [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] [[Maurice (emperor)|Emperor Maurice]] forbade in his [[Strategikon of Maurice|Strategikon]] the ''decimatio'' and other brutal punishments. According to him, punishments where the rank and file see their comrades dying by the hands of their own brothers-in-arms could lead to a collapse of morale. Moreover, it could seriously deplete the manpower of the fighting unit.

==Post-classical instances==
During the [[Battle of Breitenfeld (1642)]], near [[Leipzig]], one of the many battles of the [[Thirty Years' War]], Colonel Madlon's cavalry regiment was the first that fled without striking a blow. This was followed by the massive flight of other cavalry units, which was the final turning point in the battle. The battle was a decisive victory for the Swedish army under the command of Field Marshal [[Lennart Torstenson]] over an [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire]] under the command of [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]] and his deputy, Prince-General [[Ottavio Piccolomini]], Duke of Amalfi. Archduke Leopold Wilhelm assembled a court-martial in [[Prague]] which sentenced the Madlon regiment to exemplary punishment. Six regiments, which had distinguished themselves in the battle, were assembled fully armed, and surrounded Madlon's regiment, which was severely rebuked for its cowardice and misconduct, and ordered to lay down its arms at the feet of General Piccolomini. When they had obeyed this command, their ensigns (flags) were torn in pieces; and the general, having mentioned the causes of their degradation, and erased the regiment from the register of the imperial troops, pronounced the sentence that had been agreed upon in the council of war, condemning the colonel, captains and lieutenants to be beheaded, the ensigns (junior officers) to be hanged, the soldiers to be decimated and the survivors to be driven in disgrace out of the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Compiled from Original Writers.|title=The Modern Part of an Universal History: From the Earliest Account of Time.|date=1761|location=London|page=260|edition= VOL. XXX.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety men (chosen by rolling dice) were executed at [[Rokycany]], in western [[Bohemia]], now in the [[Czech Republic]], on December 14, 1642 by Jan Mydlář (junior), the son of [[Jan Mydlář]], the famous executioner from Prague. On the first day of the execution, the regiment's cords{{clarify|date=June 2016}} were broken by the executioner. On the second day, officers were beheaded and selected men hanged on the trees on the road from Rokycany to Litohlavy. Another version says that the soldiers were shot, and their bodies hanged on the trees. Their mass grave is said to be on the Black Mound in Rokycany, which commemorates the decimation to this day.

On Sept 3, 1866, during the [[Battle of Curuzu]], during the [[Paraguayan War]], the Paraguayan 10th Battalion fled without firing a shot. [[Francisco Solano López|President Lopez]] ordered the decimation of the battalion, which was accordingly formed into line and every tenth man shot.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, G, 1869, The War in Paraguay, London: Longmans Green and Co., pp.171-172&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, in France, there was a case in which a company of Tunisian [[tirailleurs]] (colonial soldiers) refused an order to attack and was ordered decimated by the divisional commander. This involved the execution of ten men.&lt;ref&gt;P. 35, Race and War in France, Richard Fogarty, 2008 Johns Hopkins Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian General [[Luigi Cadorna]] allegedly applied decimation to underperforming units during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Huw Strachan (2003) ''The First World War''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the military historian John Keegan records that his "judicial savagery" during the [[Battle of Caporetto]] took the form of the summary executions of individual stragglers rather than the formalized winnowing of entire detachments.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John. The First World War. pp. 375–376. {{ISBN|0 09 1801788}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly one specific instance of actual decimation did occur in the Italian Army during the war, on 26 May 1916. This involved the execution of one in ten soldiers of a 120 strong company of the 141st Catanzaro Infantry Brigade, which had mutinied. Officers, carabinieri and non-mutinying soldiers had been killed during the outbreak.

During the suppression of the [[German Revolution]] 29 men from the [[Volksmarinedivision]] were murdered after 300 men turned up to receive their discharge papers and back pay.

In the [[Russian Civil War]], [[Leon Trotsky]] as leader of the Red Army ordered decimation for deserters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robert |first1=Service |title=Trotsky: A Biography |page=233 |url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=mbD8jRUdAjsC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=trotsky+decimation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c5Vq5VWg9L&amp;sig=Eq2pzYZCU5OvMyN8XCX5ATXtVYk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;hl=zh-CN&amp;sourceid=cndr#v=onepage&amp;q=trotsky%20decimation&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], [[Second World War]], Soviet Army officers used decimation as a punishment for soldiers who retreated while still carrying weapons and ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0140249850|publisher=Viking|year=1998|title=Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege 1942-43|pages=117|author=[[Antony Beevor]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decimation can be also used to punish the enemy. In 1918, in the [[Finnish Civil War]], the [[White Guard (Finland)|White]] troops, after conquering the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red]] city of [[Varkaus]], [[summary execution|summarily executed]] around 80 captured Reds in what became known as the [[Lottery of Huruslahti]]. According to some accounts, the Whites ordered all the captured Reds to assemble in a single row on the ice of Lake Huruslahti, selected every tenth prisoner, and executed him on the spot. The selection was not entirely random though, as some prisoners (primarily Red leaders) were specifically selected for execution and some other individuals  were intentionally spared.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.varkaus.fi/Varkaus_1918/flash.html {{Dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current usage of the word==
The word ''decimation'' in English is often used to refer to an extreme reduction in the number of a population or force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/decimate |title=Decimate |last=Fogarty |first=Mignon |date=2012-07-12 |website=QuickandDirtyTips.com |access-date=2017-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Florence Deshon''' (July 19, 1893{{spaced ndash}}February 4, 1922) was an [[United States|American]] motion picture [[actress]] in [[silent films]]. Born in [[Tacoma, Washington]], Deshon began her film career in 1915, appearing in ''[[The Beloved Vagabond (1915 film)|The Beloved Vagabond]]'', and would later star in numerous pictures for [[Samuel Goldwyn]] and [[Vitagraph Studios]] between 1918 and 1921. She was romantically involved with writer [[Max Eastman]] and actor [[Charlie Chaplin]]. She died of gas asphyxiation in her New York City apartment.

==Early life==
Deshon was born Florence Danks in [[Tacoma, Washington]] to Samuel Danks, a musician and union organizer from [[Wales]], and Flora Caroline Spatzer, a pianist of [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] descent.{{sfn|Warren|2011|p=163}}&lt;ref name=irmscher&gt;{{cite book|title=Max Eastman: A Life|author=Irmscher, Christoph|pages=122–2|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0-300-22256-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived with her parents and older brother, Walter, in Washington until around 1900, when the family moved to New York City, where her parents pursued musical careers.

In 1913, she became acquainted with [[Max Eastman]] in [[Greenwich Village]], and the two became romantically involved.{{sfn|Warren|2011|pages=163–4}}

==Career==
Deshon appeared in more than twenty movies beginning in 1915 with ''[[The Beloved Vagabond (1915 film)|The Beloved Vagabond]]''. In 1919, while living in New York City, she was summoned by [[Samuel Goldwyn]] to [[Los Angeles, California]], and offered her work in his studio.{{sfn|Warren|2011|p=164}}

Florence played in features for [[Vitagraph Studios|Vitagraph]] until 1921. Her final film credit was in the role of ''Sally McTurk'' in ''The Roof Tree'', directed by [[John Francis Dillon (director)|John Francis Dillon]]. She returned to New York City with her mother in December 1921. Deshon hoped to continue her work in films there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0221204 IMDB entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In addition to her relationship with Max Eastman, Deshon had a purported romantic relationship with [[Charlie Chaplin]] while living in Los Angeles, and purportedly "commuted from coast to coast" between the two men.{{sfn|Weztsteon|2007|p=65}}

==Death==
On February 4, 1922, Deshon was found unconscious on the third floor of her apartment building at 120 West Eleventh Street. A window was open in her bedroom but [[illuminating gas]] flowed from an opened jet. A newspaperwoman, Minnie Morris, found Deshon when she returned to the building. An ambulance took Deshon to [[Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center|St. Vincent's Hospital]], but attempts to revive her were unsuccessful. She died the following afternoon. She was 28 years old. Deshon's apartment had been subleased from [[Doris Stevens]], who was married to [[Dudley Field Malone]]. The couple were honeymooning in Europe at the time of the actress' death. Deshon was listed as being a resident of both [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] and Los Angeles. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}} She died 5 days after [[William Desmond Taylor]], who overshadowed her.

The New York Medical Examiner concluded Deshon's death was accidental. However, rumors persisted among her circle of friends and acquaintances that she might have committed suicide, and several biographers, including Ross Wetzsteon{{sfn|Wetzsteon|2007|p=65}} and  Christoph Irmscher,&lt;ref name=irmscher/&gt; have described her death as such. An unsubstantiated comment from a neighbour had it that she had recently argued with a person who came to her apartment. Having recently broken off their relationship, Eastman claimed that Deshon had no reason to kill herself and that her death was accidental but other mutual friends believed that she did indeed commit suicide. Eastman came across her on the street on the afternoon before her death when they spoke briefly before going their separate ways. That evening, Eastman heard that she had been rushed to hospital whilst he was watching a theatre performance. He went to St. Vincent's and gave blood but the attempt to revive Deshon was futile.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7734">The '''free will theorem''' of [[John Horton Conway|John H. Conway]] and [[Simon B. Kochen]] states that if we have a [[free will]] in the sense that our choices are not a function of the past, then, subject to certain assumptions, so must some [[elementary particles]]. Conway and Kochen's paper was published in ''[[Foundations of Physics]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Conway | first = John |author2=Simon Kochen | year = 2006 | title = The Free Will Theorem | journal = Foundations of Physics | volume = 36 | issue = 10 | pages = 1441 | doi = 10.1007/s10701-006-9068-6 |arxiv = quant-ph/0604079 |bibcode = 2006FoPh...36.1441C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 they published a stronger version of the theorem in the [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society|Notices of the AMS]].&lt;ref name=Later&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Conway, John H. |author2=Simon Kochen |title=The strong free will theorem |journal= Notices of the AMS |volume=56 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=226–232 |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200902/rtx090200226p.pdf?q=will&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=k71jU8X7DoypyASw9YGoCA&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAB&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7L-k87yWE32ru0rDjkLOdg12LRQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Simon  elaborated some details.&lt;ref&gt;Kochen S., (2017), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00868''Born's Rule, EPR, and the Free Will Theorem'' ] [[arxiv]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Axioms==
The proof of the theorem as originally formulated relies on three axioms, which Conway and Kochen call "fin", "spin", and "twin". The spin and twin axioms can be verified experimentally.
# Fin: There is a maximal [[speed]] for propagation of [[information]] (not necessarily the [[speed of light]]). This assumption rests upon [[causality]].
# Spin: The squared [[spin (physics)|spin]] component of certain elementary particles of spin one, taken in three orthogonal directions, will be a permutation of (1,1,0).
# Twin: It is possible to "entangle" two elementary particles and separate them by a significant distance, so that they have the same squared spin results if measured in parallel directions.  This is a consequence of [[quantum entanglement]], but full entanglement is not necessary for the ''twin'' axiom to hold (entanglement is sufficient but not necessary).

In their later paper, "The Strong Free Will Theorem",&lt;ref name=Later/&gt; Conway and Kochen replace the Fin axiom by a weaker one called Min, thereby strengthening the theorem. Min asserts only that two experimenters separated in a [[Spacetime#Space-like interval|space-like]] way can make choices of measurements independently of each other. In particular it is not postulated that the speed of transfer of ''all'' information is subject to a maximum limit, but only of the particular information about choices of measurements.

== The theorem ==
The free will theorem states:
 
{{quotation|Given the axioms, if the two experimenters in question are free to make choices about what measurements to take, then the results of the measurements cannot be determined by anything previous to the experiments.}} That is an "outcome open" theorem.

{{quotation|If the outcome of an experiment was open, then one or two of the experimenters might have acted under free will.}}

Since the theorem applies to any arbitrary physical theory consistent with the axioms, it would not even be possible to place the information into the universe's past in an ad hoc way. The argument proceeds from the [[Kochen–Specker theorem]], which shows that the result of any individual measurement of spin was not fixed independently of the choice of measurements. As stated by Cator and Landsman regarding [[Hidden-variable theory|hidden-variable theories]]:&lt;ref name=Cator&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cator, Eric |author2=Klaas Landsman |title=Constraints on determinism: Bell versus Conway–Kochen |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=44 |issue=7 |year=2014 |pages=781–791 |doi=10.1007/s10701-014-9815-z|arxiv = 1402.1972 |bibcode = 2014FoPh...44..781C }}&lt;/ref&gt; "There has been a similar tension between the idea that the hidden variables (in the pertinent causal past) should on the one hand include all ontological information relevant to the experiment, but on the other hand should leave the experimenters free to choose any settings they like."

==Reception==

According to Cator and Landsman&lt;ref name=Cator/&gt;, Conway and Kochen prove that "determinism is incompatible with a number of ''a priori'' desirable assumptions". Cator and Landsman compare the Min assumption to the locality assumption in [[Bell's theorem]] and conclude in the strong free will theorem's favor that it "uses fewer assumptions than Bell’s 1964 theorem, as no appeal to probability theory is made". The philosopher David Hodgson supports this theorem as showing quite conclusively that "science does not support determinism": that quantum mechanics proves that particles do indeed behave in a way that is not a function of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David Hodgson |title=Rationality + Consciousness = Free Will |chapter=Chapter 7: Science and determinism |isbn=9780199845309 |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4SGsmowYARsC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=%22Conway+and+Kochen+call+the+free+will+theorem%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UiMYVeTBII3woATFkoKAAQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Conway%20and%20Kochen%20call%20the%20free%20will%20theorem%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics argue that the theorem applies only to deterministic models.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Goldstein, Daniel V.

'''Horace Sunderlin Eldredge''' (February 6, 1816 – September 6, 1888) was an early leader and member of the [[Seventy (LDS Church)#Early Latter Day Saint quorums of seventy|First Seven Presidents of the Seventy]] in the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]].

Eldredge was born in [[Brutus, New York]].  In the summer of 1836 he was [[Baptism|baptized]] and then married Betsey Ann Chase in the summer of 1837 in Buffalo, New York. Weeks after purchasing a farm in [[Far West, Missouri]], he was expelled along with the rest of the [[Latter Day Saints]] by [[Missouri Executive Order 44]].&lt;ref name=Grampa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gapages.com/eldrehs1.htm |title=Horace S. (Sunderlin) Eldredge |accessdate=2008-04-06 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Grampa Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[death of Joseph Smith]], Eldredge followed [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] to what became the [[Utah Territory]], where he was appointed marshal of the Territory, assessor and collector of taxes and a brigadier-general of the militia. On October 7, 1854, he was appointed one of the Presidents of the Seventy, a position he held until his death. In 1856 and 1862 he served in the [[Utah Territorial Legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/horace-sunderlin-eldredge Joseph Smith Paper's project bio of Eldredge]&lt;/ref&gt; He was superintendent of [[ZCMI]] for several years before his death. Eldredge practiced [[plural marriage]] and fathered 28 children. He died in [[Salt Lake City]] of lung trouble.&lt;ref name=Grampa/&gt;

'''James Ireland Craig''' {{postnominals|country=UK|FRSE |CBE}} (1868–1952) was a Scottish mathematician, meteorologist and creator of the [[Craig retroazimuthal projection]].

==Life==

He was born on 24 February 1868 in [[Buckhaven]] the son of Captain T M Craig, a pioneer in the development of [[Borneo]], and his wife Agnes. He was educated at [[Daniel Stewart's College]] in [[Edinburgh]], where he was school dux for 1885. He then attended [[Edinburgh University]] and then [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], graduating MA in 1892.&lt;ref name="st-and"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Craig_James.html|title=Craig_James biography|publisher=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893 he became a Master, teaching mathematics at [[Eton College]] then at [[Winchester College]] from 1895. In 1896 he moved to Egypt to work for the Egyptian government.
In 1908 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] for his contributions to cartography. His proposers were [[George Chrystal]], William J MacDonald, [[John Alison]] and [[John Brown Clark]].&lt;ref name="royalsoced"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf|date=29 June 2006|title= Former Fellows of The Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002|accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He created, in 1909, the [[Craig retroazimuthal projection]] that preserves true directions on a map to a specified location, such as [[Mecca]], which it why it is often called the Mecca projection.

He returned to Britain during the [[First World War]] and was based in [[London]] at the Ministry of Food. In the aftermath of the war he was creator Food Controller 1918-20 for [[Upper Silesia]] (now SW [[Poland]]). In 1925 he returned to Egypt as Controller General, then, from 1928 to 1934, was Financial Secretary to the Egyptian Census. In 1934 (aged already 66) he was made UK Government Commissioner of Customs. He finally retired from employment in 1947, aged 79. He still spent much of his time in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Mathematical Notes: obituary by H J L Robbie&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services in Egypt.

He was killed aged 83 in a deliberate fire at the Turf Club in [[Cairo]], set by rioters on 26&amp;nbsp;January 1952 during the [[Cairo Fire]].&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Y. Reynolds, ''A City Consumed: Urban Commerce, the Cairo Fire, and the Politics of Decolonization in Egypt'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2012), pp.&amp;nbsp;189-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

In 1897 he married Isabella Wilson (died 1948).

==Biography==
Rhoades graduated from [[East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania]] in 1963 with a bachelor's degree in education and was a member of [[Sigma Pi]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|date=Spring 1981|volume=69|number=1|magazine=The Emerald of Sigma Pi|title=Alumni Notes|page=4|url=http://www.enivation.com/SigmaPi/archive/Emerald/1981/SP_EMERALD_VOL_69_NO_1_SPRING_1981.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He later earned a master's degree in education from [[Lehigh University]] in 1966. After graduation, Rhoades started as a teacher and football coach at the [[Pottsville Area School District|Pottsville]] and [[Mahanoy Area School District|Mahanoy City High School]].

After seven years of teaching, Rhoades was appointed as the principal of the [[Mahanoy Area School District|Mahanoy Area Middle School]]. He served as principal for ten years before his election to the State Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Rhoades Profile |work=enatorRhoades.com |publisher=Pennsylvania Senate Republican Caucus |year=2008 |url=http://www.senatorrhoades.com/profile.htm |accessdate=November 15, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cMGkMCRI?url=http://www.senatorrhoades.com/profile.htm |archivedate=November 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhoades died in the hospital on October 18, 2008, a day after being injured in an automobile accident near [[Brodheadsville, Pennsylvania]], in Monroe County. He had been en route to a Pleasant Valley High School football game. His wife, Mary, was also injured in the crash.

Rhoades was defeated for a seat in the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=Report&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile Page |url=http://www.pa-report.com/officials/official.cfm?officialid=1637 |accessdate=December 18, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023170603/http://www.pa-report.com/officials/official.cfm?officialid=1637 |archivedate=October 23, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1980, he won a seat in the Pennsylvania State Senate, defeating Democratic incumbent [[Joseph Gurzenda]].

As a former educator, Rhoades had an interest in education issues and ultimately became Chairman of the Senate Education Committee. As chairman of that committee, Rhoades had influence over almost all education related laws, including the Pennsylvania Safe Schools Act and the Head Start Supplemental Assistance Program.&lt;ref name=MCall&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew C.

'''Karen Ashcraft''' is a communication scholar and a current professor at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. Her area of research is in [[social justice]] and [[organizational studies]]. She looks at identity in the workplace and organizational structures. Specifically she studies issues of diversity, hybrid organizations, gender and power. Being an organizational communication scholar, she sees discourse as central to understanding our [[human condition]] as well as how communication amounts to organizing.  She examines discourse through a lens of a [[Feminism|feminist]] [[communicology]] model to look at  the critical role that communication has in one’s identity creation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Ashcraft, K. L. &amp; Mumby, D. K. (2004). Reworking Gender: A Feminist Communicology of Organization. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academia ==
She completed her dissertation and received her PhD in 1998 at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. She was an Associate Professor and taught at the [[University of Utah]]. She returned to the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] to teach in 2009 and where she remains today as a Professor. She is a feminist communication scholar who studies objects in a wider political, cultural, and economic context. Her research has primarily covered [[gender]], [[Power (philosophy)|power]], professional identity, and alternative organizational forms. With a major focus on her work on feminism in organization communication she is able to delve into areas of underrepresented gender groups.

== Research ==
The majority of Karen Ashcraft’s work takes place within professional organizations.  A frequent area in which she researches are the effects communication differences is [[gender identity]]. Her work explores communication through a critical and feminist lens. When looking in the setting of a professional organization the structure of it is significant to the way it runs and its outcomes. While Ashcraft explores issues of diversity, [[Identity (social science)|identity]], gender, power, and discourse; the organizational setting that she observes plays a pivotal role in her findings.

=== Gendered organizations ===
The [[bureaucracy]] structure has been utilized over years and at times been seen to be reasonable and helpful, but alternative structures that call on different aspects can also be helpful.  Since [[bureaucracy]] has historically been known to be an expression that favors a male ideology, feminist have been known to advocate collectivism. Traditionally bureaucracies have been  [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] in authority, having impersonal relations, and biased notions of objectivity and rationality. Through feminist organizations [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] tendencies are more sought out and collectivism displays a way to pursue empowerment by seeking to be harmonious in both private and public spheres.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Ashcraft, K. L. (2001). Organized dissonance: Feminist bureaucracy as hybrid form. Academy of Management Journal, 44, 1301-1322.&lt;/ref&gt;  Feminist Organizations are a resource that no one had truly delved into in the past. Ashcraft displays how if included within management then research can create random alliances and uncover alternative viewpoints that may counter current ideologies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; She sees feminist [[organizational communication]] theory as an extension of the larger feminist movement that can be seen independent of [[critical theory]].
 
Ashcraft examines how discursive messages constitute organizational setting’s gendered identity,  instead of reflecting it.  In this way, she discusses how [[discourse]] produces, solidifies, interrupts, and modifies gender identity. In one way, institutional discourse sides more with the individual rather than systematic tendencies. It separates women and men, it normalizes dominant groups’ discourse, and it warrants rationale for organizational control and exclusion with difference. In a different light, looking at discourse as a performance highlights the way in which Ashcraft sees discourse constituting gender. If we were to value difference then it would involve celebrating asymmetrical power relations (Ashcraft and Pakanowsky, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;Ashcraft, K. L., &amp; Pacanowksy, M. E. (1996). “A woman’s worst enemy”: Reflections on a narrative of organizational life and female identity. Journal of Applied Communication Research, 24, 1–23.&lt;/ref&gt; She advocates that the process of interaction will elicit the audience to see a new perspective. A fresh set of lenses can definitely help insiders and outsiders understand that larger context and may pair then with better understanding.
 
Karen Ashcraft, along with Dennis Mumby,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  present four frames that can be used within the [[communication]] field to analyze discourse, power, identity, and gendered organizing relationships. 
#  Ashcraft’s first frame views gender as socially constructed but as deeply rooted in [[biological sex]] and remains relatively unchanged over time. In organizational settings, power becomes relevant in how gender differences are distinguished and belittled. Frame 1 is centered on the ways in which gender identity shapes how individuals interact with each other. In this sense communication is treated as evidence or a product of gender identity. 
#  Frame 2 is Discourse (Dis)Organizes Gender, and it speaks to identity as something that is “done.” In her second frame, Ashcraft proposes that discourse and gender identity have a dialectical and interactional relationship. Our everyday performances, or micro-practices play a large role  in our interactions with others.
#  The third way that Ashcraft frames her discussion is through gendered organizations.  which speak to organizations being gendered in order to demonstrate and replicate [[patriarchy]] or the systemic privileging of [[masculinity]]. 
#  The final frame that Ashcraft uses is gendered narratives in [[popular culture]], where the focus is on communication that is “about” organizations. This would also include how a larger society, such as media,  illustrates and negotiates its establishments and the very notion of work.  These four frames situate forms differently they can also be positioned in terms of affinity and overlap.

==== Hybrid organizations ====
The feminist lens that Ashcraft uses enhances understanding of organizational hybrids.  A [[hybrid organization]] are often less ideologically pure but more receptive to practical troubles, may better assist in institutional improvements, emancipatory revisions, or resistant behaviors. A [[paradox]]ical hybrid looks at how organizational members dealt with contradicting forms in quotidian practices. Ashcraft &lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; looks at how through hybrid forms of organizing, organizations want to find and create different options than simply the bureaucratic structure. She discusses how some organizations move from a form of [[bureaucracy]] and [[hierarchy]], to one being feminist and egalitarian and how these two philosophies can cause tensions that may be hard to mediate.

The hybrid that erodes from her research she terms “organized dissonance.” The idea of this is that it interrupts the hegemonic [[generalization]]s about rationality, forms of organization, and power. Organized dissonance is a distinctive paradoxical form of hybrid that gets enlightened by feminist bureaucracy.  This term describes an efficiently united set of forms that are thought to be confrontational. In Ashcraft’s words, it is a “ strategic union of forms presumed hostile”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Organized dissonance is a class of hybrid organization; its strategic incongruity is its guiding presumption. Organizations meet commands and objectives that conflict by employing incompatible forms.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; This ultimately allows members to interact with contradicting dialect that is quite deliberate. Organized dissonance brings about tensions that are among areas of: equality/inequality, centralization/decentralization, stability/flexibility, and individual/community. By disrupting the ideal harmonious hybrid organized dissonance meets goals that are contradictory.  Ashcraft argues that the idea of cautiously pairing members with the “enemy” may be a better way to permit [[social change]].  Ashcraft &lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; argues that seeing these tensions that come out of hybrid forms of organizing is of great importance to examine.

=== Diversity ===
Ashcraft &lt;ref&gt;Ashcraft, K. L. (1999). Managing maternity leave: A qualitative analysis of temporary executive&lt;/ref&gt; discusses speaking of organizational systems and behaviors as gendered but it is also important to be thinking about [[Race (classification of humans)|race]]. Too often do we focus meticulously on gendered ways of organizing and we consistently ignore how we are essentially raced. When looking at diversity there are many misunderstandings and aspects that are left out that tie into the way we see diversity in the workplace. Ashcraft, along with Allen,&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Ashcraft, K. L. &amp; Allen, B. J. (2003). The racial foundation of organizational communication. Communication Theory, 13(1), 5-38.&lt;/ref&gt; highlight five consequences of the ways that we are inclined to express and silence race while preserving the normative power of organized Whiteness.

The first message is that “race tends to be depicted as separate, singular that is relevant only under certain circumstances”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; It is simultaneously being concealed as something that has previously been written in institutions. When we discuss race, it often seems to demonstrate an [[Racial identity|identity]] that is fixed with comparatively predictable outcomes on one’s outlook or actions. Issues of race are also usually constrained to practice and “professional” settings. She suggests that displaying race as a central element in an organization can help by incorporating issues of race within foundational texts.

The second message is that “race is relevant in so far as it involves cultural differences, which can be identified, valued, and managed to improve organizational performance” (Ashcraft &amp; Allen, 2003).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt; Here stands a desperate need for appreciation and understanding to cultural diversity, which if strategically applied can allow organizational productivity and innovation to flourish. She discusses that theorizing race could help by exposing and engaging it as a serious matter within the organization. This will allow members to better grasp how race gets organizations become raced  and how race gets organized.

The third message is that “all cultural differences are synonymous with international variations” (Ashcraft &amp; Allen, 2003).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt; As [[globalization]] rapidly spreads, organizations are expected to employ and understand differences among cultures. Another aspect is that all of the cultural differences correspond to those that are between nations. Ashcraft discusses that we can point to and expand on ranges of racial categories and [[heterogeneity]] that is encompassed within each in order to steer away from racial bifurcations. We can then propose essential possibilities to “cultural difference” race models.
 
The fourth message is that “racial discrimination is a function of personal bias, interpersonal misunderstanding, organizational failure to manage cultural differences, and disproportionate demographics” (Ashcraft &amp; Allen, 2003).&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; Discrimination comes from numerous sources including misunderstandings and management styles. It is described as being an unfortunate behavior of members inside an organization and not as a distinctive organizational creation. It is important to study experiences that comparative to workers of multiple racial groups within diverse organizational environments.

The fifth message is “white (collar) workplaces and work/ers constitute “universal” settings, identities, and practices”&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; 2003. This is to say that organizations can colonize their members in various ways, but by placing assumptions on a “universal” worker may place some members in a more favorable and appropriate place than others.  For example, when we craft our “professional” self then we must also enact “Whiteness,” because of the dilution of cultural identities and having “whiteness” as a homogeneous and invisible standard. Here Ashcraft suggests to examine the idea that we are all raced beings, including that of Whiteness.

If we look into our industry’s racial roots we will be able to have a richer understanding on how organizing is raced very deeply. When looking at race an important aspect that Ashcraft delves into is being sensitive to absence and presence. Here she looks at both why and how race draws our obvious attention and indefinite silence to certain things.  Ashcraft displays how institutional powers use both race and gender to delineate members as having less credibility or in [[Sexualization|sexualized]] ways. In this way, culture’s of organizations have an interplay with raced organizations in that it supports or contradicts social constructions of race and gender that happen at the societal level.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

It is significant for Ashcraft to study and initiate discourse over troubling questions because they are much overdue. After sparking awareness, eventually she has a vision to rebuild the racial foundation of organizational communication.

'''Lucius Banks, Jr.''' (1 May 1886 – February 1955) was an American professional rugby union player in England. Banks, who played for [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet R.L.F.C.]] in [[Hunslet]], [[Leeds]] in 1912, is thought to be the first black athlete to compete in [[Rugby League|rugby league football]]; the first American to play rugby league; and, according to the historian [[Tony Collins (historian)|Tony Collins]], "probably only the fourth black American to play professional football of any code".&lt;ref&gt;Tony Collins, '[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02619288.1998.9974933 Racial minorities in a marginalized sport: Race, discrimination and integration in British rugby league football]', ''Immigrants &amp; Minorities Historical Studies in Ethnicity, Migration and Diaspora'', 17 (1998), 151-69 (pp. 155 and 168 fn 15, quoting 168 fn 15), DOI: 10.1080/02619288.1998.9974933.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biography==
Banks was born in Virginia in either 1885 or 1886 to Lucius Banks Sr. and Julia Webb Banks.&lt;ref&gt;''Virginia, Birth Records, 1912-2014, Delayed Birth Records, 1854-1911''&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[Arlington, Massachusetts]] when he was still young.&lt;ref&gt;''1900 United States Federal Census''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to coming in the UK, Banks had served in the U.S. cavalry,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Collins, '[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02619288.1998.9974933 Racial minorities in a marginalized sport: Race, discrimination and integration in British rugby league football]', ''Immigrants &amp; Minorities Historical Studies in Ethnicity, Migration and Diaspora'', 17 (1998), 151-69 (p. 155), DOI: 10.1080/02619288.1998.9974933.&lt;/ref&gt; recorded as a private in 1910 in the ''[[Army and Navy Register]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2Uw-AQAAMAAJ&amp; Army and Navy Register]'', 48 (1910), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; He was stationed at [[West Point, New York]] from 1908–1912, where he excelled in both cricket and American football.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lucius Banks |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/433512313/?terms=Lucius+Banks |work=The Boston Globe |date=February 10, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks was spotted playing as a [[quarterback]] in New York by a one-time member of [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet R.L.F.C.'s]] management committee, and the club bought him out of the army and brought him to the UK, apparently partly because the club thought an exotic player would boost revenue. The strategy seems to have worked, as 'his presence significantly swelled the attendance at his first game'.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Collins, '[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02619288.1998.9974933 Racial minorities in a marginalized sport: Race, discrimination and integration in British rugby league football]', ''Immigrants &amp; Minorities Historical Studies in Ethnicity, Migration and Diaspora'', 17 (1998), 151-69 (p. 155), DOI: 10.1080/02619288.1998.9974933.&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks's performance seems to have been fairly successful: playing on the wing, he scored four tries during his first four games for the club, the first of which was on 27 January 1912, against [[York City Knights|York R.L.F.C.]]. He later moved to playing as {{rlp|so}}, before returning to America following his last game with the club, on 26 December 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Collins, '[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02619288.1998.9974933 Racial minorities in a marginalized sport: Race, discrimination and integration in British rugby league football]', ''Immigrants &amp; Minorities Historical Studies in Ethnicity, Migration and Diaspora'', 17 (1998), 151-69 (p. 155), DOI: 10.1080/02619288.1998.9974933.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Local news reporting on Banks's first game in England included some prominent racist coverage, with a local evening paper running the headline 'Hunslet's Coloured Coon' and the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'' suggesting that local players should have been hired instead and commenting that 'if the club wanted to sign "coloured" players they should go to South Africa, where "they are reputed to be capable goal kickers with bare feet" '.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Collins, '[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02619288.1998.9974933 Racial minorities in a marginalized sport: Race, discrimination and integration in British rugby league football]', ''Immigrants &amp; Minorities Historical Studies in Ethnicity, Migration and Diaspora'', 17 (1998), 151-69 (p. 155), DOI: 10.1080/02619288.1998.9974933.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, however, Banks has become a celebrated figure, seen as a pioneer in what has become a long history of black rugby league players.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Spracklen, ' "Black Pearl, Black Diamonds": Exploring Racial Identities in Rugby League', in ''Race, Sport and British Society'', ed. by Ben Carrington and Ian McDonald (London: Routledge, 2001), pp. 70-82 (p. 70).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Following his days in England, Banks served in the [[First World War]] and saw active service in France. In 1919, he joined the [[Boston Police Department]]&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Ryan, ''[https://archive.org/details/policerecordsjan11bost Police records]]'', 56 (1 January 1919 to 31 December 1919), p. 1645.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/NewtonGraphicJun_1932 The Newton Graphic]'' (3 June 1932), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boston (Mass.). City Council, ''[https://archive.org/details/reportsofproceed1950bost Reports of proceedings]'' (Boston: Municipal Print Office, 1950), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  and worked as a police officer for 27 years.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; He was also a member of the Prince Hall Free &amp; Accepted Masonic Lodge.  He died in 1955 (when his age was listed as 68) and was survived his wife, Maude, and son, Richard L. Banks.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

'''Matti Häyry''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈmɑtti ˈhæyry}}; born 20.9.1956) is Professor of [[Philosophy]] at [[Aalto University School of Business]] in Helsinki, Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Häyry appointed as Professor in Management and International Business - http://biz.aalto.fi/en/current/news/view/2013-06-19-002/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004-2013, he was Professor of [[Bioethics]] and [[Philosophy of Law]] at the [[University of Manchester]] in England, and before that he held professorships in philosophy and moral philosophy at the universities of Central Lancashire and Kuopio.&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who in Finland 2007. Otava (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2013}}

Häyry’s main fields of interest have been moral and political philosophy and philosophical bioethics. He studied philosophy at the [[University of Helsinki]] and started focusing on medical and healthcare ethics during his postgraduate years.&lt;ref&gt;Pekka Louhiala &amp; Svante Stenman, toim. Philosophy Meets Medicine, Helsinki University Press 2000, 149-161.&lt;/ref&gt; His practical topics in bioethics have ranged from abortion, euthanasia, and resource allocation to genetics, systems biology, and synthetic biology. Theoretically, his work has centred on the main normative doctrines of European moral and political philosophy.

Häyry is a founding member of the [[International Association of Bioethics]] and he served on its board of directors during 2001–2009, in 2007–2009 as the association’s president.

In an endeavour to express ethical ideas in an artistic format, Häyry produced in 2013 – with [[Tuija Takala]], [[Corky Laing]], and [[Lasse Väyrynen]] – a concept album on the ethics of genetics; [[Playing God – Corky Laing and the Perfct Child Perform Original Music from Test: the Rock Opera]] ([[Gonzo Multimedia]] 2013).

{{Nihongo|'''Megalon'''|メガロ|Megaro}} is a [[kaiju]] who first appeared in [[Toho]]'s 1973 film ''[[Godzilla vs. Megalon]]''.

==Overview==
Megalon is a bipedal, humanoid, [[beetle]]-like burrowing [[insect]] standing at 55 meters (180 feet) tall and weighing 40,000 metric tons (44,092 short tons), and the god of the subterranean nation of Seatopia. While Megalon is by no means intelligent, he makes up for it with his strength. Megalon possess two drill-like front appendages, which it uses both for burrowing and as weapons, and a set of wings usually covered by a [[Elytron|beetle-like shell]]. The creature can fly at speeds of up to Mach 3, burrow underground at speeds of up to Mach 2, and swim at speeds of up to Mach 4. Megalon also has a horn (similar to a [[rhinoceros beetle]]) from which it can fire [[lightning]]-like bolts of electricity, and it is capable of spitting [[napalm]] bombs from its mouth. 

In ''[[Godzilla vs. Megalon]]'', Megalon is worshipped as a [[deity]] by the people of the [[underground living|subterranean kingdom]] known as Seatopia. The Seatopians unleash Megalon on the surface world as revenge for the damage caused to Seatopia through reckless [[nuclear testing]]. During his assault on the surface world, Megalon comes into conflict with [[Godzilla]] and [[Jet Jaguar]].

A '''Missional community''' is a group of people, about the size of an extended family, who are united through [[Christian]] community around a common service and witness to a particular neighborhood or network of relationships. The Missional Community doesn't exist for anything less than making disciples of Jesus among these networks or neighborhoods. The participants of missional communities find their primary identity of “church” within the missional community, rather than a larger [[worship service]] or small group. In essence, this group of people becomes a close-knit spiritual family on mission together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missional Communities Info Sheet|url=http://somatacoma.org/mediafiles/soma-life-missional-communities.pdf|publisher=Soma Communities|accessdate=2013-01-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526221532/http://somatacoma.org/mediafiles/soma-life-missional-communities.pdf|archivedate=May 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==
Missional Communities (MCs) are designed to be a flexible, local expression of church, not dependent on typical church buildings or church services. MCs have been described as “small enough to care but large enough to dare.”&lt;ref&gt;Breen, Mike &amp; Bob Hopkins: Clusters. ACPI Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Missional Communities may be called by other names, such as Clusters, Go Communities, Incarnational Communities, or Mission Shaped Communities. MCs are primarily led by [[laity]] and are “lightweight and low maintenance”&lt;ref&gt;Breen, Mike &amp; Bob Hopkins: ''Clusters.'' ACPI Press, 2008. page 36&lt;/ref&gt; and most often meet 3-4 times a month in their missional context. Missional Communities place a strong value on life together, with the expressed intention of seeing those they impact choose to start following [[Jesus]].  With this focus, a Missional Community will often grow and multiply into other MCs. Missional Communities are most often networked within a larger [[local church|church]] community, often with many other Missional Communities.

An MC has leaders who, through a process of discernment, decide their mission vision and then invite people to join them in reaching that particular context. The leaders of the MC are held accountable by the [[leadership]] of the greater church community, both for what they do and for the way in which they do it (i.e., character as well as task). “Low control, high accountability” is one way to describe relationships between the Missional Community and the church body and leadership. Alex Absalom describes the focus of a missional community in this way:

{{Quotation|''The group balances its energies between an upward movement towards God, an inward movement toward the MC as a place of identity, and an outward movement to represent Christ to their mission context. When they gather, they express this in creative ways that are appropriate to their context. In fact, there will be great diversity between groups in how this looks, with a variety of faces and voices being given room to step forward and contribute what they can. The only ‘rule’ is that they do not try to do a miniature version of a Sunday church service.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Breen, Mike &amp; Alex Absalom: Launching Missional Communities: A Field Guide. 3DM Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

Since Missional Communities are meant to be led by [[laity]], running the community can be spread throughout the group so that it doesn't make a few leaders do all of the work. This sharing of the work is a key ingredient and one of the main benefits of these mid-sized groups. People don’t approach it as [[consumer]]s but as participants. While some MCs meet in homes, it is not uncommon for many of them to meet in the particular mission context they are reaching into. (For instance, a MC reaching out to the [[homeless]] would meet on the streets with the homeless rather than trying to bus them to another location.)

Missional Communities often have small groups within the larger body, with small-group leaders being held accountable by the Missional Community Leaders. The small groups work as places of support, challenge and closeness, as the wider MC gathering is too large for general sharing of prayer requests and the like. MCs will also gather periodically with the larger church body for what is referred to as a Celebration Service. This usually involves a time for corporate worship, teaching, stories and re-envisioning the wider community. The larger church body determines the frequency of these Celebration Services, ranging from every week to once a month. In an existing church, as opposed to a new church plant, regular Sunday services often perform this function, showcasing and celebrating what is going on across that particular church in their Missional Communities.

More often than not, when Missional Communities reach the size of 30-40 people they begin to intentionally work on starting a new MC. As before, any new MC is driven by the presence of accountable leaders who have sought God for a clear and specific mission vision. This could mean sending out two leaders to start a new community, maybe a Small Group is sent out en masse, or even half the group stays with the current MC while the other half begins a new community. However the group is multiplied, the essential element is expanding the reach of the church into a new context.

==History==
Missional Communities emerged in [[England]] in the mid 1990s, primarily through the experimenting of the church [[St. Thomas' Church, Crookes|St. Thomas’, Crookes]] in [[Sheffield]].  Although they were first experimented with in inner city [[London]] in the late 1980s, they became more fully formed when Mike Breen became the Senior Pastor of St Thomas’ [[Sheffield]] in 1994. They were described as being multiplying missionary congregations and called ‘Clusters’.  The focus of the Clusters was on a group of Christians operating as a community together in mission. Leaders were encouraged to seek God for a vision for a new expression of church and, with training and support, they could be released to gather a team and pursue that dream.

As St Thomas’ grew, many MCs were planted into the urban center of the city. The church met for Sunday celebrations in a variety of large rented facilities, ending up in a huge disused nightclub, the Roxy, where the [[Rolling Stones]] had once played. In 1998, however, with only a couple of weeks notice, the building was closed down for breaking fire code, and the church was forced to scatter into their various MC gatherings for Sunday worship. It took almost a year for a new permanent home to be found – during which time the original MCs that had been sent out had doubled in number, with many people coming to know [[Jesus]] during that year when the church had been forced to go into all the city.

Gradually the stories about MCs started spreading, both across the UK and Northern Europe and more and more churches began using this church structure. In 2004 the Anglican church released a report, “Mission-Shaped Church,” examining the viability and success of this movement within the Anglican church, including a forward by Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, Graham: ''Mission-Shaped Church: Church Planting and Fresh Expressions in Changing Contexts.'' Church House Publishing, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the European Church Planting Network picked up on this approach and hundreds upon hundreds of churches were planted as a result. Between 2006 and 2009, over 720 churches were planted across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;European Church Planting Network (ECPN) report&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time this had been done in [[Europe]]an church history.

In the mid 2000s this model of church began to spread to the United States. Early pioneers in this movement, such as Community of Joy in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], Norman Community Church in Norman, [[Oklahoma]] and Trinity Grace in [[New York City]] were some of the first American churches to embrace this structure. [[Missiology|Missiologists]] such as Eddie Gibbs at [[Fuller Seminary]] and Kent Hunter of Church Doctor Ministries began to direct both established churches and [[church planting|church planters]] to the [[UK]] to see these decentralized and reproducible Missional Communities.

[[Mike Breen (pastor)|Mike Breen]], the former Senior Pastor of St. Thomas’ Sheffield who originated Missional Communities, moved to [[Pawleys Island, South Carolina]] and in 2008 began 3DM, a coaching entity that comes alongside churches of varying sizes to help them transition to this missional/discipleship model. With the emergence of 3DM within the United States, there was increased interest in these mid-sized communities. In November 2010, Mike Breen and Alex Absalom published a book entitled ''Launching Missional Communities - A Field Guide,''&lt;ref&gt;3DM website&lt;/ref&gt; where they related their experience with and approach to Missional Communities. In 2011, Reggie McNeal, a best selling Christian author, released a book detailing the world-wide rise of Missional Communities entitled, "Missional Communities: The rise of the Post-Congregational Church." &lt;ref&gt;McNeal, Reggie: ''Missional Communities: The Rise of the Post-Congregational Church.'' Jonesy-Bass Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The local churches choosing to make this transition vary largely in church [[Christian denomination|denomination]], but the largest percentage currently involved with this movement in the United States are [[Baptists]], [[Lutherans]], [[Assembly of God]], [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarene]], [[Presbyterians]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] and non-denominational churches.&lt;ref&gt;History provided by personal interviews with Mike &amp; Sally Breen, Alex Absalom, Bob &amp; Mary Hopkins, Steve Cockram and Jo Saxton&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly speaking, even the term Missional Community is seeping into the consciousness of the evangelical world of the United States as the first large-scale conference was held about MCs. Verge: Missional Community Conference happened in [[Austin]], [[Texas]] on February 4–6, 2010 and sold out weeks before the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verge2010.org |title=Verge Network |publisher=Verge2010.org |date= |accessdate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Verge united with Exponential, the largest conference for church planters, where the theme was, “Missional Communities: Discovering Old Truths in New Paradigms.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exponentialconference.com |title=Orlando, FL |publisher=Exponential Conference |date= |accessdate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the emergence of Missional Communities continued its prominent place at the Verge Conference, as well as seeing an expanded Missional track at the Exponential Conference and the Sync Conference at Charleston Southern University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csuniv.edu/ministries/sync.asp |title=Campus Ministries |publisher=Csuniv.edu |date= |accessdate=March 17, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network and accountability==
If MCs are “low control/high accountability,” having a church structure that invests in lay leaders and empowers them while holding them accountable is of paramount importance. Perhaps the most widely used vehicle for this are called [[Discipleship Huddles]], which is a group of 4-10 leaders. The frequency of these groups differs based on each individual church, but generally speaking they meet at least once a month and as often as once a week. Huddles are a place where leaders are actively being discipled in a community of peers, where they are held accountable for the leadership of their groups by their Huddle leader. The two central questions of a Huddle are: 1) What is [[God in Christianity|God]] saying to you? 2) What are you going to do about it?&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; By seeing that leaders follow through on the plans they form from answering both of these questions, a culture is developed of both high support and high challenge. Over a period of time, this allows leaders to cultivate and sustain the character, skills and spiritual depth needed to lead.

As churches with Missional Communities tend to be far more decentralized than most Western churches, the network of these Huddles are essential to the unity and direction of the wider church. Usually the Senior [[Pastor]] will Huddle 4-10 leaders, these leaders will in turn Huddle 4-10 leaders, who in turn Huddle the leaders they are responsible for. As the church grows, multiplying Missional Communities and Small Groups, more Huddles are added as necessary. What most churches have found helpful is an agreed upon [[DNA]] in the [[language]] that all leaders use that filter down to their various groups. Most often this is the language of LifeShapes, a set of 8 Shapes that distill the teachings and principles of the [[Bible]] and [[Jesus]], that were fashioned by Mike Breen as Missional Communities first developed and captured in his book “Building a Discipling Culture.”&lt;ref&gt;Breen, Mike &amp; Steve Cockram: ''Building a Discipling Culture.'' 3DM Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A typical gathering==
There is tremendous flexibility in the forms of Missional Communities, since the intention is that they are highly accessible to the culture into which they are planted. They are anchored around the three core relationships of life – UP to God, IN to family and friends, and OUT to the wider society which they seek to be a blessing to.
In practice MCs do tend to certain things pretty regularly, albeit in slightly different ways according to their context, including:
* [[Food]] - ideally sharing a meal together
* Socializing/ laughing/ having fun
* Breaking Bread/ sharing [[Eucharist|Communion]]
* [[Storytelling|Story-telling]] (i.e. testimony), especially of things people are grateful to God for
* Bringing praise and worship to God
* Offering [[prayer]] for healing and prophetic encouragement to anyone who has particular need
* Studying the Scriptures together, especially from what God has been speaking to the leader (or whoever is leading that portion) about during the past week.
* Praying for the wider community that you are seeking to reach, as well as for the MCs witness there
* Planning practicalities for mission activities

In addition to providing this list, Alex Absalom comments, “We would summarize this as a 1 Corinthians 11-14 model, which seems the fullest unpacking of how a church oikos [extended household] would meet and express its life together. From what Paul writes, it is also clear that those gatherings were led in such a way that people who weren’t yet Christians could come in and be welcomed, without it throwing all the plans into confusion.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

As well, a Missional Community will go OUT together in specific missional activities, to serve and witness to their place of calling. Such events need to be regular and rhythmic, so that the group sees this as an integral part of their life together. It should be no more a ‘special’ than meeting to eat together or pray together is.

==Structure==
Proteins of the NCS2 family are 414–650 amino acyl residues in length and probably possess 14 TMSs. Lu et al. (2011) have concluded from x-ray crystallography that UraA ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.40.1.1 2.A.40.1.1]) has 14 TMSs with two 7 TMS inverted repeats.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu F, Li S, Jiang Y, Jiang J, Fan H, Lu G, Deng D, Dang S, Zhang X, Wang J, Yan N | title = Structure and mechanism of the uracil transporter UraA | journal = Nature | volume = 472 | issue = 7342 | pages = 243–6 | date = Apr 2011 | pmid = 21423164 | doi = 10.1038/nature09885 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Uracil is located at the interface between the two domains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Transport reaction==
The generalized transport reactions catalyzed by proteins of the NAT/NCS2 family are:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

:Nucleobase (out) H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Nucleobase (in) H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

:Ascorbate (out) Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Ascorbate (in) Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

==Characterized proteins==
Several proteins make up the NCS2/NAT family. A full list of these proteins can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.40.7 Transporter Classification Database]. 
A few types of proteins that make up the NCS2/NAT family include:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11254">'''Parentification''' is the process of role reversal whereby a child is obliged to act as parent to their ''own'' parent. In extreme cases, the child is used to fill the void of the [[Parental Alienation|alienating parent]]'s emotional life.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Gardner et al., ''The International Handbook of Parental Alienation Syndrome'' (2006) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Two distinct modes of parentification have been identified technically: instrumental parentification and emotional parentification. Instrumental parentification involves the child completing physical tasks for the family, such as looking after a sick relative, paying bills, or providing assistance to younger siblings that would normally be provided by a parent. Emotional parentification occurs when a child or adolescent must take on the role of a confidant or mediator for (or between) parents or family members.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory J. Jurkovic, 'Destructive Parentification in Families' in Luciano L'Abate ed., ''Family Psychopathology'' (New York 1998) pp. 237–255&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prehistory==
[[Melitta Schmideberg]] noted in 1948 how emotional deprivation could lead parents to treat their children (unconsciously) as substitute parent figures.&lt;ref&gt;Jurkovic, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; "Spousification" and "parental child" ([[Minuchin]]) offered alternative concepts exploring the same phenomenon; while the theme of intergenerational continuity in such violations of [[personal boundaries]] was further examined.&lt;ref&gt;Jurkovic, in L'Abate ed., p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eric Berne]] touched on the dangers of parents and children having a symmetrical, rather than asymmetrical relationship, as when an absent spouse is replaced by the eldest child;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (Penguin 1970) p. 249–53&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Virginia Satir]] wrote of "the role-function discrepancy...where the son gets into a head-of-the-family role, commonly that of the father".&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Satir, ''Peoplemaking'' (1983) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Object relations theory]] highlighted how the child's [[True self and false self|false self]] is called into being when it is forced prematurely to take excessive care of the parental object;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (1994) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Bowlby]] looked at what he called "compulsive caregiving" among the anxiously [[Attachment theory|attached]], as a result of a parent inverting the normal relationship and pressuring the child to be an attachment figure for them.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowlby, ''The Making and Breaking of Affectional Bonds'' (London 1979) p. 137–38&lt;/ref&gt;

All such aspects of disturbed and inverted parenting patterns have been drawn under the umbrella of the wider phenomenon of parentification – with the result (critics suggest) that on occasion "ironically the concept of parentification has...been as over-burdened as the child it often describes".&lt;ref&gt;Karpel, quoted by Jurkovic, in L'Abate ed., p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choice of child==
For practical reasons, elder children are generally chosen for the familial "parental" role – very often  the first-born children who were put in the anomalous role.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Satir, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; However, gender considerations mean that sometimes the eldest boy or eldest girl was selected, even if they are not the oldest child overall, for such reasons as the preference to match the sex of the missing parent.

Thus where there is a disabled child in the family to be cared for, "older siblings, especially girls, are at the greatest risk of parentification";&lt;ref&gt;Bryna Siegal, ''What about Me'' (2002) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; where a father-figure is missing, it may be the eldest son who is forced to take on his father's responsibilities, without ever obtaining the autonomy that normally accompanies such adult roles.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Tennessee Williams's The Glass Menagerie'' (2007) p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively a widower may put a daughter into the social and emotional role of his deceased wife – "spousification"; or a mother can oblige her daughter to play the caring role, in a betrayal of the child's normal expectation of love and care.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Brandt, ''Wild Mother Dancing'' (1993) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narcissistic==
[[Narcissistic]] parentification occurs when a child is forced to take on the parent's idealised [[Psychological projection|projection]], something which encourages a compulsive [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]] in the child at the expense of their natural development.&lt;ref&gt;Jurkovic, in  L'Abate, ed., p. 246-7&lt;/ref&gt; In a kind of pseudo-identification, the child is induced by any and all means to take on the characteristics of the parental [[ego ideal]]&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of the Neuroses'' (London 1946) p. 510-11&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; a pattern that has been detected in [[Western world|western]] culture since [[Homer]]'s description of the character of [[Achilles]].&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Holway, ''Becoming Achilles'' (2011) Chapter Five 'Fathers and Sons'; and notes p. 218–19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages and advantages==
The almost inevitable byproduct of parentification is losing one's own childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Siegal, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; In destructive parentification, the child in question takes on excessive responsibility in the family, without their caretaking being acknowledged and supported by others:&lt;ref&gt;Jurkovic, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; by adopting the role of parental care-giver, the child loses their real place in the family unit and is left lonely and unsure.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In extreme instances, there may be what has been called a kind of disembodiment, a [[narcissistic wound]] that threatens one's basic self-identity.&lt;ref&gt;Paula M. Reeves, in Nancy D. Chase, ''Burdened Children'' (1999) p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life, parentified children often  experience  anxiety  over  abandonment  and  loss,  and demonstrate  difficulty  handling  rejection  and  disappointment  within  interpersonal  relationships. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Petracca |last2=J. |first2=Rabinowitz |title=A    retrospective study of daughters’ emotional role reversal  with parents, attachment anxiety, excessive reassurance seeking, and depressive symptoms. |journal=The American Journal of Family Therapy |date=2009 |volume=37 |page=185-195 |doi=10.1080/01926180802405596 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all results of parentification may be negative. Some studies have hypothesized that when a child is the subject of parentification, it might sometimes result in the child, later in life, having greater [[psychological resilience]], more [[individuation]], a clearer sense of self, and more secure attachment styles during adulthood. These characteristics may be because the person had to adapt to changes and take on responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, L. M., Marotta, S. A., &amp; Lanthier, R. P. (2008). Predictors of growth and distress following childhood parentification: A retrospective exploratory study. ''Journal of Child and Family Studies, 17(5)'', 693-705. {{doi|10.1007/s10826-007-9184-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosscultural studies also point to the widespread nature of the practice of parentification, and indicate that normal as well as pathological aspects of parentification need to be taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy D. Shape, ''Burdened Children'' (1999) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==
* [[Carl Jung]] in his late autobiography reports that his mother always spoke to him as an adult, confiding in him what she could not share with her husband.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'' (London 1983) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurens van der Post]] commented on the grown-up atmosphere surrounding the young Jung, and considered that "this activation of the pattern of the "old man" within himself...was all a consequence of the extent to which his father and mother failed each other".&lt;ref&gt;Laurens van der Post, ''Jung and the Story of Our Times'' (Penguin 1978) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Patrick Casement]] reports on a patient – Mr T – whose mother was distressed at any and all his feelings, and who therefore protected her from them – mothering ''her'' himself.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickens Blog.]&lt;/ref&gt; Agnes is forced to be the parent of her alcoholic father and seems to strive for perfection as a means of reaching the "ego ideal" of her deceased mother (who died upon child-birth). Agnes marries late, has relationship and intimacy problems (she has a hard time expressing her love for David until he reveals his own love for her), and has some self-defeating attitudes; in one scene she blames her own father's misfortunes on herself. However, she proves to be resilient, resourceful, responsible and even potentially career-driven (she forms her own school). She also manages to marry the protagonist David and the two live happily together for 10 years with children by the end of the novel.

{{About|a hypothesis that vehicle use in some developed countries has peaked and will decline|times when traffic is heavy|rush hour}}
'''Peak car''' (also '''peak car use''' or '''peak travel''') is a [[hypothesis]] that [[motor vehicle]] distance traveled [[per capita]], predominantly by [[private transport|private]] [[automobile|car]], has peaked and will now fall in a sustained manner. The theory was developed as an alternative to the prevailing [[market saturation]] model, which suggested that car use would saturate and then remain reasonably constant, or to [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]-based theories which predict that traffic will increase again as the economy improves, linking recent traffic reductions to the [[Great Recession]] of 2008.

The theory was proposed following reductions, which have now been observed in Australia,&lt;ref name = TimeMagazine/&gt; Belgium,&lt;ref name = TimeMagazine/&gt; France,&lt;ref name = TimeMagazine/&gt; Germany, Iceland, Japan (early 1990s), New Zealand,&lt;ref name=TimeMagazine/&gt; Sweden, the United Kingdom (many cities from about 1994) and the United States. Traffic into London fell by 28% between 1994 and 2003{{cn|date=February 2018}} (prior to the introduction of the [[London congestion charge]]).  A study by [[John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center|Volpe Transportation]] in 2013 noted that average miles driven by individuals in the [[Transportation in the United States|United States]], has been declining, from {{convert|900|miles}} per month in 2004 to {{convert|820|miles}} in July 2012, and that the decline had continued since the recent upturn in the US economy.&lt;ref name=MSNBC/&gt;

A number of prominent academics have written in support of the theory, including Emeritus Professor Phil Goodwin, formerly Director of the transport research groups at Oxford University and UCL, and Professor David Metz, a former Chief Scientist of the UK [[Department of Transport]]. The theory is disputed by the [[Department for Transport|UK Department for Transport]], which predicts that road traffic in the United Kingdom will grow by 50% over the coming 25 years and Professor [[Stephen Glaister]], Director of the [[RAC Foundation]], who say traffic will start increasing again as the economy improves. Unlike [[peak oil]], a theory based on a reduction in the ability to extract oil due to [[resource depletion]], peak car is attributed to more complex and less understood causes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==History==

===Saturation model===
The idea that car use would eventually reach a saturation level and stop growing further seems to have been around since the 1930s.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In [[Traffic in Towns]], a report produced in 1963 for the UK [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]], [[Colin Buchanan (town planner)|Professor Sir Colin Buchanan]] suggested that traffic would saturate early in the 21st century. It has certainly been used in official [[Transportation forecasting|traffic forecasting]] since the 1970s, for example in a UK Government study by Tulpule (1973) which forecast that car [[ownership]] would reach its maximum level by about 2010, with car use showing little further growth after that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tulpule |first=A. H. |title= Forecasts of vehicles and traffic in Great Britain 1972 revision, Report LR543 |year=1973 |publisher= Transport and Road Research Laboratory |location= Crowthorne, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of international comparisons starting in 1993 and continuing until his death in 2011, the American researcher [[Lee Schipper]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schipper |first=Lee |author2=Steiner R |author3= Figueroa M J |author4= Dolan K |title= Fuel prices and economy. Factors affecting land travel |journal= Transport Policy |year=1993 |volume=! |issue=1 |pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schipper |first=Lee |title= Automobile use, fuel economy and CO2 emissions in industrialized countries: Encouraging trends through 2008? |journal= Transport Policy |year=2011 |volume=18 |pages=358–372 |doi= 10.1016/j.tranpol.2010.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his colleagues noted that car traffic growth had slowed or ceased in a number of [[developed country|developed economies]].

==='Peak car' theory===
The 'peak car' hypothesis was proposed after declines in traffic during the morning peak period were observed from the mid 1990s in some places and at a national level since about 2008. ''Local Transport Today'', a professional transport journal in the United Kingdom that the number "peak car traffic" entering Britain's town and city centres during the morning [[peak hour]]s had declined significantly over the previous ten years; of 21 areas studied all except Leeds had seen falls.&lt;ref name=ltt2006/&gt; Traffic into London during the morning peak period had fallen 28% between 1994 and 2003 when the [[London congestion charge]] was introduced and a further 12% by 2004.&lt;ref name=ltt2006/&gt; Inbound car trip into Birmingham during the morning peak period had fallen by 29% between 1995 and 2003.&lt;ref name=ltt2006&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.transportxtra.com/magazines/local_transport_today/news/?id=5621&amp;StartRow=21 |title= Peak car traffic dropping in city centres, LTT survey reveals |work= Local Transport Today |date= 7 April 2006 |quote= The number of cars entering Britain's town and city centres in the morning peak hours has declined significantly in the last ten years, according to analysis of 21 urban areas conducted by LTT.... The number of people entering central London by car during the morning peak hours (0700-1000) has fallen by over 40% since 1994 and had already declined by 28% prior to the introduction of the congestion charge in 2003. Birmingham saw the number of inbound trips by car during the morning peak period fall by 29% between 1995 and 2003.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between June and September 2010 Professor Phil Goodwin published a series of articles in the UK professional transport press suggesting that data showed not merely a plateau in vehicle miles driven but rather a decline in overall automobile usage per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportxtra.com/magazines/local_transport_today/opinion/?id=23221|title=What about ‘peak car’ – heresy or revelation?|author=Goodwin, P.|work=Local Transport Today|date=25 June 2010|quote=Rail, bus and tram use all peaked and then declined, so why do so many people assume that car use will either keep rising indefinitely or reach saturation and a ‘steady state’ condition?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportxtra.com/magazines/local_transport_today/news/?ID=23588|title=Thoughts on peak car – part two|author=Goodwin, P.|work=Local Transport Today|date=23 July 2010|quote=‘Peak car’ is the idea that car use may not saturate, but turn down. In Part One in June I discussed the experience of rail use after 1918, and road public transport use after 1950, where this happened. In Part Two in July I considered what sort of evidence could distinguish between the identical-looking saturating curve and one about to turn down.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportxtra.com/magazines/local_transport_today/news/?ID=23909|title=Peak Car – part three: the evidence|author=Goodwin, P.|work=Local Transport Today|date=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportxtra.com/magazines/local_transport_today/news/?id=24184&amp;StartRow=1|title=Peak Car – part four: the policy implications|author=Goodwin, P.|work=Local Transport Today|date=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These articles were later compiled and updated in a journal article by Goodwin, published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Phil|title=Three Views on 'Peak Car'|journal=World Transport Policy &amp; Practice|year=2011|volume=17 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Metz, of [[University College London]] and former Chief Scientist of the UK [[Department of Transport]] noted that "peak car use came and went [in the UK] at least 15 years ago, when none of us noticed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportxtra.com/magazines/local_transport_today/news/?id=23495&amp;StartRow=21|title=Car use peaked in London fifteen years ago|work=Local Transport Today|date=9 July 2010|quote=as far as London is concerned, peak car use came and went at least 15 years ago, when none of us noticed. Transport for London’s most recent Travel in London report records a steady decline in private transport’s share of trips since at least 1993 (then 50%, 41% in 2008). Correspondingly, public transport’s mode share has risen from 24% to 33%, while walking and cycling have been steady at about 25%. Historically, car use has invariably increased as incomes have risen. So it is remarkable that this trend has gone into reverse in London, a prosperous world city with a growing population.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then published articles in 2010 and 2012 suggesting that the Department's forecasts of growth were erroneous because in the UK a saturated peak level had already been reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Metz|first=David|title=Saturation of demand for daily travel|journal=Transport Reviews|year=2010|volume=30 | issue = 5|pages=659–674|doi=10.1080/01441640903556361}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Metz|first=David|title=Demographic determinants of daily travel demand|journal=Transport Policy|year=2012|volume=21 | issue = 1|pages=20–25|doi=10.1016/j.tranpol.2012.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent statistics in the US show total vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) increasing after several years of decline,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-09-16|title=Moving 12-Month Total Vehicle Miles Traveled|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M12MTVUSM227NFWA}}&lt;/ref&gt; although per-capita VMT remains below its all-time high.

== Proposed causes ==
There is speculation about causes of a decline in automobile usage. Analysts such as Newman&lt;ref name=newman/&gt; as well as views expressed in the journal edited by Melia entitled ''World Transport Policy and Practice''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melia (Guest Editor)|first=Steve|title=Special Issue on 'A Future Beyond the Car'|journal=World Transport Policy and Practice|year=2011|volume=17 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; point to various interrelated causes. Factors include:

# Travel time budgets, a theoretical psychological limit suggesting a long term constraint on the amount of time people allocate to travel of about one hour a day. Studies using this concept (albeit not always defined in the same way) have included those of Zahavi (1974),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zahavi|first=Yacov|title=Travel Time Budgets and Mobility in Urban Areas|year=1974|publisher=US Department of Transportation|location=Washington DC, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mogridge (1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mogridge|first=M J M|title=The Car Market: A study of the statistics and dynamics of supply-demand equilibrium|year=1983|publisher=Pion|location=London|isbn=0-85086-085-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Metz (2010) who suggested that saturation would naturally follow from the observation that access to destinations increased with the square of speed, but was offset by the tendency for each additional choice of destination to offer less and less extra benefit. A version was suggested by Marchetti, sometimes called 'the Marchetti Wall'; when cities become more than "one hour wide," they stop growing or they become dysfunctional, or both.&lt;ref name=NTS071811&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transportation.nationaljournal.com/2011/07/peak-car-use-shows-a-rational.php |title='Peak Car Use' Shows a Rational Public |work=NationalJournal Transportation |date=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this view, these developments have reduced the need for travel by car, such that the "love affair with the phone" has replaced the "love affair with the car" for a proportion of the population, and that widespread use of cell phones and [[Skype]] meant there was less need for in-person visits.&lt;ref name = ScientificAmerican&gt;Julia Pyper and ClimateWire, Scientific American, [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=has-us-reached-peak-car-americans-driving-less Has the U.S. Reached "Peak Car"?

One analyst explained about changing attitudes of young people:

{{Quote|Virtual contact through electronic means reduces the need for actual contact among young people ... Furthermore, some young people feel that driving interferes with texting.|Michael Sivak, [[University of Michigan]], 2012&lt;ref name = ScientificAmerican/&gt;}}

Another elaborated about the ''saturation of demand'' hypothesis:

{{Quote|They say as we get richer, we'll want to travel more. There's no limit. Our hunch was that this might not be the case. ... The data that we have shows fairly clearly that the growth in travel demand has stopped in every industrialised country that we looked at.|Adam Millard-Ball, [[McGill University]]&lt;ref name = TheGuardian/&gt;}}

The proposition that car usage has peaked has been disputed regarding vehicle usage in the United Kingdom. In December 2010, [[Stephen Glaister]], the Director of the [[RAC Foundation]], suggested that total traffic has grown more or less as a straight line since the 1950s and such growth will recommence when economic conditions improve;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glaister|first=Stephen|title=Evidence to the transport select committee inquiry on transport and the economy, questions 430-460, House of Commons 2 Mar 2011.|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmtran/473/10120703.htm|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2012-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011, the UK [[Department for Transport]] predicted a 50% growth in traffic in the coming 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportxtra.com/magazines/local_transport_today/news/?id=30085&amp;StartRow=1|title=DfT rejects ‘peak car’ hypothesis and predicts return to traffic growth|work=Local Transport Today|date=16 March 2012|quote=After decades of relentless growth the last ten years have seen road traffic volumes first stabilise and then decline. But the DfT believes this is just a temporary blip and that growth will soon resume... ROAD TRAFFIC volumes in England are likely to grow by almost 50% over the next 25 years, according to the DfT’s new National Road Traffic Forecasts (NRTF). The headline forecast is that road traffic will rise from 261.2bn vehicle miles [{{convert|261.2|e9miles|e9km|abbr=off|disp=out}}] in 2010 to 375.6bn [{{convert|375.6|e9miles|e9km|abbr=off|disp=out}}] in 2035. This 44% growth is a central estimate, between the low growth of 34% (to 349.8bn miles) and the high growth of 55% (to 405bn miles [{{convert|405|e9miles|e9km|abbr=off|disp=out}}]).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a corroborating view by Paul Watters suggested that car usage will continue to be important in Britain, and that there won't be “shattering change” by 2020.&lt;ref name = TheGuardian/&gt; Scholars studying transport and socio-technical transitions have elaborated possible future scenarios for car use in England and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F., Kemp, R., Dudley, G., Lyons, G. (2012) Automobility in Transition? A Socio-Technical Analysis of Sustainable Transport. Oxford: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of [[autonomous car]]s is likely to accelerate the decline in car ownership. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}A recent case study by the OECD [[International Transport Forum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/15cpb_self-drivingcars.pdf|title=Urbam Mobility System Upgrade|last=|first=|date=1 April 2015|website=International Transport Forum|publisher=OECD|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested [[Lisbon]] could maintain current levels of mobility with an autonomous car share fleet one tenth the size of its current vehicle fleet.

'''Pharmacology''' is the branch of [[biology]] concerned with the study of [[drug]] action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vallance P, Smart TG |title=The future of pharmacology |journal=[[British Journal of Pharmacology]] |volume=147 Suppl 1 |issue= S1|pages=S304–7 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16402118 |pmc=1760753 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0706454 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a drug can be broadly defined as any man-made, natural, or endogenous (from within the body) molecule which exerts a biochemical or physiological effect on the cell, tissue, organ, or organism (sometimes the word [[pharmacon]] is used as a term to encompass these [[endogenous]] and [[exogenous]] [[Biological activity|bioactive]] species). More specifically, it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function. If substances have medicinal properties, they are considered [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]].

The field encompasses drug composition and properties, synthesis and drug design, molecular and cellular [[mechanism of action|mechanisms]], organ/systems mechanisms, signal transduction/cellular communication, molecular diagnostics, [[drug interaction|interaction]]s, [[toxicology]], [[chemical biology]], therapy, and medical applications and antipathogenic capabilities. The two main areas of pharmacology are [[pharmacodynamics]] and [[pharmacokinetics]]. Pharmacodynamics studies the effects of a drug on biological systems, and Pharmacokinetics studies the effects of biological systems on a drug. In broad terms, pharmacodynamics discusses the chemicals with biological [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], and pharmacokinetics discusses the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of chemicals from the biological systems. Pharmacology is not synonymous with [[pharmacy]] and the two terms are frequently confused. Pharmacology, a biomedical science, deals with the research, discovery, and characterization of chemicals which show biological effects and the elucidation of cellular and organismal function in relation to these chemicals. In contrast, pharmacy, a health services profession, is concerned with application of the principles learned from pharmacology in its clinical settings; whether it be in a dispensing or clinical care role. In either field, the primary contrast between the two are their distinctions between direct-patient care, for pharmacy practice, and the science-oriented research field, driven by pharmacology.

The origins of [[clinical pharmacology]] date back to the Middle Ages in [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'', [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]]'s ''Commentary on Isaac'', and [[John of St Amand]]'s ''Commentary on the Antedotary of Nicholas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brater DC, Daly WJ |title=Clinical pharmacology in the Middle Ages: principles that presage the 21st century |journal=Clin.

Hollinger (2003)."''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bx-WfLwrVH8C&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Introduction to pharmacology]''".

Early pharmacologists focused on natural substances, mainly plant extracts. Pharmacology developed in the 19th century as a biomedical science that applied the principles of scientific experimentation to therapeutic contexts.&lt;ref name=rang&gt;{{cite book|last=Rang|first=H.P.|title=Pharmacology|year=2007 |author2=M.M. Dale |author3=J.M. Ritter |author4=R.J. Flower|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|location=[[China]]|isbn=0-443-06911-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today pharmacologists use [[genetics]], [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], and other advanced tools to transform information about molecular mechanisms and targets into therapies directed against disease, defects or pathogens, and create methods for preventative care, diagnostics, and ultimately [[personalized medicine]].

==Divisions==
The discipline of pharmacology can be divided into many sub disciplines each with a specific focus.

===Clinical pharmacology===
[[Clinical pharmacology]] is the basic science of pharmacology with an added focus on the application of pharmacological principles and methods in the [[medical clinic]] and towards patient care and outcomes.

===Neuropharmacology===
[[Neuropharmacology]] is the study of the effects of medication on [[central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system]] functioning.

===Psychopharmacology=== 
[[Psychopharmacology]], also known as behavioral pharmacology, is the study of the effects of medication on the [[psyche (psychology)]], observing changed behaviors of the body and mind, and how molecular events are manifest in a measurable behavioral form. Psychopharmacology is an interdisciplinary field which studies behavioral effects of psychoactive drugs. It incorporates approaches and techniques from neuropharmacology, animal behavior and behavioral neuroscience, and is interested in the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms of action of psychoactive drugs. Another goal of behavioral pharmacology is to develop animal behavioral models to screen chemical compounds with therapeutic potentials. People in this field (called behavioral pharmacologists) typically use small animals (e.g. rodents) to study psychotherapeutic drugs such as antipsychotics, antidepressants and anxiolytics, and drugs of abuse such as nicotine, cocaine and methamphetamine. '''Ethopharmacology''' (not to be confused with [[ethnopharmacology]]) is a term which has been in use since the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 1792005| year = 1991| author1 = Krsiak| first1 = M| title = Ethopharmacology: A historical perspective| journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews| volume = 15| issue = 4| pages = 439–45| doi=10.1016/s0149-7634(05)80124-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word ἦθος ''ethos'' meaning character and "pharmacology" the study of drug actions and mechanism.

===Cardiovascular pharmacology===
Cardiovascular pharmacology is the study of the effects of drugs on the entire cardiovascular system, including the heart and blood vessels.

===Pharmacogenetics===
[[Pharmacogenetics]] is clinical testing of genetic variation that gives rise to differing response to drugs.

===Pharmacogenomics===
[[Pharmacogenomics]] is the application of genomic technologies to [[drug discovery]] and further characterization of older drugs.

===Pharmacoepidemiology===
[[Pharmacoepidemiology]] is the study of the effects of drugs in large numbers of people.

===Safety pharmacology===
[[Safety pharmacology]] specialises in detecting and investigating potential undesirable pharmacodynamic effects of new chemical entities (NCEs) on physiological functions in relation to exposure in the therapeutic range and above.

===Systems pharmacology===
[[Systems pharmacology]] is the coding system principles in the field of pharmacology.

===Toxicology===
[[Toxicology]] is the study of the [[adverse effect]]s, molecular targets, and characterization of drugs or any chemical substance in excess (including those beneficial in lower doses).

===Theoretical pharmacology===
Theoretical pharmacology is a relatively new and rapidly expanding field of research activity in which many of the techniques of computational chemistry, in particular computational quantum chemistry and the method of molecular mechanics, are proving to be of great value. Theoretical pharmacologists aim at rationalizing the relation between the activity of a particular drug, as observed experimentally, and its structural features as derived from computer experiments. They aim to find structure—activity relations. Furthermore, on the basis of the structure of a given organic molecule, the theoretical pharmacologist aims at predicting the biological activity of new drugs that are of the same general type as existing drugs. More ambitiously, it aims to predict entirely new classes of drugs, tailor-made for specific purposes.

===Posology&lt;!--'Posology' redirects here--&gt;===
'''Posology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is the study of how medicines are dosed. This depends upon various factors including age, climate, weight, sex, elimination rate of drug, genetic polymorphism and time of administration. It is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words πόσος ''posos'' meaning "how much?" and -λογία ''-logia'' "study of".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/posology "posology"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental pharmacology===
Environmental pharmacology is a new discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://www.ijp-online.com/text.asp?2006/38/4/229/27017 | doi=10.4103/0253-7613.27017 | last=Rahman| first=SZ| last2=Khan| first2=RA| title= Environmental pharmacology: A new discipline | journal= Indian J. Pharmacol. |date=Dec 2006| volume=38|  issue=4| pages= 229–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focus is being given to understand [[gene–environment interaction]], drug-environment interaction and toxin-environment interaction. There is a close collaboration between [[environmental science]] and [[medicine]] in addressing these issues, as healthcare itself can be a cause of [[environmental damage]] or [[Environmental remediation|remediation]]. Human health and ecology are intimately related. Demand for more pharmaceutical products may place the public at risk through the destruction of species. The entry of chemicals and drugs into the [[aquatic ecosystem]] is a more serious concern today. In addition, the production of some [[illegal drugs]] pollutes drinking water supply by releasing [[carcinogens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sue Ruhoy Ilene |author2=Daughton Christian G | year = 2008 | title = Beyond the medicine cabinet: An analysis of where and why medications accumulate | url = | journal = Environment International | volume = 34 | issue = 8| pages = 1157–1169 | doi=10.1016/j.envint.2008.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field is intimately linked with Public Health fields.'''

=== Experimental pharmacology ===
Experimental pharmacology involves the study of pharmacology through [[bioassay]], to test the [[efficacy]] and potency of a drug.

===Dental pharmacology===
[[Dental pharmacology]] relates to the study of drugs commonly used in the treatment of dental disease.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Scientific background==
The study of chemicals requires intimate knowledge of the biological system affected. With the knowledge of [[cell biology]] and [[biochemistry]] increasing, the field of pharmacology has also changed substantially. It has become possible, through molecular analysis of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], to design chemicals that act on specific cellular signaling or [[metabolic pathway]]s by affecting sites directly on cell-surface receptors (which modulate and mediate cellular signaling pathways controlling cellular function).

A chemical has, from the pharmacological point-of-view, various properties. [[Pharmacokinetics]] describes the effect of the body on the chemical (e.g. [[half-life]] and [[volume of distribution]]), and [[pharmacodynamics]] describes the chemical's effect on the body (desired or [[toxic]]).

When describing the pharmacokinetic properties of the chemical that is the active ingredient or [[Active ingredient|active pharmaceutical ingredient]] (API), pharmacologists are often interested in ''L-ADME'':
* [[Liberation (pharmacology)|Liberation]] – How is the API disintegrated (for solid oral forms (breaking down into smaller particles)), dispersed, or dissolved from the medication?
* [[Absorption (digestive)|Absorption]] – How is the API absorbed (through the [[human skin|skin]], the [[intestine]], the [[oral mucosa]])?
* [[Distribution (pharmacology)|Distribution]] – How does the API spread through the organism?
* [[Drug metabolism|Metabolism]] – Is the API converted chemically inside the body, and into which substances. Are these active (as well)? Could they be toxic?
* [[Excretion]] – How is the API excreted (through the bile, urine, breath, skin)?

Medication is said to have a narrow or wide ''[[therapeutic index]]'' or ''[[therapeutic window]]''. This describes the ratio of desired effect to toxic effect. A compound with a narrow therapeutic index (close to one) exerts its desired effect at a dose close to its toxic dose. A compound with a wide therapeutic index (greater than five) exerts its desired effect at a dose substantially below its toxic dose. Those with a narrow margin are more difficult to dose and administer, and may require [[therapeutic drug monitoring]] (examples are [[warfarin]], some [[antiepileptic]]s, [[aminoglycoside]] [[antibiotics]]). Most anti-[[cancer]] drugs have a narrow therapeutic margin: toxic side-effects are almost always encountered at doses used to kill [[tumor]]s.

==Medicine development and safety testing==
[[Drug development|Development of medication]] is a vital concern to [[medicine]], but also has strong [[economical]] and [[political]] implications. To protect the [[consumer]] and prevent abuse, many governments regulate the manufacture, sale, and administration of medication. In the [[United States]], the main body that regulates pharmaceuticals is the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and they enforce [[Technical standard|standards]] set by the [[United States Pharmacopoeia]]. In the [[European Union]], the main body that regulates pharmaceuticals is the [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] and they enforce standards set by the [[European Pharmacopoeia]].

The metabolic stability and the reactivity of a library of candidate drug compounds have to be assessed for drug metabolism and toxicological studies. Many methods have been proposed for quantitative predictions in drug metabolism; one example of a recent computational method is [http://www.freebase.com/view/en/sporcalc SPORCalc].{{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=James Smith |author2=Viktor Stein | year = 2009 | title = SPORCalc: A development of a database analysis that provides putative metabolic enzyme reactions for ligand-based drug design | journal = Computational Biology and Chemistry | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–159 | pmid=19157988 | doi = 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2008.11.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the chemical structure of a medicinal compound is altered slightly, this could slightly or dramatically alter the medicinal properties of the compound depending on the level of alteration as it relates to the structural composition of the substrate or receptor site on which it exerts its medicinal effect, a concept referred to as the structural activity relationship (SAR). This means that when a useful activity has been identified, chemists will make many similar compounds called analogues, in an attempt to maximize the desired medicinal effect(s) of the compound. This development phase can take anywhere from a few years to a decade or more and is very expensive.&lt;ref name="ReviseALChem"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=David|author2=Alasdair Thorpe |author3=Chris Otter |title=Revise A2 Chemistry|publisher=[[Heinemann Educational Publishers]]|year=2004|pages=1|isbn =0-435-58347-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These new analogues need to be developed. It needs to be determined how safe the medicine is for human consumption, its stability in the human body and the best form for delivery to the desired organ system, like tablet or aerosol. After extensive testing, which can take up to 6 years, the new medicine is ready for marketing and selling.&lt;ref name="ReviseALChem"/&gt;

As a result of the long time required to develop analogues and test a new medicine and the fact that of every 5000 potential new medicines typically only one will ever reach the open market, this is an expensive way of doing things, often costing over 1 billion dollars. To recoup this outlay pharmaceutical companies may do a number of things:&lt;ref name="ReviseALChem"/&gt;
* Carefully research the demand for their potential new product before spending an outlay of company funds.&lt;ref name="ReviseALChem"/&gt;
* Obtain a patent on the new medicine preventing other companies from producing that medicine for a certain allocation of time.&lt;ref name="ReviseALChem"/&gt;

==Drug legislation and safety==
In the [[United States]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is responsible for creating guidelines for the approval and use of drugs. The FDA requires that all approved drugs fulfill two requirements:
# The drug must be found to be effective against the disease for which it is seeking approval (where 'effective' means only that the drug performed better than placebo or competitors in at least two trials).
# The drug must meet safety criteria by being subject to animal and controlled human testing.

Gaining FDA approval usually takes several years. Testing done on animals must be extensive and must include several species to help in the evaluation of both the effectiveness and toxicity of the drug. The dosage of any drug approved for use is intended to fall within a range in which the drug produces a [[therapeutic effect]] or desired outcome.&lt;ref name=nagle&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagle|first=Hinter|title=Pharmacology: An Introduction|year=2005|author2=Barbara Nagle|publisher=[[McGraw Hill]]|location=[[Boston]]|isbn=0-07-312275-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs in the U.S. is regulated by the federal [[Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA)|Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987]].

The [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA) has a similar role in the UK.

==Education==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
Students of pharmacology are trained as biomedical scientists, studying the effects of drugs on living organisms. This can lead to new drug discoveries, as well as a better understanding of the way in which the human body works.

Students of pharmacology must have detailed working knowledge of aspects in physiology, pathology and chemistry. During a typical degree they will cover areas such as (but not limited to) biochemistry, cell biology, basic physiology, genetics and the [[Central Dogma]], medical microbiology, neuroscience, and depending on the department's interests, bio-organic chemistry, or chemical biology.

Modern Pharmacology is highly interdisciplinary. Graduate programs accept students from most biological and chemical backgrounds. With the increasing drive towards biophysical and computational research to describe systems, pharmacologists may even consider themselves mainly physical scientists. In many instances, Analytical Chemistry is closely related to the studies and needs of pharmacological research. Therefore, many institutions will include pharmacology under a Chemistry or Biochemistry Department, especially if a separate Pharmacology Dept. does not exist. What makes an institutional department independent of another, or exist in the first place, is usually an artifact of historical times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1896|title=Examinations In Pharmacology|jstor=20234917|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=1833|pages=418–418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas a pharmacy student will eventually work in a pharmacy dispensing medications, a pharmacologist will typically work within a laboratory setting. Careers for a pharmacologist include academic positions (medical and non-medical), governmental positions, private industrial positions, science writing, scientific patents and law, consultation, biotech and pharmaceutical employment, the alcohol industry, food industry, forensics/law enforcement, public health, and environmental/ecological sciences.

==Etymology==
The word "pharmacology" is derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:φάρμακον|φάρμακον]]}}, ''pharmakon'', "drug, [[poison]], [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]" and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'' "study of", "knowledge of"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pharmacy Pharmacy (n.) - Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pharmacology Pharmacology - Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. the [[Pharmacy#Etymology|etymology of ''pharmacy'']]).

'''Prohibition of Unlawful Assembly (Interference with the Freedom of Matrimonial Alliances) Bill, 2011''' is a proposed legislation in [[India]] which intends to check [[honor killing]]s.&lt;ref name=Honor-killing&gt;{{cite news|title=Law Commission for making honour killings non-bailable offence|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/law-commission-for-making-honour-killings-nonbailable-offence/901975/|accessdate=27 November 2014|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to criminalise the intimidation of consenting adults by [[kangaroo court]]s for same-[[gotra]] marriages, inter-caste, inter-community and inter-religious marriages.&lt;ref name=new-draft/&gt;

==Overview==
The first draft was presented by the [[Law Commission of India]] on 20 January 2012.  The commission had also released a consultation paper on [[Khap|khap panchayat]]s and honour killings, and sought public opinion on it. The commission’s consultation paper had rejected the government’s proposal that [[Indian Penal Code]] should be amended to bring honour killing under [[Murder (law of India)|Section 300]]. The commission said that although the offences were already covered by the Indian Penal Code, there was nothing to prevent such assemblies from happening.&lt;ref name=Honor-killing/&gt;&lt;ref name=new-draft&gt;{{cite news|title=Law Commission's new draft wants khap panchayats on marriages declared illegal|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/law-commissions-new-draft-wants-khap-panchayats-on-marriages-declared-illegal/article2829231.ece|accessdate=27 November 2014|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed bill seeks to prohibit any person or group of persons to gather and adjudicate or condemn any marriage, which is not prohibited by law, on the claims that it brings dishonour of a [[caste]], locality or community.&lt;ref name=new-draft/&gt;

Marriage, as defined by the draft, also includes proposed and intended marriages. The [[district collector]] and [[magistrate]] will be given the responsibility to protect the targeted persons and prevents such illegal gatherings. Criminal intimidation will have the same definition as under the Section 503 of the Indian Penal Code.&lt;ref name=new-draft/&gt;

The offences under it will be cognisable, non-bailable and non-compoundable. The trials will be decided by a sessions judge or an additional session judge. Special courts which would be set by states in consultation with the High Courts will have the power of a session court.&lt;ref name=Honor-killing/&gt; The courts will also be able to take [[Sua sponte|sou motu]] cognisance  of the case.&lt;ref name=new-draft/&gt; The offences will carry a maximum of three years imprisonment and a fine of {{currency|30,000|INR}}.&lt;ref name=new-draft/&gt;

'''Psychohistory''' is a fictional science in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|''Foundation'']] universe which combines [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[mathematical statistics]] to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people, such as the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]]. It was first introduced in the four short stories  (1942–1944) which would later be collected as the 1951 novel ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''.

==Axioms==
Psychohistory depends on the idea that, while one cannot foresee the actions of a particular individual, the [[Empirical statistical laws|laws of statistics]] as applied to large groups of people could predict the general flow of future events. Asimov used the analogy of a [[gas]]: An observer has great difficulty in predicting the motion of a single molecule in a gas, but with the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] can predict the [[Law of mass action|mass action]] of the gas to a high level of accuracy. Asimov applied this concept to the population of his fictional [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]], which numbered one [[1000000000000000000 (number)|quintillion]]. The character responsible for the science's creation, [[Hari Seldon]], established two [[axiom]]s:
* that the population whose behavior was modeled should be sufficiently large
* that the population should remain in ignorance of the results of the application of psychohistorical analyses because if it's aware, the group changes its behaviour.

[[Ebling Mis]] added these axioms
* That there would be no fundamental change in the society 
* That human reactions to stimuli would remain constant.

[[Golan Trevize]]  in [[Foundation and Earth]] added this axiom
* that humans are the only sentient intelligence in the galaxy.

==The Prime Radiant==
Asimov presents the Prime Radiant, a device designed by [[Hari Seldon]] and built by [[Yugo Amaryl]], as storing the psychohistorical [[equations]] showing the future development of humanity.

The Prime Radiant projects the equations onto walls in some unexplained manner, but it does not cast shadows, thus allowing workers easy interaction. Control operates through the power of the mind, allowing the user to zoom in to details of the equations, and to change them. One can make annotations, but by convention all amendments remain anonymous.

A student destined for speakerhood has to present an amendment to the plan. Five different boards then check the mathematics rigorously. Students have to defend their proposals against concerted and merciless attacks. After two years the change gets reviewed again. If after the second examination it still passes muster the contribution becomes part of the [[Seldon Plan]].

The Radiant, as well as being interactive, employs a type of colour-coding to equations within itself for ready comprehension by Psychohistorians.

* '''Seldon Black''' are the original Seldon Plan equations developed by Seldon and Amaryl during the first four decades of Seldon's work at the University of Streeling, and define Seldon Crises, the Plan's duration, and the eventuation of the Second Galactic Empire.
* '''Speaker Red''' are additions to the plan by Speakers (Senior Mentalic Psychohistorians of the Second Foundation) since the time of Seldon. 
* '''Deviation Blue ''' are observed deviations away from Psychohistorical projections with a deviation in excess of 1.5 standard deviation of predicted outcomes (1.5 σ). The Era of Deviations, at the rise of the [[Mule_(Foundation)|Mule]], produced deviations in the Seldon Plan in excess of .5 through 10 sigmas, and the resolution of this period required a full century of labour on the part of the Second Foundation to return the Galaxy to the Plan.

Other colours have been imagined by fans, and mentioned by Asimov, such as:

* Notation Green - additions of pertinent scientific papers appended to findings (Forward the Foundation)
* Projection Purple - Useful for determining limits on future Speaker Red equations, using projections of events with regard to a very sketchy but still monumental Seldon Black scheme. A tool of the first three generations of Psychohistorians after Seldon, and by the 5th Century of the Plan a teaching tool at most. (Forward the Foundation)

==Development==
In his later career, Asimov described some historical (pre-Seldon) origins of psychohistory. In ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'' (1983), which takes place thousands of years before ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]'' (1951), he describes roboticist [[Han Fastolfe]]'s attempts to create the science based on careful observation of others, particularly of his daughter Vasilia. ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'' (1988) suggests that one of Fastolfe's robots, [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], manipulated Seldon into practical application of this science.

==Limitations==
{{refimprove|date=March 2013}}
The fact that Seldon established a Second Foundation of mental-science adepts to oversee his [[Seldon Plan]] might suggest that even Seldon himself had doubts about the ultimate ability of a purely mathematical approach to predicting historical processes, and that he recognized that the development of psychic skills, such as those used by [[Mule (Foundation)|the Mule]], had the ability to invalidate the assumptions underlying his models, though he did not (and could not) predict the appearance of the Mule himself. The Seldon methodology might therefore only work at a certain level of species-development, and would over time become less useful.

Psychohistory has one basic, underlying limitation which Asimov postulated for the first time on the last page of the final book in the ''Foundation'' series:  psychohistory only functions in a galaxy populated only by humans.  In Asimov's Foundation series, humans form the only sentient race that developed in the entire [[Milky Way]] Galaxy.  Seldon developed psychohistory to predict the actions of large groups of ''humans''.  Even robots technically fall under the umbrella of psychohistory, because humans built them, and they thus represent more or less a human "action", or at least, possess a thought-framework similar enough to that of their human creators that psychohistory can predict their actions.  However, psychohistory cannot predict the actions of a sentient alien race; their psychology may differ so much from that of humans that normal psychohistory cannot understand or predict their actions.

The end of the series offered two possibilities:

# sentient races actually very rarely develop, such that only humans evolved in the [[Milky Way Galaxy]], and in most ''other'' galaxies, it appears probable (given this assumption) that only one sentient race would develop.  However, statistically two or more alien races might evolve in the same galaxy, leading them into inevitable conflict.  The fighting in this other galaxy would only end when one race emerged the victor, and after the prolonged conflict with other races, would have developed an aggressive and expansionist mindset.  In contrast, humans had never encountered another sentient species in the Milky Way Galaxy, so they never felt greatly compelled to expand to other galaxies, but instead to fight other humans over control of the Milky Way.  Eventually, such an aggressive alien race would expand from galaxy to galaxy, and try to invade the Milky Way Galaxy.
# through genetic engineering, subsets of humanity could alter themselves so significantly from baseline humans that they could for all intents and purposes be considered "aliens".  Specifically exemplifying this theory we find Asimov's [[Solaria (Isaac Asimov)|Solaria]]ns: humans evolved from an old [[Spacer (Asimov)|Spacer]] world who had genetically modified themselves into [[hermaphrodite]]s with [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] mental powers.

==Asimov on psychohistory==
On September 25, 1987, Asimov gave an interview to [[Terry Gross]] on her [[National Public Radio]] program, ''[[Fresh Air]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://homepage.mac.com/pockyrevolution/asimov/multimedia.htm "Sound Recordings"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040414172725/http://homepage.mac.com/pockyrevolution/asimov/multimedia.htm |date=2004-04-14 }}, retrieved 2008-05-07&lt;/ref&gt;
In it, Gross asked him about psychohistory:

:Gross: "What did you have in mind when you coined the term and the concept?"

:Asimov: "Well, I wanted to write a short story about the fall of the Galactic Empire. I had just finished reading the ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' [for] the second time, and I thought I might as well adapt it on a much larger scale to the Galactic Empire and get a story out of it. And my editor [[John W. Campbell|John Campbell]] was much taken with the idea, and said he didn't want it wasted on a short story. He wanted an open-ended series so it lasts forever, perhaps. And so I started doing that. In order to keep the story going from story to story, I was essentially writing future history, and I had to make it sufficiently different from modern history to give it that science fictional touch. And so I assumed that the time would come when there would be a science in which things could be predicted on a probabilistic or statistical basis."

:Gross: "Do you think that would be good if there really was such a science?"

:Asimov: "Well, I can't help but think it would be good, except that in my stories, I always have opposing views. In other words, people argue all possible... all possible... ways of looking at psychohistory and deciding whether it is good or bad.  So you can't really tell. I happen to feel sort of on the optimistic side. I think if we can somehow get across some of the problems that face us now, humanity has a glorious future, and that if we could use the tenets of psychohistory to guide ourselves we might avoid a great many troubles. But on the other hand, it might create troubles. It's impossible to tell in advance."

==Asimovian psychohistory and similar concepts in other fiction==
* ''[[Legend of the Galactic Heroes]]'' (November 1982) – The concept of psychohistory appears in this novel by [[Yoshiki Tanaka]].
* ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]'' (1989) – In [[Dan Simmons]]'s novel, the AI civilization is capable of statistically predicting future events to a very high degree of accuracy.
* ''In The Country of the Blind'' (1990) – In this novel, author [[Michael F. Flynn]] creates competing groups of psychohistorians.
* ''[[Ghost Rider 2099]]'' (May 1994) – In issue #1, a group of AIs predict that human society (and therefore the global network in which the AIs exist) will crash in 2113. One of them mentions that Asimov conceived the idea of such a mathematical model.
* ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' (1997) – In the episode "[[Statistical Probabilities]]", a think tank uses mathematics to predict the future in a manner likely to be a reference to Asimov.
* ''[[Preserver (Star Trek)|Star Trek: Preserver]]'' (2000) – In this  novel by [[William Shatner]], the science of psychohistory is used (and mentioned by name) by scholars at outpost Memory Alpha. Memory Alpha was shown in the ''[[Star Trek: Original Series]]'' episode "[[The Lights of Zetar]]", although psychohistory was never mentioned in the episode.
* ''[[Psychohistorical Crisis]]'' (2001) – [[Donald Kingsbury]]'s novel re-imagines the world of Isaac Asimov's ''Foundation'' trilogy, set after the establishment of the Second Empire.
* ''[[Transformers: Timelines]]'' (2005) – In the 'Shattered Glass' universe, [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] uses math to predict the future in a reference to Asimov.
* ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' (January 2007) – In issue #542, [[Mister Fantastic]] reveals his real reason for supporting the [[Registration acts (comics)|superhero registration act]] which prompted the Civil War: his development of a working version of Isaac Asimov's fictional psychohistory concept. Mister Fantastic's application of this science indicates to him that [[1000000000 (number)|billion]]s will die in escalating conflicts unless the act becomes law.
* ''[[House of Suns]]'' (2008) – This novel by [[Alastair Reynolds]] features a device called the "Universal Actuary", which aims to predict the future of civilisations in a manner very similar to psychohistory. As the limits of slower-than-light travel prevent any interstellar civilisations from lasting very long, one of its most important uses is to determine how much longer a given civilisation will last.
* ''[[Fallout 4]]'' (2015) – In the video game developed by [[Bethesda Softworks]], a robot dubbed P.A.M. (Predictive Analytical Machine) uses algorithms to make predictions of the future. However, her capabilities are limited due to the complexity of human free will and she has to adjust her algorithms constantly, especially when the player character shows up.

==Outside fiction==
{{original research|section|date=June 2015|discuss=Talk:Psychohistory (fictional)#Beyond fiction — also beyond OR}}
Polymath [[Adolphe Quetelet]] developed in the 19th century what he called "social physics". Quetelet studied the statistical laws underlying the behaviour of what he called "average man".

Some individuals and groups, inspired by Asimov's psychohistory, seriously explore the possibility of a working psychohistory not unlike the one imagined by Asimov—a statistical study of history that could help in the formulation of some "theory of history" and perhaps become a tool of historical prediction.&lt;ref name="urlpsychohistory : The psychohistory project"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/psychohistory/ |title=psychohistory : The psychohistory project |format= |work= |accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complexity theory, an offshoot of chaos mathematics theory, explored by [[Stuart Kauffman]] in his books "At Home in the Universe" and "Redefining the Sacred" cover the concept of statistical modeling of sociological evolutions. The concept was also explored in "Order Out of Chaos" by [[Ilya Prigogine]].

Another theory that has similarities {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} to Psychohistory is "Generational Dynamics" proposed by John J. Xenakis, where he proposes, "Generational Dynamics is a historical methodology that analyzes historical events through the flow of generations, and uses the analysis to forecast future events by comparing today's generational attitudes to those of the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.generationaldynamics.com/ww2010.htm|title=Generational Dynamics - America's Manifest Destiny - War against Terror - Freedom and Democracy|author=John J. Xenakis|work=generationaldynamics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, generations immediately after a major crisis event (civil war, world war) will be unwilling to live through such events again and will be [[Risk aversion|risk-averse]]. Generations after them may well be aware of previous crisis events, but will be more risk-tolerant, as they have not been exposed to the crisis themselves. Xenakis states that this allows one to predict future crisis events by analyzing the current generation's outlooks.

For similar ideas see [[Peter Turchin]]'s WAR AND PEACE AND WAR: The Life Cycles of Imperial Nations - his science is called [[cliodynamics]].

[[Nathan Eagle]] and [[Alex Pentland]] (among others) have developed useful techniques for predicting human behavior through statistical analysis of smartphone data.&lt;ref name="Eigenbehaviors: Identifying Structure in Routine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reality.media.mit.edu/pdfs/eigenbehaviors.pdf |title=Eigenbehaviors: Identifying Structure in Routine | format=PDF |work= |accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 67th science-fiction world convention in Montreal, Paul Krugman, the Nobel laureate in Economics, mentioned Hari Seldon, a central character in Foundation who was a psychohistorian, as his inspiration to study Economics since it is the closest thing to Psychohistory, according to P. Krugman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/01/100301fa_fact_macfarquhar?currentPage=5#ixzz0gGsFSlBL|title=The Deflationist|author=Larissa MacFarquhar|date=1 March 2010|work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Living Earth Simulator]], a platform of the proposed [[FuturICT]] project, aims to simulate social and economic developments on a global scale in order to anticipate and predict global phenomena, like for example financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futurict.eu/sites/default/files/docs/files/002-24%20PLATFORM%20Living%20Earth%20Simulator_0.pdf|title=The Living Earth Simulator|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007105050/http://www.futurict.eu/sites/default/files/docs/files/002-24%20PLATFORM%20Living%20Earth%20Simulator_0.pdf|archivedate= October 7, 2012|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; For similar ideas see Dan Braha's work on predicting the behavior of global civil unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dan Braha|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0048596|title=Global Civil Unrest: Contagion, Self-Organization, and Prediction|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=10|year=2012|page=e48596|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0048596|pmid=23119067|pmc=3485346}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work demonstrates, based on historical records and mathematical modeling, the existence of universal patterns of collective unrest across countries and regions.

The evolving field of [[behavioral economics]] embodies elements of Asimov's psychohistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ehcca.com/presentations/pfpsummit11/2.3.pdf |title=What Behavioral Economics tells us about Pay‐for‐Performance Performance Design: Lessons from a Medicaid Health Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at several revealed conspiracies, the estimated chance of a conspiracy being busted is 4 parts per million per year per conspirator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147905 |title=On the Viability of Conspiratorial Beliefs |author=David Grimes |journal=PLOS One |date=January 26, 2016 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0147905 |pmid=26812482 |pmc=4728076 |volume=11 |pages=e0147905}}&lt;/ref&gt; combining history, sociology, and mathematical statistics to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people.

The 3 February 2017 issue of [[Science (magazine)|Science]] has a special section "Prediction and Its Limits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6324/468 |title = Prediction and Its Limits |publisher=AAAS |date = 3 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This section has articles on many mathematical techniques of predicting human behavior, and explicitly compares them to Asimov's psychohistory.

==In role-playing games==
Psychohistory appears in the [[Traveller (role-playing game)|''Traveller'']] science-fiction [[role-playing game]], released in 1977. The alien race known as the Hivers use extensive [[memetic engineering|manipulation]] of other cultures based on psychohistorical data to achieve their own ends. Rumors ascribe the assassination of the Third Imperium's Emperor Strephon to a Hiver manipulation based on psychohistorical data indicating the eventual fall of the Third Imperium.  Humans in the setting have also attempted to use psychohistory, but with less skill or success; the [[Psionic]] Suppressions (which turned public opinion within the human Imperium against those with paranormal mental abilities, forcing them to go into hiding) resulted, unknown to most, from an experiment in psychohistory that got out of control and went much farther than the experimenters intended.

==Literary influences==
Some [[literary critic]]s have described Asimov's psychohistory as a reformulation of [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of history ([[historical materialism]]), though Asimov denied any direct influence.&lt;ref&gt;Booker, M. Keith.  "Monsters, Mushroom Clouds, and the Cold War: American Science Fiction and the Roots of Postmodernism, 1946-1964".  Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2001.  pp. 34-38.  "Numerous critics have noticed the parallels between Marx's and Seldon's visions of history."  Critics whom Booker discusses regarding the connection between Marxism and psychohistory include [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], [[Donald Wollheim]], and Charles Elkins.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably, Asimov's psychohistory departs significantly from Marx's general theory of history based on modes of production (as distinct from Marx's model of the capitalist economy, where "natural laws" work themselves out with "iron necessity") in that psychohistory is predictive (if only in the sense of involving precisely stated probabilities), and in that psychohistory is extrapolated from individual psychology and even from physics.&lt;ref&gt;Angus Taylor. "Asimov, Popper, and the Fate of the Galaxy", Foundation: The Review of Science Fiction 42 (1988): 59-64.&lt;/ref&gt;
Psychohistory also has echoes of [[modernization theory]] and of work in the social sciences that by the 1960s would lead to attempts at large-scale social prediction and control such as [[Project Camelot]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3803">'''Quintus Aemilius Lepidus''' (possibly '''Quintus Aemilius Lepidus Barbula''') (fl. 1st century BC) was a Roman [[Senate of the Roman Republic|senator]] and military officer who was appointed [[Roman consul|consul]] in 21 BC.

==Biography==
Quintus Aemilius Lepidus was a member of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]] ''[[Aemilia (gens)|gens Aemilia]]'' and the son of [[Manius Aemilius Lepidus (consul 66 BC)|Manius Aemilius Lepidus]], who was consul in 66 BC. He was a supporter of [[Marcus Antonius]].

It is assumed that Quintus Aemilius Lepidus was the “Barbula” referred to in [[Appian]]’s ''Civil Wars''.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton III, pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Appian recounts that a certain Marcus (assumed to be [[Marcus Lollius]]) was a [[legatus|legate]] of [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger]] who, after the [[Battle of Philippi]], had been proscribed. Hiding himself as a slave, he was purchased by Lepidus, whose identity was then revealed by a friend in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. Lepidus went to [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], who interceded on his behalf with [[Augustus|Octavianus]], who then ensured that Lollius’ name was removed from the [[proscription]] lists.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton II, pg. 365&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 40-38 BC, Lepidus was a [[Monetalis]] for Marcus Antonius in [[Pergamum]], minting [[Cistophorus|cistophori]] on behalf of Antony. Then, in 31 BC, he fought alongside Antony at the [[Battle of Actium]], but was captured. He was released only when Marcus Lollius interceded for him before Octavianus, thereby returning the favour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'', 4:49&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 21 BC, a second consular position was made available after Augustus decided not to nominate anyone for the office. After a bitter and rancorous election and lengthy disputes with his only competitor, [[Lucius Junius Silanus]], which reached the point that many people were asking for Augustus to return to put an end to it, Lepidus was elected [[Roman consul|consul]], serving alongside his old friend Marcus Lollius. Together, they oversaw the restoration of the [[Pons Fabricius]], one of the bridges that spanned the [[Tiber River]], which had been damaged in the floods of the year before.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, pgs. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

Lepidus is recorded as one of the [[Quindecimviri sacris faciundis]] who was part of the quorum which participated in the [[Secular Games]] of 17 BC; he was probably a member of this group during the civil wars. Finally in about 15 BC, he was the [[proconsul]]ar [[Roman governor|governor]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Syme, pg. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Small carbonaceous fossils''' ('''SCFs''') are sub-millimetric organic remains of organisms preserved in sedimentary strata.

The category of fossils includes robust or thick-walled entities such as plant spores, [[acritarch]]s and [[chitinozoa]], but the most interesting components are fragile remnants of animals that can only be extracted through a delicate maceration technique.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Butterfield | first1 = N. J. | last2 = Harvey | first2 = T. H. P. | title = Small carbonaceous fossils (SCFs): A new measure of early Paleozoic paleobiology | journal = Geology | volume = 40 | pages = 71 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1130/G32580.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  SCFs are relatively widespread and abundant, and can potentially preserve both mineralized and non-mineralized parts of organisms.  This undertapped record of the evolutionary processes occurring in the Palaeozoic cirtcumvents the biases inherent in the shelly fossil record.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2011" /&gt;

== Extraction ==
SCFs are typically preserved in fine-grained siliciclastic rocks, and are too small to be fruitfully examined on bedding planes.  Instead, they are extracted by dissolving the rock in acid.  Traditional palynological preparations involve high-energy steps such as centrifuging that destroy large and fragile fossils.  In the more delicate technique pioneered by Butterfield,&lt;ref name="ref_"&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = Butterfield | first1 = N. J.| title = A reassessment of the enigmatic Burgess Shale fossil ''Wiwaxia corrugata'' (Matthew) and its relationship to the polychaete ''Canadia spinosa'' Walcott| jstor = 2400789| journal = Paleobiology| volume = 16| issue = 3| pages = 287–303| year = 1990| doi = 10.2307/2400789}}&lt;/ref&gt; individual microfossils are picked from sieved acid residues by hand.  The sieving stage removes crystalline residue, making it easier to extract fossils, but introduces a filter: the smallest fossils (&lt;~40&amp;nbsp;µm) pass through the sieve and are lost.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2011" /&gt;  Once extracted, fossils can be mounted for light or scanning electron microscopy: transmitted light illuminates internal microstructures, whereas SEM picks out surface features.

== Preservation ==
SCFs are best preserved in anoxic conditions with limited thermal maturity; the presence of oxygen is particularly deleterious at high temperatures.&lt;ref name="Schiffbauer2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schiffbauer | first1 = J. D. | last2 = Wallace | first2 = A. F. | last3 = Hunter | first3 = J. L. | last4 = Kowalewski | first4 = M. | last5 = Bodnar | first5 = R.

| [[Scanning electron micrograph]] of a late [[Silurian]] chitinozoan, an enigmatic Palaeozoic SCF that can be recovered by the standard palynological technique.  Scale bar: 50&amp;nbsp;µm]]
Traditional palynological methods tend to extract plant spores and resistant microfossils such as acritarchs and chitinozoa.  The delicate approach can also recover fragments of animals: scales from priapulid worms, ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' sclerites, and arthropod feeding parts, for example.  These organisms are not represented in the conventional (shelly) fossil record, so the SCF record provides data on their distribution and evolution that would not otherwise be available.  Lagerstatten such as the [[Burgess Shale]] provide isolated snapshots of Palaeozoic life, whereas the SCF record provides a more continuous record, albeit blighted by the fragmentary (and consequently enigmatic) nature of many of its constituents.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2011" /&gt;  As such, the SCFs can fill in the details of the fossil record: for instance, highlighting the rapid nature of the [[Cambrian explosion]].&lt;ref name="Harvey2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = T.

'''''Sweet Bunch''''' ({{lang-el|Γλυκιά Συμμορία|translit=Glykia Symmoria|italic=yes}}) is a 1983 [[cinema of Greece|Greek]] dramatic [[experimental film|experimental]] [[independent film|independent]] [[underground film|underground]] [[art film]] directed by [[Nikos Nikolaidis]]. The film, produced by Vergeti Brothers and the Greek Film Center, is the second part of the "Years of Cholera" trilogy beginning with ''[[The Wretches Are Still Singing]]'' (1979) and ending with ''[[The Loser Takes It All]]'' (2002) which deals with the last decades of the twentieth century. The original Greek title directly references the Greek title of the 1969 [[Sam Peckinpah]] film ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' ({{lang-el|Άγρια Συμμορία|translit=Agria Symmoria|italic=yes}}). The film uses as background music the 1958 song "[[Sugartime]]" written by Charlie Phillips and [[Odis Echols]] as well as the 1940 song "Sweet Mara" ({{lang-el|«Γλυκιά Μαράτα,» [[romanization of Greek|tr.]] "Glykia Marata"}}) composed by Leo Rapitis to lyrics by Kostas Kofiniotis which was performed by Kakia Mendri. It was distributed by the Greek Film Center in [[Greece]] and by Restless Wind abroad.

==Plot==
A group of four misfits, Argyris, Andreas, Marina, and Sofia, live together in a house. Andreas just got out of jail. All four have become disillusioned with life and have lost any reason to live or die. They try all criminal experiences with each member of the group choosing a different activity to experiment in: frequenting expansive restaurants and leaving without paying, shoplifting, starring in pornographic films, and creating an anti-state organization. The authorities put them under surveillance, waiting for the slightest false step from any of them before acting violently. The first such misstep occurs when Sofia kills the police chief who monitors their home.

[[File:Tower of Silence, Mumbai 12.JPG|thumb|The Malabar Hill Tower of Silence today.]]

A '''Dakhma''' (Persian: دخمه ; Avestan: &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp; “tower of silence”), also called a '''Tower of Silence''', is a circular, raised structure built by [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] for [[excarnation]] – that is, for dead bodies to be exposed to [[Scavenger|carrion birds]], usually [[Old World vulture|vultures]].

Zoroastrian exposure of the dead is first attested in the mid-[[5th century BC]] [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'' of Herodotus]], but the use of towers is first documented in the early [[9th century CE]].&lt;ref name="Boyce_RBP" /&gt;{{rp|156–162}} The doctrinal rationale for exposure is to avoid contact with [[Zam|Earth]] or [[Atar|Fire]], both of which are considered sacred in the Zoroastrian religion.

One of the earliest literary descriptions of such a building appears in the late 9th-century ''Epistles of Manushchihr'', where the technical term is ''astodan'', "ossuary".&lt;ref name="Stausberg" /&gt;{{rp|205}} Another technical term that appears in the 9th/10th-century texts of Zoroastrian tradition (the so-called [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi books]]) is ''dakhmag'', for any place for the dead.&lt;ref name="Stausberg" /&gt;{{rp|206}} This [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian]] term is a borrowing from [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''dakhma'', of uncertain meaning but related to interment and commonly translated as "grave". In the Avesta, the term is pejorative and does not signify a construction of any kind.&lt;!-- cf Bartholomae 675,676; Hoffmann's daxme etc. --&gt;&lt;!-- Vd. 7.55, afterbirth of a stillborn? --&gt; In the [[Provinces of Iran|Iranian provinces]] of [[Yazd Province|Yazd]] and [[Kerman Province|Kerman]], ''dakhma'' continues as ''deme'' or ''dema''.&lt;ref name="Stausberg" /&gt;{{rp|206}} Yet another term that appears in the 9th/10th-century texts is ''dagdah'', "prescribed place".&lt;ref name="Stausberg" /&gt;{{rp|206}} The word also appears in later Zoroastrian texts of both [[India]] and Iran, but in 20th-century [[Modern India|India]] came to signify the lowest grade of [[Fire temple|temple fire]].&lt;ref name="Stausberg" /&gt;{{rp|206}} In India the term ''doongerwadi'' came into use after a Dakhma was constructed on a hill of that name.

The English language term "Tower of Silence" is a [[neologism]] attributed to Robert Murphy, a translator for the [[British India|British colonial government]] of India in the early 19th century.&lt;!--1832--&gt;&lt;!-- Kotwal "The Parsi Dakhma", p=162 --&gt;&lt;ref name="Stausberg" /&gt;{{rp|206}}

==Rationale==
[[File:Tower_of_silence_interior.jpg|thumb|left|View of the interior]]
Zoroastrian tradition considers a dead body (in addition to cut hair and nail parings) to be ''[[Nasu (Zoroastrianism)|nasu]]'', unclean, i.e. potential pollutants. Specifically, the corpse demon ([[Avestan]]: ''nasu.[[daeva]]'') was believed to rush into the body and contaminate everything it came into contact with,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brodd | first = Jefferey | authorlink = | title = World Religions | publisher = Saint Mary's Press | year = 2003 | location = Winona, MN | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-88489-725-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; hence the ''[[Vendidad]]'' (an ecclesiastical code "given against the demons") has rules for disposing of the dead as safely as possible.

To preclude the pollution of earth or fire (see [[Zam]] and [[Atar]] respectively), the bodies of the dead are placed atop a tower and so exposed to the sun and to scavenging birds. Thus, "[[putrefaction]] with all its concomitant evils... is most effectually prevented."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Modi|first=Jivanji Jamshedji Modi|title=The Funeral Ceremonies of the Parsees|year=1928|publisher=Anthropological Society of Bombay|url=http://www.avesta.org/ritual/funeral.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Zoroastrian [[ritual]] exposure of the dead is first known of from the writings of the mid-5th century BCE [[Herodotus]], who observed the custom amongst [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] expatriates in [[Asia Minor]]. In Herodotus' account (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' i.140), the rites are said to have been "secret", but were first performed after the body had been dragged around by a bird or dog. The corpse was then embalmed with wax and laid in a trench.&lt;ref name="Stausberg" /&gt;{{rp|204}}

While the discovery of ossuaries in both eastern and western Iran dating to the 5th and 4th centuries BCE indicates that bones were isolated, that this separation occurred through ritual exposure cannot be assumed: burial mounds,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Falk|first=Harry|title=Soma I and II|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies (BSOAS)|volume=52|issue=1|year=1989|pages=77–90|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00023077}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the bodies were wrapped in wax, have also been discovered. The tombs of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid emperors]] at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] and [[Pasargadae]] likewise suggest non-exposure, at least until the bones could be collected. According to legend (incorporated by [[Ferdowsi]] into his ''[[Shahnameh]]''), Zoroaster is himself interred in a tomb at [[Balkh]] (in present-day [[Afghanistan]]).

Writing on the culture of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Herodotus]] reports on the Persian burial customs performed by the [[Magi]], which are kept secret. However, he writes that he knows they expose the body of male dead to dogs and birds of prey, then they cover the corpse in wax, and then it is buried.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/herodotus-iii&lt;/ref&gt;

Towers are a much later invention, and are first documented in the early 9th century CE.&lt;ref name="Boyce_RBP" /&gt;{{rp|156–162}} The ritual customs surrounding that practice appear to date to the [[Sassanid]] era (3rd – 7th century CE). They are known in detail from the supplement to the ''[[Shayest ne Shayest]]'', the two ''[[Rivayat]]'' collections, and the two ''Saddar''s.

==Construction of Dakhma==
[[File:Tower of Silence (Yazd) 006.jpg|thumb|The central pit of the (now-defunct) tower of silence at Yazd, Iran.]]
The modern-day towers, which are fairly uniform in their construction, have an almost flat roof, with the perimeter being slightly higher than the centre. The roof is divided into three concentric rings: the bodies of men are arranged around the outer ring, women in the second circle, and children in the innermost ring. Once the bones have been bleached by the sun and wind, which can take as long as a year, they are collected in an [[ossuary]] pit at the centre of the tower, where – assisted by [[Limestone|lime]] – they gradually disintegrate, and the remaining material – with run-off rainwater – runs through multiple coal and sand filters before being eventually washed out to sea. The ritual precinct may be entered only by a special class of [[pallbearer]]s, called ''nusessalars'', a contraction of ''nasa.salar'', caretaker (''-salar'') of potential pollutants (''nasa-'').

==In modern times==

===In Iran===
[[File:Torre del silencio, Yazd, Irán, 2016-09-21, DD 65.jpg|thumb|Tower of Silence near [[Yazd]], Iran. The building is no longer in use.]]
[[File:Doodentoren van de Zoroastriërs.jpg|thumb|An early 20th century photograph of an Iranian tower of silence.]]

In the Iranian Zoroastrian tradition, the towers were built atop hills or low mountains in desert locations distant from population centers. In the early twentieth century, the Iranian Zoroastrians gradually discontinued their use and began to favour burial or [[cremation]].

The decision to change the system was accelerated by three considerations: the first problem arose with the establishment of the [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar ul-Funun]] medical school. Since Islam considers unnecessary dissection of corpses as a form of mutilation, thus forbidding it, there were no corpses for study available through official channels. The towers were repeatedly broken into, much to the dismay of the Zoroastrian community. Secondly, while the towers had been built away from population centers, the growth of the towns led to the towers now being within city limits. Finally, many of the Zoroastrians found the system outdated. Following long negotiations between the ''anjuman'' societies of [[Yazd]], [[Kerman]], and [[Tehran]], the latter gained a majority and established a cemetery some 10&amp;nbsp;km from Tehran at Ghassr-e Firouzeh (Firouzeh's Palace). The graves were lined with rocks and plastered with cement to prevent direct contact with the earth. In Yazd and Kerman, in addition to cemeteries, orthodox Zoroastrians continued to maintain a tower until the 1970s when ritual exposure was prohibited by law.

===In India===
[[File:BombayTempleOfSilenceEngraving.jpg|thumb|A late-19th-century engraving of a Zoroastrian Tower of Silence in [[Mumbai]].]]
Following the rapid expansion of the Indian cities, the squat buildings are today in or near population centers, but separated from the metropolitan bustle by gardens or forests. In [[Parsi people|Parsi]] Zoroastrian tradition, exposure of the dead is also considered to be an individual's final act of charity, providing the birds with what would otherwise be destroyed.

In the late 20th century and early 21st century the population of birds of prey on the Indian subcontinent declined (see [[Indian vulture crisis]]), by 99.9% as of 2008, primarily due to [[diclofenac]] poisoning of the birds following the introduction of that drug for livestock in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Tait |first=Malcolm |title=India's vulture population is facing catastrophic collapse and with it the sacrosanct corporeal passing of the Parsi dead |date=January 10, 2004 |publisher=The Ecologist |location=London |url=http://www.theecologist.org/archive_detail.asp?content_id=325 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223031/http://www.theecologist.org/archive_detail.asp?content_id=325 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David|last=Adam|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/conservation/story/0,,1698681,00.html| title=Cattle drug blamed as India's vultures near extinction|periodical=Guardian Unlimited| date=31 January, 2006|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; until banned for cattle by the Indian government in 2006.

Vultures used to dispose of a body in minutes, and no other method has proved fully effective.

The right to use the Towers of Silence is a much-debated issue among the Parsi community (see [[Parsi]] for details). The facilities are usually managed by the ''anjuman''s, the predominantly conservative local Zoroastrian associations (usually having five priests on a nine-member board). In accordance with Indian statutes, these associations have domestic authority over trust properties and have the right to grant or restrict entry and use, with the result that the associations frequently prohibit the use by the offspring of a "mixed marriage", that is, where one parent is a Parsi and the other is not.

== In popular culture ==
The musical duo [[Twenty One Pilots]] center the basis of their fifth LP ''[[Trench (album)|Trench]]'' around a fictional city known as "Dema" which is based on a Dakhma. Similarities between the two include the presence of vultures, dead bodies (skeletons) and the city taking the shape of an actual Dakhma, not to mention the name of the album itself comes from the very idea of the first version of Zoroastrian body disposal, thus, "Trench". The band even went as far as to include photos taken of / inside of a Dakhma on a [http://dmaorg.info/found/15398642_14/clancy.html cryptic website] that fans used to discover details about the forthcoming album, as well as promotional art.

'''Viktor Viktorovich Fokin '''(born February 19, 1935 in [[Novosibirsk]], [[RSFSR]] - 2003), known as the "'''Pensioner Maniac"''' and the "'''Grandfather Ripper'''", was a [[Russia|Russian]] [[serial killer]] who killed at least 10 people in between 1996 and 2000.

== Biography ==
Fokin was born in 1935. After graduating high school, he went to serve in the army, and began working at the Novosibirsk Semiconductor Devices Plant after his discharge. Fokin was a leader, and later became a labor veteran. In the later 1950s he married, and had children. His life turned around abruptly in 1988, when his wife died. By this time Fokin had aged considerably and suffered from [[hearing loss]], but had a great potency that attracted women to him. During this period, he tried to improve his personal life, but then began to have sex with cheap prostitutes, [[tramps]] and alcoholics. But by the mid-1990s, Fokin became [[impotent]], a factor which greatly worried him.

The first murder Fokin committed was in April 1996 (according to some sources in December 1995).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/142610.HTM Газета «Коммесантъ»]&lt;/ref&gt; He killed mostly women aged between 18 and 55 years, but the age did not matter much. As victims, he chose women and girls without a specific place of residence, mostly alcohol abusers and prostitutes, the choice being explained by the fact that nobody would look for these people if they disappeared. Fokin confessed that he asked his future victims for any relatives, and, as a rule, chose single women. Indeed, the remains of all nine known victims of Fokin were never identified and it was not possible to identify any of his ten known victims. The murder scenario was always the following: Fokin got acquainted with the victim in the Railway Square, brought them home, where he raped and mercilessly killed them. The murder methods were always different: some were strangled, others were drowned in the bathroom, and some stabbed. After the death of each victim, Fokin dismembered the corpse, and threw it in the garbage container.

The last murder Fokin committed was on March 5, 2000. Having dismembered a corpse in the bathroom, the remains were thrown into a trash container in Timiryazev Street near his home. During the day, a man came to the Zaeltsovskoye Police Department, who had found a bloody bag of sugar with human organs. Operative-search activities were carried out with an incredible scope: in the area where the dismembered body was found, hundreds of houses and thousands of apartments were inspected, there was intensive work with witnesses, external surveillance and ambushes were organized. Fokin was detained between March 7 and 15, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Точная дата в источниках не сообщается&lt;/ref&gt; When his house was searched, a lot of female items were found. At the first interrogation, he confessed to all his crimes.

The trial of Viktor Fokin took place in May 2001. The [[prosecutor]] demanded 20 years imprisonment. However, Fokin was sentenced to only 19 years imprisonment in a [[corrective labor colony]], where he died two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vn.ru/index.php?id=38822 Бердского маньяка приговорили к пожизненному сроку]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ya’furiyya Shia''' (named for Muhammad ibn Ya’fur, to whom they were related) was a ''[[ghulat]]'' sect of [[Shia Islam]]. The sect was also referred to as the Mu’ammariyya Shia. The Ya’furiyya believed in [[reincarnation]] and a man named Mu’ammar al-Kufi to be their Lord.
{{Shia Islam|Branches}}
==Beliefs==
The Ya’furiyya Shia had the following beliefs:
* They believed that the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imams]] after [[Muhammad]] were (in chronological order):
** [[Ali]], then 
** [[Hasan ibn Ali]], then
** When Hasan ibn Ali pledged allegiance to [[Muawiyah I]], the Imamate was taken away from him and given to [[Husayn ibn Ali]]
** [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin]]
** [[Muhammad al-Baqir]]
** The Ya’furiyya Shia do not know the names of the Imams after Muhammad al-Baqir, other than a few.
* They believed the world will always have an Imam and never be without one.
** They believed that anyone who denies and rejects the Imams (even one Imam) is an unbeliever.
** They believed that anyone who acknowledges and accepts all the Imams and knows their names is a believer. 
** They believed that anyone who acknowledges all the Imams but does not know all or some of their names is neither a believer nor an unbeliever.
* They believed that a man called Mu’ammar al-Kufi was their Lord.
** They did homage to Mu’ammar al-Kufi morning and evening.
** When Mu’ammar al-Kufi died, they said about him [[Jesus in Christianity|what the Christians say about Jesus]].
* They believed in [[Metempsychosis]].
** They believed the world will go on forever.
** They believed that Paradise is whatever befalls the people in this world in the way of well-being, blessings, possessions, money and fame.
** They believed that Hell is whatever befalls the people in this world in the way of diseases, ill-health, hardship and transmigration of spirits into the beasts, birds and insects. The Ya’furiyya’s proof for this belief of theirs was the words of God in the [[Quran]]: "There is not an animal that lives on the earth nor a creature that flies on its wings but forms a community that is like yours."
* They believed that [[adultery]], [[wine]], amusements and all the other things forbidden in Islam to be lawful. According to the Ya’furiyya, the reason why Muhammad forbade these amusements and rewards was to prevent the Muslims from then thinking that they had achieved their reward in its complete entirety. This would have then made the Muslims commit fewer acts that would be worthy of the true worldly rewards (by way of the distractions of the amusements and rewards), and more acts that would result in the worldly punishments and transmigration of spirits into beast and reptiles. It would have also required the Muslims to work harder and do more good deeds to maintain their deserving position of the worldly rewards.

The '''Yeti''' are a number of similar fictional [[Hidden Races (Marvel Comics)|hidden races]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

Yeti are fur-covered humanoid beings living in the Himalaya Mountains and familiarly known as "Abominable Snowmen." There are three known varieties of Yeti. 

The first, the so-called "Cold People," were highly intelligent and had made advanced scientific developments.  They were transformed into normal human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Fantastic Four #146&lt;/ref&gt;

A far more primitive race of Yeti with human intelligence first appeared in ''[[Man-Thing]]'' vol.2, #2, but was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Man-Thing vol. 2, #3&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a third race of Yeti was encountered by [[Shang-Chi]], and first appeared in ''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|Master of Kung Fu]]'' #124.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2501">'''Ziri ibn Manad''' or '''Ziri son of Mennad''' (died in 971) was the founder of the [[Zirid]] dynasty in the [[Maghreb|Berber world]].

Ziri ibn Mennad was a chief of the Takalata branch of the [[Sanhajah]] confederation, to which the [[Kutama]] Berbers belonged.&lt;ref name="Publishing2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Britannica Educational Publishing|title=The History of Northern Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dCcAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|date=1 October 2010|publisher=Britannica Educational Publishing|isbn=978-1-61530-397-7|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an ally of the [[Fatimids]], he defeated the rebellion of [[Abu Yazid]] (943–947), and was rewarded with the governorship of the western provinces, an area that roughly corresponds with modern [[Algeria]] north of the [[Sahara]].

Ziri had the residence of {{ill|Achir|fr}} built south of the future site of [[Algiers]] in 935. He summoned masons and joiners from [[M'Sila, Algeria|M'sila]] and [[Tubunae|Tubna]] to build the fortress , which once finished was filled with scholars, merchants and lawyers. He minted money and began to pay his troops in cash.&lt;ref name="Fossier1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Fossier|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1IhKYifENTMC&amp;pg=PA197|date=29 May 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-26645-1|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Buluggin ibn Ziri]] founded the cities of [[Algiers]], [[Miliana]] and [[Medea]] (Lamdiya), and rebuilt the settlements destroyed in the revolt. 

Ziri ibn Manad was killed in battle against the lord of [[M'Sila Province|M'sila]] (Ja'far Ibn 'Ali al-andalusi al-Maghrawi) in June-July 971.&lt;ref name="AkyeampongGates2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akyeampong|first1=Emmanuel Kwaku|last2=Gates|first2=Henry Louis|title=Dictionary of African Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA9|year=2012|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=978-0-19-538207-5|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded as governor by his son [[Buluggin ibn Ziri]], who in 972 became Viceroy of [[Ifriqiya]] (972–984) when the Fatimids transferred their court to [[Egypt]].
