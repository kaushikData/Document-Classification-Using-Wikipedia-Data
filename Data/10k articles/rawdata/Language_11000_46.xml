      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1129">In [[retailing]], '''90 days same as cash''' is a term used by [[retailer]]s to offer things which you can buy without paying any [[interest]] within those 90 days. It is a deferred payment on purchases.  If the payment becomes overdue interest would be charged from day one at the pre specified [[interest rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/90-days-same-as-cash-not-great-deal-960022|title=90 Days Same as Cash - Not the Good Deal It Seems to Be|work=The Balance|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of finance is usually offered by [[furniture]], [[consumer electronics]] and [[car]] retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pocketsense.com/90-days-same-cash-mean-10099.html|title=What Does "90 Days Same As Cash" Mean?|work=Pocket Sense|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others similar terms used are: 60 days same as cash, 30 days same as cash or interest free purchasing.

The '''air interface''', or '''access mode''', is the communication link between the two stations in [[mobile phone|mobile]] or [[wireless communication|wireless]] communication. The air interface involves both the [[Physical layer|physical]] and [[Data link layer|data link]] layers (layer 1 and 2) of the [[OSI model]] for a connection.

==Physical Layer==
The physical connection of an air interface is generally [[radio]]-based. This is usually a point to point link between an active [[base station]] and a [[mobile station]]. Technologies like [[Opportunity Driven Multiple Access]] (ODMA) may have flexibility regarding which devices serve in which roles. Some types of wireless connections possess the ability to broadcast or [[multicast]].

Multiple links can be created in limited spectrum through [[frequency division multiple access|FDMA]], [[time division multiple access|TDMA]], or [[space division multiple access|SDMA]]. Some advanced forms of transmission multiplexing combine frequency and time division approaches like [[orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|OFDM]] or [[code division multiple access|CDMA]].
In cellular telephone communications, the air interface is the radio-frequency portion of the circuit between the cellular phone set or wireless modem (usually portable or mobile) and the active base station. As a subscriber moves from one cell to another in the system, the active base station changes periodically. Each changeover is known as a handoff.Inverted F antenna use as mobile phone interface medium. In radio and electronics, an antenna (plural antennae or antennas), or aerial, is an electrical device which converts electric power into radio waves, and vice versa.[1] It is usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver. In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency (i.e. a high frequency alternating current (AC)) to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves).
An antenna focuses the radio waves in a certain direction. Usually, this is called the main direction. Because of that, in other directions less energy wil be emitted. The gain of an antenna, in a given direction, is usually referenced to an (hypothetical) isotropic antenna, which emits the radiation evenly strong in all directions. The antenna gain is the power in the strongest direction divided by the power that would be transmitted by an isotropic antenna emitting the same total power. In this case the antenna gain (Gi) is often specified in dBi, or decibels over isotropic. 
Other reference antennas are also used, especially: •gain relative to a half-wave dipole (Gd), when the reference antenna is a half-wave dipole antenna;
•gain relative to a short vertical antenna (Gv), when the reference antenna is a linear conductor, much shorter than one quarter of the wavelength.

==Data Link Layer==
The data link layer in an air interface is often divided farther than the simple [[Media access control]] (MAC) and [[Logical link control]] (LLC) sublayers found in other OSI terminology. While the MAC sublayer is generally unmodified, the LLC sublayer is subdivided into two or more additional sublayers depending on the standard. Common sublayers include; 
* [[Radio Link Control]] (RLC)
* [[PDCP|Packet Data Convergence Protocol]] (PDCP)
* [[Radio Resource Control]] (RRC)
  
Especially in mobile telecommunication and internet broadband Maximal combined input ratio with respect to signal to noise ratio estimation
1.The signals from each channel are added together

2.The gain of each channel is made proportional to the rms signal level and inversely proportional to the mean square noise level in that channel.

3.Different proportionality constants are used for each channel.

smart matrix array for combine input signal gain separated them with filters and different types of output  multiplexed schemes are used for approach to multiple users for example CDMA, FDMA, WCDMA, TDMA, ODMA etc.Such way calls and network services are approach and authenticate to unique subscriber.

[[Image:Thailand Post — Imprinted airmail etiquette EN TH (2006).jpg|right|thumb|Imprinted etiquette of Thailand]]
[[Image:Cover AAT 1959.jpg|thumb|This 1959 cover from the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]] has a plain dark blue airmail etiquette in the upper left corner.]]
An '''airmail etiquette''', often shortened to just '''etiquette''', is a label used to indicate that a letter is to be sent by [[airmail]]. The term is from French ''[[wikt:étiquette#French|étiquette]]'' "label, sticker" (cognate to ''stick''), from which also comes the English word [[etiquette]] "rules of behavior".

==Use==
Because the etiquettes are just instructions to postal clerks, and have no monetary value, their printing and distribution need not be as carefully controlled as for [[postage stamp]]s, and most are privately produced. The usual design is a plain blue oblong, with the phrases "AIR MAIL" and/or "PAR AVION" in white letters. Airlines and hotels have also produced etiquettes, some quite attractive.

The airmail etiquette may be omitted if airmail stamps are used on the letter, and in some cases even this is not necessary if a country sends out all its foreign mail by air. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, you may simply write "PAR AVION -- BY AIR MAIL" on the envelope,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Standard: How to send |publisher=[[Royal Mail]] |url=http://www.royalmail.com/personal/international-delivery/international-standard |accessdate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though etiquettes are available free from post offices.

'''Amami Island Sign''', or '''Amami Oshima Sign''' (Amami O Shima Sign, AOSL), is a [[village sign language]], or group of languages, on [[Amami Oshima]], the largest island in the [[Amami Islands]] of [[Japan]]. In {{illm|Koniya region|ja|古仁屋}} of the island, there exist a high incidence of congenital deafness, which is dominant and tends to run in a few families; moreover, the difficulty of the terrain has kept these families largely separated, so that there is extreme lexical geographical diversity across the island, and AOSL is therefore perhaps not a single language.

'''Baoulé''', also called '''Baule''' or '''Bawule''', is a [[Central Tano languages|Central Tano language]] spoken in [[Ivory Coast]].

The [[Baoulé people|Baoulé]] are an [[Akan people]] living in the central region of Ivory Coast. Baoulé-speaking areas include [[Bouaké]], [[Yamoussoukro]], [[Bouaflé]], [[Béoumi]], [[Sakassou]], [[Toumodi]], [[Dimbokro]], [[M'Bahiakro]], and [[Tiassalé]].

As an example of the language, the phrase "''Nyanmien Kpli lafiman''" means "God the Greatest never sleeps."

== Translations of the Bible ==
In 1946, portions of the [[Bible]] translated into Baoulé were first published; the full [[New Testament]] followed in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldscriptures.org/pages/baoule.html Baoulé at World Scriptures]&lt;/ref&gt; The complete Bible was published first in 1998, by the [[Bible Society]] in [[Abidjan]].
&lt;br&gt;
On August 10, 2018, the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures was released in Baoule. The New World Translation is published by the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and has been translated in whole or in part into more than 160 languages.

'''Biomics''' is the [[biology|biological]] study of [[biome]]s, and the processing of obtained information, such as [[ecology|ecological]] [[Community (ecology)|communities]] of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[Soil biology|soil organism]]s.

==Uses==
Biomics is part of [[biogeography]], [[ecosystem]]s, and [[habitat]]s research. [[Ecoregion]]s are grouped into both biomes and [[ecozone]]s.

Biomics, in [[molecular biology]], uses [[bioinformatics]] to collectively analyze diverse biome data. A biome may contain very large scale [[omics]] information, such as [[metagenome]] and [[pangenome]] where [[genomic sequence]]s are mass-produced.

'''Bohtan Neo-Aramaic''' is a modern Eastern [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Neo-Aramaic]] language, one of a number spoken by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. Originally, Bohtan Neo-Aramaic was spoken on the Plain of [[Bohtan]] in [[Şırnak Province]] of southeastern [[Turkey]] as well in the town of [[Gardabani]], near [[Rustavi]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Goygol (city)|Göygöl]] and [[Ağstafa]] in [[Azerbaijan]]. However it is now spoken in [[Moscow]], [[Krymsk]] and [[Novopavlovsk|Novopavlosk]], [[Russia]]. It is considered to be a dialect of [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] since it is a northeastern Aramaic language and its speakers are ethnically Assyrians.

== History ==
Before [[World War I]], there were around 30,000 speakers of Bohtan Neo-Aramaic on the Plain of [[Bohtan]], around the town of [[Cizre]] in [[Turkey]]'s [[Sirnak Province]]. Mostly members of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], their language was a northern dialect of the more common Assyrian languages, [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]], but already somewhat more conservative than the standard Alqosh dialect. With the [[Assyrian Genocide]] that hit the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] in eastern Turkey at the end of the war, many were forced from their homes.

A decimated population travelled from Bohtan and eventually resettled in Garbadani in southeastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], 530&amp;nbsp;km from their original home. Many of the speakers of Bohtan Neo-Aramaic are over sixty year of age. The younger generations tend to use [[Georgian language|Georgian]] or [[Russian language|Russian]] instead. According to recent studies, these communities have moved to Southern Russia, in the towns of Krymsk and Novopavlosk

== Genealogy ==
This dialect is derived from the Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA) languages, which is made up by Bohtan Neo-Aramaic, [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]], [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic|Chaldian Neo-Aramaic]], Hertevin, Senaya and Koy Sanjat Surat. Bohtan refers to the area between the Tigris and Bohtan river . The dialect mostly spoken by Christian communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/bhn ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neo-Aramaic language is classified under Afroasiatic and the Bohtan dialect is more specifically one of the NENA dialects which are found south-eastern Turkey, northern Iraq and western Iran &lt;ref&gt;Heinrichs, W. 1991: "Studies in Neo-Aramaic". ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' 111, 191-192&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the dislocation of NENA speakers, neighboring languages have influenced the dialects, such as [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]].&lt;ref&gt;Khan, G. 2010. "The Debate on Ergativity in Neo-Aramaic" ''Proceedings of IATL''&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the latest studies of the language was carried out by Samuel Ethan Fox in 1999, showing that Bohtan Neo-Aramaic has [[mutually intelligible|retained many conservative features]] of [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic|Chaldean]] and [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] which are not present in the standard [[Alqosh]] and [[Urmia]] dialects, but has also developed new features that are not present in other dialects.

== Status ==
Bohtan Neo-Aramaic is considered as a severely endangered language, mostly found in Belgium, France and the former Soviet Union. Due to migration and intermarriage, younger generations speak the language less fluently.

In Belgium, Mechelen there over 10,000 Assyro-Chaldeans who speak the Bohtan Neo-Aramaic.Which they pass on to their children.
Also in France, there over 35,000 Assyro-Chaldeans who speak Bohtan Neo-Aramaic.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6923">'''Bradford's law''' is a pattern first described by [[Samuel C. Bradford]] in 1934 that estimates the [[exponential decay|exponentially]] [[diminishing returns]] of searching for references in  [[science journal]]s. One formulation is that if journals in a field are sorted by number of articles into three groups, each with about one-third of all articles, then the number of journals in each group will be proportional to 1:n:n².&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Black |first=Paul E. 
|title=''Bradford's law'', in Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures 
|publisher=U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |date=2004-12-12 |url=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/bradfordsLaw.html |accessdate=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of related  formulations of the principle.

In many disciplines this pattern is called a [[Pareto distribution]]. As a practical example, suppose that a researcher has five core [[scientific journal]]s for his or her subject. Suppose that in a month there are 12 articles of interest in those journals. Suppose further that in order to find another dozen articles of interest, the researcher would have to go to an additional 10 journals. Then that researcher's Bradford multiplier ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is 2 (i.e. 10/5). For each new dozen articles, that researcher will need to look in ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; times as many journals. After looking in 5, 10, 20, 40, etc. journals, most researchers quickly realize that there is little point in looking further.

Different researchers have different numbers of core journals, and different Bradford multipliers. But the pattern holds quite well across many subjects, and may well be a general pattern for human interactions in social systems. Like [[Zipf's law]], to which it is related, we do not have a good explanation for why it works, but knowing that it does is very useful for librarians. What it means is that for each specialty it is sufficient to identify the "core publications" for that field and only stock those; very rarely will researchers need to go outside that set.

However its impact has been far greater than that. Armed with this idea and inspired by [[Vannevar Bush]]'s famous article ''[[As We May Think]]'', [[Eugene Garfield]] at the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] in the 1960s developed a comprehensive index of how scientific thinking propagates. His [[Citation index|Science Citation Index]] (SCI) had the effect of making it easy to identify exactly which scientists did science that had an impact, and which journals that science appeared in. It also caused the  discovery, which some did not expect, that a few journals, such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', were core for all of [[hard science]]. The same pattern does not happen with the humanities or the social sciences.

The result of this is pressure on scientists to publish in the best journals, and pressure on universities to ensure access to that core set of journals. On the other hand, the set of "core journals" may vary more or less strongly with the individual researchers, and even more strongly along schools-of-thought divides. There is also a danger of over-representing majority views if journals are selected in this fashion.

Bradford's law is also known as '''Bradford's law of scattering''' and as the '''Bradford distribution'''. This law or distribution in bibliometrics can be applied to the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turnbull |first=Don 
|title=Bibliometrics and the World Wide Web 
|publisher=University of Toronto Technical Report |year=1997 |url=http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~donturn/research/bibweb.html |accessdate=2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scattering==
Hjørland and Nicolaisen (2005, p.&amp;nbsp;103) identified three kinds of scattering:
#Lexical scattering. The scattering of words in texts and in collections of texts.
#Semantic scattering. The scattering of concepts in texts and in collections of texts.
#Subject scattering. The scattering of items useful to a given task or problem.

They found that the literature of Bradford's law (including Bradford's own papers) is unclear in relation to which kind of scattering is actually being measured.

==Law's interpretations==

The interpretation of Bradford's law in terms of a geometric progression was suggested by V. Yatsko &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/3q8305kq4154w846 Yatsko V. A. The Interpretation of Bradford’s Law in Terms of Geometric Progression IN: Automatic Documentation and Mathematical Linguistics, 2012, Vol. 46, No. 2, pp. 112–117.]&lt;/ref&gt; who introduced an additional constant and demonstrated that Bradford distribution can be applied to a variety of objects, not only to distribution of articles or citations across journals.  V. Yatsko's interpretation (Y-interpretation) can be effectively used to compute threshold values in case it is necessary to distinguish subsets within a set of objects (e.g. successful/unsuccessful applicants, developed/underdeveloped regions, etc.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51802">'''Cebuano grammar''' encompasses the rules that defines the [[Cebuano language]], a [[Visayan languages|Visayan language]] spoken in Cebu, Bohol, part of Leyte island, and the majority of Mindanao. 

Cebuano has eight basic parts of speech: [[noun]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[verb]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, [[Grammatical particle|particle]]s, [[preposition]]s and [[conjunctions]]. Cebuano is partially [[Inflected language|inflected]]: pronouns are inflected by number, and verbs are inflected for [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[Focus (grammar)|focus]], and [[Grammatical mood|mood]].

== Morphosyntactic alignment ==
Cebuano, along with many other Philippine languages, are sometimes considered ergative or nominative in alignment, both being incorrect and correct as it has features of both systems. See [[Austronesian alignment]].

=== Austronesian Alignment ===
Cebuano verbs are morphologically complex and take on a variety of affixes reflecting ''Voice'', ''Quality'', ''Aspect'', ''Mood'', and others. Cebuano arguably follows [[Austronesian alignment]]. Basically, verbs conjugate by using these affixes according to which [[Argument (linguistics)|argumentative role]] the noun in the direct case has. This noun in the direct case can be the doer of the action, the recipient of the action, the purpose for the action, or the means by which the action was made possible; which are all argumentative roles. The direct case hides the noun's otherwise-evident argumentative role, which the verb then makes up for by conjugating with specific affixes that indicate which argumentative role the noun in the direct case has. Some Cebuano grammar teachers call the noun in the direct case the ''Topic'' of the sentence, but some others call it the ''Focus, Voice,'' or ''Trigger''; as the verb and the other nouns in the sentence have all their noun markers and affixes change accordingly.  

'''Cebuano has four voices:'''  the Active Voice a.k.a. ''the Agent Trigger'', the Passive Voice for Direct Objects a.k.a. ''the Patient Trigger'', the Passive Voice for Indirect Objects and/or Locations a.k.a. ''the'' ''Circumstantial Trigger'', and the Passive Voice for Instruments a.k.a. ''the Instrument Trigger''.

The Circumstantial Trigger Affixes select for location, benefactee and/or goal topics.

'''The direct case morpheme, which marks the topic in Cebuano, is ''ang'' or ''si''.'''

'''Babaye''' is marked with '''sa''', the general ergative noun marker which indicates that '''babaye''' is not in the direct case but is still the agent of the sentence. Via context and common word order, it is evident that '''lata''' is not the agent despite it being marked with '''sa''' as well (but as the general oblique definite noun marker), because it is not the first noun in the sentence (which the agent usually is) and nor can a can cook rice (context).

|  ||  ||  || colspan="13" | (''or'' "Pedro will be cooked ''kalamay'' for by Maria.")
|}
Here, the indirect object or ''benefactee'' '''Pedro''' is marked with '''si''', the personal direct noun marker. The suffix '''-an''' indicates that the noun in the direct case ('''Pedro''') is also the indirect object of the action, which would not have been known otherwise. '''Maria''' is marked with the personal ergative noun marker '''ni''', which indicates that '''Maria''' is not the noun in the direct case but is still the agent of the sentence. '''Kalamay''' is marked with the general oblique indefinite marker '''og''', indicating that '''kalamay''' is neither the noun in the direct case nor the agent noun, but rather that it is the direct object.

|-
|  ||  ||  || colspan="13" | (''or'' "Perla will be written a letter to by Inday.")
|}
Here, it is similar to the ''Circumstantial Trigger'' (with benefactee subject) in that the goal subject '''Perla''' is also the indirect object of the sentence. It is also marked by '''si''', the personal direct noun marker, and it is known to be the indirect object of the sentence thanks to the verb suffix '''-an''' indicating that the noun in the direct case would be the indirect object of the sentence.

|  || colspan="13" | "Linda will write a letter with the pencil."
|-
|  || colspan="13" | (''or'' "The pencil will be written a letter with by Linda.")
|}
Here, the instrument '''lapis''' is marked with '''ang''', the general direct noun marker. The prefix '''I-''' indicates that the noun in the direct case ('''lapis''') is also the instrument used to complete the action, which would not have been known otherwise. '''Linda''' is marked with the personal ergative noun marker '''ni''', which indicates that '''Linda''' is not the noun in the direct case but is still the agent of the sentence. '''Sulat''' is marked with the general oblique indefinite marker '''og''', indicating that '''sulat''' is neither the noun in the direct case nor the agent noun, but rather that it is the direct object.

==Pronouns==

===Personal pronouns===
Pronouns are inflected for person, number and case. No [[Gender-specific pronoun|gender distinctions]] are made for the third person singular: ''he'' and ''she''  are both translated in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] as ''siya''.
&lt;!-- 
Preserved the "original" word. The next sentence in not gerund to pronouns.
Pronouns are inflected in person, number and case but nouns are not. Case marker instead define the function of nouns, verbs and modifiers (adjectives and adverbs) in the sentence. --&gt;

The three cases are [[Direct case|direct]], [[Ergative case|ergative]] and [[Oblique case|oblique]].

|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; - ''Ta'' only when the object is the second person singular, i.e., ''ka'', ''mo'', etc. For example, ''Nakita ta ka'', NOT ''*Nakita ko ka''.

====Usage of full and short forms====
The short forms are used most often in conversation. However, the full forms ''must'' be used when they occur on their own as a predicate.

Examples (Those marked with an asterisk, "*", are ungrammatical):

 Ako si Juan. ''I am John.''
 *Ko si Juan.
 &lt;BR&gt;
 Kamo'y moadto ngadto sa Banawa. ''You (plu.) are going to Banawa.''
 *Mo'y moadto ngadto sa Banawa.

But...
 Ako si Juan.
 Ako mao'y moadto ngadto sa Banawa.

====First person plural: clusivity====
In Cebuano, like most other [[Austronesian languages]], the first person plural forms encode [[clusivity]]. This distinction, not found in most [[Languages of Europe|European languages]], signifies whether or not the addressee is included.

Examples:
 Moadto '''mi''' sa eskuwelahan.&lt;br&gt;
 '''''We''' (someone else and I but not you) will go to school.''
 &lt;br&gt;
 Moadto '''ta''' sa eskuwelahan.&lt;br&gt;
 '''''We''' (you and I and perhaps someone else) will go to school.''

==Demonstratives==
Cebuano demonstratives are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"

|nganha
|diha

|-
|'''Distal'''
(remote)
|kadto
|to
|niadto
|adto
|ngadto
|didto
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; When the demonstrative is used as a predicate, the full form must be used.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; Both forms, those beginning with 'ng-' and those with 'd-', are interchangeable and correspond to the deictives below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;†&lt;/nowiki&gt; Although not represented in the orthography, forms in this row end in a glottal stop:&lt;br&gt;'''kana''' /kanaˀ/, '''na''' /naˀ/, '''niana''' /niˀanaˀ/, '''nganha''' /ŋanhaˀ/, '''diha''' /dihaˀ/, '''dinha''' /dinhaˀ/.

Examples:

Unsa '''kini/ni'''?&lt;br&gt;
''What's this?''
 
Kinsa '''kana/na'''?&lt;br&gt;
''Who is that?''
 
Gikan '''ni'''ng sulata sa Presidente sa Pilipinas.&lt;br&gt;
''This letter is from the President of the Philippines''
 
Mangaon sila '''didto'''.&lt;br&gt;
''They will eat there.''
 
Nikaon '''kadto'''ng mga tawo ug mga bata '''didto''' sa piyesta/pista.&lt;br&gt;
''Those people and children ate/eat/are eating at the feast.''

==Adverbs==

===Deictics===
Deictics, words such as ''here'' and ''there'', reference locations between the speaker and addressee. In addition to the same four-way distinction of proximity for demonstratives (''near speaker'', ''near speaker and addressee'', ''near addressee'' and ''remote''), deictics can express three tenses:

* '''Present''': "X is here/there now"
* '''Past''': "X was here/there"
* '''Future''': "X will be here/there"

The present and future tense forms can precede or follow the words or phrases they modify by linking with '''nga'''. The past tense forms, however, only have a past meaning if they precede their words or phrases. If they follow, they convey no tense.

The 'ng-' forms are always tenseless. They follow the words or phrases they modify and can substitute equivalent past forms. In addition, they show movement or motion to the relative location which past forms cannot.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! &amp;nbsp; !! Present Tense !! Past Tense !! Future Tense!! Tenseless (D-) !! Tenseless (NG-)

Examples:
 Dia diri ang bata.
 ''The child is over here.''
 &amp;nbsp;
 Toa si lolo sa Amerika.
 ''Grandfather is in America.''
 &amp;nbsp;
 Dinhi ang Doktor gahapon.
 ''The doctor was here yesterday.''
 &amp;nbsp;
 Adto siya sa Maynila.
 ''She is in Manila.''
 &amp;nbsp;
 Nidagan ang bata ngadto sa balay niya.
 ''The child ran there (thither) to his/her house.''

==Nouns==
Cebuano nouns fall into of two classes: '''personal''' and '''general'''. Personal nouns refer to persons or personified objects and animals and names. All other nouns fall into the general category. Nouns do not inflect for case or number: Case is shown using case markers; the plural number is show with the particle '''mga'''.

===Case===
Cebuano nouns assume three cases based on their role in a sentence:
* '''[[Direct case|Direct]]''' - This is the case of the predicative nominal and the subject of such phrases. It is the case used for the topic of transitive verbs.
* '''[[Ergative case|Ergative]]''' - This is the case of the actor or agent in non-actor focus verb forms and the case of possession and roles of the [[genitive]] case.
* '''[[Oblique case|Oblique]]''' - A peripheral case, this is the case of the direct object of actor-focus verbs. It is used when the case relationship is non-core, i.e., neither ergative nor direct in nature.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class !! Direct !! Ergative !! Oblique
|-
| '''General''' || ang || sa || sa (definite) &lt;br&gt;og (indefinite)
|-
|'''General'''
'''Plural'''
|ang mga
|sa mga
|sa mga (definite)
og mga (indefinite)
|-
| '''Personal''' || si || ni || kang
|-
|'''Personal'''
'''Plural'''
|sila si
silang
|nila ni
nilang
|kanila ni
kanilang
|}

The use of '''sa''' VS. '''og''' in the oblique case is a matter of definiteness when the noun is the object of an actor-focus verb. Compare the following examples.

#[Definite] '''Nipalit/Mipalit si Juan ''sa'' sakyanan.''' ''John bought '''the''' car.''
#[Indefinite] '''Mipalit si Juan ''og'' sakyanan.''' ''John bought '''a''' car''

In example sentence 1, the car that John bought is particular. It may have been a car he was thinking about buying or one that the speaker was selling John. In 2, the speaker may or may not know the specifics about the car in question.

===Number===
Plurality is shown by preceding the noun with the particle '''mga''' /maŋa/.

There are special cases though:

1. Adding the prefix ''ka-'' before and the suffix ''-an'' can pluralize a noun (the suffix ''-han'' is used if the root word ends with a vowel). This word treatment is used to group what are considered identical objects as one entity. Examples are:
*''libot'' which is regularly used as a verb meaning ''to go around'' but in this case as a noun meaning "surrounding" (as in ''palibot'') can be changed to ''kalibotan'' which means "world" (or 'the entire surroundings').
*''tawo'' which means "man" or "person" can be changed to ''katawhan'' which means "men" or "people". The vowel "o" was omitted in this case because the "w" carries the sound of "o" by itself.
*''balay'' (house): ''kabalayan'' (houses)
*''bata'' (child/boy/girl): ''kabataan''. This word is an exception to the rule, as the suffix ''-an'' instead of ''-han'' is used. 
*"nasod" (nation): "kanasoran" (nations). The "d" changed to "r" because that usually (not always) happens to "d" when placed between two vowels, though in Cebuano, ''d'' and ''r'' are not allophones, unlike in other Philippine languages.

Although it is tolerable in some cases, the use of ''mga'' before a noun applied with ''ka- -an'' is not necessary anymore. ''ang mga kabataan'' (the children) is considered redundant, and ''ang kabataan'' is more grammatically accurate.

Because the use of ''ka- -an'' groups objects into one entity, there are cases that a word will mean a place of which the objects are frequently or usually found/exist. An example is:
*''kasagingan'' (from the root word ''saging'' (banana)) does not mean "bananas". Instead, it means 'a place of bananas' or simply "banana farm".

2. There is this very rare case of which an adjective can be pluralized and the noun it described can be, but not necessarily, omitted.
Example: the word ''gamay'' ('small') can be changed to ''gagmay'' ('small ones')in which "g" was inserted in between. The same can be applied to ''dako'' which means 'big', changing it to ''dagko'' (big ones). Other examples are:
*''taas'' (long): ''tag-as'' (long ones)
*''mubo'' (short): ''mugbo'' (short ones)
*''layo'' (far): ''lagyo'' (far ones)
*''du-ol'' (near): ''dug-ol'' (near ones)

This rule cannot be applied to all other adjectives.

===Gender===
As a rule, Cebuano does not categorize nouns by gender. Natural gender are found in Spanish loans.

==Adjectives==

===Plural forms===
Adjectives do not inflect for the plural. Common adjectives of measurement, however, have a plural form characterized by the infixation of /g/.&lt;ref name=studynotes&gt;{{cite web|last=Marking|first=Tom|title=Cebuano Study Notes|url=http://www.tomandcathymarking.com/cebuano/CebuanoStudyNotes.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717070526/http://www.tomandcathymarking.com/cebuano/CebuanoStudyNotes.pdf|archivedate=17 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| ''small''|| gamay|| gagmay
|-
| ''far''|| layo|| lagyo
|-
| ''short''|| mubo|| mugbo
|-
| ''tall''|| taas|| tag-as
|}

===Comparative===
In comparing two similar items, the [[comparative]] form indicates that one has a higher degree (or lower degree) of the quality expressed by the root, e.g., ''bigger'', ''smaller'', ''greater'', etc.

The comparative degree is expressed in the following ways:
* Precede the adjective with '''labi pa''' "''more (still)''"
* Precede the adjective with the particle '''mas''' (from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''más'')

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! colspan="3"|dako ''big''
|-
! Method !! Form !! Gloss
|-
| labi pa|| '''labi pang dako'''|| bigger
|-
| mas|| '''mas dako'''|| bigger
|}

===Comparative superlative===
The comparative [[superlative]] indicates the maximum degree of the quality expressed in comparison to other items. In Cebuano this degree can be expressed by a prefix, '''pinaka-''' or by the use of the particle '''labi''' (''most'').

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! colspan="3"| dako ''big''
|-
! Method !! Form !! Gloss
|-
| pinaka- || '''pinakadako''' || biggest
|-
| labi || '''labing dako'''|| biggest
|}

===Absolute superlative===
The absolute superlative is the form used in exclamations, for example, "''How pretty you are!''", and denote the extreme quality of the root.

It is formed by prefixing '''Pagka-''' or '''Ka-''' (short form) to the root. The subject follows in the ''[[Oblique case|oblique]]''.

Examples:
 '''Pagkanindot kanimo!''' (Full)
 '''Kanindot nimo!''' (Short)
 ''How pretty you are! You are extremely pretty!''

===Intensive===
To express intensity, adjectives are followed by ''''kaayo'''' (''very'').

Examples:
 Ang mga dwendey mubo '''kaayo'''.
 ''Dwarves are'' very ''short''.

==Linkers==

===Nga===
The linker '''nga''' (pronounced /ŋa/) shows the relationship between [[Grammatical modifier|modifiers]] to the [[Head (linguistics)|head]] of the phrase. Examples of such relationships are [[adjective]]-[[noun]], [[clause]]-noun, [[adverb]]-[[verb]], adverb-adjective and noun-noun. Without the intervening linker, juxtaposition of modifier and head can constitute, not a phrase, but a sentence unto itself. 
Compare the phrase '''"ang batang lalaki"''' ''the/a young man/boy'' and the sentence '''"ang bata lalaki"''' ''the child is male'' or ''the child is a boy''.

After words that end in a [[monophthong]], [[diphthong]] or ''-n'', '''nga''' is reduced to '''-ng''' /-ŋ/.

Unlike [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], '''nga''' is not used with numbers; '''ka''' below is used instead.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Example
!Gloss
|-
| balay nga bato
balay'ng bato

|-
| balay nga nipa

balay'ng kahoy
| wooden house
|-
| dako nga balay
dakong balay
| big house
|-
| gamay nga balay
gamay'ng balay
| small house
|}

===Ka===
The linker '''ka''' is used to link a number and the phrase it modifies. '''Buok''' ''whole'' is sometimes used with '''ka'''.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Example 1 !! Example 2 !! Gloss
|-
| usa ka bata || usa ka buok bata|| one child
|-
| walo ka semana || walo ka buok semana|| eight weeks
|-
| duha ka tasa || duha ka buok tasa || two cups
|}

==Enclitic particles==

# ''ba'': used for yes-and-no questions and optionally for other types of questions.
# ''gayud/gyud'':&lt;ref name="gyud pronunciation"&gt;''Gyud'' is pronounced as either [dʒud], [gjud], or [gud]. In informal communications, it is also occasionally written as ''g&amp;#146;ud'' (often ''gud'' or ''jud'')&lt;/ref&gt; indeed; used in affirmations or emphasis.
# ''kay'': because. NB: "kay" is also used as "is" or "are" in sentences with Subject-Predicate structure
# ''lang/ra/da'': limiting particle; just, only.
# ''man'': even, even if, even though, although
# ''na'': now, already (past positive tense), anymore (past negative tense)
# ''pa'': still, else
# ''ug'': and
# ''usab'',&lt;ref name="u drop"&gt;The ''u'' in ''usab'' and ''upod'', as in many other words beginning with ''u'', are frequently dropped, making it ''&amp;#146;sab'' and ''&amp;#146;pod''; in spoken Cebuano, ''&amp;#146;sad'' is often used instead of ''&amp;#146;sab''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''upod'':&lt;ref name="u drop" /&gt; also

''Na'' and ''pa'' are not used in the same sentence.

==Interrogatives==
*''Unsa?''                        What?
*''Asa?''                         Where? (for a place or person)
*''Diin?'', ''Dis-a?''            Where?
*''Hain?'', ''Saa/Asa?''              Where? (for an object)
*''Kinsa?''                       Who?
*''Ngano?''                       Why?
*''Kang'kinsa?''                  To whom?
*''Giunsa?''                      How? (past)
*''Unsaon?''                      How? (future)
*''Kanus-a?''                     When?
*''Pila ka buok?'', ''Pila?''     How many?
*''Tagpila?''                     How much?
*''Diay ba?''                     Really?

The word ''asa'' and ''hain'':

''Asa'' and ''hain''&amp;mdash;both mean ''where''&amp;mdash;have distinct uses in formal Cebuano usage.

''Asa'' is used when asking about a place.
*''Asa ka padulong?'' (Where are you going?)
*''Asa ta molarga?'' (Where are we traveling to?)

''Hain'' is used when asking about a food or thing.
*''Hain na ang gunting?'' (Where is the pair of scissors?)
*''Hain na ang pagkaon sa piyasta/pista?'' (Where is the food for the festival)

In spoken Cebuano, however, ''asa'' is commonly used to replace ''hain''. In fact, ''hain'', except by older generations, is rarely used.

==Verbs==

=== Verb Roots vs. Verb Stems ===
A ''Verb Root'' is the simplest version of a verb that cannot be broken down further (excluding morphological processes and colloquial speech) and conveys its overall meaning or lemma. Affixes for the ''Voices'', ''Moods'', ''Forms'', and ''Aspects'' may not be added to the ''Verb Root'', only to the ''Verb Stem''. Sometimes, the ''Verb Stem'' is identical to the ''Verb Root,'' while other times, the ''Verb Stem'' is created through the addition of certain affixes not related to the affixes of the ''Voices'', ''Moods'', ''Forms'', and ''Aspects''. A commonly known stem affix could be ''pa+'', added to the beginning of a ''Verb Stem'' or ''Verb Root'' in order to convey the meaning ''to cause''. For example, ''padala'' is the ''Verb Stem'' which means ''to send'' while ''dala'' is its own ''Verb Stem'' which means ''to bring'', concluding that ''padala'' could literally mean ''to cause to bring''. Another commonly known affix is ''hi+'' which is added to ''Verb Stems'' in the ''Stative Form'' so that the verb may take in a ''Direct Object'', as verbs in the ''Stative Form'' would not be able to take in a Direct Object without it.

=== Aspect, Form, Mood, and Tense ===
Verbs in Cebuano conjugate not only according to the ''Topic'' of the sentence, but also to the ''Mood'', the ''Form'', and the ''Tense'', more accurately described as the ''Aspect'', of the action. Cebuano verbs conjugate accordingly through the addition of affixes to the ''verb stem''.

==== Mood ====
There are three ''Moods'' that the verb may conjugate to in the Cebuano language. The three moods are:

===== The Indicative Mood =====
This is the default mood of verbs in which the action is most commonly described. This mood ''does'' have imperative "aspects" in certain ''Forms''.

===== The Mirative Mood =====
This is the mood where the action is unexpected or unintended. There is no imperative "aspect" for this mood. This mood is a little differently used in Cebuano than its usual use, see [[Mirative|Mirative Mood]]. Some also consider to describe this mood as [[Dubitative mood|Dubitative]] or [[Subjunctive mood|Subjunctive]].

===== The Potential Mood =====
This is the mood where the action is able to happen or allowed to happen. This mood may also be used to convey a statement or general possibility. There is no imperative "aspect" for this mood.

The prefixes ''naka+'' and ''maka+'' (mostly used for this mood) may be shortened to ''ka+'' in colloquial speech and in colloquial writing, which may get rid of the aspect within the prefixes. This could be similar to ''naga+'' and ''maga+'' being shortened to ''ga+'', see below.

====Form====
There are four ''Forms'' that the verb may conjugate to in the Cebuano language. The four forms are:

===== The Transitory Form =====
This is the form where the action was, is, or will be instantly completed. This form is also the form where the action may just be a statement and can be somewhat neutral in meaning.

===== The Durative Form =====
This is the form where the action takes place over a not-always-specific duration of time. See [[Delimitative aspect|Durative Aspect]].

===== The Stative Form =====
This is the form where the action is expressing the state of being something is in or its condition or even its emotion. This mood also may express a change going on within something. Usually, verbs that express this mood do not have ''Direct Objects'' unless the prefix ''hi+'' is added to the original ''Verb Stem''. This addition forms another ''Verb Stem'' which now allows the verb to have a ''Direct Object''.

===== The Reciprocal Form =====
This is the form where the action is being reciprocated between two persons/things to each other.

==== Tense vs. Aspect ====
Cebuano generally does not use ''Tense'', rather it uses ''Aspect''. Cebuano verbs conjugate according to the ''Voice'', the ''Mood'', the ''Form'', and the ''Aspect''. According to the functionalist school of grammar, there are two aspects: the "nasugdan" ([[Inchoative aspect|Incepted]] [Past/Present Inchoative]) aspect and the "pagasugdan" ([[Inchoative aspect|Incepting]] [Future/Habitual Inchoative]) aspect. They claim that Cebuano verbs have the [[Inchoative aspect|aspect of inception]]; that is whether the action has been initiated or not. 

The "nasugdan" aspect is the aspect where the action had already started in the past, while the "pagasugdan" aspect is the aspect where the action has not started yet. Basically, past and present actions are in the "nasugdan" aspect while future actions and habitual actions are in the "pagasugdan" aspect. Although habitual actions started in the past, they have yet to start again. Hence, they are in the "pagasugdan" aspect.

The ''[[Imperative mood|"Imperatibo]]"'' (Imperative/Command) mood is commonly grouped together with these aspects (and not with the other moods) because there are multiple imperatives of the same verb that exist according to which ''Form'' is in use.

In Cebuano, verbs conjugate for ''[[Affirmation and negation|Negatibo]]'' (negative) sentences. However, the verb itself is not negative, it just ''[[Agreement (linguistics)|agrees]]'' with the negative words ''wala'' and ''dili'' through "negatibo" verb affixes. ''Wala'' is used for the ''Nasugdan'' aspect and ''Dili'' is used for the ''Pagasugdan'' aspect. ''Ayaw'' is used as the negative imperative, see [[Imperative mood|Prohibitive mood]].

=== Verb Affixes for Voice, Mood, Form, and Aspect ===
Verb Affixes for Voice, Mood, Form, and Aspect may overlap. Some of these affixes are shortened in speech and informal writing.

Not all groups of affixes can be used for some verbs; some verbs may not make sense with certain groups of affixes. For example, the verb stem ''anhi'', which generally means ''to come'',  cannot have any of the passive voices' affixes. The only way to know which groups of affixes are able to be used for each verb stem are through memorization, online lists, or experience of each verb stem one comes across. In addition to that, in certain verbs, the affixes take on different meanings and overlap with other ''Forms'' due to historical use. For example, the verb stem ''buak'', ''to break'', uses the same affixes of the ''Potential Mood'' as the ''Transitory Form'' in the ''Indicative Mood''. Using the literal affixes of the ''Transitory Form'' in the ''Active Voice'' for ''buak'' would sound incorrect to native speakers. For the most part, the way the affixes are labeled are the way they are used. Exceptions can be learned through experience. 

Now, here is the more in-depth list of all of the ''proper, grammatical'' affixes used for each voice:

==== Active Voice Affixes ====
The ''Active Voice'' in Cebuano (a.k.a. ''the Agent Trigger'') is the Voice where the ''Topic'' of the sentence is the ''Agent'' (a.k.a. ''the Doer, the Subject, the Actor'') of the sentence. The verb partly conjugates according to the fact that the ''Agent'' is the ''Topic''. All ''Active Voice Affixes'' are actually prefixes.

These affixes not only have the essence that they are instantaneous, but they also have the essence of intention; that the topic willed for it to happen. It also has the essence of motion or movement. The prefix '''mi+''' is more formal than '''ni+;''' otherwise, they are interchangeable. It is common to use '''pag+''' because it is a common imperative affix in the Active Voice in Cebuano.

With verb stems like ''adto'', '''mo+''' may sometimes be used as the "nasugdan" aspect because although it started in the past and may still be going on, the destination may not have been reached yet. ''Adto'' also means ''to go'', and when used in the present tense, it is understandable that it may use '''mo+''' for a "nasugdan" aspect.

The prefixes '''naga+''' and '''maga+''' may be shortened to '''ga+''' in colloquial speech and in colloquial writing, which may indicate a lack of aspect but it still preserves the form. Some argue that the difference between '''nag+''' and '''mag+''' versus '''naga+''' and '''maga+''' are either in formality ('''naga+''' and '''maga+''' being more formal) or in tense ('''naga+''' being more in the present and '''nag+''' being more in the past, while '''maga+''' and '''mag+''' are interchangeable).

The prefixes '''naka+''' and '''maka+''' may be shortened to '''ka+''' in colloquial speech and in colloquial writing, which may get rid of the aspect within the prefixes. This could be similar to '''naga+''' and '''maga+''' being shortened to '''ga+'''.

Plurality depends on whether the topic is a plural noun. The topic may be the subject, the object, etc., however, because this is the Active Voice, the topic should always be the Subject with these plural affixes. As long as the subjects are plural, the plural version is usually used, but this is not always mandatory. Some verbs only use the plural version while other verbs are rarely used in their plural versions. 

'''*''' The "ng" in '''nang+''' and '''mang+''' may change to "m" or "n" or delete the next consonant depending on the succeeding consonant. Refer to the ''Morphological Process of Assimilation'' in Cebuano for more information. 

Sometimes '''pang+''' is used as the plural version of the imperatibo mood.

The ''Stative Form'' does not have a ''Potential Mood''. The '''hi+''' prefix before '''gugma''' is necessary for the verb to take in a direct object, so the "imperatibo examples" would imply a direct object. The '''nagka+''' and '''magka+''' prefixes are different from the '''na+''' and '''ma+''' in that they have the essence of a slowly but surely, or steady, change that is occurring within the topic. They are not used as often anymore, so the same essence may be achieved with the '''na+''' and '''ma+''' prefixes nowadays. However, '''pagka+''' just has more emphasis than '''ka+''' may have, and '''pagka+''' is still commonly used today. The ''Mirative Mood'' with the '''nagka+''' and '''magka+''' prefixes is no longer known nor used. The plural prefixes '''nang+''' and '''mang+''' become '''nanga+''' and '''manga+''' if the verb also includes these prefixes: '''na+''', '''ma+''', and '''ka+'''. For example, "'''Nangahigugma kami kanimo.'''" which means "'''We love you.'''"

The ''Reciprocal Form'' does not have a ''Potential Mood''. This form is not in common use anymore.

==== Passive Voice for Direct Objects Affixes ====
The ''Passive Voice for Direct Objects'' in Cebuano (a.k.a. ''the Patient Trigger'') is the Voice where the ''Topic'' of the sentence is the ''Direct Object'' (a.k.a. ''the Patient, the Goal, etc.'') of the sentence. So the verb partly conjugates accordingly.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''Imnon''' and '''Imna''' went through some of the ''Morphological Processes'' in Cebuano. The ''Mirative'' and ''Potential Moods'' are the same for these forms of affixes. In the ''"negatibo aspect,"'' the ergative personal pronouns are usually put before the verb. A noun in the ergative case, or a proper noun in the ergative case, would both be put after the verb. For example, "'''Dili imnon sa iring ang gatas.'''" which means "'''The milk will not be drunk by the cat.'''"
==== Passive Voice for Indirect Objects Affixes ====
The ''Passive Voice for Indirect Objects'' in Cebuano (a.k.a. ''the Circumstantial Triggers'') is the Voice where the ''Topic'' of the sentence is the ''Indirect Object'' (a.k.a. ''the Benefactee, the Location, the Goal, etc.'') of the sentence. So the verb partly conjugates accordingly.

|-

|-
|imperatibo
|'''+i'''
|'''Kuhai (nimo) ang iro og regalo!''' (You,) Get a gift &lt;u&gt;''for the dog''&lt;/u&gt;!
|}
In the examples, the topic is the dog (the ''Indirect Object'') and it is used as the topic to emphasize that the dog got the gift, nothing else. In context, a person may say this to you when you are confused about whom/what you should get the gift for. Perhaps there is a cat and a dog and the person clarifies that you got/get/will get/should get a gift for the dog (not the cat).

|}

==== Passive Voice for Instruments Affixes ====
The ''Passive Voice for Instruments'' (a.k.a. ''the Instrumental Trigger'') is the Voice where the ''Topic'' of the sentence is the ''Instrument'' of the sentence. The ''Instrument'' is the noun that is used for the action of the sentence.

|-

|'''Iabli nato ang yawi og pultahan (para) *og amo.''' ''&lt;u&gt;With a key&lt;/u&gt;'', we (including listener) will open a door for a boss.
|-
|imperatibo
|'''i+'''
|'''Iabli (nato) ang yawi og pultahan (para) *og amo!''' ''&lt;u&gt;With a key&lt;/u&gt;'', (let's [Including Listener]) open a door for a boss!
|}
The prefix '''gi+''' may also be used/confused as ''Both the Transitory &amp; Durative Forms'' in the ''Passive Voice of Direct Objects''.

The prefixes '''i+''' and '''i+''' may be confused as one another but context will be sufficient for distinction.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; In context, the key usually cannot open the boss. However, if you want to be creative and say we opened the boss for the door, "para" or "alang" can be added before the indirect object to mean "for". Through context, "para" and "alang" and other prepositions for "for" are unnecessary. The "sa" marker may replace either or both of the "og" markers for definiteness and/or distinction. The "og" disappears if "para" or "alang" is used, but if "sa", "ni", or "kang" is there instead, "sa", "ni", and "kang" may stay.

There are over 1000 different verbs in Cebuano to choose from and to use. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Cebuano_verbs|title=Category:Cebuano verbs - Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many more affixes that can be used for verb roots, verb stems, and new words.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2472">'''Ebrahim Zalzadeh''' (c. 1948 – February 22, 1997) was a dissident Iranian author and editor who was murdered in 1997 in what is thought to have been one of the "[[Chain murders of Iran|chain murders]]" of dissidents by "rogue elements" in [[Ministry of Intelligence of Iran|Iran's intelligence ministry]].

Zalzadeh was editor of the [[Iran]]ian literary monthly ''Mayar'' (also spelled ''Me'yer''), a publication that frequently criticized Iranian government [[censorship]] practices against the media, and was forced to close by the authorities in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpj.org/deadly/1997_list.html CPJ. Journalists Killed in 1997: Ebrahim Zalzadeh, Mayar, February 22, 1997, Tehran ]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the director of the publishing house Ebtekar.

Zalzadeh disappeared on February 22, 1997 and was identified in a [[Tehran]] morgue on March 29.&lt;ref name="cpj.org"&gt;[http://www.cpj.org/deadly/1997_list.html CPJ Journalists Killed in 1997: Ebrahim Zalzadeh, Mayar, February 22, 1997, Tehran ]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the coroner's report, his body was discovered half-buried and with multiple stab wounds in the chest, on or about February 24 by a road in the outskirts of Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newseum.org/scripts/Journalist/Detail.asp?PhotoID=1196 Freedom Forum Jourists Memorial EBRAHIM ZALZADEH ]&lt;/ref&gt; He was in a Tehran morgue on March 29,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran.org/humanrights/UN971015.htm Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt; 35 days after he had been reported missing.

"Zalzadeh was one of several Iranian writers and publishers who had volunteered to share the punishment of magazine editor [[Abbas Maroufi]], who was sentenced in January 1996 to six months in prison and 35 [[Flagellation|lashes]] for criticizing the government."&lt;ref name="cpj.org"/&gt;

== Definition ==
In her article, "Embodied Writing: A Tool for Teaching and Learning in Dance", dance theorist Betsy Cooper defines embodied writing as:
{{quote|vividly descriptive writing inclusive of an array of sensory mechanisms such that a kinesthetic and visceral experience unfolds during the act of writing and a sympathetic response ensues for the reader.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}

Psychologist Rosemarie Anderson also describes embodied writing:
{{quote|Embodied writing seeks to reveal the lived experience of the body by portraying in words the finely textured experience of the body and evoking sympathetic resonance in readers. Introduced into the research endeavor in an effort to describe human experience-- and especially [[Transpersonal experience|transpersonal experiences]]-- more closely to how they are truly lived, embodied writing is itself an act of embodiment, entwining in words our senses with the senses of the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;}}

== Practices ==
Certain psychologists utilize embodied writing as a practice of putting the experience of the body into words to connect to it more deeply. Some link this to meditative practices&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[dance theory]], choreographic writing (a form of embodied writing) is done by imagining words as dancing across a page &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14647893.2014.971230?journalCode=crid20|title=Embodied writing: choreographic composition as methodology|last=Ulmer|first=Jasmine|date=2015|website=Research in Dance Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others use forms of [[yoga]] to more deeply connect the body to the writing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1220&amp;context=jaepl|title=Writing Yogis: Breathing Our Way to Mindfulness and Balance in Embodied Writing Pedagogy|last=Wegner|first=Christy|date=Winter 2012-2013|website=JAEPL|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these practices aim to create more awareness of the sensation of the body in space and to think of writing as a physical act.

'''Faith literate''' describes the ability of an individual to become knowledgeable of  other [[religion]]s and [[faiths|faith]] other than the one a person believes in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Philosophy==
A faith literate individual understands the key effects of each religion/belief system by means of the values, attitudes and influence it causes in individuals, families and communities. Faith literates believe in recognizing religious and secular worldviews in practice and thoughts and take hold of what makes each religion/belief system what it is. IT involves understanding and knowing the fundamental formative attribute of all religions.

==Present scenario==
In the United Kingdom, there are [[institutes]] and [[consultancies]] being set up that offer religious understanding [[training]] for the [[public]] and [[private sector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faithliteracy.com/ |title=Religious Awareness Training |author=Faith Literacy UK |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202091924/http://faithliteracy.com/ |archivedate=2011-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elephantconsultants.com/page6.htm |title=Delivering High-quality faith-awareness Training |author=Elephant In the Room Consultancy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815142307/http://elephantconsultants.com/page6.htm |archivedate=2011-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faithencounter.org.uk/Train/train_literacy.html|title=Training - Faith Literacy Training Programmes &amp; Workshops|author=The Faith Encounter Programme}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the government is also committed to a program of faith literacy in the public sector. This is aimed to be significantly enhance organizational multiplicity among other things. Faith literacy is also intended to facilitate a move beyond the functional levels of conversation.

'''Fearghal Óg Mac an Bhaird''' (born by 1550, died after 1616) was a [[Gaels|Gaelic]]-Irish [[bardic]] poet.

==Biography==

A member of the [[Donegal]] branch of the learned [[Mac an Bhaird]] family, he was the son of [[Fearghail mheic Dhomhnaill Ruaidh Mac an Bhaird]], who died in 1550.

He visited [[Scotland]] and enjoyed the patronage of [[James VI]]. [[Red Hugh O'Donnell]] accorded him high status, and in 1602 Fearghal Óg wrote the lament ''Teasda Éire san Easbáinn'', describing Ireland as an infertile waste after her prince's death.

When [[James VI]] ascended the English throne in 1603 Fearghal Óg wrote an inaugural poem, ''Trí coróna i gcairt Shéamais'', celebrating the new king's claims to three crowns. Some time after writing an elegy on Aodh Óg Ó Domhnaill of Ramelton, Co. Donegal, in 1616, Fearghal Óg went to [[Leuven|Louvain]], where he lived in poverty.

He may have participated in An [[Iomarbhágh na bhFileadh]] ([[Contention of the Bards]]).

'''Frederik "Frits" Bolkestein''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈfreːdərɪk frɪdz ˈbɔlkəstɛi̯n|-|Nl-Frits Bolkestein.ogg}};&lt;ref&gt;''Frits'' in isolation: {{IPA-nl|frɪts|}}&lt;/ref&gt; born 4 April 1933) is a retired [[Netherlands|Dutch]] politician of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD).

Bolkestein a [[Board of directors|corporate director]] by occupation, was elected as a [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Member of the House of Representatives]] after the [[Dutch general election, 1977|Dutch general election of 1977]] taking office on 16 January 1978. He served as [[Undersecretary]] for [[Ministry of Economic Affairs (Netherlands)|Foreign Trade]] from 5 November 1982, until 14 July 1986, in the [[First Lubbers cabinet|Cabinet Lubbers I]]. And again a [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|Member of the House of Representatives]] from 3 June 1986, until 24 September 1988, when he became [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Minister of Defence]] from 24 September 1988, until 7 November 1989, in the [[Second Lubbers cabinet|Cabinet Lubbers II]]. He again returned to the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] on 14 September 1989, and nine months later on 1 May 1990, he became the [[Parliamentary group leader|Parliamentary leader]] in the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] and the [[Leader of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]]. He served in this position for eight years until 30 July 1998.

From 15 September 1999, until 22 November 2004, he was the [[European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services]]. In the [[European Commission]], Bolkestein was responsible for [[single market|internal market]] taxation and customs union issues. Some of the more politically sensitive items in his portfolio were the draft [[community patent]] regulation and the draft [[European Union directive|directives]] on [[Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions|the patentability of computer-implemented inventions]] and [[Directive on services in the internal market|services in the internal market]], the so-called "[[Bolkestein Directive]]", which has become the focus of heated debate.

==Early life and career==

Bolkestein attended the [[Barlaeus Gymnasium]] in Amsterdam from 1945 to 1951, where he majored in both arts and sciences. Upon completing his [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] education, he was an [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] in [[mathematics]] at [[Oregon State College]] from 1951 to 1953. Subsequently he went to the [[University of Amsterdam]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] degree in mathematics and physics in 1955.&lt;ref name="parlement"/&gt; In 1959 he received a [[Master of Arts|MA]] degree in philosophy and Greek from the same university.&lt;ref name="parlement"/&gt; Bolkestein subsequently received a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] degree from [[The London School of Economics]] in 1963, and an [[Master of Laws|LLM]] degree from [[Leiden University]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="parlement"/&gt;

During his studies in Amsterdam, Bolkestein was [[Editing|editor]] for the satirical student magazine ''[[Propria Cures]]''. He was also a member of the board of the [[students' union|student union]] [[Algemene Studenten Vereniging Amsterdam|ASVA]].&lt;ref name="parlement"/&gt;

Before entering Dutch politics, Bolkestein worked for the oil company [[Royal Dutch Shell]] from 1960 to 1975. During this period he was assigned to postings in East Africa, Honduras and [[El Salvador]], Indonesia, the United Kingdom, and France. In Paris, he served on the board of the Shell Chimie from 1973 to 1975. During his tenure with Shell, he completed the first part of the economics program at the [[London School of Economics]] in 1964 and he also completed a law degree at [[Leiden University]], graduating in 1965.&lt;ref name="parlement"/&gt;

In 1976, Bolkestein wrote an English language play named ''Floris, Count of Holland'', under the [[anagram]]matic pseudonym of Niels Kobet.&lt;ref name="books"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Bolkestein left Shell in 1978 and became a member of parliament for the VVD. From 1982–1986, he served as Minister of International Trade. After joining the parliament again, he was Minister of Defence from 1988–1989. In 1990 he was elected [[Leader of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] of the VVD, a position he held until 1998. Between 1978 and 1999, when he became European Commissioner, he was member of parliament for 17 years.

During the 1990s, he was very successful as the political frontman of the VVD. As an opinion leader, he was known for his daring and controversial positions on such issues as multicultural problems in Dutch society, political dualism between government and parliament, and the structure and expansion of the European Union. From 1990–1994 he was the parliamentary opposition leader and continued his outspoken and independent style when his party was part of the government from 1994. During the provincial elections of 1995, his criticism of Dutch immigration policies made his party the largest of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.verkiezingsuitslagen.nl/verkiezingen/detail/PS19950308 Provinciale Staten 8 maart 1995] at www.verkiezingsuitslagen.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, his political integrity came under heavy criticism, because it was revealed he had written a letter to the Minister of Health [[Els Borst]], in which he asked her to help a pharmaceutical company, of which Bolkestein was member of the board of commissioners. The incident was known as the "Dear Els"-incident, because the letter was addressed to Borst personally.

He was president of the [[Liberal International]], the world federation of liberal political parties. Since Autumn 2004, he has been a professor at the Dutch universities of [[Leiden University|Leiden]] and [[TU Delft|Delft]]. Former Irish [[finance minister]] [[Charlie McCreevy]] succeeded him as Commissioner for the Internal Market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2004/08/16/204496/IT-has-key-economic-role-says-new-EC-president.htm IT has key economic role, says new EC president] Computer Weekly16 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

He authored a number of books on politics and related subjects. Frits Bolkestein is married to Femke Boersma, a retired Dutch actress. In 2005, his house in northern France had its electricity cut briefly by the local energy company after he criticized French protectionist measures against incoming electricians from Eastern Europe.

Also, he is on the advisory board of OMFIF where he is regularly involved in meetings regarding the financial and monetary system.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Bolkestein Directive==
Named after Frits Bolkestein, the [[Directive on services in the internal market]] aims at enabling a company from a given member-state to recruit workers in other European Union countries using the law of its home country. It triggered huge protests in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} This directive was voted in the European Parliament in March 2006 and the MEPs proposed amendments to the provisional text. The "principle of origin", which stipulates that workers are employed under the legal arrangements of their own state of residence, was replaced by a new "freedom" principle – freedom to provide services, meaning that administrative obstacles should be removed. The compromise allowed the draft Directive to continue to exist. However, there was a great deal of concern about its effect on social standards and welfare, triggering competition between various parts of Europe. This led to significant protests across Europe against the directive including a notable protest at the European Parliament in [[Strasbourg]] by port workers which led to damage to the building. MEPs eventually reached a compromise on the text and the Parliament adopted it on 12 December 2006; 2 years after Bolkestein left office, under the [[Barroso Commission]].

==Controversies==
In 2001, Bolkestein responded to the question raised by [[Members of the European Parliament|European MPs]] (MEP) [[Harlem Désir]], [[Glyn Ford]] and [[Francis Wurtz]], who asked the Commission to investigate the accusations brought forward by ''Révélation$'', a book written by investigative journalist [[Denis Robert]] and former Clearstream member [[Ernest Backes]], and to ensure that the [[10 June 1990 directive]] (91/308 CE) on control of financial establishment be applied in all member states in an effective way. Commissioner Frits Bolkestein applied that ''"the Commission has no reason to date to believe that the Luxembourg authorities do not apply it vigorously".'' (''sic'') The three MPs henceforth published a press statement asking the opening of an investigation by the European Union about the correct application of 10 June 1990 directive.&lt;ref name="Desir"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.harlemdesir.com/article/articleview/783/1/1442/ Harlem Désir's official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303073332/http://www.harlemdesir.com/article/articleview/783/1/1442/ |date=3 March 2006 }} (European MPs [[Harlem Désir]], [[Glyn Ford]] and [[Francis Wurtz]] press statement about the $1.5&amp;nbsp;trillion math error &amp; Denis Robert and Ernest Backes' book "Revelation$" and a 9 May 2001 op-ed in ''[[Le Monde]]'' titled "''Les 'boîtes noires' de la mondialisation financière''" ("The black box of financial globalization") by [[Bernard Bertossa]], attorney general in [[Geneva]], [[Benoît Dejemeppe]], king's attorney in [[Brussels]] (''procureur du roi'', ''procureur des konings''), [[Eva Joly]], [[investigative magistrate]] in Paris, [[Jean de Maillard]], magistrate in [[Blois]] and [[Renaud van Ruymbeke]], judge in Paris)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tobin"&gt;{{en icon}} / {{fr icon}} {{cite news | title=André Lussi, CEO of Clearstream, stepping down – interview of Denis Robert | publisher=Tobin tax | date=June 2001 | url=http://tobintaxcall.free.fr/Newsletter_4_EN.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2006, French daily ''[[20 minutes (France)|20 minutes]]'' revealed that "in May 2005, MEP [[Paul van Buitenen]] was shocked by Frits Bolkestein's presence in [[Bank Menatep]]'s international consultative council (owned by [[Russians|Russian]] magnate [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]]), a sulfurous Russian banking establishment, and by his work for [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], British-Dutch petrol company. Two firms 'detaining secret accounts in [[Clearstream]]' ... Van Buitenen, also Dutch, then asked for 'clarification' to the European Commission and the opening of a parliamentary investigation. The Commission's president, [[José Manuel Durão Barroso|José Manuel Barroso]], answered that these facts "don't bring up any new question" and that it is not known "if Menatep took contact with Bolkestein while he was in his functions". No investigation thereby took place." The free daily underlines that "in 2001, it was Bolkestein himself that announced the Commission's refusal to open up a parliamentary investigation on Clearstream", following MEP [[Harlem Désir]]'s requests and accusations that Menatep had an "undeclared account" at Clearstream. Bolkestein refused to answer any questions by the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Révélation 20 Minutes: Quand la Commission européenne refusait d'enquêter sur Clearstream | date=26 April 2006 | accessdate=29 April 2006 | publisher=[[20 minutes (France)|20 minutes]] | url=http://www.20minutes.fr/article/82815/Revelation-20-Minutes-Quand-la-Commission-europeenne-refusait-d-enqueter-sur-Clearstream.php|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May 2010, Bolkestein advocated for the legalization of all drugs in an article called; "Red het land, sta drugs toe" which translates to; "save the nation, allow drugs" in the [[NRC Handelsblad]], a Dutch newspaper. The article is endorsed by many professionals ranging from [[Els Borst]], former Dutch minister of public health, to many jurists, professors and drug experts.

In ''Het Verval'' ("The Decline"), a book about Jews in the Netherlands written by [[Manfred Gerstenfeld]], a [[Holocaust]] survivor and senior researcher at the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], Bolkestein is quoted as having said that practicing Jews had no future in the Netherlands, due to anti-semitism among [[Islam in the Netherlands#Immigration|Turkish and particularly Moroccan immigrants]], and that they should emigrate to the United States or [[Israel]]. Bolkestein's remarks, after having been published in a Dutch newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author=Peter Wierenga| title=Bolkestein: ‘Joden, emigreer!’| date=5 December 2010| accessdate=9 December 2010| publisher=[[De Pers]]| url=http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/529411/Joden-emigreer.html| language=nl| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211051834/http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/529411/Joden-emigreer.html| archivedate=11 December 2010| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; raised a storm of criticism in December 2010. According to [[Ronny Naftaniel]], head of the Jewish organisation CIDI, this was not the first time Bolkestein has expressed this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author=Cnaan Liphshiz | title=Top Dutch politician: Jews should emigrate to Israel or U.S.| date=7 December 2010 | accessdate=9 December 2010 | publisher=[[Haaretz]] | url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/top-dutch-politician-jews-should-emigrate-to-israel-or-u-s-1.329313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:120519 Coulonhûs (Fryske Akademy) Leeuwarden NL.jpg|thumb|The {{Interlanguage link multi|Coulonhûs|fy}} in Leeuwarden, main building of the Fryske Akademy]]

The '''Fryske Akademy''' ([[West Frisian language|Frisian]] for ''Frisian Academy''), founded in 1938, is the [[Research institute|scientific centre]] for [[research]] and [[education]] concerning [[Friesland]] (''Fryslân'' in [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]]) and its people, language and culture, this in its broadest sense. The institution is based in the Coulonhûs and adjacent buildings in [[Leeuwarden]]. Together with several other institutes it belongs to the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (KNAW). It has about 60 employees. In addition, some 300 scientists, amateurs and professionals, are active in the scientific societies hosted by the Fryske Akademy.

== Activities ==
Although the academy's mission includes a wide scope of [[Friesland]]-related topics, a great deal of its work focuses particularly on the [[West Frisian language]]. It has also done a great deal to regulate the language. The Fryske Akademy publishes the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Wurdboek fan de Fryske Taal|fy}}'' (Dictionary of the (West) Frisian Language), which serves as the language's principal authority.

It also does a good deal of research regarding the language, history, and culture of the [[Frisians|Frisian people]]. Since its inception, it has published almost 1,000 scientific books, thousands of articles, and a large number of reports on these subjects. A few larger projects include:
* the authoritative dictionary of the West Frisian language, in 25 volumes;
* a West Frisian–English dictionary;
* the Historical Geographical Information System (HISGIS), in which historical registers of real property have been linked to other information like parish registers;
* the Mercator European Research Centre on Multilingualism and Language Learning, which has been financed in part by the Council of Europe, the province of Friesland, and the municipality of Leeuwarden.

== Function in society/social function ==
The social purpose of the Fryske Akademy is, as its statutes have it, the maintenance of societies for the study of Friesland, in which professional scientists and amateur scientists participate.  The societies are in part responsible for the large number of books which the Fryske Akademy produces. Very active societies include the Genealogical Society, the Archaeological Society, and the Biological Society. Active or passive participation in these societies is open to everyone paying his dues as a donor of the Fryske Akademy. There are about 3000 donors, each paying a minimum of 25 euro a year. 

In addition, the Fryske Akademy carries out contract research for third parties, such as the provincial authorities for whom the Fryske Akademy investigated the quality of [[language education]] at primary level. It also contributed to the development of test for speech therapy for West Frisian, which made it possible to assess children’s linguistic progress in West Frisian. Up till then, only a Dutch test had been used, which gave distorted results in the case of bilingual children.

The academy is also the home of [[Fryske Rie foar Heraldyk]], a [[Heraldry|heraldic]] advisory board for the Frisian region.

== History ==
The Fryske Akademy was founded in 1938 with the support of the provincial authorities at the behest of many pro-Frisian politicians and scientists, notably the historian [[Geart Aeilco Wumkes]] and the theologian [[Titus Brandsma]]. Before the foundation of the Fryske Akademy, two societies were concerned with Frisian science:
* The Frisian society for History, Archaeology, and Linguistics
* The society for the Frisian language and book knowledge
These 19th-century societies regarded themselves as the intellectual heirs to the [[University of Franeker]], which was abolished by Napoleon and which the government of the new Kingdom of the Netherlands failed to reopen. To some extent, the Fryske Akademy considers itself a successor to the University of Franeker.

'''Ghadah Al-Samman''' ({{lang-ar|غادة السمّان}}) is a [[Syrian]] [[writer]], [[journalist]] and [[novelist]] born in [[Damascus]] in 1942 to a prominent and conservative Damascene family, she is remotely related to [[Nizar Qabbani]] the famous [[poet]].  Her father was Ahmed Al-Samman, a president of the [[Syrian University]].  She was deeply influenced by him since her mother died at a very young age.

==Career==
Her father was fond of both Western literature and [[Arabic literature]]; this influenced her deeply and gave her a unique style that combines attributes of both.  Nevertheless, she soon was confronted with the conservative Damascene society in which she was raised and lived her early years.

She published her first book of short stories '''عيناك قدري''' ''“Your Eyes are my Destiny”'' in 1962 which was received reasonably well.  However, she was lumped at the time with other traditional feminine writers.  Her later publications took her out of the tight range of feminine and love novels to much wider social, feminist and philosophical extents.

She graduated from the Syrian University in 1963 with a BA in English Literature and left to [[Beirut]] to earn her master's degree in Theatre from [[American University of Beirut]]; since then she had not returned to Damascus.

In Beirut she worked in [[journalism]] and in 1965 she published her second collection '''لا بحر في بيروت''' ''“No Sea in Beirut”'' in which the effect of her new, now wider experiences are evident.  She then traveled around Europe working as a [[correspondent]] and in 1966 published her third collection '''ليل الغرباء''' ''“Foreigners’ Nights”'' reflecting her experiences.

The [[Six-Day War]] had a shock effect on her as it did on many of her generation, this was evident in her famous [[Article (publishing)|article]] '''احمل عاري إلى لندن''' ''“I Carry My Shame to London”'', after that she did not publish any books for six years but her journalistic articles became closer to the social reality and made her popular.  The articles she wrote during that period became the source of some of her later publications.

In 1973 she published her fourth collection, '''رحيل المرافئ القديمة''' ''“The Departure of Old Ports”'', considered by some [[Literary criticism|critiques]] one of the most important of her works.  In this collection of short stories she described in a literary fashion the dilemma of the [[Arab]] [[intellectual]] of the time and the conflict between his/her thought and actions.  She published her first novel, '''بيروت 75''' ''“Beirut 75”'' around the end of 1974.  The novel describes the complex social problems in Beirut and started with a prophecy by one of the characters of the novel, a fortune teller that says: ''“I see blood, I see a lot of blood”''.  A few months later the [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war]] broke out in Lebanon.

After the publication of two more novels, '''كوابيس بيروت''' ''“Beirut Nightmares"'' in 1977, which describes life in civil-war-torn Beirut in the mid-Seventies, and '''ليلة المليار''' ''“The Eve of Billion”'' in 1986, she was referred to as the most prominent modern Arab writer by some critics.

==Life==
In the late 1960s Ghada married Bashir Al Daouq, the owner of [[Dar Al Tali’a]] publishing house and had her only son, Hazim, which she named after one of her heroes in ''“Foreigners' Nights”''.  She later made her own publishing house and re-published most of her books, she also gathered all her articles in a series she called  '''الأعمال غير الكاملة''' ''“The Unfinished Works”'', up to date she has published fifteen books of it, nine of them are poetry collections.  She has stored her unpublished works including many letters in a [[Swiss bank]], which she promises to publish ''“when the time is right”''.

It is believed that some of her letters may reveal some information about some prominent [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] writers and poets during the 1960s, of the people her name was linked with are: Nasir eDdin Al Nashashibi, the journalist and Kamal Nasir, the late poet.

In 1993 she caused a scene in the literary and political arenas when she published a collection of love letters written to her by [[Ghassan Kanafani]] in the sixties when she had a love affair with him, which was no secret at the time.  She was condemned for publishing them by some claiming that her intention was to smear the late writer’s reputation and/or to negatively affect the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict|Palestinian Cause]].

She has also written a few criticism books and translated some of her works to several worldwide languages. Ghada has been living in [[Paris]] since the mid-1980s and regularly writes in an Arabic magazine published in [[London]]. She refuses any invitations for TV interviews since she had a bad experience when she was interviewed in [[Cairo]] and found out that the interviewer had not read any of her works.

Ghada Al-Samman’s mother died when she was young, so she was raised by her father for most of her life. When she was an adult, Samman’s father died and she lost her job in a short period of time. She was left alone in the world. People in her society had a traditional frame of mind and saw her as a “fallen woman” (Vinson 4-6). At that time, she had no father or husband to care for and no family to care for her. This is when Samman became a strong advocate for liberty and self-expression for all people, but especially women. Samman is considered a feminist writer (Wordpress.com p.&amp;nbsp;3). She does not shy away from subjects seen by the public as taboo. She questions typical thought about women’s sexuality and the freedoms enjoyed by the upper class (Vinson 9-10). Samman has as many critics as she has fans, but she takes the comments in stride and continues to write about beliefs and view points that most writers refuse to touch through her works of fiction. A large part of Ghada Al-Samman’s identity is an able, determined woman and she intends to make anyone who will listen feel the same way.

'''Gottfried Weigle''' (1816–1855) was a German missionary to [[Karnataka]] who translated the Bible into [[Kannada]].

He was based in [[Dharwad]], under the Basel Mission in [[Mangalore]]. [[Herrmann Moegling]], a fellow student from Tübingen also worked on translation projects.&lt;ref&gt;The Church Mission Society and world Christianity, 1799-1999 ed. Kevin Ward, Brian Stanley - 2000 "She was a sister of Herrmann Moegling and step-sister of Gottfried Weigle, both key figures in the establishment of Basel Mission work in the Kannada language of Karnataka, South India."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand Kittel]] worked more independently. He also undertook vaccination work.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hockings ''Sex and disease in a mountain community'' 1980 "The first missionary to concern himself with medical matters there was the German Gottfried H. Weigle (1816-1885), who vaccinated about 700 Badaga children in 1846 (Mullens 1854: 61). Weigle did not stay long, however, and the later ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

When Weigle died in 1855, his cousin Mögling (at the then late age of 45) married Weigle's wife Pauline.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5274">A '''handwriting exemplar''' is a piece of writing that can be examined forensically, as in a handwriting comparison. The use of an exemplar is especially important to [[questioned document examination]].

==History==
{{Main|Gilbert v. California}}

==Use==
Handwriting exemplars are used by a document examiner to determine the writing habits of an individual.  Ideally, the exemplars will provide an adequate picture of the writer's habits such that a meaningful comparison can be conducted with the questioned material.  

There are two types of handwriting exemplars that may be used; ''request'' writings and ''collected'' writings.  Request writings are obtained from an individual specifically for the purposes of conducting a handwriting comparison whereas collected writings are samples the individual produced for some other, unrelated reason generally in the course of their day-to-day activities.  

The two types of exemplars are complementary to one another.  Request writings can be controlled to some degree by whoever obtains them.  That is, it is possible to exercise some control over the writing to ensure that it is written in a comparable manner using a similar writing instrument, similar paper, etc.  Most important, the text to be written is dictated to the writer so that it can either match the questioned text exactly or be modified to ensure comparability without exactly matching the text if, for example, the text itself should remain unknown.  The primary concerns with request writing is that the writer might attempt to intentionally alter (disguise) their writing habits or the sample might not display the full range of the writer's natural variation.  Collected writings are less likely to be affected by intentional alteration (disguise) and, if sufficient quantities can be obtained, should cover the writer's range of natural variation.  As a result, the limitations of either type can be overcome by the other.

==Example Paragraphs==
The following are a few examples of pre-determined text passages that have been used to obtain [[Handwriting_exemplar#Use |''request'' exemplars]].  The text may be used exactly as shown here or modified to incorporate specific words or letter combinations that match the text of the questioned document.  

'''The London Letter'''&lt;br /&gt;
Our London business is good, but Vienna and Berlin are quiet. Mr. D. Lloyd has gone to Switzerland and I hope for good news. He will be there for a week at 1496 Zermott Street and then goes to Turin and Rome and will join Colonel Parry and arrive at Athens, Greece, November 27 or December 2. Letters there should be addressed King James Blvd. 3580. We expect Charles E. Fuller Tuesday. Dr. L. McQuaid and Robert Unger, Esq., left on the 'Y. X.' Express tonight.&lt;ref name="Standards"&gt;Norwitch Document Laboratory, "[http://www.questioneddocuments.com/Question%20Doc%20Overviews/Handwriting%20Standards.html Handwriting Standards]"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Egyptian Letter'''&lt;br /&gt;
Dear Sam:&lt;br /&gt;
From Egypt we went to Italy, and then took a trip to Germany, Holland and England. We enjoyed it all but Rome and London most. In Berlin we met Mr. John O. Young of Messrs. Tackico &amp; Co., on his way to Vienna. His address there is 147 upper Zeiss Street, care of Dr. Quincy W. Long. Friday the 18th, we join C. N. Dazet, Esquire and Mrs. Dazet, and leave at 6:30 A.M. for Paris on the 'Q. X.' Express and early on the morning on the 25th of June start for home on the S. S. King.&lt;br /&gt;
Very sincerely yours,&lt;ref name="Standards"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
''Signature of writer''&lt;br /&gt;

'''The Class of "16" Letter'''&lt;br /&gt;
Dear Zach,&lt;br /&gt;
Well, the old class of "16" is through at last. You ask where the boys are to be. Val Brown goes on the 24th to Harvard for law. Don't forget to address him as "Esquire." Ted Updyke takes a position with the N. Y. W. H. &amp; H. R. R., 892 Ladd Ave., Fall River, Massachusetts, and Jack McQuade with the D. L. &amp; W. at Jersey City, N. J. 400 E. 6th Street. William Fellows just left for a department position in Washington; his address is 735 South G. St. At last account, Dr. Max King was to go to John Hopkins for a Ph.D. degree. Think of that! Elliott goes to Xenia, Ohio, to be a Y. M. C. A. secretary. I stay here for the present. What do you do next? How about Idaho?&lt;br /&gt;
Yours truly, and Goodbye,&lt;ref name="Standards"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
''Signature of writer''&lt;br /&gt;

'''National Park Tour Letter'''&lt;br /&gt;
A tour through our national parks would be enjoyable to you, I 
know. We left Los Angeles at 7:45 A.M., September 20, via Valley 
Boulevard, and motored to the Grand Canyon in Arizona. From 
there we drove to Zion National Park in Utah; next a jump to 
Yellowstone. Then we drove to the coast, into California, and 
through the Redwood Forest to San Francisco, the commercial
Hub, arriving at 9:30 P.M., October 21. Here Mr. and Mrs. John X.
Dix of 685 East Queen St., Topeka, Kansas joined us. I found the 
roads good, some quite equal to the best.&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, "Guidelines for Obtaining Known handwriting Standards", p.6.  [http://www.bca.state.mn.us/Forms/Documents/lab-qd-guidelines.pdf Available online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4375">A '''hyperpower''' is a [[state (polity)|state]] that dominates all other states in every domain (i.e. military, culture, economy)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hyperpower|title=Definition of 'hyperpower'|publisher=[[HarperCollins|Collins]]|website=[[Collins English Dictionary|Collins Dictionary]]|accessdate=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered to be a step higher than a [[superpower]]. The term often refers to the [[United States|United States of America]] due to its status as the world's only current superpower; however, its possible status above that remains a topic of dispute.&lt;ref name="To Paris"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/05/news/to-paris-us-looks-like-a-hyperpower.html|title=To Paris, U.S. Looks Like a 'Hyperpower'|work=[[The New York Times International Edition|International Herald Tribune]]|date=February 5, 1999|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The British journalist [[Peregrine Worsthorne]] coined the term in a ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' article published March 3, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/hyper-power.asp|title=hyper-power|date=February 25, 2002|publisher=Logophilia Limited|last=McFedries|first=Paul|author-link=Paul McFedries|website=Word Spy|accessdate=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the [[Cold War]] with the [[Soviet Union]], some political commentators felt that a new term was needed to describe the United States' position (''[[Pax Americana]]'') as the lone superpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lonely Superpower or Unapologetic Hyperpower? |url=http://post.queensu.ca/~nossalk/papers/hyperpower.htm |first=Kim Richard|last=Nossal|author-link=Kim Richard Nossal|date=June 29, 1999|publisher=South African Political Studies Association|location=[[Saldanha, Western Cape]]|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Now though, some people, in whose opinion the term "superpower" does not denote the actual dominance of the USA incisively enough, use the term "hyperpower".|first1=Erich|last1=Reiter|first2=Peter|last2=Hazdra|title=The Impact of Asian Powers on Global Developments|page=5|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|date=March 9, 2013|isbn=9-783-6621-3172-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2004-07-01/history-and-hyperpower|title=History and the Hyperpower|last=Cohen|first=Eliot A.|author-link=Eliot A. Cohen|date=July 1, 2004|journal=[[Foreign Affairs]]|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|accessdate=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; French foreign minister [[Hubert Védrine]] popularized the term in 1998, because from France's position, the United States looked like a hyperpower, although the validity of classifying the United States in this way was disputed.&lt;ref name="To Paris"/&gt;

The term has also been applied retroactively to dominant states of the past. In her book ''[[Day of Empire|Day of Empire: How Hyperpowers Rise to Global Dominance—and Why They Fall]]'', American professor [[Amy Chua]] suggests that the [[Achaemenid Empire]], the [[Tang dynasty]], the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the [[British Empire]] were successful examples of historical [[hegemons]]; the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Monarchy]], [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]], and [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] were counters; and she reflects on assertions that the United States is a modern hyperpower. In a historical context, it is usually understood to mean a power that greatly exceeds any others in its political environment along several axes; Rome did not dominate [[Sasanian Empire|Persia]], [[Ancient India]] or [[History of China|China]], but did dominate the entire Mediterranean area militarily, culturally, and economically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Day of Empire|Day of Empire: How Hyperpowers Rise to Global Dominance—and Why They Fall]]|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group]]|date=January 6, 2009|last=Chua|first=Amy|author-link=Amy Chua|isbn=9-780-3074-7245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"I would rather cry in a BMW"''' is a quotation that became an online sensation in the [[People's Republic of China]] in 2010. The old, long-familiar phrase was made famous by Ma Nuo, a 20-year-old female contestant on the television show ''[[Fei Cheng Wu Rao]]'' (also known in English as ''If you are the One''). The line was in response to a question by an unemployed suitor who asked if Ma would "ride a bicycle with him" on a date. The series of events have been summed up in the media with the quip "I would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle."

In interviews after the show, Ma pointedly denied that she is a "[[gold digging|gold digger]]" – saying that she "just wanted to reject [her suitor] in a creative way."&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Yang|first=Xiyun|title=China’s Censors Rein in ‘Vulgar’ Reality TV Show|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/world/asia/19chinatv.html|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=18 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, the phrase has made its rounds across the Chinese blogosphere, and has become emblematic of the culture of [[Economic materialism|materialism]] and lack of authenticity that now allegedly permeates Chinese society, particularly in the process of dating and courtship.&lt;ref name=glt&gt;{{cite news|last=Wu|first=Mian|title=No BMW, no marriage for money-grubbing young Chinese|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/opinion/commentary/2010-05/528463.html|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=Global Times|date=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social commentator Chen Zhigang remarked, "Does Ma Nuo only speak for herself? No. Her opinion resonates with youth; they have grown up in a society that is quickly accumulating material wealth. They are snobbish.

==Analysis==
The blunt nature of the statement works well in the dating show's format, and is not the first controversial phrase to arise out of ''Fei Cheng Wu Rao''. It was cited by critics as a window to the "degradation of Chinese social values,"&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; and even drew the attention of government censors, who eventually forced producers to re-design the format of the show to be more professional and 'clean' of morally questionable content.&lt;ref name=ny2&gt;{{cite news|last=Wong|first=Edward|title=China TV Grows Racy, and Gets a Chaperon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/world/asia/censors-pull-reins-as-china-tv-chasing-profit-gets-racy.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Global Times]]'' commentary remarked that the obsession with BMWs is symbolic of a larger national trend that measures a person's success solely by money rather than factors such as "knowledge, taste, kindness or vision."&lt;ref name=glt/&gt;  The phrase also earned notoriety for Ma, whose purported pictures began surfacing all over the internet despite strong dislike from the public.&lt;ref name=dw&gt;{{cite web|title=Dating show contestant banned for sexy modeling?|url=http://www.danwei.org/tv/sarft_supposedly_ban_golddigge.php|publisher=Danwei.org|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Jinhua Zhao of the [[University of British Columbia]] referred to the quote to allude to trends in the last decade of Beijing residents opting to get rid of their bikes in favour of cars as a mode of transport, citing the social perception that, "bikes are now for losers."&lt;ref name=tac&gt;{{cite news|last=Bruno|first=Debra|title=The De-Bikification of Beijing|url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2012/04/de-bikification-beijing/1681/|accessdate=10 April 2012|newspaper=The Atlantic Cities|date=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indian French''' ({{lang-fr|Français Indien}}) is a [[dialect]] of [[French language|French]] spoken by [[India]]ns in the former colonies of [[Puducherry]] and [[Chandannagar]].  In this dialect, there is a considerable influence from [[Dravidian languages]] like [[Tamil language|Tamil]] (Pondicherry Tamil dialect), [[Telugu language|Telugu]] (Yanam Telugu dialect) and [[Malayalam]] (Mahe Malayalam dialect).

There are several varieties of Indian French, corresponding to the former French colonies, as follows:
*Tamil people (nearly 60,000 in France, 10,000 people in Puducherry)
*Telugu people (nearly 10,000 in France, 60 people in Yanam)
*Malayali people  (4000-5000 in France)

==Examples of Indian French==
Indian French spoken in [[Yanam]] only varies from standard French in pronunciation and accent. Some examples are,

'''Karipúna French Creole language''' is spoken by the Karipúna community, which lives in the Uaçá Indian Reservation in the state of [[Amapá]], on the Curipi and [[Oyapock]] rivers.&lt;ref name="Ladhams"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Ladhams|first=I.|date=1995|encyclopedia=From Contact to Creole and Beyond|title=Investigating the background of Karipúna Creole French|editor-last=Baker|editor-first=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mostly [[Stratum (linguistics)|French-lexified]] except for [[flora]] and [[fauna]] terms, with a complex mix of substratum languages—most notably the extinct [[Tupian languages|Tupian]] [[Palikúr language|Karipúna language]].

[[Ethnologue]] considers Karipúna French Creole to be "threatened," with a rating of 6b on the Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (GIDS).&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Nineteenth edition|last=Lewis|first=Paul|last2=Simons|first2=Gary F.|last3=Fennig|first3=Charles D.|date=2016|publisher=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt; This designation seems generally due to the waning use of KFC as a [[First language|mother tongue]], and the steadily decreasing transmission rate. Anonby notes that [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] tends to be the mother tongue for speakers under 60 in the Karipúna community, and Karipúna French Creole is the mother tongue primarily only for speakers over 60.&lt;ref name="Anonby"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anonby|first=Stan|date=2007|title=A Report on the Creoles of Amapá}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Karipúna community includes a mix of [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]] to such a degree that at times (such as in the early 1930s) doubt arose as to whether or not the Karipúna should be referred to as [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Indians]].&lt;ref name="Anonby"/&gt; Alleyne and Ferreira explain that "today, the Karipúna people are a highly mixed group, comprising not only descendants of Amerindians, but also of Africans, Asians and Europeans, and mixtures thereof."&lt;ref name="AF"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alleyne|first=Mervyn C.|last2=Ferreira|first2=Jo-Anne S.|date=2007|title=Comparative perspectives on the origins, development and structure of Amazonian (Karipúna) French Creole|journal=Synchronic and diachronic perspectives on contact languages|volume=32|pages=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Ladhams offers what is probably the best description of the migration and formation of the current-day Karipúna population. Members of the [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]], Tupí, and [[Cariban languages|Carib]] linguistic trunks were in contact with European [[Exploration|explorers]] since the 16th century, and around 1830 to the 1840s, due to the [[Cabanagem|Cabanagem Revolt]], a group of Amerindians from the [[Pará]] region moved to modern-day Amapá (which was, at the time, claimed by [[French Guinea]]) and joined with the present ethnic groups, thus coming into contact with French or [[Guianese Creole|Guyanais]] speakers.&lt;ref name="Ladhams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Povos"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/karipuna-do-amapa/379|title=History|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=February 2016|website=Povos Indígenas No Brasil|publisher=Instituto Socioambiental}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving between French Guiana and Brazil in hotly contested territory from the Ounary river, to the Oyapock river, and finally towards the Curipi river where the Karipúna now live, these groups were joined by "members of the Palikúr and Galibí tribes, as well as Guianan Creoles, Arabs, Chinese, Europeans, and Brazilians" and eventually settled in the Uaçá area.&lt;ref name="Ladhams"/&gt; "These were ‘displaced Brazilians …  called Karipúnas’."&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt; Furthermore in 1854, due to a gold rush in [[Approuague]], many "coolies, Blacks, Chinese, Martinicans and French adventurers" moved to the Oyapock and [[Uaçá River|Uaçá]] rivers, where the Karipúna inhabited, further contributing to the broad ethnic mix.&lt;ref name="Ladhams"/&gt;

Ladhams explains the adoption of a French creole by the group as a result of the broad ethnic backgrounds of the Karipúna. "Since at least the 1840s," the Karipúna community was "a highly disparate group ... and that there would have been an immediate need for a medium for inter-ethnic communication. A prime candidate for this would have been Guyanais," as it was already used by parts of the Amerindian members and most of the non-Amerindian members of the Karipúna community.&lt;ref name="Ladhams"/&gt;

In December 1900, the Amapá region was ceded to Brazil from France,&lt;ref name="Ladhams"/&gt; putting the Karipúna community in Brazilian territory, and in the 1920s, "Brazilian authorities deemed it necessary to implement projects for occupying the formerly contested territory whose ‘frenchified’ populations were seen as a threat to the country's territorial integrity." As a result the Oiapoque Colonization Commission was created in 1920. Later in 1927, an inspection commission commanded by the Ministry of War began to patrol the Oiapoque and report on the groups living there.&lt;ref name="Povos"/&gt; The reports were the first to use the term of "Karipúna" for the inhabitants of the Cupiri River, and has been the label employed since.&lt;ref name="Anonby"/&gt; The intent of the Ministry of War was to "incorporate the Indians into society," and from 1934–37, and then from 1945 onwards, non-indigenous teachers were recruited by the government to teach in Karipúna villages. This education "played a fundamental role in formulating the contemporary identity of these groups, in the propagation of the use of Portuguese and in the configuration of the villages."&lt;ref name="Povos"/&gt;

The 1970s "were marked by greater political participation of the Uaçá leaders," including the Karipúna amongst the other three groups in the Uaçá reserve, "who began to act in more organized fashion." Particularly, they opposed the installation of the proposed route for the [[BR-156]] highway, and this struggle resulted in further pressure to fight for the demarcation of their land. A new route of the highway was eventually accepted with "the hiring of indigenous heads to assist in the inspection of the borders of the indigenous territory."&lt;ref name="Povos"/&gt;

It was also during this period that the "Kheuól-to-Portuguese [[bilingual education]] programme was instituted, largely through the efforts of CIMI (the [[Catholic missions|Catholic mission]]) and with the approval of [[Fundação Nacional do Índio|FUNAI]], and later MEC." Since this period, there has been a stated focus on promoting the maintenance of KFC as a second language and defending Amerindian rights while also providing a "bridge to the outside world," to a varying degree of success, often criticized, both by members of the community and linguistic anthropologists such as Jo-Anne Ferreira.&lt;ref name="ferr"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferreira|first=Jo-Anne S.|date=2010|title="Bilingual education among the Karipúna and Galibi-Marwono: Prospects and possibilities for language preservation."|journal=Creoles in Education: An appraisal of current programs and projects}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the 1990s did indigenous teachers, however, begin to receive training first by CIMI, then by the Organization of Indigenous Teachers of Oiapoque established in 2005, and now "many of the teachers are Karipúna or Galibi-Marwono."&lt;ref name="ferr"/&gt;

Overall, Karipúna populations are healthily growing after the original migration from Pará that lessened populations drastically. Alleyne and Ferreira note that "the Karipúna population in 2001 is six times larger than it was in 1943."&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt; However, despite the optimistic growth in population, the linguistic vitality of Karipúna French Creole is [[Language death|threatened]].

== Current Status ==
Today in the Uaçá Reservation there are three other Amerindian groups: the Galibi-Marwono, who also speak a French Creole language incredibly similar to Karipúna, and the Palikúr and Galibi do Oiapoque indigenous groups who speak their own non-creole languages. Members of the latter groups are often bilingual in Amapá French Creole, though only the Karipúna and Galibi-Marwono speak AFC natively. Anonby finds that "the differences between all the French Creoles do not pose a serious problem to intelligibility."&lt;ref name="Anonby"/&gt;

The Karipúna people numbered 1,726 between 16 different villages in 2001. The largest, ''Manga'', contained 465 people.&lt;ref name="Anonby"/&gt; They are far more dispersed as compared to the Galibi-Marwono community in the same reservation, wherein 1,578 out of a total population of 1,787 Galibi-Marwono are concentrated in the ''Kumaruma'' village.

=== Linguistic Vitality ===
Ethnologue considers Karipúna French Creole to be "threatened," with a rating of 6b on the Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (GIDS).&lt;ref name="ethnologue"/&gt; This designation seems generally due to the waning use of KFC as a mother tongue, and the steadily decreasing transmission rate. Anonby notes that Portuguese tends to be the mother tongue for speakers under 60 in the Karipúna community, and Karipúna French Creole is the mother tongue primarily only for speakers over 60. Anonby paraphrases from interviews with speakers, that "although most people understand KFC," a Karipúna speaker "admitted about half of the people in the village of Manga cannot speak it. He said there were no monolingual Karipúna speakers."&lt;ref name="Anonby"/&gt; Speakers of KFC tend to speak it as a second language, first learning Portuguese, and only learning KFC via a three-year Kheuól education primary school programme implemented by CIMI.&lt;ref name="ferr"/&gt;

Anonby notes that "generally, [Karipúna] people feel that the loss of KFC is not a good thing. They feel nostalgia for the time when they all spoke it. At the same time, people feel very positive about speaking Portuguese." Ferreira likewise confirms this, referencing the "discontent felt by many indigenous leaders" who feel as though the state of education in KFC is not of a sufficient standard to be beneficial for the maintenance of KFC.&lt;ref name="ferr"/&gt; This program was implemented in the 1980s by CIMI, the Catholic mission, but recently a new modified version of this program, the ''Projeto Político Pedagógico das Escolas Indígenas Karipúna e Galibi-Marworno'', is in the process of being implemented, although the value of the new program in maintaining KFC is unclear.&lt;ref name="ferr"/&gt; Overall, due to the difficulty in transmitting the language to younger speakers as either a mother tongue or [[second language]], KFC is justifiably in a threatened state.

== Linguistic Origins ==
French creoles in Brazil form two sub-groups, both in the Amapá regions.&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt; Southern Amapá consists only of "Amapá French Creole" (or "Lanc-Patúa") and is spoken mainly around Macapá, the capital of Amapá state. Northern Amapá consists of two (relatively mutually intelligible&lt;ref name="Anonby"/&gt;) French-lexified creoles, both of which are considered "Amazonian French Creole," also often referred to as "Kheuól," "Crioulo," and "Patuá." The two languages are "Karipúna French Creole" (KFC) as well as "Galibi-Marwono French Creole" (GMFC)

Alleyne and Ferreira, inspired by Ladham's social history generally agree that KFC is a direct descendent of Guyanais, or Guianan French Creole. As noted above, Ladham interprets the language as a tool which the ethnically fragmented early Karipúna communities employed to meet an "immediate need for a medium for inter-ethnic communication."&lt;ref name="Ladhams"/&gt; This confirms that KFC's superstratum language is primarily French, but the other influences on the language are diverse and numerous. Alleyne and Ferreira suggest that the original "Karipúna" language — that is, that spoken by the original emigrants from Pará — "may or may not" have been a Tupi-Guarani language, and contributed to parts of the lexicon.&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt; Chris Corne notes that the indigenous influence is "substantial, particularly in the vocabulary of flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="Corne"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corne|first=Chris|date=1999|title=From French to Creole: The development of new vernaculars in the French colonial world|location=Westminster|publisher=University of Westminster Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the contact with African speakers&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt; that GFC no doubt had in its creolization process, Corne explains that "the African contribution, on present information, is surprisingly small, including only a handful of words from [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], [[Kwa languages|Kwa]], and [[Senegambian languages|Senegambian]] languages," although the African influences in grammar are more obvious.&lt;ref name="Corne"/&gt; Lastly and unsurprisingly Corne mentions that "Portuguese has contributed basic vocabulary" of KFC for both [[Part of speech|lexical and functional]] categories of words. Some Kheuól words are even used in variation with Portuguese contributions to the lexicon, "for example, stilo and kanét (‘pen’), la nét and janél (‘window’)",&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt; generally as a result of increasing sociohistorical pressures from the mid-1900s as the Portuguese education system began to erode the transmission of KFC.

== Literature ==
Karipúna do Amapá is referred to by a wide variety of names colloquially and in linguistic literature, including "Karipúna do Norte (Karipúna French Creole),"&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Moore|first=Denny|title=Brazil: language situation|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of languages and linguistics 2|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kheuól, Crioulo, Patoá, Patuá, Patúa, and Amazonian/Amapá/Amerindian French Creole (which all also include the closely related Galibi-Marwono French Creole language).&lt;ref name="ferr"/&gt; Ethnologue refers to the language as "Karipúna Creole French."&lt;ref name="ethnologue"/&gt;

Tolber provided what is apparently the first rigorous descriptive grammar of KFC.&lt;ref name="Tobler1983"/&gt; His account includes a [[lexicon]] with around 300 words, phonetic description of KFC, and analysis of the grammar at [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], [[clause]], [[word]], and [[morpheme]]-level. The description is in-depth, categorical, and provides examples for various basic and complex sentence structures and clause types, along with justification of the classifications made. Based on Tobler's description and elicitation test, a phonetic inventory was made available for KFC online.&lt;ref name="Ladhams"/&gt; Ladhams also notes that Monserrat &amp; Silva published a [[grammar]] of Karipúna in Portuguese in 1984.&lt;ref name="Ladhams"/&gt;

Also, in the same decade, two Karipúna-Portuguese dictionaries were published by A.W. Tobler (1987)&lt;ref name="Tobler1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tobler|first=A.W.|date=1987|title=Dicionário Crioulo Karipúna/Português Português/Crioulo Karipúna.|location= Brasília |publisher=SIL}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Montejo (1988).&lt;ref name="Picanco1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Montejo|first=Francisca Picanço|date=1988|title=No Djisone Kheuol-Portxige: O Nosso Dicionário Português-Khueol (Povos Karipúna e Galibi Marworno)|location=Belem|publisher=Edicoes Mensageiro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobler's ''Dicionário Crioulo Karipúna'' is published in Portuguese and contains an (approximately) 2100 Karipúna words with their Portuguese translation, and vice versa, and also provides an [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] pronunciation guide for Kheuól orthography. Picanço's ''O nosso dicionário Português-Kheuol'' is apparently unavailable online.

Corne criticizes the "lack of serious lexicological research" for Karipúna French Creole and Guyanais in general.&lt;ref name="Corne"/&gt; Despite the relatively large focus on [[Language documentation|documentation]] in the 1980s, little other linguistic documentation appears to be available. Ferreira states that "the Catholic mission, CIMI, has been largely responsible for promoting a three year Kheuól education primary school programme." According to CIMI statements, the Karipúna and Galibi-Marwono have been working since 1978 to develop this educational process,&lt;ref name="ferr"/&gt; but the "materials [for language education]" are not readily available and are most likely used in the community for the three-year language education program. According to Anonby some of the Karipúna French Creole texts have been published and they are "mainly Biblical stories and folk tales," along with language "primers, such as those edited and organized by Fransisca Picanco Montejo (1985)."&lt;ref name="Anonby"/&gt;

=== Documentation Projects ===
The majority of rigorous Karipúna linguistic documentation was done in the 1980s, with Tobler (1983), Tobler (1987), Monserrat &amp; Silva (1984) and Picanço (1988). Present-day language documentation agencies (such as Soas, Museu do Índio, Museu Goeldi, and Dobes, amongst others) do not seem to have assisted in the documentation of KFC.

Anonby's A Report on the Creoles of Amapá&lt;ref name="Anonby"/&gt; is the result of a joint study between SIL and the University of the West Indies to "investigate sociolinguistic aspects of the French-lexifier Creole languages spoken in the state of Amapá," albeit not funded by a particular major documentation project.

=== Ethnography === 
A series of anthropological analyses of the Karipúna community have been undertaken, especially in light of the Karipúna identity and schooling system. Tassinari and Cohn in 2009 critically evaluated, just like Ferreira,&lt;ref name="ferr"/&gt; the bilingual education program and demonstrated the caveats in the CIMI-organized three-year educational programme.&lt;ref name="TassCohn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tassinari|first=Antonella Imperatriz|last2=Cohn|first2=Clarice|date=2009|title="Opening to the Other": Schooling among the Karipúna and Mebengokré‐Xikrin of Brazil|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|series=40|volume=2|pages=150–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ladhams is a well-cited and succinct socio-historical investigation of the Karipúna community's origins, which is generally accepted by anyone writing about KFC ethnography afterwards.&lt;ref name="Ladhams"/&gt;

==Phonology==
Karipúna French Creole has 32 phonemes — 22 consonants and 10 vowels. Its phoneme inventory is notably smaller than its lexifier language, French.

===Consonants===
Karipúna French Creole's 22 phonemic consonants are shown in the table below.

Karipúna French Creole's consonants are relatively similar to French, with some exceptions. The palatal nasal stop, /ɲ/, voiced uvular fricative, /ʁ/, and labialized palatal approximant, /ɥ/, or /jʷ/, all of which are present in French, are not in KFC. Furthermore, /t/ and /d/ from French are dentalized in KFC.&lt;ref name="Tobler1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tobler|first=S. Joy|date=1983|title=The Grammar of Karipúna Creole|publisher=Summer Institute of Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PHOIBLE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phoible.org/inventories/view/907|title=Inventory Karipuna Creole French (PH)|date=2014|website=PHOIBLE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly /h/ is present phonemically in KFC, despite having been lost in French due to historical sound changes.

=== Vowels ===
Karipúna French Creole has 10 phonemic vowels.&lt;ref name="PHOIBLE"/&gt;

Again, compared to French's 17 vowels, KFC is significantly less complicated, losing /{{IPA link|ɑ}}/, /{{IPA link|ɑ̃}}/, /{{IPA link|ɛː}}/, /{{IPA link|ə}}/, /{{IPA link|œ}}/, /{{IPA link|ø}}/, and /{{IPA link|y}}/.

Nonetheless, the French influence is obvious. Like in French, only the open-mid and open vowels have phonemic nasalized variants. Alleyne and Ferreira note that this is consistent with other French creoles, and evidence for the hypothesis that all (or many) Atlantic French Creole languages descended from a common creole ancestor.

== Morphology ==

Relative to French and its substratum languages, Karipúna French Creole is more morphologically isolating, as tends to be the case with Caribbean Creole Languages.  Morphemes in Karipúna French Creole are either root forms or derivational affixes, and inflectional affixes are apparently not present. Tobler notes that most words are monomorphemic.&lt;ref name="Tobler1983"/&gt;

=== Verb Coersion ===

The "verbalizing" suffix /-e/ however can coerce some nouns into a verb class.

|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''flɛʃ''

Pronouns in KFC form a two-number and three-case system, which is undergoing a regularizing change by analogy.&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt; The /li/ pronoun, and /ka/ tense marker (see below), will elide with an adjacent verb.&lt;ref name="Tobler1983"/&gt; The KFC lexicon on the whole is greatly derived from French&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt; and has undergone a process more morphological agglutination and "article reduction." Ladhams suggests that the Karipúna community is historically composed of "French Guinean Blacks, Chinese, Arabs, and Europeans," although the extent of non-European influence, outside of flora and fauna words, appears to be minimal.&lt;ref name="Ladhams"/&gt; Arab and Chinese lexical influence is virtually nonexistent. Thus the generic open class of nouns involves morphologically reducing "la + noun" or "l’ + noun" to a monomorphemic word.&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt;

=== Pronouns ===

Karipúna French Creole's personal pronouns form a two-number, three-person system as in French, and are shown in the table below.&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tobler1983"/&gt;

The distinction between subject, direct object, and indirect object pronouns from French is simplified to a set of personal pronouns in KFC, which may occupy both subject and object position.&lt;ref name="Tobler1983"/&gt;

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''li''||''kupe''||''li''
|-
| ||3SG.SUBJ||cut||3SG.OBJ
|}
:"He/she cut it."

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''li''||''pote''||''sa''||''bay''||''mo''
|-
| ||3SG.SUBJ||take||this/that||give||1SG.OBJ
|}
:"He/she took this/that for me."

KFC has a no-case system and retained the nominative form, whereas other French creoles retained the oblique form.&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt;

Tobler, and Alleyne and Ferreira, give slightly different accounts of the pronouns, and the table above generally reflects the more recent account. Tobler does not make note of the /to/ and /so/ variants of the 2nd and 3rd person singular pronouns, which Alleyne and Ferreira explain is not present in other French creoles, (346) and is thus presumably an innovative change, by analogy with the 1st person singular /mo/. Similarly, Tobler cites /nu/ as the 1st person plural pronoun, but Alleyne and Ferreira explain that KFC has "regularized" this to /no/. The 2nd and 3rd person plural pronouns are consistent between accounts.

==== Possessive Pronouns ====

In Alleyne and Ferreira, the bare possessive pronouns and the forms with the /-pa/ suffix are taken as equals. However, Tobler refers to the /-pa/ form as "possessive pronouns," and the bare form as "possessive adjectives." The difference appears to be that the pronominal form can occasionally fill a DP (as English "mine") as well as act as a genitive adjunct to a noun phrase (/u-pa liv/, "your book"&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt;), whereas the bare possessive form must be adjunct to the possessed NP.

==== Reflexive Pronouns ====

Alleyne and Ferreira give a simple account of reflexive pronouns by appending the /-kɔ/ suffix,&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt; but Tobler's grammar explains the nuance of KFC reflexives. To indicate a reflexive pronoun, KFC uses the bare possessive form in the object position and appends the word "body" (/kɔ/), or the body part affected, as the possessed NP of the pronoun.

In the case that no body part is affected, KFC can also use /mɛm/ for the [[French personal pronouns|emphatic self]].&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt;

=== Agglutination ===

Karipúna French Creole both in historical sound shifts and in present variation has agglutinative morphophonemic changes. As in many French Creole languages, many French calques were glossed into KFC and subsequently [[Rebracketing|agglutinated with a French definite article]]. Alleyne and Ferreira list four classes, based on the original French [[determiner]].&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt;

|-
|}

Some of these classes are open, such as class I, which takes new words loaned from French, while the others are not.&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt; The morphological reduction of the French article from these words does not have a consistent result on the syntactic category, despite all being non-proper nouns. Tobler claims that "almost all words are monomorphemic roots" in KFC, and the morphological reanalysis from French loanwords appears to move towards this conformity, as the French article, nor the noun stem, are "never found in isolation."&lt;ref name="Tobler1983"/&gt;

Morphophonemic shifts also occur in the 3rd-person singular pronoun and the present progressive marker in KFC. In the pre-verbal subject position, /li/ is often reduced to /i-/, and reduced to a verb suffix /-l/ in the post-verbal object position.

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''i''||''kupe-l''
|-
| ||3SG.SUBJ||cut-3SG.OBJ
|}
:"He/she/it cut it."

The present tense marker /ka/, like /li/, also elides with non-back vowels at the beginning of a preceding verb.

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''mo''||''k-ale''
|-
| ||1SG.SUBJ||PRES-go
|}
:"I'm going."

Morphophonemic [[Folk etymology|reanalysis]] produces agglutination in KFC. Morpheme reanalysis and agglutination of this variety is common in creole languages, especially French-lexified creoles.&lt;ref name="Hage"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hagemeijer|first=Tjerk|title=Initial vowel agglutination in the Gulf of Guinea creoles|date=2009|pages=29–50|publisher=Aboh &amp; Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst French creole languages some of these categories are shared, but others are not, and Alleyne and Ferreira (amongst others) suggest that this may be an effective area of research for understanding the origins and development of French creole languages.&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt;

=== Reduplication ===

Reduplication is often considered a hallmark of creole language morphology, along with morphological conversion and compounding.&lt;ref name="KouLaC"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kouwenberg|first=Silvia|last2=LaCharité|first2=Darlene|title=The iconic interpretations of reduplication: Issues in the study of reduplication in Caribbean Creole languages|date=2001|journal=European Journal of English Studies|series=5|volume=1|pages=59–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding, as above, is present in KFC, and as expected so too is reduplication. Tobler (1983) notes the highly productive reduplication possible in KFC. 	

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''li''||''maʃe''||''li''||''maʃe''||''li''||''maʃe''

| ||3SG.SUBJ||walk||3SG.SUBJ||walk||3SG.SUBJ||walk
|}
:"He/she walked for a long time/long way." (CP reduplication)

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''li''||''ka''||''kɔlɛ''||''ke''||''kɔlɛ''
|-
| ||3SG.SUBJ||PRES||be.angry||FUT||be.angry

|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''li''||''te''||''blã''||''blã''
|-
| ||3SG.SUBJ||PAST||white||white 
|}
:"It was very white/white as snow." (AP reduplication)

Tobler shows that reduplication in possible in a large variety of syntactic and morphological contexts. In all cases it tends to "emphasize the degree or quantity of that which is reduplicated,"&lt;ref name="Tobler1983"/&gt; which corresponds to the generalized "more of the same meaning."&lt;ref name="Hage"/&gt;

== Syntax ==

Creole languages tend to be characterized by a lack of "complex inflectional morphology in general," and appropriately syntactically- or morphologically-induced changes in verb valency are generally rare.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=Bart|title=The origin and originality of passivization in Papiamentu|date=2011|pages=31–56|journal=Journal of Portuguese Linguistics|series=10|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobler's grammar does however mention a limited passive syntactic construction, as well as a causative transitive construction. No mention of other valency-changing constructions, such as antipassives or comitative case, seem to be present in any investigation of the language.

=== Valency Change ===

==== Passives ====

As seems to be the case with the majority of Creole languages, Karipúna French Creole lacks a true [[passive voice]]. [[Papiamento]] may be the only Atlantic Creole to possess a full passive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= Eckkrammer|first=Eva Martha|date=2004|encyclopedia=Creoles, Contact, and Language Change: Linguistic and Social Implications|title=Passive voice in Papiamento: A corpus-based study on dialectal variability|pages=209–219|location=Amsterdam|publisher=Benjamis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobler notes that outside of certain stative clauses, the passive form can’t be used. Utterances are expressed solely in the active form. For example, the phrase "I was bitten by a wasp" must be expressed as "the wasp bit me," as below:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''muʃ''||''mɔde''||''mo''
|-
| ||wasp||bite||1SG.OBJ
|}
:"The wasp bit me."

And the expression "all the bananas were eaten" might be expressed in either of the following ways:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''nu''||''mãdʒe''||''tut''||''bakɔv''
|-
| ||1PL.SUBJ||eat||all||banana
|}
:"We ate all the bananas."

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''pa''||''hete''||''bakɔv''
|-
| ||NEG||stay||banana
|}
:"There were no bananas left."

With active (''c.f.'' stative) verbs in Karipúna French Creole, the passive form cannot be used. While in (3) the number of arguments has been reduced to only a subject (‘banana’), /hete/ is an intransitive verb typically. In other words, Karipúna French Creole non-stative verbs do not have a valency-reducing form.

As stated before, the vast majority of French creoles lack a passive form. While in some French creole communities a passive form can be used, such as in Haitian French Creole, it doesn’t seem to be considered a part of a creole itself, but rather a French borrowing (Mandaly 2011). Jacobs analyzes another potential source for creole passives, however, suggesting that substratum origins and contact with earlier creole languages likely was the result of the oddly-distributed use of the passive in Papiamento,&lt;ref name="Jacobs"/&gt; rather than top-down European-language influence.

Tobler demonstrates how a pseudo-passive can be formed by coercing the verb into a verbal adjective, turning a monotransitive sentence into an intransitive one.

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''kaz''||''la''||''pẽtʃihe''
|-
| ||house||DEM||paint
|}
:"The house is painted."

Compared with the active construction:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''i''||''pẽtʃihe''||''kaz''
|-
| ||3SG.SUBJ||paint||house
|}
:"He/she painted the house."

This kind of construction for the verb is not necessarily a full passive, and can only form strictly stative constructions, using only auxiliary or verb-null copula phrases. Tobler notes "one cannot say, ‘The house was painted by John’; this must be expressed actively as ‘John painted the house’" (Tobler 1983, 54). Clearly in this phrase /pẽtʃihe/ is no longer functioning as a VP in the passive construction, as it cannot take an agentive adjunct (‘by John’).

Interaction with verb stativity appears to be a common feature of Atlantic creole languages, and Winford (1988) looks to creole passivity to discuss the possible West African origins of the passive form.&lt;ref name="Winford"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winford|first=Donald|title=Stativity and other aspects of the creole passive|journal=Lingua|series=76|volume=4|date=1988|pages=271–297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karipúna French Creole's semi-passive verbal adjective form may, rather than the result of a superstratum French influence, be a construction derived from one of Karipúna's many substratum languages.

==== Causatives ====

Karipúna French Creole does have a causative construction, using the auxiliary verb "make" (/fɛ/), which appears to be a widely productive, valency-increasing form. The "make" auxiliary changes either an intransitive construction into a transitive one, or a transitive to a ditransitive.

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''mo''||''lẽj''||''te''||''sɛk''
|-
| ||1SG.POSS||clothes||PAST.COMP||dry
|}
:"My clothes (were) dry."

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''solej''||''ka''||''fɛ''||''mo''||''lẽj''||''sɛk''
|-
| ||sun||PRES.PROG||make||1SG.POSS||clothes||dry
|}
:"The sun is making my clothes dry."

It is apparent that there is a valency increase with the introduction of the "make" auxiliary, given that the tense marker "te" is no longer present in the /mo lẽj sɛk/ verbal compliment(s). While KFC can, and often does, use a null tense marker to indicate present completeness for "experience and state" verbs, like /sɛk/, the gloss Tobler provides gives no evidence of a present-complete meaning.&lt;ref name="Tobler1983"/&gt; Therefore, we analyze this not as an embedded CP complement to /fɛ/, but rather as a valency-increase of the VP /sɛk/ from intransitive to monotransitive.

:"He/she made them chop a lot of wood."

A similar analysis can be taken to the monotransitive-to-ditransitive use of /fɛ/. Tobler's gloss suggests that the null past complete tense marker that "event and process" verbs take applies to "make," rather than "chop" in the causative construction, and therefore does not represent mere CP-embedding.&lt;ref name="Tobler1983"/&gt;

=== Tense ===

Karipúna French Creole's system of tense marking is complex, with "five overt tense markers and another [null] marker."&lt;ref name="Tobler1983"/&gt; However the meaning of the null tense marker is dependent on the class of verb phrase.

Tobler (1983) distinguishes five classes of verb phrase: Event, Experience, Process, State A, and State B. State A and B are typically copular, comparative, possessive or similar phrases that lack a main verb statement. KFC non-auxiliary verbs fall into the categories of Event, Experience, and Process verbs. Event verbs typically include transitives such as /ale/, "go," and /aʃte/, "buy." Experience and Process verbs, vaguely, characterize intransitive experiences and processes, although Tobler fails to provide specific examples of the distinctions. Tobler does note that Event and Experience verbs take a semantic agent, while Process and State phrases lack one, such that Experience verbs (like /sɔtʃi/, "leave/get out," and /asi/, "sit") could be analyzed as unergatives, and Process verbs (like /bule/, "be burned," and /tõbe/, "fall") as unaccusatives.

Tense marking for sentences in KFC interacts with the class of verb phrase in the sentence. All classes of VP use the /ke/ future tense marker, and /teke/ conditional tense marker.

:"If I had had the money, I would have bought a radio."

Exclusive to Event and Process class VPs is the present progressive /ka/ marker, and the past incomplete tense marker /teka/. For event and process verbs, a null tense marker is analyzed as the past complete tense.

| ||rain||PAST.COMP||fall||all||in.night
|}
:"The rain fell all night."

For Experience and State class VPs, the past complete tense is marked by the tense marker /te/, whereas the null tense marker is understood as the present progressive tense.

:"I am hot."

=== Conditionals ===

The "conditional tense marker" /teke/ indicates a strictly hypothetical conditional relation ("if S had been, H would have"). The conditional marker /si/ can also be used with other tense markers than /teke/ however, but requires strict correspondence between the markers used. Tobler distinguishes three kinds of conditional constructions, employing distinct uses of the tense markers.&lt;ref name="Tobler1983"/&gt;

The first conditional, "authentic" construction is used for genuine, specific, events, that haven’t occurred yet. This construction uses the present progressive tense marker /ka/ in the conditional phrase and the future tense marker /ke/ in the result phrase. For example:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''si''||''li''||''ka''||''hive''||''li''||''ke''||''bõ''
|-
| ||if||3SG||PRES.PROG||arrive||3SG||FUT||good
|}
:"If he arrives it will be good."

The (former) conditional clause in this construction can also drop /ka/, with no apparent semantic change.

The "generalization" conditional construction applies to general rules and principles about the world, using the null tense marker in the conditional phrase and the present progressive /ka/ in the result phrase, as such:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''si''||''u''||''ø''||''kupe''||''vitmã''||''ka''||''fãde''
|-
| ||if||2SG||PAST.INCOM||cut||quickly||PRES.PROG||break
|}
:"If you cut it quickly it will break."

The hypothetical conditional construction translates roughly to "if S had been, H would have," and uses the past complete /te/ marker for the conditional clause, and the conditional /teke/ marker for the main clause. This construction applies strictly to hypothetical situations that might have happened, rather than ones that have habitually (the generalization construction) or may in the future (the "authentic" construction).

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''si-l''||''te''||''hive''||''mo''||''teke''||''pale''||''ke-l''
|-
| ||if-3SG||PAST.COMP||arrive||1SG||COND||talk||with-3SG
|}
:"If he had arrive, I would have talked with him."

'''Latent semantic analysis''' ('''LSA''') is a technique in [[natural language processing]], in particular [[distributional semantics]], of analyzing relationships between a set of documents and the terms they contain by producing a set of concepts related to the documents and terms.  LSA assumes that words that are close in meaning will occur in similar pieces of text (the [[Distributional semantics|distributional hypothesis]]).  A matrix containing word counts per paragraph (rows represent unique words and columns represent each paragraph) is constructed from a large piece of text and a mathematical technique called [[singular value decomposition]] (SVD) is used to reduce the number of rows while preserving the similarity structure among columns.  Words are then compared by taking the cosine of the angle between the two vectors (or the [[dot product]] between the [[Unit vector|normalizations]] of the two vectors) formed by any two rows.  Values close to 1 represent very similar words while values close to 0 represent very dissimilar words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Latent Semantic Analysis | author=Susan T. Dumais |year=2005 | doi=10.1002/aris.1440380105 | journal=Annual Review of Information Science and Technology | volume=38 | pages=188–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An information retrieval technique using latent semantic structure was patented in 1988 ([http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=4839853 US Patent 4,839,853], now expired) by [[Scott Deerwester]], [[Susan Dumais]], [[George Furnas]], [[Richard Harshman]], [[Thomas Landauer]], [[Karen Lochbaum]] and [[Lynn Streeter]]. In the context of its application to [[information retrieval]], it is sometimes called '''latent semantic indexing''' ('''LSI''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lsa.colorado.edu/ | title=The Latent Semantic Indexing home page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

[[File:Topic model scheme.webm|thumb|600px|thumbtime=24|start=1|end=24|Animation of the topic detection process in a document-word matrix. Every column corresponds to a document, every row to a word. A cell stores the weighting of a word in a document (e.g. by [[tf-idf]]), dark cells indicate high weights. LSA groups both documents that contain similar words, as well as words that occur in a similar set of documents. The resulting patterns are used to detect latent components.&lt;ref&gt;http://topicmodels.west.uni-koblenz.de/ckling/tmt/svd_ap.html&lt;/ref&gt;]]
=== Occurrence matrix ===
LSA can use a [[term-document matrix]] which describes the occurrences of terms in documents; it is a [[sparse matrix]] whose rows correspond to [[terminology|terms]] and whose columns correspond to documents. A typical example of the weighting of the elements of the matrix is [[tf-idf]] (term frequency–inverse document frequency): the weight of an element of the matrix is proportional to the number of times the terms appear in each document, where rare terms are upweighted to reflect their relative importance.

This matrix is also common to standard semantic models, though it is not necessarily explicitly expressed as a matrix, since the mathematical properties of matrices are not always used.

=== Rank lowering ===
After the construction of the occurrence matrix, LSA finds a [[low-rank approximation]]&lt;ref&gt;Markovsky I. (2012) Low-Rank Approximation: Algorithms, Implementation, Applications, Springer, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4471-2226-5}} {{page needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[term-document matrix]]. There could be various reasons for these approximations:

* The original term-document matrix is presumed too large for the computing resources; in this case, the approximated low rank  matrix is interpreted as an ''approximation'' (a "least and necessary evil").
* The original term-document matrix is presumed ''noisy'': for example, anecdotal instances of terms are to be eliminated. From this point of view, the approximated matrix is interpreted as a ''de-noisified matrix'' (a better matrix than the original).
* The original term-document matrix is presumed overly [[Sparse matrix|sparse]] relative to the "true" term-document matrix.  That is, the original matrix lists only the words actually ''in'' each document, whereas we might be interested in all words ''related to'' each document—generally a much larger set due to [[synonymy]].

The consequence of the rank lowering is that some dimensions are combined and depend on more than one term:

:: {(car), (truck), (flower)} --&gt;  {(1.3452 * car + 0.2828 * truck), (flower)}

This mitigates the problem of identifying synonymy, as the rank lowering is expected to merge the dimensions associated with terms that have similar meanings. It also mitigates the problem with [[polysemy]], since components of polysemous words that point in the "right" direction are added to the components of words that share a similar meaning. Conversely, components that point in other directions tend to either simply cancel out, or, at worst, to be smaller than components in the directions corresponding to the intended sense.

=== Derivation ===
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a matrix where element &lt;math&gt;(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; describes the occurrence of term &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in document &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; (this can be, for example, the frequency). &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; will look like this:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix} 
 &amp; \textbf{d}_j \\
 &amp; \downarrow \\
\textbf{t}_i^T \rightarrow &amp;
\begin{bmatrix} 
x_{1,1} &amp; \dots &amp; x_{1,j} &amp; \dots &amp; x_{1,n} \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
x_{i,1} &amp; \dots &amp; x_{i,j} &amp;  \dots &amp; x_{i,n} \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
x_{m,1} &amp; \dots &amp; x_{m,j} &amp; \dots &amp; x_{m,n} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now a row in this matrix will be a vector corresponding to a term, giving its relation to each document:

:&lt;math&gt;\textbf{t}_i^T = \begin{bmatrix} x_{i,1} &amp; \dots &amp; x_{i,j} &amp; \dots &amp; x_{i,n} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, a column in this matrix will be a vector corresponding to a document, giving its relation to each term:

:&lt;math&gt;\textbf{d}_j = \begin{bmatrix}
x_{1,j} \\
\vdots \\
x_{i,j} \\
\vdots \\
x_{m,j} \\
 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Now the [[dot product]] &lt;math&gt;\textbf{t}_i^T \textbf{t}_p&lt;/math&gt; between two term vectors gives the [[correlation]] between the terms over the set of documents. The [[matrix product]] &lt;math&gt;X X^T&lt;/math&gt; contains all these dot products. Element &lt;math&gt;(i,p)&lt;/math&gt; (which is equal to element &lt;math&gt;(p,i)&lt;/math&gt;) contains the dot product &lt;math&gt;\textbf{t}_i^T \textbf{t}_p&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt; = \textbf{t}_p^T \textbf{t}_i&lt;/math&gt;). Likewise, the matrix &lt;math&gt;X^T X&lt;/math&gt; contains the dot products between all the document vectors, giving their correlation over the terms: &lt;math&gt;\textbf{d}_j^T \textbf{d}_q = \textbf{d}_q^T \textbf{d}_j&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, from the theory of linear algebra, there exists a decomposition of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]] and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a [[diagonal matrix]]. This is called a [[singular value decomposition]] (SVD):

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
X = U \Sigma V^T
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The matrix products giving us the term and document correlations then become

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
X X^T &amp;=&amp; (U \Sigma V^T) (U \Sigma V^T)^T = (U \Sigma V^T) (V^{T^T} \Sigma^T U^T) = U \Sigma V^T V \Sigma^T U^T = U \Sigma \Sigma^T U^T = U \Sigma^2 U^T \\
X^T X &amp;=&amp; (U \Sigma V^T)^T (U \Sigma V^T) = (V^{T^T} \Sigma^T U^T) (U \Sigma V^T) = V \Sigma^T U^T U \Sigma V^T = V \Sigma^T \Sigma V^T = V \Sigma^2 V^T
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \Sigma^T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^T \Sigma&lt;/math&gt; are diagonal we see that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; must contain the [[eigenvector]]s of &lt;math&gt;X X^T&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; must be the eigenvectors of &lt;math&gt;X^T X&lt;/math&gt;. Both products have the same non-zero eigenvalues, given by the non-zero entries of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \Sigma^T&lt;/math&gt;, or equally, by the non-zero entries of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^T\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Now the decomposition looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix} 
 &amp; X &amp; &amp; &amp; U &amp; &amp; \Sigma &amp; &amp; V^T \\
 &amp; (\textbf{d}_j) &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; (\hat{\textbf{d}}_j) \\
 &amp; \downarrow &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \downarrow \\
(\textbf{t}_i^T) \rightarrow 
&amp;
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{1,1} &amp; \dots &amp; x_{1,j} &amp; \dots &amp; x_{1,n} \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
x_{i,1} &amp; \dots &amp; x_{i,j} &amp;  \dots &amp; x_{i,n} \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
x_{m,1} &amp; \dots &amp; x_{m,j} &amp; \dots &amp; x_{m,n} \\
\end{bmatrix}
&amp;
=
&amp;
(\hat{\textbf{t}}_i^T) \rightarrow
&amp;
\begin{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix} \, \\ \, \\ \textbf{u}_1 \\ \, \\ \,\end{bmatrix} 
\dots
\begin{bmatrix} \, \\ \, \\ \textbf{u}_l \\ \, \\ \, \end{bmatrix}
\end{bmatrix}
&amp;
\cdot
&amp;
\begin{bmatrix} 
\sigma_1 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; \dots &amp; \sigma_l \\
\end{bmatrix}
&amp;
\cdot
&amp;
\begin{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix} &amp; &amp; \textbf{v}_1 &amp; &amp; \end{bmatrix} \\
\vdots \\
\begin{bmatrix} &amp; &amp; \textbf{v}_l &amp; &amp; \end{bmatrix}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The values &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_l&lt;/math&gt; are called the singular values, and &lt;math&gt;u_1, \dots, u_l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_1, \dots, v_l&lt;/math&gt; the left and right singular vectors.
Notice the only part of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that contributes to &lt;math&gt;\textbf{t}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i\textrm{'th}&lt;/math&gt; row.
Let this row vector be called &lt;math&gt;\hat{\textrm{t}}^T_i&lt;/math&gt;.
Likewise, the only part of &lt;math&gt;V^T&lt;/math&gt; that contributes to &lt;math&gt;\textbf{d}_j&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;j\textrm{'th}&lt;/math&gt; column, &lt;math&gt;\hat{ \textrm{d}}_j&lt;/math&gt;.
These are ''not'' the eigenvectors, but ''depend'' on ''all'' the eigenvectors.

It turns out that when you select the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; largest singular values, and their corresponding singular vectors from &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, you get the rank &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; approximation to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with the smallest error ([[Frobenius norm]]). This approximation has a minimal error.  But more importantly we can now treat the term and document vectors as a "semantic space". The row "term" vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\textbf{t}}^T_i&lt;/math&gt; then has &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; entries mapping it to a lower-dimensional space dimensions. These new dimensions do not relate to any comprehensible concepts. They are a lower-dimensional approximation of the higher-dimensional space. Likewise, the "document" vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\textbf{d}}_j&lt;/math&gt; is an approximation in this lower-dimensional space. We write this approximation as

:&lt;math&gt;X_k = U_k \Sigma_k V_k^T&lt;/math&gt;

You can now do the following:
* See how related documents &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are in the low-dimensional space by comparing the vectors &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k \hat{\textbf{d}}_j &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k \hat{\textbf{d}}_q &lt;/math&gt; (typically by [[vector space model|cosine similarity]]).
* Comparing terms &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; by comparing the vectors &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k \hat{\textbf{t}}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k \hat{\textbf{t}}_p&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;\hat{\textbf{t}}&lt;/math&gt; is now a column vector.
* Documents and term vector representations can be clustered using traditional clustering algorithms like k-means using similarity measures like cosine.
* Given a query, view this as a mini document, and compare it to your documents in the low-dimensional space.

To do the latter, you must first translate your query into the low-dimensional space. It is then intuitive that you must use the same transformation that you use on your documents:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\textbf{d}}_j = \Sigma_k^{-1}U_k^T{\textbf{d}}_j &lt;/math&gt; 

Note here that the inverse of the diagonal matrix &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k&lt;/math&gt; may be found by inverting each nonzero value within the matrix.

This means that if you have a query vector &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, you must do the translation &lt;math&gt;\hat{\textbf{q}} = \Sigma_k^{-1} U_k^T \textbf{q}&lt;/math&gt; before you compare it with the document vectors in the low-dimensional space. You can do the same for pseudo term vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;\textbf{t}_i^T = \hat{\textbf{t}}_i^T \Sigma_k V_k^T&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\textbf{t}}_i^T = \textbf{t}_i^T V_k^{-T} \Sigma_k^{-1} = \textbf{t}_i^T V_k \Sigma_k^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\textbf{t}}_i = \Sigma_k^{-1}  V_k^T \textbf{t}_i&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==

The new low-dimensional space typically can be used to:
* Compare the documents in the low-dimensional space ([[data clustering]], [[document classification]]).
* Find similar documents across languages, after analyzing a base set of translated documents ([[cross language retrieval]]).
* Find relations between terms ([[synonymy]] and [[polysemy]]).
* Given a query of terms, translate it into the low-dimensional space, and find matching documents ([[information retrieval]]).
* Find the best similarity between small groups of terms, in a semantic way (i.e. in a context of a knowledge corpus), as for example in multi choice questions [[Multiple choice question|MCQ]] answering model.&lt;ref name="Alain2009"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/38/41/43/PDF/eLSA1-brm20.pdf |format=PDF| title=Effect of tuned parameters on an LSA multiple choice questions answering model |author1=Alain Lifchitz |author2=Sandra Jhean-Larose |author3=Guy Denhière | journal=Behavior Research Methods | volume=41 | issue=4 | pages=1201–1209 | year=2009  | doi=10.3758/BRM.41.4.1201 | pmid=19897829 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Expand the feature space of machine learning / text mining systems &lt;ref name="Galvez2017"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877750317300091 | title=Assessing the usefulness of online message board mining in automatic stock prediction systems |author1=Ramiro H.

* Analyze word association in text corpus &lt;ref name="Altszyler2017"&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810017301034 | title=The interpretation of dream meaning: Resolving ambiguity using Latent Semantic Analysis in a small corpus of text |author1=Altszyler, E. |author2=Ribeiro, S. | author3= Sigman, M.|author4=Fernández Slezak, D. | journal=Consciousness and Cognition | volume=56 | pages=178–187 | year=2017 | doi=10.1016/j.concog.2017.09.004| pmid=28943127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Synonymy and polysemy are fundamental problems in [[natural language processing]]: 
* Synonymy is the phenomenon where different words describe the same idea. Thus, a query in a search engine may fail to retrieve a relevant document that does not contain the words which appeared in the query. For example, a search for "doctors" may not return a document containing the word "[[physicians]]", even though the words have the same meaning.
* Polysemy is the phenomenon where the same word has multiple meanings. So a search may retrieve irrelevant documents containing the desired words in the wrong meaning. For example, a botanist and a computer scientist looking for the word "tree" probably desire different sets of documents.

LSA has been used to assist in performing [[prior art]] searches for [[patents]].&lt;ref name="Gerry2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Gerry J.

=== Applications in human memory ===

The use of Latent Semantic Analysis has been prevalent in the study of human memory, especially in areas of [[free recall]] and memory search.  There is a positive correlation between the semantic similarity of two words (as measured by LSA) and the probability that the words would be recalled one after another in free recall tasks using study lists of random common nouns. They also noted that in these situations, the inter-response time between the similar words was much quicker than between dissimilar words.  These findings are referred to as the [[Semantic Proximity Effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/25/4/923.pdf |format=PDF| title=Contextual Variability and Serial Position Effects in Free Recall |author1=Marc W. Howard |author2=Michael J. Kahana |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When participants made mistakes in recalling studied items, these mistakes tended to be items that were more semantically related to the desired item and found in a previously studied list.  These prior-list intrusions, as they have come to be called, seem to compete with items on the current list for recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://memory.psych.upenn.edu/files/pubs/ZaroEtal06.pdf |format=PDF| title=Temporal Associations and Prior-List Intrusions in Free Recall | author=Franklin M. Zaromb| booktitle=Interspeech'2005|year=2006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model, termed [[Word Association Spaces]] (WAS) is also used in memory studies by collecting free association data from a series of experiments and which includes measures of word relatedness for over 72,000 distinct word pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Douglas|title=The University of South Florida Word Association, Rhyme and Word Fragment Norms|url=http://w3.usf.edu/FreeAssociation/Intro.html|accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==

The [[Singular Value Decomposition|SVD]] is typically computed using large matrix methods (for example, [[Lanczos method]]s) but may also be computed incrementally and with greatly reduced resources via a [[neural network]]-like approach, which does not require the large, full-rank matrix to be held in memory.&lt;ref name="Genevi2005"&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~genevieve/gorrell_webb.pdf | format=PDF | title=Generalized Hebbian Algorithm for Latent Semantic Analysis | author1=Geneviève Gorrell | author2=Brandyn Webb | booktitle=Interspeech'2005 | year=2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221063926/http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~genevieve/gorrell_webb.pdf | archivedate=2008-12-21 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A fast, incremental, low-memory, large-matrix SVD algorithm has recently been developed.&lt;ref name="brand2006"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.merl.com/reports/docs/TR2006-059.pdf |format=PDF| title=Fast Low-Rank Modifications of the Thin Singular Value Decomposition | author=Matthew Brand | journal=Linear Algebra and its Applications | volume=415 | pages=20–30 | year=2006 | doi=10.1016/j.laa.2005.07.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://web.mit.edu/~wingated/www/resources.html MATLAB] and [http://radimrehurek.com/gensim Python] implementations of these fast algorithms are available. Unlike Gorrell and Webb's (2005) stochastic approximation, Brand's algorithm (2003) provides an exact solution.
In recent years progress has been made to reduce the computational complexity of SVD; for instance, by using a parallel ARPACK algorithm to perform parallel eigenvalue decomposition it is possible to speed up the SVD computation cost while providing comparable prediction quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | doi = 10.1109/ICCSNT.2011.6182070 | title=A parallel implementation of Singular Value Decomposition based on Map-Reduce and PARPACK | journal=Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Computer Science and Network Technology | pages=739–741 | year=2011 | last1 = Ding | first1 = Yaguang | last2 = Zhu | first2 = Guofeng | last3 = Cui | first3 = Chenyang | last4 = Zhou | first4 = Jian | last5 = Tao | first5 = Liang| isbn=978-1-4577-1587-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
Some of LSA's drawbacks include:

* The resulting dimensions might be difficult to interpret. For instance, in
:: {(car), (truck), (flower)} ↦  {(1.3452 * car + 0.2828 * truck), (flower)}
:the (1.3452 * car + 0.2828 * truck) component could be interpreted as "vehicle". However, it is very likely that cases close to
:: {(car), (bottle), (flower)} ↦  {(1.3452 * car + 0.2828 * '''bottle'''), (flower)}
:will occur. This leads to results which can be justified on the mathematical level, but have no interpretable meaning in natural language.

* LSA cannot capture [[polysemy]] (i.e., multiple meanings of a word) because each occurrence of a word is treated as having the same meaning due to the word being represented as a single point in space.{{citation needed|reason=This limitation seems to be in contradiction with one the "Applications"|date=December 2017}}. For example, the occurrence of "chair" in a document containing "The Chair of the Board" and in a separate document containing "the chair maker" are considered the same.  The behavior results in the vector representation being an ''average'' of all the word's different meanings in the corpus, which can make it difficult for comparison.  However, the effect is often lessened due to words having a [[word sense disambiguation|predominant sense]] throughout a corpus (i.e. not all meanings are equally likely).
* Limitations of [[bag of words model]] (BOW), where a text is represented as an unordered collection of words. To address some of the limitation of [[bag of words model]] (BOW), [[N-gram|multi-gram]] dictionary can be used to find direct and indirect association as well as [[Higher-order statistics|higher-order]] [[co-occurrence]]s among terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/12/1/324|title=Empirical study using network of semantically related associations in bridging the knowledge gap|first1=Vida|last1=Abedi|first2=Mohammed|last2=Yeasin|first3=Ramin|last3=Zand|date=27 November 2014|volume=12|issue=1|pages=324|doi=10.1186/s12967-014-0324-9|pmid=25428570|pmc=4252998|journal=Journal of Translational Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[probabilistic model]] of LSA does not match observed data: LSA assumes that words and documents form a joint [[normal distribution|Gaussian]] model ([[ergodic hypothesis]]), while a [[Poisson distribution]] has been observed.  Thus, a newer alternative is [[probabilistic latent semantic analysis]], based on a [[multinomial distribution|multinomial]] model, which is reported to give better results than standard LSA.&lt;ref name="Thomas1999"&gt;{{cite conference|title=Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis|author=Thomas Hofmann|booktitle=Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence|year=1999|arxiv = 1301.6705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative methods==

===Semantic hashing===
In semantic hashing &lt;ref&gt;Salakhutdinov, Ruslan, and Geoffrey Hinton. "Semantic hashing." RBM 500.3 (2007): 500.&lt;/ref&gt; documents are mapped to memory addresses by means of a [[neural network]] in such a way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses. [[Deep learning|Deep neural network]] essentially builds a [[graphical model]] of the word-count vectors obtained from a large set of documents. Documents similar to a query document can then be found by simply accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the query document. This way of extending the efficiency of hash-coding to approximate matching is much faster than [[locality sensitive hashing]], which is the fastest current method.

===Latent semantic indexing===
'''Latent semantic indexing''' ('''LSI''') is an indexing and retrieval method that uses a mathematical technique called [[singular value decomposition]] (SVD) to identify patterns in the relationships between the [[terminology|term]]s and [[concept]]s contained in an unstructured collection of text.  LSI is based on the principle that words that are used in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings.  A key feature of LSI is its ability to extract the conceptual content of a [[Text corpus|body of text]] by establishing associations between those terms that occur in similar [[context (language use)|context]]s.&lt;ref name=deerwester1988&gt;Deerwester, S., et al, Improving Information Retrieval with Latent Semantic Indexing, Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the American Society for Information Science 25, 1988, pp. 36–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

LSI is also an application of [[correspondence analysis]], a multivariate statistical technique developed by [[Jean-Paul Benzécri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book
 | author = Benzécri, J.-P.
 | publisher=Dunod |location= Paris, France
 | year = 1973
 | title = L'Analyse des Données. Volume II. L'Analyse des Correspondences
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1970s, to a [[contingency table]] built from word counts in documents.

Called "{{em|latent semantic}} indexing" because of its ability to correlate {{em|semantically}} related terms that are {{em|latent}} in a collection of text, it was first applied to text at [[Bellcore]] in the late 1980s.   The method, also called latent semantic analysis (LSA), uncovers the underlying latent semantic structure in the usage of words in a body of text and how it can be used to extract the meaning of the text in response to user queries, commonly referred to as concept searches.  Queries, or concept searches, against a set of documents that have undergone LSI will return results that are conceptually similar in meaning to the search criteria even if the results don’t share a specific word or words with the search criteria.

== Benefits of LSI ==

LSI overcomes two of the most problematic constraints of Boolean [[keyword search|keyword queries]]:  multiple words that have similar meanings ([[synonymy]]) and {{clarify|reason=A previous point in the "Limitations" told LSA cannot capture polysemy. This sentence seems contradictory|text= words that have more than one meaning ([[polysemy]])|date=December 2017}}.  Synonymy is often the cause of mismatches in the vocabulary used by the authors of documents and the users of [[information retrieval]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Furnas | first1 = G. W. | last2 = Landauer | first2 = T. K. | last3 = Gomez | first3 = L. M. | last4 = Dumais | first4 = S. T. | title = The vocabulary problem in human-system communication | doi = 10.1145/32206.32212 | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 30 | issue = 11 | pages = 964–971 | year = 1987 | pmid =  | pmc = | citeseerx = 10.1.1.118.4768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, Boolean or keyword queries often return irrelevant results and miss information that is relevant.

LSI is also used to perform automated [[document categorization]].  In fact, several experiments have demonstrated that there are a number of correlations between the way LSI and humans process and categorize text.&lt;ref name=landauer2008&gt;Landauer, T., et al., Learning Human-like Knowledge by Singular Value Decomposition: A Progress Report, M. I. Jordan, M. J. Kearns &amp; S. A. Solla (Eds.), Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 10, Cambridge: MIT Press, 1998, pp. 45–51.&lt;/ref&gt;    Document categorization is the assignment of documents to one or more predefined categories based on their similarity to the conceptual content of the categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Dumais | first1 = S. | last2 = Platt | first2 = J. | last3 = Heckerman | first3 = D. | last4 = Sahami | first4 = M. | chapter = Inductive learning algorithms and representations for text categorization | doi = 10.1145/288627.288651 | title = Proceedings of the seventh international conference on Information and knowledge management  - CIKM '98 | pages = 148 | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-1581130614 | chapter-url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/jplatt/cikm98.pdf| pmid =  | pmc = | citeseerx = 10.1.1.80.8909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   LSI uses ''example'' documents to establish the conceptual basis for each category.  During categorization processing, the concepts contained in the documents being categorized are compared to the concepts contained in the example items, and a category (or categories) is assigned to the documents based on the similarities between the concepts they contain and the concepts that are contained in the example documents.

Dynamic clustering based on the conceptual content of documents can also be accomplished using LSI.  Clustering is a way to group documents based on their conceptual similarity to each other without using example documents to establish the conceptual basis for each cluster.  This is very useful when dealing with an unknown collection of unstructured text.

Because it uses a strictly mathematical approach, LSI is inherently independent of language.  This enables LSI to elicit the semantic content of information written in any language without requiring the use of auxiliary structures, such as dictionaries and thesauri.  LSI can also perform cross-linguistic concept searching and example-based categorization.  For example, queries can be made in one language, such as English, and conceptually similar results will be returned even if they are composed of an entirely different language or of multiple languages.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

LSI is not restricted to working only with words.  It can also process arbitrary character strings.  Any object that can be expressed as text can be represented in an LSI vector space. For example, tests with MEDLINE abstracts have shown that LSI is able to effectively classify genes based on conceptual modeling of the biological information contained in the titles and abstracts of the MEDLINE citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Homayouni | first1 = R. | last2 = Heinrich | first2 = K. | last3 = Wei | first3 = L. | last4 = Berry | first4 = M. W. | title = Gene clustering by Latent Semantic Indexing of MEDLINE abstracts | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/bth464 | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 104–115 | year = 2004 | pmid =  15308538| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

LSI automatically adapts to new and changing terminology, and has been shown to be very tolerant of noise (i.e., misspelled words, typographical errors, unreadable characters, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Price | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Zukas | first2 = A. E. | chapter = Application of Latent Semantic Indexing to Processing of Noisy Text | doi = 10.1007/11427995_68 | title = Intelligence and Security Informatics | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume = 3495 | pages = 602 | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-3-540-25999-2 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;   This is especially important for applications using text derived from Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and speech-to-text conversion.  LSI also deals effectively with sparse, ambiguous, and contradictory data.

Text does not need to be in sentence form for LSI to be effective.  It can work with lists, free-form notes, email, Web-based content, etc.  As long as a collection of text contains multiple terms, LSI can be used to identify patterns in the relationships between the important terms and concepts contained in the text.

LSI has proven to be a useful solution to a number of conceptual matching problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ding, C., A Similarity-based Probability Model for Latent Semantic Indexing, Proceedings of the 22nd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 1999, pp. 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartell, B., Cottrell, G., and Belew, R., Latent Semantic Indexing is an Optimal Special Case of Multidimensional Scaling, Proceedings, ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 1992, pp. 161–167.&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique has been shown to capture key relationship information, including causal, goal-oriented, and taxonomic information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Graesser, A. |author2=Karnavat, A.|title=Latent Semantic Analysis Captures Causal, Goal-oriented, and Taxonomic Structures|journal=Proceedings of CogSci 2000|pages=184–189|citeseerx = 10.1.1.23.5444|year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematics of LSI ==

LSI uses common linear algebra techniques to learn the conceptual correlations in a collection of text.  In general, the process involves constructing a weighted term-document matrix, performing a [[Singular value decomposition|'''Singular Value Decomposition''']] on the matrix, and using the matrix to identify the concepts contained in the text.

=== Term-document matrix ===

LSI begins by constructing a term-document matrix, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, to identify the occurrences of the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; unique terms within a collection of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; documents.  In a term-document matrix, each term is represented by a row, and each document is represented by a column, with each matrix cell, &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, initially representing the number of times the associated term appears in the indicated document, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{tf_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt;.  This matrix is usually very large and very sparse.

Once a term-document matrix is constructed, local and global weighting functions can be applied to it to condition the data.  The weighting functions transform each cell, &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, to be the product of a local term weight, &lt;math&gt;l_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the relative frequency of a term in a document, and a global weight, &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the relative frequency of the term within the entire collection of documents.

Some common local weighting functions&lt;ref&gt;
Berry, M. W., and Browne, M., Understanding Search Engines: Mathematical Modeling and Text Retrieval, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia, (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; are defined in the following table.

{| style="width:60%" cellpadding="25" cellspacing="5" align="center"
|-
|  style="width:22%" | '''Binary''' ||
| &lt;math&gt;l_{ij} = 1&lt;/math&gt; if the term exists in the document, or else &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|  style="width:22%" | '''TermFrequency''' ||
| &lt;math&gt;l_{ij} = \mathrm{tf}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, the number of occurrences of term &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in document &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|  style="width:22%" | '''Log''' ||
| &lt;math&gt;l_{ij} = \log(\mathrm{tf}_{ij} + 1)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|  style="width:22%" | '''Augnorm''' ||
| &lt;math&gt;l_{ij} = \frac{\Big(\frac{\mathrm{tf}_{ij}}{\max_i(\mathrm{tf}_{ij})}\Big) + 1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Some common global weighting functions are defined in the following table.

{| style="width:60%" cellpadding="25" cellspacing="5" align="center"
|-
| style="width:22%" | '''Binary''' ||
| &lt;math&gt;g_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="width:22%" | '''Normal''' ||
| &lt;math&gt;g_i = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sum_j \mathrm{tf}_{ij}^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="width:22%" | '''GfIdf''' ||
| &lt;math&gt;g_i = \mathrm{gf}_i / \mathrm{df}_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{gf}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of times term &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; occurs in the whole collection, and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{df}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of documents in which term &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; occurs.
|-
| style="width:22%" | '''[[Tf–idf#Inverse document frequency 2|Idf (Inverse Document Frequency)]]''' ||
| &lt;math&gt;g_i = \log_2 \frac{n}{1+ \mathrm{df}_i}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="width:22%" | '''Entropy''' ||
| &lt;math&gt;g_i = 1 + \sum_j \frac{p_{ij} \log p_{ij}}{\log n}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p_{ij} = \frac{\mathrm{tf}_{ij}}{\mathrm{gf}_i}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Empirical studies with LSI report that the Log and Entropy weighting functions work well, in practice, with many data sets.&lt;ref&gt;Landauer, T., et al., Handbook of Latent Semantic Analysis, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, each entry &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is computed as:

:&lt;math&gt;g_i = 1 + \sum_j \frac{p_{ij} \log p_{ij}}{\log n}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a_{ij} = g_i \ \log (\mathrm{tf}_{ij} + 1)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Rank-reduced singular value decomposition ===

A rank-reduced, [[singular value decomposition]] is performed on the matrix to determine patterns in the relationships between the terms and concepts contained in the text.  The SVD forms the foundation for LSI.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Michael W., Dumais, Susan T., O'Brien, Gavin W., Using Linear Algebra for Intelligent Information Retrieval, December 1994, SIAM Review 37:4 (1995), pp. 573–595.&lt;/ref&gt;   It computes the term and document vector spaces by approximating the single term-frequency matrix, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, into three other matrices— an '''''m''''' by '''''r'''''  term-concept vector matrix &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, an '''''r''''' by '''''r''''' singular values matrix &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and a '''''n''''' by '''''r''''' concept-document vector matrix, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, which satisfy the following relations:

&lt;math&gt;A \approx TSD^T&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T^T T = I_r \quad D^T D = I_r &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S_{1,1} \geq S_{2,2} \geq \ldots \geq  S_{r,r} &gt; 0 \quad S_{i,j} = 0 \; \text{where} \; i \neq j&lt;/math&gt;

In the formula, '''A''' is the supplied '''''m''''' by '''''n''''' weighted matrix of term frequencies in a collection of text where '''''m''''' is the number of unique terms, and '''''n''''' is the number of documents.  '''T''' is a computed '''''m''''' by '''''r''''' matrix of term vectors where '''''r''''' is the rank of '''A'''—a measure of its unique dimensions '''≤ min(''m,n'')'''.  '''S''' is a computed '''''r''''' by '''''r''''' diagonal matrix of decreasing singular values, and '''D''' is a computed '''''n''''' by '''''r''''' matrix of document vectors.

The SVD is then [[Singular value decomposition#Truncated SVD|truncated]] to reduce the rank by keeping only the largest '''''k''''' « '''''r''''' diagonal entries in the singular value matrix '''S''',
where '''''k''''' is typically on the order 100 to 300 dimensions.
This effectively reduces the term and document vector matrix sizes to '''''m''''' by '''''k''''' and '''''n''''' by '''''k''''' respectively.  The SVD operation, along with this reduction, has the effect of preserving the most important semantic information in the text while reducing noise and other undesirable artifacts of the original space of '''A'''.  This reduced set of matrices is often denoted with a modified formula such as:

:::::::'''A ≈ A''&lt;sub&gt;k''&lt;/sub&gt; = T''&lt;sub&gt;k''&lt;/sub&gt; S''&lt;sub&gt;k''&lt;/sub&gt; D''&lt;sub&gt;k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''

Efficient LSI algorithms only compute the first '''''k''''' singular values and term and document vectors as opposed to computing a full SVD and then truncating it.

Note that this rank reduction is essentially the same as doing [[Principal Component Analysis]] (PCA) on the matrix '''A''', except that PCA subtracts off the means.  PCA loses the sparseness of the '''A''' matrix, which can make it infeasible for large lexicons.

== Querying and augmenting LSI vector spaces ==

The computed '''T''&lt;sub&gt;k''&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''D''&lt;sub&gt;k''&lt;/sub&gt;''' matrices define the term and document vector spaces, which with the computed singular values, '''S''&lt;sub&gt;k''&lt;/sub&gt;''', embody the conceptual information derived from the document collection.  The similarity of terms or documents within these spaces is a factor of how close they are to each other in these spaces, typically computed as a function of the angle between the corresponding vectors.

The same steps are used to locate the vectors representing the text of queries and new documents within the document space of an existing LSI index.  By a simple transformation of the '''A = T S D&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''' equation into the equivalent '''D = A&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; T S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''' equation, a new vector, '''''d''''', for a query or for a new document can be created by computing a new column in '''A''' and then multiplying the new column by '''T S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'''.  The new column in '''A''' is computed using the originally derived global term weights and applying the same local weighting function to the terms in the query or in the new document.

A drawback to computing vectors in this way, when adding new searchable documents, is that terms that were not known during the SVD phase for the original index are ignored.  These terms will have no impact on the global weights and learned correlations derived from the original collection of text.  However, the computed vectors for the new text are still very relevant for similarity comparisons with all other document vectors.

The process of augmenting the document vector spaces for an LSI index with new documents in this manner is called ''folding in''.  Although the folding-in process does not account for the new semantic content of the new text, adding a substantial number of documents in this way will still provide good results for queries as long as the terms and concepts they contain are well represented within the LSI index to which they are being added.  When the terms and concepts of a new set of documents need to be included in an LSI index, either the term-document matrix, and the SVD, must be recomputed or an incremental update method (such as the one described in &lt;ref name="brand2006"/&gt;) be used.

== Additional uses of LSI ==

It is generally acknowledged that the ability to work with text on a semantic basis is essential to modern information retrieval systems.  As a result, the use of LSI has significantly expanded in recent years as earlier challenges in scalability and performance have been overcome.

LSI is being used in a variety of information retrieval and text processing applications, although its primary application has been for concept searching and automated document categorization.&lt;ref&gt;Dumais, S., Latent Semantic Analysis, ARIST Review of Information Science and Technology, vol. 38, 2004, Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;   Below are some other ways in which LSI is being used:

LSI is increasingly being used for electronic document discovery (eDiscovery) to help enterprises prepare for litigation.  In eDiscovery, the ability to cluster, categorize, and search large collections of unstructured text on a conceptual basis is essential.  Concept-based searching using LSI has been applied to the eDiscovery process by leading providers as early as 2003.&lt;ref&gt;There Has to be a Better Way to Search, 2008, White Paper, Fios, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges to LSI ==

Early challenges to LSI focused on scalability and performance.  LSI requires relatively high computational performance and memory in comparison to other information retrieval techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Karypis, G., Han, E., Fast Supervised Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm with Applications to Document Categorization and Retrieval, Proceedings of CIKM-00, 9th ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with the implementation of modern high-speed processors and the availability of inexpensive memory, these considerations have been largely overcome.  Real-world applications involving more than 30 million documents that were fully processed through the matrix and SVD computations are common in some LSI applications. A fully scalable (unlimited number of documents, online training) implementation of LSI is contained in the open source [[gensim]] software package.&lt;ref name="rehurek2011"&gt;{{cite book | title=Subspace Tracking for Latent Semantic Analysis | author=Radim Řehůřek | journal=Advances in Information Retrieval - 33rd European Conference on IR Research, ECIR 2011 | volume=6611 | pages=289–300 | year=2011 | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-20161-5_29 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-642-20160-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another challenge to LSI has been the alleged difficulty in determining the optimal number of dimensions to use for performing the SVD.  As a general rule, fewer dimensions allow for broader comparisons of the concepts contained in a collection of text, while a higher number of dimensions enable more specific (or more relevant) comparisons of concepts.  The actual number of dimensions that can be used is limited by the number of documents in the collection.  Research has demonstrated that around 300 dimensions will usually provide the best results with moderate-sized document collections (hundreds of thousands of documents) and perhaps 400 dimensions for larger document collections (millions of documents).&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, R., An Empirical Study of Required Dimensionality for Large-scale Latent Semantic Indexing Applications, Proceedings of the 17th ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, Napa Valley, California, USA, 2008, pp. 153–162.&lt;/ref&gt;   However, recent studies indicate that 50-1000 dimensions are suitable depending on the size and nature of the document collection.&lt;ref name=landauer2008b&gt;Landauer, Thomas K., and Dumais, Susan T., Latent Semantic Analysis, Scholarpedia, 3(11):4356, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Checking the amount of variance in the data after computing the SVD can be used to determine the optimal number of dimensions to retain.  The variance contained in the data can be viewed by plotting the singular values (S) in a [[scree plot]].  Some LSI practitioners select the dimensionality associated with the knee of the curve as the cut-off point for the number of dimensions to retain.  Others argue that some quantity of the variance must be retained, and the amount of variance in the data should dictate the proper dimensionality to retain.  Seventy percent is often mentioned as the amount of variance in the data that should be used to select the optimal dimensionality for recomputing the SVD.&lt;ref&gt;Cangelosi, R., Goriely A., Component Retention In Principal Component Analysis With Application to Cdna Microarray Data, BMC Biology Direct 2(2) (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jolliffe, L. T., Principal Component Analysis, Springer-Verlag, New York, (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hu, X., Z. Cai, et al., LSA: First Dimension and Dimensional Weighting, 25th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[phonetics]], '''liquids''' or '''liquid consonants''' are a class of [[consonant]]s consisting of [[lateral approximant]]s like 'l' together with [[rhotic consonant|rhotics]] like 'r'.&lt;ref name="lm182"&gt;{{SOWL|182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Liquids as a class often behave in a similar way in the [[phonotactics]] of a language: for example, they often have the greatest freedom in occurring in [[consonant cluster]]s.&lt;ref name="lm182"/&gt; In many languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]], there is a single liquid phoneme that has both lateral and rhotic [[allophone]]s.&lt;ref name="lm182"/&gt;

[[English language|English]] has two liquid phonemes, one lateral, {{IPAslink|l}} and one rhotic, {{IPAslink|ɹ}}, exemplified in the words '''''l'''ed'' and '''''r'''ed''.

Many other European languages have one lateral and one rhotic phoneme. Some, such as [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]], have more than two liquid phonemes. All three languages have the set {{IPA|/l/ /ʎ/ /r/}}, with two laterals and one rhotic. Similarly, the [[Languages of Iberia|Iberian languages]] contrast four liquid phonemes. {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/ʎ/}}, {{IPA|/ɾ/}}, and a fourth phoneme that is an [[alveolar trill]] in all but some varieties of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], where it is a [[uvular consonant|uvular]] trill or fricative. Some European languages, like [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Irish language|Irish]], contrast a [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] lateral–rhotic pair with an unpalatalized (or [[velarization|velarized]]) set (e.g. {{IPA|/lʲ/ /rʲ/ /l/ /r/}} in Russian). [[Czech language|Czech]] uses two liquid consonants and its grammar allows the creation of numerous long, sound vowel-less sentences with liquid consonants underlying every syllable ([[strč prst skrz krk]], or "push your finger through your throat", is a classic example).

Elsewhere in the world, two liquids of the types mentioned above remains the most common attribute of a language's consonant inventory except in North America and [[indigenous Australian languages|Australia]]. In North America, a majority of languages do not have rhotics at all and there is a wide variety of [[lateral consonant|lateral sounds]] though most are [[obstruent]] laterals rather than liquids. Most indigenous Australian languages are very rich in liquids, with some having as many as seven distinct liquids. They typically include dental, alveolar, retroflex and palatal laterals, and as many as three rhotics.

On the other side, there are many indigenous languages in the [[Amazon Basin]] and eastern North America, as well as a few in Asia and Africa, with no liquids.

[[Polynesian languages]] typically have only one liquid, which may be either a lateral or a rhotic. Non-Polynesian [[Oceanic languages]] usually have both {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}}, occasionally more (e.g. [[Araki language|Araki]] has {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/ɾ/}}, {{IPA|/r/}}) or less (e.g. [[Mwotlap language|Mwotlap]] has only {{IPA|/l/}}). [[Hiw language|Hiw]] is unusual in having a [[Pre-stopped consonant|prestopped]] [[velar lateral approximant|velar lateral]] {{IPA|/ᶢʟ/}} as its only liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The grammarian [[Dionysius Thrax]] used the Greek word ὑγρός (''hygrós'', "moist") to describe the {{IPA|/l,r,m,n/}} [[phoneme]]s of [[classical Greek]].&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;{{cite book
|title=Phonetics in ancient India

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most commentators assume that this referred to their "slippery" effect on [[meter (poetry)|meter]] in classical Greek verse when they occur as the second member of a consonant cluster.&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt;  This word was [[calque]]d into [[Latin]] as ''liquidus'', whence it has been retained in the Western European phonetic tradition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6129">'''Localization Industry Standards Association''' or '''LISA''' was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-based [[Trade association|trade body]] concerning the translation of computer software (and associated materials) into multiple [[natural languages]], which existed from 1990 to February 2011. It counted among its members most of the large [[information technology]] companies of the period, including [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[IBM]], [[McAfee]], [[Nokia]], [[Novell]] and [[Xerox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.w3.org/International/O-LISA-object.html |title=Objectives of LISA  |work=w3.org |year=2008  |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LISA played a significant role in representing its partners at the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iso.org/iso/about/organizations_in_liaison/organizations_in_liaison_details.htm?id=9299 |title=ISO - Organizations in cooperation with ISO - LISA |work=iso.org |year=2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[TBX|TermBase eXchange]] (TBX) standard developed by LISA was submitted to ISO in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.termnet.org/english/about_us/news_archive.php?we_objectID=237 |title=TermNet - International Network for Terminology |work=termnet.org |year=2011 |quote=Localization industry standard for terminology submitted for adoption by ISO TC37/SC3 |accessdate=11 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425154354/http://www.termnet.org/english/about_us/news_archive.php?we_objectID=237 |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and became [[ISO 30042:2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=45797 |title=ISO 30042:2008 - Systems to manage terminology, knowledge and content -- TermBase eXchange (TBX) |work=iso.org |year=2011 |quote=Systems to manage terminology, knowledge and content -- TermBase eXchange (TBX) |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; LISA also had a presence at the [[W3C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.w3.org/International/O-LISA.html |title=18n/l10n: LISA |work=w3.org |year=2008 |quote= LISA (Localisation Industry Standards Association) is an international organization of companies, whose goal is to set standards for localization of software.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11651">'''Low information voters''', also known as '''misinformation voters''', are people who may vote yet are generally poorly informed about issues. The phrase is mainly used in the United States and has become popular since the mid-1990s.

== Origins ==
American [[pollster]] and [[political scientist]] [[Samuel Popkin]] coined the term "low-information" in 1991 when he used the phrase "[[low-information signaling]]" in his book ''[[The Reasoning Voter: Communication and Persuasion in Presidential Campaigns]]''. Low-information signaling referred to cues or [[heuristics]] used by voters in lieu of substantial information to determine who to vote for. Examples include voters liking [[Bill Clinton]] for eating at [[McDonald's]] and perceiving [[John Kerry]] and [[Barack Obama]] as elitist for wind-surfing and golfing, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Diana|title=The Incredibly Shrinking Democrats|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1734826,00.html|accessdate=26 August 2012|newspaper=Time magazine|date=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning ==
The ideological views of most low-information voters tend to be more [[moderate]] than those of high-information voters. Low-information voters are less likely to vote and when they do they generally vote for a candidate they find personally appealing. They tend to be [[swing vote]]rs and they tend to vote [[split-ticket]] more than well-informed voters do. Researchers attribute this to low-information voters not having developed clear cut ideological preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palfrey|first=Thomas R.|author2=Keith T. Poole |title=The Relationship between Information, Ideology, and Voting Behavior|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=August 1987|volume=31|issue=3|pages=511–530|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2111281?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101169947187|accessdate=26 August 2012|doi=10.2307/2111281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauderdale|first=Benjamin E.|title=Does Inattention to Political Debate Explain the Polarization Gap Between the U.S. Congress and Public?|journal=unpublished|date=June 2012|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/lauderda/home/downloads/Lauderdale2012RR.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smalley|first=Suzanne|title=Just How Low Will They Go?|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/05/31/just-how-low-will-they-go.html|accessdate=26 August 2012|newspaper=Newsweek magazine|date=31 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linguist]] [[George Lakoff]] has written that the term is a pejorative mainly used by [[Modern liberalism in the United States|American liberals]] to refer to people who vote [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] against their own interests and assumes they do it because they lack sufficient information. Liberals, he said, attribute the problem in part to deliberate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] efforts at misinforming voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lakoff |first=George |title=Dumb and dumber: the low-information voter |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/ct-perspec-0809-info-20120809,0,6776606.story |accessdate=8 March 2015 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=9 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826013344/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/ct-perspec-0809-info-20120809%2C0%2C6776606.story |archivedate=26 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 article titled "Goodbye to All That: Reflections of a GOP Operative Who Left the Cult", thirty-year Republican [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] staffer [[Mike Lofgren]] characterized low-information voters as anti-intellectual and hostile-to-science "religious cranks" and claimed Republicans are deliberately manipulating low information voters to undermine their confidence in American democratic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lofgren|first=Mike|title=Goodbye to All That: Reflections of a GOP Operative Who Left the Cult|url=http://truth-out.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=3079:goodbye-to-all-that-reflections-of-a-gop-operative-who-left-the-cult#%5B3%5D|accessdate=26 August 2012|newspaper=Truthout|date=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular syndicated talk show host [[Rush Limbaugh]] became aware of the term in the aftermath of the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]], initially joking that it could be interpreted to signify [[stupidity]]. However, Limbaugh later clarified that a low information voter may also be considered in his view a "high [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] information voter", expounding on [[media bias]] thusly: "I have never said that low-information voters are stupid. I just said they don't know what they think they know. They are prisoners to the media, which has dumbed them down. Low-information voters can be doctors. Low-information voters can be scientists. They can be among all walks of life. It has nothing to do with IQ. It has to do with what they don't know because of their media sources. Low-information voters are clearly people that don't have all the information available to make a voting choice. That's all they are. And they're all over the place. And most of them do vote Democrat. Most of them did vote for Obama. It's not a comment on their intelligence. It's not that they're stupid or don't understand the issues. They just haven't had it all explained to them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Limbaugh|first=Rush|title=Colbert King's Low-Information Definition of the Term "Low-Information Voter"|url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2013/03/25/colbert_king_s_low_information_definition_of_the_term_low_information_voter|accessdate=27 April 2014|newspaper=Time magazine|date=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 paper by six American political scientists called "A Theory of Political Parties: Groups, Policy Demands and Nominations in American Politics" challenged the idea that Republicans want a low-information electorate and argued instead that both major American parties do. Noting that 95% of incumbents in the highly polarized House of Representatives win re-election despite voters' preference for [[centrist]] representation, the paper theorizes that voters' infrequent penalizing of extremist behaviour represents not approval, but a lack of attention and information. This, the paper says, is supported by the fact that when [[congressional districts]] and [[media market]]s overlap to create more informed electorates, extremist House members are at much greater risk for defeat. The paper proposes that in the American political system [[Advocacy group|interest groups]] and [[activists]] are the key actor and that the electorate is uninformed and bamboozled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bawn|first=Kathleen|author2=Cohen, Martin |author3=Karol, David |author4=Masket, Seth |author5=Noel, Hans |author6= Zaller, John |title=A Theory of Political Parties: Groups, Policy Demands and Nominations in American Politics|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=September 2012|volume=10|issue=03|pages=571–597|doi=10.1017/S1537592712001624|url=http://masket.net/Theory_of_Parties.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
A 1992 study found that in the absence of other information voters used candidates' physical attractiveness to draw inferences about their personal qualities and political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riggle|first=Ellen D.|author2=Ottati, Victor C. |author3=Wyer, Robert S. |author4=Kuklinski, James |author5= Schwarz, Norbert |title=Bases of political judgments: The role of stereotypic and nonstereotypic information|journal=Political Behavior|date=1 March 1992|volume=14|issue=1|pages=67–87|doi=10.1007/BF00993509}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study performed using [[logistic regression]] [[regression analysis|analysis]] on data from the 1986 through 1994 [[American National Election Studies]] found that low-information voters tend to assume female and black candidates are more liberal than male and white candidates of the same party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mcdermott|first=Monika L|title=Race and Gender Cues in Low-Information Elections|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=1 December 1998|volume=51|issue=4|pages=895–918|doi=10.1177/106591299805100403}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 study that analyzed [[Election district|precinct]]-level data from [[city council]] elections held in [[Peoria, Illinois]] between 1983 and 1999 found that the placement of candidates' names on the ballot was a point of influence for low-information voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brockington|first=David|title=A Low Information Theory of Ballot Position Effect|journal=Political Behavior|date=1 January 2003|volume=25|issue=1|pages=1–27|doi=10.1023/A:1022946710610}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis concerned with the "puzzling finding" that incumbent legislators in [[Democratic consolidation|mature democracies]] charged with [[Political corruption|corruption]] are not commonly punished in elections found that less-informed voters were significantly more likely to vote for incumbents accused of corruption than were their better-informed counterparts, presumably because they did not know about the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klasnja|first=Marko|title=Why Do Malfeasant Politicians Maintain Political Support? Testing the "Uninformed Voter" Argument|ssrn=1901683|publisher=Social Science Research Network|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
In September 2012, comedian [[Bill Maher]] made fun of [[undecided voters]] on his [[HBO]] program ''Real Time'' by calling them "low-information voters, otherwise known as dipshits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maher|first=Bill|title=Loafy's Choice|url=http://www.popmodal.com/video/15061/Bill-Maher-Rips-Undecided-Voters|publisher=Pop Modal|accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in September, the [[NBC]] program ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' ran a mock [[public service announcement]] featuring undecided low-information voters asking questions such as "When is the election?" and "Who is the president right now? Is he or she running?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krakauer|first=Steve|title=How will the debates sway the undecideds?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/03/opinion/krakauer-presidential-debate/index.html|accessdate=13 October 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grier|first=Peter|title='SNL' depicts undecided voters as dumb.

In January, 2013, Alicia Colon used the similar phrase "low-info" in her column "Low-Info Voters Just Not Interested In Politics" for the ''Irish Examiner USA'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colon|first1=Alicia|title=Low-Info Voters Just Not Interested In Politics|newspaper=Irish Examiner USA|date=8 January 2013|url=http://www.irishexaminerusa.com/mt/2013/01/08/lowinfo_voters_just_not_intere.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, [[Claire Lehmann]], editor of ''[[Quillette]]'', wrote an essay discussing why the term "low information voters" is disturbing as high information voters are essentially the ones suffering from more [[confirmation bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quillette.com/2016/11/30/stop-calling-people-low-information-voters/|title=Stop Calling People "Low Information Voters" |work=Quillette|date=30 November 2016|publisher=|first=Claire|last=Lehmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lukacs and Heidegger: Towards a New Philosophy''''' ({{lang-fr|Lukacs et Heidegger}}) is a book by [[Lucien Goldmann]] published after his death in 1973.

==Summary==
Goldmann tries to bring together the Marxist concept of [[reification (Marxism)|reification]] from [[György Lukács]] and the existential concept of [[Dasein]] from [[Martin Heidegger]]. He argues that the concept of Being in Heidgger, was already present in the concept of [[Universality (philosophy)|Totality]] in Lukács. Lukács's critique of the alienation inherent in capitalism, is thus present in Dasein as an ontological concept. Both Lukács and Heidegger critique the reification or thing-ification of the human dasein. Inauthentic dasein is parallel to the failure of the historical subject to awaken to [[praxis School|praxis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wager of Lucien Goldmann: Tragedy, Dialectics, and a Hidden God|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P9MmSNaJUWYC&amp;pg=PA319 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldmann argues that the concept of reification as employed in ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927) showed the strong influence of Lukács's work ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Heidegger and Marx: A Productive Dialogue Over the Language of Humanism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjC-hf2kFsIC&amp;pg=PA33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental goal of both Heidegger and Lukács was to overcome the traditional subject-object dichotomy of Western Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Herbert Marcuse and the Crisis of Marxism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=opx8VozA-9gC&amp;pg=PA390 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Laurence Paul Hemming, writing in ''Heidegger and Marx'' (2013), finds Goldmann's suggestion that Lukács influenced Heidegger to be highly unlikely at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hemming, Laurence Paul |title=Heidegger and Marx: A Productive Dialogue Over the Language of Humanism |publisher=Northwestern University Press |location=Evanston, Illinois |year=2013 |pages=33–34 |isbn=978-0-8101-2875-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Makwe''' (Macue) language, ''Kimakwe'', is a close relative of [[Swahili language|Swahili]] spoken on the coast of the [[Cabo Delgado Province]] of [[Mozambique]], and across the border in [[Tanzania]]. Although it shares high lexical similarity (60%) with Swahili, it is not intelligible with it, nor with its cousin [[Mwani language|Mwani]]. Arends et al. suggest it might turn out to be a [[Makonde language|Makonde]]–Swahili [[mixed language]].&lt;ref&gt;Arends, Muysken, &amp; Smith (1995), ''Pidgins and Creoles: An Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt;

A grammar of the Makwe language by Maud Devos was published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Devos, Maud (2008). ''A Grammar of Makwe''. LINCOM publishers. {{ISBN|978-3895861079}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The letter of Neacșu of Câmpulung''' ({{lang-ro|Scrisoarea lui Neacșu de la Câmpulung|links=no}}; [[Romanian Cyrillic]]: Скрісѻрѣ льи дє ла Кымпȣлȣнг),  written in 1521, is one of the oldest surviving documents available in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] that can be reliably dated. Written using [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], it was sent by Neacșu Lupu, a [[boyar]] from Dalgo Pole, [[Wallachia]] (now [[Câmpulung]], [[Romania]]) to [[Johannes Benkner]], the mayor of [[Braşov|Brassó]], [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of Hungary]] (now [[Brașov]], [[Romania]]), warning him about the imminent attack of the [[Ottoman Empire]] on [[Transylvania]].

'''Neacșu Lupu''' was a 16th-century Wallachian boyar from [[Câmpulung]], the son of [[Neacșu Mircea]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} mentioned for the first time during [[Vlad cel Tânăr]]'s reign (1510–1512), in documents related to a trial regarding debts between himself and merchants of Brașov. It is possible that he was himself a merchant involved in the trade of [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] goods that he was buying south of the [[Danube]] and selling in Transylvania, which may explain his relationship with the mayor of Brașov.&lt;ref name="Rotaru"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Rotaru, ''Literatura română veche'', Bucureşti, 1981, pp. 62-65, quoted by [http://www.cimec.ro/Istorie/neacsu/rom/oameni.htm Institutul de Memorie Culturală]; [http://www.cimec.ro/Istorie/neacsu/eng/people.htm English translation].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Brasov XVIIth 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Early engraving of [[Brașov]]]]
The Letter of Neacșu of Câmpulung to Johannes (Hans) Benkner of Brașov was most probably written on June 29 or 30, 1521, in the city of ''Dlăgopole'' (Old Bulgarian rendition/translation of Câmpulung, lit. "the long field"). The date is not mentioned within the letter itself, it being inferred from the historic events described and the people mentioned.

The letter was discovered in 1894 by [[Wilhelm Stenner]], the archivar of Brașov.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kulturportal-west-ost.eu/biographies/stenner-friedrich-wilhelm-2/ Wilhelm Stenners Biographie von Gernot Nussbächer, Historiker und Archivar in Kronstadt]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
[[File:Casa domnească la Negru Vodă 02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Boyar house in [[Câmpulung]]]]
The text of the letter was written in the Cyrillic script, and is composed of three parts. The introduction in [[Old Bulgarian language]], translated: "To the most wise and noble and venerable and by God endowed master Hanas Begner of Braşov, all the best, from Neacșu of Câmpulung".

Following the Bulgarian introduction, the content of the letter is written in the old Romanian language. As opposed to the first documents of other languages, which are in general more ancient, the Romanian language used in this letter is very similar to the language spoken in the present day. The Romanian linguist [[Aurel Nicolescu]] stated that no less than 175 words of the 190 found in the letter have [[Latin]] origins, this not counting the repeated words and the names. Some incorrect forms of different words appear due to the difficulty of representing some Romanian sounds like ''ă'' and ''î'', while using the Cyrillic alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Epistola lui Neacsu| publisher=Jurnalul Naţional | url = http://jurnalul.ro/special-jurnalul/reportaje/aniversare-epistola-lui-neacsu-lupu-17747.html|  pages = 1|  language = Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neacșu Lupu’s letter contained a secret of great importance, warning Johannes Benkner of Brașov about Turkish preparations for an invasion through [[Transylvania]] and [[Wallachia]].

Various Slavonic expressions are also present throughout the content of the letter, such as "I pak", which in [[Middle Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] means "and again" and has a similar meaning to the Latin "item", but is also used to mark the beginning of a new sentence, as no punctuation marks are present in the text. Another Bulgarian word is "za", meaning ''about''.

The letter ends with another sentence written in Bulgarian, which means: "And may God bring happiness upon you. Amen."

"To the most wise and noble and honoured and by God gifted master Hanăș Bengner [that is, Johannes Benkner] from Brașov, much health from Neacșu from Câmpulung.

And so I let you know of the deeds of the Turks, as I have heard that the emperor [that is, [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]] has left [[Sofia]], and that must be true, and went up the Danube.

And so you should know that a man from [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nicopolis]] came to me and told me they saw with their own eyes that those ships which you know about have sailed up the [[Danube]].

And so you should know that they are taking 50 men from each town to help on the ships.

And so you should know that some experts from [[Etymology of Istanbul|Tsarigrad]] [that is, Istanbul] realized how to make the ships to move past that tight place which you know too.

And so I tell you about the deed of Mahamet beg, as I heard from neighbouring [[boyars]] and from my son-in-law Negre, that the emperor gave Mahamet Beg freedom to pass through [[Wallachia]] [''Țeara Rumânească'', lit. "the Romanian land", this being also the first mention of the name "[[Name of Romania|Romania]]" in a Romanian text] wherever he pleases.

And so you should know that our [[Neagoe Basarab|Basarab]] too is fearful of that thief Mahamet beg, even more so than you.

And so I'm telling you as my superior about what I have found out. I am telling you, and you are wise and you should keep these words for yourself, so that no many people know, and you should take proper guard.

And may God bring you happiness. Amen."

'''Outing''' is the act of disclosing an [[LGBT]] person's [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]] without that person's consent. Outing gives rise to issues of privacy, choice, hypocrisy, and harm in addition to sparking debate on what constitutes [[common good]] in efforts to combat [[homophobia]] and [[heterosexism]]. A publicized outing targets prominent figures in a society, for example well-known politicians, accomplished athletes or popular artists. [[LGBT rights opposition|Opponents to LGBT rights movements]] as well as activists within [[LGBT community|LGBT communities]] have used this type of outing as a controversial political campaign or tactic. In an attempt to pre-empt being outed, an LGBT public figure may decide to [[coming out|come out]] publicly first, although controlling the conditions under which one's LGBT identity is revealed is only one of numerous motives for coming out.

==History==
It is hard to pinpoint the first use of outing in the modern sense. In a 1982 issue of ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'', [[Taylor Branch]] predicted that "outage" would become a political tactic in which the [[closeted]] would find themselves trapped in a crossfire. The article "Forcing Gays Out of the Closet" by [[William A. Henry III]] in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (January 29, 1990) introduced the term "outing" to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson &amp; Percy, p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term is recent, the practice goes back much further. Outing was a common put-down of [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Rome|Roman]] orators. Before the [[Christian]] era, [[sodomy]] was not illegal in [[Ancient Greek law|Greek]] or, most believe, in [[Roman law]], between adult citizens, but [[homosexuality|homosexual]] acts between citizens were considered acceptable only under certain social circumstances. Both Romans and Greeks sneeringly deemed vulgar the persons engaged in those acts.

The [[Harden–Eulenburg affair]] of 1907–1909 was the first public outing scandal of the twentieth century. [[Left-wing]] journalists opposed to [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]]'s policies outed a number of prominent members of his cabinet and inner circle&amp;nbsp;—and by implication the Kaiser&amp;nbsp;—beginning with [[Maximilian Harden]]'s indictment of the aristocratic diplomat [[Philipp Prince zu Eulenburg-Hertefeld|Prince Eulenburg]]. Harden's accusations incited other journalists to follow suit, including [[Adolf Brand]], founder of ''[[Der Eigene]]''.

Left-wing journalists outed [[Adolf Hitler]]'s closest ally [[Ernst Röhm]] in the early 1930s, causing Brand to write, "when someone&amp;nbsp;—as teacher, priest, representative, or statesman&amp;nbsp;—would like to set in the most damaging way the intimate love contacts of others under degrading control&amp;nbsp;—in that moment his own love-life also ceases to be a private matter and forfeits every claim to remain protected hence-forward from public scrutiny and suspicious oversight."&lt;ref&gt;Brand, Adolph. ''Political Criminals: A Word About the Röhm Case'' (1931) Reprinted in ''Homosexuality and Male Bonding in Pre-Nazi Germany'', edited by Harry Oosterhuis, 235–240. New York, Haworth, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, tabloid publications like ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]'' appeared, specializing in the revelation of scandalous information about entertainment and political celebrities. Among the political figures targeted by the magazine were former Under Secretary of State [[Sumner Welles]]&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Welles, ''Sumner Welles: FDR's Global Strategist: A Biography'' (NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997),370-1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arthur H.

Outing may be found to be [[Defamation|libel]] by a court of law. For example, in 1957 American pianist [[Liberace]], successfully sued the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' for merely insinuating that he was gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lovece|first=Frank|title=Michael Douglas plays pianist Liberace in HBO film|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/michael-douglas-plays-pianist-liberace-in-hbo-film-1.3238287|accessdate=28 August 2012|date=October 11, 2011|quote=The highly popular Liberace, who died in 1987 at the age of 67 of AIDS-related causes, publicly denied being gay or bisexual.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ukpressonline.co.uk/ukpressonline/getDocument?fileName=DMir_1956_09_26_006&amp;fileType=PDF Yearn-Strength Five]", ''Daily Mirror'', 26 September 1956, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In a 2011 interview, actress and close friend [[Betty White]] stated that Liberace was gay, and that she often served as a [[Beard (companion)|beard]] to counter rumors of the musician's homosexuality. {{Cite journal |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-wTJ2hQCK8|publisher=youtube |title=CNN Official Interview: Betty White: Bea Arthur was not fond of me}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Daily Mirror''{{'}}s defence was that the words complained of, in a column written by [[William Connor]] under his byline 'Cassandra', did not imply that Liberace was gay.

After the [[Stonewall riots]] of 1969, swells of [[Gay lib|gay-libbers]] came out aggressively in the 1970s, crying out: "Out of the closets, Into the streets!" {{Citation needed|reason=Give a specific example|date=November 2016}} Some began to demand that all homosexuals come out, and that if they weren't willing to do so, then it was the community's responsibility to do it for them{{Citation needed|reason=Name a specific person or group|date=November 2016}}.

Stipple was outed by gay activists, most prominently [[Harvey Milk]]. The negative impact the outing had on Sipple's life later provoked opposition{{Citation needed|reason=Needs specific example|date=November 2016}}. Some argued that privacy should prevail, and felt it was better for the movement to protect closeted gays, especially in [[homophobic]] religious institutions and the military{{Citation needed|reason=Name a specific person or group|date=November 2016}}. Despite their best efforts, many [[gay]]s and [[lesbian]]s were still unwilling to come out.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Some political [[conservatism|conservatives]] opposed to increased public acceptance of homosexuality engaged in outing in this period as well, with the goal of embarrassing or discrediting their ideological foes.  Conservative commentator [[Dinesh D'Souza]], for example, published the letters of gay fellow students at [[Dartmouth College]] in the campus newspaper he edited (''[[The Dartmouth Review]]'') in 1981; a few years later, succeeding ''Review'' editor [[Laura Ingraham]] had a meeting of a campus gay organization secretly tape-recorded, then published a transcript as part of an editorial denouncing the group as "cheerleaders for latent campus sodomites."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=Rory |title=Laura Ingraham: Right-Wing Radio's High Priestess of Hate |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rory-oconnor/laura-ingraham-right-wing_b_106034.html |website=Huffington Post |accessdate=11 June 2018 |date=10 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the [[AIDS]] pandemic led to the outing of several major entertainers, including [[Rock Hudson]].

One of the first outings by an activist in the United States occurred in February 1989. [[Michael Petrelis]], along with a few others, alleged that [[Mark Hatfield]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[Oregon]] was gay. They did this because he supported legislation initiated by [[Jesse Helms]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Which legislation?|date=November 2016}}At a fundraiser in a small town outside of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], the group stood up and outed him in front of the crowd. Petrelis later tried to make news by standing on the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]] steps and reading the names of "twelve men and women in politics and music who ... are secretly gay." Though the press showed up, no major news organization published the story. (Gross, p.&amp;nbsp;85) Potential libel suits deterred publishers.

''OutWeek'', which had begun publishing in 1989, was home to activist and outing pioneer [[Michelangelo Signorile]], who stirred the waters when he outed the recently deceased [[Malcolm Forbes]] in March 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last = Signorile  | first = Michelangelo   | title = The Other Side of Malcolm Forbes  | journal = Outweek   | issue = 38  | pages = 40–45   | date = March 18, 1990  | url = http://outweek.net/pdfs/ow_38.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His column "Gossip Watch" became a hot spot for outing the rich and famous. Both praised and lambasted for his behavior, he garnered responses to his actions as wide-ranging as "one of the greater contemporary gay heroes," to "revolting, infantile, cheap name-calling."&lt;ref&gt;Johansson &amp; Percy, p.&amp;nbsp;183&lt;/ref&gt;

Other people who have been outed include [[Fannie Flagg]], [[Pete Williams (journalist)|Pete Williams]], [[Chaz Bono]], and [[Richard Chamberlain (actor)|Richard Chamberlain]].

In 2004, [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]] activist [[Michael Rogers (blogger)|Michael Rogers]] outed [[Edward Schrock]], a Republican [[United States Congress|Congressman]] from [[Virginia]]. Rogers posted a story on his website alleging that Schrock used an interactive [[phone sex]] service to meet other men for sex. Schrock did not deny this, and announced on August 30, 2004, that he would not seek re-election.{{Citation needed|reason=|date=November 2016}} Rogers said that he outed Schrock to punish him for his hypocrisy in voting for the [[Marriage Protection Act]] and signing on as a co-sponsor of the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]].

[[New Jersey]] Governor [[Jim McGreevey]] announced that he was a "gay American" in August 2004.  McGreevey had become aware that he was about to be named in a [[sexual harassment]] suit by [[Golan Cipel]], his former security advisor, with whom it was alleged McGreevey had a sexual relationship. McGreevey resigned, but unlike Schrock, McGreevey decided not to step out of public life.  [[John McCain]]'s Presidential Campaign removed images of Alabama Attorney General [[Troy King]] from its website after he was outed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pensitoreview.com/2008/07/11/homohating-alabama-attorney-general-and-chair-of-mccain-campaign-outed-as-gay/ McCain's Alabama Chairman Reportedly Outed – Attorney General Troy King Has a Record of Homophobic Rhetoric] by Jon Ponder, July 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Often outing is used solely to damage the outed person's reputation, and has thus been controversial.{{Original research inline|date=December 2007}} Some activists, such as United States Congressman [[Barney Frank]] argue that outing is appropriate and legitimate in some cases&amp;nbsp;— for example, if the individual is actively working against [[LGBT rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Doug Ireland |url=http://www.laweekly.com/ink/04/44/news-ireland.php |title=THE OUTING &amp;#124; David Dreier and his straight hypocrisy |publisher=Laweekly.com |date=2004-09-23 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank clarified, during the 2006 [[Mark Foley scandal]], "I think there's a right to privacy.

=== ''Outrage'' film ===
{{Main|Outrage (2009 film)}}
In 2009, [[Kirby Dick]]'s documentary ''Outrage'' argued that several American political figures have led closeted gay lives while supporting and endorsing legislation that is harmful to the [[gay community]].&lt;ref name=Filmmaker&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/1367-kirby-dick-outrage/ |title=Kirby Dick, ''Outrage'' |date=May 8, 2009 |last=Dawson |first=Nick |journal=Filmmaker |accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/movies/08outr.html?_r=0 |title=Secret Lives in the Age of Gay Rights |last=Scott |first=A.

The film focused particular attention on [[Idaho]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Larry Craig]], an outspoken opponent of [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]] who in 2007 pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for soliciting sex from an undercover police officer in a public bathroom.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  ''Outrage'' featured interviews with several people who claim that [[Governor of Florida]] [[Charlie Crist]] has led a private gay life while publicly opposing [[gay marriage]] and [[gay adoption]].&lt;ref name=SFGate&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Outrage-takes-on-closeted-gay-politicians-3162299.php |title='Outrage' takes on closeted gay politicians |last=Guthmann |first=Edward |date=May 10, 2009 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=SFGate.com |accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PittsburghPostGazette&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/movie-reviews/outrage-documentary-opens-the-closet-door-on-gay-politicians-346252/ |title='Outrage': Documentary opens the closet door on gay politicians |last=Paris |first=Barry |date=June 18, 2009 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other politicians discussed in the film include former [[Virginia]] [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Ed Schrock]], [[California]] [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[David Dreier]], former [[New York City]] [[Mayor of New York City|mayor]] [[Ed Koch]], and former [[Louisiana]] [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Jim McCrery]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=DallasObserver/&gt;&lt;ref name=Variety/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFGate/&gt;&lt;ref name=PittsburghPostGazette/&gt;&lt;ref name=LA&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/the_big_picture/2009/04/outraged-kirby-dick-kicks-open-washingtons-closet-door-.html 'Outrage': Kirby Dick kicks open Washington's closet door], [[Patrick Goldstein]], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', April 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film argues that the [[mass media]] is reluctant to discuss issues involving gay politicians despite the many comparable news stories about heterosexual politicians and scandals.  ''Outrage'' describes this behavior as a form of institutionalized homophobia that has resulted in a tacit policy of self-censorship when reporting on these issues.&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2009/05/07/kirby_dick/ |title=Behind Washington’s closet door |last=O'Hehir |first=Andrew |date=May 7, 2009 |work=Salon |publisher=Salon Media Group |accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Advocate&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/film/2009/04/27/kirby-dick-outraged |title=Kirby Dick Is Outraged! |last=Milvy |first=Erika |date=April 27, 2009 |work=Advocate |publisher=Here Media |accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motives==
Gabriel Rotello, once editor of ''OutWeek'', called outing "equalizing", explaining, "what we have called 'outing' is a primarily journalistic movement to treat homosexuality as equal to heterosexuality in the media...In 1990, many of us in the gay media announced that henceforth we would simply treat homosexuality and heterosexuality as equals. We were not going to wait for the perfect, utopian future to arrive before equalizing the two: We were going to do it now. That's what outing really is: equalizing [[homosexuality]] and [[heterosexuality]] in the media." ("Why I Oppose Outing", ''OutWeek'', May 29, 1991)

Their aim is not only to reveal the hypocrisy of those in what Branch termed the "closets of power" but also a gay person awareness of the presence of gay people and political issues, thus showing that being [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] is not "so utterly grotesque that it should never be discussed." (Signorile, p.&amp;nbsp;78) Richard Mohr noted, "some people have compared outing to [[McCarthyism]]...And vindictive outing is like McCarthyism: such outing feeds gays to the wolves, who thereby are made stronger....But the sort of outing I have advocated does not invoke, mobilize, or ritualistically confirm anti-gay values; rather it cuts against them, works to undo them. The point of outing, as I have defended it, is not to wreak vengeance, not to punish, and not to deflect attention from one's own debased state. Its point is to avoid degrading oneself." Thus outing is "both permissible and an expected consequence of living [[morally]]."&lt;ref&gt;Mohr, Richard. ''Gay Ideas: Outing and Other Controversies'', Boston: Beacon Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, outing is not the airing of private details. As Signorile asked, "How can being gay be private when being straight isn't? [[Sex]] is private. But by outing we do not discuss anyone's sex life. We only say they're gay."&lt;ref name="Signorile, p. 80"&gt;Signorile, p.&amp;nbsp;80&lt;/ref&gt; "Average people have been outed for decades. People have always outed the [[Mail carrier|mailman]] and the [[milkman]] and the [[spinster]] who lives down the block. If anything, the goal behind outing is to show just how many gay people there are among the most visible people in our society so that when someone outs the milkman or the spinster, everyone will say, 'So what?'"&lt;ref&gt;Signorile, p.&amp;nbsp;82&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no widely agreed definition of '''fair outing''' nor even clear consensus in most organizations on when it can occur.  Virtually all who take a position on outing have qualified the limits to which it is permissible for one to go - often quite idiosyncratic.  The extremes are to out no one or to out everyone. In between, four intermediate positions have been discerned to justify so-called '''fair outing''':&lt;ref&gt;Johansson &amp; Percy, p.&amp;nbsp;228&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# [[Hypocrite]]s only, and only when they actively oppose gay rights and interests;
# Outing passive accomplices who help run homophobic institutions;
# Prominent individuals whose outing would shatter [[stereotype]]s and compel the public to reconsider its attitude on homosexuality;
# Only the dead.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Assessing to which degree the outer goes allows insight into the goal striven towards. Most outers target those who support decisions and further policy, both [[religious]] and [[secular]], which discriminate against gay people while they themselves live a [[wiktionary:clandestine|clandestine]] gay existence. A "truism to people active in the gay movement [is] that the greatest impediments to homosexuals' progress often [are] not heterosexuals, but closeted homosexuals," said [[San Francisco]] journalist [[Randy Shilts]].&lt;ref&gt;Johansson &amp; Percy, p.&amp;nbsp;226&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and effectiveness==
The effectiveness of outing as a political tactic depends on the willingness of the media to report that a person has been outed. The advent of the internet has made outing public figures much easier. Twenty years ago Michael Rogers would have had to persuade a newspaper or other media outlet to risk legal action by reporting his allegations about Congressman Ed Schrock. Today he can publish them himself on his website and other media will then report that he has done so.

Signorile argues that the outing of journalist [[Pete Williams (journalist)|Pete Williams]] "and its aftermath did indeed make a big dent in the military's policy against gays. The publicity generated put the policy on the front burner in 1992, thrusting the issue into the presidential campaign," with every Democratic candidate and independent Ross Perot publicly promising to end the ban. (ibid, p.&amp;nbsp;161).

==Outing in the military==
{{Main|Sexual orientation and military service}}
{{See also|Don't ask, don't tell}}
The [[military|military forces]] of the world have differing approaches to the enlistment of [[heterosexual]], [[asexuality|asexual]],{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} and [[bisexual]] individuals. Some have open policies, others prohibit, and some are ambiguous.  The armed forces of most developed countries have now removed policies excluding [[non-heterosexual]] individuals (with strict policies on [[sexual harassment]]).

Nations that permit gay people to serve openly in the military include the 4 of the 5 members of the UN Security Council (United States, United Kingdom, France, and Russia), the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), [[Australia]], [[Israel]], [[Argentina]], and all [[NATO]] members except [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter. [http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2010/0607_dont_ask_dont_tell_singer.aspx "What Our Military Allies Can Tell Us About The End of Don't Ask, Don't Tell"], [http://www.brookings.edu/ The Brookings Institution], 7 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom the Ministry of Defence policy since the year 2000 is to allow homosexual men, lesbians and [[transgender]] personnel to serve openly, and discrimination on a sexual orientation basis is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=10083 |title=Queer:Argentinien und die Philippinen beenden Homo-Verbot im Militär (German) |publisher=Queer.de |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also forbidden for someone to pressure LGBT people to [[Coming out|come out]].

In the United States LGBT people are allowed to serve openly in the [[United States]] military.{{cn|date=August 2017}} Military policy and legislation had previously entirely prohibited gay individuals from serving, and subsequently from serving openly, but these prohibitions were ended in September 2011 after the United States Congress voted to repeal the policy. The first time homosexuals were differentiated from non-homosexuals in the military literature was in revised army mobilization regulations in 1942. Additional policy revisions in 1944 and 1947 further codified the ban. Throughout the next few decades, homosexuals were routinely discharged, regardless of whether they had engaged in sexual conduct while serving. In response to the [[LGBT movements in the United States|gay rights movements]] of the 1970s and 1980s, the Department of Defense issued a 1982 policy (DOD Directive 1332.14) stating that homosexuality was clearly incompatible with military service. Controversy over this policy created political pressure to amend the policy, with [[liberalism in the United States|socially liberal]] efforts seeking a repeal of the ban and [[conservatism in the United States|socially conservative]] groups wishing to reinforce it by statute.

==Support for outing==
Some gay rights activists defend outing as a tactic. The [[United Kingdom|British]] activist [[Peter Tatchell]] says "The lesbian and gay community has a right to defend itself against public figures who abuse their power and influence to support policies which inflict suffering on homosexuals." In 1994 Tatchell's activist group [[OutRage!]] alleged that fourteen bishops of the [[Church of England]] were homosexual or bisexual and named them, accusing them of hypocrisy for upholding the Church's policy of regarding homosexual acts as [[sinful]] while not observing this prohibition in their personal lives.
"Outing is [[queer]] self-defence," Tatchell says. "Lesbians and gay men have a right, and a duty, to expose hypocrites and homophobes. By not outing gay Bishops who support policies which harm homosexuals, we would be protecting those Bishops and thereby allowing them to continue to inflict suffering on members of our community. Collusion with hypocrisy and homophobia is not ethically defensible for Christians, or for anyone else."{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Criticism==
Some gay activists, however, continue to disapprove of outing as a political tactic, arguing that even anti-gay conservatives have a right to personal privacy which should be respected. Steven Fisher, a spokesperson for the [[Human Rights Campaign]], the largest advocacy group for gay and lesbian issues in the United States, commenting on the Schrock outing, said he opposed using "sexual orientation as a weapon." [[Christopher R. Barron]], political director of the [[Log Cabin Republicans]], a group representing gay and lesbian Republicans said: "We disagree strongly with the outing campaign, but we also strongly disagree with President Bush's sponsorship of the anti-family [[Federal Marriage Amendment]]."

Roger Rosenblatt argued in his January 1993 ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' essay "Who Killed Privacy?" that, "The practice of 'outing' homosexuals implies contradictorily that homosexuals have a right to private choice but not to private lives."&lt;ref name="Signorile, p. 80"/&gt; In March 2002, singer [[Will Young]] revealed he was gay, pre-empting a tabloid newspaper (reportedly ''[[News of the World]]'') that was preparing to out him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boggan|first1=Steve|title=A pop idol, a rumour and why he felt he had to come out|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/a-pop-idol-a-rumour-and-why-he-felt-he-had-to-come-out-9210510.html|accessdate=18 March 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticism concerning outing centers upon the harm that outing individuals as homosexual, transgender, or transsexual does to them personally and professionally and upon the fact that some individuals have been erroneously outed or have been outed when there is no proof to substantiate the claim that they are gay or transgender.

[[Christine Jorgensen]], [[Beth Elliott]], [[Renée Richards]], [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Sandy Stone]], [[Billy Tipton]], [[Alan L. Hart]], [[April Ashley]], [[Caroline Cossey]] ("Tula"), [[Jahna Steele]], and [[Nancy Jean Burkholder]] were outed as transsexuals by European or American media or, in the case of Billy Tipton, by his [[coroner]]. In many cases, being outed had an adverse effect on their personal lives and their careers.

In some cases well-known celebrities have been outed as [[transgender]] or [[intersexuality|intersex]] when no proof to substantiate the claims was presented, e.g., [[Jamie Lee Curtis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/jamie.htm |title=Jamie Lee Curtis rumor |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions in entertainment==
Outing has been featured in comedy films as well, such as the French comedy ''[[Le Placard]]'' (''The Closet''), where a heterosexual man is falsely outed, or in the 1997 comedy ''[[In &amp; Out (film)|In &amp; Out]]'' where [[Kevin Kline]] stars as a small-town teacher who gets outed on national television, and is then forced to come to terms with his own unrecognized homosexuality.

In Season 5 the television series ''[[The L Word]]'', the issue of public outing is addressed in the form of [[Alice Pieszecki]], a web-journalist, outing a basketball player who made offensive comments toward gay people while himself being gay. She also ambiguously outs lesbian [[actress]] [[Niki Stevens]] while guest-hosting a fictional talk show called ''The Look''.

A '''proverb''' (from {{lang-la|proverbium}}) is a simple, concrete, traditional [[saying]] that expresses a truth based on common sense or experience. Proverbs are often [[metaphor]]ical and use [[formulaic speech|formulaic language]]. Collectively, they form a [[folklore genre|genre of folklore]].

Some proverbs exist in more than one language because people borrow them from languages and cultures similar to theirs. In the West, the Bible (including, but not limited to the [[Book of Proverbs]]) and medieval Latin (aided by the work of [[Erasmus]]) have played a considerable role in distributing proverbs. Not all Biblical proverbs, however, were distributed to the same extent:  one scholar has gathered evidence to show that cultures in which the Bible is the "major spiritual book contain between three hundred and five hundred proverbs that stem from the Bible,"&lt;ref&gt;p. 12, Wolfgang Mieder. 1990. ''Not by bread alone: Proverbs of the Bible''.  New England Press.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas another shows that, of the 106 most common and widespread proverbs across Europe, eleven are from the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Paczolay, Gyula. 1997. ''European Proverbs in 55 Languages''. Veszpre'm, Hungary.&lt;/ref&gt; However, almost every culture has its own unique proverbs.

== Definitions ==
What is a proverb?  [[Lord John Russell]] (c. 1850) observed poetically that a "proverb is the wit of one, and the wisdom of many."&lt;ref&gt;p. 25. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. "The wit of one, and the wisdom of many: General thoughts on the nature of the proverb. ''Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age'' 3-40. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; But giving the word "proverb" the sort of definition theorists need has proven to be a difficult task, and although scholars often quote [[Archer Taylor]]'s argument that formulating a scientific "definition of a proverb is too difficult to repay the undertaking... An incommunicable quality tells us this sentence is proverbial and that one is not. Hence no definition will enable us to identify positively a sentence as proverbial,"&lt;ref&gt;p. 3 Archer Taylor. 1931. ''The Proverb''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; many students of proverbs have attempted to itemize its essential characteristics. 

More constructively, Mieder has proposed the following definition, "A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed, and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation".&lt;ref&gt;p. 5. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. "The wit of one, and the wisdom of many: General thoughts on the nature of the proverb. Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age 3-40. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Norrick created a table of [[distinctive feature]]s to distinguish proverbs from idioms, cliches, etc.&lt;ref&gt;p. 73. Neil Norrick. 1985. ''How Proverbs Mean: Semantic Studies in English Proverbs''. Amsterdam: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; Prahlad distinguishes proverbs from some other, closely related types of sayings, "True proverbs must further be distinguished from other types of proverbial speech, e.g. proverbial phrases, [[Wellerism]]s, maxims, quotations, and proverbial comparisons."&lt;ref&gt;p. 33. Sw. Anand Prahlad. 1996. ''African-American Proverbs in Context''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Persian proverbs, Zolfaghari and Ameri propose the following definition: "A proverb is a short sentence, which is well-known and at times rhythmic, including advice, sage themes and ethnic experiences, comprising simile, metaphor or irony which is well-known among people for its fluent wording, clarity of expression, simplicity, expansiveness and generality and is used either with or without change".&lt;ref&gt;p. 107, Hassan Zolfaghari &amp; Hayat Ameri. "Persian Proverbs: Definitions and Characteristics". ''Journal of Islamic and Human Advanced Research'' 2(2012) 93-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many sayings in English that are commonly referred to as "proverbs", such as weather sayings. [[Alan Dundes]], however, rejects including such sayings among truly proverbs: "Are weather proverbs proverbs? I would say emphatically 'No!'"&lt;ref&gt;p. 45. Alan Dundes. 1984. On whether weather 'proverbs' are proverbs. ''Proverbium'' 1:39-46. Also, 1989, in ''Folklore Matters'' edited by Alan Dundes, 92-97. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of "proverb" has also changed over the years.  For example, the following was labeled "A Yorkshire proverb" in 1883, but would not be categorized as a proverb by most today, "as throng as Throp's wife when she hanged herself with a dish-cloth".&lt;ref&gt;A Yorkshire proverb. 1883. ''The Academy''. July 14, no. 584. p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; The changing of the definition of "proverb" is also noted in Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;Ezgi Ulusoy Aranyosi. 2010. "Atasözü neydi, ne oldu?" ["What was, and what now is, a 'proverb'?"]. ''Millî Folklor: International and Quarterly Journal of Cultural Studies'' 11.88: 5-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other languages and cultures, the definition of "proverb" also differs from English. In the [[Chumburung language]] of Ghana, "''aŋase'' are literal proverbs and ''akpare'' are metaphoric ones".&lt;ref&gt;p. 64. Gillian Hansford. 2003. Understanding Chumburung proverbs. ''Journal of West African Languages'' 30.1:57-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Bini of Nigeria, there are three words that are used to translate "proverb": ''ere, ivbe'', and ''itan''. The first relates to historical events, the second relates to current events, and the third was "linguistic ornamentation in formal discourse".&lt;ref&gt;p. 4,5. Daniel Ben-Amos. Introduction: Folklore in African Society. ''Forms of Folklore in Africa'', edited by Bernth Lindfors, pp. 1-36. Austin: University of Texas.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Balochi language|Balochi]] of Pakistan and Afghanistan, there is a word ''batal'' for ordinary proverbs and ''bassīttuks'' for "proverbs with background stories".&lt;ref&gt;p. 43. Sabir Badalkhan. 2000. "Ropes break at the weakest point": Some examples of Balochi proverbs with background stories. ''Proverbium'' 17:43-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also language communities that combine proverbs and riddles in some sayings, leading some scholars to create the label "proverb riddles".&lt;ref&gt;John C. Messenger, Jr. Anang Proverb-Riddles. The Journal of American Folklore Vol. 73, No. 289 (July - September 1960), pp. 225-235.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 418. Finnegan, Ruth. ''Oral Literature in Africa''. The Saylor Foundation, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Umoh, S. J. 2007. The Ibibio Proverb—Riddles and Language Pedagogy. ''International Journal of Linguistics and Communication'' 11(2), 8-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proverbs come from a variety of sources. Some are, indeed, the result of people pondering and crafting language, such as some by [[Confucius]], [[Plato]], [[Baltasar Gracián]], etc. Others are taken from such diverse sources as poetry,&lt;ref&gt;Korosh Hadissi. 2010. A Socio-Historical Approach to Poetic Origins of Persian Proverbs. ''Iranian Studies'' 43.5: 599-605.&lt;/ref&gt; stories,&lt;ref&gt;Thamen, Hla. 2000. ''Myanmar Proverbs in Myanmar and English''. Yangon: Pattamya Ngamank Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; songs, commercials, advertisements, movies, literature, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Charles Clay, Wolfgang Mieder, [[Fred R. Shapiro]]. 2012. ''The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs.'' New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the well known sayings of Jesus, Shakespeare, and others have become proverbs, though they were original at the time of their creation, and many of these sayings were not seen as proverbs when they were first coined. Many proverbs are also based on stories, often the end of a story.  For example, the proverb "[[Belling the cat|Who will bell the cat]]?" is from the end of a story about the mice planning how to be safe from the cat.&lt;ref&gt;p. 68. Kent, Graeme. 1991. ''Aesop's Fables.'' Newmarket, UK: Brimax.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have created proverbs in their writings, such a [[J.R.R. Tolkien]],&lt;ref name="Michael Stanton 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trokhimenko, Olga 2003"/&gt; and some of these proverbs have made their way into broader society, such as the bumper sticker pictured below. Similarly, C.S. Lewis' created proverb about a lobster in a pot, from the ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'', has also gained currency.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Unseth. 2014. A created proverb in a novel becomes broadly used in society: "‛Easily in but not easily out', as the lobster said in his lobster pot." ''Crossroads: A Journal of English Studies'' [http://www.crossroads.uwb.edu.pl/category/issue-22014/page/2/ online access] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526192406/http://www.crossroads.uwb.edu.pl/category/issue-22014/page/2/ |date=2015-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases like this, deliberately created proverbs for fictional societies have become proverbs in real societies. In a fictional story set in a real society, the movie ''Forrest Gump'' introduced "Life is like a box of chocolates" into broad society.&lt;ref&gt;p. 70, Winick, Stephen. 1998. ''The Proverb Process: Intertextuality and Proverbial Innovation in Popular Culture.'' University of Pennsylvania: PhD dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt; In at least one case, at appears that a proverb deliberately created by one writer has been naively picked up and used by another who assumed it to be an established Chinese proverb, [[Ford Madox Ford]] having picked up a proverb from [[Ernest Bramah]], "It would be hypocrisy to seek for the person of the Sacred Emperor in a Low Tea House."&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorn, Jeremy, ‘Ernest Bramah: Source of Ford Madox Ford’s Chinese Proverb?’ Notes and Queries, 63.2 (2016), 286-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proverb with "a longer history than any other recorded proverb in the world", going back to "around 1800 BC"&lt;ref&gt;p. 5. Alster, Bendt. 1979. An Akkadian and a Greek proverb. A comparative study. ''Die Welt des Orients'' 10. 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; is in a Sumerian clay tablet, "The bitch by her acting too hastily brought forth the blind".&lt;ref&gt;p. 17. Moran, William L. 1978a. An Assyriological gloss on the new Archilochus fragment. ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 82. 17-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Though many proverbs are ancient, they were all newly created at some point by somebody.  Sometimes it is easy to detect that a proverb is newly coined by a reference to something recent, such as the Haitian proverb "The fish that is being microwaved doesn't fear the lightning".&lt;ref&gt;p. 325, Linda Tavernier-Almada. 1999. Prejudice, power, and poverty in Haiti: A study of a nation's culture as seen through its proverbs. ''Proverbium'' 16:325-350.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there is a recent [[Maltese language|Maltese]] proverb, ''wil-muturi, ferh u duluri'' "Women and motorcycles are joys and griefs"; the proverb is clearly new, but still formed as a traditional style couplet with rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;p. 125. Aquilina, Joseph. 1972. ''A Comparative Dictionary of Maltese Proverbs.'' Malta: Royal University of Malta.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is a proverb in the [[Kafa language]] of Ethiopia that refers to the forced military conscription of the 1980s, "...the one who hid himself lived to have children."&lt;ref&gt;Mesfin Wodajo. 2012. ''Functions and Formal and Stylistic Features of Kafa Proverbs''. LAP Lambert Academic Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; A Mongolian proverb also shows evidence of recent origin, "A beggar who sits on gold; Foam rubber piled on edge."&lt;ref&gt;p. 22, Janice Raymond. ''Mongolian Proverbs: A window into their world.'' San Diego: Alethinos Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  A political candidate in Kenya popularised a new proverb in his 1995 campaign, ''Chuth ber'' "Immediacy is best". "The proverb has since been used in other contexts to prompt quick action."&lt;ref&gt;p. 68. Okumba Miruka. 2001. ''Oral Literature of the Luo''. Nairobi: East African Educational Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1,400 new English proverbs are said to have been coined and gained currency in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Clay Doyle, Wolfgang Mieder, Fred R. Shapiro. 2012. ''The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs.''  Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This process of creating proverbs is always ongoing, so that possible new proverbs are being created constantly. Those sayings that are adopted and used by an adequate number of people become proverbs in that society.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. ''Proverbs are never out of season.''

== Interpretations ==
Interpreting proverbs is often complex, but is best done in a context.&lt;ref&gt;Jesenšek, Vida. 2014. Pragmatic and stylistic aspects of proverbs. ''Introduction to Paremiology: A Comprehensive Guide to Proverb Studies'', ed. by Hrisztalina Hrisztova-Gotthardt and Melita Aleksa Varga, pp. 133-161. Warsaw &amp; Berlin: DeGruyter Open.&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting proverbs from other cultures is much more difficult than interpreting proverbs in one's own culture. Even within English-speaking cultures, there is difference of opinion on how to interpret the proverb "[[A rolling stone gathers no moss]]." Some see it as condemning a person that keeps moving, seeing moss as a positive thing, such as profit; others see the proverb as praising people that keep moving and developing, seeing moss as a negative thing, such as negative habits.&lt;ref&gt;p. 224,225. Flavell, Linda and roger Flavell. 1993. ''The Dictionary of Proverbs and Their Origins''. London: Kyle Cathie.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, among [[Tajik language|Tajik]] speakers, the proverb "One hand cannot clap" has two significantly different interpretations. Most see the proverb as promoting teamwork. Others understand it to mean that an argument requires two people.&lt;ref&gt;p. 158. Evan Bell. 2009. ''An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Masters thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; In an extreme example, one researcher working in Ghana found that for a single Akan proverb, twelve different interpretations were given.&lt;ref&gt;Sjaak van der Geest. 1996. The Elder and His Elbow: Twelve Interpretations of an Akan Proverb. ''Research in African Literatures'' Vol. 27, No. 3: 110-118.&lt;/ref&gt; Children will sometimes interpret proverbs in a literal sense, not yet knowing how to understand the conventionalized metaphor. Interpretation of proverbs is also affected by injuries and diseases of the brain, "A hallmark of schizophrenia is impaired proverb interpretation."&lt;ref name="Michael Kiang 2007"&gt;Michael Kiang, et al, Cognitive, neurophysiological, and functional correlates of proverb interpretation abnormalities in schizophrenia. ''Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society'' (2007), 13, 653–663.[Futuristic paremiography and paremiology: a plea for the collection and study of modern proverbs. Online access]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
===Grammatical structures===
Proverbs in various languages are found with a wide variety of grammatical structures.&lt;ref&gt;See Mac Coinnigh, Marcas. Syntactic Structures in Irish-Language Proverbs. ''Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship'' 29, 95-136.&lt;/ref&gt; In English, for example, we find the following structures (in addition to others):
* Imperative, negative - Don't beat a dead horse.
* Imperative, positive - Look before you leap.
* Parallel phrases - Garbage in, garbage out.
* Rhetorical question - Is the Pope Catholic?
* Declarative sentence - Birds of a feather flock together.

However, people will often quote only a fraction of a proverb to invoke an entire proverb, e.g. "All is fair" instead of "All is fair in love and war", and "A rolling stone" for "A rolling stone gathers no moss."

The grammar of proverbs is not always the typical grammar of the spoken language, often elements are moved around, to achieve rhyme or focus.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian J. Floor. 2005. Poetic Fronting in a Wisdom Poetry Text: The Information Structure of Proverbs 7. ''Journal of Northwest Semitic Languages'' 31: 23-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of grammatical structure in proverbs is a short dialogue:
* Shor/Khkas (SW Siberia): "They asked the camel, 'Why is your neck crooked?' The camel laughed roaringly, 'What of me is straight?'"&lt;ref&gt;p. 176. Roos, Marti, Hans Nugteren, Zinaida Waibel. 2006. Khakas and Shor proverbs and proverbial sayings. In ''Exploring the Eastern Frontiers of Turkic'', ed by Marcel Erdal and Irina Nevskaya, pp. 157-192. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Armenian language|Armenian]]: "They asked the wine, 'Have you built or destroyed more?' It said, 'I do not know of building; of destroying I know a lot.'"&lt;ref&gt;p. 135. Sakayan, Dora. 1999. Reported and direct speech in proverbs: On Armenian dialogue proverbs. Proverbium 16: 303-324.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bakgatla [a.k.a. [[Tswana language|Tswana]]:  "The thukhui jackal said, 'I can run fast.' But the sands said, 'We are wide.'" ([[Botswana]])&lt;ref&gt;p. 246. Mitchison, Naomi and Amos Kgamanyane Pilane. 1967. The Bakgatla of South-East Botswana As Seen through Their Proverbs. ''Folklore'' Vol. 78, No. 4: 241-268.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bambara language|Bamana]]: "'Speech, what made you good?' 'The way I am,' said Speech. 'What made you bad?' 'The way I am,' said Speech." (Mali)&lt;ref&gt;p. 221. Kone, Kasim. 1997.'' Bamana verbal art: An ethnographic study of proverbs''. PhD dissertation, Indiana University.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ochsenfurt Hauptstraße 60 Schuster.jpg|thumb|"The cobbler should stick to his last" in German. It is also an old proverb in English, but now [[last]] is no longer known to many.]]
===Conservative language===
[[File:Latijnse tekst boven portaal.JPG|left|thumb|Latin proverb overdoorway in Netherlands: "No one attacks me with impunity"]]
Because many proverbs are both poetic and traditional, they are often passed down in fixed forms. Though spoken language may change, many proverbs are often preserved in conservative, even [[Archaism|archaic]], form. In English, for example, "betwixt" is not used by many, but a form of it is still heard (or read) in the proverb "There is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip." The conservative form preserves the meter and the rhyme. This conservative nature of proverbs can result in archaic words and grammatical structures being preserved in individual proverbs, as has been documented in Amharic,&lt;ref&gt;p. 691. Michael Ahland. 2009. From topic to subject: Grammatical change in the Amharic possessive construction. ''Studies in Language'' 33.3 pp. 685-717.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek,&lt;ref&gt;p. 72. Nikolaos Lazaridis. 2007. ''Wisdom in Loose Form: The Language of Egyptian and Greek Proverbs in Collections of the Hellenistic and Roman Periods.'' Brill&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nsenga language|Nsenga]],&lt;ref&gt;p. 64. Christopher J. Pluger. 2014. ''Translating New Testament proverb-like sayings in the style of Nsenga proverbs.'' Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics MA thesis.&lt;/ref&gt; and Polish.&lt;ref&gt;Szpila, Grzegorz. 2001. Archaic lexis in Polish Proverbs. In Władysław Witalisz (ed.), ''"And gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche": Studies on Language and Literature in Honour of Professor Dr. Karl Heinz Göller'', pp. 187-193. Kraków 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, proverbs may still be used in languages which were once more widely known in a society, but are now no longer so widely known. For example, English speakers use some non-English proverbs that are drawn from languages that used to be widely understood by the educated class, e.g. "C'est la vie" from French and "[[Carpe diem]]" from Latin. 

Proverbs are often handed down through generations. Therefore, "many proverbs refer to old measurements, obscure professions, outdated weapons, unknown plants, animals, names, and various other traditional matters."&lt;ref&gt;p. 33. Wolfgang Mieder. 2014. ''Behold the Proverbs of a People: Proverbial Wisdom in Culture, Literature, and Politics.'' Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi.&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, it is common that they preserve words that become less common and archaic in broader society.&lt;ref&gt;Issa O. Sanusi and R.K. Omoloso. The role of Yoruba proverbs in preserving archaic lexical items and expressions in Yoruba.

Shepard (2016) “Sufferance fait ease en temps”: word as image at St Michael-le-Belfrey, York. ''Word &amp; Image'' 32:2, 218-234. DOI: 10.1080/02666286.2016.1167577.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Borrowing and spread===
[[File:The-Blind-Leading-the-Blind-xx-Sebastian-Vrancx.JPG|thumb|"[[The blind leading the blind]]", a saying that has spread across Europe, found in the ''Upanishads'' and the ''Bible'']]
Proverbs are often and easily translated and transferred from one language into another. "There is nothing so uncertain as the derivation of proverbs, the same proverb being often found in all nations, and it is impossible to assign its paternity."&lt;ref&gt;p. ii. Thomas Fielding. 1825. Select proverbs of all nations. New York: Covert.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proverbs are often borrowed across lines of language, religion, and even time.  For example, a proverb of the approximate form "No flies enter a mouth that is shut" is currently found in Spain, France, Ethiopia, and many countries in between.  It is embraced as a true local proverb in many places and should not be excluded in any collection of proverbs because it is shared by the neighbors.  However, though it has gone through multiple languages and millennia, the proverb can be traced back to an ancient Babylonian proverb (Pritchard 1958:146). Another example of a widely spread proverb is "A drowning person clutches at [frogs] foam", found in Peshai of Afghanistan&lt;ref&gt;p. 67. Ju-Hong Yun and Pashai Language Committee. 2010. On a mountain there is still a road. Peshawar, Pakistan: InterLit Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; and Orma of Kenya,&lt;ref&gt;p. 24. Calvin C. Katabarwa and Angelique Chelo. 2012. Wisdom from Orma, Kenya proverbs and wise sayings. Nairobi: African Proverbs Working Group. http://www.afriprov.org/images/afriprov/books/wisdomofOrmaproverbs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably places in between.

Proverbs about one hand clapping are common across Asia,&lt;ref&gt;Kamil V. Zvelebil. 1987. The Sound of the One Hand.  Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 107, No. 1, pp. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt; from Dari in Afghanistan&lt;ref&gt;p. 16, Edward Zellem. 2012. Zarbul Masalha: 151 Aghan Dari proverbs.&lt;/ref&gt; to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;p. 164. Philip B. Yampolsky, (trans.). 1977.  The Zen Master Hakuin: Selected Writings. New York, Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have been done devoted to the spread of proverbs in certain regions, such as India and her neighbors&lt;ref&gt;Ludwik Sternbach. 1981. Indian Wisdom and Its Spread beyond India. Journal of the American Oriental Society Vol. 101, No. 1,  pp. 97-131.&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Kuusi; Marje Joalaid; Elsa Kokare; Arvo Krikmann; Kari Laukkanen; Pentti Leino; Vaina Mālk; Ingrid Sarv. Proverbia Septentrionalia. ''900 Balto-Finnic Proverb Types with Russian, Baltic, German and Scandinavian Parallels''. Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; An extreme example of the borrowing and spread of proverbs was the work done to create a corpus of proverbs for [[Esperanto]], where all the proverbs were translated from other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Fiedler, Sabine. 1999. Phraseology in planned languages. ''Language problems and language planning'' 23.2: 175-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often not possible to trace the direction of borrowing a proverb between languages. This is complicated by the fact that the borrowing may have been through plural languages. In some cases, it is possible to make a strong case for discerning the direction of the borrowing based on an artistic form of the proverb in one language, but a prosaic form in another language. For example, in Ethiopia there is a proverb "Of mothers and water, there is none evil." It is found in [[Amharic]], [[Alaba-K'abeena language|Alaaba language]], and [[Oromo language|Oromo]], three languages of Ethiopia:
* Oromo: ''Hadhaa fi bishaan, hamaa hin qaban.''
* Amharic: ''Käənnatənna wəha, kəfu yälläm.''
* Alaaba" ''Wiihaa ʔamaataa hiilu yoosebaʔa''&lt;ref&gt;p. 92. Gertrud Schneider-Blum. 2009. ''Máakuti t'awá shuultáa: Proverbs finish the problems: Sayings of the Alaaba (Ethiopia)''. Köln: Rüdiger Köppe Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Oromo version uses poetic features, such as the initial ''ha'' in both clauses with the final ''-aa'' in the same word, and both clauses ending with ''-an''. Also, both clauses are built with the vowel ''a'' in the first and last words, but the vowel ''i'' in the one syllable central word. In contrast, the Amharic and Alaaba versions of the proverb show little evidence of sound-based art.

However, not all languages have proverbs. Proverbs are (nearly) universal across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Some languages in the Pacific have them, such as Maori.&lt;ref&gt;Brougham, Aileen E., Alexander Wyclif Reed, and Tīmoti Sam Kāretu. ''The Reed book of Maori proverbs.'' Reed Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Pacific languages do not, e.g. "there are no proverbs in [[Kilivila]]" of the [[Trobriand Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 277. Senft, Gunter. 2010. ''The Trobriand Islanders' Ways of Speaking.'' (Volume 27 of Trends in Linguistics. Documentation.) Berlin: Walter de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the New World, there are almost no proverbs: "While proverbs abound in the thousands in most cultures of the world, it remains a riddle why the Native Americans have hardly any proverb tradition at all."&lt;ref&gt;p. 108. Mieder, Wolfgang. 2004. ''Proverbs: A handbook. Greenwood Publishing Group.''&lt;/ref&gt; Hakamies has examined the matter of whether proverbs are found universally, a universal genre, concluding that they are not. &lt;ref&gt;Hakamies, Pekka. 2016. "Proverbs - A Universal Genre?", in ''Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Folklore and Beyond'', ed. by Kaarina Koski and Frog with Ulla Savolainen, p. 299-316. Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
===In conversation===
Proverbs are used in conversation by adults more than children, partially because adults have learned more proverbs than children. Also, using proverbs well is a skill that is developed over years. Additionally, children have not mastered the patterns of metaphorical expression that are invoked in proverb use. Proverbs, because they are indirect, allow a speaker to disagree or give advice in a way that may be less offensive. Studying actual proverb use in conversation, however, is difficult since the researcher must wait for proverbs to happen.&lt;ref&gt;Elias Dominguez Baraja. 2010. ''The function of proverbs in discourse''. Berlin: de Gruyter Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; An Ethiopian researcher, Tadesse Jaleta Jirata, made headway in such research by attending and taking notes at events where he knew proverbs were expected to be part of the conversations.&lt;ref name="Tadesse Jaleta Jirata 2009"&gt;Tadesse Jaleta Jirata. 2009. A contextual study of the social functions of Guji-Oromo proverbs. Saabruecken: DVM Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In literature===
[[File:Not all who wander are lost.png|thumb|[http://www.elvenminstrel.com/tolkien/proverbs.htm Created proverb] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''Lord of the Rings'' on a bumper sticker.]]

Many authors have used proverbs in their writings, for a very wide variety of literary genres: epics,&lt;ref&gt;Yuldybaeva, G.V. 2013. On Research of the Style of the Bashkir Folk Epic "Ural-Batyr" pp. 121-122. ''ETHNOLOGICAL STUDIES OF SHAMANISM AND OTHER INDIGENOUS SPIRITUAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES'', Vol. 15, part 2, pp. 121,122. Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsaaior, James Tar (2010), "Webbed words: masked meanings: proverbiality and narrative/discursive strategies in D. T. Niane's Sundiata: An Epic of Mali". ''Proverbium'' 27: 319–338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adjandeh, Evelyn Aku. 2014. ''A study of Proverbs in "Things Fall Apart" and "Sundiata: An Epic of Old Mali (Sundiata)''.&lt;/ref&gt; novels,&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Obiechina. Culture, tradition and society in the West African novel. Vol. 14. CUP Archive, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; poems,&lt;ref&gt;Renker, Elizabeth. 2014. “Melville and the Worlds of Civil War Poetry.” ''Leviathan'' 16 (2014): 135–52.&lt;/ref&gt;, short stories.&lt;ref&gt;2017. Peter Unseth and Georgi Kapchits. Hemingway’s Somali proverb confirmed. ''ANQ: A Quarterly Journal of Short Articles, Notes and Reviews'' 30(4):253-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the most famous user of proverbs in novels is [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in his ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' series.&lt;ref name="Michael Stanton 1996"&gt;Michael Stanton. 1996. Advice is a dangerous gift. ''Proverbium'' 13: 331-345&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trokhimenko, Olga 2003"&gt;Trokhimenko, Olga. 2003. "If You Sit on the Doorstep Long Enough, You Will Think of Something": The Function of Proverbs in J. R. R. Tolkien's Hobbit." ''[[Proverbium (journal)]]''20: 367-378.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elvenminstrel.com/tolkien/proverbs.htm|title=Tolkien's Proverbs in The Lord of the Rings|website=www.elvenminstrel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, David. 2016. ''The proverbs of Middle-Earth'', 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Melville]] is noted for creating proverbs in [[Moby Dick]]&lt;ref&gt;p. 30. Hayes, Kevin. Melville’s Folk Roots. Kent: Kent State UP, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and in his poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth, Peter. 2015. The Source of Melville’s Iroquois Proverb.

''Leviathan'' 16: 135–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[C. S. Lewis]] created a dozen proverbs in ''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Unseth, Peter. 2011. A culture "full of choice apophthegms and useful maxims": invented proverbs in C.S. Lewis' ''The Horse and His Boy'' ''Proverbium'' 28: 323-338.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mercedes Lackey]] created dozens for her invented [[Shin'a'in]] and Tale'edras cultures;&lt;ref&gt;Proverbs from Velgarth - http://www.dragonlordsnet.com/danp.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Lackey's proverbs are notable in that they are reminiscent to those of Ancient Asia - e.g. "Just because you feel certain an enemy is lurking behind every bush, it doesn't follow that you are wrong" is like to "Before telling secrets on the road, look in the bushes." These authors are notable for not only using proverbs as integral to the development of the characters and the story line, but also for creating proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth, Peter. 2011. A culture "full of choice apophthegms and useful maxims": invented proverbs in C.S. Lewis' ''The Horse and His Boy'' ''Proverbium'' 28: 323-338.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among medieval literary texts, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s [[Troilus and Criseyde]] plays a special role because Chaucer's usage seems to challenge the truth value of proverbs by exposing their epistemological unreliability.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Utz, "''Sic et Non'': Zu Funktion und Epistemologie des Sprichwortes bei Geoffrey Chaucer," ''Das Mittelalter: Perspektiven mediävistischer Forschung'' 2.2 (1997), 31-43.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rabelais]] used proverbs to write an entire chapter of [[Gargantua]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 903. Taylor, Archer. 1950. Proverbs. ''Funk and Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend'', Maria Leach ed. 902-905. New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls.&lt;/ref&gt;

The patterns of using proverbs in literature can change over time. A study of "classical Chinese novels" found proverb use as frequently as one proverb every 3,500 words in ''Water Margin'' (''Sui-hu chuan'') and one proverb every 4,000 words in ''Wen Jou-hsiang''. But modern Chinese novels have fewer proverbs by far.&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard, W. 1967. Some notes on the use of proverbs in Chinese novels. ''Proverbium'' no. 9: 201-208.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hercules &amp; Waggoner2.jpg|left|thumb|"Hercules and the Wagoner", illustration for children's book]]
Proverbs (or portions of them) have been the inspiration for titles of books: ''The Bigger they Come'' by [[Erle Stanley Gardner]], and ''Birds of a Feather'' (several books with this title), ''Devil in the Details'' (multiple books with this title). Sometimes a title alludes to a proverb, but does not actually quote much of it, such as ''The Gift Horse's Mouth'' by Robert Campbell.  Some books or stories have titles that are twisted proverbs, anti-proverbs, such as ''No use dying over spilled milk'',&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Tamar. 1996. ''No use dying over spelled milk''. New York: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; ''When life gives you lululemons,''&lt;ref&gt;Weisburger, Lauren. 2018. ''When life gives you lululemons.'' Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; and two books titled ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers''.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Sarah-Kate. 2004. ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers''. Grand Central Publications and Tricia Goyr &amp; Cara Putman. 2016. ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers.''&lt;/ref&gt; The twisted proveb of last title was also used in the [[Monty Python]] movie [[Life of Brian]], where a person mishears one of Jesus Christ's [[beatitudes]], "I think it was 'Blessed are the cheesemakers.'"

Some books and stories are built around a proverb. Some of Tolkien's books have been analyzed as having "governing proverbs" where "the acton of a book turns on or fulfills a proverbial saying."&lt;ref&gt;p. 332. Stanton, Michael. 1996. "Advice is a dangerous gift": (Pseudo)proverbs in ''The Lord of the Rings''. ''Proverbium'' 13:331-346.&lt;/ref&gt; Some stories have been written with a proverb overtly as an opening, such as "A stitch in time saves nine" at the beginning of "Kitty's Class Day", one of [[Louisa May Alcott]]'s ''Proverb Stories''. Other times, a proverb appears at the end of a story, summing up a moral to the story, frequently found in [[Aesop's Fables]], such as "[[God helps those who help themselves|Heaven helps those who help themselves]]" from ''Hercules and the Wagoner''.&lt;ref&gt;p. 19. Kent, Graeme. 1991. ''Aesop's Fables.'' Newmarket, UK: Brimax.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proverbs have also been used strategically by poets.&lt;ref&gt;Sobieski, Janet and Wolfgang Mieder. 2005. ''"So many heads, so many wits": An anthology of English proverb poetry.'' (Supplement Series of ''Proverbium'', 18.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes proverbs (or portions of them or [[anti-proverb]]s) are used for titles, such as "A bird in the bush" by [[Hilton Young, 1st Baron Kennet|Lord Kennet]] and his stepson [[Peter Scott]] and "[[The blind leading the blind]]" by Lisa Mueller. Sometimes, multiple proverbs are important parts of poems, such as [[Paul Muldoon]]'s "Symposium", which begins "You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it hold its nose to the grindstone and hunt with the hounds. Every dog has a stitch in time..." The Turkish poet Refiki wrote an entire poem by stringing proverbs together, which has been translated into English poetically yielding such verses as "Be watchful and be wary, / But seldom grant a boon; / The man who calls the piper / Will also call the tune."&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Macfie and F. A. Macfie. 2001. A Proverb Poem by Refiki. ''Asian Folklore Studies'' Vol. 60, Issue 1, pp. 5-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because proverbs are familiar and often pointed, they have been used by a number of hip-hop poets. This has been true not only in the USA, birthplace of hip-hop, but also in Nigeria. Since Nigeria is so multilingual, hip-hop poets there use proverbs from various languages, mixing them in as it fits their need, sometimes translating the original. For example,
&lt;br /&gt;"They forget say ogbon ju agbaralo
&lt;br /&gt;They forget that wisdom is greater than power"&lt;ref&gt;p. 43. Akande, Akinmade Timothy and Adebayo
Mosobalaje. 2014. The use of proverbs in hip-hop music: The example of Yoruba proverbs in 9ices's music. ''Proverbium'' 31:35-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have bent and twisted proverbs, creating anti-proverbs, for a variety of literary effects. For example, in the [[Harry Potter]] novels, [[J. K. Rowling]] reshapes a standard English proverb into "It's no good crying over spilt potion" and [[Dumbledore]]
advises Harry not to "count your owls before they are delivered".&lt;ref&gt;Heather A. Haas. 2011. The Wisdom of Wizards—and Muggles and Squibs: Proverb Use in the World of Harry Potter. ''Journal of American Folklore'' 124(492): 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In a slightly different use of reshaping proverbs, in the [[Aubrey–Maturin series]] of historical naval novels by [[Patrick O'Brian]], Capt. [[Jack Aubrey]] humorously mangles and mis-splices proverbs, such as "Never count the bear's skin before it is hatched" and "There's a good deal to be said for making hay while the iron is hot."&lt;ref&gt;Jan Harold Brunvand. 2004. "The Early Bird Is Worth Two in the Bush": Captain Jack Aubrey's Fractured Proverbs. ''What Goes Around Comes Around: The Circulation of Proverbs in Contemporary Life'', Kimberly J. Lau, Peter Tokofsky, Stephen D. Winick, (eds.), pp. 152-170. Logan, Utah: Utah State University Press. [http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1032&amp;context=usupress_pubs&amp;sei-redir=1#search=%22What%20Goes%20Around%20Comes%20Around%3A%20Circulation%20Proverbs%20Contemporary%20Life%2C%22 digitalcommons.usu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier than O'Brian's Aubrey, [[Beatrice Grimshaw]] also used repeated splicings of proverbs in the mouth of an eccentric marquis to create a memorable character in ''The Sorcerer's Stone'', such as "The proof of the pudding sweeps clean" (p.&amp;nbsp;109) and "A stitch in time is as good as a mile" (p.&amp;nbsp;97).&lt;ref&gt;Grimshaw, Beatrice. 1914. ''The Sorcerer’s Stone.'' Philadelphia: John Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because proverbs are so much a part of the language and culture, authors have sometimes used proverbs in historical fiction effectively, but anachronistically, before the proverb was actually known. For example, the novel ''Ramage and the Rebels'', by [[Dudley Pope]] is set in approximately 1800. Captain Ramage reminds his adversary "You are supposed to know that it is dangerous to change horses in midstream" (p.&amp;nbsp;259), with another allusion to the same proverb three pages later. However, the proverb about changing horses in midstream is reliably dated to 1864, so the proverb could not have been known or used by a character from that period.&lt;ref&gt;p. 49, Jennifer Speake. 2008. ''The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs'', 5th ed. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have used so many proverbs that there have been entire books written cataloging their proverb usage, such as [[Charles Dickens]],&lt;ref&gt;George Bryan and Wolfgang Mieder. 1997. ''The Proverbial Charles Dickens''. New York: Peter Lang&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agatha Christie]],&lt;ref&gt;George B. Bryan. 1993. ''Black Sheep, Red Herrings, and Blue Murder: The Proverbial Agatha Christie''. Bern: Peter Lang&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw]],&lt;ref&gt;George B. Bryan and Wolfgang Mieder. 1994. ''The Proverbial Bernard Shaw: An Index to Proverbs in the Works of George Bernard Shaw''. Heinemann Educational Books.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cervantes]],&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. 2006. Tilting at Windmills History &amp; Meaning of a Proverbial Allusion to Cervantes Don Quixote. Burlington: University of Vermont. {{ISBN|0977073130}}    {{ISBN|9780977073139}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. 2017. ''"Stringing proverbs together'': The proverbial language in Miugel Cervantes's "Don Quixote"''.  (Supplement series to Provebium, 38.) Burlington: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Nolte, Wolfgang Mieder. 2012.  Zu meiner Hölle will ich den Weg mit guten Sprüchen pflastern". Friedrich Nietzsches sprichwörtliche Sprache. Broschu.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the non-fiction side, proverbs have also been used by authors for articles that have no connection to the study of proverbs. Some have been used as the basis for book titles, e.g. ''I Shop, Therefore I Am: Compulsive Buying and the Search for Self'' by April Lane Benson. Some proverbs been used as the basis for article titles, though often in altered form: "All our eggs in a broken basket: How the Human Terrain System is undermining sustainable military cultural competence"&lt;ref&gt;Connable, Ben. (2009). All our eggs in a broken basket: How the Human Terrain System is undermining sustainable military cultural competence. Military Review, March–April: 57–64.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Should Rolling Stones Worry About Gathering Moss?"&lt;ref&gt;MUNISHWAR NATH GUPTA. 2017. ''Proceedings of the Indian National Science Academy'' 83 No. 4: 741-743.&lt;/ref&gt;, "Between a Rock and a Soft Place".&lt;ref&gt;Denig, Stephen J. Between a Rock and a Soft Place. ''Christian Higher Education'' 11.1 (2012): 44-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Proverbs have been noted as common in subtitles of articles&lt;ref&gt;p. 154. ''Introduction to Paremiology. A Comprehensive Guide to Proverb Studies'' edited by Hrisztalina Hrisztova-Gotthardt and Melita Aleksa Varga. Berlin: De Gruyter Open. Online: [http://www.degruyter.com/viewbooktoc/product/449649 Open Access version].&lt;/ref&gt; such as "Discontinued intergenerational transmission of Czech in Texas: 'Hindsight is better than foresight'."&lt;ref&gt;Cope, Lida. 2006. "Discontinued intergenerational transmission of Czech in Texas: 'Hindsight is better than foresight'." ''Southern Journal of Linguistics'' 30(2):1-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the reverse is found with a proverb (complete or partial) as the title, then an explanatory subtitle, "To Change or Not to Change Horses: The World War II Elections".&lt;ref&gt;Norpoth, Helmut. 2012. "To Change or Not to Change Horses: The World War II Elections." ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' Volume 42, Issue 2: 324–342.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors have cited proverbs as epigrams at the beginning of their articles, e.g. "'If you want to dismantle a hedge, remove one thorn at a time' Somali proverb" in an article on peacemaking in Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;Ismail I. Ahmed and Reginald H. Green. 1999. The heritage of war and state collapse in Somalia and Somaliland. ''Third World Quarterly'' 20.1:113-127.&lt;/ref&gt; An article about research among the [[Māori people|Māori]] used a Māori proverb as a title, then began the article with the Māori form of the proverb as an epigram "Set the overgrown bush alight and the new flax shoots will spring up", followed by three paragraphs about how the proverb served as a metaphor for the research and the present context.&lt;ref&gt;Pia Pohatu and Tui Aroha Warmenhoven. 2007. Set the overgrowth alight and the new shoots will spring forth: New directions in community based research. ''AlterNative: An International Journal of Indigenous Scholarship'', Special supplement, 109-127.&lt;/ref&gt; A British proverb has even been used as the title for a doctoral dissertation: ''Where there is muck there is brass''.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Tony. 2016. ''Where there’s muck there’s brass! Coinage in the Northumbrian landscape and economy, c.575-c.867.'' Leeds University: Doctoral dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In drama and film===
[[File:Dog in manger poster.jpg|thumb|Play poster from 1899.]]
Similarly to other forms of literature, proverbs have also been used as important units of language in drama and films. This is true from the days of classical Greek works&lt;ref&gt;Russo, Joseph. 1983. The Poetics of the Ancient Greek Proverb. ''Journal of Folklore Research''
Vol. 20, No. 2/3, pp. 121-130&lt;/ref&gt; to [[old French]]&lt;ref&gt;Wandelt, Oswin. 1887. Sprichwörter und Sentenzen des altfranzösischen Dramas (1100-1400. Dissertation at Marburg Fr. Sömmering.&lt;/ref&gt; to Shakespeare,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, F.P. 1981. The proverbial wisdom of Shakespeare. In ''The Wisdom of Many: Essays on the Proverb'', ed. by Wolfgang Mieder and Alan Dundes, p. 174-189. New York: Garland.&lt;/ref&gt; to 19th Century Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Cazal. 2012. Los refranes en el Auto de Caín y Abel, de Jaime Ferruz: frontera entre texto dramático y enunciado proverbial. ''Paremia'' 21: 21-32.[http://www.paremia.org/wp-content/uploads/02-CAZAL.pdf Electronic form]&lt;/ref&gt; to today. The use of proverbs in drama and film today is still found in languages around the world, such as [[Yoruba language|Yorùbá]].&lt;ref&gt;Akíntúndé Akínyemi. 2007. The use of Yorùbá proverbs in Alin Isola's historical drama ''Madam Tinubu: Terror in Lagos''. ''Proverbium'' 24:17-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

A film that makes rich use of proverbs is ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', known for both using and creating proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen David Winick. 1998. "The proverb process: Intertextuality and proverbial innovation in popular culture". University of Pennsylvania dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen David Winick. 2013. Proverb is as proverb does. ''Proverbium''30:377-428.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies of the use of proverbs in film include work by Kevin McKenna on the Russian film ''[[Aleksandr Nevsky]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McKenna. 2009. "Proverbs and the Folk Tale in the Russian Cinema: The Case of Sergei Eisenstein's Film Classic Aleksandr Nevsky." ''The Proverbial «Pied Piper» A Festschrift Volume of Essays in Honor of Wolfgang Mieder on the Occasion of His Sixty-Fifth Birthday'', ed. by Kevin McKenna, pp. 277-292. New York, Bern: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt; Haase's study of an adaptation of [[Little Red Riding Hood]],&lt;ref&gt;Donald Haase. 1990. Is seeing believing? Proverbs and the adaptation of a fairy tale. ''Proverbium'' 7: 89-104.&lt;/ref&gt;  Elias Dominguez Barajas on the film ''[[Viva Zapata!]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Elias Dominguez Baraja. 2010. ''The function of proverbs in discourse'', p. 66, 67. Berlin: de Gruyter Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; and Aboneh Ashagrie on ''[[The Athlete (2009 film)|The Athlete]]'' (a movie in Amharic about [[Abebe Bikila]]).&lt;ref&gt;Aboneh Ashagrie. 2013. The Athlete: a movie about the Ethiopian barefooted Olympic champion. ''Journal of African Cultural Studies'' Vol. 25, No. 1, 119–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', the screenplay by [[Eric Roth]] had more proverbs than the novel by [[Winston Groom]], but for ''[[The Harder They Come]]'', the reverse is true, where the novel derived from the movie by [[Michael Thelwell]] has many more proverbs than the movie.&lt;ref&gt;Coteus, Stephen. 2011. "Trouble never sets like rain": Proverb (in)direction in Michael Thelwell's ''The Harder They Come''. ''Proverbium'' 28:1-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Éric Rohmer]], the French film director, directed a series of films, the "Comedies and Proverbs", where each film was based on a proverb: ''[[The Aviator's Wife]]'', ''[[Le Beau mariage|The Perfect Marriage]]'', ''[[Pauline at the Beach]]'', ''[[Full Moon in Paris]]'' (the film's proverb was invented by Rohmer himself: "The one who has two wives loses his soul, the one who has two houses loses his mind."), ''[[The Green Ray]]'', ''[[Boyfriends and Girlfriends]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pym, John. 1986/1987. Silly Girls. ''Sight and Sound'' 56.1:45-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Movie titles based on proverbs include ''[[Murder Will Out (1939 film)]]'', ''Try, Try Again'', and ''[[The Harder They Fall]]''. A twisted anti-proverb was the title for a [[Three Stooges]] film, ''[[A Bird in the Head]]''. The title of an award-winning Turkish film, [[Three Monkeys]], also invokes a proverb, though the title does not fully quote it.

They have also been used as the titles of plays:&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, George. 2002. Proverbial titles of dramas. ''Proverbium'' 19:65-74.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater|Baby with the Bathwater]]'' by [[Christopher Durang]], ''Dog Eat Dog'' by [[Mary Gallagher]], and ''[[The Dog in the Manger]]'' by [[Charles Hale Hoyt]]. The use of proverbs as titles for plays is not, of course, limited to English plays: ''Il faut qu'une porte soit ouverte ou fermée'' (A door must be open or closed) by [[Paul de Musset]].  Proverbs have also been used in musical dramas, such as ''The Full Monty'', which has been shown to use proverbs in clever ways.&lt;ref&gt;Konstantinova, Anna. 2012. Proverbs in an American musical: A cognitive-discursive study of "The Full Monty". ''Proverbium'' 29:67-93.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', Gaston plays with three proverbs in sequence, "All roads lead to.../The best things in life are.../All's well that ends with me."

===In Music===

Proverbs are often poetic in and of themselves, making them ideally suited for adapting into songs. Proverbs have been used in music from opera to country to hip-hop. Proverbs have also been used in music in other languages, such as the [[Akan language]]&lt;ref&gt;p. 95 ff. Kwesi Yankah. 1989. ''The Proverb in the Context of Akan Rhetoric.'' Bern: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Igede language]],&lt;ref&gt;Ode S. Ogede. 1993. Proverb usage in the praise songs of Igede: ''Adiyah'' poet Micah Ichegbeh.  ''Proverbium'' 10:237-256.&lt;/ref&gt; and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Raúl Eduardo GONZÁLEZ HERNÁNDEZ. Refranes en las canciones de [[Chava Flores]]. ''Paremia'' 20: 2011, pp. 139-148. [http://www.paremia.org/wp-content/uploads/13.GONZALEZ.pdf Electronic access]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In English the proverb (or rather the beginning of the proverb), [[If the shoe fits (disambiguation)|If the shoe fits]] has been used as a title for three albums and five songs. Other English examples of using proverbs in music&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, Geoerge. 2001.  An unfinished List of Anglo-American Proverb Songs. ''Proverbium'' 18:15-56.&lt;/ref&gt; include [[Elvis Presley]]'s ''Easy come, easy go'', Harold Robe's ''Never swap horses when you're crossing a stream'', Arthur Gillespie's ''Absence makes the heart grow fonder'', [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''Like a rolling stone'', [[Cher]]'s ''Apples don't fall far from the tree''. [[Lynn Anderson]] made famous a song full of proverbs, ''[[Rose Garden (Lynn Anderson song)|I never promised you a rose garden]]'' (written by [[Joe South]]). In choral music, we find [[Michael Torke]]'s ''Proverbs'' for female voice and ensemble. A number of [[Blues]] musicians have also used proverbs extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Taft, Michael. 1994. Proverbs in the Blues. ''Proverbium'' 12: 227-258.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prahlad, Sw. Anand. 1996. ''African-American Proverbs in Context''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. See pp. 77ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The frequent use of proverbs in Country music has led to published studies of proverbs in this genre.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Folsom. 1993.

The opera ''Maldobrìe'' contains careful use of proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;V. Dezeljin. 1997. Funzioni testuali dei proverbi nel testo di ''Maldobrìe''. Linguistica (Ljubljana) 37: 89-97.&lt;/ref&gt; An extreme example of many proverbs used in composing songs is a song consisting almost entirely of proverbs performed by [[Bruce Springsteen]], "My best was never good enough".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqJeHXifgLk |title=Bruce Springsteen - My Best Was Never Good Enough - Live 2005 (opening night) video |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Mighty Diamonds]] recorded a song called simply "Proverbs".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyO2Chjy4LM Mighty Diamonds doing "Proverbs"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The band [[Fleet Foxes]] used the proverb painting [[Netherlandish Proverbs]] for the cover of their eponymous album [[Fleet Foxes (album)|Fleet Foxes.]]&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Jonathan. "Why I judge albums by their covers." Wednesday 25 February 2009. ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to proverbs being used in songs themselves, some rock bands have used parts of proverbs as their names, such as the [[Rolling Stones]], [[Bad Company]], [[The Mothers of Invention]], Feast or Famine, [[Of Mice and Men (band)|Of Mice and Men]]. There have been at least two groups that called themselves "The Proverbs", and there is a hip-hop performer in South Africa known as "Proverb".  In addition, many albums have been named with allusions to proverbs, such as ''Spilt milk'' (a title used by [[Jellyfish (band)|Jellyfish]] and also [[Kristina Train]]), ''The more things change'' by [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], ''Silk purse'' by [[Linda Ronstadt]], ''Another day, another dollar'' by DJ Scream Roccett, ''[[The blind leading the naked]]'' by [[Violent Femmes]], ''What's good for the goose is good for the gander'' by [[Bobby Rush (musician)|Bobby Rush]], ''Resistance is Futile'' by [[Steve Coleman]], ''Murder will out'' by [[Fan the Fury]]. The proverb ''Feast or famine'' has been used as an album title by [[Feast or Famine (Chuck Ragan album)|Chuck Ragan]], [[Feast or Famine (Reef the Lost Cauze album)|Reef the Lost Cauze]], Indiginus, and DaVinci. [[Whitehorse (band)|Whitehorse]] mixed two proverbs for the name of their album ''Leave no bridge unburned''. The band Splinter Group released an album titled ''[[When in Rome, do as the Romans do|When in Rome]], Eat Lions''. The band Downcount used a proverb for the name of their tour, ''[[Come and take it]]''.&lt;ref&gt;p. 10. Singh, Anup K. 2017. ''Dictionary of Proverbs''. Neelkanth Prakashan Publihsers.&lt;/ref&gt;

From ancient times, people around the world have recorded proverbs in visual form.  This has been done in two ways. First, proverbs have been ''written'' to be displayed, often in a decorative manner, such as on pottery, cross-stitch, murals,&lt;ref&gt;Victor Khachan. 2012. Courtroom proverbial murals in Lebanon: a semiotic reconstruction of justice. ''Social Semiotics'' DOI:10.1080/10350330.2012.665262&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Charlot. 2007. ''Local Traffic Only: Proverbs Hawaiian Style.'' Watermark Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kanga (African garment)|kangas]] (East African women's wraps),&lt;ref&gt;Rose Marie Beck. 2000. Aesthetics of Communication: Texts on Textiles (Leso) from the East African Coast (Swahili). ''Research in African Literatures'' 31.4: 104-124)&lt;/ref&gt; [[quilt]]s,&lt;ref&gt;MacDowell, Marsha and Wolfgang Mieder. "'When Life Hands You Scraps, Make a Quilt': Quiltmakers and the Tradition of Proverbial Inscriptions." ''Proverbium'' 27 (2010), 113-172.&lt;/ref&gt; a stained glass window,&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Reilly &amp; Mary B. Shepard (2016) “Sufferance fait ease en temps”: word as image at St Michael-le-Belfrey, York. ''Word &amp; Image'' 32:2, 218-234. DOI: 10.1080/02666286.2016.1167577.&lt;/ref&gt; and graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;Szpila, G. (2012). Regulating the reality? Proverbs in Polish graffiti, Estonia and Poland. ''Creativity and Tradition in Cultural Communication'' 1, 269-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, proverbs have often been visually depicted in a variety of media, including paintings, etchings, and sculpture. [[Jakob Jordaens]] painted a plaque with a proverb about drunkenness above a drunk man wearing a crown, titled ''The King Drinks''. Probably the most famous examples of depicting proverbs are the different versions of the paintings ''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'' by the father and son [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], the proverbial meanings of these paintings being the subject of a 2004 conference, which led to a published volume of studies (Mieder 2004a). The same father and son also painted versions of [[The Blind Leading the Blind]], a Biblical proverb. These and similar paintings inspired another famous painting depicting some proverbs and also idioms (leading to a series of additional paintings), such as ''[[Proverbidioms]]'' by [[T. E. Breitenbach]]. Another painting inspired by Bruegel's work is by the Chinese artist, Ah To, who created a painting illustrating 81 Cantonese sayings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://writecantonese8.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/cantonese-proverbs-in-one-picture/|title=Cantonese Proverbs in One Picture|date=25 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Corey Barksdale has produced a book of paintings with specific proverbs and pithy quotations.&lt;ref&gt;Corey Barksdale. 2011. ''Art &amp; Inspirational Proverbs''. Lulu.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The British artist [[Chris Gollon]] has painted a major work entitled "Big Fish Eat Little Fish", a title echoing Bruegel's painting Big Fishes Eat Little Fishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chrisgollon.com/collections/big-fish-eat-little-fish/ |title=Gollon's painting |access-date=2018-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220155210/http://www.chrisgollon.com/collections/big-fish-eat-little-fish/ |archive-date=2017-12-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oliver Pelton - Benjamin Franklin - Poor Richard's Almanac Illustrated.jpg|thumb|Illustrations showing proverbs from Ben Franklin]]
[[File:Three wise monkeys figure.JPG|thumb|[[Three wise monkeys]], invoking a proverb, with no text.]]
Sometimes well-known proverbs are pictured on objects, without a text actually quoting the proverb, such as the [[three wise monkeys]] who remind us "Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil". When the proverb is well known, viewers are able to recognize the proverb and understand the image appropriately, but if viewers do not recognize the proverb, much of the effect of the image is lost. For example, there is a Japanese painting in the [[Ōmiya Bonsai Village|Bonsai museum]] in [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama city]] that depicted flowers on a dead tree, but only when the curator learned the ancient (and no longer current) proverb "Flowers on a dead tree" did the curator understand the deeper meaning of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;p. 426. Yoko Mori. 2012. Review of  ''Dictionary of Japanese Illustrated Proverbs''. ''Proverbium'' 29:435-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of school students found that students remembered proverbs better when there were visual representations of proverbs along with the verbal form of the proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Kamau, Wango. ''Use of Visual Illustration in the Interpretation of Proverbs in Secondary Schools in Kikuyu District, Kiambu County, Kenya''. Kenyatta University PhD dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt;

A bibliography on proverbs in visual form has been prepared by Mieder and Sobieski (1999). Interpreting visual images of proverbs is subjective, but familiarity with the depicted proverb helps.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 203-213. Richard Honeck. 1997. ''A Proverb in Mind''. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artists have used proverbs and anti-proverbs for titles of their paintings, alluding to a proverb rather than picturing it. For example, [[Vivienne LeWitt]] painted a piece titled  "If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot?", which shows neither foot nor shoe, but a woman counting her money as she contemplates different options when buying vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=database and e-research tool for art and design researchers |url=http://www.daao.org.au/bio/work/if-the-shoe-doesnt-fit-must-we-change-the-foot/ |title=If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot? |work=Design and Art Australia Online |publisher=Daao.org.au |date=2012-10-20 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, 13 sculptures depicting Maltese proverbs were installed in open spaces of downtown [[Valletta]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20180203/community/valletta-statue-depicting-proverb-gets-tongues-wagging-online.669628 Article on Maltese proverb sculptures]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2018-02-02/local-news/A-bum-a-bird-and-a-pig-Valletta-2018-unveils-Kif-Jghid-Il-Malti-public-art-installations-6736184371|title=A bum, a bird and a pig: Valletta 2018 unveils ‘Kif Jgħid Il-Malti’ public art installations - The Malta Independent|website=Independent.com.mt|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/mobile/articles/view/20180202/arts-entertainment/valletta-2018-unveils-public-art-installations.669557|title=Arts &amp; Entertainment|website=Timesofmalta.com|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In cartoons===
Cartoonists, both editorial and pure humorists, have often used proverbs, sometimes primarily building on the text, sometimes primarily on the situation visually, the best cartoons combining both. Not surprisingly, cartoonists often twist proverbs, such as visually depicting a proverb literally or twisting the text as an anti-proverb.&lt;ref&gt;Trokhimenko, Olga V. 1999."Wie ein Elefant im Porzellanlanden": Ursprung, Überlieferung und Gebrauch der Redensart in Deutschen und im Englischen. ''Proverbium'' 16: 351-380&lt;/ref&gt; An example with all of these traits is a cartoon showing a waitress delivering two plates with worms on them, telling the customers, "Two early bird specials... here ya go."&lt;ref&gt;The Argyle Sweater, May 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[Three wise monkeys]] were depicted in [[Bizarro]] with different labels. Instead of the negative imperatives, the one with ears covered bore the sign "See and speak evil", the one with eyes covered bore the sign "See and hear evil", etc. The caption at the bottom read "The power of positive thinking."&lt;ref&gt;June 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another cartoon showed a customer in a pharmacy telling a pharmacist, "I'll have an ounce of prevention."&lt;ref&gt;p. 126. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. ''Proverbs are never out of season.'' New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The comic strip [[The Argyle Sweater]] showed an Egyptian archeologist loading a mummy on the roof of a vehicle, refusing the offer of a rope to tie it on, with the caption "A fool and his mummy are soon parted."&lt;ref&gt;Aug 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The comic [[One Big Happy (comic strip)|One Big Happy]] showed a conversation where one person repeatedly posed part of various proverb and the other tried to complete each one, resulting in such humorous results as "Don't change horses... unless you can lift those heavy diapers."&lt;ref&gt;July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Editorial cartoon]]s can use proverbs to make their points with extra force as they can invoke the wisdom of society, not just the opinion of the editors.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraut, Edward James. 1999. "Michel und Mauer": Post-Unification Germany as seen through Editorial Cartoons. Die Unterrichtspraxis 32.2: 143-150.&lt;/ref&gt; In an example that invoked a proverb only visually, when a US government agency ([[General Services Administration|GSA]]) was caught spending money extravagantly, a cartoon showed a [[The pot calling the kettle black|black pot]] labeled "Congress" telling a black kettle labeled "[[General Services Administration|GSA]]", "Stop wasting the taxpayers' money!"&lt;ref&gt;Dana Summers, Orlando Sentinel, Aug 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It may have taken some readers a moment of pondering to understand it, but the impact of the message was the stronger for it.

Cartoons with proverbs are so common that Wolfgang Mieder has published a collected volume of them, many of them [[editorial cartoons]]. For example, a German editorial cartoon linked a current politician to the Nazis, showing him with a bottle of swastika-labeled wine and the caption "[[In vino veritas]]".&lt;ref&gt;p. 389. Wolfgang Mieder. 2013. ''Neues von Sisyphus: Sprichwörtliche Mythen der Anike in moderner Literatur, Medien und Karikaturen.'' Bonn: Praesens.&lt;/ref&gt;

One cartoonist very self-consciously drew and wrote cartoons based on proverbs for the University of Vermont student newspaper ''The Water Tower'', under the title "Proverb place".&lt;ref&gt;Brienne Toomey. 2013. Old wisdom reimagined: Proverbial cartoons for university students. ''Proverbium'' 30: 333-346.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Good things come to those who dont wait.JPG|thumb|''[[Anti-proverb]]'' used in advertising [[Chick-Fil-A]]]]
===In advertising===
[[File:Glass half full kind of day.JPG|left|thumb|''Anti-proverb'' used in [[advertising]]]]
Proverbs are frequently used in advertising, often in slightly modified form.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Mieder and Barbara Mieder. 1977. Tradition and innovation: Proverbs in advertising. ''Journal of Popular Culture'' 11: 308-319.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Winick. 2011. Fall into the (intertextual) gap: Proverbs, advertisements, and intertextual strategies. ''Proverbium'' 28:339-380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Anne Audber de Baubeta. 2000. Bread, the staff of advertising. ''Paremia'' 9: 103-110. [http://www.paremia.org/wp-content/uploads/P9-12.pdf Online]&lt;/ref&gt;
Ford once advertised its Thunderbird with, "One drive is worth a thousand words" (Mieder 2004b: 84). This is doubly interesting since the underlying proverb behind this, "One picture is worth a thousand words," was originally introduced into the English proverb repertoire in an ad for televisions (Mieder 2004b: 83).

A few of the many proverbs adapted and used in advertising include:
* "Live by the sauce, dine by the sauce" ([[Buffalo Wild Wings]])
* "At D &amp; D Dogs, you can teach an old dog new tricks" (D &amp; D Dogs)
* "If at first you don't succeed, you're using the wrong equipment" ([[John Deere]])
* "A pfennig saved is a pfennig earned." ([[Volkswagen]])
* "Not only absence makes the heart grow fonder." ([[Godiva Chocolatier]])
* "Where Hogs fly" ([[Grand Prairie AirHogs]]) baseball team
* "Waste not. Read a lot." ([[Half Price Books]])

The [[GEICO]] company has created a series of television ads that are built around proverbs, such as "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScDoJ2wnug |title=GEICO Commercial - Bird in Hand |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The pen is mightier than the sword",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZd-ql7t1I |title=Is the Pen Mightier? - GEICO Commercial |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Pigs may fly/[[Flying pig|When pigs fly]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-r4Z1K_LDc |title=When pigs fly |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2012-12-18 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If a tree falls in the forest...",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pW2bE61Z9U|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Words can never hurt you".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCysb4_-4jU|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doritos made a commercial based on the proverb, "When pigs fly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQo0TfuueaY|title=When Pigs Fly - Doritos Crash the Super Bowl 2015 WINNER OFFICAL [sic]|first=|last=Nelson Talbot|date=9 November 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many advertisements that use proverbs shorten or amend them, such as, "Think outside the shoebox." 
Use of proverbs in advertising is not limited to the English language. Seda Başer Çoban has studied the use of proverbs in Turkish advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Seda Başer Çoban. 2010. Sözlü Gelenekten Sözün. Geleneksizliğine: Atasözü Ve Reklam [From Oral Tradition to the Traditionless of Speech: Proverb and Advertisement]. ''Millî Folklor''. pp. 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Tatira has given a number of examples of proverbs used in advertising in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;Liveson Tatira. 2001. Proverbs in Zimbabwean advertisements. ''Journal of Folklore Research'' 38.3: 229-241.&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike the examples given above in English, all of which are anti-proverbs, Tatira's examples are standard proverbs. Where the English proverbs above are meant to make a potential customer smile, in one of the Zimbabwean examples "both the content of the proverb and the fact that it is phrased as a proverb secure the idea of a secure time-honored relationship between the company and the individuals". When newer buses were imported, owners of older buses compensated by painting a traditional proverb on the sides of their buses, "Going fast does not assure safe arrival".&lt;ref&gt;p. 233. Liveson Tatira. 2001. Proverbs in Zimbabwean advertisements. ''Journal of Folklore Research'' 38.3: 229-241.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
===Counter proverbs===
There are often proverbs that contradict each other, such as "Look before you leap" and "He who hesitates is lost", or "Many hands make light work" and "Too many cooks spoil the broth". These have been labeled "counter proverbs"&lt;ref name="Charles Clay Doyle 2012"&gt;Charles Clay Doyle. 2012. Counter proverbs. In ''Doing proverbs and other kinds of folklore'', by Charles Clay Doyle, 32-40. (Supplement series of ''Proverbium'' 33.) Burlington: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; or "antonymous proverbs".&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Furnham. 1987. The Proverbial Truth: Contextually Reconciling and the Truthfulness of Antonymous Proverbs. ''Journal of Language and Social Psychology'' 6. 1:49-55.&lt;/ref&gt; When there are such counter proverbs, each can be used in its own appropriate situation, and neither is intended to be a universal truth.&lt;ref&gt;p. 8. Singh, Anup K. 2017. ''Dictionary of Proverbs''. Neelkanth Prakashan Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oldberg, Ragnar. 1965. Ordsprak som poesi. ''Ord och Bild'' 74:564-568.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "counter proverb" is more about pairs of contradictory proverbs than about the use of proverbs to counter each other in an argument. For example, from the [[Tafi language]] of Ghana, the following pair of proverbs are counter to each other but are each used in appropriate contexts, "A co-wife who is too powerful for you, you address her as your mother" and "Do not call your mother's co-wife your mother..."&lt;ref&gt;p. 425, 421. Mercy Bobuafor. 2013. ''The Grammar of Tafi.'' University of Leiden doctoral dissertation.  [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/20916/bookpart.pdf?sequence=23 link to dissertation]&lt;/ref&gt; In Nepali, there is a set of totally contradictory proverbs: "Religion is victorious and sin erodes" and "Religion erodes and sin is victorious".&lt;ref&gt;p. 378. Valerie Inchley. 2010. ''Sitting in my house dreaming of Nepal.'' Kathmandu: EKTA.&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, the following pair are counter proverbs from the Kasena of Ghana: "It is the patient person who will milk a barren cow" and "The person who would milk a barren cow must prepare for a kick on the forehead".&lt;ref&gt;p. 52, Helen Atawube Yitah. 2006. ''Saying Their Own 'truth': Kasena Women's (de)construction of Gender Through Proverbial Jesting.'' Doctoral dissertation, University of Southern California.&lt;/ref&gt; The two contradict each other, whether they are used in an argument or not (though indeed they were used in an argument). But the same work contains an appendix with many examples of proverbs used in arguing for contrary positions, but proverbs that are not inherently contradictory,&lt;ref&gt;p. 157-171, Helen Atawube Yitah. 2006. ''Saying Their Own 'truth': Kasena Women's (de)construction of Gender Through Proverbial Jesting.'' Doctoral dissertation, University of Southern California.&lt;/ref&gt; such as "One is better off with hope of a cow's return than news of its death" countered by "If you don't know a goat [before its death] you mock at its skin". Though this pair was used in a contradictory way in a conversation, they are not a set of "counter proverbs".&lt;ref&gt;p. 8. Singh, Anup K. 2017. ''Dictionary of Proverbs''. Neelkanth Prakashan Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing counter proverbs in the [[Badaga language]], Hockings explained that in his large collection "a few proverbs are mutually contradictory... we can be sure that the Badagas do not see the matter that way, and would explain such apparent contradictions by reasoning that proverb ''x'' is used in one context, while ''y'' is used in quite another."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hockings. 1988. ''Counsel from the ancients: A study of Badaga proverbs, prayers, omens, and curses.'' Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing Korean proverbs, "when you compare two proverbs, often they will be contradictory." They are used for "a particular situation".&lt;ref&gt;p. 76. Jeyseon Lee. 2006. "Korean proverbs." In ''Korean language in culture and society,'' ed. by Ho-min Sohn, 74-85. University of Hawai'i Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Counter proverbs" are not the same as a "paradoxical proverb", a proverb that contains a seeming paradox.&lt;ref&gt;Bendt Alster. 1975. Paradoxical Proverbs and Satire in Sumerian Literature.  ''Journal of Cuneiform Studies'' 27.4: 201-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaproverbs===
In many cultures, proverbs are so important and so prominent that there are proverbs about proverbs, that is, "metaproverbs". The most famous one is from [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] of Nigeria, "Proverbs are the horses of speech, if communication is lost we use proverbs to find it," used by [[Wole Soyinka]] in ''Death and the King's Horsemen''.  In Mieder's bibliography of proverb studies, there are twelve publications listed as describing metaproverbs.&lt;ref&gt;p. 1050. Wolfgang Mieder. 2008. ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; Other metaproverbs include:
* As a boy should resemble his father, so should the proverb fit the conversation." (Afar, Ethiopia)&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Enid. 1971. Afar stories, riddles, and proverbs. ''Journal of Ethiopian Studies'' 9:292-320.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Proverbs are the cream of language" (Afar of Ethiopia)&lt;ref&gt;p. 283. Parker, Enid. 1971. Afar stories, riddles, and proverbs. ''Journal of Ethiopian Studies'' 9:292-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a growing interest in deliberately using proverbs to achieve goals, usually to support and promote changes in society. On the negative side, this was deliberately done by the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. 1982. Proverbs in Nazi Germany: The Promulgation of Anti-Semitism and Stereotypes Through Folklore. ''The Journal of American Folklore'' 95, No. 378, pp. 435–464.&lt;/ref&gt; On the more positive side, proverbs have also been used for constructive purposes. For example, proverbs have been used for teaching foreign languages at various levels.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, April. 2004. Good Proverbs Make Good Students: Using Proverbs to Teach German Quickly.

Studia Anglica Posnaniensia: An International Review of English Studies 37: 173-200.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, proverbs have been used for public health promotion, such as promoting breast feeding with a shawl bearing a Swahili proverb "Mother's milk is sweet".&lt;ref&gt;[http://massbreastfeeding.org/aboutKanga.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724213805/http://massbreastfeeding.org/aboutKanga.html |date=July 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proverbs have also been applied for helping people manage diabetes,&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks, Leo and Rosetta Hendricks. 1994.

The most active field deliberately using proverbs is Christian ministry, where [[Joseph G. Healey]] and others have deliberately worked to catalyze the [[Paremiography|collection of proverbs]] from smaller languages and the application of them in a wide variety of church-related ministries, resulting in publications of collections&lt;ref&gt;Atido , George Pirwoth. 2011. Insights from Proverbs of the Alur in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  In Collaboration with African Proverb Saying and Stories, www.afriprov.org.

U.S. Navy Captain [[Edward Zellem]] pioneered the use of [[Afghan proverbs]] as a positive relationship-building tool during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]], and in 2012 he published two bilingual collections&lt;ref&gt;Zellem, Edward. 2012. {{cite web|url=http://www.afghanproverbs.com|title=''Zarbul Masalha: 151 Afghan Dari Proverbs''|publisher=Charleston: CreateSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zellem, Edward. 2012. {{cite web|url=http://www.afghanproverbs.com|title=''Afghan Proverbs Illustrated''|publisher=Charleston: CreateSpace}}, now also available with translations into German, French, and Russian.&lt;/ref&gt; of Afghan proverbs in [[Dari Persian|Dari]] and English, part of an effort of nationbuilding, followed by a volume of [[Pashto]] proverbs in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Zellem. 2014.

===Cultural values===
[[File:Study proverb.PNG|thumb|250x|Chinese proverb. It says, "Learn till old, live till old, and there is still three-tenths not learned," meaning that no matter how old you are, there is still more learning or studying left to do.]]
[[File:Better a monk.JPG|thumb|Thai proverb depicted visually at a temple, "Better a monk"]]
There is a longstanding debate among proverb scholars as to whether the cultural values of specific language communities are reflected (to varying degree) in their proverbs. Many claim that the proverbs of a particular culture reflect the values of that specific culture, at least to some degree. Many writers have asserted that the proverbs of their cultures reflect their culture and values; this can be seen in such titles as the following: ''An introduction to Kasena society and culture through their proverbs'',&lt;ref&gt;Albert Kanlisi Awedoba.  2000. University Press Of America&lt;/ref&gt; Prejudice, power, and poverty in Haiti: a study of a nation's culture as seen through its proverbs,&lt;ref&gt;Linda Tavernier-Almada. 1999.

However, a number of scholars argue that such claims are not valid. They have used a variety of arguments. Grauberg argues that since many proverbs are so widely circulated they are reflections of broad human experience, not any one culture's unique viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Grauberg. 1989. Proverbs and idioms: mirrors of national experience? ''Lexicographers and their works'', ed. by Gregory James, 94-99. Exeter: University of Exeter.&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this line of argument, from a collection of 199 American proverbs, Jente showed that only 10 were coined in the USA, so that most of these proverbs would not reflect uniquely American values.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jente. 1931-1932. The American Proverb. ''American Speech'' 7:342-348.&lt;/ref&gt; Giving another line of reasoning that proverbs should not be trusted as a simplistic guide to cultural values, Mieder once observed "proverbs come and go, that is, antiquated proverbs with messages and images we no longer relate to are dropped from our proverb repertoire, while new proverbs are created to reflect the mores and values of our time",&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. ''Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; so old proverbs still in circulation might reflect past values of a culture more than its current values. Also, within any language's proverb repertoire, there may be "counter proverbs", proverbs that contradict each other on the surface&lt;ref name="Charles Clay Doyle 2012"/&gt; (see section above). When examining such counter proverbs, it is difficult to discern an underlying cultural value. With so many barriers to a simple calculation of values directly from proverbs, some feel "one cannot draw conclusions about values of speakers simply from the texts of proverbs".&lt;ref&gt;p. 261. Sw. Anand Prahlad. 1996. ''African American Proverbs in Context''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many outsiders have studied proverbs to discern and understand cultural values and world view of cultural communities.&lt;ref&gt;Niemeyer, Larry L., "Proverbs : tools for world view studies : an exploratory comparison of the Bemba of Zambia and the Shona of Zimbabwe" (1982). Dissertations and Theses. Paper 886. http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/open_access_etds/886&lt;/ref&gt; These outsider scholars are confident that they have gained insights into the local cultures by studying proverbs, but this is not universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jente. 1931-1932. The American Proverb. ''American Speech'' 7:342-348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grauberg, Walter. 1989. Proverbs and idioms: mirrors of national experience? In ''Lexicographers and their works'', ed. by Gregory James, 94-99. Exeter: University of Exeter.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Whiting, Bartlett J. 1994.

Seeking empirical evidence to evaluate the question of whether proverbs reflect a culture's values, some have counted the proverbs that support various values. For example, Moon lists what he sees as the top ten core cultural values of the [[Builsa]] society of Ghana, as exemplified by proverbs. He found that 18% of the proverbs he analyzed supported the value of being a member of the community, rather than being independent.&lt;ref&gt;p. 134. W. Jay Moon. 2009. ''African Proverbs Reveal Christianity in Culture: A Narrative Portrayal of Builsa Proverbs''. Eugene, OR: Pickwick Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This was corroboration to other evidence that collective community membership is an important value among the Builsa. In studying Tajik proverbs, Bell notes that the proverbs in his corpus "Consistently illustrate Tajik values" and "The most often observed proverbs reflect the focal and specific values" discerned in the thesis.&lt;ref&gt;p. 139 &amp; 157. Evan Bell. 2009. ''An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Masters thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of English proverbs created since 1900 showed in the 1960s a sudden and significant increase in proverbs that reflected more casual attitudes toward sex.&lt;ref&gt;p. 120. Peter Unseth. Review of ''Dictionary of Modern Proverbs''. ''American Speech'' 90.1:117-121.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s was also the decade of the [[Sexual revolution]], this shows a strong statistical link between the changed values of the decades and a change in the proverbs coined and used. Another study mining the same volume counted Anglo-American proverbs about religion to show that proverbs indicate attitudes toward religion are going downhill.&lt;ref&gt;Petrova, Roumyana. 2016. How Religious Are The Modern Anglo-American Proverbs: A Linguocultural Study. ''Proceedings of the world congress of the IASS/AIS'', Editor in Chief: Kristian Bankov.  ISSN 2414-6862. [http://www.iass-ais.org/proceedings2014/view_lesson.php?id=81 Web access]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many examples where cultural values have been explained and illustrated by proverbs. For example, from India, the concept that birth determines one's nature "is illustrated in the oft-repeated proverb: there can be no friendship between grass-eaters and meat-eaters, between a food and its eater".&lt;ref&gt;p. 22, [[Patrick Olivelle]]. 2013. Talking Animals: Explorations in an Indian Literary Genre. ''Religions of South Asia'' 7.14-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Proverbs have been used to explain and illustrate the [[Fula people|Fulani]] cultural value of ''pulaaku''.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Leger and Abubakar B. Mohammad. 2000. The concept of pulaaku mirrored in Fulfulde proverbs of the Gombe dialect. ''Berichte des Sonderforschungsbereichs 268, Band 14, Frankfurt a.M. 2000: 299-306.&lt;/ref&gt; But using proverbs to ''illustrate'' a cultural value is not the same as using a collection of proverbs to ''discern'' cultural values. In a comparative study between Spanish and Jordanian proverbs it is defined the social imagination for the mother as an archetype in the context of role transformation and in contrast with the roles of husband, son and brother, in two societies which might be occasionally associated with sexist and /or rural ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Sbaihat, Ahlam (2012). La imagen de la madre en el refranero español y jordano. Estudio de Paremiología comparada. España: Sociedad Española de Estudios Literarios de Cultura Popular, Oceanide, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have adopted a cautious approach, acknowledging at least a genuine, though limited, link between cultural values and proverbs: "The cultural portrait painted by proverbs may be fragmented, contradictory, or otherwise at variance with reality... but must be regarded not as accurate renderings but rather as tantalizing shadows of the culture which spawned them."&lt;ref&gt;p. 173.Sheila K.  Webster. 1982. Women, Sex, and Marriage in Moroccan Proverbs. ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' 14:173-184.&lt;/ref&gt; There is not yet agreement on the issue of whether, and how much, cultural values are reflected in a culture's proverbs.

It is clear that the Soviet Union believed that proverbs had a direct link to the values of a culture, as they used them to try to create changes in the values of cultures within their sphere of domination. Sometimes they took old Russian proverbs and altered them into socialist forms.&lt;ref&gt;p. 84ff. Andrey Reznikov. 2009. ''Old wine in new bottles: Modern Russian anti-proverbs.'' (Supplement Series of ''Proverbium'', 27.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont&lt;/ref&gt; These new proverbs promoted Socialism and its attendant values, such as atheism and collectivism, e.g. "Bread is given to us not by Christ, but by machines and collective farms" and "A good harvest is had only by a collective farm." They did not limit their efforts to Russian, but also produced "newly coined proverbs that conformed to socialist thought" in Tajik and other languages of the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Evan Bell. 2009. ''An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Masters thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Proverb scroll.PNG|thumb|left|Scroll of the Biblical [[Book of Proverbs]]]]

===Religion===
Many proverbs from around the world address matters of ethics and expected of behavior. Therefore, it is not surprising that proverbs are often important texts in religions. The most obvious example is the [[Book of Proverbs]] in the Bible. Additional proverbs have also been coined to support religious values, such as the following from [[Dari Persian|Dari]] of Afghanistan:&lt;ref&gt;p. 54, J. Christy Wilson, Jr. 2004. ''One hundred Afghan Persian proverbs'' 3rd, edition. Peshawar, Pakistan: InterLit Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; "In childhood you're playful, In youth you're lustful, In old age you're feeble, So when will you before God be worshipful?"

Clearly proverbs in religion are not limited to monotheists; among the Badaga of India (Sahivite Hindus), there is a traditional proverb "Catch hold of and join with the man who has placed sacred ash [on himself]."&lt;ref&gt;p. 601, Paul Hockings. 1988. ''Counsel from the Ancients: A study of Badaga proverbs, prayers, omens and curses''. Berlin: de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs are widely associated with large religions that draw from sacred books, but they are also used for religious purposes among groups with their own traditional religions, such as the Guji Oromo.&lt;ref name="Tadesse Jaleta Jirata 2009"/&gt; The broadest comparative study of proverbs across religions is ''The eleven religions and their proverbial lore, a comparative study. A reference book to the eleven surviving major religions of the world'' by Selwyn Gurney Champion, from 1945. Some sayings from sacred books also become proverbs, even if they were not obviously proverbs in the original passage of the sacred book.&lt;ref&gt;Ziyad Mohammad Gogazeh and Ahmad Husein Al-Afif. 2007. Los proverbios árabes extraidos del ''Corán'': recopilación, traducción,  y estudio. ''Paremia'' 16: 129-138.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many quote "Be sure your sin will find you out" as a proverb from the Bible, but there is no evidence it was proverbial in its original usage ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 32:23).

Not all religious references in proverbs are positive, some are cynical, such as the Tajik, "Do as the mullah says, not as he does."&lt;ref&gt;p. 130, Evan Bell. 2009. ''The wit and wisdom of the Tajiks: An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics, MA thesis.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, note the Italian proverb, "One barrel of wine can work more miracles than a church full of saints". An Indian proverb is cynical about devotees of Hinduism, "[Only] When in distress, a man calls on Rama".&lt;ref&gt;p. 16, P. R. Gurdon. 1895. ''Some Assamese proverbs.'' Shillong, India: Assam Secretariat Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of Tibetan Buddhism, some Ladakhi proverbs mock the lamas, e.g. "If the lama's own head does not come out cleanly, how will he do the drawing upwards of the dead?... used for deriding the immoral life of the lamas."&lt;ref&gt;p. 142. August Francke. 1901. A collection of Ladakhi proverbs. ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'' 2: 135-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Proverbs do not have to explicitly mention religion or religious figures to be used to mock a religion, seen in the fact that in a collection of 555 proverbs from the [[Lur people|Lur]], a Muslim group in Iran, the explanations for 15 of them use illustrations that mock Muslim clerics.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Unseth (2017). Review of ''Warm Hearts and Sharp Tongues: Life in 555 Proverbs from the Zagros Mountains of Iran''. ''Iranian Studies'' 50:1, 163-167, DOI:10.1080/00210862.2017.1269451&lt;/ref&gt;

Dammann thought "The influence of Islam manifests itself in African proverbs... Christian influences, on the contrary, are rare."&lt;ref&gt;p. 46. Ernst Dammann. 1972. Die Religion in Afrikanischen Sprichwörter und Rätseln. ''Anthropos'' 67:36-48. Quotation in English, from summary at end of article.&lt;/ref&gt;  If widely true in Africa, this is likely due to the longer presence of Islam in many parts of Africa. Reflection of Christian values is common in Amharic proverbs of Ethiopia, an area that has had a presence of Christianity for well over 1,000 years. The Islamic proverbial reproduction may also be shown in the image of some animals such as the dog. Although dog is portrayed in many European proverbs as the most faithful friend of man, it is represented in some Islamic countries as impure, dirty, vile, cowardly, ungrateful and treacherous, in addition to links to negative human superstitions such as loneliness, indifference and bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;Sharab, Moayad; Sbaihat, Ahlam; Al Duweiri, Hussein (2013).

===Psychology===
Though much proverb scholarship is done by literary scholars, those studying the human mind have used proverbs in a variety of studies.&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. "The use of proverbs in psychological testing." ''Journal of the Folklore Institute'' 15.1 (1978): 45-55.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest studies in this field is the ''Proverbs Test'' by Gorham, developed in 1956. A similar test is being prepared in German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/neuropsy/testsE/sprichwort.html |title=Institut für Kognitive Neurowissenschaft |publisher=Ruhr-uni-bochum.de |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proverbs have been used to evaluate [[dementia]],&lt;ref&gt;Yamaguchi, Haruyasu; Yohko Maki, Tomoharu Yamaguchi. 2011.

==Paremiology==
{{main article|Paremiology}}
The study of proverbs is called '''paremiology''' which has a variety of uses in the study of such topics as [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], and [[folklore]]. There are several types and styles of proverbs which are analyzed within Paremiology as is the use and misuse of familiar expressions which are not strictly 'proverbial' in the dictionary definition of being fixed sentences

===Paremiological minimum===
Grigorii Permjakov&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.arnes.si/~bridges/proverb_wisdom.htm|title=Photo and Web page about Permjakov|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the concept of the core set of proverbs that full members of society know, what he called the "paremiological minimum" (1979). For example, an adult American is expected to be familiar with "Birds of a feather flock together", part of the American paremiological minimum. However, an average adult American is not expected to know "Fair in the cradle, foul in the saddle", an old English proverb that is not part of the current American paremiological minimum. Thinking more widely than merely proverbs, Permjakov observed "every adult Russian language speaker (over 20 years of age) knows no fewer than 800 proverbs, proverbial expressions, popular literary quotations and other forms of cliches".&lt;ref&gt;p. 91 Grigorii L'vovich Permiakov. 1989.

===Sources for proverb study===
[[File:Books on proverb study.jpg|thumb|A sample of books used in the study of proverbs.]]

A seminal work in the study of proverbs is Archer Taylor's ''The Proverb'' (1931), later republished by [[Wolfgang Mieder]] with Taylor's Index included (1985/1934). A good introduction to the study of proverbs is Mieder's 2004 volume, ''Proverbs: A Handbook''. Mieder has also published a series of bibliography volumes on proverb research, as well as a large number of articles and other books in the field. Stan Nussbaum has edited a large collection on proverbs of Africa, published on a CD, including reprints of out-of-print collections, original collections, and works on analysis, bibliography, and application of proverbs to Christian ministry (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Mbiti, John. 2002. The African proverbs project and after. ''Lexikos'', 12(1): 256-263.&lt;/ref&gt; Paczolay has compared proverbs across Europe and published a collection of similar proverbs in 55 languages (1997). Mieder edits an academic journal of proverb study, ''[[Proverbium (journal)|Proverbium]]'' ({{ISSN|0743-782X}}), many back issues of which are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://https//catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006930797|title=Proverbium.|first1=|last1=Universiṭah ha-ʻIvrit bi-Yerushalayim.|first2=|last2=University of Vermont.|first3=|last3=Ohio State University.|date=29 November 1984|publisher=|pages=v.|via=Hathi Trust}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A volume containing articles on a wide variety of topics touching on proverbs was edited by Mieder and [[Alan Dundes]] (1994/1981). ''Paremia'' is a Spanish-language journal on proverbs, with articles available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/paremia/ Web access to ''Paremia'']&lt;/ref&gt; There are also papers on proverbs published in conference proceedings volumes from the annual Interdisciplinary Colloquium on Proverbs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colloquium-proverbs.org/icp/en/ |title=Conference website |publisher=Colloquium-proverbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]], Portugal. Mieder has published a two-volume ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology'', with a topical, language, and author index.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Mieder. 2008. ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; Mieder has published a bibliography of collections of proverbs from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. 2011.

Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; A broad introduction to proverb study, ''Introduction to Paremiology'', edited by Hrisztalina Hrisztova-Gotthardt and Melita Aleksa Varga has been published in both hardcover and free open access, with articles by a dozen different authors.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Paremiology.

===Noteworthy proverb scholars (paremiologists and paremiographers)===
The study of proverbs has been built by a number of notable scholars and contributors. Earlier scholars were more concerned with collecting than analyzing. [[Desiderius Erasmus]] was a Latin scholar (1466 – 1536), whose collection of Latin proverbs, known as ''[[Adagia]]'', spread Latin proverbs across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Erasmus, Desiderius. Adages in Collected Works of Erasmus. Trans. R.A.B Mynors et al. Volumes 31–36. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1982–2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan de Mal Lara]] was a 16th century Spanish scholar, one of his books being 1568 ''Philosophia vulgar'', the first part of which contains one thousand and one sayings.

From the 20th century onwards, proverb scholars were involved in not only collecting proverbs, but also analyzing and comparing proverbs. [[Alan Dundes]] was a 20th century American folklorist whose scholarly output on proverbs led Wolfgang Mieder to refer to him as a “pioneering paremiologist”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol35/mieder.pdf|title=Alan Dundes as Pioneering Paremiologist.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matti Kuusi]] was a 20th century Finnish paremiologist, the creator of the Matti Kuusi international type system of proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Lauhakangas, Outi. 2013. The Matti Kuusi International Database of Proverbs. ''Oral Tradition'' 28/2 (2013): 217–222. ([http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/28ii/06_28.2.pdf Article on his Proverb Type System.])&lt;/ref&gt; With encouragement from [[Archer Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;Lauhakangas, Outi. 2014. Categorization of proverbs, p. 59. ''Introduction to Paremiology'', ed. by Hrisztalina Hrisztova-Gotthardt and Melita Aleksa Varga, pp. 49–67. Berlin: de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; he founded the journal ''Proverbium: Bulletin d'Information sur les Recherches Parémiologiques'', published from 1965 to 1975 by the Society for Finnish Literature, which was later restarted as ''[[Proverbium (journal)|Proverbium: International Yearbook of Proverb Scholarship]]''. Archer Taylor was a 20th century American scholar, best known for his "magisterial"&lt;ref&gt;p. xiv, Mieder, Wolfgang. ''Proverbs: A handbook''. Westport, CT: Grenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; book ''The Proverb''.&lt;ref&gt;1931. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dimitrios Loukatos]] was a 20th century Greek proverb scholar, author of such works as ''Aetiological Tales of Modern Greek Proverbs''.&lt;ref&gt;''Aetiological Tales of Modern Greek Proverbs'' (Ermis: Athens, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arvo Krikmann]] (1939 – 2017) was an Estonian proverb scholar, whom Wolfgang Mieder called “one of the leading paremiologists in the world”&lt;ref&gt;p. vi. Wolfgang Mieder. 2009. Editor’s Preface. ''Proverb semantics: Studies in structure, logic, and metaphor'', edited by Wolfgang Mieder, pp. v-viii. (Supplement Series to ''Proverbium'', 29.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; and “master folklorist and paremiologist”.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5. Wolfgang Mieder. Arvo Krikmann: Master folklorist and paremiologist. ''Proverbium'' 31: 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisabeth Piirainen]] was a German scholar with 50 proverb-related publications.&lt;ref&gt;p. 640-646. Wolfgang Mieder. 2009 ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology''. Berlin: de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Current proverb scholars have continued the trend to be involved in analysis as well as collection of proverbs. [[Claude Buridant]] is a century French scholar whose work has concentrated on [[Romance languages]].&lt;ref&gt;1976. Nature and function of proverbs in jeux-partis. ''Revue des sciences humaines'' 163.3 (1976): 377-418.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Galit Hasan-Rokem]] is an Israeli scholar, associate editor of ''Proverbium: The yearbook of international proverb scholarship'', since 1984. She has written on proverbs in Jewish traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan-Rokem, Galit. Web of life: Folklore and Midrash in Rabbinic literature. Stanford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph G. Healey]] is an American Catholic missionary in Kenya who has led a movement to sponsor African proverb scholars to collect proverbs from their own language communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afriprov.org/index.php/meetings/624-minutes-of-the-meeting-of-the-african-proverbs-working-group-saturday-28-april-2012-.html ''Minutes of the Meeting of the African Proverbs Working Group,'' ''Christ the Teacher Parish, Kenyatta University'' Nairobi, Kenya, Saturday, 28 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This led Wolfgang Mieder to dedicate the "International Bibliography of New and Reprinted Proverb Collections" section of ''Proverbium'' 32 to Healey.&lt;ref&gt;p. 457. International Bibliography of New and Reprinted Proverb Collections. ''Proverbium'' 32: 457-466.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]] is a scholar of Jewish history and folklore, including proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, Barbara.

'''Ragnar Hovland''' (born 15 April 1952 in [[Bergen]]) is a Norwegian novelist, essayist, poet, and writer of children's books.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ragnar Hovland |first= |last= |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor-last=Bolstad | editor-first=Erik | editor-link= |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon |location=Oslo |url=https://snl.no/Ragnar_Hovland |language=Norwegian |accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ragnar Hovland |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Sverre  |last=Tusvik |authorlink= |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=https://nbl.snl.no/Ragnar_Hovland | language=Norwegian |accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hovland was born in [[Bergen]] to priest Håkon Hovland and schoolteacher Sigrid Indrebø, and grew up in [[Strandvik]] and [[Luster, Norway|Luster]]. He was married to Sabine Angelika Rolka from 1978 to 1992, and to Tove Olaug Bakke since 1996.&lt;ref name =nbl/&gt;

==Career==
Hovland made his literary debut in 1979, with the novel ''{{ill|Alltid fleire dagar|nn}}''.&lt;ref name =snl/&gt; The book follows four young boys from secondary school to college. Their interests circle around [[rock music]], alcohol, a dose of politics and girls.&lt;ref name=rottem&gt;{{cite book |title=Norges Litteraturhistorie. Etterkrigslitteraturen |chapter= Ragnar Hovland &amp;ndash; livet på veiene |pages=458–473 |first=Øystein |last=Rottem |authorlink=Øystein Rottem | |volume=3 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |year=1998 |language=Norwegian |isbn=82-02-16426-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He followed up with the [[short story]] collection ''{{ill|Vegen smal og porten trang|no}}'' (1981). The collection includes the stories "Dei siste beat-poetane i Midthordaland", where two wannabe poets are expelled from the gang and instead read their works for a herd of wet sheep; further "Sommarens blå flygel", where two young lovers are surprised by the boy's father, who expresses concern that they could catch a [[Common cold|cold]] since they lie naked on the ground. In the [[surrealistic]] story "Songen om Emilia", a young man finds a dead body on the floor three days in a row, and is unable to get rid of the corps, even if he pushes them into the cupboard every time.&lt;ref name=rottem/&gt; 

The novel ''Sveve over vatna'' (1982) is set in Bergen, and the protagonist is a student who gets involved in various strange adventures.&lt;ref name=rottem/&gt;

He was awarded the [[Brage Prize]] in 1992 for the children's book ''Ein motorsykkel i natta''.&lt;ref name=brage-former&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brageprisen.no/tekster/tidligere.shtml|title=Tidligere vinnere av Brageprisen|work=|date=|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2008-10-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610082646/http://www.brageprisen.no/tekster/tidligere.shtml|archivedate=2008-06-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[Norwegian Critics Prize for Literature]] in 2001, for the novel ''Ei vinterreise''.

'''Riograndenser Hunsrückisch''', spoken in parts of [[Brazil]], is a [[Moselle Franconian dialects|Moselle Franconian variety]] derived primarily from the [[Hunsrückisch dialect]] of [[West Central German]].

Riograndenser Hunsrückisch developed from the Hunsrückisch dialect when immigrants from the [[Hunsrück]] region of [[Germany]] ([[Rhineland-Palatinate]]) settled in southern regions such as  [[Rio Grande do Sul]], starting by imperial designs in [[1824]] (these later became projects controlled by states and finally by private European investment enterprises).

While primarily based on the Hunsrückisch branch of the German language it has also been greatly influenced by other German dialects such as [[East Pomeranian dialect|East Pomeranian]] and [[Plautdietsch language|Plautdietsch]] and by [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the national language of Brazil and, to a lesser extent, by indigenous languages such as [[Kaingang]] and [[Guaraní language|Guarani]] and by immigrant languages such as [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Talian dialect|Talian]].

Portuguese expressions and words are commonly imported into Riograndenser Hunsrückisch, particularly in reference to fauna and flora (which are different from that of Germany) and to technological innovations that did not exist when the original immigrants came to Brazil, leading to words like {{lang|hrx|Aviong}} for airplane (Portuguese {{wikt-lang|pt|avião}}) instead of {{wikt-lang|de|Flugzeug}}, {{lang|hrx|Kamiong}} (Pt. {{wikt-lang|pt|caminhão}}, truck) instead of {{wikt-lang|de|Lastwagen}}, {{lang|hrx|Televisong}} (Pt. {{wikt-lang|pt|televisão}}) instead of {{wikt-lang|de|Fernseher}}, etc. Daily expressions are often [[calque]]s (literal translations) of Portuguese.

Also common are the use of German suffixes attached to Portuguese words, such as {{lang|hrx|Canecache}}, "little mug", from Portuguese {{lang|pt|caneca}}, "mug", and German diminutive suffix {{wikt-lang|de|chen}} ({{lang|hrx|[[wikt:-che#Central Franconian|-che]]}} in Riograndenser Hunsrückisch); hybrid forms such as {{lang|hrx|Schuhloja}}, "shoe shop", from German {{wikt-lang|de|Schuh}} and Portuguese {{wikt-lang|pt|loja}}, and Germanized forms of Portuguese verbs: {{lang|hrx|lembreere}}, "to remember"; {{lang|hrx|namoreere}} "to flirt"; {{lang|hrx|respondeere}}, "to answer" (Portuguese {{wikt-lang|pt|lembrar}}, {{wikt-lang|pt|namorar}}, and {{wikt-lang|pt|responder}}). However, regardless of these borrowings, its grammar and vocabulary are still largely German.

Although Riograndenser Hunsrückisch is the most common German dialect in south Brazil, the use of this language—particularly in the last three to four generations—continues to decrease.

Roman Catholic Cardinal [[Cláudio Hummes]] of [[Montenegro, Rio Grande do Sul|Montenegro]], Rio Grande do Sul (in the ''Altkolonie'' region of the state), grew up speaking Portuguese together with this regional variety of German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhein-zeitung.de/region/lokales/hunsrueck_artikel,-Kardinal-Hummes-kehrt-in-den-Hunsrueck-zurueck-_arid,420691.html|title=''Kardinal Hummes kehrt in den Hunsrück zurück''. Newspaper Rhein-Zeitung: Buch, Hunsrück, 07/05/2012|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the famous world model [[Gisele Bündchen]] her parents and siblings still speak this Brazilian regional variety of German, although, also according to her, she has forgotten everything herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gisele Bündchen: "Brazil Should Become World Champion" |url=http://www.dw.com/en/gisele-b%C3%BCndchen-brazil-should-become-world-champion/a-2029705 |accessdate=13 October 2016 |agency=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=27 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013170938/http://www.dw.com/en/gisele-b%C3%BCndchen-brazil-should-become-world-champion/a-2029705 |archivedate=13 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview in 2011, renowned Brazilian writer, translator and [[international relations]] professor [[Aldyr Schlee]] talked in detail about having been an eyewitness to the repression of the German language in his native state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] during [[World War II]].

Orthography between plain angle brackets follows Wiesemann's&lt;ref name=Wiesemann /&gt; orthography and between italic angle brackets follows Altenhofen et al.'s&lt;ref name=Altenhofen /&gt; orthography.

The contrast between plosives is not of [[voice (phonetics)|voice]], but of [[fortis and lenis|articulatory force]], a phenomenon observed in some other dialects of German.

==Sample==
Chapter 23, 1–5 of Luke's Gospel in Riograndenser Hunsrückisch, according to Dr. Ursula Wiesemann's&lt;ref name=Wiesemann /&gt; orthography:

''Yeesus un Pilatos''

''23 Too sin ti kanse layt uf kextii, hon Yeesus pis Pilatos kenom un hon aan kefang aan se këwe un saare: 2 Mëyer hon too te man aan ketrof unser folek am uf hëtse. Tee is te keeche em khayser xtayer petsaale un saat wëyer te Mësiias un Kheenich. 3 Too hot te Pilatos kefroot: Pixt tu te Yute sayne Kheenich? Is woer, hot Yeesus keantwort. 4 Too hot Pilatos fer te hooche priister un tsum folek kesaat: Ich khan khee xult an tëm man fine! 5 Awer tii hon aan kehal un hon kesaat: Tee tuut unortnung aan richte unich em folek mit sayn untricht iweraal in Yuteeya. In Kalileeya hot er aan kefang, un yëts is er too pay uns.''


The same text in Standard German:

23 Und die ganze Versammlung stand auf, und sie führten ihn vor Pilatus. 2 Sie fingen aber an, ihn zu verklagen und sprachen: Wir haben gefunden, dass dieser das Volk verführt und es davon abhalten will, dem Kaiser die Steuern zu zahlen. Er behauptet, er sei Christus, der König. 3 Da fragte ihn Pilatus und sprach: Bist du der König der Juden? Er antwortete ihm und sprach: Du sagst es! 4 Da sprach Pilatus zu den obersten Priestern und der Volksmenge: Ich finde keine Schuld an diesem Menschen! 5 Sie aber bestanden darauf und sprachen: Er wiegelt das Volk auf, indem er in ganz Judäa lehrt, angefangen in Galiläa bis hierher!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lucas+23:1-49&amp;version=SCH2000|title=Bible Gateway passage: Lukas 23:1-49 - Schlachter 2000|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


(23 Then the whole company of them arose, and brought him before Pilate. 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he  himself is Christ a king." 3 And Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he answered him, "You have said so." 4 And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, "I find no crime in this man." 5 But they were urgent, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place.")

'''S-attributed grammars''' are a class of [[attribute grammar]]s characterized by having no [[Attribute_grammar#Inherited_attributes| inherited attribute]]s, but only [[Attribute_grammar#Synthesized_attributes| synthesized attribute]]s. Inherited attributes, which must be passed down from parent nodes to children nodes of the [[abstract syntax tree]] during the [[Semantic analysis (computer science)|semantic analysis]] of the [[parsing]] process, are a problem for [[bottom-up parsing]] because in bottom-up parsing, the parent nodes of the abstract syntax tree are created ''after'' creation of all of their children. Attribute evaluation in S-attributed grammars can be incorporated conveniently in both [[top-down parsing]] and [[bottom-up parsing]].

Specifications for parser generators in the [[Yacc]] family can be broadly considered S-attributed grammars. However, these parser generators usually include the capacity to reference global variables and/or fields from within any given grammar rule, meaning that this is not a ''pure'' S-attributed approach.

Any S-attributed grammar is also an [[L-attributed grammar]].

The '''Sino-Tibetan languages''', in a few sources also known as '''Trans-Himalayan''', are a [[language family|family]] of more than 400 languages spoken in [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]]. The family is second only to [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] in terms of the number of native speakers. The Sino-Tibetan languages with the most native speakers are the [[varieties of Chinese]] (1.3 billion), [[Burmese language|Burmese]] (33 million), and the [[Tibetic languages]] (6 million), but many Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken by small communities in remote mountain areas and as such are poorly documented. Unlike Western linguists, Chinese linguists generally include [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]] and [[Hmong-Mien]] languages within Sino-Tibetan.

Several low-level subgroups have been securely reconstructed, but reconstruction of a [[proto-language]] for the family as a whole is still at an early stage, so the higher-level structure of Sino-Tibetan remains unclear.  Although the family is traditionally presented as divided into Sinitic (i.e. Chinese) and [[Tibeto-Burman]] branches, a common origin of the non-Sinitic languages has never been demonstrated.
Several [[classification schemes for Southeast Asian languages|links to other language families]] have been proposed, but none has broad acceptance.

==History==
A [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic relationship]] between Chinese, Tibetan, Burmese and other languages was first proposed in the early 19th century and is now broadly accepted. The initial focus on languages of civilizations with long literary traditions has been broadened to include less widely spoken languages, some of which have only recently, or never, been written. However, the reconstruction of the family is much less developed than for families such as [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] or [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]]. Difficulties have included the great diversity of the languages, the lack of inflection in many of them, and the effects of language contact. In addition, many of the smaller languages are spoken in mountainous areas that are difficult to access, and are often also sensitive border zones.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|pp=422, 434–436}}

=== Early work ===
During the 18th century, several scholars had noticed parallels between Tibetan and Burmese, both languages with extensive literary traditions.
Early in the following century, [[Brian Houghton Hodgson]] and others noted that many non-literary languages of the highlands of northeast India and Southeast Asia were also related to these.
The name "Tibeto-Burman" was first applied to this group in 1856 by [[James Richardson Logan]], who added [[Karen languages|Karen]] in 1858.{{sfnp|Logan|1856|p=31}}{{sfnp|Logan|1858}}
The third volume of the ''[[Linguistic Survey of India]]'', edited by [[Sten Konow]], was devoted to the Tibeto-Burman languages of [[British India]].{{sfnp|Hale|1982|p=4}}

Studies of the "Indo-Chinese" languages of Southeast Asia from the mid-19th century by Logan and others revealed that they comprised four families: Tibeto-Burman, [[Tai languages|Tai]], [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]] and [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]].
[[Julius Klaproth]] had noted in 1823 that Burmese, Tibetan and Chinese all shared common basic [[vocabulary]] but that [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Mon language|Mon]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] were quite different.{{sfnp|van Driem|2001|p=334}}{{sfnp|Klaproth|1823|pp=346, 363–365}}
[[Ernst Kuhn]] envisaged a group with two branches, Chinese-Siamese and Tibeto-Burman.{{efn|{{harvp|Kuhn|1889|p=189}}: "wir das Tibetisch-Barmanische einerseits, das Chinesisch-Siamesische anderseits als deutlich geschiedene und doch wieder verwandte Gruppen einer einheitlichen Sprachfamilie anzuerkennen haben." (also quoted in {{harvp|van Driem|2001|p=264}}.)}}
[[August Conrady]] called this group Indo-Chinese in his influential 1896 classification, though he had doubts about Karen. Conrady's terminology was widely used, but there was uncertainty regarding his exclusion of Vietnamese. [[Franz Nikolaus Finck]] in 1909 placed Karen as a third branch of Chinese-Siamese.{{sfnp|van Driem|2001|p=344}}{{sfnp|Finck|1909|p=57}}

[[Jean Przyluski]] introduced the French term ''sino-tibétain'' as the title of his chapter on the group in [[Antoine Meillet|Meillet]] and [[Marcel Cohen|Cohen]]'s ''Les langues du monde'' in 1924.{{sfnp|Przyluski|1924|p=361}}{{sfnp|Sapir|1925|p=373}} He divided them into three groups: Tibeto-Burman, Chinese and Tai,{{sfnp|Przyluski|1924|p=361}} and was uncertain about the affinity of Karen and [[Hmong–Mien]].{{sfnp|Przyluski|1924|p=380}} The English translation "Sino-Tibetan" first appeared in a short note by Przyluski and [[Gordon Luce|Luce]] in 1931.{{sfnp|Przyluski|Luce|1931}}

=== Shafer and Benedict ===
In 1935, the anthropologist [[Alfred Kroeber]] started the Sino-Tibetan Philology Project, funded by the [[Works Project Administration]] and based at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].
The project was supervised by Robert Shafer until late 1938, and then by [[Paul K. Benedict]].
Under their direction, the staff of 30 non-linguists collated all the available documentation of Sino-Tibetan languages.
The result was eight copies of a 15-volume typescript entitled ''Sino-Tibetan Linguistics''.{{sfnp|Hale|1982|p=4}}{{efn|The volumes were: 1. Introduction and bibliography, 2. Bhotish, 3. West Himalayish, 4. West Central Himalayish, 5. East Himalayish, 6. Digarish, 7. Nungish, 8. Dzorgaish, 9. Hruso, 10. Dhimalish, 11. Baric, 12. Burmish–Lolish, 13. Kachinish, 14. Kukish, 15. Mruish.{{sfnp|Miller|1974|p=195}}}}
This work was never published, but furnished the data for a series of papers by Shafer, as well as Shafer's five-volume ''Introduction to Sino-Tibetan'' and Benedict's ''Sino-Tibetan, a Conspectus''.{{sfnp|Miller|1974|pp=195–196}}

Benedict completed the manuscript of his work in 1941, but it was not published until 1972.{{sfnp|Matisoff|1991|p=473}} Instead of building the entire family tree, he set out to reconstruct a [[Proto-Tibeto-Burman language]] by comparing five major languages, with occasional comparisons with other languages.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=434}} He reconstructed a two-way distinction on initial consonants based on voicing, with aspiration conditioned by pre-initial consonants that had been retained in Tibetic but lost in many other languages.{{sfnp|Benedict|1972|pp=20–21}} Thus, Benedict reconstructed the following initials:{{sfnp|Benedict|1972|pp=17–18, 133–139, 164–171}}

Although the initial consonants of cognates tend to have the same [[place of articulation|place]] and [[manner of articulation]], voicing and aspiration is often unpredictable.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|pp=425–426}}
This irregularity was attacked by [[Roy Andrew Miller]],{{sfnp|Miller|1974|p=197}} though Benedict's supporters attribute it to the effects of prefixes that have been lost and are often unrecoverable.{{sfnp|Matisoff|2003|p=16}}
The issue remains unsolved today.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|pp=425–426}}
It was cited together with the lack of reconstructable shared morphology, and evidence that much shared lexical material has been borrowed from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] into [[Tibeto-Burman]], by [[Christopher Beckwith]], one of the few scholars still arguing that Chinese is not related to Tibeto-Burman.{{sfnp|Beckwith|1996}}{{sfnp|Beckwith|2002b}}

=== Study of literary languages ===
[[File:Manuscript from Shanghai Museum 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ancient Chinese text on [[bamboo strips]]]]
[[Old Chinese]] is by far the oldest recorded Sino-Tibetan language, with inscriptions dating from 1200 BC and a huge body of literature from the first millennium BC, but the Chinese script is not alphabetic. Scholars have sought to reconstruct the [[phonology of Old Chinese]] by comparing the obscure descriptions of the sounds of [[Middle Chinese]] in medieval dictionaries with phonetic elements in [[Chinese characters]] and the rhyming patterns of early poetry. The first complete reconstruction, the ''[[Grammata Serica Recensa]]'' of [[Bernard Karlgren]], was used by Benedict and Shafer.{{sfnp|Matisoff|1991|pp=471–472}}

Karlgren's reconstruction was somewhat unwieldy, with many sounds having a highly non-uniform distribution. Later scholars have revised it by drawing on a range of other sources.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=45}} Some proposals were based on cognates in other Sino-Tibetan languages, though workers have also found solely Chinese evidence for them.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=25–26}} For example, recent [[reconstructions of Old Chinese]] have reduced Karlgren's 15 vowels to a six-vowel system originally suggested by [[Nicholas Bodman]].{{sfnp|Bodman|1980|p=47}} Similarly, Karlgren's *l has been recast as *r, with a different initial interpreted as *l, matching Tibeto-Burman cognates, but also supported by Chinese transcriptions of foreign names.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=197, 199–202}} A growing number of scholars believe that Old Chinese did not use tones, and that the tones of Middle Chinese developed from final consonants. One of these, *-s, is believed to be a suffix, with cognates in other Sino-Tibetan languages.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=315–317}}

[[File:Turfan fragment tibt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Old Tibetan]] text found at [[Turfan]]]]
[[Tibetic languages|Tibetic]] has extensive written records from the adoption of writing by the [[Tibetan Empire]] in the mid-7th century. The earliest records of [[Burmese language|Burmese]] (such as the 12th-century [[Myazedi inscription]]) are more limited, but later an extensive literature developed. Both languages are recorded in alphabetic scripts ultimately derived from the [[Brahmi script]] of Ancient India. Most comparative work has used the conservative written forms of these languages, following the dictionaries of [[Heinrich August Jäschke|Jäschke]] (Tibetan) and [[Adoniram Judson|Judson]] (Burmese), though both contain entries from a wide range of periods.{{sfnp|Beckwith|2002a|pp=xiii–xiv}}

There are also extensive records in [[Tangut language|Tangut]], the language of the [[Western Xia]] (1038–1227). Tangut is recorded in a Chinese-inspired logographic script, whose interpretation presents many difficulties, even though multilingual dictionaries have been found.{{sfnp|Thurgood|2003|p=17}}

[[Gong Hwang-cherng]] has compared Old Chinese, Tibetic, Burmese and Tangut in an effort to establish sound correspondences between those languages.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=434}}{{sfnp|Gong|1980}} He found that Tibetic and Burmese {{IPA|/a/}} correspond to two Old Chinese vowels, *a and *ə.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=431}} While this has been considered evidence for a separate Tibeto-Burman subgroup, Hill (2014) finds that Burmese has distinct correspondences for Old Chinese rhymes ''-ay'' : *-aj and ''-i'' : *-əj, and hence argues that the development *ə &gt; *a occurred independently in Tibetan and Burmese.{{sfnp|Hill|2014|pp=97–104}}

=== Fieldwork ===
The descriptions of non-literary languages used by Shafer and Benedict were often produced by missionaries and colonial administrators of varying linguistic skill.{{sfnp|Matisoff|1991|pp=472–473}}{{sfnp|Hale|1982|pp=4–5}}
Most of the smaller Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken in inaccessible mountainous areas, many of which are politically or militarily sensitive and thus closed to investigators.
Until the 1980s, the best-studied areas were [[Nepal]] and northern [[Thailand]].{{sfnp|Matisoff|1991|pp=470, 476–478}}
In the 1980s and 1990s, new surveys were published from the Himalayas and southwestern China.
Of particular interest was the discovery of a new branch of the family, the [[Qiangic languages]] of western [[Sichuan]] and adjacent areas.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=435}}{{sfnp|Matisoff|1991|p=482}}

==Distribution==
Most of the current spread of Sino-Tibetan languages is the result of historical expansions of the three groups with the most speakers – Chinese, Burmese and Tibetic – replacing an unknown number of earlier languages.
These groups also have the longest literary traditions of the family.
The remaining languages are spoken in mountainous areas, along the southern slopes of the [[Himalayas]], the [[Southeast Asian Massif]] and the eastern edge of the [[Tibetan Plateau]].

===Contemporary languages===
{{pie chart

By far the largest group are the 1.3 billion speakers of [[varieties of Chinese]], most of whom live in the eastern half of China.
The first records of Chinese are [[oracle bone]] inscriptions from c. 1200 BC, when [[Old Chinese]] was spoken around the middle reaches of the [[Yellow River]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=4}}
Chinese has since expanded throughout China, forming a family whose diversity has been compared with the [[Romance languages]].
Diversity is greater in the rugged terrain of southeast China than in the [[North China Plain]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=187–188}}

[[Burmese language|Burmese]] is the national language of [[Myanmar]], and the first language of some 33 million people.
Burmese speakers first entered the northern [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]] basin from what is now western [[Yunnan]] in the early 9th century, when the [[Pyu city-states]] had been weakened by an invasion by [[Nanzhao]].{{sfnp|Taylor|1992|p=165}}
Other [[Burmish languages]] are still spoken in [[Dehong Prefecture]] in the far west of Yunnan.{{sfnp|Wheatley|2003|p=195}}
By the 11th century their [[Pagan Kingdom]] had expanded over the whole basin.{{sfnp|Taylor|1992|p=165}}
The oldest texts, such as the [[Myazedi inscription]], date from the early 12th century.{{sfnp|Wheatley|2003|p=195}}

The [[Tibetic languages]] are spoken by some 6 million people on the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and neighbouring areas in the [[Himalayas]] and western [[Sichuan]].{{sfnp|Tournadre|2014|p=117}}
They are descended from [[Old Tibetan]], which was originally spoken in the [[Yarlung Valley]] before it was spread by the expansion of the [[Tibetan Empire]] in the 7th century.{{sfnp|Tournadre|2014|p=107}}
Although the empire collapsed in the 9th century, [[Classical Tibetan]] remained influential as the liturgical language of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].{{sfnp|Tournadre|2014|p=120}}

The remaining languages are spoken in upland areas.
Southernmost are the [[Karen languages]], spoken by 4 million people in the hill country along the Myanmar–Thailand border, with the greatest diversity in the [[Karen Hills]], which are believed to be the homeland of the group.{{sfnp|Thurgood|2003|p=18}}
The highlands stretching from northeast India to northern Myanmar contain over 100 high-diverse Sino-Tibetan languages.
Other Sino-Tibetan languages are found along the southern slopes of the [[Himalayas]], southwest China and northern Thailand.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|pp=424–425}}

===Homeland===
There have been a range of proposals for the Sino-Tibetan [[urheimat]], reflecting the uncertainty about the classification of the family and its time depth.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=423}}
[[James Matisoff]] (1991) places it in the eastern part of the [[Tibetan plateau]] around 4000 BC, with the various groups migrating out down the [[Yellow River|Yellow]], [[Yangtze]], [[Mekong]], [[Salween river|Salween]] and [[Brahmaputra river|Brahmaputra]] rivers.{{sfnp|Matisoff|1991|pp=470–471}}
[[George van Driem]] (2005) proposes that Sino-Tibetan originated in the [[Sichuan Basin]] before 7000 BC, with an early migration into northeast India, and a later migration north of the predecessors of Chinese and Tibetic.{{sfnp|van Driem|2005|pp=91-95}} [[Roger Blench]] and Mark Post (2014) have proposed that the Sino-Tibetan homeland is [[northeast India]], the area of greatest diversity, around 7000 BC.{{sfnp|Blench|Post|2014|p=89}}
Roger Blench (2009) argues that agriculture cannot be reconstructed for Proto-Sino-Tibetan, and that the earliest speakers of Sino-Tibetan were not farmers but highly diverse foragers.&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2009. [http://rb.rowbory.co.uk/Language/Sino-Tibetan/Blench%20ICSTLL42%20Chiang%20Mai%20paper.pdf If agriculture cannot be reconstructed for Proto-Sino-Tibetan, what are the consequences?]. Paper presented at the 42nd International Conference on Sino-Tibetan Language and Linguistics (ICSTLL 42), Chiang Mai, November 2–4, 2009. ([http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Sino-Tibetan/Blench%20ST%20Chiang%20Mai%202009%20ppt.pdf slides])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==

Several low-level branches of the family, particularly [[Lolo-Burmese languages|Lolo-Burmese]], have been securely reconstructed, but in the absence of a secure reconstruction of a Sino-Tibetan [[proto-language]], the higher-level structure of the family remains unclear.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=426}}{{sfnp|DeLancey|2009|p=695}}
Thus, a conservative classification of Sino-Tibetan/Tibeto-Burman would posit several dozen small coordinate families and [[language isolate|isolates]]; attempts at subgrouping are either geographic conveniences or hypotheses for further research.

===Li (1937)===
In a survey in the 1937 ''Chinese Yearbook'', [[Li Fang-Kuei]] described the family as consisting of four branches:{{sfnp|Li|1937|pp=60–63}}{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=424}}
:Indo-Chinese (Sino-Tibetan)
:* Chinese
:* [[Tai languages|Tai]] (later expanded to [[Kam–Tai languages|Kam–Tai]])
:* [[Hmong–Mien languages|Miao–Yao]] (Hmong–Mien)
:* [[Tibeto-Burman]]

Tai and Miao–Yao were included because they shared [[isolating language|isolating]] typology, [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] systems and some vocabulary with Chinese.  At the time, tone was considered so fundamental to language that tonal typology could be used as the basis for classification. In the Western scholarly community, these languages are no longer included in Sino-Tibetan, with the similarities attributed to diffusion across the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]], especially since {{harvtxt|Benedict|1942}}.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=424}}
The exclusions of Vietnamese by Kuhn and of Tai and Miao–Yao by Benedict were vindicated in 1954 when [[André-Georges Haudricourt]] demonstrated that the tones of Vietnamese were reflexes of final consonants from [[Proto-Mon–Khmer language|Proto-Mon–Khmer]].{{sfnp|Matisoff|1991|p=487}}

Many Chinese linguists continue to follow Li's classification.{{efn|See, for example, the "Sino-Tibetan" (汉藏语系 ''Hàn-Zàng yǔxì'') entry in the "languages" (語言文字, ''Yǔyán-Wénzì'') volume of the ''[[Encyclopedia of China]]'' (1988).}}{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=424}} However, this arrangement remains problematic. For example, there is disagreement over whether to include the entire [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]] family or just [[Kam–Tai languages|Kam–Tai]] (Zhuang–Dong excludes the [[Kra languages]]), because the Chinese cognates that form the basis of the putative relationship are not found in all branches of the family and have not been reconstructed for the family as a whole. In addition, Kam–Tai itself no longer appears to be a valid node within Kra–Dai.

===Benedict (1942)===
Benedict overtly excluded Vietnamese (placing it in Mon–Khmer) as well as [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien]] and [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]] (placing them in [[Austro-Tai languages|Austro-Tai]]).
He otherwise retained the outlines of Conrady's Indo-Chinese classification, though putting [[Karen languages|Karen]] in an intermediate position:{{sfnp|Benedict|1942|p=600}}{{sfnp|Benedict|1972|pp=2–4}}

:Sino-Tibetan
:* Chinese
:* Tibeto-Karen
:** Karen
:** Tibeto-Burman

===Shafer (1955)===
Shafer criticized the division of the family into [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] and Sino-Daic branches, which he attributed to the different groups of languages studied by Konow and other scholars in [[British India]] on the one hand and by [[Henri Maspero]] and other French linguists on the other.{{sfnp|Shafer|1955|pp=94–96}}
He proposed a detailed classification, with six top-level divisions:{{sfnp|Shafer|1955|pp=99–108}}{{sfnp|Shafer|1966|p=1}}{{efn|For Shafer, the suffix "-ic" denoted a primary division of the family, whereas the suffix "-ish" denoted a sub-division of one of those.}}

:Sino-Tibetan
:* Sinitic
:* Daic
:* Bodic
:* Burmic
:* [[Bodo–Garo languages|Baric]]
:* Karenic

Shafer was sceptical of the inclusion of Daic, but after meeting Maspero in Paris decided to retain it pending a definitive resolution of the question.{{sfnp|Shafer|1955|pp=97–99}}{{sfnp|van Driem|2001|pp=343–344}}

===Matisoff (1978, 2015)===
[[James Matisoff]] abandoned Benedict's Tibeto-Karen hypothesis:

:Sino-Tibetan
:* Chinese
:* Tibeto-Burman

Some more-recent Western scholars, such as Bradley (1997) and La Polla (2003), have retained Matisoff's two primary branches, though differing in the details of Tibeto-Burman. However, Jacques (2006) notes, "comparative work has never been able to put forth evidence for common innovations to all the Tibeto-Burman languages (the Sino-Tibetan languages to the exclusion of Chinese)"{{efn|les travaux de comparatisme n’ont jamais pu mettre en évidence l’existence d’innovations communes à toutes les langues « tibéto-birmanes » (les langues sino-tibétaines à l’exclusion du chinois)}} and that "it no longer seems justified to treat Chinese as the first branching of the Sino-Tibetan family,"{{efn|il ne semble plus justifié de traiter le chinois comme le premier embranchement primaire de la famille sino-tibétaine}} because the morphological divide between Chinese and Tibeto-Burman has been bridged by recent reconstructions of [[Old Chinese]].

The internal structure of Sino-Tibetan has been tentatively revised as the following [[Stammbaum]] by [[James A. Matisoff|Matisoff]] (2015: xxxii, 1123-1127) in the final print release of the ''Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus'' (STEDT).&lt;ref name="Matisoff2015"&gt;Matisoff, James A. 2015.

Software, UC Berkeley Dash. {{doi|10.6078/D1159Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matisoff (2015: xxxi) acknowledges that the position of Chinese as either a sister branch of Tibeto-Burman or a branch within Tibeto-Burman remains an open question.

===Starostin (1996)===
Sergei Starostin proposed that both the [[Kiranti languages]] and Chinese are divergent from a "core" Tibeto-Burman of at least Bodish, Lolo-Burmese, Tamangic, Jinghpaw, Kukish, and Karen (other families were not analysed) in a hypothesis called ''Sino-Kiranti''. The proposal takes two forms: that Sinitic and Kiranti are themselves a valid node or that the two are not demonstrably close, so that Sino-Tibetan has three primary branches:

:Sino-Tibetan (version 1)
:* Sino-Kiranti
:* Tibeto-Burman

:Sino-Tibetan (version 2)
:* Chinese
:* Kiranti
:* Tibeto-Burman

===van Driem (1997, 2001)===
[[George van Driem|van Driem]], like Shafer, rejects a primary split between Chinese and the rest, suggesting that Chinese owes its traditional privileged place in Sino-Tibetan to historical, typological, and cultural, rather than linguistic, criteria. He calls the entire family "Tibeto-Burman", a name he says has historical primacy,{{sfnp|van Driem|2001|p=383}} but other linguists who reject a privileged position for Chinese nevertheless continue to call the resulting family "Sino-Tibetan", including [[Roger Blench]].

Like Matisoff, van Driem acknowledges that the relationships of the [[Kuki-Naga languages|"Kuki–Naga" languages]] ([[Kukish languages|Kuki]], [[Mizo language|Mizo]], [[Meitei language|Meitei]], etc.), both amongst each other and to the other languages of the family, remain unclear. However, rather than placing them in a geographic grouping, as Matisoff does, van Driem leaves them unclassified.
He has proposed several hypotheses, including the reclassification of Chinese to a Sino-Bodic subgroup:

:Tibeto-Burman
:* Western (Baric, Brahmaputran, or [[Sal languages|Sal]]): [[Dhimal languages|Dhimal]], [[Bodo–Garo languages|Bodo–Garo]], [[Konyak languages|Konyak]], [[Kachin–Luic languages|Kachin–Luic]]
:* Eastern
:** Northern (Sino-Bodic)
:*** Northwestern (Bodic): [[Bodish languages|Bodish]], [[Kiranti languages|Kirantic]], [[West Himalayish languages|West Himalayish]], [[Tamangic languages|Tamangic]] and several isolates
:*** Northeastern ([[Sinitic languages|Sinitic]])
:** Southern
:*** Southwestern: [[Lolo-Burmese languages|Lolo-Burmese]], [[Karen languages|Karenic]]

:*a number of other small families and isolates as primary branches ([[Newar language|Newar]], [[Nungish languages|Nungish]], [[Magaric languages|Magaric]], ''etc.'')

Van Driem points to two main pieces of evidence establishing a special relationship between Sinitic and Bodic and thus placing Chinese within the Tibeto-Burman family. First, there are a number of parallels between the morphology of [[Old Chinese]] and the modern Bodic languages. Second, there is an impressive body of lexical cognates between the Chinese and Bodic languages, represented by the Kirantic language [[Limbu language|Limbu]].{{sfnp|van Driem|1997}}

In response, Matisoff notes that the existence of shared lexical material only serves to establish an absolute relationship between two language families, not their relative relationship to one another. Although some cognate sets presented by van Driem are confined to Chinese and Bodic, many others are found in Sino-Tibetan languages generally and thus do not serve as evidence for a special relationship between Chinese and Bodic.{{sfnp|Matisoff|2000}}

===van Driem (2001, 2014)===
[[George van Driem]] (2001) has also proposed a "fallen leaves" model that lists dozens of well-established low-level groups while remaining agnostic about intermediate groupings of these.{{sfnp|van Driem|2001|p=403}}
In the most recent version (van Driem 2014), 42 groups are identified (with individual languages highlighted in ''italics''):{{sfnp|van Driem|2014|p=19}}

van Driem (2007) also suggested that the Sino-Tibetan language family be renamed "Trans-Himalayan", which he considers to be more neutral.{{sfnp|van Driem|2007|p=226}}

=== Blench and Post (2014) ===
[[Roger Blench]] and Mark W. Post have criticized the applicability of conventional Sino-Tibetan classification schemes to minor languages lacking an extensive written history (unlike Chinese, Tibetic, and Burmese). They find that the evidence for the subclassification or even ST affiliation at all of several minor languages of northeastern India, in particular, is either poor or absent altogether.
{{quote|While relatively little has been known about the languages of this region up to and including the present time, this has not stopped scholars from proposing that these languages either constitute or fall within some other Tibeto-Burman subgroup. However, in absence of any sort of systematic comparison – whether the data are thought reliable or not – such "subgroupings" are essentially vacuous. The use of pseudo-genetic labels such as "Himalayish" and "Kamarupan" inevitably give an impression of coherence which is at best misleading.|{{harvtxt|Blench|Post|2014}}, p. 3}}
In their view, many such languages would for now be best considered unclassified, or "internal isolates" within the family. They propose a provisional classification of the remaining languages:
:Sino-Tibetan
:*[[Karbi language|Karbi]] (Mikir)
:*[[Mruic languages|Mruish]]
:*(unnamed group)
:**(unnamed group)
:***[[Tani languages|Tani]]
:***Nagish: [[Ao languages|Ao]], [[Kuki-Chin languages|Kuki-Chin]], [[Tangkhul languages|Tangkhul]], [[Zeme languages|Zeme]], [[Angami–Pochuri languages|Angami–Pochuri]] and [[Meitei language|Meitei]]
:**(unnamed group)
:***Western: [[Gongduk language|Gongduk]], [['Ole language|'Ole]], [[Mahakiranti languages|Mahakiranti]], [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]], [[Magaric languages|Kham–Magaric–Chepang]], [[Tamangic languages|Tamangic]], and [[Lhokpu language|Lhokpu]]
:***[[Karen languages|Karenic]]
:***[[Sal languages|Jingpho–Konyak–Bodo]]
:***Eastern 
:****[[Tujia language|Tujia]]
:****[[Macro-Bai languages|Bai]]
:****[[Northern Qiang language|Northern Qiangic]]
:****[[Southern Qiang language|Southern Qiangic]]
:****(unnamed group)

:*****[[Lolo-Burmese languages|Lolo-Burmese]]–[[Naic languages|Naic]]
:*****[[Bodish languages|Bodish]]
:****[[Nungish languages|Nungish]]
Following that, because they propose that the three best-known branches may actually be much closer related to each other than they are to "minor" Sino-Tibetan languages, Blench and Post argue that "Sino-Tibetan" or "Tibeto-Burman" are inappropriate names for a family whose earliest divergences led to different languages altogether. They support the proposed name "Trans-Himalayan".

==Development of dialects and languages==

===Change in word structure===

The phenomenon of [[drift (linguistics)|drift]], proposed by American linguist [[Edward Sapir]], occurred in many languages and dialects in the Sino-Tibetan family. Proto-Chinese and [[Proto-Tibeto-Burman language|Proto-Tibeto-Burman]] are both [[agglutinative language]]s. The change in Proto-Chinese to Old Chinese around the [[Shang dynasty|Shang Dynasty]] could be found in the [[Classic of Poetry|Book of songs]] when the classifications of the noun, verbs, and modifier were all dependent on affixes such as *s-, *p-, *-k.{{sfnp|Wu|1987|}} After the [[Warring States period|Warring State Period]] in China, [[Old Chinese]] developed and started to use [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] as the classification of words.{{sfnp|Wang|1980|p=221}} The suffix *-s also presented in the new classification system. The characteristics of Old Chinese were maintained in most dialects of southern China.{{sfnp|Wu|2002|pp=9-10}}

The Chinese dialects of Min and Wu which were mainly spoken in southern parts of China, had similarities in pronunciation with reptiles and birds as seen in the Old Tai-Kadai language according to You Rujie's research. The prefixes used for differentiating reptiles and birds in Chinese dialects showed similar features with the Old Tai-Kadai language.{{sfnp|You|1982}} The old Tai-Kadai language was mainly used in the Xiangxi and Guizhou areas of China. You believed that these unique prefixes maintained by both the local dialects and the old Tai-Kadai language could be a product of local environmental influence.{{sfnp|Wu|2002|p=12}}

Dialects in the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman language]] area developed more conservatively; they keep the rules for pronunciation and word structure the same compared to Proto-Tibeto-Burman. The [[Tibetic languages]] are classified between [[fusional language|fusional]] and [[analytic language]]; the [[Lolo-Burmese languages]] are mostly analytic languages, and the [[Jingpho language|Jingpho languages]] are a mix of an agglutinative and fusional language.{{sfnp|Sun|1996}} The [[Bodo–Garo languages|Bodo–Garo]] and the [[Kuki-Chin–Naga languages]] possibly kept some particular characteristics of the putative Proto-Tibeto-Burman language such as agglutination and vowel prefixes. This phenomenon could be that the two language groups were separated early from the Proto-Tibeto-Burman language therefore did not undergo much development. The same happened to Sinitic, where its agglutinative property was kept even when it developed into an analytic language. [[Old Tibetan]] and the [[Qiangic languages|Qiangic]] both exhibit [[consonant cluster]]s caused by the dropping of vowel prefixes, which is believed to be the same structure Proto-Sino-Tibetan had.{{sfnp|Wu|2002|pp=10,12}}

[[Old Burmese]] and Old Tibetan dropped the vowel prefixes during the dialect acquisition, leaving only Tibeto-Burmese, Jingpho, the Bodo–Garo and Kuki-Chin–Naga languages that kept the vowel form of prefixes. The Lolo-Burmese languages and other languages from the [[Bodish-Himalayish languages|Bodish-Himalayish language]] group preferred a suffix structure which they inherited from the Tibetan-Qiangic-Lolo-Burmese group. Their similarities could be proven by example like the phonetics of the Tibetic language for "sun":  ŋi ma; [[Achang language|Achang]] for "sun":  ni&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; mɔ&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;; the Hakun language for "sun": nɔ&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt; ma&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;; and [[Naxi language|Naxi]] for "sun": ŋi&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; me&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;. These inherited suffixes were later retained in these languages and became widespread in dialects of Old Tibetan, which caused the usage of the prefix in the modern language to decrease.{{sfnp|Wu|2002|p=10}}

According to Dai Qingxia, half of the vocabulary in the Jingpho language are [[disyllabic]] as well as most of the nouns of Jingpho. This significant amount of disyllabic words came from the consonant cluster in [[monosyllabic]] words and compound words mainly found in the Proto-Tibeto-Burman language.{{sfnp|Dai|1997}} The development of the Sino-Tibetan language had been focused on solving the problem of [[phoneme]] rhyme, as well as coordinate the crucial point between monosyllabic [[morpheme]] and disyllabic word. Because the Sino-Tibetan language consists of a monosyllabic [[Root (linguistics)|root]], a prefix and suffix are needed for classifying word meaning and point of view (aspect?). The prefix *a- appeared in many Sino-Tibetan dialects to coordinate different morpheme structures. The repetition of a syllable has the same coordination effect.{{sfnp|Wu|2002|p=11}}

===Change in tone===

[[Chinese language|Chinese]] and the [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong-Mien]] and [[Kra–Dai languages]] are analytic languages that have similar grammar, pronunciation, and syllable structure. They all started with four tones, soon afterward developed into different phonological tones such as [[checked tone]] because of the [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] properties of the initial. The [[Aspirated consonant|aspiration]] of the initial and the length of the vowel in checked tone led to further tone development of dialects in these languages. Cantonese in Jiangyang area for Chinese developed eight different tones because of the length of the vowel. The aspiration property also determined the tone development of Kra-Dai, of which the tone eventually developed into sixteen types of tone.{{sfnp|Shi|1991}} Zongdi dialect of Hmong-Mien had also experienced the change in tone because of the aspiration property.{{sfnp|Wu|2002}}

== Typology ==

=== Word order ===

Except for the Chinese, [[Greater Bai languages|Bai]], [[Karenic languages|Karenic]], and [[Mruic languages|Mruic]] languages, the usual word order in Sino-Tibetan languages is [[subject–object–verb|object–verb]]. Most scholars believe this to be the original order, with Chinese, Karen and Bai having acquired [[subject–verb–object]] order due to the influence of neighbouring languages in the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]].{{sfnp|Dryer|2003|pp=43–45}}
However, Chinese and Bai differ from almost all other VO languages in the world in placing relative clauses before the nouns they modify.{{sfnp|Dryer|2003|pp=50}}

=== Morphology ===

Hodgson had in 1849 noted a dichotomy between "pronominalized" ([[Synthetic language|inflecting]]) languages, stretching across the [[Himalaya]]s from [[Himachal Pradesh]] to eastern [[Nepal]], and "non-pronominalized" ([[isolating language|isolating]]) languages. Konow (1909) explained the pronominalized languages as due to a [[Munda languages|Munda]] [[substratum]], with the idea that Indo-Chinese languages were essentially isolating as well as tonal. Maspero later attributed the putative substratum to [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]. It was not until Benedict that the inflectional systems of these languages were recognized as (partially) native to the family.
Scholars disagree over the extent to which the agreement system in the various languages can be reconstructed for the [[proto-language]].{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=430}}{{sfnp|LaPolla|2003|pp=29–32}}

In [[morphosyntactic alignment]], many Tibeto-Burman languages have [[ergative case|ergative]] and/or [[anti-ergative]] (an argument that is not an actor) case marking. However, the anti-ergative case markings can not be reconstructed at higher levels in the family and are thought to be innovations.{{sfnp|LaPolla|2003|pp=34–35}}

===Classifiers and definite marking===
{{confusing section|small=no|date=March 2018|reason=the syntax is garbled}}
There is no language originally in the Sino-Tibetan family that had [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]], but some subgroups did develop some properties of classifier,{{sfnp|Xu|1989|pp=15-23}}{{sfnp|Dai|1994|pp=166-181}} such as the [[Lolo-Burmese languages]] which had cognate nouns as classifiers.{{sfnp|Bradley|2012|pp=171-192}} [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] and [[Sinitic languages]] also developed classifiers that are used more commonly in South East Asia and are mainly used without numerals, such as in [[Rawang language|Rawang]] ''lègā tiq bok'' [book one classifier] meaning "one book", ''lègā bok'' meaning "the book"; in [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] yat&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt; ga&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; che&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt; [one classifier vehicle] meaning "one car", ga&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; che&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt; meaning "the car" (verbally).{{sfnp|Baron|1973}} Some other classifiers in Tibeto-Burman and Sinitic languages developed the same use as definite or specific marking. [[Definiteness|Definite marking]] did not appear in the Proto-Sino-Tibetan language either, but there is some use of it in [[Qiangic languages|Qiangic]] of the Tibeto-Burmese languages,{{sfnp|LaPolla|Huang|2003}} where the markings seem to evolve from [[Demonstrative|demonstratives]].{{sfnp|Thurgood|LaPolla|2017|p=46}}

==External classification==

Beyond the traditionally recognized families of Southeast Asia, a number of [[Classification schemes for Southeast Asian languages|possible broader relationships]] have been suggested.

One of these is the "[[Sino-Caucasian]]" hypothesis of [[Sergei Starostin]], which posits that the [[Yeniseian languages]] and [[North Caucasian languages]] form a [[clade]] with Sino-Tibetan. The Sino-Caucasian hypothesis has been expanded by others to "[[Dené–Caucasian languages|Dené–Caucasian]]" to include the [[Na-Dené languages]] of North America, [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and, occasionally, [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]]. [[Edward Sapir]] had commented on a connection between Na-Dené and Sino-Tibetan.{{sfnp|Shafer|1952}} A narrower binary [[Dené–Yeniseian]] family has recently been well-received, though not conclusively demonstrated.

In contrast, [[Laurent Sagart]] proposes a [[Sino-Austronesian languages|Sino-Austronesian family]] with Sino-Tibetan and [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] (including [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]] as a subbranch) as primary branches.{{sfnp|Sagart|2005}}
Stanley Starosta has extended this proposal with a further branch called "Yangzian" joining [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien]] and [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]].{{sfnp|Starosta|2005}}

The '''Spanish Wikipedia''' ({{lang-es|{{#property:P1448}}}}) is a [[Spanish-language]] edition of [[Wikipedia]], a free, online [[encyclopedia]]. It has {{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|es|N}} articles. Started in May 2001, it reached 100,000 articles on March 8, 2006 and 1,000,000 articles on May 16, 2013. It is the 9th-largest Wikipedia as measured by the number of articles and has the 4th-largest number of edits.

==History==
In February 2002, [[Larry Sanger]] wrote an e-mail stating that [[Bomis]] was considering selling advertisements. Edgar Enyedy, a user on the Spanish Wikipedia, criticized the proposal. [[Jimmy Wales]] and Sanger responded by saying that they did not immediately plan to implement advertisements,&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lih|Lih]], p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; but Enyedy began establishing a [[fork (software)|fork]]. [[Enciclopedia Libre]] was established by February 26, 2002. Enyedy persuaded most of the Spanish Wikipedians into going to the fork. By the end of 2002 over 10,000 articles were posted on the new site, and the Spanish Wikipedia was inactive for the rest of the year. [[Andrew Lih]] wrote that "for a long time it seemed that Spanish Wikipeda{{sic}} would be the unfortunate runt left from the Spanish fork."&lt;ref name=Lihp138&gt;[[Andrew Lih|Lih]], p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; The general popularity of Wikipedia attracted new users to the Spanish Wikipedia who were unfamiliar with the fork and these users came by June 2003.&lt;ref name=Lihp138/&gt; By the end of that year the Wikipedia had over 10,000 articles. The size of the Spanish Wikipedia overtook that of the fork in the northern hemisphere&lt;!--Lih's book was published in the US--&gt; fall of 2004.&lt;ref name=Lihp138/&gt;

Lih stated in 2009 that the concepts of advertising and forking were still sensitive issues for the Wikipedia community because "It took more than a year for the Spanish Wikipedia to get back on its feet again" after the fork had been initiated.&lt;ref name=Lihp138/&gt;

After the spin-off, the Spanish Wikipedia had very little activity until the upgrade to the Phase III of the software, later renamed [[MediaWiki]], when the number of new users started to increase again.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Both projects continue to co-exist, but the Spanish Wikipedia is by far the more active of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enciclopedia.us.es/index.php/Especial:Statistics |title=Enciclopedia Libre Universal: Special Stats |language=es |publisher=Enciclopedia.us.es |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="es-stats"&gt;[[:es:Estadísticas|Estadísticas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has the second largest number of users, after the [[English Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias|title=List of Wikipedias|work=wikimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is ranked eighth for number of articles, below other Wikipedias devoted to languages with smaller numbers of speakers, such as [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]]  and [[Russian language|Russian]]. In terms of quality, parameters such as article size (over 2 KB: 40%) show it as the second out of the ten largest Wikipedias after the German one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesArticlesGt1500Bytes.htm |title=Wikipedia Statistics Tables - Articles over 2Kb |publisher=Stats.wikimedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2012, Spanish Wikipedia is the fourth Wikipedia in terms of the number of edits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportPageEditsPerLanguageBreakdown.htm|title=Wikimedia Traffic Analysis Report - Page Edits Per Wikipedia Language - Breakdown|work=wikimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the third Wikipedia by the number of page views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesPageViewsMonthlyCombined.htm|title=Page Views for Wikipedia, All Platforms, Normalized|work=wikimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By country of origin, by September 2017, Spain was the main contributor to the Spanish Wikipedia (39.2% of edits). It is followed by Argentina (10.7%), Chile (8.8%), the Netherlands (8.4%), Mexico (7.0%), Venezuela (5.1%), Peru (3.5%), the United States (3.1%), Colombia (2.7%), Uruguay (1.3%) and Germany (1.1%).&lt;ref&gt;[[:meta:Edits by project and country of origin|Edits by project and country of origin as described in Meta]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the countries where Spanish is an official language, [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Mexico]], [[Spain]] and [[Venezuela]] have established local chapters of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].

=== Usage in Spain ===
Following a study by ''Netsuus'' (online market analysis enterprises) on the use of Wikipedia in Spain, it was revealed that most users consult Spanish Wikipedia (97%) compared to Wikipedias in other regional languages (2.17% for Wikipedia in [[Catalan Wikipedia|Catalan]], 0.64% in [[Galician Wikipedia|Galician]] and 0.26% in [[Basque Wikipedia|Basque]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netsuus.com/informe-breve/especial-wikipedia|title=Especial: Lenguas Oficiales en Wikipedia|publisher=Netsuus.com|accessdate=2007-07-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165043/http://www.netsuus.com/informe-breve/especial-wikipedia &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences from other Wikipedias ==
* The Spanish Wikipedia only accepts free images, and has rejected [[fair use]] since 2004, after a public vote.&lt;ref name="freeimages"&gt;[[:es:Wikipedia:Votaciones/2004/Usar sólo imágenes libres]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, it was decided to phase out the use of local image uploads and to exclusively use [[Wikimedia Commons]] for images and other media in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Wikipedia:Votaciones/2006/Cambiar políticas y reglas de uso de imágenes]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unlike the French and English Wikipedias, the Spanish Wikipedia does not have an [[Wikipedia#Arbitration Committee|Arbitration Committee]]. A local version was created in January 2007 (comprising seven members, chosen by public vote),&lt;ref name=auto/&gt; and dissolved in 2009 after another vote.&lt;ref name="arbcom-dissolved"/&gt;
* Some templates, like the navigation templates,&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Wikipedia:Plantillas de navegación]]&lt;/ref&gt; have been deprecated, being the only Wikipedia where it is forbidden to use these templates, instead relying on categories that perform the same function.
* Terminology in Spanish:
** The equivalent to the English Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Featured articles|featured articles]] and [[Wikipedia:Good articles|good articles]] are ''[[:es:Wikipedia:Artículos destacados|Wikipedia:Artículos destacados]]'' and ''[[:es:Wikipedia:Artículos buenos|Wikipedia:Artículos buenos]]'' respectively.
** Following a [[:es:Wikipedia:Votaciones/2004/Cambio al nombre de la categoría "Administrador"|vote in August 2004]], administrators in the Spanish Wikipedia took the name of ''bibliotecarios'' (''librarians'' in English). Other discarded options were ''usuarios especiales'' (''special users'') or ''basureros'' (''janitors'').

== Evaluation and criticism ==
A comparative study by the ''[[:es:Colegio Libre de Eméritos|Colegio Libre de Eméritos]]'', made by [[Manuel Arias Maldonado]] ([[University of Malaga]]) and published in 2010, compared some articles with those of the English and [[German Wikipedia]]s. It concluded that the Spanish version of Wikipedia was the least reliable of the three. It found it to be more cumbersome and imprecise than the German and English Wikipedias, stated that it often lacked reliable sources, including much unreferenced data, and found it to be too dependent on online references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colegiodeemeritos.es/docs/repositorio//es_ES//documentos/wikipedia_un_estudio_comparado_%28vf%29.pdf | author=Manuel Arias Maldonado | title=Wikipedia: un estudio comparado | page=49 | language=Spanish | accessdate=2010-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Wikimania 2009]], free-software activist [[Richard Stallman]] criticized the Spanish Wikipedia for restricting links to the [[Rebelion.org]] left-wing web site and allegedly banning users who had complained about what had happened. Participants in the Spanish Wikipedia responded that Rebelion.org is primarily a [[news aggregator]], that links to aggregators should be replaced with links to original publishers whenever possible, and that they considered the issue to be one of [[spam (electronic)|spam]].&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/a-war-of-words-over-wikipedias-spanish-version/|title=A War of Words Over Wikipedia’s Spanish Version|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-10-27 | first=Noam | last=Cohen | date=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 [[Oxford University]] study, five of the ten most disputed pages on the Spanish Wikipedia were football (soccer) clubs, including [[Club América]], [[FC Barcelona]], [[Athletic Bilbao]], [[Alianza Lima]], and [[Newell's Old Boys]].&lt;ref name=Gross&gt;Gross, Doug.

'''Stock market data systems''' communicated [[market data]]&amp;mdash;information about securities and stock trades&amp;mdash;from [[stock exchange]]s to [[stockbroker]]s and [[stock trader]]s.

==History==
The earliest stock exchanges were in France in the 12th century and in Bruges and Italy in the 13th. Presumably data about trades in those times was written down by [[scribe]]s and traveled by [[courier]]. In the early 19th century [[Reuters]] sent data by [[carrier pigeon]]s between Germany and Belgium&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.wysinfo.com/Pigeons/History_of_pigeons_doves.htm History of Pigeons]&lt;/ref&gt; In London early exchanges were located near coffee houses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.advfn.com/StockExchanges.html |title=World Stock Exchanges&amp;nbsp;— About, Companies, Profile, About, History |publisher=Advfn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may have played a part in trading.

===Chalk boards===
In the late 1860s, in New York, young men called “runners” prices between the exchange and broker’s offices, and often these prices were posted by hand on large [[chalk board]]s in the offices.&lt;ref name=tick&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stocktickercompany.com/stc/history/index.php |title=The History of the Stock Ticker (Page 1) |publisher=Stock Ticker Company |date= |accessdate=2010-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526040641/http://www.stocktickercompany.com/stc/history/index.php |archivedate=2010-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Updating a chalk board was an entry point for many traders getting into financial markets and as mentioned in the book [[Reminiscences of a Stock Operator]] those updating the boards would wear fur sleeves so they wouldn't accidentally erase prices.

The [[New York Stock Exchange]] is known as the "Big Board", perhaps because of these large chalk boards. Until recently, in some countries such chalkboards continued in use. [[Morse code]] was used in Chicago until 1967 for traders to send data to clerks called "board markers".&lt;ref&gt;

===Newspapers===
From 1797 to 1811 in the United States, the ''New York Price Current'' was first published. It was apparently the first newspaper to publish stock prices, and also showed prices of various [[commodity|commodities]].

In 1884 the [[Dow Jones]] company published the first stock market averages, and in 1889 the first issue of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' appeared. As time passed, other newspapers added market pages.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.bizjournalismhistory.org/main_frame.htm] History of Business Journalism&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' was first published in 1851, and added stock market tables at a later date.

==Electronic systems==

===Ticker tape===
{{main article|Ticker tape}}

In 1863 Edward A. Calahan of the [[American Telegraph Company]] invented a stock telegraph printing instrument which allowed data on [[stock]]s, [[bond (finance)|bond]]s, and commodities to be sent directly from exchanges to broker offices around the country. It printed the data on {{convert|0.75|in|cm}} wide paper tape wound on large reels. The sound it made while printing earned it the name "stock ticker". Other inventors improved on this device, and ultimately [[Thomas Edison]] patented a "universal stock ticker", selling over 5,000 in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=tick/&gt;

In the early 20th century [[Western Union]] acquired rights to an improved ticker which could deal with the increasing volume of stocks sold per day.&lt;ref name=tick/&gt;

At the time of the [[stock market crash]] in October, 1929, trading volumes were so high that the tickers fell behind, contributing to the panic. In the 1930s the New York Quotation Stock Ticker became widely used. A further improvement was in place in 1960.&lt;ref name=tick/&gt;

In 1923 Trans Lux Corporation delivered a [[rear projection]] system which projected the moving ticker onto a screen where all in a [[brokerage]] office could see it. It was a great success, and by 1949 there were more than 1400 stock-ticker projectors in the U.S. and another 200 in Canada. 
In 1959 they started shipping a Trans-Video system called CCTV which gave a customer a small video desk monitor where he could monitor the tickers.&lt;ref name=tlux&gt;
Trans-Lux: Biography of a Corporation, by Christine Grenz, 1982, the Trans-Lux Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1963 Ultronics introduced Lectrascan, the first wall mounted all electronic ticker display system. By 1964 there were over 1100 units in operation in stock broker offices in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Ultronic Systems Corp. Annual Report 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition, including Ultronics' Lectrscan electron wall system, led Trans-Lux to introduce the Trans-Lux Jet. Jets of air controlled lighted disks which moved on a belt on the broker's wall. Brokers ordered over 1000 units in the first six months, and by the middle of 1969 more than 3000 were in use in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref name= tlux/&gt;

===Automatic quotation boards===
A quotation board is a large vertical [[electronic display]] located in a brokerage office, which automatically gives current data on stocks chosen by the local broker. In 1929 the Teleregister Corporation installed the first such display, and by 1964 over 650 brokerage offices had them.

The information included the previous day’s closing price, opening price, high for the day, low for the day, and current price. Teleregister offered data from the New York, [[American Stock Exchange|American]], Midwest, [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange|Chicago Mercantile]], Commodity, New York Cocoa, New York coffee and sugar, [[New York Mercantile Exchange|New York Mercantile]], New York Produce, New York Cotton, and New Orleans Cotton exchanges, along with the [[Chicago Board of Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Teleregister/Teleregister.SpecialPurposeSystems.1956.102646324.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some firms had a battery of [[Switchboard operator|telephone operator]]s seated in front of a Teleregister board to supply commission houses with price and volume data. In 1962 two such batteries handled over 39,000 calls per day.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1955 Scantlin Electronics, Inc. introduced a competitive display system very similar in appearance but with digits twice the size of Teleregister’s, fitting into the same board area. It was less expensive and soon was installed in many broker offices.

==Stock market quotation systems==
In the late 1950s brokers had become accustomed to several problems doing business with their customers. To make a trade, an investor had to know the current price for the stock. The investor got this from a broker who could find it on his board. If the last trade (or the stock itself) hadn't made it to the board (or there was no board) the broker telegraphed a request for the price to that firm's "wire room" in New York. There, such requests would be forwarded to the floor of the appropriate exchange, where messengers could copy down prices at the locations where those stocks were traded, and telephone answers back to the wire room. Typical elapsed times were between 15 and 30 minutes just to inform the broker.&lt;ref name=phis&gt;

Phister, Montgomery, Quotron II: An Early Multiprogrammed Multiprocessor for the Communication of Stock Market Data, ''Annals of the History of Computing'' (1989) 11:109-126&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quotron===
Jack Scantlin of Scantlin Electronics, Inc. (SEI) developed the [[Quotron]] I system, consisting of a [[magnetic tape]] storage unit that could be sited at a brokerage and Desk Units with a keyboard and printer. The storage unit recorded the data from the ticker line. Brokers could enter the [[stock symbol]] on a desk unit. This triggered a backward search on the magnetic tape (which continued recording incoming ticker data). When a transaction was located, the price was sent to the desk unit, which printed it on a tape.

The first Quotron units were installed in 1960, and were an immediate success. By the end of 1961 brokers were leasing Quotrons in some 800 offices, serving some 2,500 desk units across the United States.&lt;ref name=phis/&gt;

===Ultronics vs. Quotron===
Quotron’s success attracted the attention of Robert S. Sinn, who observed its disadvantages: it could only give a last price. The opening price, high and low for the day, and share volume were not available. His system received the ticker transmissions from the various stock and commodity exchanges. These were then automatically interpreted by a hard wired digital computer updating a ''[[drum memory]]'' with the last sale prices and  at the same time computing and updating highs and lows and total volume for each stock. As these items were updated a data packet would be generated for transmission by AT&amp;T Dataphone at 1000 bits/second to identical magnetic drum storage devices in each major city in the United States. These slave [[drum memory]] units located in the metropolitan centers in the US could then be accessed by desk units in local stock brokerage offices again using Dataphone transmission. The desk units would set up the ticker symbol code for the desired stock by mechanical means actuating micro switches. The local control box would continuously interrogate each desk unit in sequence and send a request data packet by Dataphone to the local [[drum memory]] which would then send return data packets back to the local brokerage office. Each packet both for request and answer would contain the request stock alphabetic symbols plus a desk unit identifier. Because the desk units set up the requested stock code statically the desk unit would automatically update the stock price, volume, and highs and lows without any operator intervention because the control unit could complete the interrogation of all desk units in the office in about every one or two seconds, This is the first use of data packet transmission with the sender’s identification imbedded in the data packet in order to avoid switching- a forerunner of the internet? There was no switching in the entire system; all was done with data packets containing sender identifiers.

Sinn formed Ultronic Systems Corp. in December 1960, and was president and CEO from then until he left the company in 1970. By the fall of 1961 Ultronics had installed its first desk units (Stockmaster) in New York and Philadelphia, followed by San Francisco and Los Angeles. The Stockmaster desk units offered the user quick access and continuous monitoring of last sale, bid, ask, high, low, total volume, open, close, earnings, and dividends for each stock on the NYSE and the AMEX plus commodities from the various U.S. commodity exchanges. Ultimately Ultronics and [[General Telephone]] (which bought Ultronics in 1967) installed some 10,000 units world-wide. In June 1964 Ultronics and the British news company [[Reuters]] signed a joint venture agreement to market Stockmaster worldwide outside of North America. This venture lasted for 10 years and was very successful, capturing the worldwide market for U.S. stock and commodity price information. Ultronics invented time division multiplex equipment to utilize Reuters’ voice grade lines to Europe and the Far East to transmit U.S. stock and commodity information plus Reuters’ teletype news channels.&lt;ref&gt;
Sinn, Robert S., Reminiscences of a Stock Quotation System: The Real Story of Ultronic Systems Corporation, (Feb. 2009) http://www.inductive.com/Ultronic_Systems.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Sinn, December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s when these first desk top quotation units were developed the only real time information available from the various stock and commodity exchanges were the last sale and the bid and ask ticker lines. The last sale ticker contained every trade with both price and volume for each trade. The bid-ask ticker contained only the two prices and no size. The volume of data on the last sale ticker was therefore much greater than on the bid-ask ticker. Because of this, on high volume days the last sale ticker would run as much as fifteen minutes behind the bid-ask ticker. This time difference made having the bid-ask on their desk top unit extremely important to a stockbroker even though there was an extra charge to the exchange for this information.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Sinn, December 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:quotron.jpg|thumb|Photo of Quotron II desk unit|Quotron II Desk Unit.]]
Scantlin Electronics reacted immediately to the Ultronic threat. In early 1962 they began work on their own computer-based system and put it into service in December, 1962. It used four [[Control Data]] [[CDC 160A]] computers in New York which recorded trading data in [[magnetic core memory]]. Major cities hosted [[Headquarters|Central Office]] equipment connected to newly designed Quotron II desk units in brokerage offices on which a broker could request, for any stock, price and net change from the opening, or a summary which included highs, lows, and volumes (later SEI added other features like dividends and earnings). The requests went to a Central Office, which condensed and forwarded them to the New York computer. Replies followed the sequence in reverse. The data was transmitted on AT&amp;T's Dataphone high-speed telephone service. In 1963 the new system was accepted by many brokers, and was installed in hundreds of their offices.&lt;ref name=phis/&gt;

At the end of each day, this same system transmitted stock market pages to United Press International, which in turn sold them to its newspaper customers all over the world.

When Ultronics introduced their Stockmaster desk units in 1961 they priced the service at approximately the same price as the Quotron desk units. They did not want a price competition only a performance competition.  All of these stock quote devices were sold on leases with monthly rental charges.  The cost of the system, desk units and installation was therefore born solely by the vendor not the customer (broker). The pricing at that time made the units quite profitable and allowed the companies to finance the cost and use rapid accounting depreciation of the equipment. In 1964 Teleregister introduced their Telequote desk units at prices significantly less than Stockmaster or Quotron. This forced Ultronics and Scantlin to reduce the prices of their Stockmaster and Quotron systems. The Telequote desk units never did gain a significant share of the desk top quotation business, but their price cutting did seriously reduce the overall profitability of this business in the U.S..  Ultronics was fortunate to have made the joint venture arrangement with Reuters for the stock quotation business outside of North America where this price cutting was not a factor.&lt;ref name="Robert S. Sinn, December, 2013"&gt;Robert S. Sinn, December, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis blocked Ultronics from winning a historic first.  In July 1962 AT&amp;T launched the first commercial satellite ([[Telstar]]) to transmit television and telephone voice channels between the U.S. and England and France.  This was a non-synchronous satellite which circled the earth in an elliptical orbit of about 2.5 hours, such that it gave only about 20 minutes of communication between the U.S. and Europe on each pass.  Ultronics arranged with AT&amp;T to use one of its voice channels to transmit U.S. stock prices to Paris in October 1962.  All of the arrangements were made-a Stockmaster unit was installed in the Bache brokerage office on Rue Royale and all of the American Stockbrokers and the press and television were ready for this historic event.  About two hours before the pass the stock transmission was cancelled because U.S. president John Kennedy was going to use the pass to send his speech to France concerning the Cuban missile crisis.&lt;ref name="Robert S. Sinn, December, 2013"/&gt;

===Am-Quote===
In 1964 Teleregister introduced the Am-Quote system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Friday, May. 22, 1964 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871115,00.html |title=Electronics: Quotations by Computer |publisher=TIME |date=1964-05-22 |accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with which a broker could enter code numbers into a standard telephone; a second later a pleasant (prerecorded) voice repeated the code numbers and provided the required price information. This system, like Ultronics’, made use of magnetic drums.

===Computerized quoting===
NASDAQ, founded in 1972 was the first electronic stock market. It was originally designed only as an electronic quotation system, with no ability to perform electronic trades.&lt;ref&gt;'History of the American and NASDAQ Stock Exchanges' | https://www.loc.gov/rr/business/amex/amex.html | Retrieved December 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Other systems soon followed and by the turn of the century, every exchange was using this model.

'''Tangut''' (also '''Xīxià''' or '''Hsi-Hsia''' or '''Mi-nia''') is an ancient northeastern [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman language]]&lt;ref name="Driem2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=van Driem|first=George|title=Languages of the Himalayas, Volume One|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fiavPYCz4dYC&amp;pg=PA460|year=2001|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-12062-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; once spoken in the [[Western Xia]], also known as the Tangut Empire. It is classified by some linguists as a [[Qiangic languages|Qiangic]] language, which includes the [[Northern Qiang language|Northern]] and [[Southern Qiang language]]s and the [[Rgyalrong languages]], among others.

Tangut was one of the official languages of the Western Xia (known in Tibetan as ''Mi nyag'' and in Chinese as 彌藥 Míyào), which was founded by the [[Tangut people]] and obtained its independence from the [[Song dynasty]] at the beginning of the 11th century. The Western Xia were annihilated when [[Genghis Khan]] invaded in 1226.&lt;ref name="IDP02"&gt;{{cite journal |date=January 1995|title=IDP News Issue No. 2 |journal=IDP Newsletter |issue=2 |pages=2–3 |url= http://idp.bl.uk/downloads/newsletters/IDPNews02.pdf |accessdate=2009-07-03 |issn=1354-5914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tangut language has its own script, the [[Tangut script]].

The latest known text written in the Tangut language, the [[Tangut dharani pillars]], dates to 1502,&lt;ref name="Mote2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick W. Mote|title=Imperial China 900-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=SQWW7QgUH4gC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA257#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01212-7|pages=257–}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the language was still in use nearly three hundred years after the destruction of the Tangut Empire.

==Rediscovery ==

Modern research into the Tangut languages began in the late 19th century and early 20th century when [[Stephen Wootton Bushell|S. W. Bushell]], Gabriel Devéria, and Georges Morisse separately published decipherments of a number of Tangut characters found on [[Western Xia coinage|Western Xia coins]], in a Chinese-Tangut bilingual inscription on a stele at [[Wuwei, Gansu]], and in a copy of the Tangut translation of the [[Lotus Sutra]].

The majority of extant Tangut texts were excavated at [[Khara-Khoto]] in 1909 by [[Pyotr Kozlov]], and the script was identified as that of the Tangut state of Xixia. Such scholars as [[Aleksei Ivanovich Ivanov]], [[Ishihama Juntaro]] (石濱純太郎), [[Berthold Laufer]], [[Luo Fuchang]] (羅福萇), [[Luo Fucheng]] (羅福成), and [[Wang Jingru]] (王靜如) have contributed to research on the Tangut language. The most significant contribution was made by the Russian scholar [[Nikolai Aleksandrovich Nevsky]] (1892–1937), who compiled the first Tangut Dictionary and reconstructed the meaning of a number of Tangut grammatical particles, thus making it possible to actually read and understand Tangut texts. His scholarly achievements were published posthumously in 1960 under the title "Tangutskaya Filologiya" (Tangut Philology) and the scholar was eventually (and posthumously) awarded the Soviet [[Lenin Prize]] for his work. The understanding of the Tangut language is far from perfect: Although certain aspects of the morphology ([[Ksenia Kepping]], ''The Morphology of the Tangut Language'', Moscow: Nauka, 1985) and grammar ([[Tatsuo Nishida]], ''Seika go no kenkyū'', etc.) are understood, the syntactic structure of Tangut remains largely unexplored.

The Khara-Khoto documents are at present preserved in the [[Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. These survived the [[Siege of Leningrad]], but a number of manuscripts in the possession of Nevsky at the time of his arrest by the [[NKVD]] in 1937 went missing, and were returned, under mysterious circumstances, to the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts only in October 1991.&lt;ref name="vanDriem"&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Driem |first=George |year=1993 |title=Ancient Tangut manuscripts rediscovered |journal=  Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area|volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=137–155 |publisher= La Trobe University, Australia|issn=0731-3500 |format=PDF |url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/vandriem1993ancient.pdf |accessdate=2009-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collections amount to about 10,000 volumes, of mostly Buddhist texts, law codes and legal documents dating from mid-11th up to early 13th centuries. Among the Buddhist texts a number of unique compilations, not known either in Chinese or in Tibetan versions, were recently discovered. Furthermore, the Buddhist canon, the [[Chinese classics]], and a great number of indigenous texts written in Tangut have been preserved. These other major Tangut collections, though much smaller in size, belong to the [[British Library]], the National Library in Beijing, the Library of Beijing University and other libraries.

==Reconstruction==
{{further information|List of Tangut books}}
The connection between the writing and the pronunciation of the Tangut language is even more tenuous than that between Chinese writing and the modern [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]]. Thus although in Chinese more than 90% of the characters possess a phonetic element, this proportion is limited to about 10% in Tangut according to Sofronov. The reconstruction of Tangut pronunciation must resort to other sources.

[[Image:Fanhan heshi zhangzhongzhu.jpg|thumb|250px|Pages from the ''Fanhan heshi zhangzhongzhu'']]

The discovery of the ''[[Pearl in the Palm]]'', a Tangut-Chinese bilingual glossary, permitted Ivanov (1909) and Laufer (1916) to propose initial reconstructions and to undertake the comparative study of Tangut. This glossary in effect indicates the pronunciation of each Tangut character with one or several Chinese characters, and inversely each Chinese character with one or more Tangut characters. The second source is the corpus of Tibetan transcriptions of Tangut. These data were studied for the first time by Nevsky (Nevskij) (1925).

Nonetheless, these two sources were not in themselves sufficient for a systematic reconstruction of Tangut. In effect, these transcriptions were not written with the intention of representing with precision the pronunciation of Tangut, but instead simply to help foreigners to pronounce and memorize the words of one language with the words of another which they could understand.

The third source, which constitutes the basis of the modern reconstructions, consists of monolingual Tangut dictionaries: the ''Wenhai'' (文海), two editions of the ''Tongyin'' (同音), the ''Wenhai zalei'' (文海雜類) and an untitled dictionary. The record of the pronunciation in these dictionaries is made using the principle of  ''[[fanqie|fǎnqiè]]'', borrowed from the Chinese lexicographic tradition. Although these dictionaries may differ on small details  (e.g. the ''Tongyin'' categorizes the characters according to syllable initial and [[Syllable#Rime|rime]] without taking any account of tone), they all adopt the same system of 105 rimes. A certain number of rimes are in complementary distribution with respect to the place of articulation of the initials, e.g. rimes 10 and 11 or rimes 36 and 37, which shows that the scholars who composed these dictionaries had made a very precise phonological analysis of their language.

In distinction to the transcription in foreign languages, the Tangut ''fanqie'' makes distinctions among the rhymes in a systematic and very precise manner. Due to the ''fǎnqiè'', we now have a good understanding of the phonological categories of the language. Nonetheless, it is necessary to compare the phonological system of the dictionaries with the other sources in order to "fill in" the categories with a phonetic value.

N. A. Nevsky reconstructed Tangut grammar and provided the first Tangut–Chinese–English–Russian dictionary, which together with the collection of his papers was published posthumously in 1960 under the title ''Tangut Philology'' (Moscow: 1960). Later, substantial contribution to the research of Tangut language was done by {{nihongo|[[Tatsuo Nishida]]|西田龍雄}}, [[Ksenia Kepping]], [[Gong Hwang-cherng]] (龔煌城), M.V. Sofronov and [[Li Fanwen]] (李範文). [[Marc Miyake]] has published on Tangut phonology and diachronics.&lt;ref name="Miyake"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miyake |first=Marc |title=Complexity from Compression: A Sketch of Pre-Tangut |url=https://www.academia.edu/4154714/Complexity_from_Compression_A_Sketch_of_Pre-Tangut |accessdate=2013-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four Tangut dictionaries available: the one composed by N.A. Nevsky, one composed by Nishida (1966), one composed by Li Fanwen (1997, revised edition 2008) and one composed by [[Yevgeny Kychanov]] (2006).

There is growing a school of [[Tangut studies]] in China. Leading scholars include [[Shi Jinbo]] (史金波), Li Fanwen, Nie Hongyin (聶鴻音), Bai Bin (白濱) in mainland China, and Gong Hwang-cherng and Lin Ying-chin (林英津) in Taiwan. In other countries, leading scholars in the field include Yevgeny Kychanov and his student K. J. Solonin in Russia, Nishida Tatsuo and {{nihongo|[[Shintarō Arakawa]]|荒川慎太郎}} in Japan, and Ruth W. Dunnell in the United States.

==Phonology==
The Tangut syllable has a CV structure and carries one of two distinctive tones, flat or rising. Following the tradition of Chinese phonological analysis the Tangut syllable is divided into initial (声母) and rhyme (韻母) (i.e. the remaining syllable minus the initial).

===Consonants===
The consonants are divided into the following categories:

The rhyme books distinguish 105 rhyme classes, which are, in turn, classified in several ways:/grade (等), type (環), and class (攝).

Tangut rhymes occur in three types (環). They are seen in the tradition of Nishida, followed by both Arakawa and Gong as 'normal' (普通母音), 'tense' (緊候母音), and 'retroflex' (捲舌母音). Gong leaves normal vowels unmarked and places a dot under tense vowels and an -r after retroflex vowels. Arakawa differs only by indicating tense vowels with a final -q.

The rhyme books distinguish four vowel grades (等). In early phonetic reconstructions, all four were separately accounted for, but it has since been realized that grades three and four are in complementary distribution, depending on the initial. Consequently, the reconstructions of Arakawa and Gong do not account for this distinction. Gong represents these three grades as V, iV, and jV. Arakawa accounts for them as V, iV, and V.

In general rhyme class (攝), corresponds to the set of all rhymes under the same rhyme type which have the same main vowel.

Gong further posits phonemic vowel length and points to evidence that indicates that Tangut had a distinction that Chinese lacked. There is no certainty that the distinction was vowel length and so other researchers have remained skeptical.

Miyake reconstructs the vowels differently. In his reconstruction, the 95 vowels of Tangut formed from a six-vowel system in Pre-Tangut because of preinitial loss. (The two vowels in parentheses appeared only in loanwords from Chinese, and many of the vowels in class III were in complementary distribution with their equivalents in class IV.)

==Other definitions==

In 1940, transculturalism was originally defined by [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]], a Cuban scholar, based on the article ''Nuestra America'' (1881) by [[José Marti]]. From Marti Gra's idea, Ortiz thought that transculturalism was the key in legitimizing the [hemispheric] identity.  Thus Ortiz defined transculturalism as the synthesis of two phases occurring simultaneously, one being a deculturalization
of the past with a ''[[métissage]]'' (see [[métis]], as in the Métis population of [[Métis people (Canada)|Canada]] and the [[Métis people (United States)|United States]]) with the present, which further means the "reinventing of the new common culture".  Such reinvention of a new common culture is in turn based on the meeting and intermingling of the different peoples and cultures.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;  According to [[Lamberto Tassinari]], the director of ''Vice Versa'', a transcultural magazine in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada, transculturalism is a new form of [[humanism]] based on the idea of relinquishing the strong traditional identities and cultures which […] were [the] products of imperialistic empires [...] interspersed with dogmatic religious values. Tassinari further declared that transculturalism opposes the singular traditional cultures that evolved from the [[nation-state]].  He also stated that transculturalism is based on the breaking down of boundaries, and is contrary to [[multiculturalism]] because in the latter most experiences that have shown [reinforces] boundaries based on past cultural heritages.  And that in transculturalism the concept of culture is at the center of the nation-state or the disappearance of the nationstate itself.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt; In this context, German cultural scholar [[Dagmar Reichardt]] stresses the didactical relevance of a paradigmatic shift in academia through Transcultural Studies, mainly focusing on the European model of conviviality in a globalized world.&lt;ref&gt;Essay on "On the Theory of a Transcultural Francophony. The Concept of Wolfgang Welsch and its Didactic Interest" by Dagmar Reichardt in English:  ''Transnational 20th Century. Literatures, Arts and Cultures'', 1/1 (March 2017), p. 40-56 [http://ojs.uniroma1.it/index.php/900Transnazionale/article/view/13821/13588 &lt;nowiki&gt;[4]&lt;/nowiki&gt;], in German: ''PhiN. Philologie im Netz'', 38/2006, [http://web.fu-berlin.de/phin/phin38/p38t2.htm Online]; and in French: "Relief.

Another source of transculturalism is the work of American and Russian critical thinker [[Mikhail Epstein]], beginning in 1982, and later supported by Ellen Berry, [[Arianna Dagnino]], Slobodanka Vladiv–Glover and others. The theory of transculture is developed in Mikhail Epstein's book ''After the Future: The Paradoxes of Postmodernism and Contemporary Russian Culture'' (Amherst: The University of Massachusetts Press,  1995, 392 pp.) and especially in Mikhail Epstein's and Ellen Berry's book ''Transcultural Experiments: Russian and American Models of Creative Communication'' (New York:  Palgrave MacMillan, 1999, 340 pp.; of 23 chapters, 16 are written by M. Epstein). Within a comparative literary context, the theory of the transcultural is further developed by Dagnino in her book ''[http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/titles/format/9781557537065 Transcultural Writers and Novels in the Age of Global Mobility]'' (West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2015, 240 pp).

==Characteristics==
According to Richard Slimbach, author of ''The Transcultural Journey'', transculturalism is rooted in the pursuit to define shared interests and common values across cultural and national borders.  Slimbach further stated that transculturalism can be tested by means of thinking "outside the box of one's motherland" and by "seeing many sides of every question without abandoning conviction, and allowing for a chameleon sense of self without losing one's cultural center".&lt;ref name=FJ&gt;Slimbach, Richard. [http://www.frontiersjournal.com/documents/RSlimbachFrontiersAug05.pdf The Transcultural Journey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722035319/http://www.frontiersjournal.com/documents/RSlimbachFrontiersAug05.pdf |date=2011-07-22 }}, Essays, Asuza Pacific University, 26 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jeff Lewis (professor)|Jeff Lewis]], transculturalism is characterised by cultural fluidity and the dynamics of cultural change. Whether by conflict, necessity, revolution or the slow progress of interaction, different groups share their stories, symbols, values, meanings and experiences. This process of sharing and perpetual 'beaching' releases the solidity and stability of culture, creating the condition for transfer and transition. More than simple 'multiculturalism', which  seeks to solidify difference as ontology, 'transculturalism' acknowledges the uneven interspersion of Difference and Sameness. It allows human individuals groups to adapt and adopt new discourses, values, ideas and knowledge systems. It acknowledges that culture is always in a state of flux, and always seeking new terrains of knowing and being.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Lewis *2008) 'Cultural Studies', Sage, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Transculturalism is the mobilization of the definition of culture through the expression and deployment of new forms of cultural politics.  Based on Jeff Lewis’ From Culturalism to Transculturalism, transculturalism is charactized by the following:&lt;ref name=Iowa&gt;Lewis, Jeff. [http://www.uiowa.edu/~ijcs/issueone/lewis.htm The Cultural Dynamic] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307090143/http://www.uiowa.edu/~ijcs/issueone/lewis.htm |date=2011-03-07 }}, From Culturalism to Transculturalism&lt;/ref&gt;

*Transculturalism emphasizes on the problematics of contemporary culture in terms of relationships, [[meaning-making]], and power formation; and the transitory nature of culture as well as its power to transform.&lt;ref name=Iowa/&gt; 
*Transculturalism is interested in dissonance, tension, and instability as it is with the stabilizing effects of social conjunction, communalism, and organization; and in the destabilizing effects of non-meaning or meaning atrophy. It is interested in the disintegration of groups, cultures, and power.&lt;ref name=Iowa/&gt; 
*Transculturalism seeks to illuminate the various gradients of culture and the ways in which social groups ''create'' and ''distribute'' their meanings; and the ways in which social groups interact and experience tension.&lt;ref name=Iowa/&gt; 
*Transculturalism looks toward the ways in which language wars are historically shaped and conducted.&lt;ref name=Iowa/&gt; 
*Transculturalism does not seek to privilege the semiotic over the material conditions of life, nor vice versa.&lt;ref name=Iowa/&gt; 
*Transculturalism accepts that language and materiality continually interact within an unstable locus of specific historical conditions.&lt;ref name=Iowa/&gt; 
*Transculturalism locates relationships of power in terms of language and history.&lt;ref name=Iowa/&gt; 
*Transculturalism is deeply suspicious of itself and of all utterances. Its claim to knowledge is always redoubtable, self-reflexive, and self-critical.&lt;ref name=Iowa/&gt; 
*Transculturalism can never eschew the force of its own precepts and the dynamic that is culture.&lt;ref name=Iowa/&gt;
*Transculturalism never sides with one moral perspective over another but endeavors to examine them without ruling out moral relativism or meta-ethical confluence.

'''Wave–particle duality''' is the concept in [[quantum mechanics]]  that every [[particle]] or [[quantum]] entity may be partly described in terms not only of particles, but also of [[wave]]s. It expresses the inability of the [[classical physics|classical]] concepts "particle" or "wave" to fully describe the behavior of [[quantum-scale]] objects. As [[Albert Einstein]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Harrison | first = David | title = Complementarity and the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics | work = UPSCALE | publisher = Dept. of Physics, U. of Toronto | year = 2002  | url = http://www.upscale.utoronto.ca/GeneralInterest/Harrison/Complementarity/CompCopen.html | accessdate = 2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|It seems as though we must use sometimes the one theory and sometimes the other, while at times we may use either. We are faced with a new kind of difficulty. We have two contradictory pictures of reality; separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of light, but together they do.}}

Through the work of [[Max Planck]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Louis de Broglie]], [[Arthur Compton]], [[Niels Bohr]] and many others, current scientific theory holds that all particles exhibit a wave nature and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Quantum Mechanics: An Introduction | author = Walter Greiner | publisher = Springer | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-3-540-67458-0 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7qCMUfwoQcAC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=wave-particle+all-particles }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon has been verified not only for elementary particles, but also for compound particles like atoms and even molecules. For [[macroscopic]] particles, because of their extremely short wavelengths, wave properties usually cannot be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei, and Particles|author1=R.

Although the use of the wave-particle duality has worked well in physics, the meaning or interpretation has not been satisfactorily resolved; see [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]].

Bohr regarded the "duality [[paradox]]" as a fundamental or metaphysical fact of nature. A given kind of quantum object will exhibit sometimes wave, sometimes particle, character, in respectively different physical settings. He saw such duality as one aspect of the concept of [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]].&lt;ref name=Kumar2011&gt;{{cite book | last =Kumar | first =Manjit | title =Quantum: Einstein, Bohr, and the Great Debate about the Nature of Reality | publisher =W. W. Norton &amp; Company | edition =Reprint | year =2011 | pages =242, 375–376 | isbn =978-0393339888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bohr regarded renunciation of the cause-effect relation, or complementarity, of the space-time picture, as essential to the quantum mechanical account.&lt;ref&gt;[[Niels Bohr|Bohr, N.]] (1927/1928).

[[Werner Heisenberg]] considered the question further. He saw the duality as present for all quantic entities, but not quite in the usual quantum mechanical account considered by Bohr. He saw it in what is called [[second quantization]], which generates an entirely new concept of fields which exist in ordinary space-time, causality still being visualizable. Classical field values (e.g. the electric and magnetic field strengths of [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]) are replaced by an entirely new kind of field value, as considered in [[quantum field theory]]. Turning the reasoning around, ordinary quantum mechanics can be deduced as a specialized consequence of quantum field theory.&lt;ref&gt;Camilleri, K. (2009).

==History of wave-particle duality==

[[Democritus]],the original atomist,argued that all things in the universe, including light, are composed of indivisible sub-components (light being some form of solar atom).&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Page Stites, M.A./M.S. "Light I: Particle or Wave?," Visionlearning Vol. PHY-1 (3), 2005.
http://www.visionlearning.com/library/module_viewer.php?mid=132&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 11th Century, the Arabic scientist [[Ibn al-Haytham]] wrote the first comprehensive ''[[Book of optics]]'' describing refraction, reflection, and the operation of a pinhole lens via rays of light traveling from the point of emission to the eye. He asserted that these rays were composed of particles of light. In 1630, [[René Descartes]] popularized and accredited the opposing wave description in his treatise on light, ''[[The World (Descartes)]]'', showing that the behavior of light could be re-created by modeling wave-like disturbances in a universal medium i.e. [[luminiferous aether]]. Beginning in 1670 and progressing over three decades, [[Isaac Newton]] developed and championed his [[corpuscular theory]], arguing that the perfectly straight lines of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] demonstrated light's particle nature; only particles could travel in such straight lines. He explained [[refraction]] by positing that particles of light accelerated laterally upon entering a denser medium. Around the same time, Newton's contemporaries [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]]—and later [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] mathematically refined the wave viewpoint, showing that if light traveled at different speeds in different media (such as water and air), [[refraction]] could be easily explained as the medium-dependent propagation of light waves. The resulting [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]] was extremely successful at reproducing light's behavior and was subsequently supported by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s 1801 discovery of interference by his [[double-slit experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Young| first=Thomas| title=Bakerian Lecture:  Experiments and calculations relative to physical optics|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|year=1804|volume=94|pages = 1–16 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7AZGAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|bibcode = 1804RSPT...94....1Y| doi=10.1098/rstl.1804.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/youngdoubleslit.html Thomas Young: The Double Slit Experiment]&lt;/ref&gt; The wave view did not immediately displace the ray and particle view, but began to dominate scientific thinking about light in the mid 19th century, since it could explain polarization phenomena that the alternatives could not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Buchwald | first=Jed | year=1989 | publication-date=1989 | title=The Rise of the Wave Theory of Light: Optical Theory and Experiment in the Early Nineteenth Century | edition= | place= | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn=978-0-226-07886-1 | oclc=18069573  | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Clerk Maxwell]] discovered that he could apply his previously discovered [[Maxwell's equations]], along with a slight modification to describe self-propagating waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. It quickly became apparent that visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared light were all electromagnetic waves of differing frequency. The wave theory had prevailed or at least it seemed to. While the 19th century had seen the success of the wave theory at describing light, it had also witnessed the rise of the [[atomic theory]] at describing matter.

At the close of the 19th century, the reductionism of atomic theory began to advance into the atom itself determining, through physics, the nature of the atom and the operation of chemical reactions. Electricity, first thought to be a fluid, was now understood to consist of particles called [[electron]]s. This was first demonstrated by [[J. J. Thomson]] in 1897 when, using a [[cathode ray tube]], he found that an electrical charge would travel across a vacuum. Since the vacuum offered no medium for an electric fluid to travel, this discovery could only be explained via a particle carrying a negative charge and moving through the vacuum. This electron flew in the face of classical electrodynamics, which had successfully treated electricity as a fluid for many years (leading to the invention of [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[electric motor]]s, [[dynamo]]s, and [[arc lamp]]s). More importantly, the intimate relation between electric charge and electromagnetism had been well documented following the discoveries of [[Michael Faraday]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Since electromagnetism was known to be a wave generated by a changing electric or magnetic field (a continuous, wave-like entity itself) an atomic/particle description of electricity and charge was a [[non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]]. Furthermore, classical electrodynamics was not the only classical theory rendered incomplete.

===Black Body Radiation and Planck's law===
{{main|Black Body Radiation}}
In 1901, [[Max Planck]] published an analysis that succeeded in reproducing the observed [[spectrum]] of light emitted by a glowing object. To accomplish this, Planck had to make an ad hoc mathematical assumption of quantized energy of the oscillators (atoms of the [[black body]]) that emit radiation. Einstein later proposed that electromagnetic radiation itself is quantized, not the energy of radiating atoms.

[[Black-body radiation]], the emission of electromagnetic energy due to an object's heat, could not be explained from classical arguments alone. The [[equipartition theorem]] of classical mechanics, the basis of all classical thermodynamic theories, stated that an object's energy is partitioned equally among the object's vibrational [[Normal mode|modes]]. But applying the same reasoning to the electromagnetic emission of such a thermal object was not so successful. That thermal objects emit light had been long known. Since light was known to be waves of electromagnetism, physicists hoped to describe this emission via classical laws. This became known as the [[black body]] problem. Since the equipartition theorem worked so well in describing the vibrational modes of the thermal object itself, it was natural to assume that it would perform equally well in describing the radiative emission of such objects. But a problem quickly arose if each mode received an equal partition of energy, the short wavelength modes would consume all the energy. This became clear when plotting the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]] which, while correctly predicting the intensity of long wavelength emissions, predicted infinite total energy as the intensity diverges to infinity for short wavelengths. This became known as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].

In 1900, [[Max Planck]] hypothesized that the frequency of light emitted by the black body depended on the frequency of the oscillator that emitted it, and the energy of these oscillators increased linearly with frequency (according E = hν where h is Planck's constant). This was not an unsound proposal considering that macroscopic oscillators operate similarly when studying five [[simple harmonic oscillator]]s of equal amplitude but different frequency, the oscillator with the highest frequency possesses the highest energy (though this relationship is not linear like Planck's). By demanding that high-frequency light must be emitted by an oscillator of equal frequency, and further requiring that this oscillator occupy higher energy than one of a lesser frequency, Planck avoided any catastrophe; giving an equal partition to high-frequency oscillators produced successively fewer oscillators and less emitted light. And as in the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]], the low-frequency, low-energy oscillators were suppressed by the onslaught of thermal jiggling from higher energy oscillators, which necessarily increased their energy and frequency.

The most revolutionary aspect of Planck's treatment of the black body is that it inherently relies on an integer number of oscillators in [[thermal equilibrium]] with the electromagnetic field. These oscillators ''give'' their entire energy to the electromagnetic field, creating a quantum of light, as often as they are ''excited'' by the electromagnetic field, absorbing a quantum of light and beginning to oscillate at the corresponding frequency. Planck had intentionally created an atomic theory of the black body, but had unintentionally generated an atomic theory of light, where the black body never generates quanta of light at a given frequency with an energy less than '''hν'''. However, once realizing that he had quantized the electromagnetic field, he denounced particles of light as a limitation of his approximation, not a property of reality.

===Photoelectric effect===
{{Main|Photoelectric effect}}

[[File:Photoelectric effect.svg|290 px|'290'px|The photoelectric effect.Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate (bottom), and eject electrons, depicted as flying off to the right.]]

While Planck had solved the ultraviolet catastrophe by using atoms and a quantized electromagnetic field, most contemporary physicists agreed that Planck's "light quanta" represented only flaws in his model. A more-complete derivation of black body radiation would yield a fully continuous and 'wave-like' electromagnetic field with no quantization. However, in 1905 [[Albert Einstein]] took Planck's black body model to produce his solution to another outstanding problem of the day: the [[photoelectric effect]], wherein electrons are emitted from atoms when they absorb energy from light. Since their existence was theorized eight years previously, phenomenon had been studied with the electron model in mind in physics laboratories worldwide.

In 1902 [[Philipp Lenard]] discovered that the energy of these ejected electrons did ''not'' depend on the intensity of the incoming light, but instead on its ''frequency''. So if one shines a little low-frequency light upon a metal, a few low energy electrons are ejected. If one now shines a very intense beam of low-frequency light upon the same metal, a whole slew of electrons are ejected; however they possess the same low energy, there are merely ''more of them''.  The more light there is, the more electrons are ejected. Whereas in order to get high energy electrons, one must illuminate the metal with high-frequency light. Like blackbody radiation, this was at odds with a theory invoking continuous transfer of energy between radiation and matter. However, it can still be explained using a fully classical description of light, as long as matter is quantum mechanical in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Willis E.|last = Lamb|author-link = Willis Lamb|last2 = Scully|first2 = Marlan O.|title = The photoelectric effect without photons|url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19680009569_1968009569.pdf|year = 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one used Planck's energy quanta, and demanded that electromagnetic radiation at a given frequency could only transfer energy to matter in integer multiples of an energy quantum '''hν''', then the photoelectric effect could be explained very simply. Low-frequency light only ejects low-energy electrons because each electron is excited by the absorption of a single photon. Increasing the intensity of the low-frequency light (increasing the number of photons) only increases the number of excited electrons, not their energy, because the energy of each photon remains low. Only by increasing the frequency of the light, and thus increasing the energy of the photons, can one eject electrons with higher energy. Thus, using Planck's constant ''h'' to determine the energy of the photons based upon their frequency, the energy of ejected electrons should also increase linearly with frequency; the gradient of the line being Planck's constant. These results were not confirmed until 1915, when [[Robert Andrews Millikan]], who had previously determined the charge of the electron, produced experimental results in perfect accord with Einstein's predictions. In fact, Millikan experimented for full ten years from 1906-1916 aimed at disproving Einstein's photoelectric equation.However the value of Planck's constant determined from his experiments came out to be very close to the original value. Thus, the he established the validity of Einstein's photoelectric equation instead of disproving it. 

While energy of ejected electrons reflected Planck's constant, the existence of photons was not explicitly proven until the discovery of the [[photon antibunching]] effect, of which a modern experiment can be performed in undergraduate-level labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1119/1.1737397 | volume=72 | issue=9 | title=Observing the quantum behavior of light in an undergraduate laboratory | journal=American Journal of Physics | pages=1210|bibcode = 2004AmJPh..72.1210T | last1=Thorn | first1=J.

E. | last6=Beck | first6=M. | year=2004 | url=https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/psc_facpub/797 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon could only be explained via photons, and not through any semi-classical theory (which could alternatively explain the photoelectric effect). When Einstein received his [[Nobel Prize]] in 1921, it was not for his more difficult and mathematically laborious [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], but for the simple, yet totally revolutionary, suggestion of quantized light. Einstein's "light quanta" would not be called [[photon]]s until 1925, but even in 1905 they represented the quintessential example of wave-particle duality. Electromagnetic radiation propagates following linear wave equations, but can only be emitted or absorbed as discrete elements, thus acting as a wave and a particle simultaneously.

====Einstein's explanation of photoelectric effect using the concept of photons====

In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] provided an explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]], a hitherto troubling experiment that the wave theory of light seemed incapable of explaining. He did so by postulating the existence of [[photon]]s, [[quantum|quanta]] of light energy with particulate qualities.

In the [[photoelectric effect]], it was observed that shining a light on certain metals would lead to an [[electric current]] in a [[electrical network|circuit]]. Presumably, the light was knocking electrons out of the metal, causing current to flow. However, using the case of potassium as an example, it was also observed that while a dim blue light was enough to cause a current, even the strongest, brightest red light available with the technology of the time caused no current at all. According to the classical theory of light and matter, the strength or [[amplitude]] of a light wave was in proportion to its brightness: a bright light should have been easily strong enough to create a large current. Yet, oddly, this was not so.

Einstein explained this enigma by [[axiom|postulating]] that the electrons can receive energy from electromagnetic field only in discrete portions (quanta that were called [[photon]]s): an amount of [[energy]] ''E'' that was related to the [[frequency]] ''f'' of the light by

:&lt;math&gt;E = h f\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] (6.626 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; J seconds). Only photons of a high enough frequency (above a certain ''threshold'' value) could knock an electron free. For example, photons of blue light had sufficient energy to free an electron from the metal, but photons of red light did not. One photon of light above the threshold frequency could release only one electron; the higher the frequency of a photon, the higher the kinetic energy of the emitted electron, but no amount of light (using technology available at the time) below the threshold frequency could release an electron. To "violate" this law would require extremely high-intensity lasers which had not yet been invented. Intensity-dependent phenomena have now been studied in detail with such lasers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0375-9601(96)00259-9|title=Intensity dependence of the photoelectric effect induced by a circularly polarized laser beam|year=1996|last1=Zhang|first1=Q|journal=Physics Letters A|volume=216|issue=1–5|pages=125–128|bibcode = 1996PhLA..216..125Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1921 for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.

===de Broglie's hypothesis of wave-particle duality===
{{Main|Matter wave}}

[[File:Propagation of a de broglie wave.svg|290px|"290px"|right|thumb|Propagation of [[matter wave|de Broglie waves]] in 1d—real part of the [[complex number|complex]] amplitude is blue, imaginary part is green. The probability (shown as the colour [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of finding the particle at a given point ''x'' is spread out like a waveform; there is no definite position of the particle. As the amplitude increases above zero the [[curvature]] decreases, so the amplitude decreases again, and vice versa—the result is an alternating amplitude: a wave. Top: [[Plane wave]]. Bottom: [[Wave packet]].]]

In 1924, [[Louis-Victor de Broglie]] formulated the [[Matter wave|de Broglie hypothesis]], claiming that ''all'' matter,&lt;ref&gt;Donald H Menzel, "''Fundamental formulas of Physics''", volume 1, page 153; Gives the de Broglie wavelengths for composite particles such as protons and neutrons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Greene]], [[The Elegant Universe]], page 104 "all matter has a wave-like character"&lt;/ref&gt; not just light, has a wave-like nature; he related [[wavelength]] (denoted as ''[[λ]]''), and [[momentum]] (denoted as ''p''):

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{h}{p}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a generalization of Einstein's equation above, since the momentum of a photon is given by ''p'' = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{E}{c}&lt;/math&gt; and the wavelength (in a vacuum) by ''λ'' = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{c}{f}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum.

De Broglie's formula was confirmed three years later for [[electron]]s (which differ from photons in having a [[rest mass]]) with the observation of [[electron diffraction]] in two independent experiments. At the [[University of Aberdeen]], [[George Paget Thomson]] passed a beam of electrons through a thin metal film and observed the predicted interference patterns. At [[Bell Labs]], [[Clinton Joseph Davisson]] and [[Lester Halbert Germer]] [[Davisson-Germer experiment|guided their beam through a crystalline grid.]]

De Broglie was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1929 for his hypothesis. Thomson and Davisson shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1937 for their experimental work.

===Heisenberg's uncertainty principle===
{{Main|Heisenberg uncertainty principle}}

In his work on formulating quantum mechanics, [[Werner Heisenberg]] postulated his [[uncertainty principle]], which states:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x \, \Delta p \ge \tfrac{1}{2}\hbar &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; here indicates [[standard deviation]], a measure of spread or uncertainty;
:'''x''' and '''p''' are a particle's position and [[linear momentum]] respectively.
:''&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[Planck constant|reduced Planck's constant]] (Planck's constant divided by 2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;).

Heisenberg originally explained this as a consequence of the process of measuring: Measuring position accurately would disturb momentum and vice versa, offering an example (the "gamma-ray microscope") that depended crucially on the [[de Broglie hypothesis]]. The thought is now, however, that this only partly explains the phenomenon, but that the uncertainty also exists in the particle itself, even before the measurement is made.

In fact, the modern explanation of the uncertainty principle, extending the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] first put forward by [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], depends even more centrally on the wave nature of a particle: Just as it is nonsensical to discuss the precise location of a wave on a string, particles do not have perfectly precise positions; likewise, just as it is nonsensical to discuss the wavelength of a "pulse" wave traveling down a string, particles do not have perfectly precise momenta (which corresponds to the inverse of wavelength). Moreover, when position is relatively well defined, the wave is pulse-like and has a very ill-defined wavelength (and thus momentum). And conversely, when momentum (and thus wavelength) is relatively well defined, the wave looks long and sinusoidal, and therefore it has a very ill-defined position.

===de Broglie–Bohm theory===
{{main|de Broglie–Bohm theory}}
[[File:ExperimentCouder-Young.png|thumbnail|220px|Couder experiments,&lt;ref name="droplets"/&gt; "materializing" the ''pilot wave'' model.]]
De Broglie himself had proposed a [[pilot wave]] construct to explain the observed wave-particle duality. In this view, each particle has a well-defined position and momentum, but is guided by a wave function derived from [[Schrödinger's equation]]. The pilot wave theory was initially rejected because it generated non-local effects when applied to systems involving more than one particle. Non-locality, however, soon became established as an integral feature of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] (see [[EPR paradox]]), and [[David Bohm]] extended de Broglie's model to explicitly include it.

In the resulting representation, also called the [[de Broglie–Bohm theory]] or Bohmian mechanics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/ Bohmian Mechanics], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.''&lt;/ref&gt; the wave-particle duality vanishes, and explains the wave behaviour as a scattering with wave appearance, because the particle's motion is subject to a guiding equation or [[quantum potential]].  ''"This idea seems to me so natural and simple, to resolve the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and ordinary way, that it is a great mystery to me that it was so generally ignored"'',&lt;ref name="bell87"&gt;[[John Stewart Bell|Bell, J. S.]], "Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics", Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Stewart Bell|J.S.Bell]].

The best illustration of the ''pilot-wave model'' was given by Couder's 2010 "walking droplets" experiments,&lt;ref&gt;Y. Couder, A. Boudaoud, S. Protière, Julien Moukhtar, E. Fort: ''Walking droplets: a form of wave-particle duality at macroscopic level?'', {{doi|10.1051/epn/2010101}}, ([http://www.df.uba.ar/users/dasso/fis4_2do_cuat_2010/walker.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating the pilot-wave behaviour in a macroscopic mechanical analog.&lt;ref name="droplets"&gt;See this Science Channel production (Season II, Episode VI "How Does The Universe Work?"), presented by Morgan Freeman, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9yWv5dqSKk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wave behavior of large objects==

Since the demonstrations of wave-like properties in [[photon]]s and [[electron]]s, similar experiments have been conducted with [[neutron]]s and [[proton]]s. Among the most famous experiments are those of [[Estermann]] and [[Otto Stern]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Estermann

Authors of similar recent experiments with atoms and molecules, described below, claim that these larger particles also act like waves.

A dramatic series of experiments emphasizing the action of [[gravity]] in relation to wave–particle duality was conducted in the 1970s using the [[neutron interferometer]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Colella, A. W. Overhauser and S. A. Werner, Observation of Gravitationally Induced Quantum Interference, ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' '''34''', 1472–1474 (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; Neutrons, one of the components of the [[atomic nucleus]], provide much of the mass of a nucleus and thus of ordinary matter. In the neutron interferometer, they act as quantum-mechanical waves directly subject to the force of gravity. While the results were not surprising since gravity was known to act on everything, including light (see [[tests of general relativity]] and the [[Pound–Rebka experiment|Pound–Rebka falling photon experiment]]), the self-interference of the quantum mechanical wave of a massive fermion in a gravitational field had never been experimentally confirmed before.

In 1999, the diffraction of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; [[fullerene]]s by researchers from the [[University of Vienna]] was reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Markus | last = Arndt |author2=O.

The [[Matter wave|de Broglie wavelength]] of the incident beam was about 2.5&amp;nbsp;[[picometre|pm]], whereas the diameter of the molecule is about 1&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]], about 400 times larger. In 2012, these far-field diffraction experiments could be extended to phthalocyanine molecules and their heavier derivatives, which are composed of 58 and 114 atoms respectively. In these experiments the build-up of such interference patterns could be recorded in real time and with single molecule sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Nano-20120325"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Juffmann, Thomas|title=Real-time single-molecule imaging of quantum interference |journal=Nature Nanotechnology |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=297–300 |url=http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nnano.2012.34.html |date=25 March 2012 |accessdate=27 March 2012 |display-authors=etal|doi=10.1038/nnano.2012.34 |pmid=22447163 |arxiv=1402.1867 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quantumnanovienna|title=Single molecules in a quantum interference movie|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCiOMQIRU7I|accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance in modern quantum mechanics==

Wave–particle duality is deeply embedded into the foundations of [[quantum mechanics]]. In the [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] of the theory, all the information about a particle is encoded in its [[wave function]], a complex-valued function roughly analogous to the amplitude of a wave at each point in space. This function evolves according to [[Schrödinger equation]]. For particles with mass this equation has solutions that follow the form of the wave equation. Propagation of such waves leads to wave-like phenomena such as interference and diffraction. Particles without mass, like photons, have no solutions of the Schrödinger equation so have another wave.

The particle-like behavior is most evident due to phenomena associated with [[measurement in quantum mechanics]]. Upon measuring the location of the particle, the particle will be forced into a more localized state as given by the uncertainty principle. When viewed through this formalism, the measurement of the wave function will randomly lead to [[wave function collapse]], or rather [[quantum decoherence]], to a sharply peaked function at some location. For particles with mass the likelihood of detecting the particle at any particular location is equal to the squared amplitude of the wave function there. The measurement will return a well-defined position,and subject to [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]]. It is important to note that a measurement is only a particular type of interaction where some data is recorded and the measured quantity is forced into a particular [[quantum state]]. The act of measurement is therefore not fundamentally different from any other interaction.

Following the development of [[quantum field theory]] the ambiguity disappeared. The field permits solutions that follow the wave equation, which are referred to as the wave functions. The term particle is used to label the irreducible representations of the [[Lorentz group]] that are permitted by the field. An interaction as in a [[Feynman diagram]] is accepted as a calculationally convenient approximation where the outgoing legs are known to be simplifications of the propagation and the internal lines are for some order in an expansion of the field interaction. Since the field is non-local and quantized, the phenomena which previously were thought of as paradoxes are explained. Within the limits of the wave-particle duality the quantum field theory gives the same results.

===Visualization===
There are two ways to visualize the wave-particle behaviour: by the "standard model", described below; and by the [[#de Broglie–Bohm theory|Broglie–Bohm model]], where no duality is perceived.

Below is an illustration of wave–particle duality as it relates to De Broglie's hypothesis and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (above), in terms of the [[position and momentum space]] [[wavefunction]]s for one spinless particle with mass in one dimension. These wavefunctions are [[Fourier transform]]s of each other.

The more localized the position-space wavefunction, the more likely the particle is to be found with the position coordinates in that region, and correspondingly the momentum-space wavefunction is less localized so the possible momentum components the particle could have are more widespread.

Conversely the more localized the momentum-space wavefunction, the more likely the particle is to be found with those values of momentum components in that region, and correspondingly the less localized the position-space wavefunction, so the position coordinates the particle could occupy are more widespread.

==Alternative views==

Wave–particle duality is an ongoing conundrum in modern physics.  Most physicists accept wave-particle duality as the best explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena; however, it is not without controversy.  Alternative views are also presented here.  These views are not generally accepted by mainstream physics, but serve as a basis for valuable discussion within the community.

===Both-particle-and-wave view===

The [[pilot wave]] model, originally developed by [[Louis de Broglie]] and further developed by [[David Bohm]] into the [[hidden variable theory]] proposes that there is no duality, but rather a system exhibits both particle properties and wave properties simultaneously, and particles are guided, in a [[determinism|deterministic]] fashion, by the pilot wave (or its "[[quantum potential]]") which will direct them to areas of [[constructive interference]] in preference to areas of [[destructive interference]]. This idea is held by a significant minority within the physics community.&lt;ref&gt;(Buchanan pp. 29–31)&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one physicist considers the "wave-duality" as not being an incomprehensible mystery. L.E. Ballentine, ''Quantum Mechanics, A Modern Development'', p.&amp;nbsp;4, explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When first discovered, particle diffraction was a source of great puzzlement. Are "particles" really "waves?" In the early experiments, the diffraction patterns were detected holistically by means of a photographic plate, which could not detect individual particles. As a result, the notion grew that particle and wave properties were mutually incompatible, or complementary, in the sense that different measurement apparatuses would be required to observe them. That idea, however, was only an unfortunate generalization from a technological limitation. Today it is possible to detect the arrival of individual electrons, and to see the diffraction pattern emerge as a statistical pattern made up of many small spots (Tonomura et al., 1989). Evidently, quantum particles are indeed particles, but whose behaviour is very different from classical physics would have us to expect. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Afshar experiment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Afshar | first1 = S.S. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2007 | title = Paradox in Wave Particle Duality | arxiv=quant-ph/0702188 | journal = Found.

=== Wave-only view ===
[[Carver Mead]], an American scientist and professor at Caltech, proposes that the duality can be replaced by a "wave-only" view. In his book ''Collective Electrodynamics: Quantum Foundations of Electromagnetism'' (2000), Mead purports to analyze the behavior of [[electron]]s and [[photon]]s purely in terms of electron wave functions, and attributes the apparent particle-like behavior to quantization effects and eigenstates. According to reviewer David Haddon:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Recovering Rational Science | author = David Haddon | work = Touchstone | accessdate = 2007-09-12 | url = http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=16-07-044-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mead has cut the [[Gordian knot]] of quantum complementarity. He claims that atoms, with their neutrons, protons, and electrons, are not particles at all but pure waves of matter. Mead cites as the gross evidence of the exclusively wave nature of both light and matter the discovery between 1933 and 1996 of ten examples of pure wave phenomena, including the ubiquitous laser of [[CD player]]s, the self-propagating electrical currents of [[superconductor]]s, and the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] of atoms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Albert Einstein]], who, in his search for a [[Unified Field Theory]], did not accept wave-particle duality, wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Arthur Schilpp]], ed, ''Albert Einstein:  Philosopher-Scientist'', Open Court (1949), {{ISBN|0-87548-133-7}}, p 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This double nature of radiation (and of material corpuscles) ... has been interpreted by quantum-mechanics in an ingenious and amazingly successful fashion. This interpretation ... appears to me as only a temporary way out...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[many-worlds interpretation]] (MWI) is sometimes presented as a waves-only theory, including by its originator, [[Hugh Everett]] who referred to MWI as "the wave interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;See section VI(e) of Everett's thesis: ''The Theory of the Universal Wave Function'', in [[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]], [[R. Neill Graham]], eds, ''The Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics'', Princeton Series in Physics, [[Princeton University Press]] (1973), {{ISBN|0-691-08131-X}}, pp 3–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''{{visible anchor|three wave hypothesis}}'' of R. Horodecki relates the particle to wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Horodecki |first=R. |title=De broglie wave and its dual wave |journal=Phys. Lett. A |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=95–97 |year=1981 |doi=10.1016/0375-9601(81)90571-5 |bibcode = 1981PhLA...87...95H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Horodecki |first=R. |title=Superluminal singular dual wave |journal=Lettere al Nuovo Cimento |volume=38 |issue= |pages=509–511 |year=1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis implies that a massive particle is an intrinsically spatially, as well as temporally extended, wave phenomenon by a nonlinear law.

The ''{{visible anchor|deterministic collapse theory}}''&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Jabs, "A conjecture concerning determinism, reduction, and measurement in quantum mechanics", Quantum Studies: Mathematics and Foundations, '''3''' (4), 279-292 (2016) also arXiv:1204.0614 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; considers collapse and measurement as two independent physical processes. Collapse occurs when two wavepackets spatially overlap and satisfy a mathemetical criterion, which depends on the parameters of both wavepackets. It is a contraction to the overlap volume. In a measurement apparatus one of the two wavepackets is one of the atomic clusters, which constitute the apparatus, and the wavepackets collapse to at most the volume of such a cluster. This mimics the action of a point particle.

===Particle-only view===

Still in the days of the [[old quantum theory]], a pre-quantum-mechanical version of wave–particle duality was pioneered by [[William Duane (physicist)|William Duane]],&lt;ref&gt;[[William Duane (physicist)|Duane, W.]] (1923). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1085314/pdf/pnas01878-0020.pdf The transfer in quanta of radiation momentum to matter, ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' '''9'''(5): 158–164].&lt;/ref&gt; and developed by others including [[Alfred Landé]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Landé|Landé, A.]] (1951). [https://openlibrary.org/books/OL23825865M/Quantum_mechanics ''Quantum Mechanics''], Sir Isaac Pitman and Sons, London, pp. 19–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Duane explained diffraction of [[x-rays]] by a crystal in terms solely of their particle aspect. The deflection of the trajectory of each diffracted photon was explained as due to [[Duane's hypothesis|quantized momentum transfer]] from the spatially regular structure of the diffracting crystal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930). [http://philpapers.org/rec/HEITPP ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory''], translated by C. Eckart and F.C. Hoyt, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neither-wave-nor-particle view===

It has been argued that there are never exact particles or waves, but only some compromise or intermediate between them. For this reason, in 1928 [[Arthur Eddington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Nature of the Physical World|last = Eddington|first = Arthur Stanley|publisher = MacMillan|year = 1928|isbn = |location = Cambridge, UK.|pages = 201|url = https://archive.org/details/natureofphysical00eddi}}&lt;/ref&gt; coined the name "''wavicle''" to describe the objects although it is not regularly used today. One consideration
is that zero-dimensional [[point (geometry)|mathematical points]] cannot be observed. Another is that the formal representation of such points, the [[Dirac delta function]] is unphysical, because it cannot be [[Normalisable wave function|normalized]]. Parallel arguments apply to pure wave states.  [[Roger Penrose]] states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe |first=Roger |last=Penrose |authorlink=Roger Penrose |publisher=Vintage |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-679-77631-4 |page=521, §21.10|title-link=The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Such 'position states' are idealized wavefunctions in the opposite sense from the momentum states. Whereas the momentum states are infinitely spread out, the position states are infinitely concentrated. Neither is normalizable [...]."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Relational approach to wave–particle duality===
[[Relational quantum mechanics]] has been developed as a point of view that regards the event of particle detection as having established a relationship between the quantized field and the detector. The inherent ambiguity associated with applying Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is consequently avoided; hence there is no wave-particle duality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quantum-relativity.org/Quantum-Relativity.pdf. See Q. Zheng and T. Kobayashi, ''Quantum Optics as a Relativistic Theory of Light''; Physics Essays 9 (1996) 447. Annual Report, Department of Physics, School of Science, University of Tokyo (1992) 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

]] --&gt;
Although it is difficult to draw a line separating wave–particle duality from the rest of quantum mechanics, it is nevertheless possible to list some applications of this basic idea.

* Wave–particle duality is exploited in [[electron microscopy]], where the small wavelengths associated with the electron can be used to view objects much smaller than what is visible using visible light.
* Similarly, [[neutron diffraction]] uses neutrons with a wavelength of about 0.1&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]], the typical spacing of atoms in a solid, to determine the structure of solids.
* Photos are now able to show this dual nature, which may lead to new ways of examining and recording this behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://actu.epfl.ch/news/the-first-ever-photograph-of-light-as-both-a-parti/|title=Press release: The first ever photograph of light as both a particle and wave|website=|publisher=Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne|date=2 March 2015|last1=Papageorgiou|first1=Nik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2957">'''Yablo's paradox''' is a [[logical paradox]] published by [[Stephen Yablo]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=S. Yablo |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Yablo/publication/226983444_Truth_and_reflection/links/0046352a7540525226000000/Truth-and-reflection.pdf |title=Truth and reflection|journal=[[Journal of Philosophical Logic (journal)|Journal of Philosophical Logic]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |year=1985 |pages=297-348 |doi=10.1007/BF00249368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S.

Unlike the liar paradox, which uses a single sentence, this paradox uses an infinite list of sentences, each referring to sentences occurring further down the list. Analysis of the list shows there is no consistent way to assign truth values to any of its members. Since everything on the  list refers only to later sentences, Yablo claims his paradox is "not in ''any'' way circular." However, [[Graham Priest]] disputes this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=G. Priest |url=http://www.accionfilosofica.com/misc/1183297103crs.pdf |title=Yablo’s paradox |journal=[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]] |volume=57 |issue=4 |year=1997 |pages=236–242 |doi=10.1093/analys/57.4.236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=J. Beall |url=http://ferenc.andrasek.hu/papersybprx/jcbeal_is_yablo_non_circular.pdf |title=Is Yablo’s paradox non-circular? |journal=[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]] |volume=61 |issue=3 |year=2001 |pages=176–187 |doi=10.1093/analys/61.3.176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statement ==

Consider the following [[infinite set]] of sentences:

* (''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) For each ''i'' &gt; 1, ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is not true.
* (''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) For each ''i'' &gt; 2, ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is not true.
* (''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) For each ''i'' &gt; 3, ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is not true.
* ...

== Analysis ==
Assume there is an ''n'' such that ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is true. Then ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; is not true, so there is some ''k'' &gt; ''n'' + 1 such that ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is true. But ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is not true because ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is true and ''k'' &gt; ''n''. Assuming ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' to be true implies a contradiction: some later ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is both true and not true. So our assumption is absurd and we must conclude that for each ''i'', the sentence ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is not true.  But if each ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is not true, then given that each attributes untruth to later sentences, they are all true.  So we have the paradox that each sentence in Yablo's list is true and not true.

'''Yosef Tunkel''' (1881 – August 9, 1949) was a [[Jew]]ish–Belarusian–American writer of poetry and humorous prose in [[Yiddish]] commonly known by the [[pen name]] '''Der Tunkeler''' or 'The dark one' in Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Biography==
Born into the family of a poor teacher in [[Babruysk]] (in [[Belarus]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]]), Tunkel was a sickly child whose drawing ability prompted charitable members of the community to send him to art school in [[Vilno]]. He finished his studies in 1899 and, too short sighted to be a painter, turned to writing. His poetry was first published in ''Der yud'' ([[Warsaw]]) in 1901 and from then on his poems, [[satire]]s, drama and children's stories appeared in Yiddish publications throughout Europe and North America.

Between 1906 and 1910 he travelled to the United States where he started the humorous journal ''Der kibitser'' (continued for two decades under the title ''[[Der Groyser Kundes]]''). Moving to [[Warsaw]] in 1911 he wrote for ''Der moment'', editing its humour pages, ''Der krumer spiegel'', or ''The Crooked Mirror''. He spent [[World War I]] in Ukraine, mainly in [[Kiev]] and [[Odessa]]. In the early twenties, he adapted several works of German poet [[Wilhelm Busch]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc Miller, [[Emory University]]:
[http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/monatshefte/v099/99.1miller.html The Judaization of Wilhelm Busch]. In: Monatshefte, Vol. 99, No. 1, 2007. The Board of Regents of The University of Wisconsin System.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Warsaw cabaret [[Azazel]] opened in 1925, Der Tunkeler’s writings were part of the repertoire; his works were staged in Łódź and the Warsaw cabaret theater ''Sambatyon'' (which opened in 1927) as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Tunkel_Yoysef Yechiel Szeintuch, YIVO encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 he visited what was then the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. The outbreak of [[World War II]] found him in [[Belgium]] from which he escaped into [[France]] only to be arrested by the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] authorities. Escaping in 1941 he managed to find his way to the US once more, where he wrote for the major New York Yiddish daily ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' despite failing health. He died there in 1949.

Throughout his life, numerous collections of his work were published in Warsaw, Kiev and New York. He is remembered as one of the Yiddish language's outstanding humorists to this day.

=== Chronology ===

'''1878''' ''Iosel Tunkel'' is born in [[Babruysk]].  He was born into a poor family and his father was a poor Melamed.  As a child he suffers from illnesses and is lame. 15 years old he travels to [[Vilnius]] where he studies at the Trutnevs Art School.

'''1899''' Completes his education at the Vilnius Trutnevs Art School.

'''1899-1901''' Due to extreme near-sightedness, he abandons a career in art and instead devotes himself to literature.  He wanders from city to city pawning his stories and returns occasionally to Babruysk. Publishes his first poems in Joseph Luria's Yiddish newspaper Der Yud (The Jew).

'''1906-1910'''  Travels to the United States and lives in New York. Founds two successful and long-lasting humor magazines - Der Kibbitzer (The Kibbitzer) and Di Groyser Kundes (The Big Stick).

'''1910'''      Returns to [[Babruysk]] due to family emergency

'''1911''' Moved to [[Warsaw]]. Becomes a regular contributor to the magazine Der Moment.  Starts using the pseudonyms "Khoshekh" and "'''Der Tunkeler'''". Eventually ''Iosef Tunkel'' becomes the editor of the weekly humor supplement called Der Kromer Shpigel (The Bent Mirror).

'''1914-1918''' During [[World War I]], ''Iosef Tunkel'' returns to [[Babruysk]] and from there to [[Kiev]] and [[Odessa]] where he publishes several short works. Returns to independent Poland after the war.  Returns to Der Moment, while occasionally writing for other newspapers such as Der Haynt and the Folkszeitung (People's Paper) under the pseudonym Androginus.

'''1920s''' Publishes numerous books, plays, feuilletons, parodies and humorous articles.  Often personally acts out his works on stage as he travels around the country. Travels to [[Israel]].  Is feted by the Hebrew Writers Union and Khaim Nakhman Bialik, who declares himself as a great admirer of ''Der Tunkeler's'' works.  He subsequently writes his first travel narrative based on his experiences in the [[Holy Land]].

'''1932–33''' ''Iosef Tunkel'' travels to the [[United States]] to visit his brothers and old friends as well as to gather material for a travel narrative.  He stays in Springfield where his brother Alex and sister-in-law Rose live.

'''1934?''' Travels to the [[Soviet Union]] to gather material for a subsequently published travel narrative. Lives in [[Paris]] for some time.

'''1939'''     Travels to [[Belgium]] to collect material for another travel narrative when the Germans invade [[Poland]] and [[World War II]] breaks out. Illegally crosses the border into [[France]] with a group of Jewish refugees.  Due to his lame leg, he is captured by the French police and sent to a detention center for foreign Jews in [[Strasbourg]].  In the camp, he befriends the Parisian novelist W. Wowiorka. Miraculously escapes the camp and somehow finds his way to the [[United States]] in April 1941.  He resides permanently in New York and quickly finds employment with Der Forverts, the [[New York City|New York]] Yiddish daily newspaper.
[[File:Tunkeler cem.JPG|frame|150px|Cemetery|left]]

'''1943'''   Publishes the autobiographical work Goles: Ksovim von a Flichtling (Exile - The Writings of an Exile) about his experiences in [[Belgium]] and [[France]] in an attempt to shed light on the plight of European Jewry.

'''1948''' ''Tunkel'' publishes his last book ''Der Groyser Genits Oder a Nudner Tag in Nyu York'' (''The Great Genius or an Annoying Day in New York'').  His last work of literature is an article for the Lithuanian Yizkor Book Lite "The Chapter of Vilna in my Life" which is published posthumously in 1951. His physical health shattered by his experiences in the [[France|French]] camps, he spends the last several years of his life ill and nearly blind.

'''1949''' On August 9, 1949 (14 Av, 5709) ''Iosef Tunkel'' dies and is interred in the New Mount Carmel cemetery in Ridgewood, Queens, [[New York (state)|New York]].
