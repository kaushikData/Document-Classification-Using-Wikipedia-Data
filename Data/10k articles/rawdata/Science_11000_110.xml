The '''Antonov An-225 ''Mriya''''' ({{lang-uk|Антонов Ан-225 Мрія|lit=dream' or 'inspiration}}, [[NATO]] [[NATO reporting name|reporting name]]: "'''Cossack'''") is a [[strategic airlift]] [[cargo aircraft]] that was designed by the [[Antonov|Antonov Design Bureau]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] within the [[Soviet Union]] during the 1980s. It is powered by six [[turbofan]] engines and is the [[list of large aircraft|heaviest aircraft ever built]], with a [[maximum takeoff weight]] of {{convert|640|t|ST+LT}}. It also has the largest [[wingspan]] of any aircraft in operational service. The single example built has the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] civil registration '''UR-82060'''.

The Antonov An-225, initially developed for the task of transporting the [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] [[spaceplane]], was an enlargement of the successful [[Antonov An-124 Ruslan|Antonov An-124]]. The first and only An-225 was completed in 1988. After successfully fulfilling its Soviet military missions, it was [[Aircraft boneyard|mothballed]] for eight years.

==Development==
[[File:Antonov An-225 with Buran at Le Bourget 1989 Manteufel.jpg|thumb|left|The An-225 with ''Buran'' at the 1989 Paris airshow]]

The Antonov An-225 was designed to airlift the [[Energia]] [[rocket]]'s [[Zenit (rocket family)#Energia booster|boosters]] and the [[Buran (spacecraft)|''Buran'']] orbiter for the [[Soviet space program]]. It was developed as a replacement for the [[Myasishchev VM-T]]. The An-225's original mission and objectives are almost identical to that of the United States' [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]].&lt;ref name="goebel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airvectors.net/avantgt.html#m3 |title=Antonov An-225 Mriya ("Cossack") |website=The Antonov Giants: An-22, An-124, &amp; An-225 |accessdate=21 August 2012 |author=Greg Goebel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goebMriya&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vectorsite.net/tashutl_c08.html#m1 |title=The Soviet Buran shuttle program |website=Postscript: The Other Shuttles |author=Greg Goebel |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The An-225 first flew on 21 December 1988&lt;ref name="AICC-BBC"/&gt; with a 74-minute flight from Kiev.{{cn|date=December 2017}} The aircraft was on static display at the [[Paris Air Show]] in 1989 and it flew during the public days at the [[Farnborough air show]] in 1990.

A second An-225 was partially built during the late 1980s for the Soviet space program. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the cancellation of the Buran space program, the lone operational An-225 was placed in storage in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airliners.net/aircraft-data/stats.main?id=389 Antonov An-225 Mriya].

When it became clear that a cargoliner bigger than the An-124 was needed, the first An-225 was re-engined and put back into service.&lt;ref name="ramAn225"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mf&gt;"[http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=58 Antonov An-225 Mriya (Cossack) Heavy Lift Strategic Long-Range Transport]" ''Military Factory'', 23 August 2012.

[[File:Antonov An-225 at Farnborough 1990 airshow (2).jpg|thumb|An-225 at Farnborough in 1990]]
By 2000, the need for additional An-225 capacity had become apparent, so the decision was made in September 2006 to complete the second An-225. The second airframe was scheduled for completion around 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationexplorer.com/Antonov_AN-225.html Antonov An-225 Mriya Aircraft History, Facts and Pictures].

In April 2013, the [[Russia]]n government announced plans to revive Soviet-era [[air launch to orbit|air launch]] projects that would use a purpose-built modification to the An-225 as a midair launchpad.&lt;ref name="Aerial Launch"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.interfax.ru/russia/txt.asp?id=303221 |script-title=ru:Правительство задумалось о "Воздушном старте" |date=23 April 2013 |work=[[Interfax]] |accessdate=29 April 2013 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2014|04|30|}}

In August 2016, representatives from Ukraine's Antonov and [[Airspace Industry Corporation of China]] (AICC), an import-export company operating out of Hong Kong,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A private company to run the world's largest transport aircraft production in China?

AICC's president, Zhang You-Sheng, told a [[BBC]] reporter that AICC began to contemplate cooperation with Antonov in 2009 and contacted them in 2011. AICC intends to modernize the second unfinished An-225 and develop it into an [[air launch to orbit]] platform for commercial [[satellite]]s at altitudes up to {{convert|12000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="AICC-BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borys|first1=Christian|title=The world's biggest plane may have a new mission|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170503-the-worlds-biggest-plane-may-have-a-new-mission|accessdate=20 October 2017|publisher=BBC|date=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Antonov-225 main landing gear 2.jpg|thumb|left|An-225's main landing gear]]

Based on Antonov's earlier [[Antonov An-124|An-124]], the An-225 has fuselage barrel extensions added fore and aft of the wings. The wings also received root extensions to increase span. Two more [[Progress D-18T]] [[turbofan]] engines were added to the new [[wing root]]s, bringing the total to six. An increased-capacity [[landing gear]] system with 32 wheels was designed, some of which are steerable, enabling the aircraft to turn within a {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=mid|-wide}} runway. Like its An-124 predecessor, the An-225 has nose gear designed to "kneel" so cargo can be more easily loaded and unloaded.&lt;ref name="ramAn225"/&gt; Unlike the An-124, which has a rear cargo door and ramp, the An-225 design left these off to save weight, and the [[empennage]] design was changed from a single [[vertical stabilizer]] to a [[twin tail]] with an oversized, swept-back [[Stabilizer (aircraft)|horizontal stabilizer]]. The twin tail was essential to enable the plane to carry large, heavy external loads that would disturb the [[aerodynamics|airflow]] around a conventional tail. Unlike the An-124, the An-225 was not intended for [[Airlift#Tactical airlift|tactical airlifting]] and is not designed for [[STOL|short-field operation]].&lt;ref name="goebel"/&gt;

[[File:An-225 D-18T.jpg|thumb|Three of six [[Ivchenko Progress D-18T]] turbofan engines on the An-225]]
Initially the An-225 had a maximum gross weight of {{convert|600|t|ST+LT|abbr=on}}, but from 2000 to 2001 the aircraft underwent modifications at a cost of US$20M such as the addition of a reinforced floor, which increased the maximum gross weight to {{convert|640|t|ST+LT|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Forward"&gt;Forward, David C: "Antonov's Dream Machine", p. 23. ''Airways'' magazine, June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spaeth"&gt;Spaeth, Andreas: "When size matters", p. 29. ''Air International'' magazine, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;Gordon, Yefim; Dmitriy and Sergey Komissarov: "The Six-Engined Dream", page 76. ''Antonov's Heavy Transports: The An-22, An-124/225 and An-70''. Midland, 2004. {{ISBN|1-85780-182-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the earlier and later takeoff weights establish the An-225 as the world's heaviest aircraft, being heavier than the double-deck [[Airbus A380]]. It is surpassed in other size-related categories, however: Airbus claims to have improved upon the An-225's maximum landing weight by landing an A380 at {{convert|591.7|t|lb}} during tests,&lt;ref name="FlightglobalAirbusRevealsA380-LinkedPilotSystemsSecrets"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Learmount|first1=David|title=Airbus reveals A380-linked pilot systems secrets|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/airbus-reveals-a380-linked-pilot-systems-secrets-327310/|accessdate=9 July 2009|publisher=[[Flightglobal]]|date=3 June 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules]], known as the "Spruce Goose", has a greater wingspan and a greater overall height. But the Spruce Goose is 20% shorter and overall lighter, due to the materials used in its construction. In addition, the H-4 only flew once, making the An-225 the largest aircraft in the world to fly multiple times.&lt;ref name="ramAn225"/&gt;&lt;ref name="avzone"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaviationzone.com/factsheets/an225.asp |title=Antonov An-225 Mryia (Cossack) |website=The Aviation Zone |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
[[File:An-225-manchester-2006.jpg|thumb|left|Antonov An-225 at [[Manchester Airport]] in 2006]]

During the last years of the [[Soviet space program]], the An-225 was employed as the prime method of transporting the [[Buran (spacecraft)|''Buran'']] space shuttle.&lt;ref name="avzone"/&gt;

===Antonov commercialization===
[[File:Antonov An-225.jpg|thumb|Antonov An-225 at [[Arlanda Airport]], [[Sweden]]]]

In the late 1980s, the Soviet government was looking for a way to generate revenue from its military assets. In 1989, the Antonov Design Bureau set up a holding company as a heavy airlift shipping corporation under the name "[[Antonov Airlines]]", based in [[Kiev]], Ukraine and operating from [[London Luton Airport]] in partnership with [[Air Foyle HeavyLift]].&lt;ref name="antonov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="goleta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.air-and-space.com/Antonov%20An-225%20Mriya.htm |website=Goleta Air &amp; Space Museum |title=An-225 Mriya, NATO: Cossack |accessdate=31 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company began operations with a fleet of four An-124-100s and three [[Antonov An-12]]s, but a need for aircraft larger than the An-124 became apparent in the late 1990s. In response, the original An-225 was re-engined, modified for heavy cargo transport, and placed back in service under the management of Antonov Airlines.

[[File:An-225 Mriya.jpg|thumb|Antonov An-225 at [[Gostomel Airport]], [[Ukraine]]]]
On 23 May 2001, the An-225 received its type certificate from the Interstate Aviation Committee Aviation Register (IAC AR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mak.ru/english/kommissions/aviareg/certificates/sertifikati_tipa_na_vozdushnie_suda.html |title=Type Certificates for Aircraft |accessdate=8 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430200431/http://www.mak.ru/english/kommissions/aviareg/certificates/sertifikati_tipa_na_vozdushnie_suda.html |archivedate=30 April 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 September 2001, carrying four [[main battle tank]]s&lt;ref name="ramAn225"/&gt; at a record load of {{convert|253.82|t|ST}} of cargo,&lt;ref name="FAI_payload_record"/&gt; the An-225 flew at an altitude of up to {{convert|10750|m|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="FAI_250t_height"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=7133 |title=Height record with 250t payload in the FAI database}}&lt;/ref&gt; over a closed circuit of {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} at a speed of {{convert|763.2|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="FAI_250t_speed_record"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=7131 |title=Speed record with 250t payload over 1000km closed circuit in the official FAI database |accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Special planes: The Antonov-225 Mriya"&gt;{{Cite journal |url= http://www.eurotrib.com/story/2006/4/8/13392/35796 |title= Special planes: The Antonov-225 "Mriya" |publisher=European Tribune |date= 8 April 2006 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The An-225 attracts a high degree of public interest, so much that it has managed to attain a global following due to its size and its uniqueness. People frequently visit airports to see its scheduled arrivals and departures, such as in [[Perth]], Australia in May 2016 where a crowd of more than 50,000 people gathered at [[Perth Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/antonov-an225-mriya-worlds-biggest-planes-perth-landing-delayed-20160515-goven7.html |title= Antonov An-225 Mriya touches down in WA amid traffic chaos near Perth Airport |publisher=WANews.com |date=16 May 2016 |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|Text really needs another source that says 50K spectators were there, instead of "were expected"|date=October 2018}}

===Contracted flights===
The type's first flight in commercial service departed from [[Stuttgart]], Germany on 3 January 2002, and flew to [[Thumrait, Oman]] with 216,000 prepared meals for American military personnel based in the region. This vast number of ready meals was transported on 375 pallets and weighed 187.5 tons.&lt;ref name=airfoyle2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airfoyle.co.uk/services/an225.asp |website=AirFoyle |title=Antonov Airlines:An-225 Mriya |access-date=10 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523173109/http://www.airfoyle.co.uk/services/an225.asp |archive-date=23 May 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The An-225 has since become the workhorse of the Antonov Airlines fleet, transporting objects once thought impossible to move by air, such as 150-tonne generators. It has become an asset to international relief organizations for its ability to quickly transport huge quantities of emergency supplies during disaster relief operations.&lt;ref name="aircraft info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aircraft-info.net/aircraft/jet_aircraft/antonov/AN-225 |website=Aircraft-Info.net |title=Antonov An-225 |accessdate=15 February 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040401135622/http://www.aircraft-info.net/aircraft/jet_aircraft/antonov/AN-225 |archivedate=1 April 2004 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The An-225 has been contracted by the Canadian and U.S. governments to transport military supplies to the Middle East in support of coalition forces.&lt;ref name="aircraft info"/&gt; An example of the cost of shipping cargo by An-225 was over 2 million [[Danish krone|DKK]] (approx. €266,000) for flying a chimney duct from [[Billund Airport|Billund]], Denmark to Kazakhstan in 2004.&lt;ref name="steelcon"&gt;[http://www.steelcon.com/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/News/Steelcon__News_GB.pdf Steelcon News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716133659/http://www.steelcon.com/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/News/Steelcon__News_GB.pdf |date=16 July 2011 }}. steelcon.com.

The '''''Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik''''' ({{ISSN|0174-819X}}, English: '''''Archives for Social Science and Social Welfare''''') was an [[academic journal]] for the [[social sciences]] in Germany between 1888 and 1933. Its first [[Editor-in-chief|editors]] were [[Edgar Jaffé]], [[Werner Sombart]], and [[Max Weber]]. The latter published his seminal essay ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' in the journal in two parts in 1904 and 1905.

Jaffé bought the journal in 1903 for 60000 Mark from the Social Democrat [[Heinrich Braun (writer)|Heinrich Braun]], who had founded and edited the journal under the title ''Archiv für soziale Gesetzgebung und Statistik (Archive for Social Legislation and Statistics)'' since 1888 and changed its title to ''Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik'' in 1904.

In 1933, when the [[Nazism|Nazis]] gained power in Germany, the last editor of the Archive, then-editor Emil Lederer and half of the editorial staff of the journal were forced to emigrate and the journal ceased to exist.

Childhood studies is an aim to understand the study of children; with examples including arts, humanities, natural and social sciences, medicine, and law. Emphasizing on an interdisciplinary and reasonable way to study the age range of young people between 0 -18; as well as using policy and practice to promote the rights of children.

The US National Children's Study was formulated by politicians who realized the importance of disciplines and the study of simple subjects. When compared to the [[British birth cohort studies]], the US lacks a strong tradition for surveys of children. However, there have still been plenty of surveys focusing on their [[health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=Robert T.|last2=O'Muircheartaigh|first2=Colm A.|date=2008-01-01|year=|title=Design Priorities and Disciplinary Perspectives: The Case of the US National Children's Study|jstor=30130767|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society,  Series A (Statistics in Society)|volume=171|issue=2|pages=465–480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain theories claim that adults are mature and reasonable, children on the other hand are said to contrast from this as they are still developing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tisdall|first=E.

Childhood studies is set up as a critical series of processes that has already been done, leading to the creations of mantras and how it focuses on the social construction and agency of young children; as well as valuing their voice, participation, and experience in life.

It is also said childhood studies retain a [[Modernism|modernist agenda]] in doing this, but the rest of sociology has refused to place it as a primary role to instead search for complexity rather than social structures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reports indicate that adults lack stability as they progress through their working lives and states they are trying to reach the goal of becoming a human being, while children are also in this pursuit as they grow.

Despite the beliefs that children aren't as capable of life as adults are, childhood studies have proven that young children are competent of certain abilities when emphasizing their own [[autonomy]], an example being a [[social actor]]. The concept of children's agency is about the means to act, considering the fact that there are many misunderstandings, difficulties, and tribulations that children or young people will have to solve eventually. Due to children's position in society, there are multiple opportunities and ways for children to exercise their social agency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The research of childhood studies shows how young people are socially competent, and that a bigger importance is on their complexities and ambiguities across context; likewise, theoretical advances made by psychology emphasize the need to [[Contextualism|contextualize]] the development of children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Colin Stanley Gum''' (4 June 1924 – 29 April 1960)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article89363935 |title=Family Notices |newspaper=[[Chronicle]] |volume=LXVI, |issue=3,534 |location=South Australia |date=14 June 1924 |accessdate=22 September 2018 |page=39 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Australia]]n [[astronomer]] who catalogued [[emission nebula]]e in the southern sky at the [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]] using wide field photography.  Gum published his findings in 1955 in a study entitled ''A study of diffuse southern H-alpha nebulae'' which presented a catalog, now known as the [[Gum catalog]], of 85 nebulae or nebular complexes. Gum 12, a huge area of nebulosity in the direction of the constellations [[Puppis]] and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]], was later named the [[Gum Nebula]] in his honour.  Gum was part of the team, whose number included [[Frank John Kerr]] and [[Gart Westerhout]], that determined the precise position of the [[neutral hydrogen]] plane in space.

Gum was appointed Head of the Observational Optical Astronomy programme at the [[University of Sydney]] in 1959.  He died in a skiing accident at [[Zermatt]], [[Switzerland]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoas.info/biogs/P004697b.htm Encyclopedia of Australian Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

The crater [[Gum (crater)|Gum]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.&lt;ref name="IAU"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gum |url=https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/2282 |website=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature |publisher=IAU |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An obituary article on Gum appears in the ''Australian Journal of Science'' (Vol. 23, no. 4, 1960).  

Gum was the brother-in-law of prominent academic [[Fay Gale]], and was uncle to businessman [[Michael Gale (businessperson)|Michael Gale]].

The word '''''cryptex''''' is a [[neologism]] coined by the author [[Dan Brown]] for his 2003 novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', denoting a portable [[wiktionary:vault|vault]] used to hide secret messages. It is a word formed from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:en:κρυπτός|κρυπτός]]}} ''kryptós'', "hidden, secret" and [[Latin]] ''[[codex]]''; "an apt title for this device" since it uses "the science of ''cryptology'' to protect information written on the contained scroll or ''codex''" (p.&amp;nbsp;199 of the novel). The first physical cryptex was created by Justin Kirk Nevins in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caine|first1=Peter|title=The Definitive Guide to the Da Vinci Code|date=2006|publisher=Orion}}&lt;/ref&gt;. "Cryptex" is a registered trademark of Justin Kirk Nevins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent &amp; Trademark Office|url=https://www.uspto.gov/trademark}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Design and function ==
The (first) cryptex featured in the novel is described as a stone [[cylinder lock|cylinder]] comprising "five doughnut-sized disks of [[marble]] [that] had been stacked and affixed to one another within a delicate [[brass]] framework"; end caps make it impossible to see inside the hollow cylinder. Each of the disks is carved with the entire alphabet and can be rotated independently of the others to create different letter-alignment combinations, including but not limited to words, initialisms, and anagrams.  Although it is not clear whether the alphabet in question preserves the U/V and/or I/J distinctions and/or includes the letter W, when only the alignment of the disks with respect to each other is considered, the number of potential combinations is between 23&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (279,841) and 26&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (456,976); if the mechanism treats combinations having the same disk alignment but different degrees of rotation around the cylinder's long axis as distinct, as does a multiple-wheel combination lock or slot machine employing an indicator bar along which the specified numbers are to be aligned, this number rises to between 23&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (6,436,343) and 26&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (11,881,376).

The cryptex works "much like a bicycle's [[combination lock]]", and if one arranges the disks to spell out the correct [[password]], "the tumblers inside align, and the entire cylinder slides apart" (p.&amp;nbsp;200).  In the inner compartment of the cryptex, secret information can be hidden, written on a scroll of thin [[papyrus]] wrapped around a fragile vial of [[vinegar]] as a security measure: if one does not know the password but tries to force the cryptex open, the vial will break and the vinegar will dissolve the papyrus before it can be read.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2039">The '''Curie constant''' is a material-dependent property that relates a material's [[magnetic susceptibility]] to its temperature.

The Curie constant, when expressed in [[International System of Units|SI units]], is given by 

:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{\mu_0 \mu_B^2}{3 k_B}n g^2 J(J+1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kittel | first = Charles | title = Introduction to Solid State Physics, 8th Edition | publisher = Wiley | pages = 304 | isbn = 0-471-41526-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of magnetic atoms (or molecules) per unit volume, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Landé g-factor]], &lt;math&gt;\mu_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bohr magneton]],  &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Azimuthal quantum number|angular momentum quantum number]] and &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]].  For a two-level system with magnetic moment &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, the formula reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{1}{k_B}n \mu_0 \mu^2&lt;/math&gt;

while the corresponding expressions in [[Gaussian units]] are
:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{\mu_B^2}{3 k_B}n g^2 J(J+1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{1}{k_B}n\mu^2&lt;/math&gt;

The constant is used in [[Curie's Law]], which states that for a fixed value of a magnetic field, the magnetization of a material is (approximately) inversely proportional to temperature.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M} = \frac{C}{T}\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation was first derived by [[Pierre Curie]].

Because of the relationship between [[magnetic susceptibility]] &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;, magnetization &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt; and applied magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt; is almost linear at low fields, then

:&lt;math&gt;\chi = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{M}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{H}}\approx\frac{\mathbf{M}}{\mathbf{H}}&lt;/math&gt;,

this shows that for a paramagnetic system of non-interacting magnetic moments, magnetization &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt; is inversely related to temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Curie's Law]]).

In [[decision theory]], a '''decision rule''' is a function which maps an observation to an appropriate action. Decision rules play an important role in the theory of [[statistics]] and [[economics]], and are closely related to the concept of a [[strategy (game theory)|strategy]] in [[game theory]].

In order to evaluate the usefulness of a decision rule, it is necessary to have a [[loss function]] detailing the outcome of each action under different states.

== Formal definition ==
Given an observable random variable ''X'' over the [[probability space]] &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle (\mathcal{X},\Sigma, P_\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, determined by a parameter ''&amp;theta;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;Theta;'', and a set ''A'' of possible actions, a (deterministic) '''decision rule''' is a function ''&amp;delta;''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''A''.

== Examples of decision rules ==
* An [[estimator]] is a decision rule used for estimating a parameter. In this case the set of actions is the parameter space, and a loss function details the cost of the discrepancy between the true value of the parameter and the estimated value. For example, in a linear model with a single scalar parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, the domain of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; may extend over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; (all real numbers). An associated decision rule for estimating &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; from some observed data might be, "choose the value of the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, say &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;, that minimizes the sum of squared error between some observed responses and responses predicted from the corresponding covariates given that you chose &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;." Thus, the cost function is the sum of squared error, and one would aim to minimize this cost. Once the cost function is defined, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; could be chosen, for instance, using some optimization algorithm.
* Out of sample [[prediction]] in [[Regression analysis|regression]] and [[Statistical classification|classification]] models.

A '''digital conversation''' is a scripted dialogue (in other words it is dialogue written by a human, just like the script of a movie) which takes place between a person and a computer via any digital medium from [[web browsers]] and [[PDAs]] to [[mobile phones]] and [[Interactive television]].

==Introduction==
[[Image:MobileDigitalConvo.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An example of a digital conversation being run on a mobile device]]
A digital conversation is scripted by a human, uploaded to a [[Server (computing)|server]] where it can be accessed as a [[web service]] by other humans (consumers, employees etc.) and used to impart information to them, whether that information is advising them on the best [[camera]] to buy, helping them tailor make a [[credit card]] or engaging them in an interactive book.

A digital conversation can be undertaken simultaneously from multiple digital channels. In other words, no matter what means you are using to access a digital conversation by, whether it's a browser or a mobile phone, you are calling the same digital conversation. This means that any changes made to a digital conversation are reflected across all channels immediately. This allows digital conversations to evolve.

Rather than throwing content at consumers, digital conversations are designed to engage them in a scripted conversation, to find out what they want and guide them to the outcome they desire. It is this Dialogue Marketing that many perceive as being the way forward, and digital conversations provide a solution to delivering this at scale.&lt;ref name= dialogue&gt;{{cite web |last= McDowall |first= Bob |title= Dialogue Marketing: Part 2 - a solution |publisher= IT Analysis |url= http://www.it-analysis.com/business/content.php?cid=7991 |accessdate= 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It moves away from a traditional one way stream of information with a consumers (offering every consumer the same choices) and moves towards a dialogue, finding out what it is they want and giving it to them. This movement is seen as essential by many:

In the same New York Times article Robert M. Greenberg then states that he wants to "engage (consumers) in digital conversations that are so entertaining, involving and valuable that they won't want to ignore them."&lt;ref name= madison/&gt; The key word here is "engage". digital conversations are created to be, in essence, human interactions and dialogue with one human removed. Unlike [[Chatterbot|Bots]] and [[Avatar (computing)|Avatar]]s, digital conversations are scripted, and this may well lead to more human like interactions.

==The digital conversation Bio-System==
Digital conversations consist of a four-stage "bio-system":

'''Create''' - Consisting of the preliminary creation and refining of the digital conversation including its [[front and back ends|front end]]

'''Interact''' - Whereby consumers engage with the digital conversation

'''Understand''' - The usage data of every consumer engaged with a Conversation is automatically stored and aggregated and can be viewed quickly and easily

'''Adapt''' - This usage data may lead to changes to the digital conversation which are reflected in real time across all channels (as the Conversation is called from one source no matter what the medium accessing it).

==Creation: Scripting a digital conversation==
[[Image:DigitalConvoScript.png|thumb|300px|left|A standard scripting canvas for a digital conversation, each symbol represents a question, note, link or outcome]]

Each digital conversation is made up of a [[dialogue]] based script consisting of a narrative and choices with pathways that lead to Outcomes. It is the user, through their choices, who decides which pathway to follow. The script takes the form of a [[Decision tree|Decision-Tree]] and is the backbone of the digital conversation. Each Decision-Tree defines two or more Pathways. The end point of a Pathway is an Outcome or a loosely coupled Link to another digital conversation enabling longer digital conversation flows.

By embracing the concepts of [[Web 2.0]] and allowing infinite numbers of digital conversations to be linked, this can allow hugely complex subjects to be tackled. One digital conversation written by an expert in Europe can be linked to an existing digital conversation written by an expert in Africa. This allows in theory, vast knowledge landscapes made up of components.&lt;ref name= terry&gt;{{cite web|last= Schurter |first= Terry |title= There really are new ways to approach old problems |publisher= IT Analysis |url= http://www.it-analysis.com/business/content.php?cid=8499 |accessdate= 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A digital conversation can contain good dialogue or bad dialogue. Good dialogue typically means the aggregated interaction of each Dialogue-Step is undertaken in less than 5 seconds. This means a person can read and understand a Dialogue-Step after one read through and wants to continue to the next Dialogue-Step.

Bad dialogue has the opposite effect. Unclear language, for example, can cause confusion and have an adverse effect on a user, worst-case scenario is when a user leaves a digital conversation in despair. Luckily thanks to the available Metrics, such problems can be spotted quickly (numerous users exiting on one particular step indicates an issue with that step) and acted upon, with the dialogue changed as and when needed.

So, the development of a good digital conversation which will engage users requires a combination of skills in particular:

&gt;&gt; Two-way communication

&gt;&gt; [[Decision tree|Decision-tree logic]]

&gt;&gt; [[Behavioural economics]]

A digital conversation can be created for any scripted dialogue, thus it is suited for marketing, sales, support, practices, guides, policies, procedures and much more.

==Interaction==
Thanks to the nature of digital conversations (that they can be accessed across multiple channels from the same source) there are numerous ways to interact with them, whether by browser (see image to the left), mobile phone (see image above) or even through voice.

Due to the Web Service nature of digital conversations, the [[front end processor (program)|front ends]] designed to access them can be extremely diverse (see Links section for a number of examples) and thus are able to reflect [[brand]]ing needs or the needs of the user (for example large type for partially sighted users).

One of the exciting recent developments has been the use of digital conversations to drive Avatars.

===''Web 4.0 Avatar''===
One of the trends of recent years has been the humanising of digital channels, giving a face to things which are not human. This has led to the creation of [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] (also known as [[Internet bot|bot]]s or [[Internet bot|chatter-bots]]) artificial intelligences with which users can “converse”. The success of such bots varies greatly, there are few which respond in a convincingly human way, it is no great mystery why they are commonly referred to as “Bots” often resulting in a stilted, mechanical interaction where straying off a recognized path can lead to poor responses . However, this has not stopped their spread across the commercial world with several high-profile companies adopting them as part of their customer services.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:DCAvatar.png|thumb|300px|right|A Web 2.0 Avatar in action]] --&gt;
Avatars such as [[IKEA]]'s Anna&lt;!--- this link no longer exists --[http://193.108.42.79/cgi-bin/IKEA_UK.cgi/]--&gt; have generated interest both in the business community and among the public. The idea of an artificial intelligence able to respond in an intelligent manner to your questions is indeed an exciting one. However, do these bots really manage it? Or are they just human faced Avatars disguising a search engine beneath?

Web 2.0 Avatars, powered by digital conversations, provide a level of immersion not found in these bots. Why? Because digital conversations are scripted just like any good book or film. And like books and films they are designed to guide a user, through high quality dialogue and interactions, to an outcome. Along with this, the ability to understand user interactions through DecisionMetrics means that these Web 2.0 Avatars can be adapted to emergent demands as they appear. The dialogue can be improved and built up as and when needed.

High quality dialogue, clear concise options for a user to choose and a humanized avatar all combine to create an immersive experience, with the psychological appeal of interacting with a character or object .

The key to immersion and believability is high quality dialogue, and it is high quality dialogue that digital conversations has been created for.

===''Business in the Virtual World''===
The digitlisation of business has been underway for years now, but the desire to do something more, to truly engage customers is growing stronger and stronger...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Can Learn from GE’s Digital Marketing Strategies |publisher=Kissmetrics |url=https://blog.kissmetrics.com/learn-from-ge-digital-marketing/ |accessdate=2017-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IBM]] have recently taken the initiative with this by creating a Virtual Business Centre in the Virtual World of [[Second Life]] which allows clients, partners and sales assistants to interact. It is areas like this that digital conversations might be put to use allowing users to interact with Avatars 24 hours a day 7 days a week.

==Understanding: Measurement and Metrics==
The automated recording of a digital conversation establishes the analytical science of interaction at scale. As a person interacts with a digital conversation Service each Dialogue-Step is recorded verbatim with a date and time step. Anonymous recording of consumers usage provides aggregated emergent patterns without infringing [[information privacy|data privacy]].

This measurement, providing the aggregated performance of each Dialogue-Step, Pathway and Outcome provides the scientific basis for Demand-Sensing allowing behavioral data to become quantifiable.

==Adaptation: Evolving Dialogue==
Once the usage data has been viewed and understood it may well be necessary to react by changing or amending the digital conversation.

The '''eustatic sea level''' is the distance from the center of the earth to the sea surface.&lt;ref name="patzkowskyholland30" /&gt;&lt;ref name="schlager92" /&gt; An increase of the eustatic sea level can be generated by decreasing [[glaciation]], slower spreading rates of the [[mid-ocean ridge]]s or fewer mid-oceanic ridges. Conversely increasing glaciation, faster spreading rates or more mid-ocean ridges lead to a fall of the eustatic sea level.

Changes in the eustatic sea level lead to changes in [[Accommodation (geology)|accommodation]] and therefore affect the deposition of sediments in marine environments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70298">{{For|the condition characterized by [[comorbidity]] of a specific set of impairments to executive functioning|Dysexecutive syndrome}}

In [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]], '''executive dysfunction''', or '''executive function deficit''', is a disruption to the efficacy of the [[executive functions]], which is a group of [[cognitive processes]] that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott R (2003). Executive functions and their disorders. British Medical Bulletin. (65); 49–59&lt;/ref&gt; Executive dysfunction can refer to both [[neurocognitive]] deficits and behavioural [[symptom]]s. It is implicated in numerous [[Psychopathology#As a descriptive term|psychopathologies]] and [[mental disorder]]s, as well as short-term and long-term changes in non-clinical executive control.

Executive dysfunction is not the same as [[dysexecutive syndrome]], a term coined by [[Alan Baddeley]] to describe a common pattern of dysfunction in executive functions, such as deficiencies in [[planning]], abstract thinking, [[Cognitive flexibility|flexibility]] and behavioural control.&lt;ref name="Wilson et al"&gt;Wilson, B.A., Evans, J.J., Emslie, H., Alderman, N., &amp; Burgess, P. (1998). The development of an ecologically valid test for assessing patients with a dysexecutive syndrome.

''Brain and Cognition, 7'', 212-230.&lt;/ref&gt; This group of symptoms, usually resulting from brain damage, tend to occur together.&lt;ref&gt;Halligan, P.W., Kischka, U., &amp; Marshall, J.C. (2004). ''Handbook of clinical neuropsychology.'' Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the existence of dysexecutive syndrome is [[Dysexecutive syndrome#Controversy|controversial]].&lt;ref name="Stuss et. al"&gt;Stuss, D.T. &amp; Alexander, M.P. (2007). Is there a dysexecutive syndrome? ''Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences, 362'' (1481), 901-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Executive functioning]] is a theoretical construct representing a domain of cognitive processes that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes. Executive functioning is not a unitary concept; it is a broad description of the set of processes involved in certain areas of cognitive and behavioural control.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt; Executive processes are integral to higher [[brain function]], particularly in the areas of goal formation, planning, goal-directed action, [[self-monitoring]], [[attention]], response inhibition, and coordination of complex cognition and motor control for effective performance.&lt;ref name="Jurado Rosselli"&gt;Jurado MB, Rosselli M (2007). The elusive nature of executive functions: a review of our current understanding. Neuropsychol Rev, 17(3):213–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Deficits of the executive functions are observed in all populations to varying degrees, but severe executive dysfunction can have devastating effects on cognition and behaviour in both individual and social contexts.

Executive dysfunction does occur to a minor degree in all individuals on both short-term and long-term scales. In non-clinical populations, the activation of executive processes appears to inhibit further activation of the same processes, suggesting a mechanism for normal fluctuations in executive control.&lt;ref name="Schmeichel 2007"&gt;Schmeichel, BJ (2007). Attention Control, memory updating, and emotion regulation temporarily reduce the capacity for executive control. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 136(2):241–55&lt;/ref&gt; Decline in executive functioning is also associated with both normal and clinical aging.&lt;ref name="Zelazo et al"&gt;Zelazo PD, Craik FI, Booth L (2004). Executive function across the life span. Acta Psychol (Amst), 115 (2–3):167–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In aging populations, the decline of memory processes appears to affect executive functions, which also points to the general role of memory in executive functioning.&lt;ref name="Bisiacchi"&gt;Bisiacchi PS, Borella E, Bergamaschi S, Carretti B, Mondini S (2008). Interplay between memory and executive functions in normal and pathological aging. J Clin Exp Neuropsychol, 30(6):723–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive dysfunction appears to consistently involve disruptions in task-oriented behavior, which requires executive control in the inhibition of habitual responses and goal activation.&lt;ref name="Nieuwen"&gt;Nieuwenhuis S, Broerse A, Nielen MM, de Jong R (2004). A goal activation approach to the study of executive function: an application to antisaccade tasks. Brain Cogn. 56(2):198–214. Review.&lt;/ref&gt; Such executive control is responsible for adjusting behaviour to reconcile environmental changes with goals for effective behaviour.&lt;ref name="Verbruggen Logan"/&gt; Impairments in set shifting ability are a notable feature of executive dysfunction; set shifting is the cognitive ability to dynamically change focus between points of fixation based on changing goals and environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name="Avila"&gt;Avila C, Barros A, Ortet G, Parcet MA &amp; Ibanez M I (2003). Set-shifting and sensitivity to reward: A possible dopamine mechanism for explaining disinhibitory disorders. Cognition and Emotion, 17, 951–59.&lt;/ref&gt; This offers a parsimonious explanation for the common occurrence of impulsive, hyperactive, disorganized, and [[aggressive behaviour]] in clinical patients with executive dysfunction. Executive dysfunction, particularly in [[working memory]] capacity, may also lead to varying degrees of emotional dysregulation, which can manifest as chronic [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], or [[hyperemotionality]].&lt;ref name="Schmeichel 2008"&gt;Schmeichel BJ, Volokhov RN &amp; Demaree HA (2008). Working memory capacity and the Self-Regulation of Emotional Expression and Experience" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' 95(6), 1526–40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Barkley]] proposed a hybrid model of the role of behavioural disinhibition in the presentation of ADHD, which has served as the basis for much research of both ADHD and broader implications of the executive system.&lt;ref name="Barkley 1997"/&gt;

Other common and distinctive symptoms of executive dysfunction include utilization behaviour, which is compulsive manipulation/use of nearby objects due simply to their presence and accessibility (rather than a functional reason); and [[imitation]] behaviour, a tendency to rely on imitation as a primary means of [[social interaction]].&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;Hoffmann MW, &amp; Bill PLA (1992). The environmental dependency syndrome, imitation behaviour and utilization behaviour as presenting symptoms of bilateral frontal lobe infarction due to moyamoya disease. South African Medical Journal, 81(5): 271–73&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that executive set shifting is a co-mediator with [[episodic memory]] of [[Children's use of information#Feeling-of-Knowing (FOK)|feeling-of-knowing]] (FOK) accuracy, such that executive dysfunction may reduce FOK accuracy.&lt;ref name="Perrotin"&gt;Perrotin A, Tournell L, Isingrini M (2008). Executive functioning and memory as potential mediators of the episodic feeling-of-knowing accuracy" ''Brain and Cognition'' 67:76–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence suggesting that executive dysfunction may produce beneficial effects as well as maladaptive ones. Abraham et al.&lt;ref name="Abraham 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abraham |first1=A |last2=Windmann |first2=S |last3=McKenna |first3=P |last4=Güntürkün |first4=O |date=May 2007 |title=Creative thinking in schizophrenia: the role of executive dysfunction and symptom severity |journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=235–58 |pmid=17453904 |doi=10.1080/13546800601046714}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate that creative thinking in schizophrenia is mediated by executive dysfunction, and they establish a firm [[etiology]] for creativity in psychoticism, pinpointing a cognitive preference for broader top-down associative thinking versus goal-oriented thinking, which closely resembles aspects of ADHD. It is postulated that elements of [[psychosis]] are present in both ADHD and schizophrenia/[[schizotypy]] due to [[dopamine]] overlap.&lt;ref name="Keshavan"&gt;Keshavan MS, Sujata M, Mehra A, Montrose DM, Sweeney JA (2003). Psychosis proneness and ADHD in young relatives of schizophrenia patients. Schizophrenia Research, 59(1), 85–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==
The cause of executive dysfunction is heterogeneous,&lt;ref name="Nigg 2006"&gt;Nigg JT (2006). What causes ADHD?: Understanding what goes wrong and why. New York, NY: Guilford Press. {{ISBN|1-59385-267-3}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59385-267-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as many [[neurocognitive]] processes are involved in the executive system and each may be compromised by a range of genetic and environmental factors. Learning and development of long-term memory play a role in the severity of executive dysfunction through dynamic interaction with neurological characteristics. Studies in cognitive neuroscience suggest that executive functions are widely distributed throughout the brain, though a few areas have been isolated as primary contributors. Executive dysfunction is studied extensively in clinical neuropsychology as well, allowing correlations to be drawn between such dysexecutive symptoms and their neurological correlates.

Executive processes are closely integrated with memory retrieval capabilities for overall cognitive control; in particular, goal/task-information is stored in both short-term and long-term memory, and effective performance requires effective storage and retrieval of this information.&lt;ref name="Verbruggen Logan"&gt;Verbruggen F, Logan GD. (2008). Long-term aftereffects of response inhibition: memory retrieval, task goals, and cognitive control. J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform, 34(5):1229–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive dysfunction characterizes many of the symptoms observed in numerous [[#Executive dysfunction in clinical populations|clinical populations]]. In the case of [[acquired brain injury]] and neurodegenerative diseases there is a clear neurological etiology producing dysexecutive symptoms. Conversely, [[syndromes]] and [[Mental disorder|disorders]] are defined and diagnosed based on their symptomatology rather than etiology. Thus, while Parkinson's disease, a [[neurodegenerative]] condition, causes executive dysfunction, a disorder such as [[ADHD|attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]] is a classification given to a set of subjectively-determined symptoms implicating executive dysfunction – current models indicate that such clinical symptoms are caused by executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Barkley 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigg 2006"/&gt;

=== Neurophysiology ===
As previously mentioned, executive functioning is not a unitary concept.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt; Many studies have been conducted in an attempt to pinpoint the exact regions of the brain that lead to executive dysfunction, producing a vast amount of often conflicting information indicating wide and inconsistent distribution of such functions. A common assumption is that disrupted executive control processes are associated with pathology in [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] brain regions.&lt;ref name ="Clark"&gt;Clark C, Gallo J, Glosser G, Grossman M (2002). Memory encoding and retrieval in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Neuropsychology. 16(2); 190–96&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported to some extent by the primary literature, which shows both pre-frontal activation and communication between the pre-frontal cortex and other areas associated with executive functions such as the [[basal ganglia]] and [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref name="Nigg 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berquin 1998"&gt;Berquin PC, Giedd JN, Jacobsen LK, Hamburger SD, Krain AL, Rapoport JL, Castellanos FX (1998). Cerebellum in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: A morphometric MRI study" ''Neurology'' 50, 1087–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases of executive dysfunction, deficits are attributed to either frontal lobe damage or dysfunction, or to disruption in fronto-subcortical connectivity.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; Neuroimaging with [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[fMRI]] has confirmed the relationship between executive function and functional frontal pathology.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; Neuroimaging studies have also suggested that some constituent functions are not discretely localized in prefrontal regions.&lt;ref name = "Carpenter"&gt;Carpenter P, Just M &amp; Reichle E (2000). Working memory and executive function: evidence from neuroimaging. Current Opinion in Neurobiology. 10; 195–99&lt;/ref&gt; Functional imaging studies using different tests of executive function have implicated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to be the primary site of cortical activation during these tasks.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"&gt;Dougherty D, Ottowitz W, Savage C (2002). Neural network basis for abnormalities of attention and executive function in major depressive disorder: implications for application of the medical disease model to psychiatric disorders. Harvard Review of Psychology. 10(2); 86–99&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, PET studies of patients with Parkinson's disease have suggested that tests of executive function are associated with abnormal function in the [[globus pallidus]]&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; and appear to be the genuine result of [[basal ganglia]] damage.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt;

With substantial cognitive load, fMRI signals indicate a common network of frontal, parietal and occipital cortices, thalamus, and the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Caparelli E, Chang L, Ernst T et al. (2006). Different activation patterns for working memory load and visual attention load. Brain Research. 158–65&lt;/ref&gt; This observation suggests that executive function is mediated by dynamic and flexible networks that are characterized using functional integration and effective connectivity analyses.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; The complete circuit underlying executive function includes both a direct and an indirect circuit.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"/&gt; The neural circuit responsible for executive functioning is, in fact, located primarily in the frontal lobe.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"/&gt; This main circuit originates in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex/orbitofrontal cortex and then projects through the [[striatum]] and [[thalamus]] to return to the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"/&gt;

Not surprisingly, plaques and tangles in the frontal cortex can cause disruption in functions as well as damage to the connections between prefrontal cortex and the [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref name = "Clark"/&gt; Another important point is in the finding that structural [[MRI]] images link the severity of white matter lesions to deficits in cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Buckner, R. (2004). Memory and executive function in aging and AD: multiple factors that cause decline and reserve factors that compensate" ''Neuron'' 44;195–208&lt;/ref&gt;

The emerging view suggests that cognitive processes materialize from networks that span multiple cortical sites with closely collaborative and over-lapping functions.&lt;ref name = "Carpenter"/&gt; A challenge for future research will be to map the multiple brain regions that might combine with each other in a vast number of ways, depending on the task requirements.&lt;ref name = "Carpenter"/&gt;

=== Genetics ===
Certain genes have been identified with a clear correlation to executive dysfunction and related psychopathologies. According to Friedman ''et al.'' (2008),&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008"&gt;Friedman, et al (2008). Individual differences in executive functions are almost entirely genetic in origin. Journal of experimental psychology, 137(2), 201–10.&lt;/ref&gt; the heritability of executive functions is among the highest of any psychological trait. The dopamine receptor D4 gene ([[DRD4]]) with 7'-repeating [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] (7R) has been repeatedly shown to correlate strongly with impulsive response style on psychological tests of executive dysfunction, particularly in clinical ADHD.&lt;ref name="Langley 2004"&gt;Langley K, Marshall L, Bree M van den, Thomas H, Owen M, O'Donovan M, Thapar A (2004). Association of the dopamine D4 receptor gene 7-repeat allele with neuropsychological test performance of children with ADHD" ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' 161(1),133–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The catechol-o-methyl transferase gene ([[COMT]]) codes for an enzyme that degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters (DA and NE), and its Val158Met polymorphism is linked with the modulation of task-oriented cognition and behavior (including set shifting&lt;ref name="Tunbridge"&gt;Tunbridge EM, Bannerman DM, Sharp T, Harrison PJ (2004). Catechol-o-methyltransferase inhibition improves set-shifting performance and elevates stimulated dopamine release in the rat prefrontal cortex" ''Journal of Neuroscience'' 24(23):5331–35.&lt;/ref&gt;) and the experience of reward, which are major aspects of executive functioning. COMT is also linked to methylphenidate (stimulant medication) response in children with ADHD.&lt;ref name="Sengupta 2008"&gt;Sengupta S, Grizenko N, Schmitz N, Schwartz G, Bellingham J, Polotskaia A, Stepanian MT, Goto Y, Grace AA, Joober R (2008). COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism and the modulation of task-oriented behavior in children with ADHD" ''Neuropsychopharmacology'' 2008, 13:3069–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the DRD4/7R and COMT/Val158Met polymorphisms are also correlated with executive dysfunction in schizophrenia and schizotypal behaviour.&lt;ref name="Alfimova 2007"&gt;Alfimova MV, Golimbet VE, Gritsenko IK, Lezheiko TV, Abramova LI, Strel'tsova MA, Khlopina IV, Ebstein R (2007).

Neuroscience Behaviour Physiology, 37(7), 643–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testing and measurement ==
There are several measures that can be employed to assess the executive functioning capabilities of an individual. Although a trained non-professional working outside of an institutionalized setting can legally and competently perform many of these measures, a trained professional administering the test in a standardized setting will yield the most accurate results.&lt;ref name ="Daghar"&gt;Daghar A, Monchi O, Petre V et al (2001). "Wisconsin card revisited: distinct neural circuits participating in different stages of the task identified by event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging." ''The Journal of Neuroscience'' 21(19)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clock drawing test ===
The Clock drawing test (CDT) is a brief cognitive task that can be used by physicians who suspect neurological dysfunction based on history and physical examination. It is relatively easy to train non-professional staff to administer a CDT. Therefore, this is a test that can easily be administered in educational and geriatric settings and can be utilized as a precursory measure to indicate the likelihood of further/future deficits.&lt;ref name ="Shulman"&gt;Shulman, K (2000). Clock drawing: Is it the ideal cognitive screening test? International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. 15(6); 548–61&lt;/ref&gt; Also, generational, educational and cultural differences are not perceived as impacting the utility of the CDT.&lt;ref&gt;Emond J, Galasko D, Hanson L. et al (2008). Spatial deficits predict rate of cognitive decline in autopsy-verified dementia with lewy bodies. Neuropsychology. 22(6); 729–37&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure of the CDT begins with the instruction to the participant to draw a clock reading a specific time (generally 11:10). After the task is complete, the test administrator draws a clock with the hands set at the same specific time. Then the patient is asked to copy the image.&lt;ref name ="Jeste"&gt;Jeste DV, Legendre SA, Rice VA, et al (2004). "The clock drawing test as a measure of executive dysfunction in elderly depressed patients." Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology. 17(190)&lt;/ref&gt; Errors in clock drawing are classified according to the following categories: omissions, perseverations, rotations, misplacements, distortions, substitutions and additions.&lt;ref name = "Shulman"/&gt; Memory, concentration, initiation, energy, mental clarity and indecision are all measures that are scored during this activity.&lt;ref name ="Damasio"&gt;Damasio H, Rudrauf D, Tranel D, Vianna E (2008). Does the clock drawing test have focal neuroanatomical correlates? Neuropsychology. 22(5); 553–62&lt;/ref&gt; Those with deficits in executive functioning will often make errors on the first clock but not the second.&lt;ref name = "Shulman"/&gt; In other words, they will be unable to generate their own example, but will show proficiency in the copying task.

=== Stroop task ===
The cognitive mechanism involved in the [[Stroop task]] is referred to as directed attention. The Stroop task requires the participant to engage in and allows assessment of processes such as attention management, speed and accuracy of reading words and colours and of inhibition of competing stimuli.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"&gt;Biederam J, Faraone S, Monutaeux M, et al (2000). Neuropsychological functioning in nonreferred siblings of children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder" ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'' 109(2); 252–65&lt;/ref&gt; The stimulus is a colour word that is printed in a different colour than what the written word reads. For example, the word "red" is written in a blue font. One must verbally classify the colour that the word is displayed/printed in, while ignoring the information provided by the written word. In the aforementioned example, this would require the participant to say "blue" when presented with the stimulus. Although the majority of people will show some slowing when given incompatible text versus font colour, this is more severe in individuals with deficits in inhibition. The Stroop task takes advantage of the fact that most humans are so proficient at reading colour words that it is extremely difficult to ignore this information, and instead acknowledge, recognize and say the colour the word is printed in.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod C (1991). Half a century of research on the Stroop effect: An integrative review" ''Psychological Bulletin'' 109(20); 163–203&lt;/ref&gt; The Stroop task is an assessment of attentional vitality and flexibility.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"/&gt; More modern variations of the Stroop task tend to be more difficult and often try to limit the sensitivity of the test.&lt;ref&gt;de Young R (2009)." Stroop task: A test of capacity to direct attention." EPLab: Measures. University of Michigan; http://www.snre.umich.edu/eplab/demos/st0/stroopdesc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wisconsin card sorting test ===
The [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]] (WCST) is used to determine an individual's competence in abstract reasoning, and the ability to change problem-solving strategies when needed.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"/&gt; These abilities are primarily determined by the frontal lobes and basal ganglia, which are crucial components of executive functioning;&lt;ref&gt;Andermahr I, Gaser C, Hager F et al (1996). Brain activation during cognitive stimulation with the Wisconsin Card Sorting test—a functional MRI study on healthy volunteers and schizophrenics. Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging. 75(3); 145–57&lt;/ref&gt; making the WCST a good measure for this purpose.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The WCST utilizes a deck of 128 cards that contains four stimulus cards.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"/&gt; The figures on the cards differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape. The participants are then given a pile of additional cards and are asked to match each one to one of the previous cards. Typically, children between ages 9 and 11 are able to show the cognitive flexibility that is needed for this test.&lt;ref name="Kirkham"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkham|first=N.

=== Trail-making test ===
Another prominent test of executive dysfunction is known as the [[Trail-making test]]. This test is composed of two main parts (Part A &amp; Part B). Part B differs from Part A specifically in that it assesses more complex factors of motor control and perception.&lt;ref name ="Arbuthnott"&gt;Arbuthnott K, Frank J (2000). Trail making test, Part B as a measure of executive control: validation using a set-switching paradigm. Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology. 22(4); 518–28&lt;/ref&gt; Part B of the Trail-making test consists of multiple circles containing letters (A-L) and numbers (1-12). The participant's objective for this test is to connect the circles in order, alternating between number and letter (e.g. 1-A-2-B) from start to finish.&lt;ref&gt;Gaudino E, Geisler M, Squires N (1995). Construct validity in the trail making test: What makes part B harder? Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology. 17(4); 529–35&lt;/ref&gt; The participant is required not to lift their pencil from the page. The task is also timed as a means of assessing speed of processing.&lt;ref name ="Conn"&gt;Conn H (1977). Trail-making and number-connection tests in the assessment of mental state in portal systemic encephalopathy. Digestive Diseases. 22(6); 541–50&lt;/ref&gt; Set-switching tasks in Part B have low motor and perceptual selection demands, and therefore provide a clearer index of executive function.&lt;ref name ="Arbuthnott"/&gt; Throughout this task, some of the executive function skills that are being measured include impulsivity, visual attention and motor speed.&lt;ref name ="Conn"/&gt;

== In clinical populations ==
The executive system's broad range of functions relies on, and is instrumental in, a broad range of neurocognitive processes. Clinical presentation of severe executive dysfunction that is unrelated to a specific disease or disorder is classified as a [[Dysexecutive Syndrome|dysexecutive syndrome]], and often appears following damage to the [[frontal lobe]]s of the [[cerebral cortex]].&lt;ref name="Chan 2001"&gt;Chan, RC. (2001). Dysexecutive symptoms among a non-clinical sample: a study with the use of the Dysexecutive Questionnaire. British Journal of Psychology, Aug., 92 (pt 3):551–65.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Executive dysfunction is implicated [[etiology|etiologically]] and/or [[co-morbidity|co-morbidly]] in many psychiatric illnesses, which often show the same symptoms as the dysexecutive syndrome. It has been assessed and researched extensively in relation to cognitive developmental disorders, [[psychotic disorders]], [[affective disorders]], and [[conduct disorder]]s, as well as neurodegenerative diseases and [[acquired brain injury]] (ABI).

Environmental dependency syndrome is a dysexecutive syndrome marked by significant behavioural dependence on environmental cues and is marked by excessive imitation and utilization behaviour.&lt;ref name="Lhermitte 1986"&gt;Lhermitte F (1986). Human autonomy and the frontal lobes. Part II: Patient behavior in complex and social situations: the "environmental dependency syndrome" ''Annals of Neurology'' 19(4):335–43.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed in patients with a variety of etiologies including ABI, exposure to phendimetrazine tartrate,&lt;ref name="Hoffmann 2007"&gt;Hoffmann M (2007). Transient environmental dependency syndrome due to phendimetrazine tartrate. Eur Neurol, 58(1):49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; stroke, and various frontal lobe lesions.&lt;ref name="Lhermitte 1986"/&gt;

=== Schizophrenia ===
[[Schizophrenia]] is commonly described as a mental disorder in which a person becomes detached from reality because of disruptions in the pattern of thinking and perception.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; Although the etiology is not completely understood, it is closely related to dopaminergic activity and is strongly associated with both neurocognitive and genetic elements of executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Alfimova 2007"/&gt; Individuals with schizophrenia may demonstrate [[amnesia]] for portions of their [[episodic memory]]. Observed damage to explicit, consciously accessed, memory is generally attributed to the fragmented thoughts that characterize the disorder.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; These fragmented thoughts are suggested to produce a similarly fragmented organization in memory during encoding and storage, making retrieval more difficult. However, [[implicit memory]] is generally preserved in patients with schizophrenia.

Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate spared performance on measures of visual and verbal attention and concentration, as well as on immediate digit span recall, suggesting that observed deficits cannot be attributed to deficits in attention or [[short-term memory]].&lt;ref name ="Oram"&gt;Oram J, Geffen GM, Geffen LB, Kavanaugh DJ &amp; McGrath JJ (2005). Executive control of working memory in schizophrenia" ''Psychiatry Research'' 135, 8190&lt;/ref&gt; However, impaired performance was measured on psychometric measures assumed to assess higher order executive function. Working memory and multi-tasking impairments typically characterize the disorder.&lt;ref name="Abraham 2007"/&gt; Persons with schizophrenia also tend to demonstrate deficits in response inhibition and cognitive flexibility.&lt;ref name ="Thoma &amp; Duam"&gt;Thoma P &amp; Duam I (2008). Working memory and multi-tasking in [[paranoid schizophrenia]] with and without comorbid substance use disorder" ''Addiction'' 103, 774–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients often demonstrate noticeable deficits in the central executive component of working memory as conceptualized by [[Baddeley's model of working memory|Baddeley and Hitch]]. However, performance on tasks associated with the [[phonological loop]] and [[visuospatial sketchpad]] are typically less affected.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Radvasnky"&gt;Radvansky GA (2006). Human Memory. United States of America: Allyn and Bacon&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, patients with schizophrenia show impairment to the central executive component of working memory, specific to tasks in which the visuospatial system is required for central executive control.&lt;ref name ="Oram"/&gt; The phonological system appears to be more generally spared overall.

=== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ===
A triad of core symptoms, namely inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity characterize attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Individuals with [[ADHD]] often experience problems with organization, discipline, and setting priorities, and these difficulties often persist from childhood through adulthood.&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"&gt;Marchetta N, Hurks P, Krabbendam L &amp; Jolles J (2008). Interference control, working memory, concept shifting, and verbal fluency in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Neruopsychology, 22(1), 74–84&lt;/ref&gt; In both children and adults with ADHD, an underlying executive dysfunction involving the prefrontal regions and other interconnected subcortical structures has been found.&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"/&gt; As a result, people with ADHD commonly perform more poorly than matched controls on interference control, mental flexibility and verbal fluency.&lt;ref name ="Barkley 1997"&gt;Barkley RA (1997). Behavioral inhibition, sustained attention, and executive functions: Constructing a unifying theory of ADHD" ''Psychological Bulletin'' 121(1), 65–94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Rosenman"&gt;Rosenman S (2006). Reconsidering the attention deficit paradigm. Australasian Psychiatry, 14(2), 127–32&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a more central impairment in self-regulation is noted in cases of ADHD.&lt;ref name ="Barkley 1997"/&gt; However, some research has suggested the possibility that the severity of executive dysfunction in individuals with ADHD declines with age as they learn to compensate for the aforementioned deficits.&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"/&gt; Thus, a decrease in executive dysfunction in adults with ADHD as compared to children with ADHD is thought reflective of compensatory strategies employed on behalf of the adults (e.g. using schedules to organize tasks) rather than neurological differences.

Although ADHD has typically been conceptualized in a categorical diagnostic paradigm, it has also been proposed that this disorder should be considered within a more dimensional behavioural model that links executive functions to observed deficits.&lt;ref name ="Rosenman"/&gt; Proponents argue that classic conceptions of ADHD falsely localize the problem at perception (input) rather than focusing on the inner processes involved in producing appropriate behaviour (output).&lt;ref name ="Rosenman"/&gt; Moreover, others have theorized that the appropriate development of inhibition (something that is seen to be lacking in individuals with ADHD) is essential for the normal performance of other neuropsychological abilities such as working memory, and emotional self-regulation.&lt;ref name ="Barkley 1997"/&gt; Thus, within this model, deficits in inhibition are conceptualized to be developmental and the result of atypically operating executive systems.

=== Autism spectrum disorder ===
[[Autism]] is diagnosed based on the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests. It is a disorder that is defined according to behaviour as no specific biological markers are known.&lt;ref name = "Ward"/&gt; Due to the variability in severity and impairment in functioning exhibited by persons with autism, the disorder is typically conceptualized as existing along a continuum (or spectrum) of severity.

Individuals with autism commonly show impairment in three main areas of executive functioning:&lt;ref name ="Barnard"&gt;Barnard L, Muldoon K, Hasan R, O'Brien G &amp; Stewart M (2008). Profiling executive dysfunction in adults with autism and comorbid learning disability. Autism, 12(2), 125–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =" Gilotty"&gt;Gilotty L, Kenworthy L, Sirian L, Black D &amp; Wagner A (2002). Adaptive skills and executive function in autism spectrum disorders. Child Neuropsychology, 8(4), 241–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Firestone and Dozois"&gt;Firestone P &amp; Dozois JA (2007). Abnormal Psychology: Perspectives (3rd edition.). Toronto: Pearson Education Canada Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Hill"&gt;Hill EL (2004). Executive dysfunction in autism. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 8(1), 26–32&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Fluency.''' Fluency refers to the ability to generate novel ideas and responses. Although adult populations are largely underrepresented in this area of research, findings have suggested that children with autism generate fewer novel words and ideas and produce less complex responses than matched controls.
* '''Planning.''' Planning refers to a complex, dynamic process, wherein a sequence of planned actions must be developed, monitored, re-evaluated and updated. Persons with autism demonstrate impairment on tasks requiring planning abilities relative to typically functioning controls, with this impairment maintained over time. As might be suspected, in the case of autism comorbid with learning disability, an additive deficit is observed in many cases.
* '''Flexibility.''' Poor mental flexibility, as demonstrated in individuals with autism, is characterized by perseverative, stereotyped behaviour, and deficits in both the regulation and modulation of motor acts. Some research has suggested that individuals with autism experience a sort of 'stuck-in-set' perseveration that is specific to the disorder, rather than a more global perseveration tendency. These deficits have been exhibited in cross-cultural samples and have been shown to persist over time.

Although there has been some debate, inhibition is generally no longer considered to be an executive function deficit in people with autism.&lt;ref name ="Barnard"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; Individuals with autism have demonstrated differential performance on various tests of inhibition, with results being taken to indicate a general difficulty in the inhibition of a habitual response.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; However, performance on the [[Stroop task]], for example, has been unimpaired relative to matched controls. An alternative explanation has suggested that executive function tests that demonstrate a clear rationale are passed by individuals with autism.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; In this light, it is the design of the measures of inhibition that have been implicated in the observation of impaired performance rather than inhibition being a core deficit.

In general, individuals with autism show relatively spared performance on tasks that do not require [[mentalization]].&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; These include: use of desire and emotion words, sequencing behavioural pictures, and the recognition of basic facial emotional expressions. In contrast, individuals with autism typically demonstrated impaired performance on tasks that do require mentalizing.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; These include: false beliefs, use of belief and idea words, sequencing [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] pictures, and recognizing complex emotions such as admiring or scheming.

=== Bipolar disorder ===
[[Bipolar disorder]] is a mood disorder that is characterized by both highs (mania) and lows (depression) in mood. These changes in mood sometimes alternate rapidly (changes within days or weeks) and sometimes not so rapidly (within weeks or months).&lt;ref name ="Firestone and Dozois"/&gt; Current research provides strong evidence of cognitive impairments in individuals with bipolar disorder, particularly in executive function and verbal learning.&lt;ref name ="Robinson"&gt;Robinson LJ, Thompson JM, Gallagher P, Goswami U, Young AH, Ferrier IN &amp; Moore PB (2006). A meta-analysis of cognitive deficits in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder" ''Journal of Affective Disorders'' 93, 105–15&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these cognitive deficits appear to be consistent cross-culturally,&lt;ref name ="Robinson"/&gt; indicating that these impairments are characteristic of the disorder and not attributable to differences in cultural values, norms, or practice. Functional neuroimaging studies have implicated abnormalities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex as being volumetrically different in individuals with bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name ="Robinson"/&gt;

Individuals affected by bipolar disorder exhibit deficits in strategic thinking, inhibitory control, working memory, attention, and initiation that are independent of affective state.&lt;ref name ="Firestone and Dozois"/&gt;&lt;ref name =" Glahn"&gt;Glahn DC, Bearden CE, Barguil M, Barrett J, Reichenberg A, Bowden CL, Soars JC &amp; Velligan DI (2007). The neurocognitive signature of psychotic bipolar disorder. Journal of Biology Psychiatry, 62, 910–16&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the more generalized cognitive impairment demonstrated in persons with schizophrenia, for example, deficits in bipolar disorder are typically less severe and more restricted. It has been suggested that a "stable dys-regulation of prefrontal function or the subcortical-frontal circuitry [of the brain] may underlie the cognitive disturbances of bipolar disorder".&lt;ref name ="Dixon"&gt;Dixon T, Kravariti E, Frith C, Murray RM &amp; McGuire PK (2004). Effect of symptoms on executive function in bipolar illness" ''Psychological Medicine'' 34, 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Executive dysfunction in bipolar disorder is suggested to be associated particularly with the manic state, and is largely accounted for in terms of the [[formal thought disorder]] that is a feature of mania.&lt;ref name ="Dixon"/&gt; It is important to note, however, that patients with bipolar disorder with a history of [[psychosis]] demonstrated greater impairment on measures of executive functioning and spatial working memory compared with bipolar patients without a history of psychosis&lt;ref name ="Glahn"/&gt; suggesting that psychotic symptoms are correlated with executive dysfunction.

=== Parkinson's disease ===
[[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) primarily involves damage to subcortical brain structures and is usually associated with movement difficulties, in addition to problems with memory and thought processes.&lt;ref name ="Ward"&gt;Ward J (2006). The Student's Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; Persons affected by PD often demonstrate difficulties in [[working memory]], a component of executive functioning. Cognitive deficits found in early PD process appear to involve primarily the fronto-executive functions.&lt;ref name ="Schneider"&gt;Schneider JS (2007). Behavioral persistence deficit in Parkinson's disease patients. Journal of Neurology, 14, 300–04&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, studies of the role of dopamine in the cognition of PD patients have suggested that PD patients with inadequate dopamine supplementation are more impaired in their performance on measures of executive functioning.&lt;ref name ="Grossman"&gt;Grossman M, Lee C, Morris J, Stern MB &amp; Hurtig H (2002). Assessing resource demands during sentence processing in Parkinson's disease. Brain and Language, 80, 603–16&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that dopamine may contribute to executive control processes. Increased distractibility, problems in set formation and maintaining and shifting attentional sets, deficits in executive functions such as self-directed planning, problems solving, and working memory have been reported in PD patients.&lt;ref name ="Schneider"/&gt; In terms of working memory specifically, persons with PD show deficits in the areas of: a) spatial working memory; b) [[central executive]] aspects of working memory; c) loss of [[episodic memories]]; d) locating events in time.&lt;ref name = "Ward"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Schneider"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Grossman"/&gt;

'''Spatial working memory.'''
PD patients often demonstrate difficulty in updating changes in spatial information and often become disoriented. They do not keep track of spatial contextual information in the same way that a typical person would do almost automatically. Similarly, they often have trouble remembering the locations of objects that they have recently seen, and thus also have trouble with encoding this information into long-term memory.

'''Central executive aspects.'''
PD is often characterized by a difficulty in regulating and controlling one's stream of thought, and how memories are utilized in guiding future behaviour. Also, persons affected by PD often demonstrate perseverative behaviours such as continuing to pursue a goal after it is completed, or an inability to adopt a new strategy that may be more appropriate in achieving a goal. However, some recent research suggests that PD patients may actually be less persistent in pursuing goals than typical persons and may abandon tasks sooner when they encounter problems of a higher level of difficulty.&lt;ref name ="Schneider"/&gt;

'''Loss of episodic memories.'''
The loss of episodic memories in PD patients typically demonstrates a temporal gradient wherein older memories are generally more preserved than newer memories. Also, while forgetting event content is less compromised in Parkinson's than in [[Alzheimer's]], the opposite is true for event data memories.

'''Locating events in time.'''
PD patients often demonstrate deficits in their ability to sequence information, or date events. Part of the problems is hypothesized to be due to a more fundamental difficulty in coordinating or planning retrieval strategies, rather than failure at the level of encoding or storing information in memory. This deficit is also likely to be due to an underlying difficulty in properly retrieving script information. PD patients often exhibit signs of irrelevant intrusions, incorrect ordering of events, and omission of minor components in their script retrieval, leading to disorganized and inappropriate application of script information.

=== Treatment ===

==== Psychosocial treatment ====
Since 1997 there has been experimental and clinical practice of psychosocial treatment for adults with executive dysfunction, and particularly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Psychosocial treatment addresses the many facets of executive difficulties, and as the name suggests, covers academic, occupational and social deficits. Psychosocial treatment facilitates marked improvements in major symptoms of executive dysfunction such as time management, organization and self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Ramsay Rostain 2007"&gt;Ramsay JR &amp; Rostain AL (2007). Psychosocial treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults: Current status and future directions. Journal of Attention Disorders, 11(6), 624–27&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive-behavioral therapy and group rehabilitation ====
[[Cognitive behavioural therapy|Cognitive-behavioural therapy]] (CBT) is a frequently suggested treatment for executive dysfunction, but has shown limited effectiveness. However, a study of CBT in a group rehabilitation setting showed a significant increase in positive treatment outcome compared with individual therapy. Patients' self-reported symptoms on 16 different ADHD/executive-related items were reduced following the treatment period.&lt;ref name="Virta 2008"&gt;Virta M, Vedenpää A, Grönroos N, Chydenius E, Partinen M, Vataja R, Kaski M, Iivanainen M (2008). Adults with ADHD benefit from cognitive-behaviorally oriented group rehabilitation: a study of 29 participants. Journal of Attention Disorders, 12(3), 218–26&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Treatment for patients with acquired brain injury ====
The use of auditory stimuli has been examined in the treatment of dysexecutive syndrome. The presentation of auditory stimuli causes an interruption in current activity, which appears to aid in preventing "goal neglect" by increasing the patients' ability to monitor time and focus on goals. Given such stimuli, subjects no longer performed below their age group average IQ.&lt;ref name="Manly 2001"&gt;Manly T, Hawkins K, Evans J, Woldt K, Robertson IH (2002). Rehabilitation of executive function: facilitation of effective goal management on complex tasks using periodic auditory alerts" ''Neuropsychologia'' 40(3):271–81&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients with acquired brain injury have also been exposed to goal management training (GMT). GMT skills are associated with paper-and-pencil tasks that are suitable for patients having difficulty setting goals. From these studies there has been support for the effectiveness of GMT and the treatment of executive dysfunction due to ABI.&lt;ref name="Levine 2000"&gt;Levine B, Robertson IH, Clare L, Carter G &amp; Hong J (2000). Rehabilitation of executive functioning: An experimental–clinical validation of Goal Management Training. Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, 6: 299–312&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developmental context ===
An understanding of how executive dysfunction shapes development has implications how we conceptualize executive functions and their role in shaping the individual. Disorders affecting children such as ADHD, along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, high functioning autism and Tourette's syndrome have all been suggested to involve executive functioning deficits.&lt;ref name ="De Boechorstraat"&gt;De Boechorstraat V, Geurts H, Oosterlaan J et al (2001). How specific is a deficit of executive functioning for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder? Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of current research has been on working memory, planning, set shifting, inhibition, and fluency. This research suggests that differences exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, on measures of executive functioning.&lt;ref name ="De Boechorstraat"/&gt;

Some research has suggested a link between a child's abilities to gain information about the world around them and having the ability to override emotions in order to behave appropriately.&lt;ref name ="Barchfeld"&gt;Barchfeld P, Kain W, Perner J (2002). Executive control and higher-order theory of mind in children at risk at ADHD. Austria: Department of Psychology, University of Salzburg&lt;/ref&gt; One study required children to perform a task from a series of psychological tests, with their performance used as a measure of executive function.&lt;ref name ="Barchfeld"/&gt; The tests included assessments of: executive functions (self-regulation, monitoring, attention, flexibility in thinking), language, sensorimotor, visuospatial, and learning, in addition to social perception. The findings suggested that the development of [[theory of mind]] in younger children is linked to executive control abilities with development impaired in individuals who exhibit signs of executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name ="Barchfeld"/&gt;

However, in infancy and early childhood, parenting is among the most critical external influences on child reactivity.&lt;ref name ="Dennis"&gt;Dennis T (2006).

Maternal communication style with mentally retarded children. American Journal of Mental Retardation, 93; 352–59&lt;/ref&gt; Every child is unique, making parenting an emotional challenge that should be most closely related to the child's level of emotional self-regulation (persistence, frustration and compliance).&lt;ref name ="Dennis"/&gt; A promising approach that is currently being investigated amid intellectually disabled children and their parents is responsive teaching. Responsive teaching is an early intervention curriculum designed to address the cognitive, language, and social needs of young children with developmental problems.&lt;ref name ="Herman"&gt;Herman B, Mahoney G, Perales F et al (2006).

There is no doubt that there is a prominent link between parental interaction and child development but the best child rearing technique continues to vary amongst experts.

=== Evolutionary perspective ===
The prefrontal lobe controls two related executive functioning domains. The first is mediation of abilities involved in planning, problem solving, and understanding information, as well as engaging in working memory processes and controlled attention. In this sense, the prefrontal lobe is involved with dealing with basic, everyday situations, especially those involving metacognitive functions.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"&gt;Ardila A (2008). On the evolutionary origins of executive functions. Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Florida International University&lt;/ref&gt; The second domain involves the ability to fulfill biological needs through the coordination of cognition and emotions which are both associated with the frontal and prefrontal areas.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt;

From an evolutionary perspective, it has been hypothesized that the executive system may have evolved to serve several adaptive purposes.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"&gt;Barkley RA (2001). The executive functions and self-regulation: An evolutionary neuropsychological perspective. Neuropsychology Review, 11(1), 1–29&lt;/ref&gt; The prefrontal lobe in humans has been associated both with metacognitive executive functions and emotional executive functions.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt; Theory and evidence suggest that the frontal lobes in other primates also mediate and regulate emotion, but do not demonstrate the metacognitive abilities that are demonstrated in humans.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt; This uniqueness of the executive system to humans implies that there was also something unique about the environment of ancestral humans, which gave rise to the need for executive functions as adaptations to that environment.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt; Some examples of possible adaptive problems that would have been solved by the evolution of an executive system are: social exchange, imitation and observational learning, enhanced pedagogical understanding, tool construction and use, and effective communication.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt;

In a similar vein, some have argued that the unique metacognitive capabilities demonstrated by humans have arisen out of the development of a sophisticated language (symbolization) systems and culture.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt; Moreover, in a developmental context, it has been proposed that each executive function capability originated as a form of public behaviour directed at the external environment, but then became self-directed, and then finally, became private to the individual, over the course of the development of self-regulation.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt; These shifts in function illustrate the evolutionarily salient strategy of maximizing longer-term social consequences over near-term ones, through the development of an internal control of behaviour.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt;

== Socio-cultural implications ==

=== Education ===
In the classroom environment, children with executive dysfunction typically demonstrate skill deficits that can be categorized into two broad domains: a) self-regulatory skills; and b) goal-oriented skills.&lt;ref name="McDougall"&gt;McDougall A (2001). Executive functions: Practical strategies for supporting students. Psychological Services, DDSB. Symposium conducted at DDSB, Ontario, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; The table below is an adaptation of McDougall's&lt;ref name ="McDougall"/&gt; summary and provides an overview of specific executive function deficits that are commonly observed in a classroom environment. It also offers examples of how these deficits are likely to manifest in behaviour.

'''Self-regulatory skills'''

Teachers play a crucial role in the implementation of strategies aimed at improving academic success and classroom functioning in individuals with executive dysfunction. In a classroom environment, the goal of [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] should ultimately be to apply external control, as needed (e.g. adapt the environment to suit the child, provide adult support) in an attempt to modify problem behaviours or supplement skill deficits.&lt;ref name ="Lerner &amp; Kline"&gt;Lerner JW &amp; Kline F (2006). Learning disabilities and related disorders: Characteristics and teaching strategies (10th ed.). United States of America: Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, executive function difficulties should not be attributed to negative personality traits or characteristics (e.g. laziness, lack of motivation, apathy, and stubbornness) as these attributions are neither useful nor accurate.

Several factors should be considered in the development of intervention strategies. These include, but are not limited to: developmental level of the child, comorbid disabilities, environmental changes, motivating factors, and coaching strategies.&lt;ref name ="McDougall"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Lerner &amp; Kline"/&gt; It is also recommended that strategies should take a proactive approach in managing behaviour or skill deficits (when possible), rather than adopt a reactive approach.&lt;ref name ="McDougall"/&gt; For example, an awareness of where a student may have difficulty throughout the course of the day can aid the teacher in planning to avoid these situations or in planning to accommodate the needs of the student.

People with executive dysfunction have a slower cognitive processing speed and thus often take longer to complete tasks than people who demonstrate typical executive function capabilities. This can be frustrating for the individual and can serve to impede academic progress. Disorders affecting children such as ADHD, along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, high functioning autism and Tourette's syndrome have all been suggested to involve executive functioning deficits.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; The main focus of current research has been on working memory, planning, set shifting, inhibition, and fluency. This research suggests that differences exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, on measures of executive functioning.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt;

Moreover, some people with ADHD report experiencing frequent feelings of drowsiness.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown TE (2008). Describing Six Aspects of a Complex Syndrome. http://www.drthomasebrown.com/pdfs/Executive_Functions_by_Thomas_Brown.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This can hinder their attention for lectures, readings, and completing assignments. Individuals with this disorder have also been found to require more stimuli for information processing in reading and writing.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; Slow processing may manifest in behavior as signaling a lack of motivation on behalf of the learner. However, slow processing is reflective of an impairment of the ability to coordinate and integrate multiple skills and information sources.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The main concern with individuals with autism regarding learning is in the imitation of skills.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; This can be a barrier in many aspects such as learning about others intentions, mental states, speech, language, and general social skills.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; Individuals with autism tend to be dependent on the routines that they have already mastered, and have difficulty with initiating new non-routine tasks. Although an estimated 25–40% of people with autism also have a learning disability, many will demonstrate an impressive rote memory and memory for factual knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; As such, repetition is the primary and most successful method for instruction when teaching people with autism.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

Being attentive and focused for people with Tourette's syndrome is a difficult process. People affected by this disorder tend to be easily distracted and act very impulsively.&lt;ref name ="Gaffney"/&gt; That is why it is very important to have a quiet setting with few distractions for the ultimate learning environment. Focusing is particularly difficult for those who are affected by Tourette's syndrome comorbid with other disorders such as ADHD or [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], it makes focusing very difficult.&lt;ref name="Gaffney"&gt;Gaffney GR (2005). Tourette Syndrome. University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics. http://www.uihealthcare.com/topics/neurologicalhealth/tourettesyndrome.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329091227/http://www.uihealthcare.com/topics/neurologicalhealth/tourettesyndrome.html |date=2009-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, these individuals can be found to repeat words or phrases consistently either immediately after they are learned or after a delayed period of time.&lt;ref name ="Gaffney"/&gt;

=== Criminal behaviour ===

Prefrontal dysfunction has been found as a marker for persistent, criminal behavior.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"&gt;Barbosa M, Monteiro L (2008). Recurrent criminal behaviour and executive dysfunction. The Spanish Journal of Psychology, 259–65&lt;/ref&gt; The prefrontal cortex is involved with mental functions including; affective range of emotions, forethought, and self-control.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"/&gt; Moreover, there is a scarcity of mental control displayed by individuals with a dysfunction in this area over their behavior, reduced flexibility and self-control and their difficulty to conceive behavioral consequences, which may conclude in unstable (or criminal) behavior.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogilvie|first=James M.|last2=Stewart|first2=Anna L.|last3=Chan|first3=Raymond C. K.|last4=Shum|first4=David H. K.|date=2011-11-01|title=Neuropsychological Measures of Executive Function and Antisocial Behavior: A Meta-Analysis*|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00252.x/abstract|journal=Criminology|language=en|volume=49|issue=4|pages=1063–1107|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00252.x|issn=1745-9125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent study conducted by Barbosa &amp; Monteiro, it was discovered that the recurrent criminals that were considered in this study suffered from executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"/&gt; In view of the fact that abnormalities in executive function can limit how people respond to rehabilitation and re-socialization programs&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"/&gt; these findings of the recurrent criminals are justified. Statistically significant relations have been discerned between anti-social behavior and executive function deficits.&lt;ref name ="Lilenfeld"/&gt; These findings relate to the emotional instability that is connected with executive function as a detrimental symptom that can also be linked towards criminal behavior. Conversely, it is unclear as to the specificity of anti-social behavior to executive function deficits as opposed to other generalized neuropsychological deficits.&lt;ref name ="Lilenfeld"&gt;Lilenfeld S, Morgan A (2000). A meta-analytic review of the relation between antisocial behavior and neuropsychological measures of executive function. Clinical Psychology Review. 20(1); 113–36&lt;/ref&gt; The uncontrollable deficiency of executive function has an increased expectancy for aggressive behavior that can result in a criminal deed.&lt;ref name ="Brower"&gt;Brower MC, Price BH (2001). Neuropsychiatry of frontal lobe dysfunction in violent and criminal behaviour: a critical review. Advances in Neuropsychiatry. 720–26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meijers|first=J.|last2=Harte|first2=J. M.|last3=Meynen|first3=G.|last4=Cuijpers|first4=P.|date=2017-02-01|title=Differences in executive functioning between violent and non-violent offenders|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/div-classtitledifferences-in-executive-functioning-between-violent-and-non-violent-offendersdiv/51D2EDD628447218922BA833A6F59D85|journal=Psychological Medicine|pages=1–10|doi=10.1017/S0033291717000241|issn=0033-2917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orbitofrontal injury also hinders the ability to be risk avoidant, make social judgments, and may cause reflexive aggression.&lt;ref name ="Brower"/&gt; A common retort to these findings is that the higher incidence of cerebral lesions among the criminal population may be due to the peril associated with a life of crime.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"/&gt; Along with this reasoning, it would be assumed that some other personality trait is responsible for the disregard of social acceptability and reduction in social aptitude.

Furthermore, some think the dysfunction cannot be entirely to blame.&lt;ref name ="Brower"/&gt; There are interacting environmental factors that also have an influence on the likelihood of criminal action. This theory proposes that individuals with this deficit are less able to control impulses or foresee the consequences of actions that seem attractive at the time (see above) and are also typically provoked by environmental factors. One must recognize that the frustrations of life, combined with a limited ability to control life events, can easily cause aggression and/or other criminal activities. Early brain Damage causes dopamine(epigentically) to select for "Seeking" behavior in the very short term...this is the window for existence for these individuals...the future has no meaning so consequences have no meaning

'''Explorer 9''', known as '''S-56A''' before launch, was an [[United States|American]] satellite which was launched in 1961 to study the density and composition of the upper [[thermosphere]] and lower [[exosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/explorer.html|title=Explorer Spacecraft Series|publisher=NASA History Division|first=Woody|last=Smith|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a reflight of the failed [[S-56 (satellite)|S-56]] mission, and consisted of a {{convert|7|kg|adj=on}},  {{convert|3.7|m|adj=on|sp=us}} balloon which was deployed into a [[medium Earth orbit]].&lt;ref name="EA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/s56.htm|title=S-56|first=Mark|last=Wade|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission was conducted by [[NASA]]'s [[Langley Research Center]].

[[File:Scout X-1 with Explorer 9 Feb 16 1961.JPG|150px|thumb|left|The launch of Explorer 9]]
Explorer 9 was launched from [[Wallops Flight Facility Launch Area 3|Launch Area 3]] at the [[Wallops Flight Facility|Wallops Flight Center]], atop a [[Scout X-1]] rocket with the serial number ST-4. It was the first spacecraft launched from Wallops Island to achieve orbit, with one previous attempt having failed. The launch occurred at 13:05:00 UTC on 16 February 1961, and resulted in Explorer 9 being deployed into an orbit with an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|2581|km}}, a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|635|km}}, 38.8 degrees of [[inclination]] and a period of 118.4 minutes.&lt;ref name="SATCAT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was assigned the [[Harvard designation]] 1961 Delta 1.&lt;ref name="LaunchLog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second of six identical [[air density]] research satellites to be launched, Explorer 9 was the first to successfully reach orbit. It was still operational when the next satellite, [[Explorer 19]], was launched, allowing simultaneous readings to be taken and compared. The spacecraft consisted of alternating layers of [[aluminium foil]] and [[Mylar]] [[polyester]] film. Uniformly distributed over the aluminium surface were 5.1&amp;nbsp;cm-diameter dots of white paint for thermal control. The sphere was packed in a tube 21.6&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and 48.3&amp;nbsp;cm long and mounted in the nose of the fourth stage of the launch vehicle. Upon separation of the fourth stage, the sphere was inflated by a nitrogen gas bottle, and a separation spring ejected it out into its own orbit. The two hemispheres of aluminium foil were separated with a gap of Mylar at the spacecraft's equator and served as the antenna. A 136&amp;nbsp;MHz, 15&amp;nbsp;mW beacon was carried for tracking purposes, but the beacon failed on the first orbit and the SAO Baker-Nunn camera network had to be relied upon for tracking. Power was supplied by solar cells and rechargeable batteries.&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/explorer_ad.htm|title=Explorer: AD|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|publisher=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It decayed from orbit on 9 April 1964.&lt;ref name="SATCAT"/&gt;

In [[statistics]] and [[information theory]], the '''expected formation matrix''' of a [[likelihood function]] &lt;math&gt;L(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix inverse of the [[Fisher information matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;L(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, while the '''observed formation matrix''' of &lt;math&gt;L(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse of the [[observed information matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;L(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (1984) p104&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, no notation for dealing with formation matrices is widely used, but in books and articles by [[Ole E. Barndorff-Nielsen]] and [[Peter McCullagh]], the symbol &lt;math&gt;j^{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is used to denote the element of the i-th line and j-th column of the observed formation matrix. The [[Information Geometry|geometric interpretation]] of the Fisher information matrix (metric) leads to a notation of &lt;math&gt;g^{ij}&lt;/math&gt; following the notation of the ([[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]]) metric tensor in [[differential geometry]]. The Fisher information metric is denoted by &lt;math&gt;g_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; so that using [[Einstein notation]] we have &lt;math&gt; g_{ik}g^{kj} = \delta_i^j&lt;/math&gt;.

These matrices appear naturally in the [[asymptotic expansion]] of the distribution of many statistics related to the [[Likelihood-ratio test|likelihood ratio]].

'''Friedrich Adolph Roemer''' (15 April 1809 – 25 November 1869), German [[geologist]], was born at [[Hildesheim]], in the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]].

His father was a lawyer and councillor of the high court of justice. In 1845 he became professor of [[mineralogy]] and [[geology]] at [[Clausthal University of Technology|Clausthal]], and in 1862 named director of the School of Mines. He first described the [[Cretaceous]] and [[Jurassic]] [[stratum|strata]] of Germany in elaborate works entitled ''Die Versteinerungen des Norddeutschen Oolith-Gebirges'' ("Fossils of the North German [[oolith]] formations"; 1836–39), ''Die Versteinerungen des Norddeutschen Kreidegebirges'' ("Fossils of the North German chalk formations"; 1840–41) and ''Die Versteinerungen des Harzgebirges'' ("Fossils of the [[Harz Mountains]]"; 1843). He died in [[Clausthal]].

The mineral [[romerite]] commemorates his name,&lt;ref&gt;[http://webmineral.com/data/Romerite.shtml#.V32pp4-cH6g Romerite Mineral Data] Webmineral.com&lt;/ref&gt; as does ''Roemeriana'', a publication issued by the Institute of Geology at the [[Clausthal University of Technology|''Bergakademie'' in Clausthal]] from 1954 to 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33190312#page/855/mode/1up BHL] Taxonomic literature : a selective guide to botanical publications&lt;/ref&gt;

His younger brother, [[Carl Ferdinand von Roemer]], was also a geologist.

'''Interstellar Boundary Explorer''' ('''IBEX''') is a [[NASA]] satellite that is making a map of the boundary between the [[Solar System]] and [[interstellar space]]. The mission is part of NASA's [[Small Explorer program]] and was launched with a [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus-XL]] rocket on October 19, 2008.&lt;ref name="IBEX-MSC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/pegasus/ibex/status.html |title=Mission Status Center: Pegasus/IBEX |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Justin |last=Ray |date=October 19, 2008 |accessdate=November 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design and operation of the mission is being led by the [[Southwest Research Institute]], with the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] and the [[Lockheed Martin]] Advanced Technology Center serving as co-investigator institutions responsible for the IBEX-Hi and IBEX-Lo sensors respectively. The [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]] manufactured the [[spacecraft bus]] and was the location for spacecraft environmental testing. The nominal mission baseline duration was two years to observe the entire Solar System boundary. This was completed by 2011 and its mission was extended to 2013 to continue observations.&lt;ref name="ibex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ibex.swri.edu/archive/index.shtml |title=Archived Updates |publisher=Southwest Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBEX is in a Sun-oriented spin-stabilized orbit around the Earth.&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orbitalatk.com/space-systems/science-national-security-satellites/science-environment-satellites/docs/IBEX.pdf |title=Fact Sheet: IBEX |publisher=Orbital ATK |accessdate=April 27, 2015 |id=FS001_06_3695 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316113810/http://www.orbitalatk.com/space-systems/science-national-security-satellites/science-environment-satellites/docs/IBEX.pdf |archivedate=March 16, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, IBEX was shifted to a new more efficient orbit.&lt;ref name="ibexnews201111" /&gt; It does not come as close to the [[Moon]] in the new orbit, and expends less fuel to maintain its position.&lt;ref name="ibexnews201111" /&gt;

== Payload ==
[[File:IBEX Lo sensor.jpg|thumb|170px|left|IBEX Lo sensor]]
The heliospheric boundary of the [[Solar System]] is being imaged by measuring the location and magnitude of charge-exchange collisions occurring in all directions. This will ultimately yield a map of the [[termination shock]] of the [[solar wind]]. The satellite's payload consists of two [[energetic neutral atom]] (ENA) imagers, IBEX-Hi and IBEX-Lo. Each of these sensors consists of a [[collimator]] that limits their fields-of-view, a conversion surface to convert neutral [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] into [[ions]], an [[electrostatic analyzer]] (ESA) to suppress [[ultraviolet]] light and to select ions of a specific energy range, and a detector to count particles and identify the type of each ion. The IBEX-Hi instrument is recording particle counts in a higher energy band than the IBEX-Lo does. The scientific payload also includes a Combined Electronics Unit (CEU) that controls the voltages on the collimator and the ESA, and it reads and records data from the particle detectors of each sensor.

== Mission parameters ==
The IBEX satellite, initially launched into a highly-elliptical transfer orbit with a low perigee, used a [[solid fuel rocket motor]] as its final boost stage at apogee, in order to raise its perigee greatly and to achieve its desired high-altitude elliptical orbit.

IBEX is in a highly-eccentric elliptical terrestrial orbit, which ranges from a [[perigee]] of about {{convert|86000|km|mi|abbr=on}} to an [[apogee]] of about {{convert|260000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="n2yo"/&gt; Its original orbit was about {{convert|7000|by|320000|km|mi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt;—that is, about 80% of the distance to the [[Moon]]—which has changed primarily due to an intentional adjustment to prolong the spacecraft's useful life (see [[#Orbit adjusted|Orbit adjusted]] below).

This very high orbit allows the IBEX satellite to move out of the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] when making scientific observations. This extreme altitude is critical due to the amount of charged-particle interference that would occur while taking measurements within the magnetosphere. When within the magnetosphere of the Earth ({{convert|70000|km|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the satellite also performs other functions, including [[telemetry]] downlinks.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

== Launch ==
The IBEX satellite was mated to its [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus]] XL rocket at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], [[California]], and the combined vehicle was then suspended below the [[Lockheed L-1011]] ''[[Stargazer (aircraft)|Stargazer]]'' mother airplane and flown to [[Kwajalein Atoll]] in the Central [[Pacific Ocean]], a several-hours-long flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/launchingrockets/status/2008/elvstatus-20081003.html |title=Expendable Launch Vehicle Status Report |publisher=[[NASA]] |first=George |last=Diller |date=October 3, 2008 |id=ELV-100308}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stargazer'' arrived at Kwajalein on Sunday, October 12, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ibex/index.html |title=Interstellar Boundary Explorer Mission |publisher=NASA |date=October 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IBEX satellite was carried into space on October 19, 2008, by the Pegasus XL rocket. The rocket was released from ''Stargazer'', which took off from Kwajalein, at 17:47:23&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]].&lt;ref name="IBEX-MSC"/&gt; By launching from this site close to the [[Equator]], the Pegasus rocket lifted as much as {{convert|35|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on}} more mass to orbit than it would have with a launch from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ibex.swri.edu/archive/2006.11.shtml |title=Janet Ball, Lockheed Martin Space Systems |publisher=Southwest Research Institute |first=Dave |last=McComas |date=November 2006 |accessdate=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orbit adjusted ===
In June 2011 IBEX shifted to a new orbit that raised its perigee to more than {{convert|30000|km}}. The new orbit avoids taking the spacecraft too close to the Moon, whose gravity can negatively affect IBEX's orbit. Now the spacecraft uses less fuel to maintain a stable orbit, increasing its useful lifespan to more than 40 years.&lt;ref name="ibexnews201111"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ibex.swri.edu/archive/2011.11.14.shtml |title=IBEX Orbit-Raising Maneuver |publisher=Southwest Research Institute |first=Dave |last=McComas |date=November 14, 2011 |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBEX is collecting [[energetic neutral atom]] (ENA) emissions that are traveling through the Solar System to Earth that cannot be measured by conventional telescopes. These ENAs are created on the boundary of our Solar System by the interactions between [[solar wind]] particles and interstellar medium particles.&lt;ref name="ibex20091015"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ibex.swri.edu/archive/2009.10.15.shtml |title=First Science Results from IBEX! |publisher=Southwest Research Institute |first=Dave |last=McComas |date=October 15, 2009 |accessdate=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the average IBEX-Hi detects about 500 particles per day, and IBEX-Lo, less than 100.&lt;ref name="october12"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ibex.swri.edu/archive/2012.10.15.shtml |title=3 Years of IBEX Observations  |publisher=Southwest Research Institute |first=Dave |last=McComas |date=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, over 100 scientific papers related to IBEX were published, described by the [[Principal Investigator|PI]] as "an incredible scientific harvest".&lt;ref name=october12/&gt;

[[File:IBEX Heliotail Observations.ogg|thumb|300px|Animation illustrating IBEX's collection of data on neutral atoms at the boundary of the Solar System.]]

In October 2010, significant changes were detected in the ribbon after six months, based on the second set of IBEX observations.&lt;ref name="change"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.astrobio.net/topic/solar-system/outer-solar-system/the-ever-changing-edge-of-the-solar-system/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823162722/http://www.astrobio.net/topic/solar-system/outer-solar-system/the-ever-changing-edge-of-the-solar-system/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 23, 2014 |title=The Ever-Changing Edge of the Solar System |work=Astrobiology Magazine |date=October 2, 2010 |accessdate=November 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It went on to detect neutral atoms from outside the Solar System, which were found to differ in composition from the Sun.&lt;ref name="bow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ibex/news/nobowshock.html |title=IBEX Reveals a Missing Boundary At the Edge Of the Solar System |publisher=NASA |editor-first=Holly |editor-last=Zell |date=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, IBEX discovered that the heliosphere has no [[Bow shocks in astrophysics|bow shock]], and it measured its speed relative to the local [[interstellar medium]] (LISM) as {{convert|23.2|km/s|mph|abbr=on}}, improving on the previous measurement of {{convert|26.3|km/s|mph|abbr=on}} by ''[[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]]''.&lt;ref name="astrobites20120514"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://astrobites.org/2012/05/14/no-shocks-for-this-bow-ibex-says-were-wrong/ |title=No Shocks for This Bow: IBEX Says We're Wrong |work=Astrobites |first=Susanna |last=Kohler |date=May 14, 2012 |accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those speeds equate to 25% less pressure on the Sun's heliosphere than previously thought.&lt;ref name="bow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="astrobites20120514" /&gt;

In July 2013, IBEX results revealed a 4-lobed tail on the Solar System's heliosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-s-ibex-provides-first-view-of-the-solar-system-s-tail/ |title=NASA's IBEX Provides First View Of the Solar System's Tail |publisher=NASA |first=Karen C. |last=Fox |date=July 10, 2013 |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data transfer rate ==
Compared to other space observatories, IBEX has a low data transfer rate due to the limited requirements of the mission.&lt;ref name="ibexqanda"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ibex/IBEXQandA.html |title=IBEX Q and A |publisher=NASA |date=July 25, 2008 |accessdate=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... IBEX data transfer rates are slow compared with other telescopes due to the nature of the data it collects. IBEX does not need a "high speed" connection, since it only has the opportunity to collect up to a few particles per minute. Communication from the satellite to the ground is 20 times slower than a typical home cable modem (320,000 bits per second,) and from the ground to the satellite only 2,000 bits per second, which is 250 times slower! Once the signal is collected by the receivers on Earth it is carried over the internet to Mission Control Center in Dulles, VA and to the IBEX Science Operation Center in San Antonio, TX."|NASA's IBEX Q and A&lt;ref name="ibexqanda"/&gt;}}

'''Jacques Babinet''' ({{IPA-fr|babinɛ|lang}}; 5 March 1794 &amp;ndash; 21 October 1872) was a [[France|French]] [[physics|physicist]], mathematician, and astronomer who is best known for his contributions to [[optics]].
 
==Biography==
His father was Jean Babinet and mother, Marie‐Anne Félicité Bonneau du Chesn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |date=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58094.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Babinet started his studies at the Lycée Napoléon, but was persuaded to abandon a legal education for the pursuit of science. A graduate of the [[École Polytechnique]], which he left in 1812 for the Military School at [[Metz]], he was later a professor at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and at the [[Collège de France]]. In 1840, he was elected as a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie Royale des Sciences]]. He was also an astronomer of the [[Bureau des Longitudes]].

Among Babinet's accomplishments are the 1827 standardization of the [[Ångström]] unit for measuring light using the red Cadmium line's wavelength, and the principle ([[Babinet's principle]]) that similar diffraction patterns are produced by two complementary screens. He was the first to suggest using wavelengths of light to standardize measurements.  His idea was first used between 1960 and 1983, when a meter was defined as a [[wavelength]] of light from [[krypton]] gas.

Babinet was interested in the optical properties of minerals throughout his career.  He designed and created many scientific instruments utilized to determine crystalline structure and polarization properties, including the polariscope and an optical goniometer to measure refractive indices. The '''Babinet compensator''', an accessory useful in polarized light [[microscopy]], was built with twin, opposed quartz wedges having mutually perpendicular crystallographic axes, and is still widely employed in microscopy. This design avoids the problems inherent in the basic quartz wedge, where the zero reading coincides with the thin end of the wedge, which is often lost when grinding the plate during manufacture.

Expanding his fascination of diffraction to [[meteorology]], Babinet spent a significant amount of time in the study of rainbow optics. His astronomical research focused on [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury's]] mass and the Earth's magnetism, while his inventions included valve improvements for air pumps and a [[hygrometer]]. In [[geography]] and hydrogeomorphology, the [[Baer–Babinet law]] helps to explain and predict directionality in the course of rivers. Babinet's [[cartography]] work includes homalographic projections where the parallels are rectilinear and meridian lines are elliptical.

In addition to his brilliant lectures on meteorology and optics research, Babinet was also a great promoter of science, an amusing and clever lecturer, and a brilliant, entertaining and prolific author of popular scientific articles. He was beloved by many for his kindly and charitable nature.

==Family Life==
On October 30, 1820, Jacques Babinet was married to Adelaïde Laugier (July 14, 1795-July 27, 1849). They had two children: Charles Babinet (December 8, 1821-May 31 1907) and Léon Babinet (July 26, 1825-1913).

'''Jean-Frédéric Hermann''' (Strasbourg 1768–1793) was a [[France|French]] [[physician]] and [[naturalist]] mainly interested in [[entomology]].&lt;ref&gt;Guide des fonds patrimoniaux des bibliothèques d'Alsace  Daniel Bornemann - 1995 "On y trouve la collection de Jean Hermann (1738-1800), docteur en médecine et professeur d'histoire naturelle à Strasbourg, celle de Jean- Frédéric Hermann (1768-1793) son fils et celle de [[Frédéric-Louis Hammer]] (1762-1835), son gendre."&lt;/ref&gt;

Son of [[Jean Hermann]], he continued the index of his father’s collection, illustrating some species. He studied the comparative anatomy of the mouthparts of insects and mites publishing ''Mémoire aptérologique'' with his son in law [[Frédéric-Louis Hammer]] in 1804.

In [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]], the '''Kleene star''' (or '''Kleene operator''' or '''Kleene closure''') is a [[unary operation]], either on [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] of [[string (computer science)|strings]] or on sets of symbols or characters. In mathematics
it is more commonly known as the [[free monoid]] construction. The application of the Kleene star to a set ''V'' is written as ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. It is widely used for [[regular expression]]s, which is the context in which it was introduced by [[Stephen Kleene]] to characterize certain [[Automata theory|automata]], where it means "zero or more".

# If ''V'' is a set of strings, then ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is defined as the smallest [[superset]] of ''V'' that contains the [[empty string]] ε and is [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the [[concatenation|string concatenation operation]].
# If ''V'' is a set of symbols or characters, then ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is the set of all strings over symbols in ''V'', including the empty string ε.

The set ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; can also be described as the set of finite-length strings that can be generated by concatenating arbitrary elements of ''V'', allowing the use of the same element multiple times. If ''V'' is either the [[empty set]] ∅ or the singleton set {ε}, then ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = {ε}; if ''V'' is any other [[finite set]], then ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[countably infinite set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nayuki Minase |date=10 May 2011 |title=Countable sets and Kleene star |work=Project Nayuki |url=http://www.nayuki.io/page/countable-sets-and-kleene-star |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operators are used in [[rewrite rule]]s for [[generative grammar]]s.

== Definition and notation ==
Given a set ''V''
define
:''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {ε} (the language consisting only of the empty string),
:''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''V''
and define recursively the set
:''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = { ''wv'' : ''w'' ∈ ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''v'' ∈ ''V'' } for each ''i''&gt;0.

If ''V'' is a formal language, then ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, the ''i''-th power of the set ''V'', is a shorthand for the [[Concatenation#Concatenation of sets of strings|concatenation]] of set ''V'' with itself ''i'' times. That is, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be understood to be the set of all [[string (computer science)|strings]] that can be represented as the concatenation of ''i'' strings in ''V''. 

The definition of Kleene star on ''V'' is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ebbinghaus |first1=Heinz-Dieter |authorlink1=Heinz-Dieter Ebbinghaus |last2=Flum |first2=Jörg |last3=Thomas |first3=Wolfgang |doi= |date=1994 |title=Mathematical Logic |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-387-94258-0 |page=656 |url=https://www.springer.com/mathematics/book/978-0-387-94258-2 |quote=The '''Kleene closure''' ''L''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; of ''L'' is defined to be &lt;math&gt;\sideset{}{_{i=0}^\infty}\bigcup L^i&lt;/math&gt;.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V^*=\bigcup_{i \geq 0 }V_i = V_0 \cup V_1 \cup V_2 \cup V_3 \cup V_4 \cup \ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the Kleene star operator is an idempotent unary operator: (''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; for any set ''V'' of strings or characters.

== Kleene plus ==
In some [[formal language]] studies, (e.g. [[Abstract family of languages|AFL theory]]) a variation on the Kleene star operation called the ''Kleene plus'' is used. The Kleene plus omits the ''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; term in the above union. In other words, the Kleene plus on ''V'' is

:&lt;math&gt;V^+=\bigcup_{i \geq 1} V_i = V_1 \cup V_2 \cup V_3 \cup \ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

For every set ''L'', the Kleene plus of ''L'' (denoting ''L''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) equals the concatenation of ''L'' with ''L''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;; this holds because every element of ''L''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; must either be composed from one element of ''L'' and finitely many non-empty terms in ''L'' or is just an element of ''L'' (where ''L'' itself is retrieved by taking ''L'' concatenated with ε). 
Conversely, ''L''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = {ε} ∪ ''L''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Examples ==
Example of Kleene star applied to set of strings:
: {"ab","c"}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = { ε, "ab", "c", "abab", "abc", "cab", "cc", "ababab", "ababc", "abcab", "abcc", "cabab", "cabc", "ccab", "ccc", ...}.

Example of Kleene plus applied to set of characters:
: {"a", "b", "c"}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = { "a", "b", "c", "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc", "aaa", "aab", ...}.
Kleene star applied to the same character set:
: {"a", "b", "c"}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = { ε, "a", "b", "c", "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc", "aaa", "aab", ...}.

Example of Kleene star applied to the empty set:
:∅&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = {ε}.

Example of Kleene plus applied to the empty set:
:∅&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = ∅ ∅&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = { } = ∅,
where concatenation is an [[associative]] and [[noncommutative]] product, sharing these properties with the [[Cartesian product]] of sets.

Example of Kleene plus and Kleene star applied to the singleton set containing the empty string:
:If V = {ε}, then also ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = {ε} for each ''i'', hence V&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = V&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = {ε}.

== Generalization ==

Strings form a [[monoid]] with concatenation as the binary operation and ε the identity element.  The Kleene star is defined for any monoid, not just strings.
More precisely, let (''M'', ⋅) be a monoid, and ''S'' ⊆ ''M''.  Then ''S''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is the smallest submonoid of ''M'' containing ''S''; that is, ''S''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; contains the neutral element of ''M'', the set ''S'', and is such that if ''x'',''y'' ∈ ''S''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, then ''x''⋅''y'' ∈ ''S''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.

Furthermore, the Kleene star is generalized by including the *-operation (and the union) in the [[algebraic structure]] itself by the notion of [[complete star semiring]].&lt;Ref name="droste"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Droste |first1=M. |last2=Kuich |first2=W. |date=2009 |title=Handbook of Weighted Automata |chapter=Chapter 1: Semirings and Formal Power Series |series=Monographs in Theoretical Computer Science |publisher=Springer |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-01492-5_1 |isbn=978-3-642-01491-8 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[species]] in the [[legume]] [[tree]] [[genus]] '''''[[Albizia]]''''', the '''silk trees''', '''sirises''' or '''albizias'''.

Numerous species placed in ''Albizia'' by early authors were eventually moved to other genera, particularly ''[[Archidendron]]'' and many other [[Ingeae]], as well as certain [[Acacieae]], [[Mimoseae]], and even [[Caesalpinioideae]] and [[Faboideae]].&lt;ref name = ildis&gt;ILDIS (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The delimitation of ''[[Falcataria]]'' and ''[[Pithecellobium]]'' - close relatives of ''Albizia'' - is notoriously complex, with species having been moved between the genera time and again, and probably will continue to do so. Other closely related genera like ''[[Chloroleucon]]'' and ''[[Samanea]]'' are often merged with ''Albizia'' entirely.&lt;ref name = ildis /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11846">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Georgia''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law. The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL). 

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of November 13, 2014, there were 16 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Enivironmental Protection Agency |accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One additional site has been proposed for entry on the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt; Five sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9651">The '''Los Angeles School''' of Urbanism is an academic movement which emerged during the mid-1980s, loosely based at [[UCLA]] and the [[University of Southern California]], which centers urban analysis on [[Los Angeles, California]].

==History==
The first published identification of the Los Angeles (L.A.) School as such was by [[Mike Davis (scholar)|Mike Davis]] in his popular urban history of Los Angeles, ''[[City of Quartz]]'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Mike | last=Davis| pages=84| year=1990 | publisher=Verso | isbn= 978-1-84467-568-5 | nopp=true | title= City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Davis, the school emerged informally during the mid-1980s when an eclectic variety of [[neo-Marxist]] scholars began publishing a series of articles and books dealing exclusively with Los Angeles. During the school’s formation, Davis cautiously estimated that the school had about twenty members scattered throughout [[Southern California]] and beyond, with some members purportedly residing as far away as [[Frankfurt, Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Dear, Michael J (2002). "The Resistible Rise of the L.A. School" pp3-16 in Dear, Michael J. (ed.)''From Chicago to L.A.: Making Sense of Urban Theory''. Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Much of the work published by L.A. School members during the 1980s and early 1990s garnered considerable attention. However, while some members (e.g. [[Edward Soja]] and Mike Davis) became household names in urban theory, there was little consciousness of the school as its own entity, especially outside of Los Angeles. This changed in 1998, with the publication of an article by [[Michael J. Dear]] and Steven Flusty, which explicitly argued for the existence of a distinct L.A. School of Urbanism, of which its various theories, concepts, and empirical works could be pooled together to constitute a radical new conception of ‘postmodern urbanism.’&lt;ref&gt;Dear, Michael J. and Flusty, Steven (2000). “Postmodern Urbanism.” ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers.'' '''90'''(1): 50-72&lt;/ref&gt; After Dear and Flusty’s publication, Dear popularized the school&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Edward | last=Soja| year=2010 | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | isbn= 978-0-8166-6668-3| nopp=true | title= ''Seeking Spatial Justice'', pps.173-175}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the production of a series of articles and books, including a full-length edited volume comparing the L.A. School to the Chicago School.&lt;ref&gt;Dear, Michael J. (ed.); 2002; ''From Chicago to L.A.: Making Sense of Urban Theory''; Sage Publications&lt;/ref&gt; 
Though much of the work of the L.A. School is still widely read in urban studies, the school’s membership has declined substantially in recent years. At a retirement party for Soja in 2008 at which many purported  members were present, only Michael J. Dear appeared to be willing to envisage the school’s continued existence. This situation reflects the vital conceptual disagreements between members of the LA School, and especially between Dear and the other members.&lt;ref name="Halle"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halle|first=David|author2=Beveridge, Andrew |title=Changing Cities and Directions: New York and Los Angeles|journal=On-Line Working Paper Series, California Center for Population Research, UC Los Angeles|date=12-01-2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
There is no official list of present or historic members of the Los Angeles School of Urbanism. Some thinkers who are commonly considered members include:
*[[Michael Dear]]
*[[Mike Davis (scholar)|Mike Davis]]
*[[Allen J Scott]]
*[[Edward Soja]]
*[[Michael Storper]]
*[[Jennifer Wolch]]

==Ideas==
The L.A. School has no official doctrine, and there is great diversity in the works of its various members. Nevertheless, there are several influences, themes, and concepts which are relatively consistent in the school’s scholarship. 
Perhaps the central characteristic of the thought of the L.A. School is a sustained focus on Los Angeles in both empirical and theoretical work, often with the underlying claim that L.A. is the paradigmatic American metropolis of the 20th and 21st centuries.&lt;ref name="Curry "&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curry|first=James|author2=Kenney, Martin |title=The Paradigmatic City: Postindustrial Illusion and the Los Angeles School|journal=Antipode|year=1999| volume=31|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.1111/1467-8330.00089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Monahan, Torin. | year = 2002 | title = Los Angeles Studies: The Emergence of a Specialty Field | journal = City &amp; Society | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 155–184 | url = http://publicsurveillance.com/papers/LA_Studies.pdf | format = pdf | doi=10.1525/city.2002.14.2.155}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than this, the L.A. School poses a challenge to, what many members see as, the dominant [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] of Urbanism.&lt;ref&gt;Dear, Michael J and Dahmann, Nicolas (2008). “Urban Politics and the Los Angeles School of Urbanism.” ''Urban Affairs Review.'' '''44'''(2): 266-279&lt;/ref&gt; While the Chicago School presents a [[modernist]] theory of cities as based on social darwinist struggles for urban space, the Los Angeles School proposes a [[postmodern]] or [[postfordist]] vision. While not all members of the L.A. School identify as postmodernists, and in fact some (e.g. Mike Davis)&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Mike (1985). “Urban Renaissance and the Spirit of Postmodernism” New Left Review. I/151&lt;/ref&gt; are against the very concept, a focus on [[postmodernism]] is fundamental to many members of the L.A. School, who rely heavily upon theorists associated with postmodernism, such as [[Baudrillard]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Frederic Jameson|Jameson]], and [[Derrida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Edward | last=Soja| year=1990 | publisher=Verso | isbn= 0-86091-936-6 | nopp=true | title= Postmodern Geographies: The Reassertion of Space in Critical Social Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Michael J. | last=Dear| year=2001 | publisher=Blackwell | isbn= 0-631-20988-3 | nopp=true | title= The Postmodern Urban Condition }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A further stream of work emerging from the LA School is represented by Scott and Storper's many publications on flexible specialization, agglomeration, and the economic dynamics of the contemporary metropolis. Scott and Storper's work differs from that of Dear and Soja by approaching urban theory from the perspective of [[postfordism]] rather than postmodernism. Scott and Storper represent one distinctive tendency in the LA School; Dear and Soja represent another.

==Criticism==
A number of criticisms have been raised against the Los Angeles School. Perhaps the most important of these is skepticism over the school’s actual importance relative to its claims. For instance, one criticism is that its literature sometimes deceptively excludes discussions or citations of other important works on urban issues, to give readers the impression that the L.A. school is more radical, original, and important than it actually is. In particular, some critics think that the contemporary importance of the Chicago School is grossly overstated by L.A. theorists, and that little to no attention is allocated to extremely important scholarly materials produced in the period between the decline of the Chicago School and the emergence of the L.A. School, particularly the work of Marxist urban theorists like [[Manuel Castells]], [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], and [[Henri Lefebvre]].&lt;ref&gt;Gottdiener, Mark.; Urban Analysis as Merchandising: The ‘LA School’ and the Understanding of Metropolitan Development’ pp157-181 in Eade, John and Mele, Christopher (eds.) (2008). ''Urban Analysis as Merchandising: The “LA School” and the Understanding of Metropolitan Development''. Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; On a similar vein, much of the work of the L.A. School has been criticized for its incoherence and lack of a demonstrable methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Sui, Daniel Z (1999). Postmodern Urbanism Disrobed: or Why Postmodern Urbanism is a Dead End for Urban Geography. ''Urban Geography'' '''20'''(5): 403-411.&lt;/ref&gt;
A final criticism questions the L.A. School’s fundamental claim that Los Angeles should be considered the paradigmatic postmodern American city. This stems both from external comparisons which have been made between Los Angeles and other cities,&lt;ref&gt;Nijman, Jan (2000). The Paradigmatic City. ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'' '''90'''(1): 135-145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, Nicholas A (2010).“Lost in Dialectic: A Critical Introduction to Urban Space in Greater Hartford, 1633-2010.” Undergraduate Honors Thesis, Trinity College, CT. {{cite web |url=https://www.trincoll.edu/NR/rdonlyres/5D63F612-3C18-4A87-AAAB-1290D1FF0308/0/Bacon_Dialectic.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528143853/http://www.trincoll.edu/NR/rdonlyres/5D63F612-3C18-4A87-AAAB-1290D1FF0308/0/Bacon_Dialectic.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-28 |df= }} pp.32-55.&lt;/ref&gt; and findings that in certain cases urban phenomena in Los Angeles do not match those of other American cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jason | last=Hackworth| year=2006 | publisher=Cornell University Press | isbn= 978-0-8014-7303-6| nopp=true | title= ''The Neoliberal City'', p.81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7116">'''Ocean deoxygenation''' is the expansion of [[oxygen minimum zone]]s in the world's [[oceans]] as a consequence of [[carbon emissions|anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide]].{{ref|stramma}}{{ref|Mora}} The change has been fairly rapid and poses a threat to fish and other types of marine life, as well as to people who depend on marine life for nutrition or livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/04/oceans-suffocating-dead-zones-oxygen-starved Oceans suffocating as huge dead zones quadruple since 1950, scientists warn] The Guardian, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Oceanographers and others have discussed what phrase best describes the phenomenon to non-specialists. Among the options considered have been '''ocean suffocation''' (which was used in a news report from May 2008{{ref|deadzone}}), "ocean oxygen deprivation",{{ref|name}} "decline in ocean oxygen", "marine deoxygenation", "ocean oxygen depletion" and "ocean [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]]".

==Implications==
Ocean deoxygenation poses implications for [[Primary production|ocean productivity]], nutrient cycling, [[carbon cycling]], and [[marine habitats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/scientists-say-oceans-are-rapidly-losing-oxygen/3313942.html|title=Scientists: Oceans Rapidly Losing Oxygen|first=George|last=Putic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://weather.com/science/environment/news/global-warming-starving-west-coast-waters-of-oxygen|title=Global Warming Is Starving West Coast Waters of Oxygen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the excess heat from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gas emissions is absorbed by the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;Levitus, Sydney, et al. "Warming of the world ocean." Science 287.5461 (2000): 2225–2229&lt;/ref&gt; Warmer oceans cause deoxygenation both because oxygen is less soluble in warmer water,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ysi.com/File%20Library/Documents/Technical%20Notes/DO-Oxygen-Solubility-Table.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and through temperature driven stratification of the ocean which inhibits the production of oxygen from photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;"Climate-driven trends in contemporary ocean productivity." Nature 444.7120 (2006): 752–755&lt;/ref&gt;

The ocean surface stratifies as the atmosphere and ocean warms causing ice melt and glacial runoff. This results in a less salty and therefore a less dense layer that floats on top.&lt;ref&gt;Sigman, Daniel M., Samuel L. Jaccard, and Gerald H. Haug. "Polar ocean stratification in a cold climate." Nature 428.6978 (2004): 59–63&lt;/ref&gt; Also the warmer waters themselves are less dense. This stratification inhibits the upwelling of nutrients (the ocean constantly recycles its nutrients) into the upper layer of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Arrigo, Kevin R., et al. "Phytoplankton community structure and the drawdown of nutrients and CO 2 in the Southern Ocean." Science 283.5400 (1999): 365–367. Behrenfeld, Michael J., et al. "Climate-driven trends in contemporary ocean productivity." Nature 444.7120 (2006): 752–755&lt;/ref&gt; This is where the majority of oceanic photosynthesis (such as by phytoplankton) occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Cermeño, Pedro, et al. "The role of nutricline depth in regulating the ocean carbon cycle." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 105.51 (2008): 20344-20349&lt;/ref&gt; This decrease in nutrient supply is likely to decrease rates of photosynthesis in the surface ocean, which is responsible for approximately half of the oxygen produced globally.&lt;ref&gt;Cermeño, Pedro, et al. "The role of nutricline depth in regulating the ocean carbon cycle." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 105.51 (2008): 20344-20349&lt;/ref&gt; Increased stratification can also decrease the supply of oxygen to the interior of the ocean. Warmer waters also increase the metabolism of marine organisms,&lt;ref&gt;Gillooly, James F., et al. "Effects of size and temperature on metabolic rate." science 293.5538 (2001): 2248–2251&lt;/ref&gt; leading to increased respiration rates. In the surface ocean, increased respiration will likely lead to lower net oxygen production, and thus less oxygen transferred to the atmosphere. In the interior ocean, the combination of increased respiration and decreased oxygen supply from surface waters can draw oxygen down to hypoxic or anoxic levels. Not only are low levels of oxygen lethal to fish and other upper trophic level species, they can change the microbially mediated cycling of globally important elements such as nitrogen; nitrate replaces oxygen as the primary microbial electron acceptor at very low oxygen concentrations. All this, increased demand on herbivores, decreased nutrient supply, decreased dissolved oxygen, etc., result in catastrophic food web mismatches.&lt;ref&gt;Nagelkerken Global alteration of ocean ecosystem functioning due to increasing human CO2 emissions, PNAS vol. 112 no. 43, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldenberg, Silvan U., et al. "Boosted food web productivity through ocean acidification collapses under warming." Global Change Biology (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocean model simulations predict a decline of up to 7% in the global ocean O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content over the next hundred years. The decline of [[oxygen]] is projected to continue for a thousand years or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|volume=2|pages=199–229|doi=10.1146/annurev.marine.010908.163855|pmid=21141663|year=2010|authors=Ralph F.

In [[R&amp;D management]] and [[systems development]], '''open coopetition'''  or '''open-coopetition''' is a [[neologism]] to describe cooperation among competitors in the open-source arena.The term was first coined by the scholars Jose Teixeira and Tingting Lin to describe how rival firms that, while competing with similar products in the same markets (e.g., [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Samsung]], [[Google]], [[Nokia]]), collaborate which each other in the development of open-source projects (e.g., [[Webkit]]).&lt;ref name="TeixeiraAndLin2014"&gt;{{cite conference| author1=Jose Teixeira|author2=Lin Tingting|title=Collaboration in the open-source arena: The WebKit case|conference=52nd ACM conference on Computers and people research|book-title=ACM SIGMIS CPR 2014|date=2014|location=Singapore|pages=121–129|doi=10.1145/2599990.2600009|arxiv=1401.5996|publisher=ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open-coopetition is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound-word]] term bridging [[coopetition]] and [[Open-source software|open-source]]. [[Coopetition]] refers to a paradoxical relationship between two or more actors simultaneously involved in cooperative and competitive interactions;&lt;ref name="BengtssonANDKock2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Maria Bengtsson|author2=Sören Kock|title=Coopetition" in business Networks - to cooperate and compete simultaneously|journal=Industrial marketing management|date=2000|volume=29|issue=5|pages=411–426|doi=10.1016/S0019-8501(99)00067-X|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BengtssonANDKock2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Maria Bengtsson|author2=Sören Kock|title=Coopetition—Quo vadis?

[[File:Integrating open-coopetition in practice.svg|Integrating open-coopetition in practice|thumb| alt= open-coopetition in practice maximizes transparency | upright=1.25| Situating open-coopetition in practice.]]

Such intertwined behavior of cooperation and competition in an [[Open-source software|open-source]] way, emphasizes [[Transparency (behavior)#Technology|transparency on the development of technological artifacts]] that become available to the public under an [[open-source license]]—allowing anyone to freely obtain, study, modify and redistribute them. Within open-coopetition, [[Transparency (behavior)#Technology|development transparency]] and [[sense of community]] are maximized; while the [[Control (management)|managerial control]] and [[Intellectual property|IP enforcement]] are minimized. Open-coopetitive relationships are paradoxical as the core managerial concepts of property, contract and price play an outlier role.

The [[Openness|openness characteristic]] of open-source projects also distinguishes open-coopetition from other forms of [[Strategic alliance|cooperative arrangements]] by its inclusiveness: Everybody can contribute.  Users or other contributors do not need to hold a supplier contract or sign a legal [[intellectual property]] arrangement to contribute. Moreover, neither to be a member of a particular firm or affiliated with a particular [[joint venture]] or [[consortia]] to be able to contribute. In the words of [[Massimo Banzi]], "You don't need anyone's permission to make something great".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Banzi|first1=Massimo|title=How Arduino is open-sourcing imagination @ TEDGlobal 2012|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/massimo_banzi_how_arduino_is_open_sourcing_imagination?language=en#t-1202|website=ted.com|publisher=TED|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===2008===

In a large-scale study involving multiple European-based software intensive firms, the scholars Pär Ågerfalk and Brian Fitzgerald revealed a shift from "[[Open-source software|open-source]]  as a community of individual developers to [[Open-source software|open-source]] as a community of commercial organizations, primarily small and medium-sized enterprises, operating as a symbiotic ecosystem in a spirit of [[coopetition]]".&lt;ref name="Agerfalk_and_Fitzgeral2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pär Ågerfalk|author2=Brian Fitzgerald| title=Outsourcing to an Unknown Workforce: Exploring Opensorcing as a Global Sourcing Strategy| journal=MIS Quarterly|date=2008|doi=10.2307/25148845 |publisher=Management Information Systems Research Center, University of Minnesota|volume=32|issue=2|pages=385–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even if they were exploring [[Open-sourcing|opensourcing]] as "a novel and unconventional approach to global sourcing and [[coopetition]]", they captured the following quote that highlights that competition in the open-source arena is not as in business as usual. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 "In a traditional market you don't call up your competitor and be like, oh, well tell me what your stuff
 does. But in open source you do." [Open Source Program Director, at [[IONA Technologies|IONA]]] &lt;ref name="Agerfalk_and_Fitzgeral2008"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===2012===

Also in the academic world, and after following an [[software company]] based in Norway for over five years, and while theorizing on the concept of [[software ecosystem]], the academic Geir K. Hanssen noted that the characteristic networks of an [[software ecosystem]], open-source or proprietary ones, can embed competing organizations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Software ecosystems have a networked character. CSoft and its external environment constitute a network of customers and
third party organizations. Even competitors may be considered a part of this network, although this aspect has not been studied
in particular here."&lt;ref name="Hanssen2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Geir K.

In an opinion article entitled Open Source Coopetition Fueled by Linux Foundation Growth, the journalist and market analyst Jay Lyman highlights that "working with direct rivals may have been unthinkable 10 years ago, but  [[Linux]], [[Open Source Software|open-source]] and organizations such as [[Linux Foundation|the Linux Foundation]]  have highlighted how solving common problems and easing customer pain and friction in using and choosing different technologies can truly drive innovation and traction in the market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lyman|first1=Jay|title=Open Source Coopetition Fueled by LF Growth|url=http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/74624.html|accessdate=18 March 2015|publisher=LinuxInsider @ ECT News Network|date=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "open source coopetition" was employed to highlight the role of the [[Linux Foundation]] as a mediator of collaboration among rival firms.

At the OpenStack summit in [[Hong Kong]], the co-founder of [[Mirantis]]  Boris Renski talked about his job on figuring out how to co-opete in the crowded OpenStack open-source community. In a 43-minute broadcast video, Boris Renski shed some light on OpenStack coopetition politics and shared a subjective view on strategies of individual players within the OpenStack community (e.g., [[Rackspace]], [[Mirantis]], [[IBM]], [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise|HP]] and [[Red Hat]] among others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Along with this lines, the pioneering scholarly work of Germonprez et al. (2013)&lt;ref name="Germonprez_et_al2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Matt Germonprez |author2=  J. Allen | author3= Jamie Hill| author4= Glenn McClements  |title=Open source communities of competitors|journal= interactions|date=2013|pages=54--49|doi=10.1145/2527191|publisher=ACM|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported on how key business actors within the financial services industry that traditionally viewed [[Open-source software movement|open-source software]] with skepticism,  tied up an [[Open-source software movement|open-source]] ‘community of competitors’.  By taking the case of  [http://www.openmama.org/ OpenMAMA], a [[Middleware]]    Agnostic Messaging   [[API]] used by some of the world’s largest financial players,  they show that corporate market rivals (e.g., [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Bank of America]], [[IBM]] and [[BMC Software|BMC]]) can coexist in [[Open-source software movement|open-source communities]],   and intentionally coordinate activities or mutual benefits in precise, market focused,     and non-differentiating engagements.  Their work pointed out that high-competitive capital-oriented industries do not epitomize the traditional and grassroots idea that [[Open-source software movement|open-source software]] was originally born from. Furthermore, they argued that [[Open-source software movement|open-source communities]] can be deliberately designed to include competing vendors and customers under neutral institutional structures (e.g., foundations and steering committees).

=== 2014 ===
In an academic paper entitled "Collaboration in the open-source arena: The WebKit case", the scholars Jose Teixeira and Tingting Lin executed an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] informed [[social network analysis]] on the development of the [[WebKit]] [[Open Source Software|open-source]] [[Web navigation|web browsing]] technologies. Among a set of the reported findings, they pointed out that even if [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Samsung]] were involved in expensive patent wars in the courts at the time, they still collaborated in the open-source arena. As some of the research results did not confirm prior research in [[coopetition]],&lt;ref name="BengtssonANDKock2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BengtssonANDKock2014"/&gt; the authors proposed and coined the "open-coopetition" term while emphasizing the [[openness]] of collaborating with competitors in the [[Open-source software|open-source]] arena.&lt;ref name="TeixeiraAndLin2014"/&gt;

By turning to [[OpenStack]], the scholars Teixeira et al. (2015)&lt;ref name="teixeira_et_al2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Jose Teixeira |author2=  Gregorio Robles | author3= Jesús M. González-Barahona |title=Lessons learned from applying social network analysis on an industrial Free/Libre/Open Source Software ecosystem|journal= Journal of Internet Services and Applications|date=2015|doi=10.1186/s13174-015-0028-2|publisher=Springer|doi-access=free|arxiv=1507.04587}}&lt;/ref&gt;
went further and modeled and analyzed both collaborative and competitive networks from the [[OpenStack]] open-source project (a large and complex [[cloud computing]] infrastructure for [[big data]]).  Somewhat surprising results point out that competition for the same [[revenue model]] (i.e., operating conflicting business models) does not necessarily affect collaboration within the [[OpenStack|OpenStack ecosystem]]—in other words, competition among firms did not significantly influence collaboration among software developers affiliated with them. Furthermore, the expected social tendency of developers to work with developers from same firm (i.e., [[homophily]]) did not hold within the [[OpenStack|OpenStack ecosystem]]. The case of [[OpenStack]] revealed to be much about genuine collaboration in software development besides ubiquitous competition among the firms that produce and use the software.

&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the [[Apache Hadoop]] ecosystem in a quantitative longitudinal case study to investigate changing stakeholder influence and collaboration patterns. They found that the collaborative network had a quite stable number of network components (i.e., number of [[Community structure|sub-communities]] within the community) with many unconnected stakeholders. Furthermore, such components were dominated by a core set of stakeholders that engaged in most of the collaborative relationships. As in [[OpenStack]], there was much cooperation among competing and non-competing actors within the [[Apache Hadoop]] ecosystem—or in other words, firms with competing [[business models]] collaborate as openly as non-rivaling firms. Finally, they also 
argued that the openness of software ecosystems decreases the distance to competitors within the same ecosystem, it becomes possible and important to track what the competitors do within. Knowing about their existing collaborations, contributions, and interests in specific features offer valuable information about the competitors’ strategies and tactics.

In a study addressing coopetition in the [[cloud computing]] industry, Teixeira et al.&lt;ref name="teixeira_et_al_icis2016"&gt;
{{cite conference |title=Cooperation among competitors in the open-source arena: The case of OpenStack | author1=Jose Teixeira | author2= Salman Mian | author3=Ulla Hytti |publisher= AIS |book-title= ICIS 2016 | location=Dublin, Ireland  |conference= 37th International Conference on Information Systems| arxiv=1612.09462|bibcode=2016arXiv161209462T}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed not only coopetition among individuals and organizations but also among [[business networks|cohesive inter-organizational networks]]. Relationships among individuals were modeled and visualized in 2D longitudinal visualizations and relationships among [[business networks|inter-organizational networks]] (e.g., alliances, consortium or ecosystem) were modeled and visualized in 3D longitudinal visualizations. The author added evidence to prior research&lt;ref name="BengtssonANDKock2014"/&gt; suggesting that competition is a [[Multilevel model|multi-level phenomenon]] that is influenced by individual-level, organizational-level, and network-level factors.

By noting that many firms engaging into open-coopetition actively manage multiple portfolios of [[Strategic alliance|alliances]] in the software industry (i.e., many strategically contribute to multiple [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[software ecosystem]]s) and by analyzing the co-evolution of [[OpenStack]] and the [[CloudStack]] [[cloud computing]] platforms,  the same authors propose that development transparency and the weak intellectual property rights, two well-known characteristics of [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[Software ecosystem|ecosystems]], allow an easier transfer of information and resources from one [[Strategic alliance|alliance]] to another.  Even if openness enables a focal firm to transfer information and resources more easily between multiple [[Strategic alliance|alliancess]], such  'ease of transfer'  should not be seen as a source of [[competitive advantage]] as competitors can do the same.

=== 2017 ===

In a study explicitly addressing coopetition in [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[software ecosystem]]s, Nguyen Duc et al. (2017)&lt;ref name="duc_et_al2017"&gt;
{{cite conference |url=https://link.springer.com/conference/icsob |title=Coopetition of software firms in open source software ecosystems |author1= Anh Nguyen Duc|author2=Daniela Cruzes S.|author3=Geir Hanssen K.|author4=Pekka Abrahamsson| author5= Terje Snarby|date= 2017 |publisher= Springer |book-title=ICSOB 2017 |pages= |location= Essen, Germany |conference= 8th International Conference on Software Business}}
&lt;/ref&gt; identified a number of situations in which different actors within the [[software ecosystem]] deal with collaborative-competitive issues:

* Central actors that act as a bridge between the community and the companies contributing to it (e.g., a [[Lead programmer|lead developer]] or a [[Software maintainer|maintainer]]) need to act as gatekeepers (aka [[Boundary spanning|boundary spanners]]) for bugs reported against specific products sold by the participating firms. As the software is integrated [[Downstream (software development)|downstream]] into specific products often sold by competing firms, it matters to sort out what bugs are the responsibility of a specific firm or the community as a whole. In parallel, such 'bridging' actors also act as gatekeepers in flows of code and information  (e.g., what code should, or should not, be included in the official [[Release early, release often|community-releases]] and what information should circulate among the ecosystem participants).
* Contributors affiliated with firms need to balance the interests of their employers with the interests of the community as a whole. Therefore, their work encompasses the filtering of what is to be kept private (hidden and/or property of the firm)  or what is to be open (transparent and publicly-available under the open-source community terms). Such filtering is impacted by many factors that can range from technical, legal, bureaucratic, as well as organizational strategy issues. &lt;!-- control different policies is challenging as point out by jarben ppa and ann --&gt; .

Competitive behavior within [[Open-source software development|open-source software ecosystems]] frictions with the more purist view of [[free and open-source software]]. The same authors reported on some working practices that conflict with the more traditional values of [[free and open-source software]].
 
* Developers occasionally establish private communication channels. Some open-source purists would prefer that all communication remains transparent and publicly available to the overall community.
* Developers limit sensitive information to certain partners.  While purists would prefer all relevant information to remain available to all ecosystem participants, legal or security issues are often discussed in private and secure communication channels.

The same study also unfolded a number of benefits that organization can rip by actively contributing to [[Open-source software development|open-source software ecosystems]] that encompass both cooperative and competitive relationships: 
* '''Keeping the differences between their packaged software and the upstream software to a minimum'''. This allows firms to more easily benefit from the newest developments in the community. By implementing an [[Upstream (software development)|upstream]] first policy,  organizations can more easily catch updates, fixes, and changes from [[Upstream (software development)|upstream]]. 
* '''Sharing maintenance responsibilities'''. Organizations working only [[Downstream (software development)|downstream]] (i.e., just taking the software without contributing back) become solely responsible for maintaining their solution without the benefit of the overall community. 
* '''Reducing maintenance costs by revealing their own developments'''. If organizations extensively modify the software and opt to close some parts (keep it private or obfuscated) they will need to maintain such closed parts by themselves in the future without the benefit of the overall community. &lt;!-- avoid duplication of efforts and get all the community working together on improving a single set of patches avoid later having to rework changes that are incompatible with the latest software version. --&gt; 
* '''Faster integration of new contributions'''. Active contributors will get their work integrated [[Upstream (software development)|upstream]] more easily due to an improved social position within the community.
* '''Receiving help'''.  Active contributors with an improved social position within the community are more likely to benefit from the help from others members in the community.  Given the complex nature of software development, help from other members in the ecosystem can be very valuable.
* '''A sense of friendly competitiveness'''.  Besides being competitors, the ecosystem participants develop a [[sense of community]]. Developers employed by competing firms can perceive others as partners and/or friends rather than competitors.  In their work, developers often think of others as developers, partners or colleagues (individual persons) over the firms that they are representing.
* '''Mutual [[co-creation]] of value'''. Even if many of competing firms are competitors they are often also customers/suppliers of each other. Furthermore, they might be competing in different geographical areas or different business domains creating a heterogeneous and [[Heterophily|heterophilous]] environment for reciprocal learning and value [[co-creation]]. Given the complex nature of software development, value creation should benefit from the involvement of multiple and heterogeneous actors holding complementary skills and resources.

== Cases ==

Cases of [[open-coopetition]] are recurrent in the [[software industry]] in general. Furthermore, some cases exist also in the [[Consumer electronics|electronics]], [[Semiconductor industry|semiconductors]], [[automotive industry|automotive]], [[Financial services|financial]], [[Telecommunications industry|telecommunications]], [[retail]], [[education]], [[Healthcare industry|healthcare]], [[Arms industry|defense]], [[Aerospace manufacturer|aerospace]], and [[3D printing|additive manufacturing]] industries. Cases of [[open-coopetition]] are often associated with high-tech corporations and startups based in the USA (predominantly on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]). Cases can be also recognized in Cuba, Brazil,  Europe (predominantly on [[Western Europe]]),  India, South-Korea,  China, Vietnam, Australia, and Japan.

Many of the software projects encompassing [[open-coopetition]] are legally governed by [http://flossfoundations.org/foundation-directory foundations] such as the [[Linux Foundation]], the [[Free Software Foundation]], the [[Apache Software Foundation]], the [[Eclipse Foundation]], the [[Cloud Native Computing Foundation]], and the [[X.Org Foundation]] among many others.  Most of the [[Linux Foundation]] [https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/ collaborative projects] are coopetitive in nature --- the [[Linux Foundation]] claims to be "a neutral home for collaborative development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/ |title= Projects - The Linux Foundation |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;  | website= Linux Foundation |publisher= |access-date=  11 Oct 2017|quote=...&amp;nbsp;hosting your project at The Linux Foundation, a neutral home for collaborative development.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many coopetitive open-source projects dealing with both software and hardware (e.g., [[computer graphics]], [[Computer data storage|data storage]]) are bounded by [[Standards organization|standard organizations]] such as the [[Khronos Group]], [[W3C]] and the [[Open Compute Project]].

The '''phlogiston theory''' is a [[Superseded scientific theories|superseded scientific theory]] that postulated that a fire-like element called '''phlogiston''' is contained within combustible bodies and released during [[combustion]]. The name comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:phlogiston|φλογιστόν]] ''phlogistón'' (''burning up''), from [[wikt:φλόξ|φλόξ]] ''phlóx'' (''flame''). It was first stated in 1667 by [[J. J. Becher|Johann Joachim Becher]], and then put together more formally by [[Georg Ernst Stahl]].  The theory attempted to explain processes such as [[combustion]] and [[rust]]ing, which are now collectively known as [[redox|oxidation]].

==Theory==
Phlogiston theory states that ''phlogisticated'' substances are substances that contain phlogiston and ''dephlogisticate'' when burned.  Dephlogisticating is the process of releasing stored phlogiston, which is absorbed by the air. Growing plants then absorb this phlogiston, which is why air does not spontaneously combust and also why plant matter burns as well as it does.

Thus phlogiston accounted for combustion via a process that was opposite to that of the [[Antoine Lavoisier#Oxygen theory of combustion|oxygen theory]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;In general, substances that burned in air were said to be rich in phlogiston; the fact that combustion soon ceased in an enclosed space was taken as clear-cut evidence that air had the capacity to absorb only a finite amount of phlogiston. When air had become completely phlogisticated it would no longer serve to support combustion of any material, nor would a metal heated in it yield a calx; nor could phlogisticated air support life.  Breathing was thought to take phlogiston out of the body.&lt;ref&gt;James Bryan Conant, ed. ''The Overthrow of Phlogiston Theory: The Chemical Revolution of 1775&amp;ndash;1789''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press (1950), 14. {{OCLC|301515203}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Joseph Black]]'s student [[Daniel Rutherford]] discovered [[nitrogen]] in 1772 and the pair used the theory to explain his results. The residue of air left after burning, in fact a mixture of nitrogen and [[carbon dioxide]], was sometimes referred to as ''phlogisticated air,'' having taken up all of the phlogiston. Conversely, when [[Joseph Priestley]] discovered [[oxygen]], he believed it to be ''dephlogisticated air,'' capable of combining with more phlogiston and thus supporting combustion for longer than ordinary air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceship-earth.de/Biograph/Priestley.htm#4A4FW |title=Priestley, Joseph |publisher=Spaceship-earth.de |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302094050/http://spaceship-earth.de/Biograph/Priestley.htm#4A4FW |archivedate=2009-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of phlogiston theory==
[[Empedocles]] had formulated the  [[Classical elements|classical theory]] that there were four elements: water, earth, fire and air, and [[Aristotle]] reinforced this idea by characterising them as moist, dry, hot and cold. Fire was thus thought of as a substance and burning was seen as a process of decomposition which applied only to compounds. Experience had shown that burning was not always accompanied by a loss of material and a better theory was needed to account for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ladenburg|first=Dr. A|title=Lectures on the History of Chemistry|page=4|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924012386987#page/n22|accessdate=Aug 26, 2016|year=1911|publisher=U of Chicago Press|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Johann Joachim Becher ===
In 1667, [[J. J. Becher|Johann Joachim Becher]] published his book ''Physica subterranea'', which contained the first instance of what would become the phlogiston theory. In his book, Becher eliminated fire, water, and air from the classical element model and replaced them with three forms of earth: ''terra lapidea'', ''terra fluida'', and ''terra pinguis''.&lt;ref name="morris2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-V9jM4FkUacC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Making modern science: A historical survey|last=Bowler|first=Peter J|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2005|location=Chicago|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becher, ''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k84226t Physica Subterranea]'' p. 256 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Terra pinguis'' was the element that imparted [[oil]]y, [[Sulfur|sulphurous]], or combustible properties.&lt;ref name="brock2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Norton history of chemistry|last=Brock|first=William Hodson|publisher=W. W. Norton|year=1993|isbn=0-393-03536-0|edition=1st American|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Becher believed that ''terra pinguis'' was a key feature of combustion and was released when combustible substances were burned.&lt;ref name="morris2" /&gt; Becher did not have much to do with phlogiston theory as we know it now, but he had a large influence on his student Stahl. Becher's main contribution was the start of the theory itself, however much it was changed after him.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Phlogiston Theory|last=White|first=John Henry|publisher=AMS Press Inc.|year=1973|isbn=0404069304|location=Ney York, N.Y.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Becher's idea was that combustible substances contain an ignitable matter, the ''terra pinguis.'' &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Source Book in Chemistry|last=Leicester|first=Henry M.|last2=Klickstein|first2=Herbert S.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1965|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Georg Ernst Stahl. Line engraving, 1715. Wellcome V0005595.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georg Ernst Stahl]]]]

=== Georg Ernst Stahl ===
In 1703 [[Georg Ernst Stahl]], professor of medicine and chemistry at [[University of Halle|Halle]], proposed a variant of the theory in which he renamed Becher's ''terra pinguis'' to ''phlogiston'', and it was in this form that the theory probably had its greatest influence.&lt;ref name="Mason2"&gt;Mason, Stephen F., (1962). ''A History of the Sciences'' (revised edition). New York: Collier Books. Ch. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The term phlogiston itself was not something that Stahl invented. There is evidence that the word was used as early as 1606, and in a way that was very similar to what Stahl was using it for.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The term was derived from a Greek word meaning to inflame. The following paragraph describes Stahl's view of phlogiston:&lt;blockquote&gt;To Stahl, metals were compounds containing phlogiston in combination with metallic oxides (calces); on ignition the phlogiston was freed from the metal leaving the oxide behind. When the oxide was heated with a substance rich in phlogiston, such as charcoal, the calx again took up phlogiston and regenerated the metal. Phlogiston was a definite substance, the same in all its combinations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Stahl's first definition of phlogiston first appeared in his "Zymotechnia fundamentalis", published in 1697. His most quoted definition was found in the treatise on chemistry entitled "Fundamenta chymiae" in 1723.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Stahl, phlogiston was a substance that was not able to be put into a bottle, but could be transferred nonetheless. To him, wood was just a combination of ash and phlogiston, and making a metal was as simple as getting a metal [[calx]] and adding phlogiston.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Soot]] was almost pure phlogiston, which is why heating it with a metallic calx transforms the calx into the metal and Stahl attempted to prove that the phlogiston in soot and sulphur were identical by converting [[sulphate]]s to [[liver of sulphur]] using charcoal. He did not account for the increase in weight on combustion of tin and lead that were known at the time.{{sfn|Ladenburg|1911|pp=6-7}}

=== J. H. Pott ===
Johann Heinrich Pott, a student of one of Stahl's students, expanded the theory and attempted to [[Popular science|make it much more understandable to a general audience]]. He compared phlogiston to light or fire, saying that all three were substances whose natures were [[Tacit knowledge|widely understood but not easily defined]].  He thought that phlogiston should not be considered as a particle but as an essence that permeates substances, arguing that in a pound of any substance one could not simply pick out the particles of phlogiston.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Pott also observed the fact that when certain substances are burned they increase in mass instead of losing the mass of the phlogiston as it escapes; according to him, phlogiston was the basic fire principle and could not be obtained by itself.  Flames were considered to be a mix of phlogiston and water, while a phlogiston-and-earthy mixture could not burn properly.  Phlogiston permeating everything in the universe, it could be released as heat when combined with acid.  Pott proposed the following properties:
# The form of phlogiston consists of a circular movement around its axis.
# When homogeneous it can not be consumed or dissipated in fire.
# The reason it causes expansion in most bodies is unknown, but not accidental. It is proportional to the compactness of the texture of the bodies or to the intimacy of their constitution.
# The increase of weight during [[calcination]] is evident only after a long time, and is due either to the fact that the particles of the body become more compact, decrease the volume and hence increase the density as in the case of lead; or that little heavy particles of air become lodged in the substance as in the case of powdered zinc oxide.
# Air attracts the phlogiston of bodies.
# When set in motion, phlogiston is the chief active principle in nature of all inanimate bodies.
# It is the basis of colors.
# It is the principal agent in fermentation.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;
Pott's formulations proposed little new theory; he merely supplied further details and rendered existing theory more approachable to the common man.

=== Others ===
Johann Juncer also created a very complete picture of phlogiston. When reading Stahl's work, he assumed that phlogiston was in fact very material. He therefore came to the conclusion that phlogiston has the property of levity, or that it makes the compound that it is in much lighter than it would be without the phlogiston. He also showed that air was needed for combustion by putting substances in a sealed flask and trying to burn them.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

[[Guillaume-François Rouelle|Guillaume-Francois Rouelle]] brought the theory of phlogiston to France, and he was a very influential scientist and teacher so it gained quite a strong foothold very quickly. Many of his students became very influential scientists in their own right, Lavoisier included.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The French viewed phlogiston as a very subtle principle that vanishes in all analysis, yet it is in all bodies. Essentially they followed straight from Stahl's theory.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

[[Giovanni Antonio Giobert]] introduced Lavoisier's work in Italy. Giobert won a prize competition from the Academy of Letters and Sciences of Mantua in 1792 for his work refuting phlogiston theory.  He presented a paper at the Académie royale des Sciénces of Turin on March 18, 1792 entitled "Examen chimique de la doctrine du phlogistique et de la doctrine des pneumatistes par rapport à la nature de l 'eau" (translates roughly to Chemical examination of the doctrine of phlogiston and the doctrine of pneumatists in relation to the nature of water), which is considered the most original defense of Lavoisier's theory of water composition to appear in Italy.&lt;ref name="Abbri"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbri|first1=Ferdinando|title=GIOBERT, Giovanni Antonio|journal=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani (Biographical Dictionary of the Italians)|date=2001|volume=55|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giovanni-antonio-giobert_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenge and demise==
Eventually, quantitative [[experiment]]s revealed problems, including the fact that some metals gained mass when they burned, even though they were supposed to have lost phlogiston.
Some{{who|date=December 2017}} phlogiston proponents explained this by concluding that phlogiston had negative weight; others, such as [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau]], gave the more conventional argument that it was lighter than air. However, a more detailed analysis based on [[Archimedes' principle]], the densities of magnesium and its combustion product showed that just being lighter than air could not account for the increase in mass. Stahl himself did not address the problem of the metals that burn gaining weight, but those who followed his ideas and did not question his ideas were the ones that worked on this problem.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

During the eighteenth century, as it became clear that metals gained mass when they were oxidized, phlogiston was increasingly regarded as a ''principle'' rather than a material substance.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of how the term phlogiston was understood during the eighteenth century, see: James R Partington &amp; Douglas McKie; "Historical studies on the phlogiston theory"; ''Annals of Science'', 1937, '''2''', 361–404; 1938, '''3''', 1–58; and 337–71; 1939, '''5''', 113–49. Reprinted 1981 as {{ISBN|978-0-405-13895-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the eighteenth century, for the few chemists who still used the term phlogiston, the concept was linked to [[hydrogen]]. [[Joseph Priestley]], for example, in referring to the reaction of steam on iron, while fully acknowledging that the iron gains mass as it binds with oxygen to form a [[calx]], iron oxide, iron also loses "the basis of inflammable air ([[hydrogen]]), and this is the substance or principle, to which we give the name phlogiston."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Priestley; ''[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/phlogiston.html Considerations on the doctrine of phlogiston, and the decomposition of water]''; Philadelphia, Thomas Dobson, 1796; p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier’s]] description of oxygen as the ''oxidizing principle'' (hence its name, from Ancient Greek: oksús, “sharp;” génos, “birth,” referring to oxygen's supposed role in the formation of acids), Priestley described phlogiston as the ''alkaline principle.''&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Priestley; ''Heads of lectures on a course of experimental philosophy;'' London, Joseph Johnson, 1794.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phlogiston remained the dominant theory until the 1770s when [[Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier]] showed that combustion requires a gas that has mass (specifically, [[oxygen]]) and could be measured by means of weighing closed vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas W. Best, "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10698-015-9220-5 Lavoisier's 'Reflections on Phlogiston' I: Against Phlogiston Theory"], ''[[Foundations of Chemistry]]'', 2015, '''17''', 137-151.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The use of closed vessels also negated the buoyancy that had disguised the mass of the gases of combustion. These observations solved the mass paradox and set the stage for the new [[Antoine Lavoisier#Oxygen theory of combustion|oxygen theory]] of combustion.&lt;ref name="Ihde"/&gt;  [[Elizabeth Fulhame]] demonstrated through experiment that many [[Redox|oxidation reactions]] occur only in the presence of [[water]], that they directly involve water, and that water is regenerated and is detectable at the end of the reaction. Based on her experiments, she disagreed with some of the conclusions of Lavoisier as well as with the phlogiston theorists that he critiqued. Her book on the subject appeared in print soon after Lavoisier's execution for '''[[Ferme générale|Farm-General]]''' membership during the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rayner-Canham|first1=Marelene|last2=Rayner-Canham|first2=Geoffrey|title=Women in chemistry : their changing roles from alchemical times to the mid-twentieth century|date=2001|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0941901277|pages=28–31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S_NJ7AubQIcC&amp;pg=PA276|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Datta"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Datta|first1=N.

Experienced chemists who supported Stahl's phlogiston theory attempted to respond to the challenges suggested by Lavoisier and the newer chemists. In doing so, phlogiston theory became more complicated and assumed too much, contributing to the overall demise of the theory.&lt;ref name="Ihde"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ihde|first1=Aaron|title=The Development of Modern Chemistry|date=1964|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=New York|page=81|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many people tried to remodel their theories on phlogiston in order to have the theory work with what Lavoisier was doing in his experiments. [[Pierre Macquer]] reworded his theory many times, and even though he is said to have thought the theory of phlogiston was doomed, he stood by phlogiston and tried to make the theory work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Studies on the Phlogiston Theory|last=Partington|first=J.R.|last2=McKie|first2=Douglas|publisher=Arno Press|year=1981|isbn=0405138504|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''regulation school''' ({{lang-fr|l'école de la régulation}}) is a group of writers in political economy and economics whose origins can be traced to France in the early 1970s, where economic instability and [[stagflation]] were rampant in the French economy. The term  ''régulation'' was coined by Frenchman [[Destanne de Bernis]], who aimed to use the approach as a [[systems theory]] to bring [[Marxian economics|Marxian economic analysis]] up to date.&lt;ref name="school"&gt;''The Regulation School: A Critical Introduction'' (Columbia University Press, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; These writers are influenced by [[structural Marxism]], the [[Annales School]], [[Institutional economics|institutionalism]], [[Karl Polanyi]]'s [[Substantivism|substantivist approach]], and theory of [[Charles Bettelheim]], among others, and sought to present the emergence of new economic (and hence social) forms in terms of tensions within existing arrangements. Since they are interested in how historically specific systems of capital accumulation are "regularized" or stabilized, their approach is called the "regulation approach" or "regulation theory". Although this approach originated in [[Michel Aglietta]]'s monograph  ''A Theory of Capitalist Regulation: The US Experience'' (Verso, 1976) and was popularized by other Parisians such as Robert Boyer,&lt;ref name="school" /&gt; its membership goes well beyond the so-called Parisian School, extending to the Grenoble School, the German School, the Amsterdam School, British radical geographers, the US [[Social Structure of Accumulation]] School, and the neo-Gramscian school, among others.

==The regulation approach==

Robert Boyer describes the broad theory as "The study of the transformation of social relations, which creates new forms- both economic and non-economic- organized in structures and reproducing a determinate structure, the mode of reproduction".&lt;ref&gt;''The Regulation School: A Critical Introduction'' (Columbia University Press, 1990), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; This theory or approach looks at capitalist economies as a function of social and institutional systems and not just as government's role in the regulation of the economy, although the latter is a major part of the approach.

==Regimes of accumulation and modes of regulation==

Regulation theory discusses historical change of the political economy through two central concepts, "regime of accumulation or accumulation regime" (AR) and "mode of regulation" (MR). The concept of regime of accumulation allows theorists to analyze the way production, circulation, consumption, and distribution organize and expand capital in a way that stabilizes the economy over time. Alain Lipietz, in ''Towards a New Economic Order'', describes the regime of accumulation of [[Fordism]] as composed of mass-producing, a proportionate share-out of value added, and a consequent stability in firm’s profitability, with the plant used at full capacity and full employment (p.&amp;nbsp;6).

An MR is a set of institutional laws, norms, forms of state, policy paradigms, and other practices that provide the context for the AR's operation. Typically, it is said that it comprises a money form, a competition form, a wage form, a state form, and an international regime, but it can encompass many more elements than these. Generally speaking, MRs support ARs by providing a conducive and supportive environment, in which the ARs are given guidelines that they should follow. In cases of tension between the two, a crisis may occur. Thus this approach parallels Marx's characterisation of historical change as driven by contradictions between the [[forces of production|forces]] and the relations of production (see [[historical materialism]]).

==Translation and definition==

Bob Jessop summarises the difficulties of the term in ''Governing Capitalist Economies'' as follows: "The RA seeks to integrate analysis of political economy with analysis of [[civil society]] and or State to show how they interact to normalize the capital relation and govern the conflictual and crisis-mediated course of capital accumulation. In this sense, ''régulation'' might have been better and less mechanically translated as regularization or normalization" (p 4){{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}. Therefore, the term ''régulation'' does not necessarily translate well as "regulation". Regulation in the sense of government action does have a part in regulation theory.

== History of modes of regulation ==
Robert Boyer distinguished two main modes of regulation throughout the 19th and 20th centuries: 
* The "mode of regulation of competition" (1850–1930). It consisted of a first mode of regulation, from 1850 to the beginning of the 20th century, that Boyer called "extensive mode of regulation", characterized by low productivity gains, important part of the output dedicated to equipments, and high competition. The second period is called "intensive mode of regulation without mass consumption", because it consists of high productivity gains (thanks to Taylorist methods) and the production of consumption commodities.
* The "monopolist mode of regulation" (after 1930), characterized by high productivity and mass consumption. The Fordist system made possible a regular growth of economic output and an increase in income at the same time.

== Crisis ==
Regulationist economists distinguish between cyclical and structural crises. They study only structural crises, which are the crises of a mode of regulation.
From this distinction, they have formulated a typology of crises that accounts for various disarrangements in institutional configurations. According to its initial objective, which was to understand the rupture of the Fordist mode of regulation: 
* ''Exogenic crises'' are due to an external event; they can be very perturbing but cannot endanger the mode of regulation, and even less the mode of accumulation. Neoclassical economists (or economists of the school of rational anticipations) consider that all crises are exogenic. 
* ''Endogenous crises'' are cyclical crises that are necessary and inevitable, for they make it possible to cancel imbalances accumulated during the phase of expansion without major deterioration of institutional forms. These crises are inseparable from the operation of capitalism. 
* The ''crisis of the mode of regulation'': unable to avoid a downward spiral, institutional forms and the ways the state intervenes in the economy must be modified. The best example is the crisis of 1929, where the free play of market forces and competition did not lead to a renewed phase of expansion. 
* The ''crisis of the mode of accumulation'' means that it is impossible to continue long-term growth without major upheaval of institutional forms. The crisis of 1929 is the best example: the interwar period marks the passage from a mode of accumulation characterised by mass production without mass consumption to a mode incorporating both mass production and mass consumption.

== Current development ==
Since the 1980s, the Regulation school has developed research at other socio-economic levels: firms, markets and branches studies (food and agriculture, automotive, banking…); development and local regions ("regulation, sectors and territories" research workshop); developing countries or developed economies others than France and USA (South Korea, Chile, Belgium, Japan, Algeria, etc.): political economy of globalization (diversity of capitalisms, politics and firms...). By doing so, its methods now range from institutional macroeconomics to discurses analysis, with quantitative and qualitative methods.

'''Rent regulation''' is a system of [[law]]s, administered by a court or a public authority, which aim to ensure the affordability of housing and [[Tenancy|tenancies]] on the rental market for dwellings. Generally, a system of rent regulation involves:

*[[price controls]] (limits on the rent that a landlord may charge, typically called '''rent control''' or '''rent stabilization''')
*[[eviction]] controls: codified standards by which a landlord may terminate a tenancy{{ r | MB_Law | p=1 | q=Rent Control Laws cannot exist without a coinciding Eviction Control ordinance. The reason being is that if a landlord has a tenant in a rent controlled unit who is paying below market rent, he/she is financially motivated to simply evict the tenant and reset the rent to market rate under the Costa Hawkins Act. Therefore Eviction Control is necessary in order to preserve Rent Controlled tenancies. }} {{ r | SFChronicle_RC_1 | p=1 | q=If a city only limited rent increases, landlords could simply evict tenants when their lease is up and charge the next one market rates.  Two state laws place some limits on both rent control and eviction control. The Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act exempts multifamily apartments built after 1 February 1995 — and all single-family homes and condos, whenever built — from limits on rent increases. Costa-Hawkins does not prevent cities from imposing eviction controls on any type of rental housing — including single-family homes and apartments of any age. [This source and quote is included to clarify the difference between rent control and eviction control, and that eviction control laws can (and do) exist separately from and without rent control laws, whereas the converse is not true.] }}
*obligations on the landlord or tenant regarding adequate maintenance of the property
*a system of oversight and enforcement by an independent regulator and [[Ombudsman]]

The classic objective is to limit the price that would result from the [[free market]].  The loose term "rent control" can apply to several types of price control:
* "strict price ceilings", also known as "'''rent freeze'''" systems, or "'''absolute'''" or "'''first generation'''" rent controls, in which no increases in rent are allowed at all (rent is typically frozen at the rate existing when the law was enacted) 
* "vacancy control", also known as "'''strict'''" or "'''strong'''" rent control, in which the rental price can rise, but continues to be regulated in between tenancies (a new [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] pays almost the same rent as the previous tenant) and 
* "vacancy decontrol", also known as "'''tenancy'''" or "'''second-generation'''" rent control, which limits price increases during a tenancy, but allows rents to rise to market rate between tenancies (new tenants pay market rate rent, but increases are limited as long as they remain).{{ r | GPG }} 

As of 2016, at least 14 of the 36 [[OECD]] countries have some form of rent control in effect,{{ r | OECD_RC }} including four states in the [[United States]].{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }} 

A 2009 review of the economic literature{{ r | 2009_econ_lit_review | p=106 | q=If rent-control is such a “no-brainer,” why bother to scrutinize the literature? The cluster of restrictions persists in roughly 140 jurisdictions in the United States as of 2001. As Hazlett (1982) notes, “economists have been notoriously thorough in convincing themselves of the destructive effects of rent control and notoriously inept at convincing anyone else” (278). Better understanding of the issue might help correct the error, prevent other governments from falling into it, and promote an understanding among more than just economists. Also, better understanding is an end in itself. }} by Blair Jenkins through [[EconLit]] covering theoretical and empirical research on multiple aspects of the issue, including housing availability, maintenance and housing quality, rental rates, political and administrative costs, and redistribution, for both first generation and second generation rent control systems, found that “the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves”.{{ r | 2009_econ_lit_review | p=105 | q=My review of the rent-control literature indexed by EconLit (or cited by such indexed articles) finds that economic research quite consistently and predominantly frowns on rent control. ... As Navarro (1985) notes, “the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves” (90). }} {{ r | 2012_Urban_Inst | p=1 | q=In a comprehensive overview of the research literature, Blair Jenkins examined studies of different aspects of first-generation rent control (strict price ceilings) and second-generation (limits on increases, also referred to as rent stabilization). The upshot is that, at best, rent control does little harm but probably not much good and, at worst, it has negative impacts on landlords and tenants.  There is near universal agreement that strict price ceilings, such as the kind imposed in New York City in the 1940s, are always bad because they severely inhibit housing production and investment. Even those most sympathetic to rent control seem to agree with this. }} {{ r | Forbes_RC_cities | p=1 | q=Bad ideas die hard, and rent control is no exception. For several decades, there has been near-consensus [the author links to the Blair Jenkins study on the words "near-consensus"] among economists that laws which cap or regulate rents are counterproductive, and most cities have ended them. }} {{ r | Forbes_RC_Valdez | p=1 | q=Rent control is one of those policies that feels good—who doesn’t want to set price by fiat (I only want to pay $3.00 for this sandwich)—but it is fundamentally flawed. It has been a few years now, but Blair Jenkins has written a review of the economics literature and quotes an economist who says, “the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves” }}  

==Current law==
===Canada===
{{main|Rent regulation in Canada|Rent control in Ontario}}
In Canada, there are rent regulation laws in each province. For example, in [[Ontario]] the [[Residential Tenancies Act 2006]] requires that prices for rented properties do not rise more than 2.5 percent each year, or a lower figure fixed by a government minister.

===Germany===
German rent regulation is found in the "Civil Code" (the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'') in §§ 535 to §§ 580a, and particular rights for tenants on termination are in §§568 ff.&lt;ref&gt;English translation available: BGB [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p2181 §§568 ff]&lt;/ref&gt; The increases of rental price are required to follow a "rental mirror" (''Mietspiegel''), which is a database of local reference rent prices. This collects all rent prices in the past four years, and landlords may only increase prices on their property in line with rents in the same locality. [[Usury]] Rents are prohibited altogether, so that any price rises above 20 per cent over three years are unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= M Haffner, M Elsinga and J Hoekstra |title= Rent Regulation: The Balance between Private Landlords and Tenants in Six European Countries |date=2008 |url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14616710802037466#.U2HwTMcoYXw |volume=8 |issue=2 |journal= International Journal of Housing Policy |pages= 217; 227|doi= 10.1080/14616710802037466#.U2HwTMcoYXw |doi-broken-date= 2018-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tenants may be evicted against their will through a court procedure for a good reason, and in the normal case only with a minimum of three months' notice.&lt;ref&gt;BGB [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p2227 §573c]&lt;/ref&gt; Tenants receive unlimited duration of their rental agreement unless the duration is explicitly halted. In practice, landlords have little incentive to change tenants as rental price increases beyond inflation are constrained. During the period of the tenancy, a person's tenancy may only be terminated for very good reasons. A system of rights for the rental property to be maintained by the landlord is designed to ensure quality of housing. Many states, such as [[Berlin]], have a constitutional right to adequate housing, and require buildings to make dwelling spaces of a certain size and ceiling height.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

[[File:Graph-house-prices-1975-2006.gif|thumb|right|UK house prices 1975–2006.]]
Rent regulation covered the whole of the UK private sector rental market from 1915 to 1980. However, from the [[Housing Act 1980]], it became the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]'s policy to deregulate and dismantle rent regulation. Regulation for all new tenancies was abolished by the [[Housing Act 1988]], leaving the basic regulatory framework was "[[freedom of contract]]" by the landlord to set any price. Rent regulations survive among a small number of [[council house]]s, and often the rates set by local authorities mirror escalating prices in the non-regulated private market.

===United States===
{{main|Rent control in the United States|Rent control in California|Rent control in New York}}
Rent regulation in the [[United States]] is an issue for each state. In 1921, the [[US supreme court|US Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Block v. Hirsh]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|256|135|1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; held by a majority that regulation of rents in the District of Columbia as a temporary emergency measure was constitutional, but shortly afterwards in 1924 in ''[[Chastleton Corp v. Sinclair]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|264|543|1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same law was unanimously struck down by the Supreme Court.  After the 1930s [[New Deal]], the Supreme Court ceased to interfere with social and economic legislation, and a number of states adopted rules.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The application was often inconsistent. For example, in [[New York City]], almost half of property units continue to have the protection of rent regulation, while other units on the private market are left to be priced according to what the market will bear.&lt;ref name="SB"&gt; {{ cite web | last=Beyer | first=Scott | date=24 April 2015 | title=How Ironic: America's Rent-Controlled Cities Are Its Least Affordable | publisher=''[[Forbes]]'' | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottbeyer/2015/04/24/how-ironic-americas-rent-controlled-cities-are-its-least-affordable/ |accessdate=12 June 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501001409/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottbeyer/2015/04/24/how-ironic-americas-rent-controlled-cities-are-its-least-affordable/ | archive-date=2015-05-01 | dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1986 case of ''[[Fisher v. City of Berkeley]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|475|260|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the US Supreme court held that there was no incompatibility between rent control and the [[Sherman Act]].

As of 2018, four states ([[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Maryland]]) and the [[District of Columbia]] have localities in which some form of residential rent control is in effect (for normal structures, excluding [[Mobile home|mobile homes]]).{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}  Thirty-seven states either prohibit or preempt rent control, while nine states allow their cities to enact rent control, but have no cities that have implemented it.{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}

Rent price controls remain the most controversial element of a system of rent regulation. Historically, economists such as [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]] viewed landlords as producing very little that was valuable, and so regarded "rents" as an exploitative concept.{{Citation needed|reason=Did Adam Smith really think that rent is "exploitative"? This should be proven.|date=January 2017}} (Economists note that the [[land value tax]] is a way to capture this un-earned value.)&lt;ref name=Economist_LVT &gt; {{ cite web | url=https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/08/09/the-time-may-be-right-for-land-value-taxes | doi= | title=The time may be right for land-value taxes - Beloved of liberals and economists, they have so far never caught on | last= | first= | publisher=''[[The Economist]]'' | date=2018-08-09 | accessdate=2018-09-09 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827011448/https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/08/09/the-time-may-be-right-for-land-value-taxes | archive-date=2018-08-27 | dead-url=no | pages= | quote=&lt;blockquote&gt;  Taxes on land have long had a magnetic attraction for liberals and economists. ... One of George’s arguments for confiscating land rents was that landlords do not deserve the gains they accrue when others invest in an area. This was echoed by Winston Churchill, then a Liberal, in support of the “people’s budget”. “Roads are made, streets are made, services are improved, electric light turns night into day, water is brought from reservoirs a hundred miles off in the mountains—and all the while the landlord sits still,” he thundered. The argument emphasises the potential for landowners to benefit at the taxpayer’s expense. There is lots of evidence that local house prices rise when taxpayers provide, say, better transport links. &lt;/blockquote&gt; }} &lt;/ref&gt;  Modern rent controls (sometimes called rent leveling or rent stabilization) are intended to protect tenants in privately owned residential properties from excessive rent increases by mandating gradual rent increases, while at the same time ensuring that landlords receive a return on their investment that is deemed fair by the controlling authority (which might, or might not be a legislature).

It is argued by most economists, including a number of neo-classical and [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] economists&lt;ref&gt;C Rapkin,''The Private Rental Housing Market in New York City'' (1966) and G Sternlieb, ''The Urban Housing Dilemma'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; that some forms of rent control regulations create shortages and exacerbate scarcity in the housing market by discouraging private investment in the rental market.{{ r | 2009_econ_lit_review}}{{ r | SJMN_RC_new_housing | p=1 }} This analysis targeted nominal rent freezes, and the studies conducted were mainly focused on rental prices in Manhattan, or elsewhere in the United States.

The Swedish economist [[Assar Lindbeck]], a housing expert, says that "rent control appears to be the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city – except for bombing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/10802231/Low-rent-Labour-is-positioning-itself-as-the-Ukip-of-the-Left.html|title=Low-rent Labour is positioning itself as the Ukip of the Left|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|author=[[Fraser Nelson]]|date=2 May 2014|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economists' views==
In a 1992 [[Stratified sampling|stratified]], random survey of 464 US economists, economics [[graduate school|graduate students]], and members of the [[American Economic Association]], 93% "generally agreed" or "agreed with [[wikt:proviso|provisos]]" that "A ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality of housing available."{{ r | 1992_poll | p=204 | q=76.3% generally agreed, 16.6% agreed but with provisos }} {{ r | Krugman_NYT | p=1 | q=The analysis of rent control is among the best-understood issues in all of economics, and -- among economists, anyway -- one of the least controversial. In 1992 a poll of the American Economic Association found 93 percent of its members agreeing that "a ceiling on rents reduces the quality and quantity of housing." }}

A 2009 review of the economic literature{{ r | 2009_econ_lit_review | p=106 | q=If rent-control is such a “no-brainer,” why bother to scrutinize the literature? The cluster of restrictions persists in roughly 140 jurisdictions in the United States as of 2001. As Hazlett (1982) notes, “economists have been notoriously thorough in convincing themselves of the destructive effects of rent control and notoriously inept at convincing anyone else” (278). Better understanding of the issue might help correct the error, prevent other governments from falling into it, and promote an understanding among more than just economists. Also, better understanding is an end in itself. }} by Blair Jenkins through [[EconLit]] covering theoretical and empirical research on multiple aspects of the issue, including housing availability, maintenance and housing quality, rental rates, political and administrative costs, and redistribution, for both first generation and second generation rent control systems, found that “the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves”.{{ r | 2009_econ_lit_review | p=105 | q=My review of the rent-control literature indexed by EconLit (or cited by such indexed articles) finds that economic research quite consistently and predominantly frowns on rent control. ... As Navarro (1985) notes, “the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves” (90). }} {{ r | 2012_Urban_Inst | p=1 | q=In a comprehensive overview of the research literature, Blair Jenkins examined studies of different aspects of first-generation rent control (strict price ceilings) and second-generation (limits on increases, also referred to as rent stabilization). The upshot is that, at best, rent control does little harm but probably not much good and, at worst, it has negative impacts on landlords and tenants.  There is near universal agreement that strict price ceilings, such as the kind imposed in New York City in the 1940s, are always bad because they severely inhibit housing production and investment. Even those most sympathetic to rent control seem to agree with this. }} {{ r | Forbes_RC_cities | p=1 | q=Bad ideas die hard, and rent control is no exception. For several decades, there has been near-consensus [the author links to the Blair Jenkins study on the words "near-consensus"] among economists that laws which cap or regulate rents are counterproductive, and most cities have ended them. }} {{ r | Forbes_RC_Valdez | p=1 | q=Rent control is one of those policies that feels good—who doesn’t want to set price by fiat (I only want to pay $3.00 for this sandwich)—but it is fundamentally flawed. It has been a few years now, but Blair Jenkins has written a review of the economics literature and quotes an economist who says, “the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves” }}

In a 2012 poll of the 41 members of the [[Initiative on Global Markets]] (IGM) Economic Experts Panel, only one member agreed with the following statement: "Local ordinances that limit rent increases for some rental housing units, such as in New York and San Francisco, have had a positive impact over the past three decades on the amount and quality of broadly affordable rental housing in cities that have used them."  (13 "strongly disagreed", 20 "disagreed", 1 "agreed", and 7 either did not answer, were undecided, or had no opinion.){{ r | 2012_IGM }} {{ r | SFChronicle_RC_1 | p=1 | q=A 2012 survey by the University of Chicago&amp;apos;s Booth School of Business asked respected economists if they agreed that rent-control ordinances in cities such as New York and San Francisco have improved the quantity and quality of affordable rental housing over the past three decades. Eighty-one percent disagreed, 2 percent agreed and 9 percent were uncertain or had no opinion. }} {{ r | WaPo_Econ_quiz | p=1 | q=The findings of consensus are usually predictable. Economists, sure enough, hate rent control, [In this article, the author hyperlinks to the 2012 Chicago poll on the words rent contol.] licensing requirements and the gold standard, love free trade (including with China), high-skilled immigration, congestion pricing and carbon taxes, and think the Laffer curve is a bunch of baloney. Other answers are more surprising. The panelists lean toward supporting tougher capital requirements on big banks and backing the 2009 stimulus package, and, by a wide margin, back increasing the minimum wage to $9 an hour and indexing it to inflation. The results don&amp;apos;t always map easily onto U.S. political divides. }}

What, then, should be done to help renters obtain affordable, decent housing? A better approach may be adopting policies that encourage the production of more diverse types of housing (different densities, tenure types, unit sizes, etc.), implementing strong regulations and practices to ensure housing quality and to protect tenants from abuses; and providing targeted, direct subsidies to people who need help paying their rents. }} {{ r | SFChronicle_RC_1 | p=1 | q=In 2013, Peter Tatian of the Urban Institute reviewed academic research on rent control and found “very little evidence that rent control is a good policy.” }} {{ r | CityLab_RC_NYC | p=1 | q=Then again, as Peter Tatian of the Urban Institute recently wrote here, [the author hyperlinks to the Peter Tatian analysis on the words "recently wrote here"] there&amp;apos;s "very little evidence that rent control is good policy." Studies have found that landlords with rent-controlled units often inflate the rent on other units to make up the loss, and that rent-stabilization programs don&amp;apos;t do a great job targeting the poor residents they&amp;apos;re supposed to protect. }}

Two economists from opposing sides of the political spectrum, [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Paul Krugman]] (who identifies as an American liberal or European [[social democrat]]),&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR1FpbMkZ58 "Nobelpristagaren i ekonomi 2008: Paul Krugman"], speech by Paul Krugman (Retrieved December 26, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Sowell]], (who stated that "[[Libertarianism|libertarian]]" might best describe his views){{ r | Sowell_Salon | p=1 | q=What would your preferred label be? I prefer not to have labels, but I suspect that "libertarian" would suit me better than many others, }} have both criticized rent regulation as poor economics, which, despite its good intentions, leads to the creation of less housing and housing shortages.{{ r | Krugman_NYT | p=1 | q=Sky-high rents on uncontrolled apartments, because desperate renters have nowhere to go -- and the absence of new apartment construction, despite those high rents, because landlords fear that controls will be extended? Predictable. }} {{ r | Sowell_EF&amp;F | p=4 | q=Rent control, for example, has been imposed in various cities around the world, with the intention of helping tenants. Almost invariably, landlords and builders of housing find the reduced range of terms less acceptable and therefore supply less housing. ... In other words, while landlords and builders simply lost an opportunity to make as much money as they could have otherwise, many tenants lost an opportunity to find a decent place to live. }}  Krugman also notes that rent control creates bitter tenant-landlord relations,{{ r | Krugman_NYT | p=1 | q=Bitter relations between tenants and landlords, with an arms race between ever-more ingenious strategies to force tenants out -- what yesterday&amp;apos;s article oddly described as &amp;apos;free-market horror stories&amp;apos; -- and constantly proliferating regulations designed to block those strategies? Predictable. }} and in markets with not all apartments under rent control, it causes an increase in rents for uncontrolled units,{{ r | Krugman_NYT | p=1 | q=Sky-high rents on uncontrolled apartments, because desperate renters have nowhere to go -- and the absence of new apartment construction, despite those high rents, because landlords fear that controls will be extended? Predictable. }}  while Sowell notes that rent control increases [[urban blight]].{{ r | Sowell_EF&amp;F | p=5 }} {{ r | Sowell_Salon | p=1 | q=You aren&amp;apos;t a fan of rent control? No, I&amp;apos;m not. A figure I ran across recently that struck me as illustrating the moral bankruptcy of rent control is this: The number of boarded-up housing units in New York City is four times the number of homeless people on the streets. To think of that! On winter nights there are people sleeping on the cold pavement and dying of exposure, when there are these buildings that are boarded up as a consequence of economic protectionism. }}

'''Robert H. Gray''' is an American data analyst, author, and astronomer, and author of ''The Elusive Wow: Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence''.

==Education==
Gray attended [[Shimer College]], a [[Great Books]] school then located in [[Mount Carroll, Illinois]], where he received a [[bachelor's degree]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shimer College Alum Directory|date=1997|publisher=Shimer College|location=Waukegan, Illinois|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He went on to obtain a [[master's degree|master's]] in urban planning and policy analysis from the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://astro.uchicago.edu/AstroChicago123/participants.php Participants], astro.uchicago.edu. Accessed July 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Data analysis===
In 1984, Gray founded the company Gray Data in Chicago, which provided data analysis research services and published reference cards for microcomputer software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Dq_wMXq5hmgC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=Robert+Gray+Data+Chicago&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zEwsUaXHE-bP2QWg7YAw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Robert%20Gray%20Data%20Chicago&amp;f=false |title=Decennial Census Data for Transportation Planning: Case Studies and Strategies for 2000 : Proceedings of a Conference, Irvine, California, April 28-May 1, 1996, Volume 1 |date=1997 |publisher=Transportation Research Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxdQAAAAYAAJ |date=1986 |page=20 |title=Robert Gray |publisher=''Space World'' |author=National Space Institute |author-link=National Space Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to work as a data analyst through his company Gray Consulting.&lt;ref name="aalexander012712"&gt;Amir Alexander, [http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/amir-alexander/3346.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/ "One Man’s Quest for SETI's Most Promising Signal,"] The Planetary Society, January 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI)===
Gray is best known for his work as an independent [[SETI]] researcher,&lt;ref name=Gayle /&gt;&lt;ref name=shostak&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/641/mysteries-of-wow |title=The Mysteries of the Wow Wave |author=Seth Shostak |authorlink= Seth Shostak| date=October 22, 2003 |accessdate=February 25, 2013 |publisher=''Astrobiology Magazine''}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in regard to his searches for the [[Wow! signal]].&lt;ref name=Gayle&gt;{{cite news |title=The Wow! signal: Alien hunter claims best clue yet to existence of E.T. came from an interstellar lighthouse| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2102529/The-Wow-signal-Did-best-clue-existence-alien-life-come-interstellar-lighthouse.html#ixzz2LyRqA1yx |publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]'' |date=February 17, 2012 |accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Atlantic]]'' called Gray "the 'Wow!' signal's most devoted seeker and chronicler, having traveled to the very ends of the earth in search of it."&lt;ref name=Andersen /&gt;

The Wow! signal was detected by the [[Ohio State University Radio Observatory]] (also known as Big Ear) on August 15, 1977. The signal was so pronounced in the data, and so similar to a radio signal rather than a natural source, that SETI scientist [[Jerry R. Ehman]] circled it on the computer printout in red ink and wrote "Wow!" next to it.&lt;ref name=universetoday /&gt; After hearing about the Wow! signal a few years after its detection, Gray contacted the Ohio team, visited Big Ear, and spoke with Ehman, [[Robert S. Dixon]] (director of the SETI project) and [[John D. Kraus]] (the telescope's designer).&lt;ref name="aalexander012712"/&gt; 

In 1980, Gray began scanning the skies from his backyard in Chicago, using a 12-foot commercial telecommunications dish.&lt;ref name="aalexander012712"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Golden, [https://www.newspapers.com/image/68025477/ "NASA scientists search heavens for 'E.T.',"] ''[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]'', September 2, 1988, pp. E1, E3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=_mo4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Robert+Gray+SETI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B0csUfCrD-Gh2gX8moDQAw&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Gray&amp;f=false |title=Carl Sagan's Universe |date=1997 |author=Yervant Terzian |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The search for extraterrestrial life--recent developments: proceedings of the 112th symposium of the International Astronomical Union held at Boston University, Boston, Mass., USA |date=1985 |accessdate=February 25, 2013 |author=Michael D.

===Writing===
Gray and Marvel published a 2001 paper in ''[[The Astrophysical Journal]]'' detailing his use of the VLA in search of the signal.&lt;ref name=Andersen /&gt; Gray and Ellingsen published "A Search for Periodic Emissions at the Wow Locale" in the October 2002 issue of ''The Astrophysical Journal'', reporting on searches for the Wow! signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/space/wow.html |title=A Signal from Above |date=August 15, 2007 |author=Paul Jay |accessdate=February 25, 2013 |publisher=[[CBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/578/2/967/fulltext/54084.text.html|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2002-10-20|volume=578|pages=967–971|author=Gray, Robert H.|author2=Ellingsen, Simon|title=A Search for Periodic Emissions at the Wow Locale|bibcode = 2002ApJ...578..967G |doi = 10.1086/342646 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Gray published the book ''The Elusive Wow: Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence'', summarizing what is known about the Wow! signal, covering his own search for the signal, and offering an overview of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;ref name=Andersen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-9839584-4-4 |title=The Elusive WOW: Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence |publisher=''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' |date=October 24, 2011 |accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray concluded that the signal could have come from an alien "lighthouse".&lt;ref name=Gayle /&gt;

In 2016, Gray published an article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' about the [[Fermi paradox]], which claims that if extraterrestrials existed, we would see signs of them on Earth, because they would certainly colonize the galaxy by interstellar travel. Gray argues that the Fermi paradox, named after [[Nobel Prize]]-winning physicist [[Enrico Fermi]], does not accurately represent Fermi's views. Gray states that Fermi questioned the feasibility of interstellar travel, but did not say definitively whether or not he thought extraterrestrials exist.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Gray, [http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-fermi-paradox-is-not-fermi-s-and-it-is-not-a-paradox/ "The Fermi Paradox Is Not Fermi’s, and It Is Not a Paradox,"] ''[[Scientific American]]'', January 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SaltMod''' is [[computer program]] for the prediction of the [[salinity]] of [[soil moisture]], [[groundwater]] and [[drainage]] water, the depth of the [[watertable]], and the drain [[discharge (hydrology)]] in [[irrigation|irrigated]] [[agriculture|agricultural]] lands, using different [[geohydrology|(geo)hydrologic]] conditions, varying [[water management]] options, including the use of ground water for irrigation, and several [[crop rotation|cropping rotation]] schedules.
The water management options include irrigation, drainage, and the use of subsurface drainage water from pipe drains, ditches or [[Water well|wells]] for irrigation.

==Soil salinity models==
The majority of the computer models available for water and solute transport in the soil (e.g. Swatre,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.alterra.wur.nl/Internet/webdocs/ilri-publicaties/publicaties/Pub55/pub55-h4.pdf Swatre]&lt;/ref&gt; DrainMod &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/wetdrain/wetdrain-tools.html Drainmod] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623100817/http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/wetdrain/wetdrain-tools.html |date=2007-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ) are based on Richard's [[differential equation]] for the movement of water in [[Vadose zone|unsaturated]] soil in combination with a differential salinity [[dispersion equation]]. The models require input of soil characteristics like the relation between unsaturated soil moisture content, water tension, [[hydraulic conductivity]] and dispersivity.

These relations vary to a great extent from place to place and are not easy to measure. The models use short time steps and need at least a daily data base of hydrological phenomena. Altogether this makes model application to a fairly large project the job of a team of specialists with ample facilities.

==Rationale==
There is a need for a computer program that is easier to operate and that requires a simpler [[data structure]] than most currently available models. Therefore, the SaltModod program was designed keeping in mind a relative simplicity of operation to facilitate the use by field technicians, engineers and project planners instead of specialized [[geohydrology|geo-hydrologists]].

It aims at using input data that are generally available, or that can be estimated with reasonable accuracy, or that can be measured with relative ease. Although the calculations are done numerically and have to be repeated many times, the final results can be ''checked by hand'' using the formulas in the manual.

SaltMod's objective is to predict the long-term hydro-salinity in terms of general [[wikt:trend|trend]]s, not to arrive at exact predictions of how, for example, the situation would be on the first of April in ten years from now.

Further, SaltMod gives the option of the re-use of drainage and well water (e.g. for irrigation) and it can account for farmers' response to [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]], [[soil salinity]], water scarcity and over-pumping from the [[aquifer]]. Also it offers the possibility to introduce [[Drainage system (agriculture)|subsurface drainage systems]] at varying depths and with varying capacity so that they can be [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimized]].
Other features of Saltmod are found in the next section.

==Principles==
===Seasonal approach===
The computation method Saltmod is based on seasonal [[water balance]]s of agricultural lands. Four seasons in one year can be distinguished, e.g. dry, wet, cold, hot, irrigation or [[fallow]] seasons. The number of seasons (Ns) can be chosen between a minimum of one and a maximum of four. The larger the number of seasons becomes, the larger is the number of input data required. The duration of each season (Ts) is given in number of months (0 &lt; Ts &lt; 12). Day to day water balances are not considered for several reasons:
#daily inputs would require much information, which may not be readily available;
#the method is especially developed to predict long term, not day-to-day, trends and predictions for the future are more reliably made on a seasonal (long term) than on a daily (short term) basis, due to the high variability of short-term data;
#even though the precision of the predictions for the future may still not be very high, a lot is gained when the trend is sufficiently clear; for example, it need not be a major constraint to design appropriate [[soil salinity control]] measures when a certain salinity level, predicted by Saltmod to occur after 20 years, will in reality occur after 15 or 25 years.

===Hydrological data===
The method uses seasonal water balance components as input data. These are related to the surface [[hydrology]] (like [[rainfall]], [[evaporation]], irrigation, use of drain and well water for irrigation, [[Surface runoff|runoff]]), and the [[aquifer]] [[hydrology]] (like upward seepage, natural drainage, pumping from wells). The other water balance components (like downward [[percolation]], upward [[capillary rise]], [[Drainage system (agriculture)|subsurface drainage]]) are given as output.&lt;br&gt;
The quantity of drainage water, as an output, is determined by two drainage intensity factors for drainage above and below drain level respectively (to be given with the input data), a drainage reduction factor (to simulate a limited operation of the drainage system), and the height of the water table, resulting from the computed water balance. Variation of the drainage intensity factors and the drainage reduction factor gives the opportunity to simulate the effect of different drainage options.

===Agricultural data===
[[File:Riego por surcos.JPG|thumb|250px|Irrigated land]]
The input data on [[irrigation]], [[evaporation]], and surface [[Surface runoff|runoff]] are to be specified per [[season]] for three kinds of agricultural practices, which can be chosen at the discretion of the user: 
#A:	irrigated land with crops of group A
#B:	irrigated land with crops of group B
#U:	non-irrigated land with rainfed crops or fallow land
The groups, expressed in fractions of the total area, may consist of combinations of [[crop]]s or just of a single kind of crop. For example, as the A type crops one may specify the lightly irrigated cultures, and as the B type the more heavily irrigated ones, such as [[sugarcane]] and [[rice]]. But one can also take A as rice and B as sugarcane, or perhaps [[tree]]s and [[orchard]]s. The A, B and/or U crops can be taken differently in different [[season]]s, e.g. A=[[wheat]]+[[barley]] in winter and A=[[maize]] in summer while B=[[vegetable]]s in winter and B=[[cotton]] in summer.&lt;br&gt; 
	Un-irrigated land can be specified in two ways: (1) as U=1&amp;minus;A&amp;minus;B and (2) as A and/or B with zero irrigation. A combination can also be made.&lt;br&gt;
	Further, a specification must be given of the seasonal [[crop rotation|rotation]] of the different [[land use]]s over the total area, e.g. full rotation, no rotation at all, or incomplete rotation.  This occurs with a rotation index. The rotations are taken over the seasons within the year. To obtain rotations over the years it is advisable to introduce annual input changes.&lt;br&gt;
	When a fraction A1, B1 and/or U1 in the first season differs from fractions are A2, B2 and/or U2 in the second season, because the irrigation regimes in the seasons differ, the program will detect that a certain rotation occurs. If one wishes to avoid this, one may specify the same fractions in all seasons (A2=A1, B2=B1, U2=U1), but the crops and irrigation quantities may have to be adjusted in proportion.&lt;br&gt;
	Cropping rotation schedules vary widely in different parts of the world. Creative combinations of area fractions, rotation indexes, irrigation quantities and annual input changes can accommodate many types of agricultural practices.
	Variation of the area fractions and/or the rotational schedule gives the opportunity to simulate the effect of different agricultural practices on the water and salt balance.

===Soil strata===
[[File:Aquifer en.svg|thumb|250px|The aquifer can play an important role in soil salinity]]
Saltmod accepts four different reservoirs, three of which are in the soil profile:
#	a surface reservoir
#	an upper (shallow) soil reservoir or root zone
#	an intermediate soil reservoir or transition zone
#	a deep reservoir or [[aquifer]].
The upper soil reservoir is defined by the soil depth from which water can evaporate or be taken up by plant roots. It can be equal to the rootzone.&lt;br&gt;
The root zone can be saturated, [[Vadose zone|unsaturated]], or partly saturated, depending on the [[water balance]]. All water movements in this zone are vertical, either upward or downward, depending on the water balance. (In a future version of Saltmod, the upper soil reservoir may be divided into two equal parts to detect the trend in the vertical salinity distribution.)&lt;br&gt;
The transition zone can also be saturated, unsaturated or partly saturated. All flows in this zone are vertical, except the flow to subsurface drains.&lt;br&gt;
If a horizontal subsurface [[Drainage system (agriculture)|drainage system]] is present, this must be placed in the transition zone, which is then divided into two parts: an upper transition zone (above drain level) and a lower transition zone (below drain level).&lt;br&gt;
If one wishes to distinguish an upper and lower part of the transition zone in the absence of a subsurface drainage system, one may specify in the input data a drainage system with zero intensity.&lt;br&gt;
The aquifer has mainly horizontal flow. Pumped wells, if present, receive their water from the aquifer only.

===Water balances===
[[Image:SoilLeaching2.jpg|thumb|250px|Water balance factors in the top soil]]
The [[water balance]]s are calculated for each reservoir separately as shown in the article [[Hydrology (agriculture)]]. The excess water leaving one reservoir is converted into incoming water for the next reservoir.&lt;br&gt;
The three soil reservoirs can be assigned a different thickness and storage coefficients, to be given as input data.&lt;br&gt;
In a particular situation, the transition zone or the aquifer need not be present. Then, it must be given a minimum thickness of 0.1 m.&lt;br&gt;
The depth of the [[water table]], calculated from the water balances, is assumed to be the same for the whole area. If this assumption is not acceptable, the area must be divided into separate units.&lt;br&gt;
Under certain conditions, the height of the water table influences the water balance components. For example a rise of the water table towards the soil surface may lead to an increase of [[evaporation]], surface [[Surface runoff|runoff]], and subsurface drainage, or a decrease of [[percolation]] losses from canals. This, in turn, leads to a change of the water balance, which again influences the height of the water table, etc.&lt;br&gt;
This chain of reactions is one of the reasons why Saltmod has been developed into a computer program. It takes a number of repeated calculations ([[iterations]]) to find the correct equilibrium of the water balance, which would be a tedious job if done by hand. Other reasons are that a computer program facilitates the computations for different water management options over long periods of time (with the aim to simulate their long-term effects) and for trial runs with varying parameters.

===Drains, wells, and re-use===
The [[Drainage system (agriculture)|sub-surface drainage]] can be accomplished through [[Tile drainage|drains]] or pumped [[Water well|wells]].&lt;br&gt;
The subsurface drains are characterized by drain depth and ''drainage capacity factor ''. The drains are located in the transition zone. The subsurface drainage facility can be applied to natural or artificial drainage systems. The functioning of an artificial drainage system can be regulated through a ''drainage control factor''.&lt;br&gt;
When no drainage system is present, installing drains with zero capacity offers the opportunity to obtain separate water and salt balances for an upper and lower part of the transition zone.&lt;br&gt;
The pumped wells are located in the aquifer. Their functioning is characterized by the well discharge.&lt;br&gt;
The drain and well water can be used for irrigation through a ''re-use factor''. This may affect the salt balance and the irrigation efficiency or sufficiency.
[[Image:SALTMOD4.JPG|thumb|200px|Leaching curves, calibrating leaching efficiency]]

===Salt balances===
The [[Soil salinity control|salt balances]] are calculated for each reservoir separately. They are based on their [[water balance]]s, using the ''salt concentrations'' of the incoming and outgoing water. Some concentrations must be given as input data, like the initial salt concentrations of the water in the different soil reservoirs, of the irrigation water and of the incoming ground water in the aquifer.


[[File:Saltleaching.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Graphic presentation of soil salinity trends]]
The concentrations are expressed in terms of [[electric conductivity]] (EC in dS/m). When the concentrations are known in terms of g salt/l water, the rule of thumb: 1 g/l -&gt; 1.7 dS/m can be used. Usually, salt concentrations of the soil are expressed in ECe, the electric conductivity of an extract of a saturated soil paste (saturation extract). In Saltmod, the salt concentration is expressed as the EC of the soil moisture when saturated under field conditions. As a rule, one can use the conversion rate EC : ECe = 2 : 1.&lt;br&gt;
Salt concentrations of outgoing water (either from one reservoir into the other or by subsurface drainage) are computed on the basis of salt balances, using different ''leaching or salt mixing efficiencies'' to be given with the input data. The effects of different [[Leaching model#Leaching efficiency|leaching efficiencies]] can be simulated by varying their input value.


If drain or well water is used for irrigation, the method computes the salt concentration of the mixed irrigation water in the course of the time and the subsequent effect on the soil and ground water salinities, which again influences the salt concentration of the drain and well water. By varying the fraction of used drain or well water (to be given in the input data), the long-term effect of different fractions can be simulated.


The [[solvation|dissolution]] of solid soil minerals or the chemical [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of poorly soluble salts is not included in the computation method, but to some extent it can be accounted for through the input data, e.g. by increasing or decreasing the salt concentration of the irrigation water or of the incoming water in the aquifer.

===Farmers' responses===
If required, farmers' responses to [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|water logging]] and [[soil salinity]] can be automatically accounted for. The method can gradually decrease:
#	the amount of irrigation water applied when the [[water table]] becomes shallower;
#	the fraction of irrigated land when the available irrigation water is scarce;
#	the fraction of irrigated land when the soil salinity increases; for this purpose, the salinity is given a [[stochastic]] interpretation.
Response (1) is different for ponded (submerged) [[rice]] (paddy) and "dry foot" crops.


The responses influence the water and salt balances, which, in their turn, slow down the process of water logging and salinization. Ultimately an equilibrium situation will be brought about.


The user can also introduce farmers' responses by manually changing the relevant input data. Perhaps it will be useful first to study the automatic farmers' responses and their effect and thereafter decide what the farmers' responses will be in the view of the user.

===Annual input changes===
The program may run with fixed input data for the number of years determined by the user. This option can be used to predict future developments based on long-term average input values, e.g. rainfall, as it will be difficult to assess the future values of the input data year by year.
The program also offers the possibility to follow historic records with annually changing input values (e.g. rainfall, irrigation, agricultural practices), the calculations must be made year by year. If this possibility is chosen, the program creates transfer files by which the final conditions of the previous year (e.g. water table and salinity) are automatically used as the initial conditions for the subsequent period. This facility makes it possible to use various generated rainfall sequences drawn [[random]]ly from a known rainfall [[probability distribution]] and obtain a [[stochastic]] prediction of the resulting output parameters.


If the computations are made with annual changes, not all input parameters can be changed, notably the thickness of the soil reservoirs and their total porosities as these would cause illogical shifts in the water and salt balances.

[[Image:GOHANAFREQ.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cumulative frequency distribution of soil salinity]]
[[Image:Interacstudy.gif|thumb|200px|Capillary rise, output]]

===Output data===
The output of Saltmod is given for each season of any year during any number of years, as specified with the input data. The output data comprise hydrological and salinity aspects.

The data are filed in the form of tables that can be inspected directly or further analyzed with [[spreadsheet]] programs.

As the soil salinity is very variable from place to place (figure left) SaltMod includes frequency distributions in the output. The figure was made with the CumFreq program [http://www.waterlog.info/cumfreq.htm] .
 
The program offers the possibility to develop a multitude of relations between varied input data, resulting outputs and time.&lt;br&gt; 
However, as it is not possible to foresee all different uses that may be made, the program offers only a limited number of standard [[graphics]].
 
The program is designed to make use of spreadsheet programs for the detailed output analysis, in which the relations between various input and output variables can be established according to the scenario developed by the user.

Although the [[computations]] need many [[iterations]], all the end results can be ''checked by hand'' using the equations presented in the manual.

'''Stephen Louis Adler''' (born November 30, 1939) is an American [[physicist]] specializing in [[elementary particles]] and [[field theory (physics)|field theory]].

== Biography ==
Adler was born in [[New York City]]. He received an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] degree at [[Harvard University]] in 1961, where he was a [[Putnam Fellow]], and a [[Ph.D.]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1964.  He is the son of [[Irving Adler]] and Ruth Adler and older brother of [[Peggy Adler]].

Adler was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1974.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in 1966, becoming a full Professor of [[Theoretical Physics]] in 1969, and was named "New Jersey Albert Einstein Professor" at the institute in 1979.

He has won the [[Sakurai Prize|J. J. Sakurai Prize]] from the [[American Physical Society]] in 1988, and the [[Dirac Medal]] of the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] in 1998, among other awards.

Adler's seminal papers on high energy neutrino processes, current algebras, soft pion theorems,
sum rules, and perturbation theory anomalies helped lay the foundations for the current standard model of elementary particle physics.

In 2012, Adler contributed to a family venture when he wrote the foreword for his then 99-year-old father's 87th book, "Solving the Riddle of Phyllotaxis: Why the Fibonacci Numbers and the Golden Ratio Occur on Plants".  The book's diagrams are by his sister Peggy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Adler|first=Irving|title=Solving the Riddle of Phyllotaxis: Why the Fibonacci Numbers and the Golden Ratio Occur On Plants|url=http://www.worldscibooks.com/mathematics/8500.html|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trace dynamics ==
In his book ''Quantum Theory as an Emergent Phenomenon'', published 2004, Adler presented his trace dynamics, a framework in which [[quantum field theory]] emerges from a matrix theory. In this matrix theory, particles are represented by non-commuting matrices, and the matrix elements of [[boson]]ic and [[fermion]]ic particles are ordinary [[complex number]]s and non-commuting [[Grassmann number]]s, respectively. Using the [[action principle]], a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] can be constructed from the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of a polynomial function of these matrices, leading to [[Poisson bracket#Hamilton's equations of motion|Hamiltonian equations of motion]]. The construction of a [[statistical mechanics]] of these matrix models leads, so Adler says, to an "emergent effective complex quantum field theory".&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Theory as an Emergent Phenomenon'': [http://www.cap.ca/brms/Reviews/Rev711_592.pdf Book review by Collin Carbno] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224082618/http://www.cap.ca/brms/Reviews/Rev711_592.pdf |date=2013-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the review of Adler's trace dynamics in Tejinder P.

Adler's Trace Dynamics has been discussed in relation to the differential space theory of quantum systems by [[Norbert Wiener]] and Amand Siegel, to its variant by [[David Bohm]] and [[Jeffrey Bub]], and to modifications of the [[Schrödinger equation]] by additional terms such as the [[quantum potential]] term or stochastic terms, and to [[hidden variable theories]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Davidson: ''Stochastic mechanics, trace dynamics, and differential space&amp;nbsp;– a synthesis'', [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0602211v2 arXiv:quant-ph/0602211], submitted 25 February 2006, version of 21 Mar 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''terminal countdown demonstration test''' ('''TCDT''') is a simulation of the final hours of a [[launch countdown]] and serves as a practice exercise in which both the launch team and flight crew rehearse launch day timelines and procedures. In the specific case of a TCDT for the [[Space Shuttle]], the test culminated in a simulated ignition and [[RSLS Abort]] (automated shutdown of the orbiter's main engines). Following the simulated abort, the flight crew was briefed on emergency egress procedures and use of the fixed service structure slidewire system.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web| url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts-lcc.html#sts-tcd | title = NSTS 1988 News Reference Manual | publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On some earlier shuttle missions, and Apollo missions, the test would conclude with the flight crew evacuating the launch pad by use of these emergency systems, however this is no longer part of the test.

Unmanned [[carrier rocket]] launches also undergo TCDTs, when countdown procedures are followed. These vary for specific rockets, for example [[solid rocket|solid-fuelled]] rockets would not simulate an engine shutdown, as it is impossible to shut down a solid rocket after it has been lit.

TCDTs typically are carried out a few days before launch.

'''Ubuntu releases''' are made semiannually by [[Canonical Ltd]], the developers of the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] [[operating system]], using the year and month of the release as a [[Software versioning|version number]]. The first Ubuntu release, for example, was Ubuntu 4.10 and was released on 20 October 2004.&lt;ref name="aboutUbuntu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu|title=About Ubuntu The Ubuntu story|website=|publisher=Canonical Ltd.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010080320/http://www.ubuntu.com:80/project/about-ubuntu|archive-date=10 October 2010|dead-url=|accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wartyRelease" /&gt; Consequently, version numbers for future versions are provisional; if the release is delayed until a different month (or even year) to that planned, the version number will change accordingly.&lt;ref name="timeBasedReleases"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases |title= TimeBasedReleases |work= Ubuntu Team Wiki |publisher= Canonical Ltd. |accessdate= 27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canonical schedules Ubuntu releases to occur approximately one month after [[GNOME]] releases, which in turn come about one month after releases of [[X.Org Server|X.Org]], resulting in each Ubuntu release including a newer version of GNOME and X.&lt;ref name="ubuntuReleases"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases |title= Releases |accessdate= 28 February 2010 |publisher= Canonical Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gnomeTimeBasedReleases"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://live.gnome.org/ReleasePlanning/TimeBased |title= GNOME's Time-Based Release Schedule |work= Gnome Live Wiki |accessdate= 27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xTimeBasedReleases"&gt;{{cite mailing list |url= http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg-devel/2009-September/002330.html |title= New release process |date= 30 August 2009 |accessdate= 27 August 2010 |mailinglist= xorg-devel |last= Stone |first= Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every fourth release—occurring in the second quarter of even-numbered years—has been designated as a [[long-term support]] (LTS) release.&lt;ref name="lts"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS |title= LTS |work= Ubuntu Team Wiki |publisher= Canonical Ltd. |accessdate= 27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The desktop version of LTS releases for 10.04 and earlier were supported for three years, with server version support for five years. LTS releases 12.04, 14.04 and 16.04 are supported for five years, while Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is supported for ten years.&lt;ref name="Kerner"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.serverwatch.com/server-news/canonical-extends-ubuntu-18.04-lts-linux-support-to-10-years.html|title=Canonical Extends Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Linux Support to 10 Years|first=Sean Michael |last=Kerner|website=www.serverwatch.com|date=15 November 2018 |access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="releaseeol"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ubuntu.com/info/release-end-of-life |title= Release end of life |publisher= Canonical Ltd. |accessdate= 28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The support period for non-LTS releases is 9 months.&lt;ref name=fridge032013&gt;{{cite web|title= Ubuntu Technical Board Looks at Shuttleworth's Proposal for Release Management Methodology|url= http://fridge.ubuntu.com/2013/03/19/ubuntu-technical-board-looks-at-shuttleworths-proposal-for-release-management-methodology/|publisher= Ubuntu Fridge|accessdate= 20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 13.04, it was 18 months.

==Naming convention==
Ubuntu releases are also given [[code name]]s, using an adjective and an animal with the same first letter (e.g. ''Dapper Drake''). With the exception of the first two releases, code names are in alphabetical order, allowing a quick determination of which release is newer. As of Ubuntu 17.10, however, the initial letter 'rolled over' and returned to 'A'. Names are occasionally chosen so that animal appearance or habits reflects some new feature (e.g., "Koala's favourite leaf is Eucalyptus"; see below). Ubuntu releases are often referred to using only the adjective portion of the code name (e.g. ''Feisty'').&lt;ref name="devCodeNames"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames |title=DevelopmentCodeNames |work=Ubuntu Team Wiki |publisher=Canonical Ltd. |accessdate=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an announcement to the community on 20 February 2009, Mark Shuttleworth explained that 9.10 would focus on improvements in [[cloud computing]] on the server using [[Eucalyptus (computing)|Eucalyptus]], saying "...a Koala's favourite leaf is Eucalyptus",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2009-February/000536.html |title=Introducing the Karmic Koala, our mascot for Ubuntu 9.10 |publisher=Lists.ubuntu.com |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as further improvements in boot speed and development of the [[Ubuntu Netbook Edition|Netbook Remix]].&lt;ref name="koala20Feb09"&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2009-February/000536.html |title=Introducing the Karmic Koala, our mascot for Ubuntu 9.10 |accessdate=21 February 2009 |last=Shuttleworth |first=Mark |mailinglist=ubuntu-devel-announce |date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial announcement of version 9.10 indicated that this release might include a new theme, however the project was moved forward to 10.04,&lt;ref name="koala20Feb09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="softpedia12Jun09"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Ubuntu-9-10-Alpha-1-Released-113881.shtml |title=Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 2 Released – The Karmic Koala Chronicles |accessdate=22 June 2009 |last=Nestor |first=Marius |date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only minor revisions were made to the default theme. Other graphical improvements included a new set of boot up and shutdown splash screens, a new login screen that transitions seamlessly into the desktop and greatly improved performance on Intel graphics chipsets.

In June 2009, Canonical created the [[Paper cut bug|One Hundred Paper Cuts]] project, focusing developers to fix minor usability issues. A "paper cut" was defined as, "a trivially fixable usability bug that the average user would encounter on his/her first day of using a brand new installation of the latest version of Ubuntu Desktop Edition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://launchpad.net/hundredpapercuts |title=One Hundred Paper Cuts |accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The desktop installation of Ubuntu 9.10 replaced [[Pidgin (software)|Pidgin]] with [[Empathy (software)|Empathy Instant Messenger]] as its default instant messaging client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/karmic/i386/empathy |title="empathy" binary package in Ubuntu Karmic i386 |accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The default filesystem is [[ext4]], and the [[Ubuntu One]] client, which interfaces with Canonical's new online storage system, is installed by default.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/karmic/alpha3 |title=Karmic Koala Alpha 3 |publisher=Canonical Ltd. |date=29 October 2009 |accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It introduced [[GNU GRUB|Grub]] 2 beta as default bootloader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 |title=Grub2 - Community Ubuntu Documentation |publisher=Help.ubuntu.com |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also debuted a new application called the [[Ubuntu Software Center]] that unifies package management. Canonical stated their intention for this application to replace Add/Remove Programs (gnome-app-install) in 9.10 and possibly Synaptic, Software Sources, Gdebi and Update Manager in Ubuntu 10.04.&lt;ref name="phoronix27Aug09"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=ubuntu_software_store&amp;num=1 |title=Canonical Unveils The Ubuntu Software Store |accessdate=15 August 2009 |last=Larabel |first=Michael |date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karmic Koala also includes a slideshow during the installation process (through ubiquity-slideshow) that highlights applications and features in Ubuntu.

The new release included, among other things, improved support for [[Nvidia]] proprietary graphics drivers, while switching to the open source Nvidia graphics driver, [[Nouveau (graphics)|Nouveau]], by default. [[Plymouth (software)|Plymouth]] was also introduced, allowing boot animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-nv/+bug/454821/comments/2 |title= Bug #454821 : Bugs : "xserver-xorg-video-nv" package : Ubuntu |accessdate= 24 February 2010 |publisher= Canonical Ltd. |year= 2010}}

[[GIMP]] was removed from the Lucid installation CD due to its professional-grade complexity and its file size. [[F-Spot]] provided normal user-level graphics-editing capabilities and GIMP remained available for download in the repositories.&lt;ref name="Paul24Nov09"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/11/giving-up-the-gimp-is-a-sign-of-ubuntus-mainstream-maturity.ars |title= Giving up the GIMP is a sign of Ubuntu's mainstream maturity |accessdate= 1 May 2010 |last= Paul |first= Ryan |date= November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution emphasized the increasing importance of web services and of [[social networking]] with integrated interfaces for posting to sites like Facebook and Twitter, complementing the IM and email integration already in Ubuntu.

On 4 March 2010 it was announced that Lucid Lynx would feature a new theme, including new logos, taking Ubuntu's new visual style&lt;ref name="UbuntuWikiLightware"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Brand#Light:%20Ubuntu%20is%20Lightware |title= Light: Ubuntu is Lightware |publisher= ubuntu.com |accessdate= 4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; into account:

{{Quote
|The new style in Ubuntu is inspired by the idea of "Light".

We're drawn to Light because it denotes both warmth and clarity, and intrigued by the idea that "light" is a good value in software. Good software is "light" in the sense that it uses your resources efficiently, runs quickly, and can easily be reshaped as needed. Ubuntu represents a break with the bloatware of proprietary operating systems and an opportunity to delight to those who use computers for work and play. More and more of our communications are powered by light, and in future, our processing power will depend on our ability to work with light, too.

Visually, light is beautiful, light is ethereal, light brings clarity and comfort.

Historical perspective: From 2004–2010, the theme in Ubuntu was "Human". Our tagline was "Linux for Human Beings" and we used a palette reflective of the full range of humanity. Our focus as a project was bringing Linux from the data center into the lives of our friends and global family.
}}

The new theme met with mixed critical responses. [[Ars Technica]]'s Ryan Paul said: "The new themes and updated color palette are nice improvement for Ubuntu... After testing the new theme for several hours, I feel like it's a step forward, but it still falls a bit short of my expectations."

Ubuntu 11.04 used the Unity user interface instead of [[GNOME Shell]] as default. The move to Unity was controversial as some [[GNOME]] developers feared it would fracture the community and marginalize GNOME Shell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.computerworld.com/17224/ubuntu_changes_its_desktop_from_gnome_to_unity |title=Ubuntu changes its desktop from GNOME to Unity |author=Mark Shuttleworth |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul26Oct10"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/10/shuttleworth-unity-shell-will-be-default-desktop-in-ubuntu-1104.ars |title=Shuttleworth: Unity shell will be default desktop in Ubuntu 11.04 |accessdate=26 October 2010 |last=Paul |first=Ryan |date=October 2010 |work=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[GNOME]] desktop environment is still available in Ubuntu 11.04 under the title Ubuntu Classic as a fallback to Unity.

Ubuntu 11.04 employed [[Banshee (media player)|Banshee]] as the default music player, replacing [[Rhythmbox]].

In reviewing Ubuntu 11.04 upon its stable release, Ryan Paul of [[Ars Technica]] said "There is a lot to like in Ubuntu 11.04, but also a lot of room for improvement." Jesse Smith of [[Distrowatch]] said "I'm of the opinion there are good features in this release, but 11.04 definitely suffered from being rushed out the door while it was still beta quality. Ubuntu aims to be novice-friendly, but this release is buggy and I think they missed the mark this time around.

[[File:Ubuntu 11.10 Final.png|right|thumb|Ubuntu 11.10 final release (13 October 2011) running Unity 4.22.0]]
The naming of Ubuntu 11.10 (''Oneiric Ocelot'') was announced on 7 March 2011 by Mark Shuttleworth. He explained that Oneiric means "dreamy".&lt;ref name="Shuttleworth07Mar11"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/646|title = Next after Natty?|accessdate =9 September 2011|last = Shuttleworth|first = Mark|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubuntu 11.10 was released on schedule on 13 October 2011 and is Canonical's 15th release of Ubuntu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OneiricReleaseSchedule |title=OneiricReleaseSchedule – Ubuntu Wiki |publisher=Wiki.ubuntu.com |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Shuttleworth announced that Ubuntu 11.10 would not include the classic [[GNOME]] desktop as a fall back to Unity, unlike Ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal. Instead, 11.10 included a 2D version of Unity as a fallback for computers that lacked the hardware resources for the [[Compiz]]-based 3D version. However, the classic GNOME desktop remained available in Ubuntu 11.10 through a package in the Ubuntu repositories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew |url=http://www.webupd8.org/2011/08/installing-using-classic-gnome-desktop.html |title=Installing / Using Classic GNOME Desktop in Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot ~ Web Upd8: Ubuntu / Linux blog |publisher=Webupd8.org |date=24 August 2011 |accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shuttleworth also confirmed that Unity in Ubuntu 11.10 would run as a shell for GNOME 3 on top of GNOME 3 libraries, unlike in Ubuntu 11.04 where it ran as a shell for GNOME 2. Moreover, users were able to install the entire GNOME 3 stack along with [[GNOME Shell]] directly from the Ubuntu repositories; to be presented with a "GNOME 3 desktop" choice at login.&lt;ref name="Shuttleworth07Apr11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/669|title=Celebrating Gnome 3.0|author=Mark Shuttleworth}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the development cycle there were many changes to Unity, including the placement of the Ubuntu button on the Launcher instead of on the Panel, the autohiding of the window controls (and the global menu) of maximized windows, the introduction of more [[Alpha compositing|transparency]] into the [[Unity (user interface)#Features|Dash]] (and the Panel when the Dash was opened) and the introduction of window controls for the Dash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;laquo; &amp;raquo; |url=http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/717 |title=&gt;&gt; Blog &gt;&gt; Dash takes shape for 11.10 Unity |publisher=Mark Shuttleworth |date=16 August 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, it was announced that [[PiTiVi]] would be no longer part of the Ubuntu ISO, starting with Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot. The reasons given for removing it included poor user reception, lack of fit with the default user-case for Ubuntu, lack of polish and the application's lack of development maturity. PiTiVi will not be replaced on the ISO with another video editor. Other changes include removing Computer Janitor, as it caused broken systems for users, and the removal of the [[Synaptic (software)|Synaptic]] package manager, which can optionally be installed via the [[Ubuntu Software Center]]. [[Duplicity (software)|Déjà Dup]] has been added as Ubuntu's backup program.&lt;ref name="Webupd8"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.webupd8.org/2011/06/synaptic-removed-from-ubuntu-1110-deja.html|title = synaptic removed from ubuntu 11.10|accessdate =23 June 2011|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] has replaced the [[Evolution (software)|Evolution]] email client.

Changes in this release include a much faster startup time for the [[Ubuntu Software Center]] and refinements to Unity.

Ubuntu 12.04 incorporated a new [[head-up display]] (HUD) feature that allows [[hotkey]] searching for application menu items from the keyboard, without needing the mouse. Shuttleworth said that the HUD "will ultimately replace menus in Unity applications" but for Ubuntu 12.04 at least the menus will remain.&lt;ref name="Shuttleworth24Jan12"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/939|title = Introducing the HUD.

Ubuntu 12.04 is the first Ubuntu release shipped with [[IPv6]] [[IPv6#Privacy|privacy extensions]] turned on by default. Ubuntu 11.10 already supported IPv6 on the desktop and in the installer ([[IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration|stateless address autoconfiguration]] SLAAC, stateless [[DHCPv6]] and stateful DHCPv6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graber|first=Stéphane|title=Networking in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS - Bonding|url=http://www.stgraber.org/2012/01/04/networking-in-ubuntu-12-04-lts/|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesse Smith of [[DistroWatch]] said that many people, like he, had questioned Ubuntu's direction, including Unity. But with Ubuntu 12.04 he felt that the puzzle pieces, which individually may have been underwhelming, had come together to form a whole, clear picture. He said "Unity, though a step away from the traditional desktop, has several features which make it attractive, such as reducing mouse travel. The HUD means that newcomers can find application functionality with a quick search and more advanced users can use the HUD to quickly run menu commands from the keyboard." He wrote that Unity had grown to maturity, while indicating that he was bothered by its lack of flexibility. He did notice issues, however, especially that the HUD did not work in LibreOffice and performance in a virtual machine was unsatisfactory. He concluded that Ubuntu's overall experience was "head and shoulders above anything else in the Linux ecosystem."&lt;ref name="Smith07May12"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20120507#feature|title = Review of Ubuntu 12.04|accessdate = 1 November 2013|last = Smith|first = Jesse|date = 7 May 2012| work = [[DistroWatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Lynch wrote "Ubuntu 12.04 is definitely worth an upgrade if you're running an earlier version. Unity is finally coming into its own in this release, plus there are other enhancements that make upgrading worthwhile. Ubuntu is getting better and better with each release. I was one of the Unity skeptics initially, but I've come to accept it as part of Ubuntu."&lt;ref name="Lynch09May12"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://desktoplinuxreviews.com/2012/05/09/ubuntu-12-04/|title = Ubuntu 12.04|accessdate = 14 May 2012|last = Lynch|first = Jim|date = 9 May 2012|work = Linux Desktop Reviews|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120518110823/http://desktoplinuxreviews.com/2012/05/09/ubuntu-12-04/|archivedate = 18 May 2012|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Wallen of [[TechRepublic]] – who had strongly criticized early versions of Unity – said "Since Ubuntu 12.04 was released, and I migrated over from Linux Mint, I'm working much more efficiently. This isn't really so much a surprise to me, but to many of the detractors who assume Unity a very unproductive desktop... well, I can officially say they are wrong. [...] I realize that many people out there have spurned Unity (I was one of them for a long time), but the more I use it, the more I realize that Canonical really did their homework on how to help end users more efficiently interact with their computers. Change is hard – period. For many, the idea of change is such a painful notion they wind up missing out on some incredible advancements. Unity is one such advancement."&lt;ref name="Wallen25Jun12"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/opensource/ubuntu-unity-making-the-desktop-seriously-efficient-again/3701|title = Ubuntu Unity: Making the desktop seriously efficient again|accessdate = 1 November 2013|last = Wallen|first = Jack|date = 25 June 2012| work = [[TechRepublic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ubuntu Desktop 12.10.png|thumb|Ubuntu 12.10's default desktop]]
On 23 April 2012 Shuttleworth announced that Ubuntu 12.10 would be named ''Quantal Quetzal''. As this will be the first of a series of three releases before the next LTS release, Shuttleworth indicated that it will include a refreshed look, with work to be done on typography and iconography. The release takes its name from the [[quetzal]], a species of Central American birds.&lt;ref name="Shuttleworth23Apr12"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1121|title = Quality has a new name|accessdate = 23 April 2012|last = Shuttleworth|first = Mark|date = 23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubuntu 12.10 was released on schedule on 18 October 2012 and is Canonical's seventeenth release of the operating system.&lt;ref name="RelSched1210"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QuantalQuetzal/ReleaseSchedule|title = Quantal Quetzal Release Schedule|accessdate = 24 April 2012|last = [[Canonical Ltd]]|date = 23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan Paul, writing for [[Ars Technica]], said in April 2012 when the name was announced "A Quetzal is a colorful bird that is common to Central America. The most well-known variety, the resplendent quetzal, is known for its beauty. The name is a good fit for Ubuntu, which aims to soar in the cloud, offer visual appeal without compromising function, and avoid smacking into closed windows."&lt;ref name="Paul25Apr12"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/04/theming-update-planned-for-ubuntu-1210-codenamed-quantal-quetzal.ars|title = Theming update planned for Ubuntu 12.10, codenamed Quantal Quetzal|accessdate = 30 April 2012|last = Paul|first = Ryan|date = 25 April 2012| work = [[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ubuntu Developer Summit held in May 2012 set the priorities for this release. They are forecast to include an improved boot up sequence and log-in screen, dropping Unity 2D in favor of lower hardware requirements for Unity 3D, wrap around dialogs and toolbars for the [[head-up display|HUD]] and a "[[Vanilla (software)|vanilla]]" version of Gnome-Shell as an option. The release would likely include GNOME 3.6, Python 3 and the 3.5 Linux kernel.&lt;ref name="Sneddon12May12"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/05/uds-q-summary-bye-bye-unity-2d-hello-gnome-shell-spin/|title = UDS-Q Summary: Bye-Bye Unity 2D, Hello GNOME-Shell Spin|accessdate = 12 May 2012|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|date = 12 May 2012| work = OMG!

In July 2012, development versions of Ubuntu 12.10 received a new combined user, session and system menu.&lt;ref name="Sneddon11Jul12"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/07/new-session-menu-lands-in-ubuntu-12-10|title = New Session Menu Lands in Ubuntu 12.10|accessdate = 12 July 2012|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|date = 11 July 2012| work = OMG Ubuntu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This release also included [[Ubuntu Web Apps]], a means of running web applications directly from the desktop, without having to open a browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Noyes |first=Katherine |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/259514/ubuntu_linux_1210_will_integrate_web_apps_into_the_desktop.html |title=Ubuntu Linux 12.10 Will Integrate Web Apps into the Desktop &amp;#124; PCWorld Business Center |work=PC World |date=16 July 2012 |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would use [[Nautilus (file manager)|Nautilus]] 3.4 as its file manager, in place of the 3.5 and newer versions, to retain features deleted from later versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sneddon, Joey |url=http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/08/ubuntu-12-10-will-ship-with-older-version-of-nautilus |title=Ubuntu 12.10 Will Ship With Older Version of Nautilus |publisher=OMG! Ubuntu! |accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Canonical's Kate Stewart announced that the Ubuntu 12.10 image would not fit on a compact disc, saying "There is no longer a traditional CD sized image, DVD or alternate image, but rather a single 800MB Ubuntu image that can be used from USB or DVD."&lt;ref name="Sneddon08Se12"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/09/its-official-the-ubuntu-livecd-is-dead|title = It's Official: The Ubuntu LiveCD is Dead|accessdate = 10 September 2012|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|date = 8 September 2012| work = OMG Ubuntu}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, a third-party project has created a version of Ubuntu 12.10 that fits on a CD. It uses [[LZMA2]] compression instead of the [[DEFLATE]] compression used on the official Ubuntu DVD image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/ubuntucd/ |title=ubuntucd - CD compressed versions of Ubuntu - Google Project Hosting |publisher=Google |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in late September 2012, it was announced that the version of Unity to be shipped with Ubuntu 12.10 would by default include searches of [[Amazon.com]] for searched terms. This move caused immediate controversy among Ubuntu users, particularly with regard to privacy issues, and caused Mark Shuttleworth to issue a statement indicating that this feature is not [[adware]] and labelled many of the objections "FUD" ([[Fear, uncertainty and doubt]]). Shuttleworth stated "What we have in 12.10 isn't the full experience, so those who leap to judgement are at maximum risk of having to eat their words later. Chill out. If the first cut doesn't work for you, remove it, or just search the specific scope you want (there are hotkeys for all the local scopes)." Regardless, users filed a [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]] bug report on the feature requesting that it be made a separate lens and not included with general desktop searches for files, directories and applications. The degree of community push-back on the issue resulted in plans by the developers to make the dash and where it searches user-configurable via a GUI-setting dialogue. Despite concerns that the setting dialogue would not make the final version of Ubuntu 12.10, it was completed and is present in the final version of 12.10.&lt;ref&gt;

In the week prior to the stable release of Ubuntu 12.10 data-privacy advocate Luís de Sousa indicated that the inclusion of the shopping lens, installed without explicit permission of the user, violates [[European Directive 95/46/EC]] on data privacy. That directive requires that the "data subject has unambiguously given his consent" in situations where personal identifying information is sent.&lt;ref name="Sneddon10Oct12"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/10/does-ubuntus-amazon-lens-break-eu-law|title = Blogger Claims Ubuntu's New Shopping Lens Breaks EU Law|accessdate = 11 October 2012|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|date = 10 October 2012| work = OMG Ubuntu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing Ubuntu 12.10 at the end of October 2012 for [[DistroWatch]], Jesse Smith raised concerns about the Amazon shopping lens, saying, "it has raised a number of privacy concerns in the community and, looking over Ubuntu's legal notice about privacy does not provide any reassurance. The notice informs us Canonical reserves the right to share our keystrokes, search terms and IP address with a number of third parties, including Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and the BBC. This feature is enabled by default, but can be turned off through the distribution's settings panel." He also found that the dash provided very slow performance and that the release was "practically unusable in the VirtualBox environment". He summed up his experiences, "After a day and a half of using Ubuntu 12.10 it was an internal struggle not to wipe my hard drive and just find another distribution to review. During the first twenty-four hours Ubuntu spied on me, provided performance which was distinctly sub par, the interface regularly popped up errors (sometimes so frequently the first pop-up wouldn't have faded out of view before the next one appeared), the update notification didn't work and it wasn't possible to turn off accessibility features through the graphical interface. Adding insult to injury, the Unity dash kept locking up or losing focus while I was trying to use it and the operating system crashed more times than not while trying to shutdown or logout. Switching away from Unity to GNOME Fallback helped the performance issues I had experienced with the Dash, but it didn't remove the annoying pop-up errors and performance (while usable) still wasn't as good as I would expect. And what really makes me scratch my head is Ubuntu 12.04 worked really well on this same hardware."&lt;ref name="Smith29Oct12"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20121029#feature|title = Ubuntu 12.10 Desktop|accessdate = 3 November 2012|last = Smith|first = Jesse|date = 29 October 2012| work = [[DistroWatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early November, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] made a statement on the shopping lens issue, "Technically, when you search for something in Dash, your computer makes a secure HTTPS connection to productsearch.ubuntu.com, sending along your search query and your IP address. If it returns Amazon products to display, your computer then insecurely loads the product images from Amazon's server over HTTP. This means that a passive eavesdropper, such as someone sharing a wireless network with you, will be able to get a good idea of what you're searching for on your own computer based on Amazon product images. It's a major privacy problem if you can't find things on your own computer without broadcasting what you're looking for to the world."&lt;ref name="DW05Nov12"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20121105#news|title = DistroWatch Weekly, Issue 481, 5 November 2012|accessdate = 6 November 2012|last = DistroWatch staff|date = 5 November 2012| work = [[DistroWatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing about Ubuntu 12.10 in a December 2012 review, Jim Lynch addressed the Amazon controversy:

{{quote|One of the desktop changes that some folks might not like is the web app link to Amazon.com... This might come across as a bridge too far in terms of the outright commercialization of Ubuntu. And it is an eery {{sic}} reminder of all the garbage that gets installed on Windows PCs by default, by the hardware companies. Is this where Ubuntu is going? Will you someday boot into your Ubuntu desktop only to find tons of commercial crapware clogging up your desktop by default? I sure hope not, as it will be another reason for people to avoid Ubuntu.}}

He concluded by saying, "Overall, Ubuntu 12.10 is a decent upgrade for current Ubuntu users. However, the inclusion of the Amazon icon on the launcher, and the discontinuation of Unity 2D might irritate some people."&lt;ref name="Lynch05Dec12"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://desktoplinuxreviews.com/2012/12/05/ubuntu-12-10/|title = Ubuntu 12.10|accessdate = 6 December 2012|last = Lynch|first = Jim|date = 5 December 2012|work = Linux Desktop Reviews|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121210101221/http://desktoplinuxreviews.com/2012/12/05/ubuntu-12-10/|archivedate = 10 December 2012|df = dmy-all}}

On 17 October 2012, Shuttleworth announced that Ubuntu 13.04 would be named ''Raring Ringtail'' and said about this release "[In the next six months] we want to have the phone, tablet and TV all lined up. So I think it's time to look at the core of Ubuntu and review it through a mobile lens: let's measure our core platform by mobile metrics, things like battery life, number of running processes, memory footprint, and polish the rough edges that we find when we do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shuttleworth|first=Mark|title=Not the Runty Raccoon, the Rufflered Rhino or (even) the Randall Ross|url=http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1195|accessdate=18 October 2012|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing Ubuntu 13.04 Jim Lynch from Desktop Linux Reviews said, "I found Ubuntu 13.04 to be a slightly disappointing upgrade. While there are definitely some enhancements in this release, there's also nothing very special about it ... Alas, there's nothing in Ubuntu 13.04 that makes me want to consider it for use as my daily distro. Don't misunderstand me, there's nothing overtly wrong with Ubuntu 13.04 either. It installed and performed very well for me. Unity 7 also has some helpful and attractive updates that Ubuntu users will enjoy, and there are other things in this release that help improve the overall Ubuntu experience...I suspect it is simply because Ubuntu has settled into a comfortable middle age, it works and it works very well for what it does."&lt;ref name="Lynch25Apr13"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://desktoplinuxreviews.com/2013/04/25/ubuntu-13-04/|title = Ubuntu 13.04|accessdate = 28 April 2013|last = Lynch|first = Jim|date = 25 April 2013| work = Desktop Linux Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consideration was given to changing the default browser from [[Mozilla Firefox]] to [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]], but problems with timely updates to Ubuntu's Chromium package caused developers to retain Firefox for this release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sneddon, Joey |url=http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/05/chromium-to-replace-firefox-as-default-browser-in-ubuntu |title=Chromium Likely to Replace Firefox As Default Browser in Ubuntu 13.10 |publisher=OMG!

Ubuntu 13.10 was intended to be the first Ubuntu release to replace the aging [[X11]] with the [[Mir (display server)|Mir display server]], with X11 programs to have operated through the [[XMir]] [[compatibility layer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sneddon, Joey |url=http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/06/mir-display-server-to-ship-default-in-ubuntu-13-10 |title=Mir To Ship As Default Display Server in Ubuntu 13.10 |publisher=OMG!

Ryan Paul of Ars Technica wrote that although 13.10 brings useful enhancements, it is "a relatively thin update". He also said "the new Dash concept is intriguing, but its usefulness is a bit limited"; and even though he thinks that universal Web search is potentially useful, he's somewhat uncomfortable with how Canonical joins it with local system searches.&lt;ref name=ars_technica_2013-10-17/&gt;

In a review of Ubuntu 13.10 Joey Sneddon of ''OMG Ubuntu'' criticized the new Smart Scopes feature, saying, "it's less of a help and more of a hindrance. With so many web services offering results for a search term – however innocuous it might be – the Dash ends up resembling a wall painted in unintelligible, irrelevant mess." Sneddon noted that internet search engines turn in more useful and better organized results and recommended selectively disabling individual scopes to reduce the noise factor.&lt;ref name="Sneddon17Oct13"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/10/ubuntu-13-10-review-available-for-download|title = Title of Article|accessdate = 18 October 2013|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|date = 17 October 2013| work = OMG Ubuntu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Lynch of ''Linux Desktop Reviews'' described the release as "boring" and noted, "alas, Ubuntu 13.10 follows in the footsteps of Ubuntu 13.04. The big new desktop feature is Smart Scopes ... Beyond that there's not a whole lot that is interesting or exciting to talk about. It turns out that Saucy Salamander is one truly dull amphibian. Canonical really should rename this release to 'Snoozing Salamander' instead." Lynch described the Smart Scopes, "this is a very useful function, and it can save you a lot of time when looking for information. I understand that some people will regard this as a privacy violation, no problem.

Maria Korolov writing for [[Network World]] in December 2013 said of the release, "there is a benefit to be had in being able to search for files you own on both local drives and in cloud services such as Google Drive and Flickr. That's the idea behind Unity Smart Scopes&amp;nbsp;... The result is a cluttered mess.

This version was released on 17 April 2014, and is the 20th release of Ubuntu. Shuttleworth indicated that the focus in this development cycle would be a release characterized by "performance, refinement, maintainability, technical debt" and encouraged the developers to make "conservative choices". [[Technical debt]] refers to catching up and refining supporting work for earlier changes. The development cycle for this release focused on the [[Tablet computer|tablet]] interface, specifically for the [[Nexus 7 (2012 version)|Nexus 7]] and [[Nexus 10]] tablets. There were few changes to the desktop as 14.04 used the existing mature Unity 7 interface. Ubuntu 14.04 included the ability to turn off the global menu system and used locally integrated menus instead for individual applications. Other features were the retention of [[Xorg]] and not [[Mir (software)|Mir]] or [[XMir]], a Unity 8 developers' preview, new mobile applications, a redesigned [[Ubuntu Live USB creator|USB Start-Up Disk Creator]] tool, a new forked version of the [[GNOME Core Applications|GNOME Control Center]], called the Unity Control Center and default [[Trim (computing)|SSD TRIM support]]. [[GNOME]] 3.10 is installed by default.&lt;ref name="Shuttleworth18Oct13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ubuntuwikiTrustyTahrRelease"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TrustyTahr/ReleaseSchedule|title=Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Release Schedule|website=Ubuntu Wiki|dead-url=|access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sneddon15Nov13"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/11/ubuntu-tablet-will-key-focus-ubuntu-14-04-lts-cycle|title = Ubuntu Tablet Will be 'Key Focus' During Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Cycle|accessdate = 15 November 2013|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|date = 15 November 2013| work = OMG!

Joey Sneddon of OMG Ubuntu noted that recent Ubuntu releases have received lower and lower amounts of mainstream press coverage and termed it an "established product that has, by and large, remained a niche interest".&lt;ref name="Sneddon23Apr14"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/04/press-reaction-ubuntu-14-04|title = How has the Press Reacted to Ubuntu 14.04?

In reviewing Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in April 2014, Jim Lynch concluded: "Ubuntu 14.04 seems to be all about refining the Ubuntu desktop. While there are not a lot of amazing new features in this release, there are quite a few very useful and needed tweaks that add up to a much better desktop experience. Canonical's designers seem to be listening to Ubuntu users again, and they seem willing to make the changes necessary to give the users what they want. That may be the single most important thing about Ubuntu 14.04. It could be an indication of a sea change in Canonical's attitude toward Ubuntu users."&lt;ref name="Lynch17Apr14f"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://desktoplinuxreviews.com/ubuntu-reviews/ubuntu-14-04/|title = Ubuntu 14.04 LTS|accessdate = 22 April 2014|last = Lynch|first = Jim|date = 17 April 2014| work =Linux Desktop Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Wallin writing for [[Tech Republic]] termed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, "as polished a distribution as you'll find. It's cleaner, performs better, and is all around improved. Some users may say that this is the most boring release Canonical has unleashed in years, but I believe it to be one of the finest."&lt;ref name="Wallin18Apr14"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.techrepublic.com/article/ubuntu-14-04-wows-through-subtlety/|title = Ubuntu 14.04 wows through subtlety|accessdate = 23 April 2014|last = Wallin|first = Jack|date = 18 April 2014| work = Tech Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry Relph-Knight of [[ZDNet]] said, "although there are no amazing 'must-have' new features in Ubuntu 14.04, it is worth upgrading just to get the latest LTS release with a more recent kernel and default applications."&lt;ref name="Relph-Knight17Apr14"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.zdnet.com/ubuntu-14-04-lts-trusty-tahr-review-solid-and-stable-but-no-big-changes-7000028437/|title = Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) review: Solid and stable, but no big changes|accessdate = 23 April 2014|last = Relph-Knight|first = Terry|date = 17 April 2014| publisher = ZDNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Gilbertson of [[Ars Technica]] stated, "Ubuntu is one of the most polished desktops around, certainly the most polished in the Linux world, but in many ways that polish is increasingly skin deep at the expense of some larger usability issues which continue to go unaddressed release after release."&lt;ref name="Gilbertson23Apr14"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/ubuntu-14-04-review-missing-the-boat-on-big-changes/|title =

===Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn)===
[[File:Ubuntu 14.10 Utopic Desktop.png|thumb|A screenshot of the Ubuntu 14.10 "Utopic Unicorn" desktop with the mascot wallpaper]]

On 23 April 2014 Shuttleworth announced that Ubuntu 14.10 would carry the name ''Utopic Unicorn''.&lt;ref name="Shuttleworth23Apr14"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1363|title = U talking to me?|accessdate = 23 April 2014|last = Shuttleworth|first = Mark|date = 23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UtopicRelease"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UtopicUnicorn/ReleaseSchedule |title=Utopic Unicorn Schedule |publisher=wiki.ubuntu.com |accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 14.10 was released on 23 October, having only minor updates to the kernel, Unity Desktop, and included packages such as LibreOffice and Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird. The kernel was updated to 3.16 for hardware support (e.g. graphics) and has for security, full kernel [[address space layout randomization]] applied to the kernel and its modules, plus the closure of a number of information leaks in /proc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UtopicUnicorn/ReleaseNotes|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UtopicUnicorn/ReleaseNotes|website=wiki.ubuntu.com|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version is the 21st release. Ubuntu 14.10 was officially characterized as a release that addressed "bug fixes and incremental quality improvements" and so it incorporated very few new features.&lt;ref name="1410ReleaseNotes"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UtopicUnicorn/ReleaseNotes|title = Ubuntu 14.10 Release Notes |accessdate = 25 October 2014|last = Wong|first = Anthony|date = 23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joey Sneddon of OMG Ubuntu wrote in reviewing this release, "Ubuntu 14.10, codenamed "Utopic Unicorn", is saddled with a modest changelog, composed largely of bug fixes, stability improvements and key software updates. All worthy, but falls a little way short of the "fresh ideas and new art" that should "raise the roof" – quotes from Mark Shuttleworth's "U” name announcement...For the release taking place in the week of Ubuntu's 10th anniversary, this may all read like a bit of an anticlimax. No headline user features, no visual changes (bar a few new icons for the sidebar of Nautilus) – there's not even a new default wallpaper to look at...But on the flip side it's perhaps the most fitting release; the one that shows just how far Ubuntu has come in the past few years. Mature, dependable and sure in its own (Ambiance-themed) skin, buggy feature churn has given way to a sustained era of assured stability...Ubuntu 14.10 is a rock-solid, hearty and dependable release. Perhaps more here than ever before. There's no getting away from the fact that it's an uninspiring update on paper, and is far from being anything approaching essential."&lt;ref name="Sneddon24Oct14"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/10/ubuntu-14-10-release-download-now|title = Ubuntu 14.10 Released, Ready to Download Now|accessdate = 24 October 2014|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|date = 23 October 2014| work = OMG Ubuntu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Larabel of [[Phoronix]] wrote, "At the end of the day simple end-users won't see much of a difference over Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, which is a bit sad given that this is the tenth anniversary release of Ubuntu Linux. For everyday Linux desktop users the many upgraded packages are great but there isn't too much more to celebrate about today on the desktop front."&lt;ref name="Larabel24Oct14"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTgyMTM|title = Ubuntu 14.10 Officially Released|accessdate = 24 October 2014|last = Larabel|first = Michael|date = 23 October 2014| work = [[Phoronix]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Gilbertson, writing for [[The Register]], explained, "I've been covering Ubuntu for seven of the release's 10 years and 14.10 is the first time I've had to dig deep into the release notes just to find something new to test...If you needed further proof that Canonical is currently solely focused on bringing its Unity 8 interface to mobile devices, 14.10 is the best evidence yet...Almost nothing Canonical develops has changed in this release – there isn't even a new desktop wallpaper. There are some updates to be sure, but they don't hail from Canonical...The lack of updates isn't unexpected, in fact that's been the plan all along...Desktop Ubuntu is currently in a kind of suspended animation, waiting on Unity 8 and Mir to be ready for its coming metamorphosis. The short story is that it makes no sense for Canonical to keep refining Unity 7 when it will soon be retired."&lt;ref name="Gilbertson24Oct14"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/10/24/ubuntu_14_10_review/ |title = Ubuntu's shiny 10th birthday Unicorn: An upgrade fantasy|accessdate = 25 October 2014|last = Gilbertson|first = Scott|date = 24 October 2014| work = [[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ubuntu 15.04 used [[systemd]] instead of [[Upstart]] by default.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Ubuntu-Cloud-Systemd-Default|title=Ubuntu Cloud Switches Over To Using Systemd By Default|work=''phoronix.com''|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This release also featured locally integrated menus by default, replacing the previous default global menus.&lt;ref name="Andrei"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.webupd8.org/2015/03/ubuntu-1504-vivid-vervet-final-beta.html|title = Ubuntu 15.04 Vivid Vervet Final Beta Available For Download|accessdate = 27 March 2015|last = Andrei |first = Alin|date = 27 March 2015| work = webupd8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silviu Stahie, writing for [[Softpedia]], said about this release while it was in beta, "Ubuntu 15.04 is not an exciting release, but that it's only a surface impression. The truth is that it's an important upgrade because some very important changes have been made, including the adoption of systemd. Users will notice that not too many visual changes have been implemented in Ubuntu 15.04, but that was to be expected. The team is transitioning to a new Unity version that is still not ready for general use, so it's easy to understand why Ubuntu 15.04 is not all that different from Ubuntu 14.10."&lt;ref name="Stahie02Apr15"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.softpedia.com/news/See-What-s-New-in-Ubuntu-15-04-Vivid-Vervet-477395.shtml|title = See What's New in Ubuntu 15.04 Vivid Vervet|accessdate = 15 April 2015|last = Stahie|first = Silviu|date = 2 April 2015| work = [[Softpedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This release included modest improvements in [[Intel Haswell]] graphics performance and bigger improvements for [[AMD Radeon]] graphics cards using the open-source [[Radeon R600]] and RadeonSI [[Gallium3D]] drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=ubuntu-1504-radfast&amp;num=1|title=Ubuntu 15.04 Offers Faster OpenGL For AMD Radeon GPUs on Open-Source|last=Larabel|first=Michael|date=24 April 2015|work=Phoronix|dead-url=|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing this release, Joey Sneddon, of ''OMG Ubuntu'', said "Ubuntu 15.04 is yet another solid entry in the distribution's long release history. A dependable desktop operating system suited for end users but with plenty of convenient extras to woo developers with. Though the Unity 7 desktop is largely mothballed as work progresses on the new converged experience with Unity 8, the modest refinements received here buff the experience. Unity in Ubuntu 15.04 shines brighter, a glowing example of a desktop that 'just works' for users.".&lt;ref name="Sneddon23Apr15"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2015/04/ubuntu-15-04-download-new-features|title = Ubuntu 15.04 Released, This Is What's New|accessdate = 23 April 2015|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|date = 23 April 2015| work = OMG Ubuntu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesse Smith of [[DistroWatch]] wrote, "One of the changes I was interested in exploring was Ubuntu's switch from the Upstart init software to systemd. In this regard I was pleasantly surprised. I find most distributions, when they initially make the switch to systemd, introduce bugs or, at the very least, break backward compatibility. Sometimes service managers stop working properly and network device names usually change. Even if everything works as it should, the administrator needs to adjust to systemd's approach to logging and adopt a different method of managing services. Ubuntu has taken an approach I like with regards to adopting systemd." He concluded, "on the surface, Ubuntu 15.04 does not bring many changes. There are a few cosmetic adjustments, but nothing major that desktop users are likely to notice. Most of the interesting work appears to be going on behind the scenes... Ubuntu 15.04 feels very stable and easy to configure. This is an operating system that is virtually effortless to set up and run and I feel the Unity 7 desktop does a nice job of providing lots of features while staying out of the way... All in all, I like what Canonical has done with Ubuntu 15.04. This feels like a small, incremental evolution for Ubuntu and Unity. The init switch, which has disrupted the users of several other distributions, goes largely unnoticed in Ubuntu and I think that is worthy of praise."&lt;ref name="Smith27Apr15"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20150427#ubuntu|title = First impressions of Ubuntu 15.04|accessdate = 28 April 2015|last = Smith|first = Jesse|date = 27 April 2015| work = [[DistroWatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily Werewolf)===
[[File:Ubuntu 15.10 English.png|thumb|Ubuntu 15.10 ''Wily Werewolf'']]
Shuttleworth announced on 4 May 2015 that Ubuntu 15.10 would be called ''Wily Werewolf''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1468|title =Announcing the 'wily werewolf'|accessdate=4 May 2015|last=Shuttleworth|first= Mark|date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially expressed hope that the release would include the [[Mir (software)|Mir]] display server, but it was released on 22 October 2015 without Mir.

Ubuntu 15.10 eliminated the disappearing window edge scrollbars in favour of the upstream GNOME scrollbars, a move designed to save developer time in creating patches and updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2015/08/ubuntu-15-10-drops-unity-overlay-scrollbars|title=Ubuntu 15.10 Ditches Unity Overlay Scrollbars|author=Joey-Elijah Sneddon|work=OMG!

In reviewing the release, Chris Jones wrote, "Ubuntu 15.10 as an operating system for Review is pretty lackluster. There's nothing new as such and there's nothing we can really say that is going to change your opinion from its predecessor, 15.04. Therefore, we recommend you to upgrade either out of habit and according to your regular upgrade schedule rather than out of a specific necessity for a specific feature of this release. Because there is really nothing that could possibly differentiate it from the older, yet still very stable 15.04 release. But if you're going to stick with 15.04 for a little longer, we do recommend that you look at upgrading the kernel to the latest 4.2 branch. It is worth it. If you really want a reason to upgrade?

Joey Sneddon of ''OMG Ubuntu'' noted, "For a release named after a terrifying mythological creature Ubuntu 15.10 is surprisingly tame. There are no dramatic transformations, no bone popping or shirt ripping and certainly no hair sprouting under the milky eye of full moon. In fact, a new wallpaper and change in scrollbar appearance is about as shapeshift-y as this werewolf gets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2015/10/ubuntu-15-10-download-review-new-features|title = Ubuntu 15.10 Available to Download, This Is What's New|accessdate = 22 October 2015|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|work=OMG Ubuntu|date = 22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols of [[ZDNet]] praised the release for its integration of cloud services, such as the new Ubuntu OpenStack cloud deployment and management tool, OpenStack Autopilot as well as its server tools. Ubuntu's machine container hypervisor, LXD, included by default in 15.10, was singled out. Vaughan-Nichols concluded, "with these advances, chances are you're more likely to use Ubuntu, hidden behind the scenes, on clouds and servers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-wily-werewolf-ubuntu-15-10-is-unleashed|title=The Wily Werewolf, Ubuntu 15.10, is unleashed|author=Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Hectic Geek'' review noted problems with [[X.Org Server]] crashes and concluded "If you use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and if it's working out for you, then there really is no need to switch to a non-LTS release, especially to the 15.10."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hecticgeek.com/2015/10/ubuntu-15-10-review/|title=Ubuntu 15.10 Review: Less Exciting &amp; Largely Unchanged|work=Hectic Geek|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review on ''Dedoimedo'' identified problems with Samba, Bluetooth, desktop searching, battery life and the smartphone interface and found the release inconsistent, saying, "unpredictability is horrible. Give me a good experience, or give me a bad experience, but please try not to seesaw between them erratically. Continuous, steady change in behavior, any which way." The review concluded, "it underperforms compared to some of its siblings and ancestors. Not the best, definitely not worth a perma upgrade, but you might find it more palatable to your hardware and use cases. Overall, though Wily isn't the best of distros. It sure gave me the willies. 7/10."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/ubuntu-werewolf.html|title=Ubuntu 15.10 Wily Werewolf review - Fast and spurious|work=''dedoimedo.com''|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Shuttleworth announced on 21 April 2016 that Ubuntu 16.10 would be called ''Yakkety Yak''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1496|title=Mark Shuttleworth {{!}} Blog Archive {{!}} Y is for…|work=''markshuttleworth.com''|date=21 April 2016|last = Shuttleworth|first = Mark|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on 13 October 2016.&lt;ref name="yakkety_release_schedule"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YakketyYak/ReleaseNotes|title=YakketyYak Release Notes|date=22 April 2016|website=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This release features a maintenance version of Unity&amp;nbsp;7, but offers Unity&amp;nbsp;8 packages included in the ISO, so that users can test them. Other improvements include a new version of Ubuntu Software that supports faster loading, better support for installing command-line-only non-GUI applications, support for installing fonts and multimedia codecs and introduction of paid applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/05/what-to-expect-ubuntu-16-10-unity-7|title = What To Expect from Unity 7 in Ubuntu 16.10|accessdate = 9 May 2016|last = Bouvier|first = Scott|date = 9 May 2016| work = OMG Ubuntu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on Linux kernel version 4.8.&lt;ref name="YakRelease"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YakketyYak/ReleaseNotes|title=YakketyYak/ReleaseNotes - Ubuntu Wiki|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version of Ubuntu introduced only minor incremental changes. These included [[LibreOffice]] 5.2, [[GTK3]] version by default, the Update Manager shows [[changelog]] entries for [[Personal Package Archive]]s (PPAs) as well as repository software, [[GNOME]] applications updated to version 3.20, with some using version 3.22. Also [[systemd]] now handles user sessions as well as the previously implemented system sessions.&lt;ref name="YakRelease"/&gt;

Joey Sneddon of OMG Ubuntu said, "Ubuntu 16.10 is not a big update over Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, released back in April. If you were hoping it'd be a compelling or must-have upgrade you'll be sadly disappointed." He did find some improvements, "The Ubuntu Software app is also significantly faster in use. This solves a real pet peeve of mine on the incumbent LTS desktop. Thankfully, Yakkety makes it quicker to find, browser, search and install applications," but concluded, "Ubuntu 16.10 is not a must-have upgrade—not for most people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/10/download-ubuntu-16-10-new-features|title=Ubuntu 16.10 Released, Ready to Download Now|date=13 October 2016|work=''omgubuntu.co.uk''|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marius Nestor of [[Softpedia]] noted, "Ubuntu 16.10 is not an exciting release for fans of the open source operating system. Probably the most important feature of Yakkety Yak is Linux kernel 4.8, which brings support for the latest hardware, but other than that, you'll get some updated components that are mostly based on the old GNOME 3.20 Stack."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/ubuntu-16-10-yakkety-yak-launches-officially-with-linux-kernel-4-8-download-now-509263.shtml|title=Ubuntu 16.10 Yakkety Yak Launches Officially with Linux Kernel 4.8, Download Now|first=Marius|last=Nestor|work=''softpedia.com''|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''Makeuseof'', Bertel King, Jr. said, "If you're feeling underwhelmed, you probably remember the Ubuntu of yesteryear. Back in the days of 8.10, 9.04, and 10.04 each release brought forth a new theme or ambitious feature. Unity first appeared in 10.10 as a netbook interface before replacing the regular desktop in 11.04. By comparison, modern Ubuntu updates feel relatively stagnant. You would be forgiven for not being able to distinguish between 12.04 and 16.10."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/reasons-ubuntu-16-10-yakkety-yak-worth-look/|title=5 Reasons Why Ubuntu 16.10 Yakkety Yak Is Worth a Look|work=''makeuseof.com''|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ubuntu 17.04 ukr.png|thumb|right|Ubuntu 17.04 ''Zesty Zapus'']]

This release dropped support for the 32-bit [[PowerPC]] architecture, following the same move by the upstream [[Debian]] project. Other changes include the default DNS resolver now being ''systemd-resolved'', Linux kernel 4.10, and support for printers which allow printing without printer-specific drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ZestyZapus/ReleaseNotes|title=ZestyZapus/ReleaseNotes - Ubuntu Wiki|work=''ubuntu.com''|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sneddon13Apr17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/04/ubuntu-17-04-review-new-features|title=Ubuntu 17.04 Available to Download Now, This is What's New|last=Sneddon|first=Joey|date=13 April 2017|work=OMG Ubuntu|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nestor13Apr17"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.softpedia.com/news/ubuntu-17-04-zesty-zapus-officially-released-available-to-download-now-514853.shtml|title = Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) Officially Released, Available to Download Now|accessdate = 13 April 2017|last = Nestor|first = Marius|work = [[Softpedia]]|date = 13 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joey Sneddon of ''OMG Ubuntu'' said of this release, "this is no normal release of Ubuntu. It's potentially the last version of the distribution that will come with the Unity 7 desktop by default. That's not a certainty, of course, but we know that Ubuntu will switch to GNOME for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS next year. It's reasonable to expect developers to want to kick a few tyres on that switch ahead of time, in the next interim release. A bittersweet release then, Ubuntu 17.04 sees the distro reach the end of the alphabet in codenames, and the end of an era in everything else. Sadly there's not an awful lot to say. Unity is, by and large, the same as it is in the 16.04 LTS....Ubuntu 17.04 is an iterative update with modest appeal. While there is little compelling reason for anyone running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS to upgrade (especially for those who opt receive the newer hardware enablement stack) it's not an irrelevant release. Ubuntu 16.10 users will want to upgrade to Ubuntu 17.04 for the general around improvements, access to newer apps, and because the truncated support period of these short term releases necessitates it."&lt;ref name="Sneddon13Apr17"/&gt;

Maruis Nestor of [[Softpedia]] called it, "a powerful release, both inside and outside" and noted, "the default desktop environment remains Unity 7, so your beloved Ubuntu desktop environment is not going anyway at the moment. It will also be available in the upcoming Ubuntu 17.10 release, whose development will start next month. After that, starting with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, the GNOME desktop will be used by default."&lt;ref name="Nestor13Apr17"/&gt;

Writer J.A. Watson of [[ZDNet]] said, "I have not been much of an Ubuntu fan for a long time now, but this release includes a lot of significant changes, many of which might address some of my most serious objections about Ubuntu. So I think I should take a closer look at it than I normally do." He noted on printer configuration, "I got a notice that our wireless printer had been successfully configured. I hadn't even thought about trying to set up a printer yet, so that was a very nice surprise - and a good thing to point out to those who are still going around spouting 5+ years out of date information about how difficult it is to use printers with Linux."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/ubuntu-17-10-hands-on-with-artful-aardvark/|title=Ubuntu 17.10: Hands-on with Artful Aardvark - ZDNet|first=J.A.|last=Watson|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewer Scott Gilbertson of [[Ars Technica]] wrote, "Ubuntu 17.10 is a huge departure for Ubuntu, but one that sees the distro seemingly getting its footing back. The transition to GNOME, while not without its pitfalls for some users, is surprisingly smooth. Unity did have some features you won't find in GNOME, but Canonical has done a good job of making things familiar, if not identical. 
More important than individual features in 17.10, this release sees Ubuntu starting over to some degree. The long development process of Unity 8 was threatening to turn it into Godot, but now Ubuntu is free of Unity 8. Its users no longer have to wait for anything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/ubuntu-17-10-return-of-the-gnome/|title = Ubuntu 17.10: Return of the GNOME|accessdate = 2 December 2017|last =Gilbertson |first = Scott|work = [[Ars Technica]] |date = 27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS introduced new features such as colour emoji,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/11/ubuntu-finally-long-last-time-support-color-emoji|title=Ubuntu 18.04 Will Support Color Emoji - OMG!

This release employed Linux kernel version 4.15, which incorporated a CPU controller for the [[cgroups|cgroup]] v2 interface, [[Zen_(microarchitecture)#Enhanced_security_and_virtualization_support|AMD secure memory encryption]] support and improved [[Serial ATA|SATA]] Link Power Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes|title=BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes - Ubuntu Wiki|website=wiki.ubuntu.com|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Michael Larabel of [[Phoronix]] wrote, "Ubuntu 18.04 is mostly an incremental upgrade over Ubuntu 17.10 with updated packages, the switch back to X.Org session by default rather than Wayland, continued presence of Snaps, and a variety of minor user-interface updates. It's really not a big deal going from 17.10 to 18.04 besides the LTS extended support nature, but it is quite a change if upgrading from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. For that upgrade you now have the [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] 7 compiler, Unity 7 to [[GNOME Shell]] by default, and a wealth of other package updates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Ubuntu-18.04-Download|title = Ubuntu 18.04 LTS "Bionic Beaver" Official Images Now Available|access-date = 27 April 2018|last = Larabel|first = Michael|work = [[Phoronix]]|date = 26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS server version, Michael Larabel of Phoronix, indicated that the newly developed text-based installer is an improvement over previous installers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Ubuntu-18.04-Server-Installer|title = The New Ubuntu 18.04 Server Installer Is Working Out Nicely|access-date = 27 April 2018|last = Larabel|first = Michael|work = [[Phoronix]]|date = 27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 November 2018, Mark Shuttleworth announced that Ubuntu 18.04 LTS would be supported for ten years, until April 2028.&lt;ref name="Kerner"/&gt;

===Ubuntu 18.10 (Cosmic Cuttlefish)===
[[File:Ubuntu 18.10.png|thumb|Ubuntu 18.10 ''Cosmic Cuttlefish'']]

On 8 May 2018, Mark Shuttleworth announced that the codename of Ubuntu 18.10, which was released on 18 October 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/06/ubuntu-18-10-release-date-features|title=Ubuntu 18.10: Everything You Need to Know|date=2 June 2018|work=OMG!

The Ubuntu 18.10 installation includes a new theme, named ''Yaru''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/07/yaru-ubuntu-theme|title=The Ubuntu 'Communitheme' Has a New Name - OMG!

Ubuntu!|date=20 August 2018|work=OMG! Ubuntu!|access-date=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new icon theme, ''Suru''.

Installation speeds are faster due to a [[lossless compression]] algorithm known as [[Zstandard]]. Startup speeds of pre-installed [[Snappy (package manager)|Snap applications]] were also improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/09/ubuntu-18-10-beta-download-out|title=Ubuntu 18.10 Beta is Now Available to Download - OMG! Ubuntu!|date=28 September 2018|work=OMG! Ubuntu!|access-date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of 18.10 Joey Sneddon of ''OMG Ubuntu'' wrote, "Ubuntu 18.10 'Cosmic Cuttlefish' is a modest update compared to 18.04. The vast majority of notable improvements are tucked away out of sight, 'under the hood' ... Upstream GNOME Shell developers spent the past six months trying to lower GNOME Shell's memory usage and improve the overall performance of the shell, its animations, display manager, and parts of the GNOME extension framework (specifically Gjs), as we touched on in our recap of the new features in GNOME 3.30. Invisible and abstract though these changes are, they're appreciable. So much so that, if I had to describe this release in just one word it'd be 'peppy'. That's testament to the power of collaboration; with upstream devs and Canonical's engineering team working together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/10/ubuntu-18-10-released-review |title = Ubuntu 18.10 released, but is it worth downloading?|access-date = 19 October 2018|last =Sneddon |first =Joey |work =OMG Ubuntu |date = 19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Larabel of [[Phoronix]] wrote, "Overall, Ubuntu 18.10 "Cosmic Cuttlefish" is quite a modest six-month upgrade for being the first past the Ubuntu 18.04 cycle. Exciting me the most, of course, is simply the package upgrades with riding Linux 4.18 + Mesa 18.2 for a much better Linux gaming experience and having moved on now to GCC8 ... What didn't get achieved for the Ubuntu 18.10 cycle is the long-awaited data viewer to the Ubuntu software/hardware survey introduced in 18.04 LTS... As of writing there's still no public means of being able to view the statistics on these opt-in Ubuntu survey installations. Additionally, the plans for better Android phone integration with the Ubuntu 18.10 desktop by means of bundling GS Connect also didn't happen as planned for the Ubuntu 18.10 cycle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Ubuntu-18.10-Releasing-Todayiew |title = Ubuntu 18.10 Set For Release Today With Some Nice Improvements|access-date = 5 November 2018 |last =Larabel |first =Micheal |work =[[Phoronix]] |date = 18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
