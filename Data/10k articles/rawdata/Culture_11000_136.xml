      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2214">The '''American Society of Naturalists''' was founded in 1883 and is one of the oldest professional societies dedicated to the biological sciences in North America. The purpose of the Society is "to advance and diffuse knowledge of organic evolution and other broad biological principles so as to enhance the conceptual unification of the biological sciences."

Founded in Massachusetts with [[Alpheus Spring Packard Jr.]] as its first president, it was called the '''Society of Naturalists of the Eastern United States''' until 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnat.org/about/history/timeline.html|title=History of the ASN|author=American Society of Naturalists|date=2012|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific journal ''[[The American Naturalist]]'' is published on behalf of the society, which also holds an annual meeting with a scientific program of symposia and contributed papers and posters. It also confers a number of awards for achievement in evolutionary biology and/or ecology, including the [[Sewall Wright Award]] (named in honor of [[Sewall Wright]]) for senior researchers making "fundamental contributions ... to the conceptual unification of the biological sciences", the [[E. O. Wilson]] award for "significant contributions" from naturalists in mid-career, the [[Jasper Loftus-Hills]] Young Investigators Award for promising scientists early in their careers, and also the [[Ruth Patrick]] Student Poster Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnat.org/awards.html|title=Awards|date=2012|author=American Society of Naturalists|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ab'ul Hasan Yamīn ud-Dīn Khusrau''' (1253 – 1325)  ({{lang-fa|ابوالحسن یمین الدین خسرو}}, {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|ابوالحسن یمین‌الدین خسرو}}}}), better known as '''Amīr Khusrow Dehlavī''', was a [[Sufi]] musician, poet and scholar from  [[South Asia]]. He was an iconic figure in the cultural history of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. He was a [[mysticism|mystic]] and a spiritual disciple of [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] of [[Delhi]]. He wrote poetry primarily in [[Persian language|Persian]], but also in [[Hindustani language|Hindavi]]. A vocabulary in verse, the ''Ḳhāliq Bārī'', containing Arabic, Persian, and [[Hindustani language|Hindavi]] terms is often attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rashid|first=Omar|title=Chasing Khusro|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/books/article3672990.ece|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=5 August 2012|location=Chennai, India|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khusrow is sometimes referred to as the "voice of India" (''Tuti-e-Hind''), and has been called the "father of [[Urdu literature]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Amir-Khosrow|title=Amīr Khosrow - Indian poet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Khusrow is regarded as the "father of [[qawwali]]" (a devotional music form of the Sufis in the Indian subcontinent), and introduced the [[ghazal]] style of song into India, both of which still exist widely in India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Latif | first = Syed Abdulla | title = An Outline of the Cultural History of India | publisher = Institute of Indo-Middle East Cultural Studies (reprinted by Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers) | origyear = 1958 | year = 1979 | pages = 334 | isbn = 81-7069-085-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regula Burckhardt Qureshi, Harold S.

Khusrow was an expert in many styles of Persian poetry which were developed in [[Greater Iran|medieval Persia]], from [[Khaqani|Khāqānī's]] ''[[qasida]]s'' to [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami's]]  ''khamsa''. He used 11 metrical schemes with 35 distinct divisions. He wrote in many verse forms including ghazal, masnavi, qata, rubai, do-baiti and tarkib-band. His contribution to the development of the ghazal was significant.&lt;ref name=Iranica&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[Annemarie Schimmel|Schimmel]]|first1=A|title=Amīr Ḵosrow Dehlavī|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/amir-kosrow-poet|website=[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]|publisher=Eisenbrauns Inc|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Basawan - Alexander Visits the Sage Plato.jpg|thumb|''[[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] Visits the Sage [[Plato]]'', from the ''Khamsa'' of Amir Khusrow]]

==Family background==
Amīr Khusrow was born in 1253 at [[Patiyali]] near [[Etah]] in modern-day [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]], in what was then the [[Delhi Sultanate]], the son of Amīr Saif ud-Dīn Mahmūd, a man of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] extraction,

Amīr Khusrow's father, Amīr Saif ud-Dīn Mahmūd, was born a member of the Lachin tribe of [[Transoxania]], themselves belonging to the [[Kara-Khitai]] set of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes.&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.referatu.ru/1/02/734.htm "Амир Хосров Дехлеви", Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Moscow, 1970] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927063804/http://www.referatu.ru/1/02/734.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bashiri"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Poets/Dihlavi.html|title=Central Asia and Iran|website=www.angelfire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He belonged to [[Shahrisabz|Kesh]], a small town near [[Samarkhand]] in what is now [[Uzbekistan]], and that is where he grew up. When he was a young man, that country was despoiled and ravaged by [[Genghis Khan]]'s invasion of [[Central Asia]], and much of the population fled to other lands, India being a favored destination. Amir Saif ud-Din migrated from his hometown of [[Shahrisabz|Kesh]] to [[Balkh]] (now in northern Afghanistan), which was a relatively safe place; from here, they sent representations seeking refuge and succour to the Sultan of distant [[Delhi]]. This was granted, and the group then travelled to Delhi. Sultan [[Iltutmish|Shams ud-Din Iltutmish]], ruler of Delhi, was himself a [[Turkic peoples|Turk]] like them; indeed, he had been raised in the same region of central Asia, and had undergone somewhat similar circumstances in earlier life. He not only welcomed the refugees to his court but also granted high offices and landed estates to some of them. Iltutmish provided shelter and lavish patronage to exiled princes, artisans, scholars and rich nobles. In 1230, Amir Saif ud-Din was granted a [[fief]] in the district of Patiyali.

Ameer khushak married Bibi Daulatnaz, the daughter of Rawat Arz, Hindu noble and war minister of [[Ghiyas ud din Balban|Ghiyas ud-Din Balban]], the ninth Sultan of Delhi. Daulatnaz's family belonged to the [[Rajput]] community of modern-day Uttar Pradesh.&lt;ref name="Bashiri" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC01774508&amp;id=G4YSAAAAIAAJ|title=Islamic Culture|first=Muhammad|last=Asad|date=16 February 2018|publisher=Islamic Culture Board|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Amir Saif ud-Din and Bibi Daulatnaz became the parents of four children: three sons (one of whom was Khusrow) and a daughter. Amir Saif ud-Din Mahmud died in 1260, when Khusrow was only seven years old. After the death of her husband, Khusrow's mother moved back to her father's house in Delhi with her children. It was thus in the house of his Rajput maternal grandfather, Rawat Arz (known by his title as Imad-ul-Mulk), that Khusrow was raised. He thus grew up very close to the culture and traditions of Indian society.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Over and over again in his poetry, and throughout his life, he affirmed that he was an Indian Turk (''Turk-e Hind'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Khilnani |first=Sunil |title=Incarnations: India in 50 Lives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=poiGCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT101 |year=2016 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |isbn=978-0-241-20823-6 |p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khusrow was an intelligent child. He started learning and writing poetry at the age of eight. His first [[Diwan (poetry)|divan]], ''Tuhfat us-Sighr'' (The Gift of Childhood), containing poems composed between the ages of 16 and 18, was compiled in 1271. In 1273, when Khusrow was 20 years old, his grandfather, who was reportedly 113 years old, died.

==Career==
After Khusrow's grandfather's death, Khusrow joined the army of [[Malik Chajju]], a nephew of the reigning Sultan, [[Ghiyas ud din Balban]]. This brought his poetry to the attention of the Assembly of the Royal Court where he was honored.

[[Nasiruddin Bughra Khan|Nasir ud-Din Bughra Khan]], the second son of Balban, was invited to listen to Khusrow. He was impressed and became Khusrow's patron in 1276. In 1277 Bughra Khan was then appointed ruler of [[Bengal]], and Khusrow visited him in 1279 while writing his second divan, ''Wast ul-Hayat'' (The Middle of Life). Khusrow then returned to Delhi. Balban's eldest son, Khan Muhammad (who was in [[Multan]]), arrived in Delhi, and when he heard about Khusrow he invited him to his court. Khusrow then accompanied him to Multan in 1281. Multan at the time was the gateway to India and was a center of knowledge and learning. Caravans of scholars, tradesmen and emissaries transited through Multan from [[Baghdad]], [[Arabia]] and [[Persia]] on their way to Delhi. Khusrow wrote that:
{{quote|I tied the belt of service on my waist and put on the cap of companionship for another five years. I imparted lustre to the water of Multan from the ocean of my wits and pleasantries.}}

On 9 March 1285, Khan Muhammad was killed in battle while fighting [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] who were invading the Sultanate. Khusrow wrote two elegies in grief of his death. In 1287, Khusrow travelled to [[Awadh]] with another of his patrons, Amir Ali Hatim. At the age of eighty, Balban called his second son Bughra Khan back from Bengal, but Bughra Khan refused. After Balban's death in 1287, his grandson [[Muiz ud din Qaiqabad|Muiz ud-Din Qaiqabad]], Bughra Khan's son, was made the Sultan of Delhi at the age of 17. Khusrow remained in Qaiqabad's service for two years, from 1287 to 1288. In 1288 Khusrow finished his first [[Masnavi (poetic form)|masnavi]], ''Qiran us-Sa'dain'' (Meeting of the Two Auspicious Stars), which was about Bughra Khan meeting his son Muiz ud-Din Qaiqabad after a long enmity. After Qaiqabad suffered a stroke in 1290, nobles appointed his three-year-old son [[Shamsuddin Kayumars|Shams ud-Din Kayumars]] as Sultan. A Turko-Afghan named [[Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji|Jalal ud-Din Firuz Khalji]] then marched on Delhi, killed Qaiqabad and became Sultan, thus ending the Mamluk dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate and starting the [[Khalji dynasty]].

Jalal ud-Din Firuz Khalji appreciated poetry and invited many poets to his court. Khusrow was honoured and respected in his court and was given the title "Amir". He was given the job of "Mushaf-dar". Court life made Khusrow focus more on his literary works. Khusrow's ghazals which he composed in quick succession were set to music and were sung by singing girls every night before the Sultan. Khusrow writes about Jalal ud-Din Firuz:
{{quote|The King of the world Jalal ud-Din, in reward for my infinite pain which I undertook in composing verses, bestowed upon me an unimaginable treasure of wealth.}}
In 1290 Khusrow completed his second masnavi, ''Miftah ul-Futuh'' (Key to the Victories), in praise of Jalal ud-Din Firuz's victories. In 1294 Khusrow completed his third divan, ''Ghurrat ul-Kamaal'' (The Prime of Perfection), which consisted of poems composed between the ages of 34 and 41.

After Jalal ud-Din Firuz, [[Alauddin Khalji|Ala ud-Din Khalji]] ascended to the throne of Delhi in 1296. Khusrow wrote the ''Khaza'in ul-Futuh'' (The Treasures of Victory) recording Ala ud-Din's construction works, wars and administrative services. He then composed a khamsa (quintet) with five masnavis, known as ''Khamsa-e-Khusrow'' (Khamsa of Khusrow), completing it in 1298. The khamsa emulated that of the earlier poet of Persian epics, [[Nizami Ganjavi]]. The first masnavi in the khamsa was ''Matla ul-Anwar'' (Rising Place of Lights) consisting of 3310 verses (completed in 15 days) with ethical and Sufi themes. The second masnavi, ''[[Khosrow and Shirin|Khusrow-Shirin]]'', consisted of 4000 verses. The third masnavi, ''[[Layla and Majnun|Laila-Majnun]]'', was a romance. The fourth voluminous masnavi was ''Aina-e-Sikandari'', which narrated the heroic deeds of [[Alexander the Great]] in 4500 verses. The fifth masnavi was ''[[Hasht-Bihisht (poem)|Hasht-Bihisht]]'', which was based on legends about [[Bahram V]], the fifteenth king of the [[Sasanian Empire]]. All these works made Khusrow a leading luminary in the world of poetry. Ala ud-Din Khalji was highly pleased with his work and rewarded him handsomely. When Ala ud-Din's son and future successor [[Qutb ud din Mubarak Shah|Qutb ud-Din Mubarak Shah Khalji]] was born, Khusrow prepared the horoscope of Mubarak Shah Khalji in which certain predictions were made. This horoscope is included in the masnavi ''Saqiana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazratmehboob-e-elahi.org/chapter-IV-1.htm#a|title=Hazrat Mehboob-E-Elahi (RA)|website=www.hazratmehboob-e-elahi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1300, when Khusrow was 47 years old, his mother and brother died. He wrote these lines in their honour:
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
A double radiance left my star this year
Gone are my brother and my mother,
My two full moons have set and ceased to shine
In one short week through this ill-luck of mine.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Khusrow's homage to his mother on her death was:
{{quote|Where ever the dust of your feet is found is like a relic of paradise for me.}}

In 1310 Khusrow became close to a [[Sufi]] saint of the [[Chishti Order]], [[Nizamuddin Auliya]]. In 1315, Khusrow completed the romantic masnavi ''Duval Rani - Khizr Khan'' ([[Deval Devi|Duval Rani]] and Khizr Khan), about the marriage of the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] princess Duval Rani to Khizr Khan, one of Ala ud-Din Khalji's sons.

After Ala ud-Din Khalji's death in 1316, his son Qutb ud-Din Mubarak Shah Khalji became the Sultan of Delhi. Khusrow wrote a masnavi on Mubarak Shah Khalji called ''Nuh Sipihr'' (Nine Skies), which described the events of Mubarak Shah Khalji's reign. He classified his poetry in nine chapters, each part of which is considered a "sky". In the third chapter he wrote a vivid account of India and its environment, seasons, flora and fauna, cultures, scholars, etc. He wrote another book during Mubarak Shah Khalji's reign by name of ''Ijaz-e-Khusravi'' (The Miracles of Khusrow), which consisted of five volumes. In 1317 Khusrow compiled ''Baqia-Naqia'' (Remnants of Purity). In 1319 he wrote ''Afzal ul-Fawaid'' (Greatest of Blessings), a work of prose that contained the teachings of Nizamuddin Auliya.

In 1320 Mubarak Shah Khalji was killed by [[Khusro Khan]], who thus ended the Khalji dynasty and briefly became Sultan of Delhi. Within the same year, Khusro Khan was captured and beheaded by [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughlaq]], who became Sultan and thus began the [[Tughlaq dynasty]]. In 1321 Khusrow began to write a historic masnavi named ''Tughlaq Nama'' (Book of the Tughlaqs) about the reign of Ghiyath al-Din Tughlaq and that of other Tughlaq rulers.

Khusrow died in October 1325, six months after the death of Nizamuddin Auliya. Khusrow's tomb is next to that of his spiritual master in the [[Nizamuddin Dargah]] in Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nizamuddin Auliya]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nihayat ul-Kamaal'' (The Zenith of Perfection) was compiled probably a few weeks before his death.

==Qawwali==

Khusrow is credited with fusing the [[Persian traditional music|Persian]], [[Arabic music|Arabic]], [[Turkish music|Turkish]], and [[Music of India|Indian]] musical traditions in the late 13th century to create [[qawwali]], a form of [[Sufi]] [[devotional music]].&lt;ref name="'Aaj rang hai'- Qawwali revisited"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://twocircles.net/2013mar07/%E2%80%98aaj_rang_hai%E2%80%99_qawwali_revisited.html| title = ‘Aaj rang hai’ - Qawwali revisited|publisher = TwoCircle.net|accessdate = 2013-03-08}}, Retrieved 16 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Qaul (Arabic: قَوْل) is an "utterance (of the prophet)", Qawwāl is someone who often repeats (sings) a Qaul, and Qawwāli is what a Qawwāl sings. The word ''sama'' is often still used in [[Central Asia]] and [[Turkey]] to refer to forms very similar to qawwali.

==Legacy==
[[File:An illustrated manuscript of one of Amir Khusrau's poems 1.jpg|thumb|An illustrated manuscript of one of Amir Khusrow's poems.]]
Amir Khusrow was a prolific classical poet associated with the royal courts of more than seven rulers of the Delhi Sultanate. He wrote many playful riddles, songs and legends which have become a part of popular culture in South Asia. His riddles are one of the most popular forms of [[Hindustani language|Hindavi]] poetry today.&lt;ref name="Sharma 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharma|first1=Sunil|title=Amir Khusraw : the poet of Sufis and sultans|date=2005|publisher=Oneworld|location=Oxford|isbn=1851683623|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a genre that involves double entendre or wordplay.&lt;ref name="Sharma 2005"/&gt; Innumerable riddles by the poet have been passed through oral tradition over the last seven centuries.&lt;ref name="Sharma 2005"/&gt; Through his literary output, Khusrow represents one of the first recorded Indian personages with a true multicultural or pluralistic identity. Musicians credit Khusrau with the creation of six styles of music: qaul, qalbana, naqsh, gul, [[tarana]] and [[khyal]], but there is insufficient evidence for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/14848865/Amir_Khusrau_and_the_Indo-Muslim_Identity_in_the_Art_Music_Practices_of_Pakistan|title='Amir Khusrau and the Indo-Muslim Identity in the Art Music Practices of Pakistan'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbr-olderissues.com/2013/07/amir-khusro-his-influence-on-indian-classical-music/2/|title='Amir Khusro and his influence on Indian classical music'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amir Khusro’s putative associations with the Tarana run much deeper. One of the most persistent legends of Hindustani music relates to the encounter between Amir Khusro, who was then associated with the court of emperor Allauddin Khalji, and Gopal Nayak, court-musician to the king of Devagiri. Allauddin commanded Gopal Nayak to present the Raga Kadambak for six evenings running. During the entire performance, Khusro lay concealed under the emperor’s throne, and stealthily absorbed all that the Nayak had sung. On the seventh day, he astonished everyone present in the court by reproducing all that Gopal Nayak had presented. However, since he couldn’t follow the Nayak’s language, he substituted the text of the compositions with meaningless syllables. And that is how the Tarana was born! (Willard 1834: 121) &lt;ref name="Willard 1834"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willard|first1=N. Augustus|title=A Treatise on the Music of Hindoostan|date=1834|location=Calcutta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of Hindavi===
Khusrow wrote primarily in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Many [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] (historically known as Hindavi) verses are attributed to him, since there is no evidence for their composition by Khusrow before the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yexgmTQIYhUC&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=khusro+Hindavi+not+found&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNu5vk9PvPAhWixlQKHZiJAkUQ6AEIKzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=khusro+Hindavi+not+found&amp;f=false|title=In the Bazaar of Love: The Selected Poetry of Amir Khusrau|first=Paul E.|last=Losensky|date=15 July 2013|publisher=Penguin UK|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khusrau's Hindvi Poetry, An Academic Riddle?  Yousuf Saeed, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the Hindustani verses appears to be relatively modern. He also wrote a war ballad in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tariq |first=Rahman |title=Punjabi Language during British Rule |journal=JPS |volume=14 |issue=1 |url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/14.1_Rahman.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915130644/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/14.1_Rahman.pdf |archivedate=15 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he spoke [[Arabic]] and [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref name="Bashiri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=0EyzM4P-BRg_7_Uy3O&amp;id=rIERAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=amir+turkish+languages&amp;dq=amir+turkish+languages|title=Hazrat Amir Khusrau of Delhi|first=Mohammad|last=Habib|date=16 February 2018|publisher=Islamic Book Service|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=0C7hnlv8H6koanH7-A&amp;id=BYFOgfXExOAC&amp;q=amir+khusrau+Hindi+and+Persian+turkish&amp;dq=amir+khusrau+Hindi+and+Persian+turkish|title=Islamic Culture|first=Muhammad|last=Asad|date=16 February 2018|publisher=Islamic Culture Board|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=0efs2nt1eZuFtt03T7&amp;id=Ka_nKgqedWEC&amp;q=amir+boli+ai+na+Turki&amp;dq=amir+boli+ai+na+Turki|title=Amir Khusrau: Memorial Volume|first=Amīr Khusraw|last=Dihlavī|date=16 February 1975|publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=0efs2nt1eZuFtt03T7&amp;id=Ka_nKgqedWEC&amp;q=amir+turkish+languages&amp;dq=amir+turkish+languages|title=Amir Khusrau: Memorial Volume|first=Amīr Khusraw|last=Dihlavī|date=16 February 1975|publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN8125020225&amp;id=MbGyZN1I4E0C&amp;pg=PA92|title=Indian Literary Criticism: Theory and Interpretation|first=G.

===700th Birth Anniversary===
In 1976 the renowned Pakistani musician [[Khwaja Khurshid Anwar|Khurshid Anwar]] played a key role in observing the 700th birth anniversary of Amir Khusrow. Since he was also a musicologist, he wrote one of his rare music articles on Amir Khusrow, "A gift to posterity". In addition, he actively planned music events and activities throughout 1976. In Pakistan, Anwar had also been praised for his efforts to keep alive [[classical music]] not only through his many film compositions in Pakistan, but also through his unique collection of classical music performances recorded by [[EMI]] Pakistan, known as ''Aahang-e-Khusravi'' in two parts in 1978. The second part of the ''Aahang-e-Khusravi'' recordings was known as ''Gharanon Ki Gaiyki'' which consisted of audio recordings of representatives of the main [[gharana]]s of classical singers in Pakistan on 20 audio cassettes. All this was meant to be a tribute to Amir Khusrow.&lt;ref&gt;http://films.hindi-movies-songs.com/k-anwar.html, Pakistani musician Khurshid Anwar's tribute to Amir Khusrow in 1976 on his 700th Birth Anniversary, Retrieved 18 Jan 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shalimar Bagh Inscription==
Inscribed in the top terrace of the [[Shalimar Bagh, Srinagar|Shalimar Bagh]], [[Srinagar]] (now in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[India]]), are some famous phrases in Persian, which are sometimes attributed to Khusrow, although are not found in any of his written works:
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
Agar Firdaus bar ru-ye zamin ast,
Hamin ast o hamin ast o hamin ast.
&lt;/poem&gt;
In English: "If there is a paradise on earth, it is this, it is this, it is this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/window-to-persia/article1930559.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | first=Anjana | last=Rajan | title=Window to Persia | date=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/zubin-mehta-s-concert-mesmerises-kashmir-113090700518_1.html|title=Zubin Mehta's concert mesmerises Kashmir|first=Press Trust of|last=India|date=7 September 2013|publisher=|via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Zubin-Mehtas-concert-mesmerizes-Kashmir/articleshow/22397384.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Zubin Mehta's concert mesmerizes Kashmir - The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratively a [[psychological horror]] set in an abandoned sawmill nestled high in the Italian mountains, ''Anna'' challenges the player to uncover horrific clues and use them to solve puzzles related to the player character's dark past. The player's behavior does determine the mental health of the main character and change locations and unveil new secrets leading to different endings.

On 13 April 2013, the ''Extended Edition'' was released which added new environments, puzzles, user interface, music, improved graphics, and a new character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/04/16/anna-extended-edition-improves-ui-horror-based-on-player-feed/|title=Anna - Extended Edition improves UI, horror based on player feedback|last=Conditt|first=Jessica|date=16 April 2013|work=[[Joystiq]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/217690/|title=Anna - Extended Edition|work=[[Steam (software)|Steam]]|publisher=[[Valve Corporation]]|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The storyline of ''Anna'' concerns an amnesiac man who dreams of a sawmill in the mountains near his town. He decides to go there to find out its connection to his missing memories and a woman named "Anna" who seems to be calling out for him, and enters the house by solving puzzles in the garden. He becomes aware that the house is haunted after seeing several strange phenomena.

As the protagonist explores, he begins to hear voices belonging to himself and the eponymous Anna, among others. Through these voices and texts found throughout the sawmill, he discovers that he has had an obsessive history with an ancient deity named Anna that he had since forgotten. However, the plot is ambiguous from this point; one interpretation holds that in times of yore, Anna would lure men into worship, causing them to murder those close to them or starve themselves at the feet of her statue, and after she seduced the protagonist, he murdered his own wife and children for threatening his relationship with Anna. The other interpretation paints the protagonist as the villain, meeting a human avatar of Anna in the forest and falling in love with her. However, after she left because of his obsession with her and abusive personality, he sacrificed children to summon her again.

The game has three main endings; in an inversion of the norm, the more effort that is put into achieving an ending, the less optimistic the conclusion will be. In the first scenario, the protagonist concludes that Anna was burnt as a witch centuries ago and leaves the house, vowing never to return. In the second ending, the protagonist reminisces about Anna, realizes that he cannot live without her, and opens himself up to possession by her, joining the multitude of mannequins that are found throughout the house. In the third ending, the protagonist remembers killing his real wife after she defiled Anna's statue, and finds the statue, along with dolls of his children, in a small chamber. As the tunnel to the chamber caves in, he realizes that he will stay in the chamber forever, but he does not care because he has "Anna" with him.

The plot is ambiguous due to the uncertainty of the protagonist as to whether or not the sawmill is real or merely a dream, as well as the strange phenomena that occur throughout the story and the vague and unconnected nature of the voices.

==Development==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
Dreampainters, the development studio, based the story on legends from the Val D'Ayas region of Italy, particularly one about a sawmill where a lumberjack killed his family. They claimed that the game's focus was on mystery-solving and exploration, with the player being able to discover the plot at their own pace. One of Anna's particularly infamous features, the ability to pick up any object (no matter if it will be used later on in the game), was apparently based on the developers' hatred for adventure games and cartoons where the important objects were made more obvious to the viewer.

Anna would reportedly have a feature whereby the game would interpret the player's actions to try and scare them; for example, if a player focused on a particular object for too long, that object would appear more often. However, no such feature appeared in the game. Dreampainters also claimed that the extent of the protagonist's descent into madness would determine the ending, but the ending was actually determined by when the player decided to leave the sawmill.

''Anna'' received mixed reviews from critics. The graphics, story and sound were praised, but it was criticized for the obscurity of its narrative, complexity of its interface, and difficulty of its puzzles. The horror elements were both praised and criticized by different reviews; IGN said that the lack of death removed any sense of threat, while [[Zero Punctuation]] praised the horror but claimed the immersion was broken by the necessity of a walkthrough. It received a score of 49.13% on [[GameRankings]]&lt;ref name="GR"/&gt; and 55/100 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;

[[File:Iowa archaeology edgewater.JPG|thumb|300px|Excavations at the Late Archaic [[Edgewater Park Site]] in Coralville]]

The '''archaeology of Iowa''' is the study of the buried remains of [[human]] [[culture]] within the [[U.S. state]] of [[Iowa]] from the earliest [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] through the late [[history|historic]] periods. When the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were [[Hunter-gatherer|hunters and gatherers]] living in a [[Pleistocene]] [[glacier|glacial]] landscape. By the time [[Culture of Europe|European]] explorers visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]] (10,500–2,800 years ago) American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased. More than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing [[domestication|domesticated]] plants. The subsequent [[Woodland period]] saw an increase on the reliance on [[agriculture]] and social complexity, with increased use of [[mound]]s, [[ceramic art|ceramics]], and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of [[maize]] and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements. The arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the [[Protohistory|Protohistoric]] period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. During the Historical period European traders and American Indians in Iowa gave way to American settlers and Iowa was transformed into an agricultural state.&lt;ref name="Alex2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alex|first=Lynn M.|title=Iowa's Archaeological Past|publisher=University of Iowa Press|year=2000|url=http://uipress.uiowa.edu/books/pre-2002/aleiowarc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iowa archaeologists==
[[File:Efmo orr marching bears group.jpg|thumb|Ellison Orr’s and Theodore Lewis’ 1910 sketch of effigy mounds near [[McGregor, Iowa]], now part of Effigy Mounds National Monument.]]
Archaeologists have studied the prehistory of Iowa since the mid-19th century, when large American Indian mounds were first observed along the Mississippi. Early archaeologists such as S.V. Proudfit and Theodore Lewis documented large sites such as earthworks, mounds, and earthlodges.&lt;ref&gt;Proudfit, S. V. (1880) Antiquities of the Missouri Bluffs. ''American Antiquarian'' 3:271–280; Lewis, Theodore H. (1885) Effigy Mounds in Iowa. ''Science'' 6(146):453–454&lt;/ref&gt; Truly systematic recording of Iowa sites began with [[Charles R. Keyes]] and Ellison Orr’s surveys and excavations beginning in the 1920s. Documenting hundreds of sites, often just before they disappeared under the plow, Keyes’ and Orr’s work led to the formation of the Iowa Archaeological Survey, the [[Iowa Archeological Society]], and the designation of [[Effigy Mounds National Monument]]. After their deaths in 1951, the Survey was disbanded, and their efforts were continued by the [[University of Iowa]]’s Department of Sociology and Anthropology, which formed the Office of the State Archaeologist&lt;ref&gt;Iowa Office of the State Archaeologist, {{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525000157/http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/ |archivedate=2008-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (OSA) in 1959.&lt;ref name="Alex2000" /&gt; The OSA maintains an extensive list of more than 23,000 recorded archaeological sites in Iowa, and conducts survey and excavation across the state. Other institutions conducting archaeological research in Iowa include the [[State Historical Society of Iowa]], the [[Iowa Archeological Society]], the [[University of Iowa]], [[Iowa State University]], [[Grinnell College]], [[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]], and private archaeological firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/aia/aiamember.htm |title=Association of Iowa Archaeologists: Membership Directory |publisher=Uiowa.edu |accessdate=2009-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716233054/http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/aia/aiamember.htm |archivedate=2009-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional archaeologists in Iowa are represented by the Association of Iowa Archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Iowa Archaeologists, {{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/aia/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709003458/http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/aia/index.html |archivedate=2008-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iowa archaeology grew dramatically beginning in the 1960s with the introduction of [[Cultural Resources Management]] legislation that required archaeological survey and excavation at many federal projects in Iowa.&lt;ref name="Alex2000" /&gt;

==Paleoindian (13,500–10,500 years ago)==
[[File:Clovis Rummells Maske.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Clovis point]]s from the Rummells-Maske Cache Site, [[Cedar County, Iowa]].]]
[[Paleoindian]] hunters and gatherers were the first occupants of Iowa, entering the state at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] glacial period. At the time the state was covered by tundra, conifer forests, and deciduous forests. Areas immediately north of Des Moines extending to Minnesota were covered by the receding Des Moines Lobe, a large glacier system.  Highly mobile, their sites are scattered across Iowa and are noted for their large stone points. While Paleoindians were traditionally viewed as big game hunters, more recent research suggests much of their subsistence was derived from small game and wild plants. Paleoindian points are found throughout Iowa, but almost no intact Paleoindian sites have been excavated, probably because they were ephemeral and are now either destroyed by plowing or are very deeply buried in river valleys.&lt;ref name="Alex2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iowa's Earliest Residents, {{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/Silos/Ice_Age_Residents.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410072540/http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/Silos/Ice_Age_Residents.html |archivedate=2010-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clovis and other Early Paleoindian===
The oldest artifacts found in Iowa are [[Clovis culture|Clovis]] points, large lanceolate points found occasionally in all parts of the state except for the Des Moines Lobe. Possible sources of game were giant Pleistocene megafauna, including mammoth, mastodon, and giant forms of bison, all of which are now extinct. While widespread, only two Clovis sites have been excavated in Iowa. The Rummells-Maske site is a Clovis site in Cedar County; unfortunately, this site was damaged by plowing, although 20 points and point fragments were recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Adrian D., and Joseph A. Tiffany (1972) Rummells-Maske: A Clovis Find-Spot in Iowa. ''Plains Anthropologist'' 17:55–59&lt;/ref&gt; The Carlisle Clovis Cache Site in [[Warren County, Iowa|Warren County]] contained 38 unfinished stone tools that appear to date to the Clovis period, but these results have not yet been published.&lt;ref&gt;The Carlisle Cache, {{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/Silos/Carlisle_Cache.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410073018/http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/Silos/Carlisle_Cache.html |archivedate=2010-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Iowa Early Paleoindian points include Gainey, a point that appears to be intermediate between Clovis and Folsom. Gainey points were also recovered at Rummells-Maske. While [[Folsom point]]s are found throughout Iowa, especially western Iowa, none have been excavated in a well-preserved site.&lt;ref&gt;Alex 2000:49–50; Morrow, Julie, "The Early Paleoindian Period" {{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/learn/prehistoric/paleo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516071031/http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/learn/prehistoric/paleo.htm |archivedate=2008-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dalton and other Late Paleoindian===
At the beginning of the glacial-free [[Holocene]] Epoch, humans in Iowa utilized projectile point found throughout the mid-continent, including [[Dalton point|Dalton]], Fayette, [[Agate Basin point|Agate Basin]], and [[Hell Gap complex|Hell Gap]].  Humans were still highly mobile, and by this time most of the Pleistocene megafauna had gone extinct. As with the Early Paleoindian period, no intact Late Paleoindian sites have been excavated in Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;Alex 2000:50–53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaic Period==
The Archaic is the longest period of Iowa prehistory, lasting about 8,000 years. Overall, populations appear to have increased in Iowa during the Archaic, despite a changing climate. During this time American Indians transitioned from highly mobile hunters and gatherers with large ranges towards a focus on local resources and ecosystems. Domesticated plants appeared in Iowa towards the end of the Archaic.&lt;ref name="Alex2000" /&gt;

===Early Archaic (10,500–7,500 years ago)===
During the Early Archaic period regional variation in point forms is seen in Iowa, and Indians adapted to more localized forms of hunting and gathering while probably maintaining seasonal movements from camp to camp.&lt;ref name="Alex2000" /&gt; Common stone tool types are Corner-notched St. Charles points and Thebes Knives. Soon Hardin and Kirk points appear in Iowa as well.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, Toby; "The Late Paleoindian/Early Archaic Period" {{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/learn/prehistoric/lpaleo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516042404/http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/learn/prehistoric/lpaleo.htm |archivedate=2008-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavated Early Archaic sites in Iowa include the Soldow Site,&lt;ref&gt;Flanders, Richard E.

''Journal of the Iowa Archeological Society'' 24:125– 147&lt;/ref&gt; Horizons IIIa and II of the [[Cherokee Sewer Site]],&lt;ref name="Alex2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson, Duane C. 1980"&gt;Anderson, Duane C., and Holmes A.

''Plains Anthropologist'' 5:65–70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Archaic (7,500–5,000 years ago)===
Temperatures rose in the mid-continent during the Middle Archaic, a warming trend known as the [[Holocene climatic optimum|Hypsithermal]]. Grasslands expanded east, forests became less common, and many Iowa lakes shrank or disappeared. Humans responded by diversifying their subsistence strategy: eastern Iowa saw a shift towards river resources, and western Iowa towards Plains resources. Excavated sites in eastern and central Iowa include the Brash Site,&lt;ref&gt;Collins, James M. (1995) Lithic Technology and Temporal Variation at a Chert Workshop in Central Iowa. ''Journal of the Iowa Archeological Society'' 42:8–20&lt;/ref&gt; the Gast Spring Site,&lt;ref name="Alex2000" /&gt; and the Ed’s Meadow Site.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, Toby A. (1998) ''Phase III Excavations at the Ed’s Meadow Site (13DM712).'' Office of the State Archaeologist, University of Iowa, Iowa City&lt;/ref&gt; Western Iowa sites include the Turin Site,&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Alton K. (1985) Turin: A Middle Archaic Burial Site in Western Iowa. ''Plains Anthropologist'' 30:195–218&lt;/ref&gt; Horizon I of the [[Cherokee Sewer Site]],&lt;ref name="Anderson, Duane C. 1980"/&gt; and the Pony Creek Site.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Brian (1973) The Concept of an Altithermal Cultural Hiatus in Northern Plains Prehistory. ''American Anthropologist'' 75:1221–1253&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Archaic (5,000–2,800 years ago)===
In the Late Archaic the climate became more similar to modern with the end of the [[Holocene climatic optimum|Hypsithermal]]. The number of Late Archaic Sites increased in Iowa, perhaps reflective of increased populations allowed by climate change and new subsistence strategies. The Late Archaic sees the first indication of mound building in Iowa, as well as direct evidence of domesticated plants, and large, long-term settlements. The [[Red Ocher Culture]] appeared in northeast Iowa, associated with copper artifacts and mound building. Numerous Late Archaic sites have been excavated in eastern Iowa, some showing the gradual adaptation of [[cultigen]]s, including [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[Hordeum pusillum|little barley]], [[Iva annua|marsh elder]], and [[Echinochloa|barnyard grass]].&lt;ref&gt;Crops of Ancient Iowa, {{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/Silos/Most_Ancient_Crops.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410072442/http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/Silos/Most_Ancient_Crops.html |archivedate=2010-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sites with evidence for early cultigens in Iowa include the [[Edgewater Park Site]] in Coralville,&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, William E., Michael T. Dunne, Joe Alan Artz, Sarah E. Horgen, and Mark L. Anderson (2007) Edgewater Park: A Late Archaic Campsite along the Iowa River. ''Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology'' 32(1):4–46; http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3904/is_200704/ai_n19433705&lt;/ref&gt; the Gast Spring Site,&lt;ref name="Alex2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, Michael T., and William Green (1998) Terminal Archaic and Early Woodland Plant Use at the Gast Spring Site (13LA152), Southeast Iowa. ''Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology'' 23(1):45–88&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sand Run Slough West Site.&lt;ref&gt;Alex 2000:76–77&lt;/ref&gt; In western Iowa, Late Archaic sites are common, however large bison killing or processing sites are less common than before, and there is little evidence for the use of domesticated plants.&lt;ref&gt;Alex 2000:78–79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Woodland Period==
[[File:Effigy Mounds Iowa Sny Magill.JPG|thumb|Woodland conical mounds at [[Effigy Mounds National Monument]], Sny Magill Unit, Clayton County, Iowa.]]
During the Woodland period, many American Indians in Iowa shifted away from hunting and gathering and used more domesticated plants, although wild food was still important. [[Ceramic art|Ceramics]], the [[Bow (weapon)|bow and arrow]], [[mound|burial mounds]], and evidence of political and social hierarchy became common at Woodland sites in Iowa.&lt;ref name="Alex2000" /&gt;

===Early Woodland (800 BC–200 BC)===
The Early Woodland period saw the introduction of ceramics to Iowa, including Marion Thick and Black Sand types. Marion Thick may have originated with the nucleated Late Archaic cultures of the Upper Midwest, and was widespread in distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Alex 2000:88; Klippel, Walter E. (1972) An Early Woodland Period Manifestation in the Prairie Peninsula. ''Journal of the Iowa Archeological Society'' 19:1–91&lt;/ref&gt; Early Woodland Indians in eastern Iowa built large burial mounds in the Mississippi River region, and participated in long-distance trade of exotic raw material. This long-distance trade may have been the forerunner of the later Havanna-[[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] trading sphere. In north-central Iowa, Early Woodland peoples appear to have interacted more directly with the [[Prairie lake|Prairie Lakes]] region of [[Minnesota]]. Numerous Early Woodland sites have been excavated in Iowa, including the Gast Spring Site,&lt;ref name="Alex2000" /&gt; and many sites which have not been formally published.&lt;ref&gt;Alex 2000:87–98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Woodland (200 BC–400 AD)===
The Middle Woodland Indians of eastern Iowa participated at the edge of the Havana and Hopewell interaction networks. This cultural connection to the East is seen in the construction of large mounds, earthworks, and the trade of exotic goods over very long distances. There were several large earthwork enclosures in Iowa along the Mississippi that date to the Middle Woodland period, but none in the interior of the state, indicating Iowa is the western edge of Havana-Hopewell influence.&lt;ref name="iowaenclosures"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whittaker|first=William|author2=William Green|title=Early and Middle Woodland Earthwork Enclosures in Iowa|journal=North American Archaeologist|year=2010|volume=31|issue=1|pages=27–57|url=http://baywood.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=0197-6931&amp;volume=31&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=27|accessdate=18 December 2010|doi=10.2190/NA.31.1.b|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130128193017/http://baywood.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=0197-6931&amp;volume=31&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=27|archivedate=28 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Toolesboro Mound Group]] in Louisa County included a large octagonal earthen enclosure that covered several acres; earthworks of this style are indicative of the monumental construction once seen in [[Havana, Illinois]] along the Illinois River and sites in the Ohio River drainage including Chillicothe and Newark, Ohio. [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] trading networks were quite extensive, with [[obsidian]] from the [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] area, [[copper]] from [[Lake Superior]], and shells from the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] appearing in Middle Woodland Iowa sites. Sites in eastern Iowa appeared to nucleate, vacating much of the hinterlands.&lt;ref&gt;Alex 2000:100–109&lt;/ref&gt; Western Iowa appears to have been not directly involved in this exchange network, and the Havana-Hopewell flourishing did not extend much above the [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] area of the [[Missouri River]].&lt;ref&gt;Alex 2000:112–115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Woodland (400–1250 AD)===
The Late Woodland Period was once considered to be relatively unimportant and uninteresting compared to earlier and later periods, but recent research shows unexpected cultural complexity.&lt;ref name="Alex2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benn and Green 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Late Woodland sites are more dispersed than Middle Woodland sites, but they are apparently more numerous. Gone are the complex earthworks and long-distance trade networks, but this does not appear to be a cultural collapse, since Late Woodland sites and artifact types overlap with and transition from Middle Woodland sites.  Technical changes of the Late Woodland include the use of true arrow heads, thinner and larger ceramics with less elaborate decorations, and the adaptation of new crops, including [[maize]].&lt;ref&gt;Alex 2000:115–118&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous regional variations and phases have been defined in Iowa, based in large extent on differences of ceramic form and decoration.&lt;ref name="Alex2000" /&gt; Excavations at Late Woodland sites are common, some of these sites showing surprising complexity. The [[Gast Farm Site]] excavations revealed a complex settlement associated with a midden of refuse 100 m in diameter. Large storage and food processing pits, trash middens, and other features were excavated. Occupants utilized acorns, other nuts and fruits, goosefoot, little barley, maygrass, sunflower, fish, birds, deer, muskrat, and turtle. There was little evidence of long-distance trade.&lt;ref&gt;Benn, David W., and William Green (2000) Late Woodland Cultures in Iowa.

===Effigy Mounds===
The Late Woodland in Iowa is perhaps best known for [[effigy mounds]], large, low mounds shaped like animals such as birds and bears. Effigy mounds are distributed across southern [[Wisconsin]], northern [[Illinois]], and northeast Iowa. A large concentration of mounds in several groups is preserved at [[Effigy Mounds National Monument]]. Like most mounds in Iowa, excavation reveals that these mounds were commonly used as sacred burial locations but contain few artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;Lenzendorf, Dennis (2000) ''Effigy Mounds: A Guide to Effigy Mounds National Monument. '' Eastern National, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt; Recent ground-penetrating radar survey of selected mounds at Effigy Mounds National Monument reveal that many are badly disturbed, but others appear to be comparatively intact.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, William E., and Glenn R.

==Late Prehistoric (900–1600)==
[[File:Indians of Des Moines.png|thumb|Map of archaeology of Fort Des Moines in downtown[[Des Moines]]]]
[[Maize]] appears to have been the catalyst for change in the Late Prehistoric period in Iowa. While maize had been a minor crop in the Woodland Period, many archaeologists believe new varieties of maize were introduced to the region that produced higher yields, allowing for a population boom. This increase in population, combined with the potential for surplus and growing tensions over control of territory, appears to have led to large nucleated settlements throughout the eastern U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Alex 2000:142–145&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this manifested itself earliest along the Mississippi south of Iowa, the earliest Late Prehistoric cultures appeared in the western part of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Alex 2000:138–139&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Oasis (ca. 900–1100)===
[[Great Oasis]] sites appeared in the Missouri River drainage, and have attributes of both Late Woodland and Late Prehistoric cultures. Great Oasis cultures extended through the eastern Plains from Iowa to South Dakota. Developing independently from the eastern Mississippian cultures, Great Oasis sites display large sites along major stream terraces, increased reliance on agriculture combined with hunting and gathering, substantial pit earth lodges, and a transition from Late Woodland to Late Prehistoric ceramic forms. Overall, Great Oasis appears to have been a regional adaptation of new forms of farming and settlement patterns, including seasonal occupation of different ecological zones, that includes aspects of Late Woodland and the subsequent [[Middle Missouri Tradition]].&lt;ref name="Alex2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Adrian D. (1961) The Glenwood Sequence: a Local Sequence for a Series of Archaeological Manifestations in Mills County, Iowa.

In ''North American Archaeology'', [[Timothy Pauketat]] and D. D. Loren (eds.), pp.&amp;nbsp;161–186. Blackwell, Boston&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mill Creek and Glenwood (1100–1300)===
[[File:Glenwood earthlodge.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed Glenwood earthlodge, [[Glenwood, Iowa]]]]
In northwestern Iowa, Great Oasis underwent dramatic changes as Mill Creek sites appeared. While Mill Creek has many stylistic similarities with Great Oasis and some Mill Creek sites contain Great Oasis ceramic forms, Mill Creek sites are substantially different. Mill Creek sites became nucleated, often fortified, had a much higher dependence on [[maize]] and bison hunting, show substantial evidence of long-distance trade, and appear to have been occupied year-round. The [[Phipps Site|Phipps]] and [[Chan-Ya-Ta Site|Chan-Ya-Ta]] sites are classic examples. [[Glenwood culture]] sites in southwest Iowa near the Missouri River appear to be unrelated to the earlier Great Oasis sites, and are notable for their large [[earthlodge]] sites. Glenwood sites appear to have been more oriented in lifeways and trade with the [[Central Plains Tradition]] cultures to the west than with the Mississippian cultures to the southeast. Around 1300 AD Mill Creek and Glenwood sites in Iowa disappeared, replaced by the rapidly spreading Oneota cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Alex 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, William (1991) The Paul Rowe Archaeological Collection: A Key to Central Plains Prehistory. ''Plains Anthropologist'' 36:79–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Michael J. (1998) An Archeological Survey of the Lower Pony Creek Valley: Implications for Glenwood Locality Settlement Pattern.

''Journal of the Iowa Archeological Society'' 49:11–26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oneota (1250–1700)===
[[File:Birds Run Site Des Moines.jpg|thumb|right|Excavation of the Oneota component of the Birds Run Site in [[Des Moines]]]]
Very large [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] centers appeared around AD 1000, with enormous [[Platform mounds|earthen pyramids]], [[palisade]]s, and extreme social hierarchy. The earliest large Mississippian center was [[Cahokia]], east of [[St. Louis]]. Cahokia appears to have dominated trade in the upper Mississippi, with satellite or closely aligned settlements as far as [[Aztalan State Park|Aztalan]] in Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="Alex2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, T. E., and R. B. Lewis (eds.) (1991) ''Cahokia and the Hinterlands: Middle Mississippian Cultures of the Midwest. '' University of Illinois Press, Urbana, Illinois&lt;/ref&gt; In Iowa, there is little evidence of Mississippian occupation, and the Late Woodland lasts longer in the east than in the west. This is puzzling, given the proximity to Mississippian cultures; it is possible that the nearby presence of the large, hierarchal Mississippian trading network inhibited local development.&lt;ref name="Alex2000" /&gt; After the decline of the Cahokia network after AD 1250 the local Late [[Woodland period|Woodland]] populations expanded in complexity, developing large nucleated villages and their own trading network, known as [[Oneota]]. Oneota, named by Charles Keyes for a [[Upper Iowa River|river in northeast Iowa]], was a large cultural manifestation that covered the Upper Midwest at the edge of the Mississippian cultures.  Oneota sites are easily identifiable by the globular, shell tempered pots, which typically have strap handles and incised designs.  Pots of this kind were well designed for the cooking of porridge and foods made from the various cultivated foods of the area. Important Oneota sites in Iowa include Kingston,&lt;ref&gt;Straffin, Dean F. (1971) ''The Kingston Oneota Site.'' Research Report 2. Office of the State Archaeologist, University of Iowa, Iowa City&lt;/ref&gt; Mckinney,&lt;ref&gt;Alex 2000:197–198&lt;/ref&gt; Christenson,&lt;ref&gt;Benn, David W.

(1959) Oneota Sites on the Upper Iowa River. ''The Missouri Archaeologist'' 21(2–4)&lt;/ref&gt; After the decline of the Mill Creek and Glenwood cultures in western Iowa, Oneota cultures appeared across the state. It is widely accepted that the Oneota were the ancestors of modern American Indian tribes associated with Iowa, including the [[Ioway]], [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago), [[Otoe tribe|Otoe]], [[Missouria]], and [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]].&lt;ref name="Alex2000" /&gt;

==Protohistoric (1600–1800)==
[[File:Iowa catlinite pipe wanampito.jpg|thumb|Catlinite pipe, probably Ioway, from the Protohistoric Wanampito Site (13BM16), Bremer County, Iowa.]]
Protohistoric refers to the period when American Indians were exposed to European trade items and large population shifts occurred because of introduced European diseases and warfare, but there is very little direct written documentation. Explorers such as [[Jacques Marquette|Marquette]] and [[Louis Joliet|Joliet]] occasionally documented American Indians along the Mississippi in Iowa, but it was not until the early 19th century that regular written accounts of American Indians in Iowa became common. American Indians in the early Protohistoric period continued many aspects of Oneota culture, but soon almost all indigenous technology disappeared, including ceramics and stone tool production.&lt;ref&gt;Alex 2000:211–226&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this period that the [[Meskwaki]] (Fox) and [[Sauk people|Sauk]] appeared in eastern Iowa, displaced from their homelands in the east.

==Historical (1800–present)==
[[File:De Smet Council Bluffs.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre-Jean De Smet]]'s map of the [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] area (1839), showing Native American villages and early American settlement.]]
The earliest European forts and settlements were established by traders beginning in the 1680s. Almost none of these ephemeral early historical sites have been located archaeologically. [[Julien Dubuque]]’s Mines of Spain settlement and adjacent Meskwaki village occupied in the late 18th century and early 19th century, has been the subject of numerous archaeological surveys.&lt;ref&gt;Alex 2000:227&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fort Madison]] (1808–1813), the first American settlement and the first American fort in Iowa, was partially excavated in 1965.&lt;ref name="mckusick2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKusick|first=Marshall B.|title=Frontier Forts of Iowa: Indians, Traders, and Soldiers, 1682–1862|editor=William E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5978">'''Bundling''', or '''tarrying''', is the traditional practice of wrapping two people in a bed together, usually as a part of [[courting]] behavior. The tradition is thought to have originated either in the [[Netherlands]] or in the [[British Isles]] and later became common in [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial United States]],&lt;ref&gt;History of Sex, Love and Sexuality 1750 America and Bundling, The People's Almanac [http://www.trivia-library.com/a/history-of-sex-love-sexuality-1750-america-and-bundling.htm 1975 - 1981]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Stiles | first=Henry Reed | year=2005 | title=Bundling: Its Origin, Progress and Decline | edition=reprint | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | isbn=978-1-4179-8628-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Pennsylvania Dutch Country]]. Some [[Nebraska Amish]] may still practice it. When used for courtship, the aim is to allow [[intimacy]] without [[sexual intercourse]].

==Origin==
It is possible the precedent for bundling came from the [[Bible|biblical]] story of Ruth and Boaz, in which Ruth, a young widow, and Boaz, an older wealthy landowner, spend a night together in a grain storage room while not touching; the pair later get married.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Ruth.3:9-14;Ruth.4:13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courtship practice==
Traditionally, participants were adolescents, with a boy staying at the residence of the girl. They were given separate blankets by the girl's parents and expected to talk to one another through the night. Occasionally a ''bundling board'' or bundling sack was placed between the boy and girl to discourage sexual conduct.

== In United States ==
In [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial United States]], [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and other preachers condemned bundling;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marsden|first=George|title=Jonathan Edwards: A Life|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300129946|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeGd_Ry34_MC&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;ots=gv6GO_MWjE&amp;dq=%22jonathan%20edwards%22%20bundling&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jonathan%20edwards%22%20bundling&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet the practice continued into the period of the early Republic, when if beds were scarce, travelers occasionally were permitted to bundle with locals.  This seemingly strange practice allowed extra money to be made by renting out half a bed.  Some hotels rented rooms for the night, shared by many occupants, and sharing a bed entailed an additional fee.

It is possible that, as late as the mid-19th century, bundling was still practiced in [[New York (state)|New York]] state and perhaps in [[New England]], though its popularity was waning.  The court case of ''Graham v. Smith'', 1 Edm.Sel.Cas. 267 (N.Y. 1846), for example, initially argued before Judge Edmunds in the Orange Circuit Court of New York, concerned the [[Seduction (tort)|seduction]] of a 19-year-old woman; testimony in the case established that bundling was a common practice in certain rural social circles at the time. By the 20th century, bundling seems to have disappeared almost everywhere, except for the more conservative   [[Amish|Old Order Amish]] [[Subgroups of Amish|affiliations]], where it is still in use in the 21st century, regardless of location.&lt;ref&gt;Shachtman, pp. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
The writer [[Washington Irving]], in chapter 7 of ''[[Knickerbocker's History of New York]]'' as well as other of his works, refers to bundling as a Yankee practice.
&lt;blockquote&gt;This amazing increase may, indeed, be partly ascribed to a singular custom prevalent among them, commonly known by the name of bundling—a superstitious rite observed by the young people of both sexes, with which they usually terminated their festivities, and which was kept up with religious strictness by the more bigoted part of the community.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In the media==
Gabriel Edward Martin, [[Heath Ledger]]'s character in the 2000 film ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]'', is bundled when he spends an overnight visit at the home of  Anne Patricia Howard ([[Lisa Brenner]]), the girl that he is courting.

[[Anna Gunn]]'s character in the HBO series ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' mentions removing a bundling board from their bed in Season 2, Episode 2.

In the TV series [[Salem (TV series)|''Salem'']] during Season 1, Episode 7, "Our Own Private America", adolescent teens are seen bundling. The girl breaks the sack.

In the TV serie [[A Discovery of Witches (TV series)|A Discovery of Witches]] during Season 1, episode 5, Matthew de Clairmont and Diana Bishop discuss the "bundling" custom.

'''Caribbean art''' refers to the [[visual arts|visual]] (including [[painting]], [[photography]], and [[printmaking]]) as well as [[plastic arts]] (such as [[sculpture]]) originating from the islands of the Caribbean (for mainland-Caribbean see ''[[Caribbean South America]]''). Art in the Caribbean reflects thousands of years of habitation by [[Arawak people|Arawak]], [[Kalinago]], and other people of the Caribbean followed by waves of immigration, which included artists of European origins and subsequently by artists with heritage from countries all around the world (including countries in the African continent). The nature of Caribbean art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their [[personal life | lives]] in the Caribbean.

The governments of the Caribbean have at times played a central role in the development of Caribbean culture. However, some scholars and artists challenge this governmental role. Historically and in later times artists have combined British, French, Spanish, Dutch and African artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles and at other times working to promote [[Caribbean nationalism|nationalism]] by developing distinctly Caribbean styles. Caribbean art remains the combination of these various influences.

==Early influences==
[[Image:Arawak jug stvincent.png|thumb|x130px|left|''Arawak ceremonial jug (St. Vincent ca.500)'']]
The first immigrants (said to be originally from the [[Orinoco|Orinoco basin]]) to the Caribbean region were the ''"Indians"'' or Taíno (those found throughout much of the Greater and Lesser Antilles), and the Arawak (those found in South America and part of Trinidad). These early Caribbean's are supposed to have occupied the region since 2000BC. In Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, the Taíno-Arawak art has been found in stone carvings, figurines (which are essentially curvilinear) and pottery dating from the period before European contact and are said to be as old as twenty-four hundred years. These few discovered artifacts, preserved in museum collections, have contributed new culturally hybrid art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=JBMHS|first=.|title=Arawak Art and Artifacts|journal=Journal of Barbados Museum Historical Society|publisher=Barbados: Museum Historical Society|date=1960–1965|volume=27,30,32,36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not until the 1950s and 1960s did a small number of Caribbean artists began to renew and in some cases re-invent indigenous art forms. Currently there are no indigenous artists practicing in any media in the Caribbean.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Art in the colonial period (from 1496)==
[[Image:Theodor De Bry - Central America 1594.jpg|thumb|170px|right|super|Caribbean - [[Theodor de Bry|T. de Bry]] - 1594]]
The settlement in the Caribbean islands began by the Spanish on the island of Hispaniola as early as 1496. They then settled on Puerto Rico followed by Cuba. They did not colonise Trinidad until 1592. It is extremely unlikely that the Taíno-Arawak people had any input to the spaniade artistic developments since it has been estimated that their population was quickly depleted from 200,000 to as little as 500.

[[Image:Samuel de Champlain Carte geographique de la Nouvelle France.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Map of New France made by Samuel de Champlain in 1612.]]
French settlers arrived in the Caribbean in the 1625 and established trading ports on the islands of St. Kitts, Tortuga (in 1628, now a British Virgin Island) in [[Saint-Domingue]] (later [[Haiti]]), [[Martinique]], and [[Guadeloupe]] (both in 1635). Near the end of the 17th century, the population of the [[French Caribbean]] was growing steadily but the territory was increasingly isolated from France because in 1674 the French trading company finally failed, and few artists had arrived from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Arthur P.|title=The European Nations in the West Indies, 1493&amp;ndash;1688|publisher=London: |year=1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently little or no research has been done to highlight the early French influenced art forms originating in the Caribbean, nor to list artists who might fit within this category.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Although Trinidad was never governed by the French, the islands original settlers, the Spanish, allowed planters from the French islands to settle and develop the country from about 1777.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moron|first=G.|title=A History of Venezuela|publisher=London: Allen and Unwin|year=1964|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of French occupation can be seen in the names of places and to a smaller extent in the laws of the country - so it is highly possible that art also may have early French influences. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

[[Image:Imported Photos 00010.JPG|thumb|''Turgoart (Haiti), Another Call From Africa, 2009'']]
According to [[Jamaica]]n art historian Petrine Archer, "there is sparse evidence of local art production in any of the islands prior to the 20th century" other than from the occasional visiting European.&lt;ref name="petrinearcher"&gt;{{cite web|last=Archer|first=Petrine|title=Caribbean Art Archives|url=http://www.petrinearcher.com/afro-caribbean-art-1914-present|publisher=PetrineArcher.com|year=1998|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haiti]] was a lone exception.

==Contemporary trends in Caribbean art==
Art made in the Caribbean by living Caribbean artists refers to a range of visual, media, performance, and other practices that are critically acclaimed. There has been much debate over whether a national style, philosophical outlook, or unified and cohesive culture exists or ever has existed within the Caribbean. Geographically it is large, with many distinct regions, and its population are diverse and made up of varying national and ethnic backgrounds. Also distinctions between "high art" and "popular" art seem to be becoming less clear, making the task of locating common characteristics of Caribbean art or culture increasingly difficult.

Tumelo Mosaka, curator at the Brooklyn Museum (NY) suggests:
{{quote|"''Today, consistent throughout most islands is the division between mainstream artist movements more closely related to European stylistic trends and often rooted in national development, and self-taught artists whose art works reflect ritual preoccupations related to spiritual movements such as [[Revivalism]], [[Santería]] and [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] and less exposure to art movements abroad. More recently, contemporary artists influenced by post-modernism's concerns with identity have found ways to fuse both forms resulting in art  that appear peculiarly unique to their Caribbean experience''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosaka (curator)|first=Tumelo|title=Infinite Island (exh. cat.)|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/infinite_island/|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|date=17 Sep 2007|accessdate=10 Nov 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Mosaka, T.]]|''Brooklyn Museum (NY)''}}

There are, however, a few notable moments when Caribbean contemporary artists — as individuals or groups — have distinguished themselves through commonality, international recognition, collaboration, or "the spirit of the times".

Modern art in the Caribbean reflects an engagement with the region's cultural past. Archer describes recent trends as "a self-conscious and satirical embracing of cultural memory styled in unconventional settings, installations and off-the-wall works that straddle African traditions and European post-modern ideas of 'primitive' creativity." It is an imagery and history which is yet to be resolved.&lt;ref name="petrinearcher" /&gt;

A '''Chemist In Training''' ('''CIT''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] designation for someone who has obtained a [[academic degree|degree]] from an accredited institution that qualifies for registration with one of the provincial or territorial chemical professional associations,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pchem.ca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocq.qc.ca/fr/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102101620/http://www.ocq.qc.ca/fr/ |archivedate=2009-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acpo.on.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; but has not yet achieved the additional requirements (like relevant supervised work experience) to become accredited as a [[Professional Chemist]] (P.Chem.).

==Licensure==
A licensed CIT is certified to work in a [[chemistry]] profession. Upon completing a certain amount of work experience under the supervision of a Licensed Professional Chemist (P.Chem.) as determined by a [[licensing board]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pchem.ca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocq.qc.ca/fr/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102101620/http://www.ocq.qc.ca/fr/ |archivedate=2009-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acpo.on.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; a CIT is then eligible to gain experience by supervision from a P.Chem.

While being a certified CIT may help in obtaining a chemistry related job, it is not typically required to do chemistry work. All work performed by an CIT must still be checked and certified by a P.Chem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4303">The '''Commission for the Study of the Tribal Composition of the Population of the Borderlands of Russia''' ({{lang-ru|Комиссия по изучению племенного состава населения России и сопредельных стран}}, shortened to ''КИПС'', ''KIPS'') was set up in February 1917 by [[Sergey Oldenburg]] under the auspices of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. Its aim was to support the war effort as expert-produced [[ethnography|ethnographic]] knowledge was important during a war "conducted to a significant degree in connection with the nationality question".

The commission was composed of twelve leading Russian Ethnographers based in [[St Petersburg]]: [[Aleksey Shakhmatov]], [[Mikhail Diakonov]], [[Nikolai Marr]], [[Vasily Bartold]], [[Vladimir Peretts]], [[Evfimii Karskii]] from the Academy of Sciences, [[Sergei Rudenko]] and [[Fedor Volkov]] from the Anthropological Society of [[St Petersburg University]], [[Andrei Rudnev]] and [[Lev Shcherba]] from the University's Philological Society and [[David Zolotarev]] and [[Nikolai Mogiliansky]] from the [[Imperial Russian Geographical Society|Russian Geographical Society]]'s Ethnographic Division.

The commission was charged with the task of producing maps of those areas which "lie on of both sides" of [[Russia]]'s [[Europe]]an and [[Asia]]tic borders and which are "contiguous with our enemies".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5EkCwriGDOoC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;dq=%22David+Zolotarev%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=uvDlY8t0U_&amp;sig=KMRlfcpbm-7EaE_dsbdpiGTSKjY&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;hl=en Hirsch, Francine. 2005. ''Empire of Nations: Ethnographic Knowledge and the Making of the Soviet Union.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press] {{ISBN|0-8014-4273-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], [[Ruthenia]] [[Bukovina]] and parts of [[Bessarabia]] in Europe and parts of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Caucasus]] bordering [[Iran]].

Different ethnographers advocated different approaches: Karskii wanted to focus on native language, whereas Rudenko favoured more [[physical anthropology]] – particularly to assess the suitability of local people for integration into the war effort. Following the example of the map commission of the Russian Geographical Society, they adopted a different process in Europe and Asia. They used previous material gathered by the map commission to make maps of former Russian Imperial territory then occupied by the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] – thereby preventing any fieldwork. However to the East they dispatched ethnographic field trips which would help get a better picture of how language groups were diffused across [[Central Asia]].

==Under the Provisional Government==
Owing to the political turmoil following the [[February Revolution]], the Commission did not get much work done until September 1917, following Oldenburg's brief stint as [[Minister of Education]]. With funding from that ministry, the commission met four times in September (5th, 8th, 9th and 25th). By early October it was working with the National Department of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs]]. This included drafting legislation to ensure that local languages were used in local government and particular regulations to protect the [[Kyrgyz people|Kirgiz]] from Russian domination in [[Central Asia]]. In October the Provisional Government issued an official statement on the nationality question which guaranteed minority rights. They also set up the ''Commission on Nationality Affairs'' with Oldenburg at its head. However, on October 24 the [[Bolshevik]]s staged their coup. Despite his [[Kadet Party|Kadet]] sympathies, Oldenburg entered into negotiations with [[Lenin]] on behalf of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and in 1918 when Oldenburg and six other representatives of the Academy signed an agreement with the Soviet regime, three of these were members of KIPS.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, Francine.

'''Corn dollies''' or '''corn mothers''' are a form of [[straw]] work made as part of [[harvest]] customs of Europe before mechanization.

Before [[Christianisation]], in traditional [[pagan]] European culture it was believed that the spirit of the corn (in modern American English, "corn" would be "grain") lived amongst the crop, and that the harvest made it effectively homeless. [[James Frazer]] devotes chapters in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' to "Corn-Mother and Corn-Maiden in Northern Europe" (chs. 45–48) and adduces European folkloric examples collected in great abundance by the [[folklorist]] [[Wilhelm Mannhardt]]. Among the customs attached to the last [[wikt:sheaf|sheaf]] of the harvest were hollow shapes fashioned from the last sheaf of [[wheat]] or other [[cereal|cereal crops]]. The corn spirit would then spend the winter in this home until the "corn dolly" was [[plough]]ed into the first furrow of the new season.

==Background==
[[James George Frazer]] discusses the [[Vegetation deity|Corn-mother and the Corn-maiden]] in [[Northern Europe]], and the harvest rituals that were being practised at the beginning of the 20th century: [[File:Claidheach.jpg|right|240px]]{{quote|In the neighbourhood of [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] the person who cuts the last ears of corn makes them into a doll, which is called the Corn-mother or the Old Woman and is brought home on the last waggon. In some parts of [[Holstein]] the last sheaf is dressed in women's clothes and called the Corn-mother. It is carried home on the last waggon, and then thoroughly drenched with water. The drenching with water is doubtless a rain-charm. In the district of [[Bruck an der Mur|Bruck]] in [[Styria]] the last sheaf, called the Corn-mother, is made up into the shape of a woman by the oldest married woman in the village, of an age from 50 to 55 years. The finest ears are plucked out of it and made into a [[wreath]], which, twined with flowers, is carried on her head by the prettiest girl of the village to the farmer or [[squire]], while the Corn-mother is laid down in the barn to keep off the mice. In other villages of the same district the Corn-mother, at the close of harvest, is carried by two lads at the top of a pole. They march behind the girl who wears the wreath to the squire's house, and while he receives the wreath and hangs it up in the hall, the Corn-mother is placed on the top of a pile of wood, where she is the centre of the harvest supper and dance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Bough'', chapter 45&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many more customs are instanced by Frazer (see link). For example, the term "Old Woman" ([[Latin]] ''[[wikt:vetula|vetula]]'') was in use for such "corn dolls" among the [[Germanic paganism|Germanic pagans]] of [[Flanders (county)|Flanders]] in the 7th century, where [[Saint Eligius]] discouraged them from their old practices: "[Do not] make vetulas, (little figures of the Old Woman), little deer or iotticos or set tables [for the house-elf, compare [[Puck (mythology)|Puck]]] at night or exchange [[New Year]] gifts or supply superfluous drinks [a [[Yule]] custom]."&lt;ref name="ouen"&gt;{{cite book | last =Saint Ouen of Rouen | authorlink =Ouen | author2 =trans. Jo Ann McNamara | title =The Life of Saint Eligius (''Vita Sancti Eligii'') | url =http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/sto09001.htm | deadurl =bot: unknown | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130508085024/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/sto09001.htm | archivedate =2013-05-08 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer writes: "In East Prussia, at the rye or wheat harvest, the reapers call out to the woman who binds the last sheaf, “You are getting the Old Grandmother....In Scotland, when the last corn was cut after Hallowmas, the female figure made out of it was sometimes called the [[Cailleach|Carlin or Carline]], that is, the Old Woman."&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, ch. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials used==
* [[Great Britain]]: mainly [[wheat]], [[oat]]s, [[rye]] and [[barley]]
* [[Ireland]]: [[Juncaceae|rush]]
* [[Southern France]]: [[palm tree|palm]] leaves

With the advent of the [[combine harvester]], the old-fashioned, long-stemmed and hollow-stemmed wheat varieties were replaced with knee-high, pithy varieties. However, a number of [[England|English]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] farmers are still growing the traditional varieties of wheat, such as [[Maris Wigeon]], Squarehead Master, Elite Le Peuple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strawcraftsmen.co.uk/faq_straw.php |title=Guild of Straw Craftsmen - Frequently asked questions |publisher=Strawcraftsmen.co.uk |date=2008-08-16 |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because they are in great demand in [[thatcher (profession)|thatching]], a craft which is enjoying a renaissance, with customers facing long waiting lists for having their roofs thatched or repaired.

==Types==
Corn Dollies and other similar harvest straw work can be divided into these groups:

===Traditional corn dollies named after counties or place names of Great Britain and Northern Ireland===
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Stafford Knot corn dolly.jpg|[[Stafford knot]]
File:SuffolkHorseshoe.jpg|[[Suffolk]] Horseshoe
File:YorkshireSpiral.jpg|[[Yorkshire]] Spiral or Drop Dolly
&lt;/gallery&gt;
* '''Other corn dollies include''' Anglesey Rattle, Cambridgeshire Umbrella, Durham Chandelier, Claidheach (Scotland) Herefordshire Fan, Kincardine Maiden (Scotland), Leominster Maer (Herefordshire), Norfolk Lantern, Northamptonshire Horns, Okehampton Mare, Oxford Crown, [[Suffolk]] Bell, Suffolk Horseshoe and Whip, Teme Valley Crown (Shropshire), Welsh Border Fan, Welsh Long Fan, Worcester Crown.
* There are also corn dolly designs from other countries, for example the Kusa Dasi from [[Turkey]], named after the town of [[Kuşadası]].

===Countryman's favours and other harvest designs===
A '''countryman's favour''' was usually a [[Braid|plait]] of three straws and tied into a loose knot to represent a heart. It is reputed to have been made by a young man with straws picked up after the harvest and given to his loved one. If she was wearing it next to her heart when he saw her again then he would know that his love was reciprocated. Three straws can be plaited using the hair plait or a cat's foot plait. Favours can be made with two, three, four or more straws.

'''Other examples include:'''
* Bride of the Corn ("Aruseh" in North Africa)
* Devonshire Cross, a harvest cross from [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]], [[Devon]]
* Dedham Cross
* [[St Brigid]]'s Cross; the [[National Museum of Ireland]] has many examples of harvest crosses.

===Fringes===
* Larnaca Fringe
* Montenegrin Fringe
* [[Lancashire]] Fringe

===Large straw figures===
[[File:Swedish straw goat.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A Swedish [[Christmas goat]] or [[Yule goat]].]]
These are representations of deities, animals or spirits, made from an entire sheaf. They are known by a variety of names, depending on location and also the time of harvesting:
* The Goddess [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]]
* Maiden or Bride (harvest before [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]]):
* Kirn Dolly (Roxburghshire)
* Kirn Baby (Lothians)
* [[Crying The Neck|The Neck]] (Cornwall and Devon)
* Hare ([[Galloway]])
* Lame Goat, [[Scottish Gaelic]]: gobhar bacach ([[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]], [[Isle of Skye|Skye]], Glenelg)
* Straw dog - strae bikko ([[Shetland]], [[Orkney]])
* [[Cailleach]] Gaelic: Old Woman or The Hag (harvest after All Saints)
* [[Gathering Day|Caseg Fedi]] or harvest mare in Wales.
* 'Y Wrach' or 'The Hag' in Caernarvonshire, Wales
* [[Whittlesey]] Straw Bear, the centre of a ceremony in Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, every January. Its origins are obscure.

===Tied straw work===
Here the straw is not plaited, but tied with yarn, wool, raffia or similar. This type of straw work is particularly popular in [[Scandinavia]] and [[German language|German]]-speaking countries. Examples of these are the '''Oro''' (Swedish Straw Crown); the '''[[Tomte]]''' or '''Nisse''' (Yule dwarfs); and smaller versions of the Yule Goat.

Image:ReindeerGarland.jpg|Reindeer garland
Image:ZLargeTiedStar.jpg|Large tied star
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Ridge finials===
* These are straw sculptures which are placed on the ridge of the [[Thatching|thatched roof]]. They are sometimes purely for decoration, but can be the signature of a particular thatcher. Animal shapes (birds, foxes etc.) are the most common. In days gone by, hay-ricks would also be thatched, and topped with a straw decoration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5343">'''Dennard scaling''', also known as '''MOSFET scaling''', is a [[scaling law]] based on a 1974 paper co-authored by [[Robert H. Dennard]], after whom it is named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Robert H.|last = Dennard|last2= Gaensslen|first2 = Fritz|last3 = Yu|first3 = Hwa-Nien|last4 = Rideout|first4 = Leo|last5 = Bassous|first5=  Ernest|last6 = LeBlanc|first6 = Andre|title = Design of ion-implanted MOSFET's with very small physical dimensions|date = October 1974|journal = IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits|volume = SC-9|number = 5|url=http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/courses/ECE225/225_W07Banerjee/reference/Dennard.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally formulated for [[MOSFET]]s, it states, roughly, that as transistors get smaller their [[power density]] stays constant, so that the power use stays in proportion with area: both [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]] scale (downward) with length.&lt;ref name=cartesian&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartesianproduct.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-end-of-dennard-scaling/|title = The end of Dennard scaling|date = April 15, 2013|last = McMenamin|first = Adrian|accessdate = January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation with Moore's law and computing performance==

Dennard scaling relates to [[Moore's law]] (which postulates a reduction in the size of transistors leading to more and more transistors per chip at the cost-effective optimum) and claims that the [[performance per watt]] of computing is growing exponentially at roughly the same rate. This is closely related to [[Koomey's law]], which says that performance per watt in computing has been doubling every 1.57 years (somewhat faster than the doubling period of Moore's law, which is about 2 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/425398/a-new-and-improved-moores-law/|title = A New and Improved Moore's Law: Under "Koomey’s law," it’s efficiency, not power, that doubles every year and a half.|publisher = ''[[Technology Review]]''|date = September 12, 2011|accessdate = January 23, 2014|last = Greene|first = Katie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breakdown of Dennard scaling around 2006==

{{further|MOSFET#Scaling}}

The dynamic (switching) power consumption of CMOS circuits is proportional to frequency.&lt;ref name=cmospower&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/lit/an/scaa035b/scaa035b.pdf|title = CMOS Power Consumption and CPD Calculation|publisher = [[Texas Instruments]]|date=June 1997|accessdate = March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Historically, the transistor power reduction afforded by Dennard scaling allowed manufacturers to drastically raise clock frequencies from one generation to the next without significantly increasing overall circuit power consumption.

Since around 2005–2007 Dennard scaling appears to have broken down. As of 2016, transistor counts in integrated circuits are still growing, but the resulting improvements in performance are more gradual than the speed-ups resulting from significant frequency increases.&lt;ref name=cartesian/&gt;&lt;ref name=retrospective&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~agrawvd/COURSE/READING/LOWP/Boh07.pdf|title = A 30 Year Retrospective on Dennard's MOSFET Scaling Paper|publisher = Solid-State Circuits Society|last = Bohr|first = Mark|date = January 2007|accessdate = January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary reason cited for the breakdown is that at small sizes, current leakage poses greater challenges, and also causes the chip to heat up, which creates a threat of [[thermal runaway]] and therefore further increases energy costs.&lt;ref name=cartesian/&gt;&lt;ref name=retrospective/&gt;

The breakdown of Dennard scaling and resulting inability to increase clock frequencies significantly has caused most CPU manufacturers to focus on multicore processors as an alternative way to improve performance. An increased core count benefits many (though by no means all) workloads, but the increase in active switching elements from having multiple cores still results in increased overall power consumption and thus worsens [[CPU power dissipation]] issues.&lt;ref name=Dark-2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hadi/doc/paper/2012-toppicks-dark_silicon.pdf|title = Dark Silicon and the end of multicore scaling |year=2012 |last = Esmaeilzedah|first = Hadi |last2 = Blem|first2 = Emily |last3 = St. Amant|first3 = Renee |last4 = Sankaralingam|first4 = Kartikeyan |last5 = Burger|first5 = Doug }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/116561-the-death-of-cpu-scaling-from-one-core-to-many-and-why-were-still-stuck|title = The death of CPU scaling: From one core to many — and why we’re still stuck|last = Hruska|first = Joel|date = February 1, 2012|accessdate = January 23, 2014|publisher = [[ExtremeTech]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end result is that only some fraction of an integrated circuit can actually be active at any given point in time without violating power constraints. The remaining (inactive) area is referred to as [[dark silicon]].

'''''Eating Raoul''''' is a 1982 [[black comedy]] film about a married couple living in [[Hollywood]] who resort to killing [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers]] for their money. It was directed by [[Paul Bartel]] and written by Bartel and Richard Blackburn. The writers also commissioned a single-issue [[comic book]] based on the film for promotion; it was created by [[underground comix]] creator [[Kim Deitch]].

==Plot==
Paul Bland is a wine dealer and his wife, Mary is a nurse. The couple bemoan their low status in unsatisfying jobs, and dream of opening a restaurant. An exceptionally prudish couple, they sleep in separate beds and disapprove of sex, except for "a little hugging and kissing". After Paul is fired from his job at a wine shop, the couple are left with barely enough money to get by, and despair that they will ever realize their dream. Their plight is exacerbated by the fact that they live in an apartment building that is a regular site of [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinger]] parties, which they despise.

When a drunk swinger wanders into their apartment and tries to rape Mary, Paul hits him on the head with a heavy frying pan, unintentionally killing him. They take his money and put him in the trash incinerator. Later, they kill another swinger in a similar fashion, and realize that they could make money by killing "rich perverts". They get advice on infiltrating the swinger community from one of the building's orgy regulars, Doris the [[Dominatrix]]. Mary lures men by promising to satisfy their sexual fetishes, and when they try to have sex with her, the otherwise timid Paul becomes alarmed enough to kill them with the frying pan. The Blands are surprisingly successful at their scheme.

After finding a flyer for cheap lock-installation service on their car, they decide, for the safety of Paul's wine collection, to have a new lock installed on their apartment. The locksmith is Raoul Mendoza, who uses the service as a scam enabling him to rob the homes of his customers. Using his own key, he sneaks into the Blands' apartment the following night, and stumbles across the corpse of the Blands' latest victim, a [[Nazi chic|Nazi fetishist]]. Paul catches Raoul, and with each in a compromising position, they strike a deal: Raoul will keep the Blands' secret and dispose of the bodies, which he says he can "exchange" for cash.  

One night, Mary's client doesn't show up, so Paul leaves to buy groceries (and a new frying pan, since Mary is "a bit squeamish about cooking with the one we use to kill people"), leaving her alone. However the client arrives late, refuses to accept Mary's protest that he missed his appointment, and tries to rape her. Raoul happens to arrive, and strangles the client with his belt. Raoul then offers Mary marijuana and they have sex.  Suspicious of Raoul, Paul discovers that he has been selling the bodies to a dog food company, and – unbeknownst to Paul and Mary – selling the victims' expensive cars and keeping the money. 

Raoul and Mary sleep together again, and Raoul tries to persuade Mary to run away with him. He tries to run Paul over with a car, who responds by hiring Doris the Dominatrix to use her costuming and role-playing experience help get rid of him. She poses as an immigration agent threatening Raoul with deportation, and a public health worker who gives him pills that are secretly [[Niter|saltpeter]], to render him sexually impotent. These schemes don't work.

Paul and Mary are in danger of losing the property they wish to buy for the restaurant to another buyer. They need to increase the scale of the operation and attend a swinger party in search of victims. Paul loses his temper and throws a bug zapper into the hot tub, killing all of the party-goers at once, enabling Paul and Mary to take all the money and sell the party-goers' cars. 

A drunken Raoul breaks into the Blands' apartment and threatens to kill Paul for not sharing the money from the sale of the cars, and because he wants Mary for himself. He informs Paul that he and Mary will be getting married, and tells Mary to bring a frying pan so that they can kill him together. Instead, Mary lures Raoul into the kitchen and kills him. Mary and Paul suddenly remember that their real estate agent (who is helping them buy their dream restaurant) is due to arrive soon for dinner. With no meat in the house, and little time before his arrival, they cook Raoul and serve him for dinner, describing the dish as "Spanish". The last shot of the film is a smiling Paul and Mary in front of their new restaurant, with the caption, "Bon Appétit".

Woronov and Beltran appeared together again in ''[[Night of the Comet]]'' (1984), though not as their ''Eating Raoul'' characters; the two also starred together in Bartel's critically acclaimed follow-up feature ''[[Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills]]'' in 1989.

===Musical===
''[[Eating Raoul (musical)|Eating Raoul]]'', a stage [[Musical theatre|musical]] adaptation, was presented [[Off-Broadway]] in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lortel.org/LLA_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&amp;title=Eating%20Raoul Eating Raoul at the Internet Off-Broadway Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521023010/http://www.lortel.org/LLA_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&amp;title=Eating%20Raoul |date=2015-05-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and also played at the Bridewell Theatre, London, in 2000.

===Planned sequel===
A [[sequel]], entitled ''Bland Ambition'', was planned. The script was written by Paul Bartel and Richard Blackburn. As described by Bartel:

{{Quote|[The film] starts with Paul and Mary Bland happily ensconced in their Country Kitchen, where they're doing a land-office business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/land-office-business "A thriving, extensive, or rapidly moving volume of trade."]&lt;/ref&gt; The arrogant young Governor of California stops off to have lunch and is furious he is not recognized and permitted to jump the line. In retaliation, he sends a health inspector to close down the Country Kitchen, and Paul and Mary are encouraged by the media to retaliate in kind and run against him for Governor of California.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1DF173DF937A25754C0A96F948260&amp;pagewanted=all | title= At the Movies | author=Lawrence Van Gelder | work=New York Times | date=1989-07-14 | accessdate=February 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Bland Ambition'' was about 10 days from the start of filming when [[Vestron Video|Vestron]] withdrew its financial backing.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4899">{{Anthropology}}

'''Ethnomuseology''' is the study of [[museum]]s and museum curation in the context of the culture and cultural traditions of its collections. It is an interdisciplinary field combining [[museum studies]], [[anthropology]], [[ethnography]], and often various [[fine arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Bucur August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
As stated by Moira Simpson, "Ethnomuseology is the field of scholarship concerning culturally appropriate museum curation and conservation of ethnographic materials using methods that reflect social, cultural, spiritual, or religious aspects of objects."{{fact|date=November 2015}} A museum subscribing the principles of ethnomuseology will often maintain and present artifacts and collections in the traditional manner of their ethnological origins, combining the museum with the rituals and community of its theme.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson 2007, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; This can be in addition to conventional Western museum practices, which often focuses on object materiality. As well, ethnomuseology often involves a continued dialog between museum administrators and members of represented cultures in collections. The ''Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology'' considers ethnomuseology to be a "more holistic" approach to [[heritage interpretation]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson 2014, pp. 2549-2551&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "ethnomuseology" is first seen in Romania and Czechoslovakia in the 1980s, where it described the use of artifacts from rural life to "[provide] evidence of authentic forms of culture". A variant, "etnomuseologia", was used in 1994 by the Romanian anthropologist Bert G. Ribeiro to describe the work of the [[Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi]] in [[Belem, Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson 2014, p. 2550&lt;/ref&gt; In Belem, curators had been working directly with Amazonian Indians in a continued dialog to create exhibits informed by the very culture they documented.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, a number of museums are considered to be followers the ethnomuseological method, including the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[Alutiiq Museum]] in [[Kodiak, Alaska]], and the Department of Ethnology at the [[Museum of Macedonia]] in [[Skopje, Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson 2014, p. 2551&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Namicev 1994, pp. 179-184&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, [[Masaryk University]] in [[Brno, Czech Republic]] has offered a course in ethnomuseology titled "MUII165 Practice in museology and ethnography".&lt;ref&gt;"MUII165 Practice in museology and ethnography"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fijidailypost.png|frame|''Fiji's Daily Post'' - logo]]
The '''''Fiji's Daily Post''''' ('''''FDP''''') was a [[newspaper]] in [[Fiji]] that was founded in October 1987 by [[Wame Waqanisanini, Jr]], who owned 50 percent of the shares. [[Taniela Bolea]] was the original publisher. The majority shares were later owned by the Fijian government. The newspaper suspended publication and has remain closed since 2010.

The ''FDP'' suffered criticism from its commencement in 1989 to its closure in 2010 that it represented an extreme [[Fijians|ethnic Fijian]]/Itaukei viewpoint in Fiji's national discourse. The evidence for this conclusion is inconclusive. No other newspaper in Fiji has attempted to reach as wide a multicultural cross-section of the people as the FDP through the provision of five separate language publications. The staff of the newspaper was always multi-ethnic in complexion, representative of a wide range of religious and political viewpoints, and of both genders. As far as ideological orientation of the editorial staff is concerned, it is fair to suppose that once the Fiji government took an official role as major share-holder in the newspaper (late 1990s), the ''FDP'' was obliged to toe the government line, but again, this is an oversimplification of the facts. Content analysis of the ''FDP'' in comparison with Fiji's other major dailies, the ''Fiji Times'' and ''Fiji Sun'' does not bear this out.

==History==
The first ''Daily Post'' (Volume 1, No. 1) appeared as a 24-page tabloid with a red masthead, Saturday, 23 September 1989.  The cover story, headlined ‘Fiji Now Drugs Transit Point’, was by [[Karalaini Naciqa]].  That first edition contained court reports, special reports, an editorial, a feature on the Consumer Council, a children’s page, a page of international news, and a back page devoted to sport.

The second edition of the ''FDP'' appeared Monday (25 September 1989, Volume 1, No.2) and carried the newspaper’s first ‘Letters to the Editor’.  The newspaper listed Kameli Rakoko as ‘Sports Editor’ and Robert Wendt (now deceased) was named as ‘Chief Sub-Editor’. In its first year, the newspaper served as an incubator for new journalists as well as a refuge for disaffected others. Stories and articles appeared by Mark Langan (former managing editor of the ''[[Samoa Daily News]]''), Percy Kean, Filimoni Verebalavu, Kini Nalatu, Hari Gounder, and [[Kamal Iyer]].

In 1990 the ''FDP'' management was listed as Publisher, Taniela Bolea; Editor, Isimeli Koroi; Western Manager, Hari Gaunder; Accountant, Ashok Kumar; Advertising Manager, Simione Celua; Circulation Manager, John Singh; and Production Manager, Mohammad Ali.

Four years into its operation, the ''FDP'' was, at the end of 1993, publishing editions of 40 to 68 pages varying according to daily demand and advertising.  The publisher was still Taniela Bolea, but the Editor was Nemani Delaibatiki (replacing Isimeli Koroi).  Ravin Lal had taken over as Advertising Manager (from Simione Celua), the Production manager was Aisea Itautoka (replacing Mohammed Ali), and Circulation was in the hands of Vishwa Nand (in place of John Singh).

By 1994, Distribution was under Timoci Rabo; Systems Manager was John Mansell; and the Suva office under Elenoa Lagataki.  `Sidetracks’ with the late (and great) Robert Keith-Reid was a popular column at that time. Cartoons were occasional with ‘Mafi’s World’ the feature.

By 1997 Laisa Taga was Managing Editor (replacing Floyd Takeuchi and Nemani Delaibatiki), Greg Pooran had become Acting Advertising Manager and a new position of Marketing Manager was held by Andrew Joseph.  Another new position of Financial Controller was held by Anura Bandara.

In 1999, [[James Ah Koy]], Finance Minister at the time, persuaded the [[Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei]] (SVT) government to purchase a majority holding in the newspaper to assist government in public dissemination and explanation of its legislation and policies.

Despite government support, by 2000, the ''FDP'' was losing ground to the newly founded ''[[Fiji Sun]]''.  A new management group was thereby brought in to run the ailing newspaper.  In 2005 the measures undertaken by that management group became the subject of Court action and criminal investigation brought on by the ''FDP''{{'}}s new Australian owner-publisher, Alan Hickling. Hickling had successfully bought a portion of both government and small share-holders' shares to acquire the newspaper.

The government retained its reduced percentage of the ''FDP'' shares, while Alan Hickling increased his percentage shares giving him the controlling interest.

During its time, the ''FDP'' was located at several addresses. It began as an office in Three Miles, [[Nabua]] (corner of Fletcher Road and Ratu Mara Road), before moving to Valelevu, [[Nasinu]]. The administration, editorial and advertising departments then split off and moved to Toorak (Toorak Road), [[Suva]], leaving the press and production at Valelevu. The admin-ed-adv departments then moved downtown to Greig Street, Suva, before moving finally to Ackland Street, Vatuwaqa.

The ''FDP'' has also been responsible for publishing several ethnic newspapers each with its own editorial staff under the supervision and control of the English-language newspaper. The ethnic Fijian (now known as 'itaukei') language newspaper called ''Volasiga'' began under Samisoni Bolatacigi almost simultaneously with the inception of the ''FDP''. In the mid-1990s, an ethnic Rotuman-language newspaper, ''No'ia Rotuma'', commenced under the editorial direction of Aisea Eiali. At this time, an ethnic Indian Hindi-language newspaper ''Ramnik Joyati'' also commenced under the ''FDP'' flagship. In the early 2000s, two ethnic Chinese-language newspapers were also published by the FDP. These were the ''Chinese Mail'' and the ''Chinese Post'' - each taking a different perspective of China's role in the world.

== 2006 coup d'état ==
{{Main|2006 Fijian coup d'état}}

On Saturday, 2 December 2006 the ''FDP'' published what was alleged to be the military's timetable for taking control of the Qarase-led SDL government. The newspaper also reported that day that the incumbent Prime Minister, [[Laisenia Qarase]], would be removed from power on 4 December (2006). Both reports were wrong, but warnings and intimidation from unknown persons led to concerns about the safety of staff and the ''FDP'' premises were evacuated at 3.30 pm, on 4 December and remained closed for a period of 24 hours. A further threat prevented the ''FDP'' from publishing on 5 December 2006, but it was the only newspaper to publish on the day after the coup (6 December).

On 8 December 2006, ''FDP'' General Manager, [[Mesake Koroi]], was detained and questioned by soldiers at Suva's [[Queen Elizabeth Barracks, Suva|Queen Elizabeth Barracks]]. Two days later, Koroi left for his village of [[Mavana]] on the [[Lau Islands|Lau]] island of [[Vanua Balavu]] where he remained for three months. The newspaper continued to publish under Editor-in-Chief, Dr [[Robert Wolfgramm]], News Editor, Mithleshni Gurdayal, and Legal Officer, Api Mataitoga.

On 14 December 2006, Wolfgramm and Mataitoga were also taken to the military camp and detained for questioning whereupon Wolfgramm had his passport confiscated and was informed of his deportation to Australia. Wolfgramm's deportation was not followed through and his passport was returned to him through the Office of the Fiji Human Rights Commission on 5 January 2007. The ''FDP'' had been refusing to accept Military interference in its publications in the wake of the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military coup]] which [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|deposed the Qarase-led SDL government]] on 5 December 2006. In the two years leading up to the coup, numerous editorials were critical of the military leadership's position on the twice-elected government of deposed Prime Minister, Laisenia Qarase.

On 17 October 2008, the ''FDP'' published a letter-to-the-editor that was deemed to be in contempt of court by the Attorney-General. The letter was similar to that which was later published in the ''Fiji Times'' and for which the publishers and editors of both newspapers were charged and legal proceedings begun. The ''FDP'' case has not been resolved.
          
Following the imposition of Fiji Public Emergency Regulations on 10 April 2009, censors were allocated to the newsrooms of all of Fiji's media including the ''FDP''. Protests by various media against this measure initially took the forms of either black ink, blank spaces, or blurb. Eventually, the ''FDP'' negotiated a working relationship with this difficulty.

In February 2010, suffering the combined effects of falling staff morale, shrinking circulation, censorship demands, and weighty unresolved court cases, the ''FDP'' suspended publication and closed.

James Peterson in ''Dreams of Chaos, Visions of Order'' said, "In practice, the film poem label was primarily an emblem of the avant-garde's difference from the commercial narrative film." Peterson reported that in the 1950s, overviews of avant-garde films "generally identified two genres: the film poem and the graphic cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peterson|1994|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, the avant-garde cinema encompassed the term "film-poem" in addition to different strains of filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peterson|1994|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film-poems are considered "personal films" and are seen "as autonomous, standing apart from traditions and genres". They are "an open, unpredictable experience" due to eschewing extrinsic expectations based on commercial films. Peterson said, "The viewer's cycles of anticipation and satisfaction derive primarily from the film's intrinsic structure."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peterson|1994|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film-poems are personal as well as private: "Many film poems document intimate moments of the filmmaker's life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peterson|1994|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9567">In most discussions, the '''global citizens movement''' is a socio-political process rather than a political organization or party structure. The term is often used synonymously with the [[anti-globalization movement]]  or the [[global justice movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan George, "Global Citizens Movement: A New Actor for a New Politics," Conference on Reshaping Globalisation: Multilateral Dialogues and New Policy Initiatives, Central European University, Budapest, October 18, 2001, http://www.tni.org/article/global-citizens-movement-new-actor-new-politics.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Global citizens movement" has been used by activists to refer to a number of organized and overlapping citizens groups who seek to influence public policy often with the hope of establishing global solidarity on an issue. Such efforts include advocacy on ecological [[sustainability]], corporate responsibility, social justice, and similar progressive issues.

In theoretical discussions of [[social movements]], global citizens movement refers to a complex and unprecedented phenomena made possible by the unique subjective and objective conditions of the [[planetary phase of civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Orion Kriegman, ''Dawn of the Cosmopolitan: The Hope of a Global Citizens Movement'' (Boston: Tellus Institute, 2006), http://www.tellus.org/pub/Dawn_of_the_Cosmopolitan.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used to distinguish the latent potential for a profound shift in values among an aware and engaged citizenry from existing transnational citizens movements which tend to focus on specific issues (such as the [[anti-war movement]] or the [[labor movement]]).&lt;ref&gt;J. Guidry, M. Kennedy, and M. Zald, eds., ''Globalizations and Social Movements: Culture, Power, and the Transnational Public Sphere'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2003; Daniel Jakopovich, "The Construction of a Trans-European Labour Movement," ''Capital &amp; Class'' 35, no. 1 (February 2011): 63-79, http://cnc.sagepub.com/content/35/1/63.short.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The concept of [[global citizenship]] first emerged among the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Greek Cynics]] in the 4th Century BCE, who coined the term “[[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]]” – meaning ''citizen of the world''. The [[Stoics]] later elaborated on the concept. The contemporary concept of [[cosmopolitanism]], which proposes that all individuals belong to a single moral community, has gained a new salience as scholars examine the ethical requirements of the [[planetary phase of civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, ''Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers'' (New York: W.W. Norton, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that today’s objective and subjective conditions have increased the latency for an emergent global civic identity has been argued by the authors of the [[Global Scenario Group]]’s final report ''Great Transition: the Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Raskin, Tariq Banuri, Gilberto Gallopín, Pablo Gutman, Al Hammond, Robert Kates, and Rob Swart, ''Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead'' (Boston: Stockholm Environment Institute, 2002), http://www.greattransition.org/gt-essay. See also the sequel to ''Great Transition'': Paul Raskin, ''Journey to Earthland: A Great Transition to Planetary Civilization'' (Boston: Tellus Institute, 2016), http://www.greattransition.org/publication/journey-to-earthland.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar arguments for the existence of a latent pool of tens of millions of people ready to identify around new values of earth consciousness have been put forth by such authors as [[Paul Raskin]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Raskin, ''World Lines: Pathways, Pivots, and the Global Futures'' (Boston: Tellus Institute, 2006), http://www.tellus.org/pub/World%20lines-A%20framework%20for%20exploring%20global%20pathways.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul H. Ray]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ray and Sherry Anderson, ''The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People are Changing the World'' (New York: Three Rivers Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Korten]].&lt;ref&gt;David Korten, ''The Great Turning: From Empire to Earth Community'' (San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizations, such as [[Oxfam International]] believe that a global citizens movement rooted in social and economic justice is emerging and is necessary for ending global poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Oxfam International, ''Towards Global Equity: Oxfam International's Strategic Plan, 2001 – 2006'' (Oxford, UK: Oxfam International, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
In the last chapter of his book ''Red Sky at Morning'', [[James Gustave Speth|Gus Speth]] describes the potential for a new type of social movement composed of "we the people, as citizens" rooted in the principles of the [[Earth Charter]] to lead the transition in consciousness and values necessary for the emergence of a new planetary civilization.&lt;ref&gt;James Gustave Speth, ''Red Sky at Morning: America and the Crisis of the Global Environment. A Citizen's Agenda for Action'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Orion Kriegman, author of [http://www.tellus.org/pub/Dawn_of_the_Cosmopolitan.pdf ''Dawn of the Cosmopolitan: The Hope of a Global Citizens Movement''], states, “Transnational corporations, governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) remain powerful global actors, but all of these would be deeply influenced by a coherent, worldwide association of millions of people who call for priority to be placed on new values of quality of life, human solidarity, and environmental sustainability.”&lt;ref&gt;Kriegman, ''Dawn of the Cosmpolitan.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Kriegman distinguishes this "coherent, worldwide association of millions" from the existing fragmented social movements active in the [[World Social Forum]]. These movements tend to be issue-specific – focused on labor, environment, human rights, feminist issues, indigenous struggles, poverty, AIDS, and numerous other interrelated but "siloed" efforts. Coherence among these movements would require a reframing of their work under the rubric of the struggle for a socially just and ecologically sustainable global society and the establishment of an institutional structure to defend the rights of humanity, future generations, and the biosphere.

==Critiques==
The major critique of the notion of a global citizens movement centers on the potential for the emergence of solidarity on issues at the global level. Nationalism, racism, and the dominance of the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian state system]] are considered antithetical to the adoption of a global civic identity. However, some scholars point out that the historical emergence of nationalism must have felt just as improbable in a time of warring city-states,&lt;ref&gt;Benedict Anderson, ''Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism'' (New York: Verso, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; and yet in retrospect it appears inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Chella Rajan, ''Global Politics and Institutions'' (Boston: Tellus Institute, 2006), http://www.tellus.org/tellus/publication/global-politics-and-institutions-a-utopistic-view.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more radical critique stems from the arguments put forth by [[Michael Hardt]] and [[Antonio Negri]] in their book ''[[Multitude]]'' and enshrines [[Michel Foucault]]'s notion of a “plurality of resistance”&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, ''The History of Sexuality'' (New York: Vintage Books, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; as the only legitimate path forward. This argument asserts that an organized movement among the vast multitude is both undesirable and impossible. Instead of leadership and organizational structures, Hardt and Negri put faith in the emergence of spontaneous coherence due to increasing self-organized networks among various autonomous resistance movements. They critique the notion that there could be legitimate leaders, democratically chosen through a formal network of grassroots structures, acting on behalf of a big-tent pluralistic association of global citizens to directly confront the entrenched power of transnational corporations and state governments. However, it remains unclear how a network of autonomous movements would differ in practice from the vision of an authentic global citizens movement.

'''Gutian''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|uː|t|i|ən}}; also '''Qutian''') is an extinct [[unclassified language]] that was spoken by the [[Gutian people]], who briefly ruled over [[Sumer]] as the [[Gutian dynasty of Sumer|Gutian dynasty]] in the 22nd century BCE ([[middle chronology]]). The Gutians lived in the territory between the [[Zagros Mountains]] and the [[Tigris]]. Nothing is known about the language except its existence and a list of names of Gutian rulers in the [[Sumerian King List]].

[[Thorkild Jacobsen]] suggested that the recurring ending ''-(e)š'' may have had a grammatical function in Gutian, perhaps as a [[grammatical case|case]] marker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In a posthumously-published article, [[W. B.

The title '''Hero of the Soviet Union''' ({{lang-ru|Герой Советского Союза|translit=Geroy Sovietskogo Soyuza}}) was the highest distinction in the [[Soviet Union]], awarded personally or collectively for heroic feats in service to the Soviet state and society.&lt;ref name=GSEncy&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Prokhorov  | first = Aleksandr Mikhaĭlovich | authorlink = Aleksandr Mikhailovich Prokhorov | title = Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Volume 6 | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1982 | location = New York  | pages = 594 | url =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn =  | oclc = 810278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The award was established on April 16, 1934, by the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="sovietresolution"&gt;{{cite web  | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Resolution of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union of May 5, 1934 | publisher = Wikisource | date= 2010-09-04 |url =  http://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%A6%D0%98%D0%9A_%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0_%D0%BE%D1%82_16.05.1934_%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0 | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first recipients of the title originally received only the [[Order of Lenin]], the highest Soviet award, along with a certificate (грамота, ''gramota'') describing the heroic deed from the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the USSR. Because the Order of Lenin could be awarded for deeds not qualifying for the title of hero, and to distinguish heroes from other Order of Lenin holders, the [[Gold Star medal]] was introduced on August 1, 1939.&lt;ref name="sovietdecree1939"&gt;{{cite web  | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of August 1, 1939 | publisher = Wikisource | date= 2011-09-28 |url =  http://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%A3%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7_%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B0_%D0%92%D0%A1_%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0_%D0%BE%D1%82_1.08.1939_%D0%BE_%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85_%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%85_%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F_%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B2_%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%8E%D0%B7%D0%B0 | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier heroes were retroactively eligible for these items.

A hero could be awarded the title again for a subsequent heroic feat with an additional Gold Star medal and certificate. An additional Order of Lenin was not given until 1973. The practice of awarding the title multiple times was abolished by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] in 1988 during [[perestroika]].

Forty-four foreign citizens were awarded the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Статистика :: Герои страны|url = http://www.warheroes.ru/stats.asp|website = www.warheroes.ru|access-date = 2016-01-25|language = Russian|trans-title = Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title was also given posthumously, though often without the actual Gold Star medal given.

The title could be revoked only by the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]].&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel and Schmitt, ''The Comprehensive Guide to Soviet Orders and Medals''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privileges===
Individuals who received the award were entitled to special privileges. These include:

* A pension with survivor benefits in the event of the death of the title holder.
* First priority on the [[Communal apartment|housing list]] with 50% rent reduction, tax exempt and an additional {{convert|15|m2}} in living space.
* Annual round-trip first class airline ticket
* Free bus transportation
* Free annual visit to [[Sanatorium|sanitarium]] or rest home

==History==
[[File:Zhukov 1945 E010750410-v8.jpg|thumb|Marshal Georgy Zhukov (center) wearing three Hero of the Soviet Union medals and Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky (right) wearing two]]
In total, during the existence of the USSR, the title of Hero of the Soviet Union was awarded to 12,777 people (without taking into account 72 ruled titles for defamatory acts and 13 canceled Decrees as unreasonable), including twice – 154 (9 posthumously), three times – 3 and four – 2. Ninety-five women were awarded the title. Among the Heroes of the Soviet Union, 44 people are citizens of foreign states. The great majority of them received it during [[World War II]] (11,635 Heroes of the Soviet Union, 101 twice Heroes, three thrice Heroes, and two four-time Heroes). Eighty-five people (28 of them were awarded this high rank posthumously) were awarded the title for actions related to the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet-Afghan War]], which lasted from 1979 until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.winthrop.edu/haynese/medals/afghan/af_hsu.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213212801/http://faculty.winthrop.edu/haynese/medals/afghan/af_hsu.html |archivedate=2008-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recipients of the award were the pilots [[Anatoly Vasilyevich Liapidevsky|Anatoly Liapidevsky]] (certificate number one), [[Sigizmund Levanevsky]], [[Vasily Molokov]], [[Mavriky Slepnyov]], [[Nikolai Kamanin]], [[Ivan Doronin]], and [[Mikhail Vasilyevich Vodopianov|Mikhail Vodopianov]], who participated in the successful aerial search and rescue of the crew of the steamship ''[[Cheliuskin (ship)|Cheliuskin]]'', which sank in [[Arctic]] waters, crushed by ice fields, on February 13, 1934. [[Valentina Grizodubova]], a female pilot, was the first woman to become a Hero of the Soviet Union (November 2, 1938)&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=651 Гризодубова Валентина Степановна]&lt;/ref&gt; for her international women's record for a straight-line distance flight. [[Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya]], a [[Soviet partisan]], was the first woman to become a Hero of the Soviet Union during World War II (February 16, 1942), posthumously.

In addition, 101 people received the award twice. A second Hero title, either Hero of the Soviet Union or [[Hero of Socialist Labour]] entitled the recipient to have a bronze bust of his or her likeness with a commemorative inscription erected in his or her hometown.&lt;ref&gt;https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%A6%D0%98%D0%9A_%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0_%D0%BE%D1%82_16.05.1934_%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0&lt;/ref&gt;

Two famous Soviet fighter pilots, [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Pokryshkin|Aleksandr Pokryshkin]] and [[Ivan Nikitovich Kozhedub|Ivan Kozhedub]] were three times Heroes of the Soviet Union. A third award entitled the recipient to have his/her bronze bust erected on a columnar pedestal in Moscow, near the [[Palace of the Soviets]], but the Palace was never built.

After his release from serving a 20-year sentence in a Mexican prison for the assassination of [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Ramon Mercader]] moved to the Soviet Union in 1961 and was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal from KGB head [[Alexander Shelepin]].

The only individuals to receive the title four times were Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. The original statute of the Hero of the Soviet Union, however, did not provide for a fourth title; its provisions allowed for a maximum of three awards regardless of later deeds. Both Zhukov and Brezhnev received their fourth titles under controversial circumstances contrary to the statute, which remained largely unchanged until the award was abolished in 1991. Zhukov was awarded a fourth time "for his large accomplishments" on the occasion of his 60th birthday on December 1, 1956. There is some speculation that Zhukov's fourth Hero medal was for his participation in the arrest of [[Lavrentiy Beria|Beria]] in 1953, but this was not entered in the records. Brezhnev's four awards further eroded the prestige of the award because they were all birthday gifts, on the occasions of his 60th, 70th, 72nd and 75th birthdays. Such practices halted in 1988 due to a decision of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, which formally ended it.

By the 1970s, the award had been somewhat devalued. Important political and military persons had been awarded it on the occasions of their anniversaries rather than for any immediate heroic activity.

All Soviet [[cosmonaut]]s, starting from [[Yuri Gagarin]], as well as foreign citizens who participated in the Soviet space program as cosmonauts, received Hero award for each flight (but no more than twice).

Apart from individuals, the title was also awarded to twelve cities ([[Hero City]]) as well as the fortress of [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] ([[Hero-Fortress]]) for collective heroism during the War.

The last recipient of the title "Hero of the Soviet Union" was a Soviet [[underwater diving|diver]], [[Corvette Captain|Captain of the 3rd rank]] [[Leonid Solodkov|Leonid Mikhailovich Solodkov]] on December 24, 1991 for his leadership and participation in a series of unprecedented extreme depth diving experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aarticles.net/biographies/1306-kak-leonid-solodkov-stal-poslednim-geroem-sovetskogo-soyuza.html|title= As Leonid Solodkov was the last hero of the Soviet Union?|publisher=|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, this title was succeeded in Russia by the title "[[Hero of the Russian Federation]]", in Ukraine by "[[Hero of Ukraine]]" and in Belarus by "[[Hero of Belarus]]". Azerbaijan's successor order is that of [[National Hero of Azerbaijan]] and Armenia's own hero medal is that of [[National Hero of Armenia]], both modeled on the Soviet one.

'''''History's Mysteries''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[documentary television series]] that aired on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]].

==Overview==

The 154 [[episode]]s of the series were produced from 1998-2006{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. Each season consisted of 12 to 14 one-hour episodes that focused on [[historical]] events or subjects considered to be mysterious by the general public. Episodes typically begin with Kent giving a broad overview of the subject followed by what is accepted as a common explanation. During the main segments, experts on both sides of the issue present their evidence and opinions. Before commercial breaks, Kent would give the audience bits of trivia relating to the subject; episodes also included a timeline which would give important events occurring around the time of the events discussed in the show.

Subjects covered on the show ranged from the beginning of [[human history]] to modern subjects such as [[Ilich Ramírez Sánchez|Carlos the Jackal]], [[The Amityville Horror]], and [[Area 51]], as well as [[conspiracy (political)|political conspiracies]] and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] such as [[MK ULTRA]] and the [[JFK Assassination]]. Common aspects of history covered on the show include [[religion]], [[crime]], the [[supernatural]], [[archaeology]], [[mythology]], and [[folklore]].

Some episodes of the show were repackaged as part of a series called ''Incredible But True?'', which aired episodes of ''History's Mysteries'' as well as other shows (including ''In Search of History'' and ''UFO Files'', also narrated by Ackroyd). The show's last episodes were an anthology of clips from previous episodes (such as ''Mysteries of the High Seas'').

Although new episodes are no longer being produced, re-runs of ''History's Mysteries'' are regularly shown on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]. Additionally, they are available on [[DVD]].

'''{{Transl|ko|Hoesik}}''' ({{lang-ko|회식}}, [[Hanja]]: {{lang|ko-Hant|會食}}, {{literal translation|eating together}}) is a popular type of gathering in the society of [[South Korea]], and refers to a group of people getting together to eat and drink. In Korean society, Hoesik has been established as a subculture of an organization or enterprise.

== Origin ==
The origin of the Hoesik was based on the word "Hoe-min" of the [[Joseon]] Dynasty.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=In|first=Mihee|date=Winter 2018|title=직장인의 파티중심 회식문화의 발전 방안 연구|trans-title=A Study on the Development of Party-Focused Gathering Culture for Workers.|url=http://www.riss.kr/search/detail/DetailView.do?p_mat_type=be54d9b8bc7cdb09&amp;control_no=053efce261ecf04fffe0bdc3ef48d419|journal=Master Thesis|volume=|pages=8–18|via=Sungshin Women's University Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the word "Hoe-min" was used in order to make the kings and officials of Joseon become 'Let's be one'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It seems that the most likely theory has changed from the word "Hoe-min" to "Hoesik".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this way, Hoesik is not a place for the individual, as it can be interpreted as an interpretation that the king and his subjects should live together and eat together.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==

=== 1980s~1990s ===
Under the influence of Korean traditional military cultures, those lower than the superior must drink. Binge drinking was mainly encouraged by the 'bomb shot' or 'poktanju,' including beer+spirits and soju+spirits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the 1990s, however, the campaign for sound drinking started, and the culture to avoid social gatherings spread due to the IMF economic crisis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 2000s~the present ===
Companies and organizations are trying to improve their Hoesik culture as a reaction to the prevailing social atmosphere surrounding the issues of '[[Bomb shot|bombshot]]', drinking glasses, and sexual harassment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Instead of focusing on just drinking and dancing, other forms of entertainment and cultural gatherings, such as watching movies and bowling are becoming increasingly common.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Changes in Hoesik with the enactment of the new law ===
[[Kim Young-ran Act]]([[Korean language|Korean]]: 김영란법), also known as the anti-graft law, refers to the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://biz.khan.co.kr/khan_art_view.html?artid=201610271111011&amp;code=920301|title=Changes in Hwoesik after the Kim Young-ran Act was enforced|last=Sun|first=MyeongSu|date=2016-10-27|work=Khanbiz|access-date=2018-06-09|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this law was enacted , various Hoesik practices and after work entertainment culture have significantly decreased, while the percent of individual leisure activities has increased.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

=== Changes in Hoesik with Me too movement ===
In 2017, the [[Me Too (disambiguation)]] movement was widespread in Korea.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hankookilbo.com/v/5d9f3412ead04b11820d0c4cd7f6944c|title=The hoesik culture changed by the Me too movement.|last=Hyeongjune|first=Kim|date=2018-03-13|work=hankookilbo|access-date=2018-06-14|language=korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the Me too Movement is changing the Hoesik inside Korean companies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The senior employees that were leading the Hoesik had fewer Hoesik as they left early.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some companies and public organizations are trying to reduce or eliminate events that their subordinates are uncomfortable with due to the Me too Movement movement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In other words, the heosik that were forced on subordinates is decreasing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Function ==

=== Positive function ===
Hwoesik is a place where members of an organization can relax their tension and stress, increase their closeness to each other, and resolve conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=200901021748555&amp;code=990333|title=[Living in Korea] Benefits of community culture - Hwoesik|last=Tim|first=Alper|date=2009-01-02|work=Hankyoreh|access-date=2018-06-09|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enhance understanding among team members and help them become closer to each other.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mobiswebzine.com/201706N/relation03.php|title=Sincere communication through Hwoesik|last=|first=|date=|website=www.mobiswebzine.com|language=ko|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; By reducing stress on members and eliminating inter-person and interdepartmental conflicts, it is possible to create harmony among members and increase efficiency of production.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Adverse effect ===

==== Excessive drinking and forced drinking ====
One cannot get away from alcohol at a Hwoesik.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sim|first=Wanseop|date=2017|title=회식문화의 패러다임 변화와 새로운 실천방안을 위한 모델링 수립|trans-title=Change of Paradigm for the Get-together Culture and Modeling for the New Practices: With emphasis on Qualitative Approach Structural Issues and Improvement Directions|url=http://www.riss.kr/search/detail/DetailView.do?p_mat_type=1a0202e37d52c72d&amp;control_no=107fbf4d66f4cb474884a65323211ff0|journal=문화산업연구|volume=17|pages=25–32|via=KCI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy drinking is a cause of embarrassment to people that are unable to drink well.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is because the boss or other office superiors are present and can witness one's drunken behavior.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Because of the difficulty of refusing, people are forced to drink excessively.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The next day's hangover can make them feel very tired and they can not go to work or spend the day in a bad mood.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Forced attendance at hwoesik ====
Many company employees are forced to attend, although their attendance is often passive and uncomfortable. Supervisors may lead the conversation while subordinates follow the conversation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Loss of human relations with late hwoesik ====
Most conversations at a hwoesik may be with colleagues and supervisors and focus on company's shortcomings and company gossip.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Negative talk and gossip can extend outside the hwoesik, leading to a breakdown of relationships and the internal atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

==== Lack of intent ====
Most of them drink only food and drink and refuse to express their inner feelings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Conflicts with law ====
{{Main|Drug-facilitated sexual assault|Alcohol intoxication}}
Intoxication as a cause of a hwoesik can lead to a loss of inhibitions and judgement. Cases of sexual harassment and drunk driving have been associated with hwoesik events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.news.naver.com/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=119&amp;aid=0002243405|title=An Army officer who molested a female soldier at a hwoesik … relieved of his position.|last=Dailian Spot|first=News Team|date=2018-02-28|website=Naver|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.viva100.com/main/view.php?key=20180531010010981|title=Seoul National University (SNU) professor charges of sexual harassment, " Touch the thighs of female students at hwoesik.

== Other Countries ==

=== China ===
Chinese people enjoy dining at restaurants on holidays with family or friends. Such dining culture serves to exchange feelings each other and make conversation in positive ways.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1978249&amp;cid=48195&amp;categoryId=48195|title=Hwoesik culture in China|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-06-09|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the restaurants that Chinese people visit are popular restaurants, which are relatively cheap.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Popularity of the restaurant is the first condition that identifying the restaurant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some special restaurants are less expensive, but they are not included in the category of popular restaurants because the menu is not diverse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Popular restaurants refer to Chinese traditional dishes that are popular and common to the public, such as cold, fried, soup and stock. It is also the most common restaurant on Chinese streets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some popular restaurants will reveal Shanghai cuisine and Guangdong cuisine on their signboards to show which food system they serve.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, an area that does not identify the region's cuisine on the sign serves dishes that are to the taste of the local people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Japan ===
Half of the Japanese drinks alcohol, but the number keeps increasing.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jo|first=Samang|date=2013|title=(The) study about the Differences on wine culture and tea culture between China and Japan|url=http://www.riss.kr/link?id=T13224426|journal=Master Thesis|volume=2|pages=1–20|via=Library of Kongju University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese men enjoy drinking and it is common for a small number of people to drink at a pub without going home directly after work. Japanese say, " &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Silence is gold " as their motto, but when confronted with something that is worrying or worrying, they still drink away their worries.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It's polite to toast together at the beginning and drink whatever you want next.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In Japan, Geonbae means holding glasses and drinking only the amount you want.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In Japan, when a woman drinks well at a dinner party, she gets praised.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Japanese people usually like to drink in the evening to relieve stress after a day's work.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In addition, Japanese people often change places where they drink and do not drink in the same places to feel different tastes at their regular dining parties.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Rainy day ===
Koreans enjoy hwoesik with Makgeolli(raw rice wine) and Jeon on a rainy day.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohmynews.com/nws_web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0001153587|title=On a rainy day, why is Makgeolli ' hungry ' on jeon?|last=Choi|first=Kyeongjoon|date=2009-06-10|website=Ohmynews|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a hypothesis that this is because the sound of the rain is similar to the sound of making the Jeon.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; And there is a hypothesis that on rainy days, your body's blood sugar level drops, helping to increase your blood sugar level.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; On rainy days, sales of flour and Makgeolli(raw rice wine) were also found to have risen sharply in large discount stores.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; A comparison of the rainy and sunny sales of Makgeolli(raw rice wine) and flour in Korean marts shows that sales of flour and MakgeollI rose 36.5 percent and 17.9 percent, respectively.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This shows that Koreans eat a lot of Makgeolli and Jeon on rainy days.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Yellow dust day ===
[[File:Korean_barbeque-Samgyeopsal-09.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Korean_barbeque-Samgyeopsal-09.jpg|thumb|246x246px|samgyeopsal and soju]]
Koreans eat a lot of samgyeopsal in yellow dust.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imaeil.com/sub_news/sub_news_view.php?news_id=13699&amp;yy=2008|title=Yellow dust and samgyeopsal|last=Kim|first=Bongkyeu|date=2008-03-27|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was really popular food to Korean miners. Korean miners ate samgyeopsal after work.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This is because the miners have believed that after working in lots of dust, samgyeopsal washed the dust with their fat.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; And Koreans who enjoy Hwoesik usually drinks soju with samgyeopsal.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Because of its good taste and cheap price. For these reasons, eating with samgyeopsal and soju is popular on yellow dust days.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; However, there is no scientific evidence that samgyeopsal is good for yellow dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ktv.go.kr/content/view?content_id=460912|title=The Misconception and Truth of Samgyeopsal in Yellow dust|last=Lee|first=Hyeri|date=2013-04-22|website=ktv.go.kr|language=ko|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health ==
{{Main|Long-term effects of alcohol consumption}}
They drink at hwoesik in Korea.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hankookilbo.com/v/31a22339fa3045beb2a4d42de04f4616|title=A corporate culture that encourages the binge of " drinking well  and  working well."|last=Lee|first=Seongtak|date=2018-05-30|work=Hankook ilbo|access-date=2018-06-23|language=korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no such thing as a non-drink hwoesik.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Liver ===
Since most people with liver cancer drink alcohol, alcohol accounts for a significant portion of liver cancer.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sisapress.com/journal/article/174192|title=Alcohol, moderate drinking causes liver cancer|last=No|first=Jinseop|date=|work=sisajounal|access-date=2018-06-23|language=korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korea, almost everyone drinks alcohol unlike other countries, but in foreign countries, there is a clear distinction between those who drink and those who do not.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Among American liver cancer cases, alcohol accounted for 30 to 40 percent.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The '''Israel Prize''' ({{lang-he-n|פרס ישראל}}; "''Peras Yisrael''") is an award handed out by the [[State of Israel]] and is generally regarded as the state's highest cultural honor.&lt;ref name="ReichGoldberg2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reich|first1=Bernard|last2=Goldberg|first2=David H.|title=Historical Dictionary of Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S97dDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA278|year=2016|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-7185-2|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is presented annually, on [[Yom Ha'atzmaut|Israeli Independence Day]], in a state ceremony in [[Jerusalem]], in the presence of the [[President of Israel|President]], the [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]], the [[List of Knesset speakers|Speaker]] of the [[Knesset]] (Israel's legislature), and the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] President. The prize was established in 1953 at the initiative of the [[Education Minister of Israel|Minister of Education]] [[Ben-Zion Dinor]],&lt;ref name=marom&gt;{{Cite web

==Awarding the prize==
The prize is awarded in the following four areas, with the precise subfields changing from year to year in a cycle of 4 to 7 years, except for the last area, which is awarded annually:
* the humanities, social sciences, and Jewish studies
* the natural and exact sciences
* culture, arts, communication and sports
* lifetime achievement and exceptional contribution to the nation (since 1972)

The recipients of the prize are Israeli citizens or organizations who have displayed excellence in their field(s), or have contributed strongly to [[Israeli culture]]. The winners are selected by committees of judges, who pass on their recommendations to the Minister of Education. Prize winners are elected by ad-hoc committees, appointed by the minister of education for each category each year. Decisions of the committee must be unanimous. The prize money was NIS 75,000 as of 2008.

==Recipients==
{{main|List of Israel Prize recipients}}

As of 2009, the prize has been awarded 633 times. Prominent winners include individuals such as [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Abba Eban]], [[A. B. Yehoshua]], [[Israel Aumann]], [[Golda Meir]], [[Amos Oz]], [[Ephraim Kishon]], [[Naomi Shemer]], [[David Benvenisti]], [[Leah Goldberg]] (posthumously) and [[Teddy Kollek]], and organizations such as [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[Jewish Agency]], [[Yad Vashem]] and [[Jewish National Fund]]. Though the prize is generally awarded to Israeli citizens only, in exceptional cases it can be awarded to non-Israelis who have held Israeli residency for many years. [[Zubin Mehta]] received a special award of the Israel Prize in 1991. Mehta is originally from India, and is music director of the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]].

==Controversy==
{{POV check|section|date=May 2014}}
The decision to award the prize to specific individuals has sometimes led to impassioned political debate. In 1993, the strong reaction of then Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] against the nomination of [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] led Leibowitz to decline the prize. In 2004, Education and Culture Minister [[Limor Livnat]], twice sent the decision to award the prize to sculptor [[Yigal Tumarkin]] back to the prize committee. Cases in which the decision was brought before the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] included the prizes given to publicist [[Shmuel Shnitzer]],&lt;ref name="Court"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Editorials/Article.aspx?id=218605&amp;R=R6 Leave the prize winners in peace] ''The Jerusalem Post'', May 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; politician [[Shulamit Aloni]], professor [[Zeev Sternhell]]&lt;ref name="Court"/&gt; and [[Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv basketball club]] chairman [[Shimon Mizrahi]].&lt;ref name="Court"/&gt;

In February 2015, Prime Minister [[Benyamin Netanyahu]] vetoed the appointment of two members of the selection panel for the Israel Prize in Literature after they had already started their work, prompting the other three members, including [[Ziva Ben-Porat]], to resign in protest.&lt;ref name=IPa&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.641912 | title = Israel Prize for Literature faces cancellation as judges resign | author = Or Kashti | date = Feb 11, 2015 | newspaper = Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netanyahu explained that the two panel members were politically unsuitable and that "[t]oo often, it seemed that the extreme panel members were bestowing the prizes on their friends".&lt;ref name=IPb&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.642037 | title = Netanyahu: Israel Prize judges include too many anti-Zionist extremists | author = Jonathan Lis | date = Feb 11, 2015 | newspaper = Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the candidates for the prize, Yigal Schwartz of the [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] withdrew his nomination and called on other candidates to do the same, writing that the situation was an "unprecedented scandal", and that the action was a "continuation of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s deliberate policy of undermining Israel’s elites to gain votes from other groups."&lt;ref name=IPb/&gt; Over the next few days, members of the committees for the literary research and film prizes also resigned, leaving only two members from the original 13 of the three committees, and many other candidates for the prizes withdrew their nominations.&lt;ref name=IPc&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.642320 | title = David Grossman withdraws from Israel Prize in protest of Netanyahu's interference | author = Nirit Anderman and Ori Kashti | date = Feb 12, 2015 | newspaper = Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Grossman]] withdrew his candidature with the explanation that "Netanyahu's move is a cynical and destructive ploy that violates the freedom of spirit, thought and creativity of Israel, and I refuse to cooperate with it".&lt;ref name=IPc/&gt;

'''Jonty Hurwitz''' (born 2 September 1969 in Johannesburg) is an artist, [[engineer]] and entrepreneur.  Hurwitz creates scientifically inspired artworks and [[Anamorphosis|anamorphic]] sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/048913-007/tracks#details-description Tracks: Jonty Hurwitz], on [[Arte|ARTE]] 29 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He is recognised for the smallest human form ever created using [[nano technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/14/sculpture-human-sperm_n_6158258.html  |title=Artist Creates Sculptures So Tiny They Can't Be Seen By The Human Eye |publisher=Huffington Post, Leigh Weingus |date= 14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jonty Hurwitz was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, to Selwin, a hotelier and entrepreneur and Marcia Berger, a drama lecturer and teacher. Jonty spent his early life living in small hotels in rural towns in South Africa while his father built up his business.

Jonty studied [[Electrical Engineering]] at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in [[Johannesburg]] from 1989 to 1993. His major was [[Signal Processing]]. He then joined the [[University of Cape Town]] Remote Sensing Group as a full-time researcher under Professor Michael Inggs, publishing a paper on radar pattern recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=365844 |title=Synthetic Range Profile Measurements of Aircraft, COMSIG-93, COMSIG ’93:204 – 209, September 1993. M R Inggs, J.B. Hurwitz, and A. Langman.  |publisher=COMSIG |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his research post, Hurwitz traveled for a long period of time in India studying Yoga and wood carving.

==Career in art==
In a 2015, documentary by CNN International on Hurwitz's artwork,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/03/13/spc-ones-to-watch-sculpture-c.cnn |title=Is this the World's Smallest Sculpture? |publisher=CNN |date= March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC Radio 2]] art critic Estelle Lovatt commented on Hurwitz's work: "If [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] were alive today, he would have been doing what Jonty is doing.  He would have been using algorithms.  No one else works like him today.  His art is the mix between the emotional and the intelligent, and that's what gives it that spark."&lt;ref name="Self2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mathematics of Self|title=Art of Jonty Hurwitz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=leATtAEACAAJ|date=8 January 2018|publisher=Blurb, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-389-03122-9|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurwitz's work focuses on the aesthetics of art in the context of human perception. His early body of sculpture was discovered by Estelle Lovatt during 2011 in an article for ''Art of England Magazine'': "Thinning the divide gap between art and science, Hurwitz is cognisant of the two being holistically co-joined in the same way as we are naturally, comfortably split between our spiritual and operational self".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static1.squarespace.com/static/541afcd4e4b09246971aad4b/t/5421b307e4b0004bfbd4f10e/1411494663328/ARTofEnglandJonty.pdf |title=Art of England, Estelle Lovatt, Feb 2011 publication, p50. |publisher=Art of England |date= Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pocketmags.com/viewmagazine.aspx?catid=1029&amp;category=Art+%26+Photography&amp;subcatid=183&amp;subcategory=Art&amp;title=Art+of+England&amp;titleid=1015&amp;issueid=31285 Art of England Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurwitz began producing sculptures in 2008. In 2009, his first sculpture '[[Yoda]] and the Anamorph' won the People’s Choice Bentliff Prize of the [[Maidstone Museum and Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/winner-of-art-prize-announced-a105202/|title=Winner of Art Prize Announced. |publisher=Kent Online | date= 6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2009 he won the [[Bernard Noble|Noble]] Sculpture Prize&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnsf.org.uk/winners/2009/ |title=Bernard Noble Sculpture Prize. |date= Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was commissioned to install his first large scale work (a nude study of his father called 'Dietro di me')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jontyhurwitz.com/noble-prize ''Dietro di me''] by Jonty Hurwitz&lt;/ref&gt; in the Italian village [[Colletta di Castelbianco]]. In 2010, he was selected as a finalist for the 4th International [[Arte Laguna Prize]] in Venice, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premioartelaguna.it/catalogo/4edizione/catalogo_premio_arte_laguna_2009.pdf |title=Arte Laguna Exhibition Catalogue, p106. |publisher=Arte Laguna Prize |date= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Hurwitz's anamorphic work was described by the art blogger [[Colossal (blog)|Christopher Jobson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2013/01/the-skewed-anamorphic-sculptures-and-engineered-illusions-of-jonty-hurwitz/ |title=The skewed anamorphic sculptures and engineered illusions of Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Christopher Jobson, Colossal |date= 21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a short documentary about Hurwitz's "Generation Pi" philosophy by ''Vera Productions'' it is estimated that the sculpture received 20 million views online in the space of a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTp5Q3-8Ng |title=The Paintbrush of Mathematics |publisher=Vera Productions |date= March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2013 Hurwitz was introduced to the [[Savoy Hotel]] by London art agent Sally Vaughan. Hurwitz was commissioned to be [[Artist in Residence]] at the hotel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlyst.com/articles/londons-savoy-hotel-continues-its-artist-in-residence-tradition |title=London's Savoy Hotel continues its artist in residence tradition |publisher=Artlyst |date= April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produce a sculpture of the hotel’s historically iconic [[Mascot]] ''Kaspar the Cat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/a-homage-to-kaspar-the-friendly-cat-checks-in-at-the-savoys-new-eatery-8600305.html |title=A homage to Kaspar the friendly Cat checks in at the Savoy's new eatery |publisher=The Independent |date= April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurwitz lived for several months in the hotel producing the sculpture.

In the same year, Hurwitz was also nominated for the [[Threadneedle Prize]] and exhibited a collection at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London. By late 2013, in a special edition of Art of England on portraiture, Hurwitz was cited as the #1 portrait artist in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketmags.com/viewmagazine.aspx?catid=1029&amp;category=Art+%26+Photography&amp;subcatid=183&amp;subcategory=Art&amp;title=Art+of+England&amp;titleid=1015&amp;issueid=60975 |title=Six of the Best, Sally Vaughan, Aug 2013. |publisher=Art of England |date= Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 Hurwitz was voted #46 in the top 100 artists of 2013 by the American art site, Empty Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emptykingdom.com/featured/empty-kingdom-top-100-artists-of-2013/ |title=Top 100 artists of 2013, Empty Kingdom. |publisher=Empty Kingdom |date= 31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, Hurwitz's anamorphic work was blogged as "The best of 2013" by the American Art and Culture magazine, [[Juxtapoz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/sculptures-by-jonty-hurwitz |title=Best of 2013: Sculpture by Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Juxtapoz |date= 31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Hurwitz's work was also curated by ''Science Gallery International'' for a touring group show entitled ‘Illusion’ curated by [[Trinity College Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.sciencegallery.com/illusion/ Science Gallery International] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212190314/http://www.international.sciencegallery.com/illusion/ |date=12 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show presents a collection of installation artworks from around the world that affect human perception. The exhibition led to a 2014/2015 tour in the USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/may/30/fleet-science-center-illusion-exhibit/ |title=Real fun at Fleet’s ‘Illusion’ exhibit |publisher=U-T San Diego, Karla Peterson |date= 30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it attracted over 170,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessandleadership.com/marketing/item/48935-science-gallery-dublin-hono |title=Science Gallery Dublin honoured with dedicated 68c stamp |publisher=Business &amp; Leadership Magazine |date=7 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110010448/http://www.businessandleadership.com/marketing/item/48935-science-gallery-dublin-hono |archivedate=10 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show then moved on to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 2015 and Leipzig, Germany in 2016.

In late 2014, he released a series of “nano sculptures” under the title of ″Trust″. This series of works captured the attentions of both the scientific and art community, being cited by among others, [[Nature (journal)|Nature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/images-of-the-month-november-2014-1.16481 |title=Image of the Month: November 2014 |publisher=Nature Journal, Daniel Cressey |date= 5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific American]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/2014/12/20/physics-week-in-review-december-20-2014/ |title=Physics Week in Review |publisher=Scientific American, Jennifer Ouellette  |date= 20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popular Science]] and [[Phys.org]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2014-11-science-art-nanosculpture-marvels.html |title=When science and art produce nanosculpture marvels |publisher=Phys.org, Nancy Owano  |date= 18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Hurwitz was elected a member of the [[Royal British Society of Sculptors]]. In 2016 the [[Royal Photographic Society]] selected a [[Scanning Electron Microscope]] photograph by Hurwitz and Stefan Diller as one of the top 100 'Royal Society International Images for Science'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3777603/From-droplets-spider-web-spiral-galaxy-Stunning-photos-reveal-natural-beauty-science.html#ixzz4JfHIgjum |title=From droplets on a spider web to a spiral galaxy: Stunning photos reveal the natural beauty in science |publisher=Daily Mail, Libby Plumner  |date= 7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anamorphic sculpture===
Hurwitz has produced a body of work using both [[oblique projection|oblique]] (perspective) and [[catoptric]] (mirror) [[anamorphosis]]. In an interview with Christopher Jobson, Hurwitz explains his anamorphic inspiration as follows: “I have always been torn between art and physics. In a moment of self-doubt in 2008, I wandered into the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] and stumbled across a strange anamorphic piece by [[William Scrots]], a portrait of Edward VI from 1546. Followed shortly down the aisle by The Ambassadors by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] from 1533. My life changed forever. I rushed home and within hours was devouring the works of [[M. C. Escher]], [[Leonardo Da Vinci|Da Vinci]] and many more. In a breath I had found “brothers” in a smallish group of artists spanning 500 years with exactly the same dilemma as me. Within two months I was deep in production of my first work. My art rests on the shoulders of giants, and I am grateful to them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twistedsifter.com/2013/04/anamorphic-sculptures-made-with-algorithms-jonty-hurwitz/  |title=Anamorphic Sculptures Made With Algorithms |publisher=Twisted Sifter |date= 17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anamorphosis]] as a form of art has a long history. A page in Leonardo Da Vinci’s note book (folio 35 verso a of the [[Codex Atlanticus]]) shows two strangely elongated sketches of a child's head and an eye. These distorted and hesitant drawings, the first known anamorphoses, from around 1485”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://startstudioarts.si.edu/2009/08/anamorphoses-in-the-eye-of-leonardo.html |title=Anamorphoses in the eyes of Leonardo |publisher=The Smithsonian, Holly Sloofman |date= 26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-18th Century anamorphosis was also used by [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] artists to secretly depict images of [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]] in the wake of brutal English censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.core77.com/blog/fine_art/how_to_hide_a_forbidden_image_in_plain_sight_anamorphic_cylinders_27356.asp |title=How to Hide a Forbidden Image in Plain Sight |publisher=Core77, Rain Noe |date= 22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurwitz is a pioneer in creating [[catoptric]] sculpture.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Until the creation of his first work ''Rejuvenation'', anamorphic sculptures have not been known to have existed in art history. In his online talks, Hurwitz explains that this is a function of processing power and that whilst painting is possible in a mirror, three dimensional anamorphosis could only have come into being with the advent of powerful computers. Each of his sculptures involves billions of calculations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ignant.de/2013/01/30/anamorphic-sculptures/ |title=Anamorphic Sculptures |publisher=Ignant |date= 13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; using an [[algorithm]] derived from the mathematical constant [[π]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.designboom.com/art/anamorphic-sculptures-by-jonty-hurwitz/ |title=Anamorphic sculptures by Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Design Boom |date= 21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.urbanghostsmedia.com/2013/02/kiss-of-chytrid-anamorphic-art-jonty-hurwitz/ |title=Kiss of Chytrid: Anamorphic art by Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Urban Ghost Media |date= 5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurwitz asserts that his art is “contemporary to the millisecond”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsfwyoutube.com/videos/398405/Jonty-Hurwitz-talk-Contemporary-Art-is-measured-in-milliseconds |title=Contemporary Art is Measured in Milliseconds |publisher=NSFW Youtube, Vera Productions, Jonty Hurwitz |date= March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kinetic Art]] curator and director of the London ''Kinetica Museum'', Dianne Harris, described Hurwitz's art as follows "The works of polymath Jonty Hurwitz are contemporary [[trompe l'oeil]], at first glance appearing abstract, but in mirrored reflections, representational".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinetica-artfair.com/?exhibitors/2013/jonty-hurwitz |title=Kinetica Museum Artist Profile, 2013.  |publisher=Kinetica |date= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nano sculpture===
In 2014, Hurwitz pioneered a new sculptural technique{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} in the field of [[Nanoart]] using [[multiphoton lithography]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cen.chempics.org/post/105392403108/trust-artist-jonty-hurwitz-and-nanoscientist |title=Trust |publisher=Chemical and Engineering News |date= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[photogrammetry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://all3dp.com/enter-photo-studios-21st-century/?hvid=3766p |title=Enter the Photo Studios of the 21st Century |publisher=All3DP |date= 29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create the world’s smallest human portraits of his first love. The works of art were inspired by the nineteenth century marble sculpture of Cupid and Psyche by [[Antonio Canova]], part of the permanent collection of the [[Louvre Museum]], Paris. Hurwitz’s works are so tiny that they are invisible to the human eye, able to be placed on the forehead of an ant. Smaller details of the works are at approximately the 300 [[nanometer]] scale, similar to the [[wavelengths]] of visible light and are therefore near impossible by the laws of physics to see in the visible spectrum.  The only way to observe these works is through a non-optical method of magnification like a [[scanning electron microscope]]. To create these works Hurwitz collaborated with a team of over 20 people, including Stephan Hengsbach of the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] and Yehiam Prior of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], an art project centred in the world of academic [[physics]]. In February 2015, Hurwitz's sculpture "Trust" was awarded the world record for the "Smallest sculpture of a human" by the [[Guinness Book of Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/products/books/superlatives/smallest |title=Sculpture of a human 80 x 100 x 30 micrometers |publisher=Guinness World Records |date= 13 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Beautiful/Decay Hurwitz explains the philosophy behind the works: “As technology starts to evolve faster than our human perception is able to handle, the line between science and myth becomes blurred. We live in an era where the impossible has finally come to pass. In our own little way we have become demigods of creation in our physical world…. The nano works that I present to you here represent more that just a feat of science though. They represent the moment in history that we ourselves are able to create a full human form at the same scale as the sperm that creates us in order to facilitate the creation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beautifuldecay.com/2014/11/12/jonty-hurwitzs-sculptures-small-cant-seen-human-eye/ |title=Jonty Hurwitz’s sculptures are so small the can’t be seen with the human eye |publisher=Beautiful/Decay |date= 12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an online interview with [[Slashdot]], Hurwitz himself asks the question “How can something you can't see be art?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech-beta.slashdot.org/story/14/12/15/1357213/interviews-ask-jonty-hurwitz-about-art-and-engineering |title=Ask Jonty Hurwitz about Art and Engineering |publisher=Slashdot |date= January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By basing his work on the myth of [[Cupid and Psyche]] he also suggests that our belief in modern science isn't that different from the faith the ancient greeks had in the [[demigod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/elegant-nanosculptures-fit-comfortably-inside-the-eye-of-a-needle |title=Elegant Nano Sculptures Fit Comfortably Inside the Eye of a Needle |publisher=The Creators Project, Beckett Mufson  |date= 13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final irony was that the sculptures were destroyed by a touch one week before the images were published on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2836676/Is-smallest-sculpture-Nano-artist-creates-images-nude-model-easily-fit-eye-needle.html |title=Artist spends ten months creating sculptures which are half the width of a human hair... only for his friend to accidentally crush them a few minutes later |publisher=Daily Mail, Stephanie Linning  |date= December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in technology==
In the mid-90s, Hurwitz arrived in London following his travels in India and got his first job researching financial [[data visualization]] for [[Gilbert de Botton]], Chairman and Founder of [[GAM (company)|Global Asset Management]] (GAM). During this period, he was exposed to de Botton’s [[open architecture]] model of asset management. It was Jonty’s close relationship with de Botton, also a major British art collector, that exposed him to the art world. The two maintained a close friendship until de Botton's death in 2000.

Hurwitz left Global Asset Management after two years forming his own company, ''Delve'', to develop the [[Research and Development|R&amp;D]] in [[data visualisation]] and reporting. Jonty’s main client became de Botton himself. In 1996, GAM launched its financial reporting technology built by Hurwitz, which attracted attention in the financial media, winning several awards.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Hurwitz’s newly formed graphics and software team evolved over several years publishing several visualization projects (non-exhaustive list):

*1997 News International visual archives on the [[Cold War]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]], Published by News International
*1998 [[Biosys]] an environmental simulation published by ''Take 2 Interactive''. 
*1998 Hurwitz was selected by the British Foreign Office to build a 3D engine called “Oceans of Innovation” to represent the leading edge of British Innovation.  The work was nominated for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/189832.stm | title=Bafta plugs into interactive awards. | publisher=BBC |date= 9 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years from 2000 to 2005, Hurwitz signed up a large base of asset managers for his reporting and analysis technology. In 2005, Hurwitz’s company ''Delve'' was acquired by [[Alternative Investment Market]] listed company Statpro Group PLC (SOG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/rns/050704sog4008o |title=Acquisition of Delve, a leading supplier of enterprise and web reporting. |publisher=Proactive Investors |date= 4 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurwitz joined Statpro as [[Creative Director]] where he designed the first [[cloud-based|Cloud Computing]] analytics and [[risk]] platform for asset data. In 2008, Statpro launched its flagship product ''Statpro Revolution'' which was the result of this R&amp;D. By 2014, eight out of the top ten largest asset managers in the world were Statpro Clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statpro.com/news/eight-top-ten-largest-asset-managers-world-statpro-clients/ |title=Eight out of the top ten largest asset managers in the world Statpro Clients. |publisher=Statpro |date= 20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurwitz was co-founding Chief Technology Officer of [[Wonga.com]] in 2007 where he designed and built the first real-time online consumer loan system in the world.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} During this period, Wonga’s technology won several awards (listed below). By 2011, Wonga had begun to attract criticism and Hurwitz, as the inventor of the technology, found himself with not enough influence to guide the now large company's use of his designs. After several attempts at changing Wonga's strategy, he resigned from his operational role in November 2011, quietly releasing his sculpture entitled ''Co-Founder''.

Hurwitz's technology is credited with several innovations in the financial services industry:
*Financial sliders. A [[User Interface]] innovation which allowed customers to easily to get a real-time quote on the exact cost of a loan in pound and pennies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/oct/16/wonga-algorithm-lending-debt-data |title=Your prosperity could depend on an Algorithm |publisher=Will Sawney,Guardian |date= 16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of communicating loan information to consumers has been adopted by several of the major high street UK lenders. These include (non-exhaustive list): [[HSBC]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Barclays]], [[Halifax (bank)|Halifax]], [[Lloyd's of London|Lloyds]], [[Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company|Nationwide]], [[Santander Bank]], [[The Co-operative Bank|Co-operative Bank]], [[Natwest]] and [[Bank of Scotland]].
*Real-time risk technology. Wonga’s risk engine was the first ever to evaluate the credit worthiness of a customer in near real time on the internet based on the collection of data from alternative sources in combination with traditional credit scores.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The consumer risk technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2011/03/15/the-algorithm-that-beats-your-bank-manager/ |title=The algorithm that beats your bank manager |publisher=Parmy Olson, Forbes |date= 15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided the ability to transfer money to customers within 12 minutes on the basis of the decision.

Hurwitz continues to commit much of his time to [[Financial technology|fintech]] startups while at the same time building up his body of artwork. In late 2011 Hurwitz backed Damian Kimmelman, to build a next-generation data provider [[Duedil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.growthbusiness.co.uk/news-and-market-deals/fundraising-deals/1679298/duedil-secures-funding-from-wongas-jonty-hurwitz.thtml |title=Duedil secures funding from Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Growth Business, Thomas Hobbs |date= 14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duedil has since been dubbed "The Bloomberg of private companies" and has emerged as one of the key data providers in Europe and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cd830afa-8364-11e3-86c9-00144feab7de.html#axzz3QWzwSOhb |title=UK startup dubbed 'Bloomberg of private companies' raises $17m  |publisher=Financial Times, Jonathan Moules |date= 3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Hurwitz [[seed money|seed funded]] the financial technology startup ''behalf.com''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/challenged-by-upstarts-lenders-try-new-strategy-cooperation/?_r=1&amp;action=Click&amp;contentCollection=Investment%20Banking&amp;module=BlogPost-Title&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body&amp;version=Blog%20Main |title= Challenged by Upstarts, Lenders try a New Strategy: Cooperation  |publisher=New York Times, Randall Smith |date= 7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Hurwitz backed the UK startup bank for young people: ''Meet Osper''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4546">'''Key Stage 4''' is the legal term for the two years of school education which incorporate [[GCSE]]s, and other examinations, in [[state school|maintained school]]s in [[England]] normally known as Year 10 and Year 11, when pupils are aged between 14 and 16. (In some schools, KS4 work is started in Year 9.) 

==Legal definition==
The term is defined in the [[Education Act 2002]] as "the period beginning at the same time as the school year in which the majority of pupils in his class attain the age of fifteen and ending at the same time as the school year in which the majority of pupils in his class cease to be of compulsory school age".&lt;ref name=educationact&gt;Defined in section 82 of the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/32/section/82 Education Act 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that Act, the ending of compulsory education in England has been extended beyond the age of sixteen, but compulsory education beyond the age of 16 is not classed as part of Key Stage 4.

==England and Wales==

===Purpose===
The term is used to define the group of pupils who must follow the relevant programmes of study from the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. All pupils in this Key Stage must follow a programme of education in the following areas:&lt;ref name=nc&gt;Set out on the [http://www.nc.uk.net/nc_resources/html/ks3and4.shtml National Curriculum website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721160225/http://www.nc.uk.net/nc_resources/html/ks3and4.shtml |date=2006-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Science]]
*Information and Communication Technology (England only)
*[[Physical Education]]
*[[Citizenship]]

In addition, there is a statutory duty on schools to provide an optional programme of education for pupils in this Key Stage in each of the following areas:
*The Arts
*Design and Technology
*The Humanities
*[[Modern Foreign Languages]] This list is not limited to those disclosed.

At the end of this stage, pupils aged 16 - in Year 11 - are normally entered for a range of external examinations.  Most frequently, these are GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) examinations, although a range of other qualifications is growing in popularity, including NVQ [[National Vocational Qualification]]s.  These examinations are set by one of the [[examination board]]s. Results of examinations at this age are published as part of the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]]' Performance Tables.

===Northern Ireland===

===Legal definition===
The term is defined in The Education (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 as "the period beginning at the same time as the next school year after the end of key stage 3 and ending at the same time as he ceases to be of compulsory school age".&lt;ref name=NIact&gt;Defined in paragraph 3 of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si2006/20061915.htm#3 Education (Northern Ireland) Order 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the earlier [[Key Stage]]s are defined as lasting for ten years in total from the start of [[compulsory education]].

===Purpose===
The term is used to define the group of pupils who must follow the relevant programmes of study from the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. All pupils in this Key Stage must follow a programme of education in the nine areas of learning in the curriculum, some of which include specific subject strands:&lt;ref name=ninc&gt;Set out on the [http://www.nicurriculum.org.uk/ Northern Ireland National Curriculum website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7627">'''''Laowai''''' is the [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] pronunciation/transliteration of {{lang|zh|{{linktext|老外}}}} ([[pinyin]]: ''lǎowài'', &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"constantly foreign or old foreign"), an informal term or slang for "foreigner" and/or non-Chinese national, usually neutral but possibly impolite or loose in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;The "talk page" might be able to provide more information on the controversy of the term.&lt;/ref&gt; Formal and polite Chinese terms for foreigner include ''wàiguórén'' ({{zh|t={{linktext|外國人}}|s={{linktext|外国人}}|l=foreigner}}), ''wàibīn'' ({{zh|s={{linktext|外宾}}|t={{linktext|外賓}}|l=foreigner guest|labels=no}}),  ''guójì yǒurén'' {{zh|s={{linktext|国际|友人}}|t={{linktext|國際|友人}}|l=international friend|labels=no}}) and ''wàiguó pengyou'' ({{zh|s={{linktext|外國|朋友}}|t={{linktext|外国|朋友}}|l=foreigner friend|labels=no}}).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.waze.net/china/laowai.php Culture: Seven Ways to Say 'Foreigner']". 17 Mar 2004. Accessed 15 Jun 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is typically used to refer to Europeans ('whites', 'Caucasians') especially, and to a lesser extent, Africans ('black'), Native Americans, Latin Americans and Middle Easterners.&lt;ref&gt;Mair, Victor. "[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=11626 Laowai: the old furriner]" at ''Language Log''. 9 Apr 2014. Accessed 15 Jun 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jiangxi.jxnews.com.cn/system/2013/02/08/012285502.shtml|title=老外喜过中国年-中国年-江西新闻网|work=jxnews.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Laowai" usually does not refer to ethnic Han of non-Chinese nationality or other East Asian ethnicities. 

==Etymology==
The use of the word {{zh|c={{linktext|老外}}|labels=no}} began in the 1980s, as an abbreviation of the term {{linktext|外國人}} (foreigner) into {{lang|zh|{{linktext|外}}}} (foreign or outside) plus the character {{lang|zh|{{linktext|老}}}} (old). It can have positive associations, indicating age or experience&amp;mdash;such as ''lǎopéngyou'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|老|朋友}}|l=old friend|labels=no}})&amp;mdash;or respect, as in the familiar use of ''lǎo'' to denote the senior and respected members of families or to address teachers ({{zh|s={{linktext|老師}}|t={{linktext|老师}}|labels=no}}, ''lǎoshī''). It may also be used in combination with part of a person's name (usually the family name) to refer to that person in a familiar and respectful way (for example a person with the surname [[Zhou (surname)|周]], or Zhōu, could be referred to as 老周, literally "Old Zhōu"). This usage is reserved exclusively for adults, but implies familiarity rather than seniority, and is often attached to specific individuals as a nickname rather than being freely used.

However, in certain contexts, it can also carry negative connotations of being old or aged looking ({{zh|s={{linktext|老頭子}}|t={{linktext|老头子}}|labels=no}}), boring old {{linktext|sticks-in-the-mud}}&amp;mdash;as in ''lǎo gǔdǒng'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|老古董}}}})&amp;mdash;or of years of experience and contempt&amp;mdash;as in ''lǎo dōngxi'' ({{zh|s={{linktext|老東西}}|t={{linktext|老东西}}|labels=no|l=old bastard}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "old thing"). It may be used in the [[Chinese theater|arts]] or in jokes with the sense of "always" or "very": a famous comedy role was named the ''Lǎoniān'' ([[:zh:相亲 (小品)|老蔫]], "Constantly Listless"). And [[Tom Hardy]] was affectionately known in mainland China as ''Lǎoshī'' ({{nowrap|{{zh|s={{linktext|老|濕}}}},}} &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|老|湿}}|Constantly Wet|labels=no}}) because of his perpetually shiny hair,&lt;ref&gt;"汤老湿(昵称)" "[https://movie.douban.com/celebrity/1049489/ 汤姆·哈迪 (豆瓣)]"&lt;/ref&gt; also because of his role "Eames" in ''[[Inception]]'' (2010) sounds like {{lang|zh|{{linktext|一|摸|湿}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;Eames，被翻译成“一摸湿” - "[http://view.inews.qq.com/a/20150626A00SSR00 已经好久没有一个演员像汤老湿一样，让我们觉得危险了]"&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used as an empty prefix, particularly with animals such as [[tiger]]s ({{zh|c={{linktext|老虎}}|p=lǎohǔ|labels=no}}), [[mouse|mice]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|老鼠}}|p=lǎoshǔ|labels=no}}), and [[eagle]]s ({{zh|s={{linktext|老鹰}}|t={{linktext|老鷹}}|p=lǎoyīng|labels=no}}).

The term has come to be used for specific countries as well, with ''lǎo-'' functioning as a colloquial equivalent for ''-guórén'': ''lǎoměi'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|老|美}}|l=[[US|American]]|labels=no}}), ''lǎomo'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|老|墨}}|l=[[Mexicans|Mexican]]|labels=no}}); even ''lǎozhōng'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|老|中}}}}) to refer to Chinese ({{zh|s={{linktext|中國人}}|t={{linktext|中国人}}|p=Zhōngguórén|labels=no}}) themselves.

==Usage==
As with [[Spanish language|Spanish]] "[[gringo]]", laowai is not considered a necessarily offensive term by those who choose to use it, but may become so from context (tone, manner, situation, etc.). Among the Chinese, the term is informal and may be used in a neutral, genial, or even good-humored way;&lt;ref name=pd/&gt;. Varyingly, it is ironically embraced, begrudgingly accepted, openly resented, or not minded at all among the Western expatriate community.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond Beyond Well Being''. "[http://beyondwellbeing.com/al/1998/01/the_laowai_racism_and_personal.html The "Laowai", Racism and Personal Space in China]". 16 Jan 1998. Accessed 15 Jun 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Shanghai Star''. "[http://www.china.org.cn/english/12952.htm Laowai Is What You Make It]". 18 May 2001, Hosted by China.org, 2001. Accessed 15 Jun 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The official Chinese press has expressed concern about inappropriate use of laowai and avoids it in all formal reporting.{{refn|Although note its use in such informal human-interest stories as [http://ah.anhuinews.com/system/2012/03/27/004864645.shtml this photo caption] from the Chinese edition of ''[[Anhui News]]''.}} Mark Roswell, known under the stage name [[Dashan]], as one of the most famous Western nationals in China's media industry, has admitted a place for the term but recognizes it as a [[pejorative]], stating that "it is the foreigners [in China] who can't speak any Chinese who are truly 'laowai'" ({{zh|s={{linktext|不|會|說|漢語|的|外國人|那|纔|叫|老外|呢}}|t={{linktext|不|会|说|汉语|的|外国人|那|才|叫|老外|呢}}|labels=no}}).&lt;ref&gt;New Year's Gala (at 186:17). CCTV, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This in itself, implies that the term laowai is something many, including Dashan himself, would prefer to avoid. Editorials, written by Chinese and non-Chinese, have appeared in English and Chinese language newspapers about the subject, particularly around the time of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]],&lt;ref name=pd&gt;''People's Daily Online''. "[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90780/91345/6325229.html Is 'Laowai' a negative term?]". 21 Dec 2007. Accessed 15 Jun 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; when Chinese governments launched campaigns aimed at curbing use of the term in possibly offensive situations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

{{weasel|date=September 2012}}

This article has examples of the influence of [[postmodernism]] on various fields.
&lt;!-- Attention: the following originated from the full split of [[Postmodernism]] performed 30 July 2006. Difference between revisions at: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Postmodernism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66729960 --&gt;

== Art ==
{{Main|Postmodern art}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
Where modernists hoped to unearth universals or the fundamentals of art, postmodernism aims to unseat them, to embrace diversity and contradiction.  A postmodern approach to art thus rejects the distinction between low and high art forms.  The postmodern creator, in turn, is free to combine any elements or styles in a work, even in ways that are counter to or irrelevant to the apparent function of the object.
Postmodern style is often characterized by [[eclecticism]], digression, [[collage]], [[pastiche]], [[irony]], the return of ornament and historical reference, and the appropriation of popular media.  Some artistic movements commonly called postmodern are [[pop art]], architectural [[deconstruction|deconstructivism]], [[magical realism]] in literature, [[maximalism]], and [[neo-romanticism]]. It rejects rigid genre boundaries and promotes [[parody]], [[irony]], and playfulness, commonly referred to as ''[[jouissance]]'' by postmodern theorists. Unlike modern art, postmodern art does not approach this fragmentation as somehow faulty or undesirable, but rather celebrates it. As the gravity of the search for underlying truth is relieved, it is replaced with 'play'. As postmodern icon [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]], and his band [[Talking Heads]] said: "Stop making sense."

Post-modernity, in attacking the perceived elitist approach of Modernism, sought greater connection with broader audiences. This is often labelled "accessibility" and is a central point of dispute in the question of the value of postmodern art. It has also embraced the mixing of words with art, collage and other movements in modernity, in an attempt to create more multiplicity of medium and message. Much of this centers on a shift of basic subject matter: postmodern artists regard the mass media as a fundamental subject for art, and use forms, tropes, and materials - such as banks of video monitors, [[found object]] art, and depictions of media objects - as focal points for their art. With his "invention" of "readymade", [[Marcel Duchamp]] is often seen as a forerunner on postmodern art. Where [[Andy Warhol]] furthered the concept with his appropriation of common popular symbols and "ready-made" cultural artifacts, bringing the previously mundane or trivial onto the previously hallowed ground of high art.

Postmodernism's critical stance is interlinked with presenting new appraisals of previous works. As implied above, the works of the [[Dada]] movement received greater attention, as did collagists such as [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose works were initially considered unimportant in the context of the modernism of the 1950s, but who, by the 1980s, began to be seen as seminal. Post-modernism also elevated the importance of [[film|cinema]] in artistic discussions, placing it on a peer level with the other fine arts. This is both because of the blurring of distinctions between "high" and "low" forms, and because of the recognition that cinema represented the creation of simulacra which was later duplicated in the other arts.
[[Davor Džalto]], for example, attacks the [[postmodern]] positions in [[art]] and [[culture]] generally, confronting a sustainable [[personal identity]], together with notions of [[creativity]], [[liberty|freedom]] and communion, to the postmodern [[deconstruction]] of any [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. But in the [[critique]] he stresses a positive role of postmodern views for a further historical, cultural and artistic development.

== Music ==
{{Main|Postmodern music}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
Postmodern music is both a musical ''style'' and a musical ''condition''. As a musical ''style'', postmodern music contains characteristics of [[postmodern art]]—that is, art ''after'' [[modernism]] (see [[Modernism (music)|Modernism in Music]]); [[Eclecticism in art|eclecticism]] in [[musical form]] and [[musical genre]], combining characteristics from different genres, or employing jump-cut [[Section (music)|sectionalization]] (such as [[block (music)|blocks]]). It tends to be [[Self-reference|self-referential]] and [[irony|ironic]], and it blurs the boundaries between [[fine art|"high art"]] and [[kitsch]]. [[Daniel Albright]] (2004) summarizes the traits of the postmodern style as [[bricolage]], [[polystylism]], and [[randomness]].

As a musical ''condition'', postmodern music is simply the state of music in [[postmodernity]], music after [[modernity]]. In this sense, postmodern music does not have any one particular style or characteristic, and is not necessarily postmodern in ''style'' or technique. The music of modernity, however, was viewed primarily as a means of expression while the music of postmodernity is valued more as a spectacle, a good for mass consumption, and an indicator of group identity. For example, one significant role of music in postmodern society is to act as a badge by which people can signify their identity as a member of a particular [[subculture]].

Postmodernity is also seen as an outgrowth of minimalism, as stated by composer Don Davis. Though it is more likely that it is an outgrowth of early film music of Carl Stalling. Stalling often had no central themes and used abrupt stylistic changes in much the same way as Zorn and Cage would later.

== Graphic design==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
Postmodernism in [[graphic design]] for the most part has been a visual and decorative movement.
Many designers and design critics contend that postmodernism, in the literary or architectural sense of the term, never really impacted graphic design as it did these other fields.
Alternatively, some argue that it did but took on a different persona. This can be seen in the work produced at [[Katherine McCoy|Katherine McCoy's]] program at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan during the late 1980s to late 1990s and at the MFA program at CalArts in California.
But when all was said and done, the various notions of the postmodern in the various design fields never really stuck to graphic design as it did with architecture. Some argue that the "movement" (if it ever was one) had little to no impact on graphic design.
More likely, it did, but more in the sense of a continuation or re-evaluation of the modern. Some would argue that this continuous re-evaluation is also just a component of the design process - happening for most of the second half of the 20th century in the profession.
Since it was ultimately the work of graphic designers that inspired pop artists like Warhol and Liechtenstein, and architects like Robert Venturi and Denise Scott-Brown, it could be argued that graphic design practice and designs may be the root of Postmodernism.

Graphic design saw a massive popular raising at the end of the seventies in form of Graffiti and Hip Hop culture's rise. Graphic forms of expression became a vast everyday hobby among school kids all around the developed western countries. Alongside this 'movement', that took rebellious and even criminal cultural forms, was born the mass hobby of coding computer graphics. This phenomenon worked as a stepping stone towards the graphic infrastructure that is applied in the majority of computer interfaces today.

== Literature ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
{{Main|Postmodern literature}}
Postmodern literature argues for expansion, the return of reference, the celebration of fragmentation rather than the fear of it, and the role of reference itself in literature. While drawing on the experimental tendencies of authors such as [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[William Faulkner]] in English, and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in Spanish - writers who were taken as influences by American postmodern authors such as [[Norman Mailer]], [[Thomas Pynchon]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Don DeLillo]], [[John Barth]], [[William Gaddis]], [[David Foster Wallace]], and [[Paul Auster]] - the advocates of postmodern literature argue that the present is fundamentally different from the modern period, and therefore requires a new literary sensibility.

==Cinema==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
{{Main|Postmodernist film}}
Post modernism in film can loosely be used to describe a film in which the audience's [[suspension of disbelief]] is destroyed, or at the very least toyed with, in order to free the audience's appreciation of the work, and the creator's means with which to express it. The cornerstones of conventional narrative structure and characterisation are changed and even turned on their head in order to create a work whose internal logic forms its means of expression. 

Though a popular movement in theatre, particularly with [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s epic theatre and [[verfremdungseffekt]], post modernist film didn't break into the mainstream until the advent of the [[French New Wave]] in the 1950s and 60's, with such films as [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s  [[À bout de souffle]].  [[Luis Buñuel]] and [[Salvador Dalí]]'s 1928 surrealist short [[Un Chien Andalou]] could be argued as a post modernist film however its extreme deconstruction of structure and character make its meaning almost entirely arbitrary, and thus to still convey some desired meaning post modernist films still maintain some conventional elements in order for the audience to grasp them. Two such examples are [[Jane Campion]]'s Two Friends, in which the story of two school girls is shown in episodic segments arranged in reverse order; and [[Karel Reisz]]'s [[The French Lieutenant's Woman]], in which the story being played out on the screen is mirrored in the private lives of the actors playing it, which we also see. By making small but significant changes to the conventions of cinema the artificiality of the experience and the world presented is emphasised in the audience's mind, in order to remove them from the conventional emotional bonds they have to the subject matter, and to give them a new view of it.

Postmodernism applied to film has four main concepts to think about.

Simulation- taking what has been made, and reusing it. -Through pastiche: intentionally replicated style. -Through parody: drawing irony from styles to make new styles

Pre-fabrication- similar to simulation, draws even closer to already existing and noticeable scenes, and simply reuses them, in narrative, dialogue, etc.

Intertextuality- similar to prefabrication, it’s a text that draws upon other texts. The clearest example is the blatant remake.

Bricolage- building a film like a collage of different film styles and genres

== Architecture==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
{{Main|Postmodern architecture}}
As with many cultural movements, one of postmodernism's most pronounced and visible ideas can be seen in architecture. The functional, and formalized, shapes and spaces of the modernist movement are replaced by unapologetically diverse aesthetics; styles collide, form is adopted for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound.

Architects generally considered postmodern include: [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Philip Johnson]]'s later works, [[John Burgee]], [[Robert Venturi]], [[Ricardo Bofill]], [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]], [[Charles Willard Moore]], and [[Frank Gehry]].

== Planning and urban design==
Post modern landscapes in contemporary [[city|cities]] can be understood better in the context of [[globalization]] which can be described as a variant form of capitalism where a growing proportion of all economic activity is being progressively organised at the international rather than the national, spatial scale.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, B. (2000) ‘City Make-overs: the place-marketing of Melbourne during the Kennett years, 1992-1999’, Urban Policy and Research 18(4), p 470&lt;/ref&gt; This international scope not only influences economic patterns, but also induces a multicultural ambience to metropolitan cities, effectively blending cultures into an altered context. [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], in his seminal work, ''The Condition of Postmodernity'' argues that postmodernism, by way of contrasts, privileges heterogeneity and difference as liberative forces in the redefinition of cultural discourse and rejects [[metanarrative]]s and overarching theories.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, D. (1990) The Condition of Postmodernity, Blackwell, UK, p 9&lt;/ref&gt; It purports an existence of multi-visionary thinking within the mosaic of the contemporary metropolis. It heralded the shift from [[modernism]] to a "perspectivism that questions how radically different realities may co-exist, collide and interpenetrate."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, D. (1990) The Condition of Postmodernity, Blackwell, UK, p 41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital communications==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
[[Technological utopianism]] is a common trait in Western history — from the 18th century when [[Adam Smith]] essentially labelled technological progress as the source of the Wealth of Nations, through the novels of [[Jules Verne]] in the late 19th century (with the notable exception of his then-unpublished ''[[Paris in the Twentieth Century]]''), through [[Winston Churchill]]'s belief that there was little an inventor could not achieve.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Its manifestation in post-modernity was first through the explosion of analog mass broadcasting of television. Strongly associated with the work of [[Marshall McLuhan]] who argued that "the medium is the message", the ability of mass broadcasting to create visual symbols and mass action was seen as a liberating force in human affairs, even though at the same time [[Newton N. Minow]] was calling television "a vast wasteland".{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The second wave of technological utopianism associated with postmodern thought came with the introduction of digital internetworking, and became identified with [[Esther Dyson]] and such popular outlets as [[Wired Magazine]]. According to this view digital communications makes the fragmentation of modern society a positive feature, since individuals can seek out those artistic, cultural and community experiences which they regard as being correct for themselves.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The common thread is that the fragmentation of society and communication gives the individual more autonomy to create their own environment and narrative. This links into the postmodern novel, which deals with the experience of structuring "truth" from fragments.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Political science==
{{Main|Postmodernism in political science}}

According to postmodernist political theorists, there are many situations which are considered political in nature that can not be adequately discussed in traditional [[Realism in international relations|realist]] and [[liberalism|liberal]] approaches to [[political science]]. Some examples they cite include the situation of a “draft-age youth whose identity is claimed in national narratives of ‘national security’ and the universalizing narratives of the ‘rights of man,’” of “the woman whose very womb is claimed by the irresolvable contesting narratives of ‘church,’ ‘paternity,’ ‘economy,’ and ‘liberal polity.’ They argue that in these cases, there are no fixed categories, stable sets of values, or common sense meanings to be understood in their scholarly exploration. They contend that liberal approaches do not aid in understanding these types of situations; arguing that there is no individual or social or institutional structure whose values can impose a meaning or interpretive narrative.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Postmodernists argue that meaning and interpretation in these types of situations is always uncertain and arbitrary. They contend that the [[Power (sociology)|power]] in effect here is not that of [[oppression]], but that of the [[culture|cultural]] and social implications around them, which they say creates the framework within which they see themselves, which creates the boundaries of their possible courses of action.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Postmodern political scientists, such as [[Richard K. Ashley|Richard Ashley]], claim that in these marginal sites it is impossible to construct a coherent narrative, or story, about what is really taking place without including contesting and contradicting narratives, and still have a “true” story from the perspective of a “sovereign subject,” who can dictate the values pertinent to the “meaning” of the situation.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} By regarding them in this way, deconstructive readings attempt to uncover evidence of ancient cultural biases, conflicts, lies, tyrannies, and power structures, such as the tensions and ambiguity between [[peace]] and [[war]], [[lord]] and [[Slavery|subject]], [[male]] and [[female]], which serve as further examples of Derrida's binary oppositions in which the first element is privileged, or considered prior to and more authentic, in relation to the second.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Examples of postmodern political scientists include post-colonial writers such as [[Frantz Fanon]], [[feminism|feminist]] writers such as Cynthia Enloe, and [[Postpositivism|postpositive]] theorists such as Ashley and James Der Derian.

==Language==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
Important to postmodernism's view of language is the focus on the implied meaning of words and the power structures that are accepted as part of the way words are used, from the use of the word "Man" with a capital "M" to refer to humanity collectively, to the default of the word "he" in English as a pronoun for a person of gender unknown to the speaker. However, this is merely the most obvious example of the changing relationship between diction and discourse which postmodernism presents.

An important concept in postmodernism's view of language is the idea of "play" text. In the context of postmodernism, play means changing the framework which connects ideas, and thus allows the troping, or turning, of a metaphor or word from one context to another, or from one frame of reference to another. Since, in postmodern thought, the "text" is a series of "markings" whose meaning is imputed by the reader, and not by the author, this play is the means by which the reader constructs or interprets the text, and the means by which the author gains a presence in the reader's mind. Play then involves invoking words in a manner which undermines their authority, by mocking their assumptions or style, or by layers of misdirection as to the [[Authorial intentionality|intention of the author]]. [[Roland Barthes]] argued this concept, and coined it '[[Death of the Author]]'; this allows for 'freedom of the reader'. Barthes is well known for having stated, "It is language that speaks, not the author". Another key concept is the view that people are, essentially, blank slated linguistically, and that social [[acclimation]], cultural factors, [[habituation]] and images are the primary ways of shaping the structure of how people speak.

==Philosophy==

[[Postmodern philosophy]] is a radical criticism of [[Western philosophy]], because it rejects the universalizing tendencies of philosophy. It applies to movements that include [[post-structuralism]], [[deconstruction]], [[multiculturalism]], [[neo-relativism]], [[neo-marxism]], [[gender studies]] and [[literary theory]]. It emerged beginning in the 1950s as a rejection of doctrines such as [[positivism]], [[Social Darwinism]], materialism and [[objective idealism]]..{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Postmodern philosophy emphasizes the importance of power relationships, personalization and [[discourse]] in the "construction" of truth and world views. In this context it has been used by [[Critical theory|critical theorists]] to assert that postmodernism is a break with the artistic and [[philosophy|philosophical]] tradition of [[the Enlightenment]], which they characterize as a quest for an ever-grander and more universal system of [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], and [[knowledge]]. [[Postmodern philosophy]] draws on a number of approaches to criticize Western thought, including [[historicism]], and [[psychoanalytic theory]].

Postmodern philosophy is criticised for prizing irony over knowledge, and giving the irrational equal footing with the rational.&lt;ref&gt;A [http://www.filosofia.net/materiales/rec/glosaen.htm definition] of ''postmodernism'' in regards to philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of frequently cited works, postmodernism and post-structuralism overlap quite significantly.  Some philosophers, such as Jean-François Lyotard, can legitimately be classified into both groups.  This is partly because both modernism and structuralism owe much to the Enlightenment project.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Structuralism has a strong tendency to be scientific in seeking out stable patterns in observed phenomena — an [[epistemological]] attitude which is quite compatible with Enlightenment thinking, and incompatible with postmodernists.  At the same time, findings from structuralist analysis carried a somewhat anti-Enlightenment message, revealing that rationality can be found in the minds of "savage" people, just in forms differing from those that people from "civilized" societies are used to seeing.  Implicit here is a critique of the practice of colonialism, which was partly justified as a "civilizing" process by which wealthier societies bring knowledge, manners, and reason to less "civilized" ones.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Post-structuralism, emerging as a response to the structuralists' scientific orientation, has kept the cultural relativism in structuralism, while discarding the scientific orientations.

One clear difference between postmodernism and poststructuralism is found in their respective attitudes towards the demise of the project of the Enlightenment: post-structuralism is fundamentally ambivalent, while postmodernism is decidedly celebratory.

Another difference is the nature of the two positions.  While post-structuralism is a position in philosophy, encompassing views on human beings, language, body, society, and many other issues, it is not a name of an era.  Post-modernism, on the other hand, is closely associated with "post-modern" era, a period in the history coming after the modern age.

'''''Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851–1951''''' ('''''Mapping Sculpture''''') is an online [[database]] of [[sculpture|sculptors]] and their works. It is the result of a three-year research programme, funded by the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] and the [[British Academy]]. The project was a partnership between [[University of Glasgow]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and the [[Henry Moore Institute]], with systems development being carried out by the [[Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute]].

The project represents the first authoritative study of sculptors, related businesses and trades, art infrastructures, professional networks and cultural geographies, between the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]], and the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951. The database contains over 50,000 records about sculptural practice.

''Mapping Sculpture'' was originated by Ann Compton (Institute of Art History, University of Glasgow), who served as Project Director and Editor, with Professor Alison Yarrington (University of Glasgow, now University of Hull) as Principal Investigator and Dr. Marjorie Trusted (Victoria and Albert Museum) as Co-Investigator. HATII's Matthew Barr was the Systems Developer.

An upcoming special issue of the ''[http://www.pmsa.org.uk/publications/sculpture-journal/ Sculpture Journal]'', devoted to the ''Mapping Sculpture'' project, is due to be published in December 2012.

'''Mary Blathwayt''' (1 February 1879 &amp;ndash; 25 June 1961)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50066|title=Mary Blathwayt|last=Hannam|first=June|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/50066}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British feminist, suffragette and social reformer. She lived at [[Eagle House (suffragette's rest)|Eagle House]] in [[Somerset]] that became known as the "Suffragette's Rest".

== Early life ==
Mary Blathwayt was born 1 February 1879 in [[Worthing]], [[Sussex]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/09b3cec7-ebca-42fb-90a3-068b95d21125|title=The Discovery Service|last=Archives|first=The National|website=discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of Colonel Linley Blathwayt, an army officer who had served in [[India]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Wblathwayt.htm|title=Mary Blathwayt|last=Simkin|first=John|date=September 1997|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=2017-10-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Emily Blathwayt]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; who were first cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/c22ba25e-4d98-4df1-bc5e-08d6c2e3cced|title=The Discovery Service|last=Archives|first=The National|website=discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon retiring from active service, Colonel Blathwayt and his family moved from India to Eagle House, [[Batheaston]], on the outskirts of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Her younger brother, William, trained as an electrical engineer and taught English in Germany for many years before returning to [[England]] at the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]]. Mary, remained at home and attended [[Bath High School]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Campaigning for women's suffrage ==
[[File:Suffragettes_Annie_Kenney,_Mary_Blathwayt_and_Emmeline_Pankhurst,_Eagle_House,_Batheaston_1910.jpg|thumb|[[Annie Kenney]] to the left, Blathwayt at centre and [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], with the spade, at Eagle House in [[Batheaston]] in 1910]]
Blathwayt and her mother started attending meetings of the [[Bath Women's Suffrage Society]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In July 1906, Blathwayt gave three shillings to [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She first met [[Annie Kenney]] at a WSPU meeting in Bath and agreed to help Kenney, [[Elsie Howey]], [[Clara Codd]] and [[Mary Elizabeth Phillips (suffragette)|Mary Phillips]] to organise the women's suffrage campaign in her area. Blathwayt was given an allowance by her family to support her in her work for women's rights. Many major people from the suffragette movement were invited to stay at her house and to plant a tree to celebrate a prison sentence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

However when [[Vera Wentworth]] and [[Elsie Howey]] assaulted the Prime Minister this proved too much for Mary Blathwayt's family. Her mother, [[Emily Blathwayt|Emily]], resigned from the WSPU and her father, Linley, wrote letters of protest to [[Christabel Pankhurst]], Howey and Wentworth. Pankhurst was told that Howey and Wentworth could not visit their house again. Wentworth sent them a long reply expressing regret at their reaction but noting that "if Mr. Asquith will not receive deputation they will pummel him again".&lt;ref name=":vera"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/WwentworthV.htm|title=Vera Wentworth|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=2017-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and legacy==
Following her retirement from the WSPU, Blathwayt lived a quiet life with her family at Eagle House until her death on 25 June 1961.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The sixty trees that were planted at Eagle House were removed to make way for a housing estate. Other trees have been planted to mirror the lost memorials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-12682411|title=Trees honour Bath's suffragettes|date=2011-03-09|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blathwayt's diary reveals that she probably had an affair with [[Christabel Pankhurst|Cristabel Pankhurst]] before Pankhurst moved on to [[Annie Kenney]]. Blathwayt made notes of Kenney's sleeping partners when she stayed at Eagle House and jealousy has been proposed as the reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/11/vanessathorpe.theobserver|title=Diary reveals lesbian love trysts of suffragette leaders|last=Thorpe|first=Vanessa|date=2000-06-11|work=The Observer|access-date=2017-10-27|last2=Marsh|first2=Alec|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 the Local Planning Authority overruled local objections and allowed the gardens to be redeveloped. The house was kept but its contents were auctioned and this included a Boadicea brooch given by Annie Kenney to Mary Blathwayt. The garden did not completely go unnoticed as a local journalist noted that the contents of the house were unimportant when compared to the suffragette's garden.&lt;ref name="Hammond20172"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FikxDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT198|title="Architects, Angels, Activists and the City of Bath, 1765?965 ": Engaging with Women's Spatial Interventions in Buildings and Landscape|author=Cynthia Imogen Hammond|date=5 July 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-57612-3|pages=198–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narrative medicine''' is a [[medicine|medical]] approach that utilizes people's [[narrative]]s in [[clinical practice]], research, and education as a way to promote healing. It aims to address the relational and psychological dimensions that occur in tandem with physical illness, with the attempt to treat patients as humans with individual stories, rather than purely based on symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.law.nyu.edu/experientiallearninglab/methods/narrativemedicine/
| title = Narrative Medicine {{!}} NYU School of Law
| website = www.law.nyu.edu
| access-date = 2016-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing this, narrative medicine aims not only to validate the experience of the patient, but also to encourage creativity and self-reflection in the physician.
==History==

In 1910, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching created Flexner's report, which set out to redefine medical educational practices. In this report, it argued that the proper goal of medicine is "to attempt to fight the battle against disease."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flexner|first=|date=1910|title=Medical Education in the United States and Canada|url=|journal=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the late 20th century, critics alleged that [[Western medicine]] had fallen victim to the professionalism movement. They argued that many [[medical schools]] and residency programs train physicians to treat medical problems purely on their symptoms without taking into account the specific psychological and personal history of the patient. The emergence of narrative medicine came as a contemporary effort to rehumanize medicine.

One prominent medical school that first began a program on narrative medicine was [[Columbia University Medical Center]] with their opening of the first Program in Narrative Medicine. Built within their College of Physicians and Surgeons, they believe that narrative medicine can make profound changes to the way medical treatment is administered:

“Narrative Medicine fortifies clinical practice with the narrative competence to recognize, absorb, metabolize, interpret, and be moved by the stories of illness. Through narrative training, the Program in Narrative Medicine helps physicians, nurses, social workers, mental health professionals, chaplains, social workers, academics, and all those interested in the intersection between narrative and medicine improve the effectiveness of care by developing these skills with patients and colleagues. Our research and outreach missions are conceptualizing, evaluating, and spear-heading these ideas and practices nationally and internationally."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the executive director of this program and has published and lectured on the benefits of doctors receiving narrative training as a way to increase empathy and reflection in the medical professional field.

As of the late 1990s, physicians like [[Rachel Naomi Remen]] and [[Rita Charon]] have argued that medical practice should be structured around the narratives of patients. Charon stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "Sick people need physicians who can understand their diseases, treat their medical problems, and accompany them through their illnesses."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Educational Programs==
The number of schools in the United States that offer advanced classes in narrative medicine has been growing.
* The [[Columbia University Medical Center]] has been the leading pioneer of developing educational programs for the field of narrative medicine. In addition to lectures and seminars given throughout the year, Columbia University created the Master of Science in Narrative Medicine program for graduate students in 2009, making it one of the first graduate programs devoted strictly to narrative medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/education/edlife/03narrative.html "Learning to Listen"] New York Times (2009-12-29)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Montefiore Medical Center]] is the academic medical center and University Hospital for [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]]. This medical center created a program in Narrative Medicine as a subset of the Department of Family and Social Medicine. Residents at this school attend programs where they learn how to use personal narrative to enhance empathy, as well as topics including stress, loss, and balance.
* The [[Ohio State University]] Humanities Institute is also supporting the multidisciplinary initiative of narrative medicine. This program runs concurrently with their other undergraduate and graduate programs, where students "strive to develop narrative competence that enables them to deliver care that is not only more empathetic and compassionate, but also more effective." 
* The [[University of California, Irvine|University of California Irvine]] College of Medicine has created an Integrative Medicine Program within the Department of Family Medicine. This program "strives to change the focus of healthcare and medical education for our residents, medical students and faculty to include a multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach that emphasizes wellness, prevention, and self-care skills, and the adoption of the principles for creating optimal healing environments."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Integrative Medicine Program {{!}} Department of Family Medicine {{!}} University of California, Irvine
| website = www.familymed.uci.edu
| access-date = 2016-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2011, Western University created the Narrative Medicine Initiative (NMI) and has incorporated narrative medicine into the undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuing medical education departments. They work to answer questions such as "How does the art of storytelling improve health care education and the experience of patient care?"
* Lenoir-Rhyne University has established the Thomas Wolfe Center for Narrative, with the slogan "Heeding the call for narrative in a fragmented world." This program offers graduate-level and certification courses in several narrative training disciplines, one of which is narrative medicine.
* Saybrook University takes a broad approach to narrative medicine through their mind-body medicine program. This seeks to approve the mind-body approach to health and wellness as a way to improve quality of life for patients.

This growing field of narrative medicine extends beyond the United States: The British Medical Journal have begun adding their own writing seminars to promote this type of narrative in its emerging physicians.

==Obstacles==
Rachel Remen asserts,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
People who are physicians have been trained to believe that it is a scientific objectivity that makes them most effective in their efforts to understand and resolve the pain that others bring them, and a mental distance that protects them from becoming wounded from this difficult work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = Riverhead Books
| isbn = 9781594482090
| last = Remen
| first = Rachel Naomi
| title = Kitchen Table Wisdom: Stories That Heal
| date = 2006-08-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Objectivity, empathy, and global thinking are stated to not be incompatible with a degree of dissociation from the patient's suffering that is sufficient to protect oneself.

A '''national emblem''' is an [[emblem]] or [[seal (emblem)|seal]] that is reserved for use by a [[nation state]] or [[multi-national state]] as a symbol of that nation. Many nations have a seal or emblem in addition to a [[national flag]] and a [[national coat of arms]]. Other [[national symbol]]s, such as national birds, trees, flowers, etc., are listed at [[lists of national symbols]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1722">'''Neo-Fauvism''' was a poetic style of painting from the mid-1920s proposed as a challenge to [[Surrealism]].&lt;ref name=grant&gt;Grant, Kim. ''Surrealism and the Visual Arts: Theory and Reception'', [http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521836555&amp;ss=exc Introduction]. Cambridge University Press 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-521-83655-5}}, {{ISBN|0-521-83655-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The magazine ''Cahiers d'Art'' was launched in 1926 and its writers mounted a challenge to the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] practice of [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] by seeing it not in terms of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] expression, but as another development of traditional artistry. They identified a group of artists as the exponents of this and termed them Neo-Fauves.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt;

Although these artists were later mostly forgotten, the movement had an effect of disillusioning the Surrealist group with the technique of graphic automatism as a revolutionary means of by-passing conventional aesthetics, ideology and commercialism.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt; 

Neo-Fauvism has been seen as the last trend within painting that could be marketed as a coherent style.&lt;ref name=GoetheInsitut&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/kue/bku/thm/ein/en178614.htm Goethe-Institut], retrieved 10 June 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822212258/http://www.goethe.de/kue/bku/thm/ein/en178614.htm |date=August 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''origin of speech''' refers to the more general problem of the [[origin of language]] in the context of the physiological
development of the human [[speech organs]] such as the   [[tongue]], [[lip]]s and [[Place of articulation|vocal organs]] used to produce [[Phoneme|phonological units]] in [[human universal|all human languages]].

==Background==
Although related to the more general problem of the [[origin of language]], the [[evolution]] of distinctively human [[speech]] capacities has become a distinct and in many ways separate area of scientific research.&lt;ref name="Hockett 1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hockett|first1=Charles F. | author1link = Charles F.

Speech is in this sense optional, although it is the default modality for language.[[Image:Places of articulation.svg|thumb|250px|Places of articulation (passive and active):&lt;br /&gt;1.

Uncontroversially, monkeys, apes and humans, like many other animals, have evolved specialised mechanisms for producing ''sound'' for purposes of social communication.&lt;ref&gt;Kelemen, G. (1963). Comparative anatomy and performance of the vocal organ in vertebrates. In R. Busnel (ed.), ''Acoustic behavior of animals.'' Amsterdam:  Elsevier, pp. 489–521.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, no monkey or ape uses its ''tongue'' for such purposes.&lt;ref name="Riede 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Riede | first1 = T. | last2 = Bronson | first2 = E. | last3 = Hatzikirou | first3 = H. | last4 = Zuberbühler | first4 = K. | title = Vocal production mechanisms in a non-human primate: morphological data and a model. | journal = [[J Hum Evol]] | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–96 |date=Jan 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.10.002 | PMID = 15656937 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riede Bronson 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Riede|first1=T.| last2=Bronson|first2=E.|last3=Hatzikirou |first3=H.| last4=Zuberbühler| first4=K.|title=Multiple discontinuities in nonhuman vocal tracts&amp;nbsp;— A reply|journal=Journal of Human Evolution| volume=50| issue=2|year=2006| pages=222–225|url=https://www.academia.edu/335565/Multiple_discontinuities_in_nonhuman_vocal_tracts_-_A_response_to_Lieberman|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our species' unprecedented use of the tongue, lips and other moveable parts seems to place speech in a quite separate category, making its evolutionary emergence an intriguing theoretical challenge in the eyes of many scholars.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2000" /&gt;

==Modality-independence==
[[Image:Brain Surface Gyri.SVG|thumb|Language Areas of the brain. The [[angular gyrus]] is represented in orange, [[supramarginal gyrus]] is represented in yellow, [[Broca's area]] is represented in blue, [[Wernicke's area]] is represented in green and the [[auditory cortex|primary auditory cortex]] is represented in pink.]]
The term ''[[Modality (semiotics)|modality]]'' means the chosen representational format for encoding and transmitting information. A striking feature of language is that it is ''modality-independent.'' Should an impaired child be prevented from hearing or producing sound, its innate capacity to master a language may equally find expression in signing. Sign languages of the deaf are independently invented and have all the major properties of spoken language except for the modality of transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, W. C. 1960. ''Sign language structure: an outline of the communicative systems of the American deaf.'' Silver Spring, MD: Linstock Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bellugi, U. and E. S. Klima 1975. Aspects of sign language and its structure. In J. F. Kavanagh and J. E. Cutting (eds), ''The Role of Speech in Language.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, pp. 171 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickok 1996"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hickok | first1 = G. | last2 = Bellugi | first2 = U. | last3 = Klima | first3 = ES. | title = The neurobiology of sign language and its implications for the neural basis of language. | journal = Nature | volume = 381 | issue = 6584 | pages = 699–702 |date=Jun 1996 | doi = 10.1038/381699a0 | pmid = 8649515 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kegl 1999"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Kegl| first1 = Judy | last2 = Senghas| first2 = Ann | last3 = Coppola| first3 = Marie | title = Creation through Contact: Sign Language Emergence and Sign Language Change in Nicaragua / Judy Kegl, Ann Senghas, Marie Coppola| editors = Michel DeGraff | work = Language creation and language change : creolization, diachrony, and development| year = 1999 | publisher = MIT Press| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts| isbn = 978-0-262-04168-3| oclc = 39508250}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this it appears that the [[language center|language centres]] of the human brain must have evolved to function optimally irrespective of the selected modality.

This feature is extraordinary. Animal communication systems routinely combine visible with audible properties and effects, but not one is modality-independent. No vocally impaired whale, dolphin or songbird, for example, could express its song repertoire equally in visual display. Indeed, in the case of animal communication, message and modality are not capable of being disentangled. Whatever message is being conveyed stems from intrinsic properties of the signal.

Modality independence should not be confused with the ordinary phenomenon of multimodality. Monkeys and apes rely on a repertoire of species-specific "gesture-calls"&amp;nbsp;— emotionally expressive vocalisations inseparable from the visual displays which accompany them.&lt;ref name="Goodall 1986"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Goodall | first1 = Jane | title = The chimpanzees of Gombe : patterns of behavior | year = 1986 | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-674-11649-8 | oclc = 12550961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burling | first1 = R | year = 1993 | title = Primate calls, human language, and nonverbal communication | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 25–53 | doi=10.1086/204132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans also have species-specific gesture-calls&amp;nbsp;— laughs, cries, sobs and so forth&amp;nbsp;— together with involuntary gestures accompanying speech.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin. C. 1872. ''The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals.'' London: Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ekman, P. 1982. ''Emotion in the Human Face,'' 2nd Edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeil, D. 1992. ''Hand and Mind. What gestures reveal about thought.'' Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many animal displays are polymodal in that each appears designed to exploit multiple channels simultaneously.

The human linguistic property of "modality independence" is conceptually distinct from this. It allows the speaker to encode the informational content of a message in a single channel, while switching between channels as necessary. Modern city-dwellers switch effortlessly between the spoken word and writing in its various forms&amp;nbsp;— handwriting, typing, e-mail and so forth. Whichever modality is chosen, it can reliably transmit the full message content without external assistance of any kind. When talking on the telephone, for example, any accompanying facial or manual gestures, however natural to the speaker, are not strictly necessary. When typing or manually signing, conversely, there's no need to add sounds. In many Australian Aboriginal cultures, a section of the population&amp;nbsp;— perhaps women observing a ritual taboo&amp;nbsp;— traditionally restrict themselves for extended periods to a silent (manually signed) version of their language.&lt;ref&gt;Kendon, A. 1988. ''Sign Languages of Aboriginal Australia.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, when released from the taboo, these same individuals resume narrating stories by the fireside or in the dark, switching to pure sound without sacrifice of informational content.

==Evolution of the speech organs==
[[Image:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Human vocal tract]]
Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. Humans' first recourse is to encode our thoughts in sound&amp;nbsp;— a method which depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus.

The speech organs, everyone agrees, evolved in the first instance not for speech but for more basic bodily functions such as feeding and breathing. Nonhuman primates have broadly similar organs, but with different neural controls.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | title = The evolution of speech: a comparative review. | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = 258–267 |date=Jul 2000 | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01494-7 | pmid = 10859570 | url = http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic151491.files/Fitch2000TICS.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apes use their highly flexible, maneuverable tongues for eating but not for vocalizing.   When an ape is not eating, fine motor control over its tongue is deactivated.&lt;ref name="Riede 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Riede Bronson 2006" /&gt; ''Either'' it is performing gymnastics with its tongue ''or'' it is vocalising; it cannot perform both activities simultaneously. Since this applies to mammals in general, ''Homo sapiens'' is exceptional in harnessing mechanisms designed for respiration and ingestion to the radically different requirements of articulate speech.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, Peter, 2008. ''The Origin of Speech.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tongue===
[[Image:Spectrogram -iua-.png|250px|thumb|[[Spectrogram]] of American English vowels {{IPA|[i, u, ɑ]}} showing the formants ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
The word "language" derives from the Latin ''lingua,'' "tongue". Phoneticians agree that the tongue is the most important speech articulator, followed by the lips. A natural language can be viewed as a particular way of using the tongue to express thought.

The human tongue has an unusual shape. In most mammals, it's a long, flat structure contained largely within the mouth. It is attached at the rear to the [[hyoid bone]], situated below oral level in the [[pharynx]]. In humans, the tongue has an almost circular [[Sagittal plane|sagittal]] (midline) contour, much of it lying vertically down an extended [[pharynx]], where it is attached to a hyoid bone in a lowered position. Partly as a result of this, the horizontal (inside-the-mouth) and vertical (down-the-throat) tubes forming the supralaryngeal vocal tract (SVT) are almost equal in length (whereas in other species, the vertical section is shorter). As we move our jaws up and down, the tongue can vary the cross-sectional area of each tube independently by about 10:1, altering formant frequencies accordingly. That the tubes are joined at a right angle permits pronunciation of the vowels '''[i], [u]''' and '''[a]''', which nonhuman primates cannot do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = P. | last2 = Crelin | first2 = E. S. | last3 = Klatt | first3 = D. H. | year = 1972 | title = Phonetic ability and related anatomy of the newborn, adult human, Neanderthal man, and the chimpanzee | url = | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 287–307 | doi=10.1525/aa.1972.74.3.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when not performed particularly accurately, in humans the articulatory gymnastics needed to distinguish these vowels yield consistent, distinctive acoustic results, illustrating the [[Quantum|quantal]] nature of human speech sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, K. N. 1972. The quantal nature of speech: Evidence from articulatory-acoustic data. In P. B. Denes and E. E. David, Jr. (eds.), ''Human Communication: A unified view.'' New York: McGraw-Hill, pp. 51–66.&lt;/ref&gt; It may not be coincidental that '''[i], [u]''' and '''[a]''' are the most common vowels in the world's languages.&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, P. and Maddieson, I. 1996. ''The Sounds of the World's Languages.'' Malden: MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lips===
In humans, the lips are important for the production of [[stop consonant|stops]] and [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]], in addition to [[vowel]]s. Nothing, however, suggests that the lips evolved for those reasons. During primate evolution, a shift from nocturnal to diurnal activity in [[tarsier]]s, monkeys and apes (the [[Haplorhini|haplorhines]]) brought with it an increased reliance on vision at the expense of olfaction. As a result, the snout became reduced and the [[rhinarium]] or "wet nose" was lost. The muscles of the face and lips consequently became less constrained, enabling their co-option to serve purposes of facial expression. The lips also became thicker. "Hence", according to one major authority, "the evolution of mobile, muscular lips, so important to human speech, was the exaptive result of the evolution of diurnality and visual communication in the common ancestor of haplorhines".&lt;ref&gt;MacLarnon, A. 2012. The anatomical and physiological basis of human speech production: adaptations and exaptations. In M. Tallerman and K. .Gibson (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 224-235.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether our lips have undergone more recent adaptation to the specific requirements of speech.

===Respiratory control===
Compared with nonhuman primates, humans have significantly enhanced control of breathing, enabling exhalations to be extended and inhalations shortened as we speak. While we are speaking, intercostal and interior abdominal muscles are recruited to expand the thorax and draw air into the lungs, and subsequently to control the release of air as the lungs deflate. The muscles concerned are markedly more innervated in humans than in nonhuman primates.&lt;ref&gt;MacLarnon, A. M. (1993). The vertebral canal. In A. Walker and R. Leakey (eds.), ''The Nariokotome ''Homo erectus'' skeleton.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 359–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from fossil hominins suggests that the necessary enlargement of the vertebral canal, and therefore spinal cord dimensions, may not have occurred in ''Australopithecus'' or ''Homo erectus''  but was present in the Neanderthals and early modern humans.&lt;ref name="MacLarnon 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=MacLarnon AM, Hewitt GP |title=The evolution of human speech: the role of enhanced breathing control |journal=Am.

===Larynx===
[[File:Illu larynx.jpg]]

The '''[[larynx]]''' or '''voice box''' is an organ in the neck housing the [[vocal folds]], which are responsible for [[phonation]]. In humans, the larynx is ''descended''. Our species is not unique in this respect: goats, dogs, pigs and tamarins lower the larynx temporarily, to emit loud calls.&lt;ref name="Fitch. WT 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | title = The phonetic potential of nonhuman vocal tracts: comparative cineradiographic observations of vocalizing animals. | journal = Phonetica | volume = 57 | issue = 2–4 | pages = 205–18  | year = 2000  | doi =  10.1159/000028474| pmid = 10992141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several deer species have a permanently lowered larynx, which may be lowered still further by males during their roaring displays.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | last2 = Reby | first2 = D. | title = The descended larynx is not uniquely human. | journal = Proc Biol Sci | volume = 268 | issue = 1477 | pages = 1669–75 |date=Aug 2001 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2001.1704 | pmid = 11506679 | pmc = 1088793}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lions, jaguars, cheetahs and domestic cats also do this.&lt;ref name="Weissengruber 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Weissengruber | first1 = GE. | last2 = Forstenpointner | first2 = G. | last3 = Peters | first3 = G. | last4 = Kübber-Heiss | first4 = A. | last5 = Fitch | first5 = WT. | title = Hyoid apparatus and pharynx in the lion (Panthera leo), jaguar (Panthera onca), tiger (Panthera tigris), cheetah (Acinonyxjubatus) and domestic cat (Felis silvestris f. catus). | journal = J Anat | volume = 201 | issue = 3 | pages = 195–209 |date=Sep 2002 | doi = 10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00088.x | pmid = 12363272 |pmc = 1570911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, laryngeal descent in nonhumans (according to Philip Lieberman) is not accompanied by descent of the hyoid; hence the tongue remains horizontal in the oral cavity, preventing it from acting as a pharyngeal articulator.&lt;ref name="Lieberman 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lieberman|first1=Philip|title=The Evolution of Human Speech: Its Anatomical and Neural Bases|journal=Current Anthropology| volume=48| issue=1| year=2007 |pages=39–66| url=http://www.cog.brown.edu/people/lieberman/pdfFiles/Lieberman%20P.%202007.%20The%20evolution%20of%20human%20speech,%20Its%20anatom.pdf| doi=10.1086/509092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite all this, scholars remain divided as to how "special" the human vocal tract really is. It has been shown that the larynx does descend to some extent during development in chimpanzees, followed by hyoidal descent.&lt;ref name="Nishimura 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nishimura | first1 = T. | last2 = Mikami | first2 = A. | last3 = Suzuki | first3 = J. | last4 = Matsuzawa | first4 = T. | title = Descent of the hyoid in chimpanzees: evolution of face flattening and speech. | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–54 |date=Sep 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.03.005 | pmid = 16730049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As against this, Philip Lieberman points out that only humans have evolved permanent and substantial laryngeal descent in association with hyoidal descent, resulting in a curved tongue and two-tube vocal tract with 1:1 proportions. Uniquely in the human case, simple contact between the epiglottis and velum is no longer possible, disrupting the normal mammalian separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts during swallowing. Since this entails substantial costs&amp;nbsp;— increasing the risk of choking while swallowing food&amp;nbsp;— we are forced to ask what benefits might have outweighed those costs. The obvious benefit&amp;nbsp;— so it is claimed&amp;nbsp;— must have been speech. But this idea has been vigorously contested. One objection is that humans are in fact ''not'' seriously at risk of choking on food: medical statistics indicate that accidents of this kind are extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;M. Clegg 2001. The Comparative Anatomy and Evolution of the Human Vocal Tract Unpublished thesis, University of London.&lt;/ref&gt; Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as we know it emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of ''Homo sapiens.''&lt;ref name="Perreault 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Perreault | first1 = C. | last2 = Mathew | first2 = S. | title = Dating the origin of language using phonemic diversity. | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e35289 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035289 | pmid = 22558135| pmc = 3338724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A development as complex as the reconfiguration of the human vocal tract would have required much more time, implying an early date of origin. This discrepancy in timescales undermines the idea that human vocal flexibility was ''initially'' driven by selection pressures for speech.

At least one [[orangutan]] has demonstrated the ability to control the voice box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Orangutan's Vocal Feats Hint At Deeper Roots of Human Speech |author=Jon Hamilton |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/14/518170608/orangutans-vocal-feats-hint-at-deeper-roots-of-human-speech |date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The size exaggeration hypothesis ====
To lower the larynx is to increase the length of the vocal tract, in turn lowering [[formant]] frequencies so that the voice sounds "deeper"&amp;nbsp;— giving an impression of greater size. John Ohala argues that the function of the lowered larynx in humans, especially males, is probably to enhance threat displays rather than speech itself.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Ohala, 2000. [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~ohala/papers/lowered_larynx.pdf The irrelevance of the lowered larynx in modern Man for the development of speech.] Paris, ENST: ''The Evolution of Language,'' pp. 171-172.&lt;/ref&gt; Ohala points out that if the lowered larynx were an adaptation for speech, we would expect adult human males to be better adapted in this respect than adult females, whose larynx is considerably less low. In fact, females invariably outperform males in verbal tests, falsifying this whole line of reasoning. W. Tecumseh Fitch likewise argues that this was the original selective advantage of laryngeal lowering in our species. Although (according to Fitch) the initial lowering of the larynx in humans had nothing to do with speech, the increased range of possible formant patterns was subsequently co-opted for speech. Size exaggeration remains the sole function of the extreme laryngeal descent observed in male deer. Consistent with the size exaggeration hypothesis, a second descent of the larynx occurs at puberty in humans, although only in males. In response to the objection that the larynx is descended in human females, Fitch suggests that mothers vocalising to protect their infants would also have benefited from this ability.&lt;ref&gt;Fitch, W. T. (2002). Comparative vocal production and the evolution of speech: Reinterpreting the descent of the larynx. In A. Wray (ed.), ''The Transition to Language.''

===Could the Neanderthals speak?===
[[File:Gray186.png|thumb|Hyoid bone&amp;nbsp;— anterior surface, enlarged]]
[[File:Gray1194.png|thumb|Anterolateral view of head and neck]]

Most specialists credit the Neanderthals with speech abilities not radically different from those of modern ''Homo sapiens''. An indirect line of argument is that their tool-making and hunting tactics would have been difficult to learn or execute without some kind of speech.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn &amp; Coolidge, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; A recent extraction of [[DNA]] from Neanderthal bones indicates that Neanderthals had the same version of the [[FOXP2]] gene as modern humans. This gene, once mistakenly described as the "grammar gene", plays a role in controlling the orofacial movements which (in modern humans) are involved in speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Nicholas |last=Wade |authorlink=Nicholas Wade |date=19 October 2007 |title=Neanderthals Had Important Speech Gene, DNA Evidence Shows |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/science/19speech-web.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, it was widely believed that the Neanderthals lacked modern speech capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Philip |last=Lieberman |author2=Edmund S.

The hyoid bone is present in many [[mammal]]s. It allows a wide range of tongue, pharyngeal and laryngeal movements by bracing these structures alongside each other in order to produce variation.&lt;ref name="Nishimura 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nishimura | first1 = T. | last2 = Mikami | first2 = A. | last3 = Suzuki | first3 = J. | last4 = Matsuzawa | first4 = T. | title = Descent of the larynx in chimpanzee infants. | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 100 | issue = 12 | pages = 6930–3 | date=Jun 2003 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1231107100 | pmid = 12775758 | pmc = 165807}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now realised that its lowered position is not unique to ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', while its relevance to vocal flexibility may have been overstated: although men have a lower larynx, they do not produce a wider range of sounds than women or two-year-old babies.

The morphology of the [[outer ear|outer]] and [[middle ear]] of [[Middle Pleistocene]] hominins from [[Atapuerca, Province of Burgos|Atapuerca]] SH in Spain, believed to be proto-Neanderthal, suggests they had an auditory sensitivity similar to modern humans and very different from chimpanzees.

The hypoglossal nerve plays an important role in controlling movements of the tongue. In 1998, one research team used the size of the hypoglossal canal in the base of fossil skulls in an attempt to estimate the relative number of nerve fibres, claiming on this basis that Middle Pleistocene hominins and Neanderthals had more fine-tuned tongue control than either [[australopithecine]]s or apes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kay | first1 = R.

==Origin of speech sounds==

===Distinctive features theory===
{{IPA vowels|class=infobox}}
According to one influential school,&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R., Gunnar, C., Fant, M. and Halle, M. 1952. ''Preliminaries to Speech Analysis.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. and M. Halle 1956. ''Fundamentals of Language.'' The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; the human vocal apparatus is intrinsically digital on the model of a keyboard or digital computer. If so, this is remarkable: nothing about a chimpanzee's vocal apparatus suggests a digital keyboard, notwithstanding the anatomical and physiological similarities. This poses the question as to when and how, during and the course of human evolution, the transition from analog to digital structure and function occurred.

The human supralaryngeal tract is said to be digital in the sense that it is an arrangement of moveable toggles or switches, each of which, at any one time, must be in one state or another. The vocal cords, for example, are either vibrating (producing a sound) or not vibrating (in silent mode). By virtue of simple physics, the corresponding [[distinctive feature]]&amp;nbsp;— in this case, "voicing"&amp;nbsp;— cannot be somewhere in between. The options are limited to "off" and "on". Equally digital is the feature known as "[[Nasalization|nasalisation]]". At any given moment the [[soft palate]] or velum either allows or doesn't allow sound to resonate in the nasal chamber. In the case of lip and tongue positions, more than two digital states may be allowed. '''(To experiment with this, click on [http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~danhall/phonetics/sammy.html Interactive Saggital Section]).'''

The theory that speech sounds are composite entities constituted by complexes of binary phonetic features was first advanced in 1938 by the Russian linguist [[Roman Jakobson]].&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. 1938. "Observations sur le classement phonologiques des consonnes", in ''Proceedings of the 3rd International Congress of Phonetic Sciences,'' Ghent.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent early supporter of this approach was [[Noam Chomsky]], who went on to extend it from phonology to language more generally, in particular to the study of syntax and semantics.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1957. ''Syntactic Structures.'' The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1964 [1962]. The logical basis of linguistic theory. In H.G. Lunt (ed.), The Proceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Linguists. The Hague: Mouton, pp. 914-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. and Halle, M. 1968. ''The Sound Pattern of English.'' New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1965 book, ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax,''&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1965. ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, pp. 148-192.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky treated semantic concepts as combinations of binary-digital atomic elements explicitly on the model of distinctive features theory. The lexical item "bachelor", on this basis, would be expressed as [+ Human], [+ Male], [- Married].

Supporters of this approach view the vowels and consonants recognised by speakers of a particular language or dialect at a particular time as cultural entities of little scientific interest. From a natural science standpoint, the units which matter are those common to ''Homo sapiens'' by virtue of our biological nature. By combining the atomic elements or "features" with which all humans are innately equipped, anyone may in principle generate the entire range of vowels and consonants to be found in any of the world's languages, whether past, present or future. The distinctive features are in this sense atomic components of a universal language.

====Criticism====
In recent years, the notion of an innate "universal grammar" underlying phonological variation has been called into question. The most comprehensive monograph ever written about speech sounds, ''Sounds of the World's Languages,'' by [[Peter Ladefoged]] and [[Ian Maddieson]],&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, P. and Maddieson, I. 1996. ''The Sounds of the World's Languages.'' Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; found virtually no basis for the postulation of some small number of fixed, discrete, universal phonetic features. Examining 305 languages, for example, they encountered vowels that were positioned basically everywhere along the articulatory and acoustic continuum. Ladefoged concludes that phonological features are not determined by human nature: "Phonological features are best regarded as artifacts that linguists have devised in order to describe linguistic systems."&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, P. 2006. Features and Parameters for Different Purposes. http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/ladefoge/PLfeaturesParameters.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy remains unresolved.

===Self-organization theory===
[[Image:Fugle, ørnsø 073.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Birds flocking, an example of [[Biological organisation|self-organization in biology]]]]

[[Self-organization]]  characterizes systems where macroscopic structures are spontaneously formed out of local interactions between the many components of the system.&lt;ref name="Oudeyer 2006"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Oudeyer | first1 = Pierre-Yves | title = Self-organization in the evolution of speech | date = 2006 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford University Press; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-928915-8 | oclc = 65203001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In self-organized systems, global organizational properties are not to be found at the local level. In colloquial terms, self-organisation is roughly captured by the idea of "bottom-up" (as opposed to "top-down") organisation. Examples of self-organized systems range from ice crystals to galaxy spirals in the inorganic world, and from spots on the leopard skins to the architecture of termite nests or shape of a flock of starlings.
[[Image:TermiteMound.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A termite mound (Macrotermitinae) in the Okavango Delta just outside [[Maun, Botswana|Maun]], [[Botswana]]]]

According to many phoneticians, the sounds of language arrange and re-arrange themselves through self-organization&lt;ref name="Oudeyer 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindblom, B., MacNeilage, P. and Studdert-Kennedy, M. 1984. Self-organizing processes and the explanation of language universals. In M. Butterworth, B. Comrie and Ö Dahl (eds), ''Explanations for language universals.'' Berlin: Walter de Gruyter and Co., pp. 181-203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Boer, B. 2005b. Self-organisation in language. In C. Hemelrijk (ed.), ''Self-organisation and evolution of social systems.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 123–139.&lt;/ref&gt; Speech sounds have both perceptual ("how you hear them") and articulatory ("how you produce them") properties, all with continuous values. Speakers tend to minimise effort, favouring ease of articulation over clarity. Listeners do the opposite, favouring sounds which are easy to distinguish even if difficult to pronounce. Since speakers and listeners are constantly switching roles, the syllable systems actually found in the world's languages turn out to be a compromise between acoustic distinctiveness on the one hand, and articulatory ease on the other.

How, precisely, do systems of vowels, consonants and syllables arise? Agent-based computer models take the perspective of self-organisation at the level of the speech community or population. The two main paradigms here are (1) the iterated learning model and (2) the language game model. Iterated learning focuses on transmission from generation to generation, typically with just one agent in each generation.&lt;ref name="Hurford 2000"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Hurford, J. R | first1 = J. R. |  title = Social transmission favours linguistic generalization.| editors = Chris Knight; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; James R Hurford|  work = The Evolutionary emergence of language : social function and the origins of linguistic form | year = 2000 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-78157-2 | oclc = 807262339 | pages = 324–352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the language game model, a whole population of agents simultaneously produce, perceive and learn language, inventing novel forms when the need arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steels | first1 = L | year = 1995 | title = A self-organizing spatial vocabulary | url = | journal = Artificial Life | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 319–332 | doi=10.1162/artl.1995.2.319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steels, L. and Vogt, P. 1997. Grounding adaptive language games in robotic agents. In P. Harvey and P. Husbands (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Artificial Life.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 474–482.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several models have shown how relatively simple peer-to-peer vocal interactions, such as imitation, can spontaneously self-organize a system of sounds shared by the whole population, and different in different populations. For example, models elaborated by Berrah et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Berrah A-R., Glotin H., Laboissière R., Bessière P., Boë L-J. 1996. From Form to Formation of Phonetic Structures: An Evolutionary Computing Pers- pective, in Proc. ICML 1996 Workshop on Evolutionary Computing and Machine Learning, pp. 23-29, Bari, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as de Boer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Boer | first1 = B | year = 2000 | title = Self-organization in vowel systems | url = | journal = Journal of Phonetics | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 441–465 | doi=10.1006/jpho.2000.0125}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recently reformulated using Bayesian theory,&lt;ref&gt;Moulin-Frier C., Laurent R., Bessière P., Schwartz J.-L., and Diard J. 2012 Adverse Conditions Improve Distinguishability of Auditory, Motor and Perceptuo- Motor Theories of Speech Perception: an Exploratory Bayesian Modeling Study. Language and Cognitive Processes, 27(7–8):1240–1263.&lt;/ref&gt; showed how a group of individuals playing imitation games can self-organize repertoires of vowel sounds which share substantial properties with human vowel systems. For example, in de Boer's model, initially vowels are generated randomly, but agents learn from each other as they interact repeatedly over time. Agent A chooses a vowel from its repertoire and produces it, inevitably with some noise. Agent B hears this vowel and chooses the closest equivalent from its own repertoire. To check whether this truly matches the original, B produces the vowel ''it thinks it has heard'', whereupon A refers once again to its own repertoire to find the closest equivalent. If this matches the one it initially selected, the game is successful, otherwise it has failed. "Through repeated interactions," according to de Boer, "vowel systems emerge that are very much like the ones found in human languages."&lt;ref&gt;de Boer, B. 2012. Self-organization and language evolution. In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), 2012. ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 612-620.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a different model, the phonetician [[Björn Lindblom]]&lt;ref&gt;Lindblom. B. 1986. Phonetic universals in vowel systems. In J. J. Ohala and J. J. Jaeger (eds.), ''Experimental Phonology.'' Orlando: Academic Press, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; was able to predict, on self-organizational grounds, the favoured choices of vowel systems ranging from three to nine vowels on the basis of a principle of optimal perceptual differentiation.

Further models studied the role of self-organization in the origins of phonemic coding and combinatoriality, that is the existence of phonemes and their systematic reuse to build structured syllables. [[Pierre-Yves Oudeyer]] developed models which showed that basic neural equipment for adaptive holistic vocal imitation, coupling directly motor and perceptual representations in the brain, can generate spontaneously shared combinatorial systems of vocalizations, including phonotactic patterns, in a society of babbling individuals.&lt;ref name="Oudeyer 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oudeyer P-Y. 2005. The Self-Organization of Speech Sounds, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 233(3), pp. 435–449.&lt;/ref&gt; These models also characterized how morphological and physiological innate constraints can interact with these self-organized mechanisms to account for both the formation of statistical regularities and diversity in vocalization systems.

===Gestural theory===
The gestural theory states that speech was a relatively late development, evolving by degrees from a system that was originally gestural.

Two types of evidence support this theory:
# Gestural language and vocal language depend on similar neural systems. The regions on the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] that are responsible for mouth and hand movements border each other.
# Nonhuman [[primates]] minimise vocal signals in favour of manual, facial and other visible gestures in order to express simple concepts and communicative intentions in the wild. Some of these gestures resemble those of humans, such as the "begging posture", with the hands stretched out, which humans share with chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;Premack, David &amp; Premack, Ann James. ''The Mind of an Ape'', {{ISBN|0-393-01581-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found strong support for the idea that spoken language and signing depend on similar neural structures. Patients who used sign language, and who suffered from a left-[[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] [[lesion]], showed the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients did with their oral language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neuromotor Mechanisms in Human Communication |author=Kimura, Doreen |year=1993 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-505492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers found that the same left-hemisphere brain regions were active during sign language as during the use of vocal or written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Critical Period for Right Hemisphere Recruitment in American Sign Language Processing |author=Newman, A. J.|year=2002 |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=5 |pages=76–80 |doi=10.1038/nn775 |pmid=11753419 |issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans spontaneously use hand and facial gestures when formulating ideas to be conveyed in speech.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, D. 1992. ''Hand and mind.'' Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, D. (ed.) 2000. ''Language and gesture.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also, of course, many [[sign languages]] in existence, commonly associated with [[deaf]] communities; as noted above, these are equal in complexity, sophistication, and expressive power, to any oral language. The main difference is that the "phonemes" are produced on the outside of the body, articulated with hands, body, and facial expression, rather than inside the body articulated with tongue, teeth, lips, and breathing.

====Criticism====

Critics note that for mammals in general, sound turns out to be the best medium in which to encode information for transmission over distances at speed. Given the probability that this applied also to early humans, it's hard to see why they should have abandoned this efficient method in favour of more costly and cumbersome systems of visual gesturing&amp;nbsp;— only to return to sound at a later stage.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, P. 1998. Evolution of the mechanism of language output: comparative neurobiology of vocal and manual communication. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C.

By way of explanation, it has been proposed that at a relatively late stage in human evolution, our ancestors' hands became so much in demand for making and using tools that the competing demands of manual gesturing became a hindrance. The transition to spoken language is said to have occurred only at that point.&lt;ref&gt;Corballis, M. C. 2002. Did language evolve from manual gestures? In A. Wray (ed.), ''The Transition to Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 161-179.&lt;/ref&gt; Since humans throughout evolution have been making and using tools, however, most scholars remain unconvinced by this argument. (For a different approach to this puzzle&amp;nbsp;— one setting out from considerations of signal reliability and trust&amp;nbsp;— see "from pantomime to speech" below).

==When did speech evolve?==
{{Human timeline}}
Little is known about the timing of language's emergence in  the human species. Unlike writing, speech leaves no material trace, making it archaeologically invisible. Lacking direct linguistic evidence, specialists in human origins have resorted to the study of anatomical features and genes arguably associated with speech production. While such studies may provide information as to whether pre-modern ''Homo'' species had speech ''capacities'', it is still unknown whether they actually spoke. While they may have communicated vocally, the anatomical and genetic data lack the resolution necessary to differentiate proto-language from speech.

Using statistical methods to estimate the time required to achieve the current spread and diversity in modern languages today, [[Johanna Nichols]]&amp;nbsp;— a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley&amp;nbsp;— argued in 1998 that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in our species at least 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Nichols, 1998. The origin and dispersal of languages: Linguistic evidence. In Nina Jablonski and Leslie C. Aiello, eds., ''The Origin and Diversification of Language,''  pp. 127-70. (Memoirs of the California Academy of Sciences, 24.) San Francisco: California Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently&amp;nbsp;— in 2012&amp;nbsp;— anthropologists Charles Perreault and Sarah Mathew used phonemic diversity to suggest a date consistent with this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perreault | first1 = C. | last2 = Mathew | first2 = S. | year = 2012 | title = Dating the origin of language using phonemic diversity | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4| page = e35289 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Phonemic diversity" denotes the number of perceptually distinct units of sound&amp;nbsp;— consonants, vowels and tones&amp;nbsp;— in a language. The current worldwide pattern of phonemic diversity potentially contains the statistical signal of the expansion of modern ''Homo sapiens'' out of Africa, beginning around 60-70 thousand years ago. Some scholars argue that phonemic diversity evolves slowly and can be used as a clock to calculate how long the oldest African languages would have to have been around in order to accumulate the number of phonemes they possess today. As human populations left Africa and expanded into the rest of the world, they underwent a series of bottlenecks&amp;nbsp;— points at which only a very small population survived to colonise a new continent or region. Allegedly such population crash led to a corresponding reduction in genetic, phenotypic and phonemic diversity. [[African languages]] today have some of the largest phonemic inventories in the world, while the smallest inventories are found in South America and Oceania, some of the last regions of the globe to be colonized. For example, [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]], a language of New Guinea, and [[Pirahã language|Pirahã]], spoken in South America, both have just 11 phonemes,&lt;ref&gt;Maddieson, I. 1984. ''Patterns of Sounds.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maddieson | first1 = I. | last2 = Precoda | first2 = K. | year = 1990 | title = Updating UPSID | url = | journal = UCLA Working Papers in Phonetics | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 104–111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while !Xun, a language spoken in Southern Africa has 141 phonemes.
The authors use a natural experiment&amp;nbsp;— the colonization of mainland Southeast Asia on the one hand, the long-isolated [[Andaman Islands]] on the other&amp;nbsp;— to estimate the rate at which phonemic diversity increases through time. Using this rate, they estimate that the world's languages date back to the [[Middle Stone Age]] in Africa, sometime between 350 thousand and 150 thousand years ago. This corresponds to the speciation event which gave rise to ''Homo sapiens''.

These and similar studies have however been criticized by linguists who argue that they are based on a flawed analogy between genes and phonemes, since phonemes are frequently transferred laterally between languages unlike genes, and on a flawed sampling of the world's languages, since both Oceania and the Americas also contain languages with very high numbers of phonemes, and Africa contains languages with very few. They argue that the actual distribution of phonemic diversity in the world reflects recent language contact and not deep language history - since it is well demonstrated that languages can lose or gain many phonemes over very short periods. In other words, there is no valid linguistic reason to expect genetic founder effects to influence phonemic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hunley, Claire Bowern, and Meghan Healy ("Rejection of a serial founder effects model of genetic and linguistic coevolution", Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 2/1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowern, Claire. 2011 Out of Africa?

==Speculative scenarios==

===Early speculations===
{{quotation|"I cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man's own instinctive cries."|{{Citation|title=''Charles Darwin, 1871.'' The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex.}}&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. (1871). The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, 2 vols. London: Murray, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}In 1861, historical linguist Max Müller published a list of speculative theories concerning the origins of spoken language:&lt;ref&gt;Müller, F. M. 1996 [1861]. The theoretical stage, and the origin of language. Lecture 9 from Lectures on the Science of Language. Reprinted in R. Harris (ed.), ''The Origin of Language.'' Bristol: Thoemmes Press, pp. 7-41.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bow-wow'''. The ''[[Bow-wow theory|bow-wow]]'' or ''cuckoo'' theory, which Müller attributed to the German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], saw early words as imitations of the cries of beasts and birds.
* '''Pooh-pooh'''. The ''Pooh-Pooh'' theory saw the [[Interjectional theory|first words as emotional interjections and exclamations]] triggered by pain, pleasure, surprise and so on.
* '''Ding-dong'''. Müller suggested what he called the ''Ding-Dong'' theory, which states that all things have a vibrating natural resonance, echoed somehow by man in his earliest words.
* '''Yo-he-ho'''. The ''yo-he-ho'' theory saw language emerging out of collective rhythmic labour, the attempt to synchronise muscular effort resulting in sounds such as ''heave'' alternating with sounds such as ''ho''.
* '''Ta-ta'''. This did not feature in Max Müller's list, having been proposed in 1930 by [[Sir Richard Paget, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Paget]].&lt;ref&gt;Paget, R. 1930. ''Human speech: some observations, experiments, and conclusions as to the nature, origin, purpose and possible improvement of human speech.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''ta-ta'' theory, humans made the earliest words by tongue movements that mimicked manual gestures, rendering them audible.

Most scholars today consider all such theories not so much wrong&amp;nbsp;— they occasionally offer peripheral insights&amp;nbsp;— as comically naïve and irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Firth, J. R. 1964. ''The Tongues of Men and Speech.'' London: Oxford University Press, pp. 25-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stam, J. H. 1976. ''Inquiries into the origins of language.'' New York: Harper and Row, p. 243-44.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with these theories is that they are so narrowly mechanistic. They assume that once our ancestors had stumbled upon the appropriate ingenious ''mechanism'' for linking sounds with meanings, language automatically evolved and changed.

===Problems of reliability and deception===
From the perspective of modern science, the main obstacle to the evolution of speech-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one. Rather, it is that symbols&amp;nbsp;— arbitrary associations of sounds with corresponding meanings&amp;nbsp;— are unreliable and may well be false.&lt;ref name="Zahavi, A 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A | year = 1993 | title = The fallacy of conventional signalling | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 340 | issue = | pages = 227–230 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1993.0061}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the saying goes, "words are cheap".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = J | year = 1994 | title = Must reliable signals always be costly? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 1115–1120 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1994.1149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of reliability was not recognised at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionist theorists.

Animal vocal signals are for the most part intrinsically reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal's contented state. One can "trust" the signal not because the cat is inclined to be honest, but because it just can't fake that sound. Primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable,&lt;ref&gt;Slocombe, K. 2012. Have we underestimated great ape vocal capacities? In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 90-95.&lt;/ref&gt; but they remain reliable for the same reason&amp;nbsp;— because they are hard to fake.&lt;ref name="Goodall 1986" /&gt; Primate social intelligence is ''Machiavellian''&amp;nbsp;— self-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples. Monkeys and apes often attempt to deceive one another, while at the same time constantly on guard against falling victim to deception themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R. and A. Whiten (eds) 1988. ''Machiavellian Intelligence. Social expertise and the evolution of intellect in monkeys, apes, and humans.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, it is precisely primates' resistance to deception that blocks the evolution of their vocal communication systems along language-like lines. Language is ruled out because the best way to guard against being deceived is to ignore all signals except those that are instantly verifiable. Words automatically fail this test.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998" /&gt;

Words are easy to fake. Should they turn out to be lies, listeners will adapt by ignoring them in favour of hard-to-fake indices or cues. For language to work, then, listeners must be confident that those with whom they are on speaking terms are generally likely to be honest.&lt;ref name="Power 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 =  Power| first1 =  Camilla|title = Old wives' tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 | pages = 111–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; A peculiar feature of language is "displaced reference", which means reference to topics outside the currently perceptible situation. This property prevents utterances from being corroborated in the immediate "here" and "now". For this reason, language presupposes relatively high levels of mutual trust in order to become established over time as an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. A theory of the origins of language must therefore explain why humans could begin trusting cheap signals in ways that other animals apparently cannot (see [[signalling theory]]).

==== "Kin selection" ====
The "mother tongues" hypothesis was proposed in 2004 as a possible solution to this problem.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2004"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fitch| first1 = W. T.| title = Kin selection and "mother tongues" : a neglected component in language evolution | editors =  Ulrike Griebel; D Kimbrough Oller | work = Evolution of communication systems : a comparative approach | year = 2004 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-262-15111-5 |oclc = 845673575| pages = 275–296 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]] suggested that the Darwinian principle of "kin selection"&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1964a"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = WD. | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I. | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–16 |date=Jul 1964 | doi =  10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4| PMID = 5875341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1964b"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = WD. | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour.

Fitch suggests that spoken languages were originally "mother tongues". If speech evolved initially for communication between mothers and their own biological offspring, extending later to include adult relatives as well, the interests of speakers and listeners would have tended to coincide. Fitch argues that shared genetic interests would have led to sufficient trust and cooperation for intrinsically unreliable vocal signals&amp;nbsp;— spoken words&amp;nbsp;— to become accepted as trustworthy and so begin evolving for the first time.

=====Criticism=====
Critics of this theory point out that kin selection is not unique to humans. Ape mothers also share genes with their offspring, as do all animals, so why is it only humans who speak? Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that early humans restricted linguistic communication to genetic kin: the incest taboo must have forced men and women to interact and communicate with non-kin. So even if we accept Fitch's initial premises, the extension of the posited "mother tongue" networks from relatives to non-relatives remains unexplained.&lt;ref&gt;Tallerman, M. In press. Kin selection, pedagogy and linguistic complexity: whence protolanguage. In R. Botha and M. Everaert (eds), ''The Evolutionary Emergence of Human Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Reciprocal altruism" ====
Ib Ulbæk&lt;ref name="Ulbæk 1998"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Ulbæk | first1 = Ib | title = The origin of language and cognition|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | pages = 30–43 | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; invokes another standard Darwinian principle&amp;nbsp;— "reciprocal altruism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R. L. | year = 1971 | title = The evolution of reciprocal altruism | url = | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 35–57 | doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— to explain the unusually high levels of intentional honesty necessary for language to evolve. 'Reciprocal altruism' can be expressed as the principle that ''if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.'' In linguistic terms, it would mean that ''if you speak truthfully to me, I'll speak truthfully to you.'' Ordinary Darwinian reciprocal altruism, Ulbæk points out, is a relationship established between frequently interacting individuals. For language to prevail across an entire community, however, the necessary reciprocity would have needed to be enforced universally instead of being left to individual choice. Ulbæk concludes that for language to evolve, early society as a whole must have been subject to moral regulation.

=====Criticism=====
Critics point out that this theory fails to explain when, how, why or by whom "obligatory reciprocal altruism" could possibly have been enforced. Various proposals have been offered to remedy this defect.&lt;ref name="Knight 2007"&gt;{{Cite book  |last1=Knight|first1=Chris| title=Language co-evolved with the rule of law| editors = Angelo Cangelosi; Andrew D M Smith; Kenny Smith | work = The evolution of language : proceedings of the 6th international conference (EVOLANG6) , Rome, Italy, 12–15 April 200 | year = 2006 | publisher = World Scientific | location = New Jersey | isbn = 9789812566560 | oclc = 70797781| doi=10.1007/s11299-007-0039-1|url = http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/knight-springer-online-fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further criticism is that language doesn't work on the basis of reciprocal altruism anyway. Humans in conversational groups don't withhold information to all except listeners likely to offer valuable information in return. On the contrary, they seem to want to advertise to the world their access to socially relevant information, broadcasting it to anyone who will listen without thought of return.&lt;ref&gt;Dessalles, J.-L. 1998.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 130-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Gossip and grooming" ====
Gossip, according to [[Robin Dunbar]], does for group-living humans what manual [[Social grooming|grooming]] does for other primates&amp;nbsp;— it allows individuals to service their relationships and so maintain their alliances. As humans began living in larger and larger social groups, the task of manually grooming all one's friends and acquaintances became so time-consuming as to be unaffordable. In response to this problem, humans invented "a cheap and ultra-efficient form of grooming"&amp;nbsp;— ''vocal grooming''.  To keep your allies happy, you now needed only to "groom" them with low-cost vocal sounds, servicing multiple allies simultaneously while keeping both hands free for other tasks. Vocal grooming (the production of pleasing sounds lacking syntax or combinatorial semantics) then evolved somehow into syntactical speech.&lt;ref name="Dunbar 1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dunbar | first = R. I. M. | title = Grooming, gossip and the evolution of language | publisher = Faber and Faber | location = London | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780571173969 |oclc = 34546743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Criticism=====
Critics of this theory point out that the very efficiency of "vocal grooming"&amp;nbsp;— that words are so cheap&amp;nbsp;— would have undermined its capacity to signal commitment of the kind conveyed by time-consuming and costly manual grooming.&lt;ref name="Power 1998" /&gt; A further criticism is that the theory does nothing to explain the crucial transition from vocal grooming&amp;nbsp;— the production of pleasing but meaningless sounds&amp;nbsp;— to the cognitive complexities of syntactical speech.

====From pantomime to speech====
According to another school of thought, language evolved from [[mimesis]]&amp;nbsp;— the "acting out" of scenarios using vocal and gestural pantomime.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, M. 1998. Mimesis and the Executive Suite: missing links in language evolution. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C.

London &amp; Melbourne: Dent, pp. 179-309.&lt;/ref&gt; were necessary in order to inspire community-wide trust in communicative intentions, it would follow that these had to be in place before humans could shift at last to an ultra-efficient, high-speed&amp;nbsp;— digital as opposed to analog&amp;nbsp;— signalling format. Vocal [[distinctive features]] (sound contrasts) are ideal for this purpose. It is therefore suggested that the establishment of contractual understandings enabled the decisive transition from mimetic gesture to fully conventionalised, digitally encoded speech.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Knight| first1 =  Chris| title = Ritual/speech coevolution: a solution to the problem of deception| editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 | pages = 68–91 | url=http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/knight_ritual_speech_coevolution.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knight 2000"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Knight | first1 = Chris |  title = Play as precursor of phonology and syntax| editors = Chris Knight; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; James R Hurford|  work = The Evolutionary emergence of language : social function and the origins of linguistic form | year = 2000 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-78157-2 | oclc = 807262339 | pages = 99–119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knight 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knight | first1 = C. | year = 2008 | title = "Honest fakes" and language origins | url = http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/JCS_Knight_CRC.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 15 | issue = 10–11| pages = 236–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Ritual/speech coevolution" ====
The ritual/speech coevolution theory was originally proposed by the distinguished social anthropologist [[Roy Rappaport]]&lt;ref name="Rappaport,_R._A._1999"&gt;Rappaport, R. A. 1999. ''Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; before being elaborated by anthropologists such as Chris Knight,&lt;ref name="Knight 1998" /&gt; Jerome Lewis,&lt;ref name="Lewis 2009" /&gt; Nick Enfield,&lt;ref name="Enfield 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Enfield | first1 = N.

These scholars argue that there can be no such thing as a "theory of the origins of language". This is because language is not a separate adaptation but an internal aspect of something much wider&amp;nbsp;— namely, human [[symbolic culture]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 2010. [http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/The-Origins-of-Symbolic-Culture.pdf The origins of symbolic culture.] In Ulrich J. Frey, Charlotte Störmer and Kai P. Willfuhr (eds) 2010. ''Homo Novus&amp;nbsp;— A Human Without Illusions.'' Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag, pp. 193-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to explain language independently of this wider context have spectacularly failed, say these scientists, because they are addressing a problem with no solution. Can we imagine a historian attempting to explain the emergence of credit cards independently of the wider system of which they are a part? Using a credit card makes sense only if you have a bank account institutionally recognised within a certain kind of advanced capitalist society&amp;nbsp;— one where communications technology has already been invented and fraud can be detected and prevented. In much the same way, language would not work outside a specific array of social mechanisms and institutions. For example, it would not work for an ape communicating with other apes in the wild. Not even the cleverest ape could make language work under such conditions.

{{quotation|"Lie and alternative, inherent in language, ... pose problems to any society whose structure is founded on language, which is to say all human societies. I have therefore argued that if there are to be words at all it is necessary to establish ''The Word,'' and that The Word is established by the invariance of liturgy."&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, R. A. 1979. ''Ecology, Meaning, and Religion.'' Berkeley, California: North Atlantic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Advocates of this school of thought point out that words are cheap. As digital hallucinations, they are intrinsically unreliable. Should an especially clever ape, or even a group of articulate apes, try to use words in the wild, they would carry no conviction. The primate vocalisations that ''do'' carry conviction&amp;nbsp;— those they actually use&amp;nbsp;— are unlike words, in that they are emotionally expressive, intrinsically meaningful and reliable because they are relatively costly and hard to fake.

Speech consists of digital contrasts whose cost is essentially zero. As pure social conventions, signals of this kind cannot evolve in a Darwinian social world&amp;nbsp;— they are a theoretical impossibility.&lt;ref name="Zahavi, A 1993" /&gt; Being intrinsically unreliable, language works only if you can build up a reputation for trustworthiness within a certain kind of society&amp;nbsp;— namely, one where symbolic cultural facts (sometimes called "institutional facts") can be established and maintained through collective social endorsement.&lt;ref name="Searle 1995"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Searle | first1 = John R. | title = The construction of social reality | year = 1995 | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-02-928045-4 | oclc = 31411549 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In any [[hunter-gatherer]] society, the basic mechanism for establishing trust in symbolic cultural facts is collective ''ritual''.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1947 [1915].

=====Criticism=====
Critics of the theory include [[Noam Chomsky]], who terms it the "non-existence" hypothesis&amp;nbsp;— a denial of the very existence of language as an object of study for natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky (2011): [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15475441.2011.584041 Language and Other Cognitive Systems. What Is Special About Language?], Language Learning and Development, 7:4, 263-278&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky's own theory is that language emerged in an instant and in perfect form,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chomsky | first1 = N | year = 2005 | title = Three factors in language design | url = | journal = Linguistic Inquiry | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 1–22 | doi=10.1162/0024389052993655}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting his critics in turn to retort that only something that doesn't exist&amp;nbsp;— a theoretical construct or convenient scientific fiction&amp;nbsp;— could possibly emerge in such a miraculous way.&lt;ref name="Knight 2008" /&gt; The controversy remains unresolved.

===Twentieth century speculations===

====Festal origins====
The essay "The festal origin of human speech", though published in the late nineteenth century,&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;Donovan, J. 1891-92. The festal origin of human speech, part I. ''Mind'' '''16'''(64), pp. 495-506.&lt;/ref&gt; made little impact until the American philosopher [[Susanne Langer]] re-discovered and publicised it in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, S. 1957 [1941]. ''Philosophy in a New Key.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|"In the early history of articulate sounds they could make no meaning themselves, but they preserved and got intimately associated with the peculiar feelings and perceptions that came most prominently into the minds of the festal players during their excitement."|{{Citation|title=''J. Donovan, 1891.'' The Festal Origin of Human Speech.}}&lt;ref name="Donovan" /&gt;}}
The theory sets out from the observation that primate vocal sounds are above all ''emotionally'' expressive. The emotions aroused are socially contagious. Because of this, an extended bout of screams, hoots or barks will tend to express not just the feelings of this or that individual but the mutually contagious ups and downs of everyone within earshot.

Turning to the ancestors of ''Homo sapiens'', the "festal origin" theory suggests that in the "play-excitement" preceding or following a communal hunt or other group activity, everyone might have combined their voices in a comparable way, emphasising their mood of togetherness with such noises as rhythmic drumming and hand-clapping. Variably pitched voices would have formed conventional patterns, such that choral singing became an integral part of communal celebration.

Although this was not yet speech, according to Langer, it developed the vocal capacities from which speech would later derive. There would be conventional modes of ululating, clapping or dancing appropriate to different festive occasions, each so intimately associated with ''that kind of occasion'' that it would tend to collectively uphold and embody the concept of it. Anyone hearing a snatch of sound from such a song would recall the associated occasion and mood. A melodic, rhythmic sequence of syllables conventionally associated with a certain type of celebration would become, in effect, its vocal mark. On that basis, certain familiar sound sequences would become "symbolic".

In support of all this, Langer cites ethnographic reports of tribal songs consisting entirely of "rhythmic nonsense syllables". She concedes that an English equivalent such as "hey-nonny-nonny", although perhaps suggestive of certain feelings or ideas, is neither noun, verb, adjective, nor any other syntactical part of speech. So long as articulate sound served only in the capacity of "hey nonny-nonny", "hallelujah" or "alack-a-day", it cannot yet have been speech. For that to arise, according to Langer, it was necessary for such sequences to be emitted increasingly ''out of context''&amp;nbsp;— outside the total situation that gave rise to them. Extending a set of associations from one cognitive context to another, completely different one, is the secret of ''metaphor''. Langer invokes an early version of what is nowadays termed "grammaticalisation" theory to show how, from, such a point of departure, syntactically complex speech might progressively have arisen.

Langer acknowledges [[Emile Durkheim]] as having proposed a strikingly similar theory back in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1976 [1912]. ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life.''

===="Musilanguage"====
The term "musilanguage" (or "hmmmmm") refers to a pre-linguistic system of vocal communication from which (according to some scholars) ''both'' music ''and'' language later derived. The idea is that rhythmic, melodic, emotionally expressive vocal ritual helped bond coalitions and, over time, set up selection pressures for enhanced volitional control over the speech articulators. Patterns of synchronised choral chanting are imagined to have varied according to the occasion. For example, "we're setting off to find honey" might sound qualitatively different from "we're setting off to hunt" or "we're grieving over our relative's death". If social standing depended on maintaining a regular beat and harmonising one's own voice with that of everyone else, group members would have come under pressure to demonstrate their choral skills.

Archaeologist [[Steven Mithen]] speculates that the Neanderthals possessed some such system, expressing themselves in a "language" known as "Hmmmmm", standing for '''H'''olistic, '''m'''anipulative, '''m'''ulti-'''m'''odal, '''m'''usical and '''m'''imetic.&lt;ref name="Mithen 2006" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;169-175&lt;/sup&gt; In Bruce Richman's earlier version of essentially the same idea,&lt;ref name="Richman 2000" /&gt; frequent repetition of the same few songs by many voices made it easy for people to remember those sequences as whole units. Activities that a group of people were doing while they were vocalising together&amp;nbsp;— activities that were important or striking or richly emotional&amp;nbsp;— came to be associated with particular sound sequences, so that each time a fragment was heard, it evoked highly specific memories. The idea is that the earliest lexical items (words) started out as abbreviated fragments of what were originally communal songs.

{{quotation|"Whenever people sang or chanted a particular sound sequence they would remember the concrete particulars of the situation most strongly associated with it: ah, yes! we sing this during this particular ritual admitting new members to the group; or, we chant this during a long journey in the forest; or, when a clearing is finished for a new camp, this is what we chant; or these are the keenings we sing during ceremonies over dead members of our group."|{{Citation|title=''Richman, B. 2000. How music fixed "nonsense" into significant formulas: on rhythm, repetition, and meaning. In N. L. Wallin, B. Merker and S. Brown (eds), ''The Origins of Music: An introduction to evolutionary musicology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, pp. 301-314.}}}}

As group members accumulated an expanding repertoire of songs for different occasions, interpersonal call-and-response patterns evolved along one trajectory to assume linguistic form. Meanwhile, along a divergent trajectory, polyphonic singing and other kinds of music became increasingly specialised and sophisticated.

To explain the establishment of syntactical speech, Richman cites English "I wanna go home". He imagines this to have been learned in the first instance not as a combinatorial sequence of free-standing words, but as a single stuck-together combination&amp;nbsp;— the melodic sound people make to express "feeling homesick". Someone might sing "I wanna go home", prompting other voices to chime in with "I need to go home", "I'd love to go home", "Let's go home" and so forth. Note that one part of the song remains constant, while another is permitted to vary. If this theory is accepted, syntactically complex speech began evolving as each chanted mantra allowed for variation at a certain point, allowing for the insertion of an element from some other song. For example, while mourning during a funeral rite, someone might want to recall a memory of collecting honey with the deceased, signalling this at an appropriate moment with a fragment of the "we're collecting honey" song.  Imagine that such practices became common. Meaning-laden utterances would now have become subject to a distinctively linguistic creative principle&amp;nbsp;— that of recursive embedding.

====Hunter-gatherer egalitarianism====
[[File:Mbendjele meat sharing.jpg|thumb|Mbendjele hunter-gatherer meat sharing]]
Many scholars associate the evolutionary emergence of speech with profound social, sexual, political and cultural developments. One view is that primate-style dominance needed to give way to a more cooperative and egalitarian lifestyle of the kind characteristic of modern hunter-gatherers.&lt;ref name="Whiten, A 1999. pp. 173-193"&gt;Whiten, A. 1999. The evolution of deep social mind in humans. In M. Corballis and S. E. G. Lea (eds), ''The Descent of Mind. Psychological perspectives on hominid evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 173-193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. and C. Power (2011). Social conditions for the evolutionary emergence of language. In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), ''Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 346-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"/&gt;

=====Intersubjectivity=====
According to [[Michael Tomasello]], the key cognitive capacity distinguishing ''Homo sapiens'' from our ape cousins is "[[intersubjectivity]]". This entails [[turn-taking]] and role-reversal: your partner strives to read your mind, you simultaneously strive to read theirs, and each of you makes a conscious effort to assist the other in the process. The outcome is that each partner forms a representation of the other's mind in which their own can be discerned by reflection.

Tomasello argues that this kind of bi-directional cognition is central to the very possibility of linguistic communication. Drawing on his research with both children and chimpanzees, he reports that human infants, from one year old onwards, begin viewing their own mind as if from the standpoint of others. He describes this as a cognitive revolution. Chimpanzees, as they grow up, never undergo such a revolution. The explanation, according to Tomasello, is that their evolved psychology is adapted to a deeply competitive way of life. Wild-living chimpanzees form despotic social hierarchies, most interactions involving calculations of dominance and submission. An adult chimp will strive to outwit its rivals by guessing at their intentions while blocking them from reciprocating. Since bi-directional intersubjective communication is impossible under such conditions, the cognitive capacities necessary for language don't evolve.&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 1999"&gt;Tomasello, M. 1999. ''The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, M. 2006, Why don't apes point? In N. J. Enfield &amp; S. C. Levinson (eds), ''Roots of Human Sociality: Culture, cognition and interaction.'' Oxford &amp; New York: Berg, pp. 506-524.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 2008"&gt;Tomasello, M. 2008. ''Origins of Human Communication.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Counter-dominance=====
In the scenario favoured by David Erdal and Andrew Whiten,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erdal | first1 = D. | last2 = Whiten | first2 = A. | year = 1994 | title = On human egalitarianism: an evolutionary product of Machiavellian status escalation? | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 175–183 | doi=10.1086/204255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erdal, D. and A. Whiten 1996. Egalitarianism and Machiavellian intelligence in human evolution. In P. Mellars and K. Gibson (eds), ''Modelling the Early Human Mind.'' Cambridge: McDonald Institute Monographs, pp. 139-150.&lt;/ref&gt; primate-style dominance provoked equal and opposite coalitionary resistance&amp;nbsp;— ''counter-dominance.'' During the course of human evolution, increasingly effective strategies of rebellion against dominant individuals led to a compromise. While abandoning any attempt to dominate others, group members vigorously asserted their personal autonomy, maintaining their alliances to make potentially dominant individuals think twice. Within increasingly stable coalitions, according to this perspective, status began to be earned in novel ways, social rewards accruing to those perceived by their peers as especially cooperative and self-aware.&lt;ref name="Whiten, A 1999. pp. 173-193" /&gt;

=====Reverse dominance=====
While counter-dominance, according to this evolutionary narrative, culminates in a stalemate, anthropologist Christopher Boehm&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 1997. Egalitarian behaviour and the evolution of political intelligence. In A. Whiten and R. W. Byrne (eds), ''Machiavellian Intelligence II: Extensions and evaluations.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 341-364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 2001. ''Hierarchy in the Forest. The evolution of egalitarian behavior.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; extends the logic a step further. Counter-dominance tips over at last into full-scale "reverse dominance". The rebellious coalition decisively overthrows the figure of the primate alpha-male. No dominance is allowed except that of the self-organised community as a whole.

As a result of this social and political change, hunter-gatherer egalitarianism is established. As children grow up, they are motivated by those around them to reverse perspective, engaging with other minds on the model of their own. Selection pressures favour such psychological innovations as imaginative empathy, joint attention, moral judgment, project-oriented collaboration and the ability to evaluate one's own behaviour from the standpoint of others. Underpinning enhanced probabilities of cultural transmission and cumulative cultural evolution, these developments culminate in the establishment of hunter-gatherer-style egalitarianism in association with intersubjective communication and cognition. It is in this social and political context that language evolves.&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"/&gt;

====Scenarios involving mother-infant interactions====

====="Putting the baby down"=====
According to Dean Falk's "putting the baby down" theory, vocal interactions between early hominin mothers and infants sparked a sequence of events that led, eventually, to our ancestors' earliest words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Falk | first1 = D | year = 2004 | title = Prelinguistic evolution in early Hominins: Whence motherese? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 491–503 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x04000111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea is that evolving human mothers, unlike their monkey and ape counterparts, couldn't move around and forage with their infants clinging onto their backs. Loss of fur in the human case left infants with no means of clinging on. Frequently, therefore, mothers had to put their babies down. As a result, these babies needed reassurance that they were not being abandoned. Mothers responded by developing "motherese"&amp;nbsp;— an infant-directed communicative system embracing facial expressions, body language, touching, patting, caressing, laughter, tickling and emotionally expressive contact calls. The argument is that language somehow developed out of all this.

;Criticism
While this theory may explain a certain kind of infant-directed "protolanguage"&amp;nbsp;— known today as "motherese"&amp;nbsp;— it does little to solve the really difficult problem, which is the emergence among adults of syntactical speech. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=====Co-operative breeding=====
Evolutionary anthropologist Sarah Hrdy&lt;ref name="Hrdy 2009"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Hrdy | first1 = Sarah Blaffer | title = Mothers and others : the evolutionary origins of mutual understanding | year = 2009 | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-674-03299-6 | oclc = 261174072 }}&lt;/ref&gt; observes that only human mothers among great apes are willing to let another individual take hold of their own babies; further, we are routinely willing to let others babysit. She identifies lack of trust as the major factor preventing chimp, bonobo or gorilla mothers from doing the same: "If ape mothers insist on carrying their babies everywhere&amp;nbsp;... it is because the available alternatives are not safe enough." The fundamental problem is that ape mothers (unlike monkey mothers who may often babysit) do not have female relatives nearby. The strong implication is that, in the course of ''Homo'' evolution, allocare could develop because ''Homo'' mothers did have female kin close by&amp;nbsp;— in the first place, most reliably, their own mothers. Extending the [[Grandmother hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="Hawkes 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hawkes | first1 = K. | last2 = O'Connell | first2 = JF. | last3 = Jones | first3 = NG. | last4 = Alvarez | first4 = H. | last5 = Charnov | first5 = EL. | title = Grandmothering, menopause, and the evolution of human life histories. | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 1336–9 |date=Feb 1998 | pmc = 18762 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/95/3/1336.full | PMID = 9448332 | doi=10.1073/pnas.95.3.1336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hrdy argues that evolving ''[[Homo erectus]]'' females necessarily relied on female kin initially; this novel situation in ape evolution of mother, infant and mother's mother as allocarer provided the evolutionary ground for the emergence of intersubjectivity. She relates this onset of "cooperative breeding in an ape" to shifts in life history and slower child development, linked to the change in brain and body size from the 2 million year mark.

Primatologist Klaus Zuberbühler&lt;ref&gt;Zuberbühler, K. 2012. Cooperative breeding and the evolution of vocal flexibility. In Tallerman, M. and K. Gibson (eds), ''The Oxford Handbook of Human Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 71-81.&lt;/ref&gt; uses these ideas to help explain the emergence of vocal flexibility in the human species. Co-operative breeding would have compelled infants to struggle actively to gain the attention of caregivers, not all of whom would have been directly related. A basic primate repertoire of vocal signals may have been insufficient for this social challenge. Natural selection, according to this view, would have favoured babies with advanced vocal skills, beginning with babbling (which triggers positive responses in care-givers) and paving the way for the elaborate and unique speech abilities of modern humans.

=====Was "mama" the first word?=====
These ideas might be linked to those of the renowned structural linguist Roman Jakobson, who claimed that "the sucking activities of the child are accompanied by a slight nasal murmur, the only phonation to be produced when the lips are pressed to the mother's breast&amp;nbsp;... and the mouth is full".&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. 1960. "Why 'Mama' and 'Papa'". In B. Caplan and S. Wagner (eds), ''Essays in Honor of Heinz Werner.'' New York: International Universities Press, pp. 124-134; p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that later in the infant's development, "this phonatory reaction to nursing is reproduced as an anticipatory signal at the mere sight of food and finally as a manifestation of a desire to eat, or more generally, as an expression of discontent and impatient longing for missing food or absent nurser, and any ungranted wish." So, the action of opening and shutting the mouth, combined with the production of a nasal sound when the lips are closed, yielded the sound sequence "Mama", which may therefore count as the very first word. Peter MacNeilage sympathetically discusses this theory in his major book, The ''Origin of Speech'', linking it with Dean Falk's "putting the baby down" theory (see above).&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, P. 2008. ''The Origin of Speech.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 144-154.&lt;/ref&gt; Needless to say, other scholars have suggested completely different candidates for ''Homo sapiens''' very first word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Kenneally | first1 = Christine. | title = The first word : the search for the origins of language | year = 2007 | publisher = Viking | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-670-03490-1 | oclc = 80460757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Niche construction theory====
[[File:Beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego. Beavers adapt to an environmental niche which they shape by their own activities.]]While the biological language faculty is genetically inherited, actual languages or dialects are culturally transmitted, as are social norms, technological traditions and so forth.

''Not by Genes Alone: How culture transformed human evolution.'' Chicago: Chicago University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals capable of rudimentary forms of protolanguage would have enjoyed enhanced access to cultural understandings, while these, conveyed in ways that young brains could readily learn, would in turn have become transmitted with increasing efficiency.

In some ways like beavers as they construct their dams, humans have always engaged in [[niche construction]], creating novel environments to which they subsequently become adapted. Selection pressures associated with prior niches tend to become relaxed as humans depend increasingly on novel environments created continuously by their own productive activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laland | first1 = K.

==Conceptual frameworks==

===Structuralism===
{{quotation|"Consider a knight in chess. Is the piece by itself an element of the game? Certainly not. For as a material object, separated from its square on the board and the other conditions of play, it is of no significance for the player. It becomes a real, concrete element only when it takes on or becomes identified with its value in the game. Suppose that during a game this piece gets destroyed or lost. Can it be replaced? Of course it can. Not only by some other knight, but even by an object of quite a different shape, which can be counted as a knight, provided it is assigned the same value as the missing piece."|{{Citation|title=Saussure, F. de 1983 [1916]. ''Course in General Linguistics.'' Translated by R. Harris. London: Duckworth, pp. 108-09.}}}}  The Swiss scholar [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] founded linguistics as a twentieth-century professional discipline. Saussure regarded a language as a rule-governed system, much like a board game such as chess. In order to understand chess, he insisted, we must ignore such external factors as the weather prevailing during a particular session or the material composition of this or that piece. The game is autonomous with respect to its material embodiments. In the same way, when studying language, it's essential to focus on its internal structure as a social institution. External matters (''e.g.'', the shape of the human tongue) are irrelevant from this standpoint. Saussure regarded 'speaking' ''(parole)'' as individual, ancillary and more or less accidental by comparison with "language" ''(langue)'', which he viewed as collective, systematic and essential.

Saussure showed little interest in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Nor did he consider it worthwhile to speculate about how language might originally have evolved. Saussure's assumptions in fact cast doubt on the validity of narrowly conceived origins scenarios. His structuralist paradigm, when accepted in its original form, turns scholarly attention to a wider problem: how our species acquired the capacity to establish [[social institutions]] in general.

===Behaviourism===
{{Main|Behaviourism}}
{{quotation|"The basic processes and relations which give verbal behaviour its special characteristics are now fairly well understood. Much of the experimental work responsible for this advance has been carried out on other species, but the results have proved to be surprisingly free of species restrictions. Recent work has shown that the methods can be extended to human behaviour without serious modification."|{{Citation|title=Skinner, B.F. 1957. ''Verbal Behavior.'' New York: Appleton Century Crofts, p. 3.}}}} In the United States, prior to and immediately following World War II, the dominant psychological paradigm was [[behaviourism]]. Within this conceptual framework, language was seen as a certain kind of behaviour&amp;nbsp;— namely, verbal behaviour,&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. 1957. ''Verbal Behavior.'' New York: Appleton Century Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt; to be studied much like any other kind of behaviour in the animal world. Rather as a laboratory rat learns how to find its way through an artificial maze, so a human child learns the verbal behaviour of the society into which it is born. The phonological, grammatical and other complexities of speech are in this sense "external" phenomena, inscribed into an initially unstructured brain. Language's emergence in ''Homo sapiens,'' from this perspective, presents no special theoretical challenge. Human behaviour, whether verbal or otherwise, illustrates the malleable nature of the mammalian&amp;nbsp;— and especially the human&amp;nbsp;— brain.

''On Nature and Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 45-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviourists tended to view the child's brain as a ''tabula rasa'', initially lacking structure or cognitive content. According to B. F. Skinner, for example, richness of behavioural detail (whether verbal or non-verbal) emanated from the environment. Chomsky turned this idea on its head. The linguistic environment encountered by a young child, according to Chomsky's version of [[psychological nativism]], is in fact hopelessly inadequate. No child could possibly acquire the complexities of grammar from such an impoverished source.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1980. ''Rules and Representations.'' New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Far from viewing language as wholly external, Chomsky re-conceptualised it as wholly internal.

''The Architecture of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of such a faculty in ''Homo sapiens'', from this standpoint, presents biological science with a major theoretical challenge.

===Speech act theory===
{{Main|Speech act theory}}One way to explain biological complexity is by reference to its inferred function. According to the influential philosopher [[J. L. Austin|John Austin]],&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. 1978 [1955]. ''How to Do Things with Words.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; speech's primary function is action in the social world.

[[Speech acts]], according to this body of theory, can be analysed on three different levels: locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary. An act is ''locutionary'' when viewed as the production of certain linguistic sounds&amp;nbsp;— for example, practicing correct pronunciation in a foreign language. An act is ''illocutionary'' insofar as it constitutes an intervention in the world as jointly perceived or understood. Promising, marrying, divorcing, declaring, stating, authorising, announcing and so forth are all speech acts in this ''illocutionary'' sense. An act is ''perlocutionary'' when viewed in terms of its direct psychological effect on an audience. Frightening a baby by saying 'Boo!' would be an example of a "perlocutionary" act.

For Austin, "doing things" with words means, first and foremost, deploying ''illocutionary'' force. The secret of this is community participation or collusion. There must be a 'correct' (conventionally agreed) procedure, and all those concerned must accept that it has been properly followed. {{quotation|"One of our examples was, for instance, the utterance 'I do' (take this woman to be my lawful wedded wife), as uttered in the course of a marriage ceremony. Here we should say that in saying these words we are ''doing'' something&amp;nbsp;— namely, marrying, rather than ''reporting'' something, namely ''that'' we are marrying."|{{Citation|title=Austin, J. L. 1962. ''How To Do Things With Words.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 12-13.}}}} In the case of a priest declaring a couple to be man and wife, his words will have illocutionary force only if he is properly authorised and only if the ceremony is properly conducted, using words deemed appropriate to the occasion. Austin points out that should anyone attempt to baptize a penguin, the act would be null and void. For reasons which have nothing to do with physics, chemistry or biology, baptism is inappropriate to be applied to penguins, irrespective of the verbal formulation used.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. 1962. ''How To Do Things With Words.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

This body of theory may have implications for speculative scenarios concerning the origins of speech. "Doing things with words" presupposes shared understandings and agreements pertaining not just to language but to social conduct more generally. Apes might produce sequences of structured sound, influencing one another in that way. To deploy ''illocutionary'' force, however, they would need to have entered a non-physical and non-biological realm&amp;nbsp;— one of shared contractual and other intangibles. This novel cognitive domain consists of what philosophers term "institutional facts"&amp;nbsp;— objective facts whose existence, paradoxically, depends on communal faith or belief.&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Searle, J 1969" /&gt; Few primatologists, evolutionary psychologists or anthropologists consider that nonhuman primates are capable of the necessary levels of joint attention, sustained commitment or collaboration in pursuit of future goals.&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, M. 2006, Why don't apes point?

===Biosemiotics===
[[File:ADN animation.gif|thumb|The structure of part of a DNA [[double helix]]]]{{Main|Biosemiotics}}

{{quotation|"the deciphering of the genetic code has revealed our possession of a language much older than hieroglyphics, a language as old as life itself, a language that is the most living language of all&amp;nbsp;— even if its letters are invisible and its words are buried in the cells of our bodies."|{{Citation|title=Beadle, G. and M. Beadle, 1966. ''The Language of Life. An introduction to the science of genetics.'' Doubleday and Co, New York.}}}}

Biosemiotics is a relatively new discipline, inspired in large part by the discovery of the genetic code in the early 1960s. Its basic assumption is that ''Homo sapiens'' is not alone in its reliance on codes and signs. Language and symbolic culture must have biological roots, hence [[Semiotics|semiotic]] principles must apply also in the animal world.

The discovery of the molecular structure of DNA apparently contradicted the idea that life could be explained, ultimately, in terms of the fundamental laws of physics. The letters of the genetic alphabet seemed to have "meaning", yet meaning is not a concept which has any place in physics. The natural science community initially solved this difficulty by invoking the concept of "information", treating information as independent of meaning. But a different solution to the puzzle was to recall that the laws of physics in themselves are never sufficient to explain natural phenomena. To explain, say, the unique physical and chemical characteristics of the planets in our solar system, scientists must work out how the laws of physics became constrained by particular sequences of events following the formation of the Sun.

According to Howard Pattee&amp;nbsp;— a pioneering figure in biosemiotics&amp;nbsp;— the same principle applies to the evolution of life on earth, a process in which certain "frozen accidents" or "natural constraints" have from time to time drastically reduced the number of possible evolutionary outcomes. Codes, when they prove to be stable over evolutionary time, are constraints of this kind. The most fundamental such "frozen accident" was the emergence of DNA as a self-replicating molecule, but the history of life on earth has been characterised by a succession of comparably dramatic events, each of which can be conceptualised as the emergence of a new code.&lt;ref&gt;Barbieri, M. 2003. ''The Organic Codes. An Introduction to Semantic Biology.'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, the evolutionary emergence of spoken language was one more event of essentially the same kind.&lt;ref&gt;Pattee, H.

===The Handicap principle===
{{Main|Handicap principle}}

[[Image:Peacock front02 - melbourne zoo.jpg|thumb|A peacock's tail: a classic example of costly signalling]]

In 1975, the Israeli theoretical biologist [[Amotz Zahavi]]&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1975"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A. | title = Mate selection-a selection for a handicap. | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 205–14 |date=Sep 1975 | doi =  10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3| pmid = 1195756 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1977"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A. | title = The cost of honesty (further remarks on the handicap principle). | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 603–5 |date=Aug 1977 | doi =  10.1016/0022-5193(77)90061-3| pmid = 904334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zehavi 1997"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Zehavi | first1 = Amots. | last2 = Zahavi | first2 = Avishag. | title = The handicap principle : a missing piece of Darwin's puzzle | year = 1997 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-510035-8 | oclc = 35360821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a novel theory which, although controversial, has come to dominate Darwinian thinking on how signals evolve. Zahavi's "handicap principle" states that to be effective, signals must be reliable; to be reliable, the bodily investment in them must be so high as to make cheating unprofitable.

Paradoxically, if this logic is accepted, signals in nature evolve not to be efficient but, on the contrary, to be elaborate and wasteful of time and energy. A peacock's tail is the classic illustration. Zahavi's theory is that since peahens are on the look-out for male braggarts and cheats, they insist on a display of quality so costly that only a genuinely fit peacock could afford to pay. Needless to say, not all signals in the animal world are quite as elaborate as a peacock's tail. But if Zahavi is correct, all require some bodily investment&amp;nbsp;— an expenditure of time and energy which "handicaps" the signaller in some way.

Animal vocalisations (according to Zahavi) are reliable because they are faithful reflections of the state of the signaller's body. To switch from an honest to a deceitful call, the animal would have to adopt a different bodily posture. Since every bodily action has its own optimal starting position, changing that position to produce a false message would interfere with the task of carrying out the action really intended. The gains made by cheating would not make up for the losses incurred by assuming an improper posture&amp;nbsp;— and so the phony message turns out to be not worth its price.&lt;ref name="Zehavi 1997" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;69&lt;/sup&gt; This may explain, in particular, why ape and monkey vocal signals have evolved to be so strikingly inflexible when compared with the varied speech sounds produced by the human tongue. The apparent inflexibility of chimpanzee vocalisations may strike the human observer as surprising until we realise that being inflexible is necessarily bound up with being perceptibly honest in the sense of "hard-to-fake".

If we accept this theory, the emergence of speech becomes theoretically impossible. Communication of this kind just cannot evolve.&lt;ref name="Zahavi, A 1993" /&gt; The problem is that words are cheap. Nothing about their acoustic features can reassure listeners that they are genuine and not fakes. Any strategy of reliance on someone else's tongue&amp;nbsp;— perhaps the most flexible organ in the body&amp;nbsp;— presupposes unprecedented levels of honesty and trust. To date, Darwinian thinkers have found it difficult to explain the requisite levels of community-wide cooperation and trust.

An influential standard textbook is ''Animal Signals,'' by [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[David Harper (biologist)|David Harper]].&lt;ref name="Maynard Smith 2003"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = John | last2 = Harper | first2 = David | title = Animal signal | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-852685-8 | oclc = 54460090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors divide the costs of communication into two components, (1) the investment necessary to ensure transmission of a discernible signal; (2) the investment necessary to guarantee that each signal is reliable and not a fake. The authors point out that although costs in the second category may be relatively low, they are not zero. Even in relatively relaxed, cooperative social contexts&amp;nbsp;— for example, when communication is occurring between genetic kin&amp;nbsp;— some investment must be made to guarantee reliability. In short, the notion of super-efficient communication&amp;nbsp;— eliminating all costs except those necessary for successful transmission&amp;nbsp;— is biologically unrealistic. Yet speech comes precisely into this category.

===Cognitive linguistics===
{{Main|Cognitive linguistics}}Cognitive linguistics views linguistic structure as arising continuously out of usage. Speakers are forever discovering new ways to convey meanings by producing sounds, and in some cases these novel strategies become conventionalised. Between phonological structure and semantic structure there is no causal relationship. Instead, each novel pairing of sound and meaning involves an imaginative leap.

In their book, ''Metaphors We Live By,'' [[George Lakoff]] and Mark Johnson helped pioneer this approach, claiming that ''[[metaphor]]'' is what makes human thought special. All language, they argued, is permeated with metaphor, whose use in fact ''constitutes'' distinctively human&amp;nbsp;— that is, distinctively abstract&amp;nbsp;— thought. To conceptualise things which cannot be directly perceived&amp;nbsp;— intangibles such as time, life, reason, mind, society or justice&amp;nbsp;— we have no choice but to set out from more concrete and directly perceptible phenomena such as motion, location, distance, size and so forth. In all cultures across the world, according to Lakoff and Johnson, people resort to such familiar metaphors as ''ideas are locations, thinking is moving'' and ''mind is body''. For example, we might express the idea of "arriving at a crucial point in our argument" by proceeding as if literally travelling from one physical location to the next.

Metaphors, by definition, are not literally true. Strictly speaking, they are fictions&amp;nbsp;— from a pedantic standpoint, even falsehoods. But if we couldn't resort to metaphorical fictions, it's doubtful whether we could even form conceptual representations of such nebulous phenomena as "ideas", thoughts", "minds", and so forth.

The bearing of these ideas on current thinking on speech origins remains unclear. One suggestion is that ape communication tends to resist metaphor for social reasons. Since they inhabit a Darwinian (as opposed to morally regulated) social world, these animals are under strong competitive pressure ''not'' to accept patent fictions as valid communicative currency. Ape vocal communication tends to be inflexible, marginalising the ultra-flexible tongue, precisely because listeners treat with suspicion any signal which might prove to be a fake. Such insistence on perceptible veracity is clearly incompatible with metaphoric usage. An implication is that neither articulate speech nor distinctively human abstract thought could have begun evolving until our ancestors had become more cooperative and trusting of one another's communicative intentions.&lt;ref name="Knight 2008" /&gt;

===Natural science or social science?===

====Social reality====
{{Main|Social reality}}When people converse with one another, according to the American philosopher [[John Searle]], they're making moves, not in the real world which other species inhabit, but in a shared virtual realm peculiar to ourselves. Unlike the deployment of muscular effort to move a physical object, the deployment of [[illocutionary force]] requires no physical effort (except movement of the tongue/mouth to produce speech) and produces no effect which any measuring device could detect. Instead, our action takes place on a quite different level&amp;nbsp;— that of ''social'' reality. This kind of reality is in one sense hallucinatory, being a product of collective intentionality. It consists, not of "brute facts"&amp;nbsp;— facts which exist anyway, irrespective of anyone's belief&amp;nbsp;— but of "institutional facts", which "exist" only if you believe in them. Government, marriage, citizenship and money are examples of "institutional facts". One can distinguish between "brute" facts and "institutional" ones by applying a simple test. Suppose no one believed in the fact&amp;nbsp;— would it still be true? If the answer is "yes", it's "brute". If the answer is "no", it's "institutional".&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt;

{{quotation|"Imagine a group of primitive creatures, more or less like ourselves&amp;nbsp;... Now imagine that, acting as a group, they build a barrier, a wall around the place where they live&amp;nbsp;... The wall is designed to keep intruders out and keep members of the group in&amp;nbsp;... Let us suppose that the wall gradually decays. It slowly deteriorates until all that is left is a line of stones. But let us suppose that the inhabitants continue to treat the line of stones as if it could perform the function of the wall. Let us suppose that, as a matter of fact, they treat the line of stones just as if they understood that it was not to be crossed&amp;nbsp;... This shift is the decisive move in the creation of institutional reality. It is nothing less than the decisive move in the creation of what we think of as distinctive in human, as opposed to animal, societies."|{{Citation| title = ''John R. Searle, 1995.'' The construction of social reality, ''Free Press, pp.134''}}&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt;}}

The facts of language in general and of speech in particular are, from this perspective, "institutional" rather than "brute". The semantic meaning of a word, for example, is whatever its users imagine it to be. To "do things with words" is to operate in a virtual world which seems real because we share it in common. In this incorporeal world, the laws of physics, chemistry and biology do not apply. That explains why illocutionary force can be deployed without exerting muscular effort. Apes and monkeys inhabit the "brute" world. To make an impact, they must scream, bark, threaten, seduce or in other ways invest bodily effort. If they were invited to play chess, they would be unable to resist throwing their pieces at one another. Speech is not like that. A few movements of the tongue, under appropriate conditions, can be sufficient to open parliament, annul a marriage, confer a knighthood or declare war.&lt;ref name="Searle, J 1969"&gt;Searle, J. 1969. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=t3_WhfknvF0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Speech Acts. An essay in the Philosophy of Language].'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; To explain, on a Darwinian basis, how such apparent magic first began to work, we must ask how, when and why ''Homo sapiens'' succeeded in establishing the wider domain of institutional facts.

====Nature or society?====
{{Main|Evolutionary linguistics}}
"[[Brute fact#Searle|Brute facts]]", in the terminology of speech act philosopher [[John Searle]],&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt; are facts which are true anyway, regardless of human belief. Suppose you don't believe in gravity: jump over a cliff and you'll still fall. [[Natural science]] is the study of facts of this kind. "Institutional facts" are fictions accorded factual status within human [[social institutions]]. Monetary and commercial facts are fictions of this kind. The complexities of today's global currency system are facts only while we believe in them: suspend the belief and the facts correspondingly dissolve. Yet although institutional facts rest on human belief, that doesn't make them mere distortions or hallucinations. Take my confidence that these two five-pound banknotes in my pocket are worth ten pounds. That's not merely my subjective belief: it's an objective, indisputable fact. But now imagine a collapse of public confidence in the currency system. Suddenly, the realities in my pocket dissolve.

Scholars who doubt the scientific validity of the notion of "institutional facts" include [[Noam Chomsky]], for whom language is not social. In Chomsky's view, language is a natural object (a component of the individual brain) and its study, therefore, a branch of natural science. In explaining the origin of language, scholars in this intellectual camp invoke non-social developments&amp;nbsp;— in Chomsky's case, a random genetic mutation.&lt;ref name="Chomsky, N 2000" /&gt; Chomsky argues that language might exist inside the brain of a single mutant gorilla even if no one else believed in it, even if no one else existed apart from the mutant&amp;nbsp;— and even if the gorilla in question remained unaware of its existence, never actually speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 2000. ''The Architecture of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 17-18..&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposite philosophical camp are those who, in the tradition of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], argue that if no one believed in words or rules, they simply would not exist. These scholars, correspondingly, regard language as essentially institutional, concluding that linguistics should be considered a topic within [[social science]]. In explaining the evolutionary emergence of language, scholars in this intellectual camp tend to invoke profound changes in social relationships.&lt;ref name="Knight 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dessalles 2007"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Dessalles | first1 = Jean-Louis. | title = Why we talk : the evolutionary origins of language | year = 2007 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford ; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-927623-3 | oclc = 71329834 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism.''' Darwinian scientists today see little value in the traditional distinction between "natural" and "social" science. [[Darwinism]] in its modern form is the study of cooperation and competition in nature&amp;nbsp;— a topic which is intrinsically social.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1985. ''Social Evolution.''

'''Philology''' is the study of language in oral and written historical sources; it is the intersection between [[textual criticism]], [[literary criticism]], [[history]], and [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2joVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA5 |title=Philology |last=Peile |first=John |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |year=1880 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philology is more commonly defined as the study of literary texts as well as oral and written records, the establishment of their authenticity and their original form, and the determination of their meaning. A person who pursues this kind of study is known as a philologist.

In older usage, especially British, philology is more general, covering comparative and historical linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/philology |title=philology |website=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/philology |title=philology |website=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical philology]] studies [[classical languages]]. Classical philology principally originated from the [[Library of Pergamum]] and the [[Library of Alexandria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=F. W.|title=A Companion to Classical Texts|year=1968|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford, England|pages=22–52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzW7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22}}&lt;/ref&gt; around the fourth century BCE, continued by Greeks and Romans throughout the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]/[[Byzantine Empire]]. It was preserved and promoted during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], and eventually resumed by European scholars of the [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance]], where it was soon joined by philologies of other non-Asian (European) ([[Germanic philology|Germanic]], [[Celtic studies|Celtic]]), Eurasian ([[Slavistics]], etc.) and Asian ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Sanskrit grammarians|Sanskrit]], [[Sinology|Chinese]], etc.) languages. [[Indo-European studies]] involves the [[comparative linguistics|comparative]] philology of all [[Indo-European languages]].

Philology, with its focus on historical development ([[Synchrony and diachrony|diachronic]] analysis), is contrasted with [[Theoretical linguistics|linguistics]] due to [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s insistence on the importance of [[Synchronic analysis (linguistics)|synchronic analysis]]. The contrast continued with the emergence of [[structuralism]] and [[Chomskyan]] linguistics alongside its emphasis on [[syntax]].
{{wiktionary}}

== Etymology ==
The term "[[:wikt:philology|philology]]" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|φιλολογία}} (''philología''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23111282 |chapter=φιλολογία |first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell |first2=Robert |last2=Scott |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the terms {{lang|grc|φίλος}} (''phílos'') "love, affection, loved, beloved, dear, friend" and {{lang|grc|λόγος}} (''[[lógos]]'') "word, articulation, reason", describing a love of learning, of literature, as well as of argument and reasoning, reflecting the range of activities included under the notion of {{lang|grc|[[logos|λόγος]]}}. The term changed little with the Latin ''philologia'', and later entered the English language in the 16th century, from the [[Middle French]] ''philologie'', in the sense of "love of literature".

The adjective {{lang|grc|φιλόλογος}} (''philólogos'') meant "fond of discussion or argument, talkative", in [[Koine Greek|Hellenistic Greek]], also implying an excessive ("[[sophism|sophistic]]") preference of argument over the love of true wisdom, {{lang|grc|[[philosophy|φιλόσοφος]]}} (''philósophos'').

As an [[allegory]] of literary erudition, ''philologia'' appears in fifth-century postclassical literature ([[Martianus Capella]], ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii''), an idea revived in Late Medieval literature ([[Chaucer]], [[John Lydgate|Lydgate]]).

The meaning of "love of learning and literature" was narrowed to "the study of the historical development of languages" ([[historical linguistics]]) in 19th-century usage of the term. Due to the rapid progress made in understanding [[sound law]]s and [[language change]], the "golden age of philology" lasted throughout the 19th century, or "from [[Giacomo Leopardi]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] to [[Nietzsche]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholar.princeton.edu/nwegmann/ |title=Nikolaus Wegmann, Princeton University Department of German |publisher=Scholar.princeton.edu |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anglo-Saxon world, the term philology to describe work on languages and literatures, which had become synonymous with the practices of German scholars, was abandoned as a consequence of anti-German feeling following [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Utz|Utz, Richard]]. "Them Philologists: Philological Practices and Their Discontents from Nietzsche to Cerquiglini." ''The Year's Work in Medievalism'' 26 (2011): 4–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Most continental European countries still maintain the term to designate departments, colleges, position titles, and journals. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] opposed the nationalist reaction against philological practices, claiming that "the philological instinct" was "universal as is the use of language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tolkien |first=J. R. R. |authorlink=J. R. R. Tolkien |title=Philology: General Works |journal=The Year's Work of English Studies |volume=4 |number=1 |year=1923 |pages=36–37 |doi=10.1093/ywes/IV.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Utz|Utz, Richard]]. "''Englische Philologie'' vs. English Studies: A Foundational Conflict", in ''Das Potential europäischer Philologien: Geschichte, Leistung, Funktion'', ed. Christoph König (Göttingen: Wallstein, 2009), pp. 34–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[British English]] usage, and in British academia, "philology" remains largely synonymous with "historical linguistics", while in [[US English]], and US academia, the wider meaning of "study of a language's grammar, history and literary tradition" remains more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna Morpurgo Davies|A. Morpurgo Davies]], ''History of Linguistics'' (1998) 4 I. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. M. Bravmann, ''Studies in Semitic Philology''. (1977) p.&amp;nbsp;457.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the harsh critique of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], US scholars since the 1980s have viewed philology as responsible for a narrowly [[scientism|scientistic]] study of language and literature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Utz|Utz, Richard]].

== Branches ==

=== Comparative ===
{{main article|Comparative philology}}
[[File:Indo European philology historical and comparative 1969.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Indo-European Philology: Historical and Comparative'' by [[William Burley Lockwood]] (1969)]]

The [[comparative linguistics]] branch of philology studies the relationship between languages. Similarities between [[Sanskrit]] and [[European languages]] were first noted in the early 16th century&lt;ref&gt;This is noted in Juan Mascaro's introduction to his translation of the ''Bhagavad Gita'', in which he dates the first ''Gita'' translation to 1785 (by Charles Williams). Mascaro claims the linguist [[Alexander Hamilton (linguist)|Alexander Hamilton]] stopped in Paris in 1802 after returning from India, and taught Sanskrit to the German critic [[Friedrich von Schlegel]]. Mascaro says this is the beginning of modern study of the roots of the Indo-European languages.&lt;/ref&gt; and led to speculation of a common ancestor language from which all these descended. It is now named [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. Philology's interest in ancient languages led to the study of what were, in the 18th century, "exotic" languages, for the light they could cast on problems in understanding and [[decipher]]ing the origins of older texts.

=== Textual ===
{{main article|Textual criticism}}
Philology also includes the study of texts and their history. It includes elements of [[textual criticism]], trying to reconstruct an author's original text based on variant copies of manuscripts. This branch of research arose among Ancient scholars in the 4th century BC Greek-speaking world, who desired to establish a standard text of popular authors for the purposes of both sound interpretation and secure transmission.  Since that time, the original principles of textual criticism have been improved and applied to other widely distributed texts such as the Bible.  Scholars have tried to reconstruct the original readings of the [[Bible]] from the manuscript variants. This method was applied to Classical Studies and to medieval texts as a way to reconstruct the author's original work. The method produced so-called "critical editions", which provided a reconstructed text accompanied by a "[[critical apparatus]]", i.e., footnotes that listed the various manuscript variants available, enabling scholars to gain insight into the entire manuscript tradition and argue about the variants.&lt;ref name = GB1&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JewJCYZlYV8C&amp;pg=PA9 |title=Textual Scholarship: An Introduction |first=D. C. |last=Greetham |publisher=Garland Publishing |year=1994 |accessdate=2011-07-16 |isbn=9780815317913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related study method known as [[higher criticism]] studies the authorship, date, and provenance of text to place such text in historical context.&lt;ref name = GB1/&gt; As these philological issues are often inseparable from issues of interpretation, there is no clear-cut boundary between philology and [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref name = GB1/&gt; When text has a significant political or religious influence (such as the reconstruction of Biblical texts), scholars have difficulty reaching objective conclusions.

Some scholars avoid all critical methods of textual philology,&lt;ref name = GB1/&gt; especially in historical linguistics, where it is important to study the actual recorded materials. The movement known as [[New Philology]] has rejected textual criticism because it injects editorial interpretations into the text and destroys the integrity of the individual manuscript, hence damaging the reliability of the data. Supporters of New Philology insist on a strict "diplomatic" approach: a faithful rendering of the text exactly as found in the manuscript, without emendations.

=== Cognitive ===
{{main article|Cognitive philology}}
Another branch of philology, cognitive philology, studies written and oral texts. Cognitive philology considers these oral texts as the results of human mental processes. This science compares the results of textual science with the results of experimental research of both psychology and artificial intelligence production systems.

=== Decipherment ===
In the case of [[Bronze Age literature]], philology includes the prior [[decipherment]] of the language under study. This has notably been the case with the [[Ancient Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]], [[Hittite language|Hittite]], [[Ugaritic]] and [[Luwian language|Luwian]] languages. Beginning with the famous decipherment and translation of the [[Rosetta Stone]] by [[Jean-François Champollion]] in 1822, a number of individuals attempted to decipher the writing systems of the [[Ancient Near East]] and [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]]. In the case of [[Old Persian]] and [[Mycenaean Greek]], decipherment yielded older records of languages already known from slightly more recent traditions ([[Middle Persian]] and [[Ancient Greek|Alphabetic Greek]]).

Work on the ancient languages of the Near East progressed rapidly. In the mid-19th century, [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] and others deciphered the [[Behistun Inscription]], which records the same text in [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], using a variation of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] for each language. The elucidation of cuneiform led to the decipherment of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. [[Hittite language|Hittite]] was deciphered in 1915 by [[Bedřich Hrozný]].

[[Linear B]], a script used in the ancient Aegean, was deciphered in 1952 by [[Michael Ventris]] and [[John Chadwick]], who demonstrated that it recorded an early form of Greek, now known as [[Mycenaean language|Mycenaean Greek]]. [[Linear A]], the writing system that records the still-unknown language of the [[Minoan Civilization|Minoans]], resists deciphering, despite many attempts.

Work continues on scripts such as the [[Maya script|Maya]], with great progress since the initial breakthroughs of the phonetic approach championed by [[Yuri Knorozov]] and others in the 1950s. Since the late 20th century, the Maya code has been almost completely deciphered, and the Mayan languages are among the most documented and studied in Mesoamerica. The code is described as a [[logosyllabic]] style of writing, which could be used to fully express any spoken thought.

==In popular culture==

In the ''[[The Space Trilogy|Space Trilogy]]'' by [[C.S. Lewis]], the main character, Elwin Ransom, is a philologist - as was Lewis' close friend [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].

Dr. Edward Morbius, one of the main characters in the science-fiction film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'', is a philologist.

[[Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld]], the main character in [[Alexander McCall Smith]]'s 1997 comic novel ''[[Portuguese Irregular Verbs]]'' is a philologist, educated at Cambridge.

The main character in the [[List of submissions to the 84th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film|Academy Award Nominee for Best Foreign Language film]] in 2012, ''[[Footnote (film)|Footnote]]'', is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] philologist, and a significant part of the film deals with his work.

'''Proto-Tupian''' ('''PT''') is the [[linguistic reconstruction]] of the common ancestor of all the [[Tupian languages]]. It consists, therefore, of a hypothetic language, reconstructed by the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] from data of the descendant languages. In [[Brazil]], the historical-comparative studies are being developed mainly by two scientific teams: one from the Laboratório de Línguas Indígenas (LALI) of the [[University of Brasília]], under the coordination of [[Aryon Rodrigues]]; and the other one from the [[Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi]], located in [[Belém]], under the orientation of [[Denny Moore]]. The studies are showing several important evidences about the Proto-Tupi culture (demonstrating, for example, that the ancestors of the [[Tupi people]]s already dedicated to [[agriculture]]) &lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues, Aryon dall'Agna &amp; Ana Suelly Arruda Câmara Cabral. [http://abralin.org/revista/RV5N1_2/RV5N1_2_art1.pdf Investigando a origem e o desenvolvimento de orações dependentes nas famílias do tronco lingüístico Tupi]. ''Revista da Abralin'', volume 5, numbers 1 and 2 (ten/2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The most accepted theory is that the Tupian language family was originated between the [[Guaporé River|Guaporé]] and [[Aripuanã]] rivers, in the [[Madeira River]] basin. Right now, there are almost 70 living Tupian languages, including [[Tupi language|Tupi]], [[Guarani language|Paraguayan Guarani]], [[Awetï language|Awetï]], [[Mbyá Guaraní language|Ayvu]], etc.

==Homeland and ''urheimat''==
Rodrigues (2007) considers the Proto-Tupian [[urheimat]] to be somewhere between the [[Guaporé River|Guaporé]] and [[Aripuanã]] rivers, in the [[Madeira River]] basin. Much of this area corresponds to the modern-day state of [[Rondônia]], Brazil. 5 of the 10 Tupian branches are found in this area, as well as some [[Tupi–Guarani languages]] (especially [[Kawahíb language|Kawahíb]]), making it the probable urheimat of these languages and maybe of its speaking peoples. Rodrigues believes that PT dates back to around 5,000 [[Before Present|B.P.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3900">'''Robert Machin''' or '''Machim''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 14th century) was an [[England|English]] adventurer of uncertain historicity, who supposedly discovered the island of [[Madeira]].&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Fernández-Armesto|first=Felipe|authorlink=Felipe Fernández-Armesto|title=Machim (supp. fl. 14th cent.)|encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/17535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various traditions give conflicting versions of Machin's story.

In the best-known version the protagonist is a knight, and referred to as the Machim.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; He was an English aristocrat who traded on the [[Mediterranean]], and fell in love with a woman by the name of Anne d'Arfet. Her original name could have been Dorset, Darbey or Hertford; after the story was transmitted through foreign languages it is no longer clear.&lt;ref name="Bolt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolt|first=Rodney|title=Madeira and Porto Santo|publisher=Cadogan Guides|location=London|year=2007|pages=20&amp;ndash;1|isbn=978-1-86011-364-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwPmkjQ3jb0C&amp;pg=PA20|accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne was of a higher social standing than Robert, and the two had to elope from the town of [[Bristol]]. Their ship is driven away from the coast of France by a storm, and after thirteen days they see the island of Madeira, where they land. At this point, however, Anne dies from exhaustion, and Robert follows her few days later.&lt;ref name="Beazley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beazley|first=C. R.|authorlink=Raymond Beazley|title=Prince Henry the Navigator|publisher=BiblioBazaar|year=2008|origyear=1895|pages=111&amp;ndash;2|isbn=0-554-25702-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwFQqM-xYo0C&amp;pg=PA111|accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew of the ship make it to [[North Africa]], where they are captured by the [[Moors]].&lt;ref name="Prestage"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prestage|first=Edgar|title=The Portuguese Pioneers|publisher=Read Books|year=2008|origyear=1933|pages=35&amp;ndash;6|isbn=1-4437-2694-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLxQRUWUb5IC&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of their fellow prisoners, called Morales of [[Seville]], is ransomed and sent back to [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], but on the way back he is captured by a servant of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] of [[Portugal]]. When Prince Henry hears of the story he promptly sends out an expedition that finds the island of Madeira.&lt;ref name="Beazley"/&gt;

This version of the story was supposedly written down by a member of Prince Henry's household, and became the basis for several later versions. It is known to date back at least to 1579. Another tradition is probably older, and can be traced back to 1507. In this version, Machin survives his lover, and builds an [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] over her grave. He makes it off the island and eventually ends up at the royal court of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. Finally, a third version tells of a [[France|French]] merchant by the name of il Macino. This adventurer, known from the writings of [[Giulio Landi]], differs from the other two in two senses: he has no mistress, and he later returns to colonise the island.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Though it is unknown whether the story of Machin is true, the island still carries a reminder of him in the name of the city [[Machico]], which supposedly was named after him.&lt;ref name="Prestage"/&gt; It is certain that the discovery of Madeira predates the Portuguese settlement, as it appears on maps as early as 1339.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; In 1419 [[João Gonçalves Zarco]] landed on the island, and colonised it for Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Bolt 2007, pp. 21&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Natural Language Technology Research''' (abbr. as '''SNLTR''') is an organization that promotes research in Corpus Linguistics, Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing in [[Bengali language]]. Among its primary goals are creation and archiving of a fully [[Unicode]]-compatible [[Bengali language|Bengali]] literary corpus to be hosted and published online, as well as the creation of fonts that will help people type Bengali text with ease.

== About SNLTR ==

English is still the primary medium of interaction with computers. Consequently, a large section of the population in India is not able to reap the benefits of the technology. Though the issue of localization of interface has been discussed in different forum, the goal is yet to be achieved.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In spite of the fact that desktop publishing has come of age for Bengali and other Indian languages and there are several software available for Bengali, the problem persists due to the absence of i) standardization of Bengali encoding, ii) encoding compliant font design, iii) availability of compliant keyboard layouts etc. The lack of adherence to standard does not allow the computing activities in Indian languages to be inter-operable across computing platforms.

In order to make the computing activities Bengali compatible, it is essential to establish a proper standard. Though a number of organizations have taken up language processing activities, the necessity of establishing proper coherence among them is very much felt, in order to deliver useful products.

Language Technology research has to focus on two components, written text as well as spoken language .Besides text processing, speech generation and recognition are two very important areas in which research and development have to be focused. This development will not only result in more natural human-computer interfaces, but will also empower the physically challenged like those with speech impairment and visual impairment, to benefit from computer technology.

The Society for Natural Language Technology Research has been formed to address the above-mentioned requirements. The society has been seeded by the Government of West Bengal (Dept. of Information Technology) with initial funding and support. Operationally, the society aims to carry out its activities in a multipolar manner, involving other academic and research institutes as well as industries.

Data Representation and Encoding Standard: Society for Natural Language Technology Research has decided to accept UNICODE 5.0 and upwards as the standard for data representation and encoding for Bengali.

== Mission and Goals ==

* To develop technology and standards to make computer usage Bengali enabled.
* To spread out the benefits of language technology research to real life activities including official works, education, and literature through development of suitable applications.
* To establish a collaborative environment of natural language processing related activities with educational and research organizations as well as with industries.

The immediate goals of the society are:
* To establish standards for Bengali text processing to ensure interoperability across platforms.
* To develop large standardized corpus for Bengali text and speech.
* To create an ensemble of available Bengali software and corpus in a standardized form and make them easily available to all.
* To develop new software and modify or enhance the existing software.
* To develop suitable speech Technology for Bengali.
* To work towards similar development for other Eastern Indian Languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7852">'''"Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast"''' is an essay by [[Tom Wolfe]] that appeared in the November 1989 issue of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' criticizing the American literary establishment for retreating from [[literary realism|realism]].

== Background ==
After being serialized in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, Wolfe's first novel, ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' was published in 1987.  Prior to the novel, Wolfe had made his career as a journalist and author of non-fiction books.  Wolfe had been a pioneer of "[[New Journalism]]," a style of non-fiction that relied heavily on novelistic techniques such as the use of scene, dialogue, first-person point of view from the subjects of the stories and recording minute details of everyday routine.

In his novel, ''Bonfire of the Vanities'', Wolfe used many of the writing techniques in his journalism, but this time to tell what Wolfe called a "fictional novel" (though novel traditionally denotes fiction and is hence redundant, Wolfe's "New Journalism" was sometimes described as [[non-fiction novel]]s).  In addition, Wolfe set out in ''Bonfire'' to capture the spirit of [[New York City]] in the 1980s.  The book was a commercial success, becoming a [[New York Times Bestseller]] and earning critical praise.&lt;ref name="Jack Miles Response"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Endpapers: Tom Wolfe's Literary Manifesto: A Response | date = 1989-11-12 | work = [[The Los Angeles Times]] | author = [[Jack Miles]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Essay ==
In his ''Harper's'' essay, Wolfe (at the time a contributing editor of the magazine) argues that American authors had strayed far from the tradition of realism seen in the writing of giants of American literature like [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[William Faulkner]] and [[John Steinbeck]].&lt;ref name="Time to Get Real"&gt;{{Cite news | title = For American Novelists, It's Time to Get Real | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 1989-10-30 | author = [[Jonathan Yardley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfe uses his own writing to illustrate his point: when he wrote ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'', he expected a novelist to write a great fictional tale about the [[hippie|hippie movement]]; after writing ''[[Radical Chic &amp; Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers]]'', about racial strife in cities in the '60s and '70s, he expected great novels to follow suit; after ''[[The Right Stuff (book)|The Right Stuff]]'', he expected a novel about [[astronauts]] and [[NASA]].&lt;ref name="Tom Wolfe throws down"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Tom Wolfe throws down a glove; Back to reality | work = [[The Economist]] | date = 1989-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wolfe says that, to his surprise, great novels on these cultural movements never arrived:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Publishers, "Had their noses pressed against their thermopane glass walls scanning the billion-footed city for the approach of the young novelists who, surely, would bring them the big novels of the racial clashes, the hippie movement, the New Left, the Wall Street boom, the sexual revolution, the war in Vietnam. But such creatures, it seemed, no longer existed.  The strange fact of the matter was that young people with serious literary ambitions were no longer interested in the metropolis or any other big, rich slices of contemporary life."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wolfe places the split from realism at 1960; after which the literary establishment turned to [[absurdism|absurdist]] novels, [[magic realism|magical realism]], [[minimalism]], [[postmodernism]] and foreign writers, "the gods of the new breed."  Wolfe singles out [[Milan Kundera]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Italo Calvino]] and [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]] as exemplars of this new obsession.&lt;ref name="Robert Towers Flap"&gt;{{Cite news | title = The Flap Over Tom Wolfe: How Real is the Retreat from Realism? | date = 1990-01-28 | author = Robert Towers | work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wolfe sees these trends as the novel sliding into irrelevancy.  Wolfe concludes that authors must return to realism, "If fiction writers do not start facing the obvious, the literary history of the second half of the twentieth century will record that journalists not only took over the richness of American life as their domain but also seized the high ground of literature itself."

==Reaction and criticism==
Wolfe's essay caused an uproar among writers, literary critics and journalists.  Three months after the essay appeared, author Robert Towers wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'', "I cannot offhand recall an article in a small magazine making a bigger splash in the literary pool than Tom Wolfe's manifesto..."&lt;ref name="Robert Towers Flap" /&gt;  For months after the essay, Wolfe appeared on television and on the lecture circuit defending and debating his thesis.&lt;ref name="Freddie Baveystock literary world"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Bonfire of the literary world | work = [[The Times]] | author = Freddie Baveystock | date = 1990-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While some critics agreed with Wolfe,&lt;ref name="Time to Get Real" /&gt; others took issue with his essay, stating that he essentially had argued that other writers need to be more like himself.&lt;ref name="Jack Miles Response" /&gt;

Critics also noted that while many authors wrote the sorts of books Wolfe criticized, there were countless authors like [[Don DeLillo]] or [[John le Carré]], [[Louise Erdrich]] or [[Toni Morrison]], who wrote realism and were critically praised.&lt;ref name="Robert Towers Flap" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jack Miles Response" /&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' described the essay as "one part serious argument with two parts calculated provocation," noting that the essay had helped continue discussion (and boost sales) of ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities|Bonfire of the Vanities]]''.&lt;ref name="Freddie Baveystock literary world" /&gt;  Others were outright dismissive, with author [[Jim Harrison]] opining that Wolfe's ideas were "the Babbitry of art in a new, white suit."&lt;ref name="Taming His College Critics"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Tom Wolfe, Taming His College Critics; Collection a Hopkins Degree &amp; Defending the Harper's Essay | work = [[The Washington Post]] | author = Charles Trueheart | date = 1990-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfe wrote later works in the genre of "fictional novels," 1998's ''[[A Man in Full]]'' and 2004's ''[[I Am Charlotte Simmons]]''.&lt;ref name="I am Still Tom Wolfe"&gt;{{Cite news | title = I am Still Tom Wolfe | date = 2004-11-08 | author = [[Lev Grossman]] | work = [[Time Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The essay launched a feud between Wolfe and other prominent literary figures that never ended.  In 2000, he called [[John Irving]], [[John Updike]] and [[Norman Mailer]], "the three stooges" in response to their criticisms of his novels.  Irving, for example, had dismissed Wolfe's work as "yak" and "journalistic hyperbole."&lt;ref name="Salon Three Stooges"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Tom Wolfe calls Irving, Mailer and Updike "the Three Stooges" | work = Salon.com | date = 2000-01-21 | url = http://www.salon.com/books/log/2000/01/21/wolfe | author = Craig Offman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar name-calling surrounded the release of ''I Am Charlotte Simmons''.&lt;ref name="I am Still Tom Wolfe" /&gt; The essay was also cited and critiqued in [[Jonathan Franzen|Jonathan Franzen's]] essay "[[Why Bother? (essay)|Perchance to Dream]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8404">'''The Anglo Mexican Foundation''' is a not for profit educational organization located in [[Mexico]] with its main offices in [[Colonia San Rafael]] in [[Mexico City]]. Its main activities are associated with [[English as a foreign or second language|English language teaching]], examination preparation, teacher training, scholarships for teachers and cultural activities.&lt;ref name="whoarewe"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tamf.org.mx/en/quienes.php |title= Who are we?  |publisher=The Anglo Mexican Foundation |location=Mexico |accessdate=September 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation began as the Instituto Anglo Mexicano de Cultura A.C. in 1943 with the aim of strengthening ties between Mexico and Great Britain through cultural exchange. The Foundation took on its current name in 2003, which was accompanied by a reorganization.&lt;ref name="quienes"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ca.org.mx/quienes_somos.php |title= Profile |publisher=The Anglo Mexican Foundation |location=Mexico |accessdate=September 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="italfound"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iicmessico.esteri.it/IIC_Messico/Menu/Opportunit%C3%A0/Cooperazione_culturale_e_scientifica/ |title= Cooperación cultural y científica |publisher=Instituto Italiano de Cultura Ciudad de Méxioc |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Cultural and scientific cooperation |accessdate=September 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools==
Most of the instruction associated with the Foundation is through The Anglo, which gives classes in the English language, standardized test preparation and teacher training.&lt;ref name="areasact"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tamf.org.mx/en/areas.php|title= Our Areas of Activity |publisher=The Anglo Mexican Foundation |location=Mexico |accessdate=September 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; English language teaching has been the main activity of the foundation with The Anglo operating for over sixty-eight years. Most of its success comes from the quality and commitment of its teachers and staff.&lt;ref name="quienes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cuando"&gt;{{cite news |title= Cuando de acreditar el ingles se trata... |newspaper=Palabra |location=Saltillo, Mexico |page=7 |date=July 21, 2004 |language=Spanish |trans-title=When accrediting English you mean… }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these courses include in house classes or general language and standardized test preparation and specialty courses for businesses. Teacher training and scholarship programs mainly focus on the professional development of Mexican national teachers of English. Programs offered to these teachers include pre service courses such as The Pre school Teaching Course, The Primary Teaching Course and The Teacher Training Course. Some of the in-service courses for teachers are The In-Service Teacher Training Course and The Teacher Development Course. It is worth mentioning that several of these courses have recognition by SEP.&lt;ref name="areasact"/&gt;

The Anglo is also the largest authorized Cambridge ESOL exam centre in Mexico. Cambridge ESOL, offers the world’s leading range of certificates for learners of English. The tests offered by its Centre of Exams Unit are designed at all levels of English from the [[Cambridge English: Key (KET)|Key English Test]] (KET) for the basic level, the [[Preliminary English Test]] (PET) for intermediate, the [[First Certificate in English]] (FCE) for upper-intermediate, the [[Certificate in Advanced English]] (CAE) for advanced learners and the [[Certificate of Proficiency in English]] (CPE) for those candidates with a very advanced level of English.

In 1998, the Foundation established The Churchill School and in 2003 The Churchill College. The School provides education for  students from kindergarten through primary/middle school. The College focuses on high school/preparatory students. These schools are bilingual with an international focus and are members of the [[International Baccalaureate Organisation]] (IB).&lt;ref name="areasact"/&gt;&lt;ref name="churchsch"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://churchill.edu.mx/quienes.php |title=¿Quiénes Somos?  |publisher=The Churchill School |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Who are we? |accessdate=September 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other programs==
Since 1943, the Foundation has supported cultural events with the purpose of strengthening ties between Mexico and Great Britain. These include music, theater, dance, visual arts, cinema and conferences. The Foundation also develops cultural materials for both its own and other schools, which occur both in Mexico and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="areasact"/&gt; The Foundation sponsors regularly occurring film events with a schedule available online.&lt;ref name="cineanglo"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.imcine.gob.mx/cine-en-el-the-anglo-mexican-foundation.html |title= Cine en el The Anglo Mexican Foundation |publisher= Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografía |location=Mexico |accessdate=September 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural and educational exchanges include representing the GAP Project in Mexico,&lt;ref name="quienes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="areasact"/&gt; and offering scholarships as part of the [[United World Colleges]] program. Selected candidates complete the English Language Scholarships in different places in the world.&lt;ref name="areasact"/&gt;

In 2010, the “An encounter with [[Bob Geldof]]” conference was held at the [[National Auditorium]]. Geldof was accompanied by [[José Areán]], an internationally recognized Mexican musician.&lt;ref name="encuentro"&gt;{{cite press release |title= Un encuentro con Bob Geldof - The Anglo Mexican Foundation |publisher= British Embassy Mexico City |date=July 7, 2010 |url= http://ukinmexico.fco.gov.uk/es/news/?id=22508185&amp;view=PressR |language=Spanish |trans-title=An encounter with Bob Geldof |accessdate=September 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another event in the same year was the presentation of a compilation of letters written in the 19th century about Mexico by Scotswoman [[Fanny Calderón de la Barca]].

{{Nihongo|'''''The Place Promised in Our Early Days'''''|雲のむこう、約束の場所|Kumo no Mukō, Yakusoku no Basho|lit. "Beyond the Clouds, the Promised Place"|lead=yes}} is a 2004 Japanese [[anime]] [[science fiction]] [[war film|war]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written, directed, produced, cinematographed, edited, and storyboarded by [[Makoto Shinkai]] in his feature film debut. Set over several years in an [[alternate history]] where the [[Soviet Union]] occupies half of Japan, the film follows two childhood friends who grow apart after one of their friends disappears; as international tension rises and a mysterious tower built by the Union starts replacing matter around it with matter from other universes, they cross paths once again and realize their missing friend might be the key to save the world.

Unlike his short film ''[[Voices of a Distant Star]]'', which was largely made by Shinkai on his own, ''The Place Promised in Our Early Days'' is a full-scale production, as reflected by the better animation quality and the longer overall length. It has been broadcast across Japan by the anime [[satellite television]] network [[Animax]]. The film was licensed for North American release by [[ADV Films]].

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 to 700 words only. The plot summary does NOT intend to reproduce the experience of watching, nor is it meant to cover EVERY single detail. It should serve as an overview of the major plot elements and events.--&gt;
After the Separation in Japan in 1974 the northern island, [[Hokkaidō]] (or [[Ezo]], as it is called in the anime), was occupied by the "Union" (referring to the [[Soviet Union]]). Also in that same year, the Union began the construction of a strange tower on Hokkaido designed by a scientist named Ekusun Tsukinoe. The anime follows the story of three friends living in [[Aomori Prefecture|Aomori]], in northern Japan: two boys, Hiroki Fujisawa and Takuya Shirakawa, both [[child prodigies]]; and one girl, Sayuri Sawatari. In 1996, the three are in [[ninth grade]], their last year of [[middle school]], and they are fascinated by the Hokkaido Tower visible across the [[Tsugaru Strait]] to the north. Sayuri becomes close friends with the two boys.

The boys find a crashed [[Maritime Self-Defense Force]] [[drone plane]] and work on rebuilding the plane with the support of Mr. Okabe, their boss at a military plant. The three teenagers promise to one day fly to Hokkaido to visit the Tower. However, before they can do this, Sayuri mysteriously disappears during the summer.

Three years later, Takuya and Hiroki have stopped working on the plane, having taken different paths after the grief they suffered at Sayuri's disappearance. Takuya is working as a [[physicist]] at an Alliance scientific facility sponsored by the [[United States]]' [[National Security Agency]], researching parallel universes alongside Ms. Maki Kasahara under the supervision of Professor Tomizawa. They know that the Hokkaido Tower, which began operating in 1996, replaces matter around it with matter from other universes, but they do not yet know why it does this for only a 2-km radius. Takuya becomes involved with the Uilta Liberation Front after he learns that Mr. Okabe is its leader; his factory workers are the other agents of the organization. Okabe signs Takuya on for an excursion to Ezo with Uilta.

Sayuri is revealed to have been hospitalized over the past three years, having developed an extreme form of [[narcolepsy]]; she has been sleeping continuously for most of the three years. Her mind is trapped in an unpopulated parallel universe, where she is all alone. Tomizawa has discovered that she is somehow connected to the Union's research into parallel universes and the Hokkaido Tower's ability to change the surrounding land into alternate possibilities, but Tomizawa keeps this information, as well as her whereabouts, secret from Takuya initially. Tomizawa is secretly working with the Uilta Liberation Front and lets Mr. Okabe know about Sayuri, while Mr. Okabe reveals that the Uilta Liberation Front plans to bomb the Hokkaido Tower to incite war against the Union, hoping that this will lead to the reunification of Japan.

Takuya finally learns of the most likely scenario through his coworker – that Sayuri was used by her grandfather, a Union physicist, to channel all of the Tower's unstable dimension-creating energy somewhere other than Earth, the implication of him not having done so likely having resulted in the dimension creating chain reactions around the tower to continue growing in area until it enveloped the whole world. Saddened, he goes back to the old warehouse where he and Hiroki were working on the plane, only to find Hiroki, who wants Takuya to help him complete the plane to save Sayuri. He coldly points a gun at Hiroki and has him choose between Sayuri and the World without waiting for an answer – walking away in pain.

With Okabe's guidance, Takuya locks up his coworker and takes Sayuri away from the NSA compound – Takuya and Hiroki finally come back together to work on the plane. Takuya helps to finish the final programming of the plane, as they plan, using the cover of the soon coming declaration of war against Ezo, to fly to the tower and destroy it before its rays affect everything on Earth, which in turn will save Sayuri.

The plane only seats two, so Takuya allows Hiroki to pilot the plane and fulfill their childhood promise. Hiroki manages to fly the plane across the strait to the Tower carrying Sayuri and a missile provided by the Uilta Liberation Front. When Sayuri finally awakens while the plane circles the Tower, the Tower activates and immediately begins to transform the surrounding area; the area under transformation grows to encompass much of Hokkaido. In the last few minutes of her coma, Sayuri realizes that when she awakes she will lose all her memories of her dreams of the past 3 years, and thus upon waking she weeps because, unknowingly, she lost the memory of her love for Hiroki. Flying back, Hiroki fires the missile, destroying the Tower and stopping the matter transformation. The film ends with Hiroki vowing to Sayuri that they will start their relationship anew.

==Allusions==
The film includes several references to other literary works and themes, such as separation and dreams. The poem read by Sayuri in class is {{nihongo|''Eiketsu no Asa''|永訣の朝|''Morning of the Last Farewell''}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.ix.netcom.com/~kyamazak/lit/_Jpoet/miyazawa_eiketu.htm|title=Miyazawa Kenji's "Eiketsu no Asa"|publisher=|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the poem collection {{nihongo|''Haru to Shura''|春と修羅|''[[:ja:春と修羅|Spring and Asura]]''}} by a well-known Japanese writer [[Kenji Miyazawa]] (1896–1933). It was written on the occasion of the premature death of his sister, Toshi Miyazawa (1898–1922). Furthermore, during the summer sequence of the film, Sayuri is seen reading a novel titled {{nihongo|"The Net Involved in a Dream"|"夢網"|"Dream Net"}} by Morishita Sakae. Although the author is fictional, a book of the same name &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bk1.jp/product/1949604?partnerid=p-gok30121|title=夢網|work=honto|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; exists by a similarly named poet, Hoshio Sakae.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:ほしおさなえ]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A reference to the director's previous work is made when Takuya and Hiroki meet at the station. They see a cat which Takuya calls Chobi, the name of the cat from ''[[She and Her Cat]]''.

A '''tool library''' allow patrons to check out or borrow tools, equipment and "how-to" instructional materials, functioning either as a rental shop, with a charge for borrowing the tools, or more commonly free of charge as a form of [[The commons|community sharing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.monitorsaintpaul.com/st-paul-tool-library-soon-to-open-in-midway/|title=St. Paul Tool Library soon to open in Midway|last=O'Loughlin|first=Margie|date=September 5, 2016|work=|newspaper=[[Midway-Como-North End Monitor|Midway Como Monitor]]|issue=3|volume=42|page=1|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tool library performs the following main tasks:
*Lending: all kinds of tools for use in volunteer projects, facility maintenance and improvement projects, community improvement events, and special events.
*Advocacy: for the complete and timely return of all borrowed tools, to guarantee the long-term sustainability of available inventory. Staff also seeks compensation for lost tools and tools returned late.
*Maintenance: performing [[Planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] and repairs on all equipment to ensure good condition and to extend the lifespan of the inventory. This function is typically performed by volunteers and community service workers.

== History ==
A tool lending library was started in [[Columbus, OH]] in 1976. Originally run by the city, the tool library is now operated by Rebuilding Together Central Ohio, a non-profit organization that works to preserve and revitalize homes and communities in Central Ohio. The RTCO Tool Library makes available over 4,500 tools free of charge to both individuals and non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Weiker, Jim (October 18, 2009). "[http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/home_garden/stories/2009/10/18/6a_WEIK18.ART_ART_10-18-09_H1_SPFC48T.html?sid=101 Tool Library welcomes borrows in Columbus]." ''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; This tool library was among many in what could maybe be considered the first generation of tool libraries - including The Phinney Tool Library in 1978 and The Berkeley Tool Library in 1979 - most of which were founded in the late 70s or early 80s. Many of these libraries were started with community block grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 |title= Library Dispenses Tools and Home-Repair Advice
 |publisher=[[Berkeley Daily Planet]]
 |date=August 19, 2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variation of the tool lending library model exists in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. At the Atlanta Community [[ToolBank]], the tools are reserved for use only by nonprofits and other community-based organizations who are performing volunteer and facility maintenance projects. The ToolBank tool inventory is not available to individuals.

In 2009, the community of [[West Seattle]] in Washington started the West Seattle Tool Library, which provides a wide variety of tools and resources for individuals and organizations while specifically encouraging sustainable urban living. In 2011, Popular Mechanics recognized "Building a Local Tool Library" as one of its top ten ways to change the world, while highlighting the West Seattle Tool Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to-plans/diy-heroes-10-backyard-builders-changing-the-world#slide-1|title=DIY Heroes: 10 Backyard Builders Changing the World|last=DeMatto|first=Amanda|date=|publisher=|access-date=|work=Popular Mechanics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to that recognition, "Share Starter" began to offer a free "Tool Library Starter Kit" to any community interested in starting a lending library of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shareable.net/blog/how-to-start-a-tool-library|title=How to Start a Tool Library|last=Dunn|first=Patrick|date=May 9, 2012|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2016|work=Shareable}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The kit includes start up guidelines, frequently asked questions, and sample documents. Additionally, the [[Center for a New American Dream]] published a [[Web conferencing|webinar]] which highlighted insights from a handful of tool libraries on how to get started.

Given their increasing popularity and proven history of success, tool libraries and tool banks are now playing a role in the sharing economy and can be found in local [[Public library|public libraries]] and [[Hackerspace|makerspaces]], for instance. There are software platforms for managing tool and other types of lending libraries.

Its declared purpose is to contribute to peace and security by promoting international collaboration through educational, scientific, and cultural reforms in order to increase universal respect for justice, the [[rule of law]], and [[human rights]] along with fundamental [[freedom (political)|freedom]] proclaimed in the [[United Nations Charter]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/about-us/who-we-are/history/ |title=UNESCO history |publisher=UNESCO  |accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is the successor of the [[League of Nations]]' [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]].

UNESCO has [[Member states of UNESCO|195 member states]]&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO's General Conference voted on 31 October 2011 "to admit Palestine as a member State".

UNESCO pursues its objectives through five major programs: [[education]], [[natural science]]s, [[social science|social]]/[[human science]]s, culture and communication/information. Projects sponsored by UNESCO include [[literacy]], technical, and teacher-training programs, international science programs, the promotion of independent media and [[freedom of the press]], regional and cultural history projects, the promotion of [[cultural diversity]], translations of world literature, international cooperation agreements to secure the world's [[cultural heritage|cultural]] and [[natural heritage]] ([[World Heritage site]]s) and to preserve human rights, and attempts to bridge the [[Global digital divide|worldwide digital divide]].

[[File:Flag of UNESCO.svg|thumb|[[Flag of UNESCO]]]]
UNESCO and its mandate for international cooperation can be traced back to a League of Nations resolution on 21 September 1921, to elect a Commission to study feasibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = League of Nations | series = Records of the Second Assembly | title = Plenary Meetings | date = 5 September – 5 October 1921 | place = Geneva}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] (ICIC) was officially created on 4 January 1922, as a consultative organ composed of individuals elected based on their personal qualifications.  The International Institute for Intellectual Cooperation (IIIC) was then created in Paris on 9 August 1925, to act as the executing agency for the ICIC | title = A Chronology of UNESCO: 1945–1987|url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000790/079049eb.pdf | place = Paris | date = December 1987 | id = LAD.85/WS/4 Rev | series = UNESDOC database |format= PDF | ref = {{Harvid | UNESCO |1987}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 18 December 1925, the [[International Bureau of Education]] (IBE) began work as a [[non-governmental]] organization in the service of international educational development.{{Sfn | UNESCO | 1987}}  However, the onset of [[World War II]] largely interrupted the work of these predecessor organizations.

After the signing of the [[Atlantic Charter]] and the [[Declaration of the United Nations]], the Conference of Allied Ministers of Education (CAME) began meetings in London which continued from 16 November 1942 to 5 December 1945.  On 30 October 1943, the necessity for an international organization was expressed in the Moscow Declaration, agreed upon by China, the United Kingdom, the United States and the USSR.  This was followed by the [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference]] proposals of 9 October 1944.  Upon the proposal of CAME and in accordance with the recommendations of the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] (UNCIO), held in San Francisco in April–June 1945, a United Nations Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF) was convened in London 1–16 November 1945 with 44 governments represented. The idea of UNESCO was largely developed by [[Rab Butler]], the [[Minister of Education]] for the United Kingdom, who had a great deal of influence in its development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1949/jan/26/the-work-of-unesco  The work of U.N.E.S.C.O. (Hansard, 26 January 1949)].  Millbank systems. Retrieved 12 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At the ECO/CONF, the Constitution of UNESCO was introduced and signed by 37 countries, and a Preparatory Commission was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | ref = {{Harvid | Unesco | 1945}} |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001176/117626e.pdf |title= United Nations Conference for the Establishment of an Educational and Cultural Organisation.

The first General Conference took place from 19 November to 10 December 1946, and elected Dr. [[Julian Huxley]] to Director-General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001145/114580e.pdf | publisher =UNESCO | year = 1947 | title = General Conference, First Session | place = UNESCO House, Paris, from 20 November to 10 December 1946.

As member states worked together over time to realize UNESCO's mandate, political and historical factors have shaped the organization's operations in particular during the Cold War, the decolonization process, and the dissolution of the USSR.

Among the major achievements of the organization is its work against racism, for example through influential [[The Race Question|statements on race]] starting with a declaration of anthropologists (among them was [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]) and other scientists in 1950&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001269/126969eb.pdf |title = UNESCO.

UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1956, the Republic of South Africa withdrew from UNESCO claiming that some of the organization's publications amounted to "interference" in the country's "racial problems."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO.

Part I Relations with Member States, paragraph 3.&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa rejoined the organization in 1994 under the leadership of [[Nelson Mandela]].

UNESCO's early work in the field of education included the pilot project on fundamental education in the Marbial Valley, Haiti, started in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;The Haiti pilot project: phase one, 1947–1949. (1951). Monographs on Fundamental Education IV. UNESCO: Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;
This project was followed by expert missions to other countries, including, for example, a mission to Afghanistan in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0005/000590/059046eb.pdf |title = Debiesse, J., Benjamin, H. and Abbot, W.

In 1948, UNESCO recommended that Member States should make free primary education compulsory and universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001145/114591e.pdf#xml=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?database=&amp;set=4CFE6AEC_1_103&amp;hits_rec=1&amp;hits_lng=eng |title=UNESCO.

In 1990, the World Conference on Education for All, in [[Jomtien]], Thailand, launched a global movement to provide basic education for all children, youths and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000975/097551e.pdf |title=UNDP, UNESCO, UNICEF, and The World Bank.

Ten years later, the 2000 [[World Education Forum]] held in [[Dakar]], Senegal, led member governments to commit to achieving basic education for all by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001211/121147e.pdf |title=UNESCO.

UNESCO's early activities in culture included, for example, the Nubia Campaign, launched in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000419/041943eb.pdf |title=UNESCO.

UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The purpose of the campaign was to move the [[Great and Small Temples of Abu Simbel|Great Temple of Abu Simbel]] to keep it from being swamped by the Nile after construction of the [[Aswan Dam]]. During the 20-year campaign, 22 monuments and architectural complexes were relocated. This was the first and largest in a series of campaigns including [[Mohenjo-daro]] (Pakistan), [[Fes]] (Morocco), [[Kathmandu]] (Nepal), [[Borobudur]] (Indonesia) and the [[Acropolis]] (Greece).
The organization's work on heritage led to the adoption, in 1972, of the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001140/114044e.pdf |title=Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.

The [[World Heritage Committee]] was established in 1976 and the first sites inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000347/034793eb.pdf |title=UNESCO.

Since then important legal instruments on cultural heritage and diversity have been adopted by UNESCO member states in 2003 (Convention for the Safeguarding of the [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001331/133171e.pdf |title=Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage.

An intergovernmental meeting of UNESCO in Paris in December 1951 led to the creation of the European Council for Nuclear Research, which was responsible for establishing the [[European Organization for Nuclear Research]] (CERN)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001137/113790e.pdf |title=UNESCO.

Arid Zone programming, 1948–1966, is another example of an early major UNESCO project in the field of natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001145/114593e.pdf |title=UNESCO.

In 1968, UNESCO organized the first intergovernmental conference aimed at reconciling the environment and development, a problem which continues to be addressed in the field of sustainable development. The main outcome of the 1968 conference was the creation of UNESCO's [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000677/067785eo.pdf |title="Use and conservation of the biosphere: Proceedings of the intergovernmental conference of experts on the scientific basis for rational use and conservation of the resources of the biosphere.

In the field of communication, the "free flow of ideas by word and image" has been in UNESCO's constitution from its beginnings, following the experience of the Second World War when control of information was a factor in indoctrinating populations for aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002269/226924e.pdf#page=6|title=Constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the years immediately following World War II, efforts were concentrated on reconstruction and on the identification of needs for means of mass communication around the world. UNESCO started organizing training and education for journalists in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001480/148006eb.pdf |title=UNESCO. (1955).

UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In response to calls for a "[[New World Information and Communication Order]]" in the late 1970s, UNESCO established the International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000323/032363eb.pdf |title=UNESCO. General Conference, 19th Session. (1977). Approved Programme and budget for 1977–1978. Paris, February 1977. 19 C/5, p. 332, paragraphs 4154 and 4155. UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which produced the 1980 [[MacBride report]] (named after the Chair of the Commission, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Seán MacBride]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000400/040066eb.pdf |title=MacBride, S. (1980). Many voices, one world: towards a new, more just, and more efficient world information and communication order. (UNESCO: Paris). UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same year, UNESCO created the [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] (IPDC), a multilateral forum designed to promote media development in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/intergovernmental-programmes/ipdc/about-ipdc/|title=About IPDC {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/intergovernmental-programmes/ipdc/homepage/|title=International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, UNESCO's General Conference endorsed the [[Windhoek Declaration]] on [[media independence]] and pluralism, which led the UN General Assembly to declare the date of its adoption, 3 May, as [[World Press Freedom Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.unesco.org/world-press-freedom-day-2016/|title=World Press Freedom Day 2016|website=UNESCO|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, UNESCO has awarded the [[UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize|UNESCO / Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize]] every 3 May. In the lead up to the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in 2003 ([[Geneva]]) and 2005 ([[Tunis]]), UNESCO introduced the [[Information for All Programme]].

UNESCO admitted Palestine as a member in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/general_conference_admits_palestine_as_unesco_member_state/|title=General Conference admits Palestine as UNESCO Member |date = 31 October 2011 |accessdate = 11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/8860951/US-withdraws-Unesco-funding-after-it-accepts-Palestinian-membership.html |title = US withdraws Unesco funding after it accepts Palestinian membership |first = Adrian |last=Blomfield |work=The Telegraph |date=31 October 2011 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://opendata.unesco.org UNESCO transparency portal] has been designed to enable public access to information regarding Organization's activities, such as its aggregate budget for a biennium, as well as links to relevant programmatic and financial documents. These two distinct sets of information are published on the [[International Aid Transparency Initiative|IATI]] registry, respectively based on the IATI Activity Standard and the IATI Organization Standard.

There have been proposals to establish two new UNESCO lists. The first proposed list will focus on movable cultural heritage such as artifacts, paintings, and biofacts. The list may include cultural objects, such as the [[Jōmon Venus]] of [[Japan]], the [[Mona Lisa]] of [[France]], the [[Gebel el-Arak Knife]] of [[Egypt]], [[The Ninth Wave]] of [[Russia]], the [[Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük]] of [[Turkey]], the [[David (Michelangelo)]] of [[Italy]], the [[Mathura Herakles]] of [[India]], the [[Manunggul Jar]] of the Philippines, the [[Crown of Baekje]] of [[South Korea]], [[The Hay Wain]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Benin Bronzes]] of [[Nigeria]]. The second proposed list will focus on the world's living species, such as the [[Komodo Dragon]] of [[Indonesia]], the [[Panda]] of China, the [[Bald eagle]] of [[North America]]n countries, the [[Aye-aye]] of [[Madagascar]], the [[Asiatic Lion]] of [[India]], the [[Kakapo]] of [[New Zealand]], and the [[Mountain tapir]] of [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/cairo/culture/tangible-cultural-heritage/|title=Tangible Cultural Heritage - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/documents/114908|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - Document - Discovered artifacts under preservation, Archaeological Site, 18 Hoang Dieu street|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
UNESCO and its specialized institutions issue a number of magazines.

''The UNESCO Courier'' magazine states its mission to "promote UNESCO’s ideals, maintain a platform for the dialogue between cultures and provide a forum for international debate." Since March 2006 it is available online, with limited printed issues. Its articles express the opinions of the authors which are not necessarily the opinions of UNESCO. There was a hiatus in publishing between 2012 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/courier/archives|title=Archives|website = The UNESCO Courier|publisher = United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate = 14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, UNESCO initiated the quarterly review ''Impact of Science on Society'' (also known as ''Impact'') to discuss the influence of science on society. The journal ceased publication in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unesco.org/education/nfsunesco/brochure/E29.PDF |title = Science and Technology Education|publisher = UNESCO |date = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO also published museum international quarterly from the year 1948.

==Official UNESCO NGOs==
UNESCO has official relations with 322 [[international non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngo-db.unesco.org/s/or/en |title=Quoted on UNESCO official site |publisher=Ngo-db.unesco.org |accessdate=1 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625221827/http://ngo-db.unesco.org/s/or/en |archivedate=25 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these are what UNESCO calls "operational"; a select few are "formal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=35293&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Full list of NGOs that have official relations with UNESCO |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governing bodies==

===Director-General===
There has been no elected UNESCO Director-General from Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central and North Asia, Middle East, North Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, South Africa, Australia-Oceania, and South America since inception.

The Director-Generals of UNESCO came from West Europe (5), Central America (1), North America (2), West Africa (1), East Asia (1), and East Europe (1). Out of the 11 Director-Generals since inception, women have held the position only twice. [[Qatar]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Iran]] are proposing for a Director-General bid by 2021 or 2025. There have never been a Middle Eastern or Southeast Asian UNESCO Director-General since inception. The [[ASEAN]] bloc and some Pacific and Latin American nations support the possible bid of the Philippines, which is culturally Asian, Oceanic, and Latin. Qatar and Iran, on the other hand, have fragmented support in the Middle East. [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], and [[Madagascar]] are also vying for the position but have yet to express a direct or indirect proposal. Both Qatar and Egypt lost in the 2017 bid against France.

The list of the Directors-General of UNESCO since its establishment in 1946 is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO official site: [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/about-us/who-we-are/history/directors-general/ Directors-General]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===New World Information and Communication order===
UNESCO has been the centre of controversy in the past, particularly in its relationships with the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Singapore]] and the former [[Soviet Union]]. During the 1970s and 1980s, UNESCO's support for a "[[New World Information and Communication Order]]" and its [[MacBride report]] calling for democratization of the media and more egalitarian access to information was condemned in these countries as attempts to curb [[freedom of the press]].  UNESCO was perceived as a platform for communists and Third World dictators to attack the West, in contrast to accusations made by the USSR in the late 1940s and early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Grahm |first=S. E. |date= April 2006 |title= The (Real)politiks of Culture: U.S. Cultural Diplomacy in UNESCO, 1946–1954 |journal=Diplomatic History |volume= 30 |issue=2 |pages=231–51 |doi= 10.1111/j.1467-7709.2006.00548.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984, the United States withheld its contributions and withdrew from the organization in protest, followed by the United Kingdom in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A4079804/AONE?u=tamp44898&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=ef6d5640 | title = UNESCO asks states considering withdrawal to 'reconsider their position' | journal = [[UN Chronicle (journal)|UN Chronicle]] | date = January 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Singapore withdrew also at the end of 1985, citing rising membership fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19841228&amp;id=Y5srAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qPoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5684,5359479 | title = Singapore to withdraw from UNESCO | newspaper = [[The Telegraph (newspaper)|The Telegraph]] | date = 28 December 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following a change of government in 1997, the UK rejoined. The United States rejoined in 2003, followed by Singapore on 8 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.britannica.com/topic/UNESCO | title = UNESCO | website = Encyclopedia Britannica | date = 14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
[[Israel]] was admitted to UNESCO in 1949, one year after its creation. Israel has maintained its membership since 1949.
In 2010, Israel designated the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]], [[Hebron]] and [[Rachel's Tomb]], [[Bethlehem]] as [[List of National Heritage Sites of Israel|National Heritage Sites]] and announced restoration work, prompting criticism from the United States and protests from Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hebron clashes over Israel's West Bank heritage list|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8538948.stm|date=26 February 2010|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, UNESCO's Executive Board voted to declare the sites as "al-Haram al-Ibrahimi/Tomb of the Patriarchs" and "Bilal bin Rabah Mosque/Rachel's Tomb" and stated that they were "an integral part of the [[occupied Palestinian Territories]]" and any unilateral Israeli action was a violation of [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/executive_board_adopts_five_decisions_concerning_unescos_work_in_the_occupied_palestinian_and_arab_territories/|title=Executive Board adopts five decisions concerning UNESCO's work in the occupied Palestinian and Arab Territories|date=21 October 2010|publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;
UNESCO described the sites as significant to "people of the Muslim, Christian and Jewish traditions", and accused Israel of highlighting only the Jewish character of the sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE TWO PALESTINIAN SITES OF AL-HARAM AL-IBRAHIMI/TOMB OF THE PATRIARCHS IN AL-KHALIL/HEBRON AND THE BILAL BIN RABAH MOSQUE/RACHEL'S TOMB IN BETHLEHEM|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001873/187356e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Israel in turn accused UNESCO of "detach[ing] the Nation of Israel from its heritage", and accused it of being politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/140377 |title=UNESCO Erases Israeli Protests from Rachel's Tomb Protocol |date=1 November 2010 |publisher=Arutz Sheva |author=Hillel Fendel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Shmuel Rabinovitch|Rabbi of the Western Wall]] claimed that Rachel's tomb had not previously been declared a holy Muslim site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/news.aspx/140345|title=UN Org.: Rachel's Tomb is a Mosque |date=29 October 2010|publisher=Arutz Sheva|author=Maayana Miskin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel partially suspended ties with UNESCO. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister [[Danny Ayalon]] declared that the resolution was a "part of Palestinian escalation".
[[Zevulun Orlev]], chairman of the [[Knesset]] Education and Culture Committee, referred to the resolutions as an attempt to undermine the mission of UNESCO as a scientific and cultural organization that promotes cooperation throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=193893 |title=Ayalon: Israel will no longer cooperate with UNESCO |date=3 November 2010 |work=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shalom |first=Rabbi |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=194090 |title=Cooperation with UNESCO only partially suspended |work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 2011, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee, at [[Jordan]]'s insistence, censured{{clarify|date=October 2016}} Israel's decision to demolish and rebuild the [[Mughrabi-Bridge|Mughrabi Gate]] Bridge in Jerusalem for safety reasons. Israel stated that Jordan had signed an agreement with Israel stipulating that the existing bridge must be dismantled for safety reasons; Jordan disputed the agreement, saying that it was only signed under U.S. pressure. Israel was also unable to address the UNESCO committee over objections from [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4088221,00.html |title=UNESCO censures Israel over Mughrabi Bridge – Israel News, Ynetnews |work=Ynetnews |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, days before it was scheduled to open, UNESCO Director-General, [[Irina Bokova]], "indefinitely postponed" and effectively cancelled an exhibit created by the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] entitled "The People, The Book, The Land: The 3,500-year relationship between the [[History of the Jews and Judaism in the Land of Israel|Jewish people and the Land of Israel]]." The event was scheduled to run from 21 January through 30 January in Paris. Bokova cancelled the event after representatives of Arab states at UNESCO argued that its display would "harm the [[Arab-Israeli peace process|peace process]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berman|first=Lazar|title=UNESCO cancels event on Jewish ties to Land of Israel|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/unesco-cancels-event-on-jewish-ties-to-land-of-israel/|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the exhibition, Professor [[Robert Wistrich]] of the [[Hebrew University]]'s [[Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism]], called the cancellation an "appalling act," and characterized Bokova's decision as "an arbitrary act of total cynicism and, really, contempt for the Jewish people and its history." UNESCO amended the decision to cancel the exhibit within the year, and it quickly achieved popularity and was viewed as a great success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahren|first=Raphael|title=Author of UNESCO's nixed Israel exhibit decries 'appalling betrayal'|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/author-of-unescos-nixed-israel-exhibit-decries-appalling-betrayal|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occupied Palestine Resolution====
{{Main article|Occupied Palestine Resolution}}
On 13 October 2016, UNESCO passed a resolution on East Jerusalem that condemned Israel for "aggressions" by Israeli police and soldiers and "illegal measures" against the freedom of worship and Muslims' access to their holy sites, while also recognizing Israel as the occupying power. Palestinian leaders welcomed the decision.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=UNESCO adopts anti-Israel resolution on al-Aqsa Mosque|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/unesco-adopts-anti-israel-resolution-al-aqsa-mosque-161018120610946.html|work=aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the text acknowledged the "importance of the Old City of Jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions", it referred to the sacred hilltop compound in Jerusalem's Old City only by its Muslim name "Al-Haram al-Sharif", Arabic for Noble Sanctuary. In response, Israel denounced the UNESCO resolution for its omission of the words "Temple Mount" or "Har HaBayit," stating that it [[Temple denial|denies Jewish ties to the key holy site]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002462/246215e.pdf |title=Commission report|website=unesdoc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving criticism from numerous Israeli politicians and diplomats, including [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and [[Ayelet Shaked]], Israel froze all ties with the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4866113,00.html|title=UNESCO fails to acknowledge Jewish ties to Temple Mount|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-leads-angry-denunciations-of-absurd-unesco-decision/|title=Netanyahu leads angry denunciations of ‘absurd’ UNESCO decision|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was condemned by [[Ban ki-Moon]] and the Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, who said that Judaism, Islam and Christianity have clear historical connections to Jerusalem and "to deny, conceal or erase any of the Jewish, Christian or Muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =  UNESCO chief ‘received death threats’ for opposing Jerusalem motion|url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/unesco-chief-received-death-threats-for-opposing-jerusalem-motion/|date = 17 October 2016|work= Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/statement_by_the_director_general_of_unesco_on_the_old_city-1/#.WAQnmeUrLb3|title=Statement by the Director-General of UNESCO on the Old City of Jerusalem and its Walls on the occasion of the 40th session of the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO in Istanbul - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Aqsa Mosque is also Temple Mount, whose Western Wall is the holiest place in Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.747466|title=UNESCO Director Criticizes Resolution: Temple Mount Sacred to Both Jews, Muslims|work=Haaretz|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also rejected by the Czech Parliament which said the resolution reflects a "hateful [[anti-Israel]] sentiment",&lt;ref name="timesofisrael.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/czech-mps-slam-hateful-unesco-jerusalem-resolution/|title=Czech MPs slam ‘hateful’ UNESCO Jerusalem resolution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hundreds of Italian Jews demonstrated in Rome over Italy's abstention.&lt;ref name="timesofisrael.com"/&gt; On 26 October, UNESCO approved a reviewed version of the resolution, which also criticized Israel for its continuous "refusal to let the body's experts access Jerusalem's holy sites to determine their conservation status."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UNESCO approves new Jerusalem resolution|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/unesco-approves-anti-israel-resolution-jerusalem-161026173149575.html|work=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite containing some softening of language following Israeli protests over a previous version, Israel continued to denounce the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beaumont|first1=Peter|title=Unesco adopts controversial resolution on Jerusalem holy sites|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/unesco-adopts-controversial-resolution-on-jerusalem-holy-sites-israel|work=The Guardian|date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution refers to the site Jews and Christians refer to as the Temple Mount, or Har HaBayit in Hebrew, only by its Arab name — a significant semantic decision also adopted by UNESCO's executive board, triggering condemnation from Israel and its allies. U.S. Ambassador Crystal Nix Hines stated: "This item should have been defeated. These politicized and one-sided resolutions are damaging the credibility of UNESCO."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UNESCO resolution on Jerusalem holy sites draws criticism from U.S., Israel|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/unesco-resolution-holy-sites-un-1.3821919|work=CBC/Radio-Canada|date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the United States and Israel announced they would withdraw from the organization, citing in-part anti-Israel bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/10/274748.htm|title=The United States Withdraws From UNESCO|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Gardiner|last2=Erlangeroct|first2=Steven|title=U.S. Will Withdraw From Unesco, Citing Its ‘Anti-Israel Bias’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/us/politics/trump-unesco-withdrawal.html|accessdate=8 April 2018|agency=The New York Times|date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestine===

====Palestinian youth magazine controversy====
In February 2011, an article was published in a Palestinian youth magazine in which a teenage girl described one of her four role-models as [[Adolf Hitler]]. In December 2011, UNESCO, which partly funded the magazine, condemned the material and subsequently withdrew support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/8975423/Unesco-cuts-funding-for-Palestinian-youth-magazine-over-Hitler-praise.html |title=Unesco cuts funding for Palestinian youth magazine over Hitler praise |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=23 December 2011 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islamic University of Gaza controversy====
In 2012, UNESCO decided to establish a chair at the [[Islamic University of Gaza]] in the field of [[astronomy]], [[astrophysics]], and [[space science]]s,&lt;ref name="UNESCOIslamicUniversity"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unesco.org/en/university-twinning-and-networking/access-by-region/arab-states/palestine/unesco-chair-in-astronomy-astrophysics-and-space-sciences-964/ | title=UNESCO Chair in Astronomy, Astrophysics and Space Sciences (964), established in 2012 at The Islamic University of Gaza (Palestine). | publisher=UNESCO | accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; fueling controversy and criticism.

===Wikileaks===
On 16 and 17 February 2012, UNESCO held a conference entitled "The Media World after [[WikiLeaks]] and [[News of the World]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/new_journalism_in_a_digital_world/ |title=News journalism in a digital world |publisher=UNESCO |date=10 February 2012 |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all six panels being focused on WikiLeaks, no member of WikiLeaks staff was invited to speak. After receiving a complaint from WikiLeaks spokesman [[Kristinn Hrafnsson]], UNESCO invited him to attend, but did not offer a place on any panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://issuu.com/unesconow/docs/unescoleaks_to_refute_wikileaks_accusations |title=UNESCO-leaks to refute wikileaks accusation| publisher=UNESCO | date=16 February 2012 | accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offer also came only a week before the conference, which was held in Paris, France. Many of the speakers featured, including [[David Leigh (journalist)|David Leigh]] and [[Heather Brooke]], had spoken out openly against WikiLeaks and its founder [[Julian Assange]] in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/mar2011/wiki-m10.shtml |title=The Guardian's hatchet job on Julian Assange |publisher=[[World Socialist Web Site]] |date=10 March 2011 |access-date=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks released a press statement on 15 February 2012 denouncing UNESCO which stated, "UNESCO has made itself an international human rights joke.

===Che Guevara===
In 2013, UNESCO announced that the collection "The Life and Works of Ernesto [[Che Guevara]]" became part of the [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]]. [[United States Congress|US Congresswoman]] [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] condemned this decision, saying that the organization acts against its own ideals:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://ros-lehtinen.house.gov/press-release/unesco-once-again-makes-mockery-its-own-ideals-glorifying-mass-murderer-che-guevara | type = press release | title = UNESCO Once Again Makes a Mockery of its Own Ideals by Glorifying Mass Murderer Che Guevara, Says Ros-Lehtinen | publisher = House of representatives | date = 22 July 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|sign=|source=|This decision is more than an insult to the families of those Cubans who were lined up and [[Summary execution|summarily executed]] by Che and his merciless cronies but it also serves as a direct contradiction to the UNESCO ideals of encouraging peace and universal respect for human rights.}}

[[UN Watch]] also condemned this selection by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwatch.org/unesco-honors-executioner-che-guevara/  UNESCO honors executioner Che Guevara], ''UN Watch'', 21 July 2013 (retrieved 11 July 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Listing Nanjing Massacre documents===
In 2015, [[Japan]] threatened to halt funding for UNESCO over the organization's decision to include documents relating to the 1937 [[Nanjing massacre]] in the latest listing for its "Memory of the World" program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/japan-furious-at-unesco-listing-nanjing-massacre-documents/a-18790477|title=Japan furious at UNESCO listing Nanjing Massacre documents - Asia - DW.COM - 19.10.2015|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2016, Japanese Foreign Minister [[Fumio Kishida]] confirmed that Japan's 2016 annual funding of ¥4.4 billion had been suspended although denied any direct link with the Nanjing document controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan halts Unesco funding following Nanjing massacre row|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/japan-halts-unesco-funding-nanjing-massacre-row|accessdate=30 October 2016|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=The Guardian|date=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US withdrawals===
After withdrawing from UNESCO in 1984, the United States rejoined January 10, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/worldwide/europe-and-north-america/united-states-of-america/|title=United States of America - United Nations Educational Scientific Cooperation Organization|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former U.S. Congressman [[Jim Leach]] stated before a Congressional subcommittee:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher = Library of Congress | series = Congressional subcommittee on International operations | date = September 19, 1989 | title = Expert Witness Statement transcript}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote |The reasons for the withdrawal of the United States from UNESCO in 1984 are well-known; my view is that we overreacted to the calls of some who wanted to radicalize UNESCO, and the calls of others who wanted the United States to lead in emasculating the UN system. The fact is UNESCO is one of the least dangerous international institutions ever created. While some member countries within UNESCO attempted to push journalistic views antithetical to the values of the west, and engage in Israel bashing, UNESCO itself never adopted such radical postures. The U.S. opted for empty-chair diplomacy, after winning, not losing, the battles we engaged in…  It was nuts to get out, and would be nuttier not to rejoin.}}

He concluded that the record showed Israel bashing, a call for a new world information order, money management, and arms control policy to be the impetus behind the withdrawal; he asserted that before the UNESCO withdrawal, a withdrawal from the [[IAEA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?9189-1/united-states-unesco-part-1|title=United States &amp; UNESCO Part 1, Sep 19 1989 - Video - C-SPAN.org|website=C-SPAN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been pushed on him. The United States rejoined UNESCO shortly thereafter.

On 12 October 2017, the United States notified UNESCO that it will again withdraw from the organization on 31 December 2018 and will seek to establish a permanent observer mission beginning in 2019. The [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] cited "mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias at UNESCO."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/10/274748.htm |title=The United States Withdraws From UNESCO| publisher =U.S. Department of State |access-date= 2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has not paid its $80 million annual UNESCO dues since Palestine became a full member in 2011. Israel and the US were among only 14 votes against the membership, of 194 member countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S., Israel quit UNESCO over alleged bias |author=John Irish| publisher=Globe and Mail |date=October 13, 2017 |page=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkish–Kurdish conflict===
On May 25, 2016, the noted Turkish poet and human rights activist [[O. Z. Livaneli|Zülfü Livaneli]] resigned as [[Turkey]]’s only UNESCO goodwill ambassador. He highlighted [[Human rights in Turkey|human rights situation in Turkey]] and destruction of historical [[Sur, Diyarbakır|Sur]] district of [[Diyarbakır|Diyarbakir]], the largest city in Kurdish-majority southeast Turkey, during [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (2015–present)|fighting]] between the Turkish army and Kurdish militants as the main reasons for his resignation. Livaneli said: "To pontificate on peace while remaining silent against such violations is a contradiction of the fundamental ideals of UNESCO."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-rights-un/turkish-writer-quits-unesco-to-protest-damage-to-heritage-rights-abuse-idUSKCN0YH1KA Turkish writer quits UNESCO to protest damage to heritage, rights abuse]".

[[File:Stuffed birds on etagere in Lyford House.jpg|A corner what-not|thumbnail|right|240px]]
A '''what-not''' is a piece of [[furniture]] derived from the [[France|French]] [[étagère]], which was exceedingly popular in [[England]] in the first three-quarters of the 19th century. It usually consists of slender uprights or pillars, supporting a series of shelves for holding china, ornaments, trifles, or "[[wikt:what not|what not]]", hence the allusive name. In its English form, it is a convenient piece of [[drawing room]] furniture, and was rarely valued for its aesthetic.

'''Woodstock''' was a music festival held on a dairy farm in the [[Catskill Mountains]], northwest of [[New York City]], between August 15–18, 1969, which attracted an audience of more than 400,000.&lt;ref name=pcandsh&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wjkVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LPgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7277%2C284925 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=(Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Peace and sharing dominate festival |date=August 18, 1969 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ctmafr&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/08/18/page/3/article/music-art-fair-ends-2-are-dead |work=Chicago Tribune |agency=UPI |title=Music, art fair ends; 2 are dead |date=August 18, 1969 |page=3, sec. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erggrfewo&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a9xVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8uADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6928%2C4284524 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |last=Rock |first=Naomi |title='Great' rock festival ends without violence |date=August 18, 1969 |page=4A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2258729|title = Woodstock Music and Arts Fair.|access-date = February 15, 2016|website = Oxford Music Online|publisher = Oxford University Press|last = Jesse|first = Jarnow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was captured in the [[Academy Award]]-winning [[1970 in film|1970]] documentary movie ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'', an accompanying [[Woodstock: Music from the Original Soundtrack and More|soundtrack album]], and [[Joni Mitchell]]'s song "[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]", which commemorated the event and became a major hit for both [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]] and [[Matthews Southern Comfort]]. Joni Mitchell said, "Woodstock was a spark of beauty" where half-a-million kids "saw that they were part of a greater organism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodstock.com/about/|title=About {{!}} Woodstock|website=www.woodstock.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, the festival site was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="NRHP listing"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places listings for March 10, 2017|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20170310.htm|publisher=[[U.S. National Park Service]]|date=March 10, 2017|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning and preparation==
Woodstock was initiated through the efforts of [[Michael Lang (producer)|Michael Lang]], [[Artie Kornfeld]], [[Joel Rosenman]], and [[John P. Roberts]]. Roberts and Rosenman financed the project. Lang had some experience as a promoter, having co-organized a festival on the East Coast the prior year, the [[Miami Pop Festival (May 1968)|Miami Pop Festival]], where an estimated 25,000 people attended the two-day event.

Early in 1969, Roberts and Rosenman were New York City entrepreneurs, in the process of building Media Sound, a large audio recording studio complex in Manhattan. Lang and Kornfeld's lawyer, Miles Lourie, who had done legal work on the Media Sound project, suggested that they contact Roberts and Rosenman about financing a similar, but much smaller, studio Kornfeld and Lang hoped to build in [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Unpersuaded by this Studio-in-the-Woods proposal, Roberts and Rosenman counter-proposed a concert featuring the kind of artists known to frequent the Woodstock area (such as [[Bob Dylan]] and [[The Band]]). Kornfeld and Lang agreed to the new plan, and Woodstock Ventures was formed in January 1969.&lt;ref name="Making Woodstock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenman |first=Joel |first2=John |last2=Roberts |first3=Robert |last3=Pilpel |title=Making Woodstock|date=1974|edition=Kindle eBook|url=https://www.amazon.com/Making-Woodstock-Joel-Rosenman-ebook/dp/B002KMI7H4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company offices were located in an oddly decorated floor of 47 West 57th Street in Manhattan. Burt Cohen, and his design group, Curtain Call Productions, oversaw the psychedelic transformation of the office.&lt;ref name=Perone&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perone|first1=James|title=Woodstock : an encyclopedia of the music and art fair|date=2005|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=0-313-33057-3|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the start, there were differences in approach among the four: Roberts was disciplined and knew what was needed for the venture to succeed, while the laid-back Lang saw Woodstock as a new, "relaxed" way of bringing entrepreneurs together.&lt;ref name="spitz-babylon"&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert Stephen |last=Spitz |title=Barefoot in Babylon |publisher=The Viking Press, New York |year=1979 |isbn=0-670-14801-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Lang was unable to find a site for the concert, Roberts and Rosenman, growing increasingly concerned, took to the road and eventually came up with a venue. Similar differences about financial discipline made Roberts and Rosenman wonder whether to pull the plug or to continue pumping money into the project.&lt;ref name="spitz-babylon" /&gt;

In April 1969, [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] became the first act to sign a contract for the event, agreeing to play for $10,000. The promoters had experienced difficulty landing big-name groups prior to Creedence committing to play. Creedence drummer [[Doug Clifford]] later commented, "Once Creedence signed, everyone else jumped in line and all the other big acts came on." Given their 3&amp;nbsp;a.m. start time and omission from the ''Woodstock'' film (at {{sic|hide=y|Creedence}} frontman [[John Fogerty]]'s insistence), {{sic|hide=y|Creedence}} members have expressed bitterness over their experiences regarding the festival.&lt;ref name="Bordowitz 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bordowitz |first=Hank |title=Bad Moon Rising: The Unauthorized History of Creedence Clearwater Revival|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Chicago |year=2007 |page=390 |isbn=1-55652-661-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodstock was designed as a profit-making venture. It famously became a "free concert" only after the event drew hundreds of thousands more people than the organizers had prepared for. Tickets for the three-day event cost $18 in advance and $24 at the gate (equivalent to about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|18|1969|r=-1}}}} and ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|24|1969|r=-1}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|US}}). Ticket sales were limited to record stores in the greater New York City area, or by mail via a post office box at the [[Radio City Music Hall|Radio City]] Station Post Office located in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Around 186,000 advance tickets were sold, and the organizers anticipated approximately 200,000 festival-goers would turn up.&lt;ref name="bbc-woodstockends"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/18/newsid_2760000/2760911.stm |department=On this Day: 1950–2005 |title=1969: Woodstock music festival ends |accessdate=April 17, 2008 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=August 18, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection of the venue===
The original venue plan was for the festival to take place in [[Wallkill, Orange County, New York|Wallkill, New York]], possibly near the proposed recording studio site owned by Alexander Tapooz. After local residents quickly shot down that idea, Lang and Kornfeld thought they had found another possible location in Saugerties, New York. But they had misunderstood, as the landowner's attorney made clear, in a brief meeting with Roberts and Rosenman.&lt;ref name="Making Woodstock"/&gt; Growing alarmed at the lack of progress, Roberts and Rosenman took over the search for a venue, and discovered the {{convert|300|acre|adj=on}} Mills Industrial Park ({{coord|41.477525|-74.36358|format=dms|name=Mills Industrial Park}}) in the town of Wallkill, New York, which Woodstock Ventures leased for $10,000 in the Spring of 1969.&lt;ref name="Tiber 1994-1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tiber |first=Elliot |url=http://www.discoverynet.com/~barnes/wsrprnt1.htm |title=How Woodstock Happened ...

Town residents immediately opposed the project. In early July, the Town Board passed a law requiring a permit for any gathering over 5,000 people. On July 15, 1969, the Wallkill Zoning Board of Appeals officially banned the concert on the basis that the planned [[portable toilet]]s would not meet town code.&lt;ref name="Tiber 1994-3"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tiber |first=Elliot |url=http://www.discoverynet.com/~barnes/wsrprnt3.htm |title=How Woodstock Happened ...

[[File:Yasgur farm in 1968.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Max Yasgur]]'s dairy farm in 1968]]
In his 2007 book ''[[Taking Woodstock (book)|Taking Woodstock]]'', [[Elliot Tiber]] relates that he offered to host the event on his {{convert|15|acre}} motel grounds, and had a permit for such an event. He claims to have introduced the promoters to dairy farmer Max Yasgur.&lt;ref name="TakingWoodstock"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tiber |first=Elliot |authorlink=Elliot Tiber |first2=Tom |last2=Monte |title=Taking Woodstock |publisher=SquareOne Publishers |year=2007 |location= |page= |url= |isbn=0-7570-0293-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lang, however, disputes Tiber's account and says that Tiber introduced him to a realtor, who drove him to Yasgur's farm without Tiber. [[Sam Yasgur]], Max's son, agrees with Lang's account.&lt;ref name="Newsday"&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Bleyer |title=The road to Woodstock runs through Sunken Meadow State Park. |date=August 8, 2009 |url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/road-to-woodstock-runs-through-sunken-meadow-1.1357820 |newspaper=[[Newsday]] |accessdate=August 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yasgur's land formed a natural bowl sloping down to Filippini Pond on the land's north side. The stage would be set up at the bottom of the hill with Filippini Pond forming a backdrop. The pond would become a popular [[skinny dipping]] destination.

The organizers once again told Bethel authorities they expected no more than 50,000 people.

Despite resident opposition and signs proclaiming, "Buy No Milk. Stop Max's Hippy Music Festival",&lt;ref name="Timesjuly"&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard F. |last=Shepard |title=Pop Rock Festival Finds New Home |date=July 23, 1969 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/07/23/archives/pop-rock-festival-finds-new-home.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=September 7, 2009 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bethel Town Attorney Frederick W. V. Schadt and building inspector Donald Clark approved the permits, but the Bethel Town Board refused to issue them formally. Clark was ordered to post stop-work orders.

The late change in venue did not give the festival organizers enough time to prepare. At a meeting three days before the event, organizers felt they had two options: one was to complete the fencing and ticket booths, without which the promoters would lose any profit or go into debt; the other option involved putting their remaining available resources into building the stage, without which the promoters feared they would have a disappointed and disgruntled audience. When the audience began arriving by the tens of thousands the next day, the Wednesday before the weekend, the decision was made for them. Those without tickets simply walked through gaps in the fences, and the organizers were forced to make the event free of charge. Though the festival left its promoters nearly bankrupt, their ownership of the film and recording rights more than compensated for the losses after the release of the hit [[Woodstock (film)|documentary film]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="Making Woodstock"/&gt;

==The festival==
[[File:Woodstock redmond crowd.JPG|thumb|Part of the crowd on the first day of the festival]]
The influx of attendees to the rural concert site in Bethel created a massive traffic jam. Fearing chaos as thousands began descending on the community, Bethel did not enforce its codes.&lt;ref name="Tiber 1994-3" /&gt; Eventually, announcements on radio stations as far away as [[WNEW-FM]] in Manhattan and descriptions of the traffic jams on television news discouraged people from setting off to the festival.&lt;ref name=Nowandthen/&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times Aug 16, 1969"&gt;{{cite news |last=Collier |first=Barnard L. |title=200,000 Thronging To Rock Festival Jam Roads Upstate |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0715F73C5D1A7B93C4A81783D85F4D8685F9 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |pages=1, 31 |date=August 16, 1969 |subscription=yes}} A state police official said, "We're just going to reroute everybody; Sullivan County is filled up."{{clarify|reason=Is this a quotation from the NY Times article or an editor's commentary?|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arlo Guthrie]] made an announcement that was included in the film saying that the [[New York State Thruway]] was closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |year=1970 |title=Woodstock |medium=Motion picture |time= |publisher=[[Warner Brothers]] |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of the Woodstock museum discussed below said this never occurred.&lt;ref name="APhappy40th"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Hill |title=Happy 40th birthday Woodstock baby, if you exist |date=July 17, 2009 |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2009486830_apuswoodstockbaby.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To add to the problems and difficulty in dealing with the large crowds, recent rains had caused muddy roads and fields. The facilities were not equipped to provide sanitation or first aid for the number of people attending; hundreds of thousands found themselves in a struggle against bad weather, food shortages, and poor sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Doyle |first=Michael William |url=http://www.woodstockpreservation.org/SignificanceStatement.htm |title=Statement on the Historical and Cultural Significance of the 1969 Woodstock Festival Site |date=September 25, 2001 |website=Woodstock – Preservation Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of Sunday, August 17, New York [[Governor of New York|Governor]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]] called festival organizer [[John P. Roberts|John Roberts]] and told him he was thinking of ordering 10,000 [[New York State National Guard]] troops to the festival. Roberts was successful in persuading Rockefeller not to do this. [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan County]] declared a [[state of emergency]].&lt;ref name=Nowandthen/&gt; During the festival, personnel from nearby [[Stewart Air Force Base]] assisted in helping to ensure order and airlifting performers in and out of the concert venue.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Evans |editor-first=Mike |editor2-last=Kingsbury |editor2-first=Paul |title=Woodstock: Three Days That Rocked the World |year=2010 |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |isbn=1402780346 |page=225 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eO8oChHYDhMC&amp;pg=PA225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jimi Hendrix]] was the last act to perform at the festival. Because of the rain delays that Sunday, when Hendrix finally took the stage it was 8:30&amp;nbsp;Monday morning. The audience, which had peaked at an estimated 400,000 during the festival, was now reduced to about 30,000 by that point; many of them merely waited to catch a glimpse of Hendrix before leaving during his performance.&lt;ref name= ShapiroGlebbeek1995 &gt;{{cite book |first=Harry |last=Shapiro |first2=Caesar |last2=Glebbeek |title=Jimi Hendrix, Electric Gypsy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JB1W2dn31rwC&amp;pg=PA384 |year=1995 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-312-13062-6 |pages=384–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrix and his new band, Gypsy Sun and Rainbows (introduced as [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience|The Experience]], but corrected by Hendrix) &lt;ref&gt;Room Full of Mirrors-Cross, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; performed a two-hour set. His [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] rendition of the U.S. national anthem, "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" occurred about three-quarters into the set (after which he segued into "Purple Haze"). The song would become "part of the sixties [[Zeitgeist]]" as it was captured forever in the Woodstock film;&lt;ref&gt;Cross, p. 272{{clarify |reason=this short form reference lacks a matching citation; |date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hendrix's image performing this number wearing a blue-beaded white leather jacket with fringe and a red head scarf has since been regarded as a defining moment of the 1960s.&lt;ref name=ShapiroGlebbeek1995 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Daley |editor-last=Inglis |editor-first=Ian |chapter=Chapter5: Land of the Free.

And this is the moment I will never forget as long as I live: A quarter mile away in the darkness, on the other edge of this bowl, there was some guy flicking his Bic, and in the night I hear, 'Don't worry about it, John. We're with you.' I played the rest of the show for that guy.

Although the festival was remarkably peaceful given the number of people and the conditions involved, there were two recorded fatalities: one from insulin usage, and another caused in an accident when a tractor ran over an attendee sleeping in a nearby hayfield. There also were two births recorded at the event (one in a car caught in traffic and another in a hospital after an airlift by helicopter) and four miscarriages.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |first=Barnard L. |last=Collier |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0817.html |title=Tired Rock Fans Begin Exodus |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 18, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral testimony in the film supports the overdose and run-over deaths and at least one birth, along with many logistical headaches.

Yet, in tune with the idealistic hopes of the 1960s, Woodstock satisfied most attendees. There was a sense of social harmony, which, with the quality of music, and the overwhelming mass of people, many sporting [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] dress, behavior, and attitudes, helped to make it one of the enduring events of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Andy |editor-last=Bennett |first=Simon |last=Warner |title=Remembering Woodstock |chapter= |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |date=May 2004 |isbn=0-7546-0714-3 |page=}}{{page needed |date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the concert, Max Yasgur, who owned the site of the event, saw it as a victory of peace and love. He spoke of how nearly half a million people filled with potential for disaster, riot, looting, and catastrophe spent the three days with music and peace on their minds. He stated, "If we join them, we can turn those adversities that are the problems of America today into a hope for a brighter and more peaceful future ... "&lt;ref name="spitz-babylon" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Original woodstock poster.jpg|upright|thumb|The Original Woodstock Poster with the [[Wallkill, Orange County, New York|Wallkill, New York]] location]] --&gt;
Sound for the concert was engineered by sound engineer [[Bill Hanley (sound engineer)|Bill Hanley]]. "It worked very well," he says of the event. "I built special speaker columns on the hills and had 16 loudspeaker arrays in a square platform going up to the hill on {{convert|70|foot|adj=on}} towers. We set it up for 150,000 to 200,000 people.

===Declined invitations or missed connections===
* [[Bob Dylan]], in whose "backyard" the festival was held, was never in serious negotiation. Instead, Dylan signed in mid-July to play the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|Isle of Wight Festival of Music]], on August 31. Dylan set sail for England on {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth 2||2}} on August 15, the day the Woodstock Festival started. His son was injured by a cabin door and the family disembarked. Dylan, with his wife Sara, flew to England the following week. Dylan had been unhappy about the number of [[hippies]] piling up outside his house in the nearby town of Woodstock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bob |last=Dylan |title=Chronicles Volume One |page=116 |isbn=0-7435-4309-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]] declined the invitation,&lt;ref&gt;Joe Morella et Patricia Barey, Simon &amp; Garfunkel: Old Friends, Carol Pub. Group, 1991, 261 p. ({{ISBN|1559720891}})&lt;/ref&gt; as they rather wanted to get ahead with their new album.  
* [[The Jeff Beck Group]]: Jeff Beck disbanded the group prior to Woodstock. "I deliberately broke the group up before Woodstock", Beck said. "I didn't want it to be preserved." It was to have been the first time that Beck would perform with [[Tim Bogert]] and [[Carmine Appice]]. Also, Beck's piano player [[Nicky Hopkins]] performed with [[Jefferson Airplane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carson |first=Annette |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNSbocYbX6cC&amp;pg=PA96 |title=Jeff Beck: Crazy Fingers |location=San Francisco |publisher=Backbeat Books |year=2001 |page=96|isbn=9781617744846 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Led Zeppelin]] was asked to perform, their manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] stated: "We were asked to do Woodstock and [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] were very keen, and so was our U.S. promoter, Frank Barsalona. I said no because at Woodstock we'd have just been another band on the bill." However, the group did play the first [[Atlanta International Pop Festival (1969)|Atlanta International Pop Festival]] on July 5, as one of 22 bands at the two-day event. Woodstock weekend, Zeppelin performed south of the festival at the [[Asbury Park Convention Hall]] in [[New Jersey]]. Their only time out taken was to attend [[Elvis Presley]]'s show at the International Hotel in Las Vegas, on August 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Dave |title=Led Zeppelin: The Concert File |publisher=Omnibus Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-7119-5307-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Byrds]] were invited, but chose not to participate, figuring Woodstock to be no different from any of the other music festivals that summer. There were also concerns about money. As bassist [[John York (musician)|John York]] remembers: "We were flying to a gig and [[Roger McGuinn|Roger [McGuinn]]] came up to us and said that a guy was putting on a festival in upstate New York. But at that point they weren't paying all of the bands. He asked us if we wanted to do it and we said, 'No'. We had no idea what it was going to be. We were burned out and tired of the festival scene. [ ... ] So all of us said, 'No, we want a rest' and missed the best festival of all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Johnny |last=Rogan |title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited |publisher=Rogan House, London |page=293 |isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], at the time still known as the Chicago Transit Authority, had initially been signed on to play at Woodstock. However, they had a contract with concert promoter [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], which allowed him to move Chicago's concerts at the [[Fillmore West]]. He rescheduled some of their dates to August 17, thus forcing the band to back out of the concert. Graham did so to ensure that [[Santana (band)|Santana]], which he managed at the time, would take their slot at the festival. According to singer and bassist [[Peter Cetera]], "We were sort of peeved at him for pulling that one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cetera lends voice to SuperPops opener |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2008/sep/21/cetera-lends-voice-to-superpops-opener/ |newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |date=September 21, 2008 |department=Features}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tommy James and the Shondells]] declined an invitation. Lead singer [[Tommy James]] stated later: "We could have just kicked ourselves. We were in Hawaii, and my secretary called and said, 'Yeah, listen, there's this pig farmer in [[upstate New York]] that wants you to play in his field.' That's how it was put to me. So we passed, and we realized what we'd missed a couple of days later."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Tommy James and the Shondells: Anthology |others=[[Tommy James and the Shondells]] |year= |chapter= |pages=8, 12 |publisher=Rhino Records Inc. |id=R2 70920}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Moody Blues]] were included on the original Wallkill poster as performers, but decided to back out after being booked in Paris the same weekend.&lt;ref name="Passing On Woodstock: Who and Why"&gt;{{cite web |title=Passing On Woodstock: Who and Why |url=http://www.woodstockstory.com/passingperformersbands.html |website=Woodstock Story |accessdate=April 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Frank Zappa]], then with [[The Mothers of Invention]], according to the Class of the 20th Century U.S. television special, is quoted as saying "A lot of mud at Woodstock ... We were invited to play there, we turned it down."&lt;ref name="Passing On Woodstock: Who and Why"/&gt;
* [[Love (band)|Arthur Lee and Love]] declined the invitation, but Mojo Magazine later described inner turmoil within the band which caused their absence at the Woodstock festival.&lt;ref name="Passing On Woodstock: Who and Why"/&gt;
* [[Free (band)|Free]] was asked to perform and declined.&lt;ref name="Passing On Woodstock: Who and Why"/&gt; They did however play at the [[Isle of Wight Festival]], a week later. 
* [[Mind Garage]] declined because they thought the festival would be no huge deal and they had a higher paying gig elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Passing On Woodstock: Who and Why"/&gt;
* [[The Doors]] were considered as a potential performing band but canceled at the last moment. According to guitarist [[Robby Krieger]], they turned it down because they thought it would be a "second class repeat of [[Monterey Pop Festival]]" and later regretted that decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doors.com/ftp/intervws/july3.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715100724/http://www.doors.com/ftp/intervws/july3.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 15, 2006 |title=Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger Live Chat Log-July 3, 1996 |type=Transcript |website=The Doors |date=July 3, 1996 |accessdate=July 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band members were disappointed and in response said, "Don't you think it'll be beneficial that we're there?" The band instead took a gig at [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |interviewer=Ray Shasho |first=Joe |last=Lala |url=http://www.classicrockhereandnow.com/2011/10/unplugged-interview-with-silent-giant.html |title=An Unplugged Interview With The Silent- Giant Of The Music Industry -Joe Lala |website=Classic Rock Here And Now |date=2011-10-07 |accessdate=2018-04-09 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You will have helicopters pick us up. We will fly straight to the show. We will perform immediately, and then we will be flown out.' And I picked up the phone and called Western Union ... And [my telegram] said: 'For reasons I can't go into / Until you are here / Clarifying your situation / Knowing you are having problems / You will have to find / Other transportation / Unless you plan not to come.'"

* [[The Rascals]] were invited to play the festival but declined due to the fact that they were in the middle of recording a new album.
* When feelers were sent out to [[The Beatles]] about possibly appearing, it was also suggested that a recent signee to their label [[Apple Records]] should also get an invite. That artist was [[James Taylor]]. When the group declined their invitation Taylor's invite was withdrawn as well.
* Allegedly, [[The Rolling Stones]] were also sent an invitation, but declined because [[Mick Jagger]] was in Australia filming ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'', and [[Keith Richards]]' girlfriend [[Anita Pallenberg]] had just given birth to their son Marlon.

===Media coverage===
Very few reporters from outside the immediate area were on the scene. During the first few days of the festival, national media coverage emphasized the problems. Front-page headlines in the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' read "Traffic Uptight at Hippiefest" and "Hippies Mired in a Sea of Mud". The [[New York Times]] ran an editorial titled "Nightmare in the Catskills," which read in part, "The dreams of marijuana and rock music that drew 300,000 fans and hippies to the Catskills had little more sanity than the impulses that drive the lemmings to march to their deaths in the sea.  They ended in a nightmare of mud and stagnation ... What kind of culture is it that can produce so colossal a mess?"&lt;ref&gt;The 60s: The Story of a Decade, The New Yorker, Random House, 2016, pg. 231&lt;/ref&gt;  Coverage became more positive by the end of the festival, in part because the parents of concertgoers called the media and told them, based on their children's phone calls, that their reporting was misleading.&lt;ref name=Nowandthen&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Woodstock Now &amp; Then |work=[[VH1]] |url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/vh1_rock_docs/episode.jhtml?episodeID=156466 |year=2009 |type=Documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BacktotheGarden/&gt;

''The New York Times'' covered the prelude to the festival and the move from Wallkill to Bethel.&lt;ref name="Timesjuly"/&gt; Barnard Collier, who reported from the event for ''The New York Times'', asserts that he was pressured by on-duty editors at the paper to write a misleadingly negative article about the event. According to Collier, this led to acrimonious discussions and his threat to refuse to write the article until the paper's executive editor, [[James Reston]], agreed to let him write the article as he saw fit. The eventual article dealt with issues of traffic jams and minor lawbreaking, but went on to emphasize cooperation, generosity, and the good nature of the festival goers.&lt;ref name=Nowandthen/&gt;&lt;ref name=BacktotheGarden&gt;{{cite book |title=Back to the Garden: The Story of Woodstock |first=Pete |last=Fornatale |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=2009 |isbn=9781416591191}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the festival was over, Collier wrote another article about the exodus of fans from the festival site and the lack of violence at the event. The chief medical officer for the event and several local residents were quoted as praising the festival goers.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite book |editor-first=Andy |editor-last=Bennett |first=Simon |last=Warner |title=Remembering Woodstock |chapter=Reporting Woodstock: Some contemporary press reflections on the festival |location=Aldershot, UK |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |date=May 2004 |isbn=0-7546-0714-3 |page=}}{{page needed |date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown, New York's]] ''[[Times Herald-Record]]'', the only local daily newspaper, editorialized against the law that banned the festival from Wallkill. During the festival a rare Saturday edition was published. The paper had the only phone line running out of the site, and it used a motorcyclist to get stories and pictures from the impassable crowd to the newspaper's office {{convert|35|mi}} away in Middletown.&lt;ref name="Tiber 1994-1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Romm |first=Ethel Grodzins |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ethel-grodzins-romm/sex-drugs-rock-n-roll-in_b_259934.html |title=Sex, Drugs, Rock 'N Roll in Redneck Country |website=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=August 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090814/ENTERTAIN2302/908149947/-1/NEWS |title=In His Own Words: The 'Record' on Woodstock |first=David E. |last=Romm |newspaper=[[The Times Herald-Record]] |date=August 14, 2009 |accessdate=July 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=ENTERTAIN2302 |title=Woodstock: Celebrating the 40th Anniversary |newspaper=[[The Times Herald-Record]] |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2011}}{{failed verification |date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Releases==

===Films===
{{Main|Woodstock (film)}}

The documentary film ''Woodstock'', directed by [[Michael Wadleigh]] and edited by [[Thelma Schoonmaker]] and [[Martin Scorsese]], was released in 1970. [[Artie Kornfeld]] (one of the promoters of the festival) went to [[Fred Weintraub]], an executive at [[Warner Bros.]], and asked for money to film the festival. Artie had been turned down everywhere else, but against the express wishes of other Warner Bros. executives, Weintraub put his job on the line and gave Kornfeld $100,000 to make the film. ''Woodstock'' helped to save Warner Bros at a time when the company was on the verge of going out of business. The book ''[[Easy Riders, Raging Bulls]]'' details the making of the film.

Wadleigh rounded up a crew of about 100 from the New York film scene. With no money to pay the crew, he agreed to a double-or-nothing scheme, in which the crew would receive double pay if the film succeeded and nothing if it bombed. Wadleigh strove to make the film as much about the hippies as the music, listening to their feelings about compelling events contemporaneous with the festival (such as the [[Vietnam War]]), as well as the views of the townspeople.&lt;ref name="geocities"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/~music-festival/how-w2.htm |title=How Woodstock Came To Be ...

''Woodstock'' received the [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearchInput.jsp |title=The Official Academy Awards Database |website=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921143432/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearchInput.jsp |archivedate=September 21, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has been deemed [[culturally significant]] by the United States [[Library of Congress]]. In 1994, ''Woodstock: The Director's Cut'' was released and expanded to include Janis Joplin as well as additional performances by Jefferson Airplane, Jimi Hendrix, and Canned Heat not seen in the original version of the film. In 2009, the expanded 40th Anniversary Edition was released on DVD. This release marks the film's first availability on [[Blu-ray disc]].

Another film on Woodstock named ''[[Taking Woodstock]]'' was produced in 2009 by Taiwanese American filmmaker [[Ang Lee]].&lt;ref name="takingwoodstock"&gt;{{IMDb title|1127896|Taking Woodstock}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee practically rented out the entire town of New Lebanon, New York, to shoot the film. He was concerned with angering the locals, but they ended up being incredibly welcoming and excited to help with the film.&lt;ref name=Karen&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schoemer|first1=Karen|title=Turn on, Tune in, Turn Back the Clock|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/movies/23scho.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|website=www.nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie is based on Elliot Tiber, played by Demetri Martin, and his role in bringing Woodstock to Bethel, New York. The film also stars Jonathan Groff as Michael Lang and Henry Goodman and Imelda Staunton as Jake and Sonia Teichberg.&lt;ref name=Synopsis&gt;{{cite web|title=Synopsis|url=http://www.focusfeatures.com/taking_woodstock/synopsis|website=www.focusfeatures.com|publisher=Focus Features|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albums===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}&lt;!--only last paragraph has a citation--&gt;
Two soundtrack albums were released. The first, ''[[Woodstock: Music from the Original Soundtrack and More]]'', was a 3-LP (later 2-CD) album containing a sampling of one or two songs by most of the acts who performed. A year later, ''[[Woodstock 2]]'' was released as a 2-LP album. Both albums included recordings of stage announcements (many by Production Coordinator John Morris, e.g., "[We're told] that the brown acid is not specifically too good", "Hey, if you think really hard, maybe we can stop this rain") and crowd noises (i.e., the rain chant) between songs. In 1994, a third album, ''[[Woodstock Diary]]'' was released. Tracks from all three albums, as well as numerous additional, previously unreleased performances from the festival but not the stage announcements and crowd noises, were reissued by Atlantic as a 4-CD [[box set]] titled ''[[Woodstock: Three Days of Peace and Music]]''.

An album titled ''[[Woodstock (Jimi Hendrix album)|Jimi Hendrix: Woodstock]]'' also was released in 1994, featuring only selected recordings of Jimi Hendrix at the festival. A longer double-disc set, ''[[Live at Woodstock]]'' (1999) features nearly every song of Hendrix's performance, omitting just two pieces that were sung by his rhythm guitarist.

In 2009, [[Joe Cocker]] released  ''[[Live at Woodstock (Joe Cocker album)|Live at Woodstock]]'', a live album of his entire Woodstock set. The album contained eleven tracks, ten of which were previously unreleased.

In 2009, complete performances from Woodstock by Santana, Janis Joplin, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, Jefferson Airplane, and Johnny Winter were released separately by [[Legacy Recordings|Legacy]]/[[Sony Music Entertainment|SME Records]], and were also collected in a box set titled ''[[The Woodstock Experience]]''. Also, in 2009, [[Rhino Records|Rhino]]/[[Atlantic Records]] issued a 6-CD box set titled ''[[Woodstock: 40 Years On: Back to Yasgur's Farm]]'', which included further musical performances as well as stage announcements and other ancillary material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Woodstock—40 Years On: Back to Yasgur's Farm boxed set |website=[[Rhino Entertainment]] |accessdate=August 16, 2009 |date=June 5, 2009 |url=http://www.rhino.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=628 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905043240/http://www.rhino.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=628 |archivedate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Max Yasgur refused to rent out his farm for a 1970 revival of the festival, saying, "As far as I know, I'm going back to running a dairy farm." Yasgur died in 1973.&lt;ref name="Timesobit"&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Max Yasgur Dies; Woodstock Festival Was on His Farm |date=February 9, 1973 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F06E0DB1730E63ABC4852DFB4668388669EDE&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fW%2fWoodstock%20Music%20Festivals |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 4, 2013 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bethel voters tossed out their supervisor in an election held in November 1969 because of his role in bringing the festival to the town. New York State and the town of Bethel passed mass gathering laws designed to prevent any more festivals from occurring.

In 1984, at the original festival site, land owners Louis Nicky and June Gelish put up a monument marker with plaques called "Peace and Music" by a local sculptor from nearby [[Bloomingburg, New York|Bloomingburg]], Wayne C. Saward (1957–2009).&lt;ref name="SAWARD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=18323 |title=Woodstock Music and Arts Fair monument |website=The Historical Marker Database |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts were made to prevent people from visiting the site, its owners spread chicken manure, and during one anniversary, tractors and state police cars formed roadblocks. Twenty thousand people gathered at the site in 1989 during an impromptu 20th anniversary celebration. In 1997 a community group put up a welcoming sign for visitors. Unlike Bethel, the town of Woodstock made several efforts to cash in on its notoriety. Bethel's stance changed in recent years, and the town now embraces the festival. Efforts have begun to forge a link between Bethel and Woodstock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Israel |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090813/ENTERTAIN2302/908130310 |title=Woodstock at 40: A tale of two towns |newspaper=[[Times Herald-Record]] |date=August 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 80 lawsuits were filed against Woodstock Ventures, primarily by farmers in the area. The movie financed settlements and paid off the $1.4 million of debt Woodstock Ventures had incurred from the festival.&lt;ref name=Nowandthen/&gt;

On August 15, at the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts overlooking the original site, the largest assembly of Woodstock performing alumni since the original 1969 festival performed in an eight-hour concert in front of a sold-out crowd. Hosted by [[Country Joe McDonald]], the concert featured [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] performing [[Janis Joplin]]'s hits (she actually appeared with the Kozmic Blues Band at Woodstock, although that band did feature former Big Brother guitarist [[Sam Andrew]]), [[Canned Heat]], [[Ten Years After]], [[Jefferson Starship]], [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]], and the headliners, The [[Levon Helm]] Band. At Woodstock, Levon Helm played drums and was one of the lead vocalists with The Band. [[Paul Kantner]] was the only member of the 1969 Jefferson Airplane lineup to appear with Jefferson Starship.

Also in 2009, Michael Lang and Holly George-Warren published ''[[The Road to Woodstock]]'', which describes Lang's involvement in the creation of the Woodstock Music &amp; Arts Festival, and includes personal stories and quotes from central figures involved in the event.

In May 2014, a producer and organizer of the original Woodstock event, Michael Lang, revealed plans for a possible 50th anniversary concert in 2019 and that he was exploring various locations.

==In popular culture==
As one of the biggest rock festivals of all time and a cultural touchstone for the late 1960s, Woodstock has been referenced in many different ways in popular culture. The phrase "the Woodstock generation" became part of the common lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mankin |first=Bill |url=http://likethedew.com/2012/03/04/we-can-all-join-in-how-rock-festivals-helped-change-america/ |title=We Can All Join In: How Rock Festivals Helped Change America |journal=Like the Dew |date=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tributes and parodies of the festival began almost as soon as the final chords sounded. Cartoonist [[Charles M. Schulz|Charles Schulz]] named his recurring ''[[Peanuts]]'' bird character – which began appearing in 1966 but was still unnamed – [[Woodstock (Peanuts)|Woodstock]] in tribute to the festival.&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Schulz, ''The Complete Peanuts'', 1967–1968, New York, Fantagraphic Books, pp. 41–42, 83, 207, 227–228.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1970, ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine published a poem by [[Frank Jacobs]] and illustrated by [[Sergio Aragonés]] titled "I Remember, I Remember The Wondrous Woodstock Music Fair" that parodies the traffic jams and the challenges of getting close enough to actually hear the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=April 1970 |url=http://www.madmagazine.com/blog/2013/04/23/rip-richie-havens-musician |title=R.I.P. Richie Havens, Musician |website=[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]] |accessdate=April 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426150836/http://www.madmagazine.com/blog/2013/04/23/rip-richie-havens-musician |archive-date=April 26, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keith Robertson (writer)|Keith Robertson]]'s 1970 children's book ''[[Henry Reed (fictional character)|Henry Reed's Big Show]]'' has the title character attempting to emulate the success of the festival by mounting his own concert at his uncle's farm. In 1973, the stage show ''[[National Lampoon's Lemmings]]'' portrayed the "Woodchuck" festival, featuring parodies of many Woodstock performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clarke |first=Craig |url=http://www.greenmanreview.com/cd/cd_va_nationallampoon_lemmings.html |title=Original Off-Broadway Cast, National Lampoon's Lemmings |website=Green Man Review |accessdate=March 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028125348/http://www.greenmanreview.com/cd/cd_va_nationallampoon_lemmings.html |archivedate=October 28, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent culture continues to remember Woodstock, with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine naming "The Who at Woodstock – 1969" to the magazine's "Top 10 Music-Festival Moments" list on March 18, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fletcher |first=Dan |date=March 18, 2010 |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2010/03/18/top-10-music-festival-moments/slide/the-who-at-woodstock-1969/# |title=The Who at Woodstock – 1969 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[A Walk on the Moon]]'' is a 1999 film set partially at the Woodstock festival.

In 2005, Argentine writer [[Edgar Brau]] published ''Woodstock'', a long poem commemorating the festival. An English translation of the poem was published in January 2007 by [[Words Without Borders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordswithoutborders.org/contributor/edgar-brau/ |title=Edgar Brau |website=[[Words Without Borders]] |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Taking Woodstock]]'' is a 2009 film that dramatizes how the festival came together.
 
In 2017, the singer [[Lana Del Rey]] released a song, "[[Coachella - Woodstock in My Mind]]," in order to show her worries about the tensions between [[North Korea]] and the [[United States]], while she was at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]], expressing nostalgia by reminding the Woodstock festival as a symbol of peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reed |first=Ryan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/hear-lana-del-reys-somber-new-song-coachella-woodstock-in-my-mind-w482237 |title=Hear Lana Del Rey's Somber New Song 'Coachella – Woodstock in My Mind' |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2017-05-15 |accessdate=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
