'''Agnolo de Tura''' (14th century) was a [[chronicler]] from [[Siena]], [[Italy]]. He was also a shoemaker and tax collector. He married a woman named Nicoluccia, who was of a higher class than he was. Agnolo di Tura was determined to rise in the world (his wife kept reminding him of how much she gave up to be with a man of lower status). Together Agnolo di Tura and Nicoluccia had five children. During the time of the [[Black Death]], Nicoluccia and all five children died. Agnolo di Tura writes of the event: "And I, Agnolo di Tura, called the Fat, buried my five children with my own hands". Agnolo di Tura survived the [[Black Death]] and remarried.

One of his writings is this, from Agnolo di Tura, of Siena:

"The mortality in Siena began in May. It was a cruel and horrible thing. . . . It seemed that almost everyone became stupefied seeing the pain. It is impossible for the human tongue to recount the awful truth. Indeed, one who did not see such horribleness can be called blessed. The victims died almost immediately. They would swell beneath the armpits and in the groin, and fall over while talking. Father abandoned child, wife husband, one brother another; for this illness seemed to strike through breath and sight. And so they died. None could be found to bury the dead for money or friendship. Members of a household brought their dead to a ditch as best they could, without priest, without divine offices. In many places in Siena great pits were dug and piled deep with the multitude of dead. And they died by the hundreds, both day and night, and all were thrown in those ditches and covered with earth. And as soon as those ditches were filled, more were dug. I, Agnolo di Tura . . . buried my five children with my own hands. . . . And so many died that all believed it was the end of the world."

Another one of his writings was this:

"All the citizens did little else except to carry dead bodies to be buried [...] At every church they dug deep pits down to the water-table; and thus those who were poor who died during the night were bundled up quickly and thrown into the pit. In the morning when a large number of bodies were found in the pit, they took some earth and shovelled it down on top of them; and later others were placed on top of them and then another layer of earth, just as one makes lasagne with layers of pasta and cheese".

'''Alam''' '''عالم''' is derived from Arabic meaning "World" or "Universe" or "Dimension" e.g. '''عالم غيب''' (Alam-e-Ghaib) meaning the unseen dimension, or unseen world. 

Its plural is "Alameen" '''عالمين''' "Worlds" or "Multi-verse"

=='Alam  flag or sign==
[[Image:Muharram (Al'am) procession Barabanki India (Jan 2009).jpg|thumb|[[Shia]] [[Muslim]]s take out an Alam procession on [[day of Ashura]] in [[Barabanki city|Barabanki]], [[India]], Jan, 2009.]] 

Alam means "flag" or "sign" in Arabic. In Egypt, it may refer to a stone heap set up to mark a path in the desert.  
    
'Alam is also of spiritual significance for the [[Twelver]] [[Shia Muslims]]. Though all Shias including those of Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Lebanon, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Syria carry 'Alams in their processions in Ashura, the ones in India and Pakistan are specifically of a different kind and have more of a spiritual significance. An Alam with a "Panja" on top of it is considered to be a religious flag of Islam, and it is said to be carried by Muhammad, Ali and Abbas ibn Ali during battles or expeditions. The battle of [[Karbala]] further glorifies its importance. An Alam is usually seen during [[Muharram]] processions and at designated sites in Shia Mosques.

Historically, [[Muhammad]]'s family had a unique flag that represented the [[Bani Hashim]] clan in specific. One honorable member of the family would be chosen to carry this as a representation to others.  Earlier it was green in color and was given to first Imam [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] by [[Muhammad]] himself, then [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] gave this Alam to his son [[Abbas ibn Ali|Al Abbas ibn Ali]] who held this Alam till his last breath in the [[Battle of Karbala]].  After the event of Karbala, Alams during [[azadari]] procession are colored black or red.

It is thought to have been a black drape on a wooden pole with an emblem on the top. The Alams of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] usually have one that is a long wooden pole mounted with a silver or metal "Panja" (meaning a claw or palm of your hand). An 'Alam is usually seen during [[Muharram]] Processions and at designated sites in Shia Mosques today. Though there are [[Sufi]] shrines or mausoleums of [[Pir (Sufism)|Pir]]s that still have decorated 'Alams in [[Muharram]] in such cities as [[Karachi]] and [[Mumbai]], this practice being performed by people other than Shia Muslims has subsided over the last two decades out of fears of attacks by [[Wahhabis]].  An example of people who still practice "[[Hosay]]" or a multicultural event on the tenth of [[Muharram]] and carry 'Alams can be found in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. These Indians left India at a time when the Pir system was still in effect and this cross cultural event was still practiced without persecution.

The practice of taking out Alam procession during the holy month of [[Moharram]] or any festival season is prevalent in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] when hundreds of thousands of people come out on the streets holding the Alam in their hands. Alams taken out during celebration are usually green in color and the ones taken out during mourning procession are mostly either black or red in color, black signifies grief while red reminds of revenge for [[martyrs of Karbala]] still remaining. Alams in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] are sometimes more than 20 feet in length.

People who hold these Alams are referred as ''Alamdars'' (the Flag Bearers).

The '''Assaf dynasty''' (also called '''Banu Assaf''') were a [[Sunni Muslim]] and ethnic [[Turks in Lebanon|Turkmen]] dynasty of chieftains based in the [[Keserwan]] region of [[Mount Lebanon]]. They came to the aforementioned area in 1306 after being assigned by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)#Bahri rule|Bahri Mamluks]] to guard the coastal region between [[Beirut]] and [[Jbeil]] and to check the power of the mostly [[Shia Muslim]] population at the time. During this period, they established their headquarters in [[Ghazir]], which served as the Assafs' base throughout their rule.

Under the leadership of Emir Assaf, they were confirmed as the rulers of Keserwan by Sultan [[Selim I]] following the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest in 1516. Emir Assaf died two years later and was succeeded by his son Hasan, who was in turn killed by his brother Qa'itbay. The latter ruled Keserwan until his death without children in 1523, after which he was succeeded by Hasan's son Mansur. Mansur had a long reign and was accorded by the Ottomans numerous districts in Mount Lebanon and its environs as tax farms. He eliminated many of his Sunni rivals, and his local power relied on a [[Maronite Christians in Lebanon|Maronite Christian]] support base and his Maronite agents, namely members of the Hubaysh clan, who served as a check on the [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shia Muslim]] sheikhs of Keserwan. At the peak of his power, Mansur's realm stretched from Beirut to [[Homs]].

Mansur was dismissed in 1579 and replaced by his son Muhammad, who was imprisoned by the authorities in 1584 for alleged involvement in a looting raid against an [[Istanbul]]-bound caravan. He was restored to Keserwan in 1585 and was given tax collection authority over the rural districts of [[Tripoli Eyalet]]; this brought him into conflict with the Sayfa clan, the Assafs' erstwhile Turkmen clients, one of whose members, Yusuf Pasha Sayfa, was governor of Tripoli. The Assaf realm dissipated in 1591 when Muhammad was killed while attempting to collect taxes from the Sayfas in [[Akkar]]. Afterward, Yusuf Pasha Sayfa married Muhammad's widow and inherited the Assaf realm.

==History==

===Mamluk era===
The Assafs were [[Sunni Muslims]] and ethnic [[Turkmens]]. In 1306, the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]]s installed the Assaf tribe as the lords of [[Keserwan]] after defeating the [[Shia Muslim]]s who politically dominated Keserwan and were the majority population in the area.&lt;ref name="Nakash30"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nakash|first1=Yitzhak|title=Reaching for Power: The Shi'a in the Modern Arab World|date=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400841462|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a43C-4RKGcgC&amp;pg=PA30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assafs-based themselves in the Keserwani village of [[Ghazir]], which became the tribe's headquarters.&lt;ref name="Hayek"&gt;{{cite book|last1=El-Hayek|first1=Elias|editor1-last=Gervers|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Bikhazi|editor2-first=Ramzi Jibran|title=Conversion and Continuity: Indigenous Christian Communities in Islamic Lands Eighth to Eighteenth Centuries|date=1990|publisher=Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies|page=419|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=te2Jg-RTi4YC&amp;pg=PA419|chapter=The Maronites of the Middle Ages}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assaf were entrusted by the Mamluks of maintaining a 300-strong cavalry unit to patrol the region between [[Beirut]] and [[Byblos|Jbeil]] and to guard entry into the Keserwan from Beirut.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2012, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Kamal Salibi]] asserts that Turkmen tribesmen were settled in Keserwan after the Mamluk conquest in 1305, but does not specify that it was the Assaf tribe that became lords of the region.&lt;ref name="Salibi103"&gt;Salibi, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Assaf or Turkmen lordship, Shia influence in Keserwan dwindled;&lt;ref name="Nakash30"/&gt; they remained the majority in the region due to continual immigration from the [[Beqaa Valley]], but were forced out of the coastal areas of Keserwan and their population declined.&lt;ref name="Harris72"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Alawites|Alawite]] population in the region largely disappeared under Assaf lordship.&lt;ref name="Harris72"/&gt;

In 1382, the Mamluk emir [[Barquq]] usurped the throne in [[Cairo]], establishing the [[Burji dynasty|Burji regime]].&lt;ref name="Harris76"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter were ethnic [[Circassians]] unlike their Turkmen [[Bahri dynasty|Bahri]] predecessors, which resulted in frayed relations between the Turkmens of Keserwan and the new rulers.&lt;ref name="Salibi103"/&gt; The tensions between the Turkmens of Keserwan and the Burji authorities contrasted with the Turkmens' principal rivals in Mount Lebanon, the Druze Buhturids, who embraced Sultan Barquq.&lt;ref name="Harris76"/&gt; When the latter was briefly toppled in a Bahri revolt in 1389, the Buhturids fought against the Bahri rebels in [[Damascus]], while the Turkmen tribesmen assaulted the Druze Tanukhi tribesmen in Beirut and the surrounding hills.&lt;ref name="Harris76"/&gt; In those engagements and the executions that followed, the Turkmens killed seven of the eight Tanukhi Abi al-Jaysh Arslan emirs, Druze allies of the Buhturids.&lt;ref name="Harris76"/&gt;

Barquq was restored to power in 1390, after which the Turkmen tribesmen raided the hills around Beirut once more, although they were unable to capture the villages of [[Ainab]] and [[Aramoun, Keserwan|Aramoun]].&lt;ref name="Harris76"/&gt; Under Barquq's direction, the Mamluks mobilized their army troops, Druze warriors, and tribesmen from the Beqaa Valley and dealt a heavy blow against the Turkmens of Keserwan.&lt;ref name="Harris76"/&gt; Nonetheless, Barquq decided to keep the Turkmen emirs as the lords of Keserwan, albeit in a weakened state.&lt;ref name="Harris76"/&gt; Barquq likely kept the Turkmens in place to avoid giving the Buhturids too much power in Mount Lebanon or to avoid over-extending Buhturid forces.&lt;ref name="Harris76"/&gt; According to Salibi, only four Turkmen emirs have been named in primary sources: a certain Sa'id who ruled in 1361, his brother and successor Isa, and a certain Ali ibn al-A'ma and his brother Umar ibn al-A'ma.&lt;ref name="Salibi147"&gt;Salibi 1967, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter two were the Turkmen emirs involved in the rebellion against Barquq. Ali was killed in Barquq's punitive expedition, while Umar was imprisoned and released.&lt;ref&gt;Salibi 1967, pp. 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman era===

====Reigns of Assaf and Hasan====
According to historian Muhammad Adnan Bakhit, reliable information about the Assafs in the early 16th century is relatively scarce.&lt;ref name="Bakhit178"&gt;Bakhit, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; A certain Emir Assaf from among the Turkmen tribesmen of Keserwan was appointed by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan [[Selim I]] as governor of the Keserwan ''nahiya'' (subdistrict; pl. ''nawahi'') of the [[Safad Sanjak]] (Beirut Sanjak) after the Ottomans took control of the [[Levant]] from the Mamluks in 1516.&lt;ref name="Salibi103"/&gt; Sultan Selim I assigned the Assafs as his chief agents in the region between Beirut and [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], confirming their control of Keserwan, and awarding them tax farms in the ''nawahi'' of Jbeil and Beirut.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2012, pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; While Emir Assaf had lived in [[Aintoura]] in the winter and elsewhere along the [[Nahr al-Kalb]] ridge prior to the Ottoman conquest, in 1517, he moved his headquarters to Ghazir.&lt;ref name="Salibi152"&gt;Salibi 1967, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; The move to the latter village in Keserwan's interior and away from the Turkmen-dominated coastal area likely contributed to a steady deterioration of ties between the Assafs and their fellow Turkmens.&lt;ref name="Salibi152"/&gt; At the same time, it brought the Assafs closer to the Maronites who lived in the interior areas of Keserwan.&lt;ref name="Salibi152"/&gt; Coiniciding to the Assafs' relocation to Ghazir, Hubaysh ibn Musa moved to the village from [[Yanouh]].&lt;ref name="Salibi153"&gt;Salibi 1967, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The Assaf and Hubaysh clans thereafter developed strong ties, with members of the latter serving as agents of the Assafs and becoming their chief intermediaries with the local Maronites.&lt;ref name="Salibi153"/&gt;

In Tripoli, the Assafs had their own chief agent, Muhammad Agha Shu'ayb, who was their subordinate tax collector for the countryside of Tripoli, including the [[Akkar]] plains.&lt;ref name="Harris89"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Buhturids were stripped of power in 1518 when their leader was imprisoned by the authorities for failure to submit allegiance to Selim I.&lt;ref name="Harris89"/&gt; Thus, the Ottomans restored the Assafs to their former prominence in Mount Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2012, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the historical account of the 17th-century Maronite patriarch and historian, [[Istifan al-Duwayhi]], Emir Assaf died in 1518, and was succeeded by his son Hasan.&lt;ref name="Bakhit178"/&gt; Hasan and his brother Husayn had previously served as managers of their father's affairs.&lt;ref name="Salibi153"/&gt;

====Reign of Qa'itbay====
Assaf's other son from a different wife, Qa'itbay, sought to usurp power from his brothers.&lt;ref name="Salibi153"/&gt; In the ensuing power struggle, Qa'itbay was forced to flee and received refuge in [[Choueifat]], before relocating to Beirut; there, he accrued funds to bribe the governor of Damascus, [[Janbirdi al-Ghazali]], to replace Hasan as the tax farmer of Keserwan.&lt;ref name="Salibi153"/&gt; Hasan and Husayn sought to reconcile with their half-brother, but as they entered Beirut, they were killed in an ambush ordered by Qa'itbay.&lt;ref name="Bakhit178"/&gt; In his subsequent assertion of control over Keserwan, Jbeil and Beirut, Qa'itbay was backed by [[Janbirdi al-Ghazali]], the ex-Mamluk Ottoman governor of [[Damascus Eyalet]].&lt;ref name="Bakhit178"/&gt; Despite al-Ghazali's revolt against the Ottomans and its subsequent suppression in 1521, the authorities did not punish Qa'itbay for his alliance with al-Ghazali.&lt;ref name="Harris89"/&gt; However, the death of al-Ghazali represented the loss of a major political patron of the emir.&lt;ref name="Salibi155"&gt;Salibi 1967, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

After al-Ghazali's downfall, the Hubaysh clan, who had since been forced out by Qa'itbay and settled in [[Lassa, Lebanon|Lassa]], sought to oust Qa'itbay.&lt;ref name="Salibi155"/&gt; They kidnapped Hasan's son Mansur,&lt;ref name="Salibi155"/&gt; who Qa'itbay had spared from execution due to Qa'itbay's lack of male children,&lt;ref name="Bakhit178"/&gt; and organized a revolt against Qa'itbay in Mansur's name.&lt;ref name="Salibi155"/&gt; The revolt quickly spread through Qa'itbay's territories, but after marshaling financial resources to mobilize military support from the Bedouin Ibn al-Hansh tribe of the Beqaa Valley, he managed to drive his opponents back to Lassa.&lt;ref&gt;Salibi 1967, pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt; Qa'itbay died without a male heir in 1523, and was succeeded by Hasan's son Mansur, who Qa'itbay had spared from execution due to Qa'itbay's lack of male children.&lt;ref name="Bakhit178"/&gt;

====Reign of Mansur====
[[File:Emir Assaf Mosque.jpg|thumb|The [[Emir Assaf Mosque]] (1597) in Beirut's central district is attributed to Mansour Assaf]]
In Ottoman administrative records, a certain Emir Musa Bey is noted as the local authority in Keserwan between Qa'itbay's death in 1523 and 1548, not Mansur.&lt;ref name="Bakhit178"/&gt; However, nothing else is written about Emir Musa, prompting Bakhit to suggest that by dint of Musa's title, "emir", that Musa was a member of the Assaf clan who led the dynasty as a virtual regent during the years of Mansur's years as a minor.&lt;ref name="Bakhit178"/&gt; In Duwayhi's account, only Mansur is mentioned as leader.&lt;ref name="Bakhit178"/&gt;
 
Mansur was regularly assigned the tax farms of the ''nawahi'' of Keserwan, Jbeil, [[Batroun]], [[Bsharri]], [[Koura District|Kura]] and [[Dinniyeh|Dinniyah]].&lt;ref name="BauderLewis35"&gt;Bauder and Lewis, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Mansur installed members of the Hubaysh clan as his chief agents in Keserwan, particularly investing sheikhs Yusuf and Sulayman Hubaysh as his stewards.&lt;ref name="BauderLewis35"/&gt; Mansur also became the patron of the Turkmen [[Sayfa clan]],&lt;ref name="Harris90"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; who entered the region as Ottoman ''levend'' (auxiliary troops) in 1528.&lt;ref&gt;Winter 2010, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; He installed the Sayfas as his subordinate tax farmers in Akkar, provoking opposition from Muhammad Shu'ayb, who was killed by Mansur later that year.&lt;ref name="Harris90"/&gt; Mansur subsequently had Shu'ayb replaced with Yusuf Sayfa as his chief agent in Tripoli.&lt;ref name="Harris90"/&gt; Mansur proceeded to eliminate his Muslim rivals between then and 1541. Among those killed were the Kurdish Ottoman official in charge of Batroun, a couple of Shia sheikhs from Keserwan, a rival Turkmen clan in Keserwan and the sheikhs of the Bedouin Ibn al-Hansh tribe; the latter were executed at a reception held by Mansur in Ghazir.&lt;ref name="Harris90"/&gt;

Mansur encouraged Maronite settlement in Keserwan, who he viewed as less of a threat to his rule than his Sunni rivals and as a counterweight to the Shia Muslim clans of Keserwan; the Maronites were the majority population in the ''nawahi'' that Mansur tax farmed.&lt;ref name="Harris90"/&gt; In the 1540s, he lowered taxes and reduced property prices in Keserwan, attracting Maronite settlement in that ''nahiya''.&lt;ref name="Harris90"/&gt; With the likely influence of the Hubaysh,&lt;ref name="BauderLewis35"/&gt; who sought to oust the Shia from Keserwan,&lt;ref name="Harris90"/&gt; Maronite families from Jbeil village of [[Jaj]], namely the [[Khazen]]s, [[Gemayel]]s and Kumayds, settled in the Keserwani villages of [[Ballouneh]], [[Bikfaya]] and Ghazir's ridge, respectively, in 1545.&lt;ref name="Salibi103"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BauderLewis35"/&gt; With Yusuf Hubaysh as his chief deputy, Mansur managed to control a virtual principality between Beirut to [[Homs]], and built palatial residences for himself in Ghazir, Beirut and Jbeil.&lt;ref name="Harris90"/&gt; Historian William Harris asserts that Mansur's principality was the "precursor of the Druze lordship of Fakhr ad-Din Ma'n".&lt;ref name="Harris90"/&gt;

Although Mansur timely delivered taxes to the authorities, the Ottomans became wary of his power in Mount Lebanon and importing of arms from Venice.&lt;ref name="Harris90"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2012, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1579, Sultan [[Murad III]] established the [[Tripoli Eyalet]], which was centered in Tripoli and included all of the ''nawahi'' north of Keserwan that were ostensibly under Assaf lordship.&lt;ref name="Harris90"/&gt; The authorities assigned Mansur's client Yusuf Sayfa as Tripoli's governor, making him independent of Mansur. Yusuf Pasha Sayfa's elevation also gave him tax rights over the Mansur's former and predominantly Maronite ''nawahi''.&lt;ref name="Harris90"/&gt;

====Reign of Muhammad====
Complaints lodged to the authorities against Mansur ultimately led to his dismissal in 1579. He was replaced with his son Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Bakhit179"&gt;Bakhit 1982, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Mansur died in 1580.&lt;ref name="Bagley69"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bagley|first1=F. R.

Muhammad's taxation was considered exploitative by Tripoli Eyalet's inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Bakhit179"/&gt; Yusuf Sayfa refused to pay taxes to Muhammad, prompting the latter to attempt collecting them through military means.&lt;ref name="Bakhit179"/&gt; However, while en route to the Akkar to pressure the Sayfas, Muhammad was shot dead outside of Tripoli on Yusuf Sayfa's orders in 1591.&lt;ref name="Harris92"/&gt; Muhammad's death with no male heirs marked the end of Assaf rule. Following his death, Yusuf Sayfa was transferred control of the Assafs' ''nawahi'' in Tripoli Eyalet, and he expelled the Hubaysh clan, promoting his Shia Muslim Hamade allies from Jbeil at their expense.&lt;ref name="Harris92"/&gt; In 1593, Yusuf Sayfa wed Muhammad's widow and thus acquired the Assafs' wealth.&lt;ref name="Bakhit179"/&gt; He concurrently took control over Keserwan and Assaf properties in Beirut.&lt;ref name="Harris92"/&gt;

In recognition of his valuable service at the [[Sixth Buddhist council]] held in [[Burma]], the Burmese government conferred on him the title "Agga Mahapandita" (Chief Great Scholar) in 1956. Later in March 1997, the Burmese government conferred on Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero the highest [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] title, "Abhidhaja Maharatthaguru" (Most Eminent Great Spiritual Teacher), which is equivalent to [[Sangharaja]], in honor of his unique service to the Buddhist religion.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=uk&gt;{{cite web | url=http://buddhistgroupofkendal.co.uk/eight-precepts-ajivatthamaka-sila-in-burmese-buddhsim/ | title=Ajivatthamaka Sila (Eight Precepts with Right Livelihood as the Eighth) in Burmese Buddhism | publisher=Buddhist Group of Kendal | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero was born on 23 August 1896 in Kirindigala, [[Balangoda]], to the family of N. A. Mathises [[Appuhamy]] (Maddumahamy) and B. Heenmanike.&lt;ref name=xy/&gt; His birth name was Punchi Mahattaya aka William. Because Punchi Mahattaya's mother died when he was 14 days old, he was brought up by his father's brother and his wife.&lt;ref name=xy/&gt; 
Punchi Mahattaya had his primary education at Kumara Vidyalaya, [[Balangoda]].

At the age of 15 he had decided to enter the order of [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] and was ordained as a [[Samanera]] at the temple [https://www.google.com/maps?cid=10932497639911824521 Sri Nandaramaya, Udumulla, Balangoda] on 2 March 1911.&lt;ref name=xy&gt;{{cite news|last = Fernando|first = Thilak|title = Face to face with late Ven. Aggamaha Panditha Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero |publisher = The Island - Saturday Magazine|date = 1994-09-24|url = http://www.infolanka.com/org/diary/179.html|accessdate = 2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordained under the guidance of Ven. Daamahana Dhammananda Thero and Deniyaye Seelananda Thero was his primary teacher (''Upaadhyaayanwahanse''). Balangdoda Ananda Maitreya Thero received his [[Upasampada]] on 14 July 1916 at Olu Gantota Udakukhepa Seema, Balangoda.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt;
 
Thero continued his studies after becoming a monk and later became a scholar in [[Buddhism]] and [[languages]]. Thero entered [[Ananda College]], [[Colombo]] in 1919 and became a teacher of the same school in 1922.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; Unusually for a [[Theravada]] teacher, he publicly studied  some other traditions, such as [[Mahayana Buddhism]], [[mantra]] and esoteric [[yoga]]. This is understandable when one realizes that he was a [[theosophist]] as well as a Buddhist. He was a [[Autodidact|self learner]] in most of his areas of studies.

Ananda Maitreya Thero was the first Dharmarcharya (teacher of Buddhism) at [[Nalanda College Colombo]], when it was first established in 1925. It was Venerable Thero who named it 'Nalanda' and chose ''Apadana Sobhini Panna'' meaning ''wisdom beautifies character'' as Nalanda College's [[motto]], which is still being used.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; Later he became the professor of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] at [[Vidyodaya University]], Sri Lanka. He was appointed to the post of [[Dean (education)|Dean]], Faculty of Buddhist Studies in 1963. On 1 October 1966, he was appointed to the post of [[Vice Chancellor]] at the same university.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt;

Ananda Maithreya Thero's first overseas [[Dhamma]] journey was to [[Kerala]], [[India]] in 1926. He opened the Sri Dhammananda Pirivena, Colombo in 1930. 
On 18 January 1954, Thero was appointed to the post of Sangha Nayaka of ''Sabaragamu-Saddhammawansa Nikaya'' and in the same year he participated in the [[Sixth Buddhist council]] held in [[Myanmar]]. On 2 September 1969, Ananda Maitreya Thero was appointed as the President of [[Amarapura Nikaya|Amarapura]] [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] [[Sabhā]] of Sri Lanka.

Ananda Maitreya Thero was famous for his achievements in [[Buddhist meditation]]. He was known to have practiced both [[Samatha]] meditation and [[Vipassana meditation]] to a great extent and was considered to be having a highly developed mind through his [[meditation]]. Many Buddhists have experienced his powerful spiritual blessings in many more ways than one. His teachings and life have been an inspiration to many aspiring [[Buddhist monks|monks]] and [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā|lay followers]].

Venerable Ananda Maitreya Thero along with Venerable [[Narada Maha Thera|Narada Thero]] and Venerable [[Madihe Pannaseeha Thero]] was and still is one of the foremostly revered and respected Buddhist monks of the twentieth century in Sri Lanka. His work and sacrifices with [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] was one of the steering forces of the upholding of [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka]] at one stage. Thero also traveled to many countries in the world for the propagation of Buddhism. Most Venerable Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero died at 11.40 p.m. on 18 July 1998 at the age of 101.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt;

==Degrees and titles==
In 1955, the [[Government of Myanmar]] (then [[Burma]]) conferred him the title "[[Agga Maha Pandita]]" (Great Chief Scholar) to honour his unprecedented service at the [[Sixth Buddhist council]].&lt;ref name="cd"/&gt; To honor his unique service to the Buddha [[Śāsana]], Myanmar also conferred him the highest [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] title, "Abhidhaja Maharatthaguru" (Most Eminent Great Spiritual Teacher), which is equivalent to [[Sangharaja]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="cd"&gt;{{cite news|last = Yodhasinghe|first = Lionel|title = State Funeral for Ven.

In addition to that, Nayaka [[Thero]] has received two honorary titles, "Saahithyasuuri" from [[Vidyodaya University]] and "Saahithya Chakrawarthi" from [[University of Kelaniya|Vidyalankara University]].

The humbleness of Maha Nayaka Thero's character is clearly shown, when he publicly stated that he had no liking whatsoever for titles and awards, but that he was rather accepting it to satisfy the presenter. He quoted [[Gautama Buddha|Lord Buddha]] in his speech saying "I often remind myself of My Great Buddha's preaching in the [[Samyutta Nikaya|Sanyuktha nikaya]] of the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]] of the worthlessness and futileness of the craving for awards, titles and commanding positions".

'''Bhat Vahis'''  were scrolls or records maintained by Bhatts also known as [[Bhatra]]. The majority of Bhat Sikhs originate from Punjab and were amongst the first followers of [[Guru Nanak]]. Bhat tradition and Sikh text states their ancestors came from [[Punjab region|Punjab]], where the Raja Shivnabh and his kingdom became the original 16th century followers of [[Guru Nanak]], the founder of Sikhism. The Raja's grandson Prince Baba Changa earned the title ‘Bhat Rai’ – the ‘Raja of Poets, and then settled himself and his followers all over India as missionaries to spread the word of Guru Nanak, where many northern Indians became Bhat Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;Haqiqat Rah Muqam shivnabh raje ki page 624 [p.1248]khari&lt;/ref&gt; The majority were from the northern [[Brahmin]] caste ([[Bhat clan]]),([[Bhat (surname)]]) as the Prince Baba Changa shared the [[Brahmin]] heritage. The sangat also had many members from different areas of the Sikh caste spectrum, such as the Hindu Rajputs and Hindu Jats who joined due to Bhat sikh missionary efforts. The Bhats also contributed 123 compositions in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib (pp.1389–1409), known as the "Bhata de Savaiyye".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhatra.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; There hereditary occupations consisted of  bards, poets, missionaries, astrologists, genealogists, salesmen. According to [[John Nesfield]] as quoted in [[William Crooke]]'s ''The Tribes and Castes of the North Western India'' (1896), Bhatts frequently visited the courts of princes and the camps of warriors, recited their praises in public, and kept records of their genealogies.

== Bardic tradition as a source of Sikh history ==

These bards constantly attended upon or visited their patron families reciting panegyrics to them and receiving customary rewards. They also collected information about births, deaths and marriages in the families and recorded it in their scrolls. These scrolls containing information going back to several past centuries formed the valued part of the bards` hereditary possessions. A group of Bhatts was introduced to [[Guru Arjan]], Nanak V, by Bhatt Bhikha who had himself become a Sikh in the time of Guru Amar Das.

According to [[Bhai Gurdas]], Varan, XI. 21, and [[Bhai Mani Singh]], Sikhan di Bhagat Mala, he had once visited Guru Arjan with the sangat of Sultanpur Lodhi. Some of the Bhatts who came into the Sikh fold composed hymns in honour of the Gurus which were entered in the Guru Granth Sahib by Guru Arjan. These Bhatts and their successors too maintained their vahis in which they recorded information concerning the Gurus, their families and some of the eminent Sikhs. These old vahis are still preserved in the descendant families, now scattered mostly in Haryana state. Their script is bhattakshari, a kind of family code like lande or mahajani. During the late 1950s, a researcher, [[Giani Garja Singh]], obtained [[Gurmukhi]] transcripts of some of the entries pertaining to the Guru period, from [[Guru Hargobind]] (15951644) to Guru Gobind singh ji.Some of these were published as footnotes to Shahid Bilas Bhai Mani Singh, edited by Giani Garja Singh and published by Punjabi Sahitya Akademi, Ludhiana, in 1961. The rest are still in manuscript form lying in the Department of Punjab Historical Studies, Punjabi University, Patiala. These extracts provide valuable information regarding dates, places and events of the period.

== Caution in use as historical source ==

As contemporary evidence, Bhat Vahis have to be used with caution however, for they are not diaries of the eyewitnesses. It was customary for the Bhatts to visit their hereditary patrons usually twice a year at harvest time to sing their praises and receive rewards or customary donations as well as to collect information for record in their vahfs. '''These records are, therefore, based on information gathered generally after the occurrence of events and, possibly, sometimes received at second hand.''' This may not apply to entries regarding the Gurus which were recorded by Bhatts who generally remained in attendance. For instance, an entry about the conferment of guruship upon the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] in 1708 is by Bhatt Narbud Singh (son of Keso Singh and grandson of Bhatt Kirat whose hymns are included in the Holy Book) who had accompanied [[Guru Gobind Singh]] to Nanded. On the whole, these Bhatt Vahis are a mine of information of historical and sociological value.

In the [[state of Ireland]], '''blasphemy''' is prohibited against any form of religion.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1134&amp;context=jil&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, it was limited to Christianity and was required to be prohibited by Article 40.6.1.i. of the [[Constitution of Ireland|1937 Constitution]]. The [[common law]] [[offence (law)|offence]] of [[blasphemous libel]], applicable only to Christianity and last prosecuted unsuccessfully in [[Vladimir_Pecherin|1855]],&lt;ref name="iesc5s24"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|An alleged instance in 1909 appears to relate not to a prosecution for blasphemy but to an ice rink operator's application to the [[Recorder of Dublin]] for renewal of its entertainment licence.

The [[lacuna (law)|deficit]] was filled in 2009 by a new offence of "publication or utterance of blasphemous matter", against any religion. The continued existence of a [[blasphemy]] offence is controversial, with proponents of [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of religion]] arguing it should be removed.&lt;ref name="conv2014p4"/&gt; The [[Government of the 32nd Dáil|government formed in 2016]] has committed to holding a referendum on abolishing the constitutional offence, which is required to amend the constitution.&lt;ref name="Programme_for_Partnership_Government"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merrionstreet.ie/MerrionStreet/en/ImageLibrary/Programme_for_Partnership_Government.pdf#page=154 |format=PDF|title=A Programme for a Partnership Government|date=11 May 2016|publisher=Government of Ireland|page=153|accessdate=1 June 2016 |quote=We propose that a number of referenda be held.

==Early history==
The [[Law of Ireland|legal system of Ireland]] grew out of the [[common law]] system of [[English law]], and so Irish jurisprudence on blasphemy largely reflected [[Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom#England and Wales|that of England]]. The common law offence of blasphemous libel applied only to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Keane 1991, §§92,104&lt;/ref&gt; Blasphemy could be committed by written or spoken words, by pictures or gestures.&lt;ref&gt;Keane 1991, §108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Profanity]] was generally regarded by legal scholars as synonymous with blasphemy.&lt;ref&gt;O'Higgins 1960, p.151&lt;/ref&gt; In 1328, [[Adam Duff O'Toole]] was [[burned alive]] in Dublin for alleged [[heresy]] and blasphemy.&lt;ref name="callan2015"/&gt; Initially tried under [[canon law]], he was handed over to the civil power as a repeat offender.&lt;ref name="callan2015"/&gt; He was a member of the [[O'Toole family]] which launched [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] raids on [[the Pale|the Anglo-Norman Pale]], and modern historians regard the charges as politically motivated.&lt;ref name="callan2015"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The heresy of being Irish : Adducc Dubh O'Toole and two MacConmaras |first=Maeve Brigid |last=Callan  |title=The Templars, the witch, and the wild Irish : vengeance and heresy in medieval Ireland |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In later times, the penalty for a first offence of blasphemous libel was an unlimited fine and imprisonment; for a second offence it was [[banishment]].&lt;ref name="dail1961"&gt;[http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0191/D.0191.196107260066.html Defamation Bill, 1961—Committee Stage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609123352/http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0191/D.0191.196107260066.html |date=9 June 2011 }} Dáil Éireann – Volume 191 – 26 July 1961&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]] was the [[established church]] from 1536 to [[Irish Church Act 1869|1871]].

The first is where there is incitement to hatred and the second is where there is simply an excessive offence to religious sensibilities. The term "blasphemy" does not relate to either of these.

The crime of [[sacrilege]] was defined, under the [[Larceny Act 1861]] and the [[Larceny Act 1916]], as [[breaking and entering]] a church ("place of divine worship") and committing any [[felony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1916/act/50/section/24/enacted/en/html|title=Larceny Act 1916, Section 24|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrilege was the charge used to prosecute theft from church [[poor box]]es.

==Removal Of Constitutional Ban==
On October 26, 2018, Ireland held a referendum which saw voters repeal the Blasphemy offence by a margin of 64.85% to 35.15%.&lt;ref name=rteoct27 /&gt; Nevertheless, blasphemy bans are still enforced under the 2009 Defamation Act.

'''Citizens for Social Reform''' (CSRPAC) was a [[political action committee]] founded in 2001 by [[Scientologists]].  Its primary mission was "to work with elected officials toward the goal of bringing about more humane and effective solutions to social ills like illiteracy, criminality, substance abuse and the general decay of moral character", mainly by promoting [[Scientology]] associated programs including [[Narconon]], [[Criminon]], [[Applied Scholastics]] and [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights|CCHR]] with legislators at the US federal and state levels. CSRPAC went inactive on June 30, 2007.

Their website, csrpac.org, while often avoiding direct references to the Church of Scientology, used much [[L. Ron Hubbard]]-based language. An entire section on their site was devoted to a "Citizen Hat" treatise &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csrpac.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=138&amp;Itemid=165 Citizen Hat – Further Reading], csrpac.org&lt;/ref&gt; listing Scientology books such as ''The Antisocial Personality'' and ''The Thinking Book'' side by side with basic civics texts such as ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' and the [[U.S. Constitution]]. The "Citizen Hat" was illustrated &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csrpac.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=122&amp;Itemid=149 What the heck is a Citizen Hat?], csrpac.org&lt;/ref&gt; by Scientologist Virginia Romero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oursites.org/virginiaromero/myself.htm|title=Scientology - Virginia Romero a Scientologist - find out what I have gained from Scientology...|work=oursites.org|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSR's website also dealt with anti-psychiatry issues, a key topic for Scientologists.

The former president of CSRPAC was [[Don Pearson]]. Corporation records show that Don Pearson opened a local chapter of the Citizen’s Commission in 1998.  Pearson also set up a political action committee called the Association of Citizens for Social Reform, for the purpose of eliminating "public support for social, educational and mental health programs that are intrusive, force-based or damaging to individual awareness and competence."&lt;ref name="SciInc"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Evans |title=Scientology Inc. |url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid=oid%3A8220 |publisher = [[Sacramento News and Review]] |date=August 23, 2001 |accessdate=October 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Konrad von Megenberg00.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;"''He nach volget das Puch der Natur''"]]
'''Conrad of Megenberg''' ({{lang-de|Konrad von Megenberg}},{{efn|He is sometimes called Konrad von [[Mengelberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Die Litteratur der ersten hundert Jahre nach der Erfindung der Typographie| author=Christian Friedrich Harless| date=1840| pages=288| publisher=Fest'sche Verlagsbuchhandl| isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} {{lang-la|Conradus Megenbergensis}}; 1309–1374) was a [[Germans|German]] [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] scholar, and a writer.

==Biography==
Conrad was born in either [[Mainberg]] or Mebenburg, both in [[Bavaria]]. He was born on 2 February 1309. Conrad himself calls his native place Megenberg, hence continued confusion on his birthplace. He studied at [[Erfurt]] and the [[University of Paris]]; at the latter university he obtained the degree of [[Master of Arts]], and he taught philosophy and theology at the [[University of Paris]] for several years.&lt;ref name="World Digital Library"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/3158/ |title = Book of Nature |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 20 August 1481 |accessdate = 2013-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1337 he was living in [[Vienna]]. That year he became head of St. Stephen's school. He relocated, in 1342, to [[Regensburg]]. There, he became a [[priest]], then a preacher, and eventually a [[cathedral canon]]. He was also a member of the local town council.&lt;ref name="World Digital Library"/&gt; In 1357 he made a journey to the [[Papal Curia]] in 'Babylonian exile' at [[Avignon]]. He died at [[Ratisbon]] (and alternative name for Regensburg) on 11 April 1374.

==Works==
[[File:Konrad von Megenberg Buch der Natur 1481.jpg|thumb|right|Woodcut from a 1481 ''Buch der Natur'']]
Conrad was one of the most prolific German writers of the fourteenth century. He wrote over thirty books.&lt;ref name="World Digital Library"/&gt; His best-known and most widely read work is his "Buch der Natur".&lt;ref name="World Digital Library"/&gt; According to his own statement he was engaged in writing it in 1349. A Latin work, ''De naturis rerum'', of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Thomas of Cantimpré]] (d. 1263), served as model.&lt;ref name="World Digital Library"/&gt; Conrad, however, prepared his book with considerable freedom; much of the original was omitted, his own observations were introduced, corrections were made, and so on. His work gives a survey of all that was known of natural history at that time and is, besides, the first natural history in the German language. It was widely read up to the sixteenth century, and numerous manuscript copies of it are still extant, eighteen being at [[Munich]]. The first printed edition with a date is of 1475, and was issued at [[Augsburg]] from the shop of Hans BŠmler, under the title of "Puch der Natur". It was printed at least six times before 1500; some of the editions were illustrated, all are now rare incunabula. A new edition of the original text was issued by Franz Pfeiffer (Stuttgart, 1861), with an introduction; an edition in modern German was edited by H. Schulz (Greifswald, 1897).

The work has eight chapters&lt;ref name="World Digital Library"/&gt;
* the nature of man
* sky, 7 planets, astronomy and meteorology
* zoology
* ordinary and aromatic trees
* plants and vegetables
* invaluable and semi-precious stones
* 10 kinds of metals
* water and rivers.

Of Conrad's numerous other writings there should be mentioned:
*the "Sphære" 'Spheres', a small compendium in German of [[astronomy]] and [[physics]], prepared from the Latin work of [[Joannes Sacrobosco]]
* some poems, including "Planctus ecclesiæ in Germania" (1337)
* a [[hymn]] in praise of the Virgin
* a work on morals, "Speculum felicitatis humanæ" 'mirror of human happiness' (1348)
* "De erroribus Begehardorum et Beguinarum" 'about the errors of [[Beghards]] and [[Beguines]]'
* "De translatione imperii" (1355) on the ''[[translatio imperii]]'', i.e. 'succession' of empires
* the large work "Oeconomica", written between 1353 and 1363
* "Tractatus contra mendicantes ad Papam Urbanum V" 'treatise against mendicant (order)s addressed to [[Pope Urban V]]
* several [[hagiography|biographies of saints]]
* some historical treatises, chiefly dealing with the local history of Ratisbon.

In his writings Conrad shows himself to be a strong adherent of the pope, an opponent of the philosophy of [[William of Ockham|Occam]], and a stern critic of the moral failings of his age and of the clergy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8512">'''Darwin Gross''' (1928–2008) was an American spiritual teacher who succeeded to the leadership of [[Eckankar]] in 1971 at the death of its founder [[Paul Twitchell]]. Gross officially took up the position of "Living ECK Master" on October 22, 1971 and appointed his successor [[Harold Klemp]] as Living ECK Master on October 22, 1981, though Gross later claimed Klemp failed to fully succeed to the position.  Gross claimed to continue afterwards as the Living Eck Master, though he was precluded from continuing to use the Eck terminology.

==Biography==

Darwin Gross was born in 1928 in Denhoff, North Dakota. He was brought up in the [[Mennonite]] faith. As a young man, he served with the US 11th Airborne Division in Japan following World War II. Later, Gross worked as an engineer, acquiring gigs on the side as a jazz musician. He described in his books a childhood filled with encounters and learning from many of the spiritual teachers of Eckankar. The moment he found the writings of Paul Twitchell, he recognized this as the same teaching he had been receiving inwardly since childhood. He began studying Twitchell's mail-order discourses and soon wrote to Twitchell asking how he could help set up classes in the Portland, Oregon, area where he lived.  Twitchell wrote back in November 1969, encouraging Gross to start some of the first ECK Satsang classes in the Northwestern United States. Gross continued taking on greater responsibilities with Eckankar and on many occasions traveled with Paul Twitchell to Eckankar Seminars. Gross gained the Eckankar title of leadership, the "Living ECK Master", upon Twitchell's death in October 1971.

On October 22, 1981, Darwin Gross's health problems led him to publicly appoint Harold Klemp as the Living ECK Master. Gross retained management responsibilities, running the corporate organization of Eckankar until 1983.  In 1983 Gross was voted out of his position by the Eckankar Board of Directors under controversial circumstances involving unproven charges that he misappropriated Eckankar corporate funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetruth-seeker.com/scanindexsubtitleAcss.asp?SubtitleNo=28 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107160324/http://www.thetruth-seeker.com/scanindexsubtitleAcss.asp?SubtitleNo=28 |archivedate=2009-01-07 |df= }} United States District Court Oregon 1984 - Sri Darwin Gross vs Eckankar Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; As Klemp entered an exclusive leadership role, the Eckankar corporate structure was changed in the State of California.

The policies giving Klemp exclusive powers were changed in Eckankar's Minnesota corporate papers on January 30, 1987, and were also changed in the Eckankar Nevada corporate papers on December 21, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hoovers.com/free/search/simple/xmillion/index.xhtml?what=4&amp;what=4&amp;query_string=Eckankar+Inc.&amp;which=company&amp;page=1&amp;x=59&amp;y=19&amp;hoovcountry=us&amp;bcl=1&amp;state=NV Company Search Portal - Eckankar Inc Las Vegas, NV&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the rift in ECKANKAR leadership in 1983, most members of Eckankar chose to follow Harold Klemp, but a number joined Darwin Gross and continue to learn under his new organization: "[[Ancient Teachings of the Masters|ATOM: Ancient Teachings of the Masters]]," [http://www.atomshop.org/main/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1] in which he claimed to carry on the original teachings of Paul Twitchell.

In 1988, "The John Ankerberg Show" interviewed Gross in reference to his continued use of the term "Mahanta" (the inner spiritual master revered in Eckankar), and he said, "I always looked at myself as not the Mahanta but a vehicle for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|GOu271fOwTQ|1988 Darwin Gross interview John Ankerberg TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnankerberg.org/catalog/ATM.html John Ankerberg TV show archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511200312/http://www.johnankerberg.org/catalog/ATM.html |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;"

Gross died on March 8, 2008 at the age of 80. According to the ATOM website, "Darwin’s Living Trust provides that his writings, music and unpublished works shall be held in trust to carry on his memory and life’s work as well as his predecessor’s, Paul Twitchell.  The Teachings will continue to be made available to those who are interested in this most direct path to God." {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Casualties of Multiple Masters ==
One seldom revealed aftermath of the fork&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oocities.org/eckcult/chapters/tmsm9.html Darwin Gross is Excommunicated]&lt;/ref&gt; caused by the hostile corporate pushout of Darwin Gross from Eckankar was his many devoted and true believers.  The caustic dilemma of this corporate in-fighting forced many eckists at the time to have to pick between Eckankar the religion and Darwin their ECK Master.  This was akin to having a child decide if they loved their "good parent" more than their "bad parent" while being informed by the "good parent" that the "bad parent" was "truly bad".  And though it may very well have been a wise business decision (at the time) by the board of directors of the Corporation of Eckankar to dump Darwin, the schism this situation caused opened Eckankar as a religion up to further divisions and splinter groups&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masterpath.org/ Master Path]&lt;/ref&gt; in the future.

==Legacy==
During the decade of his leadership of Eckankar, Gross expanded the physical organization and membership of Eckankar substantially. His leadership was considered important for the followers of Eckankar during the time, prior to his 1983 expulsion from Eckankar.

Current ATOM students of Darwin Gross, who still study his discourses and books, consider Gross to be a very ancient master. Gross, like his teacher Paul Twitchell - the originator of Eckankar, is regarded as a spiritual master who descended from an ancient and direct line extending into a history that is said to predate the early history and existence of our planet and solar system. The mythology of the ECK Masters is outlined in Twitchell's ''The Spiritual Notebook''.[http://www.vielewelten.at/pdf_en/spiritual%20notebook.pdf][https://archive.org/details/PaulTwitchellSpiritualNotebook PDF]

'''David Keith Lynch''' (born January 20, 1946) is an American filmmaker, painter, musician, actor, and photographer. He has been described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "the most important director of this era",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/page/0,11456,1082823,00.html |title=40 best directors |publisher=The Guardian Online |year=2007 |accessdate=November 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5Qeh0Qrlu?url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/page/0,11456,1082823,00.html |archivedate=July 27, 2007 |deadurl=no |location=London  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[AllMovie]] called him "the [[Polymath|Renaissance man]] of modern American filmmaking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Ankeny | first = Jason | url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/david-lynch-100454 |title=David Lynch: Biography |publisher=AllMovie |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His films ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986) and ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001) are widely regarded by critics to be among the greatest films of their respective decades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyshootpictures.com/lynchdavid.htm |title=David Lynch's Acclaimed Films |publisher=''They Shoot Pictures, Don't They'' |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/film-critics-pick-the-best-movies-of-the-decade |title=Film Critics Pick the Best Movies of the Decade |publisher=Metacritic |date=January 3, 2010 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the success of his 1990–91 television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' led to his being labeled "the first popular [[Surrealist]]" by film critic [[Pauline Kael]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Pauline Kael, quoted in Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; He has received three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Have 3-Time Academy Award-Nominated Filmmaker David Lynch Review Your Screenplay in LA|url=http://www.charitybuzz.com/auctions/DavidLynchFoundation/catalog_items/311513|work=charitybuzz|publisher=Charitybuzz Inc|accessdate=August 16, 2012|author=charitybuzz|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and has won France's [[César Award for Best Foreign Film]] twice, as well as the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]&lt;ref name="cannes-1990.com" /&gt; and a [[Golden Lion]] award for lifetime achievement at the [[Venice Film Festival]]. In 2016, ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', was named the top film of the 21st century by the BBC following a poll of 177 film critics from 36 countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Born to a middle-class family in [[Missoula, Montana]], Lynch spent his childhood traveling around the United States before he studied painting at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Philadelphia]], where he first made the transition to producing short films. He moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror film ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977). After ''Eraserhead'' became a [[cult classic]] on the [[midnight movie]] circuit, Lynch was employed to direct the biographical film ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980), from which he gained mainstream success. He was then employed by the [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]] and proceeded to make two films: the science-fiction epic ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'' (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a [[neo-noir]] mystery film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), which stirred controversy over its violence but later grew in critical reputation.

Next, Lynch created his own television series with [[Mark Frost]], the popular murder mystery ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (1990–1991). He also created a cinematic prequel, ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' (1992), a [[road film]] ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'' (1990) and a family film ''[[The Straight Story]]'' (1999) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent films operated on dream logic [[non-linear narrative]] structures: ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997),  ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), and ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' (2006). Meanwhile, Lynch embraced the [[Internet]] as a medium, producing several web-based shows, such as the animated ''[[DumbLand]]'' (2002) and the surreal sitcom ''[[Rabbits (film)|Rabbits]]'' (2002). Lynch and Frost reunited for the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] limited series ''[[Twin Peaks (2017 TV series)|Twin Peaks: The Return]]'' (2017), with Lynch co-writing and directing every episode.

Lynch's other artistic endeavours include: his work as a musician, encompassing two solo albums—''[[Crazy Clown Time]]'' (2011) and ''[[The Big Dream]]'' (2013)—as well as music and [[sound design]] for a variety of his films; painting and photography; writing three books—''[[Images (book)|Images]]'' (1994), ''[[Catching the Big Fish]]'' (2006), and Room to Dream (2018); and directing several music videos and advertisements, including the [[Dior]] promotional film ''[[Lady Blue Shanghai]]'' (2006). An avid practitioner of [[Transcendental Meditation]] (TM), Lynch founded the [[David Lynch Foundation]] in 2005, which sought to fund the teaching of TM in schools and has since widened its scope to other at-risk populations, including the homeless, veterans and refugees.

==Early life==
{{main|Early life of David Lynch}}
{{Quote box|width=275px|align=right|quote=My childhood was elegant homes, tree-lined streets, the milkman, building backyard forts, droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees.

Because I grew up in a perfect world, other things were a contrast.|source= —David Lynch&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Lynch was born in [[Missoula, Montana]], on January 20, 1946.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Donald Walton Lynch (1915–2007), was a research scientist working for the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], and his mother, Edwina "Sunny" Lynch (''née'' Sundholm; 1919–2004), was an English language tutor. Two of Lynch's maternal great-grandparents were [[Finns|Finnish]], and had immigrated to the [[United States]] from [[Finland]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nojesguiden.se/artiklar/david-lynch-%E2%80%9Dden-haer-vaerlden-aer-full-av-hat-och-angest%E2%80%9D David Lynch: "Den Här Världen Är Full Av Hat Och Ångest"] {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch was raised a [[Presbyterian]].&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite news|author=Williams, Alex|url=http://www.culteducation.com/reference/tm/tm150.html|title=David Lynch's Shockingly Peaceful Inner Life|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 31, 2007|accessdate=November 29, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130910174717/http://www.culteducation.com/reference/tm/tm150.html|archivedate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadighian"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sadighian, David|url=http://www.globalgoodnews.com/education-news-a.html?art=1128100751793764|title=David Lynch thinks we're all lightbulbs. What?|publisher=Yale Daily News|date=October 1, 2005|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lynch family often moved around according to where the USDA assigned Donald. It was because of this that when he was two months old, Lynch moved with his parents to [[Sandpoint, Idaho]], and only two years after that, following the birth of his brother John, the family moved to [[Spokane, Washington]]. It was here that Lynch's sister Martha was born. The family then moved to [[Durham, North Carolina]], then [[Boise, Idaho]], and then [[Alexandria, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Lynch found this transitory early life relatively easy to adjust to, noting that he found it fairly easy to meet new friends whenever he started attending a new school.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on much of his early life, Lynch has remarked:

{{quote|I found the world completely and totally fantastic as a child. Of course, I had the usual fears, like going to school&amp;nbsp;... For me, back then, school was a crime against young people. It destroyed the seeds of liberty. The teachers didn't encourage knowledge or a positive attitude.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alongside his schooling, Lynch joined the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], although he would later note that he only "became [a Scout] so I could quit and put it behind me". He rose to the highest rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]. It was through being an Eagle Scout that he was present with other Boy Scouts outside of the [[White House]] at the [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]], which took place on Lynch's birthday in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 05.&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch had become interested in painting and drawing from an early age, becoming intrigued by the idea of pursuing it as a career path when living in Virginia, where his friend's father was a professional painter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Francis C. Hammond High School in Alexandria, Lynch did poorly academically, having little interest in school work, but was popular with other students, and after leaving decided that he wanted to study painting at college, beginning his studies at the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] in 1964, where he was a roommate of [[Peter Wolf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter'sBio|url=http://www.peterwolf.com/bio/index2.html|work=Peter Wolf|publisher=Peter Wolf|accessdate=August 16, 2012|author=Wolf, Peter|year=2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615152715/http://www.peterwolf.com/bio/index2.html|archivedate=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he left the School of the Museum of Fine Arts after only a year, stating that "I was not inspired AT ALL in that place", and instead deciding that he wanted to travel around [[Europe]] for three years with his friend [[Jack Fisk]], who was similarly unhappy with his studies at [[Cooper Union]]. They had some hopes that in Europe they could train with the [[expressionism|expressionist]] painter [[Oskar Kokoschka]] at his school. Upon reaching [[Salzburg]], however, they found that he was not available and, disillusioned, returned to the United States after spending only 15 days of their planned three years in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Philadelphia and short films: 1966–1970===
Back in the United States, Lynch returned to Virginia, but since his parents had moved to [[Walnut Creek, California]], he stayed with his friend Toby Keeler for a while. He decided to move to the city of [[Philadelphia]] and enroll at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], after advice from Jack Fisk, who was already enrolled there. He preferred this college to his previous school in Boston, claiming that "In Philadelphia there were great and serious painters, and everybody was inspiring one another and it was a beautiful time there."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that he began a relationship with a fellow student, Peggy Reavey, and they were married in 1967. The following year, Peggy gave birth to their daughter Jennifer. Later describing this situation, Peggy stated that "[Lynch] definitely was a reluctant father, but a very loving one. Hey, I was pregnant when we got married. We were both reluctant."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; As a family, they moved to the [[Fairmount, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Fairmount]] neighborhood of Philadelphia, where they were able to purchase a large 12-room house for the relatively low price of $3,500 due to the high crime and poverty rates in the area. Later describing living there, Lynch stated that

{{quote|We lived cheap, but the city was full of fear. A kid was shot to death down the street&amp;nbsp;... We were robbed twice, had windows shot out and a car stolen. The house was first broken into only three days after we moved in&amp;nbsp;... The feeling was so close to extreme danger, and the fear was so intense. There was violence and hate and filth. But the biggest influence in my whole life was that city.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Meanwhile, to help financially support his family alongside his art studies, he took up a job printing engravings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Pennsylvania Academy  Lynch made his first [[short film]], which was titled ''[[Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)]]'' (1967). He had first come up with the idea when he developed a wish to see his paintings move, and he subsequently began discussing the idea of creating an [[animation]] with an artist named Bruce Samuelson. When this project never came about, Lynch decided to work on a film alone, and so purchased the cheapest 16mm camera that he could find in order to do so. Taking one of the abandoned upper rooms of the Academy as a working space, he spent $150&lt;ref name="The Short Films of David Lynch"&gt;{{cite film|title=The Short Films of David Lynch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – which at the time he felt to be a lot of money – to produce ''Six Men Getting Sick''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the work as "57&amp;nbsp;seconds of growth and fire, and three seconds of vomit", Lynch played the film on a loop at the Academy's annual end-of-year exhibit, where it shared joint first prize with a painting by Noel Mahaffey.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a commission from one of his fellow students, the wealthy H. Barton Wasserman, who offered him $1000 to create a film installation in his home. Spending $478.28 of that on purchasing the second-hand [[Bolex]] camera "of [his] dreams", Lynch produced a new animated short, but upon getting the film developed, realized that the result was simply a blurred, frameless print. As he would later relate, "So I called up Bart [Wasserman] and said, 'Bart, the film is a disaster. The camera was broken and what I've done hasn't turned out.' And he said, 'Don't worry, David, take the rest of the money and make something else for me. Just give me a print.' End of story."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lynch The Alphabet.jpg|thumb|left|The opening title of ''The Alphabet'', Lynch's second short film, and the first to include live action elements]] --&gt;

Using this leftover money, Lynch decided to experiment on making a work that was a mix of animation with [[live action]], producing a four-minute short called ''[[The Alphabet (film)|The Alphabet]]'' (1968). The film starred Lynch's wife Peggy as a character known as The Girl, who chants the [[alphabet]] to a series of images of horses before dying at the end by hemorrhaging blood all over her bed sheets. Adding a sound effect, Lynch used a broken [[Uher (brand)|Uher]] tape recorder to record the sound of his baby daughter Jennifer crying, creating a distorted sound that Lynch felt to be particularly effective. Later describing what had inspired him, Lynch stated that "Peggy's niece was having a bad dream one night and was saying the alphabet in her sleep in a tormented way. So that's sort of what started ''The Alphabet'' going. The rest of it was just [[subconscious]]."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning about the newly founded [[American Film Institute]], which gave grants to film makers who could support their application with a prior work and a script for a new project, Lynch decided to send them a copy of ''The Alphabet'' along with a script that he had written for a new short film, one that would be almost entirely live action, named ''[[The Short Films of David Lynch#The Grandmother|The Grandmother]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute agreed to help finance the work, initially offering him $5000 out of his requested budget of $7,200, but later granting him the additional $2,200 that he had requested. Starring people he knew from both work and college and filmed in his own house,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 44–47.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Grandmother'' featured a neglected boy who "grows" a grandmother from a seed to care for him. The film critics Michelle Le Blanc and Colin Odell later remarked that "this film is a true oddity but contains many of the themes and ideas that would filter into his later work, and shows a remarkable grasp of the medium".&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Angeles and ''Eraserhead'': 1971–1979===
[[File:Eraserhead.jpg|thumb|right|Lynch's ''Eraserhead'', featuring Henry Spencer ([[Jack Nance]])]]
In 1971, Lynch moved with his wife and daughter to [[Los Angeles]], where he began studying filmmaking at the [[AFI Conservatory]], a place that he would later describe as being "completely chaotic and disorganized, which was great&amp;nbsp;... you quickly learned that if you were going to get something done, you would have to do it yourself. They wanted to let people do their thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; He began writing a script for a proposed work titled ''Gardenback'', which had "unfolded from this painting I'd done". In this venture he was supported by a number of figures at the Conservatory, who encouraged him to lengthen the script and add more dialogue, something that he reluctantly agreed to do. Nonetheless, with all the interference on his ''Gardenback'' project, he became fed up with the Conservatory and quit after returning to start the second year and being put in first year classes. Dean of the AFI, Frank Daniel, asked Lynch to reconsider, believing that he was one of the school's best students. Lynch agreed on the condition that he could create his own project that would not be interfered with. Feeling that ''Gardenback'' was "wrecked", he instead set about on a new film, which he called ''[[Eraserhead]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that the film was planned to be about forty-two minutes long (it ended up being eighty-nine minutes long), the script for ''Eraserhead'' was only 21 pages long, and Lynch was able to create the film free from interference. Filming, which began on May 29, 1972, took place at night in some abandoned stables, allowing the production team, which was largely Lynch and some of his friends, including [[Sissy Spacek]], [[Jack Fisk]], cinematographer [[Frederick Elmes]] and sound designer [[Alan Splet]] to set up a camera room, green room, editing room, sets as well as a food room and a bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, funding for the project came from the [[American Film Institute|AFI]], who gave Lynch a $10,000 grant, but it was not enough to complete the work, and under pressure from studios after the success of the relatively cheap feature film ''[[Easy Rider]]'', they were unable to provide him with any more. Lynch was then supported by a loan from his father, and by money that he was able to bring in from a paper route that he took up delivering the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 76 and 60.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Not long into the production of ''Eraserhead'', Lynch and his wife Peggy amicably separated and divorced, and so he began living full-time on set. In 1977, Lynch would remarry, this time to Mary Fisk, sister of Jack Fisk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 60, 80, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch has stated that not a single reviewer of the film understood it the way that he intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite film|title=Eraserhead Stories|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2018}} Filmed in [[black and white]], ''Eraserhead'' tells the story of a quiet young man named Henry ([[Jack Nance]]) living in a [[dystopia]]n industrial wasteland, whose girlfriend gives birth to a deformed baby whom she leaves in his care. It was heavily influenced by the fearful mood of Philadelphia, and Lynch referred to the film as "my ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|Philadelphia Story]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "cehwte"&gt;{{cite interview |title=tip Filmjahrbuch Nr. 1 (1985) |trans-title=tip Film Yearbook No. 1 (1985) |url=http://www.davidlynch.de/tiplynchtrans.html |subject=David Lynch |interviewer=Herman Weigel |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5msckwCb2?url=http://www.davidlynch.de/tiplynchtrans.html |archive-date=January 18, 2010 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to financial problems the filming of ''Eraserhead'' was haphazard, regularly stopping and starting again. It was in one such break in 1974 that Lynch created a short film titled ''The Amputee'', which  is a short one-shot film about two minutes long. David Lynch proposed that he make the film which would become ''The Amputee'' to present to AFI to test two different types of film stock{{full citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

''Eraserhead'' was finally finished in 1976, after five years of production. Lynch subsequently tried to get the film entered into the [[Cannes Film Festival]], but while some reviewers liked it, others felt that it was awful, and so it was not selected for screening. Similarly, reviewers from the [[New York Film Festival]] also rejected it, though it was screened at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]], where [[Ben Barenholtz]], the distributor of the [[Elgin Theater]], heard about it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; He was very supportive of the movie, helping to distribute it around the United States in 1977, and ''Eraserhead'' subsequently became popular on the [[midnight movie]] underground circuit,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and was later described as one of the most important midnight movies of the seventies along with ''[[El Topo]]'', ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', ''[[The Harder They Come]]'' and ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=457414|title=Midnight Movies: From the Margin to the Mainstream}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acclaimed film maker [[Stanley Kubrick]] said that it was one of his all-time favorite films.&lt;ref name="lynch77"&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Elephant Man'' and mainstream success: 1980–1982===
After the cult success of ''Eraserhead'' on the underground circuit, [[Stuart Cornfeld]], an executive producer for [[Mel Brooks]], saw it and later remarked that "I was just 100 percent blown away&amp;nbsp;... I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever seen. It was such a cleansing experience."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Contacting Lynch, he agreed to help him with his next planned project, a film titled ''[[Ronnie Rocket]]'' for which Lynch had already written a script. However, Lynch soon realized that ''Ronnie Rocket'', a film that he described as being about "electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair", was not going to be picked up by any financiers, and so he asked Cornfeld to find him a script written by someone else which he could direct. Cornfeld found him four possible scripts. On hearing the title of the first, ''The Elephant Man'', Lynch chose the script.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Elephant Man'' script, written by Chris de Vore and [[Eric Bergren]], was based on a true story, that of [[Joseph Merrick]], a heavily deformed man living in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London, who was held in a sideshow but was later taken under the care of a London surgeon, [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]]. Lynch wanted to make some alterations that would alter the story from true events, but in his view make a better plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order to do so he would have to get the permission of [[Mel Brooks]], whose company, [[Brooksfilms]], would be responsible for production; subsequently Brooks viewed ''Eraserhead'', and after coming out of the screening theatre, embraced Lynch, declaring that "You're a madman, I love you! You're in."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting film, ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'', starred [[John Hurt]] as John Merrick (his name was changed from Joseph), as well as [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Frederick Treves. Filming took place in London, and Lynch brought his own distinctively surrealist approach to the film, filming it in color stock black and white. Nonetheless it has been described as "one of the most conventional" of his films.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Elephant Man'' was a huge critical and commercial success, and earned eight [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Lynch personally.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The De Laurentiis films, ''Dune'' and ''Blue Velvet'': 1983–1986===
Following on from the success of ''The Elephant Man'', the filmmaker [[George Lucas]], himself a fan of ''Eraserhead'', offered Lynch the opportunity to direct the third film in his ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy, ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''. Lynch refused, arguing that Lucas should direct the film himself as the movie should reflect his own vision, not Lynch's take on it.&lt;ref name = "cehwte" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lynch113"&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, however, the opportunity to direct another big-budget [[science fiction]] epic arose when [[Dino de Laurentiis]] of the [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]] asked him to create a film adaptation of [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (1965).&lt;ref name="lynch113"/&gt; Lynch agreed, and in doing so was also contractually obliged to produce two other works for the company. He then set about writing a script based upon the original novel, initially with both Chris de Vore and Eric Bergren, and then just by himself when De Laurentiis wasn't happy with their ideas.&lt;ref name="lynch115"&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch also helped build some of the sets, attempting to create "a certain look" for the film, and he particularly enjoyed building the set for the [[oil]] planet of [[Giedi Prime]], for which he "used steel, bolts, and porcelain to construct" it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dune'' is set in the far future, when humans live in an interstellar empire under a [[feudalism|feudal system]]. The main character, [[Paul Atreides]] (played by [[Kyle MacLachlan]]), is the son of a noble who takes control of the [[desert planet]] [[Arrakis]], which grows the rare spice [[melange (fictional drug)|melange]], the most highly prized commodity in the empire. Lynch, however, was unhappy with the work, later remarking that "''Dune'' was a kind of studio film. I didn't have [[final cut privilege|final cut]]. And, little by little, I was subconsciously making compromises" [to his own vision].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his footage was eventually removed from the final theatrical cut, dramatically condensing the plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt; Although De Laurentiis hoped it would be as successful as ''Star Wars'', Lynch's ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'' (1984) was a critical and commercial dud; it had cost $45 million to make, and grossed a mere $27.4 million domestically. Later on, [[Universal Studios]] released an "extended cut" of the film for syndicated television, containing almost an hour of cutting-room-floor footage and new narration. Such was not representative of Lynch's intentions, but the studio considered it more comprehensible than the original two-hour version. Lynch objected to these changes and had his name struck from the extended cut, which has "[[Alan Smithee]]" credited as the director and "Judas Booth" (a pseudonym which Lynch himself invented, inspired by his own feelings of betrayal) as the screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5JwyKjpH2QC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41 |title=The cinema of David Lynch: American dreams, nightmare visions |author1=Erica Sheen |author2=Annette Davison |publisher=Wallflower Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-903364-85-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in 1983, he had begun the writing and drawing of a comic strip, ''[[The Angriest Dog in the World]]'', which featured unchanging graphics of a tethered dog that was so angry that it could not move, alongside cryptic philosophical references. It ran from 1983 until 1992 in the ''[[Village Voice]]'', ''[[Creative Loafing]]'' and other tabloid and alternative publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; It was around this period that Lynch also became interested in [[photography]] as an art form, and travelled to northern England to take photos of the degrading industrial landscape, something that he was particularly interested in.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 109–111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following on from ''Dune'', Lynch was contractually still obliged to produce two other projects for De Laurentiis: the first of these was a planned sequel, which due to the film's lack of success never went beyond the script stage.&lt;ref name="lynch115"/&gt; The other was a more personal work, based upon a script that Lynch had been working on for some time. Developing from ideas that Lynch had had since 1973, the resulting film, ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'', was set in the fictional town of Lumberton, USA, and revolves around a college student named Jeffrey Beaumont ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), who finds a severed ear in a field. Subsequently, investigating further with the help of friend Sandy ([[Laura Dern]]), he uncovers that it is related to a criminal gang led by psychopath [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] ([[Dennis Hopper]]), who has kidnapped the husband and child of singer Dorothy Vallens ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) and repeatedly subjects her to [[rape]]. Lynch himself characterizes the story as "a dream of strange desires wrapped inside a mystery story".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the film, Lynch decided to include pop songs from the 1960s, including "[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]" by [[Roy Orbison]] and "[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]]" by [[Bobby Vinton]], the latter of which was largely inspirational for the film, with Lynch stating that "It was the song that sparked the movie&amp;nbsp;... There was something mysterious about it. It made me think about things. And the first things I thought about were [[lawn]]s – lawns and the neighborhood."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Other music for the film was also produced, this time composed by [[Angelo Badalamenti]], who would go on to produce the music for most of Lynch's subsequent cinematic works.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 130–132.&lt;/ref&gt; Dino de Laurentiis loved the film, and it achieved support from some of the early specialist screenings, but the preview screenings to a mainstream audience were instead highly negative, with most of the audience hating the film.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 148–149.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lynch had found success previously with ''The Elephant Man'', ''Blue Velvet''{{'}}s controversy with audiences and critics introduced him into the mainstream, and it became a huge critical and moderate commercial success. The film earned Lynch his second [[Academy Award for Best Director|Academy Award nomination for Best Director]]. [[Woody Allen]], whose film ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], said that ''Blue Velvet'' was his favorite film of the year.&lt;ref name="Peary"&gt;{{cite book | title = Cult Movies 3 | first = Danny | last = Peary | year = 1988 | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. | location = New York | pages = 38–42 | isbn = 0-671-64810-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Twin Peaks'', ''Wild at Heart'' and ''Fire Walk with Me'': 1987–1996===
[[File:David Lynch at the 1990 Emmy Awards.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lynch at the 1990 [[Emmy Awards]] ceremony]]
During the late 1980s, Lynch had begun to work in [[television]] as well as cinema, directing a short piece titled ''The Cowboy and the Frenchman'' for French television in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, he met the television producer [[Mark Frost]], who had formerly worked on such projects as the television police series ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', and they decided to start working together on a biopic of singer and actress [[Marilyn Monroe]] based upon Anthony Summers's book, ''The Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe''. While this project never got off the ground, the duo went on to work on a comedy script named ''One Saliva Bubble'', but that did not see completion either.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; While they were talking in a coffee shop, Lynch and Frost had the idea of a corpse washing up on the shore of a lake, and subsequently set about on their third project, initially called ''Northwest Passage'' but would eventually become the television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (1990–1991).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;
A drama series set in a small [[Washington (state)|Washington]] town where popular high school student [[Laura Palmer]] has been murdered, ''Twin Peaks'' featured [[FBI]] [[Dale Cooper|Special Agent Dale Cooper]] ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]) as the investigator trying to unearth the killer, and discovering not only the [[supernatural]] elements to the murder but also the secrets of many of the local townsfolk; as Lynch himself summed it up, "The project was to mix a police investigation with the ordinary lives of the characters." Lynch later revealed that "[Mark Frost and I] worked together, especially in the initial stages. Later on we started working more apart." They pitched the series to the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Network]], who agreed to finance the [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] and eventually commissioned the first season, comprising seven episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 157–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second season went into production soon on 22 additional episodes. Lynch himself only directed six episodes of the series, devoting his time to working on the film ''Wild at Heart'', but carefully chose the directors for other episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch appeared in several episodes of the series as the deaf FBI agent [[Gordon Cole (Twin Peaks)|Gordon Cole]]. The series was a success, with high ratings both in the United States and in many nations abroad, and soon spawned a cult following. Executives at the ABC Network, however, believed that public interest in the show was decreasing. The network insisted that Lynch and Frost reveal who the killer of Laura Palmer was prematurely, which they begrudgingly agreed to do.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch felt that agreeing to do so is one of his biggest professional regrets.&lt;ref&gt;"A Slice of Lynch", a featurette included in the ''Twin Peaks Definitive Gold Box Edition'' DVD set, October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the revealing of the murderer and the series' move from Thursday to Saturday night, ''Twin Peaks'' continued for several more episodes, but was cancelled following a ratings drop. Lynch, who disliked the direction that the writers and directors took in the previous episodes, directed the final episode. He ended the season on a [[cliffhanger]], later remarking that "that's not the ending. That's the ending that people were stuck with."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''Twin Peaks'' was in production, the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] asked Lynch and the composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]], who had been responsible for the music in ''Twin Peaks'', to create a theatrical piece which would be performed only twice in 1989 as a part of the [[New Music America Festival]]. The result was ''[[Industrial Symphony No. 1]]: The Dream of the Broken Hearted'', which starred frequent Lynch collaborators such as [[Laura Dern]], [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Michael J. Anderson]], and contained five songs sung by [[Julee Cruise]]. David Lynch produced a fifty-minute video of the performance in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Lynch was also involved in the creation of various [[commercials]] for different companies, including perfume companies like [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Calvin Klein]] and [[Giorgio Armani]] and the Japanese coffee company Namoi, which featured a Japanese man searching the town of Twin Peaks for his missing wife.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 211–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=275px|align=right|quote=1990 was Lynch's annus mirabilis: ''Wild at Heart'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at [[Cannes]], and the television series ''Twin Peaks'' was proving a smash hit with audiences across the world. The musical/performance piece ''Industrial Symphony No. 1'', which Lynch had staged with Angelo Badalamenti at the Brooklyn Academy of music, had spawned the album ''Floating into the Night'' and launched singer [[Julee Cruise]]. Five one-man exhibitions between 1989 and 1991 emphasized Lynch's roots in fine art and painting, and a rash of ads (including a teaser trailer for [[Michael Jackson]]'s 'Dangerous' tour) confirmed the demand for the Lynch touch&amp;nbsp;...

[[File:David Lynch Cannes.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lynch at the [[1990 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
While Lynch was working on the first few episodes of ''Twin Peaks'', his friend [[Monty Montgomery (producer)|Monty Montgomery]] "gave me a book that he wanted to direct as a movie. He asked if I would maybe be [[executive producer]] or something, and I said 'That's great, Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?' And he said, 'In that case, you can do it yourself'." The book was [[Barry Gifford]]'s novel ''Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula'', which told the tale of two lovers on a road trip. Lynch felt that it was "just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; With Gifford's support, Lynch adapted the novel into a film called ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'', a [[crime fiction|crime]] and [[road movie]] starring [[Nicolas Cage]] as Sailor and [[Laura Dern]] as Lula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/film/2010/01/lynch-prosthetic-god-world|title=His dark  materials|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing his plot as a "strange blend" of "a road picture, a love story, a psychological drama and a violent comedy", Lynch altered much from the original novel, changing the ending and incorporating numerous references to the classic film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 193–194, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite receiving a muted response from American critics and viewers, it won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1990 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="cannes-1990.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/164/year/1990.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Wild at Heart |accessdate=August 7, 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following on from the success of ''Wild at Heart'', Lynch decided to return to the world of the now-cancelled ''Twin Peaks'', this time without Mark Frost, to create a film that acted primarily as a prequel but also, in part, as a sequel, with Lynch stating that "I liked the idea of the story going back and forth in time."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The result, ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' (1992), primarily revolved around the last few days in the life of Laura Palmer, and was much "darker" in tone than the television series, having much of the humour removed, and dealing with such topics as [[incest]] and [[murder]]. Lynch himself stated that the film was about "the loneliness, shame, guilt, confusion and devastation of the victim of incest". ''Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me'' was financed by the company CIBY-2000, and most of the cast of the series agreed to reprise their roles for the film, although some refused and many were not enthusiastic about the project.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 184–187.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a commercial and critical failure in the United States; however, it was a hit in Japan and some critics, such as [[Mark Kermode]], have hailed it as Lynch's "masterpiece".&lt;ref name="Kermode, Mark"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kermode | first = Mark | coauthors = | title = David Lynch | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = February 8, 2007 | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2011369,00.html | accessdate =October 27, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Lynch worked with Mark Frost on some new television shows. After ''Twin Peaks'', they produced a series of documentaries titled ''[[American Chronicles]]'' (1990) which examined life across the United States, the comedy series ''[[On the Air (TV series)|On the Air]]'' (1992), which was cancelled after only three episodes had aired, and the three-episode [[HBO]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Hotel Room]]'' (1993) about events that happen in one hotel room but on different dates.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 82–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Lost Highway'', ''The Straight Story'' and ''Mulholland Drive'': 1997–2001===
Following these unsuccessful television ventures, Lynch returned to making feature films. In 1997 he released the non-linear, [[film noir|noiresque]] ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'', which was co-written by Barry Gifford and starred [[Bill Pullman]] and [[Patricia Arquette]]. The film failed commercially and received a mixed response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lost Highway (1997)|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Lost-Highway#tab=summary|website=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lost Highway Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lost-highway|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''Lost Highway'', Lynch began work directing a film from a script written by [[Mary Sweeney]] and [[John E. Roach]]. The resulting motion picture, ''[[The Straight Story]]'' was based upon a true story: that of [[Alvin Straight]] (played in the film by [[Richard Farnsworth]]), an elderly man from [[Laurens, Iowa|Laurens]], [[Iowa]], who goes on a three hundred mile journey to visit his sick brother (played by [[Harry Dean Stanton]]) in [[Mount Zion, Wisconsin]], riding a [[lawnmower]] for the entire journey. Commenting on why he chose this script, Lynch said that "that's what I fell in love with next", and displayed his admiration for Straight, describing him as "like [[James Dean]], except he's old".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 247, 252.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angelo Badalamenti]] again produced the music for the film, although it was "very different from the kind of score he's done for [Lynch] in the past".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many differences with his earlier films, ''[[The Straight Story]]'' did not contain profanities, sexual content or violence; it was rated G (general viewing) by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which came as "shocking news" to many in the film industry, who were surprised that it "did not disturb, offend or mystify".&lt;ref name="lynch245"&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; As Le Blanc and Odell stated, the plot made it "seem as far removed from Lynch's earlier works as could be imagined, but in fact right from the very opening, this is entirely his film – a surreal road movie".&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Lynch approached [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] once again with ideas for a television [[drama]]. The network gave Lynch the go-ahead to shoot a two-hour pilot for the series ''Mulholland Drive'', but disputes over content and running time led to the project being shelved indefinitely. However, with seven million dollars from the French [[production company]] [[StudioCanal]], Lynch completed the pilot as a film, ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''. The film, a non-linear narrative surrealist tale of the dark side of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], stars [[Naomi Watts]], [[Laura Harring]] and [[Justin Theroux]]. The film performed relatively well at the [[box office]] worldwide and was a critical success, earning Lynch a [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director]] prize at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]] (shared with [[Joel Coen]] for ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]'') and a Best Director award from the New York Film Critics Association. In addition, Lynch received his third Academy Award nomination for Best Director.&lt;ref name="oscar-db"&gt;{{cite web|title=Academy Award Database: Lynch, David|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=13035139382341|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113073650/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=13035139382341|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 13, 2012|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the film was named the top film of the 21st century by the BBC following a poll of 177 film critics from 36 countries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Brown |title=Mulholland Drive leads the pack in list of 21st century's top films |newspaper=The Guardian |date=August 22, 2016 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/23/mulholland-drive-david-lynch-21st-century-top-films-bbc-poll |accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet work and ''Inland Empire'': 2002–2013 ===
With the rising popularity of the [[Internet]], Lynch decided to utilize it as a new distribution channel, releasing several new series that he had created exclusively on his website, davidlynch.com. In 2002, he created a series of online shorts named ''[[DumbLand]]''. Intentionally crude both in content and execution, the eight-episode series was later released on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's Just Lynch|url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/screen/its_just_lynch-38410479.html|accessdate=August 16, 2012|newspaper=Philadelphia Weekly|date=January 4, 2006|author=Leo Charney|agency=Review Publishing Limited Partnership|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912101457/http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/screen/its_just_lynch-38410479.html|archivedate=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Lynch released a surreal [[sitcom]] on his website called ''[[Rabbits (film)|Rabbits]]'', about a family of humanoid rabbits. Later, he made his experiments with [[DV|Digital Video]] available in the form of the Japanese-style horror short ''[[Darkened Room]]''. In 2006, Lynch's feature film ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' was released. At three hours long, it was the longest of Lynch's films. Like ''Mulholland Drive'' and ''Lost Highway'' before it, the film did not follow a traditional narrative structure. It starred Lynch regulars [[Laura Dern]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]] and [[Justin Theroux]], with cameos by [[Naomi Watts]] and Laura Harring (voices of Suzie and Jane Rabbit), and a performance by [[Jeremy Irons]]. Lynch described the piece as "a mystery about a woman in trouble". In an effort to promote the film, Lynch made appearances with a cow and a placard bearing the slogan "Without cheese there would be no ''Inland Empire''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-02-07/entertainment/17233482_1_inland-empire-bird-feeders-squirrels |title=Lynch dives within |author=Neva Chonin |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a non-standard narrative, the film was based on the true story of an actor who committed [[matricide]] while acting in a production of the [[Oresteia]], and starred [[Grace Zabriskie]], a Lynch regular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kay|first=Jeremy|date=June 22, 2010|accessdate=September 1, 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Werner Herzog: a killer at the table|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/22/werner-herzog-david-lynch|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Lynch began making guest appearances on the ''[[Family Guy]]'' spin-off ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' as [[List of The Cleveland Show characters#Others|Gus the Bartender]]. He had been convinced to appear in the show by its lead actor, [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]], who is a fan of Lynch and who felt that his whole life had changed after seeing ''Wild at Heart''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Faye | first = Denis | url = http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=3802 | title = A Kinder, Gentler Family Guy | publisher = Writers Guild of America, West | accessdate = November 29, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101130153215/http://wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=3802 | archivedate = November 30, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lady Blue Shanghai]]'' is a 16-minute promotional film that was written, directed and edited by Lynch for [[Dior]]. It was released on the Internet in May 2010.

Lynch directed a concert by English [[new wave music|new wave]] band [[Duran Duran]] on March 23, 2011. The concert was [[Streaming media|streamed live]] on YouTube from the [[Mayan Theater]] in Los Angeles as the kickoff to the second season of ''[[Unstaged: An Original Series from American Express]]''. "The idea is to try and create on the fly, layers of images permeating Duran Duran on the stage", Lynch said. "A world of experimentation and hopefully some happy accidents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Lewis | first = Dave | url=http://www.hitfix.com/articles/duran-duran-david-lynch-team-for-unstaged-streaming-concert |title=Watch: David Lynch, Duran Duran team for 'Unstaged' streaming concert |publisher=www.HitFix.com |accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animated short ''I Touch a Red Button Man'', a collaboration between Lynch and the band [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]], played in the background during Interpol's concert at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] in April 2011.

It was believed that Lynch was going to retire from the [[film industry]]; according to [[Abel Ferrara]], Lynch "doesn't even want to make films any more. I've talked to him about it, OK?

=== Reviving ''Twin Peaks'': 2014–present ===
[[File:David Lynch and Kyle MacLachlan at the Twin Peaks Premiere 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Lynch (left) with [[Kyle MacLachlan]] at the 2017 premiere of ''[[Twin Peaks: The Return]]''.]]
On October 6, 2014, Lynch confirmed via [[Twitter]] that he would start shooting together with Mark Frost a new, nine-episode season of ''[[Twin Peaks (2017 TV series)|Twin Peaks]]'' in 2015, with the episodes expected to air in early 2016 on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]].&lt;ref name="revival"&gt;{{cite web |title=Twin Peaks Revival to Air on Showtime in 2016 |url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/twin-peaks-revival-to-air-on-showtime-in-2016-1201322329 |work=Variety |first=Cynthia |last=Littleton |date=October 6, 2014 |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch and Frost wrote all nine episodes. On April 5, 2015, Lynch announced via Twitter that the project was still alive, but he was no longer going to direct because the budget was too low for what he wanted to do.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Stedman, [https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/twin-peaks-david-lych-leaves-as-director-1201466709/ "David Lynch Says He Won’t Direct the ‘Twin Peaks’ Revival"], ''Variety'', April 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later announced on May 15, 2015, via Twitter, that he would indeed be returning to the revival, as he had sorted out his issues with Showtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCown|first1=Alex|title=David Lynch just announced he’s rejoined Showtime’s ''Twin Peaks''|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/david-lynch-just-announced-hes-rejoined-showtimes--219531|website=[[The A.V.

While doing press for ''Twin Peaks'', he was again asked if he was retired from film and confirmed that he had made his last feature film, responding, "Things changed a lot...

Since the last episode of ''The Return'' aired, there has been speculation on whether there will be a fourth season of ''Twin Peaks'' or not. Though Lynch has not denied the possibility of another season, he has said it would be unlikely to air before 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitovich|first1=Matt|title=Twin Peaks: David Lynch Lays Out Timetable for Any Potential Season 4|url=http://tvline.com/2017/09/15/twin-peaks-season-4-premiere-date-year-2021/|website=TV Line}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinematic influences and themes==

===Influences===
{{Quote box|width=275px|align=right|quote=I look at the world and I see absurdity all around me. People do strange things constantly, to the point that, for the most part, we manage not to see it.

Lynch says that his work is more similar in many respects to that of European filmmakers than American ones, believing that most films that "get down and thrill your soul" are from European directors.&lt;ref name="lynch62"&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch has commented on his admiration for such film makers as [[Federico Fellini]],&lt;ref name="lynch62"/&gt; [[Werner Herzog]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject=David Lynch |interviewer=Diego Schonhals |publication-date=Oct 13, 2007 |title=David Lynch Favorites Movies and FilmMakers |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s7EwOeowU }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Polanski]], and [[Jacques Tati]],&lt;ref name="lynch62"/&gt; along with the American movie directors [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Billy Wilder]]. He has stated that [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950) is one of his favourite motion pictures,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; as is Kubrick's ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also cited [[Herk Harvey]]'s ''[[Carnival of Souls]]'' (1962) and [[Jerzy Skolimowski]]'s ''[[Deep End (film)|Deep End]]'' (1970) as an influence on his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moviefone.com/2007/10/12/retro-cinema-carnival-of-souls/|title=Retro Cinema: Carnival of Souls|website=''Moviefone''|date=October 12, 2007|accessdate=February 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218064656/https://www.moviefone.com/2007/10/12/retro-cinema-carnival-of-souls/|archive-date=February 18, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motifs===
There are several recurring themes within Lynch's work, leading film critics Le Blanc and Odell to state that "his films are so packed with motifs, recurrent characters, images, compositions and techniques that you could view his entire output as one large jigsaw puzzle of ideas".&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 08.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key themes that they noted was the usage of dreams and [[dreamlike]] imagery and structure within his works, something they related to the "[[surrealist]] ethos" of relying "on the [[subconscious]] to provide visual drive". This can be seen in [[Joseph Merrick|John Merrick]]'s dream of his mother in ''The Elephant Man'', [[Dale Cooper|Agent Cooper]]'s dreams of the red room in ''Twin Peaks'' and the "dreamlike logic" of the narrative found in ''Eraserhead'', ''Mulholland Drive'' and ''Inland Empire''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing his attitude to dreams, Lynch has stated that "Waking dreams are the ones that are important, the ones that come when I'm quietly sitting in a chair, letting my mind wander. When you sleep, you don't control your dream. I like to dive into a dream world that I've made or discovered; a world I choose&amp;nbsp;... [You can't really get others to experience it, but] right there is the power of cinema."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; His films are known for their use of [[magic realism]].

Another of Lynch's prominent themes is [[industry]], with repeated imagery of "the clunk of machinery, the power of pistons, shadows of oil drills pumping, screaming woodmills and smoke billowing factories", as can be seen with the industrial wasteland in ''Eraserhead'', the factories in ''The Elephant Man'', the sawmill in ''Twin Peaks'' and the lawn mower in ''The Straight Story''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing his interest in such things, Lynch stated that "It makes me feel good to see giant machinery, you know, working: dealing with molten metal. And I like fire and smoke. And the sounds are so powerful. It's just big stuff. It means that things are being made, and I really like that."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theme is the dark underbelly of violent criminal activity within a society, such as with Frank's gang in ''Blue Velvet'' and the cocaine smugglers in ''Twin Peaks''. The idea of [[deformity]] is also found in several of Lynch's films, from ''The Elephant Man'' to the deformed baby in ''Eraserhead'', as well as death from head wounds, found in most of Lynch's films. Other imagery commonly used in Lynch's works are flickering electricity or lights, fire and stages upon which a singer performs, often surrounded by drapery.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"/&gt;

With the exception of ''The Elephant Man'' and ''Dune'', which are set in [[Victorian London]] and [[Duniverse|a fictitious galaxy]] respectively, all of Lynch's films have been set in the United States, and he has stated that "I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels right to me to, you know, make American films."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of his works, including ''Blue Velvet'', ''Twin Peaks'' and ''Lost Highway'' are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture despite being set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch stated that "It was a fantastic decade in a lot of ways&amp;nbsp;... there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were laying the groundwork for a disastrous future."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch also tends to feature his leading female actors in "split" roles, so that many of his female characters have multiple, fractured identities. This practice began with his choice to cast [[Sheryl Lee]] as both [[Laura Palmer]] and her cousin [[Maddy Ferguson]] in ''Twin Peaks'' and continued in his later works. In ''Lost Highway'', [[Patricia Arquette]] plays the dual role of Renee Madison/Alice Wakefield, while in ''Mulholland Drive'' [[Naomi Watts]] plays Diane Selwyn/Betty Elms and Laura Harring plays Camilla Rhodes/Rita and in ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' [[Laura Dern]] plays Nikki Grace/Susan Blue. The numerous alternative versions of lead characters and numerous examples of fragmented timelines may echo and/or reference the [[many worlds interpretation]] of quantum physics and perhaps Lynch's broader interest in quantum physics/ quantum theory.&lt;ref&gt;David Lynch on World Peace From the Quantum Level https://www.tm.org/blog/video/world-peace-from-the-quantum-level-david-lynch-and-john-hagelin/&lt;/ref&gt; Some have also suggested that Lynch's love for the 1958 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', which employs a split lead character (the Judy Barton and Madeleine Elster characters, both portrayed by [[Kim Novak]]) may have had an influence on this aspect of Lynch's work.&lt;ref&gt;David Lynch Attends Vertigo Screening http://cinearchive.org/post/116927300550/david-lynch-watching-vertigo-the-most-studied&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;10 Films Influenced by Vertigo http://www.indiewire.com/2015/04/9-great-films-influenced-by-alfred-hitchcocks-vertigo-62999/&lt;/ref&gt;

He frequently tends to have characters that have supernatural and omnipotent qualities. They can be seen as physical manifestations of various different concepts, such as hatred or fear. Examples of these characters are The Man Inside the Planet from ''Eraserhead'', Bob from ''Twin Peaks'', The Mystery Man from ''Lost Highway'', The Bum in ''Mulholland Drive'', and The Phantom in ''Inland Empire''. Lynch approaches his characters and film content in a way that steeps them in a dream state rather than reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/09/david-lynch-racial-politics.html|title=What Does David Lynch Have to Say About Race?|last=Guan|first=Frank|work=Vulture|access-date=November 15, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recurring collaborators===
{{Main|List of frequent David Lynch collaborators}}
Lynch is also widely noted for his collaborations with various production artists and composers on his films and other productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/my-beautiful-broken-brain-the-amazing-collaboration-of-david-lynch-and-a-woman-who-video-selfied-her-a6937571.html|title=My Beautiful Broken Brain: The woman who 'video-selfied' her stroke|date=March 17, 2016|work=The Independent|access-date=March 26, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently works with [[Angelo Badalamenti]] to compose music for his productions, former wife [[Mary Sweeney]] as a film editor, casting director [[Johanna Ray]], and cast members [[Harry Dean Stanton]], [[Jack Nance]], [[Kyle MacLachlan]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Isabella Rossellini]], [[Grace Zabriskie]], and [[Laura Dern]].

==Other work==

===Painting===
[[File:Lynch's So This is Love painting.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Lynch's painting ''So This Is Love'', 1992]]
Lynch first trained as a painter, and although he is now better known as a filmmaker, he has continued to paint. Lynch has stated that "all my paintings are organic, violent comedies. They have to be violently done and primitive and crude, and to achieve that I try to let [[nature]] paint more than I paint."&lt;ref name="lynch22"&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his works are very dark in colour, and Lynch has said this is because

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wouldn't know what to do with [colour]. Colour to me is too real. It's limiting. It doesn't allow too much of a dream. The more you throw black into a colour, the more dreamy it gets&amp;nbsp;... Black has depth. It's like a little egress; you can go into it, and because it keeps on continuing to be dark, the mind kicks in, and a lot of things that are going on in there become manifest. And you start seeing what you're afraid of. You start seeing what you love, and it becomes like a dream.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of his works also contain letters and words added to the painting. He explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The words in the paintings are sometimes important to make you start thinking about what else is going on in there. And a lot of times, the words excite me as shapes, and something'll grow out of that. I used to cut these little letters out and glue them on. They just look good all lined up like teeth&amp;nbsp;... sometimes they become the title of the painting.&lt;ref name="lynch22"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lynch considers the 20th-century Irish-born British artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] to be his "number one kinda hero painter", stating that "Normally I only like a couple of years of a painter's work, but I like everything of Bacon's. The guy, you know, had the stuff."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch was the subject of a major art retrospective at the [[Fondation Cartier]], Paris from March 3 – May 27, 2007. The show was titled ''The Air is on Fire'' and included numerous paintings, photographs, drawings, alternative films and sound work. New site-specific art [[Installation art|installations]] were created specially for the exhibition. A series of events accompanied the exhibition including live performances and concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6412525.stm | work=BBC News | title=David Lynch's dark arts laid bare | date=March 2, 2007 | accessdate=May 1, 2010 | first=Caroline | last=Wyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[File:David Lynch -microphone -10Aug2007-2p (cropped).jpg|thumb|Lynch in August 2007]]
Lynch has also been involved in a number of music projects, many of them related to his films. His album genres switch mainly between [[experimental rock]], [[ambient music|ambient]] soundscapes and, most recently, avant-garde [[electropop]] music. Most notably he produced and wrote lyrics for [[Julee Cruise]]'s first two albums, ''[[Floating into the Night]]'' (1989) and ''[[The Voice of Love (Julee Cruise album)|The Voice of Love]]'' (1993), in collaboration with [[Angelo Badalamenti]] who composed the music and also produced. Lynch also worked on the 1998 [[Jocelyn Montgomery]] album ''Lux Vivens (Living Light), The Music of Hildegard von Bingen''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allmusic.com/album/lux-vivens-the-music-of-hildegard-von-bingen-mw0000600349 Jocelyn Montgomery &amp; David Lynch - Lux Vevens] Allmusic&lt;/ref&gt; For his own productions, he composed music for ''Wild at Heart'', ''Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me'', ''Mulholland Drive'', and ''Rabbits''. In 2001, he released ''[[BlueBob]]'', a rock album performed by Lynch and John Neff. The album is notable for Lynch's unusual guitar playing style. He plays "upside down and backwards, like a lap guitar", and relies heavily on effects pedals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lynchnet.com/articles/bug.html |title=BOSS Users Group magazine Vol. 5, No. 1 Summer 2001 |publisher=Lynchnet.com |date= |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently Lynch composed several pieces for ''Inland Empire'', including two songs, "Ghost of Love" and "Walkin' on the Sky", in which he makes his public debut as a singer. In 2009, his new book-CD set ''[[Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse Present: Dark Night of the Soul|Dark Night of the Soul]]'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/05/15/danger-mouses-dark-night-of-the-soul-album-threatened-by-lawsuit/|title=Music – New Music News, Reviews, Pictures, and Videos|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he started his own record label called David Lynch MC which first released ''Fox Bat Strategy: A Tribute to Dave Jaurequi'' in early 2009. In August 2009, it was announced that he was releasing Afghani/American singer Ariana Delawari's ''Lion of Panjshir'' album in conjunction with [[Manimal Vinyl]] record company.

In November 2010, Lynch released two [[electropop]] music singles, "Good Day Today" and "I Know", through the independent British label [[Sunday Best (music company)|Sunday Best Recordings]]. Describing why he created them, he stated that "I was just sitting and these notes came and then I went down and started working with Dean [Hurley, his engineer] and then these few notes, 'I want to have a good day, today' came and the song was built around that".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Topping | first = Alexandra|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/28/david-lynch-turns-pop-singer-songwriter?intcmp=239 |title=The latest offbeat experiment from filmmaker David Lynch: pop singles |publisher=The Guardian |date=November 28, 2010 | accessdate=November 30, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singles were followed by an album, ''[[Crazy Clown Time]]'', which was released in November 2011 and described as an "electronic blues album".&lt;ref name="clowntime"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/arts/music/david-lynchs-album-crazy-clown-time.html | title=Music, Not Movies, But Still Exploring Places of Darkness | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 11, 2011 |accessdate=January 30, 2012 | first=David | last=Lynch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The songs were sung by Lynch, with guest vocals on one track by [[Karen O]] of the [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15999-david-lynch-crazy-clown-time/ | last=Powell | first=Mike | title=Crazy Clown Time | publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=November 8, 2011 | accessdate=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and composed and performed by Lynch and Dean Hurley.&lt;ref name="clowntime"/&gt; All or most of the songs for ''Crazy Clown Time'' were put into art-music videos, Lynch directing the title song's video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caWXt9lCVrc|title=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdDGFZhoVT0|title=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IugOfDBWcGc|title=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cph9o8faQUo|title=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Crazy Clown Time'' song and video are a fantastic minimalistic parody of hip-hop music and videos.

On September 29, 2011, Lynch released ''This Train'' with vocalist and long-time musical collaborator [[Chrysta Bell]] on the La Rose Noire label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Battan|first=Carrie|title=David Lynch Unveils Album Cover Art|url=http://www.pitchfork.com/news/43992-david-lynch-unveils-album-cover-art/|publisher=Pitchfork}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 11-song album was produced by Lynch and co-written primarily by Lynch and Chrysta Bell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dombal|first=Ryan|title=David Lynch Talks New Music Projects|url=http://www.pitchfork.com/news/40872-david-lynch-talks-new-music-projects/|publisher=Pitchfork}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the song "Polish Poem" which is featured on the ''Inland Empire'' soundtrack.

For Record Store Day 2014 David Lynch released ''The Big Dream Remix EP'' which featured four songs from his album remixed by various artists. This included the track "Are You Sure" remixed by [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]]. The band Bastille have been known to take inspiration from David Lynch's work for their songs and music videos, the main one being their song "[[Laura Palmer (song)|Laura Palmer]]" which is influenced by Lynch's television show ''Twin Peaks''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nme.com/news/david-lynch/75997|title=David Lynch collaborates with Moby and Bastille for Record Store Day EP – listen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 2018 a collaborative album by Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti, titled ''[[Thought Gang]]'', was released on vinyl and on compact disc. The album was recorded around 1993 but was unreleased at the time. Two tracks from the album already appeared on the soundtrack from the 1992 movie 'Twin Peaks: Fire walk with me' and three other tracks were used for the 'Twin Peaks' TV series in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://pitchfork.com/news/david-lynch-and-angelo-badalamentis-lost-90s-album-is-getting-released/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allmusic.com/album/thought-gang-mw0003211114&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
Lynch designed and constructed furniture for his 1997 film ''Lost Highway'', notably the small table in the Madison house and the VCR case.

In April 1997 he presented a furniture collection at the prestigious [[Milan Furniture Fair]] in Italy. "Design and music, art and architecture – they all belong together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cityofabsurdity.com/furniture.html|title=The City of Absurdity: David Lynch's Furniture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with designer Raphael Navot, architectural agency Enia and light designer Thierry Dreyfus, Lynch has conceived and designed a nightclub in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2011/09/07/silencio-by-david-lynch/|title=Silencio by David Lynch|date=September 7, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Silencio" opened in October 2011, and is a private members' club although is free to the public after midnight.  Patrons have access to concerts, films and other performances by artists and guests. Inspired by the club of the same name in his 2001 film ''Mulholland Drive'', the underground space consists of a series of rooms, each dedicated to a certain purpose or atmosphere. "Silencio is something dear to me. I wanted to create an intimate space where all the arts could come together. There won't be a Warhol-like guru, but it will be open to celebrated artists of all disciplines to come here to programme or create what they want."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/31/david-lynch-disco-paris?fb=native&amp;CMP=FBCNETTXT9038/|title=Inside David Lynch's Paris nightclub|first=Fiachra|last=Gibbons|date=August 31, 2011|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
In 2006, Lynch authored a short book describing his creative processes, stories from throughout his career, and the benefits he had realized through his practice of [[Transcendental Meditation]] called ''[[Catching the Big Fish|Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity]]''. He describes the metaphor behind the title in the introduction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ideas are like fish.

If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you've got to go deeper.

Down deep, the fish are more powerful and more pure. They're huge and abstract. And they're very beautiful.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book weaves a non-linear autobiography with descriptions of Lynch's cognitive experiences during Transcendental Meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynch|first1=David|title=Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity|date=2006|publisher=The Penguin Group|isbn=978-1-58542-540-2|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQqitBgFpOkC|accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All author's royalties will be donated to the [[David Lynch Foundation]].

Together with [[Kristine McKenna]], Lynch, in June 2018, published the book ''Room to Dream''. The book is a hybrid of biography and memoir. The book gives the reader a look into his personal and creative life through his own words and through those of his colleagues, family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/room-to-dream/|title=Book Marks reviews of Room to Dream by David Lynch and Kristine McKenna|website=bookmarks.reviews|language=en-US|access-date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
Lynch has had several long-term relationships. In 1967, he married Peggy Lentz in Chicago, [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peggyreavey.com/|title=Peggy Reavey|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had one child, [[Jennifer Chambers Lynch]], born in 1968, who is a film director. They filed for divorce in 1974. On June 21, 1977, Lynch married Mary Fisk, and the couple had one child, Austin Jack Lynch, born in 1982. They divorced in 1987, and Lynch later developed a relationship with [[Mary Sweeney]], with whom he had one son. Sweeney also worked as Lynch's longtime film editor/producer and co-wrote and produced ''[[The Straight Story]]''. The two married in May 2006, but divorced that July. In 2009 Lynch married actress Emily Stofle, who appeared in his 2006 film ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' as well as the [[Twin Peaks: The Return|2017 revival of ''Twin Peaks'']]. The couple have one child, Lula Boginia Lynch, born in 2012.

===Political views===
Lynch has said that he is "not a political person" and that politics is "something [he] know[s] little about."&lt;ref name=int/&gt; However, in the 1990s he expressed admiration for former US President [[Ronald Reagan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last =Willow | first =Hank | url=http://www.hollywoodinvestigator.com/lynch.htm |title=Twin Peaks Director David Lynch – Admires Reagan, Natural Law Party |publisher=hollywoodinvestigator |date= November 19, 2001| accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "I mostly liked that he carried a wind of old Hollywood, of a cowboy."&lt;ref name=int&gt;{{cite web |last =Barney | first =Richard | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZGk0J0HgmcsC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20lynch%20ronald%20reagan |title=David Lynch - Interviews |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |date= November 19, 2009| accessdate=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing his political philosophy in 2006, he stated, "at that time, I thought of myself as a [[libertarianism|libertarian]]. I believed in next to zero government. And I still would lean toward no government and not so many rules, except for traffic lights and things like this. I really believe in traffic regulations."&lt;ref name=reason&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/blog/2006/12/11/was-david-lynch-the-original-l|title=Was David Lynch the Original Libertarian Democrat?|date=December 11, 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch continued to state that "I'm a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] now. And I've always been a Democrat, really. But I don't like the Democrats a lot, either, because I'm a smoker, and I think a lot of the Democrats have come up with these rules for non-smoking."&lt;ref name=reason/&gt; He endorsed the [[centre-left politics|center-left]] [[Natural Law Party (United States)|Natural Law Party]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dTCkwmvEyIC |title=David Lynch: Interviews |first=Richard A. |last=Barney |year=2009 |publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|isbn=978-1-60473-236-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later stated that he would vote for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=David | last=Lynch | url = http://90days90reasons.com/52.php | title=Reason 52: I Have Noticed Something in Mitt Romney's name. | work=90 Days, 90 Reasons | accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2016 United States presidential election]], he endorsed [[Bernie Sanders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=DAVID_LYNCH |author=David Lynch |date=March 29, 2016 |title=Dear Twtter Friends, YAY!

Lynch was working for the building and establishment of seven buildings, in which 8,000 salaried people would practice advanced meditation techniques, "pumping peace for the world". He estimates the cost at US$7 [[1,000,000,000|billion]]. As of December 2005, he had spent US$400,000 of personal money, and raised US$1 million in donations.&lt;ref name="WP-12-01-2005" /&gt; In December 2006, the ''New York Times'' reported that he continued to have that goal.&lt;ref name="NYT-12-31-06" /&gt; Lynch's book, ''[[Catching the Big Fish]]'' (Tarcher/Penguin 2006), discusses the impact of the Transcendental Meditation technique on his creative process.

===Website===
Lynch designed his personal website, a site exclusive to paying members, where he posts short videos and his [[absurdism|absurdist]] series ''[[Dumbland]]'', plus interviews and other items. The site also featured a daily [[Weather forecasting|weather report]], where Lynch gives a brief description of the weather in Los Angeles, where he resides. Until June 2010, this weather report (usually no longer than 30&amp;nbsp;seconds) was also being broadcast on his personal [[YouTube]] channel, ''David Lynch – Daily Weather Report''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/remember_when_david_lynch_used|title=Remember when David Lynch used to do weather reports on the Internet?|date=August 25, 2016|work=dangerousminds.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/reminder-david-lynch-used-to-do-kooky-weather-reports.html|title=Here’s a Friendly Reminder That David Lynch Used to Do Kooky Weather Reports|last=Ivie|first=Devon|work=Vulture|access-date=August 18, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; An absurd [[ringtone]] ("I like to kill deer") from the website was a common [[sound bite]] on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' in early 2006.

Lynch is a coffee drinker and even has his own line of special organic blends available for purchase on his website as well as in [[Whole Foods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://media.wholefoodsmarket.com/news/whole-foods-market-and-filmmaker-david-lynch-pour-new-signature-coffee-line |title=Whole Foods Market® and Filmmaker David Lynch Pour New Signature Coffee Line |location=Los Angeles, CA |date=August 20, 2013 |website=Newsroom |publisher=Whole Foods Market |accessdate=August 22, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713065818/http://media.wholefoodsmarket.com/news/whole-foods-market-and-filmmaker-david-lynch-pour-new-signature-coffee-line |archivedate=July 13, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/xy73bq/david-lynchs-philosophy-on-drinking-coffee|title=David Lynch's Philosophy on Drinking Coffee|website=Munchies|language=fr|access-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Called "David Lynch Signature Cup", the coffee has been advertised via flyers included with several recent Lynch-related DVD releases, including ''Inland Empire'' and the Gold Box edition of ''Twin Peaks''. The possibly self-mocking tag-line for the brand is "It's all in the beans&amp;nbsp;... and I'm just full of beans."&lt;ref&gt;David Lynch Signature Cup flyer, included with the ''Twin Peaks'' Definitive Gold Box Edition DVD set, October 2007, the digitally remastered ''[[Eraserhead]]'' DVD in 2006, and in other Lynch DVD releases in 2005–2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also a quote of a line said by [[Justin Theroux]]'s character in ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]''.

'''''Farewell to Orpheus''''' is an outdoor 1968–1973 [[bronze sculpture]] and fountain by [[Frederic Littman]], installed at the [[Portland State University]] campus in [[Portland, Oregon]], United States.

==Description and history==
[[File:Farewell to Orpheus plaque, 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Plaque for the sculpture]]

''Farewell to Orpheus'', created by former [[Portland State University]] (PSU) art professor [[Frederic Littman]] in 1968,&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web|title=Farewell to Orpheus, (sculpture).|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!368903~!0#focus|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LaDu&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pdx.edu/facilities/sites/www.pdx.edu.facilities/files/POSTED%20Article%20Littman%20Fountain.pdf |title=Littman Sculpture and Fountain in the Park Blocks |format=PDF |first=John |last=LaDu |publisher=[[Portland State University]] |accessdate=April 1, 2015 |df= }}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; is located at Southwest Montgomery Street in the [[South Park Blocks]].&lt;ref name=SPB&gt;{{cite web|title=South Park Blocks|url=http://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/finder/index.cfm?&amp;propertyid=674&amp;action=ViewPark|publisher=[[Portland Parks &amp; Recreation]]|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Sybilla Avery|title=Walking Portland|year=1998|publisher=[[Globe Pequot Press]]|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oh_dA76n37gC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts [[Eurydice]] and was installed in 1972–1973 as part of the South Park Blocks Urban Renewal Development Project.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;&lt;ref name=LaDu/&gt;&lt;ref name=SPB/&gt; The fountain is one of four maintained by PSU, along with ''Walk of Heroines'' at Hoffman Hall, another in front of the Student Health and Counseling Building, and one at Urban Plaza.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hannan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hannan|first1=Jor|title=Are fountains folly?|url=http://psuvanguard.com/uncategorized/are-fountains-folly/|accessdate=April 1, 2015|work=[[Daily Vanguard]]|publisher=Portland State University|date=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture has always been surrounded by water but the fountain, which continually recycles 227 gallons of water, was not added until the 1990s. In 2009, PSU partnered with the City of Portland and the sculpture's owners to repair the fountain, which had not worked for nearly a decade. Repairs cost $6,000 and were funded in part by rentals on the South Park Blocks. Work included installation of new fountain heads, lights, and wiring, and re-sealing underwater surfaces. The repairs were completed by three PSU employees.&lt;ref name=LaDu/&gt; ''Farewell to Orpheus'' has been described as a "seating refuge" for students and included in published walking tours of the city.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMGS&gt;{{cite web|title=The Southwest Montgomery Green Street: Connecting the West Hills with the Willamette River|url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bes/article/313935|accessdate=April 1, 2015|date=October 2009|pages=8, 24–25|publisher=City of Portland, Oregon|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Sybilla Avery|title=Walking Portland, Oregon|date=April 2, 2013|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wvPWSWqzCT0C&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Buddhism]], '''fierce deities''' are the fierce, wrathful or forceful (Tibetan: ''trowo'', Sanskrit: ''krodha'') forms of enlightened [[Buddha]]s, [[Bodhisattva]]s or [[Deva (Buddhism)|Devas]] (divine beings). Because of their power to destroy the obstacles to enlightenment, they are also termed ''krodha-vighnantaka'', "fierce destroyers of obstacles".&lt;ref&gt;Linrothe, Rob. Ruthless Compassion, 1999, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Fierce deities are a notable feature of the iconography of [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]]. These types of deities first appeared in India during the late 6th century with its main source being the [[Yaksha]] imagery and became a central feature of Indian [[Tantric Buddhism]] by the late 10th or early 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Linrothe, Rob. Ruthless Compassion, 1999, page x, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Image:Vajrayogini from Thangka.jpg|thumb|[[Vajrayogini]], a semi-wrathful [[dakini]] who is also known as ''[[Sarva|sarvabuddha]]ḍākiṇī'', the all-buddha Dakini.]]
In non-Tantric traditions of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, these beings are protector deities who destroy obstacles to the Buddhas and the Dharma, act as guardians against demons and gather together sentient beings to listen to the teachings of the Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;Linrothe, Rob. Ruthless Compassion, 1999, page 13, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tantric Buddhism]], they are considered to be fierce and terrifying forms of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas themselves. Enlightened beings may take on these forms in order to protect and aid confused sentient beings.&lt;ref&gt;Thurman, Robert. The Tibetan Book of the Dead: Liberation Through Understanding in the Between, page 149.&lt;/ref&gt; They also represent the energy and power that is needed in order to transform negative mental factors into wisdom and compassion.&lt;ref&gt;Berzin, Alexander; Making Sense of Tantra, https://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/vajrayana/tantra-theory/making-sense-of-tantra/tantric-imagery#peaceful-and-forceful-figures&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linrothe, Rob. Ruthless Compassion, 1999, page xi.&lt;/ref&gt; They represent the power and compassion of enlightened activity which uses multiple skillful means ([[upaya]]) to guide sentient beings as well as the transformative element of tantra which uses negative emotions as part of the path. According to [[Chogyam Trungpa]], "wrathful yidams work more directly and forcefully with passion, aggression, and delusion - conquering and trampling them on the spot."&lt;ref&gt;Chögyam Trungpa. The Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa: Volume 3, Shambala, 2003, page 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tantric Buddhist art, fierce deities are presented as terrifying, demonic looking beings adorned with human skulls and other ornaments associated with the charnel ground, as well as being often depicted with sexually suggestive attributes. According to Rob Linrothe, the sensual and fierce imagery represents "poison as its own antidote, harnessed obstacles as the liberating force" and notes that they are "metaphors for the internal yogic processes to gain enlightenment".&lt;ref&gt;Linrothe, Rob. Ruthless Compassion, 1999, page xi-xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tantric Deities==
===Yidams===
In Indo-Tibetan [[Vajrayana]], [[Yidam]]s are divine forms of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The tantric practitioner is initiated into the mandala of a particular chosen deity (Sanskrit: ''Iṣṭa-devatā'') and practices complex [[sadhana]]s (meditations) on the deity for the purpose of personal transformation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Buswell Jr.|Buswell, Robert E.]]; [[Donald S. Lopez, Jr.|Lopez, Donald S.]] (2013). ''The Princeton dictionary of Buddhism''. Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-691-15786-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Deity Yoga]] practice is central to tantric forms of Buddhism such as [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Yidams can be peaceful, fierce and "semi-fierce" (having both fierce and peaceful aspects). Fierce deities can be divided into male and female categories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khandro.net/deities_wrathful.htm Wrathful Deities]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Heruka]]s ([[Standard Tibetan|Tb]]. ''khrag 'thung'', lit. "blood drinker") are enlightened masculine beings who adopt fierce forms to express their detachment from the world of ignorance, such as [[Yamantaka]], [[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra|Cakrasamvara]], [[Mahākāla]], or [[Kīla (Buddhism)|Vajrakilaya]]. [[Dakini]]s ([[Standard Tibetan|Tb]]. ''khandroma'', "sky-goer") are their feminine counterparts, sometimes depicted with a heruka and sometimes as independent deities. The most prevalent wrathful [[dakini]]s are [[Vajrayogini]] and [[Vajravārāhī]].

===Wisdom Kings===
In [[East Asian Buddhism]], [[Wisdom King]]s ([[Sanskrit]] ''vidyarāja''), are seen as divine manifestations of the Buddhas, who act as protectors, messengers and defenders of the Buddhist Dharma.&lt;ref&gt;Baroni, Helen Josephine (2002). ''The illustrated encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism''. New York: Rosen Pub. Group. p. 100. {{ISBN|0-8239-2240-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In East Asian [[Vajrayana]] and [[Chinese Esoteric Buddhism]] the five wisdom kings are manifestations of the [[Five Tathagatas]].

==The Protectors==
The Protectors ([[Sanskrit]] ''pāla'') or [[Dharmapala|Dharmapāla]] (Dharma protectors), are powerful beings, often [[Deva (Buddhism)|Devas]] or [[Bodhisattva]]s who protect the Buddhist religion and community from inner and outer threats and obstacles to their practice.&lt;ref&gt;''Heart Jewel'': The Essential Practices of Kadampa Buddhism, pages 71-3, Tharpa Publications (2nd. ed., 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-56-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Dharmapala can also be a [[Garuda]], [[Nāga]], [[Yaksha]], [[Gandharva]], or [[Asura]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Buswell Jr.; Donald S. Lopez Jr. (2013). [https://books.google.com/books?id=DXN2AAAAQBAJ ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism'']. Princeton University Press. pp. 249–250. {{ISBN|978-1-4008-4805-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other categories of Protectors include the [[Four Heavenly Kings|Lokapālas]] or "Four Heavenly Kings" and [[Kshetrapala|{{IAST|Kṣetrapālas}}]] or "Protectors of the Region".

===Eight Dharmapalas===

A common Tibetan grouping of Dharmapāla is 'The Eight [[Dharmapala]]s' ({{bo|t=དྲག་གཤེད|w=drag gshed}}), who are understood to be the defenders of [[Buddhism]]. They are [[supernatural]] beings with the rank of [[bodhisattva]] who "are supposed to wage war without any mercy against the demons and enemies of Buddhism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/wrathful.htm|title=Wrathful Guardians of Buddhism - Aesthetics and Mythology|date=February 2001|accessdate=2008-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eight Dharmapala are:&lt;ref&gt;Pearlman, Ellen.

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], the '''genius''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡɛn.jʊs|lang}}; plural ''geniī'') is the individual instance of a general divine nature that is present in every individual person, place, or thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=genius|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2319459|encyclopedia=A Latin Dictionary|first=Charlton T. |last=Lewis|first2=Charles |last2=Short|publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University|location=Meford, MA|year=2009|accessdate=1 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much like a [[guardian angel]], the genius would follow each man from the hour of his birth until the day he died.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Dwight [https://books.google.com/books?id=S4XRAAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;ots=yrthUV5Xc2&amp;dq=genius%20roman%20mythology&amp;pg=PA253#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Grecian and Roman Mythology'' p.253]&lt;/ref&gt; For women, it was the ''Juno'' spirit that would accompany each of them.

==Nature of the ''genius''==
Each individual place had a ''genius'' (''[[genius loci]]'') and so did powerful objects, such as volcanoes. The concept extended to some specifics: the genius of the theatre, of vineyards, and of festivals, which made performances successful, grapes grow, and celebrations succeed, respectively. It was extremely important in the Roman mind to propitiate the appropriate genii for the major undertakings and events of their lives.

The Christian theologian [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] equated the Christian "[[soul]]" with the Roman ''genius'', citing [[Varro]] as attributing the rational powers and abilities of every human being to their ''genius''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=St. Augustine|editor-first=R.W|editor-last=Dyson|title=The City of God against the Pagans|page=284|chapter=VII.13|quote=Varro says that a 'genius' is the rational soul of each man ... and that the soul of the world itself is a universal 'genius', and that this is what they call Jupiter.|isbn=0-14-044894-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific genii==
[[File:Genio romano de Ponte Puñide (M.A.N. 1928-60-1) 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze genius depicted as ''[[pater familias]]'' (1st century CE)]]
Although the term ''genius'' might apply to any divinity whatsoever, most of the higher-level and state ''genii'' had their own well-established names. ''Genius'' applied most often to individual places or people not generally known; that is, to the smallest units of society and settlements, families and their homes. Houses, doors, gates, streets, districts, tribes, each one had its own ''genius''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Rome: Gods by Conquest|first=P.|last=Grimal|encyclopedia=Larousse World Mythology|year=1965|publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supreme hierarchy of the Roman gods, like that of the Greeks, was modelled after a human family. It featured a father, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], who was also the supreme divine unity, and a mother, ''[[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]'', queen of the gods. These supreme unities were subdivided into ''genii'' for each individual family; hence, the ''genius'' of each female, representing the female domestic reproductive power, was a Juno. The male function was a Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=291|title=The Mythology of All Races|editor-first=Louis Herbert|editor-last=Gray|editor2-first=George Foot|editor2-last=Moore|volume=I Greek and Roman|first=William Sherwood|last=Fox|publisher=Marshall Jones Company|year=1916|location=Boston|isbn=0-8154-0073-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The juno was worshipped under many titles:
*''Iugalis'', "of marriage"
*''Matronalis'', "of married women"
*''Pronuba'', "of brides"
*''Virginalis'', "of virginity"

''Genii'' were often viewed as protective spirits, as one would propitiate them for protection. For example, to protect infants one propitiated a number of [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|deities concerned with birth and childrearing]]: ''Cuba'' ("lying down to sleep"), ''Cunina'' ("of the cradle") and ''Rumina'' ("of breast-feeding").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Cuba |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0909.html |first=Leonhard |last=Schmitz |encyclopedia=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology |editor-first=William |editor-last=Smith |volume=1 |page=900 |date=2005|orig-year=1867 |publisher=Little, Brown &amp; Company, The Ancient Library |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514090503/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0909.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, if those ''genii'' did not perform their proper function well, the infant would be in danger.

Hundreds of ''lararia'', or family shrines, have been discovered at [[Pompeii]], typically off the ''[[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]'', kitchen or garden, where the smoke of burnt offerings could vent through the opening in the roof. A ''lararium'' was distinct from the ''penus'' ("within"), another shrine where the [[penates]], gods associated with the storerooms, was located. Each ''lararium'' features a panel fresco containing the same theme: two peripheral figures (''[[Lares]]'') attend on a central figure (family ''genius'') or two figures (''genius'' and ''Juno'') who may or may not be at an altar. In the foreground is one or two serpents crawling toward the ''genius'' through a meadow motif. [[Campania]] and [[Calabria]] preserved an ancient practice of keeping a propitious house snake, here linked with the ''genius''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=David Gerald|last=Orr|title=Roman Domestic Religion: The Archaeology of Roman Popular Art|editor-first=Ray Broadus|editor-last=Browne|work=Rituals and Ceremonies in Popular Culture|location=Bowling Green, Ohio|publisher=Bowling Green University Popular Press|year=1980|pages=88–103|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another, unrelated fresco ([[House of the Centenary]]) the snake-in-meadow appears below a depiction of [[Mount Vesuvius]] and is labelled ''Agathodaimon'', "good [[daimon]]", where ''daimon'' must be regarded as the Greek equivalent of ''genius''.

==History of the concept==

===Origin===
[[File:Vindobona Hoher Markt-92.JPG|thumb|upright|Head of a genius worshipped by Roman soldiers (found at [[Vindobona]], 2nd century CE)]]
Etymologically ''[[wikt:en:genius#Latin|genius]]'' (“household guardian spirit”) has the same derivation as ''nature'' from ''[[wikt:en:gens#Latin|gēns]]'' (“tribe”, “people”) from the [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root *gen-, "produce."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Genius|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=g&amp;p=3|encyclopedia=Online Etymological Dictionary|accessdate=2 July 2009|year=2001|first=Douglas|last=Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''genius'' appears explicitly in Roman literature as early as [[Plautus]], where one character in the play, ''[[Captivi]]'', jests that the father of another is so avaricious that he uses cheap Samian ware in sacrifices to his own ''genius'', so as not to tempt the ''genius'' to steal it.&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Captivi'' 2.2.&lt;/ref&gt; In this passage, the ''genius'' is not identical to the person, as to propitiate oneself would be absurd, and yet the ''genius'' also has the avarice of the person; that is, the same character, the implication being, like person, like ''genius''.

[[Horace]], writing when the first emperor was introducing the cult of his own ''genius'', describes the genius as "the companion which controls the natal star; the god of human nature, in that he is mortal for each person, with a changing expression, white or black".&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Epistles'', II, 2, 187-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial genii===
[[File:Genius Domitian Musei Capitolini MC1130.jpg|thumb|upright|Genius of [[Domitian]]]]
[[Octavius Caesar]] on return to Rome after the final victory of the [[Roman Civil War]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] appeared to the Senate to be a man of great power and success, clearly a mark of divinity. In recognition of the prodigy they voted that all banquets should include a libation to his ''genius''. In concession to this sentiment he chose the name [[Augustus]], capturing the numinous meaning of English "august." The household cult of the ''Genius Augusti'' dates from this period. It was propitiated at every meal along with the other household ''numina''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishwick|first=Duncan|title=The imperial cult in the Latin West: studies in the ruler cult of the western provinces of the Roman Empire|publisher=E.J. Brill|location=Leiden ; New York |date=1987–2005|volume=2 Part 1|pages=375–377|isbn=90-04-07179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus began the tradition of the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], in which Romans worshipped the genius of the emperor rather than the person.

[[File:GenioLVIIGEM.jpg|thumb|left|Inscription on votive altar to the ''genius'' of [[Legio VII Gemina]] by L. Attius Macro ([[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]] II 5083)]]
If the ''[[genius]]'' of the ''[[imperator]]'', or commander of all troops, was to be propitiated, so was that of all the units under his command. The provincial troops expanded the idea of the ''genii'' of state; for example, from Roman Britain have been found altars to the ''genii'' of ''Roma'', ''Roma aeterna'', ''Britannia'', and to every ''[[Roman legion|legion]]'', ''[[Cohort (military unit)|cohors]]'', ''[[Ala (Roman military)|ala]]'' and ''[[centuria]]'' in Britain, as well as to the ''[[praetorium]]'' of every ''[[castra]]'' and even to the ''[[Vexillatio|vexillae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roman Era in Britain|first=John |last=Ward|publisher=Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd.; LacusCurtius, University of Chicago|location=London, Chicago|origyear=1911|year=2003|chapter=Chapter VI Religions of Roman Britain|chapter-url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Great_Britain/_Periods/Roman/_Texts/WARREB/6*.html|pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptional dedications to ''genius'' were not confined to the military. From [[Gallia Cisalpina]] under the empire are numerous dedications to the ''genii'' of persons of authority and respect; in addition to the emperor's ''genius principis'', were the geniuses of patrons of freedmen, owners of slaves, patrons of guilds, philanthropists, officials, villages, other divinities, relatives and friends. Sometimes the dedication is combined with other words, such as "to the genius and honor" or in the case of couples, "to the genius and Juno."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=19–24|title=The cults of Cisalpine Gaul as seen in the inscriptions|first=Joseph Clyde |last=Murley|publisher=George Banta Publishing Company|location=Menasha Wisconsin|year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving from the time of the empire hundreds of dedicatory, votive and sepulchral inscriptions ranging over the entire territory testify to a floruit of ''genius'' worship as an official cult. Stock phrases were abbreviated: GPR, ''genio populi Romani'' ("to the genius of the Roman people"); GHL, ''genio huius loci'' ("to the genius of this place"); GDN, ''genio domini nostri'' ("to the genius of our master"), and so on. In 392 AD with the final victory of Christianity [[Theodosius I]] declared the worship of the Genii, [[Lares]] and [[Penates]] to be treason, ending their official terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=165|title=History of Rome and the Roman people|first=Victor |last=Duruy|editor-first=John Pentland |editor-last=Mahaffy|volume=IV|publisher=Dana Estes &amp; Charles E. Lauriat|location=Boston|year=1885|isbn=1-4325-5089-6}} The authors cite [[Codex Theodosianus]] XVI.x.xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept, however, continued in representation and speech under different names or with accepted modifications.

'''Gond-i Shahanshah''' ("the army of the [[Shah]]anshah"), also known by its Arabicized form of '''Jund-i Shahanshah''', was the name of the 4,000 [[Daylamites|Daylamite]] elite unit of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king. They originally lived in [[Daylam]], but were resettled in [[Ctesiphon]] by [[Khosrow II]] (r. 590-628), probably some time after 600. After the Sasanian Empire suffered a major defeat in 636 to the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arabs]] at the [[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah|battle of al-Qadisiyyah]], the Gond-i Shahanshah defected to the Arabs, converted to [[Islam]], and settled in [[Kufa]], where they had their own quarter.

The song's stance on drugs garnered differing interpretations; some critics felt it glamorized drug use, while others saw it as anti-drug. Its music video was directed by [[Paul Hunter (director)|Paul Hunter]], and features an [[Androgyny|androgynous]] Manson attached to a [[Christian cross|cross]] made of television sets and a series of vignettes. Critics praised the video's imagery and found it critical of both [[capitalism]] and the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. Commercially, the single peaked within the top 40 of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} [[Alternative Songs]] and [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] charts, as well as the [[Record chart|national charts]] of New Zealand and Spain.

==Background==
[[File:Janes Addiction @ Steel Blue Oval (1 3 2010) (4416155129).jpg|left|thumb|.8px|upright|[[Dave Navarro]] played the [[guitar solo]] on the track.]]
After the release of ''[[Antichrist Superstar]]'' (1996), an album which sparked controversy among [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]], Marilyn Manson didn't want to resume playing the role of a [[bogeyman]]. He feared that this would cause him to be "consigned to the one-note rock theatricality" of [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and [[Alice Cooper]].&lt;ref name=la1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/mar/12/entertainment/ca-16387 | last=Boehm | first=Mike | title='Mechanical' Reaction | publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | date=March 12, 1999 | accessdate=December 17, 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406002923/http://articles.latimes.com/1999/mar/12/entertainment/ca-16387 | archivedate=April 6, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He desired to convince casual [[Rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]] fans who had previously dismissed him that he was "more than a cartoon". For his next album, ''[[Mechanical Animals]]'' (1998), he took inspiration from the [[glam rock]] music that [[David Bowie]] made in the 1970s, and adopted a wardrobe and hairstyle similar to Bowie's.&lt;ref name=la2&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/16/entertainment/ca-13559 | last=Hochman | first=Steve | title=Marilyn Manson Aims to Change Tide of the Mainstream | publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | date=August 16, 1998 | accessdate=December 17, 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518010014/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/16/entertainment/ca-13559 | archivedate=May 18, 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The album featured numerous references to drugs, some of them positive. Manson told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 1998 that "I advocate the use of drugs, but have always looked down on the abuse of drugs. The people who misuse them give the rest of us a bad name, and I'm not only talking about street drugs. There are a lot of references in the album to the prescripted lifestyle that a lot people have followed and numbed out their emotions and become mechanical."&lt;ref name=la2/&gt; According to Manson, "I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)" was inspired by literal drugs as well as [[television]] and [[religion]], both of which Manson deemed "metaphorical" drugs. Manson described it as "the most hollow anthem on the record".&lt;ref name=book/&gt; 

He recruited [[Dave Navarro]] of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and [[Jane's Addiction]] to play the [[guitar solo]] at the end of the track, and a trio of black [[Gospel music|gospel]] singers to sing the song's refrain. Navarro was rumored to be struggling with drug addiction at the time; Manson refused to confirm whether this was true or not.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite web|last=Weiner|first=Chuck|title=Marilyn Manson: 'Talking'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2j5ZszZ53k4C&amp;pg=PT39&amp;lpg=PT39&amp;dq=i+don%27t+like+the+drugs+the+drugs+like+me+jane%27s+addiction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hVy_Fbt63a&amp;sig=eRVGQZ_EtzLs1rxzVkRhkKgZtd4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrntmB3JLYAhWNxIMKHXWQCkkQ6AEIVzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Omnibus Press|date=2011|accessdate=December 10, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222014619/https://books.google.com/books?id=2j5ZszZ53k4C&amp;pg=PT39&amp;lpg=PT39&amp;dq=i+don%27t+like+the+drugs+the+drugs+like+me+jane%27s+addiction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hVy_Fbt63a&amp;sig=eRVGQZ_EtzLs1rxzVkRhkKgZtd4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrntmB3JLYAhWNxIMKHXWQCkkQ6AEIVzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=December 22, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Navarro recorded the guitar solo, he was shirtless. During a session with Manson, Navarro and the gospel singers, 1970s [[teen idol]] [[Leif Garrett]] unexpectedly entered the room. Manson deemed this session "one of the more memorable moments in rock'n'roll history" and compared it to a work of [[pop art]]. Manson said "What took place after [Garrett arrived] can't be said; the music can only make you feel it."&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

===Reception and analysis===
In ''Against and Beyond: Subversion and Transgression in Mass Media, Popular Culture and Performance'', Emilia Borowska writes that "In [the video's] nightmarish vision, the individuals fall prey to the homogenized, banalised and stupefying culture of contemporary [[capitalism]]."&lt;ref name=monroe/&gt; Borowska also said that the clip depicts "the media and Christianity as sources of repression, control, and imprisonment."&lt;ref name=monroe/&gt; Chris Ford of ''[[Noisecreep]]'' ranked the video for "I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)" fourth on his list of the ten best Marilyn Manson videos, saying that it's "full to the brim with strange, sometimes confusing visuals". Ford said that the video's aesthetic was suitable for a glam rock song.&lt;ref name=noisecreep/&gt; [[AXS TV]]'s Nicole Cormier felt that the video was critical of the [[pharmaceutical industry]], and praised the video for making "morbidity look beautiful", adding: "Although [it's] less dark than previous [Marilyn Manson] videos, the deep message and interpretive expression makes this one just as captivating."&lt;ref name=axs&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.axs.com/5-videos-where-marilyn-manson-makes-morbidity-look-beautiful-78635|last=Cormier|first=Nicole|title=5 videos where Marilyn Manson makes morbidity look beautiful|publisher=[[AXS TV]]|date=March 4, 2016|accessdate=December 19, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618001901/https://www.axs.com/5-videos-where-marilyn-manson-makes-morbidity-look-beautiful-78635|archivedate=June 18, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for Bloody Disgusting, Jonathan Barkan commended the clip's "rather fascinating" visuals but said that its use of color makes it "difficult...to watch without getting a headache."&lt;ref name=headache/&gt;

The '''Inner Tantras''' are the final three divisions in the [[Yana_%28Buddhism%29#Nine_y.C4.81nas|ninefold division]] of practice according to the [[Nyingma]] school of Tibetan Buddhism. They comprise the Mahayoga, Anuyoga and Atiyoga.  This system divides the whole of the Buddhist path into three divisions of three and is in contrast to the division of the Sarma, or New Translation schools (Gelug, Kagyu and Sakya) which use a fourfold division.  The three divisions of the Inner Tantra correspond roughly to the highest category of tantras of the New Translation schools, there known as [[Highest Yoga Tantra|Anuttarayoga Tantra]].

The three divisions of the Inner Tantras are:
*[[Mahayoga]]
*[[Anuyoga]]
*[[Atiyoga]] also known as [[Dzogchen]] or the Great Perfection.

Other schools call them "Father Tantras" (Wyl. pha rgyud), "Mother Tantras" (Wyl. ma rgyud) and "Non-Dual Tantras" (Wyl. gnyis med kyi rgyud)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yoniversum.nl/dakini/tantib789.html Inner Tantras, Higher Tantras Tib., nang rgyud ] The Yoniverse&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among other factors, the three divisions differ in terms of the emphasis they place on the [[generation stage]] and [[completion stage]] of tantric practice.  The Mahayoga emphasizes the generation stage, Anuyoga the completion stage and Atiyoga the synthesis and transcendence of both.

As well as being differentiated in terms of emphasis in practice, the three categories of Inner Tantra are also textual categories, with lists of texts assigned to each category; for which see the individual articles for each section.

{{Fiqh |hygiene}}

'''Islamic toilet etiquette''' describes the rules that the [[Islam]]ic faith has regarding personal [[hygiene]] when going to the [[toilet]]. This code of [[Muslim hygienical jurisprudence]] is known as ''Qadaa' al-Haajah''. 

The only issue which the [[Qur'an]] mentions is the one of washing one's hands ([[s:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/5. The Food#5:6|verse 5:6]]). Issues of [[chirality]] (bodily symmetry), such as whether one uses the left or right hand, and which foot is used to step into or out of toilet areas, are derived from [[hadith]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xRqDv90bAqsC |year=1992 |title=The Tao of Islam |isbn=978-0-7914-0913-8 |author=Sachiko Murata |chapter=ch. 3 The Two Hands of God}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==

A Muslim must first find an acceptable place away from standing water, people's pathways, or shade.&lt;ref&gt;Narrated by Abu Hurairah and collected in Sahih Muslim (Book 002, Number 0516&lt;/ref&gt; They are advised that it is better to enter the area with the left foot,&lt;ref name="maalik"&gt;Narrated by Anas bin Malik and collected in Sahih al-Bukhari (Volume 1, Book 4, Number 144) and Sahih Muslim (Book 003, Number 729)&lt;/ref&gt; facing away from the [[Qiblah]] (prayer point).&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;

While on the toilet, one must remain silent. Talking, answering greetings, or greeting others is strongly discouraged.&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;  When defecating together, two men cannot converse, nor look at each other's genitals.&lt;ref&gt;Sunaan ibn Majah, 1.342&lt;/ref&gt; A man should not touch his genitals with the right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Sunaan Abu Dawud, 1.1.0031&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mishkat, 1.185"&gt;Mishkat, 1.185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mishkat, 1.183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sunaan Nasai, 1.24, 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim, 2.0512&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 1.4.156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Whenever anyone of you drinks water, he should not breathe in the drinking utensil, and whenever anyone of you goes to a lavatory, he is advised better to neither touch his penis nor clean his private parts with his right hand." (Sahih Bukhari, 1. 4.155)[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/004.sbt.html#001.004.155] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525070903/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/004.sbt.html|date=2011-05-25}}[http://www.holyebooks.org/islam/hadith_of_bukhari/004.sbt.html#001.004.155]&lt;/ref&gt; Eating any food while on the toilet is strictly forbidden.&lt;ref name="MSA"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.msawest.com/islam/fundamentals/pillars/prayer/prescribed/pp1_2.html |publisher=MSA West Compendium of Muslim Texts |last=Shu'aib |first=Tajuddin B. |work=The Prescribed Prayer Made Simple |title=Qadaahul Haajah (Relieving Oneself) |accessdate=2009-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090819060534/http://www.msawest.com/islam/fundamentals/pillars/prayer/prescribed/pp1_2.html |archivedate=2009-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[anal cleansing|anus must be washed with water]] after [[defecating]]. Similarly, the [[penis]] and [[vulva]] must be washed with water after urinating. This washing is known as ''[[istinja]]''. The Qur'an suggests that one should wash one's hands as well, which is discussed in [[s:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/5. The Food#5:6|verse 5:6]].

When leaving the toilet, one is advised to leave with the right foot,&lt;ref name="maalik"/&gt; and also say a prayer – "Praise be to Allah who relieved me of the filth and gave me relief."&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt; It is also reported in the hadith of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] that whenever Muhammad went to the toilet, he said "In the name of [[Allah]], O Allah! I seek refuge with You from all offensive and wicked things" (alternate translation: "from evil deeds and evil spirits").&lt;ref&gt;Hadith of Bukhari: Volumes I, II, III &amp; IV. 1944. P.39. Hadith 1:144.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6425">'''Jean-Michel Frank''' (28 February 1895 – 3 August 1941) was a French [[interior design]]er known for [[Minimalism|minimalist]] interiors decorated with plain-lined but sumptuous furniture made of luxury materials, such as [[shagreen]], [[mica]], and intricate straw [[marquetry]].

==Life and career==
Jean-Michel Frank was born in [[Paris]], a son of Léon Frank, a banker, and his wife and cousin, the former Nanette Frank. He was a first cousin of [[Otto Frank]] and, therefore, a first cousin, once removed, of the diarist [[Anne Frank]]. 

From 1904, he attended the [[Lycée Janson de Sailly]] in Paris. He began law school in 1911, but in 1915, he was hit by the double blow of the deaths of his two elder brothers, Oscar and Georges, on the front lines of [[World War I]] and that of his father who committed suicide. In 1928, he lost his mother who had been in a Swiss asylum for several years. From 1920 to 1925 he traveled and visited the world. In Venice he met the cosmopolitan society that gathered around [[Stravinsky]] and [[Diaghilev]]. Around 1927, [[Eugenia Errázuriz]] revealed to him the beauty of 18th century styles and her own modern, minimalist esthetic, and he became her disciple. 

He then got in contact with a Parisian decorator called [[Adolphe Chanaux]] to do his apartment in the Rue de Verneuil. During the 1930s he worked with students at the Paris Atelier, now known as [[Parsons Paris School of Art and Design]], where he developed the famous [[Parsons Table]]. In 1932, with Chanaux, he opened a shop at #140 [[Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré]]. This was to be the consecration of ten years of collaboration, when he decorated for the Rockefellers and Guerlains. He designed [[Nelson Rockefeller]]'s lavish [[Fifth Avenue]] apartment in New York in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=A Rockefeller Fixer-Upper |author=Rozhon, Tracie |newspaper=The New York Times |date=14 October 1999 |location= |page= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/14/garden/turf-a-rockefeller-fixer-upper.html |accessdate=26 May 2011 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the winter of 1939-40, he left France for Argentina.

In [[Argentina]], Jean-Michel Frank worked with his old friend and business associate Ignacio Pirovano on several important private and commercial projects.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Beccacece: ''La Nación''. ''Suplemento Cultura'', http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=625203, August 8th 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Michel Frank kept his private apartment in Buenos Aires on the top floor of the company of which he was the Artistic Director&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Emmanuel Martin-Viver: ''JEAN-MICHEL FRANK'', ''The Strange and Subtle Luxury of the Parisian Haute-Monde in the Art Deco Period''; pages 74, 257 and 258.&lt;/ref&gt; in Argentina, [[COMTE]]. This building was located on the corner of Florida Street and Marcelo T. De Alvear Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Harrison Perera: ''The emergence of the importance of Jean-Michel Frank's work with Comte in Argentina'' - http://www.harrison20.com/magazine/articles/comte; page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He also visited many of his clients in Buenos Aires including the Born family&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Beccacece: ''La Nación''. ''Suplemento Cultura'', http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=625203, August 8th 2004&lt;/ref&gt; whose mansion in the northern suburbs of Buenos Aires remains his single most important project. The entire collection is still intact and in-place in precisely the manner that Jean-Michel Frank conceived it. Recently published books shed more light on Frank's work with Comte in Argentina.

In 1941, Frank made a trip to [[New York City]]. Sadly overcome by depression he committed suicide by throwing himself from the window of a Manhattan apartment building, leaving all his personal possessions in his apartment in Buenos Aires.

A unique collection of home furniture designed by Frank for [[Hermès]] in 1924 is considered a classic set of minimalist homeware. The iconic designs – including a sheepskin club chair and parchment-covered dressing table – hold an enduring popularity, and Hermès rereleased many of the items to great fanfare in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= |first1= |date=May 2011 |title=Being Frank  |journal=[[W Magazine]] |publisher=Condé Nast |volume= |issue=|page=78 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Michel Frank today is recognized by leading designers the world over as one of the greatest sources of inspiration to many present-day designs.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times blog, 20 de octubre de 2010: http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/now-showing-jean-michel-frank-in-argentina/&lt;/ref&gt; His pieces are highly sought after by leading collectors worldwide. Many of the premier auction houses offer his pieces and prices are often in excess of 200,000 EUR.&lt;ref&gt;Sotheby's, 24 de noviembre de 2010, lote 8: http://www.sothebys.com/es/catalogues/ecatalogue.html/2010/20th-century-decorative-arts-design-pf1025#/r=/es/ecat.fhtml.PF1025.html+r.m=/es/ecat.lot.PF1025.html/8/&lt;/ref&gt; An important exhibition was mounted towards the end of 2010 at a leading gallery in New York's SoHo. This exhibition highlighted Frank's work with Comte in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times blog, 20 de octubre de 2010: http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/now-showing-jean-michel-frank-in-argentina/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38194">[[File:Ostromirovo.jpg|thumb|280px|John 1:1 from the [[Ostromir Gospel]], with John's [[Evangelist portrait]], 1056 or 1057.]]
[[File:BL_Coronation_Gospels.jpg|thumb|First page of John's Gospel from the [[Coronation Gospels (British Library, Cotton MS Tiberius A.ii)|Coronation Gospels]], c. 10th century]]
'''John 1:1''' is the first verse in the [[John 1|opening chapter]] of the [[Gospel of John]]. In the [[Douay–Rheims]], [[King James Version|King James]], [[New International Version|New International]], and other versions of the [[Bible]], the verse reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|DRA}}, ''Douay-Rheims''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|KJV}}, ''KJV''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|NIV}}, ''NIV''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The phrase "the Word" (a translation of the [[Greek language|Greek]] word [[Logos (Christianity)|"Logos"]]) is widely interpreted as referring to [[Jesus]], as indicated in other verses later in the same chapter.&lt;ref&gt;See verses 14-17: "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John bore witness about him, and cried out, "This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.'")... For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."&lt;/ref&gt; This verse and others throughout [[Johannine literature]] connect the Christian understanding of Jesus to the philosophical idea of the [[Logos]] and the Hebrew [[Wisdom literature]]. They also set the stage for the later development of [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] theology early in the post-biblical era.

According to [[Matthew Henry]] (1662–1714) in his commentary, Jesus is called the "Word" in this opening verse because he ''was'' the Son of God sent to earth to reveal his Father's mind to the world. He asserts that a plain reading of the verse written by [[John the Evangelist]] should be understood as proof that Jesus is God; that Jesus has the same essence as God and existed with God the Father from the very beginning, the Word was ''with'' God, and the Word ''was'' God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc5.John.ii.html |title=Commentary on the Whole Bible Volume V (Matthew to John) by Matthew Henry|publisher=ccel.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John 1:1 opens the larger section sometimes described as the "Prologue to John" ({{Bibleref|John|1:1-1:18}}).  The Prologue deals with [[Jesus]], the "Word made flesh" who "dwelt among us" ({{Bibleref|John|1:14}}).

The Greek verse has been a source of much debate among Bible scholars and translators.

==History==
[[Tertullian]] in the early third century wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now if this one [the Word] is God according to John ("the Word was God"), then you have two: one who speaks that it may be, and another who carries it out. However, how you should accept this as "another" I have explained: as concerning person, not substance, and as distinction, not division.&lt;ref&gt;''Qui si ipse deus est secundum Ioannem - Deus erat sermo - habes duos, alium dicentem ut fiat, alium facientem. alium autem quomodo accipere debeas iam professus sum, personae non substantiae nomine, ad distinctionem non ad divisionem.'' ''[https://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0788/_P1.HTM Adversus Praxeas]'' 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And a little later:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And that you may think more fully on this, accept also that in the Psalm two gods are mentioned: "Thy throne, God, is forever, a rod of right direction is the rod of thy kingdom; thou hast loved justice and hated iniquity, therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee." If he is speaking to a god, and the god is anointed by a god, then also here he affirms two gods... More is what you will find just the same in the Gospel: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God": One who was, and another in whose presence he was.&lt;ref&gt;''Et ut adhuc amplius hoc putes, accipe et in psalmo duos deos dictos: Thronus tuus, deus, in aevum, &lt;virga directionis&gt; virga regni tui; dilexisti iustitiam et odisti iniquitatem, propterea unxit te deus, deus tuus. Si ad deum loquitur, et unctum deum a deo, affirmat et hic duos deos... Plus est quod in evangelio totidem invenies: In principio erat sermo et sermo erat apud deum et deus erat sermo: unus qui erat, et alius penes quem erat.'' ''[https://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0788/_P1.HTM Adversus Praxeas]'' 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Origen]] of Alexandria, a teacher in Greek grammar of the third century, wrote about the use of the definite article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We next notice John's use of the article in these sentences. He does not write without care in this respect, nor is he unfamiliar with the niceties of the Greek tongue. In some cases he uses the article, and in some he omits it. He adds the article to the Logos, but to the name of God he adds it sometimes only. He uses the article, when the name of God refers to the uncreated cause of all things, and omits it when the Logos is named God...(then he expands the understanding from John 1:1 by warning of the two extremes: Modalists &amp;  unitartians) They are afraid that they may be proclaiming two Gods, and their fear drives them into doctrines which are false and wicked. Either they deny that the Son has a distinct nature of His own besides that of the Father, and make Him whom they call the Son to be God all but the name, or they deny the divinity of the Son, giving Him a separate existence of His own, and making His sphere of essence fall outside that of the Father, so that they are separable from each other. . The true God, then, is The God (ho theos)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf09/Page_323.html Origen, ''Commentary on John'', Book II, chap. 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere, Origen refers to Christ as a "second God", not in a sense of separate "Ousios" or essence, but a separate "Hypostasis" - if we are to use the later Christian Terminology-  and goes on to qualify the term.&lt;ref&gt;Origen, ''Against Celsus'', [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04165.htm Book 5], Chapter 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John 1:1 in English versions===
The traditional rendering in English is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Translations by [[James Moffatt]], [[Edgar J. Goodspeed]] and [[Hugh J. Schonfield]] render part of the verse as "...the Word [Logos] was divine". [[Murray J. Harris]] writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;[It] is clear that in the translation "the Word was God", the term God is being used to denote his nature or essence, and not his person. But in normal English usage "God" is a proper noun, referring to the [[God the Father|person of the Father]] or corporately to the three persons of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]]. Moreover, "the Word was God" suggests that "the Word" and "God" are convertible terms, that the proposition is reciprocating. But the Word is neither the Father nor the [[Trinity]] … The rendering cannot stand without explanation."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Murray J., ''Jesus as God: The New Testament Use of Theos in Reference to Jesus'', 1992, Baker Books, pub. SBN 0801021952, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An Eastern/Greek Orthodox Bible commentary notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This second ''theos'' could also be translated 'divine' as the construction indicates "a qualitative sense for theos". The Word is ''not'' God in the sense that he is the ''same person'' as the ''theos'' mentioned in 1:1a; he is not [[God the Father]] (God absolutely as in common [[New Testament|NT]] usage) or the [[Trinity]]. The point being made is that the [[Christ the Logos|Logos]] is of the ''same uncreated nature'' or essence as [[God the Father]], with whom he eternally exists. This verse is echoed in the [[Nicene Creed]]: "[[God the Son|God]] (qualitative or derivative) from [[God the Father|God]] (personal, the [[God the Father|Father]]), Light from Light, True God from True God… ''[[Homoousian|homoousion]]'' with the Father."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eastern / Greek Orthodox Bible]], [http://www.orthodox-church.info/eob/download/nt6x9.pdf New Testament], 2009, p231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Difficulties===
{{Quotation|The text of John 1:1 has a sordid past and a myriad of interpretations. With the Greek alone, we can create empathic, orthodox, creed-like statements, or we can commit pure and unadulterated heresy. From the point of view of early church history, heresy develops when a misunderstanding arises concerning Greek articles, the predicate nominative, and grammatical word order. The early church heresy of [[Sabellianism]] understood John 1:1c to read, "and the Word was ''the'' God." The early church heresy of Arianism understood it to read, "and the word was ''a'' God."|David A. Reed&lt;ref&gt;David A. Reed. "How Semetic Was John? Rethinking the Hellenistic Background to John 1:1." ''Anglican Theological Review,'' Fall 2003, Vol. 85 Issue 4, p709&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are two issues affecting the translating of the verse, [[theology]] and proper application of grammatical rules. The commonly held theology that Jesus is God naturally leads one to believe that the proper way to render the verse is the one which is most popular.&lt;ref&gt;William Arnold III, [http://www.apostolic.net/biblicalstudies/colwell.htm Colwell's Rule and John 1:1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404191849/http://www.apostolic.net/biblicalstudies/colwell.htm |date=2007-04-04 }} at apostolic.net: "You could only derive a Trinitarian interpretation from John 1:1 if you come to this passage with an already developed Trinitarian theology. If you approached it with a strict [[Monotheism]] (which is what I believe John held to) then this passage would definitely support such a view." {{cite web|url=http://www.apostolic.net/biblicalstudies/colwell.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404191849/http://www.apostolic.net/biblicalstudies/colwell.htm |archivedate=April  4, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposing theology that Jesus is subordinate to God as his Chief agent leads to the conclusion that ''"... a god"'' or ''"... divine"'' is the proper rendering.&lt;ref&gt;Beduhn in ''Truth in Translation: Accuracy and Bias in English Translations of the New Testament'' chapter 11 states:
"Translators of the [[KJV]], [[NRSV]], [[NIV]], [[New American Bible|NAB]], [[New American Standard Bible]], AB, [[Good News Bible]] and [[The Living Bible|LB]] all approached the text at John 1:1 already believing certain things about the Word...and made sure that the translations came out in accordance with their beliefs.... Ironically, some of these same scholars are quick to charge the NW translation with "doctrinal bias" for translating the verse literally, free of KJV influence, following the sense of the Greek. It may very well be that the NW translators came to the task of translating John 1:1 with as much bias as the other translators did. It just so happens that their bias corresponds in this case to a more accurate translation of the Greek."&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars oppose the translation ''...a god'',&lt;ref&gt;Dr. J. R. Mantey: "It is neither scholarly nor reasonable to translate John 1:1 'The Word was a god.'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Bruce M. Metzger of Princeton (Professor of New Testament Language and Literature): "As a matter of solid fact, however, such a rendering is a frightful mistranslation. It overlooks entirely an established rule of Greek grammar which necessitates the rendering "...and the Word was God." http://www.bible-researcher.com/metzger.jw.html—see chapter IV point 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Samuel J. Mikolaski of Zurich, Switzerland: "It is monstrous to translate the phrase 'the Word was a god.'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=xEvXKTG9Mf4C&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=%22new+world+translation%22+falsification&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uJc1UcSfEunqiAeTq4B4&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20world%20translation&amp;f=false Ben Witherington III, The Living Word of God, 2007, Baylor University Press, pp. 211-213.&lt;/ref&gt; while other scholars believe it is possible or even preferable.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Jason BeDuhn (of Northern Arizona University) in regard to the Kingdom Interlinear's appendix that gives the reason why the NWT favoured a translation of John 1:1 as saying the Word was not "God" but "a god" said: "In fact the KIT [Appendix 2A, p.1139] explanation is perfectly correct according to the best scholarship done on this subject.."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray J. Harris has written: "Accordingly, from the point of view of grammar alone, [QEOS HN hO LOGOS] could be rendered "the Word was a god,...." -''Jesus As God'', 1992, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Dodd says: "If a translation were a matter of substituting words, a possible translation of [QEOS EN hO LOGOS]; would be, "The Word was a god". As a word-for-word translation it cannot be faulted."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar===

The Greek article is often translated ''the'', which is the English definite article, but it can have a range of meanings that can be quite different from those found in English, and require context to interpret.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/bgreek/project/funk-grammar/pre-alpha/lesson-49.html "The Article"]. A section heading in Robert W. Funk, ''A Beginning-Intermediate Grammar of Hellenistic Greek.'' Volume I. Second Corrected Edition. ''Scholars Press''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek does not have an indefinite article like the English word ''a'', and nominatives without articles also have a range of meanings that require context to interpret.

In interpreting this verse, ''[[Colwell's rule]]'' should be taken into consideration, which says that a definite predicate which is before the verb "to be" usually does not have the definite article. [[Ernest Cadman Colwell]] writes:

{{Quote|The opening verse of John’s Gospel contains one of the many passages where this rule suggests the translation of a predicate as a definite noun. {{lang|grc|Καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος}} [{{transl|grc|Kaì theòs ên ho lógos}}] looks much more like "And the Word was God" than "And the Word was divine" when viewed with reference to this rule. The absence of the article does not make the predicate indefinite or qualitative when it precedes the verb, it is indefinite in this position only when the context demands it. The context makes no such demand in the Gospel of John, for this statement cannot be regarded as strange in the prologue of the gospel which reaches its climax in the confession of Thomas [Footnote: John 20,28]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=[[Ernest Cadman Colwell]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118000000/http://www.areopage.net/ColwellRule.pdf|archivedate=January 18, 2016|deadurl=no|title=A definite rule for the use of the article in the Greek New Testament|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|date=1933|volume=52|pages=12–21|url=http://www.areopage.net/ColwellRule.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The question is whether Colwell's rule helps in interpreting John 1:1. It has been pointed out that Colwell's rule has been misapplied as its converse, as though it implied definiteness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Daniel B. Wallace]]|title=Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics|date=1997|page=257|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=XlqoTVsk2wcC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;lpg=PA257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray J. Harris, ''Jesus as God: The New Testament Use of Theos in Reference to Jesus'' p.51-71&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel B. Wallace]] argues that the use of the anarthrous ''theos'' (the lack of the definite article before the second ''theos'') is due to its use as a qualitative noun, describing the nature or essence of the Word, not due to Colwell's rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XlqoTVsk2wcC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;lpg=PA269 Wallace, ibid., p. 269]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rendering as "a god" is justified by some non-Trinitarians by comparing it with Acts 28:6 which has a similar grammatical construction'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

However, it was noted that the Hebrew words El, HaElohim and Yahweh (all referring to God) were rendered as anarthrous ''theos'' in the Septuagint at {{bibleverse||Nahum|1:2|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Isaiah|37:16|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|41:4|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|23:23|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|45:9|HE}} among many other locations.

Therefore, anarthrous or arthrous constructions by themselves, without context, cannot determine how to render it into a target language. In {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|31:27}} the [[septuagint]] text, "supported by all MSS... reads πρὸς τὸν θεόν for the Hebrew עִם־ יְהֹוָ֔ה",&lt;ref name=KCorYHWH&gt;{{cite book|author=Albert Pietersma|title=KYRIOS OR TETRAGRAM: A RENEWED QUEST FOR THE ORIGINAL LXX|work=DE SEPTUAGINTA.

Many such occurrences for qualitative nouns are identified in the Coptic New Testament, including {{bibleverse|1|John|1:5}} and {{bibleverse|1|John|4:8}}. Moreover, the indefinite article is used to refer to God in {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|4:31|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Malachi|2:10|HE}}.

Coptic scholar George Horner renders the Sahidic Coptic of John 1:1c as "and [a] God was the word," while his apparatus mentions, "Square brackets imply words used by the Coptic and not required by the English".&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/christiantopics2020/coptic-john-1-1 Coptic John 1:1: Another Lie to Justify the NWT?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical parallels==
"In the beginning (''archē'') was the Word (''logos'')" may be compared with:
*Genesis 1:1: "In the beginning God created heaven, and earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Genesis|1:1|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening words of the [[Old Testament]] are also "In the beginning". Theologian [[Charles Ellicott]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The reference to the opening words of the Old Testament is obvious, and is the more striking when we remember that a Jew would constantly speak of and quote from the book of Genesis as "[[Bereishit (disambiguation)|Berēshîth]]" ("in the beginning"). It is quite in harmony with the Hebrew tone of this Gospel to do so, and it can hardly be that St. John wrote his Berēshîth without having that of [[Moses]] present to his mind, and without being guided by its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/john/1.htm Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers] on John 1, accessed 22 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Mark 1:1: "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Mark|1:1|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Luke 1:2: "According as they have delivered them unto us, who from the beginning (''archē'') were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word (''logos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Luke|1:2|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David L. Jeffrey ''A Dictionary of biblical tradition in English literature'' 1992 Page 460 "...in his reference to 'eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word' (Luke 1:2) he is certainly speaking of the person as well as the words and actions of Jesus"&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1 John 1:1: "That which was from the beginning (''archē''), which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the word (''logos'') of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|1 John|1:1|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dwight Moody Smith ''First, Second, and Third John'' 1991 Page 48 "Of course, were it not for the Gospel, it would not be so obvious to us that "the word of life" in 1 John 1:1 is Jesus Christ. Strikingly, only in the prologue of each is the logos to be identified with Jesus."&lt;/ref&gt;

"...was God (''Theós'')" may be compared with Acts 28:6:
*"But they supposed that he would begin to swell up, and that he would suddenly fall down and die. But expecting long, and seeing that there came no harm to him, changing their minds, they said, that he '''was a god''' (''theón'')."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Acts|28:6|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he '''was a god''' (''theón'')." (KJV)&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Acts|28:6|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"But they were expecting that he was going to swell up or suddenly drop dead. So after they had waited a long time and had seen nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he '''was a god''' (''theón'')." (NET)&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Acts|28:6|NET}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he '''was a god''' (''theón'')."

==Logos==
{{Main article|Logos (Christianity)}}

The [[Greek language|Greek]] word λόγος or '''''logos''''' is a word with various meanings. It is often translated into [[English language|English]] as "[[Word]]" but can also mean thought, speech, account, meaning, [[reason]], [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]], principle, standard, or [[logic]], among other things. It has varied use in the fields of [[philosophy]], [[analytical psychology]], [[rhetoric]] and [[religion]].

==Christology==
{{Main article|Christology}}Of the [[Biblical canon|canonical]] gospels, John has the highest explicit [[Christology]]. Here Jesus is the [[Divine filiation|only-begotten]] [[Son of God]], [[Via, Veritas, Vita|the Way, the Truth, the Life]], the [[True Vine]], etc. In 1:1, John identifies Jesus as the ''[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]'', that which made the existence of the created world possible.

In mainstream Christian understanding of John's Christology, the conception that [[Jesus Christ]] is the ''[[Logos]]'' has been important in establishing the doctrine of Jesus' divinity, as well as that of the [[Trinity]], as set forth in the [[Chalcedonian Definition]].

The debate about the nature of [[Christ]] from the first century through the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 CE must be understood in light of the pervasive world view of Platonic [[Theory of forms|dualism]]. [[Platonism]] is normally divided into four periods: [[Old Academy]] (347-267 BCE), [[New Academy]] (267-80 BCE), [[Middle Platonism]] (80 BCE-250 CE), and [[Neoplatonism]] (250 CE through the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Moore: ''Neoplatonism'' in The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, available at [http://www.iep.utm.edu/n/neoplato.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Dillion: "Plato/Platonism," in The dictionary of New Testament Background, ed. by Craig A. Evans and Stanley E. Porter, (Downers Grove: Intervarsity Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Biblical criticism|scholars]] of the [[Bible]]{{Who|date=June 2010}} have suggested that John made creative use of double meaning in the word ''Logos'' to communicate to both [[Jews]], who were familiar with the [[Wisdom tradition]] in [[Judaism]], and [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenic polytheism]], especially followers of [[Philo]], often called [[Hellenistic Judaism]]. Each of these two groups had its own history associated with the concept of the Logos, and each could understand John's use of the term from one or both of those contexts. Especially for the Hellenists, however, John turns the concept of the Logos on its head when he claimed "the ''Logos'' became flesh and dwelt among us" (John 1:14).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

[[Gordon Clark]] translated ''Logos'' as "Logic" in the opening verses of the Gospel: "In the beginning was the Logic, and the Logic was with God and the Logic was God." He meant to imply by this translation that the [[classical logic|laws of logic]] were contained in the Bible itself and were therefore not a [[secular]] principle imposed on the Christian [[worldview]].

Following [[Jesuit]] translations of the 18th century, most modern [[Bible translations into Chinese]] use the word "[[Tao]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Wiktionary-inline|道}}&lt;/ref&gt; in John 1:1 to translate "Logos", following the use as "Idea" in [[Taoism]].&lt;ref&gt;Amy Golahny - ''Points of contact: crossing cultural boundaries'' 2004 Page 38 "By way of contrast, most eighteenth-century translations in China were theological works, and Jesuits turned instead to translating ... ultimately "to find God" for the Jesuits and "to fathom principles" of the Tao for the Chinese."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative views===
In [[Unitarianism]] there are other interpretations of John 1:1. In the commentaries on John 1 by [[Lelio Sozzini]] (Zurich, c.1559)&lt;ref&gt;Sozzini, Lelio; ''Brevis explicatio in primum Iohannis caput'' published posthumously in ''De falsa et vera unius Dei Patri, filii, et spiritus sancti'' 1568, [[Alba Iulia]]&lt;/ref&gt; and his nephew [[Fausto Sozzini]] (Lyons, c.1562)&lt;ref&gt;Sozzini, Fausto; ''Brevis explicatio in primum Iohannis caput'' Amsterdam 1565? also published Alba Iulia 1568, by [[Francis David]] in his ''Refutatio propositionum Melii'' but misattributed as a second version of the commentary by Lelio Sozzini.&lt;/ref&gt; the "word" being "made flesh" is taken as a reference to the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]], and not to the personal [[pre-existence of Christ]]. The passages in the New Testament referring to the Logos were explained by Fausto Sozzini as relating to the foreknown work of Christ as the author of the [[new creation (theology)|new creation]], not as relating to the "old" [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis creation]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lawrence Ottley ''The Doctrine of the Incarnation'' 2009, Page 322 "The passages in the New Testament referring to the Logos were explained by Socinus to relate to the predestined work of the Redeemer as the author of the new moral creation."&lt;/ref&gt; Fausto Sozzini aimed to "completely de-Platonize" the reading of John 1:1-15.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Schmidt-Biggemann, Anja Hallacker ''Apokalypse und Philologie: Wissensgeschichten und Weltentwürfe der '' 2007 Page 86 "Es ist klar, dass Sozzini unter diesen Bedingungen eine eigenständige Logos-Theologie nicht akzeptieren kann. Er versucht vielmehr, den Prolog des Johannesevangeliums vollständig zu entplatonisieren."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Fire Lame Deer''' (in [[Lakota language|Lakota]] '''''Tȟáȟča Hušté'''''; March 17, 1903&lt;ref&gt;{{findagrave|146624635}}&lt;/ref&gt; – December 14, 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Indian Chief |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19761216&amp;id=3GNhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8KAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1596,4884473 |publisher=[[Reading Eagle]] |date=1976-12-16 |accessdate=2015-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Lame Deer''', '''John Fire''' and '''John (Fire) Lame Deer''') was a Lakota holy man, member of the [[Heyoka]] society,{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} grandson of the [[Miniconjou]] head man [[Lame Deer]], and father of [[Archie Fire Lame Deer]].

John Fire Lame Deer was a Mineconju-Lakota [[Sioux]] born on the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]].  His father was Silas Fire Let-Them-Have-Enough.  His mother was Sally Red Blanket.  He lived with his grandparents until he was 6 or 7, after which he was placed in a day school near the family until age fourteen.  He was then sent to a [[American Indian boarding schools|boarding school]], one of many run by the [[U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs]] for Indian youth.  These schools were designed to assimilate [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] into the dominant culture after their forced settlement on reservations.

Lame Deer's life as a young man was rough and wild; he traveled the [[rodeo]] circuit as a rider and later as a [[rodeo clown]].  According to his personal account, he drank, gambled, womanized, and once went on a several-day-long car theft and drinking binge.

Making his home at the [[Pine Ridge Reservation]] and traveling around the country, Lame Deer became known both among the Lakota and to the American public at a time when indigenous culture and spirituality were going through a period of rebirth and the [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] movement of the 1960s had yet to disintegrate.  He often participated in [[American Indian Movement]] events, including [[sit-in]]s at the [[Black Hills]]. The Black Hills is land that was legally owned by the Lakota until it was illegally seized by the [[United States]] government without compensation after the discovery of [[gold]] in the area.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians]]'', 448 U.S. 371, 378 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Hills are sacred to the Lakota and a number of other [[Plains Indians|Plains tribes]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] found that the federal government "decided to abandon the Nation's treaty obligation to preserve the integrity of the Sioux territory"&lt;ref&gt;''Sioux Nation of Indians'', 448 U.S. at 378.&lt;/ref&gt; and used military force to seize the Black Hills.&lt;ref&gt;''Sioux Nation of Indians'', 448 U.S. at 381-382.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakota continue to campaign for the return of the Black Hills.

==''Lame Deer, Seeker of Visions''==
In 1972, [[Richard Erdoes]] published ''Lame Deer, Seeker of Visions''; his recorded interviews with Lame Deer are part of the Richard Erdoes Papers at the [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]], [[Yale University]].

The book is about Lame Deer's later life, when he decided that he wanted to be a teacher and a healer. Erdoes writes of Lame Deer's opinions of Elk, Bear, Buffalo, Coyote, and Badger medicine,&lt;ref name=Erdoes&gt;Erdoes, Richard (1972) ''Lame Deer, seeker of visions''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4162">'''Karramiyya''' ({{lang-ar-at| كرّاميّه | Karrāmiyyah}}) is a sect in [[Islam]] which flourished in the central and eastern parts of the Islamic worlds, and especially in the Iranian regions, from the 9th century until the [[Mongol invasions]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name="brill"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia||url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/search?s.q=Karr%C4%81miyya&amp;s.f.s2_parent=&amp;search-go=Search|title=Karrāmiyya| publisher=BRILL |accessdate=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Muslim Beliefs|Five Pillars}}  
The sect was founded by a [[Sistani Persian people|Sistani]] named Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad b. Karrām&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/karramiya Encyclopedia Iranica, "KARRĀMIYA"]&lt;/ref&gt; (d. 896) who was a popular preacher in [[Khurasan]] in the 9th century in the vicinity of [[Nishapur]]. He later emigrated with many of his followers to [[Jerusalem]]. According to him, the Karrāmites were also called the "followers of Abū'Abdallāh" '' (aṣḥāb Abī'Abdallāh) ''. &lt;ref&gt; Zysow: '' Two unrecognized Karrāmī texts. '' 1988, p. 580 &lt;/ref&gt;. Its main distribution areas were in [[Greater Khorasan]], [[Transoxiana]] and eastern peripheral areas of [[Iran]]. Early [[Ghaznavids]] and the early [[Ghurid dynasty]] granted the Karrāmīyan rulership. The most important center of the community remained until the end of the 11th century Nishapur. After its decline, the Karrāmīya survived only in [[Ghazni]] and [[Ghor]] in the area of today's [[Afghanistan]].

==Doctrine==
The doctrine of the Karramiyya consisted of [[Qur'anic literalism|literalism]] and [[anthropomorphism]]. Ibn Karram considered that God was a substance and that He had a body (''jism'') finite in certain directions when He comes into contact with the Throne.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=B. |last2=Menage |first2=V.L. |last3=Pellat |first3=Ch. |last4=Schacht |first4=J. |title=Encyclopaedia of Islam (New Edition) |volume=Volume IV (Iran-Kha) |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden, Netherlands |date=1997 |origyear=1st. pub. 1978 |isbn=9004078193 |page=667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ess"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mat"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kDYsAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111| title=Material Culture and Asian Religions: Text, Image, Object| first1=Benjamin| last1=Fleming| first2=Richard |last2=Mann| publisher=Routledge|year=2014| pages=333| isbn=978-1-135013738| accessdate=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief was rejected by orthodox [[Sunni]] Muslim scholars such as [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami]] who stated that, "They believe that God is a body sitting on the Throne, touching it and resting on it, and then moves down every night during the last third of the night to the heavens, and then goes back to His place at dawn."&lt;ref&gt;Yossef Rapoport and Shahab Ahmed, Introduction in Ibn Taymiyya and His Times, eds. Yossef Rapoport and Shahab Ahmed (Karachi: Oxford University Press, 2010), 278&lt;/ref&gt;

They also believed that [[Munkar and Nakir]] angels were actually the same as guardian angels on the right and left side of every person.&lt;ref name="ess"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JNxvMRJM3EAC&amp;pg=PA284 | title=The Essentials of Ibadi Islam| first=Valerie |last=J. Hoffman| publisher=Syracuse University Press| year=2012| pages=328| isbn=978-0815650843| accessdate=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Karramiyya also held the view that the world was eternal and that God's power was limited.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

These beliefs were rejected by many [[Sunni]] theologians as [[heresy|heretical]] and eventually disappeared. The Karramiyya operated centers of worship and propagated [[asceticism]].&lt;ref name="form"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Formation of Islam: Religion and Society in the Near East, 600-1800 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mLV6lo4mvj0C&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=karramiyya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SMn_U8qhFOjWiwKb4IGoCw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=karramiyya&amp;f=false| first=Jonathan | last=Porter Berkey| volume=2|edition=illustrated, reprint| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=2003| isbn=9780521588133|pages=286| accessdate=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katherine Burton''' (born Katherine Kurz, 18 Mar 1887, in Lakewood, near [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]];&lt;ref&gt;Reichardt, Mary R.; ''Catholic Women Writers: a Bio-Bibliographical Sourcebook''; p. 18. {{ISBN|0-313-31147-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; died September 22, 1969) was an American [[Roman Catholic]] convert who became renowned in her post-conversion years as a religious [[biographer]]. She was also a prominent social activist campaigning for family rights, a [[poet]] and a [[short story]] writer.

==Early years==
Burton was originally the daughter of a [[Germans|German]] [[Lutheran]] family who rarely went to church. Apart from Sunday School it is thought that in her childhood she had little interest in religion.&lt;ref name="Duquin"&gt;Duquin, Lorene Hanley; ''A Century of Catholic Converts''; p. 87. {{ISBN|1-931709-01-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated about 1906 from [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve College]]. At that time she considered herself an [[agnostic]] and never attended religious services,&lt;ref name="Duquin" /&gt; even after marrying Harry Payne Burton, a journalist who had originally intended to become an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal priest]] 6 Aug 1910. Harry was to have considerable trouble during his marriage - which produced three children - eventually committing [[suicide]] 3 Apr 1952.

==Conversion to Catholicism==
During the following decade, she travelled frequently, in the process coming into contact with [[Selden Delany]], the assistant rector at an Episcopal Church in [[New York, New York|New York City]], who was to lead her journey to Catholicism in the coming years. Delany, who died in 1935, converted to Catholicism in the late 1920s and his book ''Why Rome?'', published in 1930, convinced Katherine to convert immediately. She was received into the Church on September 8, 1930, but even before that she wrote two [[poem]]s, "So Died a True Christian" and "A Prayer for Ronald" (both 1927) that had a strongly Catholic flavour.

==After conversion==
Along with her close friend and fellow convert [[Dorothy Day]], Burton was the first major Catholic woman journalist in the United States. In 1933, at the same time as Day established the Catholic Worker, Burton wrote a journal ''Woman'' that was published by the [[Passionist Fathers]]&lt;ref&gt;Reichardt; ''Catholic Women Writers''; p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and advocated motherhood as the greatest possible vocation at a time when it was becoming very difficult for women to raise children due to economic conditions.&lt;ref name="Allitt"&gt;Allitt, Patrick; ''Catholic Converts: British and American Intellectuals Turn to Rome''; p. 154. {{ISBN|0-8014-2996-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Burton believed that women should be aided as much as possible if they were forced to seek paid employment outside the home.&lt;ref name="Allitt"/&gt; Katherine Burton in fact believed that balancing work and family was an extremely rich reward for any woman who could do so. Like Day, Katherine Burton was initially a pacifist, but in contrast to Day's consistent stance, Burton relented from pacifism during [[World War II]] because she feared the result of the spread of [[totalitarianism]] if the US did nothing about it.

Burton was, even before her conversion, interested in the problems women faced with large families, and even before it become the only method of birth control approved by the Church, she was a developer and advocate of the rhythm method of contraception, having known about the fertile and infertile periods of the [[menstruation|menstrual cycle]] ever since her days at college during the 1900s. She also believed that most Roman Catholic writers of her time were stylistically flawed because they were "too arrogant and preachy", with the result that she wrote biographies that read more like fiction.

During this time, she was also an associate editor at Redbook magazine and wrote a column for a Catholic periodical.

She died 22 Sep 1969 in [[Bronxville]], New York, and is buried in Cleveland, Ohio.

[[File:Sarcophagus Marcus Cornelius Statius Louvre Ma659 n1.jpg|thumb|Relief from a child's sarcophagus depicting a nursing mother with the father looking on ''(ca. 150 AD)'']] 
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''birth and childhood deities''' were thought to care for every aspect of [[fertilisation|conception]], [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], and [[child development]]. Some major [[List of Roman deities|deities of Roman religion]] had a specialized function they contributed to this sphere of human life, while other deities are known only by the name with which they were [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#invocatio|invoked]] to promote or avert a particular action. Several of these slight "divinities of the moment"&lt;ref&gt;Giulia Sissa, "Maidenhood without Maidenhead: The Female Body in Ancient Greece," in ''Before Sexuality: The Construction of Erotic Experience in the Ancient Greek World'' (Princeton University Press, 1990), p. 362, translating the German term ''Augenblicksgötter'' which was coined by [[Hermann Usener]].&lt;/ref&gt; are mentioned in surviving texts only by [[Christian apologetics|Christian polemicists]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 2, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

An extensive Greek and Latin medical literature covered [[obstetrics]] and infant care, and the [[2nd century]] Greek gynecologist [[Soranus of Ephesus]] advised [[midwife|midwives]] not to be superstitious. But childbirth in antiquity remained a life-threatening experience for both the woman and her newborn, with [[infant mortality]] as high as 30 or 40 percent.&lt;ref&gt;M. Golden, "Did the Ancients Care When Their Children Died?" ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 35 (1988) 152–163; Keith R. Bradley, "Wet-nursing at Rome: A Study in Social Relations," in ''The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives'' (Cornell University Press, 1986, 1992), p. 202; Beryl Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Rites of passage pertaining to birth and death had several parallel aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Corbeill, "Blood, Milk, and Tears: The Gestures of Mourning Women," in ''Nature Embodied: Gesture in Ancient Rome'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), pp. 67–105.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maternal death]] was common: one of the most famous was [[Julia (daughter of Caesar) |Julia]], daughter of [[Julius Caesar]] and wife of [[Pompey]]. Her infant died a few days later, severing the family ties between her father and husband and hastening the [[Caesar's Civil War]], which ended the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Some ritual practices may be characterized as anxious superstitions, but the religious aura surrounding childbirth reflects the high value Romans placed on family, tradition ''([[mos maiorum]])'', and compatibility of the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], children were celebrated on coins, as was [[Lucina (goddess)|Juno Lucina]], the primary goddess of childbirth, as well as in public art.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Funerary art, such as [[relief]] on [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], sometimes showed scenes from the deceased's life, including birth or the first bath.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only those who died after the age of 10 were given full [[Roman funerary practices|funeral and commemorative rites]], which in ancient Rome were observed by families several days during the year (see [[Parentalia]]). Infants less than one year of age received no formal rites. The lack of ritual observances pertains to the [[status in Roman legal system|legal status]] of the individual in society, not the emotional response of families to the loss.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Cicero]] reflected:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some think that if a small child dies this must be borne with equanimity; if it is still in its cradle there should not even be a lament. And yet it is from the latter that nature has more cruelly demanded back the gift she had given.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''Tusculan Disputations'' 1.93,as cited by Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Sources==
The most extensive lists of deities pertaining to the conception-birth-development cycle come from the [[Church Fathers]], especially [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Tertullian]]. Augustine in particular is known to have used the now-fragmentary theological works of [[Marcus Terentius Varro]], the [[1st century BC]] Roman scholar, who in turn referenced the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#libri pontificales|books of the Roman pontiffs]]. The purpose of the [[patristics|patristic]] writers was to debunk traditional Roman religion, but they provide useful information despite their mocking tone.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', ''Religions of Rome,''vol. 2, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Scattered mentions occur throughout [[Latin literature]].

The following list of deities is organized chronologically by the role they play in the process.&lt;ref&gt;The order is based on that of Robert Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 2001; originally published in French 1998), pp. 18–20, and [[Jörg Rüpke]], ''Religion in Republican Rome: Rationalization and Ritual Change'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002), pp. 181–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception and pregnancy==
{{See also|Sexuality in ancient Rome|Marriage in ancient Rome}}
The gods of the marriage bed ''(di coniugales)'' are also gods of conception.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'', vol. 2, pp. 32–33; Rüpke, ''Religion of the Romans'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], one of the three [[tutelary deity|deities]] of the [[Capitoline Triad]], presides over union and marriage as well, and some of the minor deities invoked for success in conceiving and delivering a child may have been [[indigitamenta|functional aspects]] of her powers.
* '''Jugatinus''' is a conjugal god, from ''iugare'', "to join, yoke, marry."&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 6.9.&lt;!--or 4.9--&gt;[[Ludwig Preller]], ''Römische Mythologie'' (Berlin, 1881), vol. 1, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cinxia''' functions within the belt ''(cingulum)'' that the bride wears to symbolize that her husband is "belted and bound" ''(cinctus vinctusque)'' to her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] 55 (edition of Lindsay); Karen K. Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 101, 110, 211.&lt;/ref&gt; It was tied with the [[Hercules knot|knot of Hercules]], intended to be intricate and difficult to untie.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine calls this goddess '''Virginiensis''' (''virgo'', "virgin"), indicating that the untying is the symbolic loss of virginity.&lt;ref&gt;For an extensive look at the knot of virginity, primarily in early Christian culture, see S. Panayotakis, "The Knot and the Hymen: A Reconsideration of ''Nodus Virginitatis'' (''Hist. Apoll.'' 1)," ''Mnemosyne'' 53.5 (2000) 599–608.&lt;/ref&gt; Cinxia may have been felt as present during a ritual meant to ease [[childbirth|labor]]. The man who fathered the child removes his own belt ''(cinctus)'', binds it ''(cinxerit)'' around the laboring woman, then releases it with a prayer that the one who has bound her in labor should likewise release her: "he should then leave."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 28.42; Anthony Corbeill, ''Nature Embodied: Gesture in Ancient Rome'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Women who had experienced [[miscarriage|spontaneous abortions]] were advised to bind their bellies for the full nine months with a belt ''(cingulum)'' of wool from a lamb fed upon by a wolf.&lt;ref&gt;Attributed to [[Theodorus Priscianus]], ''Additamenta'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=42EKAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA351&amp;dq=%22lanam+de+ove+quam+lupus%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sgWtT82vB4vpgAf55M3nDA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lanam%20de%20ove%20quam%20lupus%22&amp;f=false 10]; Corbeill, ''Nature Embodied,'' p. 37. See also [[Marcellus Empiricus]], ''De medicamentis'' 10.70 and 82.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Subigus''' is the god ''(deus)'' who causes the bride to give in to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 6.9.&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from the verb ''subigo, subigere'', "to cause to go under; tame, subdue," used of the active role in sexual intercourse, hence "cause to submit sexually".&lt;ref&gt;J.N. Adams, ''The Latin Sexual Vocabulary'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982), pp. 155–156. The verb is used in the satiric verses chanted by the soldiers at the [[Roman triumph|triumph]] of Julius Caesar, where he is said to have caused the Gauls to submit (see [[Gallic Wars]]), and to have submitted himself to [[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia|Nicomedes]]. A ''subigitatrix'' was a woman who took the active role in fondling ([[Plautus]], ''[[Persa (play)|Persa]]'' 227).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Prema''' is the insistent sex act, from the verb ''primo, primere'', to press upon. Although the verb usually describes the masculine role, Augustine calls Prema ''[[List of Roman deities#Mater and Pater|dea Mater]]'', a mother goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Latin Sexual Vocabulary,'' p. 182; Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 6.9.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Inuus]]''' ("Entry"), the phallic god '''[[Mutunus Tutunus]]''', and '''Pertunda''' enable sexual penetration. Inuus, sometimes identified with [[Faunus]], embodies the mammalian impulse toward mating. The cult of Mutunus was associated with the sacred ''[[fascinum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The cult of this god was either misunderstood or deliberately misrepresented by [[Church Fathers]] as a ritual deflowering during marriage rites; no Roman source describes such a thing. See [[Mutunus Tutunus]].&lt;/ref&gt; Both these gods are attested outside conception litany. Pertunda is the female [[personification]]&lt;ref&gt;Sissa, "Maidenhood without Maidenhead," p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; of the verb ''pertundere'', "to penetrate",&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine of Hippo]], ''De Civitate Dei'' 6.9.3.&lt;/ref&gt; and seems to be a name for invoking a divine power specific to this function.
* '''[[Janus (mythology)|Janus]]''', the forward- and backward-facing god of doorways and passages, "opened up access to the generative seed which was provided by [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]," the god of sowing.&lt;ref&gt;Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome,'' p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Consevius''' or '''Deus Consevius''', also '''Consivius''', is the god of propagation and insemination,&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, ''Religion in Republican Rome,'' p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; from ''con-serere'', "to sow." It is a title of Janus as a creator god or god of beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals,'' p. 289. [[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' `1.9, lists ''Consivius'' among the titles of Janus from the act of sowing ''(a conserendo)'', that is, "the propagation of the human race," with Janus as the ''auctor'' ("increaser," source, author). Macrobius says that the title ''Consivia'' also belongs to the goddess [[Ops]].&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Liber Pater]]''' ("Father Liber") empowers the man to release his semen,&lt;ref&gt;Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome,'' p. 18, citing Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 6.9.3.&lt;/ref&gt; while '''[[Libera (mythology)|Libera]]''' does the same for the woman, who was regarded as also contributing ''semina'', "seed."&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, ''Religion in Republican Rome,'' p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mena''' or '''Dea Mena''' with Juno assured [[menstruation|menstrual flow]],&lt;ref&gt;Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome,'' p. 18, citing Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' IV.11: ''[http://www.augustinus.it/latino/cdd/index2.htm dea Mena, quam praefecerunt menstruis feminarum] :"The goddess Mena, who was put in charge of menstruation"'' This may seem illogically placed in the sequence; Roman girls were not married until they were ready for childbearing, so menstruation would mark the bride as old enough to marry, and conception would halt the flow.&lt;/ref&gt; which is redirected to feed the developing child.&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, ''Religion in Republican Rome,'' p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Fluonia''' or '''Fluvionia''', from ''fluo, fluere,'' "to flow," is a form of Juno who retains the nourishing blood within the womb.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''Ad nationes'' 2.11.3; Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome,'' p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Women attended to the cult of Juno Fluonia "because she held back the flow of blood (i.e., menstruation) in the act of conception."&lt;ref&gt;Excerpts from Paulus in Festus, p. 82 (edition of Lindsay): ''mulieres colebant, quod eam sanguinis fluorem in conceptu retinere putabant.''&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval mythographers noted this aspect of Juno,&lt;ref&gt;Juno "is called Fluonia, from the flowing ''(fluoribus)'' of seed, because she frees women in childbirth," according to the [[Third Vatican Mythographer]], as translated by Ronald E. Pepin, ''The Vatican Mythographers'' (Fordham University Press, 2008), p. 225. ''Fluoribus'' might also be translated as "emissions, discharge." The Berlin Commentary to the ''De nuptiis'' of [[Martianus Capella]] (2.92) compares this moisture to the dew that drips from the air and nourishes seeds;&lt;!--note on ''nam Fluvoniam'': quasi diceret: istis ego te nominibus nuncupabo que secundum proprietates mee petitioni congruas data sunt, nam aliis nominibus alie te potius nominabunt rogantes. Fluvonia autem dicitur ipsa a fluore, id est a rore qui de aere fluit ad hec inferiora, ut eo nutriantur germina. Et ideo matrone sic eam vocant que fetus habent de rore nutriendos--&gt; Haijo Jan Westra and Tanja Kupke, ''The Berlin Commentary on Martianus Capella's ''De Nuptiis Philologie et Mercurii'', Book II'' (Brill, 1998), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; which marked a woman as a ''mater'' rather than a ''virgo''.&lt;ref&gt;In his commentary on the ''De nuptiis'' of [[Martianus Capella]], [[Remigius of Auxerre]] "explains Fluvonia from the contraceptive use of the discharges of seeds to free women from childbirth"; see Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography from Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433–1177'' (University Press of Florida, 1994), p.286.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Alemona''' feeds the embryo&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''De anima'' 37.1 ''(Alemonam alendi in utero fetus)''; Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome,'' p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; or generally nourished growth ''in utero.''&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, ''Religion in Republican Rome,'' p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Vitumnus''' endows the fetus with ''vita'', "life" or the vital principle or power of life (see also [[quickening]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, ''Religion in Republican Rome,'' p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine calls him the ''vivificator'', "creator of life," and links him with Sentinus (following) as two "very obscure" gods who are examples of the misplaced priorities of the Roman pantheon. These two gods, he suggests, should merit inclusion among the ''[[di selecti]]'', "select" or principal gods, instead of those who preside over physical functions such as Janus, Saturn, Liber and Libera.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 7.2–3; see also Tertullian, ''Ad nationes'' 2.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Vitumnus and Sentinus were most likely names that focalized the functions of Jove.&lt;ref&gt;Preller, ''Römische Mythologie'', p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sentinus''' or '''Sentia''' gives [[sentience]] or the powers of sense perception ''(sensus)''.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 7.3.1; Rüpke, ''Religion in Republican Rome,'' p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine calls him the ''sensificator,'' "creator of sentience."&lt;ref&gt;Augustine's point is that a monotheistic concept of deity obviates the need for dispersing these functions and for a divine taxonomy that is based on knowledge rather than faith. One view of the success of Christianity is that it was simple to understand and required a less complex theology; see Preller, ''Römische Mythologie'', p. 208, and Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), pp. 84–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Parcae===
The '''[[Parcae]]''' are the three goddesses of fate ''(tria fata)'': '''[[Nona (mythology)|Nona]]''', '''[[Decima (mythology)|Decima]]''', and '''Parca''' (singular of ''Parcae''), also known as '''Partula''' in relation to birthing. Nona and Decima determine the right time for birth, assuring the completion of the nine-month term (ten in Roman [[inclusive counting]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''De anima'' 37.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Parca or Partula oversees ''partus'', birth as the initial separation from the mother's body (as in English '"[[postpartum]]").&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], as preserved by [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Attic Nights'' 3.16.9–10; Rüpke, ''Religion in Republican Rome,'' p. 181.&lt;!--Tertullian ''Deuteronomy Carne Christi'', chaps. 37, 39. "Partula adjusted every thing relative to the labour".--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the very moment of birth, or immediately after, Parca establishes that the new life will have a limit, and therefore she is also a goddess of death called Morta (English "mortal").&lt;ref&gt;S. Breemer and [[J. H. Waszink]], "Fata Scribunda," in ''Opuscula Selecta'' (Brill, 1979), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''profatio Parcae'', "prophecy of Parca," marked the child as a mortal being, and was not a pronouncement of individual destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Breemer and Waszink, "Fata Scribunda," p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; The first week of the child's life was regarded as an extremely perilous and tentative time, and the child was not recognized as an individual until the ''dies lustricus'' (see [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities#Dies lustricus|below]]).

==Birthing==
The primary deity presiding over the delivery was [[Lucina (goddess)|Juno Lucina]], who may in fact be a form of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. Those invoking her aid let their hair down and loosened their clothing as a form of reverse [[defixio|binding ritual]] intended to facilitate labor.&lt;ref&gt;Corbeill, ''Nature Embodied,'' p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Soranus advised women about to give birth to unbind their hair and loosen clothing to promote relaxation, not for any magical effect.&lt;ref&gt;Corbeill, ''Nature Embodied,'' p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bébé Ex-voto gallo-romain Musée Saint-Remi 120208.jpg|thumb|left|[[swaddling|Swaddled]] infant ([[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] terracotta [[votum|votive]])]]

* '''[[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]]''', the nymph, received sacrifices from pregnant women in order to bring out ''(egerere)'' the baby.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] p. 67 (edition of Lindsay): ''Egeriae nymphae sacrificabant praegnantes, quod eam putabant facile conceptum alvo egere''; Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome,'' p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Into the light===
[[File:Deesse mere MAN St Germain.jpg|thumb|upright|A goddess suckling a toddler and seated in the wicker chair characteristic of [[Gallo-Roman religion|Gallo-Roman goddesses]] (2nd or 3rd century, Bordeaux)]]

''Lucina'' as a title of the birth goddess is usually seen as a metaphor for bringing the newborn into the light ''(lux, lucis)''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]] provides an alternate derivation as the "goddess of the grove" ''([[lucus]])'', but in ancient etymology the word ''lucus'' itself was thought to derive from ''luc-'', "light": the ''lucus'' as a "sacred grove" was actually the creation of a clearing (i.e., the letting in of light) within a grove to make a sacred place. The sacred grove of Lucina was located on the [[Esquiline Hill]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Luces'', plural ("lights"), can mean "periods of light, daylight hours, days."  ''Diespiter'', "Father of Day," is thus her masculine counterpart; if his name is taken as a doublet for Jupiter, then Juno Lucina and Diespiter can be understood as a male-female complement.&lt;ref&gt;Celia E. Schultz, ''Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2006), pp. 79–81; Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;

Diespiter, however, is also identified in Latin literature with the ruler of the underworld, [[Dis pater]]. The functions of "[[chthonic]]" deities such as Dis (or [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]) and his consort [[Proserpina]] are not confined to death; they are often concerned with agricultural fertility and the giving of nourishment for life, since plants for food grow from seeds hidden in the ground. In the [[mystery religions]], the divine couple preside over the soul's "birth" or rebirth in the afterlife. The shadowy goddess [[Mana Genita]] was likewise concerned with both birth and mortality, particularly of infants, as was [[Hecate]].&lt;ref&gt;[[H.J. Rose]], ''The Roman Questions of Plutarch'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924, 1974), p. 192; David and Noelle Soren, ''A Roman Villa and a Late Roman Infant Cemetery'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 1999), p. 520.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast to the vast majority of deities, both birth goddesses and underworld deities received sacrifices at night.&lt;ref&gt;Lipka, ''Roman Gods,'' p. 154, especially note 22. The animal sacrifices offered to most deities are domestic herd animals normally raised for food; the deity honored is given a portion, and the rest of the roasted flesh is shared by humans in a communal meal. Both birth goddesses and chthonic deities, however, typically receive an inedible victim, often puppies or bitches, in the form of a [[holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust]] or burnt offering, with no shared meal.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient writers conventionally situate labor and birth at night; it may be that night is thought of as the darkness of the womb, from which the newborn emerges into the (day)light.

The cyclical place of the goddess '''Candelifera''', "She who bears the candle,"&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''Ad nationes'' 2.11: ''&lt;/ref&gt; is uncertain. It is sometimes thought that she provides an artificial light for labor that occurs at night. A long labor was considered likely for first-time mothers, so at least a part of the birthing process would occur at night.&lt;ref&gt;The passage in Tertullian has a problematic point that may specify first births; [[Marie-Louis-Antoine-Gaston Boissier|Gaston Boissier]], ''Étude sur la vie et les ouvrages de M.T. Varron'' (Hachette, 1861), pp. 234–235.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Plutarch]],&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Roman Questions'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/A.html#2 2.]&lt;/ref&gt; light symbolizes birth, but the candle may have been thought of as less a symbol than an actual kindling of life,&lt;ref&gt;[[H.J. Rose]], ''The Roman Questions of Plutarch'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924, 1974), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; or a magic equivalent to the life of the infant.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Edward Burriss, ''Taboo, Magic, Spirits: A Study of Primitive Elements in Roman Religion'' (1931; Forgotten Books reprint, 2007), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Candelifera may also be the nursery light kept burning against spirits of darkness that would threaten the infant in the coming week.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''The Roman Questions of Plutarch'', pp. 79, 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the Christian era, lamps were lit in nurseries to illuminate sacred images and drive away child-snatching demons such as the [[Gello]].&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Leo Allatios]], ''De Graecorum hodie quorundam opinationibus'' IV (1645), p. 188 as cited by Karen Hartnup, ''On the Beliefs of the Greeks: Leo Allatios and Popular Orthodoxy'' (Brill, 2004), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neonatal care==
Once the child came into the light, a number of rituals were enacted over the course of the following week.&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, ''Religion in Republican Rome,'' p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; An offerings table received congratulatory sacrifices from the mother's female friends.&lt;ref&gt;Nonius, p. 312, 11–13, as cited by Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome,'' p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Three deities—Intercidona, Pilumnus, and Deverra—were invoked to drive away [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]], the wild woodland god of trees:&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 6.9.2.&lt;/ref&gt; three men secured the household every night by striking the threshold ''(limen''; see [[liminality]]) with an axe and then a pestle, followed by sweeping it.

[[File:Uni et hercle.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing of a scene on an Etruscan mirror, in which Uni (Juno) suckles the adult Hercle (Hercules) before he ascends to immortality]]
In the atrium of the house, a bed was made up for Juno, and a table set for [[Hercules]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius Danielis]], note to ''Eclogue'' 4.62 and ''[[Aeneid]]'' 10.76.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[classical mythology|Hellenized mythological tradition]], Juno tried to prevent the birth of Hercules, as it resulted from Jupiter's infidelity. [[Ovid]] has Lucina crossing her knees and fingers to bind the labor.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 9.298–299; Corbeill, ''Nature Embodied,'' pp. 37, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Etruscan religion]], however, emphasized the role that Juno (as [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]]) played in endowing [[Hercle]] with his divine nature through the drinking of her breast milk.

* '''Intercidona''' provides the axe without which trees cannot be cut ''(intercidere)''.
* '''[[Pilumnus]]''' or '''[[Picumnus]]''' grants the pestle necessary for making flour from grain.
* '''[[Deverra]]''' gives the broom with which grain was swept up ''(verrere)'' (compare [[Averruncus]]).
* '''Juno''' in her bed represents the nursing mother.&lt;ref&gt;Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome,'' p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Hercules''' represents the child who requires feeding.
* '''[[Rumina]]''' promotes suckling.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 4.11, 21, 34; 7.11.&lt;/ref&gt; This goddess received [[libation]]s of milk, an uncommon liquid offering among the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Romulus'' 4.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dies lustricus''===
'''[[Nundina]]''' presides over the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies lustricus|dies lustricus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.16.36.&lt;/ref&gt; the purification day when the child was given a name ''([[praenomen]])''. This occurred on the eighth day for girls and the ninth day for boys,&lt;!--At this time also the two '''Carmentes'''&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 4.11.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Antevorta]] and [[Postverta]]), had something to do with fates as well.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''De anima'' 39.2.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; a difference [[Plutarch]] explains by noting that "it is a fact that the female grows up, and attains maturity and perfection before the male."&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Roman Questions'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/E.html#ref233 102.]&lt;/ref&gt; Until the umbilical cord fell off, typically on the seventh day, the baby was regarded as "more like a plant than an animal," as Plutarch expresses it.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Attic Nights'' 16.16, citing Varro in saying that in the womb children are more like trees than a human being.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony of the ''dies lustricus'' was thus postponed until the last tangible connection to the mother's body was dissolved, and the child was seen "as no longer forming part of the mother, and in this way as possessing an independent existence which justified its receiving a name of its own and therefore a fate of its own."&lt;ref&gt;Breemer and Waszink, "Fata Scribunda," p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The day was celebrated with a family feast.&lt;ref&gt;Breemer and Waszink, "Fata Scribunda," p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the ''dies lustricus'', the '''Fata Scribunda''' were invoked.&lt;ref&gt;Breemer and Waszink, "Fata Scribunda," p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Written Fates" probably refers to a ceremonial writing down of the child's new name, perhaps in a family chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;Breemer and Waszink, "Fata Scribunda," p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; To the Romans, the giving of a name was as important as being born. The receiving of a ''praenomen'' inaugurated the child as an individual with its own fate.&lt;ref&gt;Breemer and Waszink, "Fata Scribunda," pp. 245, 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child development==
In [[domus|well-to-do households]], children were cared for by nursemaids (''nutrices'', singular ''nutrix'', which can mean either a [[wet nurse]] who might be a slave or a paid professional of free status, or more generally any [[nursemaid|nursery maid]], who would be a household slave). Mothers with a nursery staff were still expected to supervise the quality of care, education, and emotional wellbeing of children. Ideally, fathers would take an interest even in their infant children; [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] liked to be present when his wife bathed and [[swaddling|swaddled]] their child.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Cato the Elder'' 20.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Nursemaids might make their own bloodless offerings to deities who protected and fostered the growth of children.&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''Logistorici'' frg. 9 (Bolisani), as cited by Lora L. Holland, "Women and Roman Religion," in ''A Companion to Women in the Ancient World'' (Blackwell, 2012), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the "teaching gods" are female, perhaps because they themselves were thought of as divine nursemaids. The gods who encourage speech, however, are male.&lt;ref&gt;Preller, ''Römische Mythologie'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to speak well was a defining characteristic of the elite citizen. Although women were admired for speaking persuasively,&lt;ref&gt;For example, according to [[Roman mythology|Roman tradition]] the speech made by [[Lucretia]] in response to her rape sparked the overthrow of [[Roman Kingdom|the monarchy]] and the establishment of the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman oratory|oratory]] was regarded as a masculine pursuit essential to public life.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Farrell, ''Latin Language and Latin Culture'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), pp. 74–75; Richard A. Bauman, ''Women and Politics in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 1992, 1994), pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tête d'enfant d'époque Antonine profil.JPG|thumb|Head of a child from the [[Antonine era]]|alt=]]

* '''Potina''' ('''Potica''' or '''Potua''') from the noun ''potio'' "drink" ('''Bibesia''' in some source editions, cf verb ''bibo'', ''bibere'' "drink") enables the child to drink.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 4.11, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Edusa''', from the verb ''edo, edere, esus'', "eat," also as '''Edulia''', '''Edula''', '''Educa''', '''Edesia''' etc.,  enables the taking of nourishment.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De civitate Dei'' 4.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The variations of her name may indicate that while her functional focus was narrow, her name had not stabilized; she was mainly a divine force to be invoked ''ad hoc'' for a specific purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), pp. 126–127.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ossipago''' builds strong bones;&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius, ''Adversus Nationes'' 4.7–8: ''Ossipago quae durat et solidat infantibus parvis ossa.'' Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; probably a title of Juno, from ''ossa'', "bones," + ''pango, pangere'', "insert, fix, set." Alternative [[textual criticism|readings of the text]] include Ossipagina, Ossilago, Opigena, Ossipanga, Ossipango, and Ossipaga.&lt;ref&gt;George Englert McCracken, commentary on Arnobius's ''The Case Against the Pagans'' (Paulist Press, 1949), p. 364; [[Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher|W.H. Roscher]], ''Ausführliches Lexikon der griechischen und römischen Mythologie'' (Leipzig: Teubner, 1890–94), vol. 2, pt. 1, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Cardea|Carna]]''' makes strong muscles, and defends the internal organs from witches or ''strigae''.
* '''Cunina''' protects the cradle from malevolent magic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lactantius]], ''Divine Institutes'' 1.20.36.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cuba''' helps the child transition from cradle to a bed.
* '''Paventia''' or '''Paventina''' averts fear ''(pavor)'' from the child.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Ad nationes'' 2.11; [[Augustine of Hippo]], ''De civitate Dei'' 4.11; [[Gerardus Vossius]], ''De physiologia Christiana et theologia gentili'' 8.6: ''Paventia ab infantibus avertebat pavorem'', 7.5; Lipka, ''Roman Gods'', p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Peta''' sees to its "first wants."&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnobius]] 4.7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Agenoria (goddess)|Agenoria]]''' endows the child with a capacity to lead an active life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine of Hippo]], ''[[De Civitate Dei]]'' 4.11; Christian Laes, ''Children in the Roman Empire: Outsiders Within'' (Cambridge University Press, 2011, originally published 2006 in Dutch), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Adeona''' and '''Abeona''' monitor the child's comings and goings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofgo00jord|title=Encyclopedia of gods : over 2,500 deities of the world|last=Jordan|first=Michael|date=1993|publisher=New York : Facts on File|others=Internet Archive|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Interduca''' and '''[[Domiduca]]''' accompany it leaving the house and coming home again.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 4.21; Tertullian, ''Ad nationes'' 2.11.9.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Young man Garde-Meuble Louvre Br625.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|Roman boy wrapped in his cloak (1st century AD)]]
* '''Catius pater''', "Father Catius," is invoked for sharpening the minds of children as they develop intellectually.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 4.21: Father Catius, "who makes [children] clever, that is, sharp-witted" ''(qui catos id est acutos faceret)''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Farinus''' enables speech.
* '''Fabulinus''' prompts the child's first words.
* '''Locutius''' enables it to form sentences.
* '''[[Mens]]''' ("Mind") provides it with intelligence.
* '''Volumnus''' or '''Volumna''' grants the child the will to do good.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 4.21.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Numeria''' gives the child the ability to count.
* '''[[Camenae|Camena]]''' enables it to sing.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 4.11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''[[Muses]]''' give the ability to appreciate the arts, literature, and science.&lt;ref&gt;Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome,'' p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Children wore the ''[[toga praetexta]]'', with a purple band that marked them as sacred and inviolable, and an amulet ''([[bulla (amulet)|bulla]]'') to ward off malevolence.

==Later literature==
[[James Joyce]] mentions a few Roman birth deities by name in his works. In the "Oxen of the Sun" episode of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', he combines an allusion to [[Horace]] ''([[nunc est bibendum]])'' with an invocation of Partula and Pertunda ''(per deam Partulam et Pertundam)'' in anticipation of the birth of Purefoy. Cunina, Statulina, and Edulia are mentioned in ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Schork, ''Latin and Roman Culture in Joyce'' (University Press of Florida, 1997), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahāsthāmaprāpta''' is a [[bodhisattva]] [[mahāsattva]] that represents the power of wisdom, often depicted in a trinity with [[Amitābha]] and [[Avalokiteśvara]] ([[Guanyin]]), especially in [[Pure Land Buddhism]]. His name literally means "arrival of the great strength".

Mahāsthāmaprāpta is one of the Eight Great Bodhisattvas in [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], along with [[Mañjuśrī]], [[Samantabhadra]], [[Avalokiteśvara]], [[Ākāśagarbha]], [[Kṣitigarbha]], [[Maitreya]] and [[Sarvanivarana-Vishkambhin]].

In [[Chinese Buddhism]], he is usually portrayed as a woman, with a likeness similar to Avalokiteśvara. He is also one of the Japanese [[Thirteen Buddhas]] in [[Shingon Buddhism]]. In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], Mahāsthāmaprāpta is equated with [[Vajrapani]], who is one of his incarnations and was known as the Protector of [[Gautama Buddha]]. 

Mahāsthāmaprāpta is one of the oldest bodhisattvas and is regarded as powerful, especially in the Pure Land school, where he takes an important role in the long ''[[Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra]]''. He is also associated with the temple guardians [[Kongo Rikishi]] across Japan. 

In the ''[[Śūraṅgama Sūtra]]'', Mahāsthāmaprāpta tells of how he gained enlightenment through the practice of [[nianfo]], or continuous pure mindfulness of Amitābha, to obtain [[samādhi]]. In the ''[[Amitayurdhyana Sutra]]'', Mahāsthāmaprāpta is symbolised by the moon while Avalokiteśvara is represented by the sun.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Metaphorical manifestation==
Monk Yìnguāng ({{zh|c=印光}}), a teacher of [[Pure Land Buddhism]], was widely considered to be a metaphorical manifestation of Mahāsthāmaprāpta after two people: 1. a Christian who had never heard of him before; and 2. a Chinese student of Monk Yinguang--both dreamed of that independently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sisisi.org/wendang/qsjt/3043.html 净土的见证(一）] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104152803/http://www.sisisi.org/wendang/qsjt/3043.html |date=2015-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fo.sina.com.cn/o/2013-08-16/132312412.shtml 共尊印光大师势至化身原因一_新浪佛学_新浪网]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rufodao.qq.com/a/20130822/011169.htm 印祖的故事-海天佛国奇缘]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Melampus''' {{IPAc-en|m|ᵻ|ˈ|l|æ|m|p|ə|s}} ({{lang-grc|Μελάμπους}}, ''Melampous''),&lt;ref&gt;The name, if it is significant, signifies "black foot".&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[legend]]ary [[oracle|soothsayer]] and [[Physician|healer]], originally of [[Pylos]], who ruled at [[Argos]].  He was the introducer of the worship of [[Dionysus]], according to [[Herodotus]], who asserted that his powers as a seer were derived from the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' 2.49.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he could understand the language of animals.  A number of [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphal]] works of [[divination]] were circulated in Classical and Hellenistic times under the name Melampus.  According to Herodotus and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (vi.17.6), on the authority of [[Hesiod]], his father was [[Amythaon]], whose name implies the "ineffable" or "unspeakably great";&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]], ''The Greek Myths'' 1955, s.v. "Amythaon".&lt;/ref&gt; thus Melampus and his heirs were ''Amythaides'' of the "House of Amythaon".

==Homer==
In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'', XI.223-42.&lt;/ref&gt; a digression concerning the lineage of [[Theoclymenus]], "a prophet, sprung from Melampus' line of seers",&lt;ref&gt;Quotes are from [[Robert Fagles]]'s translation, 1996:326-27.&lt;/ref&gt; sketches the epic narrative concerning Melampus with such brevity that its details must have been familiar to Homer's audience.  With brief hints, a sequence of episodes is alluded to, in which we discern strife in Pylos between Melampus and [[Neleus]], who usurps Melampus's "great high house", forcing him into heroic exile.  Melampus spends a year as bondsman in the house of [[Phylacus]], "all for Neleus' daughter [[Pero]]".  At his extremity, Melampus is visited by "the mad spell a [[Erinyes|Fury]], murderous spirit, cast upon his mind.  But the seer worked free of death" and succeeded at last in rustling Phylacus's cattle back to Pylos, where he avenged himself on Neleus and gave Pero in marriage to his brother [[Bias (mythology)|Bias]].  But Melampus's own destiny lay in [[Argos]], where he lived and ruled, married and sired a long line, also briefly sketched in Homer's excursus.

==Later myths==
At a later date the narrative was embellished with anecdotal detail: Melampus lived in Pylos during the reign of [[Anaxagoras (mythology)|Anaxagoras]] or possibly [[Proetus]]. The king offered a reward for anybody that could heal his son, who suffered from a strange malady. Melampus killed an ox and talked to the [[vulture]]s that came to eat the corpse. They said that the last time they had had such a feast was when the king had made a sacrifice. They told Melampus that the prince had been frightened of the big, bloody knife and the king tossed it aside to calm the child. It had hit a tree and injured a [[hamadryad]], who cursed the prince with the sickness. The hamadryad told Melampus that the boy would be healed if the knife was taken out of the trunk of the tree and boiled, then the prince should drink the rusty water that resulted. Melampus followed her directions and, as payment for the cure, demanded two thirds of the [[monarchy|kingdom]] for himself, and one third for his brother, [[Bias (mythology)|Bias]]. The king agreed.

In another version of Melampus' story, when the women of [[Argos]] were driven mad by [[Dionysus]], in the reign of [[Anaxagoras (mythology)|Anaxagoras]] or possibly [[Proetus]], Melampus was brought in to cure them, but demanded a third of the kingdom as payment. The king refused, but the women became wilder than ever, and he was forced to seek out Melampus again, who this time demanded both a third for himself and another third for his brother Bias. The king felt he had no choice but to agree, and so Melampus led them to the city of [[Lusi, Greece|Lusi]] where they were healed of their madness in a sanctuary of [[Artemis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+8.18.2 Pausanias, Description of Greece&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Melampus' reputation as a seer spawned myths that verge on anecdote, to account for his gift, the offering of [[Serpent (mythology)|serpents]]. In one, as a young boy, he told his [[servant (domestic)|servant]]s not to kill two [[snake]]s. Grateful, the snakes gave Melampus the ability to speak with animals.

Another version says that he found a mother snake that had been crushed under a cart and two orphaned babies. Rather than leaving them he gave the snake a burial and raised the young ones. To thank him they licked his ears so clean that he was able to understand animals.

After this there were three kings ruling Argos at any time, one descended from each of Bias, Melampus, and Anaxagoras. Melampus was succeeded by his son [[Mantius]],&lt;ref&gt;The other son, according to Homer,  was Antiphates, whose grandson, the prescient [[Amphiaraus]], was caught up in the episode of the [[Seven against Thebes]].&lt;/ref&gt; and his house of Melampus lasted down to the brothers [[Alcmaeon (mythology)|Alcmaeon]] and [[Amphilochus (brother of Alcmaeon)|Amphilochus]], who fought in the [[Trojan War]].

Late in his life, Melampus was [[kidnap]]ped. In his cell, he overheard two [[termite]]s talking, claiming they would be finished eating through Melampus' [[ceiling]] the next morning. Melampus called his captors and demanded a move. He made such an uproar that the kidnappers agreed. When the ceiling collapsed the next morning, the kidnappers decided he was a [[prophet]] and that to hold on to him might offend the gods. They let him go.

Melampus also figures in the tale of King [[Midas]], the pleasure-loving King of [[Phrygia]]. He was chosen to be a judge between the famous musical contest between Apollo and Marsyas. Although Apollo clearly had won, he disagreed with the other judges. Apollo called the King an ass, and to prove his point he touched him on the head and gave Midas the ears of a donkey. Long and hairy they sprouted up, and Midas in a panic covered them up with a tall Phrygian cap, hoping nobody ever discovered his embarrassing secret.
Only his barber knew of this disgraceful matter, but Midas had warned him that he would be put to death if ever he revealed to anyone the asinine state of the King's ears. The barber found himself bursting with the secret and couldn't bear to keep the gossip to himself, but was afraid for his life. So he dug a hole in the bank of the Pactolus river and, after making certain that nobody was listening, he whispered into the hole that "King Midas has ass's ears." Filling up the hole to forever bury the secret, the barber went away happy and at peace with himself.

All was well until the next spring, when a reed sprouted up from the hole and whispered to the other reeds that King Midas had the ears of a donkey. These reeds in turn whispered the secret to all creatures who passed. Soon the birds learned the news and brought it to Melampus. Melampus told all his friends and soon the entire kingdom knew about King Midas' miserable secret.

==Melampus' alleged writings==
Three works have survived under the name "Melampus." 
* ''Peri Palmon Mantike'', an extended treatise on divination by [[muscle contraction|twitch]]es ([[palomancy]]), existing in a number of versions; 
* ''Peri Elaion tou somatos'', a short work on divination by [[mole (skin marking)|moles]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isidore-of-seville.com/astdiv/melampus.html Translation]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402041315/http://www.isidore-of-seville.com/astdiv/melampus.html |date=2003-04-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* An [[astrology|astrological]] [[lunarium]]. The twitch text begins with a [[dedication]] to a king Ptolemy, probably [[Ptolemy Philadelphus]], which is also probably [[wikt:spurious|spurious]].
 
A certain Melampus wrote a treatise on the laws of symmetry prior to the first century BC. ([[Vitruvius]] VII, introduction). This treatise is lost.

==''Melampodia''==
A work attributed in Antiquity to [[Hesiod]] exists in such fragmentary quotations and chance remarks that its reconstruction, according to [[Walter Burkert]],&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Homo Necans'', tr. by Peter Bing, 1983:170 note 12&lt;/ref&gt; is "most uncertain." An attempt was made by I Löffler, ''Die Melampodie: Versuch einer Rekonstruction des Inhalts'' (1963).

In [[American folklore|West Virginia folklore]], the '''Mothman''' is a creature reportedly seen in the [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia|Point Pleasant]] area from November 12, 1966, to December 15, 1967. The first newspaper report was published in the ''Point Pleasant Register'' dated November 16, 1966, titled "Couples See Man-Sized Bird ... Creature ... Something".&lt;ref name=WestVa.net&gt;{{cite web|title=Couples See Man-Sized Bird...Creature...Something|url=http://www.westva.net/mothman/1966-11-16.htm|work=Point Pleasant Register Point Pleasant, WV Wednesday, November 16, 1966|publisher=WestVA.Net, Mark Turner|accessdate=27 January 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011230219/http://www.westva.net/mothman/1966-11-16.htm|archivedate=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national press soon picked up the reports and helped spread the story across the United States. 

The Mothman was introduced to a wider audience by [[Gray Barker]] in 1970&lt;ref&gt;''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', Volume 33 (Pennsylvania State University, Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal., 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray Barker, ''The Silver Bridge'' (Saucerian Books, 1970). Reprinted in 2008 entitled ''The Silver Bridge: The Classic Mothman Tale'' (BookSurge Publishing). {{ISBN|1-4392-0427-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later popularized by [[John Keel]] in his 1975 book ''[[The Mothman Prophecies]]'', claiming that there were [[supernatural]] events related to the sightings, and a connection to the collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]].

The Mothman appears in popular culture. The 2002 film ''[[The Mothman Prophecies (film)|The Mothman Prophecies]]'', starring [[Richard Gere]], was based on Keel's book.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Meehan, ''Cinema of the Psychic Realm: A Critical Survey'', page 130 (McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., 2009). {{ISBN|978-0-7864-3966-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An annual festival in Point Pleasant is devoted to the Mothman legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mothmanfestival.com|title=Mothman Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On November 12, 1966, five men who were digging a grave at a cemetery near [[Clendenin, West Virginia]], claimed to see a man-like figure fly low from the trees over their heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvcommerce.org/news/story/First-sighting-of-the-Mothman/1215/default.aspx |title=First sighting of the Mothman |publisher=Wvcommerce.org |date=1966-11-12 |accessdate=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often identified as the first known sighting of what became known as the Mothman.

Shortly thereafter, on November 15, 1966, two young couples from Point Pleasant, Roger and Linda Scarberry and Steve and Mary Mallette, told police they saw a large grey creature whose eyes "glowed red" when the car's headlights picked it up. They described it as a "large flying man with ten-foot wings", following their car while they were driving in an area outside of town known as "the [[McClintic Wildlife Management Area|TNT area]]", the site of a former [[World War II]] munitions plant.&lt;ref name="Nickell2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsaz.com/news/headlines/93914124.html|title=UPDATE: Munitions Risk Closes Part of Wildlife Area Again|accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
During the next few days, other people reported similar sightings. 
Two volunteer firemen who saw it said it was a "large bird with red eyes". Mason County Sheriff George Johnson commented that he believed the sightings were due to an unusually large [[heron]] he termed a "shitepoke". Contractor Newell Partridge told Johnson that when he aimed a flashlight at a creature in a nearby field its eyes glowed "like bicycle reflectors", and blamed buzzing noises from his television set and the disappearance of his German Shepherd dog on the creature.&lt;ref name="Gettysburg Times" /&gt; Wildlife biologist Dr. Robert L. Smith at [[West Virginia University]] told reporters that descriptions and sightings all fit the [[sandhill crane]], a large American crane almost as high as a man with a seven-foot wingspan featuring circles of reddish coloring around the eyes, and that the bird may have wandered out of its migration route. This particular crane was unrecognized at first because it was not native to this region.&lt;ref name="Gettysburg Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt;

After the December 15, 1967, collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]] and the death of 46 people,&lt;ref name=WVHS&gt;{{cite web|last1=LeRose|first1=Chris|title=The Collapse of the Silver Bridge|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/wvhs/wvhs1504.html|website=West Virginia Historical Society Quarterly|publisher=West Virginia Division of Culture and History|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the incident gave rise to the legend and connected the Mothman sightings to the bridge collapse.&lt;ref name="Gettysburg Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Monster Bird With Red Eyes May Be Crane|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LG0mAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Rf8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=620,2790721&amp;dq=point+pleasant+roger+scarberry&amp;hl=en|accessdate=21 August 2011|newspaper=Gettysburg Times|date=Dec 1, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Mothman' still a frighteningly big draw for tourists|url=https://www.thestar.com/Travel/article/294673|accessdate=21 August 2011|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=Jan 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UPI&gt;{{cite news|last=UPI|title=Eight People Say They Saw 'Creature'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XyNEAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_7AMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=959,3488207&amp;dq=newell-partridge&amp;hl=en|accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=Williamson (WV) Daily News|date=Nov 18, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[WCHS-TV]] published a photo purported to be of Mothman taken by an anonymous man while driving on [[West Virginia Route 2|Route 2]].&lt;ref name="WCHS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pierson|first1=Fallon|title=Man photographs creature that resembles legendary ''Mothman" of Point Pleasant|url=http://wchstv.com/news/local/man-photographs-creature-that-resembles-legendary-mothman-of-point-pleasant|website=[[WCHS-TV]] news|publisher=WCHS|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science writer [[Sharon A.

==Analysis==
[[Folklore|Folklorist]] [[Jan Harold Brunvand]] notes that Mothman has been widely covered in the popular press, some claiming sightings connected with UFOs, and others claiming that a military storage site was Mothman's "home". Brunvand notes that recountings of the 1966-67 Mothman reports usually state that at least 100 people saw Mothman with many more "afraid to report their sightings" but observed that written sources for such stories consisted of children's books or sensationalized or undocumented accounts that fail to quote identifiable persons. Brunvand found elements in common among many Mothman reports and much older folk tales, suggesting that something real may have triggered the scares and became woven with existing folklore. He also records anecdotal tales of Mothman supposedly attacking the roofs of parked cars inhabited by teenagers.&lt;ref name="Brunvand1994"&gt;{{cite book|author-first=Jan Harold|author-last=Brunvand|authorlink=Jan Harold Brunvand|title=The Baby Train and Other Lusty Urban Legends|date=1 October 1994|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-31208-9|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[Joe Nickell]] says that a number of hoaxes followed the publicity generated by the original reports, such as a group of construction workers who tied flashlights to helium balloons. Nickell attributes the Mothman reports to pranks, misidentified planes, and sightings of a [[barred owl]], an [[Plumage#Albinism|albino owl]], suggesting that the Mothman's "glowing eyes" were actually [[red-eye effect]] caused from the reflection of light from flashlights or other bright light sources.&lt;ref name="AudubonOwlNickell"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Elbein |first1=Asher |title=Is the Mothman of West Virginia an Owl? |url=https://www.audubon.org/news/is-mothman-west-virginia-owl |website=Audubon.org |accessdate=30 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027003431/https://www.audubon.org/news/is-mothman-west-virginia-owl |archivedate=27 October 2018 |date=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area lies outside the snowy owl's usual range.&lt;ref name="Nickell2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joe Nickell|title=The Mystery Chronicles: More Real-Life X-Files|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sComGoDFJZ4C&amp;pg=PA93|accessdate=21 August 2011|date=April 2004|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2318-9|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[University of Chicago]] psychologist David A. Gallo, 55 sightings of Mothman in Chicago during 2017 published on the website of self-described Fortean researcher Lon Strickler are “a selective sample". Gallo explains that "he's not sampling random people and asking if they saw the Mothman — he's just counting the number of people that voluntarily came forward to report a sighting”. According to Gallo, "people more likely to visit a paranormal-centric website like Strickler’s might also be more inclined to believe in, and therefore witness the existence of, a “Mothman”".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/paqv9z/mothman-sightings-in-chicago|title=People Keep Seeing the Mothman in Chicago|website=Vice|date=2018-01-17|first=Josh|last=Terry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[pseudoscience]] adherents (such as [[UFOlogy|ufologists]], [[paranormal]] authors, and [[cryptozoology|cryptozoologists]]) claim that Mothman was an [[alien (extraterrestrial)|alien]], a supernatural manifestation, or a previously unknown species of animal. In his 1975 book ''The Mothman Prophecies'', author John Keel claimed that the Point Pleasant residents experienced [[precognition]]s including premonitions of the collapse of the Silver Bridge, [[unidentified flying object]] sightings, visits from inhuman or threatening [[men in black]], and other phenomena.&lt;ref name="Clark2000"&gt;[[Jerome Clark|Clark, Jerome]] (2000).

==Festivals and statue==
Point Pleasant held its first Annual Mothman Festival in 2002 and a 12-foot-tall metallic statue of the creature, created by artist and sculptor Bob Roach, was unveiled in 2003. The Mothman Museum and Research Center opened in 2005 and is run by Jeff Wamsley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/12036 Mothman Statue]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Moran, Mark Sceurman, Matt Lake, ''Weird U.

The '''Nishanvali/Nishanvala Misl''' was founded by the sardar jai singh ji and its founder was [[jai singh ji]].


The Nishanavali misl, kept as a reserve force at Amritsar, used to act as standard-bearers of the Khalsa army "Dal Khalsa". Hence the name (Nishan = flag or standard; vali/vala= owning or unfurling) means this misl carry the Nishan Sahib, the Sikh Flag in the battle. 
[[This misl has two 12 feet long Naishan sabih which they used to carry wars]] the flags are still there but they have been kept by family there of this misl 
This Sikh Misl had a strength of 2000 regular horsemen and covered the areas of [[Rupnagar district|Roopnagar]], [[Ambala]] and [[Shahabad Markanda|Shahbad Markanda.]]

In [[Mormonism]], a '''penalty''' was an [[oath]] made by participants of the original [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Nauvoo Endowment]] instituted by [[Joseph Smith]] in 1843 and further developed by [[Brigham Young]] after Smith's death. Mormon critics refer to the penalty as a "blood oath", because it required the participant to swear never to reveal certain key symbols of the endowment ceremony, including the penalty itself, while symbolically enacting ways in which a person may be executed. The penalties were similar to oaths made as part of a particular rite of [[Freemasonry]] practiced in western New York at the time the endowment was developed.

During the 20th century, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) gradually softened the graphic nature of the penalties, and in 1990 removed them altogether from their version of the ceremony.

==Original oaths==
On May 4, 1842, [[Joseph Smith]] instituted the endowment ritual in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]]. At three different stages of the endowment, participants were asked to take an oath of secrecy regarding the gestures of the ceremony {{Harv|Kearns|1906|p=8}}. The participants promised that if they were ever to reveal the gestures of the ceremony, would be subject to the following:

*Stage 1 : "my throat ... be cut from ear to ear, and my tongue torn out by its roots;"
*Stage 2 : "our breasts ... be torn open, our hearts and vitals torn out and given to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field;"
*Stage 3 : "our body ... be cut asunder and all your bowels gush out."

Each of the penalties was accompanied by gestures known as the "'''execution of the penalty'''" which simulated the actions described in the oath {{Harv|Kearns|1906|p=8}}. 
*Stage 1: The participant placed his or her right hand palm-down with the thumb extended and the tip of the thumb just under the left ear. The execution of the gesture was made by drawing the tip of the thumb swiftly across the throat until the thumb was just under the right ear, then dropping the hand and arm quickly to the side of the participant's body.
*Stage 2: The participant placed his or her hand in a cup form over the left breast. The execution of the gesture was made by pulling the hand-cup swiftly across the breast, then quickly dropping the hand and arm to the side of the participant's body.
*Stage 3: The participant placed his or her right hand palm-down with the thumb extended and the tip of the thumb on the left of the torso, just above the left hip. The execution of the gesture was made by drawing the thumb swiftly across the stomach until the thumb was just above the right hip, and the hand and arm were quickly dropped to the side of the participant's body.

The oaths and their accompanying gestures resembled certain oaths performed in a particular Freemasonry tradition in western New York at the time, in which participants promised:
*Oath of an "Entered Apprentice Mason": "I will … never reveal any part or parts, art or arts, point or points of the secret arts and mysteries of ancient Freemasonry. . . binding myself under no less penalty than to have my throat cut across, my tongue torn out by the roots" {{Harv|Morgan|1827|pp=21–22}}.  "This is given by drawing your right hand across your throat, the thumb next to your throat." {{Harv|Morgan|1827|p=23}}.
*Oath of a "Fellow Craft Mason": "I … most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, that I will not give the degree of a Fellow Craft Mason to any one of an inferior degree, nor to any other being in the known world, … binding myself under no less penalty than to have my left breast torn open and my heart and vitals taken from thence … to become a prey to the wild beasts of the field, and vulture of the air" {{Harv|Morgan|1827|p=52}}. "The sign is given by drawing your right hand-flat, with the palm of it next to your breast, across your breast from the left to the right side with some quickness, and dropping it down by your side" {{Harv|Morgan|1827|p=53}}.  
*Oath of a "Master Mason": "I … most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, in addition to my former obligations, that I will not give the degree of a Master Mason to any of an inferior degree, nor to any other being in the known world, … binding myself under no less penalty than to have my body severed in two in the midst, and divided to the north and south, my bowels burnt to ashes" {{Harv|Morgan|1827|pp=73–75}}.  "The Penal Sign is given by putting the right hand to the left side of the bowels, the hand open, with the thumb next to the belly, and drawing it across the belly, and letting it fall; this is done tolerably quick. This alludes to the penalty of the obligation: 'Having my body severed in twain,' etc." {{Harv|Morgan|1827|p=77}}.

==Changes==
Beginning in 1919, [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Heber J. Grant]] appointed a committee charged with revising the endowment ceremony, which was done under the direction of [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[George F. Richards]] from 1921 to 1927. Among the changes that were instituted was a modification of the oaths. While the execution of the penalty gestures remained unchanged, the church replaced the verbal description of the penalty with the phrase, "rather than do so, I would suffer my life to be taken."{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==Elimination==
In April 1990, the LDS Church eliminated the oaths and the penalty gestures from the endowment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dart|first1=John|title=Mormons Modify Temple Rites : Ceremony: Woman's vow to obey husband is dropped. Changes are called most significant since 1978.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-05/news/vw-353_1_temple-ceremony|work=Los Angeles Times|date=5 May 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period when these oaths were used, there was no documented instance in which a person was killed or committed [[suicide]] for having violated the oaths of secrecy of the endowment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. There has been, however, a link to temple ritual in the 1984 killing of an [[American Fork, Utah]], mother and daughter by [[Under the Banner of Heaven|Ron and Dan Lafferty]] (the throats were cut from ear to ear).{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Confusion with other doctrines==
These penalty oaths and the [[oath of vengeance]] are often confused as being related teachings. However, they were separate and distinct oaths; the oath of vengeance involved praying to God for justice in regard to the murders of Joseph Smith and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]]. While the oath of vengeance was removed from the endowment in 1927 as part of the LDS Church's [[Good Neighbor policy (LDS Church)|"Good Neighbor" policy]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} the penalty oaths were not completely removed until 1990. The penalty oaths are also frequently confused with the concept of [[blood atonement]], which was never incorporated into the Latter-day Saint [[temple (LDS Church)|temple]] ordinances.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==Continuation by Mormon fundamentalists==
Some groups within the [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist]] movement continue to practice the endowment without the LDS Church's 1927 and 1990 modifications.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Consequently, these groups still participate in these oaths when performing the endowment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Some of the denominations that continue to perform the original endowment include the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]], the [[Apostolic United Brethren]], and the [[True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

'''Presumptive regeneration''' (also '''presupposed regeneration''') is the idea often associated with [[Abraham Kuyper]] that parents should [[baptize]] their children based on a presumption of the child's being [[Regeneration (Christian doctrine)|regenerate]].

The 1905 synod of the [[Reformed Churches in the Netherlands]], meeting in Utrecht ([[Conclusion of Utrecht]]), declared:
{{blockquote | According to the confession of our churches, the seed of the covenant, by virtue of the promise of God, is to be considered regenerated and sanctified in Christ, until the contrary should become evident from their doctrine and conduct as they grow up | Acts, Article 158}}

These 1905 "Conclusions of Utrecht" were adopted by the Synod of the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]] in 1908. They were challenged from time to time, given an "official interpretation" by the Synod of 1962, and finally set aside in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Redeemer | URL = http://www.redeemer.on.ca/~tplant/m/MAU.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theologians of the [[Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (Liberated)|Liberated]], [[Free Reformed Churches of North America|Free Reformed]], and [[Netherlands Reformed Congregations|Netherlands Reformed]] traditions oppose the doctrine.  They charge this doctrine with providing parents and especially young adults with a false ground for the assurance of their salvation.  Parents begin to regard their children as saved because they were baptized.  Young adults begin to regard themselves as regenerate because they were baptized.  Pastors begin to assume that everyone in their church is regenerate.  Thus very little of the preaching is directed to unconverted persons and often neglects the necessity of repentance.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

These theologians would point to a document like the [[Westminster Larger Catechism]] as teaching the true ground for one's assurance of their own salvation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Question 80: Can true believers be infallibly assured that they are in the estate of grace, and that they shall persevere therein unto salvation?
&lt;br&gt;
Answer: Such as truly believe in Christ, and endeavor to walk in all good conscience before him, may, without extraordinary revelation, by faith grounded upon the truth of God's promises, and by the Spirit enabling them to discern in themselves those graces to which the promises of life are made, and bearing witness with their spirits that they are the children of God, be infallibly assured that they are in the estate of grace, and shall persevere therein unto salvation. 
&lt;br&gt;
Question 81: Are all true believers at all times assured of their present being in the estate of grace, and that they shall be saved?
&lt;br&gt;
Answer: Assurance of grace and salvation not being of the essence of faith, true believers may wait long before they obtain it; and, after the enjoyment thereof, may have it weakened and intermitted, through manifold distempers, sins, temptations, and desertions; yet are they never left without such a presence and support of the Spirit of God as keeps them from sinking into utter despair.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some Netherlands Reformed Church theologians might additionally point to a mystical revelation of God to the soul as providing the true ground for one's assurance.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Such is their interpretation, for example, of Romans 8:16.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "regeneration" is also affected by subtle shifts in meaning. [[John Calvin]] considered regeneration to represent the activity of New Birth - not its completion. While the current usage of the term looks back on New Birth, early on it meant the process of new birth itself, that is that God is working in the life of His children. His commentary on John 3&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = CCEL | URL = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom34.ix.i.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and many of his defenses of infant baptism in [[Institutes of the Christian Religion|the Institutes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = CCEL | URL = https://web.archive.org/web/20070206133727/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.iv.iv.xvii.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt; show this interest not to consider regeneration only as a single event in the believer's life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4074">'''Purity''' (''suddha'') is an important concept within much of [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, although the implications of the resultant moral purification may be viewed differently in the varying traditions. The aim is to purify the personality of the Buddhist practitioner so that all moral and character defilements and defects (''kleshas'' such as anger, ignorance and lust) are wiped away and [[Nirvana]] can be obtained.

== Theravada Understanding of Purity ==

[[Theravada]] Buddhism regards the path of self-purification as absolutely vital for the reaching of nibbana/nirvana. The main task of the Theravada Buddhist monk is to eradicate moral and character flaws through meditation and moral cultivation, in alliance with the cultivation of insight (''panna''/ ''prajna''), so that the purity of nibbana can be achieved. So important is this notion of purity in Theravada Buddhism that the famed Buddhist monk and commentator, [[Buddhaghosa]], composed a central thesis on [[dhamma]] (Buddhism) called ''The Path of Purity'' (''[[Visuddhimagga|Visuddhi-magga]]'').

== Mahayana Understanding of Purity ==

=== Tathagatagarbha ===

Controversially, according to the Mahayana [[Tathagatagarbha]] sutras, the unsullied essence or "true self" (also termed the [[Buddha nature]]) of the being can be laid bare and become manifest once the temporary and superficial contaminants ([[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]]) have been eradicated from its presence.&lt;ref&gt;''Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra in 12 Volumes'', tr. by Kosho Yamamoto, ed. by Dr. Tony Page, Nirvana Publications, London, 2000, Vol. 3, pp. 7-8 and ''passim'', and ''The Srimala Sutra'' tr. by Dr. Shenpen Hookham, Longchen Foundation Press, Oxford, 1995, p. 34).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In the Śrī-mālā, there are two main conditions for the"embryo of the Tathāgata" (''tathāgatagarbha''): either covered by defilements, when it is called only the "embryo of the Tathāgata"; or free from defilements, when the "embryo of the Tathāgata" is no more the "embryo" but the Tathāgata (= the Dharmakāya) (actuality) . . . . For example, the Mahābherīharaka-sūtra states at one point, 'accordingly at the time one becomes a Tathāgata, a Buddha, one is in ''nirvāṇa'' and is referred to as "permanent", "steadfast", "calm", "eternal" and "self" (''ātman'')'.   Alex and Hideko Wayman, The Lion's Roar of Queen Śrīmālā, Columbia University Press, 1974; p45&lt;/ref&gt;
These contaminants are seen as extrinsic to, rather than inherent within, the essence of the being.

The resulting Buddha (after the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]] have been eliminated) is referred to in the Tathagatagarbha literature and in the works of the Tibetan [[Jonangpa]] lama [[Dolpopa]] as the 'pure Self'.&lt;ref&gt;(''suddha-atman'' - see ''Mountain Doctrine'', by Prof. Jeffrey Hopkins, 2006, p. 201)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perfection of Wisdom===

The [[Perfection of Wisdom]] sutras of Mahayana Buddhism, in contrast, would ultimately view both impurity and purification as illusory, without any basis to either. Neither has an enduring essence and so is not truly 'fake', according to these ideas, but is merely a name or concept. Nevertheless, these scriptures do teach the need to detach from all moral defilements if Buddhahood is to be reached for the sake of awakening all sentient beings.

'''Religious literacy''' is the knowledge of, and ability to understand, [[religion]]. The importance of being religiously literate is increasing as [[globalisation]] has created greater links and [[human migration|migration]] between societies of different faiths and cultures. It has been proposed that including religious literacy as an aspect of public education would improve [[social cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ780618&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ780618 Comprehensive Religious Studies in Public Education: Educating for a Religiously Literate Society].

[[File:Rangoli.jpg|thumb|''[[Rangoli]]'', a popular form of [[Indian art|Indian Sand Paintings]], in [[Singapore]].]]
'''Sandpainting''' is the art of pouring coloured sands, and powdered pigments from minerals or crystals, or pigments from other natural or synthetic sources onto a surface to make a fixed, or unfixed sand painting. Unfixed sand paintings have a long established cultural history in numerous social groupings around the globe, and are often temporary, ritual paintings prepared for religious or healing ceremonies.  It is also referred to as drypainting.

Drypainting is practised by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the Southwestern United States, by [[Tibet]]an and Buddhist monks, as well as [[Australian Aborigines]], and also by Latin Americans on certain Christian holy days.

==History==

=== Native American sandpainting ===
[[File:Navajo sandpainting.jpg|thumb|Navajo sandpainting, photogravure by [[Edward S. Curtis]], 1907, Library of Congress]]

In the sandpainting of southwestern Native Americans (the most famous of which are the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] (known as the Diné)), the [[Medicine Man]] (or ''Hatałii'') paints loosely upon the ground of a [[hogan]], where the ceremony takes place, or on a [[buckskin (leather)|buckskin]] or cloth tarpaulin, by letting the coloured [[sand]]s flow through his fingers with control and skill. There are 600 to 1,000 different traditional designs for sandpaintings known to the Navajo. They do not view the paintings as static objects, but as spiritual, living beings to be treated with great respect. More than 30 different sandpaintings may be associated with one ceremony.

The colours for the painting are usually accomplished with naturally coloured sand, crushed [[gypsum]] (white), yellow [[ochre]], red [[sandstone]], [[charcoal]] and a mixture of charcoal and gypsum (blue). Brown can be made by mixing red and black; red and white make pink. Other colouring agents include corn meal, flower [[pollen]], or powdered roots and bark.

The paintings are for [[healing]] purposes only. Many of them contain images of ''[[Yeii|Yeibicheii]]'' (the Holy People). While creating the painting, the medicine man will [[chant]], asking the ''yeibicheii'' to come into the painting and help heal the patient.

When the medicine man finishes painting, he checks its accuracy. The order and [[symmetry]] of the painting symbolise the harmony which a patient wishes to reestablish in his or her life. The accuracy of a sandpainting is believed to determine its efficacy as a sacred tool. The patient will be asked to sit on the sandpainting as the medicine man proceeds with the healing chant. It is claimed the sandpainting acts as a portal to attract the spirits and allow them to come and go. Practitioners believe sitting on the sandpainting helps the patient to absorb spiritual power, while in turn the Holy People will absorb the illness and take it away. Afterward, when the sandpainting has served its purpose, it is considered to be toxic, since it has absorbed the illness. For this reason, the painting is destroyed. Because of the sacred nature of the ceremonies, the sandpaintings are begun, finished, used and destroyed within 12 hours.

[[File:Navajo sand painting (00171124).jpg|thumb|left|Navajo sandpainting, photo by [[H.S. Poley]], published c. 1890-1908, Library of Congress]]

The ceremonies involving sandpaintings are usually done in sequences, termed "chants", lasting a certain number of days depending on the ceremony. At least one fresh, new sandpainting is made for each day.

Some Navajo laws and taboos relate to the sandpaintings, and protect their holiness:
* Women of child-bearing age are not supposed to sing the chants associated with the ''yeibicheii''. This is both because the ceremony has a possibility of injuring an unborn child, and because of a taboo preventing menstruating women from attending. (Some cultures considered menstruation and presence of blood to be powerful spiritual events that had to be restrained, as they represented life forces.) Post-menopausal women are more likely to be chanters or diagnosticians.
* Authentic sandpaintings are rarely photographed, so as to not disrupt the flow of the ceremony. For many reasons, medicine men will seldom allow outsiders inside a sacred ceremony. Because so many outsiders are curious about sandpainting, some medicine men may create pieces for exhibition purposes only, using reversed colours and variations. To create an authentic sandpainting solely for viewing would be a [[Sacrilege|profane]] act. The sandpaintings for sale in shops and on the Internet are commercially produced and contain deliberate errors, as the real sandpaintings are considered sacred.
* The earliest credited instance of traditional Navajo sandpaintings (being rendered in coloured sands as opposed to tapestry or other media) being created in a permanent form for sale, have been traced to between 1945 and 1955. The main credit is generally given to a Navajo Hatałii named [[Fred Stevens, Jr. (Grey Squirrel)]], who developed the primary method of "permatizing" for commercial sandpaintings that is still used.&lt;ref name=Parezo&gt;Parezo, Nancy J. ''Navajo Sandpainting: From Religious Act to Commercial Art'', University of Arizona Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous Australian sandpainting===
[[File:Alice Springs4263.jpg|thumb|left|Artwork in Alice Springs]]
[[Indigenous Australian art]] has a history which covers more than 30,000 years, and a wide range of native traditions and styles.  These have been studied in recent decades and their complexity has gained increased international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Caruna, W.(2003) ''Aboriginal Art'', Thames and Hudson, London, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;  Aboriginal Art covers a wide variety of media, including sandpainting, painting on leaves, wood carving, rock carving, sculpture, and ceremonial clothing, as well as artistic embellishments found on weaponry and also tools.  Art is one of the key rituals of Aboriginal culture.  It was and still is, used to mark territory, record history, and tell stories about "[[Dreaming (spirituality)|The Dreaming]]".



Aboriginal people have taken to transforming their tradition sand paintings into more permanent forms using modern techniques and materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboriginalartdirectory.com/news/feature/ngurrara-the-great-sandy-desert-canvas.php|title=Ngurrara: The Great Sandy Desert Canvas Australian Aboriginal Art Feature at the Aboriginal Art Directory. View information about Ngurrara: The Great Sandy Desert Canvas|first=Aboriginal Art|last=Directory|date=|website=www.aboriginalartdirectory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey Bardon]] was an Australian art teacher who was instrumental in creating the [[Aboriginal art of the Western Desert]] movement, and in bringing Australian indigenous art to the attention of the world."... [directed by Bardon, the elders] began to interact with certain issues in 1960s and 70s international painting, especially the extreme schematisation of New York minimalism." In the [[History of Painting]]"Lyrical Abstraction in the late 1960s is characterised by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the fluxus movement and postminimalism (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of Artforum in 1969)&lt;ref name="sxdvrz"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt;  sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression."

[[Papunya Tula]], or Papunya Tula Artists Pty Ltd, is an artist cooperative formed in 1972 that is owned and operated by Aboriginal people from the Western Desert of Australia. [[Kaapa Tjampitjinpa]] is one of the early Papunya Tula artists and is known for ''[[Gulgardi]]''. It is notable for being the first work by an Indigenous Australian artist to win a contemporary art award, and the first public recognition of a Papunya painting.&lt;ref name=Parezo/&gt;

=== Tibetan sandpainting ===
{{Main|Sand mandala}}[[File:348Sandbild im Sera Kloster.jpg|thumb|right|Mandala made of sand in the Sera Monastery, Lhasa]]
[[File:MandalaSable2008-05.JPG|Mandala Sable 2008-05 showing the use of [[Chak-pur]]|thumb|left]]
[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] sand paintings usually composed ''[[mandala]]s''. In Tibetan, it is called ''dul-tson-kyil-khor'' (mandala of coloured powders).
The sand is carefully placed on a large, flat table.  The construction process takes several days, and the mandala is destroyed shortly after its completion.  This is done as a teaching tool and metaphor for the "impermanence" (Pali: ''[[anicca]]'') of all contingent and compounded phenomena (Sanskrit: ''[[Pratītya-samutpāda]]'').

The mandala sand-painting process begins with an opening ceremony, during which the ''[[lama]]s'', or Tibetan priests, consecrate the site and call forth the forces of goodness.  They chant, declare intention, ''[[mudra]]'', ''[[asana]]'', ''[[pranayama]]'', do visualisations, play music, recite ''[[mantra]]s'', etc.
[[File:Mandala zel-tary.jpg|thumb|right|Mandala zel-tary using [[Vajra]] to ceremoniously divide the painting]]
[[File:Tibetan monks, Twentse Welle.JPG|thumb|left|Tibetan monks in a ceremony after having broken their mandala, Twentse Welle]]
On the first day, the lamas begin by drawing an outline of the mandala to be painted on a wooden platform.  The following days see the laying of the coloured sands, which is effected by pouring the sand from traditional metal funnels called '''[[chak-pur]]'''. Each monk holds a ''chak-pur'' in one hand, while running a metal rod on its serrated surface; the vibration causes the sands to flow like liquid.
Formed of traditional prescribed [[iconography]] that includes [[List of geometric shapes|geometric shapes]] and a multitude of ancient spiritual symbols (e.g.: [[Ashtamangala]] and divine attributes of ''[[yidam]]''), [[seed syllables]], [[mantra]], the sand-painted mandala is used as a tool or instrument for innumerable purposes.  A primary purpose is to reconsecrate the earth and its inhabitants.
When the meditation is complete, the sand painting is ceremoniously destroyed using a [[Vajra]] and the sand is then gathered and taken to a body of water for offering.

===Japanese tray pictures===
From the 15th century in Japan, [[Buddhist]] artists in the times of the ''[[shōgun]]s'' practised the craft of ''[[bonseki]]'' by sprinkling dry coloured sand and pebbles onto the surface of plain black lacquered trays.  They used bird feathers as brushes to form the sandy surface into seascapes and landscapes.  These tray pictures were used in religious ceremonies.  Japanese esoteric Buddhism was transmitted from East Central Asia after the 8th century, and thus these Japanese Buddhist sandpaintings may share earlier historical roots with the more intricate brightly coloured Buddhist sand mandalas created by Tibetan Buddhist monks.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Table decking===
During the 17th and 18th centuries, the royal courts of Europe employed "table deckers", who decorated the side tables at royal banquets having adapted the craft of 'bonseki' from the Japanese. The table deckers sprinkled coloured sands, marble dust, sugars, etc. upon the surface of plain white tablecloths to create unfixed pictures of fruit, flowers, birds and rustic scenery. In between each design spaces were left for fruit bowls and sweetmeat dishes so that the diners could refresh themselves in between the main courses of the feast. These ornate pictures were discarded along with the debris of the feast.

As a fine example of the table deckers' craft, [[Woburn Abbey]] in [[Bedfordshire]], England possesses an ornate [[folding screen]] with three panels, decorated with sand pictures protected by glass.  The centre one has five spaces for [[sweetmeat]] pyramid dishes while the two side leaves of the screen have three spaces for fruit trays.  There are four sand pictures in each corner of the side panels of the screen, featuring 18th-century pastoral scenes, while the remaining areas of the screen are decorated with butterflies, doves, fruit, flowers, etc. The screen would be laid upon the surface of a side table.  It doubled as a serving base for elaborate porcelain dishes and glass trays containing fruits, bonbons and sweetmeats, from which the hosts and their guests could help themselves while socialising or stretching their legs between the multiple courses being served on the main table in the dining hall.  This screen may have been the work of the German artisan [[F. Schweikhardt]], who specialised in still-life studies in the style of the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Painting|painter]] [[Jan van Huysum]].

===Georgian sandpainting===
[[File:"The Hermit" - Sand Painting by Benjamin Zobel.jpg|thumb|''A Hermit by a Wayside Shrine'' by Benjamin Zobel (early 19th century)]]
Sandpainting as a craft was inspired by King George III, who was a skilled watchmaker and craftsman in his own right, and took an interest in the skills demonstrated by royal functionaries, known as Table Deckers, who decorated the white table-cloths at royal banquets with ornate centre-pieces decorated by using unfixed coloured sands and sugars as 'paint', and a bird's feather as a 'brush' a craft introduced by a European traveller who had observed the craftsmen at work in Japan.

It was while watching the table deckers at work the King suggested that if the sand pictures being temporarily laid out upon the surface of the tablecloths could be fixed permanently in place rather than being discarded with the remains of the feast, this would save much time and energy employing a multitude of skilled embroiderers toiling over such skilled work. So on one occasion the King bellowed to the craftsmen, "Why don't you fix it!" This set a number of craftsmen including Haas, Schweikhardt and [[Benjamin Zobel]] (Memmingen, Germany, 21 September 1762 - London, England, 24 October 1830), all of German origin, to, independently of each other, successfully develop suitable methods to achieve this goal, and these pictures were commissioned by the royal worthies of the day and became highly prized by the aristocracy. [[Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany|The King's brother]], the Duke of York, commissioned a number of works by Zobel and the others, although the sand artists jealously guarded their method from their competitors.
Zobel depicted "pigs in the manner of Morland"; "Nelson", the favourite dog of the Duke of York; "Tiger after George Stubbs", and an impressive "Vulture and snake."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
Although many of Zobel's works have survived, few of those by Haas have survived the passage of time, although observers considered his work superior to that of Zobel. This may reflect the differing techniques used by each artist. A diarist observed Zobel's coating the surface of the baseboard with a mixture of [[gum arabic]] and [[white lead]] and sprinkling sand upon the sticky surface using a folded paper [[funnel]] as a brush. He had to work quickly since the adhesive would dry in a few hours. Several of his surviving pictures have unfinished work on the reverse. Haas followed more closely the techniques developed in Japan, but mixing dry powdered gum arabic with the sand, sprinkling the mixture through a sieve and using feathers as brushes to create the pictures upon the baseboard, then fixing them by some method which he kept a secret. Due to the damp conditions in many of the stately homes of the day, his pictures failed to last more than a few years. On one occasion Haas was called away while working on an unfixed sand picture. When he returned he found one of Windsor Castle's cats curled up on the picture, thus damaging it!

Eventually Zobel returned to [[Memmingen]] in Bavaria where he continued to successfully pursue his craft. Some of his work is displayed in Memmingen Town Hall. Haas was forced to give up sand painting, probably due to the ongoing disasters with his pictures. He opened a bakery in Windsor instead, and the icing on his cakes may well have been decorated with pictures in coloured sugar instead of sand.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

With the passing of these Georgian craftsmen and the disposal of the Duke of York's collection the interest and skills evolved in sand picture work declined. The only Royal personage to take further interest in the craft was the late Queen Mary, consort to King George V, who bequeathed her Georgian sand paintings to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and her collection of [[Isle of Wight]] sand pictures to [[Carisbrooke Castle|Carisbrooke Castle Museum]] on the Isle of Wight.

In the first half of the 20th century Lt. Colonel Rybot was a keen collector of sand paintings, which were the source material of the articles written on the subject in the arts and crafts magazines of the day. Eventually 37 of his collection of sand paintings were the main feature at an auction held at [[Sotheby's]] New Bond Street gallery on 15 June 1956.

===Victorian sand picture souvenirs===

Thousands of sites exist where it is possible to collect natural coloured sands for craftwork, with an enormous range of colours being available around the globe varying with the contents of the mineral charged waters leaching through the sands. But for the tourist the vertical sand cliffs at [[Alum Bay]] on the Isle of Wight form the central portion of a visual geological phenomenon (best viewed after a shower of rain) which encapsulates the impressive chalk spires of [[The Needles]] and [[Tennyson Downs]]. Although tourists are no longer encouraged to obtain their own sand from the cliffs, numerous companies on the Island sell sand for the purpose of Sandpainting.

After her marriage to Prince Albert and having chosen [[Osborne House]] near [[Cowes]] to be her new family retreat, [[Queen Victoria]] was the prime mover in the gentrification of this former backwater, local artisans benefitted from the influx of wealthy visitors, and a number of craftsmen sold their fixed sand pictures and unfixed sand jars featuring views of the Island as unique keepsakes of the Isle of Wight.

Some of these sand pictures were small and crude and left unsigned, but Edwin and John Dore of Arreton produced some fine work in the 1840s. The pictures were of postcard size and the subject matter local views such as Carisbrooke Castle, and other touristy subjects. Edwin always signed his quaint pictures in a fine hand with a mapping pen and Indian ink, one of his most successful mass-produced subjects being 'Collecting birds eggs on Needles Cliffs'. John Dore used a card embellished with a printed border of lace design on which to execute his sand pictures although the quality of his work was inferior to that of his brother.

Few of the Island sand artists filled in the sky, giving that detail a light colourwash as a finishing touch, sometimes leaving doors and windows free of sand which would be blocked in with Indian ink. In the 1860s and 1870s J. Symons of Cowes kept up the good work, producing local views much larger than postcard size, mounted in glazed oak or maple frames and signed with the artist's signature on the reverse.
The father and son team the Neates of Newport sold their works from a stall outside Carisbrooke Castle gates where visitors were offered sand pictures and sand jars priced from 1/- to 2/6 each and the son grew his fingernails abnormally long in order to distribute the sand on his pictures.
During the 1930s and 1940s R.J.Snow of Lake came nearest to producing sand pictures in the manner of the Georgian craftsmen, but postcard size, although he did produce some fine commissioned work, particularly a view of Oddicombe in Devon, in which the sea and sky were also 'painted' in sand, but after the war years the quality of the postcard sand pictures deteriorated with the mass-produced article with little taste or skill being offered for sale for a few shillings.

===Senegal===

In Senegal, designs are glued to board and are typically of figures in the landscape.

===Sand bottles===

[[File:Sand Bottle - Andrew Clemens, 1879.jpg|thumb|right|Sand bottle by Andrew Clemens, 1879]]

In the 1860s to 1890s, [[Andrew Clemens]] a [[deaf mute]] born in Dubuque, Iowa, USA became famous for his craft of creating unfixed pictures using multicoloured sands compressed inside glass bottles or ornate chemist jars. The sand was collected from the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River. The subjects of his sand bottles included ornately decorated sentimental verses, sailing ships, plants, animals and portraits. 

He exhibited his work at the St. Louis trade fair and having spent hours creating a picture in a bottle would demonstrate to an incredulous audience that the picture inside was unfixed by destroying the bottle with a hammer. Clemens' sand bottles have become museum pieces and highly prized antiques which have since sold at auction for thousands of US dollars.

===Sand carpets===
[[File:Zandtapijt in Drentse keuken.jpg|thumb|Sandpainting on the tiled floor (on the wall are handpainted decorated tiles)]]
[[File:Plaza-centro.jpg|thumb|"Carpet" of land in the Town Hall Square in La Orotava [[Tenerife]] in celebration of Corpus Christi.]]
In the province of [[Drenthe]] in the Netherlands in the late 19th, early 20th centuries it was custom to use a stiff broom to sweep patterns in white sand to form simple decorations on the tiled floors of the houses, mostly for special occasions or celebrations. The next day it was swept up.
This custom was also practised in Northern Belgium by the Dutch speaking communities while in
Hekelgem, 1973 was the centenary year of the craft of "Old Zandtapijt". The hotels and cafes would employ artisans to strew ornate sand pictures in unfixed coloured sands on the tiled floors of their premises to encourage passing tourists to halt and enjoy local hospitality on their way towards Brussels. Roger de Boeck, born in 1930, was a well-respected exponent of this craft, who used glue to fix his sand pictures to a suitable base selling them to visitors to his atelier. In addition to biblical scenes, his finest works included a portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] 1953, and [[John F. Kennedy|US president John Kennedy]], in the early 60s. This craft continues, and a booklet to celebrate the centenary was published on 1 February 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Hekelgemse zandschilderkunst]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern culture==
[[File:Asynchronous Syntropy.jpg|thumb|left|"Asynchronous [[Syntropy]]" painting using coloured sand as seen at The Museum of Arts and Design "Swept Away" exhibit May 2012]]
In modern days, sandpainting is most often practised during [[Day of the Dead|Dia de los Muertos]] (Day of the Dead) in Mexico and the United States. Streets are decorated with sand paintings that are later swept away, symbolising the fleeting nature of life. Of note are the sandpaintings done during the [[Seattle]] [[Festál#Mexico: Día de Muertos|Dia De Muertos Festival]], but the most exciting development has been the Performance Art of Sand Animation which has created a new wave of younger artists and also revived interest in all types of sand painting.

A number of [[contemporary art]]ists use sand in ways that depart from specific cultural traditions exploring techniques by raking sand, pouring it, carving it, creating unique designs. The works are [[ephemeral]] and are primarily shared through documentation or part of a live performance.

Many of these artists were included in an exhibit at the [[Museum of Arts and Design]] in [[New York City]] titled "Swept Away: Dust, Ashes, and Dirt in Contemporary Art and Design" which was featured in the galleries in 2012.&lt;ref name="madmuseum1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.madmuseum.org/code/emuseum.asp?emu_action=advsearch&amp;rawsearch=exhibitionid/,/is/,/551/,/true/,/false&amp;profile=exhibitions |title=Museum of Arts and Design Collection Database |publisher=Collections.madmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202092125/http://collections.madmuseum.org/code/emuseum.asp?emu_action=advsearch&amp;rawsearch=exhibitionid%2F%2C%2Fis%2F%2C%2F551%2F%2C%2Ftrue%2F%2C%2Ffalse&amp;profile=exhibitions |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.madmuseum.org/html/exhibitions/551.html |title=Museum of Arts and Design Collection Database |publisher=Collections.madmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128023000/http://collections.madmuseum.org/html/exhibitions/551.html |archivedate=2012-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Curator [[David Revere McFadden]] described his reasoning for curating the exhibit as wanting to spotlight the work of contemporary artists who specialise in what he described as “unorthodox, unusual, or unexpected materials.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/03/01/mite-makes-right/ |title=Mite Makes Right |publisher=ARTnews |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present-day sand painting techniques===
[[File:Sand Painting of Mrs. Thatcher the 'Iron Lady' incorporating magnetised iron filings in the composition.jpg|thumb|upright|Brian Pike's 1985 portrait of [[Margaret Thatcher]] incorporates magnetised iron filings in the composition]]

Most artists use naturally occurring oxidised and mineral-charged coloured sands, adding powdered charcoal to widen the palette and in some instances idiosyncratic materials such as iron filings or discarded stonemasons' dust from ecclesiastical sites. Other artists use industrial tinted [[quartz]] sands with a capacity to resist [[intemperie]] action and a new generation of strong adhesives.  The work is protected with a coat of spray varnish. No protective glass frame is needed with the sands and the adhesives since the paintings have proved to resist the effect of direct sunlight without any yellowing of the varnish

'''Smaradahana''' is an [[old Javanese]] poem ([[Kakawin]]) written by Mpu Dharmaja as a [[eulogy]] for King [[Kameshwara|Kameçvara]] of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]] in early 12th century [[East Java]]. The story tells about the disappearance of [[Kamadeva|Kamajaya]] (god of love) and [[Rati|Kamaratih]] (goddess of love) from [[Svarga]]loka because being burnt by the fire burst out from the third eye of [[Shiva]].&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{Cite book

==Etymology==
''Smaradahana'' is a [[sanskrit]] word from ''smara'' ([[love]]) and ''dahana''. ''Dhana'' itself can be translated as thirst or yearning, also as ''dahana'' (fire). Smaradhana can be translated as the fire of love that burnt lovers' hearts which put them to yearn for their lover, suffering the thirst or hunger for love. The theme Smaradhana inspires many art and literature pieces such as stories, poems and love songs in [[Indonesia]].

==The story==
The story begin when the goddess [[Parvati]] was feeling lonely. She missed and longed for her husband Lord [[Shiva]], who at that time was meditating somewhere on a sacred mountain top. She decided to send [[Kamadeva]], a lesser love god known in ancient Java as Kamajaya, to search for Shiva. His task was to inspire love in Shiva's heart, to make him yearn for his wife.

Using the bow and arrow of love tipped with a flower, Kamajaya shot the meditating Shiva. Suddenly Shiva felt the desire to see his wife. His heart was filled with memories of past love-making with Parvati, so he promptly stopped his meditation. However, when Shiva opened his eyes, he caught sight of Kamajaya hiding behind a rock. Angered by the fact that Kamajaya, the lesser god, had dared to disturb his meditation, fire burst out from his third eye and burnt Kamajaya to ashes. Kamajaya's wife, goddess [[Rati]] or known in ancient Java as Kamaratih, out of her love, devotion and loyalty, jumped into Shiva's fire to follow her husband. They both died in the flames, disappeared from svargaloka and vanished from the realm of gods.

The spirits of the couple, the divine lovers Kamajaya and Kamaratih, fell upon earth, into the realm of human beings. Frequently incarnated as two lovers, constantly searching for each other on earth, the spirit of Kamajaya and Kamaratih symbolize love, lust, desire and the yearning that inspire, seduces and is suffered by all lovers on earth.

==History== 
Mpu Dharmaja wrote ''Smaradahana'' during the reign of [[Kameshwara|Kameçvara]], the second king of [[Kediri Kingdom|Kediri]] during the second quarter of 12th century. Historian believed that next to Dharmajaya's intention to transmit the Hindu mythology of [[Kamadeva]] being burnt by [[Shiva]]'s fire (interpreted by the Sanskrit poet [[Kalidasa]] in as ''[[Kumarasambhava]]'') it was also intended to explain the essence of love and desire in human beings. It is strongly suggested that the poem was also Dharmaja's [[eulogy]] for the king.

The tradition celebrated Kameçvara as a strikingly handsome man, while his [[queen consort]]; Çri Kirana is famous for her extraordinary beauty. The king was adored as the incarnation of [[Kamadeva|Kamajaya]], the god of love, and his capital city Dahana or Daha was admired throughout the known world. Kameçvara's wife, Çri Kirana, was celebrated as the incarnation of [[Rati|Kamaratih]], goddess of love and passion.

The Smaradhana become the prelude of [[Panji (prince)|Panji cycle]] tales, as Raden Inu Kertapati or Panji Asmoro Bangun is taught to be the incarnation of Kamajaya, while Dewi Chandra Kirana or Sekartaji as the incarnation of Kamaratih. The Panji tales spread throughout Southeast Asia as far as [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], [[Siam]] and [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|179–180}}

'''Steve Dennis "Clem" Grogan''' (born July 13, 1951) is an American convicted murderer and former member of the [[Manson Family]].

==Biography==
Grogan, a musician and artist, dropped out of high school and was involved in minor crimes. When his frustrated parents lost hope, they decided to drop him off at [[Spahn Ranch]]. He was immediately taken in by the ranch hands and began to do odd jobs around the ranch. Ranch hand [[Donald Shea]] took a liking to Grogan, often buying him clothes. Grogan was a resident long before Charles Manson and the Family became associated with Spahn Ranch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bucklee|first1=Windy|title=Interview|url=http://www.tlbradio.com|website=Tate LaBianca Radio|publisher=Brian Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Charles Manson]], he was friends with [[Dennis Wilson]] of the [[Beach Boys]]. He was often considered dumb, or even "retarded", by other Family members, earning him the nickname "Scramblehead", but some felt he was only "playing dumb". Allegedly, it was Grogan who wrecked Wilson's uninsured [[Ferrari]].&lt;ref name="cielo"&gt;[http://www.cielodrive.com/family/grogan/index.html Steve Dennis Grogan profile], cielodrive.com; accessed March 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, he was sentenced to 90 days observation at [[Camarillo State Mental Hospital]] for exposing his penis to a group of school children, but he returned to the ranch after two days.&lt;ref name="cielo"/&gt;

The night of August 10, 1969 he rode with members of the Manson family. [[Tex Watson]], [[Patricia Krenwinkel]] and [[Leslie Van Houten]] were dropped off at the house of [[Leno and Rosemary LaBianca]], but Grogan, Manson, [[Susan Atkins]] and [[Linda Kasabian]] continued to [[Venice Beach]] where Manson sent Grogan, Atkins and Kasabian to kill actor Saladin Nader, but Kasabian led them to the wrong apartment and the plan was aborted.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

Grogan later helped Manson, Watson and [[Bruce M. Davis]] kill Spahn ranch hand [[Donald "Shorty" Shea]]. The jury returned verdicts of life imprisonment for Manson and Davis, but death for Grogan. However, on December 23, 1971, Judge James Kolts stated that "Grogan was too stupid and too hopped on drugs to decide anything on his own" and that it was really Manson "who decided who lived or died" and reduced Grogan's sentence to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Bugliosi, Vincent, with Curt Gentry, ''Helter Skelter – The True Story of the Manson Murders 25th Anniversary Edition'', pg. 466, W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1994; {{ISBN|0-393-08700-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Grogan later assisted the authorities and drew a map to where Shea's body was buried. In prison he was head of the prison's program to deter juveniles from a life of crime and kept away from fellow inmate Manson. Grogan was released on parole from prison in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6Z_JEL2HOo|title=Manson Family – Special Report Part 4 Steve Grogan Paroled|publisher=Youtube.com|date=July 23, 2006|accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grogan played guitar and sang in the Freedom Orchestra Band with fellow Manson family co-conspirator [[Bobby Beausoleil]] when they both served time at the [[Deuel Vocational Institute]] in [[Tracy, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0SYuOa2yJA|title=Freedom Orchestra Live minute 6:09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beausoleil later revealed that he convinced Grogan to begin playing again and even made him a guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2004-11-17/news/lucifer-arisen|title=San Francisco Weekly – Lucifer, Arisen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
Grogan was one of the people featured in the Oscar-nominated 1973 documentary film ''[[Manson (film)|MANSON]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manson|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068918/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|website=IMDB|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Yada Yada'''" is the 153rd episode of the [[United States|American]] [[NBC]] [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Seinfeld]]''. The 19th episode of the eighth season, it aired on April 24, 1997. Peter Mehlman and Jill Franklyn were [[List of awards and nominations received by Seinfeld|nominated for an Emmy]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series]] in 1997.

==Plot==
Jerry's dentist, [[Dr. Tim Whatley|Tim Whatley]] ([[Bryan Cranston]]), has just finished the process of [[converting to Judaism]] but is already making Jewish-themed jokes that make Jerry, who is Jewish, uncomfortable. Jerry goes so far as to say that he believes that Whatley only converted "for the jokes".

[[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] and [[Mickey Abbott]] double date, but can't decide which woman, Karen or Julie, is right for which one of them.

[[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] is a character reference for [[Debra Messing|Beth]] and Arnie ([[Stephen Caffrey (actor)|Stephen Caffrey]]), a couple who are trying to adopt, but the story she tells during an interview destroys all hope of adoption: she mentions a time when she and the couple went to a movie, and the husband lost his temper because Elaine was talking during the movie.

George's new girlfriend [[Suzanne Cryer|Marcy]] likes to say "yada yada yada" to shorten her stories. He tries using this practice to avoid mentioning [[The Invitations|Susan's death]] but then becomes suspicious when Marcy tells him that her ex-boyfriend had visited her the night before "and yada yada yada, I'm really tired today". George later consults Jerry and Elaine, suspecting that Marcy used "yada yada" to cover up sex with her ex-boyfriend, and Elaine believes that this is possible.

:George: ''You don't think she'd yada yada sex?''
:Elaine: ''I've yada yada'd sex!''

Later, George asks Marcy to tell him some of the things she was covering up with "yada yada", and discovers that she's a habitual [[shoplifter]]. George, however, is still reluctant to tell her how his engagement ended (since George mentioned: "Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.")

Jerry confesses to a priest about what he thinks of Tim's conversion, saying that he's offended (not as a Jew, but as a comedian), only to get sidetracked when the priest laughs at a Catholic joke of Tim's that he repeats.  However, the priest is less amused by a dentist/sadist joke that Jerry makes at the end of their conversation.  George drops by Jerry's confession and tells him that they need to talk. Kramer decides on the right woman, and Mickey also decides to make his commitment; however, it becomes apparent they made a mistake when Kramer meets Karen's parents, who are revealed to be little people like Mickey. Tim hears about the dentist joke that Jerry told the priest. He takes extreme exception to it and, as a result, deliberately prolongs an uncomfortable procedure. After hearing Jerry's complaints about Tim, Kramer calls Jerry an "anti-dentite".

Elaine lobbies on behalf of Beth and Arnie, and propositions the adoption official as an inducement. Beth's marriage nonetheless fails and she accompanies Jerry to Mickey's wedding to Karen. Elaine, now dating the adoption agent, is dismayed. George shows up without Marcy, explaining that "She was getting shoes for the wedding, yada yada yada, I'll see her in 6 to 8 months." Julie runs out before the wedding begins, apparently in love with Mickey and unable to bear seeing him marry Karen. Mickey's [[Robert Wagner|dad]], a dentist, stands up for Whatley and chastises Jerry for antagonizing him: "Tim Whatley was one of my students, and if this wasn't my son's wedding day, I'd knock your teeth out, you anti-dentite bastard." Jerry is initially comforted by Beth who is at first shown to harbor the same feelings towards dentists as Jerry, until she also reveals herself to be both racist and antisemitic, at which point Jerry dumps her and tells Elaine that she left "to get her head shaved". As Karen and Mickey walk out at the end of the ceremony, Karen says to Kramer, "I really wanted ''you''", much to his surprise.

==Production==
The episode was allowed by [[NBC]] to run longer than the usual thirty minutes, and its slightly above-average length was even boasted about in promos. An edited version airs in syndication, cutting out several small scenes and dialogues, but the full-length version is available on the ''Seinfeld'' Season 8 DVD collection and on [[Hulu]].

==="Yada yada"===
The episode is one of the most famous of the series, specifically for its focus on the phrase "yada yada". "Yadda yadda" was already a relatively common phrase before the episode aired, used notably by comedian [[Lenny Bruce]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E0DC1238F931A1575BC0A96F958260 "Word for Word: Neology; In the Dictionary Game, Yada Yada Yada Is Satisficing to Some, Not Others"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 22, 1999. Accessed April 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; among others. The phrase may have originated with the 1950s "yackety-yack", 1940s [[vaudeville]], or earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SamClem |url=http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/myadda.html |title=Straight Dope Staff Report: What's the origin of "yadda yadda"? |publisher=Straightdope.com |date=2003-01-23 |accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phrase can be heard in the background of After the Fire's&lt;ref&gt;[[After the Fire]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}} 1982 version of the song, "Der Kommissar" at the 3:00 mark. The phrase was used by a secretary summing up the boring parts of a letter in the February 16, 1984 ''[[Magnum PI]]'' episode "The Return of Luther Gillis" 14 years before the Seinfeld episode, in the December 7, 1989 (Season 8 Episode 11) "[[Cheers]]" episode "Feeble Attraction" and in the May 13, 1993 ''[[Cheers]]'' episode "The Guy Can't Help It". On the May 7, 1992 ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Bart's Friend Falls in Love]]" Bart says, "Well, Milhouse, tis better to have loved and lost, yada yada yada."

The phrase was used in the "She's Back" episode of ''[[Wings (1990 TV series)|Wings]]'', on 1/3/95, when character Sandy Cooper "yada, yadas" through the wedding ceremony to Joe Hackett.

The phrase was used in the fifth episode of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', "[[Never Kill a Boy on the First Date]]", which aired on March 31, 1997, appearing when [[Buffy Summers]] explains to [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] that she knows about a prophecy. The ''Seinfeld'' episode first aired a little less than a month later.

Before the episode aired, writer [[Peter Mehlman]] suspected that it would spawn a new ''Seinfeld'' catchphrase, but he thought it would be the phrase "anti-dentite" that would become popular. The Paley Center named "Yada Yada Yada" the No. 1 funniest phrase on "TV's 50 Funniest Phrases".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gina Carbone |url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20090526-ENTERTAIN-90526050 |title='TV's 50 Funniest Phrases': 'Yada, yada, yada' is No. 1 |publisher=Seacoastonline.com |date=2009-05-26 |accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
[[Scott Adams]], creator of [[Dilbert]] was influenced by the episode as broadcast on April 24, 1997, as the Dilbert comic strip 6 days later on April 30, 1997, had a direct reference to "yada yada".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/1997-04-30/ |title=Dilbert comic strip for 04/30/1997 from the official Dilbert comic strips archive. |publisher=Dilbert.com |date=1997-04-30 |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seinfeld's use of "yada yada" was referenced in the ''[[King of the Hill]]'' episode "Yankee Hanky" by [[Dale Gribble]], who ridicules [[Hank Hill]]'s discovery that he was born in [[New York City]] by using the phrase.

[[That Handsome Devil]] produced a song titled "Yada-Yada". Similarly, the episode was overtly referenced in the name of a popular Connecticut-based rock and roll outfit, The Anti-Dentites.

The episode was seemingly referenced by politician [[Sarah Palin]] in an email to ''[[The Daily Caller]]'' November 1, 2010:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I suppose I could play their immature, unprofessional, waste-of-time game, too, by claiming these reporters and politicos are homophobe, child molesting, tax evading, anti-dentite, puppy-kicking, chain smoking porn producers…really, they are... I've seen it myself...but I'll only give you the information off-the-record, on deep, deep background; attribute these "facts" to an "anonymous source" and I'll give you more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2010/11/01/sarah-palin-pounds-liberal-media-outlets-like-politico-for-using-anonymous-sources-to-attack-her/ |title=Sarah Palin Pounds Liberal Media |publisher=Dailycaller.com |date=2011-02-28 |accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Hyena bestiary.jpg|thumb|A hyena, as depicted in a medieval bestiary]]
'''Were-hyena''' is a [[neologism]] coined in analogy to [[werewolf]] for [[therianthropy]] involving [[hyena]]s. It is common in the folklore of [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]] and the [[Near East]], as well as some adjacent territories. Unlike werewolves and other therianthropes, which are usually portrayed as being originally human, some werehyena lore tells of how they can also be hyenas disguised as humans.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;{{cite book | author= Woodward, Ian | title=The Werewolf Delusion | year=1979 | isbn= 0-448-23170-0 | page= 256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==African cultures==
In [[Somalia]], it is traditionally believed that '''''Qori Ismaris''''' ("One who rubs himself with a stick") was a man who could transform himself into a "Hyena-man" by rubbing himself with a magic stick at nightfall and by repeating this process could return to his human state before dawn.

Also in [[Ethiopia]], it is traditionally believed that every [[blacksmith]], whose trade is hereditary, is really a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] or [[Witchcraft|witch]] with the power to change into a hyena.  These blacksmith werehyenas are believed to rob graves at midnight and are referred to as ''[[Buda (folk religion)|bouda]]''&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt; (also spelled ''buda'').&lt;ref name=tyler/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salamon" /&gt;  They are viewed with suspicion by most countrymen. Belief in the ''bouda'' is also present in [[Sudan]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Morocco]] where some among the [[Berber people]] regard the ''bouda'' as a man or woman who nightly turns into a hyena and resumes human shape at dawn.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt; Many Ethiopian [[Christian]]s characterize [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]] as being bouda, accusing them of unearthing Christian corpses and consuming them; the commonality of blacksmithing as a traditional profession for Jewish men in Ethiopia may be a reason for the connection between the two beliefs.&lt;ref name="Salamon"&gt;{{cite book | author= Salamon, Hagar | title=The Hyena People: Ethiopian Jews in Christian Ethiopia | year=1999 | isbn= 0-520-21901-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Kanuri language]] of the former [[Bornu Empire]] in the [[Lake Chad]] region, werehyenas are referred to as '''''bultungin''''' which translates into "I change myself into a hyena".&lt;ref name=tyler&gt;{{cite book | title=Primitive culture | first=Edward Burnett | last=Tylor | authorlink=Edward Burnett Tylor | publisher=John Murray | year=1920 | page=301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was once traditionally believed that one or two of the villages in the region was populated entirely by werehyenas,&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt; such as Kabultiloa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Natural Genesis – Vol.1 | first=Gerald | last=Massey | publisher=Cosimo, Inc. | year=2007 | isbn=1-60206-084-3 | page=73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the folklore of western Sudanic peoples, there is a hybrid creature, a human who is nightly transformed into a cannibalistic monster that terrorizes people, especially lovers. The creature is often portrayed as a magically powerful healer, blacksmith, or woodcutter in its human form, but recognizable through signs like a hairy body, red and gleaming eyes and a nasal voice.&lt;ref name="Magic" /&gt;

Members of the Korè cult of the [[Bambara people]] in [[Mali]] “become” hyenas by imitating the animals' behaviour through masks and roleplays. These are evocative of the hyenas' reviled habits, and may also be used to evoke fear among the participants, leading them to avoid such habits and traits in their own lives.&lt;ref name="Magic" /&gt;

==Other cultures==
Al-Doumairy, in his ''Hawayan Al-Koubra'' (1406), wrote that hyenas are [[vampiric]] creatures that attack people at night and suck the blood from their necks. Arab folklore tells of how hyenas can mesmerise victims with their eyes or sometimes with their pheromones.&lt;ref name="ABI"&gt;{{cite book | author= Mounir R. Abi-Said | title=Reviled as a grave robber: The ecology and conservation of striped hyenas in the human dominated landscapes of Lebanon | year=2006 | page=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Persia]]n medical treatise written in 1376 tells how to cure people known as ''kaftar,'' who are said to be “half-man, half-hyena,” who have the habit of slaughtering children.&lt;ref name="Magic"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/afs/pdf/a1246.pdf | title = The Magicality of the Hyena: Beliefs and Practices in West and South Asia | publisher = Asian Folklore Studies, Volume 57, 1998: 331–344 | accessdate = 23 | date = June 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625072539/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/afs/pdf/a1246.pdf | archivedate = 2008-06-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greek people|Greeks]], until the end of the 19th century, believed that the bodies of werewolves, if not destroyed, would haunt battlefields as vampiric hyenas which drank the blood of dying soldiers.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt;

'''''Young &amp; Wild''''' ({{lang-es|Joven y alocada}}) is a 2012 Chilean [[Coming-of-age story|coming-of-age]] [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Marialy Rivas]] and co-written by Marialy Rivas, Camila Gutiérrez, María José Viera-Gallo and [[Pedro Peirano]]. Starring [[Alicia Rodríguez (Chilean actress)|Alicia Rodríguez]] and Maria Gracia Omegna, the film tells the story of Daniela, a 17-year-old bisexual girl who writes a blog about the conflicts she experiences between her [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]], conservative family and her sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/young-wild-sundance-film-review-286274 Young and Wild Sundance Film Review] Todd McCarthy, www.hollywoodreporter.com, January 2012. Retrieved 15 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 2012 where it was awarded the World Cinema Screenwriting Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundance.org/press-center/release/2012-sundance-film-festival-awards/ 2012 Sundance Film Festival Announces Awards] Sundance Institute, 28 January 2012. Retrieved 16 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Daniela is a 17-year-old girl who lives in [[Santiago]], Chile. Despite her family's deeply held [[Protestantism|Protestant]] beliefs, she eagerly explores her sexuality, through both casual sex and a blog titled Young and Wild. The blog serves as a place where she questions her church's teachings and documents her sexual adventures, including her first experiences with masturbation, oral sex, and anal sex. As her blog becomes more popular, it attracts comments from people who range from supportive to gossipy to outright propositioning her for sex.

After she is caught having sex with another student, she is expelled from her conservative Christian school. Her mother does not initially react when told the news, and Daniela learns that her beloved aunt, a bohemian who serves as a role model for her, is being taken to the hospital due to cancer. There, her aunt pleads with Daniela's mother not to send the girl to perform grueling missionary work. Instead, Daniela takes a job at a local Christian television station as a gofer, where she meets coworkers Tomás and Antonia.

Daniela is immediately drawn to Tomás, about whom she begins fantasizing. The two begin dating, though he refuses to engage in premarital sexual activity. Sexually frustrated, Daniela attempts to seduce him and has varying degrees of success. When she complains to Antonia, Antonia invites her to a party, where Daniela briefly performs oral sex on Tomás until he stops her. As she leaves the party, Daniela whispers to Antonia that she came to have sex with both Tomás and her. Shortly after, Antonia and Daniela begin an affair that Daniela documents on her blog.

Daniela's parents come to trust Tomás, whom they allow to stay unsupervised with her. However, Tomás' inhibitions finally break down when Daniela questions whether he is interested in her.  The two finally have sex, and Daniela describes on her blog how she feels torn between Antonia and Tomás, both of whom with which she is regularly having sex. Antonia expresses displeasure with their covert relationship, but Daniela is unwilling to commit to only one partner. When her family dines at a restaurant and thieves storm in, the family holds hands and prays, and the robbers pass by them. Daniela subsequently begins to question both her spirituality and morals.

Daniela surprises both her blog readers and family when she announces that she wishes to be baptized. Her family is excited, and her aunt arranges a baptism at a lake, the same as her aunt's experience. However, Tomás discovers her blog and learns that she has been cheating on him. Furious, he breaks up with her, and her mother angrily chastises Daniela for her behavior.  Her aunt dies shortly afterward, leaving Daniela with many questions, ranging from spirituality to relationships. Daniela closes the film with voice-over that quotes [[Paul the Apostle]] and says that she has not abandoned the beliefs of her childhood.

==Critical reception==
Critics had mixed reactions to the film.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The ''New York Times'' was unimpressed by Alicia Rodríguez' lead performance and the "insistently blanched" cinematography.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://movies.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/movies/young-and-wild-by-marialy-rivas.html?_r=0 Young and Wild by Mariely Rivas] Nicolas Rapold, NYTimes.com, 29 November 2012. Retrieved 16 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, other critics praised the portrayal of unwanted emotional conflicts emerging beyond physical relationships. Erik Childress of eFilmCritic writes: "This is a film that respects sex and the emotional consequences that follow once the heat wears off."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.efilmcritic.com/feature.php?feature=3357 Wrapping Up The Best Of Sundance 2012] Erik Childress, eFilmCritic, 17 February 2012. Retrieved 15 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Todd McCarthy for ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said about the film that "the ferocious effort of conservative religions to keep a tight lid on pre-marital sex is as old as history, but seeing it played out in a South American context gives it a new twist, at least onscreen."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/young-wild-sundance-film-review-286274 "Young &amp; Wild: Sundance Film Review" by Todd McCarthy]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bai-Ülgen''' or '''Ülgen''' ([[Old Turkic]]: '''Bey Ülgen'''; also spelled '''Bai-Ulgen''', '''Bai-Ülgen''', '''Bay-Ulgan''', '''Bay-Ulgen''', or '''Bay-Ülgen'''; Khakas: ''Ӱлген'', Russian: ''Ульгень'' or ''Ульге́нь'', Ottoman: اولگن) is a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Mongols|Mongolian]] creator-deity, usually distinct from [[Tengri]] but sometimes identified with him in the same manner as [[Helios#Helios and Apollo|Helios and Apollo]]. His name is from Old Turkic ''bay'', "rich", and ''ülgen'', "magnificent". Ülgen is believed to be without either beginning or end.

==Features==
In [[Altaic mythologies|Turkic and Mongolian mythology]], the birch tree, regarded as a cosmic axis between earth and sky, was regarded as sacred to him, as was the [[horse]] (horse-sacrifice was a part of his worship).&lt;ref&gt;Horse Sacrifice and The Shaman's Ascent to The Sky, [http://www.mircea-eliade.com/from-primitives-to-zen/093.html Adapted from: Mircea Eliade]&lt;/ref&gt; Ülgen symbolizes goodness, welfare, abundance, plentiness of food, water, etc. Furthermore, he created earth, heaven and all living beings. In addition, he controls the atmospheric events and movements of stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://turkish.ruvr.ru/2012_12_29/altay-ve-sor-mitolojisinde-ulgen-tanrisi/ Altay ve Şor Mitolojisinde Ülgen Tanrısı]&lt;/ref&gt; He creates land for people to live on, the heads of both humans and animals and the rainbow. He was regarded as the [[patron god]] of [[shamans]] and the source of their knowledge.

It is believed that Ülgen has been created from Tengri (Tengere Kayra Khan). He is the highest deity after Tengri in the Mongo-Turkic pantheon. Often, Ülgen is compared with Tengri and at times they are thought to be on par, or even the same. In some sayings, the name/function of Ülgen may be (partially) interchangeable with that of Tengri.

Ülgen is described as the enemy of [[Erlik]] who is the god of evil and darkness. Ülgen assumes the protectorship of humankind against him.

Bai-Ülgen lives on the sixteenth floor of the sky above the stars, sun and moon in a golden house. Mere humans may never reach him, excepting shamans or kams, who possess astral powers. Animals are used for sacrifice in worship of him, especially horses. Once in every third, sixth, ninth, or twelfth year, a shaman may sacrifice a white horse as the first step of reaching Ülgen. Then he must ride its soul, penetrate through all the layers of heaven until he reaches Ülgen. Firstly, the kam (shaman) meets Yayık who is the servant of Ülgen. This entity informs the kam whether or not the offering has been accepted. If the sacrificial rite has been successful, the shaman is able to learn from the omniscient Ülgen of impending dangers, such as bad harvests.
