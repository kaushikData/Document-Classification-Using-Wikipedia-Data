==Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and ensuing economic effects==
[[File:Kuwait burn oilfield.png|thumb|One of the hundreds of [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] set by retreating Iraqi forces in 1991]]
On August 2, 1990, The [[Republic of Iraq]] invaded the [[State of Kuwait]], leading to a 7-month occupation of Kuwait and an eventual U.S.-led military intervention. While Iraq officially claimed Kuwait was stealing its oil via slant drilling, its true motives were more complicated and less clear. At the time of the invasion, Iraq owed Kuwait $14 billion of outstanding debt that Kuwait had loaned it during the 1980–1988 [[Iran–Iraq War]]. In addition, Iraq felt Kuwait was overproducing oil, lowering prices and hurting Iraqi oil profits in a time of financial stress.

In the buildup to the invasion, Iraq and Kuwait had been producing a combined {{convert|4.3|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil a day. The potential loss of these supplies, coupled with threats to [[Saudi Arabian]] oil production, led to a rise in prices from $21 per barrel at the end of July to $28 per barrel on August 6. On the heels of the invasion, prices rose to a peak of $46 per barrel in mid-October.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

The United States' rapid intervention and subsequent military success helped to mitigate the potential risk to future oil supplies, thereby calming the market and restoring confidence. After only nine months, the spike had subsided, although the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] set by retreating Iraqi forces were not completely extinguished until November 1991, and it took years for the two countries' combined production to regain its former level.&lt;ref name=Hamilton/&gt;

===U.S. financial response===
The U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary tightening in 1988 targeted the rapid inflation of the 1980s. By raising interest rates and lowering growth expectations, the Fed hoped to slow and eventually reduce inflationary pressures, creating greater [[price stability]]. The August 6 invasion was seen as a direct threat to the price stability the Fed sought. In fact, the [[Council of Economic Advisors]] published a consensus estimate that a one-year, 50 percent increase in the price of oil could temporarily raise the price level of the economy by 1 percent and potentially lower real output by the same amount.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

Despite the potential for inflation, the U.S. Fed and central banks around the globe decided it would not be necessary to raise interest rates to counteract the rise in oil prices. Rather, the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates as if the oil price spike were &lt;!---subjuctive case---&gt;not occurring. This decision to refrain from action stemmed from confidence in the future success of [[Desert Storm]] to protect major oil-producing facilities in the [[Middle East]] and a will to maintain the long-term credibility of economy policy that had been built up during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

To avoid being accused of inaction in the face of potential economic turbulence, the U.S. revised the [[Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced Budget Act]]. Initially, the act prohibited the U.S. from changing budget deficit targets even in the event of a negative shock to the economy. When oil prices rose, revision of this act allowed the U.S. government to adjust its budget for changes in the economy, further mitigating the risk of rising prices. The result was a peak in prices at $46 per barrel in mid-October, followed by a steady decline in prices until 1994.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6635">An '''acetogen''' is a [[microorganism]] that generates [[acetate]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) as an end product of [[anaerobic respiration]] or [[fermentation]]. However, this term is usually employed in a more narrow sense only to those [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] that perform anaerobic respiration and [[carbon fixation]] simultaneously through the reductive acetyl coenzyme A ([[acetyl-CoA]]) pathway (also known as the [[Wood–Ljungdahl pathway|Wood-Ljungdahl pathway]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schuchmann|first=Kai|last2=Müller|first2=Volker|date=2016-07-15|title=Energetics and Application of Heterotrophy in Acetogenic Bacteria|url=http://aem.asm.org/content/82/14/4056|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=82|issue=14|pages=4056–4069|doi=10.1128/aem.00882-16|issn=0099-2240|pmid=27208103|pmc=4959221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Ivan A.|last2=Kockelkorn|first2=Daniel|last3=Ramos-Vera|first3=W.

Acetogens are found in a variety of habitats, generally those that are [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] (lack oxygen).  Acetogens can use a variety of compounds as sources of energy and carbon; the best studied form of acetogenic metabolism involves the use of [[carbon dioxide]] as a carbon source and [[hydrogen]] as an energy source. Carbon dioxide reduction is carried out by the key enzyme acetyl-CoA synthase. Together with methane-forming archaea, acetogens constitute the last limbs in the anaerobic [[food web]] that leads to the production of methane from polymers in the absence of oxygen. Acetogens may represent ancestors of the first bioenergetically active cells in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Volker, and Frerichs, Janin(Sep 2013) Acetogenic Bacteria. In: eLS.

== Metabolic roles ==

Acetogens have diverse metabolic roles, which help them thrive in different environments.&lt;ref name="KIR"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ragsdale|first1=Stephen W.|last2=Pierce|first2=Elizabeth|date=December 2008|title=Acetogenesis and the Wood-Ljungdahl Pathway of CO2 Fixation|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|volume=1784|issue=12|pages=1873–1898|doi=10.1016/j.bbapap.2008.08.012|issn=0006-3002|pmc=2646786|pmid=18801467}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of their metabolic products is acetate which is an important nutrient for the host and its inhabiting microbial community, most seen in termite's guts.  Acetogens also serve as "Hydrogen sinks" in termite's GI tract.&lt;ref name="KIR" /&gt; Hydrogen gas inhibits biodegradation and acetogens use up these hydrogen gases in the anaerobic environment to favor the biodegradative capacity of the host by reacting hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide to make acetate.&lt;ref name="KIR" /&gt; Acetogens have the ability to use variety of substrates in an event where another competitor such as a methanogen makes Hydrogen gas a limiting substrate.&lt;ref name="KOS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schuchmann|first1=Kai|last2=Müller|first2=Volker|date=15 July 2016|title=Energetics and Application of Heterotrophy in Acetogenic Bacteria|url=http://aem.asm.org/content/82/14/4056.full#ref-94|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=82|issue=14|pages=4056–4069|doi=10.1128/AEM.00882-16|issn=0099-2240|pmid=27208103|pmc=4959221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acetogens can use and convert alcohols, lactates and fatty acids, which are usually restricted to [[Syntrophy|syntrophs]], instead of just carbon dioxide and hydrogen.&lt;ref name="KOS" /&gt; This enables them to take on the roles of important contributors of food chain such as primary fermenters.&lt;ref name="KOS" /&gt; Acetogens can work together with [[methanogen]]s, as exemplified by the  conversion of carbohydrates by a [[Methanosarcina barkeri]] and coculture of A. woodii. The methanogen takes up acetate to favor the acetogen.&lt;ref name="KOS" /&gt; Sometimes the interspecies transfer of Hydrogen gas between A. woodii and an H2-consuming methanogen results in hydrogen gas being released from the acetogen instead of going toward acetogenesis by [[Wood–Ljungdahl pathway|WLP]].&lt;ref name="KOS" /&gt; Acetogens are also one of the contributors to corrosion of steel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5367">An '''alkalide''' is a [[chemical compound]] in which [[alkali metal]]s are [[anion]]s (that is, they bear a negative charge). Such species are notable because alkali metals were previously thought to appear in [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s only as [[cation]]s. Alkalide compounds have been synthesized containing a cation of the [[alkaline earth]] metal [[barium]].&lt;ref name="Redko"&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=M. Y. Redko |author2=R. H. Huang |author3=J.

=="Normal" chemistry: the case of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;==
Alkali metals are well known to form salts.  Table salt, or [[sodium chloride]] Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, illustrates the usual role of an alkali metal such as sodium: its positive charge is balanced by a negatively charged ion in the [[empirical formula]] for this [[ionic compound]]. The traditional explanation for this phenomenon is that the loss of one [[electron]] from elemental sodium to produce a cation with a single positive charge produces a stable [[valence shell|closed-shell]] [[electron configuration]]. Sodium was thought to always form [[Monovalent ion|singly charged]] cations until the discovery of alkalides&lt;ref&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the same arguments apply to the remainder of the alkali metals.

==Scope of alkalides==
Known alkalides include [[sodium|Na]]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, [[potassium|K]]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, [[rubidium|Rb]]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[caesium|Cs]]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.  These species are called sodide or natride, potasside or kalide, rubidide, and caeside, respectively. “Lithides” and "francides", compounds containing [[Lithium|Li]]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or [[Francium|Fr]]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, are not currently known.  The known alkalides, first discovered in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] |author1=J. L. Dye |author2=J. M. Ceraso |author3=Mei Lok Tak |author4=B. L.

Alkalide species are chemically related to the [[electride]]s, salts containing trapped electrons as the "anions".&lt;ref name="Redko"/&gt;

==Examples==
A typical alkalide is the sodium natride salt [Na(2,2,2-crypt)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. This salt contains both Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Na&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.  The [[cryptand]] isolates and stabilizes the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, preventing its reduction by the Na&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Dimer (chemistry)|Dimer]]s of cationic and anionic sodium have also been observed,&lt;ref name="Redko" /&gt; as has an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; salt known as "inverse [[sodium hydride]]".&lt;ref&gt; {{ cite journal |author1=M.

Normally, alkalides are thermally labile due to the high reactivity of the alkalide anion, which is theoretically able to break most [[covalent bond]]s including the C–O bonds in a typical cryptand.  The introduction of a special cryptand ligand containing amines instead of ether linkages has allowed the isolation of kalide and natrides that are stable at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=J.

==Pathway==
Alpha-oxidation of [[phytanic acid]] is believed to take place entirely within [[peroxisomes]]. 
#[[Phytanic acid]] is first attached to [[Coenzyme A|CoA]] to form [[phytanoyl-CoA]].
#[[Phytanoyl-CoA]] is oxidized by [[phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase]], in a process using Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to yield 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA.
#2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA is cleaved by [[2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase]] in a [[thiamine pyrophosphate|TPP]]-dependent reaction to form pristanal and [[formyl-CoA]] (in turn later broken down into [[formate]] and eventually CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
#Pristanal is oxidized by [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] to form [[pristanic acid]] (which can then undergo [[beta-oxidation]]).
(Propionyl-CoA is released as a result of beta oxidation when the beta carbon is substituted)

==Deficiency==
Enzymatic deficiency in alpha-oxidation (most frequently in [[phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase]]) leads to [[Refsum's disease]], in which the accumulation of [[phytanic acid]] and its derivatives leads to neurological damage. Other disorders of [[peroxisome]] biogenesis also prevent alpha-oxidation from occurring.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4459">'''Anthropic rock''' is rock that is made, modified and moved by humans.  [[Concrete]] is the most widely known example of this.&lt;ref&gt;A. Bentur, "Cementitious Materials--Nine Millennia and a New Century: Past, Present, and Future", ASCE Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering 14: 2-22 (February 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  The new category has been proposed to recognise that man-made rocks are likely to last for long periods of Earth's future [[geological time]], and will be important in humanity's long-term future.

==History==
Historically, [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[Lithogenesis (geology)|lithogenesis]] is a new event or process on Earth. For millennia humans dug and built only with natural rock. Archaeologists, during 1998, reported that artificial rock was made in ancient [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;E.C. Stone, "From shifting silt to solid stone: the manufacture of synthetic basalt in ancient Mesopotamia", Science 280: 2091-2093 (26 June 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Romans developed and widely used concrete, much of which is intact today. [[Great Britain|British]] [[Victorian era|Victorians]] were very familiar with the durable mock-rock surface formations used in public parks, constructed of [[Pulhamite]] and [[Coade stone]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Freestone, "Forgotten but not lost: the secret of Coade Stone", Proceedings of the Geologist's Association 105: 141-143 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete as we know it today dates from the [[Portland cement#History|development of modern cement]] in 1756. Worldwide, the preparation of concrete adds at least 0.2 [[gigatonne]]s yearly to the atmosphere's [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] gas stock and, thereby affects Earth's [[Greenhouse Effect]]. In 2007, 7.5–8 cubic kilometers of concrete were created annually by humans.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Classification and theory==
The US geologist James Ross Underwood, Jr. advocated a fourth class of rocks to be added to Earth and planetary materials studies which would supplement [[geology]]'s long-identified [[igneous]], [[sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rocks|metamorphic]] groups.  His practical proposal for an "anthropic rocks" category recognizes the pervading spread of humankind and its industrial products.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Underwood, Jr., "Anthropic Rocks as a Fourth Basic Class", Environmental &amp; Engineering Geoscience VII: 104-110 (February 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Cathcart, R.B., ''Anthropic Rock: a brief history'', History of Geo- and Space Sciences, 2: 57-74 (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Future [[macro-engineering]] of the Earth may involve the total envelopment of the planet with, among other materials, concrete.&lt;ref&gt;Viorel Badescu and R.B. Cathcart, "Environmental thermodynamic limitations on global human population", International Journal of Global Energy Issues 25: 129-140 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
NASA and others have offered many settlement proposals that entail the use of in-situ resources of the Moon and Mars, such as [[brick]], by [[astronaut]]s.

The relatively inert nature of rocks has been exploited in many methods to immobilize [[chemical waste|chemical]] and/or [[radioactive waste]]s; the Australian researcher, [[A.E. Ringwood]], developed a titanate [[ceramic]] called [[Synroc]], his acronym for "synthetic rock".&lt;ref&gt;A.E. Ringwood, Safe Disposal of High-Level Nuclear Reactor Waste: A New Strategy (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;  D.J. Sheppard proposed Sun-orbiting space colonies, interplanetary and interstellar spaceships ought to be manufactured of concrete.&lt;ref&gt;D.J. Sheppard, "Concrete space colonies", Spaceflight 21: 3-8 (January 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;  There have also been proposals for deep-diving [[submarine]]s constructed of concrete&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=David |title=Fantastic Voyager |journal=New Scientist |pages=36-39 |date=9 March 2002 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17323334.600-fantastic-voyager}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[concrete ship]]s.

Alan Weisman in ''[[The World Without Us]]'' (2007) noted that anthropic rocks of all kinds, among other artifacts, will exist far into our planet's future even should our species disappear "tomorrow".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

'''''Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy''''' is a 2007 book by Washington State Governor [[Jay Inslee]] and researcher [[Bracken Hendricks]]. Inslee first proposed an [[Apollo program|Apollo]]-scale program, designed to galvanize the nation around the urgent goal of solving the environmental and energy crisis, in the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/opinion/100516_inslee19.shtml Seattle Post-Intelligencer], Dec. 19, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Inslee co-authored ''Apollo's Fire'', in which he says that through improved Federal policies the United States can wean itself off of its dependence on foreign oil and [[fossil fuel]], create millions of [[Green-collar worker]] jobs, and stop [[global warming]]. Along these lines, he has been a prominent supporter of the [[Apollo Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apolloalliance.org/resources_100mpg.php Inslee articles at the Apollo Alliance web page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081126233311/http://www.apolloalliance.org/resources_100mpg.php |date=2008-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Chapter 2:  Reinventing the car", ''Apollo's Fire'' highlights such innovative efforts such as [[CalCars]], founded in 2002 to promote [[plug-in hybrid]] [[electric car|electric vehicle]]s (PHEVs), charged by off-peak electricity from [[renewable energy]] sources, as a key to addressing [[oil dependence]] and [[global warming]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Inslee, Jay |author2=Bracken Hendricks | title = Apollo's Fire | year = 2007 | pages=36–40 | publisher = [[Island Press]], Washington, D.C. | isbn = 978-1-59726-175-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boschert"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sherry Boschert | title = Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that will Recharge America | year = 2006 | pages=49–66 | publisher = New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada| isbn = 978-0-86571-571-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of Electricity Producers''' (AEP) was a [[Industry trade group|trade association]] for the [[United Kingdom]] [[electricity]] market. It had approximately 90 members, including electricity generation companies and those offering support services.

==History==
The Association was founded in 1987 as the '''Association of Independent Electricity Producers''', with the initial remit of [[lobbying]] the UK government's [[Department of Energy (United Kingdom)|Department of Energy]] to remove restrictions on private companies operating within the electricity industry. The idea for the AIEP came from David Andrews who was an engineer promoting small scale [[Cogeneration|Combined Heat and Power]] - mini- CHP who was frustrated by the blatant attempts of the then [[Central Electricity Generating Board|CEGB]] to manipulate the market against mini-CHP. He called the first meeting held at Orchard Partners in London, then also active in promoting CHP, with John Macadam of Orchard Partners and Martin Alder then of [[Wessex Water]] and Trevor Dooley of [[Electrical Review]] who provided valuable initial publicity. Early on Andrews suggested that a contact, David Porter, who had a small desk top publishing business provide a newsletter - Porter went on to become the Director and Chief Executive.

===Electricity privatisation===
This early goal, against the CEGB, was achieved with the passing of the Electricity Act in 1989, and the subsequent full [[Privatization|privatisation]] of the industry (with the exception of [[nuclear power]]).

In 1995, recognising that little remained from which the organisation could be "independent", it changed its name to the Association of Electricity Producers. In 1999 it moved to its current offices in London. It used to be based further towards Pall Mall on Waterloo Place.

[[Image:Pylons - geograph.org.uk - 505107.jpg|thumb|Transmission towers near [[Harby, Nottinghamshire|Harby]] in [[Nottinghamshire]] ]]

==Structure==
The Association employed 12 staff. Its President was Sir [[Michael Spicer, Baron Spicer|Michael Spicer]] [[Member of Parliament#United_Kingdom|former MP]], and David Porter was its Chief Executive from 1991.

The UK electricity industry is worth £54 million, and directly employs 87,000 people.

== Merger ==

In April 2012, the Association of Electricity Producers merged with the Energy Retail Association and the UK Business Council for Sustainable Energy to become Energy UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energylivenews.com/2012/04/02/new-energy-trade-body-kicks-off/ New energy trade body kicks off] 2 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''axion''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|k|s|i|ɒ|n}}) is a hypothetical [[elementary particle]] postulated by the [[Peccei–Quinn theory]] in 1977 to resolve the [[strong CP problem]] in [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). If axions exist and have low mass within a specific range, they are of interest as a possible component of [[cold dark matter]].

==History==

===Prediction===
As shown by [[Gerard 't Hooft]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} [[strong interaction]]s of the standard model, QCD, possess a non-trivial vacuum structure that in principle permits violation of the combined symmetries of [[C-symmetry|charge conjugation]] and [[parity (physics)|parity]], collectively known as CP. Together with effects generated by [[weak interaction]]s, the effective periodic strong CP-violating term, {{overline|Θ}}, appears as a [[Standard Model]] input &amp;ndash; its value is not predicted by the theory, but must be measured. However, large CP-violating interactions originating from QCD would induce a large [[Neutron electric dipole moment|electric dipole moment (EDM) for the neutron]]. Experimental constraints on the currently unobserved EDM implies CP violation from QCD must be extremely tiny and thus {{overline|Θ}} must itself be extremely small. Since a priori {{overline|Θ}} could have any value between 0 and 2''π'', this presents a “naturalness” problem for the standard model. Why should this parameter find itself so close to 0? (Or, why should QCD find itself CP-preserving?) This question constitutes what is known as the [[strong CP problem]].

One simple solution exists: If at least one of the [[quarks]] of the standard model is massless,  {{overline|Θ}} becomes unobservable. However, empirical evidence strongly suggests that none of the quarks are massless.

In 1977, [[Roberto Peccei]] and [[Helen Quinn]] postulated a more elegant solution to the strong CP problem, the [[Peccei–Quinn theory|Peccei–Quinn mechanism]]. The idea is to effectively promote {{overline|Θ}} to a field. This is accomplished by adding a new global symmetry (called a [[Peccei–Quinn symmetry]]) that becomes spontaneously broken. This results in a new particle, as shown by [[Frank Wilczek]] and [[Steven Weinberg]], that fills the role of {{overline|Θ}}, naturally relaxing the CP-violation parameter to zero. This hypothesized new particle is called the axion. {{refn|name="pseudo-Nambu–Goldstone boson"|group=note|On a more technical note, the axion is the would-be [[Nambu–Goldstone boson]] that results from the spontaneously broken Peccei–Quinn symmetry. However, the non-trivial QCD vacuum effects (e.g., [[instantons]]) spoil the Peccei–Quinn symmetry explicitly and provide a small mass for the axion. Hence, the axion is actually a [[pseudo-Nambu–Goldstone boson]].}} The original Weinberg–Wilczek axion was ruled out. Current literature discusses the mechanism as the "invisible axion", which has two forms: KSVZ ([[Kim Jihn-eui|Kim]]–[[Mikhail Shifman|Shifman]]–[[Arkady Vainshtein|Vainshtein]]–{{nowrap|{{abbr|Zakharov|Valya Zakharov}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It had been thought that the invisible axion solves the 
strong CP problem without being amenable to verification by experiment. Axion models choose coupling that does not appear in any of the prior experiments. The very weakly coupled axion is also very light because axion couplings and mass are proportional. The situation changed when it was shown that a very light axion is overproduced in the early universe and therefore excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The axion is thus a dark-matter candidate, as well as a solution to the strong CP problem.

===Maxwell's equations with axion modifications===
If [[magnetic monopole]]s exist then there is a symmetry in Maxwell's equations where the electric and magnetic fields can be rotated into each other with the new fields still satisfying Maxwell's equations.  Luca Visinelli showed that the duality symmetry can be carried over to the axion-electromagnetic theory as well. Assuming the existence of both magnetic charges and axions, Maxwell's equations read

| &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot (\mathbf{B} + \frac{\kappa}{c} \theta \mathbf{E}) = \mu_0 \rho_m &lt;/math&gt;

| &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times (\mathbf{E} - c\kappa \theta \mathbf{B}) = -\partial_t ( \mathbf{B} + \frac{\kappa}{c} \theta \mathbf{E} ) - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m &lt;/math&gt;

|-
! scope="row" | Axion law
| &lt;math&gt; ( \Box + m_a^2) \theta = -\kappa \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

If [[magnetic monopole]]s do not exist, then the same equations hold with the density &lt;math&gt;\rho_m&lt;/math&gt; and current &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_m&lt;/math&gt; replaced by zero. Incorporating the axion has the effect of rotating the electric and magnetic fields into each other.

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{E'} \\
\mathbf{B'} \\
\end{pmatrix}
 = \frac{1}{\cos \xi} 
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos \xi &amp; c \sin \xi \\
-\frac{1}{c} \sin \xi &amp; \cos \xi \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{E} \\
\mathbf{B} \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;}}

where the mixing angle &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; depends on the coupling constant &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; and the axion field strength &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;
\tan \xi = -\kappa \theta
&lt;/math&gt;}}

By plugging the new values for electromagnetic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E'}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B'}&lt;/math&gt; into Maxwell's equations we obtain the axion-modified Maxwell equations above.  Incorporating the axion into the electromagnetic theory also gives a new differential equation – the axion law – which is simply the [[Klein-Gordon Equation]] (the quantum field theory equation for massive spin-zero particles) with an &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; source term.

In particular, several recent works have proposed axion-like particles as a solution to the apparent transparency of the Universe to TeV photons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.76.121301|arxiv=0707.4312|title=Evidence for a new light spin-zero boson from cosmological gamma-ray propagation?|year=2007|last1=De Angelis|first1=A.|last2=Mansutti|first2=O.|last3=Roncadelli|first3=M.|journal=Physical Review D|volume=76|issue=12|page=121301|bibcode=2007PhRvD..76l1301D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1745-3933.2008.00602.x|arxiv=0807.4246|title=Photon propagation and the very high energy gamma-ray spectra of blazars: How transparent is the Universe?|year=2009|last1=De Angelis|first1=A.|last2=Mansutti|first2=O.|last3=Persic|first3=M.|last4=Roncadelli|first4=M.|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters|volume=394|issue=1|pages=L21–L25|bibcode=2009MNRAS.394L..21D}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been demonstrated in a few recent works that, in the large magnetic fields threading the atmospheres of compact astrophysical objects (e.g., [[magnetar]]s), photons will convert much more efficiently. This would in turn give rise to distinct absorption-like features in the spectra detectable by current telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/1/1|title=Spectral Signatures of Photon-Particle Oscillations from Celestial Objects|year=2009|last1=Chelouche|first1=Doron|last2=Rabadan|first2=Raul|last3=Pavlov|first3=Sergey S.|last4 =Castejon|first4=Francisco|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series|volume=180|issue=1|pages=1–29|arxiv=0806.0411|bibcode=2009ApJS..180....1C}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new promising means is looking for quasi-particle refraction in systems with strong magnetic gradients. In particular, the refraction will lead to beam splitting in the radio light curves of highly magnetized pulsars and allow much greater sensitivities than currently achievable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/699/1/L5|arxiv=0810.3002|title=COSMIC ANALOGS OF THE STERN-GERLACH EXPERIMENT AND THE DETECTION OF LIGHT BOSONS|year=2009|last1=Chelouche|first1=Doron|last2=Guendelman|first2=Eduardo I.|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=699|issue=1|pages=L5–L8|bibcode=2009ApJ...699L...5C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Axion Observatory]] (IAXO) is a proposed fourth generation [[helioscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=CERN | title=The International Axion Observatory | url=http://iaxo.web.cern.ch/content/home-international-axion-observatory | access-date=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Axions may be produced within neutron stars, by nucleon-nucleon [[bremsstrahlung]]. The subsequent decay of axions to gamma rays allows constraints on the axion mass to be placed from observations of neutron stars in gamma-rays using the Fermi LAT. From an analysis of four neutron stars,  Berenji et al. obtained a 95% CL upper limit on the axion mass of 0.079 eV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Gaskins|first2=J.|last3=Meyer|first3=M.|year=2016|title=Constraints on axions and axionlike particles from Fermi Large Area Telescope observations of neutron stars|journal=Physical Review D|volume=93|issue=14|page=045019|arxiv=1602.00091|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.93.045019|first1=B.|last1=Berenji|bibcode = 2016PhRvD..93d5019B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible detection==

It was reported in 2014 that evidence for axions may have been detected as a seasonal variation in observed X-ray emission that would be expected from conversion in the Earth's magnetic field of axions streaming from the Sun. Studying 15 years of data by the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[XMM-Newton]] observatory, a research group at [[Leicester University]] noticed a seasonal variation for which no conventional explanation could be found. One potential explanation for the variation, described as "plausible" by the senior author of the paper, is the known seasonal variation in visibility to XMM-Newton of the sunward magnetosphere in which X-rays may be produced by axions from the Sun's core.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sample|first1=Ian|title=Dark matter may have been detected – streaming from sun’s core|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/oct/16/dark-matter-detected-sun-axions|website=www.theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FraserRead2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fraser|first1=G. W.|last2=Read|first2=A. M.|last3=Sembay|first3=S.|last4=Carter|first4=J.

Most importantly, the scattering in angle assumed by the Leicester group to be caused by magnetic field gradients during the photon production, necessary to allow the X-rays to enter the detector that cannot point directly at the sun, would dissipate the flux so much that the probability of detection would be negligible.&lt;ref name="RoncadelliTavecchio2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roncadelli|first1=M.|last2=Tavecchio|first2=F.|title=No axions from the Sun|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters|volume=450|issue=1|year=2015|pages=L26–L28|issn=1745-3925|doi=10.1093/mnrasl/slv040|arxiv = 1411.3297 |bibcode = 2015MNRAS.450L..26R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Christian Beck suggested that axions might be detectable in [[Josephson junctions]]; and in 2014, he argued that a signature, consistent with a mass ≈110&amp;nbsp;μeV, had in fact been observed in several preexisting experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.dark.2015.03.002 |arxiv = 1403.5676 |title=Axion mass estimates from resonant Josephson junctions |first=Christian |last=Beck |journal=Physics of the Dark Universe |volume = 7–8 |pages = 6–11 |date=2015 |bibcode = 2015PDU.....7....6B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 a theoretical team from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] devised a possible way of detecting axions using a strong magnetic field. The magnetic field need be no stronger than that produced in a [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scanning machine and it should show a slight wavering variation that is linked to the mass of the axion. The experiment is now being implemented by experimentalists at the university. Another approach being used by the [[University of Washington]] uses a strong magnetic field to detect the possible weak conversion of axions to [[microwave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-10-team-simulates-magnetar-dark-particle.html#nRlv|title=Team simulates a magnetar to seek dark matter particle|access-date=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==

=== Predictions ===
One theory of axions relevant to [[cosmology]] had predicted that they would have no [[electric charge]], a very small [[mass]] in the range from 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; to {{val|1|u=eV/c2}}, and very low interaction [[cross section (physics)|cross-sections]] for [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] forces. Because of their properties, axions would interact only minimally with ordinary matter. Axions would also change to and from [[photon]]s in magnetic fields.

=== Supersymmetry ===
In [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric theories]] the axion has both a scalar and a fermionic [[superpartner]]. The [[fermion]]ic superpartner of the axion is called the [[axino]], the scalar superpartner is called the [[saxion]] or [[dilaton]].
They are all bundled up in a [[chiral superfield]].

The [[axino]] has been predicted to be the [[lightest supersymmetric particle]] in such a model.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmological implications ===
Inflation suggests that axions were created abundantly during the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Redondo |first1 = J. |last2 = Raffelt |first2 = G. |last3 = Viaux Maira |first3 = N. |year = 2012 |title = Journey at the axion meV mass frontier |url = http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/375/2/022004 |journal = [[Journal of Physics: Conference Series]] |volume = '''375''' 022004 |issue = 2 |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/375/1/022004 |page=022004|bibcode = 2012JPhCS.375b2004R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of a unique coupling to the [[instanton]] field of the primordial [[universe]] (the "[[misalignment mechanism]]"), an effective [[dynamical friction]] is created during the acquisition of mass following [[cosmic inflation]]. This robs all such primordial axions of their kinetic energy.

If axions have low mass, thus preventing other decay modes (since there's no lighter particles to decay into), theories{{which|date=May 2016}} predict that the universe would be filled with a very cold [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] of primordial axions. Hence, axions could plausibly explain the [[dark matter]] problem of [[physical cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=0909.0949|last1=Sikivie|first1=P|title=Dark matter axions|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A|volume=25|issue=2n03|pages=554–563|year=2009|doi=10.1142/S0217751X10048846|bibcode=2010IJMPA..25..554S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observational studies are underway, but they are not yet sufficiently sensitive to probe the mass regions if they are the solution to the dark matter problem. High mass axions of the kind searched for by Jain and Singh (2007)&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Jain, G. Singh, ''Search for new particles decaying into electron pairs of mass below 100 ''MeV''/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys., '''34''', 129–138, (2007); {{doi|10.1088/0954-3899/34/1/009}}, (possible early evidence of 7±1 and 19±1 MeV axions of less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; s lifetime).&lt;/ref&gt; would not persist in the modern universe. Moreover, if axions exist, scatterings with other particles in the thermal bath of the early universe unavoidably produce a population of hot axions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salvio |title=Thermal axion production|journal=JCAP |volume=2014 |issue=1 |pages=11 |url=http://inspirehep.net/record/1262100|arxiv = 1310.6982|bibcode = 2014JCAP...01..011S |doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2014/01/011 |year=2014|first1=Alberto|last2=Strumia|first2=Alessandro|last3=Xue|first3=Wei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low mass axions could have additional structure at the galactic scale.{{why|date=May 2016}} If they continuously fall into galaxies from the intergalactic medium, they would be denser in "[[Caustic (mathematics)|caustic]]" rings, just as the stream of water in a continuously-flowing fountain is thicker at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/548855-tz8W8A/webviewable/ P. Sikivie, "Dark matter axions and caustic rings"]&lt;/ref&gt; The gravitational effects of these rings on galactic structure and rotation might then be observable.&lt;ref&gt;P. Sikivie (personal website):  [http://www.phys.ufl.edu/~sikivie/triangle/ pictures] of alleged triangular structure in Milky Way; hypothetical [http://www.phys.ufl.edu%2F~tanner%2FAxions2010%2FDuffy_Axions2010.pdf flow diagram]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} which could give rise to such a structure.&lt;/ref&gt; Other cold dark matter theoretical candidates, such as [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMP]]s and [[MACHO]]s, could also form such rings, but because such candidates are [[fermion]]ic and thus experience friction or scattering among themselves, the rings would be less pronounced.

Axions would also have stopped interaction with normal matter at a different moment than other more massive dark particles.{{why|date=May 2016}} The lingering effects of this difference could perhaps be calculated and observed astronomically.

João G. Rosa and Thomas W. Kephart suggested that axion clouds formed around unstable [[primordial black hole]]s might initiate a chain of reactions that irradiate electromagnetic waves, allowing their detection. When adjusting the mass of the axions to explain [[dark matter]], the pair discovered that the value would also explain the luminosity and wavelength of [[fast radio burst]]s, being a possible origin for both phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Rosa |first1 = João G. |last2 = Kephart |first2 = Thomas W. |year = 2018 |title = Stimulated axion decay in superradiant clouds around primordial black holes |journal = Physical Review Letters |volume = 120 |issue = 23 |pages = 231102 |arxiv=1709.06581|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.231102 |pmid = 29932720 |bibcode = 2018PhRvL.120w1102R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Boston Stone''' is a stone in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Near —but not on— the [[Freedom Trail]], it is a minor tourist attraction.

The stone, a flattened sphere about {{convert|2|ft|m}} in diameter,&lt;ref name=wikimapia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wikimapia.org/9108840/The-Boston-Stone-and-Marshall-Street |title=The Boston Stone and Marshall Street (Boston, Massachusetts) |work=Wikimapia |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}{{Verify credibility|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; hollowed out on one side,&lt;ref name=city_record/&gt; is embedded in the foundation of a building on Marshall Street (a narrow alley named for Thomas Marshall, captain of a ferry to [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] in the late 17th century)&lt;ref name=weston/&gt; in the [[Blackstone Block Historic District]]. Below the stone is a [[plinth]] inscribed "Boston Stone 1737". There is no plaque and no further elucidation, and the Boston Stone has no official status.

==History==
[[File:Boston Stone (line drawing).jpg|thumb|left|19th century line drawing of the Boston Stone]]
The stone was originally a [[millstone]] used for grinding paint pigments. It was imported from England in 1635&lt;ref name=weston&gt;{{cite book |last=Weston |first=George F. |title=Boston Ways: High, By, and Folk |year=1957 |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=9780807051818}} cited in {{cite web |url=http://forgotten-boston.com/alleys/blackstone/creeksq.html |title=(untitled) |editor=Kevin Walsh |date= |work=Forgotten Boston |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1700&lt;ref name=wikimapia/&gt;&lt;ref name=celebrate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.celebrateboston.com/sites/boston-stone.htm |title=Boston Stone |work=Boston Travel Guide |publisher=Celebrate Boston |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}{{Verify credibility|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the painter Tom Childs.&lt;ref name=weston/&gt; in 1836, the stone was recovered while the foundations for the present building were being dug, and was placed in the brick wall in the building that still stands today.&lt;ref name=weston/&gt;

According to popular legend and some sources, the stone is the geographic center of Boston, as it was used in colonial times by surveyors as the zero point for outlying milestones showing the distance to Boston, analogous to the [[London Stone]],&lt;ref name=wikimapia/&gt;&lt;ref name=waymarking&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMD800_The_Boston_Stone_Boston_MA |title=The Boston Stone - Boston, MA |date=December 3, 2011 |work=Waymarking |publisher=Groundspeak |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}{{Verify credibility|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is almost certainly not true&lt;ref name=city_record&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bostonhistory.typepad.com/notes_on_the_urban_condit/2006/02/the_boston_ston.html |title=The Boston Stone and Marshall Street |date=February 7, 2006 |work=The City Record and Boston News-Letter |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}{{Verify credibility|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – there are no contemporary records indicating this, the [[1767&amp;nbsp;Milestones]] stretching from Boston to [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] are not based on the Boston Stone, and the [[Old State House (Boston)|Old State House]] would have been a more likely center point for measuring distances to the city.&lt;ref name=city_record/&gt; 19th-century advertising for the Marshall House inn describes the original inscribing of the Boston Stone's plinth, and perhaps its attribution as Boston's zero milestone, as an early 19th-century advertising ploy.&lt;ref name=city_record/&gt;  Nonetheless, the 1921 [[Rand, McNally]] guide to the city opined that it was probably set up to provide directions to nearby shops in imitation of the London Stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/randmcnallybosto07newy/randmcnallybosto07newy_djvu.txt|title=Rand, McNally Boston guide to the city and environs, with maps and illustrations|date=1921|publisher=Rand, McNally}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand''' or '''CBOD''' is a method defined test measured by the depletion of dissolved oxygen by biological organisms in a body of water in which the contribution from nitrogenous bacteria has been suppressed. CBOD is a method defined parameter is widely used as an indication of the pollutant removal from [[wastewater]]. It is listed as a conventional pollutant in the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]].

== The CBOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; test ==

The CBOD tests have the widest application in measuring waste loadings to treatment plants and in evaluating the CBOD-removal efficiency of such treatment systems. The test measures the molecular oxygen utilized during a specified incubation period for the biochemical degradation of organic material (carbonaceous demand) and the oxygen used to oxidize inorganic material such as sulfides and ferrous iron. It also may measure the amount of oxygen used to oxidize reduced forms of nitrogen (nitrogenous demand) unless their oxidation is prevented by an inhibitor. The seeding and dilution procedures provide an estimate of the CBOD at pH 6.5 to 7.5.

There are two recognized EPA methods for the measurement of CBOD:

== Dissolved oxygen probes: Membrane and luminescence ==

Since the publication of a simple, accurate and direct dissolved oxygen analytical procedure by Winkler,&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, L. W. (1888). "Die zur Bestimmung des in Wasser gelösten Sauerstoffes " Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft 21(2): 2843-2854.&lt;/ref&gt; the analysis of dissolved oxygen levels for water has been key to the determination of surface water purity and ecological wellness. The Winkler method is still one of only two analytical techniques used to calibrate oxygen electrode meters; the other procedure is based on oxygen solubility at saturation as per [[Henry's law]]. Though many researchers have refined the Winkler analysis to dissolved oxygen levels in the low PPB range, the method does not lend itself to automation.

The development of an analytical instrument that utilizes the reduction-oxidation (redox) chemistry of oxygen in the presence of dissimilar metal electrodes was introduced during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Kemula, W. and S. Siekierski (1950). "Polarometric determination of oxygen." Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. 15: 1069-75.&lt;/ref&gt; This redox electrode utilized an oxygen-permeable membrane to allow the diffusion of the gas into an electrochemical cell and its concentration determined by polarographic or galvanic electrodes. This analytical method is sensitive and accurate down to levels of ± 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/l dissolved oxygen. Calibration of the redox electrode of this membrane electrode still requires the use of the Henry’s law table or the [[Winkler test for dissolved oxygen]].

During the last two decades,{{When|date=May 2013}} a new form of electrode was developed based on the luminescence emission of a photo-active chemical compound and the quenching of that emission by oxygen. This quenching photophysics mechanism is described by the Stern–Volmer equation for dissolved oxygen in a solution:&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Fresnadillo, D., M. D. Marazuela, et al. (1999). "Luminescent Nafion Membranes Dyed with Ruthenium(II) Complexes as Sensing Materials for Dissolved Oxygen." Langmuir 15(19): 6451-6459.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math chem&gt;I_0/I~=~1~+~K_{SV}~[\ce{O2}]&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;: Luminescence in the presence of oxygen
* &lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt;: Luminescence in the absence of oxygen
* &lt;math&gt;K_{SV}&lt;/math&gt;: Stern-Volmer constant for oxygen quenching
* &lt;chem&gt;[O2]&lt;/chem&gt;: Dissolved oxygen concentration

The determination of oxygen concentration by luminescence quenching has a linear response over a broad range of oxygen concentrations and has excellent accuracy and reproducibility.&lt;ref&gt;Titze, J., H. Walter, et al. (2008). "Evaluation of a new optical sensor for measuring dissolved oxygen by comparison with standard analytical methods." Monatsschr. Brauwiss.(Mar./Apr.): 66-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method summary ==

Bring the sample to ambient room temperature. If pH of sample is &lt;6.5 or &gt;7.5 neutralize the sample to approximately a pH of 7.0 using either sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide. Aliquots of the neutralized sample are transferred to 300 mL CBOD bottles. These CBOD samples must be at concentrations that will deplete by at least 2&amp;nbsp;mg/L dissolved oxygen (DO) and have at least 1&amp;nbsp;mg/L DO left after five days of incubation. Therefore, make enough dilutions (minimum of 3) of the prepared sample to bracket the predicted CBOD.

The minimum aliquot volume transferred to a 300 mL CBOD bottle will be 3 mL as set by Standard Methods. If a smaller volume is needed to meet the DO depletion requirements, then you must make dilutions to the sample.  Add approximately 0.1 g of Nitrification Inhibitor (2-chloro-6-(trichloro-methyl) pyridine) to each 300mL CBOD bottle before adding CBOD dilution water. If the sample is being prepared as a seeded sample, add enough prepared seed to the sample to achieve acceptable dissolved oxygen depletion. Add CBOD Dilution water to each CBOD sample bottle so as to completely fill the bottle with no air spaces or bubbles when the stopper is placed in the bottle.

Place the dissolved oxygen probe in the bottle and allow the dissolved oxygen meter to come to equilibrium. Allow the meter to come to equilibrium prior to accepting dissolved oxygen value. Record the DO of the sample, stopper the bottle, add DI water to the water seal if needed, cap the water seal, and incubate for 5 days at 20&amp;nbsp;°C ± 1&amp;nbsp;°C. Exclude light to avoid growth of algae in the bottles during incubation.

Upon completion of the 5-day incubation± 6 hours, record the DO of the depleted samples with a calibrated DO meter. Allow the meter to come to equilibrium prior to accepting dissolved oxygen value. Calculate the CBODs from the formula below. Only bottles, including seed controls, giving a minimum DO depletion of 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L and a residual DO of at least 1.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L after 5 days of incubation are considered to produce valid data, because at least 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg oxygen uptake per L is required to give a meaningful measure of oxygen uptake and at least 1.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L must remain throughout the test to ensure that insufficient DO does not affect the rate of oxidation of waste constituents.

== Bacterial seed CBOD correction ==

Seed CBOD Uptake: Typically a 10, 20, and 30 mL sample of seed added to 3 separate CBOD bottles with approximately 0.1 g Nitrification Inhibitor and diluted with CBOD dilution water. Run these QC samples with each batch of seeded CBOD. Calculate the DO uptake per mL of seed added to each bottle using either the slope method or the ratio method.

For the slope method, plot DO depletion in milligrams per liter versus mLs of seed for all seed control bottles having a 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L depletion and 1.0 minimum residual DO. The plot should present a straight line for which the slope indicates DO depletion per mL of seed. The DO-axis intercept is oxygen depletion caused by the dilution water and should be less than 0.20&amp;nbsp;mg/L.

For the ratio method, divide the DO depletion by the volume of seed in mLs for each seed control bottle having a 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L depletion and greater than 1.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L minimum residual DO and average the results.

== CBOD seed ==

The CBOD test is method defined. Factors such as bacterial seed viability, anoxic stress during the 5 days, and nitrogenous inhibition efficacy will produce method variability between duplicates, analysts and laboratories. Clear quality assurance and quality control limits must be developed to produce valid results.

== Sample toxicity ==

Wastewater by definition may contain pollutants that inhibit bacterial seed metabolisms or are toxic to the seed. In these cases, all samples should be seeded with a known amount of viable bacteria for the MBOD analysis. Toxicity or inhibition is observed in CBOD analysis when the calculated CBOD increases with progressive dilutions of the sample.

== Appropriate microbial population ==

Selection of a viable microbial population for the CBOD analysis is key in obtaining valid results. The bacterial population needs both carbonaceous and nitrogenous strains present. Sources of viable bacterial seed can be primary clarifier effluent, non-disinfected secondary clarifier effluent or a commercial seed preparation. Each source should have clear quality assurance and quality control requirements set by the glucose-glutamic acid check sample.

== Glucose-glutamic acid check sample ==

Transfer a known amount of glucose-glutamic acid solution to a CBOD bottle and add sufficient seed to achieve acceptable dissolved oxygen depletion. Fill CBOD bottle with CBOD dilution water and nitrification inhibitor. Determine the 5 Day CBOD. Passing results will have a CBOD of 198 (+ 30.5) mg/L. Run these check samples with each batch of CBOD samples. It is important to realize that glucose-glutamic acid is not intended to be an accuracy check in the test.  Its sole purpose is to demonstrate that the seed is viable and metabolizing in the proper range of activity under the conditions of the test.

== Regulatory use ==

In order to reduce a wastewater plants BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; values to meet regulatory compliance requirements, some plant operators try to suppress [[nitrification]] when they are not required to meet ammonia limits. This practice usually results in increased effluent toxicity and oxygen demand on the receiving waters. Therefore, to eliminate this situation and because the BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; test is not reflective of effluent quality under nitrifying conditions, the wastewater plant should:

# Perform parallel CBOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; tests to indicate whether there is a problem with BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; compliance due to nitrification in the BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; test results and that the CBOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is not directly correlated with the BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; test results, and
# Baseline wastewater plant influent and effluent ammonia, nitrite and nitrate data (same frequency and duration as the parallel CBOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; data) have been provided to perform mass balances for nitrification inhibition. 
The results of these analysis can show that CBOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; should be utilized for regulatory compliance with wastewater discharge requirements.

A '''current source''' is an [[electronic circuit]] that delivers or absorbs an [[electric current]] which is independent of the voltage across it.

A current source is the [[duality (electrical circuits)|dual]] of a [[voltage source]]. The term ''current sink'' is sometimes used for sources fed from a negative voltage supply. Figure 1 shows the schematic symbol for an ideal current source driving a [[electrical load|resistive load]]. There are two types. An ''independent current source'' (or sink) delivers a constant current. A ''dependent current source'' delivers a current which is proportional to some other voltage or current in the circuit.

An '''ideal current source''' generates a current that is independent of the voltage changes across it. An ideal current source is a [[mathematical model]], which real devices can approach very closely. If the current through an ideal current source can be specified independently of any other variable in a circuit, it is called an ''independent'' current source. Conversely, if the current through an ideal current source is determined by some other voltage or current in a circuit, it is called a '''dependent''' or '''controlled current source'''. Symbols for these sources are shown in Figure 2.

The [[internal resistance]] of an ideal current source is infinite. An independent current source with zero current is identical to an ideal [[open circuit (disambiguation)|open circuit]]. The voltage across an ideal current source is completely determined by the circuit it is connected to. When connected to a [[short circuit]], there is zero voltage and thus zero [[electric power|power]] delivered. When connected to a [[load resistance]], the voltage across the source approaches infinity as the load resistance approaches infinity (an open circuit). 

No physical current source is ideal.  For example, no physical current source can operate when applied to an open circuit.  There are two characteristics that define a current source in real life.  One is its internal resistance and the other is its compliance voltage.  The compliance voltage is the maximum voltage that the current source can supply to a load.  Over a given load range, it is possible for some types of real current sources to exhibit nearly infinite internal resistance.  However, when the current source reaches its compliance voltage, it abruptly stops being a current source.

In circuit analysis, a current source having finite internal resistance is modeled by placing the value of that resistance across an ideal current source (the Norton equivalent circuit).  However, this model is only useful when a current source is operating within its compliance voltage.

==Implementations==

===Passive current source===
The simplest non-ideal current source consists of a [[voltage source]] in series with a resistor. The amount of current available from such a source is given by the [[ratio]] of the voltage across the voltage source to the resistance of the resistor ([[Ohm's law]]; I = V/R). This value of current will only be delivered to a load with zero voltage drop across its terminals (a short circuit, an uncharged capacitor, a charged inductor, a virtual ground circuit, etc.) The current delivered to a load with nonzero voltage (drop) across its terminals (a linear or nonlinear resistor with a finite resistance, a charged capacitor, an uncharged inductor, a voltage source, etc.) will always be different. It is given by the ratio of the voltage drop across the resistor (the difference between the exciting voltage and the voltage across the load) to its resistance. For a nearly ideal current source, the value of the resistor should be very large but this implies that, for a specified current, the voltage source must be very large (in the limit as the resistance and the voltage go to infinity, the current source will become ideal and the current will not depend at all on the voltage across the load). Thus, efficiency is low (due to power loss in the resistor) and it is usually impractical to construct a 'good' current source this way. Nonetheless, it is often the case that such a circuit will provide adequate performance when the specified current and load resistance are small. For example, a 5&amp;nbsp;V voltage source in series with a 4.7 kilohm resistor will provide an ''approximately'' constant current of {{nowrap|1 mA ± 5%}} to a load resistance in the range of 50 to 450&amp;nbsp;ohm.

A [[Van de Graaff generator]] is an example of such a high voltage current source. It behaves as an almost constant current source because of its very high output voltage coupled with its very high output resistance and so it supplies the same few microamperes at any output voltage up to hundreds of thousands of volts (or even tens of [[megavolt (disambiguation)|megavolt]]s) for large laboratory versions.

===Active current sources without negative feedback===
In these circuits the output current is not monitored and controlled by means of [[negative feedback]].

====Current-stable nonlinear implementation====
They are implemented by active electronic components (transistors) having current-stable nonlinear output characteristic when driven by steady input quantity (current or voltage). These circuits behave as dynamic resistors changing their present resistance to compensate current variations. For example, if the load increases its resistance, the transistor decreases its present output resistance (and ''[[vice versa]]'') to keep up a constant total resistance in the circuit.

Active current sources have many important applications in [[electronic circuit]]s. They are often used in place of ohmic [[resistor]]s in analog [[integrated circuit]]s (e.g., a [[differential amplifier#Long-tailed pair|differential amplifier]]) to generate a current that depends slightly on the voltage across the load.

The [[common emitter]] configuration driven by a constant input current or voltage and [[common source]] ([[common cathode]]) driven by a constant voltage naturally behave as current sources (or sinks) because the output impedance of these devices is naturally high. The output part of the simple [[current mirror]] is an example of such a current source widely used in [[integrated circuits]]. The [[common base]], [[common gate]] and [[common grid]] configurations can serve as constant current sources as well.

A [[JFET]] can be made to act as a current source by tying its gate to its source. The current then flowing is the {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;DSS&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the FET. These can be purchased with this connection already made and in this case the devices are called [[constant current diode|current regulator diodes]] or constant current diodes or current limiting diodes (CLD). An enhancement mode N channel MOSFET can be used in the circuits listed below.

====Following voltage implementation====
An example: [[Bootstrapping (electronics)|bootstrapped]] current source.&lt;ref&gt;Widlar [http://www.national.com/an/AN/AN-29.pdf bilateral current source] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607174643/http://www.national.com/an/AN/AN-29.pdf |date=2011-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Voltage compensation implementation====
[[Image:V-to-i op-amp current source 1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Figure 3: In an op-amp ''voltage-controlled current source'' the op-amp compensates the voltage drop across the load by adding the same voltage to the exciting input voltage.]]

The simple [[#Passive current source|resistor passive current source]] is ideal only when the voltage across it is 0; so voltage compensation by applying parallel negative feedback might be considered to improve the source. Operational amplifiers with feedback effectively work to minimise the voltage across their inputs. This results in making the inverting input a [[virtual ground]], with the current running through the feedback, or load, and the passive current source. The input voltage source, the resistor, and the op-amp constitutes an "ideal" current source with value, {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''V''&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''}}. The op-amp voltage-to-current converter in Figure 3, a [[current-to-voltage converter#Op-amp implementation|transimpedance amplifier]] and an [[operational amplifier applications#Inverting amplifier|op-amp inverting amplifier]] are typical implementations of this idea.

The floating load is a serious disadvantage of this circuit solution.

====Current compensation implementation====
A typical example are Howland current source&lt;ref&gt;

The input voltage source and the resistor R constitute an imperfect current source passing current, {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;}} through the load (Fig. 3 in the source). The INIC acts as a second current source passing "helping" current, {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;−R&lt;/sub&gt;}}, through the load. As a result, the total current flowing through the load is constant and the circuit impedance seen by the input source is increased. However the Howland current source isn't widely used because it requires the four resistors to be perfectly matched, and its impedance drops at high frequencies.&lt;ref name="Horowitz2"&gt;

The grounded load is an advantage of this circuit solution.

===Current sources with negative feedback===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
They are implemented as a voltage follower with series negative feedback driven by a constant input voltage source (i.e., a ''negative feedback voltage stabilizer''). The voltage follower is loaded by a constant (current sensing) resistor acting as a simple [[current-to-voltage converter]] connected in the feedback loop. The external load of this current source is connected somewhere in the path of the current supplying the current sensing resistor but out of the feedback loop.

The voltage follower adjusts its output current {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;}} flowing through the load so that to make the voltage drop {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''I''&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;''R''}} across the current sensing resistor R equal to the constant input voltage {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Thus the voltage stabilizer keeps up a constant voltage drop across a constant resistor; so, a constant current {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''V''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;/''R'' {{=}} ''V''&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''}} flows through the resistor and respectively through the load.

If the input voltage varies, this arrangement will act as a [[voltage-to-current converter]] (voltage-controlled current source, VCCS); it can be thought as a reversed (by means of negative feedback) current-to-voltage converter. The resistance R determines the transfer ratio ([[transconductance]]).

Current sources implemented as circuits with series negative feedback have the disadvantage that the voltage drop across the current sensing resistor decreases the maximal voltage across the load (the ''compliance voltage'').

====Simple transistor current sources====

=====Constant current diode=====
[[File:Current limiting diode - internal structure.svg|thumb|150px|The internal structure of a current limiting diode]]
The simplest constant-current source or sink is formed from one component: a [[JFET]] with its gate attached to its source. Once the drain-source voltage reaches a certain minimum value, the JFET enters saturation where current is approximately constant. This configuration is known as a [[constant-current diode]], as it behaves much like a dual to the constant voltage diode ([[Zener diode]]) used in simple voltage sources.

Due to the large variability in saturation current of JFETs, it is common to also include a source resistor (shown in the adjacent image) which allows the current to be tuned down to a desired value.

=====Zener diode current source=====
[[Image:const cur src 111.svg|thumb|Figure 4: Typical BJT constant current source with negative feedback]]

In this [[bipolar junction transistor]] (BJT) implementation (Figure 4) of the general idea above, a ''Zener voltage stabilizer'' (R1 and DZ1) drives an ''emitter follower'' (Q1) loaded by a ''constant emitter resistor'' (R2) sensing the load current. The external (floating) load of this current source is connected to the collector so that almost the same current flows through it and the emitter resistor (they can be thought of as connected in series). The transistor, Q1, adjusts the output (collector) current so as to keep the voltage drop across the constant emitter resistor, R2, almost equal to the relatively constant voltage drop across the Zener diode, DZ1. As a result, the output current is almost constant even if the load resistance and/or voltage vary. The operation of the circuit is considered in details below.

A [[Zener diode]], when reverse biased (as shown in the circuit) has a constant [[voltage drop]] across it irrespective of the [[current (electricity)|current]] flowing through it. Thus, as long as the Zener current ({{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;}}) is above a certain level (called holding current), the voltage across the Zener [[diode]] ({{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;}}) will be constant. Resistor, R1, supplies the Zener current and the base current ({{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}}) of NPN [[transistor]] (Q1). The constant Zener voltage is applied across the base of Q1 and emitter resistor, R2.

Voltage across R2 ({{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;R2&lt;/sub&gt;}}) is given by {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt; − ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the base-emitter drop of Q1. The emitter current of Q1 which is also the current through R2 is given by
:&lt;math&gt;I_\text{R2} (= I_\text{E} = I_\text{C}) = \frac{V_\text{R2}}{R_\text{R2}} = \frac{V_\text{Z} - V_\text{BE}}{R_\text{R2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;}} is constant and {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;}} is also (approximately) constant for a given temperature, it follows that {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;R2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is constant and hence {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;}} is also constant. Due to [[transistor]] action, emitter current, {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is very nearly equal to the collector current, {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;}}, of the transistor (which in turn, is the current through the load). Thus, the load current is constant (neglecting the output resistance of the transistor due to the [[Early effect]]) and the circuit operates as a constant current source. As long as the temperature remains constant (or doesn't vary much), the load current will be independent of the supply voltage, R1 and the transistor's gain. R2 allows the load current to be set at any desirable value and is calculated by
:&lt;math&gt;R_\text{R2} = \frac{V_\text{Z} - V_\text{BE}}{I_\text{R2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;}} is typically 0.65&amp;nbsp;V for a silicon device.&lt;ref&gt;The value for {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;''}} varies logarithmically with current level: for more detail see [[diode modelling]].&lt;/ref&gt;

({{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;R2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is also the emitter current and is assumed to be the same as the collector or required load current, provided {{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;FE&lt;/sub&gt;}} is sufficiently large). Resistance, {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;R1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, at resistor, R1, is calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;R_\text{R1} = \frac{V_\text{S} - V_\text{Z}}{I_\text{Z} + K \cdot I_\text{B}}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''K''}} = 1.2 to 2 (so that {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;R1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is low enough to ensure adequate {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}}),
:&lt;math&gt;I_\text{B} = \frac{I_\text{C}}{h_{FE,\text{min}}}&lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;FE,min&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the lowest acceptable current gain for the particular transistor type being used.

=====LED current source=====
[[Image:const cur src 113.svg|thumb|Figure 5: Typical constant current source (CCS) using LED instead of Zener diode]]

The Zener diode can be replaced by any other diode; e.g., a [[light-emitting diode]] LED1 as shown in Figure 5. The LED voltage drop ({{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;}}) is now used to derive the constant voltage and also has the additional advantage of tracking (compensating) {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;}} changes due to temperature. {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;R2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;R_\text{R2} = \frac {V_\text{D} - V_\text{BE}}{I_\text{R2}}&lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} as
:&lt;math&gt;R_\text{R1} = \frac{V_\text{S} - V_\text{D}}{I_\text{D} + K \cdot I_\text{B}}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''I''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is the LED current

=====Transistor current source with diode compensation=====
[[Image:const cur src 112.svg|thumb|Figure 6: Typical constant current source (CCS) with diode compensation]]

Temperature changes will change the output current delivered by the circuit of Figure 4 because {{math|V&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;}} is sensitive to temperature. Temperature dependence can be compensated using the circuit of Figure 6 that includes a standard diode, D, (of the same semiconductor material as the transistor) in series with the Zener diode as shown in the image on the left. The diode drop ({{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;}}) tracks the {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;}} changes due to temperature and thus significantly counteracts temperature dependence of the CCS.

Resistance {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is now calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;R_2 = \frac{V_\text{Z} + V_\text{D} - V_{BE}}{I_\text{R2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0.65 V}},&lt;ref name="Seeabove"&gt;See above note on logarithmic current dependence.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_2 = \frac{V_\text{Z}}{I_\text{R2}}&lt;/math&gt;

(In practice, {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;}} is never exactly equal to {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;}} and hence it only suppresses the change in {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;}} rather than nulling it out.)

{{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;R_1 = \frac{V_\text{S} - V_\text{Z} - V_\text{D}}{I_\text{Z} + K \cdot I_\text{B}}&lt;/math&gt;

(the compensating diode's forward voltage drop, {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;}}, appears in the equation and is typically 0.65&amp;nbsp;V for silicon devices.&lt;ref name="Seeabove" /&gt;)

This method is most effective for [[Zener diode]]s rated at 5.6&amp;nbsp;V or more. For breakdown diodes of less than 5.6&amp;nbsp;V, the compensating diode is usually not required because the [[electrical breakdown|breakdown]] mechanism is not as temperature dependent as it is in breakdown diodes above this voltage.

=====Current mirror with emitter degeneration=====
Series negative feedback is also used in the [[two-port network#Example: bipolar current mirror with emitter degeneration|two-transistor current mirror with emitter degeneration]]. Negative feedback is a basic feature in some [[current mirror]]s using multiple transistors, such as the [[Widlar current source]] and the [[Wilson current source]].

=====Constant current source with thermal compensation=====
One limitation with the circuits in Figures 5 and 6 is that the thermal compensation is imperfect. In bipolar transistors, as the junction temperature increases the {{math|V{{sub|be}}}} drop (voltage drop from base to emitter) decreases. In the two previous circuits, a decrease in {{math|V{{sub|be}}}} will cause an increase in voltage across the emitter resistor, which in turn will cause an increase in collector current drawn through the load. The end result is that the amount of 'constant' current supplied is at least somewhat dependent on temperature. This effect is mitigated to a large extent, but not completely, by corresponding voltage drops for the diode, D1, in Figure 6, and the LED, LED1, in Figure 5. If the power dissipation in the active device of the CCS is not small and/or insufficient emitter degeneration is used, this can become a non-trivial issue.

Imagine in Figure 5, at power up, that the LED has 1&amp;nbsp;V across it driving the base of the transistor. At room temperature there is about 0.6&amp;nbsp;V drop across the {{math|''V''{{sub|be}}}} junction and hence 0.4&amp;nbsp;V across the emitter resistor, giving an approximate collector (load) current of {{math|0.4/R{{sub|e}}}} amps. Now imagine that the power dissipation in the transistor causes it to heat up. This causes the {{math|''V''{{sub|be}}}} drop (which was 0.6&amp;nbsp;V at room temperature) to drop to, say, 0.2&amp;nbsp;V. Now the voltage across the emitter resistor is 0.8&amp;nbsp;V, twice what it was before the warmup. This means that the collector (load) current is now twice the design value! This is an extreme example of course, but serves to illustrate the issue.

[[File:Ограничение извести с помощью NPN-транзисторов.png|thumb|left|200px|Current limiter with NPN transistors]]

The circuit to the left overcomes the thermal problem (see also, [[current limiting]]).  To see how the circuit works, assume the voltage has just been applied at V+. Current runs through R1 to the base of Q1, turning it on and causing current to begin to flow through the load into the collector of Q1. This same load current then flows out of Q1's emitter and consequently through {{math|R{{sub|sense}}}} to ground. When this current through {{math|R{{sub|sense}}}} to ground is sufficient to cause a voltage drop that is equal to the {{math|V{{sub|be}}}} drop of Q2, Q2 begins to turn on. As Q2 turns on it pulls more current through its collector resistor, R1, which diverts some of the injected current in the base of Q1, causing Q1 to conduct less current through the load. This creates a negative feedback loop within the circuit, which keeps the voltage at Q1's emitter almost exactly equal to the {{math|V{{sub|be}}}} drop of Q2. Since Q2 is dissipating very little power compared to Q1 (since all the load current goes through Q1, not Q2), Q2 will not heat up any significant amount and the reference (current setting) voltage across {{math|R{{sub|sense}}}} will remain steady at ~0.6&amp;nbsp;V, or one diode drop above ground, regardless of the thermal changes in the {{math|V{{sub|be}}}} drop of Q1. The circuit is still sensitive to changes in the ambient temperature in which the device operates as the BE voltage drop in Q2 varies slightly with temperature.

====Op-amp current sources====
[[Image:Op-amp current source with pass transistor.svg|thumb|Figure 7: Typical op-amp current source.]]

The simple transistor current source from Figure 4 can be improved by inserting the base-emitter junction of the transistor in the feedback loop of an op-amp (Figure 7). Now the op-amp increases its output voltage to compensate for the {{math|V&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;}} drop. The circuit is actually a buffered non-inverting amplifier driven by a constant input voltage. It keeps up this constant voltage across the constant sense resistor. As a result, the current flowing through the load is constant as well; it is exactly the Zener voltage divided by the sense resistor. The load can be connected either in the emitter (Figure 7) or in the collector (Figure 4) but in both the cases it is floating as in all the circuits above. The transistor is not needed if the required current doesn't exceed the sourcing ability of the op-amp. The article on [[current mirror#Feedback assisted current mirror|current mirror]] discusses another example of these so-called ''gain-boosted'' current mirrors.

[[Image:LM317 1A ConstCurrent.svg|thumb|350px|right|Figure 8: Constant current source using the [[LM317]] voltage regulator]]

====Voltage regulator current sources====
The [[#Current sources with series negative feedback|general negative feedback arrangement]] can be implemented by an IC voltage regulator ([[LM317|LM317 voltage regulator]] on Figure 8). As with the bare [[#Simple transistor current sources|emitter follower]] and the precise [[#...with series negative feedback...|op-amp follower]] above, it keeps up a constant voltage drop (1.25 V) across a constant resistor (1.25&amp;nbsp;Ω); so, a constant current (1&amp;nbsp;A) flows through the resistor and the load. The LED is on when the voltage across the load exceeds 1.8&amp;nbsp;V (the indicator circuit introduces some error). The grounded load is an important advantage of this solution.

====Curpistor tubes====
Nitrogen-filled glass tubes with two electrodes and a calibrated [[Becquerel]] (fissions per second) amount of [[radium-226|&lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra]] offer a constant number of charge carriers per second for conduction, which determines the maximum current the tube can pass over a voltage range from 25 to 500&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tubedata.milbert.com/sheets/127/c/CH1027.pdf |title= Tung-Sol: ''Curpistor, minute current regulator'' data sheet |format=PDF |accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current and voltage source comparison==
Most sources of electrical energy ([[mains electricity]], a [[battery (electricity)|battery]], etc.) are best modeled as [[voltage source]]s. Such sources provide constant voltage, which means that as long as the current drawn from the source is within the source's capabilities, its output [[voltage]] stays constant. An ideal voltage source provides no energy when it is loaded by an [[open circuit (disambiguation)|open circuit]] (i.e., an infinite [[electrical impedance|impedance]]), but approaches infinite power and current when the [[load resistance]] approaches zero (a [[short circuit]]). Such a theoretical device would have a zero [[ohm (unit)|ohm]] [[output impedance]] in series with the source. A real-world voltage source has a very low, but non-zero [[output impedance]]: often much less than 1 ohm.

Conversely, a current source provides a constant current, as long as the load connected to the source terminals has sufficiently low impedance. An ideal current source would provide no energy to a short circuit and approach infinite energy and voltage as the [[load resistance]] approaches infinity (an open circuit). An ''ideal'' current source has an [[Infinity|infinite]] [[output impedance]] in parallel with the source. A ''real-world'' current source has a very high, but finite [[output impedance]]. In the case of transistor current sources, impedances of a few [[megohm]]s (at DC) are typical.

An ''ideal'' current source cannot be connected to an ''ideal'' open circuit because this would create the paradox of running a constant, non-zero current (from the current source) through an element with a defined zero current (the open circuit). Also, a current source should not be connected to another current source if their currents differ but this arrangement is frequently used (e.g., in amplifying stages with dynamic load, [[CMOS]] circuits, etc.)

Similarly, an ''ideal'' [[voltage source]] cannot be connected to an ''ideal'' [[short circuit]] (R = 0), since this would result a similar paradox of finite non-zero voltage across an element with defined zero voltage (the short circuit). Also, a voltage source should not be connected to another voltage source if their voltages differ but again this arrangement is frequently used (e.g., in [[common base]] and differential amplifying stages).

Contrary, current and voltage sources can be connected to each other without any problems, and this technique is widely used in circuitry (e.g., in [[cascode|cascode circuits]], [[differential amplifier#Long-tailed pair|differential amplifier stages]] with common emitter current source, etc.)

Because no ideal sources of either variety exist (all real-world examples have finite and non-zero source impedance), any current source can be considered as a voltage source with the ''same'' [[source impedance]] and vice versa. These concepts are dealt with by [[Norton's theorem|Norton's]] and [[Thévenin's theorem]]s.

Charging of capacitor by constant current source and by voltage source is different. Linearity is maintained for constant current source charging of capacitor with time, whereas voltage source charging of capacitor is exponential with time. This particular property of constant current source helps for proper signal conditioning with nearly zero reflection from load.

A '''Geissler tube'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricstuff.co.uk/geissler.html Geissler tubes]&lt;/ref&gt; is an early [[gas discharge tube]] used to demonstrate the principles of electrical [[glow discharge]], similar to modern [[neon lighting]]. The tube was invented by the [[Germany|German]] physicist and glassblower [[Heinrich Geissler]] in 1857.  It consists of a sealed, partially [[vacuum|evacuated]] glass cylinder of various shapes with a metal [[electrode]] at each end, containing rarefied gasses such as [[neon]], [[argon]], or [[air]]; [[mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor or other [[conductive]] [[fluids]]; or ionizable [[minerals]] or [[metal]]s, such as [[sodium]]. When a [[high voltage]] is applied between the electrodes, an [[electrical current]] flows through the tube. The current dissociates electrons from the gas molecules, creating [[ion]]s, and when the electrons recombine with the ions, the gas emits light by [[fluorescence]]. The color of light emitted is characteristic of the material within the tube, and many different colors and lighting effects can be achieved.  The first [[gas-discharge lamp]]s, Geissler tubes were novelty items, made in many artistic shapes and colors to demonstrate the new science of electricity.  In the early 20th century, the technology was commercialized and evolved into [[neon lighting]].





==Application==
[[Image:Geissler spectrum tube.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|Straight Geissler tubes filled with various gases]]
Geissler tubes were mass-produced from the 1880s as novelty and entertainment devices, with various spherical chambers and decorative serpentine paths formed into the glass tube. Some tubes were very elaborate and complex in shape and would contain chambers within an outer casing.  A novel effect could be obtained by spinning a glowing tube at high speed with a motor; a disk of color was seen due to [[persistence of vision]].  When an operating tube was touched by the hand the shape of the glowing discharge inside often changed, due to the capacitance of the body. 

Simple straight Geissler tubes were used in early-20th-century scientific research as high voltage indicators.  When a Geissler tube was brought near a source of high voltage alternating current such as a [[Tesla coil]] or [[Ruhmkorff coil]], it would light up even without contact with the circuit.  They were used to tune the [[tank circuit]]s of [[radio transmitter]]s to resonance.    Another example of their use was to find [[node (physics)|node]]s of [[standing wave]]s on [[transmission line]]s, such as [[Lecher line]]s used to measure the frequency of early radio transmitters.  

Another use around 1900 was as the light source in Pulfrich [[refractometer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]] Vol X 1922 p6533 Refractometer&lt;/ref&gt;

Geissler tubes are sometimes still used in physics education to demonstrate the principles of [[gas discharge tube]]s.

==Influence==
Geissler tubes were the first [[gas discharge tube]]s, and have had a large impact on the development of many instruments and devices which depend on electric discharge through gases.

One of the most significant consequences of Geissler tube technology was the discovery of the [[electron]] and the invention of electronic [[vacuum tube]]s.  By the 1870s better vacuum pumps enabled scientists to evacuate Geissler tubes to a higher vacuum; these were called [[Crookes tube]]s after [[William Crookes]].  When current was applied, it was found that the glass envelope of these tubes would glow at the end opposite to the cathode.  Observing that sharp-edged shadows were cast on the glowing tube wall by obstructions in the tube in front of the cathode, [[Johann Hittorf]] realized that the glow was caused by some type of ray travelling in straight lines through the tube from the cathode.  These were named [[cathode ray]]s.  In 1897 [[J. J. Thomson]] showed that cathode rays consisted of a previously unknown particle, which was named the ''[[electron]]''.  The technology of controlling electron beams resulted in the invention of the amplifying [[vacuum tube]] in 1907, which created the field of ''[[electronics]]'' and dominated it for 50 years, and the [[cathode ray tube]] which was used in [[radar]] and [[television]] displays.

Some of the devices which evolved from Geissler tube technology:
*[[Vacuum tube]]s
*[[Xenon flash lamp]]s (for flash photography)
*[[Xenon arc lamp]]s (for [[Movie projector|movie]] and [[IMAX]] projectors)
*[[X-ray]] tubes
*[[Sodium vapor lamp]]s used in streetlights
*[[Neon sign|"Neon" signs]], which use both visible light discharge from [[neon]] and other gases and phosphor excitation from [[ultraviolet light]]
*[[Mercury vapor lamp]]s
*[[Mass spectrometer]]s
*[[Cathode ray tube]]s, employed in the [[oscilloscope]] and later in [[television set]]s, [[radar]], and [[computer display]] devices
*[[Electrotachyscope]] (an early moving picture display device)
*[[Fluorescent lamp]]s
*[[Plasma globe]]s

[[File:The Gold Standard logo.svg|thumb|The Gold Standard logo]]
'''The Gold Standard''', or '''Gold Standard for the Global Goals''', is a [[Standardization|standard]] and logo [[certification mark]] program for non-governmental emission reductions projects in the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) [[Joint Implementation]] (JI) and [[Voluntary Carbon Market]]. It is published and administered by the Gold Standard Foundation, a non-profit foundation headquartered in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. It was designed with an intent to ensure that carbon credits are not only real and verifiable but that they make measurable contributions to sustainable development worldwide. Its objective is to add branding, with a logo label, to existing and new [[Carbon Credit]]s generated by projects which can then be bought and traded by countries that have a binding legal commitment according to the [[Kyoto Protocol]].

== History ==
The Gold Standard for CDM (GS CER) was developed in 2003 by [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF), SouthSouthNorth, and Helio International. '''The Voluntary Gold Standard''' (GS VER), a methodology for use within the [[carbon emissions trading|voluntary carbon market]], was launched in May 2006. The programs were created following a 12-month consultation period that included workshops and web-based consultation conducted by an independent Standards Advisory Board composed of [[NGO]]s, scientists, project developers and government representatives.

The Gold Standard certification program is open to any non-government, community-based organization, especially those with an interest in the promotion of sustainable development or a focus on climate and energy issues. As of October 2018, more than 80 non-profit organizations internationally had officially endorsed the Gold Standard program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who We Are |url=https://www.goldstandard.org/our-story/who-we-are |website=The Gold Standard |accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is administered by the Gold Standard Foundation, a non-profit foundation under [[:Category:Swiss law|Swiss law]] that is headquartered in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.goldstandard.org/contact |title=Contact |website=The Gold Standard |accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also employs local experts in [[Brazil]], [[India]] and [[South Africa]].

In July 2008 the Gold Standard Version 2.0 was released with sets of guidelines and manuals on the GS requirements, toolkits and other supporting documents to be used by project developers and DOEs. This relegated the previously applicable manuals to Version 1.0. The Version 2.0 also supports [[Program of Activities (PoA)]].

In July 2017, a new version called the Gold Standard for the Global Goals was released, superseding previous Gold Standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New Standard Launched to Accelerate and Measure Progress Toward the Sustainable Development Goals and Climate Targets |url=https://www.goldstandard.org/blog-item/new-standard-launched-accelerate-and-measure-progress-toward-sustainable-development-goals 
|date=10 July 2017 |publisher=Gold Standard Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarly Recognition  &amp; Critique==
The Gold Standard is recognized by [[carbon market]] and [[climate change]] politics scholars as a prime instance of the group of voluntary standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = S. | last2 = Betsill | first2 = M. | last3 = Hoffmann | first3 = M. | last4 = Paterson | first4 = M. | year = 2010 | title = A Tale of Two Copenhagens: Carbon Markets and Climate Governance. | doi = 10.1177/0305829810372480 | journal = Millennium - Journal of International Studies| volume = 39 | issue = 1| pages = 161–173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent empirical evidence for how the Gold Standard is actually performing is rare. Existing evidence suggests that the Gold Standard does not always effectively police companies' misuse of the standard's label (making it difficult to know whether carbon credits associated with the Gold Standard labels have undergone the Gold Standard certification process).&lt;ref&gt;Lippert, I. (2013). [http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bvb:384-opus4-21997 ''Enacting Environments: An Ethnography of the Digitalisation and Naturalisation of Emissions'']. PhD thesis, Augsburg University, Philosophisch-Sozialwissenschaftliche Fakultät, Augsburg. See Pages 522-527.&lt;/ref&gt; As a program certifying [[emissions trading]] programs, criticisms of the general practice of emissions trading may also generally apply to the Gold Standard certification program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blok | first1 = A | year = 2010 | title = Topologies of climate change: actor-network theory, relational-scalar analytics, and carbon-market overflows | doi = 10.1068/d0309 | journal = Environment and Planning D: Society and Space | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 896–912 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eligibility ==
To be eligible for Gold Standard Certification, a project must:

# Be an approved{{by whom|date=August 2018}} [[Renewable Energy]] Supply or End use [[Efficient energy use|Energy Efficiency]] Improvement project type
# Be reducing one of the three eligible Green House Gases: Carbon Dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), Methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and Nitrous Oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)
# Not employ [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) under the condition that the credits coming out of the project are transferred to the donor country
# Not be applying for other certifications, to ensure there is no double counting of credits
# Demonstrate its additionality by using the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]]'s (UNFCCC) Large Scale Additionality Tool;&lt;ref&gt;http://cdm.unfccc.int/Reference/tools/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; and show that the project is not a 'business-as-usual' scenario
# Make a net-positive contribution to the economic, [[Natural environment|environmental]] and social welfare of the local population that hosts it

== The Gold Standard Registry ==

Status of projects that apply for Gold Standard can be tracked on its registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.goldstandard.org/project-developers/our-project-registry |title=Project Registry |accessdate=2018-08-22 |website=Gold Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Project Developers, Designated Operational Entities (DOEs) (also known as Validators), and Traders can open accounts with the registry. There are various publicly available reports [http://www.markit.com/sites/en/products/environmental/markit-environmental-registry-public-view.page].

==Energy efficiency==
{{main|Energy efficiency in transport}}
Cars with similar production of energy costs can obtain, during the life of the car (operational phase), large reductions in energy costs through several measures:

* The most significant is by using [[alternative propulsion]]:
** An efficient engine that reduces the vehicle's consumption of [[petroleum]] (i.e. [[petroleum electric hybrid vehicle]]), or that uses [[renewable energy]] sources throughout its working life.
** Using [[biofuel]]s instead of petroleum fuels.
* Proper maintenance of a vehicle such as engine [[wikt:tune-up|tune-up]]s, [[oil change]]s, and maintaining proper [[tire pressure]] can also help.
* Removing unnecessary items from a vehicle reduces weight and improves fuel economy as well.

{{Further information|Alternative fuel vehicle}}
Green vehicles include vehicles types that function fully or partly on alternative energy sources other than [[fossil fuel]] or less carbon intensive than gasoline or diesel.

Another option is the use of [[alternative fuel]] composition in conventional fossil fuel-based vehicles, making them function partially on renewable energy sources. Other approaches include [[personal rapid transit]], a [[public transport]]ation concept that offers automated, on-demand, non-stop transportation on a network of specially built guideways.

===Electric and fuel cell-powered===
{{See also| Electric vehicle|Plug-in hybrid}}
Examples of vehicles with reduced petroleum consumption include [[electric car]]s, [[plug-in hybrid]]s and [[fuel cell]]-powered [[hydrogen car]]s.

[[Electric car]]s are typically more efficient than [[fuel cell]]-powered vehicles on a [[Tank-to-wheel]] basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/display_data/twentyfirstcenturycar.pdf |title=Energy efficiency comparison article |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014073730/http://www.teslamotors.com/display_data/twentyfirstcenturycar.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have better [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] than conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles but are hampered by [[All-electric range|range]] or maximum distance attainable before discharging the battery.

===Hybrid electric vehicles===
{{See also| Hybrid vehicle}}
[[Hybrid car]]s may be partly fossil fuel (or biofuel) powered and partly electric or hydrogen-powered. Most combine an internal combustion engine with an electric engine, though other variations too exist. The internal combustion engine is often either a gasoline or Diesel engine (in rare cases a Stirling engine may even be used&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.precer.com/Technology.html Precer's BioRacer Stirling engine-electric hybrid]&lt;/ref&gt;). They are more expensive to purchase but cost redemption is achieved in a period of about 5 years due to better fuel economy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite news | title = Consumer Reports Revises Financial Analysis In Report on Ownership Costs for Hybrid Cars | date = 7 March 2006 | publisher = Consumers Union | url = http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cu-press-room/pressroom/archive/2006/04/eng0604ehv.htm | work = Consumer Reports | accessdate = 2007-04-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070921103910/http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cu-press-room/pressroom/archive/2006/04/eng0604ehv.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/new-cars/high-cost-of-hybrid-vehicles-406/overview/index.htm | title = The dollars &amp; sense of hybrid cars }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compressed air cars, stirling vehicles, and others===
{{See also| Compressed-air vehicle| Compressed air car}}

[[Compressed air car]]s, [[Zero-emissions vehicle|stirling-powered]] vehicles, [[Liquid nitrogen vehicle]]s are even less polluting than electrical vehicles, as the vehicle and its components can be made more environmentally friendly.

[[Solar car racing|Solar car races]] are held on a regular basis in order to promote green vehicles and other "[[environmental technology|green technology]]". These sleek driver-only vehicles can travel long distances at highway speeds using only the electricity generated instantaneously from the sun.

===Improving conventional cars===
[[File:Brazilian Fiat Siena TetraFuel four views.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Fiat Siena|Fiat Siena Tetrafuel]] 1.4 is a [[multifuel]] car designed to run as a [[flex-fuel]] on [[gasoline]], or [[w:Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E20, E25|E20–E25 blend]], or neat ethanol ([[Neat alcohol fuel|E100]]); or to run as a [[bi-fuel vehicle|bi-fuel]] with [[Compressed natural gas|natural gas (CNG)]].]]
{{Main|Biofuel|compressed natural gas|clean diesel}}
{{See also|Volkswagen emissions scandal}}
A conventional vehicle can become a greener vehicle by mixing in [[renewable fuel]]s or using less carbon intensive [[fossil fuel]]. Typical [[gasoline]]-powered cars can tolerate up to 10% [[alcohol fuel|ethanol]]. Brazil manufactured cars that run on neat ethanol, though there were discontinued. Another available option is a [[flexible-fuel vehicle]] which allows any blend of gasoline and ethanol, up to 85% in North America and Europe, and up to 100% in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dual Fuel Cars Revive Brazil's Alcohol Industry
|url=http://www.tierramerica.net/2003/0825/iacentos.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another existing option is to convert a conventional gasoline-powered to allow the alternative use of [[compressed natural gas|CNG]]. [[Pakistan]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Iran]], [[India]], [[Italy]], and [[China]] have the largest fleets of [[natural gas vehicle]]s in the world.&lt;ref name=IANGV&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iangv.org/tools-resources/statistics.html |title=Natural Gas Vehicle Statistics |publisher=International Association for Natural Gas Vehicles |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110101111/http://www.iangv.org/tools-resources/statistics.html |archivedate=2010-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[diesel fuel|Diesel]]-powered vehicles can often transition completely to [[biodiesel]], though the fuel is a very strong [[solvent]], which can occasionally damage [[rubber]] seals in vehicles built before 1994. More commonly, however, biodiesel causes problems simply because it removes all of the built-up residue in an engine, clogging [[filter (chemistry)|filter]]s, unless care is taken when switching from dirty fossil-fuel derived diesel to bio-diesel. It is very effective at 'de-coking' the diesel engines combustion chambers and keeping them clean. Biodiesel is the lowest emission fuel available for diesel engines. Diesel engines are the most efficient car internal combustion engines. Biodiesel is the only fuel allowed in some North American national parks because spillages will completely bio-degrade within 21 days. Biodiesel and [[vegetable oil fuel]]led, diesel engined vehicles have been declared amongst the greenest in the US ''Tour de Sol'' competition.

This presents problems, as biofuels can use food resources in order to provide mechanical energy for vehicles. Many experts point to this as a reason for growing food prices, particularly US Bio-ethanol fuel production which has affected maize prices. In order to have a low environmental impact, biofuels should be made only from waste products, or from new sources like [[algae fuel|algae]].
&lt;!--This section needs to be expanded to include clean diesel (lower emissions and higher fuel economy) and the new breed of gasoline high fuel efficient vehicles, otherwise this article will be duplicating the content of alternative fuel vehicles--&gt;

===Other===
{{Further information|Personal rapid transit}}
[[File:Borealis3windmills.jpg|thumb|right|[[Solar vehicle]] ]]

* [[Public transportation]] vehicles are not usually included in the green vehicle category, but [[Personal rapid transit]] (PRT) vehicles probably should be. All vehicles that are powered from the track have the advantage of potentially being able to use any source of electric energy, including sustainable ones, rather than requiring liquid fuels. They can also switch regenerative braking energy between vehicles and the electric grid rather than requiring energy storage on the vehicles. Also, they can potentially use the entire track area for solar collectors, not just the vehicle surface. The potential [[Personal rapid transit#Energy efficiency|PRT energy efficiency]] is much higher than that which traditional automobiles can attain.
* [[Solar vehicle]]s are [[electric vehicle]]s powered by [[solar power|solar energy]] obtained from [[solar panel]]s on the surface (generally, the roof) of the vehicle. [[Photovoltaic]] (PV) cells convert the Sun's energy directly into [[electrical energy]]. Solar vehicles are not practical day-to-day transportation devices at present, but are primarily demonstration vehicles and engineering exercises, often sponsored by government agencies. However, some cities have begun offering [[solar bus|solar-powered buses]], including the [[Tindo]] in [[Adelaide|Adelaide, Australia]].
* [[Wind-powered land vehicle|Wind-powered electric vehicles]] primarily use wind-turbines installed at a strategic point of the vehicle, which are then converted into electric energy which causes the vehicle to propel.

==Animal powered vehicles==
[[Horse and carriage]] are just one type of animal propelled vehicle. Once a common form of transportation, they became far less common as cities grew and automobiles took their place. In dense cities, the waste produced by large numbers of transportation animals was a significant health problem. Oftentimes the food is produced for them using diesel powered tractors, and thus there is some environmental impact as a result of their use.

==Human powered vehicles==
[[File:Vélo'v station 5002 - Place des Compagnons de la chanson.jpg|thumb|[[Vélo'v]] [[bicycle sharing system]] in [[Lyon]], [[France]] ]]
{{See also|Bicycle sharing system}}
Human powered transport includes walking, [[bicycle]]s, [[velomobile]]s, [[row boat]]s, and other environmentally friendly ways of getting around. In addition to the health benefits of the exercise provided, they are far more environmentally friendly than most other options. The only downside is the speed limitations, and how far one can travel before getting exhausted.

===Health===
Vehicle pollutants have been linked to human ill health including the incidence of respiratory and cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer. A 1998 report estimated that up to 24,000 people die prematurely each year in the UK as a direct result of air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/index.htm |title=Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) |publisher=Advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[World Health Organization]], up to 13,000 deaths per year among children (aged 0–4 years) across Europe are directly attributable to outdoor pollution. The organization estimates that if pollution levels were returned to within EU limits, more than 5,000 of these lives could be saved each year.

In general, results differ vastly dependent on the region considered, due to difference in energy sources to produce electricity that fuels electric vehicles. When considering only CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, it is noted that production of electric cars generate about twice as much emissions as that of internal combustion cars.&lt;ref name="GreenComparisonIndustrialEcology" /&gt; However, emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during operation are much larger (on average) than during production. For electric cars, emissions caused during operation depend on energy sources used to produce electricity and thus vary a lot geographically. Studies suggest that when taking into account both production and operation, electric cars would cause more emissions in economies where production of electricity is not clean, e.g., it is mostly coal based.&lt;ref name="GreenComparisonShrink" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GreenComparisonScientific" /&gt;. For this reason, some studies found that driving electric cars is less environmentally damaging in western US states than in eastern ones, where less electricity is produced using cleaner sources. Similarly, in countries like India, Australia or China, where large portion of electricity is produced by using coal, driving electric vehicles would cause larger environmental damage than driving petrol vehicles. When justifying use of electric cars over petrol cars, these kinds of studies do not provide sufficiently clear results. Environmental impact is calculated based on fuel mix used to produce electricity that powers electric cars. However, when a gas vehicle is replaced by an equivalent electric vehicle, additional power must be installed in electrical grid. This additional capacity would normally not be based on the same ratios of energy sources ("clean" versus fossil fuels) than the current capacity. Only when additional electricity production capacity installed to switch from petrol to electric vehicles would predominantly consist of clean sources, switch to electric vehicles could reduce environmental damage. Another common problem in methodology used in comparative studies is that it only focuses on specific kinds of environmental impact. While some studies focus only on emission of gas pollutants over life cycle or only on greenhouse gas emissions such as CO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;, comparison should also account for other environmental impacts such as pollutants released otherwise during production and operation or ingredients that can not be effectively recycled.&lt;ref name="ElectricEnvironmentImpact"&gt; {{cite web |author=Lizzie Wade | url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/teslas-electric-cars-might-not-green-think/ | title=Tesla’s Electric Cars Aren’t as Green as You Might Think | work= | publisher=Wired | date=31 March 2016 |isbn= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919145112/https://www.wired.com/2016/03/teslas-electric-cars-might-not-green-think/ | archive-date=2017-09-19 | access-date=2017-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include use of lighter high performing metals, lithium batteries and more rare metals in electric cars, which all have high environmental impact.

A study that also looked at factors other than energy consumption and carbon emissions has suggested that there is no such thing as an environmentally friendly car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eco-logica.co.uk/pdf/wtpp17.3.pdf |author=Tziovaras, T.

The use of vehicles with increased fuel efficiency is usually considered positive in the short term but criticism of any hydrocarbon-based personal transport remains.  The [[Jevons paradox]] suggests that energy efficiency programs are often counter-productive, even increasing energy consumption in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.03.020|last=Alcott |first=Blake |title=Jevons' paradox|journal=Ecological Economics |date=July 2005 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=9–21|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VDY-4G7GFMG-1/2/5da4f921421a31032f8fcd6971b0e177 |accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many environmental researchers believe that [[sustainable transport]] may require a move away from hydrocarbon fuels and from our present automobile and highway paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==National and international promotion==

===European Union===
The [[European Union]] is promoting the marketing of greener cars via a combination of binding and non-binding measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/Article?tcmuri=tcm:29-117504-16&amp;type=LinksDossier |title=Green cars &amp;#124; EU - European Information on Sustainable Dev |publisher=EurActiv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2010, 15 of the 27 [[member states of the European Union]] provide tax incentives for [[Plug-in electric vehicle|electrically chargeable vehicles]] and some [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s, which includes all [[Western Europe]]an countries except [[Italy]] and [[Luxembourg]], plus the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Romania]]. The incentives consist of tax reductions and exemptions, as well as of bonus payments for buyers of [[electric car]]s, [[plug-in hybrid]]s, [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s and [[natural gas vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name=GCC0420&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/04/acea-tax-20100421.html#more|title=Growing Number of EU Countries Levying CO2 Taxes on Cars and Incentivizing Plug-ins|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2010-04-21|accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACEA2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acea.be/index.php/news/news_detail/an_increasing_number_of_member_states_levy_co2_based_taxation_or_incentivis/|title=An Increasing Number of Member States Levy CO2-Based Taxation or Incentivise Electric Vehicles|publisher=[[European Automobile Manufacturers Association]]|date=2010-04-21|accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is promoting the marketing of greener cars via the [[SmartWay]] program. The SmartWay and SmartWay Elite designation mean that a vehicle is a better environmental performer relative to other vehicles. This US EPA designation is arrived at by taking into account a vehicle's Air Pollution Score and Greenhouse Gas Score. Higher Air Pollution Scores indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts of pollutants that cause smog relative to other vehicles. Higher Greenhouse Gas Scores indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts of carbon dioxide and have improved fuel economy relative to other vehicles.

To earn the SmartWay designation, a vehicle must earn at least a 6 on the Air Pollution Score and at least a 6 on the Greenhouse Gas Score, but have a combined score of at least 13. SmartWay Elite is given to those vehicles that score 9 or better on both the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Scores.

A Green Vehicle Marketing Alliance, in conjunction with the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ONRL), periodically meets, and coordinates marketing efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edf.org/documents/3687_GVMA_Report_0304.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - GVMA Report to ORNL, March 2004.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progressive Insurance Automotive X Prize==
The Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE (PIAXP) is a set of competitions, programs and events, from the [[X PRIZE Foundation]] to "inspire a new generation of super-efficient vehicles that help break America's addiction to oil and stem the effects of climate change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|page=5|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X PRIZE Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|archivedate=1 August 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Progressive Corporation|Progressive Insurance]] is the title sponsor of the prize, the centerpiece of which is the Competition Division, within which a $10 million purse will be divided between the winners of three competitions.

The essence of each competition is to design, build and race super-efficient vehicles that will achieve 100 [[Miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent|MPGe]] (2.35 liter/100 kilometer) and can be produced for the mass market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auto X Prize Revs Up|url=http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/03/30/107615.aspx|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|first=Alan|last=Boyle|accessdate=2008-09-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808121425/http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/03/30/107615.aspx|archivedate=2008-08-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the Competition Division, there are two vehicle classes: Mainstream and Alternative. The mainstream class has a prize of $5 million. The alternate class has 2 separate prizes of $2.5 million, one for side-by-side seating and one for tandem seating.&lt;ref name="guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=progressiveautoxprize.org|accessdate=2009-05-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|archivedate=2009-08-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the competitors, such as Aptera and Tesla, are already taking deposits for 'green' vehicles from customers.

[[File:Heelstone Ditch &amp; Scroll Trench.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1923 Excavation of Heelstone Ditch]]

'''Heelstone Ditch''' is a roughly circular feature surrounding the [[Heelstone]] at [[Stonehenge]]. It is not known if there was an intended relationship between the ditch and the heelstone although it is likely that the stone was in place either before or at the same time as the ditch.&lt;ref name="Stonehenge in Its Landscape"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cleal|first1=M J|title=Stonehenge in Its Landscape: 20th Century Excavations|year=1999|publisher=English Heritage|isbn=978-1-85074-605-8|authorlink=The stone settings, phase 3|author2=K E Walker and R Montague|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has steep sloping sides which end at a narrow flat base, and is approximately 4 ft (1.2m) deep and 3.5 ft (1.1m) wide. It is some 12 ft (3.7m) from base the base of the Heelstone, with  a diameter of roughly 32 ft (9.7m). A broad [[Arc (geometry)|arcing]] [[trench]] found in 1923 by [[William Hawley|Lt-Col William Hawley]] 9 ft (2.7m) wide cuts this ditch from the West, deepening towards the stone. Against the Heelstone Ditch (inside circle) is rammed chalk filled Stonehole 97, whose missing stone is known as Heelstone's twin although it is possible that the stone in Stonehole 97 was moved and is now the stone known as the Heelstone. The ditch was probably dug after the stone in Stonehole 97 was moved but possibly before that.

Only a small part of the Heelstone Ditch, immediately behind the [[Highways Agency]] A344 roadside fence, now remains unexplored or undisturbed. General nature of the ditch and fill described in 1979 by Michael W. Pitts, ''et al.'' [http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba.html], compares well with Hawley's (1923, 1925).{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The '''Hornslet Wind Turbine Collapse''' was a spectacular collapse of a [[wind turbine]] on February 22, 2008. It is one of only a few structural collapses that have been captured on film.

==Description of wind turbine==
The collapsed wind turbine was a Nordtank NKT 600-180/43 with a maximum generation capacity of 600&amp;nbsp;kW at Hornslet, Denmark at {{Coord|56|20|42.97|N|10|10|13.03|E|type:landmark|name=Hornslet Wind Turbine, which collapsed}}. It was operated by Syddjurs and inaugurated on December 23, 1996. The rotor of this turbine, which carried in the Danish wind turbine register the designation 570715000000021503, had a diameter of 43 metres. It was mounted on a free-standing steel-tube tower 44.5 metres above ground.

The collapsed wind turbine was the first and northernmost turbine of Hyacintvej Wind Park, which consists of five similar wind turbines, arranged in a line running south-southeastly - north-northwesterly.

==Accident==
After a malfunction from a worn brake mechanism, a service team from [[Vestas]] were called. Vestas engineers checked and repaired the wind turbine brake on the morning of February 22, 2008. At the last routine inspection it was noted that the main gear of the turbine was also making unusual noises and a sophisticated endoscopic inspection of the gear was planned, but as result of its high cost it was not undertaken immediately.

After repair and several checks of the brake, the turbine was restarted in order to bring it back into normal operation. At this time the wind was very strong. The airbrakes at the tip of the blades were turned on to control the speed of the turbine before it reached operational speed. After its generator was synchronized to the grid a noise from the nacelle prompted an attempt to stop the turbine manually.
 
A large crashing sound occurred, possibly as a result of the gear failing, at which point the turbine began to oscillate strongly. The rotor then suddenly stopped but immediately started turning again. The rotor did not at first turn very fast, but it was now impossible to control the speed of rotation.

The tower was evacuated immediately, the airbrakes of the turbine had failed and as a strong wind blew the turbine started rotating faster and faster quickly reaching a speed far beyond its design tolerances. Service personnel contacted the police who established a security cordon of 400 metres around the turbine. 2.5 hours later, at about 3:20 pm, the blades began to disintegrate. One of the blades hit halfway along the tower which bent in the direction of the wind. The top half of the tower then sheared off at the bend and fell to the ground. The base of the tower remained standing. The debris of the turbine flew 200–500 metres away. No injuries were caused. 

The collapse was filmed from a nearby farmhouse. The film was shown on several TV stations and is available online. The turbine was out of service until June 2008 and was eventually replaced by a new wind turbine of the same design.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Hutchinson metric''' is a function which [[metric (mathematics)|measures]] "the discrepancy between two [[image]]s for use in [[fractal]] [[image processing]]" and "can also be applied to describe the similarity between [[DNA]] sequences expressed as real or complex [[genomic]] signals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drakopoulos |first=V. |last2=Nikolaou |first2=N.

==Formal definition==
Consider only nonempty, [[compact space|compact]], and finite [[metric space]]s. For a space &lt;math&gt;X &lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;P(X) &lt;/math&gt; denote the space of Borel probability measures on &lt;math&gt;X &lt;/math&gt;, with 

:&lt;math&gt;\delta : X \rightarrow P(X) &lt;/math&gt; 

the embedding associating to &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; the point measure &lt;math&gt;\delta_x &lt;/math&gt;. The support &lt;math&gt;|\mu| &lt;/math&gt; of a measure  in P(X) is the smallest closed subset of measure 1. 

If 

:&lt;math&gt;f : X_1 \rightarrow X_2 &lt;/math&gt; 

is [[Borel measure|Borel measurable]] then the induced map 

:&lt;math&gt;f_* : P(X_1) \rightarrow P(X_2) &lt;/math&gt; 

associates to &lt;math&gt;\mu &lt;/math&gt; the measure &lt;math&gt; f_*(\mu) &lt;/math&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt;f_*(\mu)(B)= \mu(f^{-1}(B)) &lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;B &lt;/math&gt; Borel in &lt;math&gt;X_2 &lt;/math&gt;.

Then the '''Hutchinson metric''' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;d(\mu_1,\mu_2)=\sup \left \lbrace \int u(x) \, \mu_1(dx) - \int u(x) \, \mu_2(dx) \right \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\sup&lt;/math&gt; is taken over all real-valued functions ''u'' with [[Lipschitz constant]]
&lt;math&gt;\le 1 \,.&lt;/math&gt;  

Then &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt;/math&gt; is an [[isometric embedding]] of &lt;math&gt;X &lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;P(X) &lt;/math&gt;, and if 

:&lt;math&gt;f : X_1 \rightarrow X_2 &lt;/math&gt; 

is Lipschitz then 

:&lt;math&gt;f_* : P(X_1) \rightarrow P(X_2) &lt;/math&gt; 

is Lipschitz with the same Lipschitz constant.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/117923 "Invariant Measures for Set-Valued Dynamical Systems"] Walter Miller; Ethan Akin ''Transactions of the American Mathematical Society'', Vol. 351, No. 3. (March 1999), pp. 1203–1225] &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ikom monoliths''' are a series of volcanic-stone monoliths from the area of [[Ikom]], [[Cross River State]], [[Nigeria]]. They are estimated to have been made between 200 and 1850 AD.

==Description==
Numbering about 300 in total, the [[monoliths]] are between 0.3 and 1.8 metres (1 and 6 feet) high, and are laid out in some 30 circles located around Alok in the [[Ikom]] area of [[Cross River State]]. Since Cross River was divided, it now belongs to Akwa Ibom State. The monoliths are [[phallic]] in form and some feature stylized faces as well as decorative patterns and inscriptions. Although the carvings have not been deciphered, researchers and linguists believe that the inscriptions may represent a form of writing and visual communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Centre|first1=UNESCO World Heritage|title=Alok Ikom Stone Monoliths - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5173/|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ikom Monoliths of Cross River State {{!}} World Monuments Fund|url=https://www.wmf.org/project/ikom-monoliths-cross-river-state|website=www.wmf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation risk==
Exposure to extreme weather conditions have put these monoliths at risk of [[erosion]] and deterioration. The monoliths are also located in an area where the nearby people do not commonly see their worth as tourist attractions. They were recently added to the [[World Monuments Fund]]'s list of sites in danger and are being considered for inclusion onto [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]] list.

==Monoliths in museum collections==
A medium-sized example of an Ikom monolith with human facial features can be found in the [[British Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=611818&amp;partId=1&amp;people=41274&amp;peoA=41274-3-7&amp;page=1|title=figure|website=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Işalniţa Power Station''' is a large [[thermal power plant]] located in [[Işalniţa, Dolj|Işalniţa]], [[Dolj County]] having 2 generating groups of 315 MW each for a total of 630MW of installed capacity. The power station formerly had a total of eight generation groups, three of 50 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]], one of 55 MW, two of 100 MW and two groups of 315 MW for a total of 1,035MW but six of these groups were decommissioned thus leaving only the two 315MW units.

A consortium formed by [[Alstom]], [[Sumitomo]] and [[IHI Corporation]] was commissioned to upgrade the 315 MW group to 345 MW each at a total cost of US$315 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.9am.ro/stiri-revista-presei/2005-06-23/mec-vrea-14-milioane-de-euro-in-plus-pentru-cet-isalnita.html MEC vrea 14 milioane de euro in plus la Isalnita {{ro}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are plans to add another generating group of 500 [[MWh]] at '''Işalniţa Power Station''' that will result a total power generating capacity of 1,535 [[MWh]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gds.ro/Economie/2008-12-01/CE+Craiova+vrea+o+noua+termocentrala CE Craiova vrea o noua termocentrala]&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of US$750 million.

The tallest chimney of the power station is 200 metres tall.

[[File:The sun is an MHD system that is not well understood- 2013-04-9 14-29.jpg|thumbnail|The sun is an MHD system that is not well understood.]]

'''Magnetohydrodynamics''' ('''MHD'''; '''also magneto-fluid dynamics''' or '''hydro&amp;shy;magnetics''') is the study of the magnetic properties and behaviour of [[electrical conduction|electrically conducting]] [[fluid]]s. Examples of such magneto&amp;shy;fluids include [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]], [[liquid metal]]s, [[Brine|salt water]], and [[electrolyte]]s. The word "magneto&amp;shy;hydro&amp;shy;dynamics" is derived from ''magneto-'' meaning [[magnetic field]], ''hydro-'' meaning [[water]], and ''dynamics'' meaning movement. The field of MHD was initiated by [[Hannes Alfvén]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alfvén | first1 = H | year = 1942 | title = Existence of electromagnetic-hydrodynamic waves | bibcode=1942Natur.150..405A | journal = Nature | volume = 150 | issue = 3805| pages = 405–406 | doi=10.1038/150405d0}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he received the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics in 1970.

The fundamental concept behind MHD is that magnetic fields can [[Electromagnetic induction|induce]] currents in a moving conductive fluid, which in turn polarizes the fluid and reciprocally changes the magnetic field itself. The set of equations that describe MHD are a combination of the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[Maxwell’s equations]] of [[electromagnetism|electro&amp;shy;magnetism]]. These [[differential equation]]s must be solved [[simultaneous equation|simultaneously]], either analytically or [[Numerical analysis|numerically]].

== History ==
[[File:M Faraday Th Phillips oil 1842.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Michael Faraday]]]]
The first recorded use of the word ''magnetohydrodynamics'' is by [[Hannes Alfvén]] in 1942:
:"At last some remarks are made about the transfer of momentum from the Sun to the planets, which is fundamental to the theory (§11). The importance of the magnetohydrodynamic waves in this respect are pointed out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alfvén |first=H. |year=1942 |title=On the cosmogony of the solar system III |journal=Stockholms Observatoriums Annaler |volume=14 |pages=9.1–9.29 |bibcode=1942StoAn..14....9A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ebbing salty water flowing past London's [[Waterloo Bridge]] interacts with the [[Earth's magnetic field]] to produce a potential difference between the two river-banks.  [[Michael Faraday]] called this effect "magneto-electric induction" and tried this experiment in 1832 but the current was too small to measure with the equipment at the time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phy6.org/earthmag/NSTA1C.htm Dynamos in Nature] by David P. Stern&lt;/ref&gt; and the river bed contributed to short-circuit the signal. However, by a similar process the voltage induced by the tide in the English Channel was measured in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;McKetta J McKetta, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=U8Bd7TOcma4C&amp;pg=PA127 Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing and Design: Volume 66]" (1999) {{Dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideal and resistive MHD ==
[[File:T3e troy.jpg|right|frame|MHD Simulation of the Solar Wind]]
The simplest form of MHD, Ideal MHD, assumes that the fluid has so little [[resistivity]] that it can be treated as a [[perfect conductor]].  This is the limit of infinite [[magnetic Reynolds number]]. In ideal MHD, [[Lenz's law]] dictates that the fluid is in a sense ''tied'' to the magnetic field lines. To explain, in ideal MHD a small rope-like volume of fluid surrounding a field line will continue to lie along a magnetic field line,
even as it is twisted and distorted by fluid flows in the system. This is sometimes referred to as the magnetic field lines being "frozen" in the fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Priest and Terry Forbes, "Magnetic Reconnection: MHD Theory and Applications", Cambridge University Press, First Edition, 2000, pp 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
The connection between magnetic field lines and fluid in ideal MHD fixes the [[topology]] of the magnetic field in the fluid—for example, if a set of magnetic field lines are tied into a knot, then they will remain so as long as the fluid/plasma has negligible resistivity.  This difficulty in reconnecting magnetic field lines makes it possible to store energy by moving the fluid or the source of the magnetic field.  The energy can then become available if the conditions for ideal MHD break down, allowing [[magnetic reconnection]] that releases the stored energy from the magnetic field.

=== Ideal MHD equations ===
[[File:Magnetohydrodynamic Flow Simulation.jpg|thumb|Magnetohydrodynamic flow simulation showing magnetic flux density]]
The ideal MHD equations consist of the [[continuity equation]], the [[Cauchy momentum equation]], [[Ampere's Law]] neglecting displacement current, and a [[Conservation of energy|temperature evolution equation]].  As with any fluid description to a kinetic system, a closure approximation must be applied to highest moment of the particle distribution equation.  This is often accomplished with approximations to the heat flux through a condition of [[Adiabatic process|adiabaticity]] or [[Isothermal process|isothermality]].

The main quantities which characterize the electrically conducting fluid are the bulk plasma [[velocity field]] '''v''', the [[current density]] '''J''', the [[mass density]] ''ρ'', and the plasma [[pressure]] ''p''. The flowing electric charge in the plasma is the source of a [[magnetic field]] '''B''' and [[electric field]] '''E'''. All quantities generally vary with time ''t''. [[Vector operator]] notation will be used, in particular ∇ is [[gradient]], ∇⋅ is [[divergence]], and ∇× is [[curl (mathematics)|curl]].

The mass [[continuity equation]] is
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \left(\rho\mathbf{v}\right)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[Cauchy momentum equation]] is
:&lt;math&gt; \rho\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial t} + \mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla \right)\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B} - \nabla p.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[Lorentz force]] term '''J'''×'''B''' can be expanded using Ampere's law and the [[vector calculus identity]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\nabla(\mathbf{B}\cdot \mathbf{B})=(\mathbf{B}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{B}\times(\nabla\times \mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;

to give
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B} =  \frac{\left(\mathbf{B}\cdot\nabla\right)\mathbf{B}}{\mu_0} - \nabla\left(\frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where the first term on the right hand side is the [[magnetic tension force]] and the second term is the [[magnetic pressure]] force.
The ideal Ohm's law for a plasma is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B} = 0. &lt;/math&gt;
Faraday's law is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = - \nabla \times \mathbf{E}. &lt;/math&gt;
The low-frequency Ampere's law neglects displacement current and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_0 \mathbf{J} = \nabla\times\mathbf{B}.&lt;/math&gt;
The magnetic divergence constraint is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The energy equation is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left(\frac{p}{\rho^\gamma}\right) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma=5/3&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of [[specific heat]]s for an [[adiabatic]] [[equation of state]]. This energy equation is, of course, only applicable in the absence of shocks or heat conduction as it assumes that the entropy of a fluid element does not change.

=== Applicability of ideal MHD to plasmas ===

Ideal MHD is only strictly applicable when:

# The plasma is strongly collisional, so that the time scale of collisions is shorter than the other characteristic times in the system, and the particle distributions are therefore close to [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]].
# The resistivity due to these collisions is small. In particular, the typical magnetic diffusion times over any scale length present in the system must be longer than any time scale of interest.
# Interest in length scales much longer than the ion [[Plasma parameters#Lengths|skin depth]] and [[Larmor radius]] perpendicular to the field, long enough along the field to ignore [[Landau damping]], and time scales much longer than the ion gyration time (system is smooth and slowly evolving).

=== Importance of resistivity ===

In an imperfectly conducting fluid the magnetic field can generally move through the fluid following a [[Diffusion equation|diffusion law]] with the resistivity of the plasma serving as a [[diffusion constant]]. This means that solutions to the ideal MHD equations are only applicable for a limited time for a region of a given size before diffusion becomes too important to ignore.  One can estimate the diffusion time across a [[solar active region]] (from collisional resistivity) to be  hundreds to thousands of years, much longer than the actual lifetime of a sunspot—so it would seem reasonable to ignore the resistivity. By contrast, a meter-sized volume of seawater has a magnetic diffusion time measured in milliseconds.

Even in physical systems – which are large and conductive enough that simple estimates of the [[Lundquist number]] suggest that the resistivity can be ignored – resistivity may still be important: many [[Instability|instabilities]] exist that can increase the effective resistivity of the plasma by factors of more than a billion. The enhanced resistivity is usually the result of the formation of small scale structure like current sheets or fine scale magnetic [[Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence|turbulence]], introducing small spatial scales into the system over which ideal MHD is broken and magnetic diffusion can occur quickly. When this happens, magnetic reconnection may occur in the plasma to release stored magnetic energy as waves, bulk mechanical acceleration of material, [[particle acceleration]], and heat.

Magnetic reconnection in highly conductive systems is important because it concentrates energy in time and space, so that gentle forces applied to a plasma for long periods of time can cause violent explosions and bursts of radiation.

When the fluid cannot be considered as completely conductive, but the other conditions for ideal MHD are satisfied, it is possible to use an extended model called resistive MHD. This includes an extra term in Ohm's Law which models the collisional resistivity. Generally MHD computer simulations are at least somewhat resistive because their computational grid introduces a [[numerical resistivity]].

=== Importance of kinetic effects ===

Another limitation of MHD (and fluid theories in general) is that they depend on the assumption that the plasma is strongly collisional (this is the first criterion listed above), so that the time scale of collisions is shorter than the other characteristic times in the system, and the particle distributions are [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]]. This is usually not the case in fusion, space and astrophysical plasmas. When this is not the case, or the interest is in smaller spatial scales, it may be necessary to use a kinetic model which properly accounts for the non-Maxwellian shape of the distribution function.  However, because MHD is relatively simple and captures many of the important properties of plasma dynamics it is often qualitatively accurate and is therefore often the first model tried.

Effects which are essentially kinetic and not captured by fluid models include [[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]], [[Landau damping]], a wide range of instabilities, chemical separation in space plasmas and electron runaway. In the case of ultra-high intensity laser interactions, the incredibly short timescales of energy deposition mean that hydrodynamic codes fail to capture the essential physics.

[[File:Currents.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Schematic view of the different current systems which shape the Earth's magnetosphere]]

In many MHD systems most of the electric current is compressed into thin nearly-two-dimensional ribbons termed [[current sheet]]s.  These can divide the fluid into magnetic domains, inside of which the currents are relatively weak. Current sheets in
the solar corona are thought to be between a few meters and a few kilometers in thickness, which is quite thin compared to the magnetic domains (which are thousands to hundreds of thousands of kilometers across). Another example is in the Earth's [[magnetosphere]], where current sheets separate topologically distinct domains, isolating most of the Earth's [[ionosphere]] from the [[solar wind]].

== Waves ==
{{see also|Waves in plasmas}}
The wave modes derived using MHD plasma theory are called '''magnetohydrodynamic waves''' or '''MHD waves'''. In general there are three MHD wave modes:
* Pure (or oblique) Alfvén wave
* Slow MHD wave
* Fast MHD wave

}}
All these waves have constant phase velocities for all frequencies, and hence there is no dispersion. At the limits when the angle between the wave propagation vector k and magnetic field B is either 0 (180) or 90 degrees, the wave modes are called:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oulu.fi/~spaceweb/textbook/mhdwaves.html MHD waves [Oulu&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810223700/http://www.oulu.fi/~spaceweb/textbook/mhdwaves.html |date=2007-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phase velocity depends on the angle between the wave vector k and the magnetic field B.  An MHD wave propagating at an arbitrary angle &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the time independent or bulk field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}_0&lt;/math&gt; will satisfy the dispersion relation
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\frac{\omega}{k} = v_A \cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="block"&gt;v_A = \frac{B_0}{\sqrt{\mu_0\rho}}&lt;/math&gt;is the Alfvén speed.  This branch corresponds to the shear Alfvén mode.  Additionally  the dispersion equation gives&lt;math display="block"&gt;\frac{\omega}{k} = \left[ \frac{1}{2}(v_A^2+v_s^2) \pm \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{(v_A^2+v_s^2)^2 - 4v_s^2v_A^2\cos^2\theta}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;where&lt;math display="block"&gt;v_s = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma p}{\rho}}&lt;/math&gt;is the ideal gas sound speed.  The plus branch corresponds to the fast-MHD wave mode and the minus branch corresponds to the slow-MHD wave mode.

The MHD oscillations will be damped if the fluid is not perfectly conducting but has a finite conductivity, or if viscous effects are present.

MHD waves and oscillations are a popular tool for the remote diagnostics of laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, e.g. the [[corona]] of the Sun ([[Coronal seismology]]).

== Extensions ==
; Resistive
: Resistive MHD describes magnetized fluids with finite electron diffusivity (&lt;math&gt;\eta \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;).  This diffusivity leads to a breaking in the magnetic topology; magnetic field lines can 'reconnect' when they collide.  Usually this term is small and reconnections can be handled by thinking of them as not dissimilar to [[Shocks and discontinuities (magnetohydrodynamics)|shocks]]; this process has been shown to be important in the Earth-Solar magnetic interactions.
; Extended
: Extended MHD describes a class of phenomena in plasmas that are higher order than resistive MHD, but which can adequately be treated with a single fluid description.  These include the effects of Hall physics, electron pressure gradients, finite Larmor Radii in the particle gyromotion, and electron inertia.
; Two-fluid
: Two-fluid MHD describes plasmas that include a non-negligible Hall [[electric field]].  As a result, the electron and ion momenta must be treated separately.  This description is more closely tied to Maxwell's equations as an evolution equation for the electric field exists.
; Hall
: In 1960, M. J. Lighthill criticized the applicability of ideal or resistive MHD theory for plasmas.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Lighthill, "Studies on MHD waves and other anisotropic wave motion," ''Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.'', London, vol. 252A, pp. 397–430, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; It concerned the neglect of the "Hall current term", a frequent simplification  made in magnetic fusion theory.  Hall-magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) takes into account this electric field description of magnetohydrodynamics.  The most important difference is that in the absence of field line breaking, the magnetic field is tied to the electrons and not to the bulk fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Witalis | first1 = E.A. | year = 1986 | title = Hall Magnetohydrodynamics and Its Applications to Laboratory and Cosmic Plasma | journal = IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science | volume = PS-14 | issue = 6| pages = 842–848 | bibcode=1986ITPS...14..842W|doi = 10.1109/TPS.1986.4316632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Electron MHD
: Electron Magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) describes small scales plasmas when electron motion is much faster than the ion one. The main effects are changes in conservation laws, additional resistivity, importance of electron inertia. Many effects of Electron MHD are similar to effects of the Two fluid MHD and the Hall MHD. EMHD is especially important for [[z-pinch]], [[magnetic reconnection]], [[ion thrusters]], and plasma switches.  
; Collisionless
: MHD is also often used for collisionless plasmas. In that case the MHD equations are derived from the [[Vlasov equation]].&lt;ref name="space"&gt;W. Baumjohann and R. A. Treumann, ''Basic Space Plasma Physics'', Imperial College Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
; Reduced
: By using a [[Multiple-scale analysis|multiscale analysis]] the (resistive) MHD equations can be reduced to a set of four closed scalar equations. This allows e.g. for more efficient numerical calculations.&lt;ref name=paper:hegna&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kruger|first1=S.E.|last2=Hegna|first2=C.C.|last3=Callen|first3=J.D.|title=Reduced MHD equations for low aspect ratio plasmas|url=http://epsppd.epfl.ch/Praha/98icpp/g096pr.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925113607/http://epsppd.epfl.ch/Praha/98icpp/g096pr.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 September 2015|publisher=University of Wisconsin|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Geophysics ===
Beneath the Earth's mantle lies the core, which is made up of two parts: the solid inner core and liquid outer core. Both have significant quantities of iron. The liquid outer core moves in the presence of the magnetic field and eddies are set up into the same due to the Coriolis effect. These eddies develop a magnetic field which boosts Earth's original magnetic field—a process which is self-sustaining and is called the geomagnetic dynamo.&lt;ref name = "pbs"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/magnetic/reve-drives.html NOVA | Magnetic Storm | What Drives Earth's Magnetic Field? | PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NASA 54559main comparison1 strip.gif|thumb|center|350px|Reversals of [[Earth's magnetic field]]]]

Based on the MHD equations, Glatzmaier and Paul Roberts have made a supercomputer model of the Earth's interior. After running the simulations for thousands of years in virtual time, the changes in Earth's magnetic field can be studied. The simulation results are in good agreement with the observations as the simulations have correctly predicted that the Earth's magnetic field flips every few hundred thousand years. During the flips, the magnetic field does not vanish altogether—it just gets more complex.

====Earthquakes====

=== Astrophysics ===
MHD applies to [[astrophysics]], including stars, the [[interplanetary medium]] (space between the planets), and possibly within the [[interstellar medium]] (space between the stars) and [[Relativistic jet|jets]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}  Most astrophysical systems are not in local thermal equilibrium, and therefore require an additional kinematic treatment to describe all the phenomena within the system (see [[Astrophysical plasma]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

[[Sunspot]]s are caused by the Sun's magnetic fields, as [[Joseph Larmor]] theorized in 1919. The [[solar wind]] is also governed by MHD. The differential [[solar rotation]] may be the long-term effect of magnetic drag at the poles of the Sun, an MHD phenomenon due to the [[Parker spiral]] shape assumed by the extended magnetic field of the Sun.

Previously, theories describing the formation of the Sun and planets could not explain how the Sun has 99.87% of the mass, yet only 0.54% of the [[angular momentum]] in the [[solar system]]. In a [[closed system]] such as the cloud of gas and dust from which the Sun was formed, mass and angular momentum are both [[Conservation law|conserved]]. That conservation would imply that as the mass concentrated in the center of the cloud to form the Sun, it would spin faster, much like a skater pulling their arms in. The high speed of rotation predicted by early theories would have flung the proto-Sun apart before it could have formed. However, magnetohydrodynamic effects transfer the Sun's angular momentum into the outer solar system, slowing its rotation.

Breakdown of ideal MHD (in the form of magnetic reconnection) is known to be the likely cause of [[solar flare]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The magnetic field in a solar [[active region]] over a sunspot can store energy that is released suddenly as a burst of motion, [[X-ray]]s, and [[radiation]] when the main current sheet collapses, reconnecting the field.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Sensors===
[[Image:Principle of MHD Sensor.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Principle of MHD sensor for angular velocity measurement]]
Magnetohydrodynamic sensors are used for precision measurements of [[Angular velocity|angular velocities]] in [[inertial navigation system]]s such as in [[aerospace engineering]]. Accuracy improves with the size of the sensor. The sensor is capable of surviving in harsh environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://read.pudn.com/downloads165/ebook/756655/Strapdown%20Inertial%20Navigation%20Technology/13587_04b.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820045250/http://read.pudn.com/downloads165/ebook/756655/Strapdown%20Inertial%20Navigation%20Technology/13587_04b.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-20 |df= }} D.Titterton, J.Weston, Strapdown Inertial Navigation Technology, chapter 4.3.2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineering ===

MHD is related to engineering problems such as [[fusion power|plasma confinement]], liquid-metal cooling of [[nuclear reactor]]s, and [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] casting (among others).

A [[magnetohydrodynamic drive]] or MHD propulsor is a method for propelling seagoing vessels using only electric and magnetic fields with no moving parts, using magnetohydrodynamics. The working principle involves electrification of the propellant (gas or water) which can then be directed by a magnetic field, pushing the vehicle in the opposite direction. Although some working prototypes exist, MHD drives remain impractical.

The first prototype of this kind of propulsion was built and tested in 1965 by Steward Way, a professor of mechanical engineering at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].  Way, on leave from his job at [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]], assigned his senior-year undergraduate students to develop a submarine with this new propulsion system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Run Silent, Run Electromagnetic |date=1966-09-23 |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842848-1,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1990s, a foundation in Japan (Ship &amp; Ocean Foundation (Minato-ku, Tokyo)) built an experimental boat, the ''[[Yamato 1|Yamato-1]]'', which used a [[magnetohydrodynamic drive]] incorporating a [[superconductor]] cooled by [[helium|liquid helium]], and could travel at 15&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref name = "yamato"&gt;Setsuo Takezawa et al. (March 1995) ''Operation of the Thruster for Superconducting Electromagnetohydrodynamic Propu1sion Ship YAMATO 1''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MHD generator|MHD power generation]] fueled by potassium-seeded coal combustion gas showed potential for more efficient energy conversion (the absence of solid moving parts allows operation at higher temperatures), but failed due to cost-prohibitive technical difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://navier.stanford.edu/PIG/PIGdefault.html Partially Ionized Gases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905113821/http://navier.stanford.edu/PIG/PIGdefault.html |date=2008-09-05 }}'', M. Mitchner and Charles H. Kruger, Jr., Mechanical Engineering Department, [[Stanford University]]. See Ch. 9 "Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Power Generation", pp. 214–230.&lt;/ref&gt; One major engineering problem was the failure of the wall of the primary-coal combustion chamber due to abrasion.

In [[microfluidics]], MHD is studied as a fluid pump for producing a continuous, nonpulsating flow in a complex microchannel design.&lt;ref name=Nguyen&gt;{{cite book | author=Nguyen, N.T. |author2=Wereley, S. | title=Fundamentals and Applications of Microfluidics | date=2006 | publisher =[[Artech House]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MHD can be implemented in the [[continuous casting]] process of metals to suppress instabilities and control the flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Fujisaki |first=Keisuke |date=Oct 2000 |title=In-mold electromagnetic stirring in continuous casting |doi=10.1109/IAS.2000.883188 |conference=Industry Applications Conference |publisher=IEEE |volume=4 |issue= |pages= 2591–2598 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kenjeres |first=S. |last2=Hanjalic |first2=K. |date=2000 |title=On the implementation of effects of Lorentz force in turbulence closure models |journal=International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=329–337 |doi=10.1016/S0142-727X(00)00017-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic drug targeting===
An important task in cancer research is developing more precise methods for delivery of medicine to affected areas. One method involves the binding of medicine to biologically compatible magnetic particles (e.g. ferrofluids), which are guided to the target via careful placement of permanent magnets on the external body. Magnetohydrodynamic equations and finite element analysis are used to study the interaction between the magnetic fluid particles in the bloodstream and the external magnetic field.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''''Monographiae Biologicae''''' ({{ISSN|0077-0639}}) is a scholarly scientific literature review series, consisting of monographs published by [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]], an imprint of [[Springer Science+Business Media]]. The series subject area generally covers [[ecology]], [[zoology]], and [[biology]]. More specifically, the book series covers the [[biogeography]] of continental areas, including whole [[continent]]s;  differentiated stand-alone  [[ecosystem]]s such as islands, island groups, mountains or [[mountain chain]]s;  aquatic or [[marine ecosystem]]s such as coastal systems, [[mangroves]], [[coral reefs]], and other related ecosystems. Fresh water environments are also included in this series such as major [[river basins]], lakes, and groups of lakes.

[[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomic]] studies include the main groups of animals, plants, [[fungi]] and the comparative ecology of major [[biome]]s.

The series continues ''Physiologia comparata et oecologia'', ({{ISSN|0369-8637}}).&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;

In 2017, the Kenya Nuclear Electrification Board (Kneb) estimated that a 1,000 MW nuclear plant could be operational by 2027 and cost Ksh500-600 billion ($5-$6 billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenya plans nuclear plant by 2027|url=http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/Kenya-plans-to-set-up-nuclear-plant-by-2027/2560-4215876-14gd00jz/index.html |website=The East African|accessdate=26 December 2017|language=en-UK|date=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In September 2010 Former Energy and Petroleum Ministry PS Patrick Nyoike announced that [[Kenya]] aims to build a 1,000 MW [[Nuclear power|nuclear power plant]] between 2017 and 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/business-news/81424-kenya-to-commission-first-nuclear-plant-in-2022- |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130806030856/http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/business-news/81424-kenya-to-commission-first-nuclear-plant-in-2022- |archivedate=6 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The projected cost using South Korean technology was US$3.5 billion.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;

 | date= 20 September 2010
 | publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.]]
 | accessdate=5 June 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Nuclear and renewable sources of energy such as wind, solar and geothermal plants could play a major role in helping Kenya achieve middle income status, as the reduction of carbon emissions becomes a higher priority.

==Nuclear Energy programme==
Kenya has embarked on a programme to see the country generate 1 GW (1,000 MW) from Nuclear sources between 2020 and 2022. By 2030 Kenya is slated to have installed a capacity of 4 GW of nuclear energy, generating about 19% of Kenya's energy needs. Meaning that nuclear power would be the second largest source of energy in Kenya coming second after geothermal power which is a clean form of energy.

The Kenya Nuclear Electricity Board is in charge of spearheading this sector in the country.

==Capacity-building programme==
*15 students sponsored by Government of Kenya (GoK) for Masters in Nuclear Science at The University of Nairobi
*11 Kenyan students currently studying at The [[Korea Electric Power Corporation|KEPCO]] International Nuclear Graduate School (KINGS) under sponsorship by both the Government of Korea and Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2013-04/25/content_28658393.htm |title=Kenya trains nuclear scientists to boost electricity generation |publisher=China.org.cn |date=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*11 more scholarships are being offered for Kenyan students to study nuclear operations in Slovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coastweek.com/3623_Energy_05.htm|title=Investors commend nuclear energy plan for power generation|author=|first=|date=2013|work=Coastweek Kenya, Xinhua News Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-11/20/c_131987704.htm |title=Kenya, Slovakia to seal nuclear deal by January 2013 – Xinhua &amp;#124; English.news.cn |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6357">In [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]] and [[geography]], '''number density''' (symbol: ''n'' or ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;) is an [[intensive quantity]] used to describe the degree of [[concentration]] of [[countable]] objects ([[Elementary particle|particle]]s, [[molecules]], [[phonon]]s, [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]], etc.) in physical space: [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] volumetric number density, [[Two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]] areal number density, or [[One-dimensional space|one-dimensional]] line number density. [[Population density]] is an example of areal number density. The term '''number concentration''' (symbol: ''C'', to avoid confusion with [[amount of substance]] ''n'') is sometimes used in chemistry for the same quantity, particularly when comparing with other concentrations.

==Definition==
Volume number density is the number of specified objects per unit [[volume]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | file = N04260 | title = number concentration}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{N}{V},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''N'' is the total number of objects in a volume ''V''. 

Here it is assumed&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
  | author1 = Clayton T. Crowe
  | author2 = Martin Sommerfeld
  | author3 =  Yutaka Tsuji
  | title = Multiphase flows with droplets and particles: allelochemical interactions 
  | year = 1998
  | page = 18

  | publisher = [[CRC Press]]
  | url =

  | id = 
  | isbn = 0-8493-9469-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ''N'' is large enough that [[rounding]] of the count to the nearest [[integer]] does not introduce much of an [[Random error|error]], however ''V'' is chosen to be small enough that the resulting ''n'' does not depend much on the [[Volume|size]] or [[shape]] of the volume ''V''.

==Units==
In [[International System of Units|SI]] units, number density is measured in m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, although cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; is often used. However, these units are not quite practical when dealing with atoms or molecules of [[gas]]es, [[liquid]]s or [[solid]]s at [[room temperature]] and [[atmospheric pressure]], because the resulting numbers are extremely large (on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;). Using the number density of an [[ideal gas]] at {{nobreak|0 [[Celsius|°C]]}} and {{nobreak|1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]}} as a [[yardstick]]: {{nobreak|1=[[Loschmidt constant|n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] = 1 [[Amagat|amg]] = 2.686,777,4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is often introduced as a unit of number density, for any substances at any conditions (not necessarily limited to an ideal gas at {{nobreak|0 °C}} and {{nobreak|1 atm}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
  | author = Joseph Kestin
  | title = A Course in Thermodynamics
  | volume = 2 
  | year = 1979
  | page = 230
  | place = 
  | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis
  | url = 
  | doi = 
  | id = 
  | isbn = 0-89116-641-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Using the number density as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of [[Coordinate system|spatial coordinates]], the total number of objects ''N'' in the entire volume ''V'' can be calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;N = \iiint_V n(x,\,y,\,z)\,\mathrm{d}V,&lt;/math&gt;
where d''V'' = d''x'' d''y'' d''z'' is a volume element. If each object possesses the same [[mass]] ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the total mass ''m'' of all the objects in the volume ''V'' can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;m = \iiint_V m_0 n(x,\,y,\,z)\,\mathrm{d}V.&lt;/math&gt;

Similar expressions are valid for [[electric charge]] or any other [[extensive quantity]] associated with countable objects. For example, replacing ''m'' with ''q'' (total charge) and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (charge of each object) in the above equation will lead to a correct expression for charge.

The number density of [[solution|solute]] molecules in a [[solvent]] is sometimes called [[concentration]], although usually concentration is expressed as a number of [[Mole (unit)|moles]] per unit volume (and thus called [[molar concentration]]).

==Relation to other quantities==
===Molar concentration===
For any substance, the number density can be expressed in terms of its [[amount concentration]] ''c'' (in [[Mole (unit)|mol]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) as
:&lt;math&gt;n = N_{\rm A}c,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{nobreak|''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Avogadro constant]]. This is still true if the [[spatial dimension]] unit, metre, in both ''n'' and ''c'' is consistently replaced by any other spatial dimension unit, e.g. if ''n'' is in cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; and ''c'' is in mol/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, or if ''n'' is in [[Litre|L]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''c'' is in mol/L, etc.

===Mass density===
For [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s of a well-defined [[molar mass]] ''M'' (in [[Kilogram|kg]]/mol), the number density can be expressed in terms of their [[mass density]] ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; (in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) as
:&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{N_{\rm A}}{M} \rho_\mathrm{m}.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the ratio ''M''/''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of a single atom or molecule in kg.

==Examples==
The following table lists common examples of number densities at {{nobreak|1 atm}} and {{nobreak|20 °C}}, unless otherwise noted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2079">'''Palierne equation''' connects the [[dynamic modulus]] of [[emulsion]]s with the dynamic modulus of the two [[Phase (matter)|phases]], size of the droplets and the interphase [[surface tension]]. The equation can also be used for [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]] of [[viscoelastic]] solid particles in viscoelastic fluids.&lt;ref name=Pal&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pen.21065 |last=Pal |first=Rajinder |title=A New Viscoelastic Model for Emulsions and Suspensions|journal=Polymer Engineering and Science |volume=48 |date=July 2008 |issue=7  |pages=1250..1253}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equation is named after French [[rheology|rheologist]] [[Jean-François Palierne]] who has proposed the equation in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01331356 |last=Palierne |first=Jean-François |title=Linear Rheology of viscoelastic emulsions with interfacial tension|journal=Rheologica Acta |volume=29 |issue=3 |year=1991 |pages=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the dilute emulsions Palierne equation looks like:
:&lt;math&gt;G^*=G^*_m(1+5\phi H^*)&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;G^*&lt;/math&gt; is the dynamic modulus of the emulsion, &lt;math&gt;G^*_m&lt;/math&gt; is the dynamic modulus of the continuous phase (matrix), &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the volume fraction of the disperse phase and the &lt;math&gt;H^*&lt;/math&gt; is given as

where &lt;math&gt;G^*_d&lt;/math&gt; is the dynamic modulus of the disperse phase, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension between the phases and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[radius]] of the droplets.&lt;ref name=Pal/&gt;

For the suspension of solid particles the value of &lt;math&gt;H^*&lt;/math&gt; is given as&lt;ref name=Pal/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H^*=\frac{G^*_d-G^*_m}{2G^*_d+3G^*_m}&lt;/math&gt;

The Palierne equation is usually extended for the finite volume concentrations of the  disperse phase &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; as:&lt;ref name=Pal/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G^*=G^*_m\frac{1+3\phi H^*}{1 - 2 \phi H^*}&lt;/math&gt;

In [[particle physics]], the '''phi meson''' or '''{{Subatomic particle|Phi meson}} meson''' is a [[vector meson|vector]] [[meson]] formed of a [[strange quark|strange]] [[quark]] and a [[antistrange quark|strange]] [[antiparticle|antiquark]]. It was the {{Subatomic particle|Phi meson}} meson's unusual propensity to decay into {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Kaon0}} and {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Antikaon0}} that led to the discovery of the [[OZI rule]]. It has a mass of {{val|1019.445|0.020|ul=MeV/c2}} and a mean lifetime of {{nowrap|1.55±0.01 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−22&lt;/sup&gt;s}}.

The most common decay modes of the {{Subatomic particle|Phi meson}} meson are {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Kaon+}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Kaon-}} at {{val|48.9|0.5|u=%}}, {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|K-short0}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|K-long0}} at {{val|34.2|0.4|u=%}}, and various indistinguishable combinations of {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|rho}}s and [[pions]] at {{val|15.3|0.3|u=%}}.&lt;ref name="Nakamura" /&gt; In all cases, it decays via the [[Strong interaction|strong force]]. The pion channel would naïvely be the dominant decay channel because the collective mass of the pions is smaller than that of the kaons, making it energetically favorable; however, it is suppressed by the OZI rule.

The quark composition of the {{Subatomic particle|Phi meson}} meson can be thought of as a mix between {{Subatomic particle|strange quark}}{{Subatomic particle|strange antiquark}}, {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|up antiquark}}, and {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|down quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|down antiquark}} states, but it is very nearly a pure {{Subatomic particle|strange quark}}{{Subatomic particle|strange antiquark}} state.&lt;ref name="Nakamura 2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nakamura|first1=K.|title=14. Quark Model|url=http://pdgfloat.lbl.gov/2011/reviews/rpp2011-rev-quark-model.pdf|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be shown by deconstructing the [[wave function]] of the {{Subatomic particle|Phi meson}} into its component parts. We see that the {{Subatomic particle|Phi meson}} and {{Subatomic particle|Omega meson}} mesons are mixtures of the [[SU(3)]] wave functions as follows.

&lt;math&gt;\phi = \psi_8 \cos\theta - \psi_1 \sin\theta&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\omega = \psi_8 \sin\theta + \psi_1 \cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;,

where

&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the nonet mixing angle,

&lt;math&gt;\psi_8 = \frac{u\overline{u} - d\overline{d} - 2s\overline{s}}{\sqrt{6}}&lt;/math&gt; and

&lt;math&gt;\psi_1 = \frac{u\overline{u} + d\overline{d} + s\overline{s}}{\sqrt{3}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The mixing angle at which the components decouple completely can be calculated to be about 35.3˚. The mixing angle of the {{Subatomic particle|Phi meson}} and {{Subatomic particle|Omega meson}} states is calculated from the masses of each state to be about 35˚, which is very close to maximum decoupling. Therefore, the {{Subatomic particle|Phi meson}} meson is nearly a pure {{Subatomic particle|strange quark}}{{Subatomic particle|strange antiquark}} state.&lt;ref name="Nakamura 2" /&gt;

==History==
The existence of the {{Subatomic particle|Phi meson}} meson was first proposed by the Japanese American particle physicist, [[J. J. Sakurai]], in 1962 as a resonance state between the {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Kaon0}} and the {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Antikaon0}}.&lt;ref name="Sakurai"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sakurai|first1=J. J.|title=Possible Existence of a T=0 Vector Meson at 1020 MeV|url=https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.9.472|website=Physical Review Letters|accessdate=5 May 2017|pages=472–475|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.9.472|date=1 December 1962|bibcode=1962PhRvL...9..472S}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered later in 1962 by Connolly, et al. in a 20-inch hydrogen bubble chamber at the [[Alternating Gradient Synchrotron|Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS)]] in [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] in [[Upton, New York|Uptown, NY]] while they were studying {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Kaon-}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Proton+}} collisions at approximately 2.23 GeV/c.&lt;ref name="APS: Discovery"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Connolly|first1=P.

The {{Subatomic particle|Phi meson}} meson has several possible decay modes. The most energetically favored mode involves the {{Subatomic particle|Phi meson}} meson decaying into 3 [[pions]], which is what would naïvely be expected. However, we instead observe that it decays most frequently into 2 [[kaons]].&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffiths|first1=David|title=Introduction to elementary particles|date=2008|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|isbn=978-3-527-40601-2|edition=2nd rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1963 and 1966, 3 people, [[Susumu Okubo]], [[George Zweig]] and Jugoro Iizuka, each independently proposed a rule to account for the observed suppression of the 3 pion decay.&lt;ref&gt;S. Okubo, ''Phys. Lett.'' '''5''', 1975 (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Zweig, ''CERN Report'' No.8419/TH412 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Iizuka, ''Prog. Theor. Phys. Suppl.'' '''37''', 21 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; This rule is now known as the OZI rule and is also the currently accepted explanation for the unusually long lifetimes of the {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|J/Psi}} and {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Upsilon}} mesons.&lt;ref name="Griffiths" /&gt; Namely, on average they last {{nowrap|~ 7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt; s}} and {{nowrap|~ 1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−20&lt;/sup&gt; s}} respectively.&lt;ref name="Griffiths" /&gt; This is compared to the normal mean lifetime of a meson decaying via the strong force, which is on the order of {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; s}}.&lt;ref name="Griffiths" /&gt;

In 1999, a {{Subatomic particle|Phi meson}} factory named [[DAFNE]] (or DA{{Subatomic particle|Phi meson}}NE since the F stands for "{{Subatomic particle|Phi meson}} Factory") began operation to study the decay of the {{Subatomic particle|Phi meson}} meson in [[Frascati]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; It produces {{Subatomic particle|Phi meson}} mesons via [[electron]]-[[positron]] collisions. It has numerous detectors, including the [[KLOE (experiment)|KLOE detector]] which was in operation at the beginning of its operation.

'''Platinum black''' ('''Pt black''') is a fine powder of [[platinum]] with good [[heterogeneous catalysis|catalytic]] properties. The name of platinum black is due to its black color.

==Uses==

===Thin film electrode===
Platinum black is widely used as a thin film covering solid platinum metal, forming platinum [[electrode]]s for applications in [[electrochemistry]]. The process of covering platinum electrodes with such a layer of platinum black is called "platinization of platinum". The platinized platinum has a true surface area much higher than the geometrical surface area of the electrode and, therefore, exhibits action superior to that of shiny platinum.

===Fuel cell membrane catalyst===
Platinum black powder is used as a catalyst in [[proton exchange membrane fuel cell]]s. In common practice, the platinum black is either sprayed using an [[ultrasonic nozzle]] or hot pressed onto the membrane or gas diffusion layer. A suspension of platinum black and carbon powder in ethanol-water solutions serves to optimize the uniformity of the coating, electrical conductivity, and in the case of application to the membrane, to prevent dehydration of the membrane during the application.

===Catalytic ignition of flammable gasses===
Historically many "self-lighting" gas lamps, ovens, and stove burners used platinum black to catalyze the oxidation of a small amount of gas, lighting the device without a match or spark. This works particularly well for [[producer gas]], [[town gas]], and [[wood gas]] which contain a substantial fraction of hydrogen gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which is particularly well catalyzed by platinum black.

==Manufacturing of platinum black powder==
Platinum black powder can be manufactured from [[ammonium chloroplatinate]] by heating at 500&amp;nbsp;°C in molten [[sodium nitrate]] for 30 minutes, followed by pouring the melt into water, boiling, washing, and reduction of the brown powder (believed to be platinum dioxide) with gaseous hydrogen to platinum black.&lt;ref name="mills"&gt;Mills, A., "Porous Platinum Morphologies: Platinised, Sponge and Black", Platinum Metals Review, 51, 1, Jan 2007 http://www.platinummetalsreview.com/pdf/52-pmr-jan07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process of platinization of platinum metal==
Before platinization, the platinum surface is cleaned by immersion in [[aqua regia]] (50% solution, i.e., 3 volumes of 12&amp;nbsp;mol/kg of HCl, 1 volume of 16&amp;nbsp;mol/kg HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 4 volumes of water).&lt;ref name="Sawyer"&gt;D.T. Sawyer, A. Sobkowiak, J.L. Roberts, Jr., "Electrochemistry for Chemists, 2nd edition", John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Platinization is often conducted from water solution of 0.072&amp;nbsp;mol/kg of [[chloroplatinic acid]] and 0.00013&amp;nbsp;mol/kg of [[lead acetate]], at a current density of 30 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for up to 10 minutes. The process evolves chlorine at the anode; the interaction of the chlorine with the cathode is prevented by employing a suitable separation (e.g., [[Laboratory glassware#Fritted glass|a glass frit]]).&lt;ref name="Sawyer"/&gt;

Another author&lt;ref name="mills"/&gt; recommends electroplating with the current density of 5 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; while reversing the polarity every 30 seconds for 15 minutes.

After platinization, the electrode should be rinsed and stored in distilled water. The electrode loses its catalytic properties on prolonged exposure to air. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Platinum metal sponge==
'''Platinum sponge''' is a porous, grayish-black form of [[platinum]] that can [[adsorption|adsorb]] a large amount of gas, such as hydrogen or oxygen gas, allowing it to be used as a catalyst in many gas reactions such as the oxidation of ammonium. It can also be used for the ignition of combustible gases. It is used as the raw material for electronic instrument, chemical industry, and precision alloys. It can also be used as a [[surface active agent]]. It is soluble in [[Aqua regia|chloroazotic acid]] and is formed from a mass of metallic particles.

In hydrogen saturated hydrochloric acid, the shiny platinum electrode is observed to assume positive potential versus that of platinum black at zero net current (+ 340 mV at room temperature). With the temperature increasing to 70&amp;nbsp;°C, the difference in potentials dropped to zero.&lt;ref&gt;D.J.Ives, G.J. Janz, "Reference Electrodes, Theory and Practice", Academic Press, 1961, p.88.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is not perfectly clear, although several explanations have been proposed.

== Prepreg ==
'''Pre-preg''' is "pre-impregnated" [[Fiber-reinforced composite|composite fiber]]s where a [[thermoset polymer matrix]] material, such as [[epoxy]], or a thermoplastic resin is already present. The fibers often take the form of a [[weaving|weave]] and the matrix is used to bond them together and to other components during manufacture. The [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]] matrix is only partially cured to allow easy handling; this [[B-staging|B-Stage material]] requires cold storage to prevent complete curing.  B-Stage pre-preg is always stored in cooled areas since heat accelerates complete polymerization. Hence, composite structures built of pre-pregs will mostly require an oven or [[Autoclave (industrial)|autoclave]] to cure. 

Pre-preg allows one to impregnate the fibers on a flat workable surface, or rather in an industrial process, and then later form the impregnated fibers to a shape which could prove to be problematic for the hot injection process. Pre-preg also allows one to impregnate a bulk amount of fiber and then store it in a cooled area (below 20°C) for an extended period of time to cure later. The process can also be time consuming in comparison to the hot injection process and the added value for pre-preg preparation is at the stage of the material supplier.

== Areas of Application ==
This technique can be utilized in the aviation industry. As in principle,  prepreg has the potential to be processed batch sizes. Despite fiber glass has high applicability in aircraft specifically small aircraft motors, carbon fiber is employed in this type of industry with higher rate, and the demand on it is i increase. For example, the characterization of Airbus A380 is handled by means of a mass fraction. This mass fractionb is about 20%, and the Airbus A350XWB by a mass fraction of about 50% of carbon fiber prepregs. Carbon fiber prepregs have been used in the airfoils of the Airbus fleet for more than 20 years.

The usage of prepreg in automotive industry is used at relatively limitted quantities in comparison with other techniques like automated tape lay-up and automated fiber placement. The main resean behined this is the relative high cost of prepreg fibers as well as the compounds used in molds. Example of such tools areBMC or SMC.
&lt;br /&gt;

== Products Based on Prepregs ==
There are many products that utilize the concept of prepreg among which is the following.

* Motorsport

* Space travel

* Sports equipment

* Sailing

* Orthopedic technology in orthotics as well as in prosthetics

* In electrical engineering as an "intermediate layer" in multilayer circuit boards and as insulating material for electrical machines and transformers

* Rotor blades in wind turbines

== Applicable Fiber Types ==
There are many fiber types that can be excellent candidates for the preparation of preimpregnated fibers. The most common fibers among these candidates are the following fibers.

* Glass fibers
* Basalt fibers
* Carbon fibers
* Kevlar fibers (aramid)

== Matrix ==
One distinguishes the matrix systems according to their hardening temperature and the type of resin. The curing temperature greatly influences the glass transition temperature and thus the operating temperature. Military aircraft mainly use 180 ° C systems

== Composition ==
The prepreg matrix consists of a mixture of resin and hardener, in some cases an accelerator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scola|first=Daniel A.|last2=Vontell|first2=John|last3=Felsen|first3=Marvin|date=August 1987|title=Effects of ambient aging of 5245C/graphite prepreg on composition and mechanical properties of fabricated composites|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pc.750080406|journal=Polymer Composites|volume=8|issue=4|pages=244–252|doi=10.1002/pc.750080406|issn=0272-8397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freezing at -20 ° C prevents the resin from reacting with the hardener. If the cold chain is interrupted, the reaction starts and the prepreg becomes unusable. There are also high-temperature prepregs which can be stored for a certain time at room temperature. These prepregs can then be cured only in an autoclave at elevated temperature.

== Resin Types ==
It is mainly used resins based on epoxy resin. Vinyl ester-based prepregs are also available. Since vinyl ester resins must be pre-accelerated with amine accelerator or cobalt, their processing time at room temperature is shorter than with epoxy-based prepregs. Catalysts (also called hardeners) include peroxides such as methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP), acetyl acetone peroxide (AAP) or cyclohexanone peroxide (CHP). Vinylesterharz is used under high impact stress.

== processing ==
Prepregs are cured at elevated temperature. They can be processed with the hot pressing technique or the autoclave technique. In both techniques increases by the pressure of the fiber volume fraction.

The best qualities can be produced with the autoclave technique. The combination of pressure and vacuum results in components with very low air inclusions.

The curing can be followed by a tempering process, which serves for complete crosslinking.

==Material advances==
Recent advances in [[out of autoclave composite manufacturing|out of autoclave (OOA)]] processes hold promise for improving performance and lowering costs for composite structures.  Using vacuum-bag-only (VBO) for atmospheric pressures, the new OOA processes promise to deliver the less than 1 percent void content required for aerospace primary structures.  Led by material scientists at [[Air Force Research Lab]], the technique would save the costs of constructing and installing large structure autoclaves ($100M saved at NASA) and making small production runs of 100 aircraft economically viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/out-of-autoclave-prepregs-hype-or-revolution |title=Out-of-autoclave prepregs: Hype or revolution? |publisher=Composites World |date= |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, the '''reach''' of a [[subset]] of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[real number]] that roughly describes how curved the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the set is.

== Definition ==
Let ''X'' be a subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then reach of ''X'' is defined as 

: &lt;math&gt;\text{reach}(X) := 
    \sup \{r \in \mathbb{R}: 
             \forall  x \in \mathbb{R}^n\setminus X\text{ with }{\rm dist}(x,X) &lt; r \text{ exists a unique closest point }y \in X\text{ such that }{\rm dist}(x,y)= {\rm dist}(x,X)\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
Shapes that have reach infinity include
* a single point,
* a straight line,
* a full square, and
* any [[convex set]].

The graph of ''ƒ''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|''x''| has reach zero.

A circle of radius ''r'' has reach&amp;nbsp;''r''.

[[File:Rectifier.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A rectifier diode ([[silicon controlled rectifier]]) and associated mounting hardware. The heavy threaded stud attaches the device to a [[heatsink]] to dissipate heat.]]

A '''rectifier''' is an electrical device that [[Electric power conversion|converts]] [[alternating current]] (AC), which periodically reverses direction, to [[direct current]] (DC), which flows in only one direction. The process is known as ''rectification'', since it "straightens" the direction of current. Physically, rectifiers take a number of forms, including [[vacuum tube]] [[diode]]s, [[mercury-arc valve]]s, stacks of copper and selenium oxide plates, [[semiconductor diode]]s, [[silicon-controlled rectifier]]s and other silicon-based semiconductor switches. Historically, even synchronous electromechanical switches and motors have been used. Early radio receivers, called [[crystal radio]]s, used a "[[Cat's-whisker detector|cat's whisker]]" of fine wire pressing on a crystal of [[galena]] (lead sulfide) to serve as a point-contact rectifier or "crystal detector".

Rectifiers have many uses, but are often found serving as components of DC [[power supplies]] and [[high-voltage direct current]] power transmission systems. Rectification may serve in roles other than to generate direct current for use as a source of power. As noted, [[detector (radio)|detectors]] of [[radio]] signals serve as rectifiers. In gas heating systems [[flame rectification]] is used to detect presence of a flame.

Because of the alternating nature of the input AC [[sine wave]], the process of rectification alone produces a DC that, though unidirectional, consists of pulses of current.  Many applications of rectifiers, such as power supplies for radio, television and computer equipment, require a ''steady'' constant DC current (as would be produced by a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]).  In these applications the output of the rectifier is smoothed by an [[electronic filter]], which may be a [[capacitor]], [[Choke (electronics)|choke]], or set of capacitors, chokes and [[resistor]]s, possibly followed by a [[voltage regulator]] to produce a steady current.

More complex circuitry that performs the opposite function, converting DC to AC, is called an [[Inverter (electrical)|inverter]].

== Rectifier devices ==
Before the development of silicon semiconductor rectifiers, vacuum tube [[thermionic diode]]s and copper oxide- or selenium-based [[metal rectifier]] stacks were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rslXJmYPjGIC&amp;pg=PA18|page=18|title = A History of the World Semiconductor Industry|isbn = 978-0-86341-227-1|last1 = Morris|first1 = Peter Robin|year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the introduction of semiconductor electronics, vacuum tube rectifiers became obsolete, except for some enthusiasts of vacuum tube [[audio equipment]]. For power rectification from very low to very high current, semiconductor diodes of various types ([[junction diode]]s, [[Schottky diode]]s, etc.) are widely used.

Other devices that have control electrodes as well as acting as unidirectional current valves are used where more than simple rectification is required—e.g., where variable output voltage is needed. High-power rectifiers, such as those used in [[high-voltage direct current]] power transmission, employ silicon semiconductor devices of various types. These are [[thyristor]]s or other controlled switching solid-state switches, which effectively function as diodes to pass current in only one direction.

== Rectifier circuits ==
Rectifier circuits may be [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] or multi-phase ([[Three-phase electric power|three phase]] being the most common number of phases).  Most low power rectifiers for domestic equipment are single-phase, but three-phase rectification is very important for industrial applications and for the transmission of energy as DC (HVDC).

=== Single-phase rectifiers ===

==== Half-wave rectification ====
{{anchor|Half-wave rectification}}
In half-wave rectification of a single-phase supply, either the positive or negative half of the AC wave is passed, while the other half is blocked. Mathematically, it is a [[ramp function]] (for positive pass, negative block): passing positive corresponds to the ramp function being the identity on positive inputs, blocking negative corresponds to being zero on negative inputs. Because only one half of the input waveform reaches the output, mean voltage is lower. Half-wave rectification requires a single [[diode]] in a [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase supply]], or three in a [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase supply]]. Rectifiers yield a unidirectional but pulsating direct current; half-wave rectifiers produce far more [[Ripple (electrical)|ripple]] than full-wave rectifiers, and much more filtering is needed to eliminate [[Harmonics (electrical power)|harmonics]] of the AC frequency from the output.

[[File:Halfwave.rectifier.en.svg|600px|thumb|left|Half-wave rectifier]]
{{clear}}

The no-load output DC voltage of an ideal half-wave rectifier for a sinusoidal input voltage is:&lt;ref name=Lander93&gt;{{cite book|last=Lander|first=Cyril W.|title=Power electronics|year=1993|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=London|isbn=978-0-07-707714-3|edition=3rd|chapter=2. Rectifying Circuits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Half-wave rectifier voltage}}&lt;!-- This is half-wave, not full-wave.  PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE TO SQUARE-ROOT 2.  You will be completely wrong and will be reverted. --&gt;

: ''V''&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;, the peak value of the phase input voltages,
: ''V''&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[root mean square]] (RMS) value of output voltage.

==== Full-wave rectification ====
{{anchor|Full-wave rectification}}
[[File:VacRect2E.png|thumb|200px|Full-wave rectifier, with vacuum tube having two anodes.]]
A full-wave rectifier converts the whole of the input waveform to one of constant polarity (positive or negative) at its output. Mathematically, this corresponds to the [[absolute value]] function. Full-wave rectification converts both polarities of the input waveform to pulsating DC (direct current), and yields a higher average output voltage. Two diodes and a center tapped [[transformer]], or four diodes in a [[Diode bridge|bridge configuration]] and any AC source (including a transformer without center tap), are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=B. W.|title=Power electronics : devices, drivers and applications|year=1992|publisher=Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0-333-57351-8|edition=2nd|chapter=Chapter 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single semiconductor diodes, double diodes with common cathode or common anode, and four-diode bridges, are manufactured as single components.

[[File:Gratz.rectifier.en.svg|thumb|left|600px|Graetz bridge rectifier: a full-wave rectifier using four diodes.]]
{{clear}}

For single-phase AC, if the transformer is center-tapped, then two diodes back-to-back (cathode-to-cathode or anode-to-anode, depending upon output polarity required) can form a full-wave rectifier. Twice as many turns are required on the transformer secondary to obtain the same output voltage than for a bridge rectifier, but the power rating is unchanged.

[[File:Fullwave.rectifier.en.svg|thumb|left|600px|Full-wave rectifier using a [[center tap]] transformer and 2 diodes.]]
{{clear}}

The [[Arithmetic mean|average]] and RMS no-load output voltages of an ideal single-phase full-wave rectifier are:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V_\mathrm{dc}=V_\mathrm {av}&amp;=\frac{2 \cdot V_\mathrm{peak}}{\pi}\\[8pt]
V_\mathrm {rms}&amp;=\frac {V_\mathrm{peak}}{\sqrt 2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Very common double-diode rectifier [[vacuum tube]]s contained a single common [[cathode]] and two [[anode]]s inside a single envelope, achieving full-wave rectification with positive output. The 5U4 and the 80/5Y3 (4 pin)/(octal)were popular examples of this configuration.

=== Three-phase rectifiers ===
Single-phase rectifiers are commonly used for power supplies for domestic equipment.  However, for most industrial and high-power applications, [[three-phase electric power|three-phase]] rectifier circuits are the norm. As with single-phase rectifiers, three-phase rectifiers can take the form of a half-wave circuit, a full-wave circuit using a center-tapped transformer, or a full-wave bridge circuit.

[[Thyristor]]s are commonly used in place of diodes to create a circuit that can regulate the output voltage.  Many devices that provide direct current actually ''generate'' three-phase AC. For example, an [[automobile alternator]] contains six diodes, which function as a full-wave rectifier for battery charging.

==== Three-phase, half-wave circuit ====
[[File:3 phase half wave rectifier.png|thumb|300px|Controlled three-phase half-wave rectifier circuit using [[thyristor]]s as the switching elements, ignoring supply inductance]]
An uncontrolled three-phase, half-wave midpoint circuit requires three diodes, one connected to each phase.  This is the simplest type of three-phase rectifier but suffers from relatively high [[harmonic distortion]] on both the AC and DC connections.  This type of rectifier is said to have a pulse-number of three, since the output voltage on the DC side contains three distinct pulses per cycle of the grid frequency:

[[File:DC voltage profile of M3 three-phase half-wave rectifier.jpg||500px]]

The peak values &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{peak}&lt;/math&gt; of this three-pulse DC voltage are calculated from the RMS value &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{LN}&lt;/math&gt; of the input phase voltage (line to neutral voltage, 120 V in North America, 230 V within Europe at mains operation): &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{peak} = \sqrt 2 \cdot V_{\mathrm{LN}}&lt;/math&gt;. The average no-load output voltage &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm {av}&lt;/math&gt; results from the [[integral]] under the graph of a positive half-wave with the period duration of &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3} \pi&lt;/math&gt; (from 30° to 150°):
&lt;div style="overflow:auto;&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{dc}=V_\mathrm {av} = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{3} \pi} \int_{30^\circ}^{150^\circ} V_\mathrm{peak} \cdot \sin\varphi \cdot \mathrm d\varphi = \frac{3 \cdot V_\mathrm{peak}}{2 \pi} \cdot \left(-\cos 150^\circ + \cos 30^\circ \right) = \frac{3 \cdot V_\mathrm{peak}}{2 \pi} \cdot \Biggl[ -\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \Biggl] = \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot V_\mathrm{peak}}{2 \pi}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
: ⇒ &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{dc}=V_\mathrm {av} = \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt 2 \cdot V_\mathrm{LN}}{2 \pi}&lt;/math&gt; ⇒ &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm {av} = \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt 6 \cdot V_\mathrm{LN}}{2 \pi}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 1,17 ⋅ &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{LN}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Three-phase, full-wave circuit using center-tapped transformer ====
[[File:6 phase half wave rectifier.png|thumb|300px|Controlled three-phase full-wave rectifier circuit using [[thyristor]]s as the switching elements, with a center-tapped transformer, ignoring supply inductance]]
If the AC supply is fed via a transformer with a center tap, a rectifier circuit with improved harmonic performance can be obtained.  This rectifier now requires six diodes, one connected to each end of each transformer secondary winding.  This circuit has a pulse-number of six, and in effect, can be thought of as a six-phase, half-wave circuit.

Before [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] devices became available, the half-wave circuit, and the full-wave circuit using a center-tapped transformer, were very commonly used in industrial rectifiers using [[mercury-arc valve]]s.&lt;ref name="Rissik1941"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hendrik Rissik|title=Mercury-arc current convertors &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; : an introduction to the theory and practice of vapour-arc discharge devices and to the study of rectification phenomena|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4MhAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 January 2013|year=1941|publisher=Sir I. Pitman &amp; sons, ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was because the three or six AC supply inputs could be fed to a corresponding number of anode electrodes on a single tank, sharing a common cathode.

With the advent of diodes and thyristors, these circuits have become less popular and the three-phase bridge circuit has become the most common circuit.

==== Three-phase bridge rectifier uncontrolled  ====
[[File:Getting behind the tridge rectifier.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Disassembled automobile [[alternator (auto)|alternator]], showing the six diodes that comprise a full-wave three-phase bridge rectifier.]]
For an uncontrolled three-phase bridge rectifier, six diodes are used, and the circuit again has a pulse number of six. For this reason, it is also commonly referred to as a six-pulse bridge. The B6 circuit can be seen simplified as a series connection of two three-pulse center circuits.

For low-power applications, double diodes in series, with the anode of the first diode connected to the cathode of the second, are manufactured as a single component for this purpose. Some commercially available double diodes have all four terminals available so the user can configure them for single-phase split supply use, half a bridge, or three-phase rectifier.

For higher-power applications, a single discrete device is usually used for each of the six arms of the bridge.  For the very highest powers, each arm of the bridge may consist of tens or hundreds of separate devices in parallel (where very high current is needed, for example in [[aluminium smelting]]) or in series (where very high voltages are needed, for example in [[high-voltage direct current]] power transmission).

[[File:6 pulse bridge without inductance.png|thumb|300px|Controlled three-phase full-wave bridge rectifier circuit (B6C) using [[thyristor]]s as the switching elements, ignoring supply inductance]]

The pulsating DC voltage results from the differences of the instantaneous positive and negative phase voltages &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{LN}&lt;/math&gt;, phase-shifted by 30°:

[[File:DC voltage profile of B6 three-phase full-wave rectifier.jpg||500px]]

The ideal, no-load average output voltage &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{av}&lt;/math&gt; of the B6 circuit results from the integral under the graph of a DC voltage pulse with the period duration of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3} \pi&lt;/math&gt; (from 60° to 120°) with the peak value &lt;math&gt;\hat v_{\mathrm{DC}} = \sqrt 3 \cdot V_\mathrm{peak}&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;div style="overflow:auto;&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{dc}=V_\mathrm {av} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{3} \pi} \int_{60^\circ}^{120^\circ} \sqrt 3 \cdot V_\mathrm{peak} \cdot \sin\varphi \cdot \mathrm d\varphi = \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt 3 \cdot V_\mathrm{peak}}{\pi} \cdot \left(-\cos 120^\circ + \cos 60^\circ \right) = \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt 3 \cdot V_\mathrm{peak}}{\pi} \cdot \Biggl[-\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)+\frac{1}{2} \Biggl] = \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot V_\mathrm{peak}}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
: ⇒ &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{dc}=V_\mathrm {av}= \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt 2 \cdot V_\mathrm{LN}}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; ⇒ &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm {av} = \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt 6 \cdot V_\mathrm{LN}}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 2,34 ⋅ &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{LN}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:3 phase rectification 2.svg|thumb|200px|3-phase AC input, half-wave and full-wave rectified DC output waveforms]]

If the three-phase bridge rectifier is operated symmetrically (as positive and negative supply voltage), the center point of the rectifier on the output side (or the so-called isolated reference potential) opposite the center point of the transformer (or the neutral conductor) has a potential difference in form of a triangular [[Common-mode signal|common-mode voltage]]. For this reason, the two centers must never be connected to each other, otherwise short-circuit currents would flow. The [[Ground (electricity)|ground]] of the three-phase bridge rectifier in symmetrical operation is thus decoupled from the neutral conductor or the [[Ground and neutral|earth]] of the mains voltage. Powered by a transformer, earthing of the center point of the bridge is possible, provided that the secondary winding of the transformer is electrically isolated from the mains voltage and the star point of the secondary winding is not on earth. In this case, however, (negligible) leakage currents are flowing over the transformer windings.

The common-mode voltage is formed out of the respective average values of the differences between the positive and negative phase voltages, which form the pulsating DC voltage. The peak value of the delta voltage &lt;math&gt;\hat v_{\mathrm{common-mode}}&lt;/math&gt; amounts ¼ of the peak value of the phase input voltage &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{peak}&lt;/math&gt; and is calculated with &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{peak}&lt;/math&gt; minus half of the DC voltage at 60° of the period:

: &lt;math&gt;\hat v_{\mathrm{common-mode}} = V_\mathrm{peak} - \frac{\sqrt 3 \cdot V_\mathrm{peak} \cdot \sin 60^\circ}{2} = V_\mathrm{peak} \cdot \Biggl( 1- \frac{\sqrt 3 \cdot \sin 60^\circ}{2} \Biggl)&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{peak}&lt;/math&gt; · 0,25

The RMS value of the common-mode voltage is calculated from the form factor for triangular oscillations:

: &lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{common-mode}} = \frac{\hat v_{\mathrm{common-mode}}}{\sqrt 3}&lt;/math&gt;

If the circuit is operated asymmetrically (as a simple supply voltage with just one positive pole), both the positive and negative poles (or the isolated reference potential) are pulsating opposite the center (or the ground) of the input voltage analogously to the positive and negative waveforms of the phase voltages. However, the differences in the phase voltages result in the six-pulse DC voltage (over the duration of a period). The strict separation of the transformer center from the negative pole (otherwise short-circuit currents will flow) or a possible grounding of the negative pole when powered by an isolating transformer apply correspondingly to the symmetrical operation.

==== Three-phase bridge rectifier controlled  ====
The controlled three-phase bridge rectifier uses thyristors in place of diodes. The output voltage is reduced by the factor cos(α):

: &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{dc}=V_\mathrm {av}=\frac{3\cdot {\sqrt 3}\cdot V_\mathrm{peak}}{\pi} \cdot \cos \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Or, expressed in terms of the line to line input voltage:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimbark|first=Edward Wilson|title=Direct current transmission.|year=1971|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-47580-4|pages=508|edition=4. printing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{dc}=V_\mathrm {av}=\frac{3 \cdot V_\mathrm {LLpeak}}{\pi} \cdot \cos \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
: ''V''&lt;sub&gt;LLpeak&lt;/sub&gt;, the peak value of the line to line input voltages,
: ''V''&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;, the peak value of the phase (line to neutral) input voltages,
: α, firing angle of the thyristor (0 if diodes are used to perform rectification)

The above equations are only valid when no current is drawn from the AC supply or in the theoretical case when the AC supply connections have no inductance.  In practice, the supply inductance causes a reduction of DC output voltage with increasing load, typically in the range 10–20% at full load.

The effect of supply inductance is to slow down the transfer process (called commutation) from one phase to the next.  As result of this is that at each transition between a pair of devices, there is a period of overlap during which three (rather than two) devices in the bridge are conducting simultaneously.  The overlap angle is usually referred to by the symbol μ (or u), and may be 20&amp;nbsp;30° at full load.

With supply inductance taken into account, the output voltage of the rectifier is reduced to:

: &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{dc}=V_\mathrm {av}=\frac{3\cdot V_\mathrm {LLpeak}}{\pi} \cdot \cos (\alpha + \mu)&lt;/math&gt;

The overlap angle μ is directly related to the DC current, and the above equation may be re-expressed as:

: &lt;math&gt;{V_\mathrm{dc}=V_\mathrm {av}=\frac{3\cdot V_\mathrm {LLpeak}}{\pi} \cdot \cos(\alpha) } - {6 f L_\mathrm {c} I_\mathrm {d} }&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
: ''L''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, the commutating inductance per phase
: ''I''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, the direct current

==== Twelve-pulse bridge ====
[[File:12 pulse bridge.png|thumb|left|350px|Twelve pulse bridge rectifier using [[thyristor]]s as the switching elements]]
Although better than single-phase rectifiers or three-phase half-wave rectifiers, six-pulse rectifier circuits still produce considerable harmonic distortion on both the AC and DC connections.  For very high-power rectifiers the twelve-pulse bridge connection is usually used.  A twelve-pulse bridge consists of two six-pulse bridge circuits connected in series, with their AC connections fed from a supply transformer that produces a 30° phase shift between the two bridges.  This cancels many of the characteristic harmonics the six-pulse bridges produce.

The 30 degree phase shift is usually achieved by using a transformer with two sets of secondary windings, one in star (wye) connection and one in delta connection.

=== Voltage-multiplying rectifiers ===
{{Main|Voltage multiplier}}
{{See also|Voltage doubler}}
[[File:Switcheable rectifier.svg|thumb|300px|Switchable full bridge/voltage doubler.]]
The simple half-wave rectifier can be built in two electrical configurations with the diodes pointing in opposite directions, one version connects the negative terminal of the output direct to the AC supply and the other connects the positive terminal of the output direct to the AC supply. By combining both of these with separate output smoothing it is possible to get an output voltage of nearly double the peak AC input voltage. This also provides a tap in the middle, which allows use of such a circuit as a split rail power supply.

A variant of this is to use two capacitors in series for the output smoothing on a bridge rectifier then place a switch between the midpoint of those capacitors and one of the AC input terminals. With the switch open, this circuit acts like a normal bridge rectifier. With the switch closed, it act like a voltage doubling rectifier. In other words, this makes it easy to derive a voltage of roughly 320&amp;nbsp;V (±15%, approx.) DC from any 120&amp;nbsp;V or 230&amp;nbsp;V mains supply in the world, this can then be fed into a relatively simple [[switched-mode power supply]]. However, for a given desired ripple, the value of both capacitors must be twice the value of the single one required for a normal bridge rectifier; when the switch is closed each one must filter the output of a half-wave rectifier, and when the switch is open the two capacitors are connected in series with an equivalent value of half one of them.

[[File:Cockcroft Walton Voltage multiplier.png|thumb|left|250px|Cockcroft Walton voltage multiplier]]Cascaded diode and capacitor stages can be added to make a voltage multiplier ([[Cockcroft-Walton generator|Cockroft-Walton circuit]]). These circuits are capable of producing a DC output voltage potential up to about ten times the peak AC input voltage, in practice limited by current capacity and voltage regulation issues. Diode voltage multipliers, frequently used as a trailing boost stage or primary high voltage (HV) source, are used in HV laser power supplies, powering devices such as [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRT) (like those used in CRT based television, radar and sonar displays), photon amplifying devices found in image intensifying and photo multiplier tubes (PMT), and magnetron based radio frequency (RF) devices used in radar transmitters and microwave ovens. Before the introduction of semiconductor electronics, [[AC/DC receiver design|transformerless vacuum tube receivers]] powered directly from AC power sometimes used voltage doublers to generate roughly 300&amp;nbsp;VDC from a 100–120&amp;nbsp;V power line.

== Quantification of rectifiers ==
{{merge from|section=1|Transformer utilization factor|date=November 2017}}
{{missing info|section|conversion ratios for at least three-phase half-wave and full-wave rectification, since these rectifiers have their own sections in this article.|date=October 2017}}
Several ratios are used to quantify the function and performance of rectifiers or their output, including transformer utilization factor (TUF), conversion ratio (&lt;big&gt;''η''&lt;/big&gt;), ripple factor, form factor, and peak factor.  The two primary measures are DC voltage (or offset) and peak-peak ripple voltage, which are constituent components of the output.

Conversion ratio (also called "rectification ratio", and confusingly, "efficiency") &lt;big&gt;''η''&lt;/big&gt; is defined as the ratio of DC output power to the input power from the AC supply.  Even with ideal rectifiers, the ratio is less than 100% because some of the output power is AC power rather than DC which manifests as ripple superimposed on the DC waveform.  The ratio can be improved with the use of smoothing circuits which reduce the ripple and hence reduce the AC content of the output. Conversion ratio is reduced by losses in transformer windings and power dissipation in the rectifier element itself. This ratio is of little practical significance because a rectifier is almost always followed by a filter to increase DC voltage and reduce ripple.  In some three-phase and multi-phase applications the conversion ratio is high enough that smoothing circuitry is unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Middleton, Mac E. Van Valkenburg (eds), ''Reference Data for Engineers: Radio, Electronics, Computer, and Communications'', p. 14. 13, Newnes, 2002 {{ISBN|0-7506-7291-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In other circuits, like filament heater circuits in vacuum tube electronics where the load is almost entirely resistive, smoothing circuitry may be omitted because resistors dissipate both AC and DC power,so no power is lost.

For a half-wave rectifier the ratio is very modest.

: &lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm {AC} = {V_\mathrm{peak} \over 2} \cdot {I_\mathrm {peak} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;    (the divisors are 2 rather than {{radic|2}} because no power is delivered on the negative half-cycle)

: &lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm {DC} = {V_\mathrm{peak} \over \pi} \cdot {I_\mathrm {peak} \over \pi}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus maximum conversion ratio for a half-wave rectifier is,

: &lt;math&gt;\eta = {P_\mathrm {DC} \over P_\mathrm {AC}} \approx 40.5\% &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for a full-wave rectifier,

: &lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm {AC} = {V_\mathrm{peak} \over \sqrt 2} \cdot {I_\mathrm {peak} \over \sqrt 2}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm {DC} = {2 \cdot V_\mathrm{peak} \over \pi} \cdot {2 \cdot I_\mathrm {peak} \over \pi}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\eta = {P_\mathrm {DC} \over P_\mathrm {AC}} \approx 81.0\% &lt;/math&gt;

Three-phase rectifiers, especially three-phase full-wave rectifiers, have much greater conversion ratios because the ripple is intrinsically smaller.

For a three-phase half-wave rectifier,

: &lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm {AC} = 3 \cdot {V_\mathrm{peak} \over 2} \cdot {I_\mathrm {peak} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm {DC} = \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot V_\mathrm{peak}}{2 \pi} \cdot \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot I_\mathrm{peak}}{2 \pi}&lt;/math&gt;

For a three-phase full-wave rectifier,

: &lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm {AC} = 3 \cdot {V_\mathrm{peak} \over \sqrt 2} \cdot {I_\mathrm {peak} \over \sqrt 2}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm {DC} = \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot V_\mathrm{peak}} \pi \cdot \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot I_\mathrm{peak}} \pi&lt;/math&gt;

== Rectifier voltage drop ==
A real rectifier characteristically drops part of the input voltage (a voltage drop, for silicon devices, of typically 0.7 volts plus an equivalent resistance, in general non-linear)—and at high frequencies, distorts waveforms in other ways. Unlike an ideal rectifier, it dissipates some power.

An aspect of most rectification is a loss from the peak input voltage to the peak output voltage, caused by the built-in voltage drop across the diodes (around 0.7 V for ordinary silicon [[p–n junction]] diodes and 0.3 V for [[Schottky diode]]s). Half-wave rectification and full-wave rectification using a center-tapped secondary produces a peak voltage loss of one diode drop. Bridge rectification has a loss of two diode drops. This reduces output voltage, and limits the available output voltage if a very low alternating voltage must be rectified. As the diodes do not conduct below this voltage, the circuit only passes current through for a portion of each half-cycle, causing short segments of zero voltage (where instantaneous input voltage is below one or two diode drops) to appear between each "hump".

Peak loss is very important for low voltage rectifiers (for example, 12&amp;nbsp;V or less) but is insignificant in high-voltage applications such as HVDC power transmission systems.

== Harmonic distortion ==
Non-linear loads like rectifiers produce current harmonics of the source frequency on the AC side and voltage harmonics of the source frequency on the DC side, due to switching behavior.

== Rectifier output smoothing ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
{{merge from|section=1|Ripple (electrical)#Ripple voltage|date=November 2017}}
[[File:Half-wave rectifier waveform.png|thumb|right|The AC input (yellow) and DC output (green) of a half-wave rectifier with a smoothing capacitor. Note the ripple in the DC signal.]]  While half-wave and full-wave rectification deliver unidirectional current, neither produces a constant voltage. There is a large AC [[ripple (electrical)|ripple]] voltage component at the source frequency for a half-wave rectifier, and twice the source frequency for a full-wave rectifier.  Ripple voltage is usually specified peak-to-peak. Producing steady DC from a rectified AC supply requires a smoothing circuit or [[electronic filter|filter]]. In its simplest form this can be just a capacitor (also called a filter, reservoir, or smoothing capacitor), choke, resistor, Zener diode and resistor, or voltage regulator placed at the output of the rectifier.  In practice, most smoothing filters utilize multiple components to efficiently reduce ripple voltage to a level tolerable by the circuit.
[[File:RC filter.svg|thumb|400px|Full-wave diode-bridge rectifier with parallel RC shunt filter]]

The filter capacitor releases its stored energy during the part of the AC cycle when the AC source does not supply any power, that is, when the AC source changes its direction of flow of current.

===Performance with low impedance source===
[[Image:Reservoircapidealised.gif]]

The above diagram shows reservoir performance from a near zero [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] source, such as a mains supply. As the rectifier [[voltage]] increases, it charges the capacitor and also supplies [[Electric current|current]] to the load. At the end of the quarter cycle, the capacitor is charged to its peak value Vp of the rectifier voltage. Following this, the rectifier voltage starts to decrease to its minimum value Vmin as it enters the next quarter cycle. This initiates the discharge of the capacitor through the load.

The size of the capacitor C is determined by the amount of ripple r that can be tolerated, where r=(Vp-Vmin)/Vp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cartwright|first1=Kenneth|last2=Kaminsky|first2=Edit|title=New equations for capacitance vs ripple in power supplies|journal=Latin American Journal of Physics Education|date=2017|volume=11|issue=1|page=1301-01 1301-11|url=http://www.lajpe.org/mar17/1301_Kenneth_2017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These circuits are very frequently fed from [[transformer]]s, and have significant [[Electrical resistance|resistance]]. Transformer resistance modifies the reservoir capacitor waveform, changes the peak voltage, and introduces regulation issues.

=== Capacitor input filter ===
{{merge from|Filter capacitor|section=1|date=November 2017}}
{{merge from|Capacitor-input filter|section=1|date=November 2017}}
For a given load, sizing of a smoothing capacitor is a [[tradeoff]] between reducing ripple voltage and increasing ripple current. The peak current is set by the rate of rise of the supply voltage on the rising edge of the incoming sine-wave, reduced by the resistance of the transformer windings.  High ripple currents increase I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R losses (in the form of heat) in the capacitor, rectifier and transformer windings, and may exceed the ampacity of the components or VA rating of the transformer.  Vacuum tube rectifiers specify the maximum capacitance of the input capacitor, and SS diode rectifiers also have current limitations.  Capacitors for this application need low [[Equivalent series resistance|ESR]], or ripple current may overheat them.   To limit ripple voltage to a specified value the required capacitor size is proportional to the load current and inversely proportional to the supply frequency and the number of output peaks of the rectifier per input cycle. Full-wave rectified output requires a smaller capacitor because it is double the frequency of half-wave rectified output.  To reduce ripple to a satisfactory limit with just a single capacitor would often require a capacitor that's infeasibly large.

=== Choke input filter ===
It is also possible to put the rectified waveform into a [[choke-input filter]].  The advantage of this circuit is that the current waveform is smoother: current is drawn over the entire cycle, instead of being drawn in pulses at the peaks of AC voltage each half-cycle as in a capacitor input filter.  The disadvantage is that the voltage output is much lower – the average of an AC half-cycle rather than the peak; this is about 90% of the RMS voltage versus &lt;math&gt;\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt; times the RMS voltage (unloaded) for a capacitor input filter.  Offsetting this is superior voltage regulation and higher available current, which reduce peak voltage and ripple current demands on power supply components.  Inductors require [[Magnetic core|cores]] of iron or other magnetic materials, and add weight and size.  Their use in power supplies for electronic equipment has therefore dwindled in favour of semiconductor circuits such as voltage regulators.

=== Resistor as input filter ===
In cases where ripple voltage is insignificant, like battery chargers, the input filter may be a single series resistor to adjust the output voltage to that required by the circuit.  A resistor reduces both output voltage and ripple voltage proportionately.  A disadvantage of a resistor input filter is that it consumes power in the form of waste heat that is not available to the load, so it is employed only in low current circuits.

=== Higher order and cascade filters ===
To further reduce ripple, the initial filter element may be followed by additional alternating series and shunt filter components, or by a voltage regulator.  Series filter components may be resistors or chokes; shunt elements may be resistors or capacitors.  The filter may raise DC voltage as
well as reduce ripple.  Filters are often constructed from pairs of series/shunt components called RC (series resistor, shunt capacitor) or LC (series choke, shunt capacitor) sections.  Two common filter geometries are known as Pi (capacitor, choke, capacitor) and T (choke, capacitor, choke) filters.
Sometimes the series elements are resistors - because resistors are smaller and cheaper - when a lower DC output is desirable or permissible.  Another
kind of special filter geometry is a [[series resonant choke]] or tuned choke filter.  Unlike the other filter geometries which are low-pass filters, a resonant choke filter is a band-stop filter: it is a parallel combination of choke and capacitor which resonates at the frequency of the ripple voltage, presenting a very high impedance to the ripple.  It may be followed by a shunt capacitor to complete the filter.

=== Voltage regulators ===
A more usual alternative to additional filter components, if the DC load requires very low ripple voltage, is to follow the input filter with a voltage regulator.  A voltage regulator operates on a different principle than a filter, which is essentially a voltage divider that shunts voltage at the ripple frequency away from the load.  Rather, a regulator increases or decreases current supplied to the load in order to maintain a constant output voltage.

A simple passive shunt voltage regulator may consist of a series resistor to drop source voltage to the required level and a Zener diode shunt with reverse
voltage equal to the set voltage.  When input voltage rises, the diode dumps current to maintain the set output voltage.  This kind of regulator is usually employed only in low voltage, low current circuits because Zener diodes have both voltage and current limitations.  It is also very inefficient, because it dumps excess current, which is not available to the load.

A more efficient alternative to a shunt voltage regulator is an [[Voltage regulator#Active regulators|active voltage regulator]] circuit.  An active regulator employs reactive components to store and discharge energy, so that most or all current supplied by the rectifier is passed to the load. It may also use negative and positive feedback in conjunction with at least one voltage amplifying component like a transistor to maintain output voltage when source voltage drops.  The input filter must prevent the troughs of the ripple dropping below the minimum voltage required by the regulator to produce the required output voltage.  The regulator serves both to significantly reduce the ripple and to deal with variations in supply and load characteristics.

== Applications ==
{{See also|Capacitive power supply}}
The primary application of rectifiers is to derive DC power from an AC supply (AC to DC converter). Rectifiers are used inside the power supplies of virtually all electronic equipment.  AC/DC power supplies may be broadly divided into linear [[power supply|power supplies]] and [[switched-mode power supplies]].  In such power supplies, the rectifier will be in series following the transformer, and be followed by a smoothing filter and possibly a voltage regulator.

Converting DC power from one voltage to another is much more complicated.  One method of DC-to-DC conversion first converts power to AC (using a device called an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]]), then uses a transformer to change the voltage, and finally rectifies power back to DC. A frequency of typically several tens of kilohertz is used, as this requires much smaller inductance than at lower frequencies and obviates the use of heavy, bulky, and expensive iron-cored units. Another method of converting DC voltages uses a [[charge pump]], using rapid switching to change the connections of capacitors; this technique is generally limited to supplies up to a couple of watts, owing to the size of capacitors required.

[[File:Regulated rectifier.gif|thumb|left|Output voltage of a full-wave rectifier with controlled thyristors]]

Rectifiers are also used for [[Detector (radio)|detection]] of [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]] radio signals. The signal may be amplified before detection. If not, a very low voltage drop diode or a diode biased with a fixed voltage must be used. When using a rectifier for demodulation the capacitor and load resistance must be carefully matched: too low a capacitance makes the high frequency carrier pass to the output, and too high makes the capacitor just charge and stay charged.

Rectifiers supply polarised voltage for [[welding]]. In such circuits control of the output current is required; this is sometimes achieved by replacing some of the diodes in a [[bridge rectifier]] with [[thyristor]]s, effectively diodes whose voltage output can be regulated by switching on and off with [[phase fired controllers]].

Thyristors are used in various classes of [[railway]] [[rolling stock]] systems so that fine control of the traction motors can be achieved. [[Gate turn-off thyristor]]s are used to produce alternating current from a DC supply, for example on the Eurostar Trains to power the three-phase traction motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mansell|first1=A.D.|last2=Shen|first2=J.|title=Pulse converters in traction applications|journal=Power Engineering Journal|date=1 January 1994|volume=8|issue=4|pages=183|doi=10.1049/pe:19940407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rectification technologies ==

=== Electromechanical ===
Before about 1905 when tube type rectifiers were developed, power conversion devices were purely electro-mechanical in design. Mechanical rectification systems used some form of rotation or resonant vibration (e.g. [[#Vibrator|vibrators]]) driven by electromagnets, which operated a switch or commutator to reverse the current.

These mechanical rectifiers were noisy and had high maintenance requirements.  The moving parts had friction, which required lubrication and replacement due to wear. Opening mechanical contacts under load resulted in electrical arcs and sparks that heated and eroded the contacts.  They also were not able to handle AC [[frequency|frequencies]] above several thousand cycles per second.

==== Synchronous rectifier ====
{{main|Synchronous rectification}}
To convert alternating into direct current in [[electric locomotive]]s, a synchronous rectifier may be used.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} It consists of a synchronous motor driving a set of heavy-duty electrical contacts. The motor spins in time with the AC frequency and periodically reverses the connections to the load at an instant when the sinusoidal current goes through a zero-crossing. The contacts do not have to ''switch'' a large current, but they must be able to ''carry'' a large current to supply the locomotive's DC [[traction motor]]s.

==== {{anchor|Vibrator}}Vibrating rectifier ====
{{Main|Mechanical rectifier}}
[[File:Vibrator rectifier battery charger.jpg|thumb|A [[vibrator (electronic)|vibrator]] battery charger from 1922.  It produced 6A DC at 6V to charge automobile batteries.]]
These consisted of a resonant [[reed switch|reed]], vibrated by an alternating magnetic field created by an AC [[electromagnet]], with contacts that reversed the direction of the current on the negative half cycles.  They were used in low power devices, such as [[battery charger]]s, to rectify the low voltage produced by a step-down transformer.  Another use was in battery power supplies for portable vacuum tube radios, to provide the high DC voltage for the tubes.  These operated as a mechanical version of modern solid state switching [[inverter]]s, with a transformer to step the battery voltage up, and a set of vibrator contacts on the transformer core, operated by its magnetic field, to repeatedly break the DC battery current to create a pulsing AC to power the transformer.  Then a second set of [[mechanical rectifier|rectifier contacts]] on the [[vibrator (electronic)|vibrator]] rectified the high AC voltage from the transformer secondary to DC.
{{breakafterimages}}

==== Motor-generator set ====
{{Main|Motor-generator|Rotary converter}}
[[File:Rotierender Umformer.jpg|thumb|A small motor-generator set]]
A ''motor-generator set'', or the similar ''rotary converter'', is not strictly a rectifier as it does not actually ''rectify'' current, but rather ''generates'' DC from an AC source. In an "M-G set", the shaft of an AC motor is mechanically coupled to that of a DC [[Electrical generator|generator]]. The DC generator produces multiphase alternating currents in its [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] windings, which a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] on the armature shaft converts into a direct current output; or a [[homopolar generator]] produces a direct current without the need for a commutator. M-G sets are useful for producing DC for railway traction motors, industrial motors and other high-current applications, and were common in many high-power D.C. uses (for example, carbon-arc lamp projectors for outdoor theaters) before high-power semiconductors became widely available.

A more complex device of this kind was patented by G. W. Carpenter in 1928 (US Patent 1671970).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent| country = US| number = 1671970| status = patent| title = Liquid Rectifier| gdate = 1928-06-05| fdate = 1921-06-07| invent1 = Glenn W. Carpenter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When two different metals are suspended in an electrolyte solution, direct current flowing one way through the solution sees less resistance than in the other direction. Electrolytic rectifiers most commonly used an aluminum anode and a lead or steel cathode, suspended in a solution of tri-ammonium ortho-phosphate.

The rectification action is due to a thin coating of aluminum hydroxide on the aluminum electrode, formed by first applying a strong current to the cell to build up the coating. The rectification process is temperature-sensitive, and for best efficiency should not operate above 86&amp;nbsp;°F (30&amp;nbsp;°C). There is also a [[breakdown voltage]] where the coating is penetrated and the cell is short-circuited. Electrochemical methods are often more fragile than mechanical methods, and can be sensitive to usage variations, which can drastically change or completely disrupt the rectification processes.

Similar electrolytic devices were used as lightning arresters around the same era by suspending many aluminium cones in a tank of tri-ammonium ortho-phosphate solution. Unlike the rectifier above, only aluminium electrodes were used, and used on A.C., there was no polarization and thus no rectifier action, but the chemistry was similar.&lt;ref name="Society1920"&gt;{{cite book|author=American Technical Society|title=Cyclopedia of applied electricity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PcN-AAAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 January 2013|volume=2|year=1920|publisher=American technical society|page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[electrolytic capacitor]], an essential component of most rectifier circuit configurations was also developed from the electrolytic rectifier.

=== Plasma type ===
The development of [[vacuum tube]] technology in the early 20th century resulted in the invention of various tube-type rectifiers, which largely replaced the noisy, inefficient mechanical rectifiers.

A rectifier used in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission systems and industrial processing between about 1909 to 1975 is a ''mercury-arc rectifier'' or ''mercury-arc valve''. The device is enclosed in a bulbous glass vessel or large metal tub. One electrode, the [[cathode]], is submerged in a pool of liquid mercury at the bottom of the vessel and one or more high purity graphite electrodes, called [[anode]]s, are suspended above the pool. There may be several auxiliary electrodes to aid in starting and maintaining the arc. When an electric arc is established between the cathode pool and suspended anodes, a stream of electrons flows from the cathode to the anodes through the ionized mercury, but not the other way (in principle, this is a higher-power counterpart to [[flame rectification]], which uses the same one-way current transmission properties of the plasma naturally present in a flame).

These devices can be used at power levels of hundreds of kilowatts, and may be built to handle one to six phases of AC current. Mercury-arc rectifiers have been replaced by silicon semiconductor rectifiers and high-power [[thyristor]] circuits in the mid 1970s. The most powerful mercury-arc rectifiers ever built were installed in the [[Manitoba Hydro]] [[Nelson River Bipole]] HVDC project, with a combined rating of more than 1 GW and 450 kV.&lt;ref&gt;Pictures of a mercury-arc rectifier in operation can be seen here: [http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/sites/b/belsize_park_deep_shelter/index14.shtml Belsize Park deep shelter rectifier 1], [http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/sites/b/belsize_park_deep_shelter/index13.shtml Belsize Park deep shelter rectifier 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sood1&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Tungar bulbs.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Tungar bulbs from 1917, 2 ampere ''(left)'' and 6 ampere]]

The [[General Electric]] Tungar rectifier was a [[Mercury (element)|mercury vapor]] (ex.:5B24) or [[argon]] (ex.:328) [[gas-filled tube|gas-filled electron tube]] device with a tungsten filament cathode and a carbon button anode. It operated similarly to the thermionic vacuum tube diode, but the gas in the tube ionized during forward conduction, giving it a much lower forward voltage drop so it could rectify lower voltages. It was used for battery chargers and similar applications from the 1920s until lower-cost [[metal rectifier]]s, and later semiconductor diodes, supplanted it. These were made up to a few hundred volts and a few amperes rating, and in some sizes strongly resembled an [[incandescent lamp]] with an additional electrode.

The 0Z4 was a gas-filled rectifier tube commonly used in [[vacuum tube]] car radios in the 1940s and 1950s. It was a conventional full-wave rectifier tube with two anodes and one cathode, but was unique in that it had no filament (thus the "0" in its type number). The electrodes were shaped such that the reverse breakdown voltage was much higher than the forward breakdown voltage. Once the breakdown voltage was exceeded, the 0Z4 switched to a low-resistance state with a forward voltage drop of about 24 V.

=== Diode vacuum tube (valve) ===
{{See also|List of vacuum tubes}}
[[File:FRec var.jpg|thumb|Vacuum tube diodes]]

The [[thermionic emission|thermionic]] [[vacuum tube]] [[diode]], originally called the [[Fleming valve]], was invented by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904 as a detector for radio waves in radio receivers, and evolved into a general rectifier.  It consisted of an evacuated glass bulb with a [[electrical filament|filament]] heated by a separate current, and a metal plate [[anode]].  The filament emitted [[electron]]s by [[thermionic emission]] (the Edison effect), discovered by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1884, and a positive voltage on the plate caused a current of electrons through the tube from filament to plate.  Since only the filament produced electrons, the tube would only conduct current in one direction, allowing the tube to rectify an alternating current.

Thermionic diode rectifiers were widely used in power supplies in vacuum tube consumer electronic products, such as phonographs, radios, and televisions, for example the [[All American Five]] radio receiver, to provide the high DC plate voltage needed by other vacuum tubes.  "Full-wave" versions with two separate plates were popular because they could be used with a center-tapped transformer to make a full-wave rectifier.  Vacuum tube rectifiers were made for very high voltages, such as the high voltage power supply for the [[cathode ray tube]] of [[television]] receivers, and the kenotron used for power supply in [[X-ray]] equipment.  However, compared to modern semiconductor diodes, vacuum tube rectifiers have high internal resistance due to [[space charge]] and therefore high voltage drops, causing high power dissipation and low efficiency.  They are rarely able to handle currents exceeding 250&amp;nbsp;mA owing to the limits of plate power dissipation, and cannot be used for low voltage applications,  such as battery chargers. Another limitation of the vacuum tube rectifier is that the heater power supply often requires special arrangements to insulate it from the high voltages of the rectifier circuit.

==== Crystal detector ====
{{Main|Crystal detector}}
[[File:CatWhisker.jpg|thumb|Galena cat's whisker detector]]
The crystal detector was the earliest type of semiconductor diode. Invented by [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] and developed by [[Greenleaf Whittier Pickard|G. W. Pickard]] starting in 1902, it was a significant improvement over earlier detectors such as the coherer. The crystal detector was widely used prior to vacuum tubes becoming available. One popular type of crystal detector, often called a ''cat's whisker detector'', consists of a crystal of some [[semiconductor|semiconducting]] [[mineral]], usually [[galena]] (lead sulfide), with a light springy wire touching its surface. Its fragility and limited current capability made it unsuitable for power supply applications. In the 1930s, researchers [[Diode#Solid-state_diodes|miniaturized and improved]] the crystal detector for use at microwave frequencies.

==== Selenium and copper oxide rectifiers ====
{{Main|Metal rectifier}}
[[File:Selenium Rectifier.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Selenium rectifier]]
Once common until replaced by more compact and less costly silicon solid-state rectifiers in the 1970s, these units used stacks of oxide-coated metal plates and took advantage of the [[semiconductor]] properties of [[selenium]] or copper oxide.&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Westman et al., (ed), ''[http://lccn.loc.gov/43014665 Reference Data for Radio Engineers, Fifth Edition]'', 1968, Howard W. Sams and Co., no ISBN, Library of Congress Card No. 43-14665 chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt; While [[selenium rectifier]]s were lighter in weight and used less power than comparable vacuum tube rectifiers, they had the disadvantage of finite life expectancy, increasing resistance with age, and were only suitable to use at low frequencies. Both selenium and copper oxide rectifiers have somewhat better tolerance of momentary voltage transients than silicon rectifiers.

Typically these rectifiers were made up of stacks of metal plates or washers, held together by a central bolt, with the number of stacks determined by voltage; each cell was rated for about 20 V. An automotive battery charger rectifier might have only one cell: the high-voltage power supply for a [[vacuum tube]] might have dozens of stacked plates. Current density in an air-cooled selenium stack was about 600 mA per square inch of active area (about 90 mA per square centimeter).

[[File:Dioden.JPG|thumb|A variety of silicon diodes of different current ratings. At left is a [[bridge rectifier]]. On the 3 center diodes, a painted band identifies the cathode terminal]] 
[[Silicon]] diodes are the most widely used rectifiers for lower voltages and powers, and have largely replaced other rectifiers.   Due to their substantially lower forward voltage (0.3V versus 0.7V for silicon diodes) germanium diodes have an inherent advantage over silicon diodes in low voltage circuits.

==== High power: thyristors (SCRs) and newer silicon-based voltage sourced converters ====
{{main|Silicon controlled rectifier}}
[[File:Manitoba Hydro-BipoleII Valve.jpg|thumb|200px|Two of three high-power thyristor valve stacks used for long distance transmission of power from [[Manitoba Hydro]] dams. Compare with mercury-arc system from the same dam-site, above.]]

In high-power applications, from 1975 to 2000, most mercury valve arc-rectifiers were replaced by stacks of very high power [[thyristor]]s, silicon devices with two extra layers of semiconductor, in comparison to a simple diode.

In medium-power transmission applications, even more complex and sophisticated [[voltage sourced converter]] (VSC) silicon semiconductor rectifier systems, such as [[IGBT transistor|insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT)]] and [[Gate turn-off thyristor|gate turn-off thyristors (GTO)]], have made smaller high voltage DC power transmission systems economical. All of these devices function as rectifiers.

{{As of|2009}} it was expected that these high-power silicon "self-commutating switches", in particular IGBTs and a variant thyristor (related to the GTO) called the [[integrated gate-commutated thyristor]] (IGCT), would be scaled-up in power rating to the point that they would eventually replace simple thyristor-based AC rectification systems for the highest power-transmission DC applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Jos|last1=Arrillaga|first2=Yonghe H|last2=Liu|first3=Neville R|last3=Watson|first4=Nicholas J|last4=Murray|title=Self-Commutating Converters for High Power Applications|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-68212-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current research ==
A major area of research is to develop higher frequency rectifiers, that can rectify into terahertz and light frequencies.  These devices are used in [[optical heterodyne detection]], which has myriad applications in [[optical fiber]] communication and [[atomic clock]]s.  Another prospective application for such devices is to directly rectify light waves picked up by tiny [[antenna (radio)|antennas]], called [[nantenna]]s, to produce DC electric power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt?open=514&amp;objID=1269&amp;mode=2&amp;featurestory=DA_10104|title=Harvesting the sun's energy with antennas|year=2007|author=Idaho National Laboratory|accessdate=2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that arrays of nantennas could be a more efficient means of producing [[solar power]] than [[solar cell]]s.

A related area of research is to develop smaller rectifiers, because a smaller device has a higher cutoff frequency.  Research projects are attempting to develop a [[unimolecular rectifier]], a single [[organic molecule]] that would function as a rectifier.

[[File:Screws.jpg|thumb|right|260px|An assortment of screws]]
[[File:BOLT SCREW UBT 198.JPG|thumb|260px|A bolt and a screw]]
A '''screw''' is a type of [[fastener]], in some ways similar to a [[Bolt (fastener)|bolt]] (see ''[[Screw#Differentiation between bolt and screw|Differentiation between bolt and screw]]'' below), typically made of metal, and characterized by a [[helix|helical]] ridge, known as a ''male thread'' (external thread). Screws are used to fasten materials by digging in and wedging into a material when turned, while the thread cuts grooves in the fastened material that may help pull fastened materials together and  prevent pull-out. There are many screws for a variety of materials; those commonly fastened by screws include wood, sheet metal, and plastic.

==Explanation==
A screw is a combination of [[simple machines]]—it is in essence an [[inclined plane]] wrapped around a central shaft, but the inclined plane (thread) also comes to a sharp edge around the outside, which acts a wedge as it pushes into the fastened material, and the shaft and helix also form a wedge in the form of the point. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, known as a ''female thread'' (internal thread), often in the form of a nut, or object that has the internal thread formed into it.  Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted.  The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects.

[[File:Wood screw with legend.svg|thumb|A wood screw: a) head; b) not threaded shank; c) threaded shank; d) tip.]]

A screw will usually have a ''head'' on one end that contains a specially formed shape that allows it to be turned, or ''driven'', with a tool. Common tools for driving screws include [[screwdriver]]s and [[wrench]]es. The head is usually larger than the body of the screw, which keeps the screw from being driven deeper than the length of the screw and to provide a ''[[bearing surface]]''. There are exceptions; for instance, carriage bolts have a domed head that is not designed to be driven; [[set screw]]s often have a head smaller than the outer [[diameter]] of the screw; J-bolts have a J-shaped head which is not designed to be driven, but rather is usually sunk into concrete allowing it to be used as an anchor bolt. The cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is known as the ''shank''; it may be fully threaded or partially threaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1990|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The distance between each thread is called the "pitch".

The majority of screws are tightened by [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise]] rotation, which is termed a ''right-hand thread''; a common [[mnemonic device]] for remembering this when working with screws or bolts is "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey". If the fingers of the right hand are curled around a right-hand thread, it will move in the direction of the thumb when turned in the same direction as the fingers are curled.  Screws with left-hand threads are used in exceptional cases, where loads would tend to loosen a right handed fastener, or when non-interchangeability with right-hand fasteners is required. For example, when the screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque (which would work to undo a right-hand thread), a left-hand-threaded screw would be an appropriate choice. The left side [[Bicycle pedal#Attachment|pedal]] of a [[bicycle]] has a left-hand thread.

More generally, screw may mean any helical device, such as a clamp, a [[micrometer]], a ship's [[propeller]], or an [[Archimedes' screw]] water pump.

==Differentiation between bolt and screw==
[[File:Bolt (PSF).png|thumb|A carriage bolt with a square nut]]
[[File:DIN6914 UNI5587.jpg|thumb|upright|A structural bolt with a hex nut and washer]]

There is no universally accepted distinction between a screw and a bolt. A simple distinction that is often true, although not always, is that a bolt passes through a substrate and takes a nut on the other side, whereas a screw takes no nut because it threads directly into the substrate (a screw ''screws into something'', a bolt ''bolts several things together''). So, as a general rule, when buying a packet of "screws" nuts would not be expected to be included, but bolts are often sold with matching nuts. Part of the confusion over this is likely due to regional or dialectical differences. ''[[Machinery's Handbook]]'' describes the distinction as follows:

{{quote|A bolt is an externally threaded fastener designed for insertion through holes in assembled parts, and is normally intended to be tightened or released by torquing a nut. A screw is an externally threaded fastener capable of being inserted into holes in assembled parts, of mating with a preformed internal thread or forming its own thread, and of being tightened or released by torquing the head. An externally threaded fastener which is prevented from being turned during assembly and which can be tightened or released only by torquing a nut is a bolt. (Example: round head bolts, track bolts, plow bolts.) An externally threaded fastener that has thread form which prohibits assembly with a nut having a straight thread of multiple pitch length is a screw. (Example: wood screws, tapping screws.)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|p=1492}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This distinction is consistent with [[ASME|ASME B18.2.1]] and some dictionary definitions for ''screw''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Cambridge Dictionary of American English | publisher = Cambridge University Press | url = http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=screw*1+0&amp;dict=A | accessdate = 2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = allwords | url = http://www.allwords.com/query.php?SearchType=3&amp;Keyword=screw&amp;goquery=Find+it%21&amp;Language=ENG | accessdate = 2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''bolt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Merriam Webster Dictionary bolt | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bolt | accessdate = 2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Compact Oxford English Dictionary bolt | publisher = Oxford | url = http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/bolt_1?view=uk | accessdate = 2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary bolt | publisher = Cambridge University Press | url = http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=8680&amp;dict=CALD | accessdate = 2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of what is a screw and what is a bolt is not completely resolved with ''Machinery's Handbook'' distinction, however, because of confounding terms, the ambiguous nature of some parts of the distinction, and usage variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fastener Resource Center - Know your Bolts|url=http://www.fastenerexperts.com/bolt-guide/ |accessdate = 2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2013}} Some of these issues are discussed below:

=== Wood screws ===
Early wood screws were made by hand, with a series of files, chisels, and other cutting tools, and these can be spotted easily by noting the irregular spacing and shape of the threads, as well as file marks remaining on the head of the screw and in the area between threads. Many of these screws had a blunt end, completely lacking the sharp tapered point on nearly all modern wood screws.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wag-aic.org/Am_Wood_Screws.pdf|title=Observations on the Development of Wood Screws in North America|last=White|first=Christopher|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, lathes were used to manufacture wood screws, with the earliest patent being recorded in 1760 in England.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the 1850s [[swaging]] tools were developed to provide a more uniform and consistent thread. Screws made with these tools have rounded valleys with sharp and rough threads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanlongrifles.org/forum/index.php?topic=18831.0|title=Making 18th c wood screws|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UIxAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA12|title=Iron Age, Volume 44|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some wood screws were made with cutting dies as early as the late 1700s (possibly even before 1678 when the book content was first published in parts).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mechanic Exercises: Or the Doctrine of Handy-Works|last=Moxon|first=Joseph|publisher=|year=1703|isbn=|location=Mendham, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once screw turning machines were in common use, most commercially available wood screws were produced with this method. These cut wood screws are almost invariably tapered, and even when the tapered shank is not obvious, they can be discerned because the threads do not extend past the diameter of the shank. Such screws are best installed after drilling a pilot hole with a tapered drill bit. The majority of modern wood screws, except for those made of brass, are formed on thread rolling machines. These screws have a constant diameter, threads with a larger diameter than the shank, and are stronger because the rolling process does not cut the grain of the metal.

=== Machine screws ===
ASME standards specify a variety of "Machine Screws"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|pp=1568–1598}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in diameters ranging up to {{convert|0.75|in|mm|2|abbr=on}}.  These fasteners are often used with nuts but also often driven into [[tapped hole]]s (without nuts).  They might be considered a screw or a bolt based on the ''Machinery's Handbook'' distinction.  In practice, they tend to be mostly available in smaller sizes and the smaller sizes are referred to as screws or less ambiguously as machine screws, although some kinds of machine screw can be referred to as stove bolts.

=== Hex cap screws ===
ASME standard B18.2.1-1996 specifies Hex Cap Screws whose size range is {{convert|0.25|–|3|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} in [[diameter]]. These fasteners are very similar to hex bolts. They differ mostly in that they are manufactured to tighter tolerances than the corresponding bolts.  ''Machinery's Handbook'' refers parenthetically to these fasteners as "Finished Hex Bolts".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|p=1496}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Reasonably, these fasteners might be referred to as bolts, but based on the US government document ''Distinguishing Bolts from Screws'', the US government might classify them as screws because of the tighter tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Distinguishing Bolts from Screws page 7 |url= https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2016-Apr/icp013_3.pdf |accessdate= 2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 responding to an influx of counterfeit fasteners Congress passed PL 101-592&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/fqaregs2.cfm|title=National Institute of Standards and Technology - NIST|website=NIST|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721055941/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/fqaregs2.cfm|archivedate=2011-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Fastener Quality Act" This resulted in the rewriting of specifications by the ASME B18 committee. B18.2.1&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.asme.org/Codes/PrintBook/B1821_1996_Square_Hex_Bolts.cfm B18.2.1 - 1996 Square and Hex Bolts and Screws, Inch Series - Print-Book&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was re-written and as a result they eliminated the "Finished Hex Bolts" and renamed them the "Hex Cap Screw"—a term that had existed in common usage long before, but was now also being codified as an official name for the ASME B18 standard.

=== Lug bolts and head bolts ===
These terms refer to fasteners that are designed to be threaded into a tapped hole that is in part of the assembly and so based on the ''Machinery's Handbook'' distinction they would be screws.  Here common terms are at variance with ''Machinery's Handbook'' distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=autorepair.com Glossary - lug bolt|url=http://autorepair.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-900.htm|accessdate = 2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=autozone.com Glossary - head bolt|url=http://www.autozone.com/autozone/repairinfo/common/repairInfoMain.jsp?leftNavPage=glossary&amp;startLetter=h&amp;targetPage=glossarySelected|accessdate = 2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lag screw ===
&lt;!-- [[Lag screw]] redirects here. --&gt;
[[File:Lag screws aka lag bolts 001.png|thumb|upright|Lag screws, also called lag bolts]]

'''Lag screws''' (US) or '''coach screws''' (UK, Australia, and New Zealand) (also referred to as '''lag bolts''' or '''coach bolts''', although this is a [[misnomer]]) are large wood screws. Square-headed and hex-headed lag screws are covered by ASME B18.2.1 standards, and the head is typically an external hex. A typical lag screw can range in diameter from {{convert|1/4|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1+1/4|in|mm|2|abbr=on}}, and lengths from {{convert|1/4|to|6|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} or longer, with the coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger).

The materials are usually carbon steel substrate with a coating of zinc [[galvanization]] (for corrosion resistance). The zinc coating may be bright (electroplated), yellow (electroplated), or dull gray [[hot-dip galvanizing|hot-dip galvanized]]. Lag screws are used to lag together lumber framing, to lag machinery feet to wood floors, and for other heavy carpentry applications.  The attributive modifier ''lag'' came from an early principal use of such fasteners: the fastening of [[wikt:lag#Noun|lag]]s such as barrel staves and other similar parts.&lt;ref name="MWCD"&gt;{{Citation |title=Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These fasteners are "screws" according to the ''Machinery's Handbook'' criteria, and the obsolescent term "lag bolt" has been replaced by "lag screw" in the ''Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|p=1497}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, to many tradesmen, they are "bolts", because they are large, with hex or square heads.

=== United States government standards ===
The [[federal government of the United States]] made an effort to formalize the difference between a bolt and a screw, because different [[tariff]]s apply to each.&lt;ref name="CBP.gov_bolts-vs-screws"&gt;{{Citation |author=U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBP) |authorlink=U.S. Customs and Border Protection  |date=July 2012 |title=What Every Member of the Trade Community Should Know About: Distinguishing Bolts from Screws |series=An Informed Compliance Publication |edition=2011-02 |publisher=CBP.gov |location=Washington, D.C., USA |pages= |url=http://www.cbp.gov/document/publications/distinguishing-bolts-screws |doi= |id= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document seems to have no significant effect on common usage and does not eliminate the ambiguous nature of the distinction between screws and bolts for some threaded fasteners. The document also reflects (although it probably did not originate) significant confusion of terminology usage that differs between the legal/statutory/regulatory community and the fastener industry. The legal/statutory/regulatory wording uses the terms "coarse" and "fine" to refer to the tightness of the [[engineering tolerance|tolerance]] range, referring basically to "high-quality" or "low-quality", but this is a poor choice of terms, because those terms in the fastener industry have a different meaning (referring to [[Screw thread#Coarse versus fine|the steepness of the helix's lead]]).

=== Historical issue ===
Old [[United States Standard|USS]] and [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] standards defined cap screws as fasteners with shanks that were threaded to the head and bolts as fasteners with shanks that were partially unthreaded.&lt;ref name="dyke"&gt;{{Citation|title=Dyke's Automobile and Gasoline Engine Encyclopedia page 701|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WqI7AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA702&amp;lpg=RA1-PA702&amp;dq=sae+uss+screw+standard|accessdate = 2009-01-13|postscript=. | year=1919 | publisher=A.L. Dyke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship of this rule to the idea that a bolt by definition takes a nut is clear (because the unthreaded section of the shank, which is called the ''grip'', was expected to pass through the substrate without threading into it). This is now an obsolete distinction, although large bolts still often have unthreaded sections of shank.

Although there is no reason to consider this definition obsolete, because it is far from clear that "a bolt by definition takes a nut" . Using a coach "bolt" as an example (and it has been a 'bolt' for a very long time). It was not originally intended to receive a nut, but did have a shank. Its purpose was not to pass through the entire substrate but only one piece of it, while the threaded portion bit into the other in order to draw, and clamp the materials together. The 'carriage' bolt was derived from this and was employed more to speed up manufacturing than achieve a different function. The carriage bolt passes through both pieces of materials and employs a nut to provide the clamping force. Both are still, however, bolts.

=== Controlled vocabulary versus natural language ===
The distinctions above are enforced in the [[controlled vocabulary]] of [[standards organization]]s. Nevertheless, there are sometimes differences between the controlled vocabulary and the [[natural language]] use of the words by machinists, auto mechanics and others. These differences reflect linguistic evolution shaped by the [[History of technology|changing of technology over centuries]]. The words ''bolt'' and ''screw'' have both existed since before today's modern mix of fastener types existed, and the natural usage of those words has evolved [[retronym]]ously in response to the technological change. (That is, the use of words as names for objects changes as the objects change.) Non-threaded fasteners predominated until the advent of practical, inexpensive screw-cutting in the early 19th century. The basic meaning of the word ''screw'' has long involved the idea of a helical screw thread, but the Archimedes screw and the screw [[gimlet (tool)|gimlet]] (like a corkscrew) preceded the fastener.

The word ''bolt'' is also a very old word, and it was used for centuries to refer to metal rods that passed through the substrate to be fastened on the other side, often via nonthreaded means (clinching, forge welding, pinning, wedging, etc.). The connection of this sense to the sense of a door bolt or the [[crossbow]] bolt is apparent. In the 19th century, bolts fastened via screw threads were often called ''screw bolts'' in contradistinction to [[Clinker (boat building)#Fastening the centre-line structure|''clench bolts'']].

In common usage, the distinction (not rigorous) is often that screws are smaller than bolts, and that screws are generally tapered while bolts are not. For example, [[cylinder head]] bolts are called "bolts" (at least in North American usage) despite the fact that by some definitions they ought to be called "screws". Their size and their similarity to a bolt that would take a nut seem linguistically to overrule any other factors in this [[natural language|natural]] word choice proclivity.

====Other distinctions====
Bolts have been defined as headed fasteners having external threads that meet an exacting, uniform bolt thread specification (such as [[ISO metric screw thread]] M, MJ, [[Unified Thread Standard]] UN, UNR, and UNJ) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut. Screws are then defined as headed, externally threaded fasteners that do not meet the above definition of bolts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}&lt;!-- See the talk page. --&gt; These definitions of screw and bolt eliminate the ambiguity of the ''Machinery's handbook'' distinction.  And it is for that reason, perhaps, that some people favor them.  However, they are neither compliant with common usage of the two words nor are they compliant with formal specifications.

A possible distinction is that a screw is designed to cut its own thread; it has no need for access from or exposure to the opposite side of the component being fastened to.  This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws, with either round or hex heads, for roof cladding, self-drilling and self-tapping screws for various metal fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc.
On the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.

==Types of screws and bolts==
Threaded fasteners either have a tapered shank or a non-tapered shank. Fasteners with tapered shanks are designed to either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in. Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.

Currently, it most narrowly refers to a style of head (see the gallery below). More broadly, and more commonly, it refers to the group of screws: shoulder screws, hex heads, counter-sunk heads, button heads, and fillister heads. In the United States, cap screws are defined by ASME B18.6.2 and ASME B18.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oberg|2000|pp=1599–1605}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Samuel | first = Andrew | title = Introduction to Engineering Design | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann | location = Oxford | year = 1999 | page = 213 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xxuyvQR34O4C&amp;pg=PA213 | isbn = 0-7506-4282-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the term ''cap screw'', in general, referred to screws that were supposed to be used in applications where a nut was not used; however, the characteristics that differentiate it from a bolt vary over time. In 1910, Anthony defined it as screw with a hex head that was thicker than a bolt head, but the distance across the flats was less than a bolt's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Anthony | first = Gardner Chase | title = Machine Drawing | page = 16 | publisher = D.

A socket cap screw, also known as a ''socket head capscrew'', ''socket screw'', or ''Allen bolt'', is a type of cap screw with a cylindrical head and hexagonal drive hole.  The term ''socket head capscrew'' typically refers to a type of threaded fastener whose head diameter is [[Real versus nominal value|nominally]] 1.5 times that of the screw shank ([[major diameter|major]]) diameter, with a head height equal to the shank diameter (1960 series design). [[forging|Forged]] [[heat treat|heat-treated]] [[alloy]] examples are high strength fasteners intended for the most demanding mechanical applications, with special alloy formulations available that are capable of maintaining strength at temperatures in excess of 1000 degrees F (587 degrees C).

In addition to the 1960 series design, other head designs include low head, button head and flat head, the latter designed to be seated into [[countersink|countersunk]] holes.  A [[hex key]] (sometimes referred to as an ''Allen wrench'' or ''Allen key'') or ''[[hex driver]]'' is required to tighten or loosen a socket screw. Socket head capscrews are commonly used in assemblies that do not provide sufficient clearance for a conventional wrench or [[socket wrench|socket]].

| [[File:Carriage bolts.jpg|50px]] || carriage bolt || cup head bolt, coach bolt || A carriage bolt, also known as a coach bolt, has a domed or countersunk head, and the shank is topped by a short square section under the head. The square section grips into the part being fixed (typically wood), preventing the bolt from turning when the nut is tightened. Carriage bolts are used to provide a smooth finish on automobile metal bumper exteriors, the square section aligning with a square hole in the bumper to provide anti-rotation. A rib neck carriage bolt has several longitudinal ribs instead of the square section, to grip into a metal part being fixed.

|-
| || shoulder bolt&lt;br /&gt;shoulder screw || stripper bolt || A shoulder screw differs from machine screws in that the shank is held to a precise diameter, known as the ''shoulder'', and the threaded portion is smaller in diameter than the shoulder. Shoulder screw specifications call out the shoulder diameter, shoulder length, and threaded diameter; the threaded length is fixed, based on the threaded diameter, and usually quite short. Shoulder screws can be manufactured in many materials such as [[alloy]] [[heat treat|heat-treated]] [[steel]] for maximum strength and wear resistance and stainless steel for its corrosion-resistance and non-magnetic properties. Common applications for shoulder screws include rotating [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism joints]], [[linkage (mechanical)|linkage pivots]], and guides for the [[stripper plate]] of a [[die (manufacturing)|metal forming die]] set.  In the latter application, the term stripper bolt is often substituted. Stainless steel shoulder screws are used with linear motion devices such as bearings, as guides and as pivots in electronic and other critical mechanical applications.

|-
| || tension control bolt || || A tension control bolt (TC bolt) is a heavy duty bolt used in steel frame construction. The head is usually domed and is not designed to be driven. The end of the shank has a spline on it which is engaged by a special power wrench which prevents the bolt from turning while the nut is tightened. When the appropriate torque is reached the spline shears off.
|-
| || thread rolling screws ||  || These have a lobed (usually triangular) cross-section. They form threads in a pre-existing hole in the mating workpiece by pushing the material outward during installation. In some cases the properly prepared hole in sheetmetal uses an extruded hole. The extrusion forms a lead-in and extra thread length for improved retention. Thread rolling screws are often used where loose chips formed by a thread cutting operation cannot be tolerated.

===Fasteners with built in washers===
A fastener with a built in [[Washer (hardware)|washer]] is called a SEM or SEMS, short for pre-as'''SEM'''bled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All About Screws|url=http://www.elexp.com/tips/AllAboutScrews.pdf|publisher=Curious Inventor|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www.boltscience.com/pages/glossary.htm#s|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It could be fitted on either a tapered or non-tapered shank.

===Other threaded fasteners===

==== Superbolt, or multi-jackbolt tensioner ====
A superbolt, or [[multi-jackbolt tensioner]] is an alternative type of fastener that retrofits or replaces existing nuts, bolts, or studs. Tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual jackbolts, which are threaded through the body of the nut and push against a hardened washer.  Because of this, the amount of torque required to achieve a given preload is reduced.  Installation and removal of any size tensioner is achieved with hand tools, which can be advantageous when dealing with large diameter bolting applications.

====Bone screws====
{{Main article|internal fixation}}
The field of screws and other hardware for [[internal fixation]] within the body is huge and diverse. Like [[prosthesis|prosthetics]], it integrates the industrial and medicosurgical fields, causing manufacturing technologies (such as [[machining]], [[CAD/CAM]], and [[3D printing]]) to intersect with the art and science of medicine. Like aerospace and nuclear power, this field involves some of the highest technology for fasteners, as well as some of the highest prices, for the simple reason that performance, longevity, and quality have to be excellent in such applications. Bone screws tend to be made of stainless steel or titanium, and they often have high-end features such as conical threads, multistart threads, cannulation (hollow core), and proprietary [[list of screw drives|screw drive]] types (some not seen outside of these applications).

===List of abbreviations for types of screws===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
These abbreviations have [[jargon]] currency among fastener specialists (who, working with many screw types all day long, have need to abbreviate repetitive mentions). The smaller basic ones can be built up into the longer ones; for example, if you know that "FH" means "flat head", then you may be able to parse the rest of a longer abbreviation containing "FH".

These abbreviations are not universally standardized across corporations; each corporation can coin their own. The more obscure ones may not be listed here.

The extra spacing between linked terms below helps the reader to see the correct parsing at a glance.

==Materials==
Screws and bolts are usually made of [[steel]]. 
Where great resistance to weather or corrosion is required, like in very small screws or medical implants, materials such as [[stainless steel]], [[brass]], [[titanium]], [[bronze]], silicon bronze or monel may be used.

[[Galvanic corrosion]] of dissimilar metals can be prevented (using [[aluminium|aluminum]] screws for double-glazing tracks for example) by a careful choice of material. 
Some types of plastic, such as [[nylon]] or [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE), can be threaded and used for fastenings requiring moderate strength and great resistance to corrosion or for the purpose of electrical [[Electrical insulation|insulation]].

Often a surface coating is used to protect the fastener from corrosion (e.g. bright zinc plating for steel screws), to impart a decorative finish (e.g. [[japanning]]) or otherwise alter the surface properties of the base material.

Selection criteria of the screw materials include: size, required strength, resistance to corrosion, joint material, cost and temperature.

==Bolted joints==
[[File:Rustybolt th.jpg|thumb|right|Rusty hexagonal bolt heads]]
{{Main article|Bolted joint}}

The [[American Institute of Steel Construction]] ([[AISC]]) 13th Edition Steel Design Manual section 16.1 chapter J-3 specifies the requirements for bolted structural connections. Structural bolts replaced rivets due to the decreasing cost and increasing strength of structural bolts in the 20th century. Connections are formed with two types of joints: slip-critical connections and bearing connections. In slip-critical connections, movement of the connected parts is a serviceability condition and bolts are tightened to a minimum required pretension. Slip is prevented through friction of the "faying" surface, that is the plane of shear for the bolt and where two members make contact. Because friction is proportional to the normal force, connections must be sized with bolts numerous and large enough to provide the required load capacity. However, this greatly decreases the shear capacity of each bolt in the connection. The second (and more common type) of connection is a bearing connection. In this type of connection, the bolts carry the load through shear and are only tightened to a "snug-fit". These connections require fewer bolts than slip-critical connections and therefore are a less expensive alternative. Slip-critical connections are more common on flange plates for beam and column splices and moment critical connections. Bearing type connections are used in lightweight structures and in member connections where slip is not important and prevention of structural failure is the design constraint. Common bearing type connections include: shear tabs, beam supports, gusset plates in trusses.

==Mechanical classifications==&lt;!-- [[Property class]] &amp; [[Grade (fasteners)]] redirect here --&gt;
The numbers stamped on the head of the bolt are referred to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] strength rating (called ''property class'') stamped on the head. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the [[ultimate tensile strength]] in [[megapascal|MPa]] divided by 100. The number after the point is the multiplier ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa, and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8(500) = 400 MPa.

Ultimate tensile strength is the tensile stress at which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% [[yield strength#Definition|offset strain]]. Proof strength is the usable strength of the fastener. Tension testing of a bolt up to the proof load should not cause permanent set of the bolt and should be conducted on actual fasteners rather than calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brenner|first1=Harry S.|editor1-last=Parmley|editor1-first=Robert O.|title=Standard Handbook of Fastening and Joining|date=1977|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0-07-048511-9|page=Chapter 1 page 10|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a bolt is tensioned beyond the proof load, it may behave in plastic manner due to yielding in the threads and the tension preload may be lost due to the permanent plastic deformations. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener is said to be operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region of the bolt material. If a bolt is loaded in tension beyond its proof strength, the yielding at the net root section of the bolt will continue until the entire section is begins to yield and it has exceeded its yield strength. If tension increases, the bolt fractures at its ultimate strength.

Mild steel bolts have property class 4.6, with is 400 MPa ultimate strength and 0.6*400=240 MPa yield strength. High-strength steel bolts have property class 8.8, which is 800 MPa ultimate strength and 0.8*800=640 MPa yield strength or above.

The same type of screw or bolt can be made in many different grades of material. For critical high-tensile-strength applications, low-grade bolts may fail, resulting in damage or injury. On SAE-standard bolts, a distinctive pattern of marking is impressed on the heads to allow inspection and validation of the strength of the bolt.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://blog.chiltondiy.com/2013/12/how-to-recognize-metric-and-sae-bolts-2/ How to Recognize Metric and SAE Bolts]", Chilton DIY, Retrieved April 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, low-cost [[counterfeit]] fasteners may be found with actual strength far less than indicated by the markings. Such inferior fasteners are a danger to life and property when used in aircraft, automobiles, heavy trucks, and similar critical applications.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://standards.sae.org/wip/as6496/ Fraudulent/Counterfeit Electronic Parts]", SAE International, Retrieved April 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inch ===
There are many standards governing the material and mechanical properties of imperial sized externally threaded fasteners.  Some of the most common consensus standards for grades produced from carbon steels are ASTM A193, ASTM A307, ASTM A354, ASTM F3125, and SAE J429.  Some of the most common consensus standards for grades produced from corrosion resistant steels are ASTM F593 &amp; ASTM A193.

Some varieties of screw are manufactured with a break-away head, which snaps off when adequate torque is applied. This prevents tampering and also provides an easily inspectable joint to guarantee proper assembly. An example of this is the shear bolts used on vehicle [[steering column]]s, to secure the [[ignition switch]].

== {{visible anchor|Types of screw drive}}s ==
{{Screw drives|screw}}
{{Main article|List of screw drives}}

Modern screws employ a wide variety of drive designs, each requiring a different kind of tool to drive in or extract them. The most common screw drives are the slotted and Phillips in the US; hex, Robertson, and Torx are also common in some applications, and Pozidriv has almost completely replaced Phillips in Europe. Some types of drive are intended for automatic assembly in mass-production of such items as automobiles. More exotic screw drive types may be used in situations where tampering is undesirable, such as in electronic appliances that should not be serviced by the home repair person.

==Tools==
[[File:Screw-into-wood.ogg|left|180px|thumb|An electric driver screws a self-tapping phillips head screw into wood]]

The hand tool used to drive in most screws is called a ''[[screwdriver]]''. A power tool that does the same job is a ''power screwdriver''; [[power drill]]s may also be used with screw-driving attachments. Where the holding power of the screwed joint is critical, torque-measuring and ''torque-limiting screwdrivers'' are used to ensure sufficient but not excessive force is developed by the screw. The hand tool for driving hex head threaded fasteners is a ''spanner'' (UK usage) or ''wrench'' (US usage), while a ''nut setter'' is used with a power screw driver.

==Thread standards==
{{Contradicts other|date=February 2010|1=Screw thread}}
{{Main article|Screw thread}}

There are many systems for specifying the dimensions of screws, but in much of the world the [[ISO metric screw thread]] preferred series has displaced the many older systems. Other relatively common systems include the [[British Standard Whitworth]], [[British Association screw threads|BA system (British Association)]], and the [[Unified Thread Standard]].

===ISO metric screw thread===
{{Main article|ISO metric screw thread}}

The basic principles of the ISO metric screw thread are defined in [[international standard]] [[ISO 68-1]] and preferred combinations of diameter and pitch are listed in ISO 261. The smaller subset of diameter and pitch combinations commonly used in screws, nuts and bolts is given in [[ISO 262]]. The most commonly used pitch value for each diameter is the ''coarse pitch''. For some diameters, one or two additional ''fine pitch'' variants are also specified, for special applications such as threads in thin-walled pipes. ISO metric screw threads are designated by the letter '''M''' followed by the major diameter of the thread in millimeters (e.g. ''M8''). If the thread does not use the normal ''coarse pitch'' (e.g. 1.25&amp;nbsp;mm in the case of M8), then the pitch in millimeters is also appended with a [[multiplication sign]] (e.g. "M8×1" if the screw thread has an outer diameter of 8&amp;nbsp;mm and advances by 1&amp;nbsp;mm per 360° rotation).

The nominal diameter of a metric screw is the outer diameter of the thread. The tapped hole (or nut) into which the screw fits, has an internal diameter which is the size of the screw minus the pitch of the thread. Thus, an M6 screw, which has a pitch of 1&amp;nbsp;mm, is made by threading a 6&amp;nbsp;mm shank, and the nut or threaded hole is made by tapping threads into a hole of 5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter (6&amp;nbsp;mm - 1&amp;nbsp;mm).

Metric [[hexagon]] bolts, screws and nuts are specified, for example, in [[British Standard]] BS&amp;nbsp;4190 (general purpose screws) and BS&amp;nbsp;3692 (precision screws). The following table lists the relationship given in these standards between the thread size and the maximal width across the hexagonal flats (wrench size):

{| class=wikitable style="text-align:right"
! ISO metric thread
|M1.6||M2||M2.5||M3||M4||M5||M6||M8||M10||M12||M16||M20||M24||M30||M36||M42||M48||M56||M64
|-

|}

In addition, the following non-preferred intermediate sizes are specified:

{| class=wikitable style="text-align:right"
! ISO metric thread
|M7||M14||M18||M22||M27||M33||M39||M45||M52||M60||M68
|-
! Wrench size (mm)
|11||22||27||32||41||50||60||70||80||90||100
|}

===Whitworth===
{{Main article|British Standard Whitworth}}

The first person to create a standard (in about 1841) was the [[England|English]] [[engineer]] Sir [[Joseph Whitworth]]. Whitworth screw sizes are still used, both for repairing old machinery and where a coarser thread than the metric fastener thread is required. Whitworth became ''British Standard Whitworth'', abbreviated to BSW (BS 84:1956) and the ''British Standard Fine'' (BSF) thread was introduced in 1908 because the Whitworth thread was too coarse for some applications. The [[thread angle]] was 55°, and the depth and pitch varied with the diameter of the thread (i.e., the bigger the bolt, the coarser the thread). Spanners for Whitworth bolts are marked with the size of the bolt, not the distance across the flats of the screw head.

The most common use of a Whitworth pitch nowadays is in all UK [[scaffolding]]. Additionally, the standard photographic [[tripod (photography)|tripod]] thread, which for small cameras is 1/4" Whitworth (20 tpi) and for medium/large format cameras is 3/8" Whitworth (16 tpi). It is also used for microphone stands and their appropriate clips, again in both sizes, along with "thread adapters" to allow the smaller size to attach to items requiring the larger thread. Note that while 1/4" [[Unified National Coarse|UNC]] bolts fit 1/4" BSW camera tripod bushes, [[yield strength]] is reduced by the different thread angles of 60° and 55° respectively.

===British Association screw thread===
{{Main article|British Association screw threads}}

British Association (BA) screw threads, named after the British Association for Advancement of Science, were devised in 1884 and standardised in 1903. Screws were described as "2BA", "4BA" etc., the odd numbers being rarely used, except in equipment made prior to the 1970s for telephone exchanges in the UK. This equipment made extensive use of odd-numbered BA screws, in order—it may be suspected—to reduce theft. BA threads are specified by British Standard BS 93:1951 "Specification for British Association (B.A.) screw threads with tolerances for sizes 0 B.A. to 16 B.A."

While not related to ISO metric screws, the sizes were actually defined in metric terms, a 0BA thread having a 6&amp;nbsp;mm diameter and 1&amp;nbsp;mm pitch. Other threads in the BA series are related to 0BA in a geometric series with the common factors 0.9 and 1.2. For example, a 4BA thread has pitch &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p=0.9^4&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;mm (0.65mm) and diameter &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 6p^{1.2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;mm (3.62mm). Although 0BA has the same diameter and pitch as ISO M6, the threads have different forms and are not compatible.

BA threads are still common in some niche applications. Certain types of fine machinery, such as moving-coil meters and clocks, tend to have BA threads wherever they are manufactured. BA sizes were also used extensively in aircraft, especially those manufactured in the United Kingdom. BA sizing is still used in railway signalling, mainly for the termination of electrical equipment and cabling.

BA threads are extensively used in Model Engineering where the smaller hex head sizes make scale fastenings easier to represent. As a result, many UK Model Engineering suppliers still carry stocks of BA fasteners up to typically 8BA and 10BA. 5BA is also commonly used as it can be threaded onto 1/8 rod.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.threadcheck.com/technical-documents/thread-systems.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unified Thread Standard===
{{Main article|Unified Thread Standard}}

The Unified Thread Standard (UTS) is most commonly used in the [[United States]], but is also extensively used in [[Canada]] and occasionally in other countries. The size of a UTS screw is described using the following format: '''X-Y''', where '''X''' is the nominal size (the hole or slot size in standard manufacturing practice through which the shank of the screw can easily be pushed) and '''Y''' is the [[threads per inch]] (TPI). For sizes {{frac|1|4}} inch and larger the size is given as a fraction; for sizes less than this an [[integer]] is used, ranging from 0 to 16.  The integer sizes can be converted to the actual diameter by using the formula 0.060 + 0.013 &amp;times; number.  For example, a #4 screw is 0.060 + 0.013 &amp;times; 4 = 0.112&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter.  There are also screw sizes smaller than "0" (zero or ought). The sizes are 00, 000, 0000 which are usually referred to as two ought, three ought, and four ought. Most eyeglasses have the bows screwed to the frame with 00-72 (pronounced double ought – seventy two) size screws. To calculate the major diameter of "ought" size screws count the number of 0's and multiply this number by .013 and subtract from .060. For example, the major diameter of a 000-72 screw thread is .060 – (3 x .013) = .060-.039 = .021 inches. For most size screws there are multiple TPI available, with the most common being designated a Unified Coarse Thread (UNC or UN) and Unified Fine Thread (UNF or UF). Note: In countries other than the United States and Canada, the ISO Metric Screw Thread System is primarily used today. Unlike most other countries the United States and Canada still use the Unified (Inch) Thread System. However, both are moving over to the ISO Metric System. It is estimated that approximately 60% of screw threads in use in the United States are still inch based.[67]

==Manufacture==
[[File:Bolt Forming.svg|thumb|300px]]
[[File:Screw (bolt) 13-n.PNG|thumb]]
{{see also|Threading (manufacturing)}}

There are three steps in manufacturing a screw: ''heading'', ''thread rolling'', and ''coating''. Screws are normally made from [[wire]], which is supplied in large coils, or round [[bar stock]] for larger screws. The wire or rod is then cut to the proper length for the type of screw being made; this workpiece is known as a ''blank''. It is then [[heading (metalworking)|cold headed]], which is a [[cold working]] process. Heading produces the ''head'' of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a ''slotting machine''. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.
&lt;!--
The process works as follows: the bar stock is fed into a machine, called a "former". The bar stock is stopped, and then gripped by a gripping [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]. The gripping die is shaped in such a way that it forms a carriage along the neck of the stock when its full gripping force is applied. An indented [[Punch (engineering)|punch]], the shape of a rounded head, will then proceed to move forward, colliding with the stock and causing the metal to flow at right angles to the ram force provided by the punch, increasing the diameter of the workpiece, and reducing its overall length, thus forming a "rounded" head. The work billet is then [[Shearing (manufacturing)|shear]]ed to the desired length. ---A ref needs to be found for all this, because the first paragraph states that blanks are made then formed and the second states that the shank and heading occur first then its cut to length. Wizard191--&gt;

The blanks are then polished{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;!-- It seems more logical that the author meant "clean" and/or "degrease" because polishing is expensive and seemingly unnecessary. --&gt; again prior to threading. The threads are usually produced via [[thread rolling]], however some are [[thread cutting|cut]]. The workpiece is then [[tumble finishing|tumble finished]] with wood and leather media to do final cleaning and polishing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} For most screws, a coating, such as [[electroplating]] with zinc ([[galvanizing]]) or applying [[black oxide]], is applied to prevent corrosion.

==History==
[[File:Screw making machine, 1871.png|thumb|right|A [[Lathe (metal)|lathe]] of 1871, equipped with [[leadscrew]] and change gears for single-point screw-cutting.]]
[[File:Brownie-4slide.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Brown &amp; Sharpe]] single-[[Spindle (tool)|spindle]] screw machine.]]

While a recent hypothesis attributes the [[Archimedes' screw]] to [[Sennacherib]], King of [[Assyria]], archaeological finds and pictorial evidence only appear in the [[Hellenistic period]] and the standard view holds the device to be a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] invention, most probably by the 3rd century BC polymath [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanie Dalley]] and [[John Peter Oleson]] (January 2003). "Sennacherib, Archimedes, and the Water Screw: The Context of Invention in the Ancient World", ''Technology and Culture'' '''44''' (1).&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=December 2010}}  Though resembling a screw, this is not a screw in the usual sense of the word.

Earlier, the screw had been described by the [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Archytas|Archytas of Tarentum]] (428–350 BC). By the 1st century BC, wooden screws were commonly used throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] world in [[screw press]]es for pressing [[olive oil]] from olives and pressing juice from grapes in [[winemaking]]. Metal screws used as fasteners were rare in Europe before the 15th century, if known at all.&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;{{Citation | title = Am_Wood_Screws | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/wag/Am_Wood_Screws.pdf | accessdate = 2010-04-30 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rybczynski has shown&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000pp34,66,90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=34, 66, 90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that handheld [[screwdriver]]s (formerly called "turnscrews" in English, in more direct parallel to their original French name, ''tournevis''&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000pp32-36,44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=32–36, 44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) have existed since medieval times (the 1580s at the latest), although they probably did not become truly widespread until after 1800, once threaded fasteners had become commodified, as detailed below.{{peacock term|date=June 2016}}

There were many forms of fastening in use before threaded fasteners became widespread. They tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining, and they involved concepts such as [[dowel]]s and pins, wedging, [[mortise and tenon|mortises and tenons]], [[dovetail joint|dovetails]], [[nail (fastener)|nailing]] (with or without clenching the nail ends), [[forge welding]], and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber, using many kinds of [[knot]]s. Prior to the mid-19th century, [[Split pin|cotter pins]] or [[clinker (boat building)#Fastening the centre-line structure|pin bolts]], and "clinch bolts" (now called [[Rivet#Types|rivet]]s), were used in shipbuilding. [[Adhesive|Glues]] also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.

The metal screw did not become a common fastener until [[machine tool]]s for their [[mass production]] were developed toward the end of the 18th century. This development blossomed in the 1760s and 1770s&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000pp75-99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=75–99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; along two separate paths that soon [[technological convergence|converged]]:&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000p99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the mass production of ''wood'' screws (meaning screws made of metal to be used in wood) in a specialized, single-purpose, high-volume-production machine tool; and the low-count, [[toolroom]]-style production of ''machine'' screws (V-thread) with easy selection among various pitches (whatever the machinist happened to need on any given day).

The first path was pioneered by brothers Job and William Wyatt of [[Staffordshire]], UK,&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000p75"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who patented in 1760 a machine that we might today best call a [[Automatic lathe#Screw machine|screw machine]] of an early and prescient sort. It made use of a leadscrew to guide the cutter to produce the desired pitch,&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000p75"/&gt; and the slot was cut with a rotary file while the main spindle held still (presaging live tools on lathes 250 years later). Not until 1776 did the Wyatt brothers have a wood-screw factory up and running.&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000p75"/&gt; Their enterprise failed, but new owners soon made it prosper, and in the 1780s they were producing 16,000 screws a day with only 30 employees&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000p76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—the kind of industrial productivity and output volume that would later be characteristic of modern industry but was revolutionary at the time.

Meanwhile, English instrument maker [[Jesse Ramsden]] (1735–1800) was working on the [[tool and die maker|toolmaking]] and [[:Category:Scientific instrument makers|instrument-making]] end of the screw-cutting problem, and in 1777 he  invented the first satisfactory [[screw-cutting lathe]].&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000pp97-99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=97–99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The British engineer [[Henry Maudslay]] (1771–1831) gained fame by popularizing such lathes with his screw-cutting lathes of 1797 and 1800, containing the trifecta of leadscrew, slide rest, and change-gear gear train, all in the right proportions for industrial machining. In a sense he unified the paths of the Wyatts and Ramsden and did for machine screws what had already been done for wood screws, i.e., significant easing of production spurring [[commodification]]. His firm would remain a leader in machine tools for decades afterward. A misquoting of [[James Nasmyth]] popularized the notion that Maudslay had ''invented'' the slide rest, but this was incorrect; however, his lathes helped to popularize it.

These developments of the 1760–1800 era, with the Wyatts and Maudslay being arguably the most important drivers, caused great increase in the use of threaded fasteners. [[Screw thread#History of standardization|Standardization of threadforms]] began almost immediately, but it was not quickly completed; it has been an evolving process ever since. Further improvements to the mass production of screws continued to push [[unit price]]s lower and lower for decades to come, throughout the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000pp76-78"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=76–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American development of the [[turret lathe]] (1840s) and of automatic [[automatic lathe#Screw machine|screw machines]]  derived from it (1870s) drastically reduced the unit cost of threaded fasteners by increasingly automating the machine tool control. This [[demand curve|cost reduction spurred ever greater use]] of screws.

Throughout the 19th century, the most commonly used forms of screw head (that is, [[List of screw drives|drive types]]) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to [[Machining|machine]] and  served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s,&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000pp79-81"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=79–81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian [[P. L. Robertson]] was the first to make the internal-wrenching square socket drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal [[cold forming]] as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways.&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000pp79-81"/&gt; Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive ([[hex key|hex socket]]) shortly followed in 1911.&lt;ref name="US_patent_161390"&gt;{{US patent|161,390}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hallowell1951pp51-59"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallowell|1951|pp=51–59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, the popular Phillips-head screw was invented by American [[Henry F. Phillips]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

Threadform standardization further improved in the late 1940s, when the ISO metric screw thread and the Unified Thread Standard were defined.

Precision screws, for controlling motion rather than fastening, developed around the turn of the 19th century, were one of the central technical advances, along with flat surfaces, that enabled the industrial revolution.&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000p104"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They are key components of micrometers and lathes.

'''Shaft voltage''' occurs in [[electric motor]]s and generators due to leakage, induction, or capacitive coupling with the windings of the motor. It can occur in motors powered by [[variable-frequency drive]]s, as often used in [[HVAC|heating, ventilation, air conditioning]] and [[refrigeration]] systems. DC machines may have leakage current from the armature windings that energizes the shaft.  Currents due to shaft voltage causes deterioration of motor bearings, but can be prevented with a grounding brush on the shaft, grounding of the motor frame, insulation of the bearing supports, or shielding.

Shaft voltage can be induced by non-symmetrical magnetic fields of the motor (or generator) itself. External sources of shaft voltage include other coupled machines, and electrostatic charging due to rubber belts rubbing on drive pulleys.&lt;ref name=HEM04&gt;Hamid A. Toliyat, G. B. Kliman ''Handbook of electric motors'' CRC Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0824741056}},pp.672-688&lt;/ref&gt;

Every rotor has some degree of [[capacitive coupling]] to the motor's electrical windings,&lt;ref&gt;"Turning The Tables On Shaft Voltage And Bearing Currents", David W. Schlegel, Russel J. Kerkman, and Gary L. Skibinski, ''Electrical Construction &amp; Maintenance (EC&amp;M) Magazine'', June 1998, [http://ecmweb.com/mag/electric_turning_tables_shaft/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"How to Select a VFD", John Yoon (PE, LEED AP), ''Consulting-Specifying Engineer'', November 2010, [https://archive.is/20120715200545/http://m.csemag.com/index.php?id=2832&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=39736&amp;cHash=8d7ffd1736]&lt;/ref&gt; but the effective [[Parasitic capacitance|inline capacitor]] acts as a [[RLC_circuit#Filters|high-pass filter]], so the coupling is often weak at 50–60&amp;nbsp;Hz line frequency.  But many Variable Frequency Drives (VFD) induce significant voltage onto the shaft of the driven motor, because of the kilohertz switching of the [[insulated gate bipolar transistor]]s (IGBTs), which produce the [[pulse width modulation]] used to control the [[AC motor|motor]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.est-aegis.com/datasheets/ASHRAE_SL-08-025_Shaft_Grounding_A_Solution_to_Motor_Bearing_Currents.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of high frequency ground currents can cause sparks, arcing and electrical shocks and can damage bearings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.controleng.com/index.php?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counter-measures==
Techniques used to minimise this problem include: insulation, alternate discharge paths, [[Faraday shield]],&lt;ref name="greenheck.com"&gt;http://www.greenheck.com/library/articles/58&lt;/ref&gt; insulated bearings, ceramic [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s, grounding brush &lt;ref name="greenheck.com"/&gt; and shaft grounding ring.

===Faraday shield===
{{main|Faraday cage}}
An electrostatic shielded induction motor (ESIM) is one approach to the shaft-voltage problem, as the insulation reduces voltage levels below the dielectric breakdown.  This effectively stops [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] degradation and offers one solution to accelerated bearing wear caused by fluting, induced by pulsewidth modulated (PWM) inverters.&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=649969&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grounding brush===
Grounding the shaft by installing a grounding brush device on either the non-drive end or drive end of a VFD electric motor provides an alternate low-impedance path from the motor shaft to the motor case. This method channels the current away from the bearings. It significantly reduces shaft voltage and therefore bearing current by not allowing voltage to build up on the rotor.  Low maintenance grounding brushes have been field tested and proven to run for as long as 10 years at 1800rpm while maintaining the necessary target voltage that prevents electrical bearing damage for the entire life of the brush.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.shaftgroundingsystems.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Technical_Document_2018_Updated.230145458.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shaft grounding ring===
A shaft grounding ring (SGR) is similar to a grounding brush, except that this brush makes use of conductive micro fibers, creating a low impedance path from the motor shaft to ground.

===Insulated bearings===
Insulated bearings eliminate the path to ground through the bearing for current to flow. However, installing insulated bearings does not eliminate the shaft voltage, which will still find the lowest impedance path to ground. This can potentially cause a problem if the path happens to be through the driven load or through some other component.

===Shielded cable===
{{main|Shielded cable}}
High frequency grounding can be significantly improved by installing shielded cable with an extremely [[Electrical impedance|low impedance]] path between the VFD and the motor. One popular cable type is continuous corrugated [[aluminum]] sheath cable.

[[File:SRR transient.webm|thumb=SRR transient(300px).gif|right|Electric field (top) and magnetic field (bottom) of an electric-SRR under resonant electrical excitation. The magnetic response arises from the symmetry of the current loops. (Click for video)]]

A '''split-ring resonator''' ('''SRR''') is an artificially produced structure common to [[metamaterial]]s. Their purpose is to produce the desired [[magnetic susceptibility]] (magnetic response) in various types of metamaterials up to 200 [[Terahertz (unit)|terahertz]]. These media create the necessary strong magnetic coupling to an applied [[electromagnetic field]], not otherwise available in conventional materials. For example, an effect such as negative [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] is produced with a periodic array of split ring resonators.&lt;ref name=balmaz/&gt;

A single cell SRR has a pair of enclosed loops with splits in them at opposite ends. The loops are made of [[nonmagnetic]] metal like [[copper]] and have a small gap between them. The loops can be concentric, or square, and gapped as needed. A [[magnetic flux]] penetrating the metal rings will [[Electromagnetic induction|induce rotating currents]] in the rings, which produce their own flux to enhance or oppose the [[surface normal|incident field]] (depending on the SRRs resonant properties). This [[EM field|field pattern]] is [[dipole|dipolar]]. The small gaps between the rings produces large [[capacitance]] values which lower the resonating [[frequency]]. Hence the dimensions of the structure are small compared to the [[resonant]] wavelength. This results in low [[diffraction|radiative losses]], and very high [[quality factor]]s.&lt;ref name=balmaz&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Split ring resonator.png|thumb|A split-ring resonator. Notice the current, denoted by the small letter "i", is in the clockwise direction.]]
Split ring resonators (SRRs) consist of a pair of [[concentric]] metallic rings, etched on a [[dielectric]] substrate, with slits etched on opposite sides. SRRs can produce an effect of being electrically smaller when responding to an oscillating [[electromagnetic field]].  These resonators have been used for the synthesis of left handed and negative refractive index media, where the necessary value of the negative effective permeability is due to the presence of the SRRs. When an array of electrically small SRRs is excited by means of a time varying [[magnetic field]], the structure behaves as an [[effective medium]] with negative effective permeability in a narrow band above SRR [[resonance]]. SRRs have also been coupled to planar [[transmission line]]s, for the synthesis of [[transmission line metamaterial]]s.&lt;ref name="NaquiDuran-Sindreu2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naqui|first1=Jordi|last2=Durán-Sindreu|first2=Miguel|last3=Martín|first3=Ferran|title=Novel Sensors Based on the Symmetry Properties of Split Ring Resonators (SRRs)|journal=Sensors|volume=11|issue=12|year=2011|pages=7545–7553|issn=1424-8220|doi=10.3390/s110807545|pmid=22164031|pmc=3231717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The split ring resonator and the [[metamaterial]] itself are composite materials. Each SRR has an individual tailored response to the electromagnetic field. However, the periodic construction of many SRR cells is such that the electromagnetic wave interacts as if these were [[effective medium approximations|homogeneous material]]s. This is similar to how light actually interacts with everyday materials; materials such as glass or lenses are made of atoms, an averaging or macroscopic effect is produced.

The SRR is designed to mimic the magnetic response of atoms, only on a much larger scale. Also, as part of periodic composite structure these are designed to have a stronger magnetic coupling than is found in nature. The larger scale allows for more control over the magnetic response, while each unit is smaller than the radiated [[electromagnetic wave]].

SRRs are much more active than [[ferromagnetic]] materials found in nature. The pronounced magnetic response in such lightweight materials demonstrates an advantage over heavier, naturally occurring materials. Each unit can be designed to have its own magnetic response. The response can be enhanced or lessened as desired. In addition, the overall effect reduces power requirements.&lt;ref name=balmaz/&gt;&lt;ref name=u-eff-01&gt;

There are a variety of split-ring resonators and [[periodic function|periodic]] structures: rod-split-rings, nested split-rings, single split rings, deformed split-rings, spiral split-rings, and extended S-structures. The variations of split ring resonators have achieved different results, including smaller and higher frequency structures. The research which involves some of these types are discussed throughout the article.&lt;ref name=EM3-PHz-range&gt;{{Cite book| last =Moser| first =H.O.| title =Electromagnetic metamaterials over the whole THz range – achievements and perspectives| journal =ELECTROMAGNETIC MATERIALS Proceedings of the Symposium R, ICMAT 2005| pages =18| date =2005-07-08| url =https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5818968921785800846&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2000| format =Free PDF download, click on link.

To date (December 2009) the capability for desired results in the [[visible spectrum]] has not been achieved. However, in 2005 it was noted that, physically, a nested circular split-ring resonator must have an inner radii of 30 to 40 [[nanometers]] for success in the mid-range of the visible spectrum.&lt;ref name=EM3-PHz-range/&gt; [[Microfabrication]] and [[nanofabrication]] techniques may utilize [[direct laser writing|direct laser beam writing]] or [[electron beam lithography]] depending on the desired resolution.&lt;ref name=EM3-PHz-range/&gt;

Looking at the image directly to the right, it can be seen that at first a single SRR looked like an object with a two square perimeters, and each perimeter with small segment removed, which results in squared "C" shapes, on fiberglass, [[printed circuit board]] material.&lt;ref name=Thz-principles/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAS2/&gt; In this type of configuration it is actually two [[concentric]] bands of [[Dielectric|non-magnetic conductor]] material.&lt;ref name=Thz-principles/&gt; There is one gap in each band placed 180° relative to each other.&lt;ref name=Thz-principles/&gt; The gap in each band gives it the distinctive "C" shape, rather than a totally circular or square shape.&lt;ref name=Thz-principles/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAS2/&gt; Then multiple cells of this double band configuration are fabricated onto circuit board material by an etching technique and lined with copper wire strip arrays are added.&lt;ref name=AAAS2/&gt; After processing, the boards are cut and assembled into an interlocking unit.&lt;ref name=AAAS2/&gt; It is constructed into a [[Non-periodic|periodic]] array with a large number of SRRs.&lt;ref name=AAAS2/&gt;

There are now a number of different configurations that use the SRR nomenclature.

===Demonstrations===
A [[periodic function|periodic]] array of SRRs was used for the first demonstration of a negative [[index of refraction]].&lt;ref name=AAAS2/&gt; For this demonstration, ''square shaped SRRs'', with the lined wire configurations, were fabricated into a periodic, arrayed, cell structure.&lt;ref name=AAAS2/&gt; This is the substance of the metamaterial.&lt;ref name=AAAS2/&gt; Then a metamaterial [[prism (optics)|prism]] was cut from this material.&lt;ref name=AAAS2/&gt; The prism experiment demonstrated a negative index of refraction for the first time in the year 2000; the paper about the demonstration was submitted to the journal [[Science (journal)|Science]] on January 8, 2001, accepted on February 22, 2001 and published on April 6, 2001.&lt;ref name=AAAS2/&gt;

Just before this prism experiment, [[Pendry]] et al. was able to demonstrate that a three-dimensional array of intersecting thin wires could be used to create negative values of ε. In a later demonstration,  a periodic array of copper split-ring resonators could produce an effective negative μ. In 2000 Smith et al. were the first to successfully combine the two arrays and produce a LHM which had negative values of ε and μ for a band of frequencies in the GHz range.&lt;ref name=AAAS2/&gt;

SRRs were first used to fabricate left-handed metamaterials for the [[microwave]] range,&lt;ref name=AAAS2/&gt; and several years later for the [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] range.&lt;ref name=Terahertz-magnetic-response&gt;{{cite journal| last = Yen|first = T.

SRRs also exhibit resonant electric response in addition to their resonant magnetic response.&lt;ref name=electric-coupling/&gt; The response, when combined with an array of identical wires is averaged over the whole composite structure which results in effective values, including the refractive index.&lt;ref name=gradient-index&gt;{{cite journal| last = Smith| first = D.

===Several types of SRR===

In research based in metamaterials, and specifically [[negative refractive index]], there are different types of split-ring resonators. Of the examples mentioned below most all of them have a gap in each ring. In other words, with a double ring structure, each ring has a gap.&lt;ref name=SRR-types/&gt;

There is the ''1-D Split-Ring Structure'' with two [[Square (geometry)|square]] rings, one inside the other. One set of cited "[[Cell (geometry)|unit cell]]" [[dimension]]s would be an outer [[Square (geometry)|square]] of 2.62&amp;nbsp;mm and an inner square of 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm. 1-D structures such as this are easier to fabricate compared with constructing a rigid 2-D structure.&lt;ref name=SRR-types/&gt;

The ''[[Symmetrical]]-Ring Structure'' is another classic example. Described by the nomenclature these are two [[rectangular]] square D type configurations, exactly the same size, lying flat, side by side, in the [[Cell (geometry)|unit cell]]. Also these are not [[concentric]]. One set of cited dimensions are 2&amp;nbsp;mm on the shorter side, and 3.12&amp;nbsp;mm on the longer side. The gaps in each ring face each other, in the unit cell.&lt;ref name=SRR-types/&gt;

The ''[[Omega]] Structure'', as the nomenclature describes, has an Ω-shaped ring structure. There are two of these, standing vertical, side by side, instead of lying flat, in the unit cell. In 2005 these were considered to be a new type of metamaterial. One set of cited dimensions are annular parameters of R = 1.4&amp;nbsp;mm and r = 1&amp;nbsp;mm, and the straight edge is 3.33&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=SRR-types/&gt;

Another new [[metamaterial]] in 2005 was a coupled “S” shaped structure. There are two vertical "S" shaped structures, side by side, in a unit cell. There is no gap as in the ring structure, however there is a space between the top and middle parts of the S and space between the middle part and bottom part of the S. Furthermore, it still has the properties of having an electric plasma frequency and a magnetic resonant frequency.&lt;ref name=SRR-types&gt;{{cite journal

==Split ring resonator research==
On May 1, 2000 conducting wires were placed symmetrically within each cell of a [[Periodic function|periodic]] split-ring resonator [[artificial dielectrics|array]] which achieved negative [[Wave propagation|propagation]] of [[electromagnetic waves]] in the [[microwave]] region. The concept was and still is used to build interacting elements smaller than the applied electromagnetic radiation. In addition, the spacing between, referred to as the [[lattice constant]], is also smaller than the applied radiation.

Additionally, the splits in the ring allow the SRR unit to achieve resonance at wavelengths much larger than the diameter of the ring. The unit is designed to generate a large capacitance, lower the resonant frequency, and concentrate the electric field. Combining units creates a design as a periodic medium. Furthermore, the multiple unit structure has strong magnetic coupling with low radiative losses.&lt;ref name=2000-05-01&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8982">A '''stannide''' can refer to an [[intermetallic]] compound containing [[tin]] combined with one or more other metals; an anion consisting solely of tin atoms or a compound containing such an anion, or, in the field of organometallic chemistry an ionic compound containing an organotin anion  (e.g.see&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Flacke | first1 = F. | last2 = Jacobs | first2 = H. | year = 1997 | title = [Li(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] [Sn(SnPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;].C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;,  Crystal structure of a stannide with trigonal pyramidal tin skeleton | url = | journal = European journal of solid state and inorganic chemistry | volume = 34 | issue = 5| pages = 495–501 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an alternative name for such  a compound is stannanide.)

==Binary alkali and alkaline earth stannides==
When tin is combined with an [[alkali]] or [[alkaline earth]] metal some of the compounds formed have ionic structures containing monatomic or polyatomic tin anions ([[Zintl ions]]), such as Sn&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; in Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;ref name = "Kauzlarich"&gt;S.M. Kauzlarich,(1994), Zintl Compounds, Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry, John Wiley &amp; sons, {{ISBN|0-471-93620-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{chem|Sn|9|4−}} in K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name = "Hoch"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoch | first1 = C. | last2 = Wendorff | first2 = M. | last3 = Röhr | first3 = C. | year = 2002 | title = Tetrapotassium nonastannide, K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; | url = | journal = Acta Crystallogr C | volume = 58 | issue = 4| pages = i45–i46 | doi = 10.1107/S0108270102002032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even with these metals not all of the compounds formed can be considered to be ionic with localised bonding, for example  Sr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, a metallic compound, contains {Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;} square pyramidal units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klem | first1 = M.

==Ternary alkali and alkaline earth stannides==
Ternary (where there is an alkali or alkaline earth metal, a transition metal as well as tin e.g. LiRh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sreeraj | first1 = P | last2 = Johrendt | first2 = D. | last3 = Müller | first3 = H. | last4 = Hoffmann | first4 = R.-D. | last5 = Wu | first5 = Zhiyun | last6 = Pöttgen | first6 = R. | year = 2005 | title = The stannide LiRh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;: Synthesis, structure, and chemical bonding | url = | journal = Zeitschrift für Naturforschung B | volume = 60 | issue = 9| pages = 933–939 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and MgRuSn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schlüter | first1 = M. | last2 = Kunst | first2 = A. | last3 = Pöttgen | first3 = R. | year = | title = The Ternary Stannides MgRuSn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Mg&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;Rh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;7−''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (''x'' = 0.98–1.55) | url = | journal = Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie | volume = 628 | issue = 12| pages = 2641–2646 | doi =  10.1002/1521-3749(200212)628:12&lt;2641::aid-zaac2641&gt;3.0.co;2-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have been investigated.

==Other metal stannides==
Binary (involving one other metal) and ternary (involving two other metals) intermetallic stannides have been investigated. [[niobium-tin|Niobium stannide]], Nb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn is perhaps the best known superconducting tin intermetallics. This is more commonly called "niobium-tin".

==Stannide ions, {{chem|Sn|''x''|''y''−}}==
Some examples of stannide Zintl ions are listed below. Some of them contain 2-centre 2-electron bonds (2c-2e), others are "electron deficient" and bonding sometimes can be described using [[polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory]] (Wade's rules) where the number of valence electrons contributed by each tin atom is considered to be 2 (the s electrons do not contribute).&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some examples of [[silicide]] and [[plumbide]] ions with similar structures, for example tetrahedral {{chem|Si|4|4−}}, the chain anion (Si&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, {{chem|Pb|4|4−}} and {{chem|Pb|9|4−}}.&lt;ref name = "Kauzlarich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7493">'''Sustainable aviation fuel''' (SAF) is the name given to advanced [[aviation biofuel]] types used in jet aircraft and certified as being [[sustainable]] by a reputable independent third-party, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB). This certification is in addition to the safety and performance certification, issued by global standards body [[ASTM International]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/SNEWS/SO_2011/enright_so11.html|title=Aviation Fuel Standard Takes Flight|work=Aviation Fuel Standard Takes Flight|publisher=ASTM|date=September–October 2011|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that all jet fuel is required to meet in order to be approved for use in regular passenger flights.

==Certification==
A SAF sustainability certification verifies that the fuel product, mainly focussing on the biomass feedstock, has met criteria focussed around long-term global environmental, social and economic "[[triple-bottom-line]]" sustainability considerations. Under many carbon emission regulation schemes, such as the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]], a certified SAF product may be granted an exemption from an associated carbon compliance liability cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/renewables/biofuels/sustainability_schemes_en.htm|title=Sustainability schemes for biofuels|work=European Commission/Energy/Renewable energy/Biofuels|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; This marginally improves the economic competitiveness of environmentally favourable SAF over traditional fossil-based jet fuel. However, in the near term there are several commercialisation and regulatory hurdles that are yet to be overcome through the collaboration of a variety of stakeholders for SAF products to meet price parity with traditional jet fuel and to enable widespread uptake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/sustainable-aviation-fuel/global/en#jump4 |title=Sustainable Aviation Fuel |publisher=Qantas |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reputable body to launch a sustainable biofuel certification system applicable to SAF was the academic European-based Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) NGO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsb.epfl.ch/files/content/sites/rsb2/files/Biofuels/Documents%20and%20Resources/11-10-07_RSB_Fact_Sheet_EN.pdf |title=RSB Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials &amp;#124; Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials |publisher=Rsb.epfl.ch |date=2013-10-17 |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This multi-stakeholder organization set a global benchmark standard on which the sustainability integrity of advanced aviation biofuel types seeking to use the claim of being a Sustainable Aviation Fuel can be judged. Leading airlines in the aviation industry and other signatories to the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG) pledge support the RSB as the preferred provider of SAF certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safug.org/information/pledge/ |accessdate=March 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425051329/http://www.safug.org/information/pledge/ |archivedate=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These airlines believe it important for any proposed aviation biofuels have independently certified [[sustainable biofuel]] long term environmental benefits compared to the status quo in order to ensure their successful uptake and [[marketability]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safug.org/ |title=Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group – SAFUG |publisher=Safug.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global impact==
As [[emissions trading schemes]] and other carbon compliance regimes are emerging globally certain biofuels are likely to be exempt, "zero rated", by governments from having an associated carbon compliance liability due to their closed-emissions-loop renewable nature if they can also prove their wider sustainability credentials. For example, in the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]] it has been proposed by SAFUG that only aviation biofuels that have been certified as sustainable by the RSB or similar bodies would be zero rated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safug.org/assets/docs/SAFUG_Brochure.pdf |title=Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group : European Section |publisher=Safug.org |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal has been accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/review_of_regulation_en.pdf |title=Revision of the EU Energy Tax Directive - technical press briefing |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SAFUG was formed by a group of interested airlines in 2008 under the auspices of [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes]] and in cooperation with support from NGOs such as [[Natural Resources Defense Council]]. Member airlines represent more than 15% of the industry, and all member CEOs have signed a pledge to work on the development and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/newairplane/environment/#/SustainableAviationBiofuel/UsersGroup |title=Environment and Biofuels &amp;#124; Boeing Commercial Airplanes |publisher=Boeing.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safug.org/safug-pledge/ |title= SAFUG Pledge; Boeing Commercial Airplanes |publisher=safug.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to SAF certification, the integrity of aviation biofuel producers and their product can be assessed by further means such as by using [[Richard Branson]]'s Carbon War Room &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbonwarroom.com/sectors/transport/aviation/operation-renewablejetfuels#mission |title=Renewable Jet Fuels |publisher=Carbon War Room |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable Jets Fuels initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://renewablejetfuels.org/ |title=Welcome |publisher=Renewable Jet Fuels |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A leading independent NGO focused on this issue is the Sustainable Sky Institute &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablesky.com |title=Sustainable Sky Institute |publisher=Sustainable Sky Institute |date= |accessdate=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38953">In relation to the [[chemical elements]], a '''symbol''' is a code for a chemical element.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This should not be confused with formula. When a number is present at the bottom right corner of the symbol of the element, only then is it said to be a formula, but if the number is not present, it is a symbol.&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[functional group]]s have their own chemical symbol, e.g. Ph for the [[phenyl group]], and Me for the [[methyl group]]. Chemical symbols for elements normally consist of one or two letters from the Latin alphabet, but can contain three when the element has a [[Systematic element name|systematic temporary name]] (as of March 2017, no discovered elements have such a name), and are written with the first letter capitalized.

Earlier chemical element symbols stem from classical [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] vocabulary. For some elements, this is because the material was known in ancient times, while for others, the name is a more recent invention. For example, "He" is the symbol for [[helium]] ([[New Latin]] name, not known in [[ancient Roman]] times), "Pb" for [[lead]] (''plumbum'' in Latin), and "Hg" for [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (''hydrargyrum'' in Greek). Some symbols come from other sources, like "W" for [[tungsten]] (''Wolfram'' in German, not known in Roman times).

[[Systematic element name|Temporary symbols]] assigned to newly or not-yet synthesized elements use 3-letter symbols based on their atomic numbers. For example, "Uno" was the temporary symbol for [[hassium]] (element 108) which had the temporary name of ''unniloctium''.

Chemical symbols may be modified by the use of prepended [[Subscript and superscript|superscripts or subscripts]] to specify a particular [[isotope]] of an atom. Additionally, appended superscripts may be used to indicate the [[ionization]] or [[oxidation state]] of an element. They are widely used in chemistry and they have been officially chosen by the [[IUPAC|International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC). There are also some historical symbols that are no longer officially used.

[[File:Atomic Symbol.jpg|thumb|This is an example of an atomic symbol. The text boxes explain where the numbers are derived from.]]
Attached subscripts or superscripts specifying a nuclide or molecule have the following meanings and positions:
* The [[nucleon]] number ([[mass number]]) is shown in the left superscript position (e.g., &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N). This number defines the specific isotope. Various letters, such as "m" and "f" may also be used here to indicate a [[nuclear isomer]] (e.g., [[Technetium-99m|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]]). Alternately, the number here can represent a specific [[quantum state|spin state]] (e.g., [[Singlet oxygen|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]). These details can be omitted if not relevant in a certain context.
* The proton number ([[atomic number]]) may be indicated in the left subscript position (e.g., &lt;sub&gt;64&lt;/sub&gt;Gd). The atomic number is redundant to the chemical element, but is sometimes used to emphasize the change of numbers of nucleons in a nuclear reaction.
* If necessary, a state of [[ionization]] or an [[excited state]] may be indicated in the right superscript position (e.g., state of ionization Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;).
* The number of atoms of an element in a [[molecule]] or [[chemical compound]] is shown in the right subscript position (e.g., N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). If this number is one, it is normally omitted - the number one is then implicit.
* A [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] is indicated by a dot on the right side (e.g., Cl&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; for a neutral chlorine atom). This is often omitted unless relevant to a certain context because it is already deducible from the charge and atomic number information values.
In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], each chemical element has a dedicated [[Chinese character|character]], usually created for the purpose (see [[Chemical elements in East Asian languages]]). However, Latin symbols are also used, especially in formulas.

[[File:Simple Periodic Table Chart-en.svg|thumb|The [[periodic table]], elements being denoted by their symbols]]
A list of current, dated, as well as proposed and historical signs and symbols is included here with its [[definition|signification]]. Also given is each element's [[atomic number]], [[atomic weight]] or the [[atomic mass]] of the most stable [[isotope]], group and period numbers on the [[periodic table]], and [[etymology]] of the symbol.

[[Chemical hazard|Hazard pictographs]] are another type of symbols used in chemistry.

==Symbols for chemical elements==
{{#section-h:List of chemical elements|List}}
'''Antimatter''' atoms are denoted by a bar above the symbol for their matter counterpart, so e.g. &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt; is the symbol for [[antihydrogen]].

===Pictographic symbols===
The following is a list of pictographic symbols employed to symbolize elements known since ancient times (for example to the [[alchemy|alchemists]]).  Not included in this list are symbolic representations of substances previously called elements (such as certain [[Rare earth element|rare earth]] mineral blends and the [[classical element]]s [[fire (classical element)|fire]] and [[water (classical element)|water]] of ancient philosophy) which are known today to be multi-atomic.  Also not included are symbolic representations currently used for elements in other languages such as the [[Chemical elements in East Asian languages|Chinese characters for elements]].  Modern alphabetic notation was introduced in 1814 by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]].

==Symbols for named isotopes==
The following is a [[table of nuclides (complete)|list of isotopes]] of elements given in the previous tables which have been designated unique symbols.  By this it is meant that a comprehensive list of current systematic symbols (in the &lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;Atom form) are not included in the list and can instead be found in the [[Template:Isotope index|Isotope index]] chart. The symbols for the named [[isotopes of hydrogen]], [[deuterium]] (D) and [[tritium]] (T) are still in use today, as is [[thoron]] (Tn) for radon-220 (though not [[actinon]]; An is usually used instead for a generic [[actinide]]). [[Heavy water]] and other [[deuterated solvents]] are commonly used in chemistry, and it is convenient to use a single character rather than a symbol with a subscript in these cases. The practice also continues with tritium compounds. When the name of the solvent is given, a lowercase d is sometimes used. For example, d&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-benzene and C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; can be used instead of [&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=SectionH&gt;{{cite web|last1=IUPAC|title=Isotopically Modified Compounds|url=http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/sectionH/|publisher=IUPAC|accessdate=31 March 2015|ref=SectionH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbols for isotopes of elements other than hydrogen and radon are no longer in use within the scientific community. Many of these symbols were designated during the early years of [[radiochemistry]], and several isotopes (namely those in the [[actinium]] decay family, the [[radium]] decay family, and the [[thorium]] decay family) bear placeholder names using the early naming system devised by [[Ernest Rutherford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor-last= Morgan|editor-first= G. T.|date= 1905|title= Annual Reports on the Progress of Chemistry for 1904|journal= Journal of the Chemical Society|publisher= Gurney &amp; Jackson|volume= 1|pages= 268|quote= In view of the extraordinarily complex nature of the later changes occurring in Radium, Rutherford has proposed a new and convenient system of nomenclature. The first product of the change of the radium emanation is named radium A, the next radium B, and so on.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''tea leaf paradox''' describes a [[phenomenon]] where [[tea leaf|tea leaves]] in a [[teacup|cup]] of [[tea]] migrate to the center and bottom of the cup after being stirred rather than being forced to the edges of the cup, as would be expected in a spiral [[centrifuge]]. The correct physical explanation of the paradox was for the first time given by [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]] in 1857. He correctly connected the appearance of secondary flow (in both Earth atmosphere and tea cup) with ″friction on the bottom″ &lt;ref&gt;James Thomson, On the grand currents of atmospheric circulation (1857). Collected Papers in Physics and Engineering, Cambridge Univ., 1912, 144-148 [https://vk.com/wall-102183983_116 djvu file]&lt;/ref&gt;. The formation of secondary flows in an [[Annulus (mathematics)|annular channel]] was theoretically treated by [[Joseph Valentin Boussinesq|Boussinesq]] as early as in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Joseph Valentin Boussinesq|Boussinesq J.]]|date=1868|title=Mémoire sur l’influence des frottements dans les mouvements réguliers des fluides|url=http://portail.mathdoc.fr/JMPA/PDF/JMPA_1868_2_13_A17_0.pdf|journal=Journal de mathématiques pures et appliquées 2 e série|publisher=|volume=13|pages=377–424}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The migration of near-bottom particles in river-bend flows was experimentally investigated by A.

== Explanation ==
Stirring the liquid makes it spin around the cup.  In order to maintain this curved path, a [[centripetal force|centripetal]] force in towards the center is needed (similar to the tension in a string when spinning a bucket over your head).  This is accomplished by a pressure gradient outward (higher pressure outside than inside).

However, near the bottom and outer edges the liquid is slowed by the [[friction]] against the cup. There the fictitious (inertial) centrifugal force is weaker and cannot overcome the pressure gradient, so these pressure differences become more important for the water flow. This is called a [[boundary layer]] or more specifically an [[Ekman layer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~zhonghua/cee262a/Lecture18.ppt|title=CEE 262A Hydrodynamics Lecture 18|date=2007|page=35|accessdate=2008-12-29|format=[[Microsoft PowerPoint|PPT]]}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inertial centrifugal force due to the bulk rotation of the liquid results in the development of an outward pressure gradient within the liquid, where the pressure is higher along the rim than in the middle. This manifests itself as the formation of a concave liquid-air interface. This pressure gradient provides the necessary centripetal forces for [[circular motion]] when summed over the entirety of the rotating liquid.

However, within the boundary layers where fluid rotation is slowed by friction and viscous effects, the centripetal force due to [[pressure gradient (atmospheric)|pressure gradient]] is dominant over the inertial forces from rotation, and creates an inward [[secondary flow]] within the boundary layer. The flow converges at the bottom of the teacup (where the tea leaves are observed to gather) and flows upwards to the surface. Higher up, the liquid flow meets the surface and flows outwards. The leaves are too heavy to lift upwards and remain in the middle. Combined with the primary rotational flow, the leaves will be observed to spiral inwards along the bottom of the teacup.&lt;ref name="Naturwissenschaften" /&gt;

[[File:Man handing out Advertising Tissues.JPG|thumb|A man handing out advertising tissues to passersby in Tokyo]]
{{nihongo|'''Tissue-pack marketing'''|ティッシュ配り}} is a type of [[guerrilla marketing]] that is a phenomenon in Japan. Companies use small, portable tissue packages to move advertising copy directly into consumers' hands. About 4&amp;nbsp;billion of these packages of tissues are distributed on the streets annually in Japan—largely outside of subway stations. This industry generates sales in the range of [[Japanese Yen|¥]]75&amp;nbsp;billion annually.&lt;ref name="japan times"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ek20070821wh.html |title=Pocket Tissues |accessdate=2008-03-07 |author=Gordenker, Alice |date=2007-08-21 |work=The Japan Times Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The concept of tissue-pack marketing was first developed in Japan. Its origins date back to the late 1960s when Hiroshi Mori, the founder of a paper-goods manufacturer in [[Kōchi Prefecture]] called Meisei Industrial Co., was looking for ways to expand demand for paper products.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} At the time, the most common marketing [[freebie]] in Japan was boxes of matches. These were often given away at banks and then used by women in the kitchen. Mori figured tissues would have even wider appeal than the matches, and as a result he developed the machinery to fold and package tissues into easy-to-carry, pocket-size packs. The new product was marketed only as a form of advertising and was not sold to consumers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Where the more traditional [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]]s are often discarded without being read or simply not accepted by the consumer, the same is not true of advertising tissue-packs. The most important reason for this is because the tissues add functionality to the advertisement. This functionality has several benefits:

* Gets the ad into consumers' hands
:In an Internet survey of over 100,000 Japanese consumers conducted by Marsh Research, 76% said they accept free tissues.&lt;ref name="japan times"/&gt; This is a much higher rate than either fliers or leaflets.

*Gets consumers to read/look at the advert after they have accepted it
:In the same study referenced above, of those that accepted the tissue-pack, slightly more than half of the participants said they either "definitely look" or "at least glance at" the advertisement.&lt;ref name="japan times"/&gt; One possible reason for this increased statistic when compared to fliers is that consumers were hoping to find coupons or special offers packaged inside with the tissues.

*Helps consumers to retain the ad and its message
:The advertisement on the package is more likely to be retained by the consumer because they are being consistently exposed to it.

==Global spread==
Japan is still the main market for tissue-pack advertising, but the practice has begun to spread overseas. 

Pocket tissue advertising was introduced in Montreal, Canada, in December 2000 by Promotion Par Main.&lt;ref name="Promotion Par Main lance ses pub-mouchoirs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.infopresse.com/blogs/actualites/archive/2000/12/13/article-2220.aspx | date=2000-12-13 |title=Promotion Par Main lance ses pub-mouchoirs |work=Editions Infopresse  |author=Berube, Isabelle |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2005, this marketing method was also used in Ontario, Canada, by Hold'em Promotions Inc., after the company's founders saw tissue advertising during a trip to China.&lt;ref name="A Pack of Success"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=Campus&amp;articleID=152&amp;month=10&amp;day=20&amp;year=2005 |title=A Pack of Success |author=Perry, Dan |date=2005-10-20 |work=The UWO Gazette |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226071903/http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=Campus&amp;articleID=152&amp;month=10&amp;day=20&amp;year=2005 |archivedate=2005-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a subsidiary of the Japanese trading company [[Itochu]], [[AdPack USA]], introduced tissue-pack marketing in New York in 2005, and now offers it throughout the country.&lt;ref name="japan times"/&gt; 

In 2012, the tissue marketing company Adtishoo launched operations in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="menmedia20120611"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/enterprise/s/1580988_adtishoo-aims-to-take-off-in-uk |title=Adtishoo aims to take off in UK |date=2012-06-11 |work=Manchester Evening News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''traction substation''', '''traction current converter plant''' or '''traction power substation''' (TPSS) is an [[electrical substation]] that converts [[electric power]] from the form provided by the [[electrical power industry]] for [[public utility]] service to an appropriate [[voltage]], [[Electric current|current]] type and [[frequency]] to supply railways, trams (streetcars) or trolleybuses with [[traction current]].

==Conversions==
These systems can be used to convert [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] 50Hz or 60Hz [[alternating current]] (AC) for the supply of AC [[railway electrification system]]s at a lower frequency and [[Single-phase electric power|single phase]], as used by many older systems, or to [[Rectifier|rectify]] AC into [[direct current]] (DC) for those systems (primarily public transit systems) using DC for traction power.

==Equipment==
===Rotating===
Originally, the conversion equipment usually consisted of one or more [[motor-generator]] sets containing [[Synchronous motor#Three-phase AC synchronous motors|three-phase synchronous AC motors]] and [[single-phase AC generator]]s, mechanically coupled to a common shaft. [[Rotary converter]]s were also used, especially where the desired output was DC current from an AC source.

===Static===
In the 1920s, DC was derived using electronic valves ([[mercury arc rectifier]]s). In modern systems, high-voltage DC ([[HVDC]]) "back-to-back" stations are used instead of mechanical equipment to convert between different frequencies and phases of AC power and solid-state [[thyristor]] rectifier systems are used for conversion from AC power to DC traction power.

==Location==
Traction current converter plants are either decentralized (where one plant directly supplies the [[overhead lines]] or [[third rail]] of the traction system, with no feed into a traction current distribution network) or centralized (for the supply of the [[traction power network]], usually in addition to the direct supply of the overhead lines or third rail).

Central traction current converter plants are generally found in [[Germany]] (primarily in the cities of [[Neckarwestheim]], [[Ulm]], [[Nuremberg]]), [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]], while decentralized traction current converter plants are generally found in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and the German states of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] and [[Brandenburg]] as well as parts of [[Railway electrification in Great Britain#Existing systems - third and fourth rails|Great Britain]]. A [[List of railway electrification systems]] provides further detail.
