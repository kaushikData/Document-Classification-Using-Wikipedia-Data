The '''African Academy of Languages''' ('''ACALAN'''; {{lang-fr|Académie Africaine des Langues}}; {{lang-pt|Academia Africana de Línguas}} or {{lang|pt|italic=yes|ACALIN}}) is a [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] organization founded in 2001 by [[President of Mali|Mali's then-president]] [[Alpha Oumar Konaré]], under the auspices of the [[African Union]], for the harmonization of Africa's many spoken languages. The first head of ACALAN was Mali's former [[political minister|minister]] of Basic Education [[Adama Samassekou]]. As 2006 was declared by the AU as the [[Year of African Languages]], June 21 saw the inauguration of the interim Governing Board of ACALAN in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]].

From December 2009 until August 2015, Prof. [[Sozinho Francisco Matsinhe]] of [[Mozambique]] led ACALAN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acalan.org/eng/matsinhe_profile.php "Professor Sozinho Francisco Matsinhe's Profile," ACALAN website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203022101/http://www.acalan.org/eng/matsinhe_profile.php |date=December 3, 2013 }} ''(accessed 30 November 2013)''&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Lang Fafa Dampha currently heads the agency on an acting basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acalan.org/index.php/en/ ACALAN home page], ''(accessed 30 December 2016)''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arendalsk''', '''Arendal dialect''' or '''Arendal Norwegian''' ([[Bokmål]] and [[Nynorsk]]: ''Arendalsk'', ''Arendalsdialekten''; the Arendal dialect: ''Ændalsk'') is a dialect of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] used in [[Arendal]].

==Phonology==

* Intervocalic {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} are realized as voiced {{IPA|[{{IPA link|b}}, {{IPA link|d}}, {{IPA link|ɡ}}]}}. This feature appeared in this dialect in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="ehp"&gt;{{cite web|title="E kåmmår hen te du i sta" — Eydehavnportalen|url=http://www.aaks.no/Eydehavn/samfunnet/dialekt/|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kommune"&gt;{{cite web|title=Litt om arendalsdialekten - Arendal kommune |url=http://www.arendal.kommune.no/Innbygger/Tjenester/Kultur-idrett-og-fritid/Kulturhistorie/Manedens-kulturminne/Manedens-kulturminne-juliaugust-2011-Arendalsdialekten/Litt-om-arendalsdialekten/ |accessdate=24 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725071529/http://www.arendal.kommune.no/Innbygger/Tjenester/Kultur-idrett-og-fritid/Kulturhistorie/Manedens-kulturminne/Manedens-kulturminne-juliaugust-2011-Arendalsdialekten/Litt-om-arendalsdialekten/ |archivedate=25 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A uvular {{IPAblink|ʀ}} realization of {{IPA|/r/}} was established in Arendal before the 20th century.&lt;ref name="ehp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kommune"/&gt;
* {{IPA|/ʀ/}} is frequently dropped, so that e.g. ''Lars'' becomes ''Læs''.&lt;ref name="kommune"/&gt;
* The ending {{angbr|–er}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ɔ]}}, so that the word for 'basement' is ''kjeller'' in Bokmål, but ''kjellå'' in the Arendal dialect.&lt;ref name="ehp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kommune"/&gt;

According to the linguist Gjert Kristoffersen, a recent change is that the postvocalic {{IPA|/ʀ/}} is ''vocalized'' to {{IPA|[æ̯]}}, rather than dropped. The phonetic diphthongs {{IPA|[ʉæ̯]}} and {{IPA|[uæ̯]}} may be monophthongized and lowered to, respectively, {{IPA|[œː]}} and {{IPA|[ɔː]}}, so that the words for 'to do gymnastics' and 'thorn' (which phonemically are, respectively, {{IPA|/²tʉʀne/}} and {{IPA|/²tuʀne/}}) vary in their phonetic realization between, respectively, {{IPA|[²tʉæ̯nə ~ ²tœːnə]}} and {{IPA|[²tuæ̯nə ~ ²tɔːnə]}}. This process may be extended to mid vowels.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=36}}

===Tonemes===

====Phonetic realization====
Tonemes of the Arendal dialect are the same as those of the Oslo dialect; accent 1 is low-rising, whereas accent 2 is falling-rising.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|pp=236–237}}

==Notable speakers==
* [[Gjert Kristoffersen]]{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=36}}
* Rockebandet Ændal, a heavy metal band that sings in the Arendal dialect

'''Bidau Creole Portuguese''' (''Português de Bidau'') was a [[Portuguese Creole|Portuguese-based creole language]] that was spoken in [[Bidau]], an eastern suburb of [[Dili]], [[East Timor]] until the 1960s, when the speakers shifted to standard [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Bidau Creole Portuguese grew out of the Portuguese spoken by settlers and ''[[Mestizo|Mestiços]]'' from [[Flores|Flores Island]], influenced by languages introduced to the area by [[military]] men from [[Lifau]]. It shares a number of features with nearby creoles such as [[Macanese language|Macanese]].

'''Breton''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɛ|t|ən|}}; {{lang|br|brezhoneg}} {{IPA-br|bʁeˈzõːnɛk||brezhoneg.ogg}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Linguistic Student's Handbook |last=Bauer |first=Laurie |date=2007 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPA-br|brəhõˈnek|}} in [[Morbihan]]) is a [[Southwestern Brittonic languages|Southwestern Brittonic Celtic language]] spoken in [[Brittany]].

Breton was brought from [[Great Britain]] to [[Armorica]] by migrating [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]]; it is thus an [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic language]], and as such not closely related to the Continental Celtic [[Gaulish language]] which had been spoken in pre-Roman [[Gaul]]. Breton is most closely related to [[Cornish language|Cornish]], both being [[Southwestern Brittonic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Breton-language|title=Breton language|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and the extinct [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]] are the more distantly related [[Western Brittonic languages]]. Due to pressure from French, Breton phonology is closer to that of French than to its relatives in Britain.

The other [[regional language]] of Brittany, [[Gallo language|Gallo]], is a [[Langues d'oïl|langue d'oïl]]. Gallo is consequently close to French, although not mutually intelligible, and a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] descended from [[Latin]] (unlike the similarly named ancient Celtic language [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]]).

Having declined from more than 1,000,000 speakers around 1950 to about 200,000 in the first decade of the 21st century, Breton is classified as "severely endangered" by the UNESCO [[Red Book of Endangered Languages|Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]]. However, the number of children attending bilingual classes has risen 33% between 2006 and 2012 to 14,709.&lt;ref name="Broudic2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ofis-stats"/&gt;

==History and status==
{{see also|Linguistic boundary of Brittany}}
Breton is spoken in [[Lower Brittany]] ({{lang-br|Breizh-Izel}}), roughly to the west of a line linking [[Plouha]] (west of [[Saint-Brieuc]]) and [[La Roche-Bernard]] (east of [[Vannes]]). It comes from a Brittonic language community that once extended from Great Britain to [[Armorica]] (present-day Brittany) and had even established a toehold in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (in present-day Spain). Old Breton is attested from the 9th century. It was the language of the upper classes until the 12th century, after which it became the language of commoners in Lower Brittany. The nobility, followed by the [[bourgeoisie]], adopted [[French language|French]]. The written language of the [[Duchy of Brittany]] was [[Latin]], switching to French in the 15th century. There exists a limited tradition of [[Breton literature]]. Some Old Breton vocabulary remains in the present day as [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and scientific terms in Modern Breton. The recognized stages of the Breton language are: '''Old Breton''' - c.800 to c.1100, '''Middle Breton''' - c.1100 to c.1650, '''Modern Breton''' - c.1650 to present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia |last=Koch |first=John T. |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2006 |location=Santa Barbara, Califfornia |oclc=62381207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French monarchy was not concerned with the [[Minority language|minority]] [[languages of France]] spoken by the lower classes, and required the use of French for government business as part of its policy of national unity. During the [[French Revolution]], the government introduced policies favouring French over the regional languages, which it pejoratively referred to as {{lang|fr|[[patois]]}}. The revolutionaries assumed that [[reactionary]] and [[monarchy|monarchist]] forces preferred [[regional language]]s to try to keep the peasant masses underinformed. In 1794, [[Bertrand Barère]] submitted his "report on the {{lang|fr|patois}}" to the [[Committee of Public Safety]] in which he said that "federalism and superstition speak Breton".&lt;ref name="breizh"/&gt;

Since the 19th century, under the [[French Third Republic|Third]], [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth]] and [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republics]], the government has attempted to stamp out minority languages, including Breton, in state schools, in an effort to build a national culture. Teachers humiliated students for using their regional languages, and such practices prevailed until the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="breizh"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.breizh.net/icdbl/saozg/endangered.htm#Image%2520No.%25202:%2520Breton%2520is%2520a%2520hindrance%2520to%2520good%2520citizenship |title=Breton – An Endangered Language of Europe |last=Kuter |first=Lois  |date=May 2004 |website=breizh.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, due to the political centralization of France, the influence of the media, and the increasing mobility of people, only about 200,000 people can speak Breton, a dramatic decline from more than a million in 1950. The majority of today's speakers are more than 60 years old, and Breton is now classified as an [[endangered language]].&lt;ref name="Broudic2009" /&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, half of the population of Lower Brittany knew only Breton; the other half were bilingual. By 1950, there were only 100,000 [[monolingualism|monolingual]] Bretons, and this rapid decline has continued, with likely no monolingual speakers left today. A statistical survey in 1997 found around 300,000 speakers in Lower Brittany, of whom about 190,000 were aged 60 or older. Few 15- to 19-year-olds spoke Breton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Qui parle breton aujourd'hui? Qui le parlera demain? |last=Broudic |first=Fañch |publisher=Brud Nevez |year=1999 |location=Brest |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival efforts==
In 1925, Professor [[Roparz Hemon]] founded the Breton-language review ''[[Gwalarn]].'' During its 19-year run, ''Gwalarn'' tried to raise the language to the level of a great international language.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Favereau, "Anthologie de la littérature bretonne au XXe siècle : 1919-1944", "Tome 2 : Breiz Atao et les autres en littérature", Skol Vreizh, 2003, {{ISBN|2-911447-94-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its publication encouraged the creation of original literature in all genres, and proposed Breton translations of internationally recognized foreign works. In 1946, ''[[Al Liamm]]'' replaced ''Gwalarn''. Other Breton-language periodicals have been published, which established a fairly large body of literature for a minority language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Minority Literatures and Modernism: Scots, Breton, and Occitan, 1920-1990 |last=Calin |first=William |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2000 |isbn=9780802083654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, [[Diwan (school)|Diwan schools]] were founded to teach Breton by [[Language immersion|immersion]]. They taught a few thousand young people from elementary school to high school. See the [[#Education|education section]] for more information.

The ''[[Asterix]]'' comic series has been translated into Breton. According to the comic, the [[Gaul]]ish village where Asterix lives is in the [[Armorica|Armorica peninsula]], which is now Brittany. Some other popular comics have also been translated into Breton, including ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', ''[[Spirou et Fantasio|Spirou]]'', ''[[Titeuf]]'', ''[[Hägar the Horrible]]'', ''[[Peanuts]]'' and ''[[Yakari]]''.

Some original media are created in Breton. The sitcom, ''Ken Tuch'', is in Breton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media  | last1 = an Henaff | first1 = Goulwena | last2 = Strubel | first2 = Etienne |year= 2008 |title= Ken Tuch' |medium= Web videos |language= Breton |url= http://www.breizhvod.com/video/product/ken-tuch-l-integrale.html |access-date= 25 February 2015 |location= An Oriant, Breizh |publisher= Dizale }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Adkins | first1 = Madeleine | last2 = Davis | first2 = Jenny L. | title = The naïf, the sophisticate, and the party girl: Regional and gender stereotypes in Breton language web videos | journal = Gender and Language, Special Issue: Gender and Endangered Languages | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 291–308 | doi = 10.1558/genl.v6i2.291 | date = September 2012 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/1927936/The_na%C3%AFf_the_sophisticate_and_the_party_girl_Regional_and_gender_stereotypes_in_Breton_language_web_videos Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radio Kerne]], broadcasting from [[Finistère]], has exclusively Breton programming. Some movies (''[[Lancelot du Lac (film)|Lancelot du Lac]]'', ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', ''[[Marion du Faouet]]'', ''[[Sezneg]]'') and TV series (''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'') have also been translated and broadcast in Breton.  Poets, singers, linguists, and writers who have written in Breton, including [[Yann-Ber Kalloc'h]], [[Roparz Hemon]], [[Anjela Duval]], [[Xavier de Langlais]], [[Pêr-Jakez Helias]], [[Youenn Gwernig]], [[Glenmor]] and [[Alan Stivell]] are now known internationally.

Today, Breton is the only living [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] that is not recognized by a national government as an official or regional language.

The first Breton dictionary, the ''[[Catholicon (trilingual dictionary)|Catholicon]]'', was also the first French dictionary. Edited by Jehan Lagadec in 1464, it was a trilingual work containing Breton, French and Latin. Today bilingual dictionaries have been published for Breton and languages including English, Dutch, German, Spanish and Welsh. A new generation{{clarify|date=March 2016}} is determined to gain international recognition for Breton. The monolingual dictionary, {{lang|br|Geriadur Brezhoneg an Here}} (1995), defines Breton words in Breton. The first edition contained about 10,000 words, and the second edition of 2001 contains 20,000 words.

In the early 21st century, the {{lang|br|[[Ofis ar Brezhoneg]]}} ("Office of the Breton language") began a campaign to encourage daily use of Breton in the region by both businesses and local communes. Efforts include installing bilingual signs and posters for regional events, as well as encouraging the use of the [[Spilhennig]] to let speakers identify each other. The office also started an [[Internationalization and localization]] policy asking [[Google]], [[Firefox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mozilla.org/br/firefox/fx/|title=Browse Freely|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{br icon}} [http://www.drouizig.org/index.php/br/troidigezh-br/kenrouedad-br/231-firefox-ha-thunderbird Firefox ha Thunderbird]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SPIP]] to develop their interfaces in Breton. In 2004, the [[Breton Wikipedia]] started, which now counts more than 65,000 articles. In March 2007, the ''Ofis ar Brezhoneg'' signed a [[wikt:tripartite|tripartite agreement]] with [[Regional Council of Brittany]] and [[Microsoft]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.agencebretagnepresse.com/article.php?id=6519 Microsoft au secours des langues celtiques y compris du breton]&lt;/ref&gt; for the consideration of the Breton language in Microsoft products. In October 2014, [[Facebook]] added Breton as one of its 121 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.ouest-france.fr/facebook-et-maintenant-une-version-en-breton-2873502 Facebook. Et maintenant une version en breton]&lt;/ref&gt; after three years of talks between the ''Ofis'' and Facebook.

==Geographic distribution and dialects==
[[File:Breton dialectes.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Dialects of Breton]]
Breton is spoken mainly in Lower Brittany, but also in a more dispersed way in Upper Brittany (where [[Gallo language|Gallo]] is spoken alongside Breton and French), and in areas around the world that have Breton emigrants.

The four traditional dialects of Breton correspond to medieval bishoprics rather than to linguistic divisions.  They are {{lang|br|leoneg}} ({{lang|fr|léonard}}, of the [[Viscounty of Léon|county of Léon]]), {{lang|br|tregerieg}} ({{lang|fr|[[Trégorrois Breton dialect|trégorrois]]}}, of [[Trégor]]), {{lang|br|kerneveg}} ({{lang|fr|cornouaillais}}, of {{lang|fr|[[Cornouaille]]}}), and {{lang|br|[[gwenedeg]]}} ({{lang|fr|vannetais}}, of [[Vannes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Celtic-languages#toc74852|title=Celtic languages|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{lang|fr|Guérandais}} was spoken up to the beginning of the 20th century in the region of [[Guérande]] and [[Batz-sur-Mer]].  There are no clear boundaries between the dialects because they form a [[dialect continuum]], varying only slightly from one village to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Breton Orthographies and Dialects: The Twentieth-century, Vol. 2|last=Wmffre|first=Iwan|publisher=Peter Lang AG, Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften|year=2008|isbn=3039113658|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|br|[[Gwenedeg]]}}, however, is almost mutually unintelligible with most of the other dialects.&lt;ref name=kergoat&gt;Kergoat, Lukian.

==Official status==
{{see also|Language policy of France}}
[[File:Ofis ar Brezhoneg vehicle.jpg|thumb|''[[Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg]]'', the Breton language agency, was set up in 1999 by the Brittany region to promote and develop the use of Breton.]]

===Nation===
As noted, only French is an [[official language]] of [[France]]. Supporters of Breton and other minority languages continue to argue for their recognition, education in public schools and place in public life.&lt;ref name="Hoopes"&gt;{{cite news|title=France a 'rogue state' on regional languages|author=Simon Hooper|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|accessdate=30 March 2012|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/03/201232943156736852.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constitution====
In July 2008, the legislature amended the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]], adding article 75-1: {{lang|fr|les langues régionales appartiennent au patrimoine de la France}} (the [[regional languages]] belong to the heritage of [[France]]).

The [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], which obliges signatory states to recognize minority and regional languages, was signed by France in 1999 but has not been ratified.  On 27 October 2015, the [[Senate (France)|Senate]] rejected a draft constitutional law ratifying the charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/actu/politique/article/le-senat-rejette-le-projet-de-loi-de-ratification-de-la-charte-europeenne-des-langues-regionales-741405 |title=Le Sénat dit non à la Charte européenne des langues régionales |date=27 October 2015 |work=www.franceinfo.fr |access-date=1 November 2015 |agency=franceinfo |language=French |trans-title=The Senate says no to the European Charter for Regional Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bilingual sign Vannes Gwened.jpg|thumb|Bilingual sign in [[Vannes]] ({{lang|br|Gwened}})]]

===Region===
Regional and departmental authorities use Breton to a very limited extent, for example in signage. Some bilingual signage has also been installed, such as street name signs in Breton towns. One station of the [[Rennes Metro|Rennes metro system]] has signs in both French and Breton.

Under the French law known as [[Toubon Law|Toubon]], it is illegal for commercial signage to be in Breton alone. Signs must be bilingual or French only. Since commercial signage usually has limited physical space, most businesses have signs only in French.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

{{lang|br|[[Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg]]}}, the Breton language agency, was set up in 1999 by the Brittany region to promote and develop the daily use of Breton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofis-bzh.org |title=Ofis ar Brezhoneg |publisher=Ofis-bzh.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It created the {{lang|br|[[Ya d'ar brezhoneg]]}} campaign, to encourage enterprises, organisations and communes to promote the use of Breton, for example by installing bilingual signage or translating their websites into Breton.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Education==
[[File:Breton school sign in Rennes.jpg|thumb|Sign in French and partly in Breton in Rennes, outside a school with bilingual classes]]

In the late 20th century, the French government considered incorporating the independent Breton-language immersion schools (called {{lang|br|[[Diwan (school)|Diwan]]}}) into the state education system. This action was blocked by the French [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] based on the 1994 amendment to the Constitution that establishes French as the language of the republic. Therefore, no other language may be used as a language of instruction in state schools. The [[Toubon Law]] implemented the amendment, asserting that French is the language of public education.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The [[Diwan (school)|Diwan schools]] were founded in Brittany in 1977 to teach Breton by [[Language immersion|immersion]]. They taught a few thousand young people from elementary school to high school. They have gained fame owing to their high level of results in school exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.diwanbreizh.org/sections.php4?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=6 Diwan FAQ, #6].&lt;/ref&gt; Breton-language schools do not receive funding from the national government, though the Brittany Region may fund them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carla.umn.edu/immersion/acie/vol8/Feb2005_guest_diwan.html|title=The Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition (CARLA):Articulation of Language Instruction|website=carla.umn.edu|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another teaching method is a bilingual approach by {{lang|br|Div Yezh}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://div-yezh.org/|title=Actualités|first=Yannick /|last=Rostrenn|publisher=div-yezh.org|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Two Languages") in the State schools, created in 1979. {{lang|br|Dihun}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dihun.com/|title=Dihun - Dihun Language|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Awakening") was created in 1990 for bilingual education in the Catholic schools.

===Statistics===
In 2018, 18,337&lt;ref name="ofis-stats" /&gt; pupils (about 2.00% of all pupils in Brittany) attended Diwan, Div Yezh and Dihun schools. Their number has increased yearly. [[Jean-Yves Le Drian]], the president of the [[Regional Council of Brittany|Regional Council]], had a goal of 20,000 pupils by 2010, but is encouraged by their progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agencebretagnepresse.com/fetch.php?id=11436|title=Interview with Jean-Yves Le Drian, the president of the Region Council|publisher=angencebretagnepresse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, some 4,500 to 5,000 adults followed a Breton language course (such as evening course, correspondence, or other). The family transmission of Breton in 1999 is estimated to be 3 percent.&lt;ref name="ofis-stats" /&gt;

===Other forms of education===
In addition to bilingual education (including Breton-medium education) the region has introduced the Breton language in primary education, mainly in the department of Finistère. These "initiation" sessions are generally one to three hours per week, and consist of songs and games.

Schools in secondary education (''[[collège]]s'' and ''[[lycée]]s'') offer some courses in Breton. In 2010, nearly 5,000 students in Brittany were reported to be taking this option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://studi.canalblog.com/archives/2010/06/20/18372084.html |title=L'option de breton : que faire ? |date=2010-06-20 |website=Studi : enseigner le breton et en breton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the University of Rennes 2 has a Breton language department offering courses in the language along with a master's degree in Breton and Celtic Studies.

==Phonology==
{{IPA notice}}

===Vowels===
Vowels in Breton may be [[vowel length|short or long]]. All unstressed vowels are short; stressed vowels can be short or long (vowel lengths are not noted in usual orthographies as they are implicit in the phonology of particular dialects, and not all dialects pronounce stressed vowels as long).

All vowels can also be [[nasalization|nasalized]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hemon |first1=Roparz |authorlink1=Roparz Hemon |last2=Everson |first2=Michael |authorlink2=Michael Everson |title=Breton Grammar |edition=2 |year=2007 |publisher=Evertype/Al Liamm |isbn=978-1-904808-11-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is noted by appending an 'n' letter after the base vowel, or by adding a combining tilde above the vowel (most commonly and easily done for ''a'' and ''o'' due to the [[Portuguese orthography|Portuguese letters]]), or more commonly by non-ambiguously appending an {{Angle bracket|ñ}} letter after the base vowel (this depends on the orthographic variant).

* Pronunciation of the letter {{angbr|r}} varies nowadays: {{IPA|[ʁ]}} is used in the French-influenced standard language and, generally speaking, in the central parts of Lower Brittany (including the south of Trégor, the west of Vannetais and virtually all parts of Cornouaille) whereas {{IPA|[r]}} is the common realisation in Léon and often in the Haut-Vannetais dialect of central Morbihan (in and around the city of Vannes and the Pays de Pontivy), though in rapid speech mostly a tapped {{IPA|[ɾ]}} occurs. In the other regions of Trégor {{IPA|[ɾ]}} or even {{IPA|[ɹ]}} may be found.
* The voiced dental fricative ({{IPAslink|ð}}) is a conservative realisation of the [[lenition]] (or the "spirant mutation" in cases where the phenomenon originates from the mutation of {{IPA|/t~θ/}}, respectively) of the consonants {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} which is to be found in certain varieties of Haut-Vannetais. Most of the Breton dialects do not inherit the sound and thus it is mostly not orthographically fixed. The Peurunvan, for instance, uses{{angbr|z}}  for both mutations which is regularly and more prominently pronounced {{IPA|[z]}} in Léonais, Cornouaillais, Trégorrois and Bas-Vannetais. In traditional literature written in the Vannetais dialect, two different graphemes are employed for representing the dental fricative, depending on the scripture's historical period. There once was a time when {{angbr|d}} was used to transcribe the sound but today mostly the regular {{angbr|z}} is instead used, and this practice can be traced back to at least the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Christmas Hymns in the Vannes Dialect of Breton|publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|year=1956|isbn=|editor-last=Hemon|editor-first=Roparz|location=Dublin|pages=x, xxvi|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area this phenomenon has been found to be evident in, encompasses the towns of [[Pontivy]] and [[Baud, Morbihan|Baud]] and surrounding smaller villages like [[Cléguérec|Cléguerec]], [[Noyal-Pontivy]], [[Pluméliau]], [[Saint-Allouestre|St. Allouestre]], [[Saint-Barthélemy, Morbihan|St. Barthélemy]], [[Pluvigner]] and also parts of [[Belle Île|Belle-Île]]. The only known place where the mutation occurs outside of the Vannes country is the [[Île de Sein|Île de-Sein]], an island located off [[Finistère]]'s coast. Some scholars also used {{IPA|[ẓ]}} as the symbol for the sound to indicate that it was rather an "infra-dental" consonant than a clear interdental, which is the sound the symbol {{IPA|/ð/}} is usually describes. Other linguists, however, did not draw that distinction, either because they identified the sound to actually be an interdental fricative (such as Roparz Hemon in his phonetic transcription of the dialect used in Pluméliau or Joseph Loth in his material about the dialect of [[Sauzon]] in Belle-Île) or due to the fact that they merely attached any importance to it and ascertained that their descriptions were not in need of a further clarification of the sound's phonetic realisation as it was a clearly distinguishable phoneme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Historical Phonology of Breton|last=Jackson|first=Kenneth H.|publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|year=1968|isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=661 ff|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Historical Morphology and Syntax of Breton|last = Hemon|first = Roparz|publisher = Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|year = 1975|isbn = 978-0901282637|location = Dublin|pages = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
{{main|Breton grammar}}
&lt;!-- Description of the grammar of the language. --&gt;

===Verbal aspect===
As in [[English language|English]] as well as the other Celtic languages, a variety of verbal constructions are available to express [[grammatical aspect]], for example: showing a distinction between [[progressive tense|progressive]] and habitual actions:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"

! Irish
! Welsh
! Cornish
|-
| {{lang|br|Me '''zo o komz''' gant ma amezeg}}
| I '''am talking''' with my neighbour
| {{lang|ga|'''Táim ag labhairt''' le mo chomharsana}}
| {{lang|cy|'''Dw i'n siarad''' â fy nghymydog}}

|}

==="Inflected" prepositions===
As in other modern [[Celtic languages]], Breton pronouns are fused into preceding prepositions to produce a sort of [[inflected preposition|"conjugated" preposition]]. Below are some examples in Breton, [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], and [[Manx language|Manx]], along with English translations.

|}
Note that in the examples above the [[Goidelic languages]] (Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx) use the preposition meaning ''at'' to show possession, whereas the [[Brittonic languages]] use ''with''. The Goidelic languages, however, do use the preposition ''with'' to express "belong to" (Irish {{lang|ga|is liom an leabhar}}, Scottish {{lang|gd|is leam an leabhar}}, Manx {{lang|gv|s'lhiams yn lioar}}, The book belongs to me).

Note also that the above examples of Welsh are the [[literary Welsh morphology#Prepositions|formal written language]]. The order and preposition may differ slightly in [[colloquial Welsh morphology#Prepositions|colloquial Welsh]] (Formal {{lang|cy|mae car gennym}}, North Wales {{lang|cy|mae gynnon ni gar}}, South Wales {{lang|cy|mae car gyda ni}}).

===Initial consonant mutations===
{{Main|Breton mutations}}
Breton has four initial [[consonant mutation]]s: though modern Breton lost the nasal mutation of [[Welsh language|Welsh]], it also has a "hard" mutation, in which voiced stops become voiceless, and a "mixed" mutation, which is a mixture of hard and soft mutations.

==Vocabulary==
&lt;!-- This section should contain a discussion of any special features of the vocabulary (or lexicon) of the language, like if it contains a large number of borrowed words or a different set of words for different politeness levels, taboo groups, etc. --&gt;
&lt;!-- This paragraph underneath doesn't deal with Breton vocabulary but English vocabulary. This paragraph belongs on a page about English borrowings, not on a page about the Breton language. --&gt;

===Words that passed into French and into English===
The English words {{wikt-lang|en|dolmen}} and {{wikt-lang|en|menhir}} have been borrowed from French, which took them from Breton. However, this is uncertain: for instance, ''menhir'' is ''peulvan'' or ''maen hir'' ("long stone"), ''maen sav'' ("straight stone") (two words: noun + adjective) in Breton. ''Dolmen'' is a misconstructed word (it should be ''taol-'''''v'''''aen''). Some studies state{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that these words were borrowed from [[Cornish language|Cornish]]. {{lang|cy|Maen hir}} can be directly translated from Welsh as "long stone" (which is exactly what a {{lang|br|menhir}} or {{lang|br|maen hir}} is). The Cornish surnames Mennear, Minear and Manhire all derive from the Cornish ''{{wikt-lang|kw|men}} {{wikt-lang|kw|hyr}}'' ("long stone"), as does Tremenheere "settlement by the long stone".

The French word {{wikt-lang|fr|baragouiner}} ("to jabber in a foreign language") is derived from Breton ''{{wikt-lang|br|bara}}'' ("bread") and ''{{wikt-lang|br|gwin}}'' ("wine").  The French word {{wikt-lang|fr|goéland}} ("large seagull") is derived from Breton ''{{wikt-lang|br|gwelan}}'', which shares the same root as English "gull" (Welsh ''{{wikt-lang|cy|gwylan}}'', Cornish ''{{wikt-lang|kw|goelann}}'').

==Orthography==
The first extant Breton texts, contained in the Leyde manuscript, were written at the end of the 8th century: 50 years prior to the [[Strasbourg Oaths]], considered to be the earliest example of [[French language|French]]. Like many medieval orthographies, Old- and Middle Breton orthography was at first not standardised, and the spelling of a particular word varied at authors' discretion. In 1499, however, the ''[[Catholicon (trilingual dictionary)|Catholicon]]'', was published; as the first dictionary written for both French and Breton, it became a point of reference on how to transcribe the language. The orthography presented in the ''Catholicon'' was largely similar to that of French, in particular with respect to the representation of vowels, as well as the use of both the Latinate digraph {{angbr|qu}}—a remnant of the sound change /kʷ/ &gt; /k/ in Latin—and Brittonic {{angbr|cou-}}or {{angbr|cu-}} to represent /k/ before front vowels.

As phonetic and phonological differences between the dialects began to magnify, many regions, particularly the Vannes country, began to devise their own orthographies. Many of these orthographies were more closely related to the French model, albeit with some modifications. Examples of these modifications include the replacement of Old Breton {{angbr|-z}} with {{angbr|-h}} to denote word-final /x~h/ (an evolution of Old Breton /θ/ in the Vannes dialect) and use of {{angbr|-h}} to denote the initial mutation of /k/ (today this mutation is written {{angbr|c'h}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Historical Morphology and Syntax of Breton|last=Hemon|first=Roparz|publisher=Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies|year=1975|isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus needed another transcription.

In the 1830s [[Jean-François Le Gonidec]] created a modern phonetic system for the language.

During the early years of the 20th century, a group of writers known as {{lang|br|Emglev ar Skrivanerien}} elaborated and reformed Le Gonidec's system. They made it more suitable as a super-dialectal representation of the dialects of [[Cornouaille]], Leon and Trégor (known as from ''Kernev'', ''Leon'' and ''Treger'' in Breton). This '''KLT''' orthography was established in 1911. At the same time writers of the more divergent Vannetais dialect developed a phonetic system also based on that of Le Gonidec.

Following proposals made during the 1920s, the KLT and Vannetais orthographies were merged in 1941 to create an orthographic system to represent all four dialects. This {{lang|br|Peurunvan}} ("wholly unified") orthography was significant for the inclusion of the ''zh'' [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]], which represents a {{IPA|/h/}} in Vannetais and corresponds to a {{IPA|/z/}} in the KLT dialects.

In 1955 [[François Falc'hun]] and the group Emgleo Breiz proposed a new orthography. It was designed to use a set of [[graphemes]] closer to the conventions of French. This {{lang|fr|Orthographie Universitaire}} ("University Orthography", known in Breton as {{lang|br|Skolveurieg}}) was given official recognition by the French authorities as the "official orthography of Breton in French education." It was opposed in the region and today is used only by the magazine ''Brud Nevez'' and the publishing house Emgléo Breiz.

Between 1971 and 1974, a new standard orthography was devised — the {{lang|br|etrerannyezhel}} or {{lang|fr|interdialectale}}. This system is based on the derivation of the words.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Today the majority of writers continue to use the ''Peurunvan orthography'', and it is the version taught in most Breton-language schools.

Due to the deficient suitableness of those standardised, interdialectal orthography for many dialects (especially the Vannes dialect) they are seen as a threat by some activists, rather than as a helping tool for promoting and spreading the language because it endangers the rich variety of the still living dialects and encourages the usage of a de facto non-existent artificial language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://projetbabel.org/bretonguened/skriturieu|title=Breton Guéned, Le breton vannetais |last=le Goff |first=Sébastien |date= |website=projetbabel.org |access-date=2017-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alphabet===
Breton is written in the [[Latin script]]. ''Peurunvan'', the most commonly used orthography, consists of the following letters:

: a, b, ch, c'h, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u, v, w, y, z

The [[circumflex]], [[grave accent]], [[trema (diacritic)|trema]] and [[tilde]] appear on some letters. These [[diacritic]]s are used in the following way:

: â, ê, î, ô, û, ù, ü, ñ

See [[v:Introduction to Breton/Breton pronunciation]] for an introduction to the Breton alphabet and pronunciation.

===Differences between {{lang|br|Skolveurieg}} and {{lang|br|Peurunvan}}===
Both orthographies use the above alphabet, although ''é'' is used only in {{lang|br|Skolveurieg}}.

Differences between the two systems are particularly noticeable in word endings. In Peurunvan, final [[obstruent]]s, which are devoiced in absolute final position and voiced in [[sandhi]] before voiced sounds, are represented by a grapheme that indicates a voiceless sound. In OU they are written as voiced but represented as voiceless before suffixes: {{lang|br|braz}} (big), {{lang|br|brasoc'h}} (bigger).

In addition, Peurunvan maintains the KLT convention, which distinguishes noun/adjective pairs by nouns written with a final voiced consonant and adjectives with a voiceless one. No distinction is made in pronunciation, e.g. '''{{lang|br|brezhoneg}}''' ''Breton language'' vs. '''{{lang|br|brezhonek}}''' ''Breton (adj)''.

'''Notes:'''
# {{Note|Pron-1}} Vocative particle: ''â Vreizh'' O Brittany!
# {{Note|Pron-2}} Word-initially.
# {{Note|Pron-3}} Word-finally.
# {{Note|Pron-4}} Non-written lenition of ''ch, c'h, f, s'' and spirantization of ''p'' &gt; ''f'' {{IPA|[v]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-5}} Unstressed vowels ''e, eu, o'' are pronounced {{IPA|[ɛ, œ, ɔ]}} in Leoneg but {{IPA|[e, ø, o]}} in the other dialects. The pronunciation {{IPA|[ɛ̞, œ̞, ɔ̞]}} appears mainly in front of clusters ''lc'h, rc'h'' (less often also before ''c'h''), before semivowels {{IPA|[j, w]}}, before other clusters beginning with ''r, l'' and before ''rr''. Stressed long ''e, eu, o'' are realized as {{IPA|[eː, øː, oː]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-6}} In Gwenedeg velars or labialized velars are palatalized when followed by ''e'' and ''i'': ''k, g, kw/kou, c'hw/c'hou, gw/gou, w/ou, sk'' to {{IPA|[c, ɟ, cɥ, hɥ, ɟɥ, ɥ, sc/ʃc]}}. Instead of {{IPA|[c, ɟ]}} also {{IPA|[tʃ, dʒ]}} may appear.
# {{Note|Pron-7}} In Gwenedeg word-final ''g'' and ''k'' is palatalized to [c] after preceding ''i''.
# {{Note|Pron-8}} But before a vowel other than ''i'' the digraph ''ni'' is written instead of ''gn'', e.g. ''bleniañ'' to drive', radical ''blegn'', 1PS preterite ''blegnis'', 3PS preterite ''blenias''.
# {{Note|Pron-9}} But mute in words such as '''''h'''a(g), '''h'''e(c'h), '''h'''o(c'h), '''h'''oll, '''h'''on/'''h'''or/'''h'''ol''. Silent in Gwenedeg and Leoneg.
# {{Note|Pron-10}} ''I'' is realized as {{IPA|[j]}} when it precedes or follows a vowel (or when between vowels), but in words such as ''l'''i'''en, l'''i'''orzh, rakd'''i'''azezañ'' the letter ''i'' is pronounced as {{IPA|[iː]}} (in orthography ''ï'' may be used:''lïen, lïorzh, rakdïazezañ'').
# {{Note|Pron-11}} Group ''ilh'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ʎ]}} when it follows an vowel, following a consonant the group is pronounced [iʎ]. But before a vowel other than ''i'' ''li'' is written instead of ''ilh'', e.g. ''heuliañ'' to follow, radical ''heuilh'', 1PS preterite ''heulhis'', 3PS preterite ''heulias''. In some regions instead of {{IPA|[ʎ]}} may appear pronunciation {{IPA|[j]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-12}} Word-finally following a cluster of unvoiced consonants.
# {{Note|Pron-13}} In front of ''k, g''.
# {{Note|Pron-14}} The digraph ''ou'' is realized same as the letter ''w'' when preceded or followed by a vowel (or when between vowels), but in words such as ''Doue, douar, gouarn'' the digraph ''ou'' is pronounced {{IPA|[uː]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-15}} The digraph ''où'' marks plural ending. Its pronunciation varies throughout Brittany: {{IPA|[u, o, ø, ow, aw, aɥ, ɔɥ]}} rating geographically from Northwest Leon to Southeast Gwened.
# {{Note|Pron-16}} The letter ''v'' is usually pronounced {{IPA|[v]}}, but word-finally (except word-final ''ñv'') is pronounced usually as {{IPA|[w]}} or in KLT, as {{IPA|[ɥ]}} in Gwenedeg and as {{IPA|[f]}} in Goëlo. The pronunciation {{IPA|[v]}} is retained word-finally in verbs. In words ''bli'''v''', Gwiskri'''v''', gwi'''v''', li'''v''', pi'''v''', ri'''v''''' are ''v'' is pronounced {{IPA|[u]}} in KLT, {{IPA|[ɥ]}} in Gwenedeg and {{IPA|[f]}} in Goëlo. Word-finally following ''r, l, n, z'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[o]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-17}} But mute in words such as ''goue'''z''', bloa'''z''', goa'''z''', ru'''z'''iañ, klei'''z''', rakdïaze'''z'''añ, be'''z'''añ, Roa'''zh'''on, de'''zh'''añ, koue'''zh'''añ, ''''z''', a'''z''', e'''z''', da''''z''', gwirione'''z''', enep(g)wirione'''z''', monei'''z''', falsvonei'''z''', karante'''z''', kengarante'''z''', neve'''z''', neve'''z'''c'hanet, nado'''z'''ioù, abardae'''z''', gwe'''z''', bemde'''z''', kri'''z''', blei'''z''', morvlei'''z''', de'''zh'''i ''. ''Z'' is generally mute in Kerneweg, Tregerieg and Gwenedeg, but in Leoneg ''z(h)'' is always pronounced.

# {{Note|Pron-19}} Used to distinguish ''trôad'' circuit/tour from ''troad'' foot.
# {{Note|Pron-20}} In northern dialects (mainly in Leoneg), there is a tendency to voice ''c'h'' between vowels. Pronunciation {{IPA|[ɣ]}} appears also in forms of lenition of ''g, c'h'' and mixed mutation of ''g''.
# {{Note|Pron-21}} The lenition of ''d'' and the spirantization of ''t'' is also transcribed as ''z'' and is most prominently pronounced {{IPA|[z]}} although in certain regions also {{IPA|[s]}} (for ''t'', particularly in Cornouaille) and {{IPA|[ð]}} (in some Haut-Vannetais varieties, see note 31) occur.
# {{Note|Pron-22}} Pronunciation of ''r'' varies in Brittany, nowadays uvular {{IPA|[ʀ]}} (or {{IPA|[ʁ]}}) is a standard; in Leoneg ''r'' is pronounced {{IPA|[r]}}, in Tregerieg {{IPA|[ɾ]}} or {{IPA|[ɹ]}}, in Kerneveg {{IPA|[ʀ]}} and {{IPA|[ʁ]}} are most common, in Gwenedeg {{IPA|[ʀ], [ʁ], [r], [ɾ]}} occur.
# {{Note|Pron-23}} In Gwenedeg unstressed ''e'' often {{IPA|[ə]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-24}} Lenited varieties of ''r, l, n'' may appear word-initially in case of soft mutation.
# {{Note|Pron-25}} In Leoneg {{IPA|[u(ː)]}} in front of a nasal.
# {{Note|Pron-26}} In Leoneg ''w'' in front of ''e, i'' {{IPA|[v]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-27}} In Leoneg ''z(h)'' in front of ''i'' {{IPA|[ʃ]}} or {{IPA|[ʒ]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-28}} In Leoneg ''gwr'' {{IPA|[ɡr]}}.
# {{Note|Pron-29}} Before a vowel.
# {{Note|Pron-30}} Forms of the indefinite article.
# {{Note|Pron-31}}A conservative realisation of the initial mutation of ''d'' and ''t'', used in certain parts of the Vannes country.

'''Ciguayo''' (Siwayo) was the language of the [[Samaná Peninsula]] of Hispaniola (now the Dominican Republic) at the time of the [[Spanish Conquest]]. The [[Ciguayos]] appear to have predated the agricultural [[Taino]] who inhabited much of the island. The language appears to have been moribund at the time of Spanish contact, and within a century it was extinct.&lt;ref name="Granberry"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/4742096.pdf | title=Lenguas indígenas del caribe | author=Granberry, Julian | journal=Cuba Arqueológica | year=2012 | volume=5 | issue=1 | pages=5–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=11101 | title=Following Linguistic Trails across Half a Millennium Provides New Answers to Old Questions | author=Guitar, Lynne | journal=H-LatAm (H-Net) | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known of Ciguayo apart from it being a distinct language from Taino and neighboring [[Macorix language|Macorix]]. The only attested words are "gold", ''tuob'' (presumably {{IPA|[tuˈob]}} or {{IPA|[ˈtwob]}}) and a few place names such as ''Quizquella'' (presumably {{IPA|[kisˈkeja]}}). This makes it unlikely that the language is [[Arawakan language|Arawakan]] or [[Cariban languages|Cariban]],{{fix|text=or Warao?}} as languages of those families have simple V and CV [[syllable structure]]s even in loanwords that were originally CCV or CVC. Granberry &amp; Vescelius (2004) speculate that the closest parallels might be in the [[Tolan languages]] of Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Languages of the Pre-Columbian Antilles | publisher=University of Alabama Press | author=Granberry, Julian, &amp; Gary Vescelius | year=2004 | location=Tuscaloosa, AL | isbn=0-8173-5123-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17954">'''The Congress Spelling System''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Ejaan Kongres'') is a [[spelling reform]] of [[Malay alphabet|Malay Rumi Script]] introduced during the third Malay Congress held in [[Johor Bahru]] and [[Singapore]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohd Naim Daipi|1990|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Ariff Ahmad|1993|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asmah Omar|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main characteristics of the system are the use of symbols in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], going by the dictum of one symbol for one [[phoneme]], and the new proposition in the writing of [[diphthong]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asmah Omar|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The innovation was originally intended to replace the [[Za'aba Spelling System]] and ultimately to become a standard orthography in the Malay speaking world, but did not seem to gain acceptance in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asmah Omar|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Ariff Ahmad|1993|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was deemed impractical for use by the masses, and certain graphemes proposed by the system were not represented in the common typewriters at that time. Even then, certain groups, particularly those affiliated to the Literary Movement 1950 used the Congress graphemes for diphthongs in their own publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asmah Omar|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the 1950s, two different orthographies were used in the [[Malay world|Malay-speaking world]], namely the [[Republican Spelling System]] in [[Indonesia]] and [[Za'ba Spelling System]] in [[British Malaya]] and [[British Borneo|Borneo]]. The Za'ba Spelling System, introduced in 1933, was the improvised version of the earlier orthography introduced by the British scholar, R J Wilkinson. Similarly in Indonesia, the Republican Spelling System was introduced in 1947 to replace the older Dutch [[Van Ophuijsen Spelling System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asmah Omar|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third Malay congress held in [[Johor Bahru]] and [[Singapore]] from 16th to 21st September 1956, seek to unite these two different orthographies into a single system. The new orthography, was envisioned to be a better and practical system, which is simplified and using standardized methods of spelling, and emphasized more on the use of Malay phonology system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Ariff Ahmad|1993|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the congress, two proposal papers concerning the new orthography was presented by [[Asas '50|Literary Movement 1950]] and Malay Language Association of [[University of Malaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohd Naim Daipi|1990|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary Movement 1950, proposed a system already in use by their writers, largely based on Fajar Asia orthography introduced during [[Empire of Japan|Japanese occupation]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohd Naim Daipi|1990|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asmah Omar|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malay Language Association of [[University of Malaya]] generally rejects the use of [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s and vehemently promotes the Indonesian spelling elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohd Naim Daipi|1990|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; A consensus was reached during the congress, and the new orthography was later named ''Ejaan Kongres'' (the congress spelling').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohd Naim Daipi|1990|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Ariff Ahmad|1993|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1957, the Congress Spelling System was published for the first time by [[Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka]] in its language leaflet, DBP bilangan (1), with the title ''Kaedah Baharu Ejaan Rumi Bahasa Melayu (menurut keputusan Kongres Bahasa dan Persuratan Melayu III)'' ([[Malay language|Malay]] for 'New Methods of Rumi Spelling of Malay Language (based on the decision of Congress of Malay language and letters III)').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Ariff Ahmad|1993|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The Congress Spelling System did not seem to gain acceptance of people in general. The reason was that it was not practical for use by the ordinary people and certain graphemes proposed by the system were not represented in the typewriters. Even then, certain groups, particularly those affiliated to the Literary Movement 1950 used the Congress graphemes for diphthongs in their own publications. This group even reverted to the Wilkinson style of writing the vowels in closed final syllables which was, similar to the Republican style in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asmah Omar|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the Malay sections of publishing houses were mainly manned by members of the Literary Movement 1950 or their sympathisers, the Movement's style of spelling seemed to gain a widespread currency through published works. In the meantime, the schools and the government publications were still using the Za'aba or the school system of spelling. Hence, the public became confused as to which system to follow. Language usage outside the precincts of the school reflected a state of confusion in the minds of the people in the spelling of their language using the [[Malay alphabet|Rumi script]]. It was not unusual to find several systems used in a short passage in the print media not to mention in individual writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asmah Omar|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of confusion was ended with the introduction of [[New Rumi Spelling]] in 1972, that finally united the different orthographies of the Malay-speaking world into a single system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asmah Omar|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The system==
In the third Malay Congress of 1956, a total of 16 resolutions were made for [[orthography]], 2 resolutions for [[phonetics]], and a resolution for [[Jawi alphabet]]. The list of letters agreed upon for the new orthography are as below. It consists of 20 traditional Malay consonants [b], [c], [d], [g], [h], [j], [k], [l], [m], [n], [ŋ], [ñ], [p], [q], [r], [s], [ŝ], [t], [w], [y] and consonants [f], [q], [v], [x] for adopted sounds from foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Ariff Ahmad|1993|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Schwa]]===
The Congress Spelling also consists of 6 vowel sounds represented by 5 letters; [a],[e],[i],[o],[u], with [e] represents both [[/e/]] and [[/ə/]] sounds. It differed markedly with Za'aba Spelling that differentiates [[/e/]] and [[/ə/]] sounds with letters [e] and [ĕ] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Ariff Ahmad|1993|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asmah Omar|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The choice of [[Grapheme]]s===
The principle feature of the Congress Spelling is the representation of a [[phoneme]] with a [[grapheme]] or a single letter only. Thus, it rejects the use of [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s commonly found in the earlier orthographies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Ariff Ahmad|1993|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohd Naim Daipi|1990|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| ny || ñ || /ɲ/ || nyanyi || ñañi || to sing
|-
| sh || ŝ || /ʃ/ || shisha || ŝiŝa || [[Hookah|shisha]]
|}

===[[Diphthong]]s===
The Congress also made a new proposition in the writing of [[diphthong]]s. Whereas the Wilkinson and the Za'aba systems had [au], [ai] and [oi], the Congress system suggested [aw], [ay] and [oy].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Ariff Ahmad|1993|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohd Naim Daipi|1990|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-
| au || aw || /au̯/ || kalau || kalaw || if
|-
| ai || ay || /ai̯/ || tirai || tiray || curtain
|-
| oi || oy || /oi̯/ || boroi || boroy || pot-belly
|}

===[[Morpheme]]s===
A fixed rule for the choice of vowels for [[morpheme]]s in disyllabic words were established in the Congress Spelling. In the event that the morpheme of the first syllable is using vowels [e] and [o], morpheme bound to the final syllable must use vowels [e] and [o]. On the other hand, if morpheme of the first syllable is using vowels other than [e] and [o], the morpheme bound to the final syllable must use vowel [i] and [u].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Ariff Ahmad|1993|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Congress rule contradicts with the old Za'ba Spelling that concentrate more on the native Malay phonology rather than using the existing theories and linguistic techniques. In Za'aba Spelling, for any final syllable that ends with letters [k] or [h], the morpheme bound to it must use vowel [e] instead of [i], with the exceptions given to diphthong [ai]. Conversely, for any final syllable that ends with letters other than [k] or [h],the morpheme bound to it must use vowel [i] instead of [e], with exceptions given to first syllable using vowels [o] or [e], thus vowel [e] must be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohd Naim Daipi|1990|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonemes for [[Hamza]] and [[Ayin]]===
Malay written in [[Jawi script]] generally utilizes both Arabic letters ([[hamza|ء]]) and ([[ayin|ع]])، in addition to letter (ق), as [[glottal stop]]s which transliterated in the old Rumi orthographies with [[apostrophes]] ('). The Congress Spelling are in agreement that Rumi phonemes for both letters are similar. However, due to differing opinions among the participants, the Congress Spelling did not produce any resolution on the use of both phonemes, and opened the issue for public interpretations. The congress nevertheless, proposed four resolutions concerning hamza and ayin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Ariff Ahmad|1993|pp=56-57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. The phonemes shall not be represented by any grapheme when it become onset of first morpheme. For example, 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Jawi spelling !! Za'aba Spelling !! Congress Spelling !! Meaning
|-
| عادل||'adil || adil || fair
|-
| عالم||'alam || alam || nature
|-
| علماء||'ulama || ulama || scholar
|-
|}

2. The phonemes shall be represented by letter [k] only if it become [[Coda (linguistics)|coda]] of the last morpheme. Example as follows
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Jawi spelling !! Old Spelling !! Congress Spelling !! Meaning
|-
| تيدق|| tida' || tidak || no
|-
| أنق|| ana' || anak || child
|-
| دودوق|| dudo' || duduk || sit 
|-
|}

3. he phonemes shall be represented by either letter [k] or ['], if it become [[Coda (linguistics)|coda]] of the first morpheme. Example as follows

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Jawi spelling !! Congress Spelling !! Alternative Spelling !! Meaning
|-
| معلوم|| maklum || ma'lum || informed
|-
| موءمين|| mukmin || mu'min || believer
|-
|}

4. To avoid confusion, the apostrophe (') can be used to represent phoneme of glottal stops only if it become onset for non-first morpheme. Therefore, (مسئله) ([[Malay language|Malay]] [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]] for 'problem')  should be spelled as ''mas'alah'' in Rumi, not ''mas-alah'', ''masaalah'' or ''maskalah''.

===Letter H===
There are a total of four resolutions concerning letter [h] in the Congress Spelling System.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Ariff Ahmad|1993|pp=57-58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. If the /h/ sound become onset of the first syllable. It can be either maintained or removed.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Congress Spelling !! Alternative Spelling !! Meaning
|-
| hala|| ala || direction
|-
| hadap|| adap || facing
|-
| hulu|| ulu || upstream
|-
| hujan|| ujan || rain
|-
|}

2. If the /h/ is in between two similar vowels, the letter [h] must be maintained
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Congress Spelling !! Wrong Spelling !! Meaning
|-
| bahan|| baan || ingredient
|-
| leher|| leer || neck
|-
| bohoŋ|| booŋ || to lie
|-
|}

However, if the /h/ is in between two different vowels, the letter [h] can be either removed or maintained
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Congress Spelling !! Alternative Spelling !! Meaning
|-
| mahu|| mau || want
|-
| jahit|| jait || to sew
|-
| tahun|| taun || year
|-
|}

3. For similar sounding words that carry different meaning, both rules of maintaining and removing [h] are applied to differentiate their meaning.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Congress Spelling !! Meaning !! Congress Spelling !! Meaning
|-
| tahu|| [[tofu]] || tau || to know
|-
| bahu|| shoulder || bau || smell
|-
| harus|| should || arus || current
|-
|}

4. For letter [h] that become coda for morpheme, it must be maintained
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Congress Spelling !! Wrong Spelling !! Meaning
|-
| lemah|| lema || weak
|-
| tanah|| tana || soil
|-
| boleh|| bole || can
|-
| teduh|| tedu || to shelter
|-
| rahsia|| rasia || secret
|-
| mahkota|| makota || crown
|-
|}
Exceptions are given to Malay words that derived from foreign words. Therefore, ''Sekolah'' ('school') can also be spelled as ''Sekola'' and ''Eropah'' ('Europe') can also be spelled as ''Eropa''.

===[[Hyphens]]===
The use of hyphens commonly found in the old spellings, is discontinued in the Congress Spelling except in three conditions; reduplication, compound words and for line break. Malay affixes like di-, ke-, ter-, -kan, -an, and particles like –lah, -tah, -kah, dan –nya, are no longer hyphenated, but combined with the words.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Ariff Ahmad|1993|pp=58-59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Za'aba Spelling !! Congress Spelling !! Meaning
|-
| bila-kah|| bilakah || when
|-
| apa-lah|| apalah || what a
|-
|}
The hyphen remains in use between components of reduplicated words, like menari-nari ('keeps on dancing') and rumah-rumah ('houses'). However, for compound words like ''setia-usaha'' ('secretary'), ''jawatan-kuasa'' ('committee'), ''kerja-sama'' ('teamwork'), exceptions are given to compound words that already firmly embedded like ''matahari'' ('sun'), ''purbakala'' ('ancient'), and ''tanggungjawab'' ('responsibility').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Ariff Ahmad|1993|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption of Indonesian Spelling===
The Congress Spelling vehemently promoted the Indonesian [[Republican Spelling System]], which in certain words, are deemed in harmony with the original pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Ariff Ahmad|1993|pp=52 &amp; 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-
| ayer || air || water
|-
| kerana || karena || because
|-
| wang || uang || money
|-
| erti || arti || meaning

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1915">'''David Caro''' (ca. 1782, Fordon, [[Grand Duchy of Posen]]&amp;mdash;25 December 1839, [[Poznań|Posen]]) was a Prussian pedagogue. He belonged to the school of the [[Me'assefim]], and devoted his great literary talents to the enlightenment of his brethren, to the reform of Judaism, and to the cultivation of the Hebrew language. Under the pseudonym "Amittai ben Abida Achitzedeq" he defended the Hamburg Reform Temple in ''Berit Emit'' (Covenant of Truth, Dessau,&lt;ref&gt;"Constantinople" on title page&lt;/ref&gt; 1820), the first part of which, ''Berit Elohim'' (Covenant of God), was published by the author himself, and the second part, ''Berit ha-Kehunnah'' (Covenant of the Priesthood), or ''Tekunnat ha-Rabbanim'' (Character of the Rabbis), by [[Judah Löb Mieses]] of [[Lemberg]]. A new edition of the second part, with additions by Mieses, was published at Lemberg in 1879.

Many of Caro's articles, essays, and poems appeared in ''Ha-Meassef'' and in the ''Bikkure ha-'Ittim''. He was a prolific writer, and left a number of manuscripts on literary, lexicographical, bibliographical, and pedagogical subjects. Among his unedited works are a Hebrew translation of [[Zunz]]'s ''Gottesdienstliche Vorträge der Juden'', with notes and additions; a Hebrew translation of the same author's biography of [[Rashi]], with notes; and biographies of celebrated rabbis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4124">The '''ecology of contexts''' is a term used in many disciplines and refers to the dynamic interplay of contexts and demands that constrain and define an entity.

==Environmental ecology==
An [[agroecosystem]] exists amid contexts including [[climate]], [[soil]], [[Plant breeding|plant genetics]], [[Agricultural policy|government policies]], and the personal beliefs and predilections of the agriculturalist. Not only are these contexts too numerous to list in their entirety for any agroecosystem, but their interactions are so complex it is impossible to perfectly characterize a system, let alone predict the effect a given perturbation will have on the whole.&lt;ref name=Bland&amp;Bell/&gt; At the same time, all of these contexts are dynamic, albeit at wildly diverging time scales, so the ecology of contexts for an agroecosystem is fundamentally mutable. An awareness of the ecology of contexts is helpful for [[agroecologists]], as the nearly [[axiomatic]] acceptance dynamic, and thereby unperfectable, nature of agroecosystems precludes the often damaging notion of a best or ideal approach to agroecosystem management as well as an awareness of the complexity of the response that can result from any perturbation of the system.

This concept of the ecology of contexts provides a useful [[Epistemology|epistemological]] device for understanding [[agroecosystems]].&lt;ref name=Bland&amp;Bell&gt;
Bland, W.L. and Bell, M.M., (2007) A holon approach to agroecology International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability 5(4), 280-294. {{cite web|url=http://www.earthscanjournals.com/ijas/005/ijas0050280%2Ehtm |accessdate=December 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202180517/http://www.earthscanjournals.com/ijas/005/ijas0050280.htm |archivedate=February 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human ecology==
In [[Child development#Ecological systems theory|child development]], for instance, it can refer to the nested scales at which influences on children reside, from the individual (e.g. age) to the broadest elements, like government policies or cultural attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Catherine L. IT FEELS LIKE IT’S THE END OF THE WORLD: Cape Town’s youth talk about gangs and community violence. Institute of Security Studies Monograph No 136, July 2007 {{cite web|url=http://www.iss.co.za/index%2Ephp?link_id%3D3%26slink_id%3D4835%26link_type%3D12%26slink_type%3D12%26tmpl_id%3D3 |accessdate=December 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726015116/http://www.iss.co.za/index.php?link_id=3&amp;slink_id=4835&amp;link_type=12&amp;slink_type=12&amp;tmpl_id=3 |archivedate=July 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[computer science]] is the concept of ecology of context-aware computing, where a device's operation is tempered by information the device itself has about how the environment will affect its functioning and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, Peter. Mobile Devices and Mobile Data—Issues of Identity and Reference. HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION, 2001, Volume 16, pp. 323–336. 2001, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[music therapy]], Trygve Aasgaard dealt with the reciprocity of an ecology of contexts, seeing the role of music in therapy as responsive to cultural and other contexts, while at the same time forming part of the environmental context.&lt;ref&gt;in Stige, Brynulf. The Relentless Roots of Community Music Therapy. Voices Vol 2(3), November 1, 2002. {{cite web|url=http://www.voices.no/mainissues/Voices2%283%29Stige%2Ehtml |accessdate=December 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010143731/http://www.voices.no/mainissues//Voices2(3)stige.html |archivedate=October 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This dual relationship of an entity in an ecology of contexts underscores the ecological analogy, with its emphasis on [[Holon (philosophy)|holonic]] interactions.

The '''forecastle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|oʊ|k|s|əl}} {{respell|FOHK|səl}}; abbreviated '''fo'c'sle''' or '''fo'c's'le''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/forecastle?q=focsle Oxford] dictionary search, retrieved 2013-08-22, gives "fo'c'sle"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/focsle?showCookiePolicy=true Collins] dictionary search, retrieved 2013-08-22, gives "fo'c's'le or fo'c'sle"&lt;/ref&gt; is the upper [[deck (ship)|deck]] of a [[sailing ship]] forward of the [[foremast]], or the forward part of a ship with the sailors' living quarters. Related to the latter meaning is the phrase "[[Wiktionary:before the mast|before the mast]]" which denotes anything related to ordinary sailors, as opposed to a ship's officers.

==History and design==
[[File:QE2 bow.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The forecastle of [[Queen Elizabeth 2|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth 2'']]]]
In [[medieval]] shipbuilding, a ship of war was usually equipped with a tall, multi-deck [[castle]]-like structure in the [[bow (ship)|bow]] of the ship. It served as a platform for archers to shoot down on enemy ships, or as a defensive stronghold if the ship were boarded.  A similar but usually much larger structure, called the [[aftcastle]], was at the aft end of the ship, often stretching all the way from the main [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] to the [[stern]]. 

Having such tall upper works on the ship was detrimental to sailing performance. As [[cannons]] were introduced and gunfire replaced boarding as the primary means of naval combat during the 16th century, the medieval forecastle was no longer needed, and later ships such as the [[galleon]] had only a low, one-deck high forecastle. Sailors stationed on the forecastle, or "forecastle men," were responsible for handling the [[headsails]] and the anchors. In the Royal Navy of the 17th and 18th centuries, these roles were reserved for older seamen who lacked the agility to go aloft or take other more strenuous duties aboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodger|first=N.A.M.|title=The Wooden World: An Anatomy of the Georgian Navy|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1986|location=Annapolis, Maryland|page=27|isbn=0870219871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:lifeboat.bows.17-31.arp.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Foredeck of [[Severn-class lifeboat]] No. 17-31 at [[quay]] in [[Poole Harbour]], [[Dorset]], [[England]].]]
By the end of the 19th century, raised forecastle had become a typical feature on warships again, in an attempt to keep forward gun positions from getting unacceptably wet on heavy seas. In addition the forecastle may provide additional crew's quarters as in the past, and may contain essential machinery such as the [[anchor windlass]]. A disadvantage of such a design is the structural weakness at the forecastle 'break' (the rear end of the forecastle with the main deck behind and below) relative to a [[flush deck]] structure.

Some sailing ships and many modern non-sail ships have no forecastle as such at all but the name is still used to indicate the foremost part of the upper deck &amp;ndash; although often called the ''foredeck'' &amp;ndash; and for any crews quarters in the bow of the ship, even if below the main deck.

In the [[Hollywood]] [[movie industry]], a '''four-quadrant movie''' is one which appeals to all four major demographic "quadrants" of the moviegoing audience: both male and female, and both over- and under-25s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15386597|title=Why did The Help clean up at the US box office?|author=Neil Smith|publisher=BBC News|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films are generally aimed at at least two such quadrants, and most [[Tent-pole (entertainment)|tent-pole films]] are four-quadrant movies. A film's budget is often correlated to the number of quadrants the film is expected to reach, and movies are rarely produced if not focused on at least two quadrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friend|first1=Tad|title=The Cobra|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/01/19/the-cobra?currentPage=all|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=19 January 2009|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although four-quadrant movies are generally [[family-friendly]], this is not a requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasi|first1=Rollo|title=Film Term of the Week: Four-quadrant Movie|url=http://film-book.com/film-term-of-the-week-four-quadrant-movie/|website=Filmbook|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other genres meeting this may be romantic (such as ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Meet the Parents]]'') or horror films (''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''), or be crowd-pleasing in nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Forest F.|title=How to write a four-quadrant story, or using movie marketing logic on a novel|url=http://ffwhite.dreamwidth.org/9438.html|website=Dreamwidth|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Great Quadrant Movies Screenwriters Can Learn From|url=http://screenplayscripts.com/10-great-quadrant-movies/|website=Industrial Scripts|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as high-profile action films or adaptations of popular novels.

'''Greek''' ([[Modern Greek]]: {{lang|el|ελληνικά}} {{IPA-el|eliniˈka|}}, ''elliniká'', "Greek", {{lang|el|ελληνική γλώσσα}} {{IPA-el|eliniˈci ˈɣlosa||Elliniki Glossa.ogg}}, ''ellinikí glóssa'', "Greek language") is an independent branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family of languages, native to [[Greece]] and other parts of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] and the [[Black Sea]]. It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language, spanning 34 centuries (3,400 years) of written records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greek language|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|accessdate=29 April 2014|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/244595/Greek-language}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its writing system has been the [[Greek alphabet]] for the major part of its history; other systems, such as [[Linear B]] and the [[Cypriot syllabary]], were used previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/59712402|title=A history of the Greek language : from its origins to the present|last=1922-|first=Adrados, Francisco Rodríguez,|date=2005|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004128354|location=Leiden|oclc=59712402}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alphabet arose from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician script]] and was in turn the basis of the [[Latin script|Latin]], [[Cyrillic]], [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]], [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]], [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]] and many other writing systems.

The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the [[Western world]] and [[Christianity]]; the canon of [[ancient Greek literature]] includes works in the [[Western literature|Western canon]] such as the epic poems ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''. Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science, especially astronomy, mathematics and logic, and [[Western philosophy]], such as the [[Platonic dialogue]]s and the works of [[Aristotle]], are composed; the [[New Testament]] of the Christian [[Bible]] was written in [[Koiné Greek]]. Together with the [[Latin language|Latin]] texts and traditions of the [[Roman world]], the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of [[Classics]].

During [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], Greek was a widely spoken [[lingua franca]] in the Mediterranean world, [[West Asia]] and many places beyond. It would eventually become the official parlance of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and develop into [[Medieval Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A study of the preservation of the classical tradition in the education, language, and literature of the Byzantine Empire|last=Manuel|first=Germaine Catherine|publisher=|year=1989|isbn=|location=HVD ALEPH|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its [[Modern Greek|modern form]], Greek is the official language in two countries, Greece and Cyprus, a recognised minority language in seven other countries, and is one of the 24 [[Languages of the European Union#Official EU languages|official languages of the European Union]]. The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Albania, Turkey, and the [[Greek diaspora]].

Greek [[Root (linguistics)|root]]s are often used to coin new words for other languages; Greek and [[Latin]] are the predominant sources of [[international scientific vocabulary]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of Greek}}

Greek has been spoken in the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]] since around the 3rd millennium BC,&lt;ref name=BVG&gt;{{harvnb|Renfrew|2003|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Georgiev|1981|p=192}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|Atkinson|2003|pp=437–438}}; {{harvnb|Atkinson|Gray|2006|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest written evidence is a [[Linear B]] [[clay tablet]] found in [[Messenia]] that dates to between 1450 and 1350 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Tablet Found: Oldest Readable Writing in Europe|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|date=30 March 2011|accessdate=22 November 2013|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/03/110330-oldest-writing-europe-tablet-greece-science-mycenae-greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; making Greek the world's [[List of languages by first written accounts|oldest recorded]] [[Modern language|living language]]. Among the Indo-European languages, its date of earliest written attestation is matched only by the now-extinct [[Anatolian languages]].

===Periods===
[[File:Proto Greek Area reconstruction.png|thumb|[[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]]-speaking area according to linguist [[Vladimir I. Georgiev]]]]

The Greek language is conventionally divided into the following periods:
* '''[[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]]''': the unrecorded but assumed last ancestor of all known varieties of Greek. The unity of Proto-Greek would have ended as Hellenic migrants entered the [[Geography of Greece|Greek peninsula]] sometime in the [[Neolithic]] era or the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;A comprehensive overview in J.T. Hooker's ''Mycenaean Greece'' ({{harvnb|Hooker|1976|loc=Chapter 2: "Before the Mycenaean Age", pp. 11–33 and passim}}); for a different hypothesis excluding massive migrations and favoring an autochthonous scenario, see Colin Renfrew's "Problems in the General Correlation of Archaeological and Linguistic Strata in Prehistoric Greece: The Model of Autochthonous Origin" ({{harvnb|Renfrew|1973|pp=263–276, especially p. 267}}) in ''Bronze Age Migrations'' by R.A. Crossland and A. Birchall, eds. (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Mycenaean Greek]]''': the language of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilisation]]. It is recorded in the [[Linear B]] script on tablets dating from the 15th century BC onwards.
* '''[[Ancient Greek]]''': in its various [[Ancient Greek dialects|dialects]], the language of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek civilisation]]. It was widely known throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. Ancient Greek fell into disuse in western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], but remained officially in use in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] world and was reintroduced to the rest of Europe with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and [[Greeks|Greek]] migration to western Europe.
* '''[[Koine Greek]]''': The fusion of [[Ionian Greek|Ionian]] with [[Attic Greek|Attic]], the dialect of [[Classical Athens|Athens]], began the process that resulted in the creation of the first common Greek dialect, which became a [[lingua franca]] across the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] and [[Near East]]. Koine Greek can be initially traced within the armies and conquered territories of [[Alexander the Great]] and after the Hellenistic colonisation of the known world, it was spoken from [[Egypt]] to the fringes of [[India]]. After the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] conquest of Greece, an unofficial [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] of Greek and [[Latin]] was established in the city of [[Rome]] and Koine Greek became a first or second language in the [[Roman Empire]]. The origin of [[Christianity]] can also be traced through Koine Greek, because the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] used this form of the language to spread Christianity. It is also known as '''Hellenistic Greek''', '''New Testament Greek''', and sometimes '''Biblical Greek''' because it was the original language of the [[New Testament]] and the [[Old Testament]] was translated into the same language via the [[Septuagint]].

[[Cappadocian Greek]] in green, with green dots indicating individual Cappadocian Greek villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|Halliday|1916}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* '''[[Medieval Greek]]''', also known as '''Byzantine Greek''': the continuation of Koine Greek, up to the demise of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the 15th century. ''Medieval Greek'' is a cover phrase for a whole continuum of different speech and writing styles, ranging from vernacular continuations of spoken Koine that were already approaching [[Modern Greek]] in many respects, to highly learned forms imitating classical Attic. Much of the written Greek that was used as the official language of the Byzantine Empire was an eclectic middle-ground variety based on the tradition of written Koine.
* '''[[Modern Greek]]''' (Neo-Hellenic):&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ell Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; Stemming from Medieval Greek, Modern Greek usages can be traced in the Byzantine period, as early as the 11th century. It is the language used by the modern Greeks, and, apart from Standard Modern Greek, there are several [[Varieties of Modern Greek|dialects]] of it.

===Diglossia===
{{Main article|Greek language question}}

In the modern era, the Greek language entered a state of [[diglossia]]: the coexistence of vernacular and archaizing written forms of the language. What came to be known as the [[Greek language question]] was a polarization between two competing varieties of [[Modern Greek]]: [[Demotic Greek|Dimotiki]], the vernacular form of Modern Greek proper, and [[Katharevousa]], meaning 'purified', a compromise between Dimotiki and [[Ancient Greek]], which was developed in the early 19th century and was used for literary and official purposes in the newly formed Greek state. In 1976, Dimotiki was declared the official language of Greece, having incorporated features of Katharevousa and giving birth to [[Varieties of Modern Greek#Standard Modern Greek|Standard Modern Greek]], which is used today for all official purposes and in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11134463|title=The modern Greek language : a descriptive analysis of standard modern Greek|last=Peter.|first=Mackridge,|date=1985|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198157700|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire]|oclc=11134463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical unity===
[[File:Modern Greek dialects en.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The distribution of major modern Greek dialect areas]]

The historical unity and continuing identity between the various stages of the Greek language is often emphasised. Although Greek has undergone morphological and phonological changes comparable to those seen in other languages, never since classical antiquity has its cultural, literary, and orthographic tradition been interrupted to the extent that one can speak of a new language emerging. Greek speakers today still tend to regard literary works of ancient Greek as part of their own rather than a foreign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browning|1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often stated that the historical changes have been relatively slight compared with some other languages. According to one estimation, "[[Homeric Greek]] is probably closer to [[Demotic Greek|demotic]] than 12-century [[Middle English]] is to [[Modern English|modern spoken English]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexiou|1982|pp=156–192}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Greek has seen fewer changes in 2700 years, than English has in 900 years).

==Geographic distribution==
{{Further information|Greeks|Greek diaspora}} 
[[File:A27 Motorway, Greece - Section Kozani-Ptolemaida - Kozani-North interchange (A2) - 02.jpg|thumb|Greek language road sign, A27 Motorway, Greece]]
[[File:Greek USC2000 PHS.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|Spread of Greek in the United States]]

Greek is spoken by at least 13 million people, mainly in [[Greece]], [[Albania]] and [[Cyprus]], but also worldwide by the large [[Greek diaspora]]. There are traditional Greek-speaking settlements and regions in the neighbouring countries of [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Turkey]], as well as in several countries in the [[Black Sea]] area, such as [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], [[Romania]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], and [[Azerbaijan]], and around the [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Southern Italy]], [[Syria]], [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]] and ancient coastal towns along the [[Levant]]. Particularly in Albania due to the [[Albanian immigrants in Greece|immigration wave towards Greece]] today a significant percentage of the population can speak the Greek language, or at least has some basic knowledge of it. The language is also spoken by Greek emigrant communities in many countries in [[Western Europe]], especially the United Kingdom and Germany, Canada, the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[South Africa]] and others.

===Official status===
Greek is the [[official language]] of Greece, where it is spoken by almost the entire population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gr.html|title=Greece|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the official language of Cyprus (nominally alongside [[Turkish language|Turkish]]).&lt;ref name=GreekCyprus&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of Cyprus, App. D., Part 1, Art. 3 |deadurl=yes |url=http://www.cyprus.gov.cy/portal/portal.nsf/0/302578ad62e1ea3ac2256fd5003b61d4?OpenDocument&amp;ExpandSection=3&amp;Click=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407035710/http://www.cyprus.gov.cy/portal/portal.nsf/0/302578ad62e1ea3ac2256fd5003b61d4?OpenDocument&amp;ExpandSection=3&amp;Click=|archivedate=7 April 2012}} states that ''The official languages of the Republic are Greek and Turkish''. However, the official status of Turkish is only nominal in the Greek-dominated Republic of Cyprus; in practice, outside Turkish-dominated [[Northern Cyprus]], Turkish is little used; see A. Arvaniti (2006): Erasure as a Means of Maintaining Diglossia in Cyprus, ''San Diego Linguistics Papers'' 2: pp. 25–38, page 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the membership of Greece and Cyprus in the European Union, Greek is one of the organization's [[languages of the European Union#Official EU languages|24 official languages]].&lt;ref name="European Union"&gt;{{cite web|title=The EU at a Glance – Languages in the EU|url=http://europa.eu/abc/european_countries/languages/index_en.htm|work=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]|publisher=[[European Union]]|accessdate=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Greek is officially recognised as a [[minority language]] in parts of [[Italy]] and official in [[Dropull]] and [[Himara]] ([[Albania]]) and as a minority language all over [[Albania]],&lt;ref name=HumanRights&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/grk.htm|title=Greek|publisher=[[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]]|date=|accessdate=8 December 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118212657/http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/grk.htm|archivedate=18 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Armenia]], [[Romania]], and [[Ukraine]] as a regional or minority language in the framework of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].&lt;ref name=CouncilofEurope&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ListeDeclarations.asp?NT=148&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=23/01/05&amp;CL=ENG&amp;VL=1 |title=List of Declarations Made with Respect to Treaty No. 148|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]|date=|accessdate=8 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greeks are also a [[Greeks in Hungary|recognised ethnic minority]] in [[Hungary]].

==Characteristics==
{{See also|Ancient Greek grammar|Koine Greek grammar|Modern Greek grammar}}

The [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]] and [[vocabulary]] of the language show both conservative and innovative tendencies across the entire attestation of the language from the ancient to the modern period. The division into conventional periods is, as with all such periodisations, relatively arbitrary, especially because at all periods, Ancient Greek has enjoyed high prestige, and the literate borrowed heavily from it.

===Phonology===
{{See also|Modern Greek phonology}}

[[File:Seferisrede.ogg|thumb|Spoken [[Modern Greek]]]]

Across its history, the syllabic structure of Greek has varied little: Greek shows a mixed syllable structure, permitting complex syllabic onsets but very restricted codas. It has only oral vowels and a fairly stable set of consonantal contrasts. The main phonological changes occurred during the Hellenistic and Roman period (see [[Koine Greek phonology]] for details):
* replacement of the [[pitch accent]] with a [[stress (linguistics)|stress accent]].
* simplification of the system of [[vowel]]s and [[diphthong]]s: loss of vowel length distinction, monophthongisation of most diphthongs and several steps in a [[chain shift]] of vowels towards /i/ ([[iotacism]]).
* development of the [[voicelessness|voiceless]] [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] [[stop consonant|plosive]]s {{IPA|/pʰ/}} and {{IPA|/tʰ/}} to the voiceless [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/θ/}}, respectively; the similar development of {{IPA|/kʰ/}} to {{IPA|/x/}} may have taken place later (the phonological changes are not reflected in the orthography, and both earlier and later phonemes are written with [[Phi (letter)|φ]], [[Theta|θ]], and [[Chi (letter)|χ]]).
* development of the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] plosives {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} to their voiced fricative counterparts {{IPA|/β/}} (later /v/), {{IPA|/ð/}}, and {{IPA|/ɣ/}}.

===Morphology===
In all its stages, the morphology of Greek shows an extensive set of productive derivational affixes, a limited but productive system of compounding&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ralli|2001|pp=164–203}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a rich inflectional system. Although its morphological categories have been fairly stable over time, morphological changes are present throughout, particularly in the nominal and verbal systems. The major change in the nominal morphology since the classical stage was the disuse of the dative case (its functions being largely taken over by the genitive). The verbal system has lost the infinitive, the synthetically-formed future and perfect tenses and the optative mood. Many have been replaced by [[periphrastic]] (analytical) forms.

====Nouns and adjectives====
Pronouns show distinctions in [[grammatical person|person]] (1st, 2nd, and 3rd), [[grammatical number|number]] (singular, dual, and plural in the ancient language; singular and plural alone in later stages), and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and decline for [[grammatical case|case]] (from six cases in the earliest forms attested to four in the modern language).&lt;ref&gt;The four cases that are found in all stages of Greek are the nominative, genitive, accusative and vocative. The dative/locative of Ancient Greek disappeared in the late Hellenistic period, and the instrumental case of Mycenaean Greek disappeared in the Archaic period.&lt;/ref&gt; Nouns, articles and adjectives show all the distinctions except for person. Both attributive and predicative adjectives agree with the noun.

====Verbs====
The inflectional categories of the Greek verb have likewise remained largely the same over the course of the language's history but with significant changes in the number of distinctions within each category and their morphological expression. Greek verbs have [[synthetic language|synthetic]] inflectional forms for:

{|class="wikitable"
!
!Ancient Greek

|-
! Person
| first, second and third || also [[T–V distinction|second person formal]]

|-
! [[Grammatical mood|mood]]
| [[realis mood|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[optative mood|optative]]

Most Greek linguists advocate abandoning the traditional terminology (Anna Roussou and Tasos Tsangalidis 2009, in ''Meletes gia tin Elliniki Glossa'', Thessaloniki, Anastasia Giannakidou 2009 "Temporal semantics and polarity: The dependency of the subjunctive revisited", Lingua); see [[Modern Greek grammar#The verb|Modern Greek grammar]] for explanation.&lt;/ref&gt; and imperative (other modal functions are expressed by periphrastic constructions)
|-
! Voice
| [[active voice|active]], [[middle voice|middle]], and [[passive voice|passive]]
| active and [[mediopassive voice|medio-passive]]
|}

===Syntax===
Many aspects of the [[syntax]] of Greek have remained constant: verbs agree with their subject only, the use of the surviving cases is largely intact (nominative for subjects and predicates, accusative for objects of most verbs and many prepositions, genitive for possessors), articles precede nouns, adpositions are largely prepositional, relative clauses follow the noun they modify and relative pronouns are clause-initial. However, the morphological changes also have their counterparts in the syntax, and there are also significant differences between the syntax of the ancient and that of the [[Modern Greek grammar|modern form of the language]]. Ancient Greek made great use of participial constructions and of constructions involving the infinitive, and the modern variety lacks the infinitive entirely (instead having a raft of new periphrastic constructions) and uses participles more restrictively. The loss of the dative led to a rise of prepositional indirect objects (and the use of the genitive to directly mark these as well). Ancient Greek tended to be verb-final, but neutral word order in the modern language is VSO or SVO.

===Vocabulary===
Modern Greek inherits most of its vocabulary from Ancient Greek, which in turn is an Indo-European language, but also includes a number of [[Pre-Greek substrate|borrowings]] from the languages of the populations that inhabited Greece before the arrival of Proto-Greeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; some documented in [[Linear B|Mycenaean texts]]; they include a large number of Greek [[toponym]]s. The form and meaning of many words has evolved. [[Loanword]]s (words of foreign origin) have entered the language, mainly from [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Venetian language#History|Venetian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. During the older periods of Greek, loanwords into Greek acquired Greek inflections, thus leaving only a foreign root word. Modern borrowings (from the 20th century on), especially from [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]], are typically not inflected; other modern borrowings are derived from [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]/[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]) and [[Eastern Romance languages]] ([[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]]).

===Greek loanwords in other languages===
{{details|Greek and Latin roots in English}}

Greek words have been widely borrowed into other languages, including English: ''[[mathematics]]'', ''[[physics]]'', ''[[astronomy]]'', ''[[democracy]]'', ''[[philosophy]]'', ''[[:wikt:athletics|athletics]], [[theatre]], [[rhetoric]]'', ''[[baptism]]'', ''[[:wikt:evangelist|evangelist]]'', etc. Moreover, Greek words and [[morpheme|word elements]] continue to be productive as a basis for coinages: ''[[anthropology]]'', ''[[photography]]'', ''[[telephony]]'', ''[[isomer]]'', ''[[biomechanics]]'', ''[[cinematography]]'', etc. and form, with [[Scientific Latin|Latin words]], the [[International scientific vocabulary|foundation of international scientific and technical vocabulary]] like all words ending with ''–logy'' ("discourse"). There are many [[English words of Greek origin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scheler|1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Greek is an independent branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]]. The ancient language most closely related to it may be [[Ancient Macedonian language|ancient Macedonian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamp|2013|pp=8–10, 13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which many scholars suggest may have been a [[dialect]] of Greek itself, but it is so poorly attested that it is difficult to conclude anything about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Babiniotis|1992|pp=29–40}}; {{harvnb|Dosuna|2012|pp=65–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Independently of the Macedonian question, some scholars have grouped Greek into [[Graeco-Phrygian]], as Greek and the extinct [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] share features that are not found in other Indo-European languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Glottolog|grae1234|Graeco-Phrygian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among living languages, some Indo-Europeanists suggest that Greek may be most closely related to [[Armenian language|Armenian]] (see [[Graeco-Armenian]]) or the [[Indo-Iranian languages]] (see [[Graeco-Aryan]]), but little definitive evidence has been found for grouping the living branches of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renfrew|1990}}; {{harvnb|Gamkrelidze|Ivanov|1990|pp=110–116}}; {{harvnb|Renfrew|2003|pp=17–48}}; {{harvnb|Gray|Atkinson|2003|pp=435–439}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Albanian language|Albanian]] has also been considered somewhat related to Greek and [[Armenian language|Armenian]] by some linguists. If proven and recognised, the three languages would form a new Balkan sub-branch with other dead European languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holm|2008|pp=628–636}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing system==
{{Greek Alphabet}}
{{See also|Greek Braille}}

===Linear B===
{{Main article|Linear B}}

[[Linear B]], attested as early as the late 15th century BC, was the first script used to write Greek.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; It is basically a [[syllabary]], which was finally deciphered by [[Michael Ventris]] and [[John Chadwick]] in the 1950s (its precursor, [[Linear A]], has not been deciphered to this day and most likely encodes a non-Greek language).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7326206|title=Linear B : an introduction|last=T.|first=Hooker, J.|date=1980|publisher=Bristol Classical Press|isbn=9780906515693|location=Bristol|oclc=7326206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the Linear B texts, [[Mycenaean Greek language|Mycenaean Greek]], is the earliest known form of Greek.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Cypriot syllabary===
{{Main article|Cypriot syllabary}}
[[File:Cypriot syllabic inscription 600-500BC.jpg|thumb|Greek inscription in Cypriot syllabic script]]
Another similar system used to write the Greek language was the [[Cypriot syllabary]] (also a descendant of [[Linear A]] via the intermediate [[Cypro-Minoan syllabary]]), which is closely related to Linear B but uses somewhat different syllabic conventions to represent phoneme sequences. The Cypriot syllabary is attested in [[Cyprus]] from the 11th century BC until its gradual abandonment in the late Classical period, in favor of the standard Greek alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://academic.eb.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/levels/collegiate/article/Cypriot-syllabary/28419|title=HarvardKey Login|website=academic.eb.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek alphabet===
{{Main article|Greek alphabet|Greek orthography}}
[[File:Greek alphabet variants.png|thumb|Ancient epichoric variants of the Greek alphabet from [[Euboea]], [[Ionia]], [[Athens]], and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] comparing to modern Greek]]

Greek has been written in the Greek alphabet since approximately the 9th century BC. It was created by modifying the [[Phoenician alphabet]], with the innovation of adopting certain letters to represent the [[vowel]]s. The variant of the alphabet in use today is essentially the late [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] variant, introduced for writing classical [[Attic Greek|Attic]] in 403 BC. In classical Greek, as in classical Latin, only upper-case letters existed. The lower-case Greek letters were developed much later by medieval scribes to permit a faster, more convenient cursive writing style with the use of [[ink]] and [[quill]].

The Greek alphabet consists of 24 letters, each with an uppercase ([[capital letter|majuscule]]) and lowercase ([[lower case|minuscule]]) form. The letter [[sigma]] has an additional lowercase form (ς) used in the final position:

|}

====Diacritics====
{{main article|Greek diacritics}}

In addition to the letters, the Greek alphabet features a number of [[diacritic|diacritical signs]]: three different accent marks ([[acute accent|acute]], [[grave accent|grave]], and [[circumflex]]), originally denoting different shapes of [[pitch accent]] on the stressed vowel; the so-called breathing marks ([[rough breathing|rough]] and [[smooth breathing]]), originally used to signal presence or absence of word-initial /h/; and the [[trema (diacritic)|diaeresis]], used to mark full syllabic value of a vowel that would otherwise be read as part of a diphthong. These marks were introduced during the course of the Hellenistic period. Actual usage of the grave in [[penmanship|handwriting]] saw a rapid decline in favor of uniform usage of the acute during the late 20th century, and it has only been retained in [[typography]].

After the writing reform of 1982, most diacritics are no longer used. Since then, Greek has been written mostly in the simplified [[Greek diacritics|monotonic orthography]] (or monotonic system), which employs only the acute accent and the diaeresis. The traditional system, now called the polytonic orthography (or polytonic system), is still used internationally for the writing of [[Ancient Greek]].

====Punctuation====
In Greek, the question mark is written as the English semicolon, while the functions of the colon and semicolon are performed by a raised point (•), known as the ''[[Interpunct#Ano teleia|ano teleia]]'' ({{lang|grc|άνω τελεία}}). In Greek the [[comma]] also functions as a [[silent letter]] in a handful of Greek words, principally distinguishing {{lang|el|{{linktext|ό,τι}}}} (''ó,ti'', "whatever") from {{lang|el|{{linktext|ότι}}}} (''óti'', "that").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicolas |first=Nick |title=Greek Unicode Issues: Punctuation |year=2005 |url=http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html |accessdate=7 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120806003722/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html |archivedate=6 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Greek texts often used ''scriptio continua'' ('continuous writing'), which means that ancient authors and scribes would write word after word with no spaces or punctuation between words to differentiate or mark boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/881847972|title=The concise Oxford dictionary of linguistics|last=Hugoe),|first=Matthews, P. H. (Peter|others=Oxford University Press.|isbn=9780199675128|edition=Third|location=[Oxford]|oclc=881847972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Boustrophedon]], or bi-directional text, was also used in Ancient Greek.

===Latin alphabet===
Greek has occasionally been written in the [[Latin script]], especially in areas under [[Stato da Màr|Venetian rule]] or by [[Roman Catholicism in Greece|Greek Catholics]]. The term {{lang|grc-Latn|Frankolevantinika}} / {{lang|grc|Φραγκολεβαντίνικα}} applies when the Latin script is used to write Greek in the cultural ambit of Catholicism (because {{lang|grc-Latn|Frankos}} / {{lang|grc|Φράγκος}} is an older Greek term for West-European dating to when most of (Roman Catholic Christian) West Europe was under the control of the [[Frankish Empire]]). {{lang|grc-Latn|Frankochiotika}} / {{lang|grc|Φραγκοχιώτικα}} (meaning "Catholic Chiot") alludes to the significant presence of Catholic missionaries based on the island of [[Chios]]. Additionally the term [[Greeklish]] is often used when the Greek language is written in a Latin script in online communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Androutsopoulos|2009|pp=221–249}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3609">A "'''kotiryssä'''" (literally "'''Home Russian'''") was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] or [[Russia]]n contact person of a politician, bureaucrat, businessman or other important person in Finland. The term ''kotiryssä'' referred especially to Soviet spies stationed in Helsinki in the 1960s and 1970s who were designated by the Soviet government to gather information from specific persons in Finnish politics and government. As such information gathering techniques have arguably always been prevalent among spies, some Finns have argued that the ''kotiryssä'' system was a normal way to conduct diplomatic relations between two countries.&lt;ref&gt;Iltalehden Historia-liite "Suomettuminen," 2015, s. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; The dozens of KGB officers working out of the [[Tehtaankatu]] embassy of the Soviet Union is now well documented.&lt;ref name="ivanov"/&gt; The public did not know about the system until the book ''Tamminiemen pesänjakajat'' was published in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epa.oszk.hu/01300/01368/00004/pdf/04Nyys.pdf Political Cultures in Urho Kekkonen’s Finland and János Kádár’s Hungary] Heino Nyyssönen&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kotiryssä'' system was closely related to [[Finlandization]].

In 2015 ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' wrote that the Home Russian practise had all but ceased to exist. The Russian diplomatic corps in Helsinki no longer maintains contacts with the Finnish politicians and journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Minne katosivat kotiryssät? |trans-title=‘Where did the Home Russians disappear?’ | author = | first = | last = | url = http://www.hs.fi/sunnuntai/a1446176885002 | format = | agency = | newspaper = ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' | publisher = [[Sanoma]] | location = [[Helsinki]] | id = | date = 2015-10-31 | page = C 13 | pages = | at = | accessdate = 2015-11-12 | language = | ref = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judaeo-Spanish Wikipedia''' or '''Ladino Wikipedia''' is the [[Judaeo-Spanish]]-language version of [[Wikipedia]]. It was approved on December 21, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[[:m:Requests for new languages/Wikipedia Ladino]]&lt;/ref&gt; but its earliest articles date to August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[[:lad:Especial:HojasViejas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
As of February 28, 2018 the Judaeo-Spanish Wikipedia had 4,655 articles. There were 14,015 registered users (including bots); 23 were active at that time, including 4 administrators.&lt;ref&gt;[[:m:List of Wikipedias]], consulted February 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Judaeo-Spanish was historically written in Hebrew script, today it is often written in Latin script. Judaeo-Spanish Wikipedia has content in both scripts, with the great majority of content in Latin script. This Latin script content reflects several different orthographic conventions that are variously used for Judaeo-Spanish.

&lt;!--== Milestones ==
The Yiddish Wikipedia reached 6000 articles on March 8, 2009. The 6000th article is [[:yi:יהושע העשיל תאומים-פרענקל (ב)|יהושע העשיל תאומים-פרענקל]], a rabbi. The 7000th article is [[:yi:חנינא סגן הכהנים|חנינא סגן הכהנים]], a page about the [[Tannaim|tanna]] [[Hanina Segan ha-Kohanim]] created on December 24, 2009.--&gt;

==Point of view==
Judeo-Spanish is the historical language of the [[Sephardi Jews]], and the largest concentration of its speakers is in [[Israel]]. Accordingly, much of the content of this encyclopedia—especially content not found in other Wikipedia projects—focuses on Sephardi Jewish culture and personalities, and on places and institutions of Israel.

'''Kanuri''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|n|uː|r|i}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[dialect continuum]] spoken by some four million people, as of 1987, in [[Nigeria]], [[Niger]], [[Chad]] and [[Cameroon]], as well as small minorities in southern [[Libya]] and by a diaspora in [[Sudan]]. At the turn of the 21st century, its two main dialects, Manga Kanuri and Yerwa Kanuri (also called Beriberi, which its speakers consider to be pejorative), were spoken by 5,700,000 people in [[Central Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kanuri-language&lt;/ref&gt; It belongs to the Western [[Saharan languages|Saharan]] subphylum of [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]]. Kanuri is the language associated with the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]] and [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] empires which dominated the [[Lake Chad]] region for a thousand years.

The basic word order of Kanuri sentences is [[subject–object–verb]].  It is typologically unusual in simultaneously having [[postposition]]s and post-nominal modifiers – for example, "Bintu's pot" would be expressed as ''nje Bintu-be'', "pot Bintu-of".

Kanuri has three tones: high, low, and falling.  It has an extensive system of consonantal [[lenition]]; for example, ''sa-'' "they" + ''-buma'' "have eaten" → ''za-wuna'' "they have eaten".

Traditionally a local [[lingua franca]], its usage has declined in recent decades. Most first-language speakers speak [[Hausa language|Hausa]] or [[Arabic]] as a second language.

==Geographic distribution==
Kanuri is spoken mainly in lowlands of the [[Chad Basin]], with speakers in [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Sudan]].

==Varieties==
'' [[Ethnologue]]'' divides Kanuri into the following languages, while many linguists (e.g. Cyffer 1998) regard them as dialects of a single language. The first three are spoken by ethnic [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] and thought by them as dialects of their language.

*[[Central Kanuri]]
*[[Manga Kanuri]]
*[[Tumari Kanuri]]
*[[Kanembu language|Kanembu]]

==Written Kanuri==
Kanuri has been written using the [[Ajami script|Ajami]] [[Arabic script]], mainly in religious or court contexts, for at least four hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kanuri.net/related_projects2.php?aID=37 kanuri.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108031954/http://www.kanuri.net/related_projects2.php?aID=37 |date=2006-11-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, it is also sometimes written in a modified [[Latin script]].

===Alphabet===
A standardized romanized orthography (known as the Standard Kanuri Orthography in Nigeria) was developed  by the [[Kanuri Research Unit]] and the [[Kanuri Language Board]]. Its elaboration, based on the dialect of Maiduguri, was carried out by the Orthography Committee of the Kanuri Language Board, under the Chairmanship of Abba Sadiq, [[Vizier|Waziri]] of [[Bornu Empire|Borno]]. It was officially approved by the Kanuri Language Board in [[Maiduguri]], Nigeria, in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the Kanuri language''. Norbert Cyffer, John P. Hutchison, 1990. {{ISBN|90-6765-412-4}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[polyglotism|polyglot]] is a person with a command of many languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=polyglot &amp;#124; Collins Dictionary|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/polyglot|website=Collins Dictionary|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A polyglot may also be called a [[multilingualism|multilingual person]]; the label "multilingual" is used for communities as well as individual speakers.

[[Richard Hudson (linguist)|Richard Hudson]], professor emeritus of [[linguistics]] at [[University College London]], coined the term "hyperpolyglot" for "people 
who know dozens of languages well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudson |first=Richard |year=2008 |chapter=Word grammar, cognitive linguistics, and second language learning and teaching |title=Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics and Second Language Acquisition |editor=P. Robinson and N. Ellis |pages=89–113 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Polyglot of Bologna |url=http://publicdomainreview.org/2012/06/26/the-polyglot-of-bologna/ |last=Erard |first=Michael |date=June 2012 |publisher=Public Domain Review |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars apply the label to speakers of even more languages: twelve, sixteen, or in the most extreme cases, even fifty or more.&lt;ref name="Poly"&gt;{{cite web|last=Erard |first=Michael |title=How many languages is it possible for a person to speak? |url=http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/11/how_many_langua_1.html |publisher=The Five Minute Linguist |accessdate=11 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413031021/http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/11/how_many_langua_1.html |archivedate=13 April 2010 |date=3 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to judge which individuals are polyglots, as there is no uncontroversial definition for what it means to "master" a language, and because it is not always clear where to distinguish a [[dialect]] from a [[language]].  Being able to communicate in a language does not mean the person has "mastered" a language.  There are far fewer who have attained higher levels of multi-linguistic skill, and there is no basis for testing those levels, or at least those levels of ability have not been noted here.

This list consists of people who have been noted in news media, historical texts, or academic work as speaking five or more languages fluently. For general discussion of the phenomenon, including discussion of polyglot [[savant syndrome|savants]], see [[polyglotism]].

== Notable living polyglots ==

Canada's Global TV also brought out a piece on hyperpolyglots on their 16x9 show, entitled "Word Play",&lt;ref name="16x9onglobal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Word Play|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bppUq5IKZrM|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=7 May 2012|author=16x9onglobal|format=Video upload|date=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring Canadian polyglots Axel Van Hout, Alexandre Coutu, Steven Kaufmann, James Chang and Keith Swayne. Tim Doner (US) and Richard Simcott (UK) also appear in the programme to describe their experiences speaking multiple languages.

* [[Cleopatra VII]] (69–30 BC), the last ruling Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, could, according to the Roman biographer [[Plutarch]], speak nine languages and was the only member of her dynasty who could speak Egyptian as well as her native Greek.&lt;ref&gt;"she could pass from one language to another; so that there were few of the barbarian nations that she answered by an interpreter; to most of them she spoke herself, as to the Ethiopians, Troglodytes, Hebrews, Arabians, Syrians, Medes, Parthians, and many others, whose language she had learnt; which was all the more surprising because most of the kings, her predecessors, scarcely gave themselves the trouble to acquire the Egyptian tongue, and several of them quite abandoned the Macedonian." Plutarch, ''Antony'', 27.3–4&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[al-Farabi]] (872–950/951), a [[Tajik people|Persian]] [[polymath]] who mastered many languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rom Landau]], ''Islam and the Arabs'', [[Routledge]] (2013), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12328">'''Manfred George''' (October 22, 1893 – December 30, 1965), born Manfred Georg Cohn, later shortened to Manfred Georg, was a German [[journalist]], [[author]] and [[translator]]. He left Germany after the Nazis came to power, living in several different European countries and eventually emigrating penniless to the United States in 1939. He became the editor of ''[[Aufbau]]'', a periodical published in German, and transformed it from a small monthly newsletter into an important weekly newspaper, especially during [[World War II]] and the postwar era, when it became an important source of information for Jews trying to establish new lives and for [[Nazi concentration camp]] survivors to find each other. George remained Editor in Chief of ''Aufbau'' until his death.

== Life in Germany ==
Manfred George was born on October 22, 1893 in [[Berlin]], the son of a businessman. He studied law at universities in Berlin, [[Greifswald]] and [[Geneva]]. After a serious injury during [[World War I]], he was discharged from military service and continued his studies, graduating in 1917 with a doctorate in law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exilarchiv.de/Joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=421&amp;Itemid=1&amp;lang=german Biography of Manfred George] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407071614/http://www.exilarchiv.de/Joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=421&amp;Itemid=1&amp;lang=german |date=2012-04-07 }} Exil Archiv. Retrieved September 27, 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his journalism career before graduation, writing for the newspaper, ''Deutsche Montagszeitung'' and he began contributing to ''[[Die Weltbühne]]'' in 1915.&lt;ref name="weltbühne"&gt;[http://www.weltbuehne-lesen.de/georg.html Short biography and list of selected works by Manfred Georg] ''Weltbüne-Lesen'' {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to work at the publisher, Ullstein-Verlag. He quickly advanced from city editor of the ''[[Berliner Morgenpost]]'' to editor in chief of the ''[[Berliner Abendpost]]''. Later, he was a correspondent for the ''Vossiche Zeitung'' and worked as a managing editor in [[Breslau]].

At one point during the conflicts over the [[Upper Silesia plebiscite]], George was put before a firing squad by a [[Freikorps]] soldier, but was able to provide a certificate of military service and was released.&lt;ref name="cjr-1"&gt;[http://multiculturalcanada.ca/node/20687/full "Editor of ''Aufbau'', Influential German Weekly in New York, Left Loyal Readers Among Uprooted People All Over The World"] ''The Canadian Jewish Review'' (January 14, 1966) No. 16, p. 1.

After that, George was sent to [[Dresden]] and [[Leipzig]] as an Ullstein correspondent. In 1923, he began to make a name for himself as a theater critic, writing in the ''[[Berliner Volks-Zeitung]]'' and ''[[Acht-Uhr-Abendblatt]]''. He worked as Arts Editor of the newspaper, ''Tempo,'' as well as Associate Editor of the cultural magazine, ''Marsyas.''

In 1924, along with [[Carl von Ossietzky]], George was one of the founders of the leftist "Republikanische Partei Deutschlands" ("Republican Party of Germany"). George was the chairman of the party until it was dissolved later that year. A [[pacifist]], George was also associated with the "Deutsche Liga für Menschenrechte" ("German League for Human Rights") and the "Friedensbund der Kriegsteilnehmer" ("Association of War Veterans for Peace"), which started an initiative that became known as the "Nie-wieder-Krieg-Bewegung" ("No More War Movement"). Both the Republikanische Partei and the Friedensbund were formed by a community of journalists and editors connected with the ''Berliner Volks-Zeitung''. George also joined the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]].

After leaving Ullstein, he worked at [[Rudolf Mosse|Mosse-Verlag]] from 1923–1928, then returned to Ullstein. Around the end of the 1920s, he began to write radio plays. His musical revue, ''Oh, USA'' was broadcast in Berlin 50 times. He contributed to ''Die Weltbühne'' until 1932.&lt;ref name="weltbühne" /&gt; the year he published a biography of [[Theodor Herzl]], with introductions by [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name="cjr-1" /&gt;

== Life in exile ==
When the [[Nazi]]s [[Machtergreifung|gained control of the government]] in 1933, George emigrated to [[Czechoslovakia]]. In Prague, he was the publisher of an emigrant newspaper called the ''Prager Montagsblatt'' and was one of the founding members of the "Jewish Revue". After the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], he became a war correspondent for six months, writing for newspapers in [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Romania]]. After the [[Munich Agreement]], George continued to live in exile first in [[Hungary]], then [[Yugoslavia]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]] and [[France]], finally settling in the United States. The Nazi regime expatriated him on August 5, 1938.&lt;ref name="cjr-1" /&gt;

With an income of less than $4.00 a week, George started work in New York as editor of ''[[Aufbau]]'' and turned it into and important journalistic voice for the Jewish exile community in the post-World War II era, leading him to be called "a central figure in Jewish journalism of the Hitler and post-Hitler period".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Weltsch, [http://leobaeck.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/11/1/VII "Ten Years after Leo Baeck"] (PDF) Leo Baeck / Oxford Journals (1966).

George became a nationalized American in 1945. ''The New York Times'' wrote after his death on December 30, 1965 in [[New York City]]:
:Dr. George, a biographer and novelist, who was known as a liberal editor in Germany before the rise of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], became editor of ''Aufbau'' in 1939, after arriving here as a penniless refugee. ''Aufbau'' was then a small monthly newsletter published by the German Jewish Club of New York, which is now the New World Club, Inc. Dr. George marshaled a distinguished advisory board, including Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann, and built the publication into an influential weekly with a circulation of 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1966/01/01/archives/dr-manfred-george-72-dies-editor-of-german-weekly-here-novelist-and.html?sq=%2522manfred+george%2522&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p "Dr. Manfred George, 72, Dies; Editor of German Weekly Here; Novelist and Biographer Made ''Aufbau'' a Voice of Help to Refugees of Nazism"] ''The New York Times'' (January 1, 1966), page 17.

George was married to Jeanette (née Simon), a social worker, in 1920. They had two children, a son, Frank, who became an architect and a daughter, Renée, who became a book designer.&lt;ref name="cjr-p3"&gt;[http://www.multiculturalcanada.ca/node/16560/full "Editor of ''Aufbau'', Influential German Weekly in New York, Left Loyal Readers Among Uprooted People All Over The World"] ''The Canadian Jewish Review'' (January 14, 1966) No. 16, p. 3.

[[Leni Riefenstahl]], despite her association with [[Adolf Hitler]], had a close friendship with George. In her memoirs, published in 1987, she credits their friendship with keeping her from falling deeper into Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.emma.de/881.html Leni Riefenstahl: Propagandistin oder Künstlerin?]" {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-e-m-gmbh.com/andremuller/interview%20mit%20leni%20riefenstahl.html Interview with Leni Riefenstahl] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brain-juice.com/cgi-bin/show_bio.cgi?p_id=34 Leni Riefenstahl biography] brain-juice.com Retrieved October 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/26/books/the-fuhrer-s-movie-maker.html Book review] ''The New York Times'' (September 26, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; However, she was accused of using her friendship with George and other Jews as "alibi-Juden" (Jewish alibis), in an attempt to whitewash her past.&lt;ref&gt;Mareike Spiess-Hohnholz.

'''Max Leopold Margolis''' (born in Meretz ([[Merkinė]]), [[Vilna Governorate]], October 15, 1866 – April 2, 1932 in [[Philadelphia]]) was a [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] and American [[philologist]]. Son of [[Isaac Margolis]]; educated at the elementary school of his native town, the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], [[Berlin]], and [[Columbia University]], New York city ([[Ph.D.]] 1891). In 1891 he was appointed to a fellowship in [[Semitic languages]] at Columbia University, and from 1892 to 1897 he was instructor, and later [[assistant professor]], of [[Hebrew language]] and [[Biblical exegesis]] at the [[Hebrew Union College]] of [[Cincinnati]]. In 1897 he became assistant professor of Semitic languages in the [[University of California]]; in 1898, associate professor; and from 1902 the head of the Semitic department. When [[Dropsie College]] was formed in 1909, Margolis was chosen as Professor of Biblical Philology, remaining at Dropsie College until his death in 1932.

Margolis was named editor-in-chief of the [[Jewish Publication Society]]'s translation of the Bible into English, the finished product being published in 1917. He served as president of the [[Society of Biblical Literature]] as editor of the [[Journal of Biblical Literature]] (1914–1921). He was also editor of the [[Journal of the American Oriental Society]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3802">'''Menzerath's law''', or '''Menzerath–Altmann law''' (named after Paul Menzerath and Gabriel Altmann), is a [[linguistics|linguistic]] law according to which the increase of a linguistic construct results in a decrease of its constituents, and vice versa
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Gabriel Altmann, Michael H. Schwibbe   | title =  Das Menzerathsche Gesetz in informationsverarbeitenden Systemen| edition =  | publisher =  Olms |location=Hildesheim/Zürich/New York| year =  1989 | isbn = 3-487-09144-5  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Luděk Hřebíček    | title = Text Levels. Language Constructs, Constituents and the Menzerath-Altmann Law  | edition =  | publisher = Wissenschaftlicher Verlag Trier   |location= | year =  1995  | isbn = 3-88476-179-X   }}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

E.g., the longer a sentence (measured in terms of the number of clauses) the shorter the clauses (measured in terms of the number of words), or: the longer a word (in syllables or morphs) the shorter the syllables or words in sounds.

According to Altmann (1980),&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal| author=Gabriel Altmann |year=1980 |title=Prolegomena to Menzerath's law |journal=Glottometrika |volume=2 |pages=1–10}}
&lt;/ref&gt; it can be mathematically stated as:

&lt;math&gt;y=a \cdot x^{-b} \cdot e^{-c x}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

* &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the constituent size (e.g. syllable length)
* &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; size of the linguistic construct that is being inspected (e.g. number of syllables per word)
* &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; are the parameters

The law can be explained by the assumption that linguistic segments contain information about its structure (besides the information that needs to be communicated).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal| author=Reinhard Köhler |year=1984 |title= Zur Interpretation des Menzerathschen Gesetzes |journal=Glottometrika |volume=6 |pages=177–183}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption that the length of the structure information is independent of the length of the other content of the segment yields the alternative formula that was also successfully empirically tested.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal| author=Jiří Milička |year=2014 |title= Menzerath's Law: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts|journal=Journal of Quantitative Linguistics |volume=21 |issue=2|pages=85–99 |doi=10.1080/09296174.2014.882187}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond [[quantitative linguistics]], Menzerath's law can be discussed in any
multi-level complex systems. Given three levels, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the
number of middle-level units contained in a high-level unit, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;
is the averaged number of low-level units contained in middle-level units,
Menzerath's law claims a negative 
[[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
Menzerath's law is shown to be true for both the
[[nucleotide|base]]-[[exon]]-[[gene]] levels in the [[human genome]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal| author=Wentian Li |year=2012 |title= Menzerath's law at the gene-exon level in the human genome|journal=Complexity |volume=17 |issue=4|pages=49–53 |doi=10.1002/cplx.20398}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[nucleotide|base]]-[[chromosome]]-[[genome]] levels in genomes from a collection of species.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal| author= Ramon Ferrer-I-Cancho, Núria Forns |year=2009 |title=  The self-organization of genomes|journal=Complexity |volume=15 |issue=5|pages=34–36 |doi= 10.1002/cplx.20296}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Menzerath's law was shown to accurately predict the distribution of protein lengths in terms of amino acid number in the [[proteome]] of ten organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eroglu|first1=S|title=Language-like behavior of protein length distribution in proteomes|journal=Complexity|date=10 Jan 2014|volume=20|issue=2|pages=12–21|doi=10.1002/cplx.21498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mickey Mouse degrees''' (or '''Mickey Mouse courses''', known as '''bird courses''' in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.studentlife.utoronto.ca/lifeatuoft/2008/12/11/everybody-loves-a-bird-course/|title=Everybody Loves a Bird Course|date=11 December 2008|publisher=Life @ UofT}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a term for [[university]] [[academic degree|degree]] [[course (education)|courses]] regarded as worthless or irrelevant. The term is a [[dysphemism]], originating in the common usage of [[Mickey Mouse (pejorative)|"Mickey Mouse"]] as a [[pejorative]]. It came to prominence in the UK after use by the country's national [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]].

==Origins==
The term was used by education minister [[Margaret Hodge]], during a discussion on higher education expansion.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/2655127.stm 'Irresponsible' Hodge under fire]", BBC News, 14 January 2003. URL accessed on 24 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Hodge defined a Mickey Mouse course as "one where the content is perhaps not as rigorous as one would expect and where the degree itself may not have huge relevance in the labour market"; and that, furthermore, "simply stacking up numbers on Mickey Mouse courses is not acceptable". This opinion is often raised in the summer when exam results are released and new university courses revealed. The phrase took off in the late 1990s, as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] created the target of having 50% of students in [[higher education]] by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://education.guardian.co.uk/universityaccess/story/0,,1527877,00.html 50% higher education target doomed, says thinktank]", EducationGuardian.co.uk, 14 July 2005. URL accessed on 24 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
In 2000, [[Staffordshire University]] was mocked as providing "[[David Beckham]] Studies" because it provided a module on the sociological importance of football to students taking sociology, sports science, or media studies.&lt;ref name="beckham"&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/694451.stm Beckham in degree course]", BBC News, 29 March 2000. URL accessed on 24 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A professor for the department stressed that the course would not focus on Beckham, and that the module examines "the rise of football from its folk origins in the 17th century, to the power it's become and the central place it occupies in British culture, and indeed world culture, today."&lt;ref name="beckham"/&gt; In July 2015, MEP [[Louise Bours]] referred to the module on ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'', but as though it was a full degree course. Other degrees deemed "Mickey Mouse" include "golf management" and "surf science."&lt;ref name="takingthemick"&gt;"[http://education.guardian.co.uk/students/story/0,,875003,00.html Taking the mick]", EducationGuardian.co.uk, 15 January 2003. URL accessed on 24 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Durham University]] designed a module centred around [[Harry Potter]] to examine "prejudice, citizenship and bullying in modern society" as a part of a B.A. degree in Education Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Durham University students offered Harry Potter course |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wear-11011279 |work=BBC News |date=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One thing these courses share is that they are "vocational", which are perceived to be less intellectually rigorous than the traditional academic degrees.&lt;ref name="takingthemick"/&gt; 

Defenders of these courses object that the derogatory comments made in the media rely on the low [[symbolic capital]] of new subjects and rarely discuss course contents beyond the titles.&lt;ref name="Hodge"/&gt; Another factor is the correct or incorrect perception that the take up of these subjects, and the decline of more traditional academic subjects like science, engineering, mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://education.guardian.co.uk/alevels/story/0,,1548150,00.html A-level pupils urged to spurn 'soft' subjects]", EducationGuardian.co.uk, 12 August 2005. URL accessed on 24 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; is causing [[grade inflation|annual grade rise]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

==A-level subjects and "soft options"==
The A-level in General Studies is seen as a Mickey Mouse subject,&lt;ref name="takingthemick"/&gt; as well as A-level Critical Thinking, with many universities not accepting it as part of the requirements for an offer.

Additionally, although not considered Mickey Mouse subjects as such, some qualifications are not preferred by top universities and are regarded as "[[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)#Soft options|soft options]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/undergraduateProspectus2009/howToApply.htm#generated-subheading5 How to apply: A level subjects]", London School of Economics. URL accessed on 19 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 report stated that the sciences were more challenging than subjects such as [[Media Studies]], which might be taken by students to get higher grades for university applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/12/alevels.schools|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Anushka|last=Asthana|title=Too many pupils taking 'easy' A-levels|date=12 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An American example is a degree in physical education. These have been issued to members of the [[college athletics|college's athletics teams]], to make them eligible to play; otherwise they would fail to pass traditional subjects.

The '''Novi Sad Agreement''' ([[Serbo-Croatian]] [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Latin]]: ''Novosadski dogovor'', [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: Новосадски договор) was a document composed by 25 [[Serbs|Serbian]], [[Croats|Croatian]] and [[Bosnia]]n writers, [[linguists]] and intellectuals to build unity across the ethnic and linguistic divisions within [[Yugoslavia]], and create the [[Serbo-Croatian]] language standard.

[[File:Building of the Matica srpska, Novi Sad.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Matica srpska]]

Sponsored by the Serbian cultural organization's journal ''[[Letopis Matice srpske]]'' editorial board, talks on the use and acceptability of the [[Serbian language|Serbian]], which uses [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and is centered on the city of [[Belgrade]] (known as the eastern variety of Serbo-Croatian) and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dialect (which uses the [[Latin script]], centered on the city of [[Zagreb]], and is known as the western variety of Serbo-Croat) took place in the city of [[Novi Sad]], in the Serbian province of [[Vojvodina]]. Two days of discussion from 8 through 10 December 1954, resulted in the signing of the agreement, which laid out ten conclusions regarding the language.

The agreement focused on the similarities between the two dialects, and was primarily concerned with reconciling the different dialects for the benefit of a federalized [[Yugoslavia]]. The agreement stated that groups of linguists and intellectuals from both the eastern Serbian variant and the western Croatian variant would work together towards establishing a single dictionary and terminology.

The agreement also stated that the future language should develop naturally, although it was being forged by political will and pressure from both dialects.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:Citadel Petrovaradin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|View from Novi Sad of [[Petrovaradin fortress]] over the [[Danube]] river (August 2005)]]

The new terminology and dictionary would have its roots in both varieties of the language, and the literary journal present at the agreement would have the same content published in both the Cyrillic and Latin script. However, many, such as Croatian intellectual [[Ljudevit Jonke]], viewed the agreement as a veiled attempt to have Serbian become the official language of a federalized Yugoslavia, with only a passing nod given to Croatian.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

As a direct result of the agreement, ''[[Matica srpska]]'' and its Croatian counterpart ''[[Matica hrvatska]]'' published an [[orthography]] manual in 1960. Although widely praised by all levels of Serbian and Yugoslav party officials and intellectuals, the orthography was roundly criticized by Croatian intellectuals{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}, who saw the work as too Serb-centric. Their criticisms stemmed mainly from an analysis of the case of larger differences between the two dialects, claiming that the dictionary favored the eastern variant of the language over the western one.

== The text of the Novi Sad Agreement ==

The ten "conclusions", or  ''zaključci:''

# The national language of the Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins is a single language. Therefore, the literary language that has developed around two main centers, Belgrade and Zagreb, is one language, with two pronunciations, [[ijekavian]] and [[ekavian]].
# The name of the language must make reference to its two constituent parts in official use.
# The [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic]] scripts are equal; therefore both Serbs and Croats are expected to learn both alphabets, which will be accomplished primarily by schooling.
# Both pronunciations, ekavian and ijekavian, are also equal in all respects.
# Matica srpska will cooperate with Matica hrvatska in the production of a new dictionary of the joint language.
# The question of the creation of a unified terminology is also a problem that requires an immediate solution. A terminology for all spheres of economic, scholarly and cultural life needs to be created.
# Both sides will cooperate in the compiling of a joint orthographic manual (''pravopis'').
# The creation of artificial obstacles to the natural and normal development of the Croato-Serbian literary language must be decisively stopped. Harmful arbitrary "translations" of texts should be prevented and authors' original texts should be respected.
# The Commission for the creation of an orthography and terminology will be decided by the three universities (in [[University of Belgrade|Belgrade]], [[University of Zagreb|Zagreb]], and [[University of Sarajevo|Sarajevo]]), two academies (in [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts|Zagreb]] and [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Belgrade]]), and ''Matica srpska'' in Novi Sad and ''Matica hrvatska'' in Zagreb.
# These conclusions will be made available by Matica srpska to the [[Federal Executive Council (Yugoslavia)|Federal Executive council]], and the executive councils of: [[PR Serbia]], [[PR Croatia]], [[PR Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[PR Montenegro]], and to the universities in Belgrade, Zagreb, and Sarajevo, the academies in Zagreb and Belgrade and ''Matica hrvatska'' in Zagreb, and will be published in daily newspapers and journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Greenberg|2004|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philippine Mandarin''' ({{zh|t=菲律賓華語|s=菲律宾华语|p=Fēilǜbīn Huáyǔ}}) is a variety of [[Standard Mandarin Chinese]] widely spoken by [[Chinese Filipino]]s.  It is based on the phonology of the [[Beijing dialect]] and the grammar of [[Vernacular Chinese]], and is identical to the standard of Mandarin used in the [[Republic of China, Taiwan]] that is called "Guoyu" ({{lang|zh|國語}}). In terms of phonology, vocabulary and grammar, Standard Philippine Mandarin is similar to "Guoyu" (Standard Chinese in the Republic of China (Taiwan)) because almost all uses dictionaries and books from Taiwan. Many Chinese Filipino schools uses [[bopomofo]] (''zhuyin fuhao'') to teach the language. Philippine Mandarin uses the [[Traditional Chinese character]]s in writing and it is seen in the newspapers. ''Philippine Mandarin'' can be classified into two distinct Mandarin dialects: ''Standard Mandarin'' and ''Colloquial Mandarin''. These two dialects are easily distinguishable to a person proficient in Mandarin. ''Standard Mandarin'' is like the standard language of Taiwan, while ''Colloquial Mandarin'' tends to combine ''Mandarin'' ({{zh|s=华语|t=華語}}) and ''Min Nan Yu'' ({{lang|zh|閩南語}}) or Southern Hokkien{{what|date=April 2016}} features.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

==Phonology differences==

Minor differences occur between the tonal phonology of Standard Philippine Mandarin and other forms of Standard Mandarin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="72518">This article provides a grammar sketch of the [[Nawat]] or [[Pipil language]], an [[endangered language]] spoken by the [[Pipils]] of western [[El Salvador]], belonging to the [[Nahuatl|Nahua]] group within the [[Uto-Aztecan]] language family. There also exists a brief [[Pipil language (typological overview)|typological overview]] of the language that summarizes the language's most salient features of general typological interest in more technical terms.

The [[voiced]] [[allophone]]s of /k/, {{IPA|[ɡ]}} and {{IPA|[ɣ]}}, are common but their distribution is subject to both [[dialect]] variation and [[phonological rule]]s (and their exceptions).

The /n/ phoneme has various allophones, as follows: 

{| 
| 
*When followed by a vowel it is usually '''alveolar'''.
| style="background:#efefef;" | 
'''''n'''aja'' 'I, me', ''i'''n'''i'' 'this', '''''n'''u'''n'''an'' 'my mother' {{IPA|[n]}}
|-
|
*When followed by a plosive or affricate consonant its [[place of articulation]] '''assimilates'''.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
''se'''n'''pa'' {{IPA|[m]}} 'once, again', ''Ke'''n''' tinemi?'' 'How are you?' {{IPA|[n]}}, ''i'''n'''chan'' {{IPA|[ɲ]}} 'at their house', ''te'''n'''kal'' 'door, patio' {{IPA|[ŋ]}}
|-
|
*Preceding other consonants or a pause, the pronunciation of ''n'' is most often '''velar''' {{IPA|[ŋ]}}.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
''Ka'''n''' nemi?'' 'Where is (he/she/it)?', ''a'''n'''yawit'' 'you (pl.) are going';

''Ini ne apa'''n''''' 'This is the river', ''Shimutalika'''n'''!'' 'Sit down!' {{IPA|[ŋ]}}
|-
|
*In word-final position preceding a vowel, it is also '''velar''' {{IPA|[ŋ]}}.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
''Ke'''n''' ajsik?'' 'How did he/she arrive?', ''wa'''n''' ini'' 'and this' {{IPA|[ŋ]}}
|-
|
*'''Velar''' {{IPA|[ŋ]}} occurs intervocalically in some words; this may be represented in writing by ''nh''.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
''nema'''nh'''a'' 'later, straight away', ''ki'''nh'''ita'' 'sees them', ''te'''nh'''at'' 'river bank' {{IPA|[ŋ]}}
|}

Most words are [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]] on the second to last [[syllable]]. Some are stressed on the last syllable: these include a few lexical [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] such as ''tenk'''a'''l'' 'door, patio' (from ''ten'' 'mouth' and ''kal'' 'house'), certain [[prefix]]ed or [[reduplication|reduplicated]] [[monosyllable]]s such as (optionally) ''kajk'''a'''l'' 'houses', and many [[diminutive]]s in ''-tzin'' or ''-chin''. There are also words in these categories with regular penultimate stress.

===Phonotactics===
{|
|
* [[Syllable]]s can have any of the shapes permitted by the formula (C)V(C), and words may have any number of such syllables.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
''kal'' 'house', ''at'' 'water', ''ne'' 'there', ''nu-ish'' 'my eye', ''a-pan'' 'river', ''mis-tun'' 'cat', ''kat-ka'' 'was', ''uj-ti'' 'path', ''kwa-wit'' 'tree, wood, stick', ''nu-kwaj-kwach'' 'my clothes', ''metz-ti'' 'moon', ''nech-kwa'' 'he/she/it is eating me', ''tzak-tuk'' 'closed', ''shik-tzuj-tzun-ta-mej-ti-kan'' 'sharpen the ends! (pl.)'
|-
| 
* Most Nawat [[consonant]]s can occur in any position, but ''m'' and ''kw'' do not occur at the end of a syllable (or word), and there are no words ending in ''p'' either. Where [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] processes would place them in syllable-final position, ''m'' changes to ''n'' (for the pronunciation of which see above), and ''kw'' changes to ''k''.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
''teku'''m'''a-t'' 'gourd' but ''nu-teku'''n''''' 'my gourd', ''ki-tza'''kw'''a'' 'he closes it' but ''tza'''k'''-tuk'' 'closed'
|-
|
* ''J'' has a limited distribution: it never follows another consonant and normally cannot begin a word either. ''J'' at the end of words is pronounced weakly and often disappears altogether.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
''naja'' 'I, me', ''ujti'' 'path', ''nikwaj'' 'I ate it', ''shushukna(j)'' 'green'
|}

====Secondary semivowels====
{| 
|width="50%"|
When one [[vowel]] [[phoneme]] immediately follows another within a word a {{IPA|[j]}} (the ''y'' sound) is often inserted between them ({{IPA|[w]}} if the first vowel is ''u''). This is common when the first of the two vowels is [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]].
| width="50%"; style="background:#efefef;" | 
* ''miak'' 'many' → {{IPA|[ˈmijak]}}
* *''shikwa + -a'' → ''shikwaya'' 'eat it already!'
* ''se-uk'' (from *''se + -uk'') 'other' → {{IPA|[ˈsejuk]}}
* ''nu-ika-w'' 'my younger brother' → {{IPA|[nuˈwiɡaw]}}
|-
| 
In other cases, /i/ or /e/ preceding another vowel is often replaced by {{IPA|[j]}}.
| style="background:#efefef;" | 
* ''ki-pia-ya'' 'he already has it' → {{IPA|[ɡiˈpjaja]}}
* ''seujti'' (from *''se + ujti'') 'once' → {{IPA|[ˈsjuhti]}}

===Reduplication===
[[Reduplication]] is a [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] process employed in several parts of the grammatical system, which is characterized in [[phonological]] terms. Nawat reduplication takes the form of repetition of a word's first syllable (actually only the (C)V part thereof). So for example, a reduplication of ''kunet'' 'child' is ''ku-kunet'' 'children', and a derivative of the root ''petz-'' 'smooth' is ''pe-petz-ka'' 'a kind of small, silvery fish', local Spanish ''pepesca''.

Another more productive variety of reduplication involves adding a ''j'' after the reduplication, e.g., ''ku-j-kunet'' 'children', ''pe-j-petz-naj'' plural of ''petz-naj'' 'smooth, naked'. Generalizing, plain reduplication (without ''j'') is governed by [[word|lexical]] criteria. ''J''-reduplication, on the contrary, is used by grammatical rules that: 

{|  
|-
| 
* generate noun or adjective plurals from singulars
| style="background:#efefef;" |
''tamal'' 'tortilla' → ''taj-tamal'' 'tortillas'

''mistun'' 'cat' → ''mij-mistun'' 'cats'

''kal'' 'house' → ''kaj-kal'' 'houses'

''apan'' 'river' → ''aj-apan'' 'rivers'
|- 
| 
* produce [[iterative (grammar)|iteratives]] from non-iterative verbs
| style="background:#efefef;" |
''taketza'' 'he talks' → ''taj-taketza'' 'he converses'

''nemi'' 'he is (somewhere)' → ''nej-nemi'' 'he walks about'

''paki'' 'he is laughing' → ''paj-paki'' 'he is happy'

''ki-ajwa'' 'he scolds him' → ''ki-aj-ajwa'' 'he tells him off'
|}

* ''ch(i)upi'' 'few, a few'
* ''muchi'' 'all'
|
* ''se'' 'one'
* ''ume'' 'two'
* ''yey'' 'three'
* ''nawi'' 'four'
* ''makwil'' 'five'
|}
The [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]s (except for ''ne'') and [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]]s may be used pronominally, i.e., without a noun head, or preceding the noun they determine or quantify, e.g., ''ne takat'' 'the man', ''ini techan'' 'this village', ''miak kal'' 'many houses', ''ume siwat'' 'two women'.

===Possession===

The [[prefix]]es shown below are attached to nouns to express who they 'belong' to, e.g., ''nu-yak'' 'my nose', ''i-eltiw'' 'his/her sister', ''tu-mistun'' 'our cat', ''mu-techan'' 'your village'.

''mu-'' 'your'

''i-'' 'his/her/its'
|
''tu-'' 'our'

''anmu-'' 'your'

''in-'' 'their'
|}

Some nouns are always 'possessed', so that it is bad Nawat just to say *''se yak'' 'a nose' or *''ne eltiw'' 'the sister': instead one has to say ''se iyak'' 'one her-nose', ''ne nueltiw'' 'the my-sister', or whatever possessive form fits the context best. These include most nouns expressing either a part of the body or a member of one's family.

Other nouns can occur either with or without a possessor. Some of these have two different forms, one (the absolute form) for use without a possessive prefix and the other (the possessed form) for use with a possessive prefix. These 'states' may be indicated by different [[suffix]]es, e.g., ''ne kune-t'' 'the child' → ''ne nu-kune-w'' 'my child; ''ne sin-ti'' 'the maize' → ''ne nu-sin'' 'my maize'; ''ne es-ti'' 'the blood' → ''ne nu-es-yu'' 'my blood'. When both states of the noun are zero-marked (like ''mistun'' and ''techan''), the noun is 'invariable'.

The [[possession (linguistics)|possessive]] indices tell us the [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]] of the possessor, which may be specified by a [[noun phrase]] following the possessed noun. When that happens, the possessed normally has the third-person index, e.g., ''ne i-mistun ne piltzin'' 'the boy's cat' (literally: 'his-cat the boy'). 

There is an alternative way to express this, if the noun is [[alienability (linguistics)|alienable]], using the [[preposition]] ''pal'' or the [[relational (grammar)|relational]] ''ipal'': ''ne mistun pal ne piltzin'' ('the cat of the boy'). Even with an [[inalienable possession]], it is possible to say ''ne inan pal ne piltzin'' ('the his-mother of the boy').

===The plural===
Nouns may be made [[plural]] by two different procedures: 

{|
|
through [[reduplication]] (see above)
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''mistun'' 'cat' → '''''mij'''-mistun'' 'cats'
|-
|
using a plural [[suffix]] (-''met'', ''-ket'')
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''taka-t'' 'man' → ''taka-'''met''''' 'men'
|}

For possessed forms:

{|
|
There is a special possessed plural suffix, ''-wan'', used with certain nouns denoting family relations and similarly intimate 'possessions'.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''nu-elti-w'' 'my sister' → ''nu-elti-'''wan''''' 'my sisters'
* ''nu-kunpa'' 'my comrade or friend' → ''nu-kunpa'''wan''''' 'my comrades or friends'
* ''nu-pal'' 'mine' → ''nu-pal-'''wan''''' 'my possessions'
|-
|
Otherwise the reduplicated form of the singular possessed form is used.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''nu-kune-w'' 'my child' → ''nu-'''kuj'''-kune-w'' 'my children'
* ''nu-kwach'' 'my cloth'' → ''nu-'''kwaj'''-kwach'' 'my clothes'
|-
|
Sometimes the possessive prefix is reduplicated instead.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''nu-ish'' 'my eye' → '''''nuj'''-nu-ish'' 'my eyes'
* ''i-kshi'' 'his foot' → '''''ij'''-i-kshi'' 'his feet'
|}

Some word that may accompany a noun in the noun phrase, such as the [[determiner (linguistics)|determiners]] ''ne'', ''ini'', ''uni'', are invariable for [[grammatical number|number]], e.g., ''uni mistun'' 'that cat', ''uni mijmistun'' 'those cats'. On the other hand, nouns accompanied by a [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] that is plural in meaning need not themselves be pluralized [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]], e.g., ''ume mistun'' 'two cats'.

===Adjectives===

[[Adjective]]s used attributively can precede or follow the noun, e.g., ''se selek iswat'' or ''se iswat selek'' 'a tender leaf' (''selek'' 'tender, fresh, green', ''iswat'' 'leaf').

There is considerable variation regarding how to mark plural number in [[noun phrase]]s containing an adjective. As long as some element or other in the noun phrase marks the phrase as plural, it seems not to matter which one, or even how many elements are (redundantly) pluralized, though there some speakers seem to indicate a preference for (1) marking plurality in the first possible component, and (2) avoiding redundancy, thus ''chijchiltik tzaput'' or ''tzajtzaput chiltik'', but ''ume chiltik tzaput'' or ''ume tzaput chiltik''.

===Pronouns and adverbs===
No [[noun phrase]] is marked for [[grammatical case|case]], and this is just as true of the [[pronoun]]s, which have each a single form that can perform any function in the sentence.

===Case, prepositions and relationals===

[[Noun phrase]]s in core grammatical functions are not marked for [[grammatical case|case]]. To specify other roles, a [[preposition]] or a [[relational (grammar)|relational]] may precede a noun phrase. The main prepositions are:

{| border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
|+ Prepositions
| '''ka'''
| 'to, at (etc.)'
| 
*''ka tiupan'' 'to the church'
*''ka tayua'' 'at night'
|-
| '''tik'''
| 'in, to, from (etc.)'
| 
*''tik ne techan'' 'in/to/from the village'
*''tik Nawat'' 'in Nawat'
|-
| '''pak'''
| 'on'
| 
*''pak ne metat'' 'on the grinding stone'
|-
| '''tech'''
| 'at, by, near, to'
| 
*''tech ne apan'' 'by the river'
*''tech ne siwat'' 'to the woman'
|-
| '''wan'''
| 'with (etc.)'
| 
*''wan ne siwat'' 'with the woman'
|-
| '''chan'''
| '' 'chez' ''
| 
*''chan ne siwat'' 'at/to/from the woman's house'
|-
| '''pal'''
| 'of, for'
| 
*''pal nunan'' 'for my mother'
*''se siwat pal nutechan'' 'a woman from my village'
|}

All the above prepositions derive [[Historical linguistics|diachronically]] from relationals. In some cases the preposition merely represents an abbreviation of the relational by omitting the ''i-'' prefix.

[[relational (grammar)|Relational]]s are quasi-nouns expressing some relationship (sometimes spatial, but not always) to their possessive complement. For example, ''nu-jpak'', meaning 'on or over me', consists of the relational ''(i)jpak'' conveying 'position above' with a first person singular possessor. Some relationals are shown in third-person-singular forms in the following table:

* ''ipan'' 'behind'
* ''itech'' 'near, alongside'
|
* ''iwan'' 'with'
* ''ichan'' 'at/to/from the house of'
* ''ipal'' 'for, belonging to'
* ''ipanpa'' 'on account of, instead of'

==Basic verb morphology==
===Subject and object indices===

The following table shows the [[prefix]]es that serve to index the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[object (grammar)|object]], respectively. (Note that in the [[subjunctive]] [[mood (grammar)|mood]] the second-person subject prefix takes the special form ''shi-''.)

[[transitive verb|Transitive]] verbs take, in addition, an object prefix after the subject prefix. The third-singular object prefix ''ki-'' is shortened to ''-k-'' when preceded by any of the subject prefixes ''ni-'', ''ti-'' or ''shi-''. This is illustrated here by the present ([[indicative]]) and subjunctive of an intransitive verb (''panu'' 'pass') and a transitive verb with a third-person-singular object (''-pia'' 'have'):

===Tenses===
[[tense (grammar)|Tenses]] (so called for convenience although they include [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] or [[grammatical mood|mood]] categories) are characterized by distinct [[suffixes]]. The plural suffix ''-t'' combines with each tense suffix to give us plural tense endings, also shown here.

The present (despite its name), [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] and [[subjunctive]] are not time-specific, but may refer to events before, at or later than the time of speaking as determined by the context. They express an ongoing or habitual, completed and potential action or state, respectively.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* '''Present:''' ''Nemik se takat munamiktijtuk kipiatuya ne isiwaw, wan inte kimati katka ka '''kisa''' ka tayua.'' 'There was a married man who had a wife, and didn't know that she ''used to go out'' at night.'
* '''Perfect:''' ''Yaja pejki kikwa ne tortaj '''kimakatuk''' inan.'' 'He started to eat the bun his mother ''had given'' him.'
* '''Subjunctive:''' ''Kilwij '''ma walmukwepa'''.'' 'He told her to come back (or: ''that she should come back'').'
|-
|
The [[Imperative mood|imperative]] only differs from the subjunctive by the absence of the [[grammatical particle|particle]] ''ma''.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* '''Subjunctive:''' ''Yawi metzilwia '''ma shimutali'''.'' 'She will tell you ''to sit down''.'
* '''Imperative:''' '''''Shikalaki''' wan '''shimutali'''!'' '' 'Come in'' and ''sit down''!'
|-
|
The [[participle]] acts like a noun or adjective: it does not take object prefixes and is pluralized by reduplication rather than suffixation.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Nikpia se kumit '''tentuk''' wan et.'' 'I have a pot ''full'' of beans.'
* ''Nikpia yey kumit '''(tej)tentuk''' wan et.'' 'I have three pots ''full'' of beans.'

The verbs classified as Class I in this table end in ''a'' or ''i'' in the present and subjunctive, but that vowel is lost in the past (which ends in ''-ki'' in this class) and in the perfect (all perfects are in ''-tuk''). Class II verbs, which end in ''a'', ''i'' or ''u'', retain this in all forms, and form their past in ''-k''. Class III differs from Class I only in that there is no past suffix at all, only the bare stem. Class IV verbs end in ''-ia'' or ''-ua'' in the present, but lose their final ''a'' in all the other tenses (including the subjunctive), and add a ''j'' in the past and perfect.

It has the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] peculiarity that when preceded by ''ni-'', ''ti-'', ''shi-'' or ''ki-'' both ''i'' and ''w'' are omitted, leaving ''nal-'', ''tal-'', ''shal-'' and ''kal-''. When ''ni-/ti-/shi-'', ''ki-'' and ''wal-'' would all come together, the ''ki-'' component disappears altogether, so that ''nal-'', ''tal-'' and ''shal-'' do double duty as transitive (= ''ni- + ki- + wal-'', etc.) markers as well as intransitive (= ''ni- + wal-'', etc.) ones. The plural object marker ''kin-'' is split in two when combined with ''wal-''. The following examples illustrate.

{| class=wikitable style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
| ''kiski'' 'went/came out' 
| '''''wal'''kiski'' 'came out (towards me)'
|-
| ''nitemuk'' 'I went down'
| ''n'''al'''temuk'' 'I came down (here)'
|-
| ''kiwikak'' 'he took (it)'
| ''k'''al'''wikak'' 'he brought (it)'
|-
| ''nikwikak'' 'I took (it)'
| ''n'''al'''wikak'' 'I brought (it)'
|-
| ''kinnutzki'' 'he called them'
| ''k'''al'''innutzki'' 'he called them here'
|-
| ''nikinnutzki'' 'I called them'
| ''n'''al'''innutzki'' 'I called them here'
|}

==Syntax==
===Non-verbal predicates===

{|
|width="50%"|
Non-verbal phrases may be employed as predicates, with no verbal element at all in the sentence.
| width="50%"; style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Ini '''Carlos'''.'' 'This ''is Carlos''.'
* ''Carlos '''tumak'''.'' 'Carlos ''is fat''.'
* ''Yejemet '''tuj-tumak'''.'' 'They ''are fat''.'
|-
|
Non-verbal predicates do not have most of the morphological categories of verbs (such as tense), but some of them do take the subject indices. As usual there is no prefix for third-person subjects, hence ''Ini Carlos''.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Naja '''ni-Carlos'''.'' 'I ''am Carlos''.'
* ''Taja '''ti-tumak'''.'' 'You (sg.) ''are fat''.'
* ''Tejemet '''ti-tuj-tumak'''.'' 'We ''are fat''.'
|-
|
Subjunctive non-verbal predicates are possible.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* '''''Ma ijkia'''!'' '' 'Let it be so''!'
* ''Naja niknekiskia '''ma nupal'''.'' 'I wish ''it were mine''.'
|-
|
Non-verbal predicates may be followed (like verbal ones) by an invariable ''katka'', which establishes a past time-frame. In a non-verbal context ''katka'' can thus be translated as ''was'' or ''were''.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Naja '''ni-tumak katka'''.'' 'I ''was fat / used to be fat''.'
|}

===Intransitive and transitive===
Most Nawat verbs belong clearly to one of two major formal types: intransitive or transitive. 

Here, [[intransitive]] verbs are those that cannot have an [[object (grammar)|object]] and corresponding object prefixes&amp;mdash;while [[transitive verb|transitive]] verbs are those that must have an object and object prefix. Neither [[subject (grammar)|subject]] nor object noun phrases need be present in the sentence, but whether explicit or implicit, the corresponding subject and object indices must. (This statement rests on the convention of considering the index for a third-person subject to take the form of 'zero'.)

Some of the most common intransitive and transitive Nawat verbs are given below:

===Valency changes===
There are a number of means, grammatical or lexical, for changing a verb's [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]] (the number of arguments it takes) and thereby effectively 'converting' it to a different transitivity type. A considerable number of lexical pairs exist consisting of two related verbs, one intransitive and the other transitive:

{|
|width="50%"|
The ''-i'' (intr.) ~ ''-a'' or ''-ia'' (tr.) [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] is very frequent in the lexicon, but is not productive, and does not constitute a hard-and-fast rule.
| width="50%"; style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''kelun-'''i''''' (II) 'break' (intr.) ~ ''-kelun-'''a''''' (I) 'break' (tr.)
* ''tem-'''i''''' (II) 'become full' (intr.) ~ ''-tem-'''a''''' (I) 'fill' (tr.)
* ''shin-'''i''''' (II) 'be sprinkled' (intr.) ~ ''-shini-'''a''''' (IV) 'sprinkle' (tr.)
* ''tam-'''i''''' (II) 'end' (intr.) ~ ''-tami-'''a''''' (IV) 'end' (tr.)
|-
|width="50%"|
A more productive lexical derivation that increases valency is the [[causative]] suffix ''-tia''.
| width="50%"; style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''kalak-'''i''''' (II) 'enter' (intr.) ~ ''-kalak-'''tia''''' (IV) 'put in, bring in' (tr.)
* ''mik-'''i''''' (II) 'die' (intr.) ~ ''-mik-'''tia''''' (IV) 'kill' (tr.)
* ''panu'' (II) 'pass' (intr.) ~ ''-panul-'''tia''''' (IV) 'cause to pass' (tr.)
* ''tawan-i'' (II) 'get drunk' (intr.) ~ ''-tawan-'''tia''''' (IV) 'get (someone) drunk' (tr.)
|}

Apart from such purely lexical alternations, there are two prefixes with specific grammatical functions which, attached to transitive verbs, reduce their surface valency (when they are used, there is no object prefix): 

{|
|width="50%"|
The [[unaccusative]] prefix ''ta-'' indicates that the object is indefinite or unspecified. Compare: ''Yaja '''ki'''-kwa'' 'He eats it', ''Yaja '''ki'''-kwa ne et'' 'He eats the beans', but ''Yaja '''ta'''-kwa'' 'he eats'.
| width="50%"; style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''-kwa'' 'eat' (tr.) → '''''ta'''-kwa'' (unspecified object)
* ''-mana'' 'cook' (tr.) → '''''ta'''-mana'' (unspecified object)
* ''-paka'' 'wash' (tr.) → '''''ta'''-paka'' (unspecified object)
|-
|width="50%"|
The [[unergative]] prefix ''mu-'' avoids mentioning the [[agent (grammar)|agent]], and the underlying object gets re-encoded as surface subject, e.g., ''Mu-kwa'' 'It gets eaten', ''Mu-kwa ne et'' 'The beans get eaten'.
| width="50%"; style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''-kwa'' 'eat' (tr.) → '''''mu'''-kwa'' 'get eaten'
* ''-mana'' 'cook' (tr.) → '''''mu'''-mana'' 'get cooked'
|-
|width="50%"|
''Mu-'' has three other possible meanings, all involving a survace valency decrease: [[grammatical voice|reflexive, reciprocal and middle]].
| width="50%"; style="background:#efefef;" |
* '''Reflexive''': ''-paka'' 'wash' (tr.) → '''''mu'''-paka'' 'wash oneself'
* '''Reciprocal''': ''-ita'' 'see' (tr.) → '''''mu'''-ita'' 'see each other'
* '''Middle''': ''-namiktia'' 'marry (tr.) → '''''mu'''-namiktia'' 'get married'
|}

===Unmarked oblique complements===
Some Nawat verbs have a [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] that does not correspond to any index in the verb. These include the following: 

{|
|width="50%"|
Intransitive verbs taking a [[locative]] complement. In this case the complement may optionally be replaced by a [[prepositional]] or relational phrase.
| width="50%"; style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Naja niyaw '''Sentzunat'''.'' 'I am going ''to Sonsonate''.'
(also: ''Naja niyaw '''ka Sentzunat'''.'')
* ''Yaja nemi '''Awachapan'''.'' 'She is ''in Ahuachapán''.'
(also: ''Yaja nemi '''tik Awachapan'''.'')
|-
|width="50%"|
[[Ditransitive]] verbs, i.e., transitive verbs with two 'objects'. Generally one of these has the semantic role of [[recipient (grammar)|recipient]] or [[affected (grammar)|affected party]], and this is encoded as a grammatical object in Nawat. The other complement, normally in a [[patient (grammar)|patient]] role, is made the unmarked [[oblique case|oblique]] complement. 
| width="50%"; style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Ne siwat nechmakak '''ne tumin'''.'' 'The woman gave me ''the money''.'
* ''Yaja kinmachtia '''Nawat'''.'' 'He teaches them ''Nawat''.'
* ''Nechishtilijket '''ne nupiltzin'''.'' 'They took ''my son'' from me.'
|-
|width="50%"|
Valency-reduced ditransitives, i.e., verbs of the preceding type that undergo [[valency (linguistics)|valency]]-reduction with ''ta-'' or ''mu-'', thereby becoming two-argument verbs without a grammatical object. For example, ''ta-machtia'' 'teach (something)' (without saying whom we teach).
| width="50%"; style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Yaja tamachtia '''Nawat'''.'' 'He teaches ''Nawat''.'
* ''Ne siwat tamakak '''tumin'''.'' 'The woman gave ''money''.'
|-
|width="50%"|
With ''mu-'' we have ''mu-machtia'' 'learn, study' (i.e., 'teach oneself').
| width="50%"; style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Yejemet mumachtiat '''Nawat'''.'' 'They learn (or study) ''Nawat''.'
|}

===Verb sequences===
There are several ways for a verb to be subordinated to another (preceding) verb. 

* If the verbs have different subjects:

{|
|width="50%"|
the subordinate verb may be in the [[subjunctive]] (always introduced by ''ma'')...
| width="50%"; style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Nikneki '''ma shinaka'''.'' 'I want you to stay.'
|-
| ...or in the present tense introduced by ''pal'' or ''ka''.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Niwalajtuk nikan '''pal titaketzat'''.'' 'I have come here so that we may talk.' (literally 'I have come here for we talk')
* ''Ken tikchiwki '''ka yawi''' ne tawanani?'' 'How did you get the drunkard to go away?' (lit. 'How did you make that (he) goes away the drunkard?')
|-
| But if the first object is the same as the second subject, there may be no subordinator with the present ([[serial verb construction]]).
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Inte nechajkawa '''nikalaki'''.'' 'She won't let me in.' (literally 'She doesn't let me I enter')
|}

* When both verbs share the same subject:

{|
|width="50%"|
''Pal'' may again be used, with both verbs indexed for the same subject:
| width="50%"; style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Niwalaj ka nikan '''pal nitaketza''' muwan.'' 'I came here in order to talk to you.' (lit. 'I came here for I talk with you')
|-
| The two verbs may be juxtaposed with no intervening [[subordinator (grammar)|subordinator]], again with both verbs indexed for the same subject and the second in the present (i.e., unmarked) tense. Called the [[serial verb construction]], this pattern is very pervasive and has many uses in Nawat.
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Niajki '''nitaketza''' iwan.'' 'I went to speak to him.' (literally 'I went I speak with him')
* ''Nikistuk '''nipashalua'''.'' 'I have come out for a stroll.' (lit. 'I have gone out I stroll')
* ''Nimuketzki '''niktatia''' tit.'' 'I got up to light the fire.' (lit. 'I got up I light the fire')
* ''Nimukwepki '''nikita'''.'' 'I turned around to see.' (lit. 'I turned round I see')
* ''Yaja mutalia '''chuka'''.'' 'He is sitting (there) crying.' (lit. 'He sits he cries')
|}

===Periphrastic TAM constructions===
The serial construction also serves as the structure for a number of compound expressions of [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[linguistic modality|modality]], e.g.

{| 
| width="50%" |
''yawi'' (present) + V (periphrastic future)
| width="50%"; style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Naja '''niyaw nimumachtia''' Nawat.'' 'I am going to (''or'' I will) learn Nawat.'
|-
| ''nemi'' + V 'be V-ing'
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Tejemet '''tinemit titakwat'''.'' 'We are eating.' ''
|-
| ''pewa'' + V 'start V-ing'
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Ne piltzin '''pejki chuka'''.'' 'The boy started to cry.' ''
|-
| ''-neki'' + V 'want to V'
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Naja '''niknekiskia nimetzpalewia'''.'' 'I would like to help you.' ''
|-
| ''weli'' + V 'can/be able to/know how to V'
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Taja '''tiweli titaketza''' yek.'' 'You can speak well.' ''
|}

But there are also constructions, or variant expressions, that depart from this pattern somewhat. 

The invariable word ''katka'', which means 'was' or 'before, in the past', may occur following a verb form to establish past or habitual reference, e.g., ''inte kimati katka'' 'he didn't know'.

===Negation===

[[negation (linguistics)|Negative]] [[grammatical particle|particles]] immediately precede either a verb or a non-verbal predicate. Basically there are three of them:

{| 
| width="50%" |
the ordinary negator ''inte'' (with a shorter form: ''te'' and a dialect variant ''tesu''),
| width="50%"; style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Ne siwatket '''inte''' walajtiwit.'' 'The women have not come.'
* '''''Tesu''' nikmati.'' 'I do not know.'
* ''Naja '''te''' ni-Carlos.'' 'I am not Carlos.'
|-
| the less frequent ''nian'' or ''nan'', which is conjunctive or emphatic, 
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Yejemet inte takwajket '''nian''' atiket.'' 'They neither ate nor drank.'
|-
| and the [[prohibitive mood|prohibitive]] ''maka'' or ''má''. 
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* '''''Maka''' shalmukwepa!'' 'Don't come back!'
|}

They also combine with pronouns and adverbs to yield other negative expressions, e.g., ''(in)te (t)atka'' 'nothing', ''(in)te aka'' 'no one', ''(in)te keman'' 'never', ''nian aka'' 'no one at all, and no one', ''maka keman'' 'never ever!', etc.: ''Inte nikmati tatka (datka)'' 'I know nothing', ''Maka shikilwi aka!'' 'Do not tell anyone!'

===Phase===
Two suffixes, ''-a'' and ''-uk'', lend different [[phasal (grammar)|phasal]] nuances to a predicate, i.e., they add certain temporal (or related) notions, expressing that a situation has already been reached (with ''-a'') or that it still obtains (with ''-uk''). The more common phasal suffix, ''-a'', is also used simply to place emphasis on the predicate so marked. Compare for example:

{| style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" 
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Nemi takwal.'' 'There is some food.'
* ''Nemi'''a''' takwal.'' 'There is food now.' (implies there wasn't any before)
* ''Nemi'''uk''' takwal.'' 'There is still food.' (implies there was food before too)
|}

In negative sentences, the phasal suffixes are added to the negative particle, for example:

{| style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" 
| style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Inte (te, tesu) nemi takwal.'' 'There is no food.'
* ''Inte'''a''' (teya, teya su) nemi takwal.'' 'There is no more food.'
* ''Inte'''uk''' (teyuk) nemi takwal.'' 'There is no food yet.'
|}

===Questions===
Yes-no [[question]]s are not differentiated grammatically from the corresponding statements. They may be affirmative, e.g., ''Taja tikmati?'' 'Do you know?', or negative, e.g., ''Inte tikitak kanka witz?'' 'Didn't you see where he was coming from?'

For replying affirmatively to yes-no questions, one may use ''E / Ej / Eje'' 'Yes', and sometimes ''Kia'' 'That's right' (literally 'So'). But it is equally common to respond using the appropriately inflected form of the main verb of the question, e.g.. (offering a cookie, for example) ''Tikneki se? - Nikneki'' 'Would you like one? - I would', ''Weli titaketza Nawat? - Weli'' 'Can you speak Nawat? - I can'. The standard negative answer is ''Inte / Te / Tesu'' 'No', or again, the verb of the question negated: ''Tikitak uni takat ka ne? - Te nikitak'' 'Did you see that man over there? - I did not'. Other idiomatic responses include ''Nusan'' 'Also', ''Teika inte!'' or ''Taika te!'' 'Why not!' and ''Inte / Te / Tesu nikmati'' 'I don't know'.

Wh-questions are formed with a wh-word, which usually immediately precedes the predicate (verbal or non-verbal.

[[Indirect question]]s are introduced by either ''(a)su'' 'if, whether' or a wh-expression, depending on the kind of question.

===Coordination===

''Wan'' or ''iwan'' (which is also the preposition and relational 'with') serves as an all-purpose coordinating [[grammatical conjunction|conjunction]]. There seem not to be any specialised native words for 'but' and 'or' (unless ''ush'' 'or' is one), and the Spanish words ''pero'' and ''o'' are sometimes used. ''N(i)an'' 'nor' may be used to coordinate negative statements. ''Mal'' or ''melka'' 'although, even though' can form adversative clauses, e.g., ''Niyaw niyaw, mal-te/melka te nikneki'' 'I will go, although I don't want to'. ''Nusan'' 'also' is common, e.g., ''Yaja nusan walaj'' 'She also came'; its negative counterpart is simply ''nusan te...'' 'not...either', e.g., ''Naja nusan te nikneki nitakwa'' 'I don't want to eat either'.

===Subordination===

[[subordinate clause]]s are introduced by [[subordinator (grammar)|subordinators]]; the following table illustrates some of the most common:

{| class=wikitable
! subor-dinator
! translation
! use
! example
|-
| '''ka'''
| 'that', 'because'
| general complementizer, reason
| 
* ''Yaja ina '''ka''' te kimati tatka.'' 'He says that he doesn't know anything (about it).'
* ''Ne ejekat witz sesek '''ka''' ne mishti kitzakwa ne tunal.'' 'The wind comes cold because clouds cover the sun.'
|-
| '''ma''' (subjunc-tive)
| 'that', 'to'
| unrealized different-subject complements, purpose
| 
* ''Nikneki '''ma''' shitakwika.'' 'I want you to sing.'
* ''Yek '''ma''' mumachtikan.'' 'It is good that they should learn.'
* ''Shikajkawa ne at '''ma''' seseya.'' 'Leave the water to cool.'
|-
| '''pal'''
| '(in order) to', 'for...to'
| purpose
| 
* ''Ne tujtutut welit patanit '''pal''' kitemuat takwal.'' 'Birds are able to fly in order to seek food.'
* ''Nalwikatuk ini '''pal''' tikwa.'' 'I have brought this for you to eat.'
|-
| '''(a)su'''
| 'if'
| condition, indirect question
| 
* '''''Su''' te nitekiti, te tiawit titakwat.'' 'If I do not work we will not eat.'
* ''Shiktajtanili '''su''' weli metzmaka chiupi at.'' 'Ask her if she can give you some water.'
|-
| '''kwak'''
| 'when'
| time clause
| 
* '''''Kwak''' niajsik, te nemituya aka.'' 'When I arrived, there wasn't anybody there.'
|}

Relative clauses, which always follow (rather than precede) their head, may be simply juxtaposed clauses, or introduced by the article ''ne'', the general complementizer ''ka'' or the interrogative pronoun ''ká'' (the last two being distinguished phonologically in various ways in the dialects). Headless relative clauses are introduced by interrogative pronouns.

==Lexicon==
===General===
As regards origin, the Pipil [[lexicon]] consists of the following components:

* The central component (by far the largest): native or inherited vocabulary, nearly all shared (with minor variations) with Mexican Nahuatl, though the lexeme pool is patently smaller than that of Classical Nahuatl)
* A small number of loans from surrounding indigenous languages
* Loans from Spanish, the proportion of which fluctuates depending on the speaker and register, and includes loans of varying antiquity and degree of integration
* [[Neologism]]s proposed by some speakers or writers based on extending the native vocabulary component
* Loans from Mexican Nahuatl varieties proposed by some speakers or writers

There exist mechanisms of native origin for the creation of derived and compound words. No doubt these were more actively used in the language's past, since some such mechanisms are only attested in fossilized form. In more recent periods of the language, use of such procedures appears to have decreased, and with them the productivity of the procedures themselves.

===Ideophones===
[[Ideophone]]s are a distinct set of [[lexical item]]s, often denoting some process that is directly perceived by the senses (such as a kind of sound or visual experience), which enter into a special range of language-specific grammatical patterns. Nawat is one of many languages possessing such items and the associated patterns, which in this case are 'expressive' verb formations. The root form of a typical Nawat ideophone is a CVCV sequence, e.g., ''-chala-, -china-, -kelu-, -kina-, -kumu-, -kwala-, -tapa-, -tikwi-, -tzaya-, -tzili-, -tzutzu-''.  These roots are not words and only acquire full meaning when they enter into one or another of the derivational patterns for Nawat ideophones. Some at least are probably onomatopoeic in origin.

The four most common morphological patterns for such Nawat verb formations are the following (R represents the ideophone root, rR a reduplicated root without ''j''):

===Incorporation===

[[Classical Nahuatl]] is characterized by widespread use of the device of [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]]. This is a grammatical and lexical phenomenon found in different guises in many languages. The Nahuatl system is quite well known to linguists because it is often cited as an example in linguistic literature. 

Briefly, in incorporation a [[lexeme]] potentially representing one of a verb's semantic [[verb argument|arguments]] or [[adjunct (grammar)|adjuncts]], rather than forming a separate grammatical [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] is allowed to be attached directly to the verb itself thereby forming a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] verb. In Nahuatl this incorporated lexeme is prefixed to the verb.

In Pipil, examples of this kind of structure also occur. However, their use is far less widespread than in Classical Nahuatl, and the process is barely (if at all) [[productive]]. Therefore existing examples rather resemble ordinary [[lexicalization|lexicalized]] compounds. Furthermore, most of those used involve one of a specific, limited range of incorporating elements that show considerable [[grammaticalization]], and are therefore perhaps best viewed, in the Pipil context at least, simply as [[derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] prefixes.

The grammaticalization of these elements manifests itself in form, meaning and function. The Pipil forms of some of these incorporating stems are somewhat specialized phonologically; moreover, some of the forms used for incorporation no longer have corresponding full-word counterparts. 

Most of the narrow set of widely used incorporating elements belong to a single semantic set, that of body parts. While in some compounds the literal meanings of such elements subsists, in many others they only retain a broadly metaphorical sense, while in some it is quite difficult to perceive any particular meaning at all.

A selection of Pipil 'incorporation prefixes' with illustrations of some of their uses follows:

|}

===Other compounds===

Lexical stems may combine to form other kinds of lexical [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]]. Compounding mechanisms may still exist in the spontaneous language use of some speakers (to the extent that they still have spontaneous language use) but there is limited evidence for their natural, productive application. 

Where traditional compounds are concerned, much of what has beensaid about incorporation is equally applicable. In fact, the same lexical combining forms that predominate in incorporation verbs often reappear in other compounds. Since these tend to be monosyllables with a low level of semantic specificity, we may call them 'light elements' and the compounds they form 'light compounds'.

{| class=wikitable
|+ Some 'light' compounds

Compounds containing more than one 'heavy' lexeme are rather rarer, and when new ones are proposed it is perhaps most often in response to the pressure of Spanish, i.e., in attempts to find a 'native' equivalent to a Spanish word in order to avoid a loanword. In the following table, '%' preceding a word indicates a neologism (proposed by at least one native speaker).

===Loanwords===

When speakers fail to find an adequate word or expression in Nawat they may (1) employ a [[circumlocution]] (for example, they could call the kitchen ''kan titamanat'' '(the place) where we cook'), (2) [[loanword|borrow]] a Spanish word or expression (e.g., ''ne cosinaj'' 'the ''cocina' (kitchen)''), or (3) simply [[code-switching|code-switch]]. However, when we speak of [[loanwords]] we have in mind items of foreign origin that have become habitual elements of Nawat usage and may also have undergone adaptation as a result.

{| 
| width="50%" |
Spanish loans into Nawat include some very common words indeed, such as ''mas'' 'more' or ''pero'' 'but'. Some loans, particularly older ones, may adopt forms or meanings that differentiate them from their Spanish source, e.g., ''pelu'' 'dog' (Spanish ''perro''), ''mesaj'' 'table' (Sp. ''mesa''), ''noya'' 'grandmother' (from Spanish ''señora'' 'lady'). There are also cases where the source form or meaning has become less common or disappeared from contemporary Spanish usage (at least in the standard varieties) but lives on in Nawat, e.g., ''tumin'' 'coin, money' (older Spanish ''tomín''). In such cases as these, speakers may be unaware of a word's historical origin and simply view it as 'typical Nawat', even preferring it to a neologism created with an intention of greater 'authenticity'.
| width="50%"; style="background:#efefef;" |
* ''Tiut tiawit '''a ver''' su timuchiwa '''alegrar''' chupi.'' 'We'll go ''and see'' if you ''cheer up'' a little.'
* '''''Pero''' kenemej tesu mawiltia ka '''afuera''', muchijki '''entristecer'''.'' '' 'But'' in this way he didn't play ''outside'', he ''became sad''.'
* ''Nu'''amigoj igustoj''' na nikchiwa '''contar cuentos'''.'' 'My ''friend likes'' me to ''tell stories''.'
* ''Ashkan tiksajsakat chikwasen pual '''kushtal arroz'''.'' 'Today we'll carry a hundred and twenty ''sacks'' of ''rice''.'
* ''Musta tiu-tiawit '''hasta''' ne tatzinu.'' 'Tomorrow we'll go ''towards'' the south.'
* ''Tesu kimati katka ka ne isiwaw se '''brujaj'''.'' 'He didn't know that his wife was a ''witch''.'
* ''Ne musiwapiltzin yaja '''mas''' selek.'' 'Your daughter is young''er''.'
* ''Tay '''horaj''' tinemit?'' 'What time is it?' (literally 'What ''hour'' are we (at)?'
|}

With one possible exception (''pashalua'' 'go for a walk, take time off work' &lt; *pasyarua &lt; Spanish ''pasear'' + the non-productive verb suffix ''-ua''), verbs can only be borrowed into Nawat from other languages in an invariable form based on the Spanish [[infinitive]]. Such forms cannot be conjugated directly. Instead, they must be preceded by the Nawat verb ''-chiwa'' 'make, do' to form compound expressions, e.g., from Spanish ''escribir'' 'write' we have Nawat ''nikchiwa escribir'' (contracted to ''nikcha escribir'') 'I write' (literally 'I do ''escribir' ''), ''tikchiwket'' or ''tikchijket escribir'' 'we wrote' (lit. 'we did ''escribir' ''), etc.

==Dialect variation==
===Dialects===
Pipil internal [[dialect]] variation is incompletely documented at present. While recognising the existence of important gaps in our knowledge (which may or may not ever be filled, as the last native speakers pass on), we do know of two well-defined dialect areas, at least as far as the department of Sonsonate is concerned, which may tentatively be called Upland and Lowland. The Upland dialect area includes the towns of [[Izalco]] and [[Nahuizalco]], the Lowland area those of [[Santo Domingo de Guzmán]] and [[Cuisnahuat]]. Present knowledge also includes some points of differentiation between Santo Domingo and Cuisnahuat. Thus for practical purposes we are chiefly able to speak of three known varieties: Izalco, Cuisnahuat and Santo Domingo.

===Phonological variation===
* The /k/ [[phoneme]] has [[voiced]] [[allophone]]s more frequently in Lowland, especially in Santo Domingo.
* Syllable-final /l/ (as in ''kal'' 'house', ''chiltik'' 'red') is sometimes devoiced; no clear dialect distribution can be formulated for this trait, however.
* Pre-consonantal /s/ following /i/ (as in ''mistun'' 'cat') is often [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]]; again no precise distribution can be stated.
* In some areas the evolution of secondary [[semivowel]]s described above for unstressed syllables also takes place in stressed syllables, the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] then falling on the vowel following the semivowel giving rise to word-final stress, e.g., /maltia/ 'bathes' → [mal'tja] (rather than [mal'tija]), and /kuat/ 'snake' → ['kwat] (instead of ['kuwat], ['guwat]). This feature has been attested for Nahuizalco and for the department of Ahuachapan, but a complete isogloss remains to be drawn.

===Morphological variation===
* The plural prefixes with a [[nasal stop|nasal]] element (''in(h)-'', ''kin(h)-'') tend to be avoided by some speakers in Santo Domingo, but this appears to be a new development.
* The sequence /nm/ in second person plural forms (''anmejemet'', ''anmu-'') is variously altered: ''amejemet'', ''amu-'', ''anhejemet'', ''awmejemet'', ''mejemet''...).
* For Izalco ''nikan'' 'here', ''ashan'' 'now, today', ''nemá'' 'later', ''kwakuni'' 'then' and ''ijkiuni'' 'like that', Santo Domingo has ''nin'', ''an'', ''nemanha'', ''kunij'' ([g-]) and ''kiunij'' ([k-]).
* 'What' and 'who':
{| class=wikitable style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"

! Izalco/Upland
! Cuisnahuat
! Santo Domingo
|-
! 'what'
| tey
| ta
| tay
|-
! 'who'
| ka
| ka
| gaj
|}
* There are many differences between the assignment of individual verbs to one or another [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] class, most noticeably affecting past tense formation.
* The verb ''yawi'' 'go' possesses both longer and shorter forms (e.g., ''niyaw'' versus ''niu, nu...''), but the latter vary between dialects.
* The verb ''-chiwa'' 'make, do' possesses full and short forms (e.g., ''nikchiwa'' versus ''nikcha''), but ''-cha'' is more general in Upland dialects.
* The verb ''-maka'' 'give' and derivatives (such as ''-namaka'' 'sell') are normally contracted to monosyllabic ''-ma'' in Upland speech.
* Some sporadic differences in verb [[valency (linguistics)|valencies]], e.g., in Izalco ''tajtani'' 'ask' is intransitive, in Santo Domingo transitive.
* General negative particle: Upland ''inte'', Lowland ''te(su)''.
* Miscellaneous differences in the forms of some words, e.g.
{| class=wikitable style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
! 
! Izalco/Upland
! Cuisnahuat
! Santo Domingo
|-
! 'arrive'
| ''asi''
| ''ajsi''
| ''ajsi''
|-
! 'tell'
| ''-ilia''
| ''-ilwia''
| ''-ilwia''
|-
! 'forest, country'
| ''kujtan''
| ''kujtan''
| ''kojtan''
|}

===Syntactic variation===
* Somewhat different periphrastic tense constructions are found in Upland and Lowland dialects.
* Izalco dialect often adds ''ne'' to subordinators, e.g., ''kwak ne'' 'when', ''kan ne'' 'where', ''tay ne'' 'what', ''pal ne'' 'in order for'.
*

===Lexical variation===
A few examples of inter-dialectal lexical differences follow:
{| class=wikitable style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"

! Cuisnahuat
! Santo Domingo

==Spelling systems==

Among the works published since the early twentieth century until the present in which the Pipil language is described or transcribed at any length, rarely do two authors fully coincide in the spelling conventions they use. The spelling system used in this article is that employed in recently produced materials associated with the Nawat language recovery initiative [https://web.archive.org/web/20100520015837/http://www.compapp.dcu.ie/~mward/irin/index.htm IRIN]. The following table allows this to be compared to with other spelling systems, ordered approximately in reverse chronological order.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22517">'''''Poste restante''''' ({{IPA-fr|pɔst ʁɛstɑ̃t}}, "remainder post") or '''general delivery''' is a service where the [[post office]] holds the [[mail]] until the recipient calls for it. It is a common destination for mail for people who are visiting a particular location and have no need, or no way, of having mail delivered directly to their place of residence at that time.

==By country==

===Australia===
Poste Restante is a long-established service within Australia run by the national postal service, [[Australia Post]], which allows you to have your post sent to a city-centre holding place. There your post will be held for up to 1 month and you can go in and collect it by providing a proof of identity, such as a passport.

For example, for the Adelaide GPO (General Post Office, i.e. the main post office in the city of [[Adelaide]]) you would address the letter or parcel to your recipient thus:

:Recipient's Full Name
:c/o Poste Restante
:GPO Adelaide
:SA 5001
:Australia

The recipient would then need to go to the Adelaide GPO at 141 King William St., Adelaide, SA to collect it when it was due to arrive or shortly afterwards.

===Belgium===
bpost uses the term Poste Restante (French), Postliggend (Dutch) or Postlagernd (German) which needs to be indicated on the post together with the name, optionally the first name, full name of the post office, postal code and city. The recipient has one month the time to collect the post after which it will be sent back to the sender. A special tax applies valued at the price of one stamp of value 2. As of 1st of March 2018 this price is 1,74 €. This tax is usually paid by the recipient but can also be paid by the sender.

:Name of the recipient
:Poste Restante
:Full name of the post office
:B-1234 City
:Belgium

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
In the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], mail is addressed to POSTE RESTANTE, which is written after the full name of the recipient (as appears on the [[Identity document|identification]] to be presented ID document or a passport, if abroad).

:Name of recipient
:POSTE RESTANTE

===Cambodia===
In [[Cambodia]], mail is addressed to POSTE RESTANTE, which is written after the full name of the recipient. Parcels and letters should contain a phone number, but recipients are more likely to get notified by phone for a parcel.

===Canada===
[[Canada Post]] uses the term "general delivery" in English, and "poste restante" in French. Travellers may use the service for up to four months, and it is also used in circumstances where other methods of delivery (such as post office boxes) are not available.

Canada Post guidelines for addressing of letter mail stipulate that general delivery mail should be addressed in the following fashion:
{{nowrap begin}}
:MR JOHN JONES
:GD STN A
:FREDERICTON NB&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;E3B 1A1
{{nowrap end}}
where GD is the abbreviation for general delivery (alternatively "PR" for “''poste restante''” in French), and STN A is the station or post office (in this case, Station A). When the mail is to be delivered to a retail postal outlet, then the abbreviation RPO is used, and in French the station is indicated by SUCC for “''succursale'',” or retail postal outlet by "CSP" for “''comptoir postal''”. In the above example, the French version of the address would use "PR SUCC A" for the second line.

===Croatia===
In [[Croatia]], mail is addressed to POSTE RESTANTE, which is written after the full name of the recipient (as appears on the [[Identity document|identification]] to be presented ID document or a passport, if abroad).

:Name of recipient
:POSTE RESTANTE
:12345 City

In Croatia letters received to ''poste restante'' address are kept in post office for 30 calendar days.

===Czech Republic===
In the [[Czech Republic]], mail can be addressed to the post office if "POSTE RESTANTE" and the full name of the recipient is included. The recipient gets the letter (or package) if he or she has a valid ID (ID, passport, driving licence). The mail Will be retained for only 15 days.

===Finland===
''Poste restante'' is offered in all post offices in [[Finland]].

The address is entered using the following format:
:Name of recipient
:Poste restante
:12340 City

Prior to April 1, 2013, it was also possible to use a nickname instead of real name and without providing an ID.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://itella.fi/group/english/current/2013/20130308_poste_restante.html |title=Itella Posti standardizes Poste Restante services to comply with international standards |access-date=20 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025052657/http://www.itella.fi/group/english/current/2013/20130308_poste_restante.html |archive-date=25 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service is offered at any post office. The only requirement is to add 'Poste restante' after the recipient's name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.laposte.fr/particulier/produits/article/recevoir-ses-courriers-et-colis-dans-le-bureau-de-poste-de-son-choix Recevoir un envoi en Poste restante - La Poste]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
[[Deutsche Post]] offer the service for all mail items under the ''Postlagernd''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.deutschepost.de/de/p/postlagernd.html|title=Der Service "Postlagernd"}}&lt;/ref&gt; (General Delivery) service. Domestic items may make use of a passphrase instead of the recipients name if preferred. As a general rule, the item should be addressed to the ''Hauptpost'' (main post office) of the location. Beware that some post employees may tell you that the service is no longer used and all Poste Restante mail is thrown out.

Address Format:
: Recipient Name
: Kennwort: &lt;passphrase&gt; ''(optional)''
: Postlagernd
: Post Office address
: Post Office postcode/town

The phrase ''Kennwort:'' (Password) in front of the passphrase requires the consignee to specify the passphrase at time of collection.
Items may be collected from the designated post office upon production of valid identification (e.g. Passport) and the passphrase.

It is important to use the term Postlagernd in preference to, or in conjunction with, Poste Restante to prevent returned mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLachlan|first1=Gordon|title=The Rough Guide to Germany|date=2004|publisher=Rough Guides|location=New York|isbn=184353293X|page=47|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-9rmBw1PIFcC&amp;pg=PA387&amp;lpg=PA387&amp;dq=poste+restante+germany&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V84Ue3xClH&amp;sig=rCPiW4TeKwBhGrevS3Zu6P88wmc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjb9pSstObJAhVEPBQKHWZdBUUQ6AEIWTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=poste%20restante%20germany&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(In Poland every post office is uniquely identified by city and number, e.g. "Warszawa 1" or "Kraków 35". These numbers are used only when the post office itself is the point of delivery, e.g. mailboxes or ''poste restante''.) There is no address of a recipient on the envelope, and if no sender address is provided, mail is considered undeliverable after 14 days. Every [[Poczta Polska]] office is valid target for ''poste restante'' delivery and the service is provided with no additional cost.

:1234 City

In Slovenia letters received for a ''poste restante'' address are kept in post office for 15 calendar days.

===Spain===
Mail can also be received at Spanish Post Offices. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xol.co.uk/spain/receiving-letters-parcels-in-spain.html]&lt;/ref&gt; There is normally no charge for the service. Poste Restante letters should be addressed Lista de Correos, followed by the address of the post office (including the post code, town and province). Put your surname in capitals. An example Lista de Correos address is:

:John SMITH
:Lista de Correos
:Pl. Rosa dels Vents 9
:46730 Gandia
:Valencia
:Spain

To find the address of the Correos nearest to you check at [http://www.correos.es www.correos.es]. Click on the '''Oficinas''' link for the Localizador de Oficinas.

When collecting mail from the post office you will need to show some form of identification such as a passport or photo driving licence. Specify that you are collecting a Lista de Correos item as these are stored separately from the other stored mail. The Lista de Correos mail is filed alphabetically and it may be worth asking them to check if an expected package was filed under your first name if they cannot find it under your surname. Post offices vary in how long they will hold your mail. 

When addressing mail for Spain, always ensure there is a return address on the parcel or packet.

===Sweden===
Not all post offices offer ''poste restante''. The address is entered using the following format:
:Name of recipient
:Poste Restante
:123 45 City
Here, 123 45 represents the postal number of the post office. Post offices providing ''poste restante'' services can be located by searching for ''poste restante'' as "street address" in a given city (giving you a postal number) and then searching for post offices with that postal number.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.postnord.se/ta-emot/hantera-post/poste-restante]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In [[Switzerland]], all post offices offer ''poste restante'' for free for up to one month. Addressing takes the following format:

:Name of recipient
:Poste restante
:[street/n° of the preferred post office]
:1234 City

Here, 1234 represents the postal number of the post office. The correct street address can be found online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.post.ch/en/private/receiving-mail/private-specify-receipt-location/poste-restante-consignments post.ch - Post restante consignments]&lt;/ref&gt;

:116 Upper Street
:London N1 1AE

If only addressed to a town name, for example “POSTE RESTANTE, LONDON”, mail will go to the closest main post office branch (there being more than a hundred ''crown offices'' &amp;ndash; directly-managed post office branches &amp;ndash; in London&lt;ref name="parliament"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070518/debtext/70518-0013.htm|title=House of Commons Written Answers|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=2007-05-18|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|publisher=HC Deb.  (vol.460) c.956|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some small branches do not offer the poste restante service.

The sender should also include their return address. In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Royal Mail]] will hold mail posted from within the UK for two weeks,&lt;ref name="postoffice.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postoffice.co.uk/mail/poste-restante|title=Poste Restante - Pick up your post whilst in the UK|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|website=www.postoffice.co.uk|publisher=The Post Office|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas mail posted from abroad is normally held for one month.&lt;ref name="postoffice.co.uk" /&gt; If the recipient is at sea however, it will be held for two months.&lt;ref name="royalmail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/content3?mediaId=80600750&amp;catId=600012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5rfVCxgsH?url=http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/content3?mediaId=80600750&amp;catId=600012|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-08-01|title=Royal Mail: poste restante|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=2010-01-08|website=www.royalmail.com|publisher=Royal Mail Group Ltd|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where mail is not collected within that time, it will be returned to the sender, or if there is no sender indicated, will be treated as undeliverable. If the sender would like uncollected mail returned sooner, they can indicate this on the envelope. Timescales vary from country to country according to local practice.

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the [[U.S. Postal Service]] uses the term '''General Delivery'''.  Mail for general delivery to recipients in the United States is addressed in the following fashion:&lt;ref name="261format"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/28c2_033.htm | title = Publication 28 - Postal Addressing Standards | at = Section 261 | author = United States Postal Service |date=January 2013 | accessdate = 20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;MRS. JANE Q. SMITH
GENERAL DELIVERY
WASHINGTON, DC&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20090&amp;#8209;9999
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

General delivery is normally available at only one facility under the administration of a post office with multiple facilities. Post offices that hold mail for general delivery may hold such mail for up to 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/508.htm#wp1052038 | title = Domestic Mail Manual 508 | at = Section 6 | author = United States Postal Service | accessdate = 18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When sending to general delivery, the optional [[ZIP Code#ZIP+4|add-on code]] is ''-9999''.&lt;ref name="261format" /&gt;

{{for|the system of rock mass classification|Q-system (geotechnical engineering)}}
{{for|the genetic method|Q-system (genetics)}}
'''Q-systems''' are a method of [[directed graph]] transformations according to given [[grammar]] rules, developed at the [[Université de Montréal]] by [[Alain Colmerauer]] in 1967--70 for use in [[natural language processing]]. The Université de Montréal's [[machine translation]] system, [[TAUM system|TAUM-73]], used the Q-Systems as its language formalism.

The data structure manipulated by a Q-system is a [[Q-graph]], which is a directed acyclic graph with one entry node and one exit node, where each arc bears a [[labelled ordered tree]]. An input sentence is usually represented by a linear Q-graph where each arc bears a word (tree reduced to one node labelled by this word). After analysis, the Q-graph is usually a bundle of 1-arc paths, each arc bearing a possible analysis tree. After generation, the goal is usually to produce as many paths as desired outputs, with again one word per arc.  

A Q-System consists of a sequence of [[Q-treatments]], each being a set of [[Q-rules]], of the form &lt;matched_path&gt; == &lt;added_path&gt; [&lt;condition&gt;]. The Q-treatments are applied in sequence, unless one of them produces the empty Q-graph, in which case the result is the last Q-graph obtained. The three parts of a rule can contain variables for labels, trees, and forests. All variables after "==" must appear in the &lt;matched_path&gt; part. Variables are local to rules.

A Q-treatment works in two steps, addition and cleaning. It first applies all its rules exhaustively, using [[Instance (computer science)|instantiation]] (one-way unification), thereby adding new paths to the current Q-graph (added arcs and their trees can be used to produce new paths). If and when this addition process halts, all arcs used in some successful rule application are erased, as well as all unused arcs that are no more on any path from the entry node to the exit node. Hence, the result, if any (if the addition step terminates), is again a Q-graph. That allows several Q-Systems to be chained, each of them performing a specialized task, together forming a complex system. For example, TAUM 73 consisted of fifteen chained Q-Systems.

An extension of the basic idea of the Q-Systems, namely to replace instantiation by [[Unification (computer science)|unification]] (to put it simply, allow "new" variables in the right hand side part of a rule, and replace parametrized labelled trees by logical terms) led to [[Prolog]], designed by [[Alain Colmerauer]] and [[Philippe Roussel]] in 1972. Refinements in the other direction (reducing non-determinism and introducing typed labels) by [[John Chandioux]] led to [[GramR]], used for programming METEO from 1985 onward.

In 2009, Hong Thai Nguyen of GETALP [http://getalp.imag.fr GETALP], [http://liglab.fr LIG] (Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble) reimplemented the Q-language in C, using ANTLR to compile the Q-systems and the Q-graphs, and an algorithm proposed by Christian Boitet (as none had been published and sources of the previous Fortran implementation had been lost). That implementation was corrected, completed and extended (to labels using Unicode characters and not only the printable characters of the CDC6600 of the historical version) by David Cattanéo in 2010-11.

'''Quantity take-offs''' '''(QTO)''' are a detailed measurement of materials and [[Manual labour|labor]] needed to complete a construction project.  They are developed by an estimator during the preconstruction phase.  These [[measurement]]s are used to format a bid on the scope of [[construction]].  Estimators review [[drawing]]s, [[Specification (technical quantity standard)|specifications]], and [[Building information modeling|models]] to find these quantities.  Experienced estimators have developed procedures to help them quantify their work.  Many programs have been developed to aid in the efficacy of these processes.

'''As defined by Holm, Schaufelberger, Griffin and Cole:'''
 
The QTO is the most tedious and time-consuming part of the lump-sum estimating process.  An extensive search is made for the measurements are needed to calculate the various valuable quantities that will be used for construction and pricing in a later phase of the estimating faster process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wickipedia for google serch in put of quantity takeoff book

Pronouns, nouns, adjectives and some numerals [[declension|decline]] (change the word ending to reflect case, the grammatical category and function) whereas verbs [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] for person and tense. As in other Slavic languages, the basic word order is [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO), but the declensions show sentence structure and so word order is not as important as in more analytic languages, such as English or Chinese. Deviations from the standard SVO order are stylistically marked and may be employed to convey a particular emphasis, mood or overall tone, according to the intentions of the speaker or writer. Often, such deviations will sound literary, poetical or archaic.

Nouns have three [[grammatical gender]]s (masculine, feminine and neuter) that correspond, to a certain extent, with the word ending so most nouns with -a are feminine, -o and -e neuter, and the rest mostly masculine but with some feminine. The grammatical gender of a noun affects the morphology of other parts of speech (adjectives, pronouns, and verbs) attached to it. Nouns are declined into seven cases: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[vocative case|vocative]], [[locative case|locative]], and [[instrumental case|instrumental]].

Verbs are divided into two broad classes according to their [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], which can be either ''perfective'' (signifying a completed action) or ''imperfective'' (action is incomplete or repetitive). There are seven tenses, four of which (present, perfect, future I and II) are used in contemporary Serbo-Croatian, and the other three (aorist, imperfect and pluperfect) used much less frequently. The pluperfect is generally limited to written language and some more educated speakers, and the aorist and imperfect are considered stylistically marked and rather archaic. However, some nonstandard dialects make considerable (and thus unremarked) use of those tenses.

All Serbo-Croatian lexemes in this article are spelled in accented form in the [[Gaj's Latin Alphabet|Latin alphabet]] as well as in both accents ([[Ijekavian]] and [[Ekavian]], with Ijekavian bracketed) when these differ (see [[Serbo-Croatian phonology]].)

==Morphology==
Serbo-Croatian makes a distinction between three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, instrumental) and two numbers (singular and plural).

===Nouns===

Serbo-Croatian has three main declensional types, traditionally called a-type, e-type and i-type respectively, according to their genitive singular ending.

====a-type nouns====
This type reflects [[Proto-Slavic]] o-stems, and is characterized by the endings (-o), (-e), or zero (-Ø) in the nominative singular, and (-a) in genitive singular. It includes most of the masculine and all of the neuter nouns. 

The category of [[animacy]] is important for choosing of accusative singular of o-stems, and of personal pronouns. Animate nouns have the accusative case like the genitive, and inanimate nouns have the accusative case like the nominative. This is also important for adjectives and numerals that agree with masculine nouns in case.

This type has two sets of case endings: one for masculine, and the other for neuter gender:

{{col-end}}
The zero ending -Ø is for masculine nouns that end in consonant in nominative singular. Most masculine monosyllabic and some bisyllabic words receive an additional suffix -ov- or -ev- throughout the plural (''bor – borovi'' 'pine', ''panj – panjevi'' 'stump').

The choice of -o- and -e- endings in the nominative, vocative and instrumental singular, as well as the plural suffix -ov-/-ev-, is governed by the stem-final consonant: if it is a "soft" (chiefly [[palatal consonant|palatal]] consonant – ''c, č, ć, đ, j, lj, nj, š, ž, št'', and sometimes ''r''), -e- endings are used, and -o endings otherwise; however, there are exceptions.

Some loanwords, chiefly of French origin, preserve the ending vowel (-e, -i, -o, -u) as part of the stem; those ending in -i receive an additional epenthetic -j- suffix in oblique cases: ''kàfē – kafèi'' 'café', ''pànō – panòi'' 'billboard', ''kànū – kanùi'' 'canoe', ''tàksi – taksiji'' 'taxi'. They are always of masculine gender; loanwords ending in -a are typically of the [[#e-type nouns|e-declension class]] (feminine); neuter nouns are basically a [[closed class]].

=====Masculine nouns=====
Masculine nouns belonging to this declension class are those that are not [[hypocorism]]s, and do not end in -a, which undergo e-type declension.

According to the nominative singular forms they are divided in two classes:
# nouns having the zero ending -Ø in nominative singular (twelve declensional patterns)
# nouns having the ending -o or -e in nominative singular (two declensional patterns)

====Neuter nouns====
Neuter nouns end in -''o'', -''e'' and -''∅''.

=====Neuter nouns ending in -''o''=====
The final ''o'' is always a suffix. Nouns which have at least two consonants (except ''st'' and ''zd'') before the final ''o'' have disappearing ''a'' in genitive plural.

Nouns ''čȕdo'' "miracle", ''kȍlo'' "wheel", ''nȅbo'' "sky", ''tijêlo'' "body" and ''ȕho'' "ear", in addition to parisyllabic form plurals without disappearing ''a'', have non-parisyllabic plurals formed by appending -''es''- to the base. These plurals are used differently. The nominative plural of ''ȕ'''h'''o'' is ''u'''š'''èsa'', and the nominative plural of ''t'''ijê'''lo'' is ''t'''je'''lèsa''.

=====Neuter nouns ending in -''e''=====
The final ''e'' can be a suffix, so the noun is parisyllabic, and it can belong to the noun base, in which case the noun is not parisyllabic. The noun is parisyllabic if it ends with -''je'' (except ''jáje'' in singular), -''lje'', -''nje'' (except ''jȁnje''), -''će'', -''đe'', -''ce'' (except ''pȕce'' and ''tùce''), -''šte'', -''šće'' or -''žđe''. The nouns ''môre'' and ''tlȅ'' are also parisyllabic. If a noun has at least two consonants before the final ''e'', it has a disappearing ''a'' in genitive plural. This is not the case if the noun ends with -''šte'', -''šće'', -''žđe'' or -''je''. Nouns representing living things do not have plural forms, but their plurality is marked with a collective noun formed with -''ād'' (''téle'', n. sg. ''[[singulare tantum]]'' → ''tȅlād'', f. sg. ''singulare tantum'') or by using a noun formed with -''ići'' (''pȉle'', n. sg. ''singulare tantum'' → ''pȉlići'', m. pl.). The noun ''dijéte'' "child" is a ''singulare tantum'' and uses the collective noun ''djèca'', f. sg. ''singulare tantum'', but plural with verbs, instead of a plural form.

Some nouns appear only in the plural form and do not have a singular variant (see [[plurale tantum]]). The gender of these nouns is either feminine (e.g. ''hlače'' "trousers", ''gaće'' "pants", ''grudi'' "chest") or neuter (e.g. ''kola'' "car", ''leđa'' "back", ''usta'' "mouth").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Tatarin |editor1-first=Milovan |title=Zavičajnik: zbornik Stanislava Marijanovića: povodom sedamdesetogodišnjice života i četrdesetpetogodišnjice znanstvenoga rada |publisher=Sveučilište Josipa Jurja Strossmayera, Filozofski fakultet |pages=192–193 |language=Serbo-Croatian |chapter=Gramatička kategorija broja |trans-chapter=Grammatical category of number |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426600.GRAMATICKA_KATEGORIJA_BR.PDF |deadurl=no |location=Osijek |year=2005 |isbn=953-6456-54-0 |oclc=68777865 |archivedate=24 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A9uQMyk4 |accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Note: animate objects (people and animals) are treated differently in the singular masculine accusative. In this case, it is the same as singular masculine genitive. It is considered accusative even though it looks like the genitive. Example: ''Vidim velikog psa'' ("I see a big dog").
* Note: most adjectives ending in consonant-'a'-consonant (for example: ''dobar'', "good"), the 'a' disappears when any letter is added. ''Dobar'' becomes, for example, ''dobri, dobra, dobrog, dobru, dobrim, dobrom, dobre'', and ''dobrih'', according to case and number.

===Verbs===
Like those of other Slavic languages, Serbo-Croatian verbs have a property of [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]: the ''perfective'' and the ''imperfective''. Perfective indicates an action that is completed or sudden, while the imperfective denotes continuous, repeated, or habitual action. Aspect compensates for a relative lack of tenses compared with e.g. Germanic or Romance languages: the verb already contains the information whether the action is completed or lasting, so there is no general distinction between continuous and perfect tenses.

Slavic verbs in general are characterized by a relatively low number of stems, from which a wide variety of meanings is achieved by prefixation.

====Tense====
The [[Realis mood|indicative]] has seven tenses: [[Present tense|present]], [[Past tense|past]], [[Future tense|futures]] I and II, [[pluperfect]], aorist and imperfect. The latter two are not used often in daily speech (more often in Bosnia and Herzegovina than in Croatia and Serbia), especially the imperfect. The present, aorist, and imperfect are inflected, the other tenses are [[periphrastic]]:

* Past uses the present of ''biti'' ("to be") plus the perfect participle, e.g. ''radio sam'' (or ''sam radio'', order depending on the sentence).
* Future I uses the (reduced) present of ''htjeti'' ("will" or "to want") plus the infinitive, e.g. ''ćemo kuhati'' (or ''kuhat ćemo'', in which case the ''-i'' of the infinitive marker ''-ti'' is elided).
* Future II uses the perfective future of ''biti'' (the only verb with a simple future) plus the perfect participle, e.g. ''budu išli''.
* Pluperfect, which is not often used, uses the composite past tense of ''biti'' plus the perfect participle, e.g. ''bio sam došao'', or (archaic) imperfect of ''biti'' plus the participle, e.g. ''bijah došao''

Future tense can also be formed with (reduced) present of ''хтети'' plus the conjunction ''да'' and the present of the main verb, e.g. ''ћеш да куваш'' in Serbian, but this form is incorrect in Croatian. Also, whereas in Croatian it would be "radit ćemo", in Serbian the "t" can be omitted and the verbs merged into "radićemo".

====Mood====

[[File:Snjezana Kordic, Serbo-Croatian, 2nd pub. 2006.JPG|thumb|200px|Book cover of [[Snježana Kordić]]’s Grammar book ''Serbo-Croatian'' 1st pub. 1997, 2nd pub. 2006 ([https://www.webcitation.org/6AE3FeWzm Contents])]] 
Besides the [[Realis mood|indicative]], Serbo-Croatian uses the [[Imperative mood|imperative]], [[Conditional mood|conditional]], and the [[Optative mood|optative]]. Imperative forms vary according to the type of the verb, and is formed by adding the appropriate morpheme to a verbal stem. The conditional I (present) uses the [[aorist]] of ''biti'' plus perfect participle, while conditional II (past) consists of the perfect participle of ''biti'', the aorist of the same verb, and the perfect participle of the main verb. Some grammars classify future II as a conditional tense, or even a mood of its own.

Optative is in its form identical to the perfect participle. It is used by speakers to express a strong wish, e.g. ''Živio predsjednik!'' 'Long live the president!', ''Dabogda ti se sjeme zatrlo!'' (an archaic and dialectal curse), etc. The optative may be translated into English by an imperative construction, with set phrases (such as the already exemplified 'long live'), or by use of the modal verb ''may''.

Some authors{{Who|date=May 2010}} suggest existence of [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] mood, realized as ''da'' plus the present of indicative, but most grammars treat it as present indicative.

====Aspect====
Verbal [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] is distinguished in English by using the simple or [[Continuous and progressive aspects|progressive]] (continuous) forms. 'He washed the dishes' indicates that the action was finished; 'He was washing the dishes' indicates that the action was ongoing (progressive). Serbo-Croatian, like all Slavic languages, has the aspect built into the verbs, rather than expressing it with different tenses.

To compare the meanings of the different aspects with verbal aspect in English, one should know three basic aspects: completed (may be called preterit, aorist, or perfect according to the language in question), progressive (on-going but not completed yet, durative), and iterative (habitual or repeated). English uses one aspect for completed and iterative and another for progressive. Serbo-Croatian uses one for completed and another for iterative and progressive.

Aspect is the most challenging part of Serbo-Croatian grammar. Although aspect exists in all other Slavic languages, learners of Serbo-Croatian who already know even one of several other Slavic languages may never learn to use aspect correctly, though they will be understood with only rare problems. While there are bi-aspectual verbs as well, primarily those derived by adding the suffix ''-irati'' or ''-ovati'', the majority of verbs not derived in such a manner are either perfective (''svršeni'') or imperfective (''nesvršeni''). Almost all of the single aspectual verbs are part of a perfective–imperfective pair of verbs. When learning a verb, one must learn its verbal aspect, and the other verb for the opposite verbal aspect, e.g. ''prati'' ("to wash", imperfective) goes with ''oprati'' ("to wash", perfective). The pairing, however, is not always one to one: some verbs simply don't have a counterpart on a semantic level, such as ''izgledati'' ("seem") or ''sadržati'' ("contain"). In others, there are several perfective alternatives with slightly different meanings.

There are two paradigms concerning formation of verb pairs. In one paradigm, the base verb is imperfective, such as ''prati'' ("to wash"). In this case the perfective is formed by adding a ''prefix'', in this case ''o'', as in ''oprati''. In the other paradigm, the root verb is perfective, and the imperfective is formed either by modifying the root: ''dignuti''→''dizati''  ("to lift") or adding an [[interfix]] ''stati''→''sta'''ja'''ti'' ("to stop", "to stand").

A pattern which often arises can be illustrated with ''pisati'', "to write". ''Pisati'' is imperfective, so a prefix is needed to make it perfective, in this case ''na-'': '''''na'''pisati''. But if other prefixes are added, modifying the meaning, the verb becomes perfective: '''''za'''pisati'' ("to write down") or '''''pre'''pisati'' ("to copy by hand"). Since these basic verbs are perfective, an interfix is needed to make them imperfective: ''zapis'''iv'''ati'' and ''prepis'''iv'''ati''. In some cases, this could be continued by adding a prefix: '''''po'''zapisivati'' and '''''is'''prepisivati'' which are again perfective.

====Conjugation of verbs====

There are three [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]] of verbs:
# 'a': almost all verbs that have this conjugation end in '-ati'.
# 'e': verbs ending in '-nuti' and all irregular verbs (as in the example below). Verbs ending in '-ovati', '-ivati' become 'uje' when conjugated (''trovati'', "to poison", is ''trujem'', ''truje'' etc.)
# 'i': almost all verbs ending in '-jeti' or '-iti' use this conjugation.

=====Auxiliary verbs=====

As in most other Indo-European languages including English, the [[Indo-European copula]] ('to be') is used as an auxiliary verb. It is universally irregular, because conjugations of two [[Proto-Indo-European|proto-forms]] ''*h1es-'' (&gt;English ''is'') and ''*bʰuH-'' (&gt;English ''be'') merged, producing mixed paradigms: the former being used in the present, and the latter in the other tenses. In Serbo-Croatian, however, there are two present forms surviving: ''jesam'' ('I am') and ''budem'' ('I be'). Because of that dualism, some grammars (chiefly Serbian ones) treat ''jesam'' as a [[defective verb]] having only present tense. Others treat these forms as two realizations of the same irregular verb ''biti'', ''jesam'' being imperfective and ''budem'' perfective.&lt;ref name=Tomic&gt;{{cite book| title=Balkan Sprachbund morpho-syntactic features |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFWOYUHULgsC&amp;pg=PA490 |author=Mišeska Tomić, Olga |page=490 |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4020-4487-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jesam'' has the following declension in the present tense. It has long and [[clitic]] (short) forms (without leading ''je''), while its negative form is written as one word, unlike other verbs (compare English ''is''–''isn't''). The short and the negative forms are used as auxiliary, while the long form is [[markedness|marked]].&lt;ref name=Tomic/&gt;

The [[copula (linguistics)|copulative use]] of the verb ''јеsam'' matches that of the verb "to be" in English (e.g. He ''is'' a student – On ''је'' učenik), of course, in the present tense only. The 'true' forms present of the verb ''biti'', (''budem'') have a limited use (in formation of the future exact tense, or in [[conditional clause]]s referring to the future, e.g. ''ako budem'' – ''if I am'').&lt;ref name=Tomic/&gt;

Verb ''biti'' is conjugated as follows:

=====Regular verbs=====

The conjugation system of [[regular verbs]] is rather complex. There are several classes of verbs distinguished according to certain features verbs within a class share.&lt;br&gt;
The verb is '''raditi''' (''To work'')

This paradigm applies to verbs such as:&lt;br&gt;
''vidjeti'' (to see)&lt;br&gt;''hodati'' (to walk)&lt;br&gt; ''pričati'' (to talk)&lt;br&gt; ''morati'' (must)

=====Irregular verbs=====
[[Irregular verbs]] are more complex to conjugate than regular verbs, for example the verb '''moći''' (''can, to be able to'')

===Adverbs===
{{Expand section|date=August 2017}}
Adverbs in Serbo-Croatian are, unlike nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns and numbers, and like prepositions, conjunctions, exclamations and particles, immutable words. Adverbs are, thus, immutable words given to verbs to determine the time, place, manner, cause, point and the amount of the action of the verb. There are seven types of adverbs in Serbo-Croatian:

====Place adverbs====

Place adverbs (''{{lang-sh|mjesni prilozi}}'') answer the questions where? (''gdje?''), to where? (''kamo?''), which way? (''kuda?''), from where? (''otkuda?, odakle?'') and to where? (''dokle?, dokud?'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Okuka |editor1-first=Miloš |editor1-link=Miloš Okuka |editor2-last=Schweier |editor2-first=Ulrich |title=Germano-Slavistische Beiträge: Festschrift für Peter Rehder zum 65.

:'''''gde/gdje?''''' (where)
::''ovde/ovdje'' (here),
::''n'''e'''gde/''n'''e'''gdje (somewhere),
::''n'''i'''gde/''n'''i'''gdje (nowhere),
::''igde''/''igdje'' (anywhere),
::''gore'' (up),
::''dole''/''dolje'' (down),
::''odpozadi''/''straga'' (from behind),
::''napolju''/''vani'' (outside)
::''blizu'' (close by);
:'''''kuda/kamo?''''' (to where)
::''ovamo'' (to here)
::''napred''/''naprijed'' (forwards)
::''nazad'' (backwards);
:'''''kuda?''''' (which way)
::''ovuda'' (this way),
::''kojekuda'' (''otišli su kojekuda'' - they dispersed),
:'''''otkuda?''''' (from where)
:: ''odavde'' (from here),
::''niotkuda'' (from nowhere),
::''izdaleka'' (from far away)
:'''''dokle?''''' (to where):
::''dotle'' (to here, also used as "in the mean time", ''dotle su oni čekali''),
::''donekle'' (up to a point).

====Temporal adverbs====

Temporal adverbs, or "vremenski prilozi", answer the questions when? (kada?), from when? (otkad?), until when? (dokad?). Examples are: '''kada''' (when) - sada (now), tada (then), nikada (never), ponekad (sometimes),uvijek (always), jučer (yesterday), danas (today), sutra (tomorrow), prekosutra (the day after tomorrow), lani (last year), večeras (tonight), odmah/smjesta (now/at once), zatim (then), uskoro (soon), napokon (at last); '''otkad''' (from when) - odsad (from now on), oduvijek (from always - oduvijek sam te volio - I have (from) always loved you); '''dokad''' (until when) - dosad (until now), dogodine (next year).

===Prepositions===
{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}

Each preposition has an assigned case. If an inflectable word follows a preposition, the word is declined in the same case as the preposition's assigned case.

Genitive prepositions:
::''od, do, iz, s(a), ispred, iza, izvan, van, unutar, iznad, ispod, više, poviše, niže, prije, uoči, poslije, nakon, za, tijekom, tokom, dno (podno, nadno, odno), vrh (povrh, navrh, uvrh, zavrh), čelo, nakraj, onkraj, krajem, potkraj, sred (nasred, posred, usred), oko, okolo, blizu, kod, kraj, pokraj, pored, nadomak, nadohvat, i, u, mimo, duž, uzduž, širom, diljem, preko, bez, osim, mjesto (umjesto, namjesto), uime, putem, (s) pomoću, posredstvom, između, (na)spram, put, protiv, nasuprot, usuprot, usprkos, unatoč, zbog, uslijed, radi (zaradi, poradi), glede, prigodom, prilikom, povodom''
Dative prepositions:
::''k(a), prema, naprama, nadomak, nadohvat, nasuprot, usuprot, usprkos, unatoč, protiv''
Accusative prepositions:
::''kroz, niz, uz, na, o, po, u, mimo, među, nad, pod, pred, za''
Locative prepositions:
::''na, o, po, prema, pri, u''
Instrumental prepositions:
::''s(a), pred, za, nad(a), pod(a), među''

Dynamic v. Static
Some prepositions fall in two or more cases. The ones that fall in both the accusative and locative cases, the preposition is accusative if it is dynamic and is locative if it is static. Dynamic means that the preposition shows motion while static does not.

Examples:
::''Ja idem u školu.'' I am going to school. (dynamic)
::''Ja sam u školi.'' I am in school. (static)

===Conjunctions and particles===

==Syntax==

===Word order===
Serbo-Croatian has a rich case structure that is reflected in the declension of nouns and adjectives. That allows for a great deal of freedom in [[word order]]. In English, for example, the word order shows a difference in meaning between "Man bites dog" and "Dog bites man". In Serbo-Croatian, ''Čovjek grize psa'' and ''Čovjeka grize pas'' have the same word order, but the meanings are shown by the noun endings. Any order of the three constituents is grammatically correct, and the meaning is clear because of the declensions. However, the usual order is subject–verb–object, as in English.

Serbo-Croatian closely observes [[Wackernagel's Law]] that [[clitic]]s (unstressed functional words) are placed in the second position in all [[clause]]s. The first element may be a single word or a [[noun phrase]]: ''Taj '''je''' čovjek  rekao'', "That man (has) said", or ''Taj čovjek '''je''' rekao'. Multiple clitics are grouped in the following fixed order:
# question word (only ''li''),
# verbs: clitic forms of "to be" except ''je'' (''sam'', ''si'', ''smo'', ''ste'', ''su'', ''bih'', ''bi'', ''bismo'', ''biste''), and of "will" (''ću, ćeš, će, ćemo'', and ''ćete'')
# dative pronouns (''mi, ti, mu, joj, nam, vam, im, si''),
# accusative pronouns (''me, te, ga, je, ju, nas, vas, ih''),
# the reflexive accusative pronoun (only ''se''),
# clitic form of the third-person singular present of "to be" (''je'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |year=2006 |origyear=1st pub. 1997 |title=Serbo-Croatian |series=Languages of the World/Materials ; 148 |location=Munich &amp; Newcastle |publisher=Lincom Europa |page=46 |isbn=3-89586-161-8 |oclc=37959860 |ol=2863538W}} [Grammar book].

===Relative clauses===
[[Relative clauses#Serbo-Croatian|Relative clauses]] are frequent in modern Serbo-Croatian since they have expanded as [[Grammatical modifier|attributes]] at the expense of the [[participles]] performing that function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |year=1995 |language=Serbo-Croatian |title=Relativna rečenica|trans-title=Relative Clauses |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426507.Kordic_Relativna_recenica.pdf |deadurl=no |series=Znanstvena biblioteka Hrvatskog filološkog društva ; 25 |location=Zagreb |publisher=Matica hrvatska &amp; Hrvatsko filološko društvo |pages=277–281 |isbn=953-6050-04-8 |oclc=37606491 |lccn=97154457 |ol=2863536W |archivedate=8 July 2012 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/690B8xaDu |accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frequency of relativizers.jpg|thumb|320px|Frequency of [[relativizer]]s]]

The most frequent [[relativizer]] is the [[relative pronoun]] ''koji''. It has the greatest range of [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedents]], which, however, are mostly nouns or personal pronouns. Nouns are the word class with attributes, and the relative clause is most frequently an attributive clause. The frequency of the [[Adjective|adjectival]] pronoun ''koji'' is greater than those relative pronouns that cannot have an antecedent noun (''tko'' ʻwhoʼ and the declinable type of ''što'' 'what'). Also, it occurs much more frequently than other adjectival relative pronouns: in comparison with their specialized semantic functions such as [[Possession (linguistics)|possessiveness]] (''čiji'' 'whose'), quality (''kakav'' 'what sort of') or quantity (''koliki'' 'how large'), the pronoun ''koji'' has the broadest scope of [[Reference#Linguistic sign|reference]] and identification with the [[referent]].

A '''skip distance''' is the distance a [[radio wave]] travels, usually including a hop in the [[ionosphere]].  A skip distance is a distance on the Earth's surface between the two points where [[radio waves]] from a [[transmitter]], refracted downwards by different layers of the [[ionosphere]], fall. It also represents how far a [[radio wave]] has travelled per hop on the Earth's surface, for [[radio waves]] such as the [[short wave]] (SW) radio signals that employ continuous reflections for transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpub.com/neets/book10/40f.htm|title=Skip Distance|accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propagation Path==

[[Radio waves]] from a particular transmitting antenna do not all get refracted by a particular layer of the ionosphere; some are absorbed, some refracted while a portion escapes to the next layer. At this higher layer, there is a possibility of this radio wave being bent downwards to earth again. This bending happens because each layer of the ionosphere has a [[refractive index]] that varies from that of the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/spp/military/docops/afwa/U3.htm|title=Radio-Frequency Communication|accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the differing heights of refraction, or [[apparent reflection]], the radio waves hit the earth surface at different points hence generating the skip distance.  Skip distance is greatest during the night when the ionosphere is the highest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2064">In [[newspaper]] editing, a '''slug''' is a short name given to an article that is in production. The story is labeled with its slug as it makes its way from the [[reporter]] through the editorial process. The [[AP Stylebook]] prescribes its use by [[News agency|wire]] reporters (in a "keyword slugline") as follows: "The keyword or slug (sometimes more than one word) clearly indicates the content of the story."&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press: 2008 Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law, {{ISBN|978-0-917360-52-7}}, p.404&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a slug also contains code information that tells editors specific information about the story — for example, the letters "AM" at the beginning of a slug on a wire story tell editors that the story is meant for morning papers, while the letters "CX" indicate that the story is a correction to an earlier story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscript.com/glossary.html "Newscript Glossary"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmediajournalism.com/bestpractices/besturls "Best Practices: URLs"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the production process of print [[Advertising|advertisements]], a slug or slug line, refers to the "name" of a particular advertisement. Advertisements usually have several markers, ad numbers or job numbers and slug lines. Usually the slug references the offer or headline and is used to differentiate between different ad runs.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the term slug derives from the days of hot-metal printing, when printers set type by hand in a small form called a stick. Later huge [[Linotype machine|Linotype machines]] turned molten lead into casts of letters, lines, sentences and paragraphs. A line of lead in both eras was known as a slug.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/11/24/whats-in-a-slug/|title=What's in a Slug?|last=Massey|first=Kyle|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13001">'''Stripping''' or bare argument ellipsis is an [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] mechanism that elides everything from a clause except one [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]].&lt;ref&gt;Hankamer and Sag (1976:409) may have introduced the term ''stripping''. They write that stripping is "a rule that deletes everything in a clause under identity with corresponding parts of a preceding clause, except for one constituent (and sometimes a clause-initial adverb or negative").&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs exclusively in the non-initial conjuncts of [[Coordination (linguistics)|coordinate structure]]s. One prominent analysis of stripping sees it as a particular manifestation of the [[gapping]] mechanism, the difference between stripping and gapping lies merely with the number of remnants left behind by ellipsis: gapping leaves two (and sometimes more) constituents behind, whereas stripping leaves just one.&lt;ref&gt;See Williams (1977:112 fn. 6) and Lobeck (1995:28) in this regard.&lt;/ref&gt; Stripping occurs in many languages and is a frequent occurrence in colloquial conversation. As with many other ellipsis mechanisms, stripping challenges theories of syntax in part because the elided material often fails to qualify as a constituent in a straightforward manner.

==Examples==
The following examples illustrate standard cases of stripping. The elided material is indicated using smaller font size and subscripts.

::Susan works at night, and Bill &lt;sub&gt;works at night&lt;/sub&gt; too.
::Why did Sam call, and &lt;sub&gt;why did&lt;/sub&gt; Bill &lt;sub&gt;call&lt;/sub&gt; too?
::Should I do it, or &lt;sub&gt;should&lt;/sub&gt; you &lt;sub&gt;do it&lt;/sub&gt;?
::Chris said yesterday that he knew it, and &lt;sub&gt;he said&lt;/sub&gt; today &lt;sub&gt;that he knew it&lt;/sub&gt; too.
::She asked the kids to stay, and &lt;sub&gt;she asked&lt;/sub&gt; the adults &lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;to stay&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; too.

Note the appearance of the additive particle ''too'' in these examples. Stripping is often marked by ''also'', ''as well'', or ''too''. Notice also the appearance of the coordinator ''and'' or ''or''. The coordinator's appearance marks coordination. Each time, the elided material appears in the non-initial conjunct of the coordinate structure. A trait that stripping shares with gapping is illustrated with the following examples:

::Should you call me, or &lt;sub&gt;should&lt;/sub&gt; me &lt;sub&gt;call&lt;/sub&gt; you. &lt;small&gt;- Object pronoun of gapping functioning as subject&lt;/small&gt;
::You are hungry, and me &lt;sub&gt;am hungry&lt;/sub&gt; too. &lt;small&gt;- Object pronoun of stripping functioning as subject&lt;/small&gt;

::She did it first, and him &lt;sub&gt;did it&lt;/sub&gt; second. &lt;small&gt;- Object pronoun of gapping functioning as subject&lt;/small&gt;
::She did it, and him &lt;sub&gt;did it&lt;/sub&gt; too. &lt;small&gt;- Object pronoun of stripping functioning as subject&lt;/small&gt;

Like gapping, stripping allows the object form of the pronoun (= [[disjunctive pronoun]]) to function as the subject in the stripped clause.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning object pronouns functioning as subjects, see Hudson (1989:63), Zoerner and Agbayani (2000:550), and Osborne (2006:330f.).&lt;/ref&gt; A second trait that stripping shares with gapping is shown with the following examples:

::I was helpful this time, and you &lt;sub&gt;were helpful&lt;/sub&gt; last time. &lt;small&gt;- Elided finite verb of gapping does not match antecedent verb.&lt;/small&gt;
::I was helpful this time, and you &lt;sub&gt;were helpful this time&lt;/sub&gt; too. &lt;small&gt;- Elided finite verb of stripping does not match antecedent verb.&lt;/small&gt;

::He laughs too much, and you &lt;sub&gt;laugh&lt;/sub&gt; too little. &lt;small&gt;- Elided finite verb of gapping does not match antecedent verb.&lt;/small&gt;
::He laughs too much, and you &lt;sub&gt;laugh too much&lt;/sub&gt; too. &lt;small&gt;- Elided finite verb of stripping does not match antecedent verb.&lt;/small&gt;

Like the gapped verbs, the stripped verbs in these examples do not match their antecedents in the area of verbal inflection.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning this mismatch in verbal inflection, see Hudson (1989:62), Zoerner and Agbayani (2000:551) and Osborne (2006:321ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that gapping and stripping are alike in these respects does indeed suggest that they are one and the same ellipsis mechanism.

==''Not''-stripping==
A particularly frequent type of stripping is ''not''-stripping. The remnant in the stripped clause is introduced by ''not'' and the entire sentence functions to correct a mistaken assumption in the preceding context. More often than not, the coordinator is omitted:

::Sam solved the problem, not Bill &lt;sub&gt;solved the problem&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;small&gt;- ''not''-stripping&lt;/small&gt;
::She smiled at me first, &lt;sub&gt;she smiled&lt;/sub&gt; not at you &lt;sub&gt;first&lt;/sub&gt;. - &lt;small&gt;''not''-stripping&lt;/small&gt;
::Susan gave me some advice, &lt;sub&gt;Susan gave&lt;/sub&gt; not you &lt;sub&gt;some advice&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;small&gt;- ''not''-stripping with ambiguity&lt;/small&gt;
::Susan gave me some advice, not you &lt;sub&gt;gave me some advice&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;small&gt;- ''not''-stripping with ambiguity&lt;/small&gt;
::He gave it to Smeagol for his birthday, &lt;sub&gt;he gave it&lt;/sub&gt; not to Deagol &lt;sub&gt;for his birthday&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;small&gt;- ''not''-stripping&lt;/small&gt;

A noteworthy aspect of ''not''-stripping is the position of ''not''. In the full versions of these sentences (i.e. without stripping), ''not'' cannot appear in the positions shown. When stripping occurs, the ''not'' must immediately precede the one remnant. Given this observation, one might conclude that stripping does not really involve ellipsis at all, but rather something else is going on. This conclusion is undermined by further facts. One of these facts is that the behavior of ''not'' is the same in cases of ''not''-gapping:&lt;ref&gt;See Hudson (1976:545) for similar examples of ''not''-gapping.&lt;/ref&gt;

::She asked him out, not him &lt;sub&gt;asked&lt;/sub&gt; her &lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;small&gt;- ''not''-gapping&lt;/small&gt;
::Sam should read Susan's paper, not Susan &lt;sub&gt;should read&lt;/sub&gt; Sam's. &lt;small&gt;-''not''-gapping&lt;/small&gt;

These examples of ''not''-gapping suggest two things: that ''not''-stripping, and thus stripping in general, is indeed a particular manifestation of the gapping mechanism and that ''not''-stripping is also indeed ellipsis, since the ellipsis analysis of ''not''-gapping is the only plausible analysis. The aspect of ''not''-stripping that remains mysterious concerns the obligatory position of ''not'' before the (first) remnant. One can note in this area that the gapping/stripping mechanism treats the negation in a special way in general. A negation cannot be included in the gapped/stripped material:&lt;ref&gt;See Hudson (1976:545) concerning this trait of gapping and stripping.&lt;/ref&gt;

:: *Fred did not ask Susan out, and Susan &lt;sub&gt;did not ask&lt;/sub&gt; Fred &lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;small&gt;- Failed attempt to include the negation ''not'' in the gapped material&lt;/small&gt;
:: *Fred did not ask Susan out, and Bill &lt;sub&gt;did not ask Susan out&lt;/sub&gt; too. &lt;small&gt;- Failed attempt to include the negation ''not'' in the stripped material&lt;/small&gt;

==Stripping or not?==
Like with gapping, delimiting instances of stripping from "normal" instances of coordination, i.e. from instances of coordination that do not involve ellipsis, can be difficult, as the following competing analyses illustrate:

:: a. Susan watches [Fox news] and [the weather channel]. &lt;small&gt;- Non-stripping analysis&lt;/small&gt;
:: b. [Susan watches Fox news], and [&lt;sub&gt;she watches&lt;/sub&gt; the weather channel too]. &lt;small&gt;- Stripping analysis&lt;/small&gt;

:: a. I like to read [Kafka] and [Schiller]. &lt;small&gt;- Non-stripping analysis&lt;/small&gt;
:: b. [I like to read Kafka], and [&lt;sub&gt;I like to read&lt;/sub&gt; Schiller as well]. &lt;small&gt;- Stripping analysis&lt;/small&gt;

:: a. Fred has stopped [complaining] and [obstructing our efforts]. &lt;small&gt;- Non-stripping analysis&lt;/small&gt;
:: b. [Fred has started complaining], and [&lt;sub&gt;Fred has started &lt;/sub&gt;obstructing our efforts too]. &lt;small&gt;- Stripping analysis&lt;/small&gt;

The brackets mark the extent of the coordinate structures. The distinction between the stripping and non-stripping analyses can be slight. Given a single intonation curve, the non-gapping analysis seems better, but if a pause occurs immediately before the coordinator (as marked by the comma) and an additive particle appears (e.g. ''too'', ''also'', ''as well''), then the stripping analysis becomes more plausible.&lt;ref&gt;See Zoerner and Agbayani (2000:551f.), Carlson (2002:54ff.), Osborne (2006:332).&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between the two analyses explains the ambiguity in the sentence ''Do you want coffee or tea?'':

:: a. Do you want [coffee] or [tea]? &lt;small&gt;- Non-stripping analysis; answer: Yes/No.&lt;/small&gt;
:: b. [Do you want coffee], or [&lt;sub&gt;do you want&lt;/sub&gt; tea]? &lt;small&gt;- Stripping analysis; answer: Coffee/Tea.&lt;/small&gt;

==Theoretical analyses==
As with most ellipsis mechanisms, theoretical accounts of stripping face significant challenges. The greatest challenge is to come up with a coherent explanation of the stripped material. The insight that the remnant of stripping is always a constituent is straightforward. The difficulties arise when one attempts to discern which individual constituents can and cannot be a remnant. For instance, why are the remnants in the following cases disallowed?:

:: *Larry has read the text, and &lt;sub&gt;he has&lt;/sub&gt; enjoyed &lt;sub&gt;it&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;small&gt;- Failed attempt at stripping&lt;/small&gt;
:: *Susan promised to read the page, and &lt;sub&gt;she promised to&lt;/sub&gt; copy &lt;sub&gt;it&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;small&gt;- Failed attempt at stripping&lt;/small&gt;
:: *An instructor flubbed the problem, and &lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; student &lt;sub&gt;flubbed the problem&lt;/sub&gt; too. &lt;small&gt;- Failed attempt at stripping&lt;/small&gt;

The remnants in these examples are constituents in [[constituency grammar]]s (= [[phrase structure grammar]]s), since every individual word is by definition a constituent in constituency grammars. These words are not, however, constituents in [[dependency grammar]]s, since they dominate other (elided) material. The constituency vs. dependency distinction is therefore one avenue that one might pursue to locate an explanation of such cases. If one chooses a constituency-based grammar, however, then the explanation might draw attention to the distinction between projection levels (see [[X-bar theory]]): the remnant must qualify as a maximal projection (as opposed to an intermediate or minimal projection).

Another avenue to explore for an explanation is to focus on the elided material (as opposed to on the remnant). In most cases, the elided material cannot be characterized as a constituent. It can, however, be characterized as a [[Catena (linguistics)|catena]].&lt;ref&gt;See O'Grady (1998) and Osborne et al. (2012) for discussions of the catena unit.&lt;/ref&gt; The following dependency grammar trees illustrate this explanation in terms of catenae. The elided material is indicated with a lighter font shade:&lt;ref&gt;Trees like those produced here can be found in many dependency grammars. See for instance Groß and Osborne (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

::[[File:E-strp-01.jpg|Acceptable stripping]]

The elided word combinations form chains (=catenae), that is, the elided words are linked together by dependencies in the vertical dimension. The word combinations ''do you want'' and he ''said...that he knew it'' are catenae. These two examples must be compared to the following two:

::[[File:E-strp-02.jpg|Unacceptable stripping]]

These sentences are bad, and one can explain their badness by acknowledging the status of the elided words as non-catenae; the elided words are not entirely linked together in the vertical dimension. The object pronoun ''it'' in the a-tree and the indefinite article ''an'' in the b-tree are not linked directly to the other elided material. This observation may explain why these attempts at stripping fail. The elided material should qualify as a catena.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="154050">'''[[Swahili language|Swahili]] [[grammar]]''' is typical for [[Bantu languages]], bearing all the hallmarks of this language family. These include [[agglutinative language|agglutinativity]], a rich array of [[noun class]]es, extensive inflection for person (both subject and object), [[Tense–aspect–mood|tense, aspect and mood]], and generally a [[subject–verb–object]] word order.

== Typology ==
Swahili may be described in several ways depending on the aspect being considered.
* It is an [[agglutinative language]]. It constructs whole words by joining together discrete roots and [[morphemes]] with specific meanings, and may also modify words by similar processes.
* Its basic word order is [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]]. However, because the verb is inflected to indicate the subject and sometimes also the object, this order may be changed to emphasise certain parts of the sentence.
* It has no [[grammatical case]] marking on the noun. Nominal roles are indicated by a combination of word order and agreement markers on the verb, with no change to the nouns themselves.
* It has a complex [[grammatical gender]] system, but as this does not include a distinction based on natural sex, the term "noun class" is generally used instead of "gender".
* It has [[head-first]] order with few exceptions.
* It is a [[pro-drop language]]. Verbs may be used without explicitly specifying the subject or the object with substantives (nouns or pronouns).

==Nouns==
===Noun classes===
Swahili [[noun]]s are grouped into '''[[noun class]]es''' based on the [[prefix]] they have, with each class having a prescribed number. For example, the nouns ''[[wikt:msichana#Swahili|wasichana]]'' "girls" and ''[[wikt:msimamizi#Swahili|wasimamizi]]'' "overseers" belong to class 2, characterised by the prefix ''wa-'', whereas ''[[wikt:kifuniko#Swahili|kifuniko]]'' "lid, cover" and ''[[wikt:kisukari#Swahili|kisukari]]'' "diabetes" belong to class 7, characterised by the prefix ''ki-''. The classes 5, 9 and 10 are frequently without any prefix. The numbers are based on the classes [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] for [[Proto-Bantu]], and have corresponding classes in the other [[Bantu languages]] which can be identified by the same system of numbers. Therefore, classes that are missing in Swahili create a gap in the numbering, as is the case with classes above 18 as well as classes 12, 13, which are absent in standard Swahili (although do frequently occur in non-standard varieties).

When discussing Swahili noun classes, it is important to distinguish between (1) ''morphological'' noun classes as a quality of the noun themselves indicated by morphological features (generally prefixes), and (2) ''syntactic'' noun classes as an agreement (i.e. concord) paradigm affecting the use of other words in the sentence. Here, "noun class" is used with the former meaning. Morphological and syntactic noun classes often diverge, especially when it comes to nouns referring to people and animals which do not belong to the morphological noun class 1/2, signalled by ''m-wa.'' For more information, see [[Swahili grammar#Concord|concord]].

The following noun classes exist:

# This ''m-'' before a consonant is always syllabic /m̩/, even when the following consonant is ''b'' or ''v'', as in ''mvulana'' "boy" [m̩.vu.ˈlɑ(ː).nɑ]. The ''mw-'' before a vowel, however, is not syllabic, as in ''mwalimu'' "teacher" [mwɑ.ˈli(ː).mu]. When the stem is only one syllable, the prefix takes the stress, as in ''mtu'' "person" [ˈm̩.tu]. Before a stem beginning with ''u'', the prefix may appear as either ''mw-'' or ''mu-'', as in ''mwuguzi'' / ''muuguzi'' "nurse". A few nouns, mostly loans, have ''mu-'' before a consonant, such as ''muziki'' "music", ''musuli'' "muscle" and ''muda'' "length of time" (although ''mziki'', ''msuli'' and ''mda'' are also widespread variations). In class 3, the ''w'' is frequently absent before ''o'' as in ''moyo'' "heart" (plural: ''mioyo''), ''moto'' "fire" (plural: ''mioto'') and ''moshi'' "smoke".
# ''Wa-'' is often present only as ''w-'' when the stem begins with /a/ as in ''[[wikt:wanafunzi#Swahili|'''w'''anafunzi]]'' "students" (singular: ''[[wikt:mwanafunzi#Swahili|'''mw'''anafunzi]]''). A following ''i'' may merge with the ''a'' of this prefix, forming ''we-'' as in ''[[wikt:wezi#Swahili|'''we'''zi]]'' "thieves"(singular: ''[[wikt:mwizi#Swahili|'''mw'''izi]]''). The ''a'' in this prefix is generally preserved in nouns which are derived from verbs, such as ''[[wikt:waandishi#Swahili|'''wa'''andishi]]'' "writer" (singular: ''[[wikt:mwandishi#Swahili|'''mw'''andishi]]'', from the verb ''[[wikt:andika#Swahili|-andika]]'' "to write"), as well as those derived from proper nouns, such as ''[[wikt:Waafrika#Swahili|'''Wa'''afrika]]'' "Africans" (singular: ''[[wikt:Mwafrika#Swahili|'''Mw'''afrika]]'') and ''[[wikt:Waislamu#Swahili|'''Wa'''islamu]]'' "Muslims" (singular: ''[[wikt:Mwislamu#Swahili|'''Mw'''islamu]]'')
# The ''ji-'' prefix occurs on nouns with monosyllabic stems, such as ''[[wikt:jiwe#Swahili|'''ji'''we]]'' "stone" (plural: ''[[wikt:mawe#Swahili|'''ma'''we]]''), but is absent from longer words. This is not to be confused with the augmentative prefix ''ji-'', which is not dropped in the plural, for example ''[[wikt:jiji#Swahili|jiji]]'' "large town, city" (plural: ''[[wikt:majiji#Swahili|'''ma'''jiji]]'', from ''[[wikt:mji#Swahili|'''m'''ji]]'' "town"). Some nouns may also simply have stems which start with ''ji-'' such as ''[[wiktionary:jina#Swahili|jina]]'' "name" (plural: ''[[wiktionary:majina#Swahili|'''ma'''jina]]''). Some words whose stems begin with a vowel take the prefix ''j-'', such as ''[[wiktionary:jambo#Swahili|jambo]]'' "thing, affair" (plural: ''[[wiktionary:mambo#Swahili|'''m'''ambo]]'') but others do not, such as ''[[wiktionary:azimio#Swahili|azimio]]'' "resolution" (plural: ''[[wiktionary:maazimio#Swahili|'''ma'''azimio]]'').
# The prefix ''ma-'' may merge with a following ''i'' to become ''me-'' as in ''[[wikt:meno#Swahili|'''me'''no]]'' "teeth" (singular: ''[[wikt:jino#Swahili|'''j'''ino]]'').
# The prefixes ''ki-'' and ''vi-'' may sometimes appear before vowels, such as in ''[[wikt:kiazi#Swahili|'''ki'''azi]]'' "potato" (plural: ''[[wikt:viazi#Swahili|'''vi'''azi]]'') rather than the possibly expected *''chazi'' and *''vyazi''. It is possible to regard the stem of these words as beginning with the ''i'' (e.g. ''-iazi'') as adjectives beginning with ''i'' simply take ''k-'' and ''v-'' prefixes in these classes.
# The ''n'' of the prefix is a prenasalising [[Consonant mutation|mutation]] of the following consonant and is never syllabic unless the noun would otherwise only have one syllable. It becomes ''m'' before ''b'' and ''v''. In stems beginning with ''w'' such as ''[[wikt:mbili#Swahili|-wili]]'' "two", this mutates to ''mb''. Before vowels it is present as ''ny''. Before ''d'', ''z'', ''j'' and ''g'' it is ''n''. ''L'' and ''r'' become ''nd''. Before other consonants, it disappears unless it needs to be syllabic to prevent the noun from having only one syllable, such as in ''[[wikt:nchi#Swahili|'''n'''chi]]'' "country, land". The plural form of class 11 nouns is formed this way, dropping the ''u-'' and then applying these rules (for example ''ulimi'' → ''ndimi'' "tongue" → "tongues", ''ukuta'' → ''kuta'' "wall" → "walls"), except that short nouns with a monosyllabic stem preserve the ''u-'' in the plural for reasons of stress, adding ''ny-'' before it to form the plural, such as ''[[wikt:uso#Swahili|'''u'''so]]'' "face", which becomes ''[[wikt:nyuso#Swahili|'''ny'''uso]]'' in the plural.
# The ''u-'' prefix has some variation in spelling and pronunciation before vowels.
# The ''ku-'' prefix becomes ''kw-'' only before a minority of stems: ''[[wikt:enda#Swahili|'''kw'''enda]]'' "to go" and ''[[wikt:isha#Swahili|'''kw'''isha]]'' "to finish".
# The locative classes of nouns no longer have their original ''pa-'', ''ku-'', ''m(u)-''prefixes in Swahili, with these only appearing on adjectives, demonstratives and other parts of the grammar. Most nouns form their locative form by adding the suffix ''-ni'' although this cannot be added to geographical place names, many recent loans and certain other words.

Every class up to 11 can be regarded as inherently singular or plural. Odd-numbered classes are singular, even-numbered classes are plural. The plural of a noun is normally formed by switching it to the next higher class. Thus, the plural of class 1 ''mtu'' "person" is class 2 ''watu'' "people". For class 11 nouns, the plural is in class 10. Class 14 usually has no plural at all, but in rare instances class 6 is used to form a plural for these nouns, for example ''ugonjwa'' "sickness, disease", ''magonjwa'' "diseases". Class 6 also contains a lot of nouns for liquids, such as ''maji'' "water", and other nouns derived from verbs such as ''mazungumzo'' "conversation(s)". Aside from these, there are some nouns in other classes that do not change class to indicate number, such as ''mchana'' "afternoon(s)", "daytime" (class 3), ''vita'' "war(s)" (class 8), ''usiku'' "night(s)" (class 14), and these can be shown as singular or plural only by surrounding context.

In terms of meaning, groups of similar nouns tend to belong to similar noun classes. For example, nouns for people, including [[agent noun]]s, are commonly in classes 1/2, while animals are often in classes 9/10. Nouns describing plants are in class 3/4 and if they produce fruit, it will probably be in class 5/6. [[Abstract noun]]s are often in class 14, loanwords in classes 9/10 and 5/6. Many nouns for liquids are in class 6. Infinitives/gerunds of verbs are in class 15. Diminutives as well as the words for many man-made tools and languages are in class 7/8. These are only generalisations and there are exceptions in most classes.

=== Concord ===
The class of the noun determines the forms of other parts of speech that relate to it, such as verbs, adjectives, etc. This process is called [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement or concord]]. These other parts of speech receive their own concordant prefixes (termed "concords" for short), generally matching in class with the noun, though the prefixes themselves are not always the same. In the examples below, the left and right sides of the table show sentences with a singular and then plural subject respectively.

Animate nouns in classes 9/10 may exhibit a slight aberration from this pattern. The genitive pronominal forms ''-angu'', ''-ako'', ''-ake'', ''-etu'', ''-enu'' and ''-ao'' are frequently inflected with a group of nouns referring to close human relationships with their appropriate class 9/10 concords, regardless of the fact that they are animate (giving ''yangu'', ''yako'', ''yetu'' etc. in singular and ''zangu'', ''zako'', ''zetu'' etc. in plural). For some speakers, the same rule applies to the simple genitive preposition ''-a'' (giving ''ya'' in singular and ''za'' in plural), however for most speakers ''wa'' is used for all animate nouns regardless of number or class. Other parts of speech are unaffected by this exception.

Another departure from the rule of animate nouns taking concords in classes 1/2 occurs on occasion with diminutives and augmentatives, whereby using concords of the class the noun belongs to (5/6 for augmentatives, 7/8 for diminutives) emphasises the dimunition or augmentation.

===Locative classes===

A [[locative case|locative]] noun is a derived noun that indicate a location associated with the base noun from which it is derived. The change in meaning can translate to a variety of English prepositions indicating location, such as "in", "at", "on", "to" or "from", and is thus quite general in meaning, with the exact meaning of the phrase generally being determined by the verb.

The Arabic loan noun ''mahali'' "place" (and its variations: ''pahali'', ''mahala'' and ''pahala'') is the only noun which inherently belongs to the locative class. Other nouns can be made locative by adding the suffix ''-ni'' to the end, although this is not available for proper nouns referring to places, any animate nouns, recent loanwords and some other arbitrary nouns.

Because locative nouns constitute three classes of their own, they cannot take the usual concords of the noun they have been derived from. The concords themselves show in which one of the locative classes the noun is being used. Class 16 is marked by concords based on ''pa-'' and indicates specific location. Class 17, with concords based on ''ku-'' indicates a more general location. Class 18 has concords based on ''mu-'' and indicates internal location.

* ''nyumba [[#Genitive_-a|'''y'''a]] Rehema'' "Rehema's house" (class 9)
* ''nyumba'''ni''' [[#Genitive_-a|'''kw'''a]] Rehema'' "at/to/from Rehema's house" (class 17)
* ''chumba [[#Genitive_-a|'''ch'''a]] Daudi'' "Daudi's room" (class 7)
* ''chumba'''ni''' [[#Genitive_-a|'''mw'''a]] Daudi'' "in/into/out of Daudi's room" (class 18)

=== Apposition / Compounding ===
The equivalent of compound words are usually formed using the [[#Genitive_-a|genitive construction]] such as ''mpira '''wa''' kikapu'' "basketball" (literally "''ball '''of''' basket''"). This is similar to the compounding process found in many languages such as French ''fin '''de''' semaine'' "weekend" (literally "''end '''of''' week''").

There are also many compounds which do not use the genitive preposition ''-a''. In these cases, two (or more) nouns are simply placed side by side.

The word order is the reverse of most compounds in English, with the head always preceding the modifiers in Swahili; in other words, the first noun describes ''what'' it is, and any subsequent noun narrows or specifies that description. For example, the class 9/10 noun ''punda'' "donkey(s)" is followed by the class 4 noun ''milia'' "stripes" to mean "zebra". Whereas in English, a hypothetical equivalent compound would place the noun for the stripes first and also require the singular: "stripe-donkey", the word for "donkey" appears first in Swahili.

There is a good deal of variation among different authors as to whether the nouns are written together, hyphenated or separated and thus the word for "zebra(s)" may appear as any of ''pundamilia'', ''punda-milia'' or ''punda milia''.

A few common compound words have irregular plural forms because number marking occurs on both elements. The word '''''mw'''ana'''m'''ke'' "woman" becomes '''''w'''ana'''wa'''ke'' "women" in plural. Similarly, '''''mw'''ana'''m'''ume'' "man" becomes '''''w'''anaume'' "men" in plural, although the singular form '''''mw'''anaume'' is also common. These two nouns are formed from the word ''mwana'' "son, daughter", which is commonly used in compounds to essentially mean "person", followed by the words ''mke'' "wife" (plural: ''wake'') and ''mume'' "husband" (plural: ''waume'') respectively.

==Pronouns==

Pronouns behave in many ways like nouns, having both plural and singular forms, being present in the full range of noun classes but no inflection for case, meaning that, for instance, there is no difference between ''we'' and ''us'', which are both ''sisi''.

===Personal pronouns===

Personal pronouns occur in two forms: an independent form, which is used as a word alone, and a combining stem, which is used when combined with words such as ''na'' "with, and" and ''ndi-'' "it is". The independent form consists, in all cases except for ''wao'', of a reduplication of a syllable. ''Nyinyi'', however, may alternatively be dissimilated to ''ninyi''.  These pronouns also have a separate genitive (possessive) stem, which is the combining stem that is used when a genitive prefix is added.

{| class="wikitable"

! Independent
! Combining

! Genitive&lt;br/&gt;suffix
!"all"
|-

| ''mimi''
| ''-mi''
| ''-angu''
|''&amp;mdash;''
|-
! 2nd sing.
| ''wewe''
| ''-we''
| ''-ako''
|''&amp;mdash;''
|-

| ''-ye''
| ''-ake''
|''&amp;mdash;''

|''(sisi) sote''
|-

| ''nyinyi, ninyi''
| ''-nyi''
| ''-enu''
|''(nyinyi) nyote''
|-
! 3rd plur.
| ''wao''
| ''-o''
| ''-ao''
|''(wao) wote''
|}

Note that the sex/gender of referents is not distinguished, with ''yeye'' capable of meaning either "he" or "she". These pronouns are, however, restricted to use with animate referents, i.e. people or animals, so it does not generally mean ''it''. The genitive form ''-ake'' has no such restriction and may mean "his", "hers" or "its" depending on context.

Swahili is a [[pro-drop]] language. As the verb usually already includes prefixes to indicate the subject and object, personal pronouns aren't strictly needed, and are mostly used for emphasis. The exceptions to this include cases when the copula ''ni'' (or its negative counterpart ''si'') is used, as well as with the habitual form of the verb, which lacks subject prefixes.

In informal speech, when pronouns are unstressed, they may appear in a reduced form, such as ''mi'' or ''mie'' for ''mimi''. This mainly occurs when the pronoun is not added only for emphasis, but is needed (e.g. ''mi ni'' "I am", informally), and this also frequently occurs where the first person singular subject prefix ''ni-'' is dropped in casual speech before ''-na-''. For example, standard ''(mimi) ninajua'' "I know" often occurs as (''mi) najua'' in spoken Swahili.

== Determiners ==
[[Determiner]]s in Swahili are capable of being used adjectivally (with a noun) or pronominally (standing in for an absent noun). The inflection of Swahili determiners resembles that of verbs.

===Articles===
There are no articles in Swahili. A word such as ''kitabu'' "book" may be taken to mean either "the book" or "a book" depending on context. If the distinction must be made demonstratives or adjectives may be used to provide various shades of meaning such as ''kitabu hicho'' "that (aforementioned) book", ''kitabu kimoja'' "one book", ''kitabu fulani'' "some (particular) book", ''kitabu chochote'' "any book (at all)".

===Demonstrative===

The demonstratives in Swahili may be used either as adjectives, with a noun, or as pronouns, standing alone. They occur in three types:
* Proximal ("this, these"), referring to something near the speaker. It is formed by prefixing the verbal concord with ''hV-'' where "V" stands for a vowel identical to the vowel of the next syllable.
* Distal ("that, those"), referring to something far from both speaker and listener. It is formed by suffixing ''-le'' to the verbal concord.
* Medial/Referential ("the aforementioned"), referring to something that has been previously mentioned. It may also refer to something nearer to the listener than the speaker. It is formed by replacing the final vowel of the proximal demonstrative with the ''o'' (with consonant changes such as ''ki'' becoming ''ch'' etc.).

There is one pronoun of each type for each noun class. There is also a combining form that appears suffixed on certain other words such as ''na'' and ''ndi-''. This combining form is identical to the relative marker for each class.

|-
! 18

|}

The demonstratives may stand alone, as true pronouns, but may also be used in combination with a noun, much like "this" and "that" in English. The demonstrative generally follows the noun but it can also precede. Before a noun, it often takes on a slightly more article-like role.

=== Other determiners ===
The words ''-ote'' "all", ''-o-ote'' "any", ''-pi'' "which" and ''-enyewe'' "-self", "-selves"'','' appear with prefixes following the verbal inflection pattern. In older texts, ''-o-ote'' was frequently written as two words (e.g. ''ye yote'', ''vyo vyote'') however it is now more frequently written together. For the sake of comparison, the following table also includes the genitive and ornative prepositions ''-a'' and ''-enye'' as well as the verbal subject prefixes for each class. Note that class 1 has the most irregularity and diversity of form.

# The 1st and 2nd person plural have their own forms for "all", namely ''sote'' and ''nyote''. These may be used with or without the pronoun: ''sisi sote'' or simply ''sote'' can mean "all of us", "we all". When used with the form ''wote'', the meaning is "both": ''sisi wote'' "both of us", "we both".
# The irregular form ''wepi'' is used to avoid clashes with the word ''wapi'' meaning "where".
# The word ''vipi'' may be used to ask "which" of class 8 nouns (eg. ''vitabu vipi?'' "which books?"), but, as is typical for class 8, can also be understood adverbially, following a verb to mean "how?".
# The usual word for "where" or "which place" is ''wapi'', however some sources list a regular form ''papi''.

==Adjectives==

The term "adjective", as applied to Swahili and most other Bantu languages, usually applies only to a rather restricted set of words. However, in the wider sense, it can refer to any word that modifies a noun. The wider sense is used here. Adjectives in the stricter Bantu sense are referred to as "true adjectives" in this article. True adjectives in Swahili may be divided into two categories: ''inflecting adjectives'', which take a prefix indicating the noun class of their referent, and ''invariable adjectives'', which do not take a prefix.

All adjectives have one thing in common: they all follow the noun they modify, and, aside from the plain adjectives, require some kind of prefix whose class matches the preceding noun. The different types of adjectives reflect the different prefixes that are used:
* Inflecting adjectives are true adjectives which are prefixed with an adjective concord.
* Plain adjectives are true adjectives which are do not take concord prefixes.
* Relatives are relativised verbs which can be used as adjectives.
* Genitives are phrases consisting of a noun introduced by the genitive preposition ''-a''.
* Ornatives are phrases consisting of a noun introduced by the ornative preposition ''-enye''.

===Inflecting Adjectives===

Inflecting adjectives are words which describe a noun or pronoun and take the following prefixes, which are very similar to the prefixes found on nouns. This distinguishes them from determiners, which take prefixes similar to those on verbs. The most notable departure from the nominal inflection pattern among inflecting adjectives is the replacement of the nominal ''u-'' prefix in class 11 (and generally also 14) with the adjectival ''m-'' prefix. The locative classes also carry prefixes, unlike the locative nouns they refer to.

Most inflecting adjectives have stems beginning with a consonant. Of those that begin with a vowel, almost all of these have stems that begin with either ''e'' (for example, ''-ekundu'' "red") or ''i'' (eg. ''-ingi'' "many, much"). A very small minority of adjectives begin with other vowels, but these happen to refer only to animate referents and thus only have forms in classes 1 and 2, for example: ''-ovu'' "evil, wicked", which is '''''mw'''ovu'' in class 1 and '''''wa'''ovu'' in class 2.

# The ''ji-'' prefix only occurs on the adjective ''-pya'' "new" in order to make sure it has more than one syllable so that the antepenult can be stressed.
# The ''N-'' prefix in classes 9 and 10 exhibits considerable variation. On adjectives with stems of more than one syllable, it only appears as a prenasalisation of the following consonants: ''b'' → '''mb''', ''d'' → '''nd''', ''g'' → '''ng''', ''j'' → '''nj''', ''l'' → '''nd''', ''r'' → '''nd''', ''v'' → '''mv''', ''w'' → '''mb''', ''z'' → '''nz'''. Elsewhere, it disappears. In addition, the monosyllabic adjective stem ''-pya'' "new" has the form ''mpya'', whereby the ''m-'' constitutes the stressed syllable.
# The adjective ''-ema'' "good, kind, nice" has the irregular form ''njema'' in class 9 and 10 instead of the expected form ''*nyema''.
# In modern standard Swahili, adjectives in class 14 take the prefix ''m(w)-'', however, in an earlier stage of the language, they took the prefix ''u-/w-'' which is still preserved in some idiomatic phrases but has otherwise disappeared, marking the almost complete merge of classes 11 and 14.
The adjective ''-ingine'' "other", is sometimes given inflections prefixes of the type found with determiners, following a verbal rather than a nominal pattern. Most notably, the forms '''''lingine''''' in class six, '''''ingine''''' or '''''yingine''''' in class 9 and '''''zingine''''' in class 10 may be heard. Some speakers also use an e in these classes:'' '''jengine''', '''lengine''', '''nyengine''', '''yengine''''' and'' '''zengine''''' sometimes occurring. These forms are regarded as non-standard, although they may be commonly heard. The standard forms of each are '''''jingine''''' for class 6 and '''''nyingine''''' for classes 9 and 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gromova|first=Nelly|date=|title=MASWALI MACHACHE YA USANIFISHAJI WA KISWAHILI (JINGINE AU LINGINE?)|url=http://www.qucosa.de/fileadmin/data/qucosa/documents/9466/15_09_Gromova.pdf|journal=Swahili Forum|volume=15 |year=2008|pages=115–120|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/878224907|title=Swahili grammar and workbook|last=Fidèle,|first=Mpiranya,|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781315750699|location=London|pages=37|oclc=878224907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The numerals ''-moja'' "one", ''-wili'' "two", ''-tatu'' "three", ''-nne'' "four", ''-tano'' "five" and ''-nane'' "eight", as well as all numbers that end with these words, take prefixes as inflecting adjectives do. 
* ''mtu '''m'''moja'' "one person", ''watu '''wa'''wili'' "two people", ''watu ishirini na '''m'''moja'' "twenty-one people", ''watu ishirini na '''wa'''wili'' "twenty-two people"
* ''kitabu '''ki'''moja'' "one book", ''vitabu '''vi'''wili'' "two books", ''vitabu ishirini na '''ki'''moja'' "twenty-one books", ''vitabu ishirini na '''vi'''wili'' "twenty-two books"
* ''nyumba moja'' "one house", ''nyumba '''mb'''ili'' "two houses", ''nyumba ishirini na moja'' "twenty-one houses", ''nyumba ishirini na '''mb'''ili'' "twenty-two houses"

=== Invariable adjectives ===
Invariable adjectives are mostly loanwords from Arabic, such as ''safi'' "clean", ''ghali'' "expensive", although loanwords from other languages are also present, such as ''faini'', from English "fine". Nouns placed as modifiers after other nouns may also be regarded as invariable adjectives, such as ''msichana kiziwi'' "Deaf girl", which has a class 1 prefix ''m-'' and a class 7 prefix ''ki-''. Numbers loaned from Arabic: ''sita'' "six", ''saba'' "seven" and ''tisa'' "nine", ''ishirini'' "twenty", etc., as well as the native Bantu number ''kumi'' "ten", function as invariable adjectives. The interrogative adjective ''gani'' "what kind of" or, colloquially, "which" is also invariable.
* ''watu tisa'' "nine people"
* ''vitabu tisa'' "nine books"
* ''nyumba tisa'' "nine houses"

===Relatives===

Relatives are verbs used as adjectives by being relativised using a relative prefix (or suffix) which agrees with the noun's class.

These are frequently used in Swahili and make up for the relative paucity of ''true adjectives''. For example, there are no true adjectives equivalent to the English adjectives "open" and "dead", however the verbs ''kufa'' "to die" and ''kufunguliwa'' "to be opened", when relativised, convey these meanings. Examples of this in use:
* ''ndege aliyekufa'' "dead bird" (bird which died)
* ''ndege waliokufa'' "dead birds" (birds which died)
* ''mlango uliofunguliwa'' "open door" (door which was opened)
* ''milango iliyofunguliwa'' "open doors" (doors which were opened)
* ''dirisha lililofunguliwa'' "open window" (window which was opened)
* ''madirisha yaliyofunguliwa'' "open windows" (windows which were opened)

===Genitive adjectives===
Another construction which makes up for the paucity of true adjectives in Swahili is the genitive construction using the [[#Genitive_-a|genitive preposition ''-a'']]. The prefixes that this preposition takes are outlined [[#Genitive_Construction|here]].

In many cases, the noun introduced in an genitive adjective phrase receives an additional ''ki-'' prefix, such as ''-a kimataifa'' "international" (from ''mataifa'' "nations") and ''-a kihistoria'' "historic" (from ''historia'' "history").

===Ornative construction===
Yet another construction which makes up for the paucity of true adjectives in Swahili is the [[Ornative case|ornative]] construction using ''-enye''. Some examples of adjectival phrases with ''-enye'' include ''-enye nguvu'' "strong" (with strength), ''-enye nywele fupi'' "short-haired" (having short hair), and ''-enye senta moja'' "concentric" (having one centre). The forms of ''-enye'' as well as some more examples of use can be seen [[#Ornative_-enye|here]].

==Verbs==
Like nouns, verbs are formed by adding prefixes to a basic stem. However, unlike the prefixes of nouns, verbal prefixes are not a fixed part of the verb, but indicate subject, object, [[Tense–aspect–mood|tense, aspect, mood]] and other inflectional categories. Normally, verbs are cited in dictionaries in the stem form, often with a hyphen to indicate that prefixes are added, such as ''-sema'' "say", ''-andika'' "to write", ''-la'' "to eat". It is also possible to use the infinitive/gerund form which begins with ''ku-'' or, for a couple of verbs only, ''kw-'', such as ''kusema'' "to say", ''kuandika'' "to write", ''kula'' "to eat".

===Overview of verb structure===

Prefixes are always attached in a fixed order; the object prefix always comes last, immediately before the verb stem, while the subject prefix comes before the object prefix. Most of the time, a tense, aspect, mood or polarity prefix may intervene between the subject and object prefix, or be placed before the subject prefix. A common mnemonic used by learners of Swahili for the order of parts of a verb is STROVE.

* '''S'''ubject prefix
* [[Tense–aspect–mood|'''T'''AM]] prefix (or usually '''T'''ense prefix)
* '''R'''elative prefix
* '''O'''bject prefix
* '''V'''erb stem 
* '''E'''xtension(s) (meaning "derivative suffix(es)"), or, more broadly '''E'''nding (including also the inflectional suffixes ''-i'' and ''-e'').

In learner materials, all types of prefixes other than the subject prefixes are frequently, erroneously referred to as [[infix]]es. It should, however, be noted that the term ''infix'', as used by linguists, refers only to a [[morpheme]] (≈ part of a word) that is inserted ''within'' another morpheme, not simply in between other morphemes within a word. Under the strict definition of the word, Swahili does not make use of infixes.

Here is an example of a verb with all slots filled:

There are a number of derivational suffixes (frequently termed 'extensions') which can be added to the end of verbs to derive new meanings, some of which have been shown above.

===Inflection groups===
There are three basic inflection groups which differ only very slightly from one another:
# '''common verbs'''
# '''short verbs'''
# '''loan verbs'''
'''Common verbs''' are the largest group of verbs in Swahili. In their infinitive form, they consist of three or more syllables and end with ''-a''. All verbs of native Bantu origin end with ''-a'', including the short verbs mentioned below. Some examples of common verbs are ''kuanguka'' "to fall", ''kufanya'' "to do, to make", ''kuona'' "to see", ''kuwaza'' "to think", ''kusaidia'' "to help". The final ''-a'' is replaced with another vowel in certain grammatical contexts, becoming ''-i'' in the present negative, and ''-e'' in the subjunctive and imperative forms involving an object prefix. The plural address marker ''-ni'' also triggers this final ''-a'' to become ''-e.''

'''Short verbs''' are those which, in their infinitive form, consist of only two syllables, such as  ''kula'' "to eat", ''kunywa'' "to drink", ''kuja'' "to come", ''kupa'' "to give". The verbs ''kwenda'' "to go" and ''kwisha'' "to finish" may belong to this group, although it is also common for these verbs to be conjugated as common verbs (as ''kuenda'' and ''kuisha''). Because the stems of most of these verbs, once the infinitive prefix ''ku-'' is removed, are monosyllabic, these are frequently termed '''monosyllabic verbs''', however this is problematic as the final ''-a'' of Bantu verbs is often not considered to be part of the root (meaning that roots of many of these verbs consists of only a single consonant or consonant cluster, such as ''-p-'' "give"). Furthermore, when the final ''-a'' is considered part of the stem, this excludes ''-enda'' and ''-isha'', which generally conjugate in a similar way to the other short verbs. The short verbs are all native Bantu verbs ending in ''-a'' and undergo the same ''-i'' and ''-e'' alterations as the common verbs. Additionally, they are characterised by the insertion (or retention) of the syllable ''-ku-'' in certain verb forms. This intrusive ''-ku-''  (which may be [[Interlinear gloss|glossed]] as &lt;small&gt;EXT&lt;/small&gt; for "extension") prevents the penultimate stress from falling on certain [[Tense–aspect–mood|TAM]] prefixes (-''na-'', ''-me-'', ''-li-'', ''-ta-'', ''-sha-'', ''-nge-'', ''-ngeli-'') and relative prefixes, which are inherently unable be stressed. This ''-ku-'' disappears in verb forms where the stress is allowed to fall on a subject or object prefix, or on certain other TAM prefixes (''-a-'', ''hu-'', ''-ki-'', ''-ka-'', ''-ku-'', ''-si-''). (The TAM prefix ''-ja-'' can be regarded as belonging to either group, depending on the speaker.) Because the initial stem vowel of ''-enda'' and ''-isha'' takes the stress, this explanation does not sufficiently fit, however it should suffice to say that the distribution of their ''-kw-'' extension, among speakers who use it, is identical to that of the ''-ku-'' extension in other short verbs.

The '''Loan verbs''', also frequently called '''"Arabic" verbs''',  are those which do not end in ''-a'' in the infinitive. Not all verbs, from Arabic are in this group, however, such as ''kusaidia'', which is an Arabic loan which happens to end in ''-a'' and is thus declined as a common verb. Likewise, not all Loan verbs come from Arabic, such as ''kukisi'' "to kiss" and ''kuripoti'' "to report", which are from English. What these verbs share in common is that they are all loan-words and none of them end in ''-a''. The consequence of this is that they do not take the suffixes ''-e'' and ''-i'' that the verbs ending in ''-a'' do, which occasionally results in ambiguity, such as in ''si-ku-sahau-&lt;s&gt;Ø&lt;/s&gt;'' which could either mean "I did not forget" (NEG.1S-NEG.PST-forget-&lt;s&gt;Ø&lt;/s&gt;) or "I do not forget you" (NEG.1s-2s-forget-&lt;s&gt;PRES.NEG&lt;/s&gt;).

===Subject and object concords===

Both the subject and, when applicable, the object of the verb are indicated by ''prefixes'' or ''concords'' attached to the verb stem. Swahili is a [[pro-drop]] language: explicit personal pronouns are only used for emphasis, or with verb forms that do not indicate subject or object. When a noun is used as the subject or object, then the concord must match its class. Animate nouns (referring to a person or animal) are an exception and these occur with concords of the noun classes 1 (singular) or 2 (plural). The subject concord must always be present, except in the infinitive, habitual and imperative forms. The object concord is generally optional; although some sources maintain that it must always be used with animate objects, this appears not to be the case as counter-examples are commonplace. Whether it is used or not appears to have to do with animacy, specificity and definiteness as well as pragmatic considerations of emphasis.

Six different forms of verbal concord exist.

For the subject, there are both negative and positive forms, while there are only positive forms for objects. The negative subject concords are formed by prefixing the syllable ''ha-'' to the beginning, except for the irregular forms ''si-'' (instead of ''*hani-''), ''hu-'' (instead of ''*hau-'') and ''ha-'' (instead of ''*haa-'') which are used, respectively, for first, second and third person singular animate subjects.

Additionally, in (the third person singular of) noun class 1, the prefix ''yu-'' is used instead of ''a-'' as the subject of a locative copula. (This ''yu-'' can also be seen in the demonstratives.) The negative form of ''yu-'' is formed regularly, by appending the prefix ''ha-''.

Before the present 'indefinite' marker ''-a-'', subject concords are shortened to just a consonant or consonant cluster in a similar manner to the prefix which occur on the genitive preposition ''-a''.

Object concords are generally the same as the positive subject concord, although there are a few exceptions for instances involving animate referents; 2nd person singular and plural, as well as 3rd person singular (class 1) all have different forms for subject and object concord.

Examples:

* '''''Tu'''nakwenda sasa.'' "We are going now."
* '''''Sisi''' '''tu'''nakwenda sasa.'' "''We'' are going now." (with emphasis)
* '''''Ni'''na'''mw'''ona.'' "I see him/her."
* '''''Ni'''na'''mw'''ona '''yeye'''.'' "I see ''him/her''." (with emphasis)
* '''''Ni'''na'''m'''pa zawadi.'' "I give '''him/her''' a gift."
Because the 2nd person plural object prefix ''-wa-'' is the same as the object prefix for class 2 (3rd person plural object), a word such as ''nina'''wa'''ona'' may ambiguously mean "I see '''you all'''" or "I see '''them'''." These two possibilities may be disambiguated by placing the pronoun after the verb: ''nina'''wa'''ona '''ninyi''' / '''wao'''''. Very frequently, however, the suffix ''-eni'' is appended to the verb to indicate that the second person plural is meant: ''nina'''wa'''on'''eni''''' "I see you all."  This suffix causes the final ''a'' of Bantu verbs to shift to ''e''. On loan verbs, this suffix is simply ''-ni''. Some speakers use the prefix ''-ku-'' (otherwise indicating 2nd person singular) with the suffix ''-(e)ni'', as in ''nina'''ku'''on'''eni''''' "I see you all."

The reflexive prefix only occurs as an object, and refers back to the subject of the sentence. It is equivalent to English forms like ''myself'', ''yourself'', ''himself'' and so on.
* '''''ni'''na'''ji'''tetea'' "I defend myself"
* '''''a'''na'''ji'''ona'' "he sees himself" (idiomatically, may mean: "he is conceited")

===Infinitive===

The infinitive is a [[verbal noun]], and belongs to class 15, which is reserved specifically for infinitives. It is marked by the prefix '''''ku-'''''. It may occur in the same contexts as other nouns and may, occasionally, even be derived into the locative classes by means of attaching the suffix ''-ni'', as in ''kuangukani'' "in falling" (i.e. "while falling"). It corresponds to the English [[Infinitive#English|infinitive]] or [[Gerund#Gerunds in English|gerund]]. Infinitives cannot take subject, relative or TAM prefixes, but they may take object prefixes.

|'''''kuto(ku)'''''[&lt;small&gt;OBJ&lt;/small&gt;]'''''___'''''
|}

The negative infinitive is derived from the verb ''kutoa'' "to subtract", "to not do", although it is rarely encountered in its full form for this use. The additional ''-ku-'' in brackets is the infinitive marker of the original verb, although it may be omitted as long as stress rules allow.

===Tenses, aspects and moods===
For the sake of simplicity, the following verb forms may be referred to as "tenses" as they often are in learner materials, but it should be remembered that many of these are not [[Grammatical tense|grammatical tenses in the technical sense]] but may instead be [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]] or [[Grammatical mood|moods]]. All together, [[Tense–aspect–mood|Tense, Aspect and Mood]] may be abbreviated as TAM.

The following table shows a summary of TAM forms which will be discussed in further depth below. Brackets indicate optional elements and slashes indicate alternative elements of which either (but not both) may fill the same slot in the verb. The column labelled 'final vowel' is only relevant for "short" and "common verbs", with "loan verbs" remaining invariable here with the exception of the ''-ni'' suffix added to indicate 2nd person plural address. In any TAM form, when the object is 2nd person plural, this ''-(e)ni'' prefix may also occur, but this is not shown in this table.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Note that the 'indefinite' present ''-a-'' causes the form of the subject marker to change as outlined [[#Subject and object concords|above]].

====Imperative====

The [[imperative mood]] is used to issue direct commands. It can occur either alone or with an object prefix. The presence of an object prefix (including the reflexive ''ji-'') causes the final ''-a'' of Bantu verbs to become ''-e''. Note that the ''ji-'' prefix of reflexive verbs is an object prefix, meaning, for example, that the imperative of ''-jifunza'' "to learn" is ''jifunz&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;'' "learn!" and not ''*jifunza''.

|}

The plural form, with the suffix ''-ni'', is used when addressing multiple people.

The following verbs have irregular imperatives, regular forms may be heard, particularly by non-native speakers and particularly in Kenya, and regular forms may be interpreted as less polite:
* ''kuja'' "to come": '''''njoo''''' (pl. '''''njooni''''')
* ''kwenda'' "to go" : '''''nenda''''' (pl. '''''nendeni''''')
* ''kuleta'' "to bring": '''''lete''''' (pl. '''''leteni''''')
The verb ''-acha'' may informally be given the imperative form '''''wacha''''' (pl. '''''wacheni''''').

Additionally, the verb ''kuwa'' "to be" has an irregular imperative form: '''''iwe''''' (pl. '''''iweni'''''), although this is rarely used and more frequently replaced by a regular imperative form '''''kuwa''''' (pl. '''''kuweni''''') or used in the subjunctive ("polite imperative") form: '''''uwe''''' (pl. '''''mwe''''').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Swahili: A complete working course|last=D.

====Present tenses====

There are two present tenses in Swahili. These are sometimes termed the "definite present" (with '''''-na-''''') and the "indefinite present" (with '''''-a-'''''). In modern, standard Swahili, however, there is no great difference in meaning between these two forms as the "indefinite present" is more or less obsolete and rarely used other than its frequent appearance in media headlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rieger|first=Dorothee|date=|title=SWAHILI AS A TENSE PROMINENT LANGUAGE.

|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Although rarely used, the "indefinite present" adds a small complication to the presentation of Swahili grammar as the '''''-a-''''' marking the tense causes the subject concords to undergo reduction in the same manner as the prefixes of the [[#Genitive_-a|genitive preposition ''-a'']]. This is outlined [[#Subject and object concords|above]].

In informal Swahili, it is very common for the first person singular concord ''ni-'' to collapse into the '''''-na-''''' of the definite present tense marker and become inaudible (and unwritten). The distinction between the "definite" and "indefinite" present tense forms appears to vanish in the first person as both begin with a ''na-'', however short verbs retain their ''-ku-'' extension in the ''-na-'' tense and lose it in the ''-a-'' tense, allowing this distinction to still be felt, such as in ''(ni)nakula'' "I eat", in the ''-na-'' present tense, versus ''nala'' "I eat", in the ''-a-'' present tense.

==== Habitual ====
The '''habitual''' verb form is unusual in that it does not allow subject prefixes to appear on it. The prefix '''''hu-''''' is added to the beginning of the verb and short verbs do not need their ''-ku-'' extension.

|'''''hu'''''([&lt;small&gt;OBJ&lt;/small&gt;])''___''
|}
The habitual indicates repeated, habitual occurrence of an action ([[habitual aspect]]) or something occurring as a timeless general rule ([[gnomic aspect]]). Because subject prefixes are absent, personal pronouns are very frequently used to indicate the subject.

|&lt;small&gt;"weekend"&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| colspan="5" |"We drink beer every weekend."
|}
The habitual aspect with ''hu-'' is often replaced by the present with ''-na-'' in everyday use, the ''sisi hunywa'' of the above example then being replaced with ''tunakunywa.'' Some speakers instead use the non-standard habitual suffix '''''-ga''''' or '''''-nga''''' which has entered Swahili from other Bantu languages spoken in East Africa, giving ''tunakunywaga'' or ''tunakunywanga''. The habitual aspect with ''hu-'' is, however, very commonly used in proverbs dealing with eternal truisms.

====Past====

The past tense is used in Swahili to talk about actions or states in the past, whether in the near or the distant past. It is formed with the prefix ''-li-''. Its negative equivalent is formed with the negative subject prefix plus ''-ku-''. The positive tense marker ''-li-'' cannot take stress and triggers the use of the extension ''-ku-'' (or ''-kw-'') where necessary.  The negative tense marker ''-ku-'' can take stress, meaning that an additional ''-ku-'' extension is not needed.

|
|}

==== Perfect ====
The [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] indicates an action or situation which occurred in the past, similarly to the past tense, however the focus of the utterance is on the relevance of this past action to the present moment. For example, the word ''nimepika'' "I have cooked" describes a past action with present relevance (i.e. the food is ready now) whereas ''nilipika'' "I cooked" describes a past action with no implication of any relevance to the present (the food may have been eaten long ago, or not).

The perfect is formed in the positive with the prefix '''''-me-'''''. The negative is formed with the negative subject prefix plus '''''-ja-'''''. As with the present and past tenses, the positive present marker '''''-me-''''' cannot take the word stress and triggers the appearance of the ''-ku-'' extension in short verbs, but the negative marker '''''-ja-''''' is able to be stressed. Some speakers may use the extension ''-ku-'' with '''''-ja-'''''.

Some sources describe the '''''-ja-''''' form as containing more of an implication of "not yet" than a simple negation of the '''''-me''-''' form, however the word ''bado'' "still", "not yet" may be used to indicate this explicitly where necessary.

Inchoative verbs, such as ''kuchoka'' "to get tired", which describe the entering of a state, are used in the perfect to indicate ''being'' in the state in question. Compare for example: ''ni'''na'''choka'' "I am becoming tired"; ''ni'''me'''choka'' "I have become tired", i.e. "I am tired." For more information and examples, see [[#Inchoative_verbs|the section on inchoative verbs below]].

Some speakers may replace the sequence of prefixes '''''a-me-''''' with '''''ka-''''' with more or less the same meaning. This may derive from the consecutive tense marker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/878224907|title=Swahili grammar and workbook|last=Mpiranya|first=Fidèle|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781315750699|location=London|pages=44|oclc=878224907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Anterior ''-sha-'' ====
The '''anterior''' marker '''''-sha-''''' (or sometimes '''''-kwisha-''''') is a relatively new TAM marker that derives diachronically from the verb '''''kwisha''''' "to finish, to run out". It is most commonly (and perhaps least controversially) used directly after the perfect marker '''''-me-'''''. It often imparts the meaning of "already", emphasising the completeness of the action.

|-

|}
The anterior marker '''''-sha-''''' is also used with other TAM markers, simply sitting after them within the TAM slot. It may also on occasion be used on its own, with a function more or less equivalent to the perfect ''-me-''. These uses may not be regarded as standard Swahili. It is frequently used with the situational marker ''-ki-'' where it indicates a situation in which the action has been completed.

|-
| colspan="7" |"Once you get a job, you will have enough money."

====Future====

The future tense is formed in Swahili with the prefix '''''-ta-'''''. The negative form is indicated simply by using the negative subject prefix, with '''''-ta-''''' being used here as well. A number of speakers, however, use '''''-to-''''' in the negative future. This may be derived by analogy from the ''-to-'' of the negative infinitive, and may also disambiguate between positive and negative where the only difference otherwise would be an ''h-'' at the beginning of the negative word. For example, ''atakuja'' "s/he will come" vs. ''&lt;u&gt;h&lt;/u&gt;atakuja'' "s/he will not come" (or ''&lt;u&gt;h&lt;/u&gt;at&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;kuja''). Because second language speakers in many areas have trouble with pronouncing and distinguishing /h/, the optional change from '''''-ta-''''' to '''''-to-''''' in the negative can provide a failsafe indication when a negative meaning is intended.

'''''-Ta-''''' (and likewise '''''-to-''''') cannot take the word stress whether in positive or negative and thus causes the appearance of the ''-ku-'' extension in short verbs.

====Subjunctive====

The '''[[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]]''' (sometimes referred to as an [[Optative mood|'''optative''']]) expresses hypothetical situations, wishes and requests. It is also used as a complement to certain auxiliary verbs and conjunctions. The subjunctive is indicated by the lack of any Tense-Aspect-Mood prefix and the change of the final ''-a'', where present, to ''-e''-. The so-called "Arabic verbs" do not undergo this change and the subjunctive form is made simply by omitting any tense marker. The negative subjunctive is indicated by adding the syllable ''-si-'' into the tense slot, with the positive subject prefix being used rather than the negative.

The subjunctive may be used on its own with a second person subject as a more polite alternative to an imperative. As there is no negative imperative, forms beginning with ''usi-'' and ''msi-'' may also be interpreted as such.

==== Situational ====
The '''situational''', '''simultaneous''' or '''conditional''' tense is formed with the TAM prefix '''''-ki-'''''. This prefix may take stress and thus the extension ''-ku-'' does not appear with short verbs in the situational verb form.

There is, strictly speaking, no negative form of the situational, however, in conditional sentences, the relative verb form using '''''-sipo-''''' is quite close in meaning to a negative equivalent of '''''-ki-''''' and it will be given here as it may prove helpful. Note that the ''-ku-'' extension ''does'' appear with ''-sipo-'' as the ''-po-'', like all relative syllables, is unable to be stressed.

The situational verb form is used to indicate a simultaneous action or situation of subordinate importance that provides the temporal or contextual background for the main verb in the sentence. It is somewhat equivalent to the English conjunctions "if" and "when", but it also forms the equivalent of adverbial participle clauses. If needed for clarity or emphasis, a word meaning if, such as ''kama'', ''ikiwa'' or ''endapo'' may be added to the beginning of the clause (which allows the speaker to choose a different TAM marker). The word ''ikiwa'' is itself the situational form of the verb ''-wa'' "to be", with the class 9 subject prefix ''i-'', literally meaning on its own essentially "if it is".

==== Consecutive ====
The '''consecutive''' or '''narrative''' tense is formed with the TAM prefix '''''-ka-'''''. This prefix may take stress and thus the extension ''-ku-'' does not appear with short verbs in this form.

|[&lt;small&gt;SUBJ&lt;/small&gt;]'''''ka'''''[&lt;small&gt;OBJ&lt;/small&gt;]''___''
|}
The consecutive tense is mainly used with the past tense '''''-li-''''' in narrating a sequence of events whereby ''-li-'' is used for the first verb and ''-ka-'' for subsequent verbs. It roughly carries the meaning "and then" and makes the use of ''na'' "and" or ''halafu'' / ''kisha'' "then" essentially redundant. Where context is clearly past, a narrative may also be begun with ''-ka-''.

==== Expeditous ====

The word ''akawe'' in the above sentence could also be replaced with ''ili awe'' "in order that he be" or simply the subjunctive ''awe'' "that he be" (or "''(for him) to be''" in more natural contemporary English), but the ''-ka-'' added to this word emphasises his becoming an ambassador immediately following his being dispatched.

The expeditous verb form is frequently used with imperatives (and "polite imperatives" in the subjunctive), again indicating roughly "and then".

==== Irrealis ====
There are two [[Irrealis mood|'''irrealis''']] verb forms, one which may be called "present irrealis" (marked by '''''-nge-''''') and one which may be called "past irrealis" (marked by '''''-ngali-'''''). The standard means of forming the negative is to use ''-si-'' in the TAM slot, forming ''-singe-'' and ''-singali''-. Some speakers, however, particularly in speech influenced by southern dialects,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/282550660|title=The World's major languages|last=Comrie|first=Bernard|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|others=Comrie, Bernard, 1947-|year=|isbn=9780203301524|edition= 2nd|location=London|pages=894|oclc=282550660}}&lt;/ref&gt; negate the irrealis verb forms instead by using the negative subject concords.

Both the irrealis forms are used to discuss hypothetical situations, generally within conditional sentences. Both the [[Protasis (linguistics)|protasis]] (if-clause) and [[Apodosis (linguistics)|apodosis]] (then-clause) may have an identical structure with the protasis appearing first. In order to disambiguate or emphasise, such as if the clauses are in the reverse order, a word for "if" (''kama'', ''ikiwa'', ''endapo'') may precede the protasis.

In the usage of many speakers, the distinction between the present and past irrealis forms is somewhat blurred so that the final example above may commonly be spoken as "''(Kama) ni'''nge'''jua hiyo, ni'''singe'''kuja hapa''." which, speaking strictly, could be interpreted as "If I '''knew''' that I '''would not come''' here."

=== Relative verb forms ===
There are five verb templates which can be used to create [[relative clause]]s. The three simple tenses PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE may only be relativised in their positive sense. In addition to these, there is a tenseless positive form and a tenseless negative form. For all other verb forms, relative clauses must be formed by a [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] relative using ''amba-''.

The following table shows the structure of the verb templates, notably the positioning of the relative morpheme, here labelled "REL". Note in the following table that the marker for the future tense is ''-taka-'' with a following relative morpheme, rather than the simple ''-ta-'' which occurs otherwise.

The relative morpheme takes one of many forms to indicate the class of its referent. The relative morpheme for each class is identical to its combining pronominal form which appears with ''na-'' and ''ndi-''. Aside from class 1, the form of each can be achieved by placing ''o'' (the so-called "o of reference")

=== 'To be' ===
In most languages with a verbal [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], the equivalent of the verb 'to be', it is this verb that exhibits the most irregularity and the most diversity of form. Swahili is no exception. Outside of the present tense, the Swahili verb '''''-wa''''' (infinitive '''''kuwa''''') is almost entirely regular, inflecting as other short verbs do. In the present tense, however, there is a distinction made between a copular of ''essence'' versus a copula of ''state or location''. This is similar to the distinction between [[Romance copula|''ser'' and ''estar'']] in Spanish and Portuguese, however, in Swahili, this distinction largely vanishes outside of the present tense. There are also irregular relativised forms for the present tense as well as an irregular unique [[Continuative aspect|continuative]] form.

==== Essence ====
===== Invariable copula =====
The invariable copula '''''ni''''' is used, in the present tense, to express that two noun phrases (the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]]) refer to one and the same referent:
* ''Mimi '''ni''' Bahati.'' "I '''am''' Bahati."
* ''Dunia '''ni''' sayari tunapoishi.'' "Earth '''is''' the planet we live on."
It is also used to express membership of a class (a [[subset]] relationship):
* ''Wao '''ni''' wanasayansi.'' "They '''are''' scientists."
* ''Jua '''ni''' nyota.'' "The sun '''is''' a star."
* ''Miti '''ni''' mimea mikubwa.'' "Trees '''are''' large plants."
It may also introduce an adjective or equivalent phrase describing a relatively permanent characteristic.
* ''Babake '''ni''' mrefu sana.'' "Her father '''is''' very tall."
* ''Mji huyu '''ni''' mdogo.'' "This town '''is''' small."
* ''Misuli yako '''ni''' kama chuma.'' Your muscles '''are''' like steel. 
The negative form '''''si''''' can be used in all the same situations with a negative meaning:
* ''Wewe '''si''' Bahati.'' "You '''are not''' Bahati."
* ''Jua '''si''' sayari.'' "The sun '''is not''' a planet." 
* ''Pomboo '''si''' wadogo.'' "Dolphins '''are not''' small."
Because '''''ni''''' and '''''si''''' do not provide any information about the subject, personal pronouns, usually only necessary for emphasis, frequently appear. Compare the typical use of irregular present tense with that of the entirely regular past tense where the subject prefixes make personal pronouns redundant and used only for emphasis.

|}
A sentence begun with '''''ni''''' or '''''si''''' without an overtly marked pronoun is typically translated with the subject "it" in English. With plural context, "they" may be meant.
* '''''Ni''' asubuhi sasa.'' "It's morning now."
* '''''Ni''' vigumu kulala.'' "It's difficult to fall asleep."
* '''''Ni''' wanene sana.'' "They're very fat."
On occasion, the invariable copula may follow regular forms of ''kuwa'' in other tenses. In the following example, the ''ni'' could also be left out.

|-
| colspan="8" |"In truth, that was a rented sheep."
|}

===== Emphatic copula =====
The '''emphatic''' or '''focusing''' copula '''''ndi-''''' places its subject in [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]], emphasising that it is ''that particular referent'' and not another. The emphatic copula takes suffixes matching the person and noun class of the referent. These suffixes are the same as those which combine with ''na''. In the first and second persons, the third person suffixes are frequently used.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The form ''sisi'' "it is not us" is not frequently used as it is identical to the pronoun ''sisi'' "we", "us". Instead it is virtually always replaced with ''sio''.

Forms of the emphatic copula are frequently equivalent to a definite phrase in translation and are followed by relative verb forms as in the following example:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! colspan="4" |'''''Mimi ndiye niliyewaona kwanza.'''''
|-
|'''mimi'''
|ndi-'''ye'''
|ni-li-'''ye'''-wa-on(a)

|&lt;small&gt;"first"&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| colspan="4" |"I'm the one who saw them first."
|}
Compare the above with the non-emphatic version of the same sentence:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! colspan="2" |'''''Niliyewaona kwanza.'''''
|-
|ni-li-wa-on(a)
|kwanza

|&lt;small&gt;"I saw them"&lt;/small&gt;
|&lt;small&gt;"first"&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| colspan="2" |"I saw them first."
|}

==== Location ====
Location is indicated in the present tense by prefixing the subject concord to one of the locative clitics ''-po'', ''-ko'' and ''-mo''. The class 1 subject concord ''a-'' (negative: ''ha-'') is however replaced with ''yu-'' (negative: ''hayu-'').

The three clitics, ''-po'', ''-ko'' and ''-mo'' correspond to the locative classes 16, 17 and 18 respectively and indicate "definite", "indefinite" and "internal" location respectively. For example, ''wapo'' means essentially "they are here/there", ''wako'' means "they are around here/there" and ''wamo'' means "they are in here/there".

Under a very strict prescriptive viewpoint, the classes should not be mixed, for instance ''nipo hapa'' "I am here" is regarded as correct but ''niko hapa'' "I am here" is regarded as incorrect. There is, however, a broad tendency for many speakers to prefer forms with ''-ko'' over the other forms, such that ''niko hapa'' is very common.

===Inchoative verbs===

A large number of Swahili verbs indicate the process of entering a state. For example, the verbs ''kulewa'' ("to get drunk"), ''kuchoka'' ("to become tired") and ''kuchelewa'' ("to become late") describe the respective changes to state from "not drunk" to "drunk", from "not tired" to "tired" and from "not late" to "late". These may be regarded as inherently [[inchoative verb]]s. There is, however, no equivalent ''[[stative verb]]'' for each one that would describe being in the state of having completed that process, i.e. "to be [state]". Stative meanings such as "be drunk", "be tired" and "be late" are formed by using these inchoative verbs with the [[#Perfect|perfect marker '''''-me-''''']] (or, in the negative, '''''-ja-'''''). Many words which are present in English as adjectives have no corresponding adjective in Swahili and are expressed by means of inchoative verbs.

===Derived verbs===

New verbs are readily created from simple verbs by attaching various suffixes (often called ''extensions'') to the stem to get different shades of meaning by altering [[Voice (grammar)|grammatical voice]]. Note that the final ''-a'' of common and short verbs only appears at the very end of the verb and is dropped before any suffixes.

==== Reciprocal ====
The [[Reciprocal (grammar)|reciprocal]] suffix '''''-ana''''' adds the meaning "each other" to the verb.
* ''-penda'' "to love" → ''-pend'''ana''''' "to love each other"
* ''-andikia'' "to write to" → ''-andiki'''ana''''' "to write to each other" 
* -''pata'' "to get, receive" → -''pat'''ana''''' "to reconcile"
* ''-piga'' "to hit" → -''pig'''ana''''' "to fight", "to hit each other"
The subject of a reciprocal verb is generally plural, however a singular subject may be used, often followed by ''na'' and an additional referent.

==== Applicative ====
The [[Applicative voice|'''applicative''']] suffix, frequently called the ''''prepositional''' extension' in learning resources, adds one of various meanings to a verb usually represented by a preposition in English such as "to", "for", "in", "with" or even "from". The form of the applicative suffix varies, depending on vowel harmony and the reappearance of the /l/ which disappeared from an older stage of Swahili between the final two vowels.

* ''-nunua'' "to buy" → ''-nunu'''lia''''' "to buy for"
* ''-soma'' "to read" → ''-som'''ea''''' "to read to/for"
* ''-kojoa'' "to urinate" → ''-kojo'''lea''''' "to urinate on/in/against"
Loan verbs usually form their applicative forms by removing their final vowel and replacing it with either ''-ia'' or ''-ea'' according to the same rules.
* ''-rudi'' "to return" → ''-rud'''ia''''' "to return to"
* -''samehe'' "to forgive" → ''-sameh'''ea''''' "to forgive (sb.) for (sb.)"
* ''-hesabu'' "to count", "to consider" → ''-hesab'''ia''''' "to count for", "to ascribe"

==== ''C''ausative ====
The '''[[causative]]''' suffix is added to verbs to indicate a person or thing causing another person or thing to perform the action of the original verb. There are a few ways in which causatives are formed. The most common and [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] causative suffix is ''-isha'', which follows the same rules of vowel harmony as the applicative suffix.

* ''-soma'' "to read; study" → ''-som'''esha''''' "to teach"
* ''-kopa'' "to borrow" → ''-kop'''esha''''' "to lend"
* ''-weza'' "to be able" → ''-wez'''esha''''' "to enable"
* ''-enda'' "to go" → ''-end'''esha''''' "to make go; drive (a vehicle)"
* ''-vaa'' "to put on (clothes); dress (oneself)" → ''-va'''lisha''''' "to dress (somebody else)"
* ''-ongea'' "to speak" → ''-onge'''lesha''''' "to make speak"

Short verbs have no preceding vowel so have to be learnt individually.

* ''-fa'' "to die" → ''-f'''isha''''' "to put to death; kill; destroy"; cf. the underived verb ''-ua'' "to kill"
* ''-la'' "to eat" → ''-l'''isha''''' "to feed (someone/something)"
* ''-nywa'' "to drink" → ''-nyw'''esha''''' "to give (someone/something) water to drink"

Loan verbs, except those ending in ''-au'', remove their final vowel before adding these suffixes.

* ''-fahamu'' "to understand" → ''-faham'''isha''''' "to make understand"
* ''-rudi'' "to return; go back; come back" → ''-rud'''isha''''' "to return (something); give back; bring back"
* ''-tii'' "to obey" → ''-ti'''isha''''' "to make obey; subdue; dominate; subjugate"
* ''-furahi'' "to become happy" → ''-furah'''isha''''' "to make happy; gladden"
* ''-starehe'' "to relax" → ''-stareh'''esha''''' "to entertain; put at ease"
* ''-sahau'' "to forget" → ''-sahau'''lisha''''' "to make forget"

These suffixes may also be added to verbs and nouns to create causative verbs from them.

* ''imara'' "strong" (adjective) → ''-imar'''isha''''' "to strengthen (something); fortify"
* ''-fupi'' "short" (adjective) → ''-fup'''isha''''' "to shorten (something)"
* ''tayari'' "ready" (adjective) → ''-tayar'''isha''''' "to prepare (something); to make ready"
* ''bora'' "better" (adjective) → ''-bor'''esha''''' "to improve (something); to make better"
* ''safi'' "clean" (adjective) → ''-saf'''isha''''' "to clean (something)"
* ''sababu'' "cause; reason" (noun) → ''-sabab'''isha''''' "to cause"
* ''lazima'' "obligation" (noun) → ''-lazim'''isha''''' "to force; compel"
* ''orodha'' "list" (noun) → ''-orodh'''esha''''' "to list; to make a list"
* ''huzuni'' "sadness" (noun) → ''-huzun'''isha''''' "to make sad; sadden"
* ''hakika'' "certainty" (noun) → ''-hakik'''isha''''' "to make sure; make certain; assure"

There is a less common causative suffix ''-iza'' or ''-eza'' which appears with some words. Often there is more than derivation from the same word, sometimes with different meanings.

* ''-penda'' "to like; love" → ''-pend'''eza''''' "to please; be nice; be attractive"; cf. ''-pende'''sha''''' "to cause to like/love"
* ''-lipa'' "to pay" → ''-lip'''iza''' ''"to take vengeance/revenge on; to make (somebody) pay (figuratively)"; cf. ''-lip'''isha''''' "to charge a fee; to make (somebody) pay (literally)"
There is another means of deriving causative verbs and which results from an earlier ''-y-'' in the language. This ''-y-'' suffix combined with consonants and changed their pronunciation, palatalising or "softening" them. The following table outlines the common sound changes.

{| class="wikitable"

|''-t-''

|'''''-ny-'''''
|-
|''-p-''
|'''''-fy-'''''
|-
|''-w-''
|'''''-vy-'''''
|}

In many cases, more than one of these suffixes may be used to derive different verbs from a single verb, formed by various means. In some cases, such as with ''-onyesha'' "to show", two causative suffixes may appear together.

* ''-ona'' "to see" → ''-o'''nya''''' "to warn"; cf. ''-o'''nyesha''''' "to show" (also: ''-on'''esha''')''
* ''-ogopa'' "to fear; be afraid/scared of" → ''-ogo'''fya''''' "to frighten; to be scary"; cf. ''-ogop'''esha''''' "to frighten; to be scary" (no difference in meaning) 
* ''-pona'' "to heal; to get better; to recover" (intransitive) → ''-po'''nya''''' "to heal (somebody); to make recover"; cf. ''-po'''nyesha''''' "to heal (somebody); to make recover" (no difference in meaning)
* ''-pita'' "to pass" → ''-pi'''sha''''' "to give way; make room for; allow to pass"; cf. ''-pit'''isha''''' "to make pass"
* ''-lala'' "to lie down; fall asleep" → ''-la'''za''''' "to house; provide with accommodation; lay sb. down; admit (somebody to hospital)"; cf. ''-lal'''isha''''' "to put (somebody) to bed"
* ''-lewa'' "to get drunk/inebriated" → ''-le'''vya''''' "to intoxicate" (of a drug); cf. ''-lew'''esha''''' "to get (somebody) drunk"
Verbs that end with ''-ka'' very frequently exchange this to ''-sha'' to form the causative, however this is much less common when the preceding syllable contains ''e'' or ''i''.

* ''-amka'' "to wake up" (oneself) → ''-am'''sha''''' "to wake (somebody) up"
* ''-chemka'' "to boil" (intransitive) → ''-chem'''sha''''' "to boil (something); to make boil" (the ''m'' in this word is syllabic, derived from earlier "''-mu-''", so the ''e'' does not belong to the preceding syllable)
* ''-waka'' "to shine, to catch fire" → ''-wa'''sha''''' "to set on fire; light; switch on; start (e.g. a car)"
* ''-choka'' "to become tired" → ''-cho'''sha''''' "to tire; be tiring; be tiresome; be boring"
* ''-kumbuka'' "to remember" → ''-kumbu'''sha''''' "to remind"
* ''-andika'' "to write" → ''-andik'''isha''''' "to make write"
* ''-cheka'' "to laugh" → ''-chek'''esha''''' "to make laugh; amuse; be funny"

Because most of the word-final sequences of more than one vowel come from the deletion of an ''l'' that was present in an earlier stage of the language (and often preserved in many dialects and related languages), many verbs which today end in a sequence of two vowels are made by (removing the final ''-a'') and adding '''''-za'''''. This ''-z-'' results from the palatalisation ("softening") process outlined above. which was applied to the ''-l-'' in these verbs. The ''-l-'' was subsequently lost but the ''-z-'' was not.

* ''-tangaa'' "to become widely known" → ''-tanga'''za''''' "to announce; proclaim; publicise"
* ''-kataa'' "to refuse" → ''-kata'''za''''' "to forbid"; cf. ''-kata'''lisha''''' "to make (somebody) refuse"
* ''-tembea'' "to (go for a) walk" → ''-tembe'''za''''' "to take for a walk; to walk (e.g. a dog)"
* ''-kimbia'' "to run (away from)" → ''-kimbi'''za''''' "to chase (away); pursue"
* ''-jaa'' "to fill; become full" → ''-ja'''za''''' "to fill; make full"

==== Passive ====
The [[Passive voice|passive]] suffix is generally '''''-wa'''''.  
* ''-jenga'' "to build" (whence ''[[Jenga]]'') → ''-jeng'''wa''''' "to be built"
* ''-sema'' "to say" → ''-sem'''wa''''' "to be said"
* ''-danganya'' "to deceive" → ''-dangany'''wa''''' "to be deceived"
Verb stems that end with ''l'' or either of the semivowels ''w'' or ''y'' (but not ''ny'' as that is a single consonant [[Digraph (orthography)|written with two letters]], as illustrated by ''-danganywa'' above) take a suffix '''''-iwa'''''; if the preceding syllable contains ''e'' or ''o'', it will be '''''-ewa''''' instead.
* ''-pwaya'' "to pound" → ''-pway'''iwa''''' "to be pounded"
* ''-chovya'' "to immerse" → ''-chovy'''ewa''''' "to be immersed"
* -''doya'' "to investigate" → ''-doy'''ewa''''' "to be investigated"
* ''-gawa'' "to share; divide" → ''-gaw'''iwa''''' "to be shared; be divided"
* ''-tawala'' "to govern; rule" → ''-tawal'''iwa''''' "to be governed; be ruled"
Verbs whose ending in one of the front vowels plus ''a'', (i.e. the sequences ''-ea'' and -''ia'') usually simply add ''-wa.'' 
* ''-ambia'' "to tell (someone)" → ''-ambi'''wa''''' "to be told" (of someone)
* ''-tegemea'' "to rely on" → ''-tegeme'''wa''''' "to be relied on"
* ''-zuia'' "to prevent" → ''-zui'''wa''''' "to be prevented"
A few words of this group, however, add ''-lewa'' (after an ''e'') or ''-liwa'' (after ''i''), resulting from the earlier .
* ''-tia'' "to put in" → ''-ti'''liwa''''' "to be put in"
* ''-lea'' "to bring up; raise" → ''-le'''lewa''''' "to be brought up, raised"
* -''pokea'' "to receive" → ''-poke'''wa''''' / ''-poke'''lewa''''' "to be received" (both alternatives possible)
As Swahili does not distinguish between the sequences /ua/ and /uwa/ or /oa/ and /owa/, the passive ending ''-wa'' would be inaudible on verbs, so the ''-liwa'' and ''-lewa'' endings are used instead. 
* ''-oa'' "to get married" (of a man) → ''-o'''lewa''''' "to get married" (of a woman)
*''-toa'' "to emit; publish; add; subtract; remove" → ''-to'''lewa''''' "to be emitted; be published; be added; be subtracted; removed" (These verbs are [[auto-antonym]]s!)
* ''-nunua'' "to buy" → ''-nunu'''liwa''''' "to be bought"
Note that the verb ''-ua'' "to kill" has an irregular passive form: ''-u'''awa''''', although the regular ''-u'''liwa''''' is oc&lt;nowiki/&gt;casionally used.

The Kiunguja dialect, specifically the variant of it spoken in Zanzibar City, which has been made the standard dialect, goes a step further than many other dialects, requiring also that all verbs ending in ''-aa'' be passivised with the suffix ''-liwa'' even though the difference between /ɑɑ/ and /ɑwɑ/ is perfectly distinct.
* ''-zaa'' "to give birth to; sire" → ''-za'''liwa''''' "to be born" (dialectically also ''-za'''wa''''')
* ''-vaa'' "to put on (clothing)" → ''-va'''liwa''''' "to be put on"
* ''-kaa'' "to sit; stay; reside" → ''-ka'''liwa''''' "to be inhabited; be occupied; be settled; be sat upon; be stayed in"
The short verbs have passive forms that must be learnt separately. In each case, the passive form is one syllable longer and falls into the category of common verbs and thus does not receive the extension ''-ku-'' anywhere in its conjugation.
* ''-la'' "to eat" → ''-l'''iwa''''' "to be eaten"
* ''-nywa'' "to drink" → ''-nyw'''ewa''''' "to be drunk"
* ''-pa'' "to give to" → ''-p'''ewa''''' "to be given; to receive"
* ''-nya'' "to shit; drop (rain)" → ''-ny'''ewa''''' "to be shat; be dropped"
* ''-cha'' "to fear; revere" → ''-ch'''iwa''''' "to be feared; revered"
Most loan-verbs simply add ''-wa''.
* ''-hitaji'' "to need" → ''-hitaji'''wa''''' "to be needed" 
* ''-kodi'' "to rent; hire" → ''-kodi'''wa''''' "to be rented; be hired" 
* ''-samehe'' "to forgive" → ''-samehe'''wa''''' "to be forgiven" 
* ''-dai'' "to claim" → ''-dai'''wa''''' "to be claimed" 
If a loan-verb ends with a consonant followed by -u, this ''u'' becomes an ''i'' 
* ''-laumu'' "to blame" → ''-laum'''iwa''''' "to be blamed"
* ''-jaribu'' "to try" → ''-jarib'''iwa''''' "to be tried" 
Loan-verbs which end in ''-au'' add ''-liwa''
* ''-sahau'' "to forget" → ''-sahau'''liwa''''' "to be forgotten" 
Verbs ending in ''-uu'' lose one ''u'' and replace it with ''-liwa''.
* ''-nukuu'' "to copy; transcribe; transliterate" → ''-nuku'''-liwa''''' "to be copied; be transcribed; be transliterated"

The agent in a sentence with a passive verb does not need to be included in the sentence. The passive verb, however, does explicitly allude to the existence of an agent, in contrast to the [[#Mediopassive|mediopassive]] below. When the agent is included in the sentence, it is introduced by the preposition ''na'', which is here the equivalent of the English "by", although in other contexts it is more usually equivalent to "and" or "with".

==== Mediopassive ====
The [[Mediopassive voice|mediopassive]] suffix is added to a transitive verb in order to promote its object to the role of subject without the implication of an agent. The form of the suffix involves ends in ''-ka'' and generally the harmonic ''i'' or ''e'' before it, although this may be dropped in verbs with a vowel final root; alternatively, the lost ''l'' of final vowel combinations may reappear and act as a buffer for the harmonic ''i'' or ''e''.

* ''-vunja'' "to break (something)" → ''-vunj'''ika''''' "to break" (intransitive)
* ''-pika'' "to cook (something)" → ''-pik'''ika''''' "to cook" (intransitive)
* ''-elewa'' "to understand (something)" → ''-elew'''eka''''' "to be understood"
* ''-sikia'' "to hear" → ''-siki'''ka''''' "to be heard; be audible"
* ''-kaa'' "to sit; stay; inhabit" → ''-ka'''lika''''' "to be inhabited; be inhabitable"
* ''-zoea'' "to get used to; grow accustomed to" → ''-zoe'''lika''''' "to become customary"

As with the other derivational suffixes (or "extensions"), loan verbs generally lose their final vowel before adding '''''-ika''''' or '''''-eka''''' according to vowel harmony rules, The exceptions are those ending in '''''-au''''' which use '''''-lika''''.

* ''-haribu'' "to spoil (something); ruin; destroy" → ''-harib'''ika''''' "to spoil; get spoiled; get ruined; get destroyed"
* ''-sahau'' "to forget" → ''-sahau'''lika''''' "to cook" (intransitive)
* ''-kebehi'' "to ridicule; make fun of" → ''-kebeh'''ika''''' "to get ridiculed; get made fun of"

In learner materials, the mediopassive suffix generally erroneously described as the "'''stative''' extension" despite the fact that the resulting verbs do not generally fulfil the requirements stative: namely that they describe unchanging states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seidl|first=Amanda|last2=Dimitriadis|first2=Alexis|date=2003|title=Statives and reciprocal morphology in Swahili|url=http://www.let.uu.nl/users/Alexis.Dimitriadis/personal/papers/discon-long-ms04.pdf|journal=Typologie des langues d’Afrique et universaux de la grammaire|volume= 1: Approches transversales, domaine bantou|pages=239–284|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the mediopassive verb ''-vunj'''ika''''' "to break; go to pieces" contrasts with its source verb ''-vunja'' "to break; make go to pieces", not in the quality of being either stative or dynamic — both are dynamic, describing a process that changes over time — but in that the subject of ''-vunjika'' is equivalent to the object of ''-vunja'', and the subject of ''-vunja'' is completely absent from a clause with ''-vunj'''ika'''''. In this respect, mediopassive verbs are the same as passive verbs, however they are distinguished by their incompatibility with any mention of an agent. Compare the following three examples.

Mediopassive verbs often have the appearance of being stative when used in the perfect. However, this is a function of the perfect, which focuses on the present relevance of a past action, rather than a function of the mediopassive itself. For example, the sentence "''Dirisha li'''me'''vunjika,''" means either "The window &lt;u&gt;has&lt;/u&gt; broken," or "The window &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt; broken." What is being said is that the window broke in the past, but that the effects of this action are still relevant in the present. The verb itself, ''-vunjika'', does not describe the state of being broken, but rather the dynamic process of changing from "whole; in tact" to "broken; in pieces". The perfect ''-me-'' here indicates that we are concerned with the state after the dynamic process.

==== Reversive ====
==== Suffix stacking ====
Suffixes can be stacked upon each other to make quite long verb stems with specific meanings. The passive suffix must always be last in Swahili.

* ''-andika'' "to write" → -''andik'''wa''''' "to be written"
* ''-andika'' "to write" → ''-andik'''isha''''' "to cause to write" → ''-andikish'''wa''''' "to be caused to write"
* ''-andika'' "to write" → ''-andik'''ia''''' "to write to" → ''-andiki'''wa''''' "to be written to"
* ''-andika'' "to write" → ''-andik'''ia''''' "to write to" → ''-andiki'''ana''''' "to write to each other" → -''andikian'''isha''''' "to cause to write to each other" → -''andikianish'''wa''''' "to be caused to write to each other"

Here is another rather more implausible example:
* ''-la'' "to eat" 
: → ''-l'''ika''''' "to be edible" 
:: → ''-lik'''ia''''' "to be edible to" 
::: → ''-liki'''ana''''' "to be edible to each other" 
:::: → ''-likian'''isha''''' "to cause to be edible to each other" 
::::: → ''-likianish'''wa''''' "to be caused to be edible to each other"

== Prepositions ==
=== Comitative ''na'' ===
=== Genitive ''-a'' ===

The genitive preposition ''-a'' (sometimes termed a "connector", "possessive" or "associative" preposition) has a similar role to that of the [[genitive case]] of some other languages. It indicates the possessor, or a more general association, and roughly corresponds in meaning to the English preposition "of". It receives a prefix that agrees with the preceding noun's class. For example:

* '''''ki'''tabu '''ch'''a mwanafunzi'' "the student's book" ("book of student")
* '''''vi'''tabu '''vy'''a mwanafunzi'' "the student's books" ("books of student")

The equivalent of English compound nouns are often formed with genitive constructions, such as ''taa ya barabarani'' "traffic light", "street light", which is literally equivalent to "light of road-LOC".

The personal pronouns each have their own genitive stem, for example:

*'''''ki'''tabu '''ch'''ake'' "his/her book"

The genitive preposition is formed from the subject concord of verbs (which you can see [[#Subject_and_object_concords|here]]), plus ''-a''. There are some sound changes that happen. ''U-'' and ''i-'' become their equivalent semivowels ''w-'' and ''y-'' respectively. After consonants, this '''y''' is generally dropped although ''ki-'' and ''vi-'' become ''ch-'' and ''vy-''. The class 1 verbal concord ''a-'' is an exception, being replaced with ''w-'' in the genitive construction.

==== ''kwa'' ====
The word ''kwa'' is a very frequently encountered preposition in Swahili. It may be regarded as either the class 15 or class 17 variant of ''-a''. Where there is no 15 or class 17 [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]], its function is adverbial, relating to the action expressed by the sentence rather than to a particular noun within it. It may be equivalent to a wide variety of prepositions in English, but it possibly frequently equivalent to an [[instrumental case|instrumental]] use of "by (means of)", "using" or "with". In standard Swahili, it may indicate a location associated with an animate referent, but is replaced by ''kwenye'' for inanimate referents.

* ''Tulikuja kwa miguu.'' "We came on foot." (Literally: "We came by feet.")
* ''Alirudi kwa Rehema.'' "She returned to Rehema's (place)."

=== Ornative ''-enye'' ===

The [[Ornative case|ornative]] preposition ''-enye'' essentially means "having" or "with" and takes the same prefixes as the genitive '''-a''' with the exception of class 1, where it receives the prefix ''mw-'' instead of ''w-''. The word ''-enye'' is followed by a noun.

'''Syllable stress of botanical names''' &lt;!-- Suggested move title, as syllable stress of classical botanical names is simply syllable stress of classical Latin --&gt;varies with the language spoken by the person using the botanical name. In English-speaking countries, the Botanical Latin places syllable stress for botanical names derived from ancient Greek and Latin broadly according to two systems, either the [[Reformed academic pronunciation]], or the pronunciation developed initially in some large part by [[United Kingdom|British]] gardeners, horticulturists, naturalists, and botanists of the 19th century. The two systems of pronunciation are sometimes referred to as the "classical method" and the "ecclesiastical method".&lt;ref name=Traupman&gt;{{cite book |author=Traupman, J.C. |year=1966  |title=The New College Latin &amp; English Dictionary |publisher=Bantam Books  |isbn=0-553-27619-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two systems differ significantly in pronunciation,{{ref|Alpha|α}} but little in syllable stress.&lt;ref name=Traupman/&gt;

What follow are the rules of stress of reformed academic pronunciation of Latin (intended to approximate the stress rules of ancient spoken Latin). Words of Greek origin are generally pronounced according to the same rules; native ancient Greek rules of stress are not used.

Generally in Latin each vowel or diphthong  belongs to a single syllable. Classical Latin diphthongs are ae, au, and oe. Diphthongs from Greek can include oi, eu, ei, and ou, and ui also occasionally occurs in botanical Latin. Syllables end in vowels, unless there are multiple consonants, in which case the consonants are divided between the two syllables, with certain consonants being treated as pairs. In words of two syllables, the stress is on the first syllable. Words that contain three or more syllables have stresses accorded to their syllables by the quality and location of the different vowels in the words. In words of more than two syllables, the stress is on the [[penult]]imate syllable when the syllable contains a long vowel or diphthong, otherwise the stress is on the [[antepenult]]imate syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Whether a vowel is long or short in a classical Latin word is a function of the vowel and its relationship to the consonants that precede or follow it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Botanical Latin does not traditionally include macrons or breves, and they are prohibited (as diacritics) by the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (Article 60.6). Some books follow the mediaeval tradition to add an acute accent to mark the stressed syllable.&lt;!-- Some of which books, this is confusing in light of immediately proceeding comments on the subject. --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Rules==
To determine the position of the stress of Latin terms:{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}
 
* Vowels followed by two consonants are generally stressed. Thus ''Po-ten-tíl-la'', as the I is followed by a double L.
* Diphthongs are to be stressed, too. Thus ''Al-tháe-a'', as AE is a diphthong.

* [[Traditional English pronunciation of Latin]]
* [[Latin regional pronunciation]]

==Notes==
:{{note|Alpha|α}}Significant differences between the two systems occur in pronunciation of diphthongs "ae", "eu", "oi", consonants "c", "g", "m", "s", "w", "x", and consonant groups "bs", "bt", "cc", "gg", "gn", "ph", "sc", "ti".&lt;ref name=Traupman/&gt;

'''Tacet''' is [[Latin]] which translates literally into English as "(it) is silent" (pronounced: {{IPA|/ˈte.sət/}}, {{IPA|/ˈtæ.sət/}}; or {{IPA|/ˈtɑ.ˌkɛt/}}).&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Tacet|accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a musical term to indicate that an instrument or voice does not sound, also known as a [[rest (music)|rest]]. In vocal polyphony and in orchestral scores, it usually indicates a long period of time, typically an entire [[Movement (music)|movement]]. In more modern music such as [[jazz]], tacet tends to mark considerably shorter breaks. '''Multirests''', or multiple-measure rests, are rests which last multiple [[bar (music)|measures]] (or multiple rests, each of which lasts an entire measure).

{{Quote|Tacet. (Lat.) A word by which the performer is to understand that the instrument with the name of which it is conjoined is to be silent: a ''Violino Tacet''; the violin is not to play: ''Oboe Tacet''; the oboe is silent.|[[Thomas Busby (composer)|Thomas Busby]] (1827)&lt;ref&gt;Busby, Thomas (1827). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uJFRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT272&amp;dq=tacet+music&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOyujejZ_WAhVRyWMKHf0mAfYQ6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=tacet%20music&amp;f=false Complete Dictionary of Music]'', p.z2. Snider. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was common for early [[Symphony|symphonies]] to leave out the [[brass instrument|brass]] or [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] in certain movements, especially in slow (second) movements, and this is the instruction given in the parts for the player to wait until the end of the movement.

[[File:15 bars multirest.png|thumb|How multirests are now notated, known as the H-bar (which may be narrow, leaving room for things such as an [[anacrusis]] to be written in)]]

It is also commonly used in [[accompaniment]] music to indicate that the instrument does not play on a certain run through a portion of the music, i.e., "Tacet 1st time." The phrase ''tacet al fine'' is used to indicate that the performer should remain silent for the remainder of the piece (or portion thereof), and need not, for example, count rests.

Tacet may be appropriate when a particular instrument/voice/section, "is to rest for an entire section, movement, or composition."&lt;ref&gt;McGrain, Mark (1990). ''Music Notation'', p.126. Hal Leonard. {{ISBN|9781476867052}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Partial rests, of course, in every case must be written in. Even though it means 'silent,' the term ''tacet''...is not a wise substitution for a lengthy rest within a movement...The term ''tacet'', therefore, should be used ''only'' to indicate that a player rests throughout an ''entire movement''. In printed music this would be indicated:"&lt;ref&gt;[[Gardner Read|Read, Gardner]] (1969/1979). ''Music Notation: A Manual of Modern Practice'', p.435-7. 2nd edition.

==Uses of tacet==
The earliest known usage of the term is 1724.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;

A unique usage of this term is in [[John Cage|John Cage's]] 1952 composition [[4′33″]].  A tacet is indicated for all three movements, for all instruments.  The piece lasts a total of 4 minutes and 33 seconds, without a note being played.

[[File:Page from The Indian Antiquary.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cover page of a 1931 edition of ''The Indian Antiquary'']]
'''''The Indian Antiquary, A journal of oriental research in archaeology, history, literature, language, philosophy, religion, folklore, &amp;c, &amp;c,''''' (subtitle varies) was a journal of original research relating to India, published between 1872 and 1933. It was founded by the archaeologist [[James Burgess (archaeologist)|James Burgess]] to enable the sharing of knowledge between scholars based in Europe and in India and was notable for the high quality of its epigraphic illustrations which enabled scholars to make accurate translations of texts that in many cases remain the definitive versions to this day. It was also pioneering in its recording of Indian [[folklore]]. It was succeeded by ''The New Indian Antiquary'' (1938-47) and the ''Indian Antiquary'' (1964-71).

==History==
''The Indian Antiquary'' was founded in 1872 by the archaeologist [[James Burgess (archaeologist)|James Burgess]] [[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]] as a journal of original research relating to India. It was designed to enable the sharing of knowledge between scholars based in Europe and in India.&lt;ref name=Pros&gt;[http://indianhistorybooks.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/indian-antiquary-vol-i-1872.pdf Prospectus] in ''The Indian Antiquary'', Part 1, 5 January 1872, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Indian Antiquary" in ''[[The Antiquaries Journal]]'', Vol. 2, No. 2, April 1922, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The journal was a private venture,&lt;ref name=Temp&gt;[[Richard Carnac Temple|Temple, Richard Carnac]]. (1922) ''[https://archive.org/details/fiftyyearsofthei00temprich Fifty years of The Indian Antiquary]''. Mazgaon, Bombay: B. Miller, British India Press, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; although no contributor or editor was ever paid for their work and the editors often had to support the publication out of their own pockets.&lt;ref name=Temp/&gt; Burgess was the first editor and he continued in that role until the end of 1884 when failing eyesight forced him to hand over to John Faithfull Fleet and [[Richard Carnac Temple]].&lt;ref name=Temp/&gt;

The late nineteenth century was marked by a great increase in the number of local historical societies in India and a similar increase in the number of Indians who could speak and write English, to the extent that by the 1920s the entire journal could have been filled with work by Indian contributors.&lt;ref name="Temple, p. 7"/&gt; Volumes for 1925 to 1932 were published under the authority of the Council of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Anthropological Institute]] (1933, not).&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; The first incarnation of the ''Antiquary'' ceased publication in 1933 with volume 62, number 783 (Dec. 1933),&lt;ref name=sun&gt;[http://suncat.ac.uk/serials/SC00623823801/all ''Indian antiquary''.] Suncat.

Retrieved 9 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''New Indian Antiquary''''' was published between 1938&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southasiaarchive.com/Content/sarf.120202 ''New Indian Antiquary''.] South Asia Archive, 2014. Retrieved 30 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1947, and the '''''Indian Antiquary''''' (described as the "third series") between 1964 and 1971.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;''Indian Antiquary'', British Library catalogue search, 29 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (Volumes 14 to 62 of the original ''Antiquary'' were described as the "second series".)&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Antiquary'', British Library catalogue search, 10 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The journal had an archaeological and historical focus, and in the late nineteenth century that naturally meant that [[epigraphy]] (the study of inscriptions as writing rather than as literature) would be one of the principal subjects covered in its pages.&lt;ref name=Sal&gt;{{cite book|author=Salomon, Richard (1998)|title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC&amp;pg=PA219|date=|location= New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-535666-3|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the ''Antiquary'' was the premier source of European scholarship on Indian epigraphy until the twentieth century and the official Indian government journal of epigraphy, the ''[[Epigraphia Indica]]'', was published as a quarterly supplement to the ''Antiquary'' between 1892 and 1920.&lt;ref name=Temp/&gt;

The ''Antiquary'' was printed at [[Mazgaon]], Bombay, by the [[Bombay Education Society]] and later the British India Press, but illustrations were produced in London by the firm of Griggs who were known for the accuracy of their work.&lt;ref name=Temple.p.6/&gt; A high standard of reproduction was essential so that scholars could work on the epigraphic material without needing to see the originals.&lt;ref name=Temple.p.6&gt;Temple, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrations in the ''Antiquary'' were used by scholars such as Bhandarkar, [[Bhagvanlal Indraji]], [[Georg Bühler]], [[John Faithfull Fleet]], Eggeling and B. Lewis Rice to decipher important inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://asi.nic.in/asi_aboutus_history.asp ''History'',] [[Archaeological Survey of India]], 2011. Retrieved 30 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and in many cases their translations remain the definitive versions to this day.&lt;ref name=Sal/&gt;

Over one thousand plates were included in ''The Indian Antiquary'' and the ''Epigraphia Indica'' over the first fifty years of publication, but having the illustrations produced abroad was not without its disadvantages. On one occasion during World War I, enemy action meant that expensive plates had to be sent from London three times before they reached Bombay safely.&lt;ref name=Temple.p.6/&gt;

Another area where the ''Antiquary'' led was in recording folklore and folktales. Its publication of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] folktales was the first attempt to classify the events on which folk tales were based&lt;ref name="Temple, p. 7"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/fiftyyearsofthei00temprich#page/6/mode/2up Temple, p. 7.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the pioneering work on north Indian folklore of [[William Crooke]] and [[Ram Gharib Chaube|Pandit Ram Gharib Chaube]] was printed in its pages.&lt;ref name="CrookeChaube2002"&gt;"Introduction" by Sadhana Naithani in {{cite book|author1=William Crooke|author2=Pandit Ram Gharib Chaube|author3=|title=Folktales from Northern India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RcK2l0yE1OsC&amp;pg=PT38|date=2002|location=Santa Barbara|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-698-9|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Truth in Translation''''' is a stage play conceived and directed by [[Michael Lessac]], with music by [[Hugh Masekela]]. It tells the story of the [[interpreter]]s at [[South Africa]]'s [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]]. 

The play was written in a collaboration between the interpreters who worked at the TRC, writer Paavo Tom Tammi and the company of South African actors. It premiered in [[Rwanda]], has toured [[South Africa]] and is touring to international conflict zones such as [[Northern Ireland]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[the Balkans]], [[Jerusalem]]/[[Ramallah]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Peru]], and [[Indonesia]]/[[Timor]] to tell the story of the South African experience. The project includes workshops with audiences, exhibitions ([[The Forgiveness Project]] and Jillian Edelstein's ''Truth and Lies'') and filming of the interaction between audiences and the company, and attempts to provoke a global dialogue around notions of healing and reconciliation.

At 14, she joined [[Jewish Labor Bund]] and in 1942 the [[Jewish Combat Organization]]. Vladka's mother, brother, and sister died in [[Treblinka extermination camp]].&lt;ref name=RadioPoland-Obit-2012&gt;{{cite news|last=NH|first=|title=WWII Jewish courier Vladka Meed dies|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/119394,WWII-Jewish-courier-Vladka-Meed-dies|accessdate=16 May 2015|work=[[Radio Poland]]|date=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vladka and her future husband [[Benjamin Meed]] pretended to be [[Aryan race|Aryan]]s and helped organize the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]].

In 1981, the Meeds founded the [[American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors and their Descendants|American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes-BenjaminMeed-Obit-2006&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fox|first1=Margalit|title=Benjamin Meed, 88, Who Was a Key Advocate for Holocaust Survivors, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/26/obituaries/26meed.html|accessdate=16 May 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYSun-BenjaminMeed-Obit-2006&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Stephen|title=Benjamin Meed, 88, Organized Holocaust Survivors|url=http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/benjamin-meed-88-organized-holocaust-survivors/42352/|accessdate=16 May 2015|work=[[New York Sun]]|date=26 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vladka Meed's book "On Both Sides of the Wall" was originally published in [[Yiddish]] in 1948 with a first hand account of her wartime experiences. The book was translated into English in 1972 (with a foreword by [[Elie Wiesel]]), and later into [[German language|German]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost-Obit-2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bernstein|first1=Adam|title=Vladka Meed, courier for the Jewish resistance during WWII, dies at 90|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/vladka-meed-courier-for-the-jewish-resistance-during-wwii-dies-at-90/2012/11/22/96518e5c-34c9-11e2-bfd5-e202b6d7b501_story.html|accessdate=16 May 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also published in ''[[The Forward]]'' newspaper.

In computing, the term '''wheel''' refers to a user account with a ''wheel bit'', a system setting that provides additional special [[Privilege (computing)|system privileges]] that empower a user to execute restricted commands that ordinary [[user account]]s cannot access.&lt;ref name=jargonwheel&gt;{{cite web|title=Wheel |url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/W/wheel.html |accessdate=2017-04-22 |work= Jargon File 4.4.7 |publisher=Eric S. Raymond }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jargonwheelbit/&gt;

== Origins ==
The term ''wheel'' was first applied to computer user privilege levels after the introduction of the [[TOPS-20#TENEX|TENEX]] [[operating system]], later distributed under the name [[TOPS-20]] in the 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref name=jargonwheelbit&gt;{{cite web|title=Wheel bit |url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/W/wheel-bit.html |accessdate=2017-04-22 |work= Jargon File 4.4.7 |publisher=Eric S. Raymond }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jargontwenex&gt;{{cite web |title= TWENEX|url= http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/T/TWENEX.html |accessdate=2008-09-12 |work=Jargon File 4.4.7 |publisher=Eric S. Raymond }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was derived from the slang phrase ''[[wikt:big wheel|big wheel]]'', referring to a person with great power or influence.&lt;ref name=jargonwheel/&gt;

In the 1980s, the term was imported into [[Unix]] culture due to the migration of operating system developers and users from TENEX/TOPS-20 to Unix.&lt;ref name=jargonwheelbit/&gt;

== Wheel group ==
Modern Unix systems generally use [[Group identifier (Unix)|user groups]] as a [[security (computers)|security]] protocol to control access privileges. The ''wheel'' group is a special user group used on some Unix systems to control access to the [[Su (Unix)|su]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://man.openbsd.org/su|title=su(1) - OpenBSD manual pages|website=man.openbsd.org|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=su&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+11.1-RELEASE+and+Ports&amp;arch=default&amp;format=html|title=su|website=www.freebsd.org|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Sudo (Unix)|sudo]] command, which allows a user to masquerade as another user (usually the [[Superuser|super user]]).&lt;ref name=jargonwheel/&gt;&lt;ref name=jargonwheelbit/&gt;&lt;ref name=levi&gt;{{cite book|title=UNIX Administration: A Comprehensive Sourcebook for Effective Systems and Network Management |first=Bozidar |last=Levi |publisher=CRC Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-8493-1351-1 |page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wheel war ==
The phrase '''wheel war''', which originated at [[Stanford University]],&lt;ref name=jargon1990&gt;{{cite web |title= Jargon File |author= Raymond et al. |url= http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-2.1.1.dos.txt |work=Jargon File 2.1.1 |accessdate=2016-08-15 |publisher=Eric S. Raymond}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first documented in the 1983 version of [[The Jargon File]].  A 'wheel war' was characterized as a part of an immature 'larval phase' wherein students with [[Privilege (computing)|administrative privileges]] would attempt to lock each other out of a university's [[multi-user]] (''see also:[[Multiseat configuration|multiseat]]'') computer system, sometimes causing unintentional harm to other users.&lt;ref name=jargon1983&gt;{{cite web |title= Jargon File |author= Steele et al. |url= http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-1.5.0.dos.txt |work=Jargon File 1.5.0 |accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By January 2006, it had come into colloquial use amongst [[Wikipedia administrator]]s in reference to the misuse of administrative tools by one administrator against another administrator, during editor disagreements and disputes.&lt;ref name=wikiwheelwar&gt;{{cite web |title= Wikipedia:Wheel War|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wheel_war&amp;oldid=34591218 |work=Wheel War description page on Wikipedia, revision 34591218 |date=2006-01-10 |accessdate=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
