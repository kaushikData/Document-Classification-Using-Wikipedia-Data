==Early life and education==
Diniz is the first of the six children born to Floripes Pires and Valentim Diniz. His father, Valentim, was born in 1913 in the countryside of Portugal, and immigrated to Brazil in November 1929.

Diniz studied at Anglo-Latino school and Mackenzie high school. He graduated in 1956 from the School of Business Administration of Fundação Getúlio Vargas. In 1965, Diniz traveled to the United States to study Marketing at Ohio University and Economics at Columbia University, in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u33900.shtml|title=Saiba mais sobre a família Diniz, uma das mais tradicionais de SP|language=PT|work=Folha de S.Paulo|date=July 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="folha.uol.com.br"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2008/03/382687-corpo-do-fundador-do-pao-de-acucar-e-enterrado-em-sao-paulo.shtml|title=Corpo do fundador do Pão de Açúcar é enterrado em São Paulo|language=PT|work=Folha de S.Paulo|date=March 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Diniz's father, Valentim Diniz, founded the company Pão de Açúcar in September 1948. Abilio Diniz began to work for his at Doceria Pão de Açúcar at the age of 12. In April 1959, the same year he graduated from FGV in Business Administration, he partnered with his father to create the first Pão de Açúcar supermarket store, located on Brigadeiro Luiz Antônio Avenue, in São Paulo. In 1960, after the first store was established, Diniz traveled for four months throughout Europe and the United States to observe the operation of the retail sector abroad. The second Pão de Açúcar location on Maria Antonia Street, downtown São Paulo, was established in 1963. One year later, Pão de Açúcar acquired Quiko and Tip Top supermarkets. During the 60's and 70's, Grupo Pão de Açúcar was the first supermarket chain to set up a store in a shopping mall (Iguatemi, in São Paulo), to have a 24-hour pharmacy, and to set up a data processing center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=O Que Aprendi Com Meu Pai|language=PT|publisher=Vida Util|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Como Ele Fez"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Como Ele Fez Crescer O Pão|language=PT|publisher=Pequenas Empresas &amp; Grandes Negócios|pages=40–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diniz studied the operations of Paris-based Carrefour in 1967 after Luiz Carlos Bresser-Pereira, who worked at Pão de Açúcar, introduced him to Carrefour cofounder Marcel Fournier. Diniz was a co-founder of the Brazilian Association of Supermarkets in 1968. Inspired by the Carrefour hypermarket model, Diniz founded Jumbo, the first hypermarket in Brazil, in Santo André in 1971. In 1976 he acquired Eletroradiobraz, the second largest chain of supermarkets and hypermarkets in Brazil at the time,. The company consisted of eight supermarkets, 26 hypermarkets, 16 stores and a warehouse.&lt;ref name="abril.com.br"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://exame.abril.com.br/negocios/18-disputas-que-abilio-diniz-ja-enfrentou/#4|title=18 disputas que Abilio Diniz já enfrentou|language=PT|work=Exame|date=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Diniz moved away from Pão de Açúcar and became part of the National Monetary Council at the urging of the Minister of Planning, Mario Henrique Simonsen. There, he coordinated the production of economic bulletins.&lt;ref name="Como Ele Fez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abril.com.br"/&gt;

In 1989, Valentim asked Diniz to take over the leadership of Pão de Açúcar. Valentim remained part of the group's board of directors. In March 1990 the Collor government implemented an economic plan which put Pão de Açúcar on the verge of bankruptcy. Diniz implemented the practice "cut, concentrate and simplify" and made cuts across the company. He sold the building which had served as the company's headquarters since 1986 in 1992. The company, which had 626 stores in 1985, was reduced to 262 stores by 1992. However, family conflicts threatened the company.&lt;ref name="uol.com.br"/&gt;&lt;ref name="folha.uol.com.br"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abril.com.br"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Como Ele Fez"/&gt; In an agreement signed in November 1993, Diniz was given the majority control of Grupo Pão de Açúcar.&lt;ref name="folha.uol.com.br"/&gt; His parents received 36.5% of the company shares and his sister, Lucília, held 12% of the company shares. Diniz led Grupo Pão de Açúcar through an IPO in 1997 and it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the first 100% national controlled company to conduct a global stock issue (in Brazil, the United States and Europe). In 1999, the French group Casino acquired 24.5% of the voting capital of the group for $854 500 million. In 2000, Diniz transitioned the company into Companhia Brasileira de Distribuição, which became one of the largest retail chains in the country.&lt;ref name="Como Ele Fez"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epocanegocios.globo.com/Revista/Common/0,,EMI108574-16355,00-GRUPO+PAO+DE+ACUCAR+COMPRA+CASAS+BAHIA.html|title=Grupo Pão de Açúcar compra Casas Bahia|language=PT|work=Época Negócios|date=April 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://economia.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,pao-de-acucar-compra-a-casas-bahia-por-meio-da-globex,476631|title=Pão de Açúcar compra a Casas Bahia por meio da Globex|language=PT|work=O Estado de S. Paulo|date=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Diniz sold a large stake to the French company [[Casino Group]] for an estimated $860&amp;nbsp;million and stepped down as CEO, but remained as chairman. In 2009, in one of the most expensive transactions of the Brazilian business history, Grupo Pão de Açúcar bought [[Casas Bahia]] from [[Samuel Klein (businessman)|Samuel Klein]], giving Abilio control of Pão de Açúcar, Casas Bahia, Ponto Frio and [[Extra Hipermercados]].&lt;ref name="EstadaoEconomia"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://economia.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,pao-de-acucar-compra-a-casas-bahia-por-meio-da-globex,476631 |title=Pao de Acucar compra Casas Bahia por meio da Globex |language=PT|work=Estadao}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EpocaNeg"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epocanegocios.globo.com/Revista/Common/0,,EMI108574-16355,00-GRUPO+PAO+DE+ACUCAR+COMPRA+CASAS+BAHIA.html |title=Grupo Pao de Acucar compra Casas Bahia |language=PT|work=Epoca Neg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Casino Group took control of Grupo Pão de Açúcar and Diniz no longer had operational functions within the group but remained as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/22/paodeacucar-casino-idUSL1E8HL9JG20120622 New era dawns at Pão de Açúcar, Casino takes helm], ''Reuters'', June 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

He later became the chairman of the company's board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forbes.uol.com.br/negocios/2017/07/abilio-diniz-o-brasil-nao-pode-parar/|title=Abilio Diniz: "O Brasil não pode parar"|language=PT|work=Forbes Brasil|date=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, Diniz was elected as chairman of BRF, He helped lead the company through a broad restructuring.

The book discussed Diniz's departure from Grupo Pão de Açúcar and his career after the departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://exame.abril.com.br/negocios/livro-esmiuca-trajetoria-de-abilio-diniz-o-rei-do-varejo/|title=Livro esmiúça trajetória de Abilio Diniz, o "rei do varejo"|language=PT|work=Exame|date=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Diniz launched his second book, ''Novos Caminhos, Novas Escolhas'' (New Paths, New Choices), released by publisher Objetiva (Companhia das Letras Group), which discussed the transitions in his life over the previous 12 years. In March 2017 the French version of the book was released, and later an English version was sold in the American market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2016/11/1829566-abilio-relata-em-livro-banho-no-filho-e-saida-do-pao-de-acucar.shtml|title=Abilio relata em livro banho no filho e saída do Pão de Açúcar|language=PT|work=Folha de S.Paulo|date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In August 2011, Diniz was notified by the Federal Public Ministry of Brazil to give explanations in a criminal investigation. Diniz's next move was to then call criminal lawyer Marcio Thomaz Bastos, one of the most well-known criminal lawyers for those who had wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/08/p-acucar-cbd-investigation-idUSL1N0ZO0UD20150708 Brazil's GPA unable to account for payments to former minister], Reuters, July 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Diniz was president of the board of directors for Pão de Açúcar. During the 2010 elections, the offices of Bastos had helped Diniz pay 5.5&amp;nbsp;million reais, to congressman Antonio Palocci to help fund the presidential campaign of [[Dilma Rousseff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://epoca.globo.com/tempo/noticia/2015/06/auditoria-do-pao-de-acucar-diz-que-palocci-recebeu-r-55-mi-sem-prestar-servico.html Auditoria do Pão de Açúcar diz que Palocci recebeu R$ 5,5 mi sem prestar serviço], Epoca Globo, June 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

After the discovery of contracts, drafts, notes, emails and other internal documents by TIME story, which all aimed to justify the payments to Palocci, the company GPA decided to establish an audit team to investigate the money given to Palocci in attempt to set things right. Two months after this, the audit team found no evidence that states Palocci aided the group whatsoever, giving the notion of corruption in this particular case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsa-conso.fr/soupcon-de-corruption-pour-abilio-diniz,215328 Soupçon de corruption pour Abilio Diniz], LSA Conso, July 10, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kidnapping==
{{Main|Kidnapping of Abilio Diniz}}
In December 1989, Diniz was the victim of a sensational political kidnapping, followed by a police rescue. He was confined for six days in a small space under a house, with a duct leading to the kitchen fan as his only source of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerenblankfeld/2011/07/13/brazilian-billionaire-loses-deal-of-a-lifetime/#63d29175668b|title=Brazilian Billionaire Loses Deal of a Lifetime|work=Forbes|date=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/04/world/kidnapped-brazilian-ad-executive-is-freed-in-a-police-raid.html|title=Kidnapped Brazilian Ad Executive Is Freed in a Police Raid|work=The New York Times|date=February 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kidnapping took place in the morning of the Brazilian presidential elections in Brazil in 1989.

Among the kidnappers were Canadians [[Kidnapping of Abilio dos Santos Diniz#David Spencer|David Spencer]] and [[Christine Lamont]], who were students at [[Simon Fraser University]] in British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kidnappers-lamont-spencer-freed-1.186864 |title=Kidnappers Lamont, Spencer freed|work=CBC|date=January 29, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamont and Spencer denied any participation in the kidnapping but their participation was proved when a secret weapons cache in Managua exploded (among the material exposed by the explosion were documents that linked both Lamont and Spencer to the Diniz kidnapping). Faced with these revelations, Lamont admitted that they had been involved in the kidnapping.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite book | last = Isabel Vincent| authorlink = Isabel Vincent| title = No Evil: The Strange Case of Christine Lamont and David Spencer|edition= May 1997|page= 212 | publisher = Reed International Books| isbn= 0-433-39619-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamont and Spencer were sentenced to 28 years in prison for their involvement, but were kept in private cells, away from the mass of the prison population. The Canadian press and public started a major movement to secure their release, straining relations between Brazil and Canada. However, two Canadian investigative journalists, [[Isabel Vincent]] of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and [[Caroline Mallan]] of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', wrote books concluding that Lamont and Spencer were likely guilty, and they were being treated well by Brazilian authorities. Lamont confessed to involvement in the kidnapping, which was meant to raise money for [[Sandinista]] [[guerrillas]], and the two were released and deported to Canada in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2016/07/17/canadians-in-captivity-far-from-home/|title=Canadians in captivity, far from home|work=iPolitics|date=July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23003">'''Alejandro Paul Vandenbroele''' is an [[Argentina|Argentinian]]-[[Belgium|Belgian]] lawyer and businessman who is a leading figure in the Argentinian financial scandal known both as Boudougate and as “Caso Ciccone,” which erupted in February 2012. As president of a [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-based firm called [[The Old Fund]], he has been accused of being a front man for Argentinian Vice President [[Amado Boudou]] and for Boudou's business partner [[Núñez Carmona]] in a purported scheme involving the purchase and control of the printing house Ciccone Calcografica, later known as Compañía de Valores Sudamericana (American Securities Company), or CVS, which printed banknotes and documents for the government of Argentina.&lt;ref name=este&gt;{{cite web| last =Leuco| first =Diego| title =Las vacaciones VIP del socio de Boudou| work =Perfil| url =http://noticias.perfil.com/2013-01-07-19885-las-vacaciones-vip-del-socio-de-boudou-en-punta-del-este/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public comments and testimony of Vandenbroele's wife, Laura Muñoz, played a major role in exposing the Boudougate scandal and in incriminating Vandenbroele and other principals. In addition to being tried in Argentina, Vandenbroele was also wanted in [[Uruguay]] on charges of money laundering.&lt;ref name=este/&gt;

{{Main|Boudougate}}

==Career==

===2008===
Vandenbroele first appeared in business records in March 2008 as a shareholder in Madrid-based Agroibérica de Inversiones SA, a firm purportedly involved in the “production, distribution, import and export of food and drinks.”&lt;ref name=sepr&gt;{{cite web| title =SE ESCAPO LA TORTUGA: VANDENBROELE FUE PRESIDENTE DE LA EX CICCONE UN MES ANTES DE ASUMIR LA PRESIDENCIA DE THE OLD FOUND.| work =Seprin| date =May 19, 2014| url =http://seprin.info/2014/05/19/se-escapo-la-tortuga-vandenbroele-fue-presidente-de-la-ex-ciccone-un-mes-antes-de-asumir-la-presidencia-de-the-old-found/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009===
In 2009, he became a shareholder in Buenos Aires-based Ruta Sur Rentals SA, which rents out motorhomes, RVs, and other vehicles and has German and Dutch owners.&lt;ref name=sepr/&gt;

===2010===
In July 2010, the Argentinian tax agency, the Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos (AFIP), called on Calcográfica Ciccone to declare bankruptcy. Calcográfica Ciccone was one of Argentina's most important printers, “often working for the state on such sensitive issues as the printing of banknotes, identity documents, and passports,” and owed the national treasury 239 million pesos.&lt;ref name=arch&gt;{{cite web|title=Vandenbroele, el amigo de Boudou, se instaló en Mendoza |work=Los Andes |date=Jun 1, 2013 |url=http://archivo.losandes.com.ar/notas/2013/6/1/vandenbroele-amigo-boudou-instalo-mendoza-718014.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020080405/http://archivo.losandes.com.ar/notas/2013/6/1/vandenbroele-amigo-boudou-instalo-mendoza-718014.asp |archivedate=2014-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later, with backing from Amado Boudou, who at the time was Economy Minister, the AFIP reversed itself and allowed Ciccone to refinance its debt. A Netherlands-based corporation named The Old Fund, described by ''Clarin'' as a “mysterious company,” whose only public face was Vandenbroele, thereupon invested 2.3 million pesos in Ciccone, and Vandenbroele assumed the presidency of what became known as the “new” Ciccone,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clarin.com/politica/caso-Ciccone_0_678532200.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urgente24.com/197428-boudougate-arden-las-redes-sociales-mientras-la-oposicion-duerme&lt;/ref&gt; the name of which was eventually changed to Compañía de Valores Sudamericana (American Securities Company), or CVS.&lt;ref name=ilic&gt;{{cite web| title =Un fiscal pidió investigar a Boudou y a su novia por enriquecimiento ilícito| work =La Nacion| date= May 14, 2012| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1473160-un-fiscal-imputan-a-boudou-y-a-su-novia-el-delito-de-enriquecimiento-ilicito }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Old Fund owned 70% of the “new” Ciccone, of which it officially took control on October 29, 2010, two days after the death of Néstor Kirchner.&lt;ref name=urug&gt;{{cite web| last =Cappiello| first =Hernan| title =Uruguay investiga a la sociedad que maneja Ciccone| work =La Nacion| date =Jun 26, 2012| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1485221-uruguay-investiga-a-la-sociedad-que-maneja-ciccone}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the founders of the company, Nicholas Ciccone, and the two daughters of his deceased brother, Hector, owned 30%.&lt;ref name=gobr&gt;{{cite web| last =Mon| first =Hugo Alconado| title =Ahora Vandenbroele acusa al Gobierno| work =La Nacion| date =Apr 11, 2013| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1571515-cont-vandenbroele-acusa-al-gobierno-de-intentar-vaciar-la-ex-ciccone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 report indicated that The Old Fund was incorporated in 2008 by two Argentinians, Eduardo Alberto Razzetti and Carlos Fabian Dorado and that Vandenbroele took control of the firm as a shareholder in or shortly prior to September 2010. In that same month, according to the same 2014 report, a firm called London Supply contributed $1.8 million to The Old Fund, one of whose shareholders at the time was Michelangelo Castilian, a longtime friend of Boudou and Núñez Carmona. Vandenbroele officially became president of CVS on October 21, 2010, with Jose María Capirone, a former partner of Núñez Carmona and Boudou, serving as his second-in-command, and assumed the presidency of the Old Fund on November 17, 2010. In that same month, Vandenbroele became deputy director, owner, and president of The Old Fund, another shareholder in which was Sergio Gustavo Martinez, a fugitive from justice in the United States. At around the same time, The Old Fund was paid $7.8 million for alleged technical consultation for the government of [[Taiwan]] in regard to an exchange of public debt with Argentina, a matter in which Boudou was a central player. This report stated that The Old Fund spent 567,000 pesos to reverse the bankruptcy of Calcográfica Ciccone and that Núñez Carmona, according to Vandenbroele's wife, had represented The Old Fund in discussions with the creditors of Ciccone, whom he had persuaded to allow The Old Fund to take over that firm.&lt;ref name=sepr/&gt;

It was noted by several news media that in 2010, immediately prior to his involvement in The Old Fund and Calcográfica Ciccone, Vandenbroele was listed in Argentinian tax rolls as a self-employed person or small-business proprietor in the very lowest tax bracket.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1457419-el-misterio-de-vandenbroele&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012===
These dealings began to erupt into a public scandal in February 2012.&lt;ref name=desp&gt;{{cite web| last =Mon| first =Hugo Alconada| title =Caso Ciccone: desaparece un legajo clave de un ente oficial| work =La Nacion| date= Jun 14, 2012| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1481912-caso-ciccone-desaparece-un-legajo-clave-de-un-ente-oficia}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24, prosecutor Carlos Rivolo traveled to Mendoza where he interviewed Vandenbroele's wife, Laura Muñoz, about her husband's connections to Boudou and Boudou's business partner José María Núñez Carmona. She told Rivolo that her husband was a front man for Boudou and provided Rivolo with documents and an audio tape of conversations between her and Vandenbroele. Muñoz said that her husband and Núñez Carmona ran a “ghost consultancy” in Puerto Madero that handled “money bribes” and that was a front for Boudou. Muñoz also told Rivolo that she had argued with her husband about the illegality of these activities and about his insistence that they move from Buenos Aires to Mendoza because of these activities. The audiotapes contained evidence of these arguments. Muñoz, who had been married to Vandenbroele since 2006, said that she had begun to suspect him of cheating, and while looking through his papers for evidence of an affair, she discovered documents outlining his relationship to Boudou and Núñez Carmona.&lt;ref name=infid&gt;{{cite web| last =Diana| first =Nicolas| title =El motor de la infidelidad| work =Perfil| url =http://noticias.perfil.com/2012-03-02-2947-el-motor-de-la-infidelidad/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vandenbroele reportedly had known Boudou since their youth in Mar del Plata,&lt;ref name=arch/&gt; where Boudou, in his teens, had dated Vandenbroele's cousin Guadalupe Escaray. As of 2012, Escaray was working under Boudou as regional chef of ANSES, the Argentinian social-security administration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lapoliticaonline.com/nota/59190/&lt;/ref&gt; When confronted with Muñoz's claims about her husband's business connections to Boudou, Boudou stated they were “all lies.”&lt;ref name=infid/&gt; On April 4, 2012, the Justice Department raided an apartment owned by Boudou in Puerto Madero, and found evidence that the home expenses, including rent and cable bills, were paid by Vandenbroele, indicating that he was residing there. The raid, which was ordered by federal judge Daniel Rafecas at the request of Rívolo, established a firm link between Boudou and Vandenbroele.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1462487-hallan-pruebas-que-ligan-a-boudou-con-vandenbroele&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, it was reported that Vandenbroele was under investigation for money laundering in Spain.&lt;ref name="lanacion.com.ar"&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1487630-piden-al-gobierno-conocer-los-movimientos-financieros-de-vandenbroele-en-espana&lt;/ref&gt; On May 12, it was reported that phone service at the Puerto Madero apartment was in Vandenbroele's name. On May 13, ''La Nación'' confirmed that Vandenbroele was living in the apartment. Boudou, however, denied knowing him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1473123-se-define-hoy-la-situacion-del-fiscal-que-investiga-a-boudou-en-el-caso-ciccone&lt;/ref&gt; On May 14, Federal prosecutor Jorge Di Lello called for Boudou, José María Núñez Carmona, Vandenbroele, and Boudou's domestic partner, Agustina Kämpfer, to be investigated for embezzlement, in addition to 10 companies, including The Old Fund.&lt;ref name=ilic/&gt;

A June 3, 2012, report in ''La Nación'' outlined details of a Ciccone Calcográfica contract to print money for the national mint, and suggested that money laundering was involved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1478743-el-banco-central-definio-como-seria-el-acuerdo-con-vandenbroele&lt;/ref&gt; A June 14 article in the same newspaper noted that Alejandro Vandenbroele was “the only face” of The Old Fund and that the origin of its assets was a mystery.&lt;ref name=desp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1482218-ponen-en-duda-el-valor-de-un-contrato&lt;/ref&gt; On June 25, La Nación reported that the price charged by Calcográfica Ciccone to print money was higher than prices offered by other companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1484995-fuerte-aumento-en-el-costo-de-los-billetes-que-hace-la-nueva-ciccone&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1484998-el-precio-que-vandenbroele-logro-del-estado-supero-las-ofertas-del-mercado&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, it was reported that a Uruguayan court had begun investigating CVS, and that The Old Fund owned a firm called Dusbel SA, which had been founded by Uruguayan accountant Fernando Castagno Schickendantz, who had then sold it to an Argentinian firm before its acquisition by The Old Fund.&lt;ref name=urug/&gt; On July 4 came a report that Ariel Lijo, the judge who was investigating the Ciccone Case, had asked the government agency Unidad de Información Financiera (UIF) for a document from Spain containing information about Vandenbroele's financial actions.&lt;ref name="lanacion.com.ar"/&gt;

On August 21, ''La Nación'' reported on a “key document” signed on the previous June 13 by Boudou, Vandenbroele, and the apparent “controlling shareholder” of The Old Fund, Guillermo Reinwick, whereby Vandenbroele agreed to act on Reinwick's behalf “to try to salvage the former Ciccone” and thereby protect the firm from government investigation. According to ''La Nación'', Reinwick had signed this agreement under pressure, and had also taken responsibility for the two companies that the newspaper described as being “behind The Old Fund: the Dutch fund Tierras International Investments CV, later replaced by a US firm called LLC, and the Uruguayan firm Dusbel SA.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1501055-nuevas-sociedades-sospechosas-aparecen-detras-de-the-old-fund&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation of CVS was taken over  by the government in August 2012, and was placed under the direct control of the Minister of Economy, Hernán Lorenzino, and the head of the Mint, Katya Daura, both of whom reported to Boudou.&lt;ref name="elpais.com.uy"&gt;http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/caso-ciccone-justicia-argentina-le.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Vandenbroele filed a document before the Criminal Court in which he claimed that Raul Moneta, a banker connected with the Kirchner administration, had financed the entire Ciccone operation. In response, Moneta “opted for public silence.”&lt;ref name=gobr/&gt;

===2013===
''Diario Velez'' reported on January 6, 2013, that officials were tracing the origins of Vandenbroele's money, and that “all roads lead to the tax havens of Panama and the Isles [sic] of Man.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diarioveloz.com/notas/83325-boudou-vandenbroele-ciccone-y-los-paraisos-fiscales&lt;/ref&gt;

Appearing in Commercial Court in April 2013, Vandenbroele accused the government of wanting to destroy the Ciccone printing firm and to take it over unconstitutionally. Vandenbroele complained that the government intervention in the printing business had caused “a severe decline” in its income.&lt;ref name=gobr/&gt;

As of June 1, 2013, Vandenbroele was living in a private neighborhood, Vistalba, and was not paying alimony to Muñoz.&lt;ref name=arch/&gt; In an October 2013 interview, Muñoz described Boudou as “an immoral man and a liar.” According to her, Vandenbroele had always “derided Boudou,” never spoken of him with respect, and invariably viewed him as a man who obtained things illicitly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mdzol.com/nota/493884-laura-munoz-boudou-es-amoral/&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported on October 20, 2013, that a case against “Boudou and others” for illegal enrichment was on the desk of Judge Lijo, and that the “others” included Núñez Carmona, Kampfer, and Vandenbroele, as well as Juan Carlos López, Sandra Viviana Rizzo, Fabián Hugo Carosso, Hugo Nicolás Carosso, and Pable Pellet Lastra.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mdzol.com/nota/495786-boudou-al-horno-despues-del-27/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Cassation ruled on November 1, 2013, that Vandenbroele's alleged role as a front man for Boudou should be investigated, and gave particular weight to Muñoz's testimony. Muñoz told ''Clarin'' she was happy with the ruling, especially given that the Kirchner administration and Boudou in particular had tried to discredit her, calling her “insane” and a “compulsive liar”.&lt;ref name=sepr2&gt;http://seprin.info/2013/11/02/en-uruguay-congelaron-las-cuentas-bancarias-de-vandenbroele/&lt;/ref&gt; Muñoz said that she had been offered money to retract her statement that her ex-husband was a front man for Boudou, and that she was now celebrating the fact that “justice was done with my truths.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1634877-la-ex-esposa-de-alejandro-vandenbroele-me-ofrecieron-dinero-para-que-cambie-mi-version&lt;/ref&gt; She also said that Vandenbroele had threatened to kill her “like a dog” so that she would end up “dead in a ditch,” or to commit her to a mental hospital so that “no one will believe you.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infobae.com/2013/11/04/1521251-laura-munoz-vandenbroele-me-dijo-que-me-iban-encontrar-muerta-como-un-perro&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported on November 2, 2013, that the bank accounts of Dusbel, Vandenbroele's company in Uruguay, had been frozen by Uruguayan Judge Néstor Valetti at the request of prosecutor Juan Gomez.&lt;ref name=sepr2/&gt;

In mid November, Vandenbroele was banned from leaving the country before May 5, 2014.&lt;ref name="elpais.com.uy"/&gt;

===2014===
In early February 2014, Laura Muñoz told ''Radio Mitre'' that she did not regret having stated two years earlier that Vandenbroele was Boudou's front man. She also maintained that he had traveled to [[Chile]] at a time when he was banned from leaving the country. In addition, she accused him of “kidnapping” their daughter and said it was “crazy” that a judge could consider him to be “a responsible parent.” She said that he was surrounded by admirers, stating that “even my mother and many parents of classmates of my daughter, to those who really like this Government, have become fans of Vandenbroele.” She called Vandenbroele “a violent man” and claimed he had beaten his mother.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1661787-laura-munoz-vandenbroele-salio-al-exterior-aunque-lo-tiene-prohibido&lt;/ref&gt;

Boudou reiterated on February 26, 2014, that he did not know or have any contact with Vandenbroele. “I don't know him, I didn't show him anything, I never met him,” he said. He asserted that Vandenbroele was living in his apartment because their mutual acquaintance Fabián Carosso Donatiello had transferred it to him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1667498-amado-boudou-el-video-con-alejandro-vandenbroele-no-existe&lt;/ref&gt;

In late May 2014, Lijo issued summonses in the Ciccone Case, ordering Boudou, Vandenbroele, and others to testify in July, addressing charges that they had engaged in irregularities not only while Boudou was Minister of Economy, but also during his term as Vice President. Also called to testify were Núñez Carmona, former AFIP official Rafael Resnick Brenner, Nicholas Ciccone, and Guillermo Reinwick.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eldia.com.ar/edis/20140530/Ciccone-Boudou-fue-citado-declaracion-indagatoria-20140530084712.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Muñoz said on May 30 that she felt “relief” upon learning that Judge Ariel Lijo had summoned Boudou and Vandenbroele for questioning, because this indicated to her that “they are looking for the truth.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1695939-la-ex-mujer-de-alejandro-vandenbroele-sintio-alivio-al-saber-que-el-juez-ha-tomado-la-decision-correcta&lt;/ref&gt; On June 11, Vandenbroele filed a brief with Lijo asking him to delay the trial. Lijo refused.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1700344-alejandro-vandenbroele-caso-ciccone-declaracion-indagatoria-ariel-lijo&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2014, ''La Nación'' reported that Vandenbroele had traveled to Brazil in 2011 with Guido Forcieri and Núñez Carmona.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1704773-guido-forcieri-nunez-carmona-y-vandenbroele-viajaron-juntos-a-brasil-en-2011&lt;/ref&gt; On June 27, the trial of Boudou, Núñez Carmona, Vandenbroele, and Resnick Brenner before Judge Lijo got underway, and all the defendants asked Lijo to delay the trial, a request he rejected. Lijo also prohibited all the defendants, except for Boudou, from leaving the country. In addition, he ruled that it had been established as a fact that Boudou and Núñez Carmona had bought Ciccone through The Old Fund with the objective of profiting from government printing contracts that Boudou would be able to arrange because of his official position.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1709031-jose-maria-nunez-carmona-alejandro-vandenbroele-apelacion-procesamiento-causa-ciccone&lt;/ref&gt; Muñoz said she felt relief upon hearing Lijo's ruling and that “for two and a half years I've been maintaining a truth that nobody believed...They did everything to make me look crazy. Finally the court agreed with me.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1705432-caso-ciccone-laura-munoz-alejandro-vandenbroele&lt;/ref&gt;

''La Nación'' reported on June 29, 2014, that Federal Judge Ariel Lijo had concluded that Boudou and Vandenbroele knew each other, despite Boudou's frequent and unequivocal claims to the contrary, and that they had a “strong link” and “mutual interests.” Lijo cited a substantial list of established facts demonstrating their relationship. Lijo concluded that “the links between Amado Boudou and Alejandro Vandenbroele are strong and numerous.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1705638-los-indicios-que-unen-a-boudou-con-vandenbroele&lt;/ref&gt;
 
''La Nación'' reported on July 7, 2014, that Vandenbroele had appeared in Commercial Court No. 8 on September 3, 2010, in an effort to help reverse the bankruptcy of Ciccone. After the Ciccone scandal broke, however, the court verified that Vandenbroele had misrepresented information before the Commercial Court in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1707826-vandenbroele-
intento-conseguir-mas-fondos&lt;/ref&gt;

Lijo stated on July 11, 2014, that Vandenbroele had indeed been a front man for Boudou and Núñez Carmona, and tried them all on charges of bribery and irregular negotiations. He noted that Núñez Carmona and Boudou had both become millionaires as a result of their joint activities, while Vandenbroele lost money. As of 2011, Vandenbroele had a negative net worth of $235,324.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On June 11, 2014, he appeared in court, where his indictment was read and he was shown the evidence against him. Vandenbroele told the judge he wanted to answer questions later and expand his statement, and left a letter outlining the main points of his defense.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1700609-vandenbroele-pidio-seguir-la-ruta-del-dinero-y-la-pista-moneta-como-boudou&lt;/ref&gt;

The court ruled in late June 2014 that Boudou and Núñez Carmona had acquired Ciccone Calcográfica while Boudou was Minister of Economy via The Old Fund and Vandenbroele, “with the ultimate goal of contracting with the Federal Government to print money and official documentation.” The court determined that Boudou, using his position as a public official, and Núñez Carmona had arranged with Nicholas and Hector Ciccone and Guillermo Reinwick for a transfer of 70% of Calcográfica Ciccone in exchange for actions arranged by Boudou that would enable the firm to resume operations and obtain government contracts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

''La Nación'' reported on October 2, 2014, that Vandenbroele was under investigation by Valetti, the Uruguayan judge, on suspicion of money-laundering and that Valetti planned to ask for Vandenbroele's extradition so that Vandenbroele could explain the origin of funds that were transferred from Montevideo to Buenos Aires and used to acquire Ciccone. The report in ''La Nación'' further stated that Vandenbroele, as head of the anonymous Uruguayan firm Dusbel, had invested US$2.4 million in The Old Fund.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1732107-un-juez-uruguayo-pide-extraditar-a-alejandro-vandenbroele-el-supuesto-testaferro-de-amado-boudou&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Vandenbroele and Muñoz married in 2006.&lt;ref name=infid/&gt; They have one child together, and she has two children from a previous marriage. In March 2010, he moved out of their home.&lt;ref name=infid/&gt;

'''Alfred Renard''' (21 April 1895 – 20 June 1988) was a Belgian aviation pioneer.

==Biography==

Alfred Renard was born in [[Anderlecht]] on 21 April 1895. As a youngster and inspired by the kites he saw his father make,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;André Hauet, ''Les avions Renard'', Éditions A.E.L.R., Bruxelles, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; he installed electricity and a telephone system at an uncle's farm.

In 1912, his inspiration was kindled by a prize of 10.000 [[franc]]s, offered by French car builder [[Peugeot]] to the first cyclist to make two aircraft flights of 10 meters each, relying solely on his or her own muscular power. Alfred conceived and, with help from his brother Georges, made his own device for the test: a bicycle augmented with a propeller and a fabric-covered wing, which unfolded by means of a lever when the device reached airspeed. The machine failed, however.

During [[World War I]] the brothers worked in the family home at a pedal-powered [[lathe]], producing pieces for a Brussels workshop; they also built engines. They ventured into building a five-meter-long [[blimp]] that they fill with compressed air.

The war forced Alfred Renard to suspend his studies at the [[Université libre de Bruxelles|Free University of Brussels]] and the Department of Applied Sciences, but in 1920 he earned an engineering degree in civil construction, plus a ''license'' in aeronautics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

After study came the tour of soldier's duty - especially important in this small country that had suffered heavily under the war, and was taking part in the occupation of Western Germany. Renard served as a cartographer, designing military aerodromes. During this service he re-acquainted one of his former university teachers, [[Emile Allard]], newly appointed chief of the military aviation technical service TSA, and creator of a Belgian Aeronautical Laboratory. After several visits to [[Gustave Eiffel]] in Paris, the two of them would build a [[wind tunnel]] at [[Sint-Genesius-Rode]]. They also designed an all-metal monoplane, built at [[Zeebrugge]] by company ZACCO (best known under the French acronym [[ACAZ]]) as the [[ACAZ T-2]]. It failed to meet commercial success.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Through the same Emile Allard, Renard got in touch with [[Jean Stampe]] and his cherished dream of operating his own flying school with his self-designed and self-built solid trainer aircraft. The venture was completed with [[Maurice Vertongen]], its designs marked RSV for Renard-Stampe-Vertongen. The company statute left Renard free to keep his position as chief engineer at the Defense Ministry, meanwhile designing RSV-aircraft built and sold by [[Stampe et Vertongen]]

== Renard Constructions Aéronautiques ==

In 1925 Alfred Renard creates his own company as '''Société anonyme des avions et moteurs Renard''' in [[Brussels]]. The main activity was the design and production of aircraft engines of 100, 120 and 240&amp;nbsp;hp. Some of them served Belgian military aviation, some were sold in Poland and in the USA. Also, a Renard 240&amp;nbsp;hp engine powered the second version of Belgium's first helicopter, built by and named after Russian engineer [[Nicolas Florine]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Boulet, ''Histoire de l'hélicoptère : racontée par ses pionniers, 1907-1956'', Éd. France-Empire, Paris, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1928, his brother Georges Renard joined the company which was then renamed '''Renard Constructions Aéronautiques'''. The brothers shifted away from engine design: their [[Renard R-31|R-31]] and [[Renard R-36|R-36]] were powered by engines from abroad.

== World War II and aftermath ==

Foreseeing the German invasion in 1940, Alfred Renard planned to move his assets to France, but not in time. During [[World War II]]  he disappeared from public view, to re-emerge in 1945 as a technical advisor with the Belgian State Railways [[NMBS]]/[[SNCB]], making a study of [[light alloy]] [[railcar]]s. In 1947 he rejoins [[Jean Stampe]], having always remained on good terms with him, to become a manager at a new company [[Stampe &amp; Renard]] till that company's dissolution in January 1970. On top of producing the [[Stampe SV.4]] trainer, he works at propeller engineering, at the development of the [[Stampe &amp; Renard SR-7]] and the [[Stampe &amp; Renard SR-45]] project.

Run over by a motorcar, Alfred Renard died on 20 June 1988.&lt;ref&gt;AELR / Fonds national Alfred Renard, Bruxelles&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angelo Motta''' (8 September 1890 – 26 December 1957) was an Italian entrepreneur, founder of the food company Motta. He is associated with the commercial production of the sweet yeast bread [[panettone]].
Motta later served as a finance minister in the cabinets of [[Alcide De Gasperi]] during the 1950s.

==Biography==
Motta was a Milanese pastry chef , before leaving for military service during [[The Great War]]. After the war, in 1919 he opened his first bakery starting production of panettone, sweet typical Milanese, first in the form of a handmade version and later expanding his production to make panettone at an industrial plant. Motta and his rival panettone maker [[Gioacchino Alemagna]] are credited with the industrialisation of panettone from its Milanese origins to a staple of the Italian Christmas. Production had expanded  considerably by 1930 and a new large factory was required on the outskirts of town to replace the four small bakeries that Motta was using. In 1935 ''l’illustrazione italiana'' reported that the new factory had a conveyor belt measuring thirty metres and large industrial ovens to keep up with production.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA&gt;Stanisloa Porizo, Il panettone. Storia, leggende, segreti e fortune di un protagonista del Natale,  Datanova, (2007), {{ISBN|9788895092317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motta’s edge in the production of panettone was to create a distinctive high dome shape to his bread that replaced the older style of flatter panettone as the standard. His startling success saw his company expand considerably during the inter war years with Motta foods introducing new breads including a celebratory Easter bread known as a [[Colomba Pasquale|Colomba di Pasqua]], a dove shaped yeast bread that uses panettone yeast but contains less fruit.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In many companies, panettone became the de rigueur holiday gift to give to staff. Top artists were commissioned by Motta to immortalize his bread in advertisements. Prices were slashed to attract yet more consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Richardson, Panettone: the Quintessential Italian Cake and not only at Christmas!, Winter 2009 The Magazine of the British-Italian Society&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that panettone is now sold in seventy five countries.

After the war Motta's also manufactured ice cream including the famous brands ''Mottarello'' and ''Coppa del Nonno'' (Grandfather's cup). Motta's continued as an independent company until 1970 when it became state controlled.
 
The Motta and Alemagna brands are now owned by Bauli &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bauli.it/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813022602/http://www.bauli.it/en/ |archivedate=2012-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an Italian bakery company based in [[Verona]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foodbev.com/news/bauli-acquires-motta-and-alemagna-from-nestle&lt;/ref&gt; having previously passed through the hands of [[Nestlé]] for a period in the late 1990s.

He died in December 1957.

==Awards==

In 1939 Angelo Motta was awarded Knight of the Equestrian [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]] a prestigious catholic chivalric order.

Motta was also a Grand Officer of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]].

'''Roberto''' "'''Bob'''" '''Bissonnette''' (27 April 1981 – 3 September 2016) was a Canadian ice hockey player, as well as a singer known for his sports-themed songs and a co-owner of the [[Québec Capitales]] professional baseball team.

==Sports career==
Bissonnette was born in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]] in 1981. He was picked for the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] (QMJHL) in [[Gatineau Olympiques|Hull Olympiques]] becoming team captain.

The '''Broadway Theater District''' in [[Downtown Los Angeles]] is the first and largest historic theater district listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=Conservancy&gt;{{cite web|author=Sandra A.B. Levis|title=Broadway Historic Theater District: A walking tour sponsored by the Los Angeles Conservancy|publisher=Los Angeles Conservancy|url=http://dbase1.lapl.org/webpics/calindex/documents/01/165986.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With twelve [[movie palace]]s located along a six-block stretch of [[Broadway (Los Angeles)|Broadway]], it is the only large concentration of movie palaces left in the United States.

==Highest concentration of movie palaces in the world==
Stretching for six blocks from Third to Ninth Streets along South Broadway in [[Downtown Los Angeles]], the district includes 12 movie theaters built between 1910 and 1931. By 1931, the district had the highest concentration of cinemas in the world, with [[seating capacity]] for more than 15,000 patrons. Broadway was the hub of L.A.'s entertainment scene – a place where "screen goddesses and guys in fedoras rubbed elbows with Army nurses and aircraft pioneers."&lt;ref name=Glory/&gt;  In 2006, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"There was a time, long ago, when the streets of downtown Los Angeles were awash in neon—thanks to a confluence of movie theaters the world had never seen before.  Dozens of theaters screened Hollywood's latest fare, played host to star-studded premieres and were filled nightly with thousands of moviegoers.  In those days, before World War II, downtown L.A. was the movie capital of the world."&lt;ref name=Fading&gt;{{cite news|author=Cara Mia DiMassa|title=Movie Tradition Fading to Black; Seventy years after its neon heyday, downtown Los Angeles is struggling to keep its last cinematic venue afloat|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=February 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Columnist [[Jack Smith (columnist)|Jack Smith]] called it "the only large concentration of vintage movie theaters left in America."&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite news|author=Jack Smith|title=Los Angeles Theater: Flashback to yesteryear ... and a Latino renaissance on Broadway|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=September 30, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Smith recalled growing up a mile from Broadway and spending his Saturdays in the theaters:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I remember walking into those opulent interiors, surrounded by the glory of the Renaissance, or the age of Baroque, and spending two or three hours in the dream world of the movies.  When I came out again the sky blazed; the heat bounced off the sidewalk, traffic sounds filled the street, I was back in the hard reality of the Depression.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because Broadway has been used as a [[filming location]] for decades, many of these theatre marquees can be seen in classic Hollywood films, including ''[[Safety Last!]]'' (1923), ''[[D.O.A. (1950 film)|D.O.A.]]'' (1950), ''[[The Omega Man]]'' (1971), ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982), and ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'' (2011).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042369/locations?ref_=tttrv_ql_dt_6 Filming locations for "D.O.A." (1950) at IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067525/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt Filming locations for "The Omega Man" (1971) at IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revitalization by Spanish-language cinema==
In the years after [[World War II]], the district began to decline, as first-run movie-goers shifted to the movie palaces in Hollywood, in Westwood Village, and later to suburban multiplexes.  After World War II, as Anglo moviegoers moved to the suburbs, many of the Broadway movie palaces became venues for Spanish-language movies and variety shows.  In 1988, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that, without the Hispanic community, "Broadway would be dead."&lt;ref name=Grand/&gt;  Jack Smith wrote that Broadway had been "rescued and revitalized" by "the Latino renaissance."&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

==Preservation and renovation efforts==
The district has been the subject of preservation and restoration efforts since the 1980s.  In 1987, the [[Los Angeles Conservancy]] started a program called "Last Remaining Seats" in which the old movie palaces were opened each summer to show classic Hollywood movies.&lt;ref name=Glory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Encore/&gt;  In 1994, the Conservancy's associate director, Gregg Davidson, noted: "When we started this, the naysayers said no one will go downtown to an old theater to see an old movie in the middle of the summer, but we get a number of people who have never seen a movie in a theater with a balcony.  The older people (go) for nostalgia.  And the movie people—seeing a classic film on a big screen is a different experience."&lt;ref name=Encore&gt;{{cite news|author=Robert Levine|title=Silent Screens: Encore for Carter, Old Movie District|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=June 12, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After attending a Conservancy screening, one writer noted: "The other night I went to the movies and was transported to a world of powdered wigs and [[hoop skirt]]s, a [[rococo]] fantasy of gilded [[cherub]]s and [[crystal chandelier]]s.  And then the film started."&lt;ref name=Glory/&gt;

Despite preservation efforts, many of the theaters have been converted to other uses, including flea markets and churches.  The Broadway movie palaces fell victim to a number of circumstances, including changing demographics and tastes, a downtown location that was perceived as dangerous at night, and high maintenance costs for aging facilities.  With the closure of the [[State Theatre (Los Angeles)|State Theater]] in 1998, the Orpheum and the Palace were the only two still screening films.&lt;ref name=Darkness/&gt;

In 2006, the ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote: "Of all of L.A.'s many hidden gems, maybe none is as sparkling nor as hidden as the Broadway theater district downtown."&lt;ref name=Glory&gt;{{cite news|author=Dan Turner|title=Our So-Cal Life: Faded glory on Broadway|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=June 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bemoaning the possible loss of such gems, the same writer noted: "L.A. gave birth to the movies.  To lose the astonishing nurseries where the medium grew up would be tragic."&lt;ref name=Glory/&gt;

In 2008, the City of Los Angeles launched a $40-million campaign to revitalize the Broadway district, known as the "[[Bringing Back Broadway]]" campaign.  Some Latino merchants in the district expressed concern that the campaign was an effort to spread the largely Anglo gentrification taking hold in other parts of downtown to an area that has become the city's leading Latino shopping district.&lt;ref name=facelift&gt;{{cite news|author=Cara DiMassa|title=L.A. plans Broadway face-lift|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=January 28, 2008|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-broadway28jan28,1,1421189.story?ctrack=5&amp;cset=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A worker at one of the district's bridal shops noted, "On one side, I like the idea.  The only thing is that I don't think they want our types of businesses."&lt;ref name=facelift/&gt;

==Surviving theaters on Broadway==
The twelve theaters in the Broadway District from north to south are:
[[File:Milliondollartheater.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Million Dollar Theater]]
*'''[[Million Dollar Theater]]''' – Movie palace – Located at 307 S. Broadway, the Million Dollar Theater was built by [[Sid Grauman]] and opened in 1918.

After more than 30 years as one of the city's most prestigious first-run movie palaces, the Million Dollar Theater presented Spanish-language films and [[variety show]]s from 1950 until the late 1980s. The theater had a seating capacity of 2,345 when it opened in 1918.&lt;ref name=Conservancy/&gt; In 1925, ''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' played for six months at the Million Dollar Theater.&lt;ref name=Encore/&gt;

*'''Roxie Theatre''' – Movie palace – Located at 518 S. Broadway, the Roxie was built in 1932—the last of the movie palaces built on Broadway. The Roxie had a seating capacity of 1,600 when it opened and was noted for its [[Art Deco]] or Zigzag Moderne style, including its stepped roofline, angular grillwork, chevron ornament, and terrazzo sunburst in the sidewalk. The theater's sleek Streamline Moderne ticket booth was removed when the theater was converted to retail use.&lt;ref name=Conservancy/&gt;
*'''Cameo Theater''' – [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|Nickelodeon]] – Located at 528 S. Broadway, the Cameo opened in 1910 with a seating capacity of 775. Designed by [[Alfred Rosenheim]] in a Renaissance Revival style, the Cameo was originally known as Clune's Broadway.

*'''Arcade Theater''' – English-music-hall-style theater – Located at 534 S. Broadway, the Arcade opened in 1910 as a vaudeville house that was part of the Pantages vaudeville circuit.

Broadway, the Los Angeles opened in 1931 for the premiere of [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[City Lights]]''.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; It had a seating capacity just short of 2,000. The theater was designed by [[S. Charles Lee]] and S. Tilden Norton in the [[French Baroque]] style, and was modeled on San Francisco's Fox Theater. The Los Angeles included the latest technological features when it opened, including an electric monitor of available seats, blue neon floor lights, a restaurant, a children's playroom,  soundproof crying rooms, smoking room with built-in cigarette lighters, a walnut-paneled lounge with a secondary screen on which a periscope-like system of prisms relayed the film.&lt;ref name=Conservancy/&gt; The ladies' powder room was lined with mirrors and vanities, and the toilet stalls were each done in a different kind of marble and each toilet bowl of a different pastel shade.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; In 1988, the ''Los Angeles Times'' called it "a movie house for the gods, even in its present dusty state".&lt;ref name=Grand&gt;{{cite news|author= Dan Sullivan|title=L.A.'s Grand Old Broadway Theaters|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=August 21, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columnist [[Jack Smith (columnist)|Jack Smith]] wrote that the Los Angeles Theater was "palatial beyond the dreams of a prince" with a lobby that suggested "nothing less than the glory of Versailles.".&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; [[Aerosmith]]'s video for "[[Jaded (Aerosmith song)|Jaded]]" was filmed throughout the theater. It is owned by the Broadway Theatre Group, and continues to be used as a performing arts venue.&lt;ref name="btgla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btgla.com/about|title=About the Broadway Theatre Group|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current capacity: 1,931.

Albert Lansburgh]] based on a Florentine early Renaissance palazzo. The brick facade includes multi-colored terra-cotta swags and four panels depicting the muses of vaudeville sculpted by [[Domingo Mora]].&lt;ref name=Conservancy/&gt; It is also owned by the Broadway Theatre Group.&lt;ref name="btgla"/&gt; Current capacity: 1,068.

[[Judy Garland]] performed at the theater as part of the Gumm Sisters in 1929. Designed by [[Weeks and Day|Charles Weeks and William Day]], the 12-story Loew's State is said to be the largest brick-clad structure in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The theater is also noted for the seated [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]/[[Billiken]] figure, as a good luck charm, located in a niche above the [[proscenium arch]].&lt;ref name=Conservancy/&gt; The exterior has an elaborate "silver platter" [[Repoussé and chasing|chased ornamentation]] above the ground story.&lt;ref name="Samudio"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Samudio |first1=Jeffrey |authorlink1= |last2=Lee |first2=Portia |title=Images of America: Los Angeles, California |trans-title=|url= |type=trade paperback |year=2001 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=0-7385-0812-8 |pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Metropolitan Theaters stopped showing movies at the State and leased the space to the Universal Church.&lt;ref name=Darkness&gt;{{cite news|author=John Regardie|title=State of Darkness: Another Movie Palace Quits Screening Films|publisher=Los Angeles Downtown News|date=November 2, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015 the State is owned by the Broadway Theatre Group and is leased by the Cathedral of Faith for use as a church.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statetheatre.la&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[United Artists Theater]]''' (now '''The Theatre at Ace Hotel''') – Movie palace – Located at 933 S. Broadway, the United Artists opened in 1927 with a seating capacity of 2,214. It was the showcase for movies from the [[United Artists]] group created in 1919 by [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Mary Pickford]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[D.W. Griffith]]. The theater was designed by [[C. Howard Crane]], with [[Walker &amp; Eisen]], in a Gothic style inspired by a church in [[Segovia, Spain]]. The columns feature [[terra cotta]] capitals carved with film and theater themed grotesques. The interior includes a series of frescoes and murals by the firm of [[Anthony Heinsbergen]].&lt;ref name=Conservancy/&gt; In 1990, the United Artists Theater was restored by [[Gene Scott]]'s L.A. University Church; Scott called on his television flock to come to Los Angeles to help with the restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steven Wolf|title=Televangelist Scott Sets Up Shop On Broadway: United Artists Renovation Complete|publisher=Downtown News|date=April 30, 1990|url=http://dbase1.lapl.org/webpics/calindex/documents/03/167132.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's famous "Jesus Saves" sign was placed on the back side of the building to avoid interfering with the original facade. In 2013 the upper floors of the building were renovated into a boutique hotel, the Ace Los Angeles; the auditorium has been returned to use as a concert venue and theater.

'''Business activity monitoring''' ('''BAM''') is [[software]] that aids in monitoring of business activities, key performance indicators, business / operational exceptions and business risks, as those activities are implemented in [[computer system]]s.

The term was originally coined by analysts at [[Gartner|Gartner, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/resources/105500/105562/105562.pdf Gartner overview of BAM, Definition (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the aggregation, analysis, and presentation of real-time information about activities inside organizations and involving customers and partners. A business activity can either be a [[business process]] that is orchestrated by [[business process management]] (BPM) software, or a business process that is a series of activities spanning multiple systems and applications. BAM is an enterprise solution primarily intended to provide a real-time summary of business activities to operations managers and upper management.

==Goals and benefits==
The goals of business activity monitoring is to provide real time information about the status and results of various operations, processes, and transactions. The main benefits of BAM are to enable an enterprise to make better informed [[business decision]]s, quickly address problem areas, and re-position organizations to take full advantage of emerging opportunities.

==Key features==
One of the most visible features of BAM solutions is the presentation of information on [[Dashboard (management information systems)|dashboards]] containing the [[key performance indicator]]s (KPIs) used to provide assurance and visibility of activity and performance. This information is used by technical and business operations to provide visibility, measurement, and assurance of key business activities. It is also exploited by [[event correlation]] to detect and warn of impending problems.

Although BAM systems usually use a computer dashboard display to present data, BAM is distinct from the dashboards used by [[business intelligence]] (BI) insofar as events are processed in real-time or near real-time and pushed to the dashboard in BAM systems, whereas BI dashboards refresh at predetermined intervals by polling or querying databases. Depending on the refresh interval selected, BAM and BI dashboards can be similar or vary considerably.

Some BAM solutions additionally provide trouble notification functions, which allows them to interact automatically with the [[issue tracking system]]. For example, whole groups of people can be sent e-mails, voice or text messages, according to the nature of the problem. Automated [[problem solving]], where feasible, can correct and restart failed processes.

==Deployment effort==
In nearly all BAM deployments extensive tailoring to specific enterprises is required. Many BAM solutions seek to reduce extensive customization and may offer templates that are written to solve common problems in specific sectors, for example banking, manufacturing, and stockbroking. Due to the high degree of system integration required for initial deployment, many enterprises use experts that specialize in BAM to implement solutions.

BAM is now considered{{who|date=January 2016}} a critical component of [[Operational Intelligence]] (OI) solutions to deliver visibility into business operations. Multiple sources of data can be combined from different organizational silos to provide a common operating picture that uses current information. Wherever real-time insight has the greatest value, OI solutions can be applied to deliver the needed information.

==Processing events==
All BAM solutions process events. While most of the first BAM solutions were closely linked to BPM solutions and therefore processed events emitted as the process was being orchestrated, this had the disadvantage of requiring enterprises to invest in BPM before being able to acquire and use BAM. The newer generation of BAM solutions are based on [[complex event processing]] (CEP) technology, and can process high volumes of underlying technical events to derive higher level business events, therefore reducing the dependency on BPM, and providing BAM to a wider audience of customers.

==Examples==
A bank might be interested in minimizing the amount of money it borrows overnight from a central bank. Interbank transfers must be communicated and arranged through automation by a set time each business day. The failure of any vital communication could cost the bank large sums in interest charged by the central bank. A BAM solution would be programmed to become aware of each message and await confirmation. Failure to receive confirmation within a reasonable amount of time would be grounds for the BAM solution to raise an alarm that would set in motion manual intervention to investigate the cause of the delay and to push the problem toward resolution before it becomes costly.

Another example involves a mobile telecommunications company interested in detecting a situation whereby new customers are not set up promptly and correctly on their network and within the various CRM and billing solutions. Low-level technical events such as messages passing from one application to another over a middleware system, or transactions detected within a database logfile, are processed by a CEP engine. All events relating to an individual customer are correlated in order to detect an anomalous situation whereby an individual customer has not been promptly or correctly provisioned, or set up. An alert can be generated to notify technical operations or to notify business operations, and the failed provisioning step may be restarted automatically.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1323">The '''choice of techniques''' is an area of economics in which the question of the appropriate [[Capital intensity|capital]] or [[Labour intensity|labour-intensity]] of the method of production of goods is discussed. In the context of traditional development economics it was often recognised ([[Frances Stewart (economist)|Stewart]]  (1972) for example) that this choice was central to development strategies and that such choices were inter-twined with decisions over the type of goods to be produced and the scale of operation of an industry.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Amartya. (1968). ''Choice of techniques: an aspect of the theory of planned economic development''. Oxford: Blackwell. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wuyts, M. E. (1974).

In a [[dairy]], the '''creamery''' is the location of cream processing. [[Cream]] is separated from whole milk; [[pasteurization]] is done to the skimmed milk and cream separately. Whole [[milk]] for sale has had some cream returned to the skimmed milk.

The creamery is the source of [[butter]] from a dairy. Cream is an [[emulsion]] of fat-in-water; the process of [[churning (butter)|churning]] causes a [[phase inversion]] to butter which is an emulsion of water-in-fat. Excess liquid as [[buttermilk]] is drained off in the process. Modern creameries are automatically controlled industries, but the traditional creamery needed skilled workers. Traditional tools included the [[butter churn]] and [[Scotch hands]].

The term "creamery" is sometimes used in [[retail]] trade as a place to buy milk products such as [[yogurt]] and [[ice cream]]. Under the banner of a creamery one might find a store also stocking [[pie]]s and [[cake]]s or even a [[coffeehouse]] with [[confectionery]].

==History==
===Early history===
In 1845, [[William Welch Deloitte]] opened an office in London. Deloitte was the first person to be appointed an independent auditor of a public company, namely the [[Great Western Railway]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/about-deloitte.html| title=About Deloitte| work=Deloitte| accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to open an office in New York in 1880.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

In 1890, Deloitte opened a branch office on Wall Street headed by Edward Adams and P.D. Griffiths as branch managers. That was Deloitte's first overseas venture. Other branches were soon opened in [[Chicago]] and [[Buenos Aires]]. in 1898 P.D. Griffiths returned from New York and became a partner in the London office.&lt;ref name="Book1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Deloitte &amp; Co.|date=1959|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, [[Charles Waldo Haskins]] and [[Elijah Watt Sells]] formed Haskins &amp; Sells in New York.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; It was later described as "the first major auditing firm to be established in the country by American rather than British accountants".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/membership-in-hall/elijah-watt-sells Elijah Watt Sells], "The Accounting Hall of Fame", [[Fisher College of Business]]. Retrieved 2013-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, [[George Touche]] established an office in London and then, in 1900, joined John Ballantine Niven in establishing the firm of Touche Niven in the Johnston Building at 30 [[Broad Street (Manhattan)|Broad Street]] in New York.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

On 1 March 1933, Colonel Arthur Hazelton Carter, President of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants and managing partner of Haskins &amp; Sells, testified before the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Banking and Currency]]. Carter helped convince [[United States Congress|Congress]] that independent audits should be mandatory for [[Public company|public companies]].&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

[[File:William welch deloitte small.jpg|thumb|upright|William Welch Deloitte, founder of Deloitte]]
In 1947, [[Detroit]] accountant George Bailey, then president of the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]], launched his own organization. The new entity enjoyed such a positive start that in less than a year, the partners merged with Touche Niven and A. R. Smart to form Touche, Niven, Bailey &amp; Smart.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; Headed by Bailey, the organization grew rapidly, in part by creating a dedicated [[management consulting]] function. It also forged closer links with organizations established by the co-founder of Touche Niven, George Touche: the Canadian organization Ross and the British organization George A. Touche.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; In 1960, the firm was renamed Touche, Ross, Bailey &amp; Smart, becoming Touche Ross in 1969.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; In 1968 [[Nobuzo Tohmatsu]] formed Tohmatsu Aoki &amp; Co, a firm based in Japan that was to become part of the Touche Ross network in 1975.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; In 1972 Robert Trueblood, Chairman of Touche Ross, led the committee responsible for recommending the establishment of the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]].&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

In 1952, Deloitte's firm (by then known as Deloitte, Plender, Griffiths &amp; Co.) merged with Haskins &amp; Sells to form Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Simplified Family Tree for the Firm of Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells|url=http://www.icaew.com/-/media/corporate/files/library/subjects/accounting-history/family-trees/family-tree-deloitte-haskins-sells.ashx?la=en|website=Icaew.com|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells merged with Touche Ross in the USA to form Deloitte &amp; Touche. The merged firm was led jointly by J. Michael Cook and Edward A. Kangas. Led by the UK partnership, a smaller number of Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells member firms rejected the merger with Touche Ross and shortly thereafter merged with Coopers &amp; Lybrand to form Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte (later to merge with Price Waterhouse to become [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC]]).&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/05/business/deloitte-touche-merger-done.html Deloitte Touche merger done] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Some member firms of Touche Ross also rejected the merger with Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells and merged with other firms.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; In UK, Touche Ross merged with Spicer &amp; Oppenheim in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spicer &amp; Oppenheim|url=https://www.icaew.com/en/library/historical-resources/guide-to-historical-resources/firm-histories/whats-in-a-name/spicer-and-oppenheim|website=ICAEW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===
At the time of the US-led mergers to form Deloitte &amp; Touche, the name of the international firm was a problem, because there was no worldwide exclusive access to the names "Deloitte" or "Touche Ross" – key member firms such as Deloitte in the UK and Touche Ross in Australia had not joined the merger. The name DRT International was therefore chosen, referring to Deloitte, Ross and Tohmatsu. In 1993, the international firm was renamed Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

[[File:DeloitteOfficeChicago.jpg|thumb|left|Deloitte Office Building in Downtown Chicago]]
In 1995, the partners of Deloitte &amp; Touche decided to create Deloitte &amp; Touche Consulting Group (now known as Deloitte Consulting).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesley.edu/Activities/homepage/consultingclub/wetfeet%20-%20deloitte_consulting.pdf|title=Deloitte Consulting, Page 6|website=Wellesley.edu|accessdate=10 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409002538/http://www.wellesley.edu/Activities/homepage/consultingclub/wetfeet%20-%20deloitte_consulting.pdf|archive-date=9 April 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Deloitte acquired Eclipse to add Internet design-based solutions to its consulting capabilities. Eclipse was later separated into Deloitte Online and Deloitte Digital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/91567/deloitte_buys_eclipse/ Deloitte buys Eclipse], ARN, 16 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Arthur Andersen]]'s UK practice, the firm's largest practice outside the US, agreed to merge with Deloitte's UK practice. Andersen's practices in Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Mexico, Brazil and Canada also agreed to merge with Deloitte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/11/business/enron-s-many-strands-accountants-british-unit-andersen-defecting-deloitte.html?scp=14&amp;sq=arthur%20andersen%20deloitte&amp;st=Search |title=ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE ACCOUNTANTS; British Unit Of Andersen Is Defecting to Deloitte |date=11 April 2002 |accessdate=2010-02-24 |author=Suzanne Kapner |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/business/international-business-canadian-unit-to-join-deloitte.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Canadian Unit to Join Deloitte |date=13 April 2002 |work=New York Times |accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spinoff of Deloitte France's consulting division led to the creation of [[Ineum Consulting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oracle.com/profit/industry/071408_ineum_.html Ineum Consulting], Oracle.com, August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Deloitte acquired Beijing Pan-China CPA to become the largest accountancy firm in China. Just prior to this acquisition Deloitte China had about 3,200 employees.

==Name and branding==
[[File:DeloitteNewSmall.png|thumb|right|Deloitte logo (Short)]]
While in 1989, in most countries, Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells merged with Touche Ross forming Deloitte &amp; Touche, in the United Kingdom the local firm of Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells merged instead with Coopers &amp; Lybrand (later renamed PwC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.com/pl/eng/about/main/history.html|title=PWC: History and milestones|website=Pwc.com|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the full name of the UK private company is '''Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited''', in 1989 it initially branded itself '''DTT International'''. In 2003, the rebranding campaign was commissioned by [[William G. Parrett]], the then-CEO of DTT, and led by Jerry Leamon, the global Clients and Markets leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2200392/ernst-young-launches-rebrand |title=Ernst &amp; Young launches rebrand plan |work=Accountancy Age |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the company website, Deloitte now refers to the brand under which independent firms throughout the world collaborate to provide audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk management, and tax services to selected clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/about-deloitte.html |title=virat Deloitte |work=Deloitte |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Deloitte adopted its new "Always One Step Ahead" (AOSA) brand positioning platform to support the existing Deloitte vision: "To be the Standard of Excellence". AOSA represents the global organization's value proposition and is never used as a tagline. The recent launch of the Green Dot ad campaign also aligns with Deloitte's brand strategy and positioning framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalblogs.deloitte.com/deloitteperspectives/2010/11/170000-brand-managers-step-ahead-as-one.html |title=170,000 brand managers step ahead, as one |work=Deloitte Perspectives |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, Deloitte changed its branding and adopted a new logo with Deloitte written in black color instead of earlier blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/deloitte-brand-gets-makeover.html|title=Deloitte’s brand gets a makeover|publisher=Deloitte|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], Deloitte operates under several brand names including A.F.Ferguson &amp;Co., A.F.Ferguson Associates, S.B.Billimoria, C.C.Choksi &amp; Co., P.C.Hansotia, Fraser &amp; Ross and Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells (India).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deloitte and KPMG do not have license to operate in India |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/software/deloitte-kpmg-have-no-licence-to-do-audit-work-in-india/articleshow/3986506.cms |accessdate=29 September 2018 |publisher=Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal structure==
For many years, the organization and its network of member firms were legally organized as a [[Swiss Verein]] (the equivalent to an unincorporated association). As of 31 July 2010, members of the Verein became part of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (DTTL), a UK private company, limited by guarantee. Each member firm in its global network remains a separate and independent legal entity, subject to the laws and [[professional regulation]]s of the particular country or countries in which it operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/20/deloitte-touche-tohmatsu-legal-registration-london |title=Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu quits Swiss system to make UK its new legal home |author=Andrew Clark |work=The Guardian |date=20 September 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deloitte is registered under the [[North American Industry Classification System|NAIC]] code of 55112.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.zoominfo.com/c/Deloitte-LLP/46091164|title = Deloitte LLP|date = |access-date = 14 February 2016|website = Zoominfo|publisher = Zoominfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GE Building by David Shankbone.JPG|upright|thumb|[[30 Rockefeller Plaza]]]]
This structure is similar to other [[professional services networks]] which seek to limit vicarious liability for acts of other members. As separate and legal entities, member firms and DTTL cannot obligate each other. Professional services continue to be provided by member firms only and not DTTL. With this structure, the members should not be liable for the negligence of other independent members. This structure also allows them to be members of the [[International Federation of Accountants|IFAC]] Forum of Firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifac.org/about-ifac/forum-firms/|title=IFAC Forum of Firms|publisher=IFAC|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
Deloitte member firms offer services in the following functions, with country-specific variations on their legal implementation (i.e., all operating within a single company or through separate legal entities operating as subsidiaries of an umbrella legal entity for the country).&lt;ref name="Deloitte"/&gt;

===Audit===
Audit provides the organization's traditional accounting and audit services, as well as internal auditing and IT control assurance. In 2018, it accounted for 24% of worldwide revenue share.&lt;ref name="Deloitte"/&gt;

Investors in [[Guangdong Kelon Electrical Holdings Company Limited]] have claimed that there was a failure to alert them to the company's poor financial position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2006-03/31/content_556998.htm |title=Deloitte faces double trouble in China |work=China Daily |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/542957/kelon-scandal-puts-deloitte-legal-firing-line|title=Kelon scandal puts Deloitte in legal firing line|website=Scmp.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deloitte claims it did a good job on the project. Deloitte's global CEO defended the firm's work on the Kelon matter. The firm was the auditor for thirty months from 2002 to 2004. It qualified its opinion in 2004 as to company sales, returns, and allowances. The firm resigned from the Kelon account after completing the 2004 audit. Deloitte said it resigned from the account because management at the client was not committed to best practices in finance.&lt;ref name="SCMPGOOD"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderlini|first1=Jamil|title=Deloitte defends 'good job' at Kelon|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/545705/deloitte-defends-good-job-kelon|accessdate=13 November 2017|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''An American Sickness'' (2017), Dr. [[Elisabeth Rosenthal]] attributed to Deloitte a key role in counseling the adoption of "strategic billing" as a way of increasing revenues from hospital business. She dates this development from 2005, when Deloitte hired [[Tommy Thompson]], former secretary of health and human services, as chairman of its global healthcare practice.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Rosenthal, ''An American Sickness: How Healthcare Became Big Business and How You Can Take It Back'' (New York: Penguin Press, 2017), pp. 33-35.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Deloitte was ranked No. 1 by revenue in all areas of healthcare consulting&amp;mdash;life sciences, payer, provider, and government health.&lt;ref&gt;"Kennedy Ranks Deloitte as the Top Global Health Care Consulting Practice", High Beam Research newsletter (22 April 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm implemented the [[SAP ERP|SAP]] [[Human resources|HR]] system for the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] (LAUSD) for $95 million and because of faults in the system, some teachers were underpaid, overpaid, or not paid at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2007/09/27/News/Lausd.|title=Teachers.

The firm worked on a statewide case management system which originally had a budget of around $260 million. Almost $500 million had been spent and costs were at one time projected to potentially run as high as $2 billion. No single court became fully operational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2010/04/11/2669739/california-court-officials-judges.html|title=California court officials, judges spar over costly computer system|website=Sacbee.com|accessdate=10 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413051627/http://www.sacbee.com/2010/04/11/2669739/california-court-officials-judges.html|archive-date=13 April 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; California's Judicial Council terminated the project in 2012 citing actual deployment costs associated with the project and California's budget concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/252767/california_scraps_massive_courts_software_project.html |title=California Scraps Massive Courts Software Project |author=Chris Kanaracus |date=28 March 2012 |work=PCWorld |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial advisory===
Financial advisory provides [[corporate finance]] services to clients, including dispute, personal and commercial [[bankruptcy]], forensics, e-discovery, document review, advisory, mergers &amp; acquisitions, capital projects consulting and valuation services. In 2018, financial advisory accounted for 8% of worldwide revenue.&lt;ref name="Deloitte"/&gt;

===Risk advisory===
Risk advisory provides offerings in [[enterprise risk management]], [[information security]] and privacy, data quality and integrity, project risk and cyber risk, and business continuity management and sustainability. In 2018, risk advisory accounted for 12% of worldwide revenue.&lt;ref name="Deloitte"/&gt;

===Tax and legal===
Tax &amp; legal helps clients increase their net asset value, undertake the transfer pricing and international tax activities of multinational companies, minimize their tax liabilities, implement tax computer systems, and provides advisory of tax implications of various business decisions. In 2018, tax &amp; legal accounted for 18% of worldwide revenue.&lt;ref name="Deloitte"/&gt;

In November 2013, the international development charity ActionAid accused Deloitte of advising large businesses on how they could use [[Mauritius]] to avoid potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of tax in some of the poorest countries in Africa. Deloitte responded by saying that, in the absence of the double-taxation treaties, they advise their clients to avail themselves of arrangements that could result in less taxes being paid to the countries in question. Deloitte also said it was wrong to say it is tax avoidance to make use of provisions in double tax treaties and that without such treaties investment might be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/03/deloittes-tax-savings-investments-in-poor-countries|title=Deloitte promotes Mauritius as tax haven to avoid big payouts to poor African nations|first=Jamie|last=Doward|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=9 November 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GovLab===
GovLab is the internal [[think tank]] of Deloitte Consulting LLP's Federal Government consulting practice, focused on innovation and government reform. Created in 2010, GovLab is based in the [[Washington, D.C.]] metro area and typically undertakes 8 or 9 research topics per year, focusing on how future trends, technologies, and business models will affect government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/skollworldforum/2013/06/27/how-the-u-s-government-can-accelerate-the-impact-economy/#4fadc07d6113|title=How The U.S. Government Can Accelerate The Impact Economy|publisher=Forbes|date=27 June 2013|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offices==
Deloitte operates across the world in more than 100 locations including [[Hong Kong]], [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Worldwide locations directory |url=https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/footerlinks/global-office-directory.html?icid=bottom_global-office-directory |website=www2.deloitte.com |publisher=Deloitte global website |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operations in India===
In the late 1990s, Deloitte commenced operations in [[India]], at the same time as another large auditing firm KPMG. In [[India]], ICAI regulations do not permit foreign firms to carry out audits in India.&lt;ref name="et2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Deloitte, KPMG have no licence to do audit work in India |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/software/deloitte-kpmg-have-no-licence-to-do-audit-work-in-india/articleshow/3986506.cms |accessdate=29 September 2018 |publisher=Economic Times |date=16 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence Deloitte carries out audits in India under the name of C.C.Chokshi &amp; Co., an existing auditing firm that it arranged an agreement with 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mistry |first1=Sharad |title=Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu formalises tie-up with CC Chokshi |url=http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/fe/daily/19980319/07855734.html |accessdate=29 September 2018 |publisher=The Indian Express |date=19 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, after India was forced to [[Economic liberalisation in India|liberalise]] under one of the conditions of the [[world bank]] and [[IMF]] sponsored [[bail out]], Deloitte was granted a license to operate in India. It subsequently purchased C.C.Chokshi &amp; Co and now conducts audits in India under the name of this firm.&lt;ref name="ie29sep"&gt;{{cite news |title=SFIO names KPMG arm in Reebok chargesheet |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/sfio-names-kpmg-arm-in-reebok-chargesheet/ |accessdate=29 September 2018 |publisher=The Indian Express |date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation and regulatory action==
===Adelphia Communications===
The [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] announced on 26 April 2005 that Deloitte had agreed to pay $50 million to settle charges relating to Adelphia's 2000 financial statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|dead-url=yes|url=http://www.financegates.com/news/business_news/2005-04-26/deloitte_04262005.html|title=MLS Canada - Canadian Real Estate Property Listing|website=Financegates.com|accessdate=9 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521091731/http://www.financegates.com/news/business_news/2005-04-26/deloitte_04262005.html|archive-date=21 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2005-65.htm|title=SEC Charges Deloitte &amp; Touche for Adelphia Audit|website=Sec.gov|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement was later reported to be as high as $210m or $167.5m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/09/business/09adelphia.html|title=Deloitte and Banks to Pay $455 Million to Adelphia Investors|date=9 December 2006|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2.cfo.com/accounting-tax/2007/08/deloitte-to-pay-167-5m-in-adelphia-case/|title=Deloitte to Pay $167.5M in Adelphia Case -|first=Sarah|last=Johnson|date=6 August 2007|website=2.cfo.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian Bar Association===
In September 2003, Deloitte reported to the [[Canadian Bar Association]] (CBA) that motor vehicle accident insurance claims for bodily injury had been declining since 1999 adjusted for inflation. This contradicted the [[Government of Alberta|government]]'s and [[Insurance industry|industry]]'s argument that [[general damages]] for soft-tissue injury had to be capped at $4,000. Within hours of release, a member of Deloitte was communicating with Insurance Bureau of Canada without the knowledge of CBA (their client) and providing confidential information. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Alberta found Deloitte guilty of unprofessional conduct and fined the firm $40,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=726159b7-ddc8-4d68-a346-be5c0ca0edb4&amp;sponsor=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214024534/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=726159b7-ddc8-4d68-a346-be5c0ca0edb4&amp;sponsor=|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 February 2012|title=Accountant penalized for info leak|date=13 January 2008|publisher=Canada.com|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Livent===
In proceedings arising from the insolvency of the former entertainment company [[Livent]], in April 2014 its special receiver obtained judgment against Deloitte for $84,750,000 in the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]], in relation to Deloitte's failure to exercise its [[duty of care]] with respect to the audit of Livent's financial statements during 1993{{endash}}1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Drew Hasselback|title = Livent auditor Deloitte ordered to pay $84.8-million for failing detect fraud|url = http://business.financialpost.com/2014/04/06/livent-auditor-deloitte-ordered-to-pay-84-8-million-for-failing-detect-fraud/|newspaper = [[Financial Post]]|date = 6 April 2014}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Livent Inc v Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP|link=|year=2014|court=onsc|num=2176|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=2014-04-04|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling was upheld by the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] in January 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Perkel |first= Colin |date=8 January 2016 |title=Court upholds $118-million award against negligent Livent auditor Deloitte |url=http://business.financialpost.com/legal-post/court-upholds-118-million-award-against-negligent-livent-auditor-deloitte |newspaper=Financial Post}}, discussing {{cite CanLII| litigants=Livent Inc v Deloitte &amp; Touche| link=| year=2016| court=onca| num=11| date=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecourt.ca/2016/01/19/livent-v-deloitte-has-the-fat-lady-finally-sung/ |title=''Livent v Deloitte'': Has The Fat Lady Finally Sung? |last1=Joseph |first1=Patricia |date=19 January 2016 |website=thecourt.ca |publisher=[[Osgoode Hall Law School]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125185555/http://www.thecourt.ca/2016/01/19/livent-v-deloitte-has-the-fat-lady-finally-sung/ |archivedate=25 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Buckstein |first=Jeff |date=March 2016 |title=Livent ruling seen as game changer for auditing duties |url=http://thebottomlinenews.ca/articles/820 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306134737/http://thebottomlinenews.ca/articles/820 |archive-date=6 March 2016 |newspaper=The Bottom Line}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in December 2017, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''[[Deloitte &amp; Touche v Livent Inc (Receiver of)]]'' allowed an appeal in part, declaring that liability existed only in respect of Deloitte's negligence in conducting the audit for Livent's 1997 [[fiscal year]], and accordingly reduced the amount of damages awarded to $40,425,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Deloitte &amp; Touche v Livent Inc (Receiver of)|link=Deloitte &amp; Touche v Livent Inc (Receiver of)|year=2017|court=scc|num=63|parallelcite=|date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard Chartered===
In August 2012, Deloitte Financial Advisory Services (DFAS) publicly denied that as the official internal auditors for [[Standard Chartered]], it helped the bank cover up money laundering operations related to Iran which were earning the bank significant profits by "intentionally omitting critical information".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9460445/Standard-Chartered-Deloitte-rejects-US-claims.html Standard Chartered: Deloitte rejects US claims], ''The Telegraph'', 7 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; DFAS paid the state of New York a $10 million settlement, was required not to take on new business for one year from designated New York banks, and was required to implement reforms in order to prevent similar problems in the future. The state regulator stated that there was no evidence DFAS intentionally helped Standard Chartered launder money.&lt;ref name="StandardC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freifeld|first1=Karen|title=Deloitte to pay NY $10 million for misconduct over Standard Chartered|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deloitte-stanchart-ny/deloitte-to-pay-ny-10-million-for-misconduct-over-standard-chartered-idUSBRE95H0VC20130618|accessdate=5 December 2017|publisher=Reuters|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Australian tobacco industry===
In 2011, Deloitte was commissioned by the tobacco industry to compile a report on illicit [[tobacco]]. The [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service]] officials called the report "potentially misleading", and raised concerns about the "reliability and accuracy" of the data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/1118_customs.pdf Australian Customs and Border Protection response to Media Watch] ABC, 10 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; When a second Deloitte report focusing on [[counterfeit]] cigarettes was released, Home Affairs Minister [[Brendan O'Connor (politician)|Brendan O'Connor]] described the second report as "baseless and deceptive" and "bogus".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/national/bogus-smoke-a-2-billion-waste/story-e6frfkvr-1226092757819 Joe Hildebrand] News.com.au, 12 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Public health officials criticised Deloitte's decision to conduct the research, as it added credibility to the tobacco industry's effort to undermine the [[Australian Government]]'s [[plain cigarette packaging]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/2783400.html Professor Simon Chapman] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809041851/http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/2783400.html |date=9 August 2011 }} ABC Online, 6 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/study-burns-claims-plain-packaging-would-cost-tobacco-retailers-460m-20120321-1vkac.html Professor Owen Carter], ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 22 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===E-mail hack===
In September 2017, ''The Guardian'' reported that Deloitte suffered a cyberattack that breached the confidentiality of its clients and 244,000 staff, allowing the attackers to access "usernames, passwords, IP addresses, architectural diagrams for businesses and health information". Reportedly, Deloitte had stored the affected data in Microsoft's [[Microsoft Azure|Azure]] cloud hosting service, without [[two-step verification]]. The attackers were thought to possibly have had access from as early as October 2016.&lt;ref name="guardsep2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/25/deloitte-hit-by-cyber-attack-revealing-clients-secret-emails|title=Deloitte hit by cyber-attack revealing clients’ secret emails|first=Nick|last=Hopkins|date=25 September 2017|accessdate=10 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Krebs]] reported that the breach affected all of Deloitte's email and [[Superuser|administrative user]] accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/source-deloitte-breach-affected-all-company-email-admin-accounts/|title=Source: Deloitte Breach Affected All Company Email, Admin Accounts —  Krebs on Security|website=krebsonsecurity.com|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/security-news-of-the-week-deloitte-sonic-whole-foods-breach/|title=Security News This Week: The Deloitte Breach Was Worse Than We Thought|website=Wired.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later report by ''The Wall Street Journal'' repeated Deloitte's statement that only a few clients were affected. Deloitte said that neither its services nor its clients' businesses were disrupted. Deloitte reportedly first noticed suspicious activity in April 2017. Deloitte said that no sensitive information was compromised and that its investigators were eventually able to read every email obtained by the hackers.&lt;ref name="WallCyber"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rapoport|first1=Michael|title=New York Investigates Deloitte Cyberbreach|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guardian'' reported that client accounts compromised in the breach included, but were not limited to, the [[US Department of Defense]], the [[US Department of Homeland Security]], the [[US State Department]], the [[US Department of Energy]], mortgage companies [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]], the [[National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health (NIH)]], and the [[US Postal Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/10/deloitte-hack-hit-server-containing-emails-from-across-us-government|title=Deloitte hack hit server containing emails from across US government|first=Nick|last=Hopkins|date=10 October 2017|accessdate=10 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issued statements saying they were not affected by the attack and denied that any of their data was compromised.&lt;ref name="BankerCyber"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berry|first1=Kate|title=Fannie, Freddie not affected by Deloitte breach, GSEs say|url=https://www.americanbanker.com/news/fannie-freddie-not-impacted-by-deloitte-breach-gses-say|accessdate=6 December 2017|publisher=American Banker|date=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deloitte said that it immediately contacted legal authorities and six clients. Deloitte also increased security measures on the advice of both internal and external experts.&lt;ref name="ReutersCyber"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sandle|first1=Paul|last2=Finkle|first2=Jim|title=Deloitte hacked, says 'very few' clients affected|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deloitte-cyber/deloitte-hacked-says-very-few-clients-affected-idUSKCN1C01PB|accessdate=6 December 2017|agency=Reuters|issue=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2017, the New York attorney general's office was investigating the hack.&lt;ref name="WallCyber"/&gt;

===Carillion===
Deloitte had acted as internal auditor at construction and services giant [[Carillion]] before it went into liquidation in January 2018. The "excoriating" and "damning" (''[[The Guardian]]'')&lt;ref name="Davies-16May2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Rob|title='Recklessness, hubris and greed' – Carillion slammed by MPs|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/16/recklessness-hubris-and-greed-carillion-slammed-by-mps|accessdate=16 May 2018|work=Guardian|date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; final report of the Parliamentary inquiry into Carillion's collapse was published on 16 May 2018, and criticised Deloitte for its involvement in the company's financial reporting practices:
:"Deloitte were responsible for advising Carillion’s board on risk management and financial controls, failings in the business that proved terminal. Deloitte were either unable to identify effectively to the board the risks associated with their business practices, unwilling to do so, or too readily ignored them."&lt;ref name="Carillion report conclusion"&gt;{{cite book|title=Carillion: Second Joint report from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Work and Pensions Committees of Session 2017–19|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmworpen/769/769.pdf|date=2018|publisher=House of Commons|location=London|page=91|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The select committee chairs (Frank Field and Rachel Reeves) called for a complete overhaul of Britain’s corporate governance regime, accusing the big four accounting firms of operating as a "cosy club".&lt;ref name="Davies-16May2018"/&gt; Deloitte said it was "disappointed" with the committees' conclusions regarding its role as internal auditors, but would take on board any lessons that could be learned from Carillion's collapse.&lt;ref name="Davies-16May2018"/&gt;

'''Downtown Fort Worth''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]], [[United States]]. Most of Fort Worth's tallest buildings and skyscrapers are located downtown.

==Attractions==

===Sundance Square===
Sundance Square began as an effort by [[Sid Bass]] to revitalize downtown Fort Worth in the early 1980s. At the time, downtown Fort Worth was in decline due to [[suburbanization]]. There were many empty gaps between existing skyscrapers and historic buildings that resulted in a pedestrian-unfriendly atmosphere. During many trips to New York City, Sid Bass was fascinated with the urban atmosphere with retail shops, restaurants, office buildings, and museums all working together to form one cohesive experience for the public.  Sid did not want to relocate his business to New York so he brought a little of New York to Fort Worth.  Sid Bass employed Thomas E. Woodward, AIA, of Woodward &amp; Taylor Architects, a Dallas architectural firm to design Sundance Square because of his experience with historic structures and commercial buildings.  Lewis Faulkner, AIA was the Project Architect and Manager for Woodward &amp; Taylor.  Woodward &amp; Taylor placed the Knights of Pythias Building on the U. S. Department of Interior's list of Historic Buildings &amp; Places.

Today, Sundance Square is a pedestrian-friendly cluster of blocks in a portion of downtown Fort Worth that features bars, restaurants, museums, theaters, and retail. Sundance Square also has offices and residential units. Most buildings in Sundance Square are either historic or reconstructed, with two modern skyscrapers designed by Paul Rudolph, architect, and a hotel being exceptions. Sidewalks in Sundance Square are paved with brick.
Lewis Faulkner, AIA

===Parks and plazas===
Sundance Square Plaza is a 55,000 square foot plaza spanning two city blocks within Sundance Square. The plaza features four large Teflon umbrellas, a permanent stage built into the Westbrook building, jetted fountains that illuminate at night, various other fountains, and a pavilion that can be rented. Sundance Square Plaza is bookended by two office buildings: The Westbrook and The Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sundancesquare.com/info/sundancesquareplaza/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420045301/http://www.sundancesquare.com/info/sundancesquareplaza/ |archivedate=2015-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fort Worth Water Gardens - A 4.3-acre (17,000 m2) contemporary park, designed by architect Philip Johnson, that features three unique pools of water offering a calming and cooling oasis for downtown patrons. The gardens were used in the finale of the 1976 sci-fi film ''[[Logan's Run (film)|Logan's Run]]''. (In mid-2004 the Water Gardens had to be closed due to several drownings. It has reopened after preventive measures have been installed.)

"West Seventh" can refer to the gentrifying neighborhood along West 7th Street between the Cultural District and downtown, the [[mixed-use development]] within the district, or the street itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fortworth.com/about-fort-worth/neighborhoods-districts/west-seventh-so7/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903104145/http://www.fortworth.com/about-fort-worth/neighborhoods-districts/west-seventh-so7/ |archivedate=2014-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most gentrification in the West Seventh District has happened south of West 7th Street.

===Near Southside / Medical District===
The Near Southside is an urban neighborhood just south of downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortworthsouth.org/|title=Welcome to Near Southside, Inc. - Near Southside, Inc.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Fort Worth hospitals are in this district, including Baylor All Saints Medical Center, Cook Children's Medical Center, Texas Health Harris Methodist, and JPS Health Network, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortworthsouth.org/community/whats-here/careers-health-sciences-major-employers/health-sciences/|title=Southside Guide - Near Southside, Inc.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pedestrian activity in the Near Southside takes place along Magnolia Avenue.

===Texas Christian University===
[[Texas Christian University]] is Fort Worth's most prominent university. The 325-acre campus is southwest of the Near Southside and downtown. Neighborhoods surrounding the university are predominantly made up of historic single family homes. In recent years, demand for more student housing has resulted in many historic houses being torn down for larger houses designed to accommodate large numbers of students, upsetting many existing residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/community/fort-worth/article3862589.html|title=Residents hope overlay will preserve TCU-area neighborhoods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nightlife options and restaurants geared to students can be found along University Drive and Berry Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fortworth.com/about-fort-worth/neighborhoods-districts/university-tcu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903104223/http://www.fortworth.com/about-fort-worth/neighborhoods-districts/university-tcu/ |archivedate=2014-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panther Island===
The Trinity River Vision Authority, Tarrant Regional Water District, City of Fort Worth, Tarrant County, Streams &amp; Valleys Inc, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are cooperating in an effort to redevelop Panther Island, an 800-acre area north of downtown along the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trinityrivervision.org/aboutus/ProjectPartners|title=Project Partners|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trinityrivervision.org/projects/panther-island|title=Panther Island Central City|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first part of the redevelopment plan calls for infrastructure improvements and flood protection. The second part calls for mixed-use development and sustainable growth along the Trinity River, which would result in a vibrant urban neighborhood.

Panther Island is home to several attractions, including Coyote Urban Drive-In Movie Theater, Panther Island Pavilion, and [[LaGrave Field]] (home of the [[Fort Worth Cats]] and [[Fort Worth Vaqueros FC]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trinityrivervision.org/projects/panther-island/things-to-do-in-panther-island---fort-worth-tx|title=Things to do in Panther Island - Fort Worth TX|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downtown Long Beach''' is the heart of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[California]], [[United States]], and is the location for most of the city's major tourist attractions and municipal services. It is also the location for numerous businesses. There are many hotels and restaurants in the area that serve locals, tourists, and convention visitors.

==Location==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17459">'''Econodynamics''' is an [[empirical science]] that studies emergences, motion and disappearance of [[Value (economics)|value]]—a specific concept that is used for description of the processes of production and distribution of [[wealth]]. Econodynamics is based on the achievements of classical [[political economy]]  and neo-classical [[economics]] and has been using the methods of phenomenological science to investigate evolution of [[economic system]]. Econodynamics has been proposing  methods of analysis and forecasting of [[econimic processes]].  The comprehensive review of the problems of econodynamics is given recently by [[Vladimir Pokrovskii]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Econodynamics. The Theory of Social Production. The 3rd Ed. |last = Pokrovskii|first = Vladimir| publisher = Springer, Dordrecht-Heidelberg-London-New York.|year = 2018|isbn = |location = https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319720739 |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==The Fundamentals==
===Concept of value===
Economic events are considered as processes of creation, motion and distribution of [[value (economics)|value]] that is understood as [[exchange value]] without any factor interpretation. The factor theory of the exchange value is based on the Smith-Marx’s  [[labour theory of value]]. according to which efforts of workers &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;    are the most  essential production factor. It was impossible to explain the modern [[economic growth]] without introduction the second value-creating factor, closely connected with production equipment. The neoclassical [[economics]] has delabourated the ideas about productive force of capital  and is using the value of production equipment &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; as a characteristic variable.&lt;ref name=cobb&gt;Cobb, G.W. and  Douglas, P.N. (1928). "A Theory of Production." American Economic Review, Suppl. (March), pp. 139-165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sollow&gt;Solow, R. (1957). "Technical Change and the Aggregate Production Function." Review of Economic Studies, vol. 39 (Aug.), pp. 312-330.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to it, econodynamics  has been taking into account the functional role of production equipment, as  a set of appliances that allow to substitute efforts of workers with work of outer sources of power. A new concept of substitutive work &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; was introduced, to  characterize the functional role of machinery in production processes.  The law of substitution, which is  one of the main principles of econodynamics,  generalized the Smith-Marx’s  [[labour theory of value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Energy and organization: Growth and distribution reexamined.| last1 = Beaudreau | first1 = B.C.  | publisher = Greenwood Press|year =1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=| last = Pokrovskii| first = V.N. | year = 2008| title = ) An extension of the labour theory of value | url = http://ecodynamics.narod.ru/value/value.pdf | journal = Pluralist Economics Review | volume = | issue = February|bibcode = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Beaudreau, B.C. &amp; Pokrovski, V.N. (2010) On the energy content of a money unit.  Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 389 (13), 2597–2606.&lt;/ref&gt; and  provide a new interpretation of neo-classical economics. The variable &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true  work of production equipment and is equivalent to workers’ efforts in entire relationship, so that the production of value &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; can be considered as a function of the two production factors
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
Y = Y(L, P)                 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
The extension of  the labour theory of value  with the  law of substitution  allows us to formulate the theory,&lt;ref name=article&gt;Pokrovski, V.N. (2003).  "Energy in the theory of production." Energy 28, 769-788.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Econodynamics. The Theory of Social Production.|last = Pokrovskii|first = Vladimir| publisher = Springer, Dordrecht-Heidelberg-London-New York.|year = 2011|isbn = |location = https://www.springer.com/physics/complexity/book/978-94-007-2095-4|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, in fact, is a modification and re-interpretation of neo-classical theory of production with two production factors: labour &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and capital &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. The comparison of the theory with neo-classical theory  [[growth accounting]] that introduce the technical progress as the exogenous factor &lt;math&gt;A(t)&lt;/math&gt; gives  the expression  
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
A(t) = \, \left(\frac{K_0}{K} \frac{P}{P_0}\right)^\alpha, \quad 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
The exogenous neo-classical technical progress &lt;math&gt;A(t)&lt;/math&gt; appears to be connected with the ratio of substitutive work to stock of capital &lt;math&gt;P/K&lt;/math&gt;, which can be considered as a  measure of technological progress itself, independent on the assumption made in the neo-classical theory. Sometimes it is convenient to use the non-dimensional  ratio of substitutive work to labour efforts &lt;math&gt;P/L&lt;/math&gt; as a characteristic  of technological progress; this quantity can be interpreted as the number of 'mechanical workers', operating in the production processes, in line with an 'alive worker'.  To the end  of the last century, this ratio reaches, for example, 12 for the USA&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;. Technical progress, as an internal property of the theory, is understood as a progress in substitution of labour with work of production equipment in technological processes.

The introduction  of the substitutive work &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;  could be useful, if one can measure  the  quantity. Although one can easily find estimates of the total amount of primary energy carriers, the biggest interest for our aims is caused by possible assessments of the quantity of energy going to the substitution of workers' efforts in processes of the production.  This is a problem, which has been considered specially.&lt;ref&gt;Pokrovski, V.N. (2007) Productive energy in the US economy, Energy 32 (5) 816-822.&lt;/ref&gt; The direct methods of estimation of the substitutive work can be used for both past and future situations. For example, the total  amount of substitutive work  in the U.S. economy in 1999 can be estimated as &lt;math&gt;10^{18}&lt;/math&gt; J per year. It is approximately one hundred times less than  total (primary) consumption of energy, which was about &lt;math&gt;97\cdot10^{18}&lt;/math&gt; J in 1999. However, the amount of primary energy (energy carriers), which is needed to provide this amount of substitutive work, is about &lt;math&gt;25\cdot 10^{18}&lt;/math&gt; J. It is about 26% of total primary consumption of energy.

===Value, Utility and Entropy===
Econodynamics establishes  relationship between the concreate wealth and abstract concepts of [[value (economics)|value]], [[utility]] and [[entropy]]. The artificial products created by humans: buildings, machines, vehicles, sanitation, clothes, home appliances and so on, can be sorted and counted, so that one consider the amounts of quantities  in  natural units of measurement &lt;math&gt; Q_1, Q_2,..., Q_n&lt;/math&gt;  and the prices of all products &lt;math&gt; p_1, p_2,..., p_n&lt;/math&gt;  to be given, so that one can define increase in value  of a stock of products  as
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
dW =  \sum_{j=1}^np_j \, dQ_j.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

Due to dependence of prices on the amounts of products &lt;math&gt; p_i = p_i (Q_1, Q_2, ..., Q_n) &lt;/math&gt;,  one can hardly expect that form (4) is a total differential of any  function. In other words, one cannot say that &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a characteristic of the set of the products which is independent of the history of their creation. However, a function of a state, which is called [[utility function]], can be introduced on the basis of relation (4). Indeed, the linear form (4)  can be multiplied by  a certain function, which is called integration factor &lt;math&gt;\phi = \phi ( Q_1, Q_2,..., Q_n)&lt;/math&gt;,  so that, instead of form (4), one  has a total differential of a new function 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
dU =  \sum_{j=1}^n \phi ( Q_1, Q_2,..., Q_n) \, p_j ( Q_1, Q_2,..., Q_n) \, dQ_j.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}	The introduced function &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; is called [[utility]] function (objective), taking into account that the properties of function &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; coincide with those of the conventional [[utility]] function, which is introduced as {subjective} utility function connected with sensation of preference of one aggregate of products as against another. The above transformation of value to  utility reminds us transformation of heat to [[entropy]] in thermodynamics. In other terms, analogy between theory of utility and theory of heat  was discussed by von Neumann and Morgenstern &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=John von Neumann |last=Neumann |first=John von |authorlink2=Oskar Morgenstern |last2=Morgenstern |first2=Oskar |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Theory of Games and Economic Behavior |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (see item 3.2.1 of their work).

The artificial  products can be considered, as it was explained by Prigogine with collaborators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title =  From being to becoming: Time and complexity in the physical sciences.| last1 = Prigogine | first1 = I.  | publisher = Freeman &amp; Company|year =1980|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Self-organisation in non-equilibrium systems: From dissipative structures to order through fluctuations.|last1 = Nicolis | first1 = G.  | last2 = Prigogine | first2 = I.  | publisher = John Wiley \&amp; Sons|year =1977|isbn = |location =New York |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;, as the far-from-equilibrium objects (the dissipative structures), and to create and maintain them,    the fluxes of matter and energy  are necessary to run  through the system. In our case, energy comes in the form of human efforts &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and work of external sources &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; that can be used by means of the appropriate equipment. The creation of dissipative structures leads to decrease in entropy, and utility &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; can be considered as a close relation to entropy &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, though does not coincides with it. Considering that changes of internal energy in production of things can be neglected, one can write a thermodynamic relation 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
dU \approx - dS =  \frac{1}{T} (L+P).
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}
Reconciliation of the two points of view on the phenomenon of  production  leads to a unified picture  that enables us to relate some aspects of our observations of economic phenomena to physical principles. A flux of information and work eventually determines new organisation of matter, which acquires forms of different commodities (complexity), whereby the production process is considered as a process of materialisation of information. The cost of materialisation of information is work of production system. To maintain complexity in a thermodynamic system, fluxes of matter and energy must flow through the system.



==Dynamics of development==

===Equations of evolution===
{{details|topic=|Technological theory of social production}}
To formulate the system of evolution equations of  the production system, function (1)  ought to be specified and dynamic equations for production factors &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;  to be formulated, while nessasery technological characteristics of production equipment to be introduced. In result, it came to the set of equations of [[economic growth]] -- the theory of evolution,  dubbed as the [[technological theory of social production]]. The theory is formulated  both in one-sector, and, using the [[Wassily Leontief]]'s [[input-output model]],   in multi-sector approximations. The data for the U.S. economy in the last century was used to justify the specification of the theory. It was demonstrated that the  substitution of worker's efforts  with work of the production equipment appears to be more adequate idea than the substitution of worker's efforts  with the amount of production equipment (capital in the neo-classical theory of economic growth);  work can be replaced onky with work, not with capital.  The theory demonstrates that the growth of production  is caused by achievements in technological consumption of labour and energy. The set of  equations determines three modes of economic development, depending on deficit of one of the factors: investment, labour or substitutive work.&lt;ref&gt;Pokrovskii, V.N. (2011)   Pulsation of the growth rate of output and technology.  Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, Vol. 390  (23-24),  4347-4354.&lt;/ref&gt; The changing of modes during the development reveals as short cycles in growth—the busyness cycles.

===Applications===

The theory can be applied to any  national economy; principles of consistent analysis and forecast are considered.  As an example, dynamics of Russian economy for  years 1960 - 2060  is considered in one-sector and three-sector approximations(see&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;. Chapter 8 and 9). The elementary, three-branch model is used (see&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;. Section 2.2.2, Table 2.2 in Chapter 2 and Section 9.5 in Chapter 9) for the description of dynamics of production (the expanded reproduction, in Marx's terms).

The theory allows, being based on the [[Angus Maddison]]"s estimates of the [[Gross World Product]] and [[World population]], to restore the picture of development of mankind in the previous centuries. It was shown (see &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;, Chapter 12). that one need the theory, based on the effect of substitution of worker's efforts with work of external power (two-factor theory), for the description of  the  evolution of production activity  from approximately year 1000 of our era. Before this time the substitution of human’s efforts for outer work  practically was not noticeable, and one can use one-factor theory that is taking into  account only one production factor -- efforts of workers. The theory is stated (see&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;. section 1.3.1, the formula 1.1 in chapter 1 and section 12.3 in chapter 12).

===The principle of evolution===

One can see on raw of examples  that the production system, indeed, tries to swallow all available resources.&lt;ref name=article /&gt; This sentence can be considered as the principle of development of the production system and the human population itself, that has been developing as a self-organising system, trying to catch as much energy as possible. The human population, as    any biological population obeys  energy principle of evolution, which states that  those populations and their associations (ecosystems) which can use the greater amount of energy from their environment have an advantage for survival.&lt;ref&gt;Lotka, A.J.  Elements of Physical Biology, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odum, H.T. Environmental Accounting. Energy and Environmental Decision Making, John Wiley \&amp; Sons, New York {\it etc}, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of energy is used by a human population through improvements of technology, and the managing huge amount of energy allows the human population to survive in every climate zone of the Earth and expand itself in great measure. The enlargement of the human population from a very small group a million years ago till about 7 billion in year 2012 ought to be apparently connected with enhancement of the living conditions. Apparently, it is impossible to explain growth of number of human population, not referring on social production system—the means  of adopting the human to conditions of existence.&lt;ref name=book&gt;V.N. Pokrovski, Physical Principles in the Theory of Economic Growth, Ashgate Publishing, Aldershot, 1999. A revised and extended version of the monograph is published by Springer (2011) as [https://www.springer.com/physics/complexity/book/978-94-007-2095-4 ''Econodynamics. The Theory of Social Production''].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The absolute measure of value==
Production of value (for year, for example) &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;  is a money  estimate  of 'useful' changes in our environment (in the form of useful consumer goods and services), which can be connected with production factors. In the Smith-Marx's theory of value, it is postulated that estimate of the efforts of workers &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is  an ultimate  source of all created wealth (products), an absolute measure of value. When one accounts the effect of substitution  of workers' efforts with the true work of the production equipment, one could expect, that the total amount of work  on the production of value, which is the sum of properly accounted work of humans &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and work of production equipment (substitutive work) &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, both measured in power units, could be an absolute measure of value, and one can write  
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
Y \sim P + L
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}
This relation allows one to estimate  the work needed for creation of wealth worth of one monetary units (energy content of monetary unit), which was done  for different cases&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;. For example, the mean value of 'energy content' of dollar  of year 1996 in  years 1960 - 2000 is &lt;math&gt;1.4\times 10^5&lt;/math&gt;   J.  The values of the 'energy content' of monetary units that are used for accounting  change during the time, which shows that the used units of money do not present constant amounts of 'true' value. The absolute  measure of value can be  introduced as some amount of energy.

'''Elspeth Cantlie Kennedy''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|QSO|MBE|size=85%}} (born '''Elsie Cantlie Myron'''; 3 April 1931 – 8 January 2017) was a New Zealand sharebroker and community leader. She was the first woman in New Zealand to be elected as a member of a metropolitan stock exchange, and the first to run her own broking firm. Kennedy chaired the Nelson Tasman Hospice Trust from 1998 to 2014.

==Early life and family==
Born in [[Invercargill]] on 3 April 1931 as Elsie Cantlie Myron, she was  educated at [[Southland Girls' High School]].&lt;ref name="Whos who"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Taylor |editor-first=Alister |title=New Zealand Who's Who Aotearoa 1994|year=1994|publisher=New Zealand Who's Who Aotearoa |location=Auckland |isbn=0-908578-24-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She showed early business acumen, running her grandfather's coal retailing business when she was just 17 years old, and then worked at the Invercargill City Council where she became credit manager at the age of 20 years.&lt;ref name="Bulls"/&gt; In 1952 Kennedy went to Britain to study singing, qualiifying as a [[Trinity College London|Fellow of Trinity College London]].&lt;ref name="Bulls"/&gt; Returning to New Zealand, Kennedy later settled in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] in the 1970s, where she taught at the Nelson School of Music.&lt;ref name="Bulls"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson Mail 2008"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/news/779837/Award-honours-entire-hospice-team | title=Award 'honours entire hospice team' | date=31 December 2008 | work=Nelson Mail | accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married James Kennedy-Simpson. The couple had three children but later divorced.&lt;ref name="Whos who"/&gt;

==Sharebroking career==
In 1979 Kennedy was employed by [[Frank Renouf]] as the local-body specialist at his [[Wellington]] sharebroking firm, and three years later she became the first woman in New Zealand to become a member of a metropolitan stock exchange when she was elected to the Wellington Exchange. Kennedy joined Francis Allison Symes in 1984, establishing that firm's local authority money market.  She was the first New Zealand woman, in January 1987, to establish her own brokerage firm, Kennedy Sharebrokers, which merged with Main Corporation later that year.&lt;ref name="Bulls"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first=David |title=Bulls, Bears and Elephants: A History of the New Zealand Stock Exchange |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=GljzNcev1AEC |accessdate=12 January 2017 |year=1997 |publisher=Victoria University Press |location=Wellington |isbn=0-86473-308-9 |page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later business activities==
After resigning as chair of Main Corporation in December 1987, Kennedy was involved in setting up the Government Computer Service, of which she was a director until 1993. She also served as deputy chair of the Nelson Bays Business Development Board, chair of the [[South Island]] Promotion Association, and a director of various companies including [[Mount Cook Group]].&lt;ref name="Whos who"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bulls"/&gt;

==Community service==
Kennedy became a trustee of the Nelson Tasman Hospice Trust in 1998, and served as chair of that organisation from 1998 until 2014. She was instrumental in the establishment of the Nelson Hospice in 1999.&lt;ref name="Nelson Mail 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuff obituary"/&gt;

==Honours and awards==
In the [[1990 New Year Honours]] Kennedy was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Member of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=51982 |date=30 December 1989 |page=30 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1990 she received the [[New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal]].&lt;ref name="Whos who"/&gt; She was appointed a [[Queen's Service Order|Companion of the Queen's Service Order]] for services to the community in the [[2009 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/node/366 | title=New Year honours list 2009 |date=31 December 2008 | publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet | accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Kennedy was named Nelsonian of the Year by the ''[[The Nelson Mail|Nelson Mail]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref name="Stuff obituary"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/88320859/nelson-business-pioneer-elspeth-kennedy-leaves-legacy | title=Nelson business pioneer Elspeth Kennedy leaves legacy | date=12 January 2017 | work=Stuff.co.nz | accessdate=12 January 2017 | first=Samantha | last=Gee}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was posthumously inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/trailblazers/news/article.cfm?c_id=1504553&amp;objectid=12120526| title=Trailblazers: Elspeth Kennedy | date=17 September 2018 | work=New Zealand Herald | accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Government performance management''' (GPM) consists of a set of processes that help government organizations optimize their business performance. It provides a framework for organizing, automating, and analyzing business methodologies, metrics, processes and systems that drive business performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-management.com/bissues/20070301/2600312-1.html|title=Performance Management for Government|author=Michael Owellen|date=28 February 2007|work=BI Review Magazine|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators{{who|date=October 2014}} see GPM as the next generation of [[business intelligence]] (BI) for governments. GPM helps governments to make use of their financial, human, material, and other resources.  In the past, owners have sought to drive strategy down and across their organizations; they have struggled to transform strategies into actionable metrics and they have grappled with meaningful analysis to expose the cause-and-effect relationships that, if understood, could give profitable insight to their operational decision-makers.  GPM software and methods allow a systematic, integrated approach that links government strategy to core processes and activities. "Running by the numbers" now means something: planning, budgeting, analysis, and reporting can give the measurements that empower management decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O12-performancemanagement.html |accessdate=7 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112223214/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O12-performancemanagement.html |archivedate=12 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance management (PM) market ==
According to [[Gartner]]{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}, the Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) suite market continues to experience strong momentum, growing 19% during 2007. This is slightly in advance of their earlier market sizing and forecast analysis, which anticipated 2007 revenue to be $1.836&amp;nbsp;million, representing an 18% year-over-year growth. In the latest forecast, Gartner believe that the market for EPM will be more than $3&amp;nbsp;billion by 2011, representing a 14.4% compound annual growth rate. Several factors contributed to the continued significant growth in EPM revenue during 2007:
* Many organizations replaced difficult-to-maintain, inflexible, or outmoded spreadsheets and homegrown financial applications.
* Continued growth in large enterprises was fueled by desires to achieve greater transparency and adherence to governance and compliance legislation.
* Increased demand for applications that support strategic plans and operational activities drove new momentum in the deployment of scorecards.
* There was increased demand from mid-size enterprises, representing one of the largest untapped and dynamic areas of the business application software sector.
* Advertising and PR from increasingly large vendors and system integrators are raising the EPM profile and generating greater demand.

Gartner expects the business Intelligence software market to reach $3 billion in 2009. "Companies around the world have purchased more than US$40&amp;nbsp;billion worth of enterprise applications, including ERP, CRM and HR, during the past few years," said Colleen Graham, principal research analyst at Gartner. "This has generated significant volumes of data in support of the operational processes they automate. By investing in BI, companies can further leverage their enterprise application investments and turn the torrent of data into meaningful insight to better measure performance, respond more quickly to market changes and opportunities and comply with an increasingly complex regulatory environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/press_releases/asset_144782_11.html|title=Gartner News Room|publisher=Gartner.com|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait Henri Tudor.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Henri Tudor]]
'''Henri Owen Tudor''' (30 September 1859, in [[Ferschweiler]] – 31 May 1928) was a [[Luxembourg]]ish [[engineer]], [[inventor]], and [[industrialist]].  He developed the first practical [[lead-acid battery]] in 1886 ([[Gaston Planté]] was the French physicist who invented the theoretical principle of a lead-acid battery in 1859).

==Tudor batteries==
Tudor established a factory in [[Rosport]] for the purposes of manufacturing the batteries.   However, the cost of manufacturing the product in Luxembourg, which had no lead industry and little domestic demand of its own, forced Tudor to expand manufacturing abroad, particularly in [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], and the [[United Kingdom]].  Tudor died in 1928, at the age of 68, of [[lead poisoning]].  At the time of his death, 25,000 people worked in the manufacture of Tudor batteries.

==Recognition==
In 1987, [[CRP Henri Tudor]] (the Public Research Centre Henri Tudor) was founded in Luxembourg, and named in honor of Henri Owen Tudor and his devotion to research and innovation. In May 2009, the [[Tudor Museum]] with exhibits relating to his development of the lead-acid accumulator, opened in Rosport Castle where Tudor lived.&lt;ref name=historique&gt;[http://musee-tudor.lu/pages/fr/musee/historique.php?lang=FR "Historique du musée"], ''Musée Tudor''. {{Fr icon}}.

{{nihongo|'''Hideo Ohkubo'''|大久保 秀夫|Ōkubo Hideo|born 1954}} is the founder, chairman, and president of [[Tokyo]]-based Forval Corporation.

==Education and early career==
Ohkubo was born in Tokyo. He graduated from the Law department of [[Kokugakuin University]]. He worked at both traditional Japanese large-scaled corporations and the foreign-oriented full-commission based companies and saw the advantages and disadvantages over each other. He thus got the idea to undertake the creation of a company with the advantages of both types of companies.

==Forval's founding==
He founded {{nihongo|Nippon Kouhan|日本工販}} in 1980. Within a year of its founding, it had already become Japan's top [[Business telephone system|business telephone]] leasing company.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-19/business/fi-3656_1_japanese-firm|periodical=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1986-12-19|accessdate=2010-07-12|title=N.Y. Firm Opens a Bridge to Japan|last=Matsubara|first=Katsumi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 his company went public on JASDAQ, becoming the youngest company in history to do so. That same year he won the "Young Entrepreneur of the Year" Award from the New Business Convention.

In 2000 Forval Telecom made its first public offering on the Mothers board of the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]]. In 2001 Forval Creative made a public offering on [[NASDAQ Japan]] (now the Hercules market of the [[Osaka Securities Exchange]]).

==Other activities==
Ohkubo supports financing and various arrangements that have encouraged past Forval employees and business partners to create their own successful companies, some of which have since gone public. He also works with the Forval Foundation, which sponsors the "Stradivarius Scholarship" to grant the winner of a violinist competition the free use of the foundation's [[Stradivarius]] violin for 2 years.

He is a leadership committee member of the [[Tokyo Chamber of Commerce]], vice-committee chairman of Advancement of New Industry, and vice-chairman of the New Business Convention.

Isao Nakauchi served in the [[Philippines]] as an infantryman during [[World War II]]. His business empire started in Osaka 1957 and it led to the creation of "American-style" supermarkets in Japan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4669">'''James Hamilton''' (1769–1829) was an Irish language teacher, who introduced the "Hamiltonian system" of teaching languages.

==Life==
Hamilton was taught for four years at a [[Dublin]] school run by two [[Jesuits]], Beatty and Mulhall. He went into business, and for about three years before the [[French Revolution]] was living in France.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Hamilton, James (1769-1829)|volume=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1798 Hamilton was established as a merchant in [[Hamburg]], and went for instruction in German to General D'Angeli, a French émigré. D'Angeli, without using a grammar book, translated to him word for word a German book of anecdotes, parsing as he proceeded; and after about twelve lessons Hamilton found that he could read some German books. Beatty and Mulhall had had a somewhat similar system.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Moving to Paris Hamilton with the banking-house of Karcher &amp; Co., did business with England at the time of the [[Peace of Amiens]]. At the end of the Pace in 1803 he was detained, and his business was ruined.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Hamilton went to New York in October 1815, with the idea of becoming a farmer and manufacturing [[potash]]. He changed his mind, and began to teach languages. His method started with a word-for-word translation, and left instruction in grammar till a later stage. His first pupils were three ministers and Judge [[William P. Van Ness]] of the District Court; he charged a dollar a lesson, and taught pupils to read French in 24 lessons of four hours each.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In September 1816 Hamilton went to [[Philadelphia]], and gave a lecture on the "Hamiltonian System". In 1817 he moved on to [[Baltimore]], his wife and daughters teaching with him. The professors at Baltimore College ridiculed him in a play, ''The New Mode of Teaching'', acted by their pupils. Hamilton went to the play, and three days later published it in a newspaper, with his own comments. He claimed a Hamiltonian school at Baltimore, with more than 160 pupils and 20 teachers. Bad health and money troubles meant he went on to Washington.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

At Boston, Hamilton could only obtain four pupils. A professor at [[Boston University]] attacked him as a charlatan, but a committee examined his pupils, and he soon had 200. He taught also at colleges in Schenectady, Princeton, Yale, Hartford, and Middleburg.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1822 Hamilton went to [[Montreal]], and then to [[Quebec]]. At Montreal he instructed a gaoler, and then successfully taught reading to eight English prisoners there. He left America in July 1823, and came to London, where in eighteen months he had more than 600 pupils learning different languages, and seven teachers. He left his school to the teachers, and afterwards taught his system in Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh, Dublin, Belfast, and at least other places. In London he taught at his house, No. 25 Cecil Street, [[Strand, London|Strand]], and then in [[Gower Street, London|Gower Street]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

As an experiment over six months in 1825 saw ten school boys live in Hamilton's house. At the end of the period they were examined in Latin translation, French and Italian. The expenses of this experiment were partly borne by John Smith, M.P. Hamilton's system and extensive advertising were attacked by school-masters and others. A defence by [[Sydney Smith]] appeared in the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' for June 1826. The Hamiltonian system was also defended in the ''[[Westminster Review]]''.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Hamilton died in Dublin on 16 September 1829, in his sixtieth year.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
[[File:Jul. Cesar Commentarii De Bello Gallico Liber Primus.jpg|thumb|Hamiltonian system, interlinear Swedish text for ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'']]
In Philadelphia Hamilton printed his first reading-book, chapters i–iii. of St. John's Gospel, in French, with an interlinear translation. Further books with literal and interlinear English translations published by Hamilton, and mostly of gospels and classics, appeared in [[Ancient Greek]], Latin including [[Charles François Lhomond]]'s ''Epitome Historiæ Sacræ'', French including [[Jean Baptiste Perrin (fl. 1786)|Jean Baptiste Perrin]]'s ''Fables'', German including [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]]'s ''Robinson Crusoe'', and Italian. In time unauthorised books appeared, professing to be adapted to his system.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4930">'''Johan Houwers''' (born 4 October 1957 in [[Winterswijk]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] politician and [[real estate broker]]. As a member of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie) he was an [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|MP]] from 26 October 2010 to 20 September 2012. He focused on matters of [[greenhouse]]s, [[fishery]], [[hunting]], [[animal welfare]], [[spatial planning]] and [[water]]. From 8 November 2012 he once again was an MP, resigning on 22 July 2013 following to a mortgage fraud investigation. He served as an independent MP between 25 March 2015 and 23 March 2017.&lt;ref name=parl&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.parlement.com/id/vifbi4vltgyt/j_johan_houwers |title=Drs. J. (Johan) Houwers |publisher=Parlement.com |date= |accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houwers was a member of the [[municipal council]] of Winterswijk from 1990 to 2002 and again between 11 March 2010 and 5 July 2012. From 1990 to 1994 and again since 2010 he was VVD [[fractievoorzitter|fraction leader]]. From 1994 to 2001 he was also an [[alderman]] and from 1999 to 2010 a member of the [[States of Gelderland]].&lt;ref name=parl/&gt;

Houwers studied [[social geography]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) as well as [[urban planning]] ([[Master of Arts|MA]]) at [[Radboud University Nijmegen]].

After the possible return of the [[wolf]] to the Netherlands, Houwers mentioned that if the population numbers rose, wolves should be shot so they would not present a harm to society. Houwers clashed with the coalition [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] politician [[Lutz Jacobi]] on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.tubantia.nl/regio/achterhoek/winterswijks-kamerlid-houwers-wolf-afschieten-1.3907761 |title=

==Mortgage fraud investigation==
On 22 July 2013 Houwers resigned his seat after it was revealed that the police started an investigation into him concerning possible mortgage fraud. [[Aegon N.V.|Aegon]] and [[Rabobank]], the mortgage providers, filed charges against him because he did not represent his income correctly. On 31 July justice authorities seized Houwers' property in Winterswijk for 1 million euro. Houwers said he would wait for the outcome of the investigation before responding to the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/Nederland/article/detail/3484626/2013/07/31/Justitie-legt-beslag-op-landgoed-oud-VVD-er-Johan-Houwers.dhtml |title=Justitie legt beslag op landgoed oud-VVD'er Johan Houwers |language=Dutch |publisher=[[Algemeen Dagblad]] |date=31 July 2013 |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March 2015 he was found guilty of forgery and fraud and had to pay a fine of €4000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.gelderlander.nl/regio/achterhoek/winterswijk/boete-voor-geschorst-vvd-kamerlid-wegens-oplichting-1.4810247 |title=Boete voor geschorst VVD-Kamerlid wegens oplichting |language=Dutch |publisher=[[De Gelderlander]] |date=17 March 2015 |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the fraction leader of the VVD in Parliament, [[Halbe Zijlstra]], he could not return as an MP for the VVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.gelderlander.nl/algemeen/binnenland/vvd-fractie-weert-houwers-na-hypotheekfraude-1.4810354 |title=VVD-fractie weert Houwers na hypotheekfraude |language=Dutch |publisher=De Gelderlander |date=17 March 2015 |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonel '''John Hamilton Gillespie''' (14 October 1852 – 7 September 1923) was a Scottish-American soldier, land developer, businessman and politician, who settled in [[Sarasota, Florida]], becoming Sarasota's first mayor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20131224013554/http://www.sarasotahistoryalive.com/stories/journals-of-yesteryear/colonel-john-hamilton-gillespie/?back=Stories Profile], sarasotahistoryalive.com; accessed 26 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20111022/ARTICLE/111029855 Profile], heraldtribune.com; accessed 26 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Biography==
[[File:53 Northumberland Street, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|180px|53 Northumberland Street, Edinburgh]]
Gillespie was born in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Makers"&gt;{{cite book |title=Makers of America: An Historical and Biographical Work by an Able Corps of Writers, Florida historical society (Jacksonville, Fla.)|publisher=A. B. Caldwell|year=1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a boy he lived with his family at 53 Northumberland Street, Edinburgh and was educated at the nearby [[Edinburgh Academy]] and subsequently at the [[University of St Andrews]].&lt;ref name="Register"&gt;{{cite book |title=Edinburgh Academy Register: A Record of All Those Who Have Entered the School Since Its Foundation in 1824|publisher=Edinburgh, Printed by T. &amp; A. Constable for the Edinburgh Academical Club|year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Like his father, he was a member of the [[Royal Company of Archers]].&lt;ref name="Register"/&gt; (a ceremonial unit that serves as the Sovereign's Bodyguard in Scotland).  He was admitted to [[Society of Writers to Her Majesty’s Signet|The Society of Writers to Her Majesty’s Signet]] in 1875 and also served as a captain in the Midlothian Coast Artillery Volunteers.&lt;ref name="Makers"/&gt; Upon his return from colonial service in [[Australia]], his father, Sir John Gillespie, sent him to [[Sarasota, Florida]] in 1886 to work for the Florida Mortgage and Investment Company.&lt;ref name="Makers"/&gt;

Gillespie found his father’s company in poor condition and began improving the community in Sarasota and soon business was booming. In May 1886 he laid out two golf holes on his property. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1798&amp;dat=19630606&amp;id=QB8eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3osEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5439,575222  This was the first golf course in Florida and the second in the United States.] An avid golfer, Gillespie learned the game at [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|St. Andrews]]. In 1905 he built a nine-hole course on property now which is now the site of the [[Sarasota County, Florida|Sarasota County Courthouse, Florida]]. He went on to lay out courses for Henry Plant, [[Tampa]], [[Winter Park, Florida|Winter Park]] and [[Havana, Cuba]]. Sarasota was incorporated as a town on 14 October 1902, coincidentally Gillespie's 50th birthday, and he went on to served as the Town's first Mayor. He was subsequently elected to five additional one-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sarasotagov.com/InsideCityGovernment/Content/Commissioners/CelebrateSarasota/CelebrateSarasotaHistory4.html/|title= The City of Sarasota Florida Website|publisher= The City of Sarasota|accessdate= 2 June 2015|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081121061325/http://www.sarasotagov.com/InsideCityGovernment/Content/Commissioners/CelebrateSarasota/CelebrateSarasotaHistory4.html|archivedate= 21 November 2008|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gillespie was instrumental in founding the Episcopal Church in Sarasota. He was ordained as a Deacon in the Episcopal Church and is acknowledged as the founder of The Church of the Redeemer Sarasota.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20150309125628/http://www.sarasotahistoryalive.com/stories/journals-of-yesteryear/the-beginning-of-church-of-the-redeemer/ Profile], sarasotahistoryalive.com; accessed 26 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried, alongside Blanche McDaniel Gillespie (his second wife), in the historic [[Rosemary Cemetery]], Sarasota.

==Personal life==
John Hung's maternal grandfather was Sir [[Robert Hormus Kotewall]] and he is the step-son of M. C. Hung, who was the last compradore of [[Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.]] He attended Pui Ching Middle School to learn Chinese.

==Career==
Hung held posts with various Wheelock-owned companies, including [[Cable TV Hong Kong]] (vice-chairman) and [[The Cross-Harbour (Holdings)|Cross-Harbour Holdings]] (executive director). He also served as chairman of the Hong Kong government's Sports Development Board.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg20081111"/&gt; He was awarded a [[Silver Bauhinia Star]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="Standard20090626"/&gt; He retired in 2002.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg20081111"/&gt; Following his retirement, he continued to work as a consultant.&lt;ref name="RTHK20020927"&gt;{{citation|title=Ex-Taipan urges SAR to preserve 'British heritage'|periodical=Radio Television Hong Kong|date=2002-09-27|accessdate=2010-03-31|url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/press/eng/20020927_67_43959.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bribery scandal==
In November 2008, Hung was arrested by [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] officers outside of the [[Conrad Hotels|Conrad]] Hotel at [[Pacific Place (Hong Kong)|Pacific Place]].&lt;ref name="Bloomberg20081111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Standard20090626"/&gt; In June 2009, a court found that Hung had accepted a HK$450,000 bribe in exchange for his support of Joanne Wong Pui's application for full membership in the [[Hong Kong Jockey Club]], convicting him of one count of soliciting an advantage and three of accepting an advantage. He was sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to pay HK$350,000 to the HKJC; the judge gave him a mild sentence in light of his age and his "past contributions to Hong Kong".&lt;ref name="Standard20090626"/&gt; 

He filed an appeal to have his conviction overturned; however, it was denied.&lt;ref name="OrientalDaily"&gt;{{citation|url=http://orientaldaily.on.cc/cnt/news/20100504/00176_082.html|date=2010-05-04|accessdate=2010-08-17|periodical=Oriental Daily News|title=法庭：要求法官避席 洪承禧遭駁回}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=RTHK|title=Former Wheelock boss loses graft appeal|url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/20100630/news_20100630_56_680010.htm|date=2010-06-30|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] stated that there was "ample evidence" of his guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/20100708/news_20100708_56_681880.htm|date=2010-07-08|accessdate=2010-08-17|title='Ample evidence' of John Hung's guilt |periodical=RTHK|last=Ho|first=Maggie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hung's Silver Bauhinia Star (SBS) and Justice of the Peace (JP) were stripped following his convictions.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Comparisonoffoodlabels.jpg|thumb|right|A voluntary Mexican nutrition label (on the left) versus its mandatory American equivalent (on the right), for the same product ([[Chips Ahoy!]] [[chocolate chip cookie]]s from [[Kraft Foods]] [[subsidiary]] [[Nabisco]]).]] --&gt;
'''Mandatory labelling''' or '''labeling''' (see [[spelling differences]]) is the requirement of consumer products to state their ingredients or components.

[[Moral purchasing]] and problems like [[allergy|allergies]] are two things which are enabled by labelling.  It is mandated in most [[developed nation]]s, and increasingly in [[developing nations]], especially for food products, ''e.g.'' "Grade A" [[meat]]s. With regard to [[food]] and [[approved drug|drugs]], mandatory labelling has been a major battleground between [[Consumer protection|consumer advocates]] and [[corporation]]s since the late 19th century.

Because of past [[scandal]]s involving deceptive labelling, countries like the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] require most processed foods to have a [[Nutrition facts label]] on the label, and the table's formatting and content must conform to strict guidelines.  The [[European Union]] equivalent is the slightly different [[Nutrition information]] table, which may also be supplemented with standardized icons indicating the presence of [[allergen]]s.

In [[China]], all [[clothing]] is labelled with the [[factory]] of origin, including [[telephone number|telephone]] and [[fax]] numbers, although this information is not available to buyers outside China, who see only a generic [[Made In China]] tag.

The development [[genetically modified food]] has led to one of the most persistent and divisive debates about the mandatory labelling, which is one of the central topics in [[genetically modified food controversies]].  Advocates of such labelling claim that the consumer should make the choice whether to expose themselves to any possible [[health risk]] from consuming such foods.  Detractors point to studies that conclude [[genetically modified food]] is safe, and point out that for many commodity products, the identity of the grower and the custody chain are not known.

Voluntary labelling and co-marketing of products deemed desirable is another matter usually carried out by entirely different means, ''e.g.'' [[Slow Food]].  There has been increased regulatory interest in substantiating these claims, and in some jurisdictions, food labels require regulatory approval before use.

An interesting halfway is those labels that are considered mandatory by one buying population and effectively preclude purchase if they are not there, e.g. [[kosher]], [[vegan]], and the aforementioned [[GMO-free]] label now seen on many [[Organic food|organic]] products.

Areas in which mandatory labelling is being discussed{{by whom|date=October 2012}} include:{{citation needed|date=February 2009}}
* [[genetically modified food]] - see [[genetically modified food controversies]]
* [[Phage therapy|spraying of meat with bacteriophages]]
* in the United States, fresh meat was added to the list of products which require mandatory [[Country of Origin label]]s (mCOOL) in 2002, however this was the subject of a challenge in the [[World Trade Organization]] by Canada, which Canada won in 2011

'''Matthew Elderfield''' (born 12 January 1966) was Deputy Governor and Head of Financial Regulation at the [[Central Bank of Ireland]], a position sometimes referred to colloquial in Ireland as the [[Financial Regulator]] between January 2010 and October 2013.  He is also the former chief executive of the [[Bermuda Monetary Authority]] (BMA).

==Education==
Elderfield graduated from [[Cambridge University]] in 1988 with a master's degree in International relations, and earned a bachelor's degree in foreign service, cum laude, from the School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University in 1987.&lt;ref name = "Business and Leadership" /&gt;

He was at asked at a parliamentary committee "In regard to baseline qualifications, if your staff is regulating the financial sector, should it not be the case where they should have the bare minimum required in the market as well, a qualified financial adviser status, or they've gone through certain industry exams. It's obviously important to have." But Mr Elderfield disagreed: "I don't agree with that. But I think I'm conflicted because I've never taken a professional exam in my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/financial-watchdog-reveals-his-lack-of-a-specialist-qualification-2182088.html | work=Irish Independent | first=Ronald | last=Quinlan | title=Financial watchdog reveals his lack of a specialist qualification | date=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Elderfield was chief executive of the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA, the financial services sector in Bermuda) from July 2007. During his two years as head of the financial regulator in Bermuda, Elderfield introduced reforms to strengthen the island's reputation for international insurance, banking and fund management. He strengthened regulation in [[Bermuda]] by significantly increasing staff numbers, expanding the BMA's learning and development programme, and introducing a scoring system for management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2009/1024/1224257392748.html|title=Financial watchdog's impeccable pedigree|publisher= ''[[Irish Times]]''|author=Simon Carswell|date=24 October 2009|accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to joining the BMA, Elderfield spent eight years at the UK [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA) as a head of a number of departments responsible for exchange and clearing-house supervision of secondary markets, listing policy and for banking supervision. He was the official responsible for supervising [[Northern Rock]] in the months before the collapsed bank applied for its first bailout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/regulator-helped-supervise-northern-rock-before-bailout-2211123.html | work=Irish Independent | first=Laura | last=Noonan | title=Regulator helped supervise Northern Rock before bailout | date=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He represented the FSA on the [[Basel Accord Implementation Group]] and chaired the FSA panel responsible for economic capital model review.&lt;ref name="Business and Leadership"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessandleadership.com/appointments/336/matthew-elderfield-central-bank/|title=Appointments:Matthew Elderfield, Central Bank|publisher=www.businessandleadership.com''|date=20 October 2009|accessdate=19 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418064252/http://www.businessandleadership.com/appointments/336/matthew-elderfield-central-bank|archivedate=18 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before joining the FSA, Elderfield established the European operation of the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] (ISDA) and held position at the [[London Investment Banking Association]], the [[British Bankers Association]] and a Washington DC-based consultancy firm, the [[Institute for Strategy Development]].&lt;ref name = "Business and Leadership" /&gt;

Elderfield earned an annual salary of €340,000 a year at the Central Bank of Ireland compared to a salary of $730,000 (€533,000) in Bermuda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2010/0319/1224266592086.html|title=Unenviable task in taming the banks|publisher=''[[Irish Times]]''|author= Simon Carswell|date=19 March 2010|accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was said to be at his desk from 7.30am to 7pm on weekdays while working a half-day on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/old-practices-at-central-bank-are-holding-back-new-ireland-2634785.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appointment as financial regulator in Ireland==
Elderfield was appointed in October 2009 by the Governor of the Central Bank, [[Patrick Honohan]]. He succeeded Patrick Neary, who retired early over the handling of the regulator's investigation into the €87 million in [[Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy|secret directors' loans]] at [[Anglo Irish Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0109/financial-business.html|title= Neary to retire as Regulator|publisher= ''[[RTÉ]]''|date= 09/01/2009|accessdate= 20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]], [[Brian Lenihan Jnr|Brian Lenihan]] welcomed his appointment, saying: ''"The appointment of Mr Elderfield, particularly given his extensive international regulatory experience, is a key step in the restructuring of financial services regulation in Ireland."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/central-bank-appoints-englishman-to-top-job-1918323.html|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''|title=Central Bank appoints Englishman to top job|author=Charlie Weston|date=20 October 2009|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took up his position in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialregulator.ie/press-area/press-releases/Pages/NewChiefExecutive-FinancialRegulator.aspx|title=New Chief Executive – Financial Regulator|publisher=''Financial Regulator''|date=04/01/2010|accessdate=19 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101043433/http://www.financialregulator.ie/press-area/press-releases/Pages/NewChiefExecutive-FinancialRegulator.aspx|archivedate=1 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been tasked with the rebuilding of the financial regulators function and restoring its reputation, overseeing the recapitalisation of the banks, helping to wean them off the funding support of Government guarantees, match Ireland's regulatory changes with the raft of measures coming internationally, and strike a measured balance in his approach to maintain a competitive position for the Irish financial services sector at a global level. Mr Elderfield said he intended to pursue a policy of 'assertive' regulation, backed up by the credible threat of enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0311/banks-business.html|title=Bank watchdog pledges tough approach|publisher=''[[RTÉ]]''|date=11/03/2010|accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Irish Times]] poll suggests that he is meeting success in restoring credibility to the Financial Regulators office with 68% responding positively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/polls/index.cfm?fuseaction=yesnopoll&amp;pollid=9316|title=Has Matthew Elderfield restored the credibility of the Financial Regulator's office?|accessdate= 19 April 2010 | work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010 he said that there was "critical absence of intellectual firepower within his staff''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/regulator-lacking-toplevel-graduates-2142595.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Regulator lacking top-level graduates | date=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable decisions made===

====Capital requirements for banks====
Following the transfer of loans to [[National Asset Management Agency|NAMA]] at the end of March 2010, the regulator's office announced under the Government's guarantee scheme must now meet a core equity ratio of 8 per cent by the end of 2010. This is to ensure that they can withstand future losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0330/breaking15.html|publisher= ''[[Irish Times]]''|author=Eoin Burke-Kennedy|title=Irish banks may require up to €32 billion to cover losses|date=30 March 2010|accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Appointment of administrator to Quinn Insurance====
On 30 March 2010, following an application by the Financial Regulator's office, the High Court appointed joint provisional administrators to Quinn Insurance Limited, part of the [[Quinn Group]] of companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialregulator.ie/press-area/press-releases/Pages/StatementonQuinnInsurance.aspx|title=Statement on Quinn Insurance|publisher=''Financial Regulator''|date=30 March 2010|accessdate=19 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618193634/http://www.financialregulator.ie/press-area/press-releases/pages/statementonquinninsurance.aspx|archivedate=18 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Irish Independent]], eight subsidiaries of Quinn Insurance provided guarantees of €1.2bn to cover Quinn Group's debts, prompting the regulator to seek the appointment of provisional administrators in the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/industry-captainrsquos-illfated-voyage-on-the-sinking-ship-2124899.html|title=Industry captain's ill-fated voyage on the sinking ship|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''|author= Maeve Sheehan|date=4 April 2010|accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quinn Group took action to counter the moves by the Financial Regulator, mobilising its employees into street protests, financial discussions with its creditors, in an effort to seek a resolution to the uncertainty created by the appointment of provisional administrators to Quinn Insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quinn-group.com/latest/latestdetail.cfm/news/55/Statement_from_QUINN-group_-_adjournment_of_hearing.htm|title=Statement from QUINN-group – adjournment of hearing|publisher=''[[Quinn Group]]''|date=12/04/2010|accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 April 2010, the Irish Times reported that Quinn Insurance decided not to fight the appointment of a permanent administrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0415/breaking39.html|title=Quinn to 'accept administration'|publisher=''[[Irish Times]]''|author=Ciara O'Brien|date=15 April 2010|accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was following a direct challenge by Elderfield to the groups owner, Irelands former richest man, [[Sean Quinn]], to "Show me the money" that would have solved the financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/watchdog-tells-quinn-show-me-the-money-2138617.html|title=Watchdog tells Quinn: Show me the money|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''|author=Emmet Oliver|date=15 April 2010|accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
He is a British citizen and is married. His interests are cycling, [[Leeds United]], music and lives in [[Sandymount]], Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/profile-2485710.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Profile | date=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1739">'''MicroVacuum''' Ltd. is a Hungarian biotechnology company based in [[Budapest]]. MicroVacuum is a global supplier of label-free [[biosensor]] systems for the [[Biology|life-science]] research market to provide real-time, label free detection and characterization of surface adsorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/events/conferences/international-conference-on-label-free-technologies/exhibitors-and-sponsors/microvacuum|title=MicroVacuum|publisher=Elsevier|access-date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MicroVacuum develops, manufactures, and markets the OWLS label-free, real-time biosensor system based on the grating coupler waveguide technology. The OW optical sensors and OWLS analytical system allow the determination of the affinity and kinetics of a wide variety of molecular interactions in real time, without the need for a molecular tag or label. 

Applications include protein quantification, classification of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, [[Drug test|drug screening]], and immunosensing. 

The main biosensing applications of the OWLS technology are as follows:

* Adsorption of proteins at surfaces
* Immunosensing
* Drug screening
* Ligand / receptor binding
* Kinetics of adhesion, growth and spreading of living cells
* Protein - [[lipid bilayer]] interactions
* Protein - DNA interactions
* Molecular [[self-assembly]] &amp; nanoscience
* Analysis of association and dissociation kinetics

Although strongly associated with Louisiana, particularly Avery Island and [[New Orleans]], McIlhenny was born in [[Houston, Texas]]. He joined Tabasco operations in 1967, serving over the years in many different departments of the company. He spearheaded the idea of selling Tabasco-branded items, such as T-shirts, watches, aprons, golf balls, salt shakers, and neckties. 

McIlhenny became president of McIlhenny Company in 1998 and remained in the post until 2012, when he stepped down to replace his late cousin, Edward "Ned" McIlhenny Simmons, as Chairman of the Board.  McIlhenny retained the office of CEO, however, while another cousin, Tony Simmons, became president and COO.&lt;ref name="katc1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lead Changes for Tabasco, McIlhenny Company|url=http://www.katc.com/news/lead-changes-for-tabasco-c-mcilhenny-company/|publisher=KATC.com|accessdate=6 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709212841/http://www.katc.com/news/lead-changes-for-tabasco-c-mcilhenny-company/|archivedate=9 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wltx"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tabasco Maker, CEO Paul McIlhenny Dies|url=http://www.wltx.com/news/watercooler/article/223602/363/Tabasco-Maker-CEO-Paul-McIlhenny-Dies-|publisher=WLTX|accessdate=24 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130412042354/http://www.wltx.com/news/watercooler/article/223602/363/Tabasco-Maker-CEO-Paul-McIlhenny-Dies-|archivedate=12 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tabasco company CEO Paul McIlhenny dies at age 68|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/24/us-usa-tabasco-obituary-idUSBRE91N0AO20130224|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his leadership the business experienced several consecutive years of record growth in sales, earnings and dividends to family shareholders. 

McIlhenny died in New Orleans, Louisiana, on February 23, 2013.

The Bretton Woods II initiative works with very large, long-term asset holders to reduce their exposure to risk and volatility through strategic investments in social impact and development.&lt;ref name="nationswell.com"&gt;http://nationswell.com/progress-pledge-funds-social-good/&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative has three main components:

1) Participants dedicate a percentage of their assets to social impact investment and development finance.

2) These resources are focused on countries that adopt basic standards of accountability, transparency, and citizen engagement with the goal of encouraging better governance.

3) Participants support regulatory reforms developed by the G-8 Social Impact Investment Task Force and National Advisory Boards on Impact Investment. These changes eliminate red tape around impact investment and incentivize asset holders to direct resources toward projects that provide broader benefits to society.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;[http://www.newamerica.org/bretton-woods-ii Bretton Woods profile], newsamerica.org; accessed April 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Pension funds, charitable endowments, and sovereign wealth funds control over $25 trillion in assets worldwide. As investors, these groups share two key attributes: first, they have unusually long time horizons. Pension liabilities extend across decades, and endowments and sovereign wealth funds are often designed to operate in perpetuity. Second, the holdings of these investors span every region and sector. They are too big and too broadly diversified to hide from market volatility. When the world economy prospers, their assets grow. Conversely, when world markets falter, it undermines the ability of these investors to realize their long-term financial objectives.

Asset holders in these groups derive significant benefits from reductions in market volatility. However, despite the fact that large asset holders clearly benefit from reduced volatility and related improvements in the investment climate, they rarely use their assets to influence these variables. The core of the Bretton Woods II initiative is the reality that large, long-term asset holders can use their investment strategies to shape a landscape that will be more conducive to stability, prosperity, and sustainability.

==Supporters==
Dr. [[Tomicah Tillemann]], who previously served as Senior Advisor to [[Hillary Clinton]], [[John Kerry]], and [[Joe Biden]], directs the initiative from the [[New America Foundation]].  The Pledge has drawn support from a broad range of leaders and experts at organizations in civil society and the private sector including Bono's [[ONE Campaign]], the [[United Nations Foundation]], the [[Center for Global Development]], the [[Aspen Institute]], the [[State Department]], and the [[World Bank]].

==The Initiative==
The Bretton Woods II initiative brings together large asset holders around three goals designed to address this opportunity:

1) Investors dedicate at least 1% of their assets or profits to social impact investment, development finance, or civil society support.

2) These resources are focused on countries that adopt basic standards of governance, accountability, and citizen engagement. CalPERS, the largest non-federal pension fund in the United States, has pioneered similar guidelines. A version of these rules would be developed to serve the needs of a broader array of investors. This effort will create a multibillion-dollar incentive for good governance and citizen engagement grounded in successful principles in use by the Millennium Challenge Corporation.

3) Providing support for regulatory reforms developed by the G-8 Social Impact Investment Task Force and National Advisory Boards on Impact Investment. These changes will eliminate red tape around impact investment and incentivize asset holders to direct resources toward projects that provide broader benefits to society.

A large consortium of organizations working with the [[New America Foundation]] have joined the effort to build out the analytical case for impact investment, assess potential returns from different impact investment strategies, and develop metrics for gauging impact. The partners are working to demonstrate that asset holders have both a vested interest and a fiduciary obligation to pursue impact investments that reduce market volatility, improve governance, and advance [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="nationswell.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt;

'''What is ROE (Return on event) and how is it used.'''

'''Return on event''' (ROE) is a term used in [[event marketing]], compared to rate of return [[Rate of return|ROR]], also known as return on investment [[Return on investment|ROI]], which is the ratio of money gained or lost on an investment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.synection.net/PDF/Delivering%20Greater%20ROE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.executivetravelmagazine.com/articles/print/how-to-a-meetings-return-on-investment| title=How to a Meeting's Return on Investment| work=Executive Travel| author= Jeanne O'Brien Coffey | date=May–June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The initial value of an investment does not always have a clearly defined monetary value. In event marketing the purpose of an event can be awareness of a new product, trials, brand commitment, brand building, or combinations of these.
Similarly, the final value of an investment does not always have a clearly defined monetary value, but can add value to a brand instead of contributing to sales volume.

Calculating your return on event (ROE):
#Collect the number of people who has been directly in contact with your event (received a sample, recorded a song, had a picture taken etc. etc.)
#The amount of money invested by the client
#Collect the number of people who have been indirectly in contact with your event (bystanders, people who have passed and seen the event)
#Calculate your “price pr. contact” (separate for direct and indirect contacts) by dividing number of contacts by amount of money invested
#Record video footage or observe over a period of time, to analyze an estimate of the time period that people dwell at your event to find your dwell time.
Besides the clearly defined value above, an event can for example contribute in social media by gaining “likes” or followers on Facebook, Twitter, and similar, connecting to the existing “fans” and or followers on Facebook, Twitter, etc.
Return on event is also a valuable tool in the sales phase, and should be implemented before the event, to set goals and guidelines for the event. Event marketing companies can use return on event to analyze and present to the client, facts, estimated contacts, contact price etc., before the proposed event.
Return on event after the event will be clearly defined, and can be used by the client to show the impact of the event.

'''Richard Thurmond Chatham''' (August 16, 1896 – February 5, 1957), who usually went by Thurmond Chatham, was a member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], an [[industrialist]] and [[philanthropist]]. He represented North Carolina from 1949 to 1957.

==Early years==
Born in [[Elkin, North Carolina]], Chatham was the only son of Hugh Gwyn and Martha Lenoir Chatham. His grandfather was Alexander Chatham, founder of [[Chatham Manufacturing Company]]. Chatham was educated in the public schools and at [[Woodberry Forest School]] in [[Orange, Virginia]]. He attended the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] from 1915–1916 and [[Yale University]] from 1916–1917, but left college to enter the [[United States Navy]]. He served in the Navy until 1919.

==Career==
In July 1919, Chatham began working for his family's company, Chatham Manufacturing, which was the world's largest manufacturer of blankets. After serving as treasurer of the company, he became president in 1929 and chairman of the board of directors in 1945. During his presidency, the company experienced considerable growth.

He served from February 1942 to November 1945, as an officer on the [[USS Phoenix (CL-46)]] in the Southwest Pacific and Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.ncdcr.gov/cdm/ref/collection/p16062coll15/id/195&lt;/ref&gt; He was
decorated With the [[Bronze Star Medal]], the Secretary of the Navy's Commendation Medal, and the Royal [[Order of Orange-Nassau]] with Swords from the Dutch Government and earned the American Theater Ribbon, European Theater Ribbon, Asiatic Theater Ribbon with three battle stars, World War I Ribbon, and Victory Ribbon. He continued his service in the Naval Reserve, and
in 1950 was appointed a Captain.

===Political life===
With his only previous political experience as a county commissioner in [[Forsyth County, North Carolina]], Chatham was unsuccessful in his 1946 bid for the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] nomination for Congress. He was first elected in 1948 and re-elected three more times.

While in Congress, he was a member of the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]] and was an advocate of recognition of [[China]] and support for [[the Marshall Plan]].

Notably, he did not sign the [[Southern Manifesto]] in 1956. As a result, Chatham lost the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] primary to [[Ralph James Scott]].

===Later years===
Chatham was a trustee of the University of North Carolina and of Woodberry Forest School; president of the Winston-Salem Chamber of Commerce; and a member of the National Association of Wool Manufacturers, the American Legion, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. In 1948, he served on the North Carolina Board of Conservation and Development and was president of the North Carolina Dairymen's Association.

==Family life==
In 1919, Chatham married Lucy Hodgin Hanes (1895–1949), daughter of [[John Wesley Hanes I|John Wesley Hanes]]. The couple had two sons, Hugh Gwyn II and Richard Thurmond, Jr. After Lucy died, Chatham married Patricia Firestone Coyner in 1950. In 1951 the couple purchased and remodeled [[Prospect House (Washington, D.C.)|Prospect House]].&lt;ref name = nrhpinv&gt;{{Cite web | author= Heather Fearnbach| title=Thurmond and Lucy Chatham House | work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date =March 2014| url = http://www.hpo.ncdcr.gov/nr/FY1051.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate = 2014-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple had one son, Walter Firestone, born in 1952. Chatham died in [[Durham, North Carolina]] and was buried in the [[Salem Cemetery (Winston-Salem, North Carolina)|Salem Cemetery]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]. His estate was valued at almost $2,000,000, of which $250,000 was used to establish the Chatham Foundation, a charitable trust supporting education.

The [[Thurmond and Lucy Chatham House]] at Winston-Salem was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20140829.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=2012-08-29|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 8/18/14 through 8/23/14|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roberto Duailibi''' (born October 8, 1935 in [[Campo Grande, Brazil]]), is a Brazilian advertising executive.

== Biography ==

Graduated in [[advertising]] from Escola de Propaganda de São Paulo in 1956, Roberto Duailibi became a publicist. He initiated his career in advertising in 1952, at the [[Colgate-Palmolive]] company. From 1956, he worked as copywriter in advertising agencies such as CIN - Companhia de Incremento de Negócios (now [[Leo Burnett]] Publicidade Ltda), JWT, McCann Ericson and Standard Propaganda, where he was Creative vice-president.

In 1968, he joined José Zaragoza, Francesc Petit and Ronald Persichetti to create DPZ, one of the largest and most awarded advertising agencies in Brazil. He was awarded the "Advertiser of the Year" in 1969 in Prêmio Colunistas. &lt;br&gt;
In addition to the recognition and awards as advertising executive, Roberto Duailibi is a writer and professor . He was professor and course director at ESPM of São Paulo and is currently dean in the Institution Council. He was also Creative professor at ECA - [[Escola de Comunicações e Artes]] of USP - Universidade de São Paulo.&lt;br&gt; For two periods, he was [[chairman]] at ABAP, the Brazilian Association of Advertising Agencies. He is advisor of Fundação Bienal de São Paulo, Fundo Social de Solidariedade of the São Paulo State Government and Chairman at FUNCEB - Fundação Cultural Exército Brasileiro.

He wrote several books, among which is Criatividade &amp; [[Marketing]], with Harry Simonsen Jr.. This book showed the concept of the heuristic ruler and the importance to follow methods encouraging creativity across the company’s departments. In addition to Criatividade &amp; Marketing, he was very successful with his quote collections initially called Phrase Book. In 2005, he published Cartas a um Jovem Publicitário, a book directed to the young advertising professionals. In 2008, he published with Marina Pechlivanis the collection Idéias Poderosas, gathering thematic selections of [[quotation]]s in a pocket book. In the same year, he also launched the new edition of Criatividade &amp; Marketing, with a digital version of the Heuristic Ruler.

{{Admiralty law}}
The "'''Rotterdam Rules'''" (formally, the '''United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea''') is a treaty proposing new international rules to revise the legal framework for [[affreightment|maritime affreightment]] and [[Ship transport|carriage of goods by sea]]. The Rules primarily address the legal relationship between carriers and cargo-owners. As of October 2015, the Rules are not yet in force as they have been ratified by only three states.

The aim of the convention is to extend and modernize existing international rules and achieve uniformity of [[International trade law]] in the field of [[admiralty law|maritime]] carriage, updating or replacing many provisions in the [[Hague Rules]], [[Hague-Visby Rules]] and [[Hamburg Rules]].&lt;ref name=un/&gt;&lt;ref name=rotterdam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rotterdamrules2009.com/cms/index.php?page=general-information|title=Rotterdam Rules Signature Ceremony|author=Susan Husselman|work=Rotterdam Rules 2009 Secretariat|publisher=Rotterdam Rules 2009|accessdate=16 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention establishes a comprehensive, uniform legal regime governing the rights and obligations of [[Shipment|shippers]], [[Common carrier|carriers]] and [[consignee]]s under a contract for [[door-to-door]] shipments that involve international sea transport.&lt;ref name=un&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/transport_goods/2008rotterdam_rules.html|title=2008 – United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea – the 'Rotterdam Rules'|work=U.N. Commission on International Trade Law|publisher=UNCITRAL.org|accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Hague Rules of 1924 were updated in 1968 to become the Hague-Visby Rules, but the changes were modest. The modified convention still covered only "tackle to tackle" carriage contracts,  with no provision for multimodal transport. The industry-changing phenomenon of [[containerization]] was barely acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;Hague-Visby Rules: Article IV Rule 5c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jus.uio.no/lm/sea.carriage.hague.visby.rules.1968/doc.html#31 ''Hague-Visby Rules'']&lt;/ref&gt; The 1978 Hamburg Rules were introduced to provide a framework that was both more modern, and less biased in favour of ship operators. Although the Hamburg Rules were readily adopted by developing countries, the new convention was shunned by richer countries who stuck with Hague and  Hague-Visby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacksonparton.com ''The Jackson Parton Miscellany'']&lt;/ref&gt; It had been expected that a Hague/Hamburg compromise might arise, but instead the vast (96 articles) Rotterdam Rules appeared.

The final draft of the Rotterdam Rules, which was assembled by the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]], was adopted by the United Nations on 11 December 2008, and a signing ceremony was held in [[Rotterdam]] on 23 September 2009.&lt;ref name=rotterdam/&gt;&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{Citation|title=United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea|url=http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/transport/rotterdam_rules/09-85608_Ebook.pdf|year=2008|publisher=U.N. Commission for International Trade Law|accessdate=16 November 2009|edition=9|version=9|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124164131/http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/transport/rotterdam_rules/09-85608_Ebook.pdf|archivedate=24 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signatories included the United States, France, Greece, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands; in all, signatures were obtained from countries said to make up 25 percent of world trade by volume.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt; Signatures were allowed after the ceremony at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|U.N. Headquarters]] in New York City, United States.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

The [[World Shipping Council]] is a prominent supporter of the Rotterdam Rules. In 2010, the American Bar Association House of Delegates approved a resolution supporting U.S. ratification of the Rotterdam Rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joc.com/maritime/bar-association-endorses-rotterdam-rules ''Maritime Bar Association Endorses Rotterdam Rules'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/international_law/2010/09/rotterdam-rules.html ''Law Professors Address International Law'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main provisions==
The following are critical provisions and law changes found in the Rotterdam Rules:
* The Rules apply only if the carriage includes a sea leg; other multimodal carriage contracts which have no sea leg are outside of the scope of the Rules.
* It extends the period that carriers are responsible for goods, to cover the time between the point where the goods are received to the point where the goods are delivered.&lt;ref name=dynamic&gt;{{cite news|title=UN shipping convention ready for Australia|author=Adeline Teoh|newspaper=Dynamic Export|date=16 November 2009|url=http://www.dynamicexport.com.au/news/un-shipping-convention-ready-for-australia00799/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It allows for more [[e-commerce]] and approves more forms of electronic documentation.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt;
* It increases the limit liability of carriers to 875 units of account per shipping unit or three units of account per kilogram of gross weight.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt;
* It eliminates the "nautical fault defence" which had protected carriers and crew from liability for [[negligent]] ship management and navigation.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt;
* It extends the time that legal claims can be filed to two years following the day the goods were delivered or should have been delivered.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt;
* It allows parties to so-called "Volume Contracts" to [[opt-out]] of some liability rules set in the convention.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt;
* It obliges carriers to keep ships seaworthy and properly crewed throughout the voyage.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt; The standard of care is not "strict", but "due diligence" (as with the Hague Rules).

==Entry into force and ratifications==
The Rotterdam Rules will enter into effect a year after 20 countries have ratified that treaty.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"&gt;[http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/transport_goods/rotterdam_status.html ''U.N. Transport Treaty'']&lt;/ref&gt; As of 9 August 2011, there were 24 signatories to the treaty.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"/&gt; The most recent country to sign the treaty was Sweden, which signed on 20 July 2011.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"/&gt; Spain was the first country to ratify the convention in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2011/unisl149.html ''U.N. Press Release 2011'']&lt;/ref&gt; An overview of signatures and ratifications is shown below:

Upon entry into force of the convention for a country, it should denounce the conventions governing the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] as well as the [[Hamburg Rules]] as the convention does not come into effect without such denouncements.
