An '''[[actin]] nucleation core''' is a [[protein trimer]] with three actin [[monomer]]s.  It is called a nucleation core because it leads to the energetically favorable elongation reaction once a [[tetramer]] is formed from a trimer.  Actin [[protein dimer]]s and trimers are energetically unfavorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1074/jbc.M112.406744|pmid=23148219|pmc = 3537046|year=2013|last1=Liu|first1=S.

'''Albone Glacier''' ({{coord|64|13|S|59|42|W|type:glacier_region:AQ|display=inline,title}}) is a deeply entrenched narrow [[glacier]] on the east side of [[Wolseley Buttress]] flowing southward from [[Detroit Plateau]] on [[Nordenskjöld Coast]] in [[Graham Land]], [[Antarctica]]. It was mapped by the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey]] from surveys (1960&amp;ndash;61) and was named by the [[United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee]] for [[Dan Albone]], English designer of the Ivel tractor, the first successful [[tractor]] with an internal combustion engine.

A '''Bracewell probe''' is a hypothetical concept for an autonomous [[interstellar probe|interstellar]] [[space probe]] dispatched for the express purpose of [[interstellar communication|communication]] with one or more alien civilizations. It was proposed by [[Ronald N. Bracewell]] in a 1960 paper, as an alternative to interstellar radio communication between widely separated civilizations.

== Description ==
A Bracewell probe would be constructed as an autonomous [[Robotics|robotic]] [[interstellar probe|interstellar]] [[space probe]] with a high level of [[artificial intelligence]], and all relevant information that its home civilization might wish to communicate to another culture. It would seek out technological civilizations—or alternatively monitor worlds where there is a likelihood of technological civilizations arising—and communicate over "short" distances (compared to the interstellar distances between inhabited worlds) once it discovered a civilization that meets its contact criteria. It would make its presence known, carry out a dialogue with the contacted culture, and presumably communicate the results of its encounter to its place of origin. In essence, such probes would act as an autonomous local representative of their home civilization and would act as the point of contact between the cultures.

Since a Bracewell probe can communicate much faster, over shorter distances, and over large spans of time, it can communicate with alien cultures more efficiently than radio message exchange might. The disadvantage to this approach is that such probes cannot communicate anything not in their data storage, nor can their contact criteria or policies for communication be quickly updated by their "base of operations".

While a Bracewell probe need not be a [[von Neumann probe]] as well, the two concepts are compatible, and a self-replicating device as proposed by von Neumann would greatly speed up a Bracewell probe's search for alien civilizations.

It is also possible that such a probe (or system of probes if launched as a von Neumann-Bracewell probe) may outlive the civilization which created and launched it. 

There have been some efforts under the [[Xenoarchaeology|SETA and SETV]] projects{{what?|date=August 2014}} to detect evidence for the visitation of the [[Solar System]] by such hypothetical probes, and to signal or activate such an alleged probe that may be lying dormant in local space{{dubious|date=August 2014}}{{fact|date=August 2014}}.  Variations in the echo delay times of radio transmissions, known as [[long delayed echo]]es, or LDEs, have also been interpreted in Professor Bracewell's 1960 paper as evidence for such probes.{{dubious|date=August 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lunan|first1=Duncan|title=Space Probe from Epsilon Boötis?|journal=Analog|issue=January 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lunan|first1=Duncan|title=Duncan Lunan: Epsilon Boötis|url=http://www.duncanlunan.com/epsilonbootis.asp|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[near-earth object]] [[1991 VG]] was initially suggested as a candidate for a Bracewell probe due to its unusual characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;

== Fictional examples ==
* In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[The Fountains of Paradise]]'' the extraterrestrial Starglider probe is an example of a Bracewell probe. In Clarke's story ''[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]'', later adapted into the movie ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', the 'Monolith' appears to be a Bracewell probe placed on the moon to ensure that only a civilization capable of spaceflight would be able to discover it.
* ''[[Alien Planet]]'' is a 94-minute special which aired on the [[Discovery Channel]] in 2005 about two internationally-built robot probes, and their mothership, searching for alien life on the fictional planet Darwin IV.
* Bracewell probes are featured in [[David Brin]]'s 2012 novel ''Existence''.
* In ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', a Voyager-class probe was upgraded and repurposed by an alien civilization. It acquired so much information, it became conscious and returned "home" to share what it learned
* In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[The Inner Light (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Inner Light]]", a Bracewell probe{{dubious|date=August 2014}} transmits details of an extinct civilization to Captain Picard.{{CN|date=August 2014}}
* In the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' episode "[[Friendship One (Star Trek: Voyager)|Friendship One]]", the crew is tasked with recovering a Bracewell probe that humans launched and find it on a planet whose inhabitants used the knowledge they obtained from it with disastrous results.
* An alien probe contacts the space station [[Babylon 5 (space station)|Babylon 5]] in the season 3 episode "[[A Day in the Strife]]". The probe is a Bracewell probe, asking a series of questions and offering new technologies, medicine and science in return for answers to said questions. However, if the probe receives correct answers—thus proving that whatever civilization the probe has come into contact with is advanced — the probe detonates with a yield of 500 megatons, removing said civilization's homeworld or facility. This makes it more of a [[Berserker probe#Berserkers|berserker probe]].
* The Snark, an alien probe that visits Earth in the novel ''[[In the Ocean of Night]]'' (1977) by [[Gregory Benford]].
* Bracewell probes in the [[role-playing game]] ''[[Eclipse Phase (role-playing game)|Eclipse Phase]]'' infect the [[recursive self-improvement|seed AIs]] created by humanity with a deadly [[computer virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode ''[[Victory of the Daleks]]'', the [[Daleks]] create a Bracewell probe in the form of a convincingly-human android (appropriately named Bracewell) and covertly send it to Earth during [[World War II]] in order to communicate a false cover story to humans that disguises the Daleks' own arrival.

'''Cape Disappointment State Park''' (formerly, Fort Canby State Park) is a public recreation area located southwest of [[Ilwaco, Washington]], on the bottom end of [[Long Beach Peninsula]], the northern headlands where the [[Columbia River]] meets the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The [[state park]]'s {{convert|2023|acre}} encompass a diverse landscape of  [[old-growth forest]], freshwater lakes, freshwater and saltwater marshes, and oceanside [[tidelands]]. Park sights include the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center, [[North Head Light]]house, and [[Cape Disappointment Lighthouse]].&lt;ref name=wasp/&gt; Cape Disappointment is one of several state parks and sites in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]] that make up the [[Lewis and Clark National and State Historical Parks]].&lt;ref name=nps/&gt;

==History==
Cape Disappointment earned its name when Captain [[John Meares]] failed to cross the river bar in 1788. The feat was accomplished in 1792 by American Captain [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]]. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] arrived at Cape Disappointment in 1805.&lt;ref name=wasp/&gt;

In 1862, during the [[American Civil War]], a camp called Post at Cape Disappointment was established and fortifications existed here from that date to protect the northern approaches to the mouth of the [[Columbia River]] from possible attacks by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] raiders or foreign fleets. It was garrisoned by Company A, [[U.S. 9th Infantry Regiment]] and Company A, [[8th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry]] in the [[District of Oregon]]. In 1863, its mate [[Fort Stevens (Oregon)|Fort Stevens]] was established on the south bank of the [[Columbia River]]. In 1864, the post was renamed Fort Cape Disappointment. Some Civil War-era fortifications still exist: the Tower (or Right) Battery, Left Battery, and Center Battery.

Fort Cape Disappointment was expanded and renamed Fort Canby in 1875. By 1906, when construction finished under the [[Board of Fortifications|Endicott program]], Fort Canby became part of the three-fort [[Harbor Defense Command|Harbor Defenses of the Columbia River]] as a subpost of [[Fort Stevens (Oregon)|Fort Stevens]] along with [[Fort Columbia State Park|Fort Columbia]].&lt;ref name=studygroup/&gt; The fort was further expanded during [[World War II]]. After being decommissioned in the years following World War II, the fort was turned over to the state for use as a state park in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt; Workers with the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] helped restore the fort and improved roads and trails during the 1930s.&lt;ref name=wasp/&gt;

==Facilities==
[[File:Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center Cape Disappointment.jpg|thumb|Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center]]
The Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center sits on a cliff that overlooks the confluence of the [[Columbia River]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. There are exhibits about the 1803–1806 [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] from [[St. Louis, Missouri]] to the Pacific coast, the park's later history, including the lighthouses, [[U.S. Coast Guard]] and military activities, and the area's maritime and natural history.&lt;ref name=wasp2/&gt;

==Activities and amenities==
Cape Disappointment State Park offers camping and other overnight accommodations, {{convert|8|mi|spell=in}} of hiking trails, watercraft launch sites, picnicking facilities, and tours of the [[North Head Light]]house.&lt;ref name=wasp/&gt;

A '''cattle creep''' is a small, field-to-field access for [[livestock|farm animals]], usually to allow passage beneath an obstacle such as a [[road]], [[canal]], or [[railway]] [[embankment (transportation)|embankment]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adoptafarm.com/dictionary/index.cfm?letter=C&lt;/ref&gt;

As they are intended primarily for [[cattle]] or other livestock, cattle creeps usually have a low head height and are uncomfortable for humans to use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leamarsh.com/creep.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Dartmoor]], in south west England, the term '''sheep creep''' is used to describe a purposely constructed gap in the base of a [[drystone wall]], commonly topped with a granite lintel. The gap allows sheep to pass from field to field, but is deliberately too small for cattle or ponies. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/sheep_moor.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8796">'''Constructor theory''' is a proposal for a new mode of explanation in fundamental physics, first sketched out by [[David Deutsch]], a [[Quantum mechanics|quantum physicist]] at the [[University of Oxford]], in 2012.&lt;ref name="Heaven-06112012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22469-theory-of-everything-says-universe-is-a-transformer.html |last=Heaven |first=Douglas |title=Theory of everything says universe is a transformer |publisher=Reed Business Information |website=New Scientist |date=6 November 2012 |accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merali-26052014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merali|first1=Zeeya|title=A Meta-Law to Rule Them All: Physicists Devise a "Theory of Everything"|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-meta-law-to-rule-them-all-physicists-devise-a-theory-of-everything/|website=Scientific American|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|date=26 May 2014|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructor theory expresses physical laws exclusively in terms of what physical transformations, or tasks, are possible versus which are impossible, and why. By allowing such [[counterfactual]] statements into fundamental physics, it allows new physical laws to be expressed, for instance those of the constructor theory of information.&lt;ref name="PRC17122014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ns24052014"/&gt;

==Overview==
The fundamental elements of the theory are tasks, i.e., the abstract specifications of transformations in terms of input/output pairs of attributes. A task is impossible if there is a law of physics that forbids its being performed with arbitrarily high accuracy, and possible otherwise. When it is possible, then a ''constructor'' for it can be built, again with arbitrary accuracy and reliability. A constructor is an entity which can cause the task to occur while retaining the ability to cause it again. Examples of constructors include a [[heat engine]] (a thermodynamic constructor), a [[Catalysis|catalyst]] (a chemical constructor) or a [[computer program]] controlling an [[Automation|automated]] factory (an example of a programmable constructor).&lt;ref name="PRC17122014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ns24052014"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Deutsch |first1=D.  |last2=Marletto |first2= C. |title=Why we need to reconstruct the universe |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=24 May 2014 |pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory was developed by physicists David Deutsch and [[Chiara Marletto]].&lt;ref name="ns24052014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edge.org/conversation/constructor-theory |title=CONSTRUCTOR THEORY: A Conversation with David Deutsch |publisher=Edge |date=22 October 2012 |accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It draws together ideas from diverse areas including [[thermodynamics]], [[statistical mechanics]], [[information theory]] and [[quantum computation]].

Quantum mechanics and all other physical theories are claimed to be ''subsidiary'' theories, and quantum information becomes a special case of ''[[superinformation]]''.&lt;ref name="ns24052014"/&gt;

Chiara Marletto's ''constructor theory of life'' builds on constructor theory.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/104/20141226 |title=Constructor Theory of Life |journal= Royal Society Interface |volume=12 |issue=104 |date=14 January 2015 |doi= 10.1098/rsif.2014.1226 |arxiv= 1407.0681 |author= Marletto C. |accessdate= 11 January 2016 |pages=20141226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aeon16072015"&gt;{{cite web |last= Marletto |first=Chiara |url= https://aeon.co/essays/how-constructor-theory-solves-the-riddle-of-life |title=Life without design |work=Aeon |publisher=Aeon Media Pty Ltd. |date= 2015-07-16 |accessdate= 2016-05-23 |quote= Constructor theory is a new vision of physics, but it helps to answer a very old question: why is life possible at all? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations==
According to Deutsch, current theories of physics based on [[quantum mechanics]] do not adequately explain why some transformations between states of being are possible and some are not. For example, a drop of dye can dissolve in water but [[thermodynamics]] shows that the reverse transformation, of the dye clumping back together, is effectively impossible.
We do not know at a quantum level why this should be so.&lt;ref name="Heaven-06112012" /&gt; Constructor theory provides an explanatory framework built on the transformations themselves, rather than the components.&lt;ref name="PRC17122014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=D.|last2=Marletto|first2=C.|title=Constructor theory of information|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A|date=17 December 2014|volume=471|issue=2174|pages=20140540|doi=10.1098/rspa.2014.0540|arxiv=1405.5563|bibcode=2014RSPSA.47140540D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ns24052014"/&gt;

Information has the property that a given statement might have said something else, and one of these alternatives would not be true. The untrue alternative is said to be "[[counterfactual]]". Conventional physical theories do not model such counterfactuals. However the link between information and such physical ideas as the [[entropy]] in a thermodynamic system is so strong that they are sometimes identified. For example, the area of a [[black hole]]'s [[event horizon]] is a measure both of the hole's entropy and of the information it contains. Constructor theory is an attempt to bridge this gap, providing a physical model which can express counterfactuals, thus allowing the laws of information and computation to be viewed as laws of physics.&lt;ref name="PRC17122014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ns24052014"/&gt;

==Outline==
In constructor theory, a transformation or change is described as a ''task''. A ''constructor'' is a physical entity which is able to carry out a given task repeatedly. A task is only possible if a constructor capable of carrying it out exists, otherwise it is impossible. To work with constructor theory everything is expressed in terms of tasks. The properties of information are then expressed as relationships between possible and impossible tasks. Counterfactuals are thus fundamental statements and the properties of information may be described by physical laws.&lt;ref name="ns24052014"/&gt;
If a system has a set of attributes, the set of permutations of these attributes is seen as a set of tasks. A ''computation medium'' is a system whose attributes permute to always produce a possible task. The set of permutations, and hence of tasks, is a ''computation set''. If it is possible to copy the attributes in the computation set, the computation medium is also an ''information medium''.

Information, or a given task, does not rely on a specific constructor. Any suitable constructor will serve. This ability of information to be carried on different physical systems or media is described as ''interoperability'', and arises as the principle that the combination of two information media is also an information medium.&lt;ref name="ns24052014"/&gt;
Media capable of carrying out quantum computations are called ''superinformation media'', and are characterised by specific properties. Broadly, certain copying tasks on their states are impossible tasks. This is claimed to give rise to all the known differences between quantum and classical information.&lt;ref name="ns24052014"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14793">A '''discrete-event simulation''' ('''DES''') models the operation of a [[system]] as a [[discrete time|discrete]] [[sequence of events]] in time. Each event occurs at a particular instant in time and marks a change of [[State (computer science)|state]] in the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''Simulation – The practice of model development and use''|author=Stewart Robinson|publisher=Wiley|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between consecutive events, no change in the system is assumed to occur; thus the [[simulation]] can directly jump in time from one event to the next.

This contrasts with [[continuous simulation]] in which the simulation continuously tracks the system dynamics over time. Instead of being [[Event-driven programming|event-based]], this is called an activity-based simulation; time is broken up into small time slices and the system state is updated according to the set of activities happening in the time slice.&lt;ref name="matloff"&gt;{{cite web|last=Matloff|first=Norm|title=Introduction to Discrete-Event Simulation and the SimPy Language|url=http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/156/PLN/DESimIntro.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because discrete-event simulations do not have to simulate every time slice, they can typically run much faster than the corresponding continuous simulation.

A more recent method is the three-phased approach to discrete event simulation (Pidd, 1998). In this approach, the first phase is to jump to the next chronological event. The second phase is to execute all events that unconditionally occur at that time (these are called B-events). The third phase is to execute all events that conditionally occur at that time (these are called C-events). The three phase approach is a refinement of the event-based approach in which simultaneous events are ordered so as to make the most efficient use of computer resources.  The three-phase approach is used by a number of commercial simulation software packages, but from the user's point of view, the specifics of the underlying simulation method are generally hidden.

== Example ==
A common exercise in learning how to build discrete-event simulations is to model a [[Queueing theory|queue]], such as customers arriving at a bank to be served by a teller.  In this example, the system entities are '''Customer-queue''' and '''Tellers'''.  The system events are '''Customer-Arrival''' and '''Customer-Departure'''.  (The event of '''Teller-Begins-Service''' can be part of the logic of the arrival and departure events.) The system states, which are changed by these events, are '''Number-of-Customers-in-the-Queue''' (an integer from 0 to n) and '''Teller-Status''' (busy or idle).   The [[random variable]]s that need to be characterized to model this system [[stochastic]]ally are '''Customer-Interarrival-Time''' and '''Teller-Service-Time'''. An agent-based framework for performance modeling of an optimistic parallel discrete event simulator is another example for a discrete event simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Aditya Kurve |author2=Khashayar Kotobi |author3=George Kesidis |title=An agent-based framework for performance modeling of an optimistic parallel discrete event simulator |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2194-3206-1-12 | doi=10.1186/2194-3206-1-12 |volume=1 |journal=Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling |pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
In addition to the logic of what happens when system events occur, discrete event simulations include the following:

===State===

A system state is a set of variables that captures the salient properties of the system to be studied. The state trajectory over time S(t) can be mathematically represented by a [[step function]] whose value can change whenever an event occurs.

===Clock===

The simulation must keep track of the current simulation time, in whatever measurement units are suitable for the system being modeled. In discrete-event simulations, as opposed to continuous simulations, time 'hops' because events are instantaneous – the clock skips to the next event start time as the simulation proceeds.

===Events list===

The simulation maintains at least one list of simulation events.  This is sometimes called the ''pending event set''
because it lists events that are pending as a result of previously simulated event but have yet to be simulated themselves.
An event is described by the time at which it occurs and a type, indicating the
code that will be used to simulate that event.  It is common for the event code to be parametrized, in which case, the event description also contains parameters to the event code.

When events are instantaneous, activities that extend over time are modeled as sequences of events.  Some simulation frameworks allow the time of an event to be specified as an interval, giving the start time and the end time of each event.

[[Single-threaded]] simulation engines based on instantaneous events have just one current event.  In contrast, [[Thread (computing)|multi-threaded]] simulation engines and simulation engines supporting an interval-based event model may have multiple current events.  In both cases, there are significant problems with synchronization between current events.

The pending event set is typically organized as a [[priority queue]], [[Sorting|sorted]] by event time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas W. Jones]], ed.  [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=318242.318467 Implementations of Time], Proceedings of the 18th Winter Simulation Conference, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, regardless of the order in which events are added to the event set, they are removed in strictly chronological order.  Various priority queue implementations have been studied in the context of discrete event simulation&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas W. Jones]], [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/5684.5686 Empirical Comparison of Priority Queue and Event Set Implementations], ''Communications of the ACM, 29,'' April 1986, pages 300–311.&lt;/ref&gt;; alternatives studied have included [[splay tree]]s, [[skip list]]s, [[calendar queue]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Kah Leong Tan and Li-Jin Thng, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=510378.510453 SNOOPy Calendar Queue], Proceedings of the 32nd Winter Simulation Conference, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and ladder queues.
&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dickman, Sounak Gupta and Philip A. Wilsey, [https://doi.org/10.1145/2486092.2486106 Event pool structures for PDES on many-core Beowulf clusters], Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGSIM conference on Principles of advanced discrete simulation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelo Furfaro and Ludovica Sacco, [https://doi.org/10.1145/3200921.3200925 Adaptive Ladder Queue: Achieving O(1) Amortized Access Time in Practice], Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSIM conference on Principles of advanced discrete simulation&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, events are scheduled dynamically as the simulation proceeds. For example, in the bank example noted above, the event CUSTOMER-ARRIVAL at time t would, if the CUSTOMER_QUEUE was empty and TELLER was idle, include the creation of the subsequent event CUSTOMER-DEPARTURE to occur at time t+s, where s is a number generated from the SERVICE-TIME distribution.

===Random-number generators===

The simulation needs to generate [[random variables]] of various kinds, depending on the system model. This is accomplished by one or more [[Pseudorandom number generator]]s. The use of pseudo-random numbers as opposed to true random numbers is a benefit should a simulation need a rerun with exactly the same behavior.

One of the problems with the random number distributions used in discrete-event simulation is that the steady-state distributions of event times may not be known in advance.  As a result, the initial set of events placed into the pending event set will not have arrival times representative of the steady-state distribution.  This problem is typically solved by bootstrapping the simulation model.  Only a limited effort is made to assign realistic times to the initial set of pending events.  These events, however, schedule additional events, and with time, the distribution of event times approaches its steady state.  This is called ''bootstrapping'' the simulation model.  In gathering statistics from the running model, it is important to either disregard events that occur before the steady state is reached or to run the simulation for long enough that the bootstrapping behavior is overwhelmed by steady-state behavior.  (This use of the term ''bootstrapping'' can be contrasted with its use in both [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|statistics]] and [[Bootstrapping (computing)|computing]]).

===Statistics===

The simulation typically keeps track of the system's [[statistic]]s, which quantify the aspects of interest. In the bank example, it is of interest to track the mean waiting times. In a simulation model, performance metrics are not analytically derived from [[probability distributions]], but rather as averages over [[replication (statistics)|replication]]s, that is different runs of the model. [[Confidence interval]]s are usually constructed to help assess the quality of the output.

===Ending condition===

Because events are bootstrapped, theoretically a discrete-event simulation could run forever. So the simulation designer must decide when the simulation will end.  Typical choices are "at time t" or "after processing n number of events" or, more generally, "when statistical measure X reaches the value x".

==Simulation engine logic==

The main loop of a discrete-event simulation is something like this:

===Start===
* Initialize Ending Condition to FALSE.
* Initialize system state variables.
* Initialize Clock (usually starts at simulation time zero).
* Schedule an initial event (i.e., put some initial event into the Events List).

=== “Do loop” or “while loop”===
While (Ending Condition is FALSE) then do the following:
* Set clock to next event time.
* Do next event and remove from the Events List.
* Update statistics.

===End===
* Generate statistical report.

== Common uses ==

===Diagnosing process issues===
Simulation approaches are particularly well equipped to help users diagnose issues in complex environments.  [[The Goal]] ([[Theory of Constraints]]) illustrates the importance of understanding bottlenecks in a system.  Only process ‘improvements’ at the bottlenecks will actually improve the overall system.  In many organizations bottlenecks become hidden by excess inventory, [[overproduction]], variability in processes and variability in routing or sequencing.  By accurately documenting the system inside a simulation model it is possible to gain a bird’s eye view of the entire system.

A working model of a system allows management to understand performance drivers.  A simulation can be built to include any number of [[performance indicator]]s such as worker utilization, on-time delivery rate, scrap rate, cash cycles, and so on.

===Hospital applications===
An operating theater is generally shared between several surgical disciplines.  Through better understanding the nature of these procedures it may be possible to increase the patient throughput.
Example:  If a heart surgery takes on average four hours, changing an operating room schedule from eight available hours to nine will not increase patient throughput.  On the other hand, if a hernia procedure takes on average twenty minutes providing an extra hour may also not yield any increased throughput if the capacity and average time spent in the recovery room is not considered.

===Lab test performance improvement ideas===
Many systems improvement ideas are built on sound principles, proven methodologies ([[Lean manufacturing|Lean]], [[Six Sigma]], [[Total quality management|TQM]], etc.) yet fail to improve the overall system.  A simulation model allows the user to understand and test a performance improvement idea in the context of the overall system.

===Evaluating capital investment decisions===
:''See also: [[Monte Carlo methods in finance]]; [[Corporate finance#Capital investment decisions|Corporate finance #Capital investment decisions]] and [[Corporate finance#Quantifying uncertainty|#Quantifying uncertainty]].''

Simulation modeling is commonly used to model potential investments.  Through modeling investments decision-makers can make informed decisions and evaluate potential alternatives.

===Network simulators===

:''This article discusses categorisations of organisms. For a different meaning in biology, see [[cell division]].''

'''Division''' is a [[taxonomic rank]] in [[biological classification]] that is used differently in zoology and in botany.

In [[botany]] and [[mycology]], ''division'' refers to a rank equivalent to [[phylum]]. The use of either term is allowed under the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]],&lt;ref name="ICN"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2012 |editor-last=McNeill |editor-first=J. |displayeditors=etal|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code), Adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |edition=electronic |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art3 |accessdate=2017-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and both are commonly used in scientific literature.

The main Divisions of land plants, in the order in which they probably evolved, are the [[Marchantiophyta]] (liverworts),  [[Anthocerotophyta]] (hornworts), [[Moss|Bryophyta]] (mosses), [[Filicophyta]] (ferns), [[Sphenophyta]] (horsetails), [[Cycadophyta]] (cycads), [[Ginkgophyta]] (ginkgo)s, [[Pinophyta]] (conifers), [[Gnetophyta]] (gnetophytes), and the [[Magnoliophyta]] (Angiosperms, flowering plants). The flowering plants now dominate terrestrial [[ecosystem]]s, comprising 80% of [[vascular plant]] species.

In [[zoology]], the term ''division'' is applied to an optional rank subordinate to the [[infraclass]] and superordinate to the [[cohort (taxonomy)|cohort]]. A widely used classification (e.g. Carroll 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Carroll 1988|ref=Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt;) recognises [[teleost]] fishes as a Division Teleostei within Class [[Actinopterygii]] (the ray-finned fishes). Less commonly (as in Milner 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{harv| Milner 1988|ref=Milner}}&lt;/ref&gt;), living [[tetrapods]] are ranked as Divisions [[Amphibia]] and [[Amniota]] within the [[clade]] of vertebrates with fleshy limbs ([[Sarcopterygii]]).

'''Explorer 36''' (also called '''GEOS 2''' or '''GEOS B''', acronym to '''Geodetic Earth Orbiting Satellite''') was a [[U.S.]] [[satellite]] launched as part of the [[Explorers program]], being the second of the two satellites '''GEOS'''. Explorer 36 was launched on January 11, 1968 from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], with [[Delta rocket]].

Explorer 36 was a gravity-gradient-stabilized, [[solar cell]] powered spacecraft that carried electronic and [[Geodesy|geodetic]] instrumentation. The geodetic instrumentation systems included:

* Optical Beacon System
* [[Radio]] [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] System
* SECOR Range [[Transponder]]
* Radio Range/Rate System
* C-Band [[Radar]] Transponder
* [[NASA]] Minitrack System
* Precipitating Electron Detector
* [[Magnetometer]]
* [[Laser]] Tracking Reflector

Non-geodetic systems included a laser detector and a Minitrack [[interferometer]] beacon. The objectives of the spacecraft were to optimize optical station visibility periods and to provide complementary data for inclination-dependent terms established by the [[Explorer 29]] ('''GEOS 1''') [[gravimetric]] studies. The spacecraft was placed into a [[retrograde orbit]] to accomplish these objectives. Operational problems occurred in the main power system, optical beacon flash system, and the spacecraft clock, and adjustments in scheduling resulted in nominal operations.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="962">An '''extension agency''' is an organisation that practises [[Extension (semantics)|extension]], in the context of [[community development]]. An example is the ''[[Cooperative Extension Service]]'', which aims to assist individuals or groups in defining and achieving their goals in rural communities in the USA.
 
'''Extension agents''' are trained in the skills of extension, such as communication and group facilitation, and usually in technical areas of the sector they serve (for example agriculture, health, or safety). [[Agricultural extension]] agencies promote more profitable and sustainable farming, while '''health extension''' agencies promote improved health. 

Extension agents are represented by '''professional organisations''' such as the [http://www.apen.org.au/ Australasia-Pacific Extension Network] and publish in journals such as the [http://www.joe.org/ Journal of Extension].

'''Francesco Spighi''' (18th century) was a Florentine artisan active in the late eighteenth century.

All we know about him is that he worked for some time as craftsman and cabinet-maker for the [[Museo di Fisica e Storia Naturale]] of [[Florence]], producing inlaid-wood furniture and apparatuses for the Physics Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Ackermann, Silke, Richard Kremer, and Mara Miniati. Scientific instruments on display. Brill, 2014. p20&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a part of a revival in piano making in late eighteenth-century Italy, along with revival of piano making in late eighteenth-century Italy by such makers as [[Giuseppe Zannetti]], [[Vicenzio Sodi]], [[Luigi Vignoli]], and [[Errico Gustadt]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollens, Stewart.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1718">Professor '''Henri-François-Émile Termier''' (13 December 1897 &amp;ndash; 12 August 1989) was a [[France|French]] [[geologist]]. 

Born at [[Lyon]] into a scholarly family, he served in the [[First World War]] as an [[artillery]] officer during which he earned a [[Croix de guerre]]. After working as an assistant at the university in [[Montpellier]] (1923 - 1925), he became a geologist working for the Service géologique du Maroc ([[Morocco]] Mine Service), where he worked until 1940, becoming very famous for his studies of [[stratigraphy]] and fossil fauna (he found the first specimens of ''[[Titanichthys agassizi]]''). Later he taught at the university of [[Algeria]] (1945) and ten years later he became a chairmain at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. He was married to professor [[Geneviève Termier]], another famous French [[paleontologist]].

'''INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory''' ('''INTEGRAL''') is a currently operational [[space telescope]] for observing [[gamma rays]]. It was launched by the [[European Space Agency]] into Earth orbit in 2002, and is designed to detect some of the most energetic radiation that comes from space. It was the most sensitive [[gamma ray astronomy|gamma ray observatory]] in space &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

INTEGRAL is an ESA mission in cooperation with the [[Russian Federal Space Agency|Russian Space Agency]] and [[NASA]]. It has had some notable successes, for example in detecting a mysterious '[[iron quasar]]'.  It has also had success in investigating [[gamma-ray burst]]s and evidence for [[black hole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Mission==
Because [[gamma rays]] and [[X-rays]] cannot penetrate Earth's atmosphere, direct observations must be made from space.  INTEGRAL was launched from [[Baikonur]] spaceport, in [[Kazakhstan]].  The 2002 launch aboard a [[Proton rocket|Proton]]-DM2 rocket achieved a 700&amp;nbsp;km [[perigee]].  The onboard thrusters then raised the perigee out of the residual atmosphere, and the worst regions of the radiation belts.  The [[apogee]] was trimmed with the thrusters to synchronize with Earth's rotation, and thus, the satellite's ground stations.

INTEGRAL's operational orbit has a period of 72 hours, and has a high eccentricity, with [[perigee]] close to the Earth at 10,000&amp;nbsp;km, within the magnetospheric radiation belt. However, most of each orbit is spent outside this region, where scientific observations may take place. It reaches a furthest distance from Earth ([[apogee]]) of 153,000&amp;nbsp;km.  The apogee was placed in the northern hemisphere, to reduce time spent in eclipses, and maximize contact time over the ground stations in the northern hemisphere.

It is controlled from [[ESOC]] in [[Darmstadt]], Germany, ESA's control centre, through ground stations in Belgium (Redu) and California ([[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]]).

Fuel usage is within predictions.  INTEGRAL has already exceeded its 2.2-year planned lifetime; barring mechanical failures, it should continue to function for six years or more. {{As of|November 2016}} its mission has been extended to December 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Two-year extensions confirmed for ESA's science missions |url=http://sci.esa.int/director-desk/58589-two-year-extensions-confirmed-for-esa-s-science-missions/ |website=ESA |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its orbit was adjusted in Jan/Feb 2015 to cause a safe (southern) reentry in Feb 2029. There should be sufficient fuel left for science operations past 2020,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci.esa.int/integral/55345-integral-manoeuvres-for-the-future/ INTEGRAL manoeuvres for the future]&lt;/ref&gt; if ESA judges that the scientific return of the missions continues justifying its operating costs.

==Spacecraft==
The spacecraft body ("service module") is a copy of the [[XMM-Newton]] body.  This saved development costs and simplified integration with infrastructure and ground facilities.  (An adapter was necessary to mate with the different booster, though.)  However, the denser instruments used for gamma rays and hard X-rays make INTEGRAL the heaviest scientific payload ever flown by ESA.

The body is constructed largely of composites.  Propulsion is by a [[hydrazine]] [[monopropellant]] system, containing 544&amp;nbsp;kg of fuel in four exposed tanks.  The titanium tanks were charged with gas to 24 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (2.4 [[megapascal|MPa]]) at 30&amp;nbsp;°C, and have tank diaphragms.  Attitude control is via a star tracker, multiple Sun sensors, and multiple momentum wheels.  The dual solar arrays, spanning 16 meters when deployed and producing 2.4&amp;nbsp;kW BoL, are backed up by dual nickel-cadmium battery sets.

The instrument structure ("payload module") is also composite.  A rigid base supports the detector assemblies, and an H-shaped structure holds the coded masks approximately 4 meters above their detectors.  The payload module can be built and tested independently from the service module, reducing cost.

[[Alenia Spazio]] (now Thales Alenia Space Italia) was the spacecraft prime contractor.

==Instruments==
Four instruments are coaligned to study a target across several ranges.  The [[coded aperture|coded masks]] were led by the University of Valencia, Spain.

The INTEGRAL imager, '''IBIS''' (Imager on-Board the INTEGRAL Satellite) observes from 15 [[keV]] (hard X-rays) to 10 [[MeV]] (gamma rays).  Angular resolution is 12 arcmin, enabling a bright source to be located to better than 1 arcmin.  A 95 x 95 mask of rectangular [[tungsten]] tiles sits 3.2 meters above the detectors.  The detector system contains a forward plane of 128 x 128 Cadmium-Telluride tiles (ISGRI- Integral Soft Gamma-Ray Imager), backed by a 64 x 64 plane of Caesium-Iodide tiles (PICsIT- Pixellated Caesium-Iodide Telescope).  ISGRI is sensitive up to 1 MeV, while PICsIT extends to 10 MeV.  Both are surrounded by passive shields of tungsten and lead.

{{float right clear none|[[File:HURA_hexagonal_coded_aperture_mask_principle.svg|thumb|Simplified principle of operation of a HURA hexagonal coded aperture mask used in SPI]]}}
The primary spectrometer aboard INTEGRAL is '''SPI''', the SPectrometer for INTEGRAL. It was conceived and assembled by the French Space Agency [[CNES]]. It observes radiation between 20 [[keV]] and 8 [[MeV]].  SPI consists of a [[coded mask]] of hexagonal [[tungsten]] tiles, above a detector plane of 19 [[germanium]] crystals (also packed hexagonally).  The Ge crystals are actively cooled with a mechanical system, and give an energy resolution of 2 keV at 1 MeV.

IBIS and SPI need a method to stop background radiation.  The SPI '''ACS''' (AntiCoincidence Shield) consists of a mask shield and a detector shield.  The mask shield is a layer of plastic [[scintillator]] behind the tungsten tiles.  It absorbs secondary radiation produced by impacts on the tungsten.  The rest of the shield consists of [[Bismuth germanate|BGO]] scintillator tiles around the sides and back of the SPI.

The enormous area of the ACS that results makes it an instrument in its own right.  Its all-sky coverage and sensitivity make it a natural [[gamma-ray burst]] detector, and a valued component of the [[InterPlanetary Network|IPN]] (InterPlanetary Network).  Recently, new algorithms allow the ACS to act as a telescope, through double [[Compton scattering]].  Thus ACS can study objects outside the field of view of the other instruments, with surprising spatial and energy resolution.

Dual '''JEM-X''' units provide additional information on targets.  They observe in soft and hard X-rays, from 3 to 35 keV.  Aside from broadening the spectral coverage, imaging is more precise due to the shorter wavelength.  Detectors are gas scintillators ([[xenon]] plus [[methane]]) in a microstrip layout, below a mask of hexagonal tiles.

INTEGRAL mounts an Optical Monitor ('''OMC'''), sensitive from 500 to 580 [[nanometer|nm]]. It acts as both a framing aid, and can note the activity and state of some brighter targets.

The spacecraft also mounts a radiation monitor, INTEGRAL Radiation Environment Monitor ('''IREM'''), to note the orbital background for calibration purposes.  IREM has an electron and a proton channel, though radiation up to [[cosmic rays]] can be sensed.  Should the background exceed a preset threshold, IREM can shut down the instruments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2299">The '''International Academy of Sex Research''' ('''IASR''') is a scientific society for researchers in [[sexology]].  According to [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]], retired director of the [[Kinsey Institute]], IASR "can claim...most of the field's leading researchers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/magazine/25desire-t.html?_r=1&amp;hp The New York Times Magazine. (25 January 2009). ''What is female desire?'' by Daniel Bergner, p. 26.]&lt;/ref&gt;   IASR is unique among sexology organizations in that individuals must be elected to membership, which requires demonstration of substantial contribution to sexology, including the authorship of 10 or more professional publications.  Notable members have included Drs. [[Ray Blanchard]], [[Milton Diamond]], [[Kurt Freund]], [[Richard Green (sexologist)|Richard Green]], [[Leonore Tiefer]], Judith Becker, and [[Ken Zucker]]. The official journal of IASR is the ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]''.

==History==
IASR was founded on 1 August 1973. The 53 founding charter members were nominated by the board of the journal ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'', which became the official publication of the IASR. The founding editor of ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' was Richard Green.&lt;ref&gt;Green, R. (1985). The International Academy of Sex Research: In the beginning. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 14,'' 293-302.&lt;/ref&gt; The current editor is [[Kenneth Zucker]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.springer.com/public+health/journal/10508?detailsPage=editorialBoard&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual IASR meeting was held at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]] in September 1975. It was hosted by IASR founding president, [[Richard Green (sexologist)|Richard Green]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, R. (2001). A 30 years' thank you. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 30,'' 633-637.&lt;/ref&gt;

In competitive two-player games, the '''killer heuristic''' is a technique for improving the efficiency of [[alpha-beta pruning]], which in turn improves the efficiency of the [[minimax algorithm]].  This algorithm has an [[exponential time|exponential]] search time to find the optimal next move, so general methods for speeding it up are very useful. [[Barbara Liskov]] created the general [[heuristic]] to speed [[tree search]] in a computer program to play [[chess endgame]]s for her Ph.D. thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huberman (Liskov)|first=Barbara Jane|title=A program to play chess end games|year=1968|publisher=Stanford University Department of Computer Science, Technical Report CS 106, Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project Memo AI-65| url = http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/673971.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alpha-beta pruning]] works best when the best moves are considered first.  This is because the best moves are the ones most likely to produce a ''cutoff'', a condition where the game playing program knows that the position it is considering could not possibly have resulted from best play by both sides and so need not be considered further.  I.e. the game playing program will always make its best available move for each position.  It only needs to consider the other player's possible responses to that best move, and can skip evaluation of responses to (worse) moves it will not make.

The killer heuristic attempts to produce a cutoff by assuming that a move that produced a cutoff in another branch of the [[game tree]] at the same depth is likely to produce a cutoff in the present position, that is to say that a move that was a very good move from a different (but possibly similar) position might also be a good move in the present position.  By trying the ''killer move'' before other moves, a game playing program can often produce an early cutoff, saving itself the effort of considering or even generating all legal moves from a position.

In practical implementation, game playing programs frequently keep track of two killer moves for each depth of the game tree (greater than depth of 1) and see if either of these moves, if legal, produces a cutoff before the program generates and considers the rest of the possible moves.  If a non-killer move produces a cutoff, it replaces one of the two killer moves at its depth.  This idea can be generalized into a set of [[refutation table]]s.

A generalization of the killer heuristic is the ''history heuristic''. The history heuristic can be implemented as a table that is indexed by some characteristic of the move, for example "from" and "to" squares or piece moving and the "to" square. When there is a cutoff, the appropriate entry in the table is incremented, such as by adding ''d²'' or ''2&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;'' where ''d'' is the current search depth. This information is used when ordering moves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12853">The term "'''level of analysis'''" is used in the [[social science]]s to point to the location, size, or scale of a research target. "Level of analysis" is distinct from the term "[[unit of observation]]" in that the former refers to a more or less integrated set of relationships while the latter refers to the distinct unit from which data have been or will be gathered. Together, the [[unit of observation]] and the level of analysis help define the [[Sample population|population]] of a research enterprise.&lt;ref name="Blalock79"&gt;{{citation |year=1979 |author=Blalock, Hubert M |title=Social Statistics |place=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-005752-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analytical levels in social science (in ascending order) ==

Although levels of analysis are not necessarily [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]], there are three general levels into which [[social science]] research may fall: [[Microsociology|micro-level]], [[wikt:meso-|meso-]]level or [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range]], and [[Macrosociology|macro]]-level.&lt;ref name="Blalock79"/&gt;

===Micro-level===
The smallest unit of analysis in the [[social sciences]] is an individual in their social setting. At the micro-level, also referred to as the local level, the research population typically is an individual in their social setting or a small group of individuals in a particular social context. Examples of micro levels of analysis include, but are not limited to, the following individual analysis type approach.
* [[Alien (law)|Alien]], [[stateless person]], [[Asylum seeker#Asylum seekers|asylum seeker]], [[refugee]]
* [[Person]]
* [[Citizen]]
* [[Civil partnership|Partnership]], [[marriage]]
* [[Families]]
* [[Household]]
* [[Neighbourhood|Neighborhood]]

===Meso-level===
In general, a meso-level analysis indicates a [[Sample population|population]] size that falls between the micro- and macro-levels, such as a [[community]] or an [[formal organization|organization]]. However, meso-level may also refer to analyses that are specifically designed to reveal connections between micro- and macro-levels. It is sometimes referred to as [[Middle range theory (sociology)|mid-range]], especially in [[sociology]]. Examples of meso-level units of analysis include, but are not limited to, the following. The
* [[Clan]]
* [[Tribe]]
* [[Community]]
* [[Village]], [[town]], [[city]]
* [[Formal organization]]
* [[State (polity)|State]]

===Macro-level===
Macro-level analyses generally trace the outcomes of interactions, such as [[economic]] or other [[resource]] [[Transfer function|transfer]] interactions over a large [[Sample population|population]]. It is also referred to as the global level. Examples of macro-level units of analysis include, but are not limited to, the following.
* [[Nation]]
* [[Society]]
* [[Civilization]]
* [[International relations|International]]
* [[Globalization|Global]]

=== Marr's tri-level hypothesis ===
According to [[David Marr (neuroscientist)#Levels of analysis|David Marr]], information processing systems must be understood at three distinct yet complementary levels of analysis - an analysis at one level alone is not sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Computational ====
The computational level of analysis identifies ''what'' the information processing system does (e.g.: what problems does it solve or overcome) and similarly, why does it do these things.

==== Algorithmic/representational ====
The algorithmic/representational level of analysis identifies ''how'' the information processing system performs its computations, specifically, what representations are used and what processes are employed to build and manipulate the representations.

==== Physical/implementation ====
The physical level of analysis identifies how the information processing system is ''physically realized'' (in the case of biological vision, what neural structures and neuronal activities implement the visual system).

=== Poggio's learning level ===
After thirty years of the book ''Vision (David Marr. 1982. W. H. Freeman and Company)'', [[Tomaso Poggio]] adds one higher level beyond the computational level, that is the [[machine learning|learning]].
{{Quote|text=I am not sure that Marr would agree, but I am tempted to add learning as the very top level of understanding, above the computational level. [...] Only then may we be able to build intelligent machines that could learn to see—and think—without the need to be programmed to do it.|sign=[[Tomaso Poggio]]|source=''Vision'' (David Marr. 2010. The MIT Press), Afterword, P.367}}

== "Level of analysis" in political science ==

In [[political science]], level of analysis is generally divided into three categories - [[individual]], [[State (polity)|state]], and [[international relations|international system]], however newer discussions of globalization have led to a newer level of analysis to be considered. The three (or four) levels of analysis cannot describe every effect and there is unlimited number of levels between the three primary ones, levels of analysis will help understand how one force in [[political power]] affects another. Generally, power is the concept that collects all the analysis together. For example, the struggle for power may be the cause of war, but the struggle for power may originate in the individual human being's lust for power. The lust for power is individual level of analysis, while the struggle for power is systemic level of analysis.&lt;ref name ="Nau"&gt;{{citation|author= Henry R. Nau | title= Perspectives on International Relations (2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual level===
The individual level of analysis locates the cause of events in individual leaders or the immediate circle of decision makers within a particular country. It focuses on human actors on the world stage identifying the characteristics of human decision making.&lt;ref name = "Nau" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John T. Rowrke. International Politics on the World Stage, 10th edition.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the cause of [[World War I]] is from the particular leaders in power at that time. [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] is considered to be the level from which the cause originated. It may have been his need for power to hide a sense of inferiority, or it may have been his inability to understand the intricacies of [[Power in international relations|statecraft]], the way [[Otto von Bismarck]] did. Or it may have been his idea about the [[monarchy]] and German destiny. All three possibilities are drawn from an individual level of analysis.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Domestic/state level===
The domestic level of analysis locates causes in the character of the domestic system of specific states. Thus, war is caused by aggressive or warlike states, not by evil, inept, or misguided people or the structure of power in the international system. The failure of domestic institutions may also cause war.&lt;ref name = "Nau" /&gt; In [[World War I]], the internal collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], or the brittle coalition inside [[Germany]] of agricultural and industrial interest, such as [[rye]] and [[iron]], are often cited as important causes. Domestic level cases may come from various characteristics of the domestic system. [[Capitalist]] and [[socialist]] economies generate different attitudes and behavior. 

The [[Muslim]] and [[Christian]] religions or [[democracy|democratic]] and nondemocratic political ideologies do as well. Stable and failed institutions are domestic level factors affecting state behavior. A great worry today is the existence of failed states, meaning states whose domestic institutions have broken down, such as [[Somalia]]. Another worry here is existence of a rogue state, such as [[North Korea]], which may pass [[nuclear weapons]] on to [[terrorists]]. Any type of state come from the domestic level of analysis, but a [[failed state]] usually means an institutional breakdown at domestic level of analysis, whereas a [[rogue state]] often implies evil intentions by individual – individual level of analysis.

===Systemic level===
The systemic level of analysis explains outcomes from a system wide level that includes all states.&lt;ref name = "Nau" /&gt; It takes into account both the position of states in the international system and their interrelationships. The position of states constitutes the systemic structural level of analysis. This involves the relative distribution of power, such as which state; great, middle, or small power, and [[geopolitics]]; such as which state is sea or land power. The interaction of states constitutes the systemic process level of analysis. At this level, we are concerned with which state aligns with which other states and which state negotiates with which other states. Thus, we can explain [[World War I]] in terms of the absence of system wide institutions, such as [[League of Nations]], which was not created until after World War I to prevent such wars in the future. However, system wide institution does not always mean harmony among nations, as seen in the [[World War II]]. The cause of [[World War II]] is seen as the failure of a systemic institution, which led new institutions of the [[United Nations]] to carry on reformed legacy of the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;McGraw Hill. Introduction to International Business, 8th edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global level===
Global level factors are much like Systemic level factors, however the core difference is that global factors are not necessarily created by states, whereas systemic factors are. Global factors ''can'' be the outcome of individuals, interest groups, states, nonstate actors or even natural conditions – however they cannot be ''traced'' to the actions of any one state or even group of states. An example can be how the internet can shape how policy is formed, through social media or forums – where an idea is formed over time by a group of individuals, but the source is generally hard to determine. An environmental natural example is how global warming can help shape how society views certain policies, or help shape new policies themselves. Droughts caused by rising temperatures can cause global actors to form alliances to help procure critical resources - and as writers such as Peter Gleik and Michael Klare have shown, the possibility of "Water Wars" in dry countries in Africa and the Middle East are very possible.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press. Introduction to Global Politics, Third edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

| Closed due to the Islamic Revolution. A lot of foreign companies, specifically American, were forced to leave. McDonald's attempted to re-enter the Iranian market in 1994, but this failed due to a hostile anti-American fundamentalist attack on the building which was under construction where the planned franchise would be opened. McDonald's does not plan on opening any restaurants in Iran at this time.

The '''list of ecoregions in Illinois''' are lists of [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s (see also, [[ecosystem]]) of the United States' State of [[Illinois]], as defined separately by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA), and by the [[World Wildlife Fund]].  Illinois' ecology is in a land area of {{convert|56,400|sqmi|km2}}; the state is {{convert|385|mi|km}} long and {{convert|218|mi|km}} wide and is located between latitude: 36.9540° to 42.4951° N, and longitude: 87.3840° to 91.4244° W,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illinois.gov/about/Pages/DataAndStatistics.aspx About Illinois Data and Statistics], retrieved 2013-02-10&lt;/ref&gt; with primarily a [[humid continental climate]].

==USEPA==
The EPA ecoregion classification system has four levels, but only Levels I, III, and IV are shown on this list. Level I divides North America into 15 broad ecoregions (or [[biomes]]).  Illinois is almost entirely within the Eastern Temperate Forest environment Level I region, although very small sections in its extreme west are in the Great Plains, Level I region.  Level IV ecoregions (denoted by numbers and letters) are a further subdivision of Level III ecoregions  (denoted by numbers alone).&lt;ref name=CEC&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]] | title=Ecological Regions of North America: Toward a Common Perspective | url=http://www3.cec.org/islandora/en/item/1701-ecological-regions-north-america-toward-common-perspective | year=1997 | accessdate=2013-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-illinois-ecoregions-l4-map.php Plant Maps Interactive - Illinois Ecoregions (based on EPA data)], retrieved 2013-02-10 &lt;/ref&gt;  In general, Illinois transitions from the forests, to [[savannah]], to [[tall grass prairie]], and is now largely used for agriculture or urbanized, although in its far south are the forested highlands of the [[Shawnee Hills]] and along its major rivers varying topography and biome occurs.  Its larger ecoregion areas are 'corn belt' [[plain]]s, known for rich, thick [[loess]] (in its north, center and east, particularly 54a) and the 'rivers and hills' region, which also has large [[till]] plains in Illinois' south (72j) and west (72i).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ecoregion Maps and GIS Resources |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | url=http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/ecoregions.htm |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20548">In his 2008, Nemmers Prize lecture,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econ.northwestern.edu/seminars/Nemmers09/milgrom-presentation.pdf Milgrom Nemmers Prize Presentation Slides, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220221421/http://www.econ.northwestern.edu/seminars/Nemmers09/milgrom-presentation.pdf |date=2014-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Milgrom]] gave the following definition of ''Market Design''

&lt;blockquote&gt;Market design is a kind of economic engineering, utilizing laboratory research, game theory, algorithms, simulations, and more. Its challenges inspire us to rethink longstanding fundamentals of economic theory.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He outlined that two broad theoretical and practical efforts defined the field: ''auction theory'' and ''matching theory''. Milgrom has contributed to both and also, in many respects, to their synthesis. A third component of Market design is ''Simplifying Participants’ Message''. 

Milgrom advised the FCC on the design of the auction of bandwidth for cellular communications.

==Auction theory==
{{Main article|Auction theory}}

Early research on auctions focused on two special cases: common value auctions in which buyers have private signals of an items true value and private value auctions in which values are identically and independently distributed. Milgrom and Weber (1982) present a much more general theory of auctions with positively related values.  Each of ''n'' buyers receives a private signal &lt;math&gt;{{x}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt; . Buyer ''i''’s value &lt;math&gt;\phi ({{x}_{i}},{{x}_{-i}})&lt;/math&gt; is strictly increasing in &lt;math&gt;{{x}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;  and is an increasing symmetric function of &lt;math&gt;{{x}_{-i}}&lt;/math&gt;. If signals are independently and identically distributed, then buyer ''i''’s expected value &lt;math&gt;{{v}_{i}}={{E}_{{{x}_{-i}}}}\{\phi ({{x}_{i}},{{x}_{-i}})\}&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the other buyers’ signals. Thus, the buyers’ expected values are independently and identically distributed. This is the standard private value auction. For such auctions the revenue equivalence theorem holds. That is, expected revenue is the same in the sealed first-price and second-price auctions.

Milgrom and Weber assumed instead that the private signals are “affiliated”. With two buyers, the random variables &lt;math&gt;{{v}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{v}_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; with probability density function  &lt;math&gt;f({{v}_{1}},{{v}_{2}})&lt;/math&gt;  are affiliated if
: &lt;math&gt;f({{v}_{1}}^{\prime },{{v}_{2}}^{\prime })f({{v}_{1}},{{v}_{2}})\ge f({{v}_{1}},{{v}_{2}}^{\prime })f({{v}_{1}}^{\prime },{{v}_{2}})&lt;/math&gt;,  for all &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;{v}'&lt;v&lt;/math&gt;.
Applying Bayes’ Rule it follows that
&lt;math&gt;f({{v}_{2}}^{\prime }|{{v}_{1}}^{\prime })f({{v}_{2}}|{{v}_{1}})\ge f({{v}_{2}}|{{v}_{1}}^{\prime })f({{v}_{2}}^{\prime }|{{v}_{1}})&lt;/math&gt;,  for all &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;{v}'&lt;v&lt;/math&gt;.

Rearranging this inequality and integrating with respect to &lt;math&gt;{{v}_{2}}^{\prime }&lt;/math&gt; it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{F({{v}_{2}}|{{v}_{1}}^{\prime })}{f({{v}_{2}}|{{v}_{1}}^{\prime })}\ge \frac{F({{v}_{2}}|{{v}_{1}})}{f({{v}_{2}}|{{v}_{1}})}&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;{{v}_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;  and all&lt;math&gt;{{v}_{1}}^{\prime }&lt;{{v}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;.          (1)
It is this implication of affiliation that is critical in the discussion below.

For more than two symmetrically distributed random variables, let &lt;math&gt;V=\{{{v}_{1}},...,{{v}_{n}}\}&lt;/math&gt; be a set of random variables that are continuously distributed with joint probability density function ''f(v'') . The ''n'' random variables are affiliated if
: &lt;math&gt;f({x}',{y}')f(x,y)\ge f(x,{y}')f({x}',y)&lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;({x}',{y}')&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X\times Y&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;({x}',{y}')&lt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Revenue Ranking Theorem''' (Milgrom and Weber&lt;ref&gt;Milgrom, Paul and Robert Weber (1982). "A Theory of Auctions and Competitive Bidding". Econometrica (Econometrica, Vol. 50, No. 5) 50 (5): 1089–1122&lt;/ref&gt;)

Suppose each of ''n'' buyers receives a private signal &lt;math&gt;{{x}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt; .  Buyer ''i''’s value &lt;math&gt;\phi ({{x}_{i}},{{x}_{-i}})&lt;/math&gt; is strictly increasing in &lt;math&gt;{{x}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;  and is an increasing symmetric function of &lt;math&gt;{{x}_{-i}}&lt;/math&gt;.  If signals are affiliated, the equilibrium bid function in a sealed first-price auction &lt;math&gt;{{b}_{i}}=B({{x}_{i}})&lt;/math&gt; is smaller than the equilibrium expected payment in the sealed second price auction.

The intuition for this result is as follows: In the sealed second-price auction the expected payment of a winning bidder with value ''v'' is based on their own information. By the revenue equivalence theorem if all buyers had the same beliefs, there would be revenue equivalence. However, if values are affiliated, a buyer with value ''v'' knows that buyers with lower values have more pessimistic beliefs about the distribution of values. In the sealed high-bid auction such low value buyers therefore bid lower than they would if they had the same beliefs. Thus the buyer with value ''v'' does not have to compete so hard and bids lower as well. Thus the informational effect lowers the equilibrium payment of the winning bidder in the sealed first-price auction.

'''Equilibrium bidding in the sealed first- and second-price auctions''': We consider here the simplest case in which there are two buyers and each buyer’s value &lt;math&gt;{{v}_{i}}=\phi ({{x}_{i}})&lt;/math&gt; depends only on his own signal. Then the buyers’ values are private and affiliated. In the sealed second-price (or [[Vickrey auction]]), it is a dominant strategy for each buyer to bid his value. If both buyers do so, then a buyer with value v has an expected payment of
: &lt;math&gt;e(v)=\frac{\int\limits_{0}^{v}{{}}yf(y|v)dy}{F(v|v)}&lt;/math&gt;           (2) .

In the sealed first-price auction, the increasing bid function ''B''(''v'') is an equilibrium if bidding strategies are mutual best responses.  That is, if buyer 1 has value ''v'', their best response is to bid ''b'' = ''B''(''v'') if they believes that their opponent is using this same bidding function. Suppose buyer 1 deviates and bids ''b'' = ''B''(''z'') rather than ''B''(''v'') . Let U(z) be their resulting payoff. For ''B''(''v'') to be an equilibrium bid function, ''U''(''z'') must take on its maximum at ''x'' = ''v''.
With a bid of ''b'' = ''B''(''z'') buyer 1 wins if
:&lt;math&gt;B({{v}_{2}})&lt;B(z)&lt;/math&gt; ,  that is,  if &lt;math&gt;{{v}_{2}}&lt;z&lt;/math&gt;  .
The win probability is then &lt;math&gt;w=F(z|v)&lt;/math&gt;  so that buyer 1’s expected payoff is
: &lt;math&gt;U(z)=w(v-B(z))=F(z|v)(v-B(z))&lt;/math&gt;.
Taking logs and differentiating by ''z'',
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{{{U}^{\prime }}(z)}{U(z)}=\frac{{w}'(z)}{w(z)}-\frac{{B}'(z)}{v-B(z)}=\frac{f(z|v)}{F(z|v)}-\frac{{B}'(z)}{v-B(z)}&lt;/math&gt;.           (3)
The first term on the right hand side is the proportional increase in the win probability as the buyer raises his bid from
&lt;math&gt;B(z)&lt;/math&gt;  to  &lt;math&gt;B(z+\Delta z)&lt;/math&gt;. The second term is the proportional drop in the payoff if the buyer wins.
We have argued that, for equilibrium,  ''U''(''z'') must take on its maximum at ''z'' = ''v'' . Substituting for ''z'' in (3) and setting the derivative equal to zero yields the following necessary condition.
: &lt;math&gt;{B}'(v)=\frac{f(v|v)}{F(v|v)}(v-B(v))&lt;/math&gt;.          (4)

'''Proof of the revenue ranking theorem'''

Buyer 1 with value ''x'' has conditional p.d.f. &lt;math&gt;f({{v}_{2}}|x)&lt;/math&gt;.
Suppose that he naively believes that all other buyers have the same beliefs. In the sealed high bid auction he computes the equilibrium bid function using these naive beliefs.   Arguing as above, condition (3) becomes
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{{{U}^{\prime }}(z)}{U(z)}=\frac{f(z|x)}{F(z|x)}-\frac{{B}'(z)}{v-B(z)}&lt;/math&gt;.          (3’)
Since ''x'' &gt; ''v'' it follows by affiliation (see condition (1)) that the proportional gain to bidding higher is bigger under the naive beliefs that place higher mass on higher values. Arguing as before, a necessary condition for equilibrium is that (3’) must be zero at ''x'' = ''v''.  Therefore, the equilibrium bid function &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{x}}(v)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the following differential equation.
: &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{x}}^{\prime }(v)=\frac{f(v|x)}{F(v|x)}(v-{{B}_{x}}(v))&lt;/math&gt; .     (5)
Appealing to the revenue equivalence theorem, if all buyers have values that are independent draws from the same distribution then the expected payment of the winner is the same in the two auctions. Therefore,  &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{x}}(x)=e(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, to complete the proof we need to establish that &lt;math&gt;B(x)\le {{B}_{x}}(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
Appealing to (1), it follows  from (4) and (5) that for all ''v'' &lt; ''x''.
: &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{x}}^{\prime }(v)\ge \left(\frac{v-{{B}_{x}}(v)}{v-B(v)}\right)B(v)&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, for any ''v'' in the interval [0,x]
:&lt;math&gt;B(v)-{{B}_{x}}(v)&gt;{{0}_{{}}}{{\Rightarrow }_{{}}}{B}'(v)-{{B}_{x}}^{\prime }(v)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; .
Suppose that  &lt;math&gt;B(x)&gt;{{B}_{x}}(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Since the equilibrium bid of a buyer with value 0 is zero, there must be some ''y''  &lt; ''x'' such that
: &lt;math&gt;{{(i)}_{{}}}B(y)-{{B}_{x}}(y)={{0}_{{}}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{(ii)}_{{}}}B(v)-{{B}_{x}}(v)&gt;0{{,}_{{}}}\forall v\in [y,x]&lt;/math&gt;.
But this is impossible since we have just shown that over such an  interval, &lt;math&gt;B(v)-{{B}_{x}}(v)&lt;/math&gt; is decreasing.
Since &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{x}}(x)=e(x)&lt;/math&gt; it follows that the winner bidder’s expected payment is lower in the sealed high-bid auction.

'''Ascending auctions with package bidding'''

Milgrom has also contributed to the understanding of combinatorial auctions. In work with Larry Ausubel (Ausubel and Milgrom, 2002), auctions of multiple items, which may be substitutes or complements, are considered. They define a mechanism, the “ascending proxy auction,” constructed as follows. Each bidder reports his values to a proxy agent for all packages that the bidder is interested in. Budget constraints can also be reported. The proxy agent then bids in an ascending auction with package bidding on behalf of the real bidder, iteratively submitting the allowable bid that, if accepted, would maximize the real bidder’s profit (value minus price), based on the reported values. The auction is conducted with negligibly small bid increments. After each round, provisionally winning bids are determined that maximize the total revenue from feasible combinations of bids. All of a bidder’s bids are kept live throughout the auction and are treated as mutually exclusive. The auction ends after a round occurs with no new bids. The ascending proxy auction may be viewed either as a compact representation of a dynamic combinatorial auction or as a practical direct mechanism, the first example of what Milgrom would later call a “core selecting auction.”

They prove that, with respect to any reported set of values, the ascending proxy auction always generates a core outcome, i.e. an outcome that is feasible and unblocked. Moreover, if bidders’ values satisfy the substitutes condition, then truthful bidding is a Nash equilibrium of the ascending proxy auction and yields the same outcome as the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism. However, the substitutes condition is robustly a necessary as well as a sufficient condition: if just one bidder’s values violate the substitutes condition, then with appropriate choice of three other bidders with additively-separable values, the outcome of the VCG mechanism lies outside the core; and so the ascending proxy auction cannot coincide with the VCG mechanism and truthful bidding cannot be a Nash equilibrium. They also provide a complete characterization of substitutes preferences: Goods are substitutes if and only if the indirect utility function is submodular.

Ausubel and Milgrom (2006a, 2006b) exposit and elaborate on these ideas. The first of these articles, entitled “The Lovely but Lonely Vickrey Auction,” made an important point in market design. The VCG mechanism, while highly attractive in theory, suffers from a number of possible weaknesses when the substitutes condition is violated, making it a poor candidate for empirical applications. In particular, the VCG mechanism may exhibit: low (or zero) seller revenues; non-monotonicity of the seller’s revenues in the set of bidders and the amounts bid; vulnerability to collusion by a coalition of losing bidders; and vulnerability to the use of multiple bidding identities by a single bidder. This may explain why the VCG auction design, while so lovely in theory, is so lonely in practice.

Additional work in this area by Milgrom together with Larry Ausubel and Peter Cramton has been particularly influential in practical market design. Ausubel, Cramton and Milgrom (2006) together proposed a new auction format that is now called the “combinatorial clock auction” (CCA), which consists of a clock auction stage followed by a sealed-bid supplementary round. All of the bids are interpreted as package bids; and the final auction outcome is determined using a core selecting mechanism. The CCA was first used in the United Kingdom’s 10–40&amp;nbsp;GHz spectrum auction of 2008. Since then, it has become a new standard for spectrum auctions: it has been utilized for major spectrum auctions in Austria, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK; and it is slated to be used in forthcoming auctions in Australia and Canada.

==Matching theory==
{{Main article|Matching theory (economics)}}

Milgrom has also contributed to the understanding of matching market design. In work with John Hatfield (Hatfield and Milgrom, 2005), he shows how to generalize the stable marriage matching problem to allow for “matching with contracts”, where the terms of the match between agents on either side of the market arise endogenously through the matching process. They show that a suitable generalization of the deferred acceptance algorithm of [[David Gale]] and [[Lloyd Shapley]] finds a stable matching in their setting; moreover, the set of stable matchings forms a lattice, and similar vacancy chain dynamics are present.

The observation that stable matchings are a [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] was a well known result that provided the key to their insight into generalizing the matching model. They observed (as did some other contemporary authors) that the lattice of stable matchings was reminiscent of the conclusion of Tarski’s fixed point theorem, which states that an increasing function from a complete lattice to itself has a nonempty set of fixed points that form a complete lattice. But it wasn’t apparent what was the lattice, and what was the increasing function. Hatfield and Milgrom observed that the accumulated offers and rejections formed a lattice, and that the bidding process in an auction and the deferred acceptance algorithm were examples of a cumulative offer process that was an increasing function in this lattice.

Their generalization also shows that certain package auctions (see the [[Paul Milgrom#Policy|Policy]] section) can be thought of as a special case of matching with contracts, where there is only one agent (the auctioneer) on one side of the market and contracts include both the items to be transferred and the total transfer price as terms. Thus, two of market design's great success stories, the deferred acceptance algorithm as applied to the medical match, and the simultaneous ascending auction as applied to the FCC spectrum auctions, have a deep mathematical connection. In addition, this work (in particular, the "cumulative offer" variation of the deferred acceptance algorithm) has formed the basis of recently proposed redesigns of the mechanisms used to match residents to hospitals in Japan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kamada Yuichiro |author2=Kojima Fuhito | year = 2010 | title = Improving Efficiency in Matching Markets with Regional Caps: The Case of the Japan Residency Matching Program". Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Discussion Paper and Kamada, Y., &amp; Kojima, F. (2012). "Stability and Strategy-Proofness for Matching with Constraints: A Problem in the Japanese Medical Match and Its Solution | url = | journal = American Economic Review | volume = 102 | issue = 3| pages = 366–370 | doi = 10.1257/aer.102.3.366 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and cadets to branches in the US Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sönmez Tayfun | year = 2013 | title = Bidding for Army Career Specialties: Improving the ROTC Branching Mechanism | url = | journal = Journal of Political Economy | volume = 121 | issue = 1| pages = 186–219 | doi=10.1086/669915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simplifying participants’ messages==

Milgrom has also contributed to the understanding of the effect of  simplifying the message space in practical market design.  He observed and developed as an important design element of many markets the notion of conflation---the idea of restricting a participant’s ability to convey rich preferences by forcing them to enter the same value for different preferences.  An example of conflation arises in Gale and Shapley’s deferred acceptance algorithm for hospital and doctors matching when hospitals are allowed to submit only responsive preferences (i.e., the ranking of doctors and capacities) even though they could be conceivably asked to submit general substitutes preferences.  In the Internet sponsored-search auctions, advertisers are allowed to submit a single per-click bid, regardless of which ad positions they win.  A similar, earlier idea of a conflated generic-item auction is an important component of the Combinatorial Clock Auction (Ausubel, Cramton and Milgrom, 2006), widely used in spectrum auctions including the UK's recent 800&amp;nbsp;MHz / 2.6&amp;nbsp;GHz auction, and has also been proposed for Incentive Auctions.&lt;ref&gt;FCC, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 12-118, September 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bidders are allowed to express only the quantity of frequencies in the allocation stage of the auction without regard to the specific assignment (which is decided in a later assignment stage).  Milgrom (2010) shows  that with a certain “outcome closure property,” conflation adds no new unintended outcome as equilibrium and argued that, by thickening the markets, may intensify price competition and increase revenue.

As a concrete application of the idea of simplifying messages, Milgrom (2009) defines assignment messages of preferences. In assignment messages, an agent can encode certain nonlinear preferences involving various substitution possibilities into linear objectives by allowing agents to describe multiple “roles” that objects can play in generating utility, with utility thus generated being added up. The valuation over a set of objects is the maximum value that can be achieved by optimally assigning them to various roles. Assignment messages can also be applied to resource allocation without money; see, for example, the problem of course allocation in schools, as analyzed by Budish, Che, Kojima, and Milgrom (2013). In doing so, the paper has provided a generalization of the Birkhoff-von Neumann Theorem (a mathematical property about [[Doubly stochastic matrix|Doubly Stochastic Matrices]]) and applied it to analyze when a given random assignment can be "implemented" as a lottery over feasible deterministic outcomes.

A more general language, ''endowed assignment message'', is studied by Hatfield and Milgrom (2005). Milgrom provides an overview of these issues in Milgrom (2011).

'''Mathematical knowledge management (MKM)''' is the study of how society can effectively make use of the vast and growing literature on [[mathematics]]. It studies approaches such as [[database]]s of mathematical knowledge, automated processing of formulae and the use of [[semantic web|semantic information]], and [[artificial intelligence]]. Mathematics is particularly suited to a systematic study of automated knowledge processing due to the high degree of interconnectedness between different areas of mathematics.

'''Mathematically Correct''' was a U.S.-based website created by educators, parents, mathematicians, and scientists who were concerned about the direction of reform mathematics [[curriculum|curricula]] based on [[NCTM standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachmewell.com/uk/news/mathematically_correct.asp|title=MathematicallyCorrect.com - US-Based organization that stresses need for Mathematics fundamentals|last=|first=|date=2008|website=TeachMeWell|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nychold.com/forum01-x-klein.html|title=MATH PROBLEMS|last=Klein|first=David|date=2000-04-01|website=NYC Hold|publisher=American School Board Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created in 1997, it was a frequently cited website in the so-called [[Math wars]], and was actively updated until 2003. The website went offline sometime in late 2012 or early 2013 but has been preserved on the [[Internet Archive]].

== History ==
Although Mathematically Correct had a national scope, much of its focus was on advocating against mathematics curricula prevalent in [[California]] in the mid-1990s. When California reversed course and adopted more traditional mathematics texts (2001 - 2002), Mathematically Correct changed its focus to reviewing the new text books. Convinced that the choices were adequate, the website went largely dormant.

Mathematically Correct maintained a large section of critical articles and reviews for a number of math programs. Most of the program opposed by Mathematically Correct had been developed from research projects funded by the National Science Foundation. Most of these programs also claimed to have been based on the 1989 [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics#1989 Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics|Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics]] published by the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]].

Mathematically Correct's main point of contention was that, in reform textbooks, traditional methods and concepts have been omitted or replaced by new terminology and procedures. As a result, in the case of the high-school program [[Core-Plus Mathematics Project]], for example, [http://www.maa.org/pubs/monthly_dec06_toc.html some reports suggest] that students may be unprepared for college level courses upon completion of the program. Other programs given poor ratings include programs aimed at elementary school students, such as Dale Seymour Publications (TERC) [[Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space]] and Everyday Learning [[Everyday Mathematics]]. 

Since Mathematically Correct had reviewed the programs, many have undergone revisions and are now with different publishers. Other programs, such as [[Mathland]] have been terminated.

[[File:World line.svg|thumb|236px|Milne's model follows the description from [[special relativity]] of an [[observable universe]]'s [[spacetime diagram]] containing past and future [[light cone]]s along with "elsewhere" in spacetime.]]

The '''Milne model''' was a [[Special relativity|special-relativistic]] [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Scientific modeling|model]] proposed by [[Edward Arthur Milne]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Arthur Milne]], [https://archive.org/details/RelativityGravitationAndWorldStructure ''Relativity, Gravitation and World Structure''], Oxford University Press, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; It is mathematically equivalent to a special case of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|FLRW model]] in the limit of zero [[energy density]] (in other words, an '''empty universe'''{{Citation needed|reason=In Milne's own words, universe contains infinite matter|date=April 2017}}) and it obeys the [[cosmological principle]]{{Citation needed|reason=In Milne's own words, his model is isotropic, but not homogeneous|date=April 2017}}. The Milne model is also similar to [[Rindler space]], a simple re-[[parameterization]] of flat [[Minkowski space]]{{Citation needed|reason=Rindler space consists of born rigid group of particles under acceleration.  Milne's model is not.|date=April 2017}}.

Since it features both zero energy density and maximally negative [[spatial curvature]], the Milne model is inconsistent with [[Observational cosmology|cosmological observations]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Cosmologists actually observe the universe's [[density parameter]] to be consistent with [[Unity (mathematics)|unity]] and its curvature to be consistent with [[Flat universe|flatness]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}.

==Milne metric==
The Milne universe is a special case{{Citation needed|reason=All FLRW metrics are homogeneous on large scales.  Milne's is not.|date=April 2017}} of a more general [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker model]] (FLRW). The Milne solution can be obtained from the more generic FLRW model by demanding that the energy density, pressure and cosmological constant all equal zero and the spatial curvature is negative.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} From these assumptions and the Friedmann equations it follows that the scale factor must depend on time coordinate linearly.&lt;ref name=Goobar&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\chi = \sinh^{-1}{r}&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[curvature]]-corrected radial component for negatively curved space that varies between 0 and &lt;math&gt;+\infin&lt;/math&gt;.

The empty space that the Milne model describes{{Citation needed|reason=Milne does not describe his model as empty space|date=April 2017}} can be identified with the inside of a light cone of an event in Minkowski space by a change of coordinates.&lt;ref name="Goobar4"/&gt;

Milne developed this model independent of [[general relativity]] but with awareness of [[special relativity]]. As he initially described it, the model has no expansion of space, so all of the redshift (except that caused by [[peculiar velocities]]) is explained by a [[recessional velocity]] associated with the hypothetical "explosion". However, the mathematical equivalence{{Citation needed|reason=Milne's model has no scale factor.  It cannot be mathematically equivalent to a model that has a scale factor|date=April 2017}} of the zero [[energy density]] (&lt;math&gt;\rho = 0&lt;/math&gt;) version of the [[FLRW metric]] to Milne's model implies that a full general relativistic treatment using Milne's assumptions would result in an increasing [[cosmic scale factor|scale factor]] and associated [[metric expansion of space]] with the unique feature of a linearly increasing scale factor for all time since the [[deceleration parameter]] is uniquely zero for such a model.

==Incompatibility with observation==
Even though the Milne model as a special case of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe is a solution to General relativity, the assumption of zero energy content limits its use as a realistic description of the universe. Besides lacking the capability of describing matter Milne's universe is also incompatible with certain [[observational cosmology|cosmological observations]]. In particular it makes no prediction of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]{{Citation needed|reason=Below, it says that Milne predicted a horizon, so finding CBR should be recognized as confirmation|date=April 2017}} nor the [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|abundance of light elements]]{{Citation needed|reason=based on which claim?  Milne's claim that the universe contained infinite density, or secondary sources, which claim Milne's model is empty?|date=April 2017}} which are hallmark pieces of evidence that cosmologists agree support Big Bang cosmology{{Citation needed|reason=cosmologists agree?  A single cosmologist would suffice, thanks.|date=April 2017}} over alternatives.

==Milne's density function==

Milne proposed that the universe's density changes in time because of an initial outward explosion of matter. Milne's model assumes an inhomogeneous density function which is Lorentz Invariant (around the event t=x=y=z=0). When rendered graphically Milne's density distribution shows a three-dimensional spherical [[Lobachevskian]] pattern with outer edges moving outward at the speed of light. Every inertial body perceives itself to be at the center of the explosion of matter (see [[observable universe]]), and sees the local universe as homogeneous and isotropic in the sense of the [[cosmological principle]].

Unless the universe modeled has zero density, Milne's proposal does not follow the predictions of [[general relativity]] for the curvature of space caused by global matter distribution, as seen in, for example statistics associated with [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]].

==Differences between Milne model and other models==
In order to explain the existence of matter in the universe, Milne proposed a physical [[explosion]] of matter which would not affect the universe's geometry. This is in contrast to the [[metric expansion of space]] that is the hallmark feature of many of the more famous cosmological models including the [[Big Bang]] and [[Steady State Theory|Steady State]] models. Milne's universe shares a superficial similarity to Einstein's [[static universe]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} in that the [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] of [[space]] is not [[time-dependence|time-dependent]]. Unlike Einstein's initial cosmology, Milne's proposal directly contradicts the Einstein equations for cosmological scales{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. [[Special relativity]] becomes a global property of Milne's universe while [[general relativity]] is confined to a local property. The reverse is true for standard cosmological models, and most scientists and mathematicians agree{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} that the latter is self-consistent while the former is mathematically impossible.

[[Edward Arthur Milne]] predicted a kind of [[event horizon]] through the use of this model: "The particles near the boundary tend towards invisibility as seen by the central observer, and fade into a continuous background of finite intensity." The horizon arises naturally from [[length contraction]] seen in special relativity which is a consequence of the [[speed of light]] upper bound for physical objects. In Milne's universe, the velocities of objects approach this upper bound while the distance to these objects approaches the speed of light multiplied by the time since the event of the initial explosion of material. Beyond this distance, objects do not lie in the observable part of the Milne universe.

At the time Milne proposed his model, observations of the universe did not appear to be in a [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4349">{{Refimprove|date=May 2017}}'''Notional [[election]] results''' are calculations made, usually following boundary changes of electoral districts brought about by population shifts, to determine what election results would have been in previous elections had the newly created boundaries then been in place.  Such calculations are used by psephologists and media for the purposes of detecting changing voting patterns and swings from one party to another from one election to the next, which is easier to calculate when no boundary changes have been implemented.

==Use in United Kingdom elections==
Boundary reviews can favour a particular political party, as notional election calculations have found.  In the case of the [[United Kingdom]], the Conservative Party usually benefits slightly due to population shifts away from inner cities towards suburban areas, where the Conservative Party has a stronger vote base.  Consequently, representation in inner city areas - usually areas where the Labour Party has its strongest voter base - declines as its population declines.

Notional election result calculations are of particular importance in the United Kingdom because the country is unusual in not releasing official breakdowns in voting data, which enables such data to be applied to electoral areas which are subject to boundary changes.  Parliamentary constituencies are based on smaller local government wards, and it is the results from local government elections that are the primary source used to calculate notional results at a constituency level.

Professors [[Colin Rallings]] and [[Michael Thrasher]] of [[Plymouth University]] have been involved in calculating notional results for general elections since 1992 where periodic boundary changes have taken place.  The data compiled from their work has been used by several prominent media companies including television channels for the purposes of comparing one general election result to the last.

Notional results have their limitations in that voting patterns may well have been different had new boundaries been in force at previous elections, because some voters who vote tactically may have chosen to vote differently under different boundaries, depending on which political parties or candidates were most competitive under old boundaries.

Other problems with making notional calculations is that people vote differently between national and local elections, particularly as many councilors enjoy a cross-party personal vote.  Local factors can also have a great effect on voting patterns.  In addition, a large number of wards are not contested by all the major political parties, some of them electing independent candidates or candidates from residents' associations.  Sometimes wards themselves are subject to boundary changes.

On a national level, notional general election results by constituency have been calculated in the UK on numerous occasions in the past by academics and election experts such as Rallings and Thrasher, when boundary changes have been implemented. 

In the February 1974 general election, notional results from the previous general election in 1970 were calculated on behalf of the [[BBC]] in constituencies where major boundary changes took effect.
In 1983, extensive boundary changes led to notional general election results being jointly calculated by the BBC and ITN for the previous general election in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0261-3794(83)80028-6 |title=The 1983 boundary commission: Policies and effects |journal=Electoral Studies |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=195–206 |year=1983 |last1=Waller |first1=Robert J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further notional results were created for the 1997 general election (to compare with the 1992 general election), in 2005 (to take into account the reduction in the number of Scottish constituencies brought about by the establishment of the [[Scottish Parliament]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Gerry |last1=Hassan |first2=Douglas |last2=Fraser |year=2004 |title=The political guide to modern Scotland: people, places and power |location=London |publisher=Politico's |isbn=978-1-84275-047-6 }}{{pn|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 2010 general election (to compare with the 2005 general election).

Lauer]], then a first year postdoc. At the first meeting of the group held at [[Princeton University]] in June 1985, [[Sandra Faber]] was elected the group leader.

==Members==

The original members of the Nuker Team include [[Alan Dressler]] (OCIW), [[Sandra M. Faber|Sandra Faber]] (UCO/Lick; First PI), [[John Kormendy]] (Texas), [[Tod R. Lauer]] (NOAO), [[Douglas Richstone]] (Michigan; Present PI),  and [[Scott Tremaine]] (IAS).  Later additions to the team include [[Ralf Bender]] (Munchen), [[Alexei Filippenko|Alexei V. Filippenko]] (Berkeley), [[Karl Gebhardt (astronomer)|Karl Gebhardt]] (Texas), [[Richard Green (astronomer)|Richard Green]] (LBTO), [[Kayhan Gultekin]] (Michigan), [[Luis C. Ho]] (OCIW), [[John Magorrian]] (Oxford), [[Jason Pinkney]] (Ohio Northern), and [[Christos Siopis]] (Michigan).&lt;ref name=Lauer /&gt;

==Etymology==

The name "Nuker" began as an informal internal reference by members of the team to each other, because they came together to study the nuclei of galaxies using the space telescope.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, S. Alan, ''Our Universe:  The Thrill of Extragalactic Exploration As Told by Leading Experts'', Cambridge University Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0-521-78330-5}} and {{ISBN|0-521-78907-9}}.  At page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first use of the name was in a 1989 email from [[Sandra M. Faber|Faber]], who addressed her five colleagues as "Dear Nukers".&lt;ref&gt;Email from Faber to team members, sent Jule 13, 1989, which begins, "Dear Nukers:  We got some time on our ST proposal for nuclei . . . ."&lt;/ref&gt;  As the team began to publish its research, the name came into general use in the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;Alan, ''supra'', at page 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Nuker" is also used in reference to the "[[Nuker law|Nuker Law]]", which is a description of the inner few (~3-10) arcseconds of predominantly nearby (&lt; 30 Mpc) early-type galaxy light-profiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1995AJ%2E%2E%2E%2E110%2E2622L The Centers of Early-Type Galaxies with HST.I.An Observational Survey]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nuker Law was described first by members of the Nuker Team, from which it gets its name.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The US also sometimes named the individual explosions in such a salvo test, which results in "name1 &amp;ndash; 1(with name2)". If test is canceled or aborted, then the row data like date and location discloses the intended plans, where known.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Patterns of Sexual Behavior''''' is a 1951 book by anthropologist [[Clellan S. Ford]] and ethologist [[Frank A. Beach]], in which the authors integrate information about [[human sexual behavior]] from different cultures, and include detailed comparisons across [[animal sexual behaviour|animal species]], with particular emphasis on [[primate]]s. The book received positive reviews and has been called a classic. It provided the foundation for the later research of [[Masters and Johnson]]. A revised edition, titled ''Human Sexuality in Four Perspectives'', was published in 1977.

==Summary==
Ford and Beach employ a "cross-cultural correlational method" in exploring sexual behavior,&lt;ref name=Bolin/&gt; a statistical approach suitable for distinguishing behavioral trends and making generalizations.&lt;ref name=Bolin/&gt; They integrate information from 191 cultures: 48 from [[Oceania]], 28 from [[Eurasia]], 33 from [[Africa]], 57 from [[North America]], and 26 from [[South America]].&lt;ref name=Lyons&gt;Andrew Paul Lyons &amp; Harriet Lyons (2004) ''Irregular Connections: A History of Anthropology and Sexuality'', University of Nebraska Press, p268-70&lt;/ref&gt; Much of their data was collected in the [[Human Relations Area Files]],&lt;ref name=Bolin/&gt; a cross-institutional organization co-founded by Ford.&lt;ref name=Murdock/&gt; They offer information on such topics as "[[sexual positions]], length (time) of intercourse, locations for intercourse, [[orgasm]] experiences, types of [[foreplay]], [[courting|courting behaviors]], frequencies of intercourse [and] methods of attracting a partner."&lt;ref name=Dettwyler/&gt; They cover [[homosexuality]] in both humans and other animals, citing evidence of accepted homosexual behavior in 49 of the 76 cultures for which the relevant data were available.&lt;ref name=Lyons/&gt; Ford and Beach conclude that there is a "basic [[mammal]]ian capacity" for [[homosexual behavior in animals|same-sex behavior]].&lt;ref name=Lyons/&gt;

==Publication history==
''Patterns of Sexual Behavior'' was originally published by [[Harper &amp; Brothers]], [[New York City|New York]] in 1951.&lt;ref name=Dettwyler&gt;Patricia Stuart-Macadam &amp;  [[Katherine A. Dettwyler]] (1995) ''Breastfeeding: biocultural perspectives,'' Transaction Publishers, p207&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the work was reprinted (under the title ''Patterns of Sexual Behaviour'') by [[Eyre and Spottiswoode]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name=Dettwyler/&gt; Metheun published a reprint of the 1951 [[Harper &amp; Row]] edition in 1965.&lt;ref name=Dettwyler/&gt; In 1977, Frank Beach authored a revised version of the book, entitled ''Human Sexuality in Four Perspectives.''&lt;ref name=Dewsbury&gt;Dewsbury, Donald A. (2000) "Frank A. Beach, Master Teacher," ''Portraits of Pioneers in Psychology, Volume 4,'' p269-281&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Scientific and academic journals===
''Patterns of Sexual Behavior'' received positive reviews from Allan R. Holmberg in the ''[[American Sociological Review]]'' and Abraham Stone in ''[[Journal of Marriage and Family|Marriage and Family Living]]'',&lt;ref name="Holmberg"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Allan R. |last=Holmberg |title=Patterns of Sexual Behavior |work=American Sociological Review |date=August 1951 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=578-579}} {{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Abraham |last=Stone |title=Patterns of Sexual Behavior |work=Marriage and Family Living |date=August 1951 |volume=13 |issue=3 |page=138}} {{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later discussed by the anthropologist [[George Murdock]] in ''[[American Anthropologist]]''.&lt;ref name=Murdock&gt;[[George P. Murdock]] (1974) "Clellan Stearns Ford, 1909-1972," ''[[American Anthropologist]]'', New Series, Vol. 76, No. 1 (Mar., 1974), pp. 83-85&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmberg described the book as well-written, and credited Ford and Beach with placing "the study of sex in a broad scientific perspective" by presenting and analyzing "an enormous body of data" on sexual behavior in both humans and non-human animals and placing it in cross-cultural, evolutionary, and physiological perspectives. He described their efforts as having "important theoretical, methodological, and practical implications" and believed they showed the merits of a "cross-disciplinary approach to the problems of human behavior." He complimented them for statistically documenting sexual practices and attitudes, and contributing important material on masturbation and homosexuality, suggesting the existence of "an inherent biological tendency toward such activities." He believed their book deserved to be widely read and predicted that it would have a "healthy impact on attitudes toward sex" and encourage further research by social scientists. However, he criticized them for providing insufficient discussion of "the symbolic aspects of sexual behavior".&lt;ref name="Holmberg" /&gt;

Stone credited Ford and Beach with examining both biological and social influences on sex, thereby providing an "essential perspective" on human sexual behavior. Though he considered their use of the term "sex behavior" to refer exclusively to "behavior involving stimulation and excitation of the sexual organ" to be narrow, he believed they dealt "in great detail with a great many aspects of sex conduct and sex contact" and provided a "very full presentation of sex behavior from the point of view of anatomy and physiology".&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt;

Murdock described the book as a "classic" of its field.&lt;ref name=Murdock/&gt;

===Evaluations in books===
Anne Bolin and Patricia Whelehan, writing in ''Perspectives on Human Sexuality'' (1999), identified ''Patterns of Sexual Behavior'' as a book that was highly influential in the study of sexual behavior, and provided the intellectual foundation for the later research of [[Masters and Johnson]].&lt;ref name=Bolin&gt;Anne Bolin &amp; Patricia Whelehan (1999), ''Perspectives on Human Sexuality,'' SUNY Press, p10&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Paul Lyons and Harriet Lyons, writing in ''Irregular Connections: A History of Anthropology and Sexuality'' (2004), argued that ''Patterns of Sexual Behavior'' was comprehensive for its time but nevertheless contained a number of self-imposed limitations. Its authors limited their definition of sexual behavior to "behavior involving stimulation and excitation of the [[sexual organs]]," and made no attempt to explore sexual symbolism. While acknowledging that their study might have implications for [[psychology]] and [[psychoanalysis]], they felt themselves unqualified to explore specific questions pertaining to this field. They claimed to make no judgements of [[moral value]], though their study is considered supportive of [[relativism|sexual relativism]]. Lyons and Lyons credited them with "making homosexual behavior more visible and more acceptable within the culture of its time."&lt;ref name=Lyons/&gt;

'''''Sense of place: a response to an environment: the Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia''''' is a 1972 book by [[George Seddon (academic)|George Seddon]]. It documents Seddon's struggle to understand the [[Swan Coastal Plain]], a biogeographic region that he initially found harsh and unwelcoming. It includes information on [[landform]]s, [[climate]], [[geology]], [[soil]]s, [[flora]], the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]], the coast, offshore islands, [[wetland]]s, and urban areas. This information is, however, essentially presented in a literary style; in the words of Mark Tredinnick: "This is the kind of geography an essayist writes. This is the kind of essay a literate scientist writes. This is a literary natural history."

In Australia it is considered a landmark environmental publication. Among its claims to influence is having given modern currency to the term ''[[sense of place]]''. Although Seddon did not coin the phrase, it was this book that introduced the phrase into the fields of [[landscape design|landscape]] and [[environmental design]].

'''''Re: Colonised Planet 5, Shikasta''''' (often shortened to '''''Shikasta''''') is a 1979 [[science fiction]] novel by [[Doris Lessing]], and is the first book in her five-book ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series. It was first published in the United States in October 1979 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], and in the United Kingdom in November 1979 by [[Jonathan Cape]]. Shikasta is also the name of the [[planets in science fiction|fictional planet]] featured in the novel.

Subtitled ''"Personal, psychological, historical documents relating to visit by Johor (George Sherban) Emissary (Grade 9) 87th of the Period of the Last Days"'', ''Shikasta'' is the history of the planet Shikasta (an allegorical [[Earth]]) under the influence of three [[galactic empire]]s, Canopus, Sirius, and their mutual enemy, Puttiora. The book is presented in the form of a series of reports by Canopean emissaries to Shikasta who document the planet's [[prehistory]], its degeneration leading to the "Century of Destruction" (the 20th century), and the [[Apocalypse]] ([[World War III]]).

''Shikasta'' draws on the [[Old Testament]] and is influenced by [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[mysticism|mystical]] themes in [[Sufism]], an [[Islam]]ic belief system in which Lessing had taken an interest in the mid-1960s. The book represented a major shift of focus in Lessing's writing, from realism to science fiction, and this disappointed many of her readers. It received mixed reviews from critics. Some were impressed by the scope and vision of the book, with one reviewer calling it "an audacious and disturbing work from one of the world's great living writers".&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; Others were critical of the novel's bleakness, that humanity has no [[free will]] and that their fate lies in the hands of galactic empires.

The story of Shikasta is retold in the third book of the ''Canopus'' series, ''[[The Sirian Experiments]]'' (1980), this time from the point of view of Sirius. Shikasta reappears in the fourth book in the series, ''[[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8]]'' (1982), and the Zones, briefly mentioned in ''Shikasta'', are the subject of the second book in the series, ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]'' (1980).

==Plot==
Canopus, a benevolent [[galactic empire]] centred at [[Canopus]] in the constellation [[Argo Navis]], colonises a young and promising planet they name Rohanda (the fruitful). They nurture its bourgeoning [[humanoid]]s and accelerate their evolution. When the Natives are ready, Canopus imposes a "Lock" on Rohanda that links it via "astral currents"&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt; to the harmony and strength of the Canopean Empire. In addition to Canopus, two other empires also establish a presence on the planet: their ally, Sirius from the [[Sirius|star of the same name]], and their mutual enemy, Puttiora. The Sirians confine their activities largely to [[Genetic engineering|genetic experiments]] on the southern continents during Rohanda's [[prehistory]] (described in Lessing's third book in the ''Canopus'' series, ''[[The Sirian Experiments]]''), while the Shammat of Puttiora remain dormant, waiting for opportunities to strike.

For many millennia the Natives of Rohanda prosper in a Canopean induced climate of peaceful coexistence and accelerated development. Then an unforeseen "cosmic re-alignment" puts Rohanda out of phase with Canopus which causes the Lock to break. Deprived of Canopus's resources and a steady stream of a substance called SOWF (substance-of-we-feeling), the Natives develop a "Degenerative Disease" that puts the goals of the individual ahead of those of the community.&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt; The Shammat exploit this disturbance and begin undermining Canopus's influence by infecting the Natives with their evil ways. As Rohanda degenerates into greed and conflict, the Canopeans reluctantly change its name to Shikasta (the stricken). Later in the book, Shikasta is identified as [[Earth]],&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt; or an allegorical Earth.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hazelton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;

In an attempt to salvage Canopus's plans for Shikasta and correct the Natives' decline, Canopean emissaries are sent to the planet. Johor is one such emissary, who takes on the form of a Native and begins identifying those individuals who have not degenerated too far and are amenable to his corrective instructions. Johor then sends those he has successfully "converted" to spread the word among other Natives, and soon isolated communities begin to return to the pre-Shikastan days. But without the SOWF and Shammat's influence over the Natives, Canopus is fighting a losing battle and the planet declines further. By the Shikastan's 20th century, the planet has degenerated into war and self-destruction. Johor returns, but this time through Zone 6{{#tag:ref|Shikasta is surround by six metaphysical Zones (akin to [[Plane (esotericism)|cosmological planes]]), each representing different "levels of spiritual being";{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|p=16}} Zone 6 is "closest" to Shikasta and is the plane to which "[[soul]]s" of the planet's dead go, and from which souls are reborn ([[reincarnation|reincarnated]]) back to the planet.&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt;{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=111}} Lessing elaborates on the Zones in the next book in the ''Canopus'' series, ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]'' (1980).|group="nb"|name=Zones}} from which he is born on the planet ([[Incarnation|incarnated]]) as a Shikastan, George Sherban. As Sherban grows up, he establishes contact with other Canopeans in disguise and then resumes his work trying to help the Shikastans. But famine and unemployment grow, and anarchy spreads.

On the eve of [[World War III]], Sherban and other emissaries relocate a small number of promising Shikastans to remote locations to escape the coming [[nuclear holocaust]].  He also takes part in the trial of all Europeans for the crimes of colonialism.  Europe has been conquered by China, but he persuades people that Europe was not the only offender.

The war reduces Shikasta's population by 99% and sweeps the planet clean of the "barbarians". The Shammat, who set the Shikastans on a course of self-destruction, self-destruct themselves and withdraw from the planet. The Canopeans help the survivors rebuild their lives and re-align themselves with Canopus. With a strengthened Lock and the SOWF flowing freely again, harmony and prosperity return to Shikasta.

==Background and genre==
[[File:Doris Lessing 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Doris Lessing speaking at a [[Cologne]] literature festival in Germany, 2006]]
In the mid-1960s Lessing had become interested in [[Sufism]], an [[Islam]]ic belief system, after reading ''[[The Sufis]]'' by [[Idries Shah]]. She described ''The Sufis'' as "the most surprising book [she] had read", and said it "changed [her] life".&lt;ref name=Lessingon/&gt; Lessing later met Shah, who became "a good friend [and] teacher".&lt;ref name=Lessingon/&gt; In the early 1970s Lessing began writing "inner space" fiction, which included the novels ''Briefing for a Descent into Hell'' (1971) and ''[[Memoirs of a Survivor]]'' (1974).&lt;ref name=NobelPrize-bio/&gt; In the late 1970s she wrote ''Shikasta'' in which she used many [[Sufism|Sufi]] concepts.&lt;ref name=Hoyt/&gt;

''Shikasta'' was intended to be a "single self-contained book", but as Lessing's [[fictional universe]] developed, she found she had ideas for more than just one book, and ended up writing a [[Canopus in Argos|series of five]].{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc="Some Remarks", p. 8}} ''Shikasta'', and the ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series as a whole, fall into the category of [[soft science fiction]] ("space fiction" in Lessing's own words{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc="Some Remarks", p. 8}}) due to their focus on characterization and social and cultural issues, and the de-emphasis of science and technology. [[Robert Alter]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that this kind of writing belongs to a genre [[literary criticism|literary critic]] [[Northrop Frye]] called the "anatomy", which is "a combination of fantasy and morality".&lt;ref name=Alter/&gt; [[Gore Vidal]] placed Lessing's "science fiction" "somewhere between [[John Milton]] and [[L. Ron Hubbard]]".&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt;

[[File:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|right|upright|[[Idries Shah]], who introduced Lessing to [[Sufism]]&lt;ref name=Lessingon/&gt;]]
''Shikasta'' represented a major shift of focus for Lessing, influenced by [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[mysticism|mystical]] themes in Sufism.&lt;ref name=Mural/&gt; This switch to "science fiction" was not well received by readers and critics.&lt;ref name=Hazelton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoyt/&gt; By the late 1970s, Lessing was considered "one of the most honest, intelligent and engaged writers of the day",&lt;ref name=Hazelton/&gt; and [[Western culture|Western]] readers unfamiliar with Sufism were dismayed that Lessing had abandoned her "rational worldview".{{sfn|Galin|1997|p=21}} George Stade of ''[[The New York Times]]'' complained that "our Grand Mistress of lumpen realism has gone religious on us".&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt; The reaction of reviewers and readers to the first two books in the series, ''Shikasta'' and ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]'' (1980), prompted Lessing to write in the Preface to the third book in the series, ''[[The Sirian Experiments]]'' (1980):

{{quote|I would so like it if reviewers and readers could see this series, ''Canopus in Argos: Archive'', as a framework that enables me to tell (I hope) a beguiling tale or two; to put questions, both to myself and to others; to explore ideas and sociological possibilities.{{sfn|Lessing|1994b|loc="Preface", p. 11}}}}

Further criticism of the ''Canopus'' series followed, which included this comment by ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic [[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]]: "One of the many sins for which the 20th century will be held accountable is that it has discouraged Mrs. Lessing&amp;nbsp;... She now propagandizes on behalf of our insignificance in the cosmic razzmatazz."&lt;ref name=Leonard/&gt; Lessing replied by saying: "What they didn't realize was that in science fiction is some of the best [[social science fiction|social fiction]] of our time. I also admire the classic sort of science fiction, like ''[[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]]'', by [[Greg Bear]]. He's a great writer."&lt;ref name=Blume/&gt; Lessing said in 1983 that she would like to write stories about [[Red dwarf|red]] and [[White dwarf|white dwarves]], space rockets powered by [[anti-gravity]], and charmed and coloured [[quark]]s, "[b]ut we can't all be [[physicist]]s".&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;

Lessing later wrote several essays on Sufism which were published in her essay collection, ''Time Bites'' (2004).&lt;ref name=NobelPrize-bio/&gt; She was awarded the 2007 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], and was described by the [[Swedish Academy]] as "that epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny".&lt;ref name=NobelPrize-award/&gt;

Lessing dedicated ''Shikasta'' to her father. While she was still a child in [[Southern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) he often used to gaze up at the night sky and say, "Makes you think – there are so many worlds up there, wouldn't really matter if we did blow ourselves up – plenty more where we came from."&lt;ref name=Hazelton/&gt; ''Shikasta'' gave rise to a [[Cult|religious cult]] in America.&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt; Lessing said in an interview that its followers had written to her and asked, "When are we going to be visited by the gods?", and she told them that the book is "not a cosmology. It's an invention", and they replied, "Ah, you're just testing us".&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;

==Analysis==

{{Quote box | quote  =  "The lowest, the most downtrodden, the most miserable of Shikastans will watch the wind moving a plant, and smile; will plant a seed and watch it grow; will stand to watch the life of the clouds.

The name "Shikasta" comes from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word شکسته (''shekasteh'') meaning "broken",{{sfn|Perrakis|2004|p=86}} and is often seen used as the name of the [[Iran]]ian national style of [[Persian calligraphy]], [[Shikasta Nastaʿlīq|Shekasteh Nastaʿlīq]].&lt;ref name=PersianCalligraphy/&gt; In the book, Lessing does not state explicitly that the planet Shikasta is [[Earth]], but many critics believe that its similarities to Earth's history make it clear that Shikasta ''is'' Earth as seen by the Canopeans.{{sfn|Dixson|1990|p=17}}&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt;&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt; Some of the documents in the book written by Shikastans refer to geographical locations and countries on Earth.{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc=p. 267. ("We children have been sent for holidays to England three times. We stay in London, and then go to a family in Wales." – an extract from Rachel Sherban's journal)}} Other critics, however, interpret Shikasta as an allegorical Earth with parallel histories that deviate from time to time.{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=111}}&lt;ref name=Hazelton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;

''Shikasta'' has been called an "anti-novel",&lt;ref name=Perrakis/&gt; and an "architectonic novel".{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=49}} It is the story of the planet Shikasta from the perspective of Canopus and is presented as a case study for "first-year students of Canopean Colonial Rule".&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt; It contains a series of reports by Canopean emissaries to the planet, extracts from the Canopean reference, ''History of Shikasta'',{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc=''History of Shikasta'', Vol. 3012, "The Century of Destruction", p. 109}} and copies of letters and journals written by selected Shikastans.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; The history of Shikasta is monitored by the virtually immortal Canopeans,&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; from Rohanda's [[prehistory]], through to Shikasta's "Century of Destruction" (Earth's 20th century), and into Earth's future when the Chinese occupy Europe and [[World War III]] breaks out.&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt; The book purports to be the "true" history of our planet.{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=49}}

''Shikasta'' alludes to the [[Old Testament]], [[Gnosticism]] and [[Sufism]],&lt;ref name=Hammersley/&gt; and draws on several [[Judeo-Christian]] themes.{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=49}} Lessing wrote in the book's [[preface]] that it has its roots in the Old Testament.&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt;{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc="Some Remarks", p. 10}} Her SOWF (Substance-Of-We-Feeling), the "spiritual nourishment" that flows from Canopus to Shikasta, is also a word she invented with a pronunciation similar to "Sufi".{{sfn|Galin|1997|p=86}} A reviewer of the book in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said that ''Shikasta'' is a "reworking of the Bible",&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt; and the Infinity Plus website draws parallels between the Canopeans and their emissaries, and God and his angels from the Old Testament.&lt;ref name=Hammersley/&gt; A ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reviewer wrote that the "outer space" where the Canopeans come from is a metaphor for "religious or inner space".&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt; Thelma J. Shinn, in her book ''Worlds Within Women: Myth and Mythmaking in Fantastic Literature by Women'', described the struggle between Canopus and Shammat, played out on Shikasta, as the "eternal struggle between good and evil",{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=50}} and the "Degenerative Disease" that strikes Shikasta as a metaphor for the [[original sin]].{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=49}} Lessing said in an interview that the final war ([[World War III]]) at the end of the novel is the [[Apocalypse]].&lt;ref name=Frick/&gt; Phyllis Sternberg Perrakis wrote in ''The Journal of Bahá’í Studies'' that ''Shikasta'' is the "symbolic rendering of the coming of a new prophet to an earthlike planet",{{sfn|Perrakis|2004|p=74}} and relates it to [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá’í]] principles.{{sfn|Perrakis|2004|p=75}}

==Reception==
Paul Gray wrote in a review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' that the documents that make up ''Shikasta'' allow Lessing to stretch the novel out over vast periods of time and shift perspective "dramatically from the near infinite to the minute".&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; He said that the book's cohesiveness is its variety, and noted how Lessing interspaces her "grand designs" and "configurations of enormous powers" with "passages of aching poignancy".&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; Gray said that ''Shikasta'' is closer to ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and the Old Testament than it is to [[Buck Rogers]], and may disappoint readers interpreting her "space fiction" as "science fiction".&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; He found Lessing's bleak vision of Earth's history in which she suggests that humans "could not&amp;nbsp;... help making the messes they have, that their blunders were all ordained by a small tic in the cosmos", a little "unsatisfying", but added that even if you do not subscribe to her theories, the book can still be enjoyable, "even furiously engaging on every page".&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; Gray called ''Shikasta'' "an audacious and disturbing work from one of the world's great living writers".&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt;

Author [[Gore Vidal]] wrote in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' that ''Shikasta'' is a "work of a formidable imagination".&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt; He said that Lessing is "a master" of [[Eschatology|eschatological]] writing, but added that while her depictions of a terminal [[London]] are "very real", as a whole the book is "never quite real enough".&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt; Vidal also felt that Zone 6, Lessing's alternate [[Plane (esotericism)|plane]] for the dead,&lt;ref group="nb" name=Zones/&gt; is not as convincing as The Dry Lands in [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]’s ''[[Earthsea|Earthsea trilogy]]''. He compared the Canopeans and Shammat to [[John Milton|Milton]]'s God and Satan in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', but said that while Lucifer's "overthrow&amp;nbsp;... of his writerly creator is an awesome thing",  in ''Shikasta'' Lessing's human race with no [[free will]] is too passive and of no interest.&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt; Vidal attributed this to Lessing's "surrender" to the [[Sufism|Sufis]] and the SOWF (Substance-Of-We-Feeling), and not her inability to create good characters.&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt;

''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reviewer George Stade said that ''Shikasta'' "forces us to think about&amp;nbsp;... what we are, how we got that way and where we are going", but complained that the book is filled with "false hopes", and that the fate of humankind relies on "theosophical emanations, cosmic influences, occult powers, spiritual visitations and stellar vibrations".&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt; When the SOWF is cut off and the Shikastans degenerate, Lessing "both indicts and exculpates" them, implying that humanity is bad, but it is not their fault.&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt; While Stade complemented Lessing on the book's satire, and her depictions of Zone 6, which he said "have the eerie beauty of ancient [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] texts", he "disapprove[d]" of the novel as a whole, but added, "that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy reading it".&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt;

Witing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. M. G. Lord called ''Shikasta'' an "epic" and suspected that it may have influenced the [[Swedish Academy|Nobel committee]] when they referred to Lessing as an "epicist of the female experience".&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt; Thelma J. Shinn wrote in her book, ''Worlds Within Women: Myth and Mythmaking in Fantastic Literature by Women'', that Lessing's history of humanity in ''Shikasta'' is "pessimistic" but "convincing".{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=52}} ''Infinity Plus'' described ''Shikasta'' as a "mainstream novel that uses SF ideas", and said that while Lessing was not able to predict the fall of the Soviet Union and the impact of computers, the novel "barely seems dated" because of her "cunningly non-specific" approach.&lt;ref name=Hammersley/&gt;

James Schellenberg writing in ''Challenging Destiny'', a Canadian science fiction and fantasy magazine, was impressed by ''Shikasta''{{'s}} "grand sense of perspective" and the context of humanity set in a "vaster scale of civilization and right-thinking".&lt;ref name=Schellenberg/&gt; He liked the concept of SOWF as a "metaphor of community connectedness", but felt it was an unusual way to build a [[utopia]].&lt;ref name=Schellenberg/&gt; The book's fractured storytelling leads to Lessing breaking the "famous dictum of writing – show, don't tell", and while that may work in certain circumstances, Schellenberg felt that that approach does not work very well in ''Shikasta''.&lt;ref name=Schellenberg/&gt; The [[online magazine]] ''Journey to the Sea'' found Lessing's inclusion of stories from the [[Hebrew Bible]] "entertaining and intriguing", and said she challenges the logical thinker's rejection of these [[Religious text|sacred texts]], suggesting that it is "imaginatively possible" that they could be true.&lt;ref name=Hoyt/&gt;

Following Lessing's death in 2013, ''[[The Guardian]]'' put ''Shikasta'' in their list of the top five Lessing books.&lt;ref name=Guardian-top5/&gt;

{{Thermodynamics|laws}}
The third [[Laws of thermodynamics|law of thermodynamics]] is sometimes stated as follows, regarding the properties of closed systems in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]:
{{quote|The [[entropy]] of a system approaches a constant value as its temperature approaches [[absolute zero]].|sign=|source=}}
This constant value cannot depend on any other parameters characterizing the closed system, such as pressure or applied magnetic field. At absolute zero (zero [[kelvin]]) the system must be in a state with the minimum possible energy. Entropy is related to the number of accessible [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]]s, and there is typically one unique state (called the [[ground state]]) with minimum energy.&lt;ref&gt;J. Wilks ''The Third Law of Thermodynamics'' Oxford University Press (1961).{{page needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In such a case, the entropy at absolute zero will be exactly zero. If the system does not have a well-defined order (if its order is [[Amorphous solid|glassy]], for example), then there may remain some finite entropy as the system is brought to very low temperatures, either because the system becomes locked into a configuration with non-minimal energy or because the minimum energy state is non-unique. The constant value is called the [[residual entropy]] of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Kittel and Kroemer, ''Thermal Physics'' (2nd ed.), page 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The entropy is essentially a state-function meaning the inherent value of different atoms, molecules, and other configurations of particles including subatomic or atomic material is defined by entropy, which can be discovered near 0 Kelvin.

The Nernst–Simon statement of the third law of thermodynamics concerns thermodynamic processes at a fixed, low temperature:
{{quote|The entropy change associated with any condensed system undergoing a reversible isothermal process approaches zero as the temperature at which it is performed approaches 0 K.}}
Here a condensed system refers to liquids and solids.

A classical formulation by Nernst (actually a consequence of the Third Law) is:
{{quote|It is impossible for any process, no matter how idealized, to reduce the entropy of a system to its absolute-zero value in a finite number of operations.&lt;ref&gt;Wilks, J. (1971). The Third Law of Thermodynamics, Chapter 6 in ''Thermodynamics'', volume 1, ed. W. Jost, of H. Eyring, D. Henderson, W. Jost, ''Physical Chemistry. An Advanced Treatise'', Academic Press, New York, page 477.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There also exists a formulation of the Third Law which approaches the subject by postulating a specific energy behavior:
{{quote|If the composite of two thermodynamic systems constitutes an isolated system, then any energy exchange in any form between those two systems is bounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.aop.2016.07.031 |title=Bounded energy exchange as an alternative to the third law of thermodynamics |year=2016 |last1=Heidrich |first1=M. |journal=Annals of Physics |volume=373 |pages=665–681|bibcode=2016AnPhy.373..665H|url=https://zenodo.org/record/999547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
The 3rd law was developed by the chemist [[Walther Nernst]] during the years 1906–12, and is therefore often referred to as '''Nernst's theorem''' or '''Nernst's postulate'''. The third law of thermodynamics states that the [[entropy (classical thermodynamics)|entropy]] of a system at [[absolute zero]] is a well-defined constant. This is because a system at zero temperature exists in its [[ground state]], so that its entropy is determined only by the [[degenerate energy level|degeneracy]] of the ground state.

In 1912 Nernst stated the law thus: "It is impossible for any procedure to lead to the isotherm {{math|''T'' {{=}} 0}} in a finite number of steps."&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994). ''A Survey of Thermodynamics'', American Institute of Physics, New York, {{ISBN|0-88318-797-3}}, page 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative version of the third law of thermodynamics as stated by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Merle Randall]] in 1923:
:If the entropy of each element in some (perfect) crystalline state be taken as zero at the absolute zero of temperature, every substance has a finite positive entropy; but at the absolute zero of temperature the entropy may become zero, and does so become in the case of perfect crystalline substances.

This version states not only Δ''S'' will reach zero at 0 K, but S itself will also reach zero as long as the crystal has a ground state with only one configuration. Some crystals form defects which cause a residual entropy. This residual entropy disappears when the kinetic barriers to transitioning to one ground state are overcome.&lt;ref name="Residual Entropy and the Third Law"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3390/e10030274 |title=Residual Entropy, the Third Law and Latent Heat |year=2008 |last1=Kozliak |first1=Evguenii |first2=Frank L. |last2=Lambert |journal=Entropy |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=274–84 |bibcode=2008Entrp..10..274K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of [[statistical mechanics]], the third law of thermodynamics (like the other laws) changed from a ''fundamental'' law (justified by experiments) to a ''derived'' law (derived from even more basic laws). The basic law from which it is primarily derived is the statistical-mechanics definition of entropy for a large system:
:&lt;math&gt; S - S_0 = k_\text{B} \ln \, \Omega \ &lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' is entropy, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]]s consistent with the macroscopic configuration. The counting of states is from the reference state of absolute zero, which corresponds to the entropy of S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Explanation==
In simple terms, the third law states that the entropy of a perfect crystal of a pure substance approaches zero as the temperature approaches zero. The alignment of a perfect crystal leaves no ambiguity as to the location and orientation of each part of the crystal. As the energy of the crystal is reduced, the vibrations of the individual atoms are reduced to nothing, and the crystal becomes the same everywhere.

[[File:Figure Showing Entropy at 0 K.png|thumb|a) Single possible configuration for a system at absolute zero, i.e., only one microstate is accessible. Thus S = k ln W = 0. b) At temperatures greater than absolute zero, multiple microstates are accessible due to atomic vibration (exaggerated in the figure). Since the number of accessible microstates is greater than 1, S = k ln W &gt; 0.]]

The third law provides an absolute reference point for the determination of entropy at any other temperature. The entropy of a closed system, determined relative to this zero point, is then the ''absolute'' entropy of that system.  Mathematically, the absolute entropy of any system at zero temperature is the natural log of the number of ground states times [[boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]] {{nowrap|1=''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|1.38|e=-23|u=J K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}.

The entropy of a ''perfect'' crystal lattice as defined by Nernst's theorem is zero provided that its ground state is unique, because {{nowrap|1=ln(1) = 0}}. If the system is composed of one-billion atoms, all alike, and lie within the matrix of a perfect crystal, the number of [[combinations]] of one-billion identical things taken one-billion at a time is Ω = 1. Hence:

:&lt;math&gt;S - S_0 = k_\text{B} \ln\Omega = k_\text{B}\ln{1} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The difference is zero, hence the initial entropy S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be any selected value so long as all other such calculations include that as the initial entropy. As a result, the initial entropy value of zero is selected {{nowrap|1=S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} is used for convenience.

:&lt;math&gt;S - S_0 = S - 0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S = 0&lt;/math&gt;

===Example : Entropy change of a crystal lattice heated by an incoming photon===
Suppose a system consisting of a crystal lattice with volume V of N identical atoms at T= 0 K, and an incoming photon of wavelength λ and  energy ε. 

Initially, there is only one accessible microstate :

&lt;math&gt;S_0 = k_\text{B} \ln\Omega = k_\text{B}\ln{1} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; .

Let's assume the crystal lattice absorbs the incoming photon. There is a unique atom in the lattice that interacts and absorbs this photon. So after absorption, there is N possible microstates accessible by the system, each of the microstates corresponding to one excited atom, and the other atoms remaining at ground state.

The entropy, energy, and temperature of the closed system rises and can be calculated. The entropy change is:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S = S - S_{0} = k_\text{B} \ln{\Omega} &lt;/math&gt;

From the second law of thermodynamics:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S = S - S_0 = \frac{\delta Q}{T} &lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S = S - S_0 = k_\text{B} \ln(\Omega) = \frac{ \delta Q}{T} &lt;/math&gt;

Calculating entropy change:

&lt;math&gt;S - 0 = k_\text{B} \ln{N} = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times \ln{(3 \times 10^{22}) } = 70 \times 10^{-23}\,\mathrm{J}\,\mathrm{K}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

We assume N = 3.10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; and λ = 1 cm . The energy change of the system as a result of absorbing the single photon whose energy is ε:

&lt;math&gt; \delta Q = \epsilon = \frac {hc}{\lambda} =\frac{6.62 \times 10^{-34}\,\mathrm{J}\cdot \mathrm{s} \times 3 \times 10^{8} \,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.01 \,\mathrm{m}}=2 \times 10^{-23} \,\mathrm{J}&lt;/math&gt;

The temperature of the closed system rises by:

&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\epsilon}{\Delta S} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-23}\,\mathrm{J}}{70 \times 10^{-23}\,\mathrm{J}\,\mathrm{K}^{-1}} = 0.02857 K &lt;/math&gt;

This can be interpreted as the average temperature of the system over the range from &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; S &lt; 70 \times 10^{-23}\,\mathrm{J}\,\mathrm{K}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds and Perkins|title=Engineering Thermodynamics|year=1977|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=978-0-07-052046-2|pages=438}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A single atom was assumed to absorb the photon but the temperature and entropy change characterizes the entire system.

===Systems with non-zero entropy at absolute zero===

An example of a system which does not have a unique ground state is one whose net [[Spin (physics)|spin]] is a half-integer, for which [[time-reversal symmetry]] gives two degenerate ground states.  For such systems, the entropy at zero temperature is at least k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;*ln(2) (which is negligible on a macroscopic scale). Some crystalline systems exhibit [[geometrical frustration]], where the structure of the crystal lattice prevents the emergence of a unique ground state. Ground-state helium (unless under pressure) remains liquid.

In addition, glasses and solid solutions retain large entropy at 0 K, because they are large collections of nearly degenerate states, in which they become trapped out of equilibrium. Another example of a solid with many nearly-degenerate ground states, trapped out of equilibrium, is [[ice Ih]], which has [[Ice Ih#Proton disorder|"proton disorder"]].

For the entropy at absolute zero to be zero, the magnetic moments of a perfectly ordered crystal must themselves be perfectly ordered; from an entropic perspective, this can be considered to be part of the definition of a "perfect crystal". Only [[ferromagnetic]], [[antiferromagnetic]], and [[diamagnetic]] materials can satisfy this condition. However, ferromagnetic materials do not, in fact, have zero entropy at zero temperature, because the spins of the unpaired electrons are all aligned and this gives a ground-state spin degeneracy. Materials that remain paramagnetic at 0 K, by contrast, may have many nearly-degenerate ground states (for example, in a [[spin glass]]), or may retain dynamic disorder (a [[quantum spin liquid]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Right: An infinite number of steps is needed since ''S''(0,''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)= ''S''(0,''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).]]

===Absolute zero===

The third law is equivalent to the statement that
:"It is impossible by any procedure, no matter how idealized, to reduce the temperature of any closed system to zero temperature in a finite number of finite operations".&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward A. Guggenheim|Guggenheim, E.A.]] (1967). ''Thermodynamics. An Advanced Treatment for Chemists and Physicists'', fifth revised edition, North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam, page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason that ''T''=0 cannot be reached according to the third law is explained as follows: Suppose that the temperature of a substance can be reduced in an isentropic process by changing the parameter ''X'' from ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. One can think of a multistage [[nuclear demagnetization]] setup where a magnetic field is switched on and off in a controlled way.&lt;ref&gt;F. Pobell, Matter and Methods at Low Temperatures, (Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2007){{page needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there were an entropy difference at absolute zero, ''T''=0 could be reached in a finite number of steps. However, at ''T''=0 there is no entropy difference so an infinite number of steps would be needed. The process is illustrated in Fig.1.

===Specific heat===
A non-quantitative description of his third law that Nernst gave at the very beginning was simply that the specific heat can always be made zero by cooling the material down far enough.&lt;ref&gt;''Einstein and the Quantum'', A. Douglas Stone, Princeton University Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A modern, quantitative analysis follows.

Supposed that the heat capacity of a sample in the low temperature region has the form of a power law ''C''(''T,X'')=''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; asymptotically as ''T''→0, and we wish to find which values of α are compatible with the third law. We have
{| width=400px
| &lt;math&gt;\int_{T_0}^T \frac {C(T^\prime,X)}{T^\prime}dT^\prime = \frac {C_0}{ \alpha}(T^{ \alpha}-T_0^{ \alpha}).&lt;/math&gt;
| style="text-align:right"|(11) 
|}
By the discussion of third law (above), this integral must be bounded as ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;→0, which is only possible if α&gt;0. So the heat capacity must go to zero at absolute zero
{| width=400px
| &lt;math&gt; \lim_{T \rightarrow 0}C(T,X)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
| style="text-align:right"|(12) 
|}
if it has the form of a power law. The same argument shows that it cannot be bounded below by a positive constant, even if we drop the power-law assumption.

On the other hand, the molar specific heat at constant volume of a monatomic classical ideal gas, such as helium at room temperature, is given by ''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;=(3/2)''R'' with ''R'' the molar ideal gas constant. But clearly a constant heat capacity does not satisfy Eq. (12). That is, a gas with a constant heat capacity all the way to absolute zero violates the third law of thermodynamics. We can verify this more fundamentally by substituting ''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; in Eq. (4), which yields
{| width=400px
| &lt;math&gt;S(T,V) = S(T_0,V) + \frac{3}{2}R \ln \frac{T}{T_0}.&lt;/math&gt;
| style="text-align:right"|(13) 
|}
In the limit {{nowrap|''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; → 0}} this expression diverges, again contradicting the third law of thermodynamics.

The conflict is resolved as follows: At a certain temperature the quantum nature of matter starts to dominate the behavior. Fermi particles follow [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] and Bose particles follow [[Bose–Einstein statistics]]. In both cases the heat capacity at low temperatures is no longer temperature independent, even for ideal gases. For Fermi gases
{| width=400px
| &lt;math&gt;C_V = \frac{ \pi^2}{2}R \frac{T}{T_\text{F}}&lt;/math&gt;
| style="text-align:right"|(14) 
|}
with the Fermi temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; given by
{| width=400px
| &lt;math&gt;T_\text{F} = \frac{1}{8 \pi^2}\frac{N_\text{A}^2h^2}{MR}\left( \frac{3\pi^2N_\text{A}}{V_\text{m}}\right)^{2/3}. &lt;/math&gt;
| style="text-align:right"|(15) 
|}
Here ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is Avogadro's number, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; the molar volume, and ''M'' the molar mass.

For Bose gases
{| width=400px
| &lt;math&gt;C_V=1.93..R\left( \frac{T}{T_\text{B}}\right)^{3/2} &lt;/math&gt;
| style="text-align:right"|(16) 
|}
with ''T''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; given by
{| width=400px
| &lt;math&gt;T_\text{B} = \frac{1}{11.9..}\frac{N_\text{A}^2h^2}{MR}\left( \frac{N_\text{A}}{V_\text{m}}\right)^{2/3}. &lt;/math&gt;
| style="text-align:right"|(17) 
|}
The specific heats given by Eq.(14) and (16) both satisfy Eq.(12). Indeed, they are power laws with α=1 and α=3/2 respectively.

Even within a purely classical setting, the density of a classical ideal gas at fixed particle number becomes arbitrarily high as ''T'' goes to zero, so the interparticle spacing goes to zero. The assumption of non-interacting particles presumably breaks down when they are sufficiently close together, so the value of &lt;math&gt;C_V&lt;/math&gt; gets modified away from its ideal constant value.

===Vapor pressure===
The only liquids near absolute zero are ³He and ⁴He. Their heat of evaporation has a limiting value given by
{| width=400px
| &lt;math&gt;L=L_0+C_pT&lt;/math&gt;
| style="text-align:right"|(18) 
|}
with ''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; constant. If we consider a container, partly filled with liquid and partly gas, the entropy of the liquid–gas mixture is

{| width=400px
| &lt;math&gt;S(T,x) = S_l(T)+x(\frac{L_0}{T}+C_p)&lt;/math&gt;
| style="text-align:right"|(19) 
|}
where ''S''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;(T) is the entropy of the liquid and ''x'' is the gas fraction. Clearly the entropy change during the liquid–gas transition (''x'' from 0 to 1) diverges in the limit of ''T''→0. This violates Eq.(8). Nature solves this paradox as follows: at temperatures below about 50 mK the vapor pressure is so low that the gas density is lower than the best vacuum in the universe. In other words: below 50 mK there is simply no gas above the liquid.

===Latent heat of melting===
The melting curves of ³He and ⁴He both extend down to absolute zero at finite pressure. At the melting pressure, liquid and solid are in equilibrium. The third law demands that the entropies of the solid and liquid are equal at ''T''=0. As a result, the latent heat of melting is zero and the slope of the melting curve extrapolates to zero as a result of the [[Clausius–Clapeyron equation]].

===Thermal expansion coefficient===
The thermal expansion coefficient is defined as

{| width=400px
| &lt;math&gt;\alpha_V = \frac{1}{V_m} \left(\frac{\part V_m}{\part T}\right)_{p}.&lt;/math&gt;
| style="text-align:right"|(20) 
|}
With the [[Maxwell relation]]
{| width=400px
| &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\part V_m}{\part T}\right)_{p}=-\left(\frac{\part S_m}{\part p}\right)_T&lt;/math&gt;
| style="text-align:right"|(21) 
|}
and Eq.(8) with ''X''=''p'' it is shown that
{| width=400px
| &lt;math&gt;\lim_{T \rightarrow 0}\alpha_V=0.&lt;/math&gt;
| style="text-align:right"|(22) 
|}
So the thermal expansion coefficient of all materials must go to zero at zero kelvin.
