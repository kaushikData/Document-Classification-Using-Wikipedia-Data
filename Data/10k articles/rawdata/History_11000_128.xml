}}'''Alfred Vincent Kidder''' (October 29, 1885 – June 11, 1963) was an American [[archaeologist]] considered the foremost of the [[southwestern United States]] and [[Mesoamerica]] during the first half of the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} He saw a disciplined system of archaeological techniques as a means to extend the principles of [[anthropology]] into the prehistoric past and so was the originator of the first comprehensive, systematic approach to North American archaeology.

==Early life==
Born in [[Marquette, Michigan]], Kidder was the son of a mining engineer.  He entered [[Harvard College]] with the intention of qualifying for medical school, but found himself uninspired by premedical courses. He applied for a summer job in archaeology with the [[University of Utah]] in 1907. Kidder spent two successive summers in the mesa and canyon country of southwestern [[Colorado]], southeastern [[Utah]] and areas of [[New Mexico]]. Kidder and Jesse L. Nusbaum (later Superintendent of [[Mesa Verde National Park]]), came to the Mesa Verde area with ethnologist [[J. Walter Fewkes|Jesse Walter Fewkes]] to conduct an archaeological survey and to photograph ruins.  He obtained his bachelor's degree at Harvard in 1908 and a doctorate in anthropology in 1914.

==Archaeological career==
Kidder then embarked on a series of expeditions to the Southwest, many in northeastern [[Arizona]]. These expeditions were sponsored by Harvard’s [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] and the associated [[Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology]] at Phillips Academy in [[Andover, Massachusetts]].

From 1915 to 1929, Kidder conducted site excavations at an abandoned pueblo near [[Pecos, New Mexico]], now the [[Pecos National Historical Park]]. He excavated levels of human occupation at the pueblo going back more than 2000 years, and gathered a detailed record of cultural artifacts, including a large collection of [[pottery]] fragments and human remains. From these items, he was able to establish a continuous record of pottery styles from 2000 years ago to the mid-to-late 19th century. Kidder then analyzed trends and changes in pottery styles in association with changes in the Pecos people’s culture and established a basic chronology for the Southwest. With [[Samuel J. Guernsey]], he established the validity of a chronological approach to cultural periods.{{efn| 1= Samuel J. Guernsey later became Curator of Archaeology at the Peabody Museum.&lt;ref name=guernsey&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Kidder asserted that deductions about the development of human culture could be obtained through a systematic examination of stratigraphy and chronology in archaeological sites.  This research laid the foundation for modern archaeological field methods, shifting the emphasis from a "gentlemanly adventure" adding items such as whole pots and cliff dwellings to museum coffers to the study of potsherds and other artifacts in relation to the cultural history. Pioneering archaeologists in other regions of the United States completed the transformation of professional methodology initiated by Kidder.

His ''Introduction to the Study of Southwestern Archaeology'', published in 1924, was the first synthesis of North American prehistory based on professionally recovered empirical data. In spite of his efforts at documentation, Kidder’s conclusions have sometimes been criticized for a lack of integration between his field reports and his later synthesis and interpretation of that data. However, Kidder clearly emphasized archaeology's need for a scientific "eye" in the development of fact collecting techniques and clear definitions.

In the late 1920s, Kidder started the [[Pecos conference|Pecos Conferences]] for archaeologists and ethnologists working in the American southwest. In 1927, a temporal system of [[Scientific classification|nomenclature]], known as the [[Pecos Classification]] System, was established for use in southwestern sites.  Archaeologists have since used the sequence, with later variations, to assign approximate dates to dozens of sites throughout the Southwest and to determine cultural ties and differences among them. The same year he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter K|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterK.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Kidder formally used the Navajo term "[[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Anasazi]]" to define a specific cultural group of people living in the southwest between approximately 200 BC and 1300 AD. This term had been casually used by excavators for many of the "ancient people" since the early explorations of [[Richard Wetherill]], and had been informally used in the work of the Pecos Conferences.

As an associate in charge of archaeological investigations (1927–29) and as chairman of the division of historical research (1929–50) at the [[Carnegie Institution]], Kidder conducted a broad-scale multidisciplinary research program in [[Kaminaljuyu]] in the [[Guatemala]]n highlands which established the framework of [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|stratigraphy]]. In 1939 he became honorary curator of Southwestern American archaeology at the Peabody Museum, Harvard.

In 1951, Kidder, in discussions with [[Thomas Stuart Ferguson]] and [[Gordon Willey]] of Harvard University, was instrumental in establishing a foundation dealing with the status of archaeology in [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]].  In regard to those discussions, Ferguson wrote that the three scholars agreed ''“...it was unfortunate that so little work was being carried on in so important an area and that something should be done to increase explorations and excavations....Despite the amazing discoveries made between 1930 and 1950, work on the Pre-Classic was virtually at a standstill in 1951. The result of the discussion was that we agreed to set up a new organization to be devoted to the Pre-Classic civilizations of Mexico and Central America—the earliest known high cultures of the New World.''”  The following year, the [[New World Archaeological Foundation]] (NWAF) was incorporated in California, as a nonprofit, scientific, fact-finding body.

==Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation==
During Kidder’s studies and excavations at Pecos Pueblo, particularly between 1915 and 1929, pottery and other artifacts were sent to the Robert S. Peabody Museum, Andover, Massachusetts, while excavated human remains were sent to the Peabody Museum at Harvard. In the early 20th century, no archaeologist consulted with Native American descendants concerning the excavation of their ancestors' homes and graves. Although Kidder was aware of the long-standing relationship between the abandoned Pecos Pueblo and the modern [[Pueblo of Jemez]], he did not consider that any local population had a claim on artifacts and remains.

By a 1936 Act of Congress, the Pueblo of Jemez became the legal and administrative representative of the Pueblo of Pecos, which had been privately owned during Kidder’s excavation. As a consequence of The [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA), which requires federal and other museum facilities to inventory, establish cultural affiliations, and publish in the [[Federal Register]] any and all Native American human remains and certain objects in their possession, the Pueblo of Jemez made a formal claim on behalf of the Pecos people. This repatriation was primarily due to the efforts of [[William J. Whatley]], the Jemez Pueblo tribal archaeologist, who searched through museum records for these remains and artifacts for eight years. The human remains from Kidder’s excavations were returned to the Jemez people in 1999 and ritually reburied at Pecos National Historic Park. In a sense, they rejoined Kidder, as he is buried on a hillside not far away, close to Pecos Pueblo.

==Family life==
Although her name rarely occurred on publications, Kidder's wife Madeleine worked as an archaeologist alongside her husband.&lt;ref name=kidder1 /&gt; Kidder's grandson, [[Tristram Randolph Kidder|T.R. Kidder]] is a noted archaeologist of the southeastern United States.

'''Badan Warisan Malaysia''' (''Malaysian Heritage Trust'') is a [[NGO|non-government organisation]] formed in 1983, concerned with the [[conservation-restoration|conservation]] and preservation of [[Malaysia|Malaysia's]] built heritage. It is a voluntary organisation with [[tax-exempt]] charity status.&lt;ref name="formation" /&gt;

Members of Badan Warisan Malaysia have been involved in the preservation of significant built heritage structures and sites throughout [[Malaysia]] including Rumah Bomoh and Rumah Kutai in [[Perak]], Gedung Raja Abdullah in [[Kelang]], Istana Tengku Long in [[Terengganu]], Mesjid Merbok Pengkalan Kakap in [[Kedah]], the [[Central Market, Kuala Lumpur|Central Market]] and Rumah Penghulu (Village Head house) in [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref name="preservation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/kuala-lumpur/museums/badan-warisan-malaysia |title=Badan Warisan Malaysia-Museums-KL City Centre |publisher=Time Out |date= 30 May 2014 |accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The secretariat for Badan Warisan Malaysia is located on Jalan Stonor in [[Kuala Lumpur]], in a colonial bungalow which was restored and adapted in 1995 as a Heritage Centre with exhibition, seminar, specialist resource centre and meeting facilities.&lt;ref name="formation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/malaysia/kuala-lumpur/sights/architecture/badan-warisan-malaysia  |title=Badan Warisan Malaysia-SIGHTS/ARCHITECTURE |publisher=Lonely Planet |date=26 June 2011 |accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albrecht altdorfer, battaglia di isso 02.JPG|thumb|right|''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus]]'' by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]], depicting the [[Battle of Issus]], in 333 BC. Here, the battlefield is depicted as unlevel ground between mountains, in front of the [[walled city]] of [[Issus, Cilicia]]. The actual location of the battle is debated by historians.]]

A '''battlefield''', '''battleground''', or '''field of battle''' is the location of a present or historic [[battle]] involving [[ground warfare]]. It is commonly understood to be limited to the point of contact between opposing forces, though battles may involve troops covering broad geographic areas. &lt;!--Attacks on [[lines of communication]] for an army, or on its supplies of fuel at source, are separate from the "battlefield", even though they bear on the outcome.--&gt;  Although the term implies that battles are typically fought in a [[Plain|field]] – an open stretch of level ground – it applies to any type of terrain on which a battle is fought. The term can also have legal significance, and battlefields have substantial historical and cultural value—the battlefield has been described as "a place where ideals and loyalties are put to the test".&lt;ref name="Blood Red Roses"&gt;Veronica Fiorato, Anthea Boylston, Christopher Knüsel, ''Blood Red Roses: The Archaeology of a Mass Grave from the Battle of Towton AD 1461'' (2007), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Various acts and treaties restrict certain belligerent conduct to an identified battlefield. Other legal regimes promote the preservation of certain battlefields as sites of historic importance.

Modern military theory and doctrine has, with technological advances in warfare, evolved the understanding of a battlefield from one defined by terrain to a more multifaceted perception of all of the factors affecting the conduct of a battle and is conceptualised as the [[battlespace]].

==Choice of battlefields==
The occurrence of a battle at a particular location may be entirely accidental, if an [[Meeting engagement|encounter]] between hostile forces occurs with neither side having expected the encounter. Typically, however, the location is chosen deliberately, either by agreement of the two sides or, more commonly, by the commander of one side, who attempts to either initiate an attack on terrain favorable to the attack, or position forces on ground favorable to defense, if anticipating an attack.

===Agreed battlefields===
Although many battlefields arise in the course of military operations, there have been a number of occasions where formal conventions have ordained the nature and site of the battlefield.  It has been suggested, on the basis of anthropological research, that ritual warfare involving battles on traditional "fighting grounds", bound by rules to minimise casualties, may have been common among early societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Warfare|last=Keegan|first=John |authorlink=John Keegan|year=1993 |publisher=Hutchinson |location=London |isbn=0091745276|pages=98–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Middle Ages, formal pre-arrangement of a battlefield occasionally occurred. The [[Vikings]] had the concept of the "hazelled field", where an agreed site was marked out with [[hazel]] rods in advance of the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Viking Art of War |last= Paddy|first=Griffith |authorlink=Paddy Griffith |year=1995 |publisher=Greenhill Books |location=London |isbn=1853672084 |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal arrangements by armies to meet one another on a certain day and date were a feature of Western Medieval warfare, often related to the conventions of [[siege]] warfare. This arrangement was known as a ''journée''.  Conventionally, the battlefield had to be considered a fair one, not greatly advantaging one side or the other.  Arrangements could be very specific about where the battle should take place.  For example, at the siege of Grancey in 1434, it was agreed that the armies would meet at "the place above Guiot Rigoigne's house on the right side towards Sentenorges, where there are two trees".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Laws of War in the Late Middle Ages|last=Keen |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Keen |year=1965|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |location=London |isbn= |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[pitched battle]], although the battlefield is not formally agreed upon, either side can choose to withdraw rather than engaging in the battle. The occurrence of the battle therefore generally reflects the belief by both sides that the battlefield and other circumstances are advantageous for their side.

=== Geography and the choice of battlefield ===
[[File:Battle of Marston Moor, 1644.png|thumb|right|Painting of the [[Battle of Marston Moor]] during the [[First English Civil War]], 1644. The location and scope of the battlefield were dictated by previous chance decisions on the part of the combatants.]]
[[File:Kitchener and Birdwood at Russells Top Anzac.jpg|thumb|right|Field Marshal [[Horatio Herbert Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] and Lieutenant-General [[William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood|William Birdwood]] viewing the [[Anzac]] battlefield from Russell's Top during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], 15 November 1915.]]

Some locations are chosen for certain features giving advantage to one side or another. 

In the 1820s, General Joseph Rogiat, of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s ''[[Grande Armée]]'', spoke at great length of the circumstances that make for a good battlefield. He divided the battlefield in two: one favorable for attack and one for defense, and argued that the greater the benefit of one over the other, the stronger a position was.&lt;ref name="Rogniat"&gt;Joseph Rogniat (général de division), quoted in ''The United Service Journal and Naval and Military Magazine'' (1829), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say that easy movement of troops to the front, and distribution of forces across the front, was also important, since this allowed support and reinforcement as needed. He mentions the high ground as a means of observing the enemy, and concealing friendly forces;&lt;ref name="Rogniat"&gt;Joseph Rogniat (général de division), quoted in ''The United Service Journal and Naval and Military Magazine'' (1829), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; while this has been mitigated by [[aerial reconnaissance]], improved communication ([[field telephone]] and [[radio]]), and [[indirect fire]], it remains important. (For instance, "hull down" firing positions for tanks were desired well into [[World War Two]].)

Rogiat also discussed cover, in reference to exposure to cannon fire; in earlier times, it would have been to [[Sling (weapon)|slinger]]s (in Ancient Greek and Roman times) or [[archery|archer]]s (such as the Welsh [[longbow]]men or Mongol [[Mounted archery|horse archer]]s) from ancient times well into the 1400s, while slightly later, it would be to [[rifle]]men.&lt;!-- See also:  Bar-Kochva, Bezalel.

The Hundred Years War:  The English in France 1337-1453.   New York:  Atheneum, 1978.&lt;ref name="Rogniat"&gt;Joseph Rogniat (général de division), quoted in ''The United Service Journal and Naval and Military Magazine'' (1829), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; (Rogiat did not suggest switching from column to [[open order]] to compensate, and it would be almost a century before a technological solution was conceived.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, Gwynn.  War.  New York:  Crown Publishers, 1985; or Dupuy, Trevor N. 'The Evolution of Weapons and Warfare.  Indianapolis, IN:  Bobbs-Merrill, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This may be a bit OT.--&gt;)

Rogniat describes a "disadvantageous field of battle" as one:

{{quote|which is everywhere seen and commanded from heights within cannon and musket shot, and which is encumbered with marshes, rivers, ravines, and defiles of every kind. The enemy moves upon it with difficulty, even in column; he cannot deploy for the contest, and is made to suffer under a shower of projectiles without being able to return evil for evil.&lt;ref name="Rogniat"/&gt;}}

This may be called an ideal defensive position, however. He then advises that troops should be situated so that the ground they defend is favorable, while the ground through which the enemy must advance is unfavorable:&lt;!--Rewrite the quote to paraphrase; only quote what ''cannot'' be said better--&gt;

{{quote|A position which combines these two kinds of fields of battle is doubly strong, both by its situation, and by the obstacles which cover it. But if it fulfils only one of these conditions, it ceases to be easy of defence. Suppose that a position, for instance, offers to the defenders a field of battle well situated, but admitting of easy access upon all points; the assailants, finding no obstacle to their deployment for the contest, will be able to force it in a tolerably short time. Suppose another position presents to the assailants a field of battle abounding with obstacles and defiles, but without offering at the same time, in the rear, favourable ground for the deployment of the defenders; these could then only act upon it with difficulty, and would be forced to fight the assailants in the defiles themselves, without any advantage.

In general, the best positions are those, the flanks of which are inaccessible, and which command from their front a gently inclined ground, favourable for attack as well as defence; farther, if the lines lean on villages and woods, each of which forms, by its saliency, a sort of defensive bastion, the army becomes almost impregnable, without being reduced to inaction.&lt;ref name="Rogniat"/&gt;}} During World War One, for instance, the [[An Nafud]] behind Aqaba seemed impassible, until a force of Arab rebels led by [[T. E. Lawrence]] successfully crossed it to [[Battle of Aqaba|capture the town]]. In World War Two, the [[Pinsk Marshes|Pripyat Marsh]] was an obstacle to vehicles, and the [[Red Army]] successfully employed cavalry there specifically because of that, while in North Africa, the [[Qattara Depression]] was used as an "anchor" for a defensive line.&lt;!--The Qattara could be in Corelli, or Irving's book on Rommel; the Sov cav, I have no idea...but I've seen it somewhere--&gt;

The belief that a location is impregnable will lead to it being chosen for a defensive position, but may produce complacency. During the Jewish Rebellion in 70 AD, [[Masada]] was thought to be unassailable; determined Roman [[military engineering]] showed it was not.&lt;!--Josephus tells the tale, but he also claims there was mass suicide, which is false--&gt; In World War One, Aqaba was considered safe. During World War Two, [[Battle for Monte la Difensa|''Monte la Difensa'']] was revealed to be vulnerable by the [[First Special Service Force]]. (All three instances would later be used in films.)&lt;!--I'm not sure this is on point for this section; especially not sure mention in film is apt.--&gt;

Crossing obstacles remains a problem. Even a seemingly open field, such as that faced by [[Pickett's charge|George Pickett]] at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], was broken by fences which had to be climbed—while his division was constantly exposed to fire from the moment it left the trees.&lt;!--That's in Dupuy, I think; maybe in Seymour, William.  Yours to Reason Why:  Decision in Battle.  New York:  St. Martin's Press, 1982.--&gt; On modern battlefields, introducing obstacles to slow an advance has risen to an art form: everything from [[Anti-tank trench|anti-tank ditch]]es to [[barbed wire]] to [[Dragon's teeth (fortification)|dragon's teeth]] to [[Booby trap|improvised device]]s,&lt;!--like those on the beaches of Normandie 6 June '44--&gt; have been employed, in addition to [[minefield]]s.{{cn|date=July 2017}} The nature of the battlefield influences the tactics used; in Vietnam, heavy jungle favored ambush.

Historically, military forces have sometimes trained using methods suitable for a level battlefield, but not for the terrain in which they were likely to end up fighting. [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] illustrated the problem for the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], whose [[Phalanx|phalanges]] were ill-suited for combat except on level ground without trees, watercourses, ditches, or other obstacles that might break up its files,&lt;ref&gt;Philip Sabin, Hans van Wees, Michael Whitby, ''The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare'' (2007), p. &lt;/ref&gt; a perfection rarely obtained.&lt;!--Did this influence the development of the [[manipular legion]]?--&gt; [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] had the same preference.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Sabin, Hans van Wees, Michael Whitby, ''The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare'' (2007), p. &lt;/ref&gt; By the 20th Century, many military organizations had specialist units, trained to fight in particular geographic areas, like mountains (Alpine units), desert (such as the [[Long Range Desert Group|LRDG]]), or jungle (such as Britain's [[Chindits]] and later U.S. [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]]), or on skis. Others were trained for delivery by aircraft ([[air portable]]), [[Glider infantry|glider]], or parachute ([[Airborne forces|airborne]]); after the development of helicopters, [[airmobile]] forces developed. The increasing number of [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]]s, and their particular hazards and problems, led to the development of [[Frogman|frogmen]] (and later [[United States Navy SEALs|SeAL]]s). These specialist forces opened up new fields of battle, and added new complexities to both attack and defense: when the battlefield ceased to be physically connected to the supply base, as at Arnhem, or in Burma, or in Vietnam, the geography of the battlefield could not only dictate how a battle was fought, but with what weapons, and both reinforcement and logistics could be critical. At Arnhem, for instance, there were failures in both, while in Burma, aerial supply deliveries enabled the Chindits to do something that would otherwise have been impossible. Armies generally avoided fighting in cities, when possible, and modern armies dislike giving up the freedom of maneuver; as a result, when compelled to fight for control of a city, such as [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] or [[Battle of Ortona|Ortona]], weapons, tactics, and training are ill-suited for the environment. Urban combat is the one specialty that has not yet arisen.&lt;!--This is feeling like it's getting off-point...especially for this section. Also, not sure pre-modern armies avoided city fights. As for sourcing... There's got to be at least one good book on the Chindits that mentions the importance of the airdrops; ''A Bridge too Far'' covers the Arnhem issues. Sources from the Dieppe &amp; D-day pages should back up the frogman use, &amp; sources from there, the evo to SeAL. Do we need cites for the existence of specialized troops?--&gt;

=== Technology and the choice of battlefield ===
New technologies also affect where battles are fought. The adoption of [[chariot]]s makes flat, open battlefields desirable, and larger fields than for infantry alone, as well as offering opportunities to engage an enemy sooner. 

During the American Civil War, rail transport influenced where  and how battles would be, could be, fought, as did telegraphic communication.&lt;!--''Civil War in the American West'', for a start; also, there's an interesting book on CSA railways--&gt; This was a major factor in the execution of the German invasion of France in WW1: German forces could only travel as far from railheads as their ability to transport fodder allowed; the ambitious plan was doomed before it launched.&lt;!--I've seen that somewhere...--&gt; Single battles, such as [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]], can depend on the inception of new technology, such as (in this instance) [[tank]]s.{{cn|date=July 2017}}&lt;!--Dupuy &amp; Dyer can probably support this--&gt;

The synergy between technologies can also affect where battles take place. The arrival of aerial reconnaissance has been credited with the development of [[trench warfare]], while the combination of [[high explosive]]s in ammunition and hydraulic recoil mechanisms in artillery, added to aircraft observation, made its subsequent spread necessary, and contributed to the stalemate of WW1.&lt;!--See Dupuy; maybe Dyer, too--&gt; The proliferation of tanks and aircraft changed the dynamics again in WW2.

[[File:UH-1D helicopters airlift members of the 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment from the Filhol Rubber Plantation area... - NARA - 530610.tif|thumb|left|UH-1D helicopters airlift members of the 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment from the Filhol Rubber Plantation area... - NARA - 530610]]In both Burma in World War Two, and in Vietnam, air supply played an important part in where battles took place. Some, such as [[Battle of Arnhem|Arnhem]] or [[Battle of A Sau|the A Sầu]], would not have happened at all, absent the development of aircraft and helicopters.{{cn|date=July 2017}}&lt;!--Dupuy &amp; Dyer can probably support this--&gt; So, too, has the introduction of [[landing craft]]; combined with naval gunfire support, they have made beach landings the site of battles, where, in ancient times, the very idea of contesting a landing was unheard of.&lt;!--In Dyer or Dupuy? Or one of the Greek/Spartan sources?--&gt;

The Vietnamese preference for ambush against a more sophisticated opponent was a function of less access to sophisticated technology.

As much as technology has changed, terrain still cannot be ignored, because it not only affects movement on the battlefield, but movement to and from it, and [[logistics]] are critical: a battlefield, in the industrial age, may be a railway line or a highway&lt;!-- Or a bomber or fighter base...--&gt; As technology grows more sophisticated, the length of the "tail", upon which the troops at the front depend, gets longer, and the number of places a battle can be decided (beyond the immediate point of contact) grows.

===Legal implications===
{{main|Law of war}}
The concept of the battlefield arises at various points in the [[law of war]], the international law and custom governing geographic restrictions on the use of force, taking of prisoners of war and the treatment afforded to them, and seizure of enemy property. With respect to the seizure of property, it has been noted that in ancient times it was understood that a prevailing enemy was free to take whatever was left on the battlefield by a fleeing enemy—weapons, armor, equipment, food, treasure—although, customarily, "capture of booty may take place some distance from the battlefield; it may transpire a few days after the battle, and it may even occur in the total absence of any pitched battle".&lt;ref&gt;Yoram Dinstein, "Booty in Warfare", in Frauke Lachenmann, Rüdiger Wolfrum, editors, ''The Law of Armed Conflict and the Use of Force: The Max Planck Encyclopedia'' (2015), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic battlefields==
[[File:'Bloody Ridge' As Seen During a Tour of the Famed World War II Battlefield by Secretary Kerry.jpg|thumb|right|Location of the [[World War II]] [[Battle of Edson's Ridge]] in the [[Solomon Islands]], 12–14 September 1942, as seen when toured by U.S. Secretary of State [[John Kerry]], 13 August 2014.]]
===Location===
The locations of ancient battles can be apocryphal. In England, this information has been more reliably recorded since the time of the Norman conquest.&lt;ref name="Blood Red Roses"/&gt; Battles are usually named after some feature of the battlefield [[geography]], such as the name of a town, forest or river, commonly prefixed "Battle of...", but the name may poorly reflect the actual location of the event. Where documentary sources describe a battle, "whether such references are contemporary or reliable needs to be assessed with care".&lt;ref name="Blood Red Roses"/&gt; Locating battlefields is important in attempts to recreate the events of battles:

{{quote|The battlefield is a historical source demanding attention, interpretation and understanding like any written or other account. To understand a battle, one has to understand the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Battlefields:Exploring the Arenas of War 1805-1945 |editor1-last=Rayner |editor1-first=Michael|year=2006 |publisher=New Holland|location= London|isbn=978-1845371753 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Battlefield preservation===
Many battlefields from specific historic battles are preserved as historic landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States National Park Service]], ''Wilson's Creek National Battlefield: Final General Management Plan'' (2003), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The study area of a battlefield includes all places related to contributing to the battle event: where troops deployed and maneuvered before, during, and after the engagement; it is the maximum delineation of the historical site and provides more of the tactical context of a battle than does the core area. The core area of a battlefield is within the study area and includes only those places where the combat engagement and key associated actions and features were located; the core area includes, among other things, what often is described as "hallowed ground".&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War Sites Advisory Commission Report'' (1994), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A battlefield is typically the location of large numbers of deaths. Given the intensity of combat, it may not be possible to easily retrieve bodies from the battlefield leading to the observation that "[a] battlefield is a graveyard without the gravestones".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lusardi, quoted in ''Wilson's Creek National Battlefield, Draft General Management Plan'' (2003), p, 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vikings at Clontarf re-enactment.png|thumb|right|Viking re-enactors at the [[Battle of Clontarf]] millennium commemoration. Dublin, 2014.]]
===Battlefield commemoration===
Battlefields can host memorials to the battles that took place there.  These might commemorate the event itself or those who fell in the battle.  This practice has a long history.  It was common among the Ancient Greeks and Romans to raise a [[Tropaion|trophy]] on the field of battle, initially of arms stripped from the defeated enemy.  Later these trophies might be replaced by more permanent memorials in stone or bronze.&lt;ref&gt;
Jutta Stroszeck, "[https://digitalt.uib.no/bitstream/handle/1956.2/2968/Greek%20trophy%20monuments_Stroszeck.pdf Greek Trophy Monuments]," in Myth and Symbol II: Symbolic Phenomena in Ancient Greek Culture, ed. [[Synnøve des Bouvrie]], The Norwegian Institute at Athens (2004), p.303&lt;/ref&gt;

Another means by which historic battles are commemorated is [[historical reenactment]]. Such events are typically held at the location of the original battle, but if circumstances make that inconvenient, reenactors may replicate the battle in an entirely different location. For example, in 1895, members of the [[Royal Engineers|Gloucestershire Engineer Volunteers]] reenacted their famous stand at [[Battle of Rorke's Drift|Rorke's Drift]] in [[Africa]], 18 years earlier, with the reenactment occurring at the [[Cheltenham|Cheltenham Winter Gardens]] in [[England]].&lt;ref name="Giles"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.eventplan.co.uk/page29.html| title=A Brief History of Re-enactment| author=Howard Giles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented [[Korean War reenactment]] was held in [[North Vernon, Indiana]], by members of the 20th Century Tactical Studies Group portraying Canadian and North Korean troops, on March 15, 1997.&lt;ref name=test&gt;''Battle Cry'': The Newspaper of Reenacting' Vol. 3, no. 2, Summer, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1133">A '''blade mill''' was a variety of [[water mill]] used for sharpening newly fabricated [[blade]]s, including [[scythe]]s, [[sword]]s, [[sickle]]s, and [[knife|knives]].  

In the [[Sheffield]] area, they were known as cutlers wheels, scythesmiths wheels, etc.  Examples are preserved in [[Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet]].  They also existed in the 17th century and 18th century in [[Birmingham]] and in connection with the [[scythe]] industry in [[Belbroughton]] and [[Chaddesley Corbett]] in north [[Worcestershire]].  There were also small numbers in other areas of England.  

A [[water wheel]] was used to turn a grind stone, which wore down from being up to two metres in diameter to a 'cork' of a fraction of this size.  The dust generated by the process was bad for the grinder's health, and many of them died young from [[silicosis|'grinder's disease']].

'''Bongo-Bongo''' in [[linguistics]] is used as a name for an [[imaginary language]]. It is most commonly invoked in [[Etymology|etymological studies]] to conceptualize random similarities between unrelated languages.&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, R.L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used as a name for a [[constructed language]] invented by [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]] as a teaching tool in linguistics.&lt;ref name=NM&gt;Murray, N. ''Writing Essays in English Language and Linguistics: Principles, Tips and Strategies for Undergraduates'' [[Cambridge University Press]] (2012) {{ISBN|978-0521128469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymological studies==
Random similarities occur between related and unrelated languages and these are commonly disregarded in the academic study of etymology. The widespread habit of unscientific researches to look for such coincidental similarities and proclaim them as proof of genetic relationship has given rise to the term ''Bongo-Bongo approach'' or ''Bongo-Bongo effect''.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; For example, when comparing random [[Underlying representation|surface forms]] in [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (which are known to be unrelated languages), "pairings" such as ''hegi'' (Basque for "ridge") and ''hegy'' (Hungarian for "hill") are easily found but ultimately meaningless in terms of etymology without additional historical linguistic research and data.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

==Anthropology==
The concept can also be found occasionally in [[anthropology]] where the ''Bongo-Bongo'' are sarcastically used as an imaginary tribe or ethnicity (or by extension, [[Bongo Bongo Land]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kippenberg, HG (ed) ''Concepts of Person in Religion and Thought (Religion and Reason, No 37)'' [[Walter de Gruyter|de Gruyter]] (1990) {{ISBN|978-3110121599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Damero de Pizarro''' (translated into English as ''Pizarro's Checkerboard''), '''Cercado de Lima''' (''Walled Lima'') or '''Lima Cuadrada''' (''Squared Lima'') is as it is known an area of the [[Historic Centre of Lima|historic center]] of [[Lima]] (capital of [[Peru]]) located within the [[Walls of Lima|old walls of the city]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.viaja-peru.com/eng/peru-guide/lima-historical-centre.htm |title=Historical Centre of Lima City |accessdate=November 3, 2017 |last= |first= |date= |work=Viaja Perú |publisher=E-Latin Travel |location= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This zone corresponds to the foundational layout of the city.

Its current boundaries within the city are the [[Rímac River]] to the north, Abancay Avenue to the east, Colmena Avenue to the south and Tacna Avenue to the west.

It is named because it is the oldest and most central part of the city and because its urban layout maintains the classic Spanish style of streets and perpendicular avenues that form homogeneously square blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martín |first1=Eva María |last2=Nieto |first2=Aurelio |title=Territorio y Turismo Mundial |url=https://books.google.com.co/books?id=YnWnDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA396&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;dq=damero+de+pizarro&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X6adMBcEmt&amp;sig=Vou-X7nzWDRv9jiEWJcdD7BbECs&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrj8e3maPXAhVQKuwKHdTBC-g4HhDoAQgsMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=damero%20de%20pizarro&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 3, 2017 |language=spanish |edition= |year=2014 |publisher=Editorial Universitaria Ramón Areces |location=Madrid |isbn=978-84-9961-160-0 |chapter=Sudamérica |pages=395-397 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Damião de Góis''' ({{IPA-pt|dɐmiˈɐ̃w̃ dɨ ˈɡɔjʃ}}) (February 2, 1502{{snd}}January 30, 1574), born in [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer]], [[Portugal]], was an important Portuguese [[Humanism|humanist]] [[philosopher]]. He was a friend and student of [[Erasmus]]. He was appointed [[secretary]] to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]] in 1523 by King [[John III of Portugal]]. He compiled one of the first accounts on [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Christianity]].

==Biography==
Góis (also Goes) was born in [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer, Portugal]], into a [[Nobility|noble]] family who served the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese kings]]. His father, Rui Dias de Gois was a valet to Duke of Aveiro, and his mother was Isabel Gomes de Limi, a descendant of Flemish merchants who established themselves in Portugal. Damiao's paternal grandfather, Gomes Dias de Góis, had been in the entourage of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]. &lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, E.F., ''Damião de Gois:  The Life and Thought of a Portuguese Humanist, 1502–1574,'' Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012, pp 1-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1518, Góis joined the court of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]]. Under Manuel I’s successor, King [[John III of Portugal]], in 1523, he was sent to [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]], as secretary and treasurer of the Portuguese ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'' (factory, trading post and commercial office). Henceforth, Góis travelled intensely ([[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[France]], [[England]], [[Italy]]), entering into contact with a number of important figures, like [[Sebastian Münster]], [[Erasmus]] (who hosted him in [[Freiburg]]), Ramusio, [[Philipp Melanchthon]], [[Thomas More]] and [[Martin Luther]]. Among the many Portuguese acquaintances, Góis was friend of the writers [[João de Barros]] and [[André de Resende]]. A humanist and an open mind, Góis followed courses at the [[University|Universities]] of [[University of Padua|Padua]] and [[Old University of Leuven|Leuven]], wrote on various topics, like the condition of the [[Sami people]] ("Lapps"), and translated some [[Classical antiquity|classic]] [[Literature|works]] – among them, [[Cicero]]’s [[On Old Age|Cato maior de senectute]] – into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. He was also a composer of some [[music]]al pieces and kept a private collection of [[painting]]s.

Góis translated into [[Latin]] a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] opuscle on the [[Ethiopia]]n [[Diplomatic mission|embassy]] of the [[Ethiopian Armenians|Armenian]] [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Mateus]] (the representative of the [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Negus]] [[Dawit II of Ethiopia|Dawit II]]) to Portugal (1532), which also included the famous "Letter of [[Prester John]]" written by the Ethiopian Queen [[Eleni of Ethiopia|Eleni]] (1509) and a "Confessio illorum fidei".

In 1538 he published a translation of the Biblical book [[Ecclesiastes]] in Portuguese, though it was not widely circulated.  In the same year, he took a Dutch wife, Joana van Hargen (known as Joana de Argem in Portugal), daughter of a Flemish councilman to the Court of Carlos V. In 1540, he published the famous ''Fides, religio, moresque Aethiopum'' ("Ethiopian faith, religion, and mores"). The book received a widespread diffusion in [[Europe]], in both [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] circles, and enjoyed of successive editions ([[Paris]] 1541, [[Leuven]] 1544, [[Leiden]] 1561, [[Cologne]] 1574). &lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Goes, Damião de |volume=12 |pages=180-181 |first=Edgar |last=Prestage |authorlink=Edgar Prestage  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It also earned the author, however, the criticisms of the powerful Portuguese [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Henry, King of Portugal|Henry of Portugal]], who, as [[Grand Inquisitor]] of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], banned its circulation in the kingdom. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit order]] proved equally critical, as he was accused by the [[Provincial superior]] Simão Rodrigues of [[Lutheranism]], and of being a disciple of Erasmus, before the [[Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;"Damião de Góis," ''Encyclopedia Britannica,'' Online: https://www.britannica.com/biography/Damiao-de-Gois&lt;/ref&gt;

He was settled at [[Louvain, Belgium|Louvain]], then the literary centre of the [[Low Countries]], when the French besieged the town in 1542. He was given the command of the defending forces, and saved Louvain, but was taken prisoner and confined for nine months in France, till he obtained his freedom by a heavy ransom. He was rewarded, however, by a grant of arms from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. He finally returned to Portugal in 1545, with a view of becoming tutor to the king's son, but he failed to obtain this post, owing to the accusations before the Inquisition.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Goes, Damião de |volume=12 |pages=180-181 |first=Edgar |last=Prestage |authorlink=Edgar Prestage  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1548, Góis was named ''Guarda Mor'' (High Guardian) of the [[Torre do Tombo]] ([[National Archives|Royal Archives]]) and ten years later was entrusted by the same Cardinal Henry to write the chronicle of Manuel I’s reign. The task has been previously confided to de Barros, but relinquished by him.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The work was completed in some seven years and became his major achievement; nonetheless it was widely attacked and parts of it were significantly censored.{{sfn|Prestage|1911}} He also published a description of the city of [[Lisbon]] – ''Urbis Olisiponis Descriptio'' (1554).

In 1570 the [[Inquisitorial system|inquisitorial process]] opened again, sending Góis to reclusion in the monastery of [[Batalha Monastery|Batalha]]. He died shortly after in Alenquer under mysterious circumstances (apparently, murder), free but sick, and was buried in the church of Nossa Senhora da Varzea.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Góis had several children: Manuel in 1540, Ambrosio in 1541, Rui Dias de Gois, Antonio de Gois, Catarina de Gois, and Maria de Gois.

'''David Macpherson''' (1746–1816) was a Scottish historian.

==Life==
The son of a tailor and clothier, Macpherson was born in Edinburgh, 26 October 1746. He was probably educated at [[Edinburgh High School]] and [[Edinburgh University]], and then trained as a land surveyor. Working in Great Britain and America, he was able to earn some money before 1790, about which time he settled with his wife and family in London making his living as a man of letters.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Macpherson, David|volume=35|first=Thomas Wilson|last=Bayne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Losing money through bad loans, Macpherson was occasionally in straitened circumstance from then on, but continued to write, encouraged by antiquarians such as [[Joseph Ritson]] and [[George Chalmers (antiquarian)|George Chalmers]]. He died in London, 1 August 1816.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
For some time Macpherson was a deputy-keeper of the public records, and assisted in preparing for publication the first and part of the second volume of the ''Rotuli Scotiæ''. He edited [[Andrew Wyntoun]]'s ''Orygynal Cronykil of Scotland'', 2 vols., 1795; it was re-edited, in an enlarged form, by [[David Laing (antiquary)|David Laing]], for the ''Historians of Scotland'' series, 1879. Macpherson's other works were:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

* ''Geographical Illustrations of Scottish History'', 1796. 
* ''Annals of Commerce, Fisheries, and Navigation ... from the earliest Accounts to the Meeting of the Union Parliament in 1801'' (with the essentials of [[Adam Anderson (economist)|Adam Anderson]]'s ''History of Commerce''), 4 vols. 1805.
* ''The History of European Commerce with India'', 1812.

'''Dido Elizabeth Belle''' (1761 – July 1804) was born into slavery as the [[Legitimacy (family law)#Nomenclature|natural daughter]] of Maria Belle, an enslaved African woman in the [[British West Indies]], and [[John Lindsay (Royal Navy officer)|Sir John Lindsay]], a British career naval officer who was stationed there. He was later knighted and promoted to admiral.&lt;ref name="heritage1"/&gt; Lindsay took Belle with him when he returned to England in 1765, entrusting her raising to his uncle [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield]], and his wife Elizabeth Murray, Countess of Mansfield. The Murrays educated Belle, bringing her up as a free [[landed gentry|gentlewoman]] at their [[Kenwood House]], together with another great-niece, [[Lady Elizabeth Murray]], whose mother had died. Lady Elizabeth and Belle were second cousins.  Belle lived there for 30 years. In his will of 1793, Lord Mansfield confirmed her freedom and provided an outright sum and an annuity to her, making her an heiress.

In these years, her great-uncle, in his capacity as [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], ruled in two significant slavery cases, finding in 1772 that slavery had no [[precedent]] in [[common law]] in England, and had never been authorised under [[positive law]]. This ruling was misinterpreted as presaging the formal end of slavery in Britain, but in fact slavery continued to be legal in the country until the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings'' (London: BBC Books, 2005), pp. 51-61.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Zong massacre]], a case related to the slave trade, he narrowly ruled that the owners of the ship were not due insurance payments for the loss of slaves they had thrown overboard during a voyage, as their killing appeared to be related to errors by the officers.

==Early life==

Dido Elizabeth Belle was born into slavery in 1761&lt;ref&gt;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57ee2b1bb3db2b9bde3a3aa0/t/58488458579fb3be2a5a62aa/1481147487349/Dido+Elizabeth+Belle+at+Kenwood+by+Gene+Adams.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[British West Indies]] to an enslaved African woman known as Maria Belle. (Her name was spelled as Maria Bell in her daughter's baptism record.)&lt;ref name=English-Heritage /&gt; Her father was 24-year-old [[John Lindsay (Royal Navy officer)|Sir John Lindsay]], a member of the [[Lindsay of Evelix|Lindsay family of Evelix]] branch of the [[Clan Lindsay]] and a descendant of the [[Clan Murray]], who was a career naval officer and then captain of the British warship [[HMS Trent (1757)|HMS ''Trent'']], based in the West Indies.&lt;ref name="heritage1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavery and Justice at Kenwood House, Part 1|url=https://content.historicengland.org.uk/content/docs/research/leafletslave1final.pdf|accessdate=12 June 2015|publisher=Historic England}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of [[Sir Alexander Lindsay, 3rd Baronet]] and his wife Amelia, daughter of [[David Murray, 5th Viscount Stormont]]. Lindsay is thought to have found Maria Belle held as a slave on a Spanish ship which his forces captured in the Caribbean; he appears to have taken her as his [[concubinage|concubine]] (see [[plaçage]]).&lt;ref name=adams-1984&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Gene|title=Dido Elizabeth Belle/ A Black Girl at Kenwood/ an account of a protegée of the 1st Lord Mansfield|journal=Camden History Review|year=1984|pages=10–14|url=http://sharonlathanauthor.com/wp-content/uploads/Dido-Elizabeth-Belle_-a-black-girl-at-Kenwood.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsay returned to London after the war in 1765 with his young daughter, Dido Belle. When they arrived in England he took her to Kenwood House just outside the city, the home of his uncle, [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield]], and his wife Elizabeth Murray, Countess of Mansfield. Belle was baptised as Dido Elizabeth Belle in 1766 at [[St. George's, Bloomsbury]]. The Murray family raised Belle as an educated woman along with their niece and Dido's cousin, Lady Elizabeth Murray, whose mother had died. However, Belle remained a slave until Mansfield finally granted her freedom from slavery in his will in 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Siva, ''Why did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783-1815?'' London: Open University, 2014), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary obituary of Sir John Lindsay, who had eventually been promoted to admiral, acknowledged that he was the father of Dido Belle, and described her: "[H]e has died, we believe, without any legitimate issue but has left one [[Legitimacy (family law)|natural daughter]], a [[Mulatta]] who has been brought up in Lord Mansfield's family almost from her infancy and whose amiable disposition and accomplishments have gained her the highest respect from all his Lordship's relations and visitants."&lt;ref name="heritage1"/&gt; At one time, historians thought her mother was an African slave on a ship captured by Lindsay's warship during the [[Battle of Havana (1762)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Urquhart|first=Frank|title=Portrait of woman who inspired "Belle" to be shown|url=http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/film/portrait-of-woman-who-inspired-belle-to-be-shown-1-3306617|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this specific date is unlikely, as Dido was born in 1761, the previous year.&lt;ref name=English-Heritage /&gt;

==At Kenwood House==
[[File:Dido Elizabeth Belle.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Painting of Dido Elizabeth Belle (l) and her cousin Elizabeth Murray (r).]]
The Earl and Countess of Mansfield lived at [[Kenwood House]] in [[Hampstead]], just outside the [[City of London]]. Childless, they were already raising their motherless great-niece, [[Lady Elizabeth Murray]], born in 1760. It is possible that the Mansfields took Belle in to be Lady Elizabeth's playmate and, later in life, her personal attendant.&lt;ref name="adams-1984"/&gt; Her role within the family suggests that she became more that of a [[lady's companion]] than a [[lady's maid]].

At Kenwood house, "Belle was treated like the rest of the family when she was in company with only the family," says Mansfield. Not only was Belle the black, illegitimate daughter of a nobleman, she was also a slave until Mansfield died.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Siva, ''Why did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783-1815?'' London: Open University, 2014), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Mansfield had a close relationship with Belle; he was fond of her and she often helped him, later working as his secretary.

Belle lived at Kenwood House for 31 years. Her position was unusual because she was born into slavery according to colonial law. Lord and Lady Mansfield to some extent treated her and brought her up as a member of the Murray family. As she grew older, she often assisted Mansfield by taking dictation of his letters, which showed she had been educated.&lt;ref name = "tel"/&gt;

One of Mansfield's friends, American [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], a former governor of Massachusetts who as a [[Loyalism|Loyalist]] had moved to London, recalled in his personal diary that Belle "was called upon by my Lord every minute for this thing and that, and shewed the greatest attention to everything he said". He described her as "neither handsome nor genteel – pert enough".&lt;ref name="tel" /&gt; He also talks about his first impressions of her at Lord Mansfield's house, saying "A Black came in after dinner and sat with the ladies, and after coffee, walked with the company in the gardens, one of the young ladies having her arm within the other. She had a very high cap, and her wool was much frizzled in her neck, but not enough to answer the large curls now in fashion. I knew her history before, but my Lord mentioned it again. Sir Lindsay, having taken her mother prisoner in a Spanish vessel, brought her to England, where she delivered of this girl, of which she was then with child, and which was taken care of by Lord M., and has been educated by his family. He calls her Dido, which I suppose is all the name she has. He knows he has been reproached for shewing a fondness for her – I dare say not criminal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924080796950|title=The diary and letters of His Excellency Thomas Hutchinson : Captain-general and Governor-in-chief of His late Majesty's province of Massachusetts Bay in North America ... compiled from the original documents still remaining in the possession of his descendants|last=Hutchinson|first=Thomas|last2=Hutchinson|first2=Peter Orlando|date=1884|publisher=Boston : Houghton, Mifflin|others=Cornell University Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reference to Belle also appears briefly in volume II of [[James Beattie (poet)|James Beattie]]'s Elements of Moral Science.&lt;ref name="Beattie 1807"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/elementsofmorals02beatiala|title=Elements of moral science|last=Beattie|first=James|date=1807|publisher=Edinburgh : Printed [by Mundell, Doig, and Stevenson] for W. Creech and T. Cadell and W. Davies, London|others=University of California Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beattie refers to her intelligence, saying "But I happened, a few days after, to see his theory overturned, and my conjecture established by a negro girl about ten years old, who had been six years in England, and not only spoke with the articulation and accent of a native, but repeated some pieces of poetry, with a degree of elegance, which would have been admired in any English child of her years."&lt;ref name="Beattie 1807"/&gt; Following this is a footnote which states, "She was in Lord Mansfield's family ; and at his desire, and in his presence, repeated those pieces of poetry to me. She was called Dido, and I believe is still alive."&lt;ref name="Beattie 1807"/&gt; This and the quotations from Thomas Hutchinson are some of the few direct references to Dido found in primary source material.

Lord Mansfield ruled on a related matter of the status of slaves in England in his capacity as [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]]. When called on in 1772 to judge [[Somerset v Stewart]], the case of an escaped slave whose owner wanted to send him back to the West Indies for sale, he decreed: 
{{quote|The state of slavery is of such a nature, that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political; but only [[positive law]], which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory: it's so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England.}}
Mansfield's ruling that slavery did not exist in common law and had never been introduced by positive law was taken by [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]] to mean that slavery was abolished in England. His ruling was narrow and reserved judgment on this point, saying only that the slave's owner had no right to remove Somerset from England against his will. Mansfield later said his decision was intended only to apply to the slave at issue in the case. At the time, it was suggested that Mansfield's personal experience with raising Dido Belle influenced his decision. Thomas Hutchinson later recalled a comment by a slave-owner:  "A few years ago there was a cause before his Lordship brought by a Black for recovery of his liberty. A Jamaica planter, being asked what judgment his Lordship would give [answered] 'No doubt... he will be set free, for Lord Mansfield keeps a Black in his house which governs him and the whole family.'"&lt;ref name = "tel"&gt;Nisha Lilia Diu, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10863078/Dido-Belle-Britains-first-black-aristocrat.html "Dido Belle: Britain’s first black aristocrat"], ''The Telegraph'', 6 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social position===
The social conventions of Mansfield's household are somewhat unclear. When the Mansfields were entertaining, Belle didn't eat with the guests. A 2007 exhibit at Kenwood suggests that she was treated as "a loved but poor relation", and therefore did not always dine with guests, as was reported by Thomas Hutchinson.&lt;ref name="heritage1"/&gt; He said Belle joined the ladies afterwards for coffee in the [[drawing-room]].&lt;ref name="heritage1"/&gt; In 2014, author [[Paula Byrne]] wrote that Belle's exclusion from this particular dinner was pragmatic rather than the custom. She notes that other aspects of Belle's life, such as being given expensive medical treatments and luxurious bedroom furnishings, were evidence of her position as Lady Elizabeth's equal at Kenwood.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Start the Week]]'', [[BBC Radio 4]], 14 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Belle grew older, she took on the responsibility of managing the dairy and poultry yards at Kenwood. This was a typical occupation for ladies of the [[gentry]], but helping her uncle with his correspondence was less usual. This was normally done by a male secretary or a clerk. Belle was given an annual allowance of £30 10s, several times the wages of a [[domestic worker]]. By contrast, Lady Elizabeth received around £100, but she was a [[beneficiary]] in her own right through her mother's family. Belle, quite apart from her race, was illegitimate, in a time and place when great social stigma usually accompanied such status.

==Later life==
Belle's father died in 1788 without legitimate heirs, bequeathing £1000 to be shared by his "reputed children", John and Elizabeth Lindsay (as noted in his will).&lt;ref name="heritage1"/&gt; Historian Gene Adams believed this suggested that Lindsay referred to his daughter as Elizabeth, and she may have been named Dido by his uncle and aunt after they took charge of the girl.&lt;ref name=adams-1984/&gt; Another source says that there was another natural daughter, known as Elizabeth Palmer (born c. 1765), who lived in Scotland.&lt;ref name="heritage1"/&gt;

In his will written in 1783, Lord Mansfield officially [[manumission| granted Belle her freedom]] from slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Siva, ''Why did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783-1815?'' (London: Open University, 2014), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Mansfield granted Belle her freedom in his will indicated that he also believed that his ruling did not abolish slavery in England. To secure her future, he also bequeathed her with £500 as an outright sum and a £100 [[Life annuity|annuity]], which she received after his death in 1793.&lt;ref&gt;[https://historicengland.org.uk/research/inclusive-heritage/the-slave-trade-and-abolition/slavery-and-justice-exhibition-at-kenwood-house/ "Dido Elizabeth Belle and The First Earl of Mansfield"], Slavery and Justice Exhibition at Kenwood House, Historic England.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1799 Belle also inherited £100 from Lady Margery Murray, one of two female relatives who had come to live with and help care for the Murrays in their later years.&lt;ref name=adams-1984/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Public Record Office, Catalogue reference: PROB 11/1324/97: 'Will of The Right Honorable, Lady Margery Murray, Spinster of Twickenham , Middlesex':"...one hundred pounds to Dido Elizabeth Belle, as a token of my regard..." The will was first drafted in 1793 but in a codicil dated 1796 Lady Margery specified that the bequest of £100 to Dido "she being now married to Mr. Davinier" was to be "for her separate use and at her disposal".&lt;/ref&gt;

William Murray left his niece Elizabeth Murray £10,000. Her father was in line to inherit his father's title and more money.&lt;ref name="heritage1"/&gt;

After her great-uncle's death in March 1793, which resulted in her being granted freedom from slavery, Belle married John Davinier, a Frenchman who worked as a gentleman's steward, on 5 December 1793 at [[St George's, Hanover Square]]. They were both then residents of the parish.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;Reyahn King, "Belle, Dido Elizabeth (1761?–1804)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Daviniers had at least three sons: twins Charles and John, both baptised at St George's on 8 May 1795; and William Thomas, baptised there on 26 January 1802.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Minney, "The Search for Dido", ''[[History Today]]'' 55, October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Belle died in 1805 at the age of 43, and was interred in July of that year at [[St George's Fields, Westminster]], a burial-ground close to what is now [[Bayswater Road]]. In the 1970s, the site was redeveloped and her grave was moved.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; Her husband later remarried and had two more children with his second wife.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Descendants==
Two of Belle's sons, William Thomas and Charles, were employed by the [[East India Company]]; William in England and Charles in India.  

Charles Davinier(e) served with the [[Madras Army]] (one of the territorial armies of the [[East India Company]] (HEIC), preceding the [[British Indian Army]]). In 1810, he was listed as a lieutenant in the 15th Native Infantry (but was surely an ensign before, because in the HEIC, [[Purchase of commissions in the British army|purchasing of commissions]] was not practised).
&lt;ref name="List"&gt;Officers-List, {{cite book|title=A list of the officers of the army, ordnance and medical departments, serving under the presidency of Fort St. George|date=1822|pages= 75, 114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEMIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA144 |accessdate=11 September 2014|publisher=Presidency of Madras Army}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1836, he married Hannah Nash, youngest daughter of J. Nash, Esquire, of Kensington, at Kensington Church. At this time, he held the rank of captain in the 30th Native Infantry (that was formed from the 2nd Battalion, 15th Native Infantry in 1824).&lt;ref name="Asiatic"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register for British India and Its Dependencies|location= London|date= 1820|page= 52 (Marriages)|url=https://archive.org/details/asiaticjournala34unkngoog|accessdate=10 September 2014|publisher=archive org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1837, Captain Charles Davinier was relieved of his former duty and was "to have charge of Infantry recruits" in the headquarters at [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]].&lt;ref name="Oriental"&gt;{{cite book|title=Parbury's Oriental Herald and Colonial Intelligencer|location= London| date= 1837|pages= 59 &amp; 117 (Appointments...Changes etc.: Military)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SkMFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA57 |accessdate=11 September 2014|publisher=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from service in 1847, still being with the 30th Native Infantry.&lt;ref name="Service"&gt;{{cite web|title=Madras Service Army List, 1847 – 1859, Sig.

The probate record index describes him as "Charles Davinière...Lieutenant Colonel in Her Majesty's Army" and names his widow Hannah as his executrix.&lt;/ref&gt;

William Thomas Davinier married a widow, Fanny Graham, and had a daughter, Emily.  Emily died unmarried in 1870, several years after the death of her parents.

Belle's last known descendant, her great-great-grandson Harold Davinier, died childless in South Africa in 1975.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

They are standing together on the grounds of Kenwood and her cousin's hand lies gently upon Dido's arm, suggesting affection and the possibility that they are walking the grounds together. Their positioning in the painting may hint to differences in their race: Elizabeth stands holding a book while Dido holds a plate of fruit, as if on her way to serve others. However, Dido's gown and accessories demonstrate an expensive, fashion-forward style contrasting with Elizabeth's more traditional dress.

The painting is owned by the present Earl of Mansfield and housed at [[Scone Palace]] in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland.

'''Dominique Venner''' ({{IPA-fr|vɛnɛʁ|lang}}; 16 April 1935&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 21 May 2013) was a [[French people|French]] [[historian]], [[journalist]] and [[essayist]].  Venner was a member of the [[Organisation armée secrète]]&lt;ref name=Lichfield&gt;{{cite news|author=John Lichfield|title=Far-right French historian, 78-year-old Dominique Venner, commits suicide in Notre Dame in protest against gay marriage|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/farright-french-historian-78yearold-dominique-venner-commits-suicide-in-notre-dame-in-protest-against-gay-marriage-8625877.html|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=Independent|date=21 May 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later became a European nationalist before withdrawing from politics to focus on a career as a historian. He specialized in military and political history. At the time of his death, he was the editor of the ''[[La Nouvelle Revue d'Histoire]]'', a bimonthly history magazine. On 21 May 2013, Venner committed suicide inside the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vagazette.com/news/sns-rt-us-france-suicidebre94k0qz-20130521,0,7348088.story|title=Far-right activist commits suicide in Paris Notre Dame cathedral|date=21 May 2013|work=Virginia Gazette|accessdate=21 May 2013|agency=Reuters}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth==
The son of an [[architect]] who had been a member of Doriot's [[Parti populaire français]]&lt;ref&gt;Notice biographique dans le Tome 1 du Dictionnaire de la politique française d'Henry Coston (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; (the PPF), Venner volunteered to fight in the [[Algerian War]], and served until October 1956. Upon his return to France he joined the ''[[Jeune Nation]]'' (Young Nation) movement. Following the violent suppression of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution he participated in the ransacking of the office of the French Communist Party on 7 November 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Les Actualités françaises [archive], 14 November 1956; ''La Nouvelle Revue d'Histoire'' n°27, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Pierre Sidos]], he helped found the short-lived ''Parti Nationaliste'' (Nationalist Party) and was involved with the ''Mouvement populaire du 13-mai'' (Popular Movement of May 13) led by General Chassin. As a member of the [[Organisation armée secrète]], he was jailed for 18 months in [[La Santé Prison]] as a political undesirable.  He was freed in 1962.

==Political writing and activism==
Upon his release from prison in the autumn of 1962, Venner wrote a manifesto entitled ''Pour une critique positive'' (Towards a positive critique), which has been compared by some to [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s ''[[What is to be done?]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Milza, Fascismes français, passé et présent, Flammarion, 1988, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; as it became a "foundational text of a whole segment of the ultra-right".&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Milza, L'Europe en chemise noire. Les extrêmes droites en Europe de 1945 à aujourd'hui, Flammarion, collection "Champs", 2002, p. 193. In footnote 1 on p. 443 Milza notes, inter alia: "In December 1982, during the Congress of the Party of New Forces, Roland Hélie, of the Party's political executive, suggested members reread Venner's text", "En décembre 1982, lors du congrès du Parti des forces nouvelles, Roland Hélie, membre du bureau politique, conviait les militants à une relecture du texte de Venner". Cf. Pierre-André Taguieff, "La stratégie culturelle de la "Nouvelle Droite" en France (1968-1983)", in Vous avez dit fascismes ?, ed. Robert Badinter, Paris, Arthaud/Montalba, 1984, pp. 13-52.&lt;/ref&gt; In the manifesto, Venner explored the reasons for the failure of the [[Algiers putsch of 1961|April 1961 coup]] and the divide that existed between "nationals" ("nationaux") and "nationalists" ("nationalistes") and called for the creation of a single revolutionary and nationalist organisation, which would be "monolithic and hierarchical" and composed of young, "disciplined and devoted" nationalist militants who would be ready for combat.

In January 1963, he created (with [[Alain de Benoist]]) a movement and magazine called "Europe-Action", which he later led. He went on to found the ''Éditions Saint-Just'', which operated in tandem with ''Europe-Action'', and which was composed of nationalists, [[Europeanist]]s, members of the ''Fédération des étudiants nationalistes'' (Federation of Nationalist Students), former OAS members, young militants and former collaborators like [[Lucien Rebatet]].
He was a member of ''[[Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne]]'' (GRECE) (Research and Study Group for European Civilization) from its beginning until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Nouvelle École, août-septembre 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; He also created, with [[Thierry Maulnier]], the ''Institut d'études occidentales (IEO)'' (Institute of Western Studies), and its revue, ''Cité-Liberté'' (City-Liberty), founded in 1970. The IEO was an enterprise that worked in parallel and in tandem with GRECE,&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Pierre-André Taguieff]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the organisation attracted numerous intellectuals, including [[Robert Aron]], [[Pierre Debray-Ritzen]], [[Thomas Molnar]], Jules Monnerot, [[Jules Romains]], [[Louis Rougier]], [[Raymond Ruyer]] and [[Paul Sérant]]. The IEO was anti-communist, pitted itself against what it saw as "mental subversion" and supported Western values.&lt;ref&gt;see Pierre-André Taguieff, Sur la Nouvelle Droite. Jalons d'une analyse critique, "Descartes et cie", 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The IEO dissolved in 1971, the same year Venner ceased all political activities in order to focus on his career as an historian.

== Career as historian ==
Venner was a specialist regarding weaponry and hunting and wrote several books on these subjects. His principal historical works were: ''Baltikum'' (1974), ''Le Blanc Soleil des vaincus'' (The White Sun of the Vanquished) (1975), ''Le Cœur rebelle'' (The Rebel Heart) (1994), ''Gettysburg'' (1995), ''Les Blancs et les Rouges'' (The Whites and the Reds) (1997), ''Histoire de la Collaboration'' (History of the Collaboration) (2000) and ''Histoire du terrorisme'' (History of Terrorism) (2002). His ''Histoire de l'Armée rouge'' (History of the Red Army) won the [[Prix Broquette-Gonin]] of history awarded by the [[Académie française]] in 1981.

In 1995, and with the advice of his friend François de Grossouvre, Venner published ''Histoire critique de la Résistance'' (Critical History of the Resistance), which highlighted the strong influence and presence of French nationalists in the Resistance (often called "vichysto-résistants"). The work was criticised by some for failing to probe Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]]'s attitude towards the Resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Bénédicte Vergez-Chaignon, Les Vichysto-résistants: de 1940 à nos jours, Perrin, 2008, p. 721.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Venner wrote ''Histoire et tradition des Européens'' (History and Tradition of the Europeans), in which he set out what he believed to be the common cultural bases of European civilisation, and outlined his theory of "traditionalism" (a concept that, inter alia, assesses the specificities of each society and civilisation).

Venner served as editor in chief of the revue ''Enquête sur l'histoire'' (Study of History, or Historical Inquest) until its dissolution in the late 1990s. In 2002, he created ''[[La Nouvelle Revue d'Histoire]]'' (''The New Historical Revue'', temporarily renamed the NRH in 2006), a bimonthly magazine devoted to historical topics. The Revue has featured [[Bernard Lugan]], [[Jean Tulard]], [[Aymeric Chauprade]], [[Jean Mabire]], [[François-Georges Dreyfus]], [[Jacqueline de Romilly]] and former ministers [[Max Gallo]] and [[Alain Decaux]]. He was a co-host of a radio program on [[Radio Courtoisie]].

Some of his books have been translated into English, German, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian.

==Critical reception==
As noted above, Venner has been awarded a prestigious prize by ''l'Académie française'' for one of his historical works.

When it appeared that the ''NRH'' might be dissolved, journalist Christian Brosio (among others) sprang to its defence, claiming the revue was unique in its aesthetic presentation, in its originality in the treatment of subjects covered, the depth of its analysis and the quality of its contributors.&lt;ref&gt;"Une revue d'histoire menacée", Valeurs actuelles, 28 juillet 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist Gwendal Châton&lt;ref&gt;Gwendal Châton, "L'histoire au prisme d'une mémoire des droites extrêmes: Enquête sur l'Histoire et La Nouvelle Revue d'Histoire, deux revues de Dominique Venner", dans Michel J. (dir.), Mémoires et Histoires. Des identités personnelles aux politiques de reconnaissance, Rennes, Presses universitaires de Rennes, coll. "Essais", 2005, pp. 213-243.&lt;/ref&gt; has claimed that Venner has "integrated himself in the strategy of seeking out a newfound respectability: that of an intellectual", which he has used to "instrumentalise history to put history at the service of cultural struggle"&lt;ref&gt;Gwendal Châton, "L'histoire au prisme d'une mémoire des droites extrêmes: Enquête sur l'Histoire et La Nouvelle Revue d'Histoire, deux revues de Dominique Venner", dans Michel J. (dir.), Mémoires et Histoires. Des identités personnelles aux politiques de reconnaissance, Rennes, Presses universitaires de Rennes, coll. "Essais", 2005, pp. 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Venner's "traditionalism" and adherence to "European history and tradition" are a mere "rhetorical screen" designed to "mask" an "ideological continuity" from his earlier political activism.&lt;ref&gt;Gwendal Châton, "L'histoire au prisme d'une mémoire des droites extrêmes: Enquête sur l'Histoire et La Nouvelle Revue d'Histoire, deux revues de Dominique Venner", dans Michel J. (dir.), Mémoires et Histoires. Des identités personnelles aux politiques de reconnaissance, Rennes, Presses universitaires de Rennes, coll. "Essais", 2005, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Châton also alleges that Venner uses his historical revues to "manipulate history" in the guise of various rhetorical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Gwendal Châton, "L'histoire au prisme d'une mémoire des droites extrêmes: Enquête sur l'Histoire et La Nouvelle Revue d'Histoire, deux revues de Dominique Venner", dans Michel J. (dir.), Mémoires et Histoires. Des identités personnelles aux politiques de reconnaissance, Rennes, Presses universitaires de Rennes, coll. "Essais", 2005, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

University Professor Christopher Flood has noted that the revue generally adheres to a right-wing outlook, commenting: "[...] the overall flavour has been persistently, if subtly, revisionist".&lt;ref&gt;Journal of European Studies, 35(2), pp. 221-236.&lt;/ref&gt; While adhering to Chauprade's views on the conflict of civilisations, the ''NRH'' does not contain explicitly racist themes. In an editorial Venner commented that "The Japanese, the Jews, the Hindus and other peoples possess that treasure that has permitted them to confront the perils of history without disappearing. It is their misfortune that the majority of Europeans, and especially the French, are so impregnated with universalism that this treasure is lacking"&lt;ref&gt;("Les Japonais, les Juifs, les Hindous et d'autres peuples possèdent ce trésor qui leur a permis d'affronter les périls de l'histoire sans disparaître. Pour leur malheur, la plupart des Européens, particulièrement les Français, imprégnés qu'ils sont d'universalisme, en sont dépourvus").  Venner, La NRH, n°8 (éditorial)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suicide==
On 21 May 2013, about 4 p.m., Venner committed suicide by firearm in the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europe1.fr/Faits-divers/Paris-suicide-a-Notre-Dame-d-un-ex-OAS-1524647/ Suicide à Notre-Dame d'un ex-OAS]&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the evacuation of approximately 1,500 people from the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Angelique Chrisafis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/21/french-historian-kills-himself-notre-dame-gay-marriage |title=French historian kills himself at Notre Dame Cathedral after gay marriage rant|work=Guardian|date=21 November 2009|accessdate=22 May 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been an opponent of Muslim immigration to France and Europe, as well as what he believed to be the Americanization of European values and — most recently — the legalization of [[same-sex marriage in France]]. Despite the choice of Notre Dame as the place of his suicide, Venner was not a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22628159|work=BBC News|title=France reacts to Dominique Venner's shock 'gesture'| date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a practicing [[pagan]] but also an admirer of Christian civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nouvelobs.com/rue89/rue89-noel-toute-lannee/20130527.RUE7854/dominique-venner-martyr-d-un-contre-mai-68.html Dominique Venner, « martyr » d’un contre-mai 68]&lt;/ref&gt;

Only hours earlier, he had left a post on his blog, on the subject of forthcoming protests against the legalization of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="FranceInfo"&gt;[http://www.franceinfo.fr/faits-divers/un-homme-se-suicide-avec-une-arme-a-feu-dans-la-cathedrale-notre-dame-de-paris-995933-2013-05-21 Un homme se suicide dans la cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris] ''France Info''. 21 May 2013. Retrieved 29 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In the post, Venner approves of the demonstrators' outrage at an "infamous law", but expresses doubt as to the efficacy of street protests to affect social change. He rebukes the protesters for ignoring the threat of "Afro-Maghreb immigration", which he predicts will lead to a "total replacement of the population of France, and of Europe."&lt;ref name="manif26mai"&gt;[http://www.dominiquevenner.fr/2013/05/la-manif-du-26-mai-et-heidegger/ La manif du 26 mai et Heidegger]&lt;/ref&gt; He warns, "Peaceful street protests will not be enough to prevent it. [...] It will require new, spectacular, and symbolic actions to rouse people from their complacency [...] We enter into a time when words must be backed up by actions."&lt;ref name="manif26mai" /&gt;

In a letter sent to his colleagues at [[Radio Courtoisie]], he characterizes his suicide as a rebellion "against pervasive individual desires that destroy the anchors of our identity, particularly the family, the intimate base of our multi-millennial society."&lt;ref name="FranceInfo"/&gt; He explains his decision to commit suicide inside the cathedral: "I chose a highly symbolic place that I respect and admire."&lt;ref name="mestre"&gt;http://droites-extremes.blog.lemonde.fr/2013/05/21/dominique-venner-le-pere-de-lextreme-droite-moderne-sest-suicide&lt;/ref&gt; According to the rector of Notre Dame de Paris, Venner left behind a letter for investigators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2013/05/21/suicide-cathedrale-notre-dame-dominique-venner_n_3313084.html|title=Qui est Dominique Venner, le suicidé de la cathédrale Notre-Dame|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=22 May 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently reported that Venner was suffering from a serious illness at the time of his suicide.&lt;ref name="FranceInfo"/&gt;

Shortly after his death was reported, a number of far-right personalities paid tribute to Venner and commended his public suicide. [[Marine Le Pen]] issued a [[Twitter|tweet]]: "All our respect to Dominique Venner, whose final gesture, eminently political, was to try to awaken the people of France."&lt;ref name="afp_210513"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2013/05/21/un-homme-se-suicide-dans-la-cathedrale-notre-dame-evacuee_904512|title=Le FN "respecte" le suicidé d'extrême droite de Notre-Dame|work=Libération|date=21 May 2013|accessdate=22 May 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruno Gollnisch]] described him as an "extremely brilliant intellectual" whose death was "a protest against the decadence of our society."&lt;ref name="afp_210513"/&gt;

Others sought to distance themselves from Venner. [[Frigide Barjot]], spokesperson for the anti-gay marriage movement "Manif pour tous", told reporters that Venner had never been a member of her movement:&lt;ref name="FranceInfo2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Clémence Olivier |url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/faits-divers/suicide-de-notre-dame-frigide-barjot-prend-ses-distances-avec-dominique-venner-996917-2013-05-22|title=Suicide de Notre-Dame: Frigide Barjot prend ses distances avec Dominique Venner|work=France Info|date=22 May 2013|accessdate=22 May 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This gentleman belonged to a movement known as the French Spring, which has nothing to do with us, and which we condemned long ago." She described his suicide as "an isolated personal act, very violent, ostentatious, and desperate."&lt;ref name="FranceInfo2"/&gt;

'''Ecological modernization''' is a school of thought in the social sciences that argues that the [[economy]] benefits from moves towards [[environmentalism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} It has gained increasing attention among scholars and policymakers in the last several decades internationally. It is an analytical approach as well as a policy strategy and [[environmentalism|environmental]] [[discourse]] (Hajer, 1995).

==Origins and key elements==
Ecological modernization emerged in the early 1980s within a group of scholars at Free University and the Social Science Research Centre in Berlin, among them [[Joseph Huber (economist)|Joseph Huber]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Martin Jänicke|de}} and {{ill|Udo E. Simonis|de}}. Various authors pursued similar ideas at the time, e.g. [[Arthur H. Rosenfeld]], [[Amory Lovins]], Donald Huisingh, René Kemp, or [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker]]. Further substantial contributions were made by [[Arthur P.J. Mol]], [[Gert Spaargaren]] and [[David A Sonnenfeld]] (Mol and Sonnenfeld, 2000; Mol, 2001).

One basic assumption of ecological modernization relates to environmental readaptation of economic growth and industrial development. On the basis of [[enlightened self-interest]], economy and ecology can be favourably combined: Environmental [[productivity]], i.e. productive use of natural resources and environmental media (air, water, soil, ecosystems), can be a source of future growth and development in the same way as [[labour productivity]] and capital productivity. This includes increases in energy and resource efficiency as well as product and process innovations such as environmental management and sustainable [[supply chain management]], [[clean technology|clean technologies]], benign substitution of hazardous substances, and product design for environment. Radical innovations in these fields can not only reduce quantities of resource turnover and emissions, but also change the quality or structure of the [[industrial metabolism]]. In the co-evolution of humans and nature, and in order to upgrade the environment’s [[carrying capacity]], ecological modernization gives humans an active role to play, which may entail conflicts with nature conservation.

There are different understandings of the scope of ecological modernization - whether it is just about techno-industrial progress and related aspects of policy and economy, and to what extent it also includes cultural aspects (ecological modernization of mind, value orientiations, attitudes, behaviour and lifestyles). Similarly, there is some pluralism as to whether ecological modernization would need to rely mainly on government, or markets and entrepreneurship, or civil society, or some sort of [[multi-level governance]] combining the three. Some scholars explicitly refer to general [[modernization theory]] as well as non-Marxist [[world-systems approach|world-system theory]], others don’t.

Ultimately, however, there is a common understanding that ecological modernization will have to result in innovative structural change. So research is now still more focused on environmental innovations, or eco-innovations, and the interplay of various societal factors (scientific, economic, institutional, legal, political, cultural) which foster or hamper such innovations (Klemmer et al., 1999; Huber, 2004; Weber and Hemmelskamp, 2005; Olsthoorn and Wieczorek, 2006).

Ecological modernization shares a number of features with neighbouring, overlapping approaches. Among the most important are
*the concept of [[sustainable development]]
*the approach of [[industrial metabolism]] ([[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Ayres]] and [[Udo Simonis|Simonis]], 1994)
*the concept of [[industrial ecology]] ([[Robert H. Socolow|Socolow]], 1994)

==Additional elements==
A special topic of ecological modernization research during recent years was ''sustainable household'', i.e. environment-oriented reshaping of lifestyles, consumption patterns, and demand-pull control of supply chains (Vergragt, 2000; OECD 2002). 
Some scholars of ecological modernization share an interest in [[industrial symbiosis]], i.e. inter-site recycling that helps to reduce the consumption of resources via increasing efficiency (i.e. pollution prevention, waste reduction), typically by taking externalities from one economic production process and using them as raw material inputs for another (Christoff, 1996). 
Ecological modernization also relies on product life-cycle assessment and the analysis of materials and energy flows. In this context, ecological modernization promotes 'cradle to cradle' manufacturing ([[Michael Braungart|Braungart]] and [[William McDonough|McDonough]], 2002), contrasted against the usual 'cradle to grave' forms of manufacturing - where waste is not re-integrated back into the production process. 
Another special interest in the ecological modernization literature has been the role of [[social movement]]s and the emergence of civil society as a key agent of change ([[Dana R. Fisher|Fisher]] and Freudenburg, 2001).

As a [[strategy]] of change, some forms of ecological modernization may be favored by [[business]] interests because they seemingly meet the triple bottom line of economics, society, and environment, which, it is held, underpin sustainability, yet do not challenge [[free market]] principles. This contrasts with many [[environmental movement]] perspectives, which regard [[free trade]] and its notion of business self-regulation as part of the problem, or even an origin of [[environmental degradation]]. Under ecological modernization, the [[State (polity)|state]] is seen in a variety of roles and capacities: as the enabler for [[Market (economics)|market]]s that help produce the technological advances via competition; as the regulatory (see [[regulation]]) medium through which [[corporation]]s are forced to 'take back' their various wastes and re-integrate them in some manner into the production of new goods and services (e.g. the way that [[Automobile|car]] corporations in Germany are required to accept back cars they manufactured once those vehicles have reached the end of their product lifespan); and in some cases as an institution that is incapable of addressing critical local, national, and global environmental problems. In the latter case, ecological modernization shares with [[Ulrich Beck]] (1999, 37-40) and others notions of the necessity of emergence of new forms of [[environmental governance]], sometimes referred to as subpolitics or political modernization, where the [[environmental movement]], community groups, businesses, and other stakeholders increasingly take on direct and leadership roles in stimulating environmental transformation. Political modernization of this sort requires certain supporting norms and institutions such as a free, independent, or at least critical press, basic [[human rights]] of expression, organization, and assembly, etc.  [[New media]] such as the [[Internet]] greatly facilitate this.

==Criticisms==
Critics argue that ecological modernization will fail to protect [[environment (biophysical)|the environment]] and does nothing to alter the  impulses within the capitalist economic mode of production (see [[capitalism]]) that inevitably lead to environmental degradation (Foster, 2002). As such, it is just a form of '[[green-washing]]'. Critics question whether [[technology|technological]] advances alone can achieve resource conservation and better [[environmental protection]], particularly if left to business [[self-regulatory organization|self-regulation]] practices (York and Rosa, 2003). For instance, many technological improvements are currently feasible but not widely utilized. The most [[environmentally friendly]] product or manufacturing process (which is often also the most economically efficient) is not always the one automatically chosen by self-regulating corporations (e.g. [[hydrogen]] or [[biofuel]] vs. [[peak oil]]). In addition, some critics have argued that ecological modernization does not redress gross [[injustices]] that are produced within the capitalist system, such as [[environmental racism]] - where [[people of color]] and low income earners bear a disproportionate burden of environmental harm such as pollution, and lack access to environmental benefits such as [[parks]], and [[social justice]] issues such as eliminating [[unemployment]] (Bullard, 1993; Gleeson and Low, 1999; Harvey, 1996) - [[environmental racism]] is also referred to as issues of the asymmetric distribution of environmental resources and services (Everett &amp; Neu, 2000). Moreover, the theory seems to have limited global efficacy, applying primarily to its countries of origin - [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]], and having little to say about the [[developing world]] (Fisher and Freudenburg, 2001). Perhaps the harshest criticism though, is that ecological modernization is predicated upon the notion of 'sustainable growth', and in reality this is not possible because growth entails the consumption of natural and human capital at great costs to [[ecosystem]]s and societies.

Ecological modernization, its effectiveness and applicability, strengths and limitations, remains a dynamic and contentious area of environmental social science research and policy discourse in the early 21st century.

[[File:El_abrazo_(Jorge_González_Camarena).jpg|thumb|''El abrazo'']]
'''''El abrazo''''' (in English ''The Embrace'') is a work by Mexican artist [[Jorge González Camarena]], painted in 1980.  The author gave the painting to his son Jorge González Camarena Barre de Saint-Leu. In October 2013 the work was sold to [[Carlos Slim Foundation]]. It is part of the permanent collection of  [[Museo Soumaya]] in [[Mexico City]].

== ''La fusión de dos culturas''  ==
The painting is an easel version of the mural  ''[[La fusión de dos culturas]]'' (In English, ''The Fusion of Two Cultures''), previously entitled by the author:  ''La Conquista'' (''The Conquest'').  The mural is preserved in the collection of the [[Museo Nacional de Historia]], in México City.

== Background ==
The painting was made in 1980,  twenty years after the mural work. It is 2 m wide and 1.4 m tall. Although it was previously thought that it was an [[oil painting]] on [[canvas]], tests revealed that the artist used [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miranda Márquez|first=Alfonso|title=El abrazo: Jorge González Camarena|journal=Revista Mensual de Museo Soumaya|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In comparison with the mural, on this version the artist suppressed the horse, leaving both the [[Guerrero Águila|guerrero águila]] (Eagle Warrior) and the [[Spanish conquistador]] kneeling face to face, embracing and killing each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Museo Soumaya Catálogo|last=Miranda Márquez|first=Alfonso|publisher=Fundación Carlos Slim|year=2015|isbn=9786077805137|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
The title is a [[metaphor]] for how the conquest was perceived: the artist shows two cultures embracing and merging, while the two traditions collide and destroy each other.

'''Fearfeasa Ó Maol Chonaire''', co-compiler and [[scribe]] of the [[Annals of the Four Masters]], fl. 1620s-1640s.

==Family background==
Ó Maol Chonaire was a member of the [[Ó Maolconaire]] [[brehon]] family of north [[County Roscommon]]. A member of the Sliocht Pháidín, his genealogy was ''Fearfeasa mac Lochlainn mac Séan Ruadh (died 1589) mac Lochlainn mac Paidín Ó Maolconaire (died 1506).'' He was thus closely related to [[Muirgheas mac Pháidín Ó Maolconaire]] (died 1543) and his descendants, [[Fláithrí Ó Maol Chonaire]] (died 1629)
and [[Muiris mac Torna Ó Maolconaire]] (died 1645).

It has been suggested by Eoin Mac Cárthaigh that Fearfeasa's lands were in the townland of Creta, parish of Kiltrustan, beside that of his father, Lochlainn, who lived in Lisheen townland. Páidín Ruadh Ó Maol Chonaire, who retained two-thirds of his lands in Ballymulconry in the 1650s, may have been Fearfeasa's brother.

==The Four Masters==
As a young man, he participated in the compilation of the [[Annals of the Four Masters]], working with [[Mícheál Ó Cléirigh]], [[Cú Choigcríche Ó Cléirigh]], [[Peregrine Ó Duibhgeannain]] and other assistants.  He is identified by Bernadette Cunningham as the [[scribe]] of hand E in the [[autograph]] of the [[Annals of the Four Masters]]. He participated in the compilation of the years up to 1333 with [[Ó Duibhgeannáin]], the [[Ó Cléirigh]]'s writing the rest of the book to 1616.

==Opposition to Tuileagna Ó Maol Chonaire==
Fearfeasa strenuously opposed [[Tuileagna Ó Maol Chonaire]], whose criticisms of the work of the Four Masters prevented its publication in the 1640s.

==Poet==
Fearfeasa was the author of many poems, one of which was ''Mochean do[d] chuairt a Chalbhaigh'', addressed to An Calbhah Ruadh 
Ó Domhnaill.

'''Frederic William Maitland''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (28 May 1850 – [[Circa|c.]] 19 December 1906) was an English historian and lawyer who is regarded as the modern father of English [[legal history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pluralism and the Personality of the State|last = Runciman|first = David| authorlink = David Runciman|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1997|isbn =9780521551915 |location = Cambridge|pages = xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education, 1850–72 ==
Frederic William Maitland was born at 53 [[Guilford Street]], London in 1850, the only son and second of three children of [[John Gorham Maitland]] and of Emma, daughter of [[John Frederic Daniell]]. His grandfather was [[Samuel Roffey Maitland]]. Maitland's father was a barrister but, having little practice, became a civil servant, serving as secretary to the [[Civil Service Commission (United Kingdom)|Civil Service Commission]].

Maitland was educated at a preparatory school in Brighton before entering [[Eton College]] in 1863, where [[Edward Daniel Stone]] was his private tutor. At Eton, Maitland was not prominent either academically or athletically, although a close school friend thought he would become "a kind of philosophic [[Charles Lamb]]". He then matriculated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1869 as a [[Commoner (academia)|commoner]]. A dislike of [[classics]] acquired at Eton initially led him to read mathematics, with little success. Then, inspired by [[Henry Sidgwick]], he switched to the relatively new moral sciences [[tripos]] in 1870, and took first-class honours in 1872, being bracketed senior with his friend [[William Cunningham (economist)|William Cunningham]]; he was elected a scholar of his college the same year. The following year, he took his degree and won the [[William Whewell|Whewell]] Scholarship in international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MTLT868FW|name=Maitland, Frederic William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular among his contemporaries, Maitland was elected secretary, then president, of the [[Cambridge Union Society|Cambridge Union]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=34837|title=Maitland, Frederic William (1850–1906)|first=S. F. C.|last=Milsom|authorlink=S. F. C. Milsom}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also, like his father before him, a [[Cambridge Apostle]]. A lover of exercice since his Eton days, he rowed for Trinity and ran for the university, winning a [[Blue (university sport)|blue]] for representing the university in three-mile races.

Maitland's mother had died in 1851, shortly after the birth of his younger sister. Then, both his father and grandfather died when he was still at school. From his grandfather he inherited a [[manor house]] and some land in [[Brookthorpe]], [[Gloucestershire]]. The estate provided him with an income until the agricultural depression in the 1880s.

== Career at the bar and early efforts, 1872–84 ==

=== Career at the bar ===
After Cambridge, Maitland tried to gain a fellowship in philosophy at Trinity College in 1875 with a dissertation entitled ''A Historical Sketch of Liberty and Equality: As Ideals of English Political Philosophy from the Time of Hobbes to the Time of Coleridge'', but was beaten out by fellow Apostle [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]]. Having joined [[Lincoln's Inn]] as a student in 1872, he was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] there in 1876, and became a competent [[Equity (law)|equity]] lawyer and conveyancer.

Meanwhile, encouraged by Sidgwick, he began a book on property law, but abandoned it out of frustration at certain features of English property law; he expressed these sentiments in an anonymous article in the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' in 1879, described as "a bold, eloquent, and humorous plea for a sweeping change in the English law of Real Property". It was followed by three further articles in the ''Law Magazine and Review'' between 1881 and 1883.

=== Meeting with Vinogradoff ===
In 1880, Maitland was introduced by [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Frederick Pollock]], who had been to Eton and Cambridge with him, to the Sunday Tramps, a walking club founded by [[Leslie Stephen]]. Through Pollock, Maitland was introduced in 1884 to [[Paul Vinogradoff]], a Russian medievalist who was in England to study records lodged in the [[Public Record Office|Public Records Office]].

Maitland would later write that the day of his first meeting with Vinogradoff "determined the rest of my life". According to [[H. A. L. Fisher]], Maitland was so chagrined by the fact that a Russian knew more about English legal records than he did that he made his first visit to the PRO shortly thereafter, though [[Geoffrey Elton]] points out that Maitland had already been working in the archives before he met Vinogradoff. The result of Maitland's initial work was ''Pleas of the Crown for the County of Gloucester'', a transcription of the 1221 Gloucestershire [[Eyre (legal term)|eyre]] [[Rotulus|roll]], which he published at his own expense in 1884 and dedicated to Vinogradoff.

== Return to Cambridge and marriage, 1884–88 ==
In 1884, Maitland was elected [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in English law at Cambridge, having failed to be elected to a readership at Oxford the previous year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The post had been personally endowed by Sidgwick, to the tune of £300 a year for four years. In 1887, Maitland published, again at his own expense, an edition of [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]]'s note book in three volumes, acting on a suggestion by Vinogradoff. He also published extensively on legal history in the ''[[Law Quarterly Review]]'', which was edited by Sidgwick.

On 20 July 1886, Maitland married [[Florence Henrietta Darwin|Florence Henrietta Fisher]] in a village church in Hampshire. He had met her through Stephen: her aunt was Stephen's second wife. Fisher was the daughter of [[Herbert William Fisher]] and the sister of [[H. A. L. Fisher]], a future Liberal minister and Maitland's biographer. They had two daughters: Ermengard (named after a woman whose name appeared in Bracton's note book) in 1887 and [[Fredegond Shove|Fredegond]] in 1889. By all account the marriage was a success, and the household a happy one.

=== Selden Society ===
In 1887, Maitland was among the founders of the [[Selden Society]], established to promote the study of the history of English law, mainly through the publication of English legal manuscripts. The Society's first years were rocky: its treasurer, P. E. Dove, committed suicide in 1894, leaving behind a deficit of £1,000. Nevertheless, the Society published a steady stream of volumes under Maitland's direction as its first literary director. He personally edited eight volumes for the Society, contributed to more, and personally reviewed the proofs of every volume.

== Downing Professor, 1888–1906 ==
In 1888, Maitland was elected [[Downing Professor of the Laws of England]], becoming a fellow of [[Downing College, Cambridge|Downing College]]. On 13 October 1888 he gave his inaugural lecture, "Why the History of English Law is Not Written". The post carried with it an official residence, and Maitland's family settled in happily. He held frequent musical gatherings, and kept a series of exotic pets, including a monkey, a meerkat, and a badger. The same year, he published ''Select pleas of the Crown, A.D. 1200–1225'', the first publication of the Selden Society.

In addition to teaching duties, Maitland served on numerous University and college bodies. He advocated for a number of reforms, including the abandonment of Greek as a compulsory entrance subject and the admission of women to degrees. In March 1897 he helped defeat a proposal for the creation of a Queen's University for women only as an alternative to granting them Cambridge degrees, making a speech which was long afterwards remembered.

Meanwhile, Maitland published extensively, making important contributions to the ''[[Cambridge Modern History]]'', the ''[[English Historical Review]]'', the ''[[Law Quarterly Review]]'', ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' and other publications. He delivered the [[Ford Lectures]] in English history at Oxford in 1897 (later published as ''Township and Borough'') and the [[Rede Lecture]] in 1901. His most important work, ''The History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I'', appeared in 1895. It was co-authored with his friend [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Sir Frederick Pollock]], though the latter only write the chapter on Anglo-Saxon law: "Chapter 1...was Pollock's work, and Maitland's reaction was never to let him write another." Popularly known as "Pollock and Maitland", ''The History of English Law'' has been described as "the best book on English legal history ever published in the English language."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Law's History: American Legal Thought and the Transatlantic Turn to History|last=Rabban|first=David M.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902 Maitland was offered the [[Regius Professor of History (Cambridge)|Regius Professorship of Modern History]] at Cambridge by [[Arthur Balfour]] in succession to [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]], but declined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the same year he became one the founding fellows of the [[British Academy]].

== Final years and death ==
Maitland's health began to deteriorate in the 1890s: the exact nature of his illness remains unclear, but has been variously ascribed to [[tuberculosis]] or to [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. In 1898 he suffered from an attack of [[pleurisy]], and thereafter he wintered either in the [[Canary Islands]] or in [[Madeira]]. In December 1906, he left Cambridge for the Canaries for the last time: during the trip, he contracted [[influenza]], which turned into double pneumonia. He died at Las Palmas and was buried in the English Cemetery there.

Upon his death, the University of Oxford presented an address of condolence to Cambridge, described by [[Geoffrey Elton|Sir Geoffrey Elton]] as an "unprecedented tribute."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=F.W. Maitland|last=Elton|first=G.R.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=1|author-link=Geoffrey Elton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such addresses were often presented to the royal family, but the only precedent in the case of Maitland was an address to the [[University of Berlin]] upon the death of [[Theodor Mommsen]].

Posthumous publications by his students, editing their lecture notes based on his lectures, include ''The Constitutional History of England'', ''Equity'', and ''The Forms of Action at Common Law''. The latter publication has been repeatedly reprinted, and contains perhaps his most-quoted observation, which still appears in learned articles and superior court judgments:
"The [[Form of action|forms of action]] we have buried but still they rule us from their graves."

== Personal life ==
Maitland married [[Florence Henrietta Fisher]], daughter of the historian [[Herbert William Fisher]], in 1886&lt;ref name="Times19061222" /&gt; and they had two daughters, Ermengard (1887–1968) and [[Fredegond Shove|Fredegond]] (1889–1949); after Maitland's death his widow married Sir [[Francis Darwin]], a son of [[Charles Darwin]]. Florence Fisher's brother, the Liberal scholar and politician [[H. A. L. Fisher]], edited Maitland's papers and lectures on English constitutional history after his death.

== Scholarship ==

=== Approach and style ===
His written style was elegant and lively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/224/0221.html ''"Frederic William Maitland,"''] The Cambridge History of English and American Literature, Volume XIV. The Victorian Age, Part Two: Historians, Biographers and Political Orators, Putnam, 1907–1921.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[historical method]] was distinguished by his thorough and sensitive use of historical sources, and by his determinedly historical perspective. Maitland taught his students, and all later historians, not to investigate the history of law purely or mostly by reference to the needs of the present, but rather to consider and seek to understand the past on its own terms.

=== ''Memoranda de Parliamento'' ===
In 1889, Maitland was invited by [[Henry Maxwell Lyte]], the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records, to examine and edit the petitions presented to [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s parliament. Maitland quickly determined that the task was too large to be completed by one man. However, by chance he discovered a hitherto-unpublished [[Rolls of Parliament|parliament roll]] from 1305, which he edited and published in 1883 as part of the [[Rolls Series]]. This formed the basis of what Elton described as his "most explosive contribution to English history."

At the time, it was generally believed that early English parliaments were, from the beginning, an assembly of the [[estates of the realm]] who met to discuss affairs of state. This view had been laid down by [[William Stubbs|Stubbs]], who based his view on the 1295 "[[Model Parliament]]". In his introduction to the 1305 roll, Maitland instead proposed that early English parliaments were judicial bodies which met mainly to receive petitions to address grievances. Though the revolutionary nature of Maitland's suggestion was only realised later, most historians have come to accept Maitland's view.

=== "Why the history of English Law is not written?" ===
On 13 October 1888, Maitland gave his inaugural lecture as Downing Professor of the Laws of England. Pointing out that "no attempt has ever been made to write the history of English law as a whole", he proposed two causes: the insularity of English law and the conflicting logics of the lawyer and of the historian.

== Assessment ==
Maitland was held in high regard by his contemporaries. [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] called him the ablest historian in England.

Maitland's reputation has stood high since his death. Speaking in 1980, [[S. F. C. Milsom]] said that Maitland is "not just revered but loved" by historians, while in 1985, [[Geoffrey Elton|Sir Geoffrey Elton]] wrote of Maitland as the "patron saint" of historians.

Beginning in the 1960s, scholars such as [[S. F. C. Milsom]] and [[Patrick Wormald]] began to point out shortcomings in Maitland's views, which had by then become the orthodoxy, although the criticisms were inevitably coupled with sincere admiration for Maitland. The highly technical nature of Maitland's work, as well as the relative decline of legal history, made Maitland's views "lasting orthodoxies", as few historians had either the technical knowledge or the inclination to challenge them. Speaking on the centenary of the publication of ''Pollock and Maitland'', Milson said that:&lt;blockquote&gt;"if we go on as we are, we can look forward to our successors celebrating the bicentenary of 'Pollock and Maitland' as still the last word on the history of English law in its most crucial period. I wonder whether he would be pleased."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Honours and memorials==
During his lifetime, Maitland received honorary doctorates from the universities of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (1891), [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (1899), [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] (1896), [[University of Moscow|Moscow]] and [[Krakow University|Kracow]]. He was one of the founding fellows of the [[British Academy]] in 1902, and was a corresponding member of the [[Prussian Academy of Arts|Royal Prussian Academy of the Arts]] and of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]. He was also an honorary fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and an honorary [[bencher]] of [[Lincoln's Inn]]. On the latter honour, Maitland wrote to Pollock that "one of the vacant bishoprics would have been less of a surprise". Just before his death Maitland received the Ames Medal from [[Harvard Law School]], and at the time of the death he had been invited by Oxford to deliver the [[Romanes Lecture]].

After his death, the F. W. Maitland Memorial Fund was established at Cambridge in 1907 to promote research in legal history. It continues to award grants and studentships for that purpose. In 2000, a Maitland Legal History Room was established within the [[Squire Law Library]] of the [[Faculty of Law, University of Cambridge|Faculty of Law at the University of Cambridge]]. The Maitland Historical Society of [[Downing College, Cambridge]], is also named in his honour.

At Oxford, a Maitland Library, begun with 300 books from Maitland's personal library, was established in 1908. Originally housed at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], it was eventually taken over by the Bodleian Library, and was maintained as a separate collection until 1933.

In 2001, a memorial stone for Maitland was unveiled in [[Poet's Corner]], [[Westminster Abbey]]; he was the first professional historian to be so honoured.&lt;ref name="ducksoupdev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/visit-us/highlights/poets-corner|title=Poets' Corner – Westminster Abbey|author=Imogen Levy and Duck Soup http://ducksoupdev.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325133909/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/visit-us/highlights/poets-corner|archive-date=25 March 2009|dead-url=yes|accessdate=20 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone, cut by [[Richard Kindersley]], is inscribed with a quote from ''Doomsday Book and Beyond'': "By slow degrees the thoughts of our forefathers their common thoughts about common things will have become thinkable once more".

'''Géraud-Marie de Sède, baron de Liéoux''' (5 June 1921 &amp;ndash; 29 May 2004) was a [[France|French]] author, writing under the [[Pen name|nom-de-plume]] of Gérard de Sède, and a member of various [[surrealist]] organizations. He was born into an aristocratic family from [[Comminges]], the son of Marcel Alfred Gustave de Sède, baron de Liéoux&lt;ref&gt;The French aristocratic family, the De Goth are said to have held during the fifteenth century, the barony of Liéoux, ''revue de Comminges'', Tome XIV (1899), p 301. [[Pope Clement V]] was a member of the De Goth family and he is indirectly associated with Rennes-le-Château, Richard Bordes, ''Les Mérovingiens à Rennes-le-Château: mythes ou réalités'', Philippe Schrauben éditeur (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; and Aimée de Sède de Liéoux 's first cousins, once removed. De Sède's father was the senior editor of the Catholic newspaper ''Le Courrier du Pas-de-Calais'' owned by the De Sède family.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Visse, ''La presse du Nord et du Pas-de-Calais au temps de l'Echo du Nord : 1918-1944'', page 140 (Presses Universitaires du Septentrion, 1 avril 2004). {{ISBN|2859398325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Sède authored more than 20 books and contributed articles to various magazines, sometimes using the pseudonyms ''Pumaz'', ''Allard'', ''Gillot'' and ''Simon''.&lt;ref&gt;John Saul &amp; Janice A. Glaholm, ''Rennes-le-Château, A Bibliography'', page 45 (London: Mercurius Press, 1985). {{ISBN|0-9510517-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his 1967 book ''L'Or de Rennes, ou La Vie insolite de Bérenger Saunière, curé de Rennes-le-Château'' ("The Gold of Rennes, or The Strange Life of Bérenger Saunière, Priest of Rennes-le-Château"), published as a paperback in 1968 entitled ''Le Trésor Maudit de Rennes-le-Château'' ("The Accursed Treasure of Rennes-le-Château"). A revised and updated version entitled ''Signé: Rose+Croix'' was published in 1977.

==Early life==
After passing his [[Baccalauréat]], de Sède began studying law and literature where he met his future wife Marie-Andrée at the [[Sorbonne]]. It was during this period that he established contacts with the [[Surrealist]]s and began producing his first works.

In 1941, he was a member of the Surrealist group "La Main à Plume", which was named after a phrase by [[Rimbaud]], "La main à plume vaut la main à charrue" ("The hand that writes is equal to the hand that ploughs").

The group published a series of pamphlets.  Its third issue, in 1943, included Gérard de Sède's ''L'Incendie habitable'' ("The Inhabitable Fire").&lt;ref&gt;Anne Vernay, Richard Walter, ''La Main à plume: Anthologie du surréalisme sous l'Occupation'' (Editions Syllepse, 2008). {{ISBN|2-84950-153-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gérard de Sède was active in the war during the German occupation of Paris, working with the [[French Forces of the Interior|Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur]] (FFI), for which he received two citations. He was imprisoned by the Germans in [[Bourges]].

Regarding the Resistance as a way of establishing a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]], de Sède moved about in [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] circles.

De Sède married Marie-Andrée in February 1947, commonly known as 'Sophie', who had been his companion in the resistance. He decided to study philosophy and became a pupil of [[Gaston Bachelard]], under whom he wrote a dissertation on [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

At the beginning of the 1950s de Sède associated with the poets [[Nazim Hikmet]] and [[Edouard Glissant]], and with the philosopher [[Henri Lefebvre]]. At the same time he re-established contact with [[André Breton]].

Attracted by the [[Titoism|politics of Marshal Tito]], de Sède moved to [[Yugoslavia]] with his wife and children before returning to France, holding several jobs in journalism before deciding to become a farmer.

==Gisors==
[[File:Chateau-de-Gisors.jpg|thumb|right|The 13th century [[keep]] of Gisors]]
It was during his period as a farmer that he employed and got to know Roger Lhomoy - Lhomoy had previously worked since 1929 as a tourist guide at the [[Château de Gisors]] in [[Normandy]] and claimed to have discovered under the tower [[Keep|donjon]] in March 1946, a secret entrance to a long basement thirty meters long, nine meters wide, and approximately four and a half meters high, saying it was a subterranean chapel dedicated to [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]]. He alleged it contained nineteen [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] of stone, each two meters long and sixty centimeters wide, with 30 iron [[coffer]]s arranged in columns of ten. Lhomoy said it was the treasure of the [[Knights Templar]]&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dauzats, "Sous le donjon de Gisors, dans une crypte fabuleuse, un homme affirme avoir vu le trésor des Templiers", in ''Noir et Blanc'', pages 560-561, Number 913, 31 August 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; These allegations inspired Gérard de Sède to write a magazine article about Gisors, that caught the attention of [[Pierre Plantard]], who wrote to de Sède. They collaborated on ''Les Templiers sont parmi nous, ou, L'Enigme de Gisors'' ("The Templars are Amongst Us, or The Enigma of Gisors"), that was published in 1962, containing passing references to the [[Priory of Sion]]. Lhomoy was finally dismissed as a liar when in 1964 an official excavation produced a negative result.&lt;ref&gt;"En 1964, l'heure est grave: devant une si forte pression populaire, il faut clarifier les choses. [[André Malraux]], Ministre de la Culture, envoie le 5ème génie militaire de Rouen entreprendre des fouilles dans la motte. Ces fouilles effectuées sous forme de sapes (galerie horizontale) seront catastrophiques pour l'état du donjon. Pas plus que les archéologues, les militaires ne trouveront l'once d'un coffre ou d'une salle souterraine." [http://www.ville-gisors.fr/Culture-Loisirs-et-Association-Patrimoine-La-ville]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippe de Chérisey]], a friend and associate of Pierre Plantard, later claimed in 1978 that the subterranean chapel contained "30 iron coffers of the archives of the Priory of Sion."&lt;ref&gt;Philippe de Chérisey, ''L'Ënigme de Rennes'', page 2 (1978). Bibliothèque nationale, EL 4-Z PIECE-110 and EL 4-Z PIECE-111&lt;/ref&gt;

==L'Or de Rennes==
[[File:TresorMaudit.jpg|right|thumb|''Le Trésor Maudit de Rennes-le-Chateau'', 1968]] 
De Sède and Plantard collaborated next on the subject of [[Rennes-le-Château]], resulting in the publication of ''L'Or de Rennes'' in 1967.

Originally a Pierre Plantard manuscript that failed to find a publisher,&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair, ''L’Or de Rennes, mise au point'' (La Garenne-Colombes, 35 bis, Bd de la République, 92250; Bibliothèque Nationale, Dépôt Légal 02-03-1979, 4° Z Piece 1182).
&lt;/ref&gt; and extensively rewritten by Gérard de Sède, ''L'Or de Rennes'' presented as fact various claims about [[Bérenger Saunière]] and Rennes-le-Château that were the authors' inventions, in order to embellish a story about the discovery of a hidden secret. The book was most famous for its reproduction of two "parchments" that were allegedly discovered by the priest: but for a variety of different reasons they have been identified as forgeries by Philippe de Chérisey.

The central claim in ''L'Or de Rennes'' was that Saunière found parchments proving that the lineage of the "last" Merovingian king, [[Dagobert II]], assassinated on 23 December 679, did not die with him as had previously been thought. His son was presumed to have escaped the massacre and took refuge at Rennes-le-Château, where he founded a line of descent before being buried in 758 in the church crypt. These genealogical documents implicated to an exceptional degree the Priory of Sion, a secret organisation working behind the scenes ever since the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] and [[Capetian dynasty|Capetian]] usurpations for the recognition of the legitimacy of the Merovingian line of descent to the throne of France. Pierre Plantard claimed to be descended from Dagobert II.

De Sède and Plantard fell out over book royalties relating to ''L'Or de Rennes'' and never worked together again, at the same time Philippe de Chérisey announced the "parchments" were his creations that he later elaborated upon in his 1978 unpublished document entitled ''L'Énigme de Rennes'', claiming they were originally made for his friend Francis Blanche, as material for a French radio serial entitled ''Signé Furax''.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe de Chérisey, ''L'Énigme de Rennes''. Bibliothèque Nationale, EL 4- Z PIECE- 110. Dépôt Légal, 6 June 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''Signé Furax'' radio series has recently been released on CD albums [http://musique.fnac.com/a1288343/Humour-Signe-Furax-CD-album]. It was created by Pierre Dac (real name André Isaac, 1893-1975) and Francis Blanche (1921-1974), and directed by Pierre-Arnaud de Chassy Poulay (Pierre Arnaud). A film adaption of the radio series, directed by [[Marc Simenon]] was released in 1981 [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081513/].&lt;/ref&gt; The story about the parchments was previously given in the 1977 document by Jean Delaude entitled ''Le Cercle d'Ulysse''.&lt;ref&gt;"The so-called manuscripts presented by Gérard de Sède are false.  The originals were fabricated in 1961 by Marquis Philippe de Chérisey and deposited in May 1962 with a solicitor, Maître Boccon-Gibod.  Also, Gérard de Sède only had ''photocopies'' of the originals as reproduced in his book L'Or de Rennes.  Better still, this same marquis spiced up his joke by publishing in June 1971 (which he registered [at the Bibliothèque Nationale]), a work on Rennes, with the decipherment of the original.  The book is called ''Circuit''." In Jean Delaude, ''Le Cercle d'Ulysse'' (Toulouse, 1977). Bibliothèque Nationale, 4- LK7- 51754. Dépôt Légal, 4 August 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

''L'Or de Rennes'' was to have a lasting impact on British script-writer [[Henry Lincoln]], who read the book while on holiday in the [[Cévennes]] in 1969, leading him to inspire three [[BBC Two]] [[Chronicle (UK TV series)|Chronicle]] documentaries, as well as working some of its material into the 1982 bestseller ''[[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]]'' which itself was used as source material for the bestselling 2003 novel by [[Dan Brown]], ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.

==Later years==
Gérard de Sède returned to the subject matter of Bérenger Saunière during the late 1980s  writing ''Rennes-le-Château: le dossier, les impostures, les phantasmes, les hypothèses'',  discounting the Plantard-related material that had appeared over the previous 20 years. He claimed Saunière obtained his wealth from the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] in return for parchments containing "politico-genealogical secrets" about the descent of [[Louis XVII of France|Louis XVII]].&lt;ref&gt;Gérard de Sède, ''Rennes-le-Château: le dossier, les impostures, les phantasmes, les hypothèses'', page 255 (Paris: Robert Laffont, Les Énigmes de l'univers collection, 1988). {{ISBN|2-221-05522-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed the "Merovingian romance" was a parody where Dagobert II replaced [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], his son [[Sigebert IV]] replaced [[Louis XVII of France|Louis XVII]] and Pierre Plantard replaced [[Karl Wilhelm Naundorff|Charles-Guillaume Naundorff]].&lt;ref&gt;Gérard de Sède, ''Rennes-le-Château: le dossier'', page 258&lt;/ref&gt;

He afterwards moved to Nicaragua, then to Belgium, before returning to France during the 1990s.

Gérard de Sède died in [[Désertines, Allier|Désertines]] (Montluçon), on Saturday, 29 May 2004, de Sède's coffin was draped with the flag of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Franck Ferrand, ''Au coeur de l'histoire'', [[Europe 1]], guests, Christian Doumergue and Jacques Ravenne, radio show aired on 2 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in [[Lieoux]].

==Priory of Sion==
In a 2005 TV documentary, de Sede's son Arnaud stated categorically that his father and Plantard had made up the existence of the Priory of Sion &amp;mdash; to quote Arnaud de Sède in the programme, "it is absolute piffle".&lt;ref&gt;''The Real Da Vinci Code'', Channel Four Television, presented by Tony Robinson, transmitted on 3 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Hungary}}
This article is about the '''history of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] from October 1918 to November 1940'''.

==Hungarian Democratic Republic==
{{main article|Hungarian Democratic Republic}}
{{See also|Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)}}
On October 31, 1918, the [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]] was created by revolution that started in [[Budapest]] after the dissolution and break-up of [[Austria-Hungary]] at the end of [[World War I]].  The official proclamation of the republic was on November 16, 1918, and [[Mihály Károlyi]] was named as the republic's [[List of Prime Ministers of Hungary|Prime Minister]]. This event also marked the independence of Hungary which had been ruled by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] for several centuries.

The Hungarian Democratic Republic did not last long.  Another revolution in 1919 marked the end of this state and the creation of a new [[communist]] state known as Hungarian Soviet Republic.

==Hungarian Republic of Councils==

{{main article|Hungarian Republic of Councils}}

[[File:Pepperspeaks.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Communist [[József Pogány]] speaks to revolutionary soldiers during the 1919 revolution]]
The rise of the [[Hungarian Communist Party]] (HCP) to power was rapid. The party was organized in a [[Moscow]] hotel on November 4, 1918, when a group of Hungarian prisoners of war and communist sympathizers formed a Central Committee and dispatched members to Hungary to recruit new members, propagate the party's ideas, and radicalize [[Mihály Károlyi|Károlyi]]'s government. By February 1919, the party numbered 30,000 to 40,000 members, including many unemployed ex-soldiers, young intellectuals, and Jews.&lt;ref name=US1&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/hungary/28.htm  ''Hungarian Soviet Republic''. U.S. Library of Congress Country Study]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, [[Béla Kun]] was imprisoned for incitement to riot, but his popularity skyrocketed when a journalist reported that he had been beaten by the police. Kun emerged from jail triumphant when the Social Democrats handed power to a government of "People's Commissars," who proclaimed the Hungarian Soviet Republic on March 21, 1919.

The communists wrote a temporary [[constitution]] guaranteeing [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]]; free education, language and cultural rights to [[Demographics of Hungary|minorities]]; and other rights. It also provided for [[suffrage]] for people over eighteen years of age except [[clergy]], "former exploiters," and certain others. Single-list elections took place in April, but members of the parliament were selected indirectly by popularly elected committees. On June 25, Kun's government proclaimed a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], nationalized industrial and commercial enterprises, and socialized housing, transport, banking, medicine, cultural institutions, and all landholdings of more than 40.5 hectares. Kun undertook these measures even though the Hungarian communists were relatively few, and the support they enjoyed was based far more on their program to restore Hungary's borders than on their revolutionary agenda. Kun hoped that the [[Russian SFSR|Russia]]n government would intervene on Hungary's behalf and that a [[World revolution|worldwide workers' revolution]] was imminent. In an effort to secure its rule in the interim, the communist government resorted to arbitrary violence. [[Revolutionary tribunal (Hungary)|Revolutionary tribunal]]s ordered about 590 executions, including some for "crimes against the revolution."&lt;ref name=US1/&gt;  The government also used "[[red terror]]" to expropriate grain from peasants. This violence and the regime's moves against the clergy also shocked many Hungarians.

In late May, Kun attempted to fulfill his promise to restore [[Greater Hungary (political concept)|Hungary's borders]]. The Hungarian Red Army marched northward and reoccupied part of [[Slovakia]]. Despite initial military success, however, Kun withdrew his troops about three weeks later when the [[France|French]] threatened to intervene. This concession shook his popular support. Kun then unsuccessfully turned the Hungarian Red Army on the [[Romania]]ns, who [[Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919|broke through Hungarian lines]] on July 30, occupied [[Budapest]], and ousted Kun's Soviet Republic on August 1, 1919. Kun fled first to [[Vienna]] and then to the Russian SFSR, where he was executed during [[Great Purge|Stalin's purge]] of foreign communists in the late 1930s.

=== Counterrevolution===
A militantly anti-communist authoritarian government composed of military officers entered Budapest on the heels of the Romanians. A "[[White Terror (Hungary)|white terror]]" ensued that led to the imprisonment, torture, and execution without trial of [[communists]], [[socialists]], [[Jews]], [[leftist]] intellectuals, sympathizers with the Károlyi and Kun regimes, and others who threatened the traditional Hungarian political order that the officers sought to reestablish. Estimates placed the number of executions at approximately 5,000.&lt;ref name=US2&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/hungary/29.htm ''Counterrevolution''. U.S. Library of Congress Country Study]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, about 75,000 people were jailed.&lt;ref name=US2/&gt; In particular, the Hungarian right wing and the Romanian forces targeted Jews for retribution. Ultimately, the white terror forced nearly 100,000 people to leave the country, most of them socialists, intellectuals, and middle-class Jews.&lt;ref name=US2/&gt;

==Monarchy restored==
{{main article|Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1944)}}
In March 1920, Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]] was named [[Regent]] and [[Sándor Simonyi-Semadam]] was named [[List of Prime Ministers of Hungary|Prime Minister]] of the restored Kingdom of Hungary.  [[Charles I of Austria]] (known as Charles IV, Karl IV, or IV. Károly in Hungary) was the last [[Emperor of Austria]] and the last [[King of Hungary]]. He was not asked to fill the vacant Hungarian throne.

The government of Horthy immediately declared null and void all laws and edicts passed by the Karolyi and Kun regimes, in effect renouncing the 1918 armistice. Horthy's authoritarianism and the violent anti-communist backlash resulted in interwar Hungary having one of the quietest political landscapes in Eastern Europe. Later on, when he wished to take out loans from the West, they pressured him into democratic reforms. Horthy only did as much as he absolutely had to, since the Western powers were geographically distant from Hungary and soon turned their attention to matters elsewhere.

Horthy appointed [[Pál Teleki]] as Prime Minister in July 1920. His right-wing government set quotas effectively limiting admission of Jews to universities, legalized capital punishment, and to quiet rural discontent, took initial steps towards fulfilling a promise of major land reform by dividing about 385,000 hectares from the largest estates into smallholdings. Teleki's government resigned, however, after the former Austrian Emperor, [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV]], unsuccessfully [[Charles IV of Hungary's conflict with Miklós Horthy|attempted to retake Hungary's throne]] in March 1921. King Charles' return split parties between conservatives who favored a [[Habsburg]] restoration and nationalist right-wing radicals who supported election of a Hungarian king. [[István Bethlen]], a nonaffiliated, right-wing member of the parliament, took advantage of this rift by convincing members of the Christian National Union who opposed Karl's re-enthronement to merge with the Smallholders' Party and form a new Party of Unity with Bethlen as its leader. Horthy then appointed Bethlen Prime Minister.

As Prime Minister, Bethlen dominated Hungarian politics between 1921 and 1931. He fashioned a political machine by amending the electoral law, eliminating peasants from the Party of Unity, providing jobs in the bureaucracy to his supporters, and manipulating elections in rural areas. Bethlen restored order to the country by giving the radical counter-revolutionaries payoffs and government jobs in exchange for ceasing their campaign of terror against Jews and leftists. In 1921, Bethlen made a deal with the Social Democrats and trade unions, agreeing, among other things, to legalize their activities and free political prisoners in return for their pledge to refrain from spreading anti-Hungarian propaganda, calling political strikes, and organizing the peasantry. In May 1922, the Party of Unity captured a large parliamentary majority. Charles IV's death, soon after he failed a second time to reclaim the throne in October 1921, allowed the revision of the [[Treaty of Trianon]] to rise to the top of Hungary's political agenda. Bethlen's strategy to win the treaty's revision was first to strengthen his country's economy and then to build relations with stronger nations that could further Hungary's goals. Revision of the treaty had such a broad backing in Hungary that Bethlen used it, at least in part, to deflect criticism of his economic, social, and political policies. However, Bethlen's only foreign policy success was a treaty of friendship with [[Italy]] in 1927, which had little immediate impact.

== Postwar political and economic conditions ==
{{further information|Treaty of Trianon}} 
In 1920 and 1921, internal chaos racked Hungary. The white terror continued to plague Jews and leftists, unemployment and inflation soared, and penniless Hungarian refugees poured across the border from neighboring countries and burdened the floundering economy. The government offered the population little succor. In January 1920, Hungarian men and women cast the first secret ballots in the country's political history and elected a large counterrevolutionary and agrarian majority to a unicameral parliament. Two main political parties emerged: the socially conservative Christian National Union and the [[Civic Freedom Party|Independent Smallholders' Party]], which advocated land reform. In March, the parliament annulled both the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] and the [[Compromise of 1867]], and it restored the [[Hungarian monarchy]] but postponed electing a king until civil disorder had subsided. Instead, Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]]— a former commander in chief of the Austro-Hungarian navy—was elected [[regent]] and was empowered, among other things, to appoint [[List of Prime Ministers of Hungary|Hungary's prime minister]], veto legislation, convene or dissolve the parliament, and command the armed forces.

Hungary's signing of the [[Treaty of Trianon]] on June 4, 1920, ratified the country's dismemberment, limited the size of its armed forces, and required reparations payments. The territorial provisions of the treaty, which ensured continued discord between Hungary and its neighbors, required the Hungarians to surrender more than two-thirds of their prewar lands. [[Romania]] acquired [[Transylvania]]; [[Yugoslavia]] gained [[Croatia]], [[Slavonia]], and [[Vojvodina]]; [[Slovakia]] became a part of [[Czechoslovakia]]; and [[Austria]] also acquired a small piece of pre-war Hungarian territory. Hungary also lost about 60 percent of its pre-war population, and about one-third of the 10 million ethnic [[Hungarians]] found themselves outside the diminished homeland.&lt;ref name=US3&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/hungary/30.htm ''Trianon Hungary''. U.S. Library of Congress Country Study]&lt;/ref&gt; The country's ethnic composition was left almost homogeneous. Hungarians constituted about 90 percent of the [[Demographics of Hungary|population]], Germans made up about 6 to 8 percent, and Slovaks, Croats, Romanians, Jews, and other minorities accounted for the remainder.&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;

New international borders separated Hungary's industrial base from its sources of raw materials and its former markets for agricultural and industrial products. Its new circumstances forced Hungary to become a trading nation. Hungary lost 84 percent of its timber resources, 43 percent of its arable land, and 83 percent of its iron ore.&lt;ref name=US3/&gt; Because most of the country's prewar industry was concentrated near Budapest, Hungary retained about 51 percent of its industrial population, 56 percent of its industry, 82 percent of its heavy industry, and 70 percent of its banks.&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;

=== Economic development ===
When Bethlen took office, the government was all-but-bankrupt. Tax revenues were so paltry that he turned to domestic gold and foreign-currency reserves to meet about half of the 1921-22 budget and almost 80 percent of the 1922-23 budget. To improve his country's economic circumstances, Bethlen undertook development of industry. He imposed tariffs on finished goods and earmarked the revenues to subsidize new industries. Bethlen squeezed the agricultural sector to increase cereal exports, which generated foreign currency to pay for imports critical to the industrial sector. Further compounding Hungary's problems was the fact that of its four neighbors, three (Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia) were enemies and kept troops stationed on their borders at all times, even though Hungary had an army of only 20,000 men. The fourth, Austria, was a struggling nation and little more than an economic competitor. In 1924, after the white terror had waned and Hungary had gained admission to the [[League of Nations]] (1922), the Bethlen government was able to borrow a 50 million USD loan from the League, which in order to protect its investment placed the country in effective receivership, even placing an American banker, Jeremiah Smith, in charge of the country's finances. Hungary's outcast status had prevented it from obtaining any foreign aid in the immediate postwar period, but by the middle of the 1920s, the British decided to extend the hand of friendship to the losers of World War I. Hungary also obtained sympathy from the United States and Mussolini's Italy. Meanwhile, France and Hungary's neighbors vigorously objected.

By the late 1920s, Bethlen's policies had brought order to the economy. The number of factories increased by about 66 percent, inflation subsided, and the national income climbed 20 percent. However, the apparent stability was supported by a rickety framework of constantly revolving foreign credits and high world grain prices; therefore, Hungary remained undeveloped in comparison with the wealthier [[western Europe]]an countries, as most of the foreign loans went for non-productive purposes such as graft, expanding bureaucracy, and monumental public works projects. Agricultural products were subject to unstable prices and the vagaries of the weather. Furthermore, tariffs were commonplace in America and Europe during the 1920s, which frequently made it difficult to export. Hungary was no exception and liberally employed trade barriers to protect its manufacturing base. Exports also had to pass through Hungary's neighbors to reach the West, and as noted above, all but one was hostile.

Despite economic progress, the workers' standard of living remained poor, and consequently the working class never gave Bethlen its political support. The labor movement had never developed in pre-World War I Hungary the way it did in Austria, and the Horthy government remained resolutely opposed to organized labor or social reforms. There was no minimum wage or any sort of labor laws in Hungary almost until the start of World War II, and wages were further undercut by peasants flocking into Budapest who were willing to work for almost nothing. On the whole, workers fared more poorly in interwar Hungary then they had before World War I. The peasants were even worse off than the working class. In the 1920s, about 60 percent of the peasants were either landless or were cultivating plots too small to provide a decent living. Real wages for agricultural workers remained below prewar levels, and the peasants had practically no political voice. Moreover, once Bethlen had consolidated his power, he ignored calls for land reform. The industrial sector failed to expand fast enough to provide jobs for all the peasants and university graduates seeking work. Most peasants lingered in the villages, and in the 1930s Hungarians in rural areas were extremely dissatisfied. Hungary's foreign debt ballooned as Bethlen expanded the bureaucracy to absorb the university graduates who, if left idle, might have threatened civil order. This was because Hungary, like the rest of Eastern Europe, had an educational system primarily focused on the liberal arts and law rather than science, engineering, or other practical subjects that might have helped the country's development. University graduates mostly sought employment in the bureaucracy, where they were guaranteed an easy, secure job. When they could not obtain work, either because they lacked useful skills or because the swollen bureaucracy had no openings available, they would invariably blame their bad luck on Jews. This would contribute to an anti-Semitism in Hungary that would ultimately have tragic consequences.

Following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] in the [[United States]] and the beginning of the [[Great Depression]], world grain prices plummeted, and the framework supporting [[Economy of Hungary|Hungary's economy]] buckled. Hungary's earnings from grain exports declined as prices and volume dropped, tax revenues fell, foreign credit sources dried up, and short-term loans were called in. The Hungarian national bank depleted its supply of precious metals and foreign currency during a period of a few weeks in 1931. Hungary sought financial relief from the [[League of Nations]], which insisted on a program of rigid fiscal belt-tightening, resulting in increased unemployment. The peasants reverted to subsistence farming. Industrial production rapidly dropped, and businesses went bankrupt as domestic and foreign demand evaporated. Government workers lost their jobs or suffered severe pay cuts. By 1933 about 18 percent of Budapest's citizens lived in poverty. Unemployment leapt from 5 percent in 1928 to almost 36 percent by 1933.

== Shift to the right==
As the standard of living dropped, the political mood of the country shifted further towards the [[Right-wing politics|right]]. Bethlen resigned without warning amid national turmoil in August 1931. His successor, [[Gyula Károlyi]], failed to quell the crisis. [[Miklós Horthy|Horthy]] then appointed a reactionary demagogue, [[Gyula Gömbös]], but only after Gömbös agreed to maintain the existing political system, to refrain from calling elections before the parliament's term had expired, and to appoint several Bethlen supporters to head key ministries. Gömbös publicly renounced the vehement [[antisemitism]] he had espoused earlier, and his party and government included some [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jews]].

Gömbös's appointment marked the beginning of the [[Far-right politics|radical right]]'s ascendancy in Hungarian politics, which lasted with few interruptions until 1945. The radical right garnered its support from medium and small farmers, former refugees from Hungary's lost territories, and unemployed civil servants, army officers, and university graduates. Gömbös advocated a one-party government, revision of the [[Treaty of Trianon]], withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]], [[anti-intellectualism]], and social reform. He assembled a political machine, but his efforts to fashion a one-party state and fulfill his reform platform were frustrated by a parliament composed mostly of Bethlen's supporters and by Hungary's creditors, who forced Gömbös to follow conventional policies in dealing with the economic and financial crisis. The [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1935|1935 elections]] gave Gömbös more solid support in the parliament, and he succeeded in gaining control of the ministries of finance, industry, and defense and in replacing several key military officers with his supporters. In September 1936, Gömbös informed German officials that he would establish a [[Nazi]]-like, one-party government in Hungary within two years, but he died in October without realizing this goal.

In foreign affairs, Gömbös led Hungary towards close relations with [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]; in fact, Gömbös coined the term [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]], which was later adopted by the German-Italian military alliance. Soon after his appointment, Gömbös visited Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] and gained his support for revision of the Treaty of Trianon. Later, Gömbös became the first foreign head of government to visit German chancellor [[Adolf Hitler]]. For a time, Hungary profited handsomely, as Gömbös signed a trade agreement with Germany that drew Hungary's economy out of depression but made Hungary dependent on the German economy for both raw materials and markets. In 1928, Germany had accounted for 19.5 percent of Hungary's imports and 11.7 percent of its exports; by 1939 the figures were 52.5 percent and 52.2 percent, respectively.&lt;ref name=US4&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/hungary/34.htm ''Radical Right in Power''. U.S. Library of Congress Country Study]&lt;/ref&gt; Hungary's annual rate of economic growth from 1934 to 1940 averaged 10.8 percent.&lt;ref name=US4/&gt; The number of workers in industry doubled in the ten years after 1933, and the number of agricultural workers dropped below 50 percent for the first time in the country's history.&lt;ref name=US4/&gt;

===On the eve of World War II ===
{{further information|First Vienna Award|Second Vienna Award|Slovak–Hungarian War}}
[[File:Hungary in 1941 with territories annexed in 1938-1941.png|thumb|Map of territories reassigned to Hungary in 1938–1941]]
The Kingdom of Hungary also used its relationship with Germany to chip away at the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. In 1938, Hungary openly repudiated the treaty's restrictions on its [[Military of Hungary|armed forces]]. With German help, Hungary extended its territory four times and doubled in size from 1938 to 1941, even fighting a [[Slovak–Hungarian War|short war with the newly created Slovakia]].   Hungary regained parts of southern [[Slovakia]] in 1938, [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] in 1939, northern [[Transylvania]] in 1940, and parts of [[Vojvodina]] in 1941.

[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s assistance did not come without a price. After 1938, the Führer used promises of additional territories, economic pressure, and threats of military intervention to pressure the Hungarians into supporting his policies, including those related to [[History of the Jews in Europe|Europe's Jews]], which encouraged Hungary's antisemites. The percentage of Jews in business, finance, and the professions far exceeded the percentage of Jews in the overall population. After the depression struck, antisemites made the Jews scapegoats for Hungary's economic plight.

Hungary's Jews suffered the first blows of this renewed anti-Semitism during the government of Gömbös's successor, [[Kálmán Darányi]], who fashioned a coalition of conservatives and reactionaries and dismantled Gömbös's political machine. After Horthy publicly dashed hopes of land reform, discontented right-wingers took to the streets denouncing the government and baiting the Jews. Darányi's government attempted to appease the anti-Semites and the Nazis by proposing and passing the first so-called Jewish Law, which set quotas limiting Jews to 20 percent of the positions in certain businesses and professions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} The law failed to satisfy Hungary's anti-Semitic radicals, however, and when Darányi tried to appease them again, Horthy unseated him in 1938. The regent then appointed the ill-starred [[Béla Imrédy]], who drafted a second, harsher Jewish Law before political opponents forced his resignation in February 1939 by presenting documents showing that Imrédy's own grandfather was a Jew.

[[File:Statue of Pál Teleki.jpg|thumb|250px|Statue of Pál Teleki]]
Imrédy's downfall led to [[Pál Teleki]]'s return to the prime minister's office. Teleki dissolved some of the fascist parties but did not alter the fundamental policies of his predecessors. He undertook a bureaucratic reform and launched cultural and educational programs to help the rural poor. But Teleki also oversaw passage of the second Jewish Law, which broadened the definition of "Jewishness," cut the quotas on Jews permitted in the professions and in business, and required that the quotas be attained by the hiring of Gentiles or the firing of Jews.

By the June [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1939|1939 elections]], Hungarian public opinion had shifted so far to the right that voters gave the [[Arrow Cross Party]] &amp;ndash;Hungary's equivalent of Germany's [[Nazi Party]]&amp;ndash;the second highest number of votes. In September 1940, the Hungarian government allowed [[Wehrmacht|German troops]] to transit the country on their way to [[Romania]], and on November 20, 1940, Teleki signed the [[Tripartite Pact]], which allied the country with Germany, Italy, and [[Shōwa period|Japan]], and ensured [[Hungary during the Second World War|Hungary's involvement in the Second World War]].

==Social structure==
Until [[World War I]], striking inequalities distinguished the distribution of wealth, power, privilege, and opportunity among social groups. The various social strata had different codes of behavior and distinctive dress, speech, and manners. Respect showed to persons varied according to the source of their wealth. Wealth derived from possession of land was valued more highly than that coming from [[trade]] or [[banking]]. The country was predominantly rural, and [[landownership]] was the central factor in determining the status and prestige of most families. In some of the [[middle class|middle]] and [[upper class|upper strata]] of society, [[nobility|noble birth]] was also an important criterion as was, in some cases, the holding of certain occupations. An intricate system of ranks and titles distinguished the various social stations. Hereditary titles designated the [[aristocracy]] and [[gentry]]. Persons who had achieved positions of eminence, whether or not they were of noble birth, often received nonhereditary titles from the state. The gradations of rank derived from titles had great significance in social intercourse and in the relations between the individual and the state. Among the rural population, which consisted largely of [[peasants]] and which made up the overwhelming majority of the country's people, distinctions derived from such factors as the size of a family's landholding; whether the family owned the land and hired help to work it, owned and worked the land itself, or worked for others; and family reputation. The prestige and respect accompanying landownership were evident in many facets of life in the countryside, from finely shaded modes of polite address, to special church seating, to selection of landed peasants to fill public offices.

Landowners, wealthy bankers, aristocrats and gentry, and various commercial leaders made up the elite. Together, these groups accounted for only 13 percent of the population.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Between 10 and 18 percent of the population consisted of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] and the petty gentry, various government officials, intellectuals, retail store owners, and well-to-do professionals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} More than two-thirds of the remaining population lived in varying degrees of poverty.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Their only real chance for [[upward mobility]] lay in becoming [[civil servants]], but such advancement was difficult because of the exclusive nature of the education system. The [[industrial working class]] was growing, but the largest group remained the peasantry, most of whom had too little land or none at all.

Although the inter-war years witnessed considerable cultural and economic progress in the country, the social structure changed little. A great chasm remained between the gentry, both social and intellectual, and the rural "people." Jews held a place of prominence in the country's economic, social, and political life. They constituted the bulk of the middle class. They were well assimilated, worked in a variety of professions, and were of various political persuasions.

'''Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi y Montiano''' (1921-2001) was a Spanish [[entrepreneur]], [[Carlist]] militant and [[author]]. Larramendi was as a longtime head of [[MAPFRE]] and is often counted among 100 most influential Spanish businessmen of the 20th century. He is recognized as sponsor and organizer of multifold initiatives related to Hispanic culture, mostly in [[Latin America]]. He briefly rose to Carlist executive, but is better known as engaged in promotion of [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] heritage.

Since 1940 he was dating Lourdes Martínez Gutiérrez (1924-2015), granddaughter to general [[Alfredo Gutiérrez Chaume]];&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 493&lt;/ref&gt; her father, "funcionario de Hacienda",&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; died early. The couple married in 1950&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, pp. 40-41&lt;/ref&gt; and had 9 children, born between 1951 and 1965.&lt;ref&gt;named Carmen, Luis, Coro, Ignacio, Lourdes, Carlos, Margarita, Miguel and Ramón, Pons Pons 2000, p. 493&lt;/ref&gt; The best known of them, Ramón Hernando de Larramendi, is widely recognized in Spain as a polar explorer.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. his own webpage [http://ramonlarramendi.com/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; Luis succeeded his father in business&lt;ref&gt;compare ''Hernando de Larramendi Martínez, Luis, 1952-'' entry, [in:] ''Fundacion Ignacio Larramendi'' service, available [http://www.larramendi.es/i18n/consulta_aut/registro.cmd?control=FILA20120026612 here], also the corporative MAPFRE service, available [https://www.mapfre.com/corporativo-es/acerca-mapfre/organos-gobierno/luis-Larramendi-larramendi-martinez.jsp here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in politics, rising to high positions within the Carlist structures&lt;ref&gt;Andía, Sierra-Sesúmaga 2011, p. 25, Jordi Canal, ''El carlismo'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|8420639478}}, p. 417&lt;/ref&gt; and animating a number of Traditionalist activities.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Aportes'', Canal 2000, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; Miguel is known as professor of Arabic studies in Madrid&lt;ref&gt;see his entry [http://www.larramendi.es/i18n/consulta_aut/registro.cmd?control=FILA20120033535 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and Margarita as a poet and scholar in linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Hernando de Larramendi Martínez, Margarita, 1960-'' entry, [in:] ''Fundacion Ignacio Larramendi'' service, available [http://www.larramendi.es/i18n/consulta_aut/registro.cmd?control=FILA20100011928 here].

==Early politics: from leaflet dropper to party executive==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|left|Carlist standard]]
Already as a 10-year-old Ignacio was engaged in politics, in [[Spanish general election, 1931|1931]] distributing Carlist electoral leaflets of his father;&lt;ref&gt;Andía, Sierra-Sesúmaga 2011, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; apart from the Requeté episode, during the Civil War he engaged in a Carlist student organization [[Agrupación Escolar Tradicionalista]], mocking himself as president of its Madrid branch on exile.&lt;ref&gt;Andía, Sierra-Sesúmaga 2011, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; Having returned to the capital he indeed engaged in local AET organization and emerged as one of its most active leaders. Together with a group of similarly-minded peers, best known of them [[Rafael Gambra Ciudad|Rafael Gambra]] and [[Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola|Francisco Elías de Tejada]],&lt;ref&gt;also Francisco Diez Tejada, Pueyo Alvarez, Fernando Polo, Zabala brothers, González Quevedo, Amancio Portabales, Luis Ortiz y Estrada, Luis Alonso and Rafael Lluys, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; he staged minor and semi-private anti-[[Francoist]] demonstrations,&lt;ref&gt;called "saltos", e.g. prowling parks and streets with anti-Francoist cries, dropping leaflets, painting graffiti, refusing to raise arms in Falangist salute during public events like football matches etc., some graffiti Larramendi 2000, p. 89-90, Andía, Sierra-Sesúmaga 2011andia, sesumaga 328&lt;/ref&gt; at one point in 1942 having been detained and placed under security supervision.&lt;ref&gt;in 1942 Ignacio and his brother were detained for 3 days and interrogated by in Dirección General de Seguridad; there was no major follow-up, apart that they had to show up at security every 15 days during the following year, Andía, Sierra-Sesúmaga 2011, p. 328. In case of his brother Alfonso Carlos the confrontation proved more dramatic, as following 1944 celebration of Martires de Tradición he was detained and sent to concentration camp, where he landed among war refugees from the war and former Intebrigadistas, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 246. At that time Ignacio was engaged in anti-German conspiracy prepared in anticipation of a would-be Nazi invasion of Spain, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Their most notable activity was Academia Vázquez de Mella, a Carlist-flavored private educational initiative of Maximo Palomar; the experience formatted Larramendi reinforcing his penchant for social issues and for cultural rather than political dimension of Traditionalism.
[[File:Don Javier 1960.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]] at the wedding of his daughter, 1960]]
Following demise of Academia in the mid-1940s there were no official or semi-official Carlist structure in Madrid; internal political and dynastical fragmentation contributed to crisis of the movement. During that period Larramendi, influenced by Elías de Tejada and own father,&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''El naufragio de las ortodoxias. El carlismo, 1962-1977'', Pamplona 1997; {{ISBN|9788431315641}}, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; tended to favor [[Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza|Dom Duarte]] and the [[Miguelist|Braganzas]] as most legitimate candidates to the throne,&lt;ref&gt;Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; though in the early 1950s he was already converted to supporter of the [[House of Bourbon-Parma|Borbón-Parmas]]. Following a brief and moderately successful episode of launching in 1951&lt;ref&gt;together with Rafael Gambra and Vicente Marrero&lt;/ref&gt; an own publishing house, Traditionalist-flavored Editorial Cálamo,&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1950s he became known in the movement as a young, vehemently anti-Francoist and dynastically loyal militant.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 395&lt;/ref&gt; He was counted among intransigent followers of the official Carlist leader [[Manuel Fal Conde]], so-called Falcondistas,&lt;ref&gt;Manuel de Santa Cruz (ed.), ''Apuntes y documentos para la historia del tradicionalismo español (1939-1979)'', vol. 4, Sevilla 1979, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; though did not rise to top layers of the movement. During the first royal presentation of the claimant [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]] in [[Barcelona]] in 1952 he was not listed among those attending,&lt;ref&gt;César Alcalá, ''D. Mauricio de Sivatte. Una biografía política (1901-1980)'', Barcelona 2001, {{ISBN|8493109797}}, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; though certainly position of his father, at that time among those co-engineering launch of Don Javier's campaign, helped him enter Carlist ruling circles of the era.&lt;ref&gt;compare Larramendi 2000, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems that soon Larramendi's anti-Francoism exceeded that of Fal; in the mid-1950s he was considered member of "duros" or "guipúzcoanos",&lt;ref&gt;some scholars claim that the controversy emerged on rather personal basis, as Fal's management style was considered authoritarian, Ramón María Rodon Guinjoan, ''Invierno, primavera y otoño del carlismo (1939-1976)'' [PhD thesis Universitat Abat Oliba CEU], Barcelona 2015, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; an internal faction grumbling at official party line as yielding versus Franco;&lt;ref&gt;Javier Lavardín [José Antonio Parilla], ''Historia del ultimo pretendiente a la corona de España'', Paris 1976, pp. 24, 15&lt;/ref&gt; others consider him member of the "intellectuals" faction, also opposed to the "integrist" group of Fal.&lt;ref&gt;in the mid-1950s Massó counted him, with Gambra and Elías, among "intelectuales y asimilables", bent on traditionalist orthodoxy, fighting anti-Spain and confronting Europeanist and modernizing trends; other factions he listed were integristas, ex-combatientes and legitimistas, Rodon 2015, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; As internal crisis climaxed, in the mid-1950s Fal was forced into resignation and Vasco-Navarros suggested that Larramendi be appointed to Secretariado Político, a freshly created body supposed to assist a new leader, [[José María Valiente Soriano|José María Valiente]].&lt;ref&gt;Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was to push hard with the royal claim of Don Javier,&lt;ref&gt;Rodon 2015, pp. 209-210&lt;/ref&gt; but it backfired; it turned out that the new party executive was dominated by supporters of replacing intransigence with a collaborationist offer to Franco. When the new Secretariat addressed [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista|Falange]] with proposal of a joint action, Larramendi resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Secretariado de la Comunión Tradicionalista wrote a document to addressed to Ministro Secretario General del Movimiento. It denounced common enemies on the Right, mostly the Christian-Democrats and liberal monarchists, and went on reading: "La Monarquía Tradicional debe suceder a Franco, de manos de Franco. Cualquoer otra formula intermedia, podría ser nociva para la instauración de la Monarquía Tradicional." The document went on advocating "acción conjunta de la Falange y el Requeté", Alcalá 2001, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; His career in the executive terminated after just few months.&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Vázquez de Prada, ''El final de una ilusión. Auge y declive del tradicionalismo carlista (1957-1967)'', Madrid 2016, {{ISBN|9788416558407}}, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late politics: in the back seat==
[[File:Bij een lezing van Dr. Konrad Adenauer waren onder zijn gehoor (links) prinses I, Bestanddeelnr 112-0346.jpg|thumb|300px|left|1966: Carlist and Alfonsist heir-to-the-throne pretenders and their wives]]
Larramendi remained active in the Carlist structures and took part in their public initiatives. During the 1957 annual Carlist [[Montejurra]] gathering he was among party pundits&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; when they introduced an heir to the throne, [[Carlos Hugo|Don Carlos Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;Lavardin 1976, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In fact he remained somewhat skeptical and anxious that the prince might be tempted to pursue a collaborationist line; the same year Larramendi was vital fomenting dissent in the Madrid AET organization,&lt;ref&gt;in the mid-1950s Larramendi was on excellent terms with the aetistas, Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; which deposed its leader and key Don Carlos Hugo promoter, [[Ramón Massó Tarruella|Ramón Massó]], as the one who compromised Traditionalist identity and advocated rapprochement with the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Rodon 2015, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s Larramendi was engaged in works of Carlist structures in Madrid; it implied collaboration with personal entourage of the prince, who set his headquarters in the capital. Differences of opinion continued and gave rise to two factions, pro-collaborationists and anti-collaborationists;&lt;ref&gt;Rodon 2015, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Massó, leader of the former and himself former Larramendi's acquaintance from the Academia years,&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, pp. 98-9&lt;/ref&gt; considered him representative of "mas pura ortodoxia tradicionalista".&lt;ref&gt;Rodon 2015, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s Larramendi kept frequenting Montejurra every year, though with his sons rather than among the official executive.&lt;ref&gt;''Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi y Montiano 1921-2001'', [in:] ''filosofiaorg'' service, available [http://www.filosofia.org/ave/001/a151.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1960s his engagement in party life was already very loose, especially after in 1963 his friends, Gambra and Elías, broke with [[Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión]] as it was assuming an increasingly unorthodox stance.&lt;ref&gt;he is noted as frequenting AET premises in the 1960s, at that time "a meeting ground" of different breeds of Carlists; Larramendi was noted as keen on discussing religious topics related to Vaticanum II, Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''Carlos Hugo frente a Juan Carlos. La solución federal para España que Franco rechazó'', Madrid 2014, {{ISBN|9788477682653}}, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; When the conflict climaxed in the late 1960s Larramendi was a witness rather than a participant. As Hugocarlistas traded their pro-Falangist penchant for belligerent anti-Francoism his earlier concerns faded away, replaced with anxiety about radically Marxist turn of the prince. What did not change was his loyalty to the dynasty; shortly before Don Javier's expulsion in 1969 Larramendi hosted his king in the own Madrid Villa Covadonga residence.&lt;ref&gt;''Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi y Montiano 1921-2001'', [in:] ''filosofiaorg'' service, available [http://www.filosofia.org/ave/001/a151.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Princes Irene and Carlos Hugo 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|Don Carlos Hugo]] and his wife [[Princess Irene of the Netherlands|Princess Irene]], 1978]]
In 1970, when the Hugocarlista domination was not yet complete,  the Madrid party branch nominated Larramendi to take part in [[Arbonne]] gathering, styled as a would-be platform for compromise between the Progressists and the Traditionalists.&lt;ref&gt;''Ignacio H. de Larramendi y Montiano'', Madrid 1991, {{ISBN|8471001888}}, pp. 39-41&lt;/ref&gt; Considered representative of the Traditionalists but not involved in internal party struggle he seemed an in-between delegate and indeed adopted a conciliatory stand. In what sounded like a distant echo of pro-social writings of his father, Larramendi declared that if the party was to embrace socialist ideas its members should act instead of talking, and that he would start with himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Ignacio H. de Larramendi y Montiano'' 1991, pp. 39-41&lt;/ref&gt; The point was about his position of a corporate business leader, but most of those present took it for support of Don Carlos Hugo.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 469&lt;/ref&gt; They were soon proved wrong; Larramendi stayed out of the newly emergent Partido Carlista and in 1975 addressed his king, Don Javier, with a joint letter, in ultimative terms demanding confirmation of Traditionalist principles.&lt;ref&gt;for full text of 3 letters and their signatories see ''hispanismo'' service, available [http://hispanismo.org/politica-y-sociedad/19277-el-revolucionario-rey-don-javier-traiciono-al-legitimismo-2.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; As the claimant abdicated in favor of his son the Traditionalists addressed Don Carlos Hugo with another letter; Larramendi was among the signatories neither of this nor of the following document, marking ultimate break with the new claimant. In the mid-1970 he loosely neared [[Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma|Sixtinos]],&lt;ref&gt;Lavardin 1976, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; but refrained from political activity after the death of Franco.

==MAPFRE: from nearly bankrupt to market leader==
[[File:Serie over Spanje, Bestanddeelnr 911-6501.jpg|thumb|left|urban traffic, Spain 1960]]
Following months spent in London&lt;ref&gt;With a number of strings in London learning the British insurance market, Pons Pons 2000, p. 493&lt;/ref&gt; Larramendi worked in Dirección de Seguros until 1952, when he joined Royal Insurance Company to head its Madrid office;&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 98-99&lt;/ref&gt; following disagreement with its managers and a few-month spell back at Dirección in 1955,&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; the same year he joined MAPFRE, a mid-size private insurance [[Mutual insurance|mutual]].&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 494. The company was created 1933 by landholders challenged by new republican regulations; until 1943 it broadened its activities to transport, life and civil reponsability. As in 1944 obligatory health insurance was established, MAPFRE closed a deal with Ministerio de Trabajo and served Caja Nacional de Seguro de Enfermedad for 10 years, nearly going bust&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the company was at the verge of bankruptcy; as director general Larramendi was tasked with introducing a sanitation program.&lt;ref&gt;in 1955 the company was 26m ptas in debt, mostly to pharmaceutical companies , Pons Pons 2000, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; He re-negotiated a long-term debt repayment period with Consejo General de Colegios de Farmacéuticos de España, closed some branches and streamlined ongoing operations,&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in Mutualidad getting out of red and returning to profit in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, pp. 494-5&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the decades Larramendi was already in position to design new growth schemes.

Following introduction of obligatory health insurance Larramendi set up MAPFRE Mutua Patronal de Accidentes de Trabajo.&lt;ref&gt;Adopting Ley de Bases de la Seguriad Social of 1963 and its final application in 1966 triggered restructuring of the company. Later MAPFRE Mutua Patronal de Accidentes de Trabajo, which later developed into FREMAP, Pons Pons 2000, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s he pushed for developing a financial arm, intended to merge insurance with credit as a combined offer to car buyers; the plan was accomplished in 1962 by taking over Central de Obras y Crédito&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt; and proved successful at the rapidly growing Spanish car market.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo Caruana de las Cagigas, ''The Insurance Demutualization Process Develops in Spain with Mapfre'', [in:] Robin Pearson, Takau Yoneyama, ''Corporate Forms and Organisational Choice in International Insurance'', Oxford 2015, {{ISBN|9780191059476}}, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Another rewarding strategic move was creating Muinsa, an [[Investment trust|investment trust company]] intended to find ways around restrictive regulations limiting investment activity of insurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;the supervision was exercised by Dirección General de Seguros, and due to his earlier employment record with the institution Larramendi was perfectly aware of the way it worked&lt;/ref&gt; Other specialized ITC companies, Muinsa Dos, Progesa and Mapinco, soon followed, and in the late 1960s the mutual started to re-format some of its structures into [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock organizations]].&lt;ref&gt;Caruana 2015, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 Larramendi drafted first major corporate shakeup, which materialized in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual, targeting mostly the transport market, controlled Gama or MAPFRE Group, which in turn oversaw MAPFRE Industrial and MAPFRE Vida, specializing in business and consumer sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, pp. 495-6&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme worked allowing sharing common back-office services while retaining autonomy and accountability of diversified and dedicated structures; with car sales booming, in the early 1970s the group became market leader on the car insurance market.&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt; Larramendi's position as [[CEO]] was so strong that when in conflict with [[chairman of the board]], it was rather the latter who resigned in 1972;&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, pp. 495-6&lt;/ref&gt; his own formal role changed in 1975 from director general to consejero delegado, remaining key and dominating corporate personality.&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Logo de Mapfre.jpg|thumb|MAPFRE logotype]]
The mid-1970s were a crisis period in world economy, affecting Spain and MAPFRE as well. Larramendi responded with another reorganization in 1978, based on creation of Corporación MAPFRE as a [[Holding company|holding structure]] and reducing stakes in controlled companies, fully moved to the joint-stock formula.&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme proved transitional and in 1983 was followed by launch of Sistema MAPFRE 85, Mutual at its centre and by means of Corporación controlling all daughter companies, now specializing in 3 areas: transport, various risks and life &amp; [[re-insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 495, ''Mecenazgo cultural de Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi y Montiano. Crónica y testimonios'', Madrid 2002, {{ISBN|8484790363}}, pp. 244-245&lt;/ref&gt; Once the crisis period faded away the group retained dynamics; in 1983 MAPFRE became market leader on the Spanish insurance market.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo Caruana de las Cagigas, José Luis García Ruiz, ''La internacionalización del seguro español: el caso de MAPFRE, 1969-2001'', [in:] ''Información Comercial Española'' 849 (2009), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==MAPFRE: domestic and international expansion==
[[File:Buenos Aires - Puerto Madero 142.jpg|thumb|left|[[Buenos Aires]] business centre]]
Already in 1969 Larramendi ensured the decision to commence expansion beyond Spain;&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; though various directions were considered, from the onset he had his sights set on Latin America. In the early 1970s the company, by means of Editorial MAPFRE, embarked on public relations campaign,&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, pp. 496-7&lt;/ref&gt; while Larramendi used to tour the continent himself; he made sure that [[Argentina]] was the most promising market&lt;ref&gt;he considered Buenos Aires the economic capital of the Southern hemisphere&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Colombia]] was the "mas españolista" country.&lt;ref&gt;Caruana, García Ruiz 2009, p. 144; he considered Peru, Chile and Ecuador too poor to be promising market for insurance business, while Venezuela was deemed as too "yanquisado"&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s the company was looking for the most appropriate expansion formula; on the one hand, in 1976 it set up MAPFRE Internacional and directly entered many South American markets,&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; on the other, it formed re-insurance conglomerates with Belgian and Dutch companies.&lt;ref&gt;Belgian Assubel (now Allianz) and Dutch Ago (now Aegon), joining forces in Compagnie Internationale d'Assurance et de Réassurance (CIAR), Caruana, García Ruiz 2009, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; None of that really worked; the most successful strategy was taking over local entities and using re-insurance as a ram to enter local markets; following acquisitions of Seguros Caribe (Colombia), Aconcagua (Argentina) and other companies,&lt;ref&gt;most notable of them Cía de Seguros Generales Euroamérica and Caja Reaseguradora, both from Chile&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1980s MAPFRE became a major player on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Caruana, García Ruiz 2009, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Also swift response to the [[1985 Mexico earthquake]] earned the group prestige and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Caruana, García Ruiz 2009, pp. 147-8&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 the company became re-insurance market leader in Latin America and the first among foreign companies in general.&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt; On the Latin American market MAPFRE engaged in 10 companies before 1990 and 22 after that date.&lt;ref&gt;Caruana, García Ruiz 2009, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

During Larramendi's tenure MAPFRE failed to develop more than testimonial business in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;mostly in Luxembourg with Maplux Re, Caruana, García Ruiz 2009, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Following market simulations it was agreed that though a key player in Spain, the company was not in position to engage in full scale competition with larger German, Dutch or French conglomerates in the [[EEC]], especially that earlier investment in Progress, a [[Sicily]]-focused company intended as starter for the [[Italy|Italian]] expansion, turned out to be a failure.&lt;ref&gt;Caruana, García Ruiz 2009, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; At some stage MAPFRE considered entering [[Japan]], but the Far-East plans were finally scaled down to businesses in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].&lt;ref&gt;Caruana, García Ruiz 2009, p. 147-8&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CSAlcorcon.JPG|thumb|MAPFRE [[Shared services center|SSC]], [[Alcorcon]]]]
In 1985 Larramendi re-formatted his role from chief executive to presidente de la comisión de control institucional,&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; but it was himself who remained behind the steering wheel. In the late 1980s he co-designed another scheme, named Plan Sistema MAPFRE 92. Two key entities, Mutual MAPFRE and Corporación MAPFRE, remained at its core. The entire business was re-drawn in line with the logic gaining popularity among corporative moguls of the era and designed after the [[Zaibatsu|Japanese zaibatsu model]]; its key feature was turning multi-business conglomerates into loose federative schemes with huge autonomy of its components.&lt;ref&gt;Caruana, García Ruiz 2009, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the company re-emphasized its banking arm by creating Banco MAPFRE, the nucleus of Crédito del Sistema MAPFRE.&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, having reached the age of 70, Larramendi resigned from all corporate roles except in the international business, where he stepped down in 1995; he complied with the rules he created and introduced himself.&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, pp. 496-7&lt;/ref&gt; He was leaving the company operating 1,648 branch offices, employing directly 4,500 people and indirectly further 12,000, with 500m ptas consolidated assets and annual proceeds of 200m ptas.&lt;ref&gt;Mecenazgo cultural 2002, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==MAPFRE: corporate success factors==
[[File:291 Casa Estapé, pg. Sant Joan 6.jpg|thumb|left|MAPFRE agency, [[Barcelona]]]]
Larramendi is counted among the 100 most influential Spanish managers of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jerónia Pons Pons, ''Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi'', [in:] Eugenio Torres (ed.), ''Los 100 empresarios españoles del siglo XX'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|848871727X}}, pp. 493–497&lt;/ref&gt; When inquired about his success as a manager, Larramendi usually pointed to [[Human resource management|HR]]-related factors, principally the internal [[code of conduct]] he introduced, at that time unheard of in corporative business and responsible for emergence of a new breed of employees, called mafristas. The code was supposed to reflect moral values he adhered to, first of all mutual respect, transparency and integrity.&lt;ref&gt;''El Mundo'' 08.09.11&lt;/ref&gt; He also emphasized the importance of [[delegating]], de-centralised management and responsiveness to what he called an anarchist realm of individual initiatives and ideas,&lt;ref&gt;''La Razón'' 04.07.01&lt;/ref&gt; the model now firmly incorporated in [[change management]] manuals as "emergent change" and opposed to "planned change".

Indeed, business historians agree that Larramendi's approach to human factor was key; importing mechanisms he learnt in Britain and the US, he introduced modern HR management with career paths, training plans, supervision, mentoring and other techniques, apart from preference for recruiting university graduates.&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; That was part of his general mindset, default in case of present-day managers though absent at that time, focused at holistic realm of stakeholders – employees, owners, customers, suppliers, everyone affected – instead of merely shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Mecenazgo cultural 2002, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; It is also confirmed that decentralized management with regional direcciones generales instead of delegados provinciales&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt;  and full managerial accountability with little cross-subsidizing contributed to internal efficiency of operations.&lt;ref&gt;Caruana, García Ruiz 2009, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited for developing a business model dubbed "specialized diversification",&lt;ref&gt;see ''Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi'' entry, [in:] ''Insurance Hall of Fame'' service, available [http://www.insurancehalloffame.org/laureateprofile.php?laureate=131 here]&lt;/ref&gt; allowing customer focus, reduced back-office and increased [[economics of scale]] by taking advantage of numerous [[shared services]].&lt;ref&gt;Caruana, García Ruiz 2009, p. 294; see also Larramendi's holistic vision [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CUFs4jdZP8 here]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Barcelona - Torre Mapfre 03.jpg|thumb|160px|''[[Torre Mapfre]]'', Barcelona]]
Larramendi is also deemed responsible for introducing to Spain a number of features specific for insurance and financial markets, be it new products like travel assistance plans for motorists or home assistance programs for home owners,&lt;ref&gt;''Insurance Hall of Fame'' service, available [http://www.insurancehalloffame.org/laureateprofile.php?laureate=131 here]&lt;/ref&gt; new corporative techniques like [[risk management]],&lt;ref&gt;''El Mundo'' 08.09.11&lt;/ref&gt; broadening scope of activities to entirely new areas&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; and a new strategic customer interface concept of "one-stop financial shopping".&lt;ref&gt;''Insurance Hall of Fame service'', available [http://www.insurancehalloffame.org/laureateprofile.php?laureate=131 here]&lt;/ref&gt; His focus on accessible and accurate information, bordering obsession, led to leadership in terms of technology; MAPFRE was the second company in Spain&lt;ref&gt;the first one was SEAT&lt;/ref&gt; to introduce [[telex]]&lt;ref&gt;''Mecenazgo cultural'' 2002, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; and among the first ones to embrace broad-scale digital data storage techniques.&lt;ref&gt;however, himself he refused to drive and has never had a driving licence, ''Ignacio H. de Larramendi y Montiano'' 1991, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

MAPFRE success in Latin America is deemed perfect illustration of [[John Harry Dunning|John Duning's]] "[[eclectic paradigm]]" theory, with ownership advantages, location advantages and internalization advantages all combined and exploited to the utmost.&lt;ref&gt;Caruana, García Ruiz 2009, p. 153; for details, see John Dunning, ''Explaining International Production'', New York - London 1988, {{ISBN|9780044451709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concept referred to is [[Richard E. Caves|Richard Caves]]' "intangible assets theory"; in case of Larramendi it would be selection of risks (with focus on re-insurance, direct insurance and assistance), HR management and especially banking on cultural proximity, which allowed MAPFRE to outpace other, especially US-based competitors.&lt;ref&gt;Caruana, García Ruiz 2009, p. 153; for details, see Richard E. Caves, ''Industrial Corporations: The Industrial Economics of Foreign nvestment'', [in:] ''Economica'' 38 (1971), pp. 1-27&lt;/ref&gt; He was acknowledged with a number of national and international corporate honors, e.g. Golden Medal of International Insurance Seminar Founder´s Award (1986) and Medalla de Oro del Seguro Español (1987).&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural patronage==
[[File:Fundació Mapfre inauguració Casa Garriga Nogués 2015.jpg|thumb|left|Fundación MAPFRE premises]]
In line with his concept of [[Social responsibility|corporative social responsibility]]&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi has always been concerned with social background, writing: "La empresa no está obligada sólo a la prestación eficiente de su propio servicio, sino sujeta a obligaciones institucionales derivadas de su influencia en la vida social y de su participación en el patrimonio nacional", quoted after Pons Pons 2000, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; already in the 1970s Larramendi engaged in non-profit initiatives; in 1975 he set up Fundación MAPFRE, intended to propagate safety at work and support accident recovery schemes; it was followed by Fundación Cultural MAPFRE Vida (1988), Fundación MAPFRE América (1988), Fundación MAPFRE Estudios (1989), Fundación MAPFRE Medicina (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; and Fundación MAPFRE Guanarteme.&lt;ref&gt;the foundation was dedicated to social development of the Canary Islands, where headquarters of the MAPFRE South American branch was located; the place was deemed perfect location in-between Spain and the New World&lt;/ref&gt; It was when he retired that Larramendi threw himself into their activities, dedicating most effort to Fundación América. Its key initiative was launching ''Colecciones Mapfre 1492'', a set of 19 series, each with multitude of publications and each dedicated to specific subject, e.g. indigenous languages or urban centers;&lt;ref&gt;''Mecenazgo cultural'' 2002, pp. 247-252&lt;/ref&gt; each volume published was presented to a number of institutions in Latin American countries and elsewhere. Another initiative was re-edition of historical documents&lt;ref&gt;''Mecenazgo cultural'' 2002, pp. 261-262&lt;/ref&gt; and co-sponsoring international americanist conferences, colloquies and programs, often in collaboration with [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mecenazgo cultural'' 2002, pp. 263-265&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s Larramendi co-founded&lt;ref&gt;''Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi y Montiano 1921-2001'', [in:] ''filosofiaorg'' service, available [http://www.filosofia.org/ave/001/a151.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; and was the moving spirit behind Fundación Histórica Tavera, operating an institute of the same name and dedicated to protection of bibliographic and documentary patrimony of Spain, [[Portugal]] and [[Iberoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation embarked mostly on a number of digitalization projects, programs supporting bibliographical and referential initiatives, cataloging and co-operation in archival efforts targeting various civil and ecclesiastic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;''Mecenazgo cultural'' 2002, pp. 266-268&lt;/ref&gt; Instituto published also a few digital series under common title ''Clasicós Tavera'', each one covering a single historical topic like Iberoamerica, regional histories, bibliographies etc.,&lt;ref&gt;''Mecenazgo cultural'' 2002, pp. 269-272&lt;/ref&gt; activity transferred further on to Centro de Referencias REFMAP and Centro de Publicaciones Digitales, later renamed to Digibis.&lt;ref&gt;''Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi y Montiano 1921-2001'', [in:] ''filosofiaorg'' service, available [http://www.filosofia.org/ave/001/a151.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ULL.BLIGHTY.26.PLUS.6.IS.1.jpg|thumb|Fundación Ignacio Larramendi logotype]]
Another thread of Larramendi's patronage activity was related to Carlism. He contributed financially to a number of Carlism-flavored publishing initiatives, especially ''Aportes''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mecenazgo cultural'' 2002, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; In honor of his father in 1986 he set up Fundación Hernando de Larramendi, currently operating as Fundación Ignacio Larramendi;&lt;ref&gt;see ''La Fundación'' entry, [in:] ''Fundacion Ignacio Larramendi'' service, available [http://www.larramendi.es/cms/elemento.cmd?id=estaticos/paginas/fundacion.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; its declared mission is to promote "caridad en las relaciones sociales" in line with the Catholic teaching, to act as independent think-tank, to study history of Carlism and to support non-commercial scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;"1. Fomento de la caridad en las relaciones sociales como expresión concreta del amor y preferencia por los débiles y pobres, base de la doctrina de la Iglesia Católica, y protección a personas o grupos con inferioridad económica o de otra clase. 2. Análisis de la función de las instituciones independientes como medio de optimización de recursos y dinamización de la sociedad. 3. Estudio de la influencia histórica de la acción del carlismo en la sociedad española. 4. Promoción de estudios o actuaciones de carácter científico de interés general no lucrativo", quoted after ''Objetivos'' entry, [in:] ''Fundacion Ignacio Larramendi'' service, available [http://www.larramendi.es/cms/elemento.cmd?id=estaticos/paginas/objetivos_fundacionales.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Most visible initiatives of the Foundation are related to dissemination of Carlist thought and promotion of Carlist studies. It keeps releasing digitalized collections of Traditionalist theorists, publishes mostly scholarly though at times also literary works within a ''Colección Luis Hernando de Larramendi'' series and awards Premio Internacional de Historia del Carlismo Luis Hernando de Larramendi,&lt;ref&gt;for regularions and rules see [http://www.larramendi.es/cms/fichero.cmd?id=estaticos/ficheros/2016-prem-carlismo-eng-ampliado.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; with the objective to "apoyar a los libros que aportan conocimientos objetivos para la verdad, no la verdad falsificada, no la verdad sectaria, sino la verdad a secas".&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation also keeps running a website with a number of digitalized works and press cuttings available.

The Spanish state acknowledged Larramendi's efforts of cultural patronage by awarding him a number of honors, most notably [[Order of Isabella the Catholic|Encomienda de Isabel la Católica]] (1996) and [[Order of Civil Merit|Gran Cruz de la Orden del Mérito Civil]] (1998).&lt;ref&gt;''Mecenazgo cultural'' 2002, pp. 26, 283&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
[[File:ToledoElecciones15Jun77.jpg|thumb|left|elections, Spain 1977]]
Larramendi fathered 8 books and published some 50 articles, mostly in specialized reviews.&lt;ref&gt;for full list see ''Bibliografia. Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi (1921-2001)'', Madrid 2005, available [https://www.fundacionmapfre.org/documentacion/publico/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1032946 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Majority are related to business, topped by ''Manual básico de seguros'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi, ''Manual básico de seguros'', Madrid 1981, {{ISBN|9788471001016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most readers, however, would find his works on society and politics more interesting.

''Tres claves de la vida inglesa'' (1951) was result of Larramendi's spell in London. Formally discussing legal, commercial and insurance systems, the book was praise of the British social and state model; it was hailed as merger of efficient economic order and organization on the one hand, and traditional values and structures on the other. The British system was judged as balanced, especially compared to the French model, stemming from bureaucratic illusions as to state and its powers to build a new order.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 398-9. According to Larramendi, UK was "es el único país cuyo sistema político-social enlaza con el que dio lugar a lo que se denomina civilización medieval. [...] Mientras gran parte del Continente, minado por la Revolución Francesa, los consideraba como reaccionarios, retrógrados e inadaptables, [these values] permitían a Inglaterra perfeccionar sus técnicas y métodos comerciales e industriales y colocarse en cabeza de la moderna civilización económica. [...] El error fundamental en que han incurrido los que han querido inspirarse en el sistema corporativo del régimen económico medieval -explica en otro lugar sobre las instituciones orgánicas- es que han creído que el poder público, en un momento determinado, podía crear unas instituciones equivalentes a las que tanto había costado formar naturalmente, y en lugar de organismos con alma y vida propias, surgieron máquinas burocráticas en las que nadie tenía fe", see pp. XV, XVI, XIX and 89&lt;/ref&gt; Fascination with British sense of continuity and intermediary institutions acting in-between state and society remained with Larramendi until the end of his life;&lt;ref&gt;"Los trabajos, discursos y artículos de Vázquez de Mella, que desarrolla la idea básica de la necesidad de las sociedades intermedias entre el poder político y el ciudadano, defienden a éste (al ciudadano) de los excesos de aquél (el poder político). Ése es el nudo de la política tradicionalista de siempre, y lo seguirá siendo en todas las naciones también en el siglo XXI, donde apoyándose en las instituciones y circunstancias de cada país, deberá el hombre defenderse del cada vez más omnímodo y absoluto poder del Estado. Desgraciadamente no en todas partes será posible un continuismo institucional como el que ha caracterizado la historia, en ese sentido ejemplar, de Gran Bretaña" – Larramendi 2000, pp. 58-9&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tres claves'' stands out as an anomaly in usually anti-British Carlist thought, lambasting [[Albion]] as a hotbed of Liberalism, plutocracy, freemasonry and greed.&lt;ref&gt;compare writings of Carlist theorists like [[Enrique Gil Robles]] or [[Salvador Minguijón Adrián|Salvador Minguijón]] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TCN56ZUSD0 others]. Even those consumed with anti-German zeal during the First World War preferred to emphasize Gallophile or even Russophile threads instead of pointing to Britain, inevitably bringing on the forefront the long history of Spanish-English competition overseas and the question of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwNfefO0ims Gibraltar]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 Larramendi published ''Anotaciones de sociopolítica independiente'', intended as discussion of post-Francoist Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Pons Pons 2000, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt; The work was a non-belligerent advance of [[Social Catholicism|social-Catholic]] vision. In practical terms it vaguely proposed a hybrid regime with some regulatory mechanisms working as checks-and-balances versus politics decided by universal suffrage,&lt;ref&gt;when discussing democracy models he distinguished between direct (in small countries), liberal (inorganic), popular (proletarian dictatorships), organic (state regulated French model and 2-party-regulated British and American models included) and sindical, Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi, ''Anotaciones de sociopolítica independiente'', Madrid 1977, p 52&lt;/ref&gt; thought most Francoist institutions were deemed useless. Francoism in general was acknowledged with mixed feelings as a system which ensured peace and socio-economic transformation, but was plagued by corruption and vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 1977, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Greatly in favor of Spanish integration within the West European structures, it also proposed "la gran Europa de raza blanca y herencia cristiana" as political entity for the 21s century.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 1977, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; A thread repeatedly coming back was anxiety about a would-be [[Partido Comunista de Espana|Communist]] penetration of Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 1977, pp. 62, 115-117, 155-158, 217-218&lt;/ref&gt; though the book acknowledged [[Socialism]] in its "non-maximalist" incarnations as an option to be discussed.&lt;ref&gt;he distinguished between Christian socialism, socialdemocracy, socialismo autogestionario and socialismo maximalista (or Communism), Larramendi 1977, pp. 217-218&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Juan Pablo II 1982 Iberia.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Pope John Paul II]] when visiting Spain, 1980s]]
In 1992 Larramendi published ''Utopía de la Nueva América'', result of his American fascinations; the key thesis advanced was that Iberoamérica and Angloamérica would merge to create a new cultural entity.&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi, ''Utopía de la Nueva América'', Madrid 1992, {{ISBN|8471004631}}, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s he commenced his written opus magnum, a series of 5 volumes intended as a response to perceived threats of global imbalance, disintegration of Europe and fragmentation of Spain; it was supposed to advance a proposal of "reforma operativa del estado español" though also to address general problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi, ''Panorama para una reforma del estado'', Madrid 1996, {{ISBN|848786340X}}, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The series was finally down to 3 books, almost 750 pages in total: ''Crisis de sociedad: reflexiones para el siglo XXI'' (1995),&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi, ''Crisis de sociedad: reflexiones para el siglo XXI'', Madrid 1995, {{ISBN|8487863329}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Panorama para una reforma del estado'' (1996)&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi, ''Panorama para una reforma del estado'', Madrid 1996, {{ISBN|848786340X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Bienestar solidario'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi, ''Bienestar solidario'', Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|8487863647}}&lt;/ref&gt; All were holistic and on the other hand fairly detailed attempts to re-define key public institutions in line with the vision of Christian solidarity;&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 1998, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; ''Crisis'' tended to be more historical and theoretical, ''Panorama'' discussed key state operation areas, while ''Bienestar'' focused on key public structures, mostly related to education, labor and insurance.

The final and possibly most popular book&lt;ref&gt;in 1996 Larramendi was nominated to Premio Príncipe de Asturias de Ciencias Sociales as "historiador", see ''ABC'' 16.05.96, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1996/05/16/067.html here], but 3 volumes intended to offer a systematic proposal for state reform and to generate major public debate went largely unnoticed. If discussed in the press, it was rather for circumstancial reasons bordering mockery, compare ''ABC'' 05.03.04, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/2004/03/05/002.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; was ''Así se hizo MAPFRE'' (2000), discussing history of the company against fairly wide background of personal life and general business and social environment.&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi, ''Así se hizo MAPFRE.

[[File:Jan-de-Vos-(2007).jpg|thumb|right|Jan de Vos during an interview on [[Prodesis]] in 2007]]
'''Jan de Vos van Gerven''' (1936 – 24 July 2011) was a Belgian [[historian]], who lived in Mexico from 1973 until his death in 2011. In 1995 he became guest-advisor to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN) during the peace talks between the EZLN and the [[Mexican Government]].

==Career==
Jan de Vos was born in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], in 1936. He grew up bilingual in Dutch and French. He achieved his PhD. in the [[humanities]] at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Leuven]], Belgium.

In 1973 he came to [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]], as a missionary priest. Over time, and in relationships with the indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]] of the [[Lacandon region]], he adopted an outlook influenced by [[liberation theology]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I came to Chiapas to bring the Mayan people the Word of God, but they converted me instead" [https://books.google.com/books?id=kB8CEdwLqVEC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=%22Jan+de+Vos%22+chiapas&amp;lr=#PPA88,M1]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During his life in Chiapas he did research and wrote many books on the history of the [[Lacandon region]] and processes that led to the [[Chiapas conflict]].

In 1986, he received an academic prize (the ''Premio Chiapas'') and in 1992 he received the national ''Juchimán de Plata'' prize.

Having made a reputation by writing on the [[Lacandon Jungle]], he was invited as a permanent guest advisor by the EZLN during the negotiations between the government and the EZLN in [[San Andrés Larráinzar]] in 1995. (see also the [[San Andrés Accords]])

As a distinguished person in the region he entered the Consejo Consultivo (Consultative Council) of the [[European Union|EU]]/[[Chiapas]] development project [[Prodesis]] around 2004.[http://www.prodesis.chiapas.gob.mx/?Consejo_Consultivo]

In her answer to a question in the European Parliament, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner referred to Jan de Vos to underline the transparent and democratic character of the project:&lt;blockquote&gt;
"From an institutional point of view, major emphasis has been put on inclusive participation and control by civil society within PRODESIS’ Consultative Council, whose “civil society college” currently includes 30 members of regional and national civil society organisations. The renowned Chiapas expert and EZLN’s external consultant during the negotiation of the San Andres Agreement, Professor Jan de Vos, is also a member of that Consultative Council."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During an interview in 2007, however, de Vos was very critical of Prodesis's way of operating, and sceptical about the possible results. In his opinion, the people in the [[Lacandon region]] have been betrayed too often (which is a strong sentiment in the region) and Prodesis is making the same mistakes as predecessor-projects like [[Chiapas conflict#Social development policies|PIDDS]] and the [[Chiapas conflict#Social development policies|Cañadas programme]].

In the last years of his life, de Vos worked at CIESAS ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080818081129/http://www.ciesas.edu.mx/index.html Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropología Social]) and resided mainly in [[Mexico City]], but he often returned to [[San Cristobal de las Casas]].

==Selected works==
Among several indispensable works on the history of Chiapas, he wrote ''Fray Pedro Lorenzo de la Nada'' and ''The Battle of The Sumidero''.

He became most known however for his trilogy on the [[Lacandon Jungle]]:

* ''La Paz de Dios y del Rey: la Conquista de la Selva Lacandona, 1525-1821'' (The Peace of God and the King: the Conquest of the Lacandon Jungle)
* ''Oro verde: la Conquista de la Selva Lacandona por los Madereros Tabasqueños, 1822-1949'' (Green Gold: the Conquest of the Lacandon Jungle by the Tabasco's Timber Dealers)
* ''Una Tierra Para Sembrar Sueños: Historia Reciente de la Selva Lacandona, 1950-2000'' (A Land for Sowing Dreams: Recent History of the Lacandon Jungle)

An excerpt from the introduction to ''The Peace of God and the King; The Conquest of the Lacandon Jungle, 1525-1821'':&lt;blockquote&gt;
"For Western Civilization, violent and oppressive by nature, the Indigenous cultures keep on being a nuisance which has to be eliminated. Today, several South American countries keep on exterminating in cold blood the last free indigenous tribes of the Amazon Rain Forest. Other nations limit themselves to destroying the autochthonous cultures and force the Indigenous people to enter the national society, only to turn them in uprooted second hand citizens. In other countries they are enclosed, for dubious phylantropic reasons, in reservations (sometimes territorial, sometimes subtly cultural), in which the Indigenous people are condemned to live like museum pieces, without being able to participate freely in the life of the nation they belong to. And there is not a single country in the American Continent where Indians are not economically exploited and socially oppressed by their White and Mestizo brothers."
''(La Paz de Dios y del Rey; La conquista de la Selva Lacandona. 1525-1821; Mexico, Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1993)''

In the [[Hawaiian religion]], the '''Kumulipo''' is an 18th-century [[chant]] in the [[Hawaiian language]] telling a [[Creation myth|creation story]].&lt;ref name="pukui"&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Kumulipo |accessdate= November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes a [[genealogy]] of the members of Hawaiian royalty and was created in honor of [[Kalaninuiamamao]] and passed down orally to his daughter [[Alapaiwahine]].

==Creation chant==

In the ''Kumulipo'' the world was created over a cosmic night. This is not just one night, but many nights over time. The ancient Hawaiian ''[[kahuna]]s'' and priests of the [[Hawaiian religion]] would recite the ''Kumulipo'' during the ''[[makahiki]]'' season, honoring the god [[Lono]]. In 1779, Captain [[James Cook]] arrived in [[Kealakekua Bay]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]] during the season and was greeted by the Hawaiians reciting the ''Kumulipo''. Some stories say Cook was mistaken for Lono, because of the type of sails on his ship and his pale skintone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Kumulipo- Song of Creation |author= John Fischer |publisher= The new York Times Company |work= About.com web site |url= http://gohawaii.about.com/cs/culture/a/kumulipo.htm |accessdate= November 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1889, [[Kalākaua|King Kalākaua]] printed a sixty-page pamphlet of the ''Kumulipo''. Attached to the pamphlet was a 2-page paper which on how the chant was originally composed and recited.&lt;ref name="beck"/&gt;

Years later [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] described the chant as a prayer of the development of the universe and the ancestry of the [[Hawaii]]ans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Hawaiian Chant of Creation |work= Ka Leo ʻO Na Kahuna Lapaʻau ʻO Hawaiʻi; Hale ʻO Lono web site |year= 2001 |url= http://www.kahunahaleolono.org/kumulipo.html |accessdate= November 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lili{{okina}}uokalani translated the chant under house arrest in [[Iolani Palace]].
The translation was published in 1897, then republished by Pueo Press in 1978.&lt;ref name="liliu"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Kumulipo |author= Queen Liliʻuokalani |origyear= 1897 |publisher= Pueo Press |year= 1978 |isbn= 978-0-917850-02-8 |url= http://www.sacred-texts.com/pac/lku/index.htm |authorlink= Liliuokalani }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kumulipo'' is a total of 2102 lines long, in honor of [[Kalaninuiamamao]], who created peace for all when he was born. There was a lot of fighting between his [[ʻI]] and [[House of Keawe|Keawe family]], who were cousins so his birth stopped the two from feuding. The ''Kumulipo'' is a cosmogonic genealogy, which means that it relates to the stars and the moon. Out of the 2102 lines, it has 16 "wā" which means era or age. In each ''wā'', something is born whether it is a human, plant, or creature.&lt;ref name="beck"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Kumulipo: A Hawaiian Creation Chant |author= [[Martha Warren Beckwith]] |year= 1951 |publisher= [[University of Chicago Press]] |isbn= 0-8248-0771-5 |url= http://www.ling.hawaii.edu/faculty/stampe/Oral-Lit/Hawaiian/Kumulipo/kumulipo-book.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==
The ''Kumulipo'' is divided into sixteen ''wā'', sections. The first seven ''wā'' fall under the section of ''pō'' (darkness), the age of spirit. The Earth may or may not exist, but the events described do not take place in a physical universe. The words show the development of life as it goes through similar stages as a human child. All plants and animals of sea and land, earth and sky, male and female are created.&lt;ref name= "obscure"&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Lilikala Kameʻeleihiwa]] |title= Kumulipo |publisher= [[University of Hawaii]] |year= 2008 |page=174 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- what is this? a book? Thesis? paper? --&gt; Eventually, it leads to early mammals.

These are the first four lines of the ''Kumulipo'':

The second section, containing the remaining nine wā, is ''ao'' and is signaled by the arrival of light and the gods, who watch over the changing of animals into the first humans. After that is the complex genealogy of Kalaninuiamamao that goes all the way to the late 18th century.

==Births in each ''wā''==
The births in each age include:&lt;ref name="HCP"&gt;Hawaiʻi: Center of the Pacific, Lilikalā Kameʻeleihiwa. ''Kumulipo''.&lt;/ref&gt;
# In the first ''wā'', the sea urchins and ''limu'' (seaweed) were born. The ''limu'' was connected through its name to the land ferns. Some of these ''limu'' and fern pairs include: ʻEkaha and ʻEkahakaha, Limu ʻAʻalaʻula and ʻalaʻalawainui mint, Limu Manauea and Kalo Maunauea upland taro, Limu Kala and ʻAkala strawberry. These plants were born to protect their sea cousins.
# In the second ''wā'', 73 types of fish. Some deep sea fish include ''Naiʻa'' (porpoise) and the ''Mano'' (shark). Also reef fish, including ''Moi'' and ''Weke''. Certain plants that have similar names are related to these fish and are born as protectors of the fish.
# In the third ''wā'', 52 types of flying creatures, which include birds of the sea such as ʻIwa (frigate or man-of-war bird), the Lupe, and the Noio (Hawaiian noddy tern). These sea birds have land relatives, such as ''Io'' (hawk), ''Nene'' (goose), and ''Pueo'' (owl). In this wā, insects were also born, such as Peʻelua (caterpillar) and the Pulelehua (butterfly).
# In the fourth ''wā'', the creepy and crawly creatures are born. These include ''Honu'' (sea turtle), ''Ula'' (lobster), ''Moʻo'' (lizards), and ''Opeope'' (jellyfish). Their cousins on land include ''Kuhonua'' (maile vine) and ''ʻOheʻohe'' bamboo.
# In the fifth ''wā'', ''Kalo'' (taro) is born.
# In the sixth ''wā'', ''Uku'' (flea) and the ''ʻIole'' (rat) are born.
# In the seventh ''wā'', ''ʻĪlio'' (dog) and the ''Peʻapeʻa'' (bat) are born.
# In the eighth ''wā'', the four divinities are born: [[Laʻilaʻi]] (Female), [[Kiʻi]] (Male), [[Kāne]] (God), [[Kanaloa]] (Octopus), respectively.
# In the ninth ''wā'', Laʻilaʻi takes her eldest brother Kiʻi as a mate and the first humans are born from her brain.
# In the tenth ''wā'', Laʻilaʻi takes her next brother Kāne as a mate after losing interest in Kiʻi, she then had four of Kāne's children: Laʻiʻoloʻolo, Kamahaʻina (Male), Kamamule (Male), Kamakalua (Female). Laʻilaʻi soon returned to Kiʻi and three children are born: Haʻi(F), Haliʻa(F), and Hākea(M). Having been born during their mothers being with two men they become "Poʻolua" and claim the lineage of both fathers.
# The eleventh ''wā'' pays homage to the Moa.
# The twelfth ''wā'' is very important to Hawaiians because it honors the lineage of [[Wākea]], whose son Hāloa is the ancestor of all people.
# The thirteenth ''wā'' is also very important to Hawaiians because it honors the lineage of Hāloa's mother Papa.
# In the fourteenth ''wā'' Liʻaikūhonua mates with Keakahulihonua, and have their child Laka.
# The fifteenth ''wā'' refers to Haumeanuiʻāiwaiwa and her lineage, it also explains Māui's adventures and siblings.
# The sixteenth ''wā'' recounts all of Maui's lineage for forty-four generations, all the way down to the ''Moʻi'' of Maui, [[Piʻilani]].]]

'''Liu Yizheng''' ({{zh|t=柳詒徵|p=Liǔ Yízhēng}}; 1880–1956) was a [[Chinese history|Chinese]] modern [[historian]], [[Chinese calligraphy|calligrapher]], [[librarian]], cultural [[scholar]], [[educator]], and [[academic]] leader. He is known for his personal charisma, spirit and eruditeness. In modern Chinese academic field, it is said that the number of famous experts in various fields including in literature, history, geography, philosophy and even natural science he educated and enlighted was the most&lt;ref&gt;在中國學術界，有說他「培養出來的文、史、地、哲各門乃至自然科學方面的著名專家最多」&lt;/ref&gt;. Liu Yizheng and [[Wang Bohang]] were honorifically called Nanyong Double Pillars (Two pillars of Nanjing University) during early period of Republic of China.  

== Biography ==
=== Early life under the Qing dynasty ===
Born and educated under the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912), Liu passed the first level of the imperial [[civil service examination]] a few years before its abolition in 1905.&lt;ref name="Hon 85"&gt;Tze-ki Hon, "Educating the Citizens: Visions of China in Late Qing Historical Textbooks," in ''The Politics of Historical Production in Late Qing and Republican China'', edited by Tze-ki Hon and Robert J. Culp (Leiden: Brill, 2007), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s his mentor the [[philology|philologist]] Miao Quansun (繆荃蓀; 1844–1919) put him in charge of writing a textbook on Chinese national history that had been commissioned by the reformist high official [[Zhang Zhidong]] (1837–1909).&lt;ref name="Hon 85"/&gt; Liu's ''Brief Account of the Past'' (''Lidai shilue'' 歷代史略), an adaptation of Japanese historian Naka Michiyo's (那珂通世; 1851–1908) ''General History of China'' (''Shina tsūshi'' 支那通史), was published in [[Nanjing]] by a government press in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Hon, "Educating the Citizens," pp. 81 (translation of ''Lidai shilue''; publication info), 84 (Nanjing), and 85 (Naka Michiyo's textbook).&lt;/ref&gt; After a two-month visit to [[Meiji Japan]] in 1902 during which he was impressed by the new Japanese education system, Liu used his new textbook to teach history in schools that had been created as part of the late Qing "New Policies" (''Xinzheng'' 新政, 1901–1911).&lt;ref name="Hon 85"/&gt; In 1905 the new Ministry of Education (''Xuebu'' 學部) officially designated Liu's ''Brief Account'' as a national textbook.&lt;ref name="Hon 85"/&gt;

=== Republican times ===
After [[Xinhai Revolution|the Qing fell]] and was replaced by a [[Republican China|Republican government]], Liu opposed [[Hu Shi]]'s call for a "literary revolution" that consisted in replacing [[classical Chinese]] with more vernacular forms of writing, a kind of reform advocated by the intellectuals of the [[New Culture Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Q. Edward Wang, ''Inventing China Through History: The May Fourth Approach to Historiography'' (Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 2001), p 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Refusing to ascribe China's recent difficulties to [[Confucianism]] or traditional Chinese culture, Liu attributed them to the [[Manchu people|Manchurian]] domination, the [[Opium War]], corrupt government, warlords, and all kinds of social problems which, he argued, is not the consequence of practice but the absence of practice of Confucianism.&lt;ref&gt;Lydia H. Liu, ''Translingual Practice: Literature, National Culture, and Translated Modernity, China, 1900–1937'' (Stanford, Stanford University Press, 1995), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"For example, Confucius teaches [[Ren (Confucianism)|ren]], but today in China many people are not ren. Confucius teaches [[Yi (Confucianism)|yi]], but many people only know profit. Confucius teaches integrity, but many people are fraudulent. Confucius teaches forgiveness, but many people only criticize others and do not self-restrain. Confucius teaches adoring study, but many people dislike study. All in all, the teaching of Confucius, is the teaching to be human. However, today many people do not know how to be human, but only know to get profit, thus they are not Confucianists." (孔子教人以仁，而今中國大多數之人皆不仁。孔子教人以義，而今中國大多數之人惟知有利。孔子教人尚誠，而今中國大多數之人皆務詐偽。孔子教人尚恕，而今中國大多數之人，皆務責人而不克己。孔子教人尚學，而今中國大多數之人皆不悅學。總之，孔子之教，教人為者也。今人不知所以為人，但知謀利，故無所謂孔子之教徒) Critical Review 1922.(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s Liu wrote several historical articles for the ''Critical Review'' (''Hsuehheng'' 學衡), a journal that was founded in 1922 at [[National Southeastern University]] (later renamed [[National Central University]] and [[Nanjing University]]) .&lt;ref name="Wang 270"&gt;Q. Edward Wang, "Toward a Humanist Interpretation of Tradition: The Hermeneutics of the 'Critical Review Group'," in ''Interpretation and Intellectual Change: Chinese Hermeneutics in Historical Perspective'', edited by Ching-I Tu (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2005), p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; In some of these articles he defended the value of traditional historical scholarship, disagreeing with [[Gu Jiegang]] and other advocates of the [[Doubting Antiquity School]], who doubted the reliability of ancient Chinese historical records.&lt;ref name="Wang 270"/&gt; Liu's ''History of Chinese Culture'' (''Zhongguo wenhua shi'' 中國文化史), a cultural history of China from times immemorial to the 1920s, was first serialized in the ''Critical Review'' from 1925 to 1929 before being published as a book in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Tze-ki Hon, "National Essence, National Learning, and Culture: Historical Writings in ''Guocui xuebao'', ''Xueheng'', and ''Guoxue jikan''," ''Historiography East &amp; West'' 1.2 (2003): 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Liu's scholarship is usually viewed as conservative, his book laid the foundation for a discussion of China as a cultural entity rather than a racial one as was common at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Tze-ki Hon, "Cultural Identity and Local Self-Government: A Study of Liu Yizheng's ''History of Chinese Culture''," ''Modern China'' 30.4 (October 2004): 508.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Liu Yizheng served as the curator of National Study Library (Chinese Study Library) which later mergerd with National Central Library and formed the new [[Nanjing Library]]. In the library he founded Live and Read System, providing long-term devoted readers vacant rooms to live. Many such readers later call the library Alma Mater.

== Works ==
Liu Yizheng wrote several books on Chinese history, including on the history of education, commerce, and culture. His books also include Business Ethics, An Introduction to Edition, etc. ''History of Chinese Culture'' (中國文化史) and ''Essentials of National History'' (國史要義) are his most important works.

The '''Diocese of Midica''' (in [[Latin]]: Dioecesis Midicensis) is a suppressed venue and head office of the Catholic Church. Midica, near [[Sfax]] in today's [[Tunisia]], is an [[Late antiquity|ancient]] episcopal [[cathedra|seat]] of  the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Byzacena]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d3m15.html Entry] at www.catholic-hierarchy.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t1156.htm Entry] at www.gcatholic.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Pius Bonifacius Gams]], [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&amp;dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], ([[Leipzig]], 1931), p.&amp;nbsp;467.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Antonio Morcelli, [https://books.google.it/books?id=dO4-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA226 ''Africa christiana''], Volume I, Brescia 1816, p.&amp;nbsp;226.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only known bishop of this African diocese is the [[Donatist]] [[bishop]] Mark, who took part in the [[Council of Carthage (411)|411 Carthaginian conference]], between the Catholic and Donatist bishops. The seat on that occasion had no Catholic bishops.

Today Midica survives as a [[titular bishop]]ric and the current [[bishop]] is [[Leonard William Kenney]], auxiliary [[bishop of Birmingham]].

In [[poetry]], the term '''monody''' has become specialized to refer to a poem in which one person laments another's death.  (In the context of [[ancient Greek literature]], monody, {{lang|grc|μονῳδία}} could simply refer to lyric poetry sung by a single performer, rather than by a [[Greek chorus|chorus]].)

In music, '''monody''' refers to a solo vocal style distinguished by having a single [[melody|melodic]] line and instrumental accompaniment. Although such music is found in various cultures throughout history, the term is specifically applied to [[Italy|Italian]] song of the early 17th century, particularly the period from about 1600 to 1640. The term is used both for the style and for individual songs (so one can speak both of monody as a whole as well as a particular monody). The term itself is a recent invention of scholars. No composer of the 17th century ever called a piece a monody.  Compositions in monodic form might be called [[madrigal (music)|madrigals]], [[motet]]s, or even [[concerto]]s (in the earlier sense of "[[concertato]]", meaning "with instruments").

In monody, which developed out of an attempt by the [[Florentine Camerata]] in the 1580s to restore [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] ideas of melody and declamation (probably with little historical accuracy), one solo voice sings a melodic part, usually with considerable [[ornament (music)|ornamentation]], over a rhythmically independent bass line.  Accompanying instruments could be [[lute]], [[chitarrone]], [[theorbo]], [[harpsichord]], [[Organ (music)|organ]], and even on occasion [[guitar]].  While some monodies were arrangements for smaller forces of the music for large ensembles which was common at the end of the 16th century, especially in the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]], most monodies were composed independently.  The development of monody was one of the defining characteristics of early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] practice, as opposed to late [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] style, in which groups of voices sang independently and with a greater balance between parts.

Other musical streams which came together in the monody were the madrigal and the motet, both of which developed into solo forms after 1600 and borrowed ideas from the monody.

Contrasting passages in monodies could be more melodic or more declamatory:  these two styles of presentation eventually developed into the [[aria]] and the [[recitative]], and the overall form merged with the [[cantata]] by about 1635.

The parallel development of solo song with accompaniment in [[France]] was called the ''[[air de cour]]'':  the term monody is not normally applied to these more conservative songs, however, which retained many musical characteristics of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] ''[[chanson]]''.

An important early treatise on monody is contained in [[Giulio Caccini]]'s song collection, ''[[Le nuove musiche]]'' (Florence, 1601).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9830">'''Musa ibn Musa al-Qasawi ''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''موسى بن موسى القسوي''') also nicknamed ''the Great'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''الكبير''', '''Al-Kabīr''')  (born ''circa'' 790&amp;nbsp;– 26 September 862) was leader of the [[Muladi|Muwallad]] [[Banu Qasi]] clan and ruler of a semi-autonomous principality in the upper [[Ebro]] valley in northern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] in the 9th century.

==Rise==
Musa ibn Musa was descendant of [[Count Cassius|Cassius]], who converted to [[Islam]] after the [[Muslim]] conquest of Iberia. His father, Musa ibn Furtun, appears in scattered accounts of the late 8th century, and was apparently assassinated in Musa's youth.  His mother, whose name is unknown, was also mother by another husband of [[Basque people|Basque]] tribal chieftain [[Íñigo Arista]], Musa’s half-brother. 
Musa's early years are obscure, although he is presumed to have supported the Basques against the [[France|Franks]] in the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (824)|Second Battle of Ronceveaux]], a battle generally credited as giving birth to the nascent [[Kingdom of Pamplona]]. Likewise it is claimed that in 839 his son Furtun ibn Musa led a campaign that resulted in a rout of the "king of the ''Gallaecians''", "Loderik" or "Luzriq"&lt;ref&gt;"The barbarian Luzriq" ({{lang-ar| العلج لنريق}}), identified by some with [[Rodrigo of Castile]] (although if so the incident appears to have been misdated) or with [[Alfonso II of Asturias]].&lt;/ref&gt; and he leveled the defenses of [[Álava]].

[[File:MoroMuza(2010-10-31).JPG|right|thumb|200px|Bust in honour to Musa ibn Musa in [[Tudela, Navarre]].]]

==Rebellion==
It is in 840/41 that we first hear of Musa ibn Musa himself. In response to attacks on the lands of his half-brother, Íñigo Arista, and the expulsion of kinsman Abd al-Jabbar ibn Qasi by the brothers Abd Allah and Amir ibn Kalayb, governors respectively of [[Zaragoza]] and [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]], Musa and Íñigo rose in rebellion against emir [[Abd ar-Rahman II]]. This led to a reprisal campaign under the leadership of the emir's son, Mutarrif, and general [[Abd al-Wahid ibn Yazid Iskandarani]]. In 842, Musa was in charge of the vanguard of the emir's army marching against [[County of Cerdanya|Cerdanya]], but believing himself mistreated by the commanding general, Musa again rebelled and along with his nephew, [[García Íñiguez of Pamplona]], defeated a [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Cordoban]] army. Musa ibn Musa and Íñigo Íñiguez again joined forces to ambush and capture one of Abd ar-Rahman's commanders in 843, al-Harit,{{sfn|Collins|p=42}} but the consequence was a massive military response from Córdoba, led by the [[Emir]] in person, resulting in the defeat of the allies and the taking of slaves in the vicinity of [[Pamplona]].. A second retaliatory expedition in 844 inflicted a further defeat, in which Fortún Íñiguez, the premier soldier of Pamplona, was killed and Musa and Íñigo barely escaped, while hundreds of the Pamplona nobility defected to the Cordoban side. Musa submitted and in November led his troops to [[Seville]], helping to rout a [[Viking]] raiding party. However, he again rebelled the next year. When [[Muhammad I of Córdoba|Muhammad]], son of Abd ar-Rahman, took Tudela, Musa submitted, offered his sons as hostages and went to the emir’s court.{{sfn|Collins|p=42}} In 846 Musa again was forced to submit, this time to the emir's son Hisham, but Abd ar-Rahman was again forced to launch punitive campaigns against Musa in 847, and in 850 when Musa and Íñigo again joined in rebellion, Musa's son [[Isma'il ibn Musa]] playing a critical role in the uprising.

==Third King of Spain==
The Islamic year 237 (851/2) proved critical for Musa ibn Musa. In this year his half-brother and repeated ally in rebellion, Íñigo Arista, died, as did the emir, Abd er-Rahman II. Musa also gained a great victory in a two-day battle, defeating Basque or Gascon forces near [[Battle of Albelda (851)|Albelda]].  The next year, Musa’s control over his territories and his links to the emirate were formalized, the new emir, [[Muhammad I of Córdoba|Muhammad]], naming Musa ''[[Wāli]]'' of [[Zaragoza]] and governor of the [[Upper March]] of [[Al-Andalus]].  The next decade marked the height of his power. He would control [[Zaragoza]], Tudela, [[Huesca]] and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], forming what was, in effect, a [[Taifa]] state stretching from [[Nájera]] to Zaragoza and [[Calatayud]], and viewed as equivalent to the [[emirate of Córdoba]] and the [[kingdom of Asturias]], Musa being referred to as “The Third King of [[Spain]]”.&lt;ref&gt;“''tertium regum in Spania''”, i.e. Iberia.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monte Laturce.JPG|left|thumb|The hill of Monte Laturce today]]

In 854, Toledo rebelled, supported by [[Ordoño I]] of [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]] and García Íñiguez, and the emir Muhammad launched a punitive campaign which ended in the [[Battle of Guadalacete]], Musa apparently participating on Córdoba’s behalf.  The next year(855) Musa led a Cordoban attack on Álava, in the southeastern section of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]],{{sfn|Collins|p=44}} and in 856 he launched an independent expedition against [[Barcelona]] and [[Terrassa]].  Apparently in 859, Musa’s son Lubb ibn Musa ibn Qasi was appointed ''Wali'' of Toledo, and the same year, Musa permitted a Viking force to pass through his lands to attack Pamplona, where they captured Musa’s nephew and former ally García Íñiguez and ransomed him for either 70,000 or 90,000 [[Gold Dinar|gold dinars]]. This further soured relations between the kinsmen, and García joined with Ordoño in an assault on Musa’s lands, which led to a second [[Battle of Monte Laturce|battle at Albelda]]. The [[Christian]]s divided their forces, besieging the town and pursuing Musa’a army to a refuge on [[Mount Laturce]]. They dealt Musa a crushing defeat, killing his son-in-law, an otherwise unknown Basque prince García, and forcing Musa to flee. This victory would be remembered in Christian sources in the form of the legendary [[Battle of Clavijo]].

==Decline and Death==
The Christian victory at Albeda led to the end of Musa’s autonomy. In 860, emir Muhammad removed Musa as ''wali'' and governor, and personally led an army through Musa’a lands on a month-long punitive campaign against Pamplona which resulted in the capture of prince [[Fortún Garcés of Pamplona]]. In 861, Muhammad required Musa to play a subservient role in a campaign against Barcelona.  The next year, 862, saw Musa trying to re-exert his power, directing a military show of force against his son-in-law, the [[berber people|Berber]] [[Azraq ibn Mantil ibn Salim]] ({{lang-ar| ازراق بن منتيل}}). Musa attacked [[Guadalajara]], but received several wounds, being unable to mount a horse. He withdrew to [[Tudela, Navarre|Tutila]], where he died 26 September 862.

==Family==
Musa ibn Musa is reported by the ''[[Códice de Roda]]'' to have married a daughter of his half-brother [[Íñigo Arista]].{{sfn|Collins|p=210}} She was not his only wife, as he also married a cousin Maymuna ({{lang-ar| ميمونة}}), daughter of his paternal uncle Zahir ibn Furtun and mother of his younger son [[Isma'il ibn Musa|Isma'il]]. No source reports the mother of his other sons: [[Lubb ibn Musa|Lubb]], [[Mutarrif ibn Musa|Mutarrif]] and [[Furtun ibn Musa|Furtun]]. He had at least two daughters; Auria ({{lang-ar| اوْرية}}, ''Awriyah''), wife of Basque prince Garcia, killed at Mount Laturce, and by him having a son Musa ibn Garshiya; and another daughter, "the most beautiful girl in Al-Andalus", married to Azraq ibn Mantil.

==Legacy==
The death of Musa led to a decade-long disappearance of the family from the political scene but it returned to rule over a shrinking territory for another half-century. However, their position between the growing powers of the [[caliphate]] to the south and the Christian principalities to the north proved untenable, and after three generations of varied success, the leaders of the family, Musa’s great-great grandsons, were displaced, exiled or killed by the end of the 920s and the last vestiges of Musa's principality disappeared. His pseudo-autonomy from a Córdoba unable to maintain direct control foreshadowed the [[Muwallad]] rebels of the early 10th century and the later [[Taifa]] kingdoms.

'''Nils Edén''' (25 August 1871 &amp;ndash; 16 June 1945) was a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] historian and liberal politician, [[Prime Minister of Sweden]] 1917&amp;ndash;1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Sweden.html|title=Sweden|publisher=World Statesmen|language=Swedish|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and along with [[Hjalmar Branting]] acknowledged as co-architect of [[Sweden]]'s transition from quasi-[[absolute monarchy]] to a [[parliamentary democracy]] with equal male and female suffrage.

==Early life and education==
Edén was born in [[Piteå]], in [[Norrbotten]], son of a school principal, and graduated from secondary school in [[Luleå]] before matriculating at [[Uppsala University]] in 1889. He completed his [[Ph.D.]] in 1899 and was made [[docent]] in history at the university the same year. He was a specialist in Swedish 16th and 17th century history, but also published on topics concerning the [[union of Sweden and Norway]]. His dissertation, ''Om centralregeringens organisation under den äldre Vasatiden 1523&amp;ndash;1594'' ("The organization of the central government during the older Vasa period, 1523&amp;ndash;1594", 1899), was awarded the [[Geijer Prize]].

==In Uppsala==
Nils Edén became lecturer of history at  [[Uppsala University]] in 1899, extraordinary professor in 1903 and ordinary professor  in 1909. He retained his chair until 1920, when he became governor of Stockholm county. In the meantime he was active as a liberal politician, having written on the burning issue of the union with Norway as early as the 1890s, arguing among Uppsala students for the system of [[compulsory military service]] that was introduced with the abolishment of the [[Swedish allotment system|allotment system]] in 1901, and for [[universal suffrage]], an issue that were in his mind and in the political rhetoric of the time connected to that of compulsory military service.

==In the Riksdag==

In 1908, Edén was elected a member of the Second Chamber of the [[Swedish parliament]]. He became a member of the parliamentary constitution committee in 1911. In 1912, when the liberal Karl Staaff became prime minister, Edén was made chairman of the liberal group in the Second chamber. After Staaff's death in 1915, Edén emerged as the leader of the liberals. He belonged to the liberal right wing which stood close to the right on defense issues and did not share the view of the many liberals from the temperance and free church movements, whose main representative was [[Carl Gustaf Ekman]]. 

==Prime Minister==
The election of 1917 saw heavy gains for the Liberals. Combined with the Social Democrats, they held a clear majority in the Second Chamber. Nonetheless, King [[Gustaf V of Sweden|Gustaf V]] invited the liberal-conservative [[Johan Widén]] to form a government. However, the conservatives were unable to line up enough support to form a government. With no option but to appoint a Liberal-led ministry, Gustaf offered the premiership to Edén. He formed a coalition with the Social Democrats, led by [[Hjalmar Branting]] who became minister for finance. 

The Edén government promptly arrogated most of the king's executive powers to itself. This marked the definitive establishment of parliamentary rule in Sweden, as it was now clear that a king could no longer appoint a government dependent solely on him, nor could he keep it in office against the will of the Riksdag. While the [[Instrument of Government (1809)|Instrument of Government]] stated that "the King alone shall govern the realm," it was now understood that Gustaf was required to exercise his powers through the ministers and act on their advice. In turn, the ministers were now both politically and legally responsible to the Riksdag. This marked the definitive establishment of parliamentary government in Sweden.

The Edén government finally managed to get a parliamentary majority for [[universal suffrage]]. The fear of a revolutionary development in Sweden, under the impression of the events in Russia, post-[[World War I]] Germany and elsewhere, created a pressure for further democratization and through a first voting in the parliament, universal suffrage was introduced in 1921.

The Edén cabinet resigned in 1920, after the issue of joining the [[League of Nations]] had been resolved.

==County Governor==
Edén was appointed [[Governor of Stockholm County]] which he remained until 1938, but continued as a member of the parliament. His objections against the [[prohibition]]ist policies of the majority of the party caused him and about a third of the members of liberal group in the parliament to leave the party and create a new party in 1923.

The '''North Yemen Civil War''' ({{lang-ar|ثورة 26 سبتمبر}}, ''Thawra 26 Sabtambar'', "26 September Revolution") was fought in [[North Yemen]] from 1962 to 1970 between royalist partisans of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|Mutawakkilite Kingdom]] and supporters of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]]. The war began with a ''[[coup d'état]]'' carried out in 1962 by revolutionary republicans led by the army under the command of [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], who dethroned the newly crowned [[Imam]] [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a [[republic]] under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border where he rallied popular support from northern [[Shia]] tribes to retake power, escalating shortly to a full-scale civil war.

On the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|royalist]] side [[Jordan]] and Saudi Arabia supplied military aid, and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] gave covert support, while the [[Yemen Arab Republic|republicans]] were supported by [[Egypt]] and were supplied warplanes from the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=sandler977&gt;Sandler, Stanley. ''Ground Warfare: The International Encyclopedia''. Vol.1 (2002): p.977. "Egypt immediately began sending —military supplies and troops to assist the Republicans... On the royalist side Jordan and Saudi Arabia were furnishing military aid, and Britain lent diplomatic support. In addition to Egyptian aid, the Soviet Union supplied 24 Mig-19s to the republicans."&lt;/ref&gt; Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were involved. [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]] [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 Egyptian troops and  weapons. Despite several military  actions and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate by the mid-1960s.

Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen. The surprising removal of Sallal on November 5 by Yemeni dissidents, supported by republican tribesmen, resulted in an internal shift of power in the capital, while the royalists approached it from the north. The new republic government was headed by Qadi [[Abdul Rahman Iryani]], Ahmed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman, all of which shortly either resigned or fled the country, leaving the disarrayed capital under the control of Prime Minister [[Hassan Amri]]. The [[Siege of Sana'a (1967)|1967 siege of Sana'a]] became the turning point of the war. The remaining republican Prime Minister succeeded in keeping control of Sana'a and by February 1968, the royalists lifted the siege. Clashes continued in parallel with peace talks until 1970, when Saudi Arabia recognized the Republic,&lt;ref name=tds&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, [[Iraq]]-trained Colonel Ahmad Thalaya led a revolt against him. A group of soldiers under his command surrounded the royal palace of [[Al Urdhi]] at [[Taiz]], a fortified stronghold where the Imam lived with his harem, the royal treasure, an arsenal of modern weapons, and a 150 strong palace-guard, and demanded Ahmad's abdication. Ahmad agreed, but demanded that his son, [[Muhammad al-Badr]] succeed him. Thalaya refused, preferring the king's half brother, the Emir Saif el Islam Abdullah, the 48-year-old Foreign Minister. While Abdullah began forming a new government, Ahmad opened the treasury coffers and secretly began buying off the besieging soldiers. After five days, the number of besiegers was reduced from 600 to 40. Ahmad then came out of the palace, wearing a devil's mask and wielding a long scimitar, terrifying the besiegers. He slashed two sentries dead before exchanging the sword for a sub-machine gun and leading his 150 guards onto the roof of the palace to begin a direct attack on the rebels. After 28 hours, 23 rebels and one palace guard were dead and Thalaya gave up. Abdullah was later reported executed, and Thalaya was publicly decapitated.&lt;ref name=revolt&amp;revenge&gt;{{Cite news

[[File:Imam Badr.jpg|thumb|Muhammad al-Badr outside his cave on Jabal Sheda. With him is his cousin, Prince Hassan bin Hussein.]]
In March 1958, al-Badr arrived in [[Damascus]] to tell Nasser of Yemen's adherence to the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR). However, Ahmad was to keep his throne and his absolute power, and the arrangement constituted only a close alliance.&lt;ref name = visitorfrom&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Ahmad went to [[Rome]] to treat his arthritis, rheumatism, heart trouble and, reportedly, drug addiction. Fights between tribal chieftains erupted, and al-Badr unsuccessfully tried to buy off the dissidents by promising "reforms",&lt;ref name= theimam /&gt; including the appointment of a representative council, more army pay and promotions.

In June 1961, Ahmad was still recovering from an assassination attempt four months earlier, and moved out of the capital, Taiz, into the pleasure palace of Sala.  Already Defense and Foreign Minister, Badr became acting Prime Minister and Interior Minister as well. Despite being Crown Prince, al-Badr still needed to be picked by the [[Ulema]] in [[San'a]]. Al-Badr was not popular with the Ulema due to his association with Nasser, and the Ulema had refused Ahmad's request to ratify Badr's title.&lt;ref name=wornout&gt;{{Cite news

===Egypt===
[[File:North Yemen-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.1364|Map of North Yemen]]
Nasser had looked to a regime change in Yemen since 1957 and finally put his desires into practice in January 1962 by giving the Free Yemen Movement office space, financial support, and radio air time.  [[Anthony Nutting]]'s biography of Nasser identifies several factors that led the Egyptian President to send expeditionary forces to Yemen. These included the unraveling of the union with [[Syria]] in 1961, which dissolved his UAR, damaging his prestige. A quick decisive victory in Yemen could help him recover leadership of the [[Arab world]]. Nasser also had his reputation as an [[anti-colonial]] force, setting his sights on ridding South Yemen, and its strategic port city of [[Aden]], of [[United Kingdom|British]] forces.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt;

[[Mohamed Hassanein Heikal|Mohamed Heikal]], a chronicler of Egyptian national policy decision making and confidant of Nasser, wrote in ''For Egypt Not For Nasser'', that he had engaged Nasser on the subject of supporting the coup in Yemen. Heikal argued that Sallal's revolution could not absorb the massive number of Egyptian personnel who would arrive in Yemen to prop up his regime, and that it would be wise to consider sending Arab nationalist volunteers from throughout the Middle East to fight alongside the republican Yemeni forces, suggesting the [[Spanish Civil War]] as a template from which to conduct events in Yemen. Nasser refused Heikal's ideas, insisting on the need to protect the [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] movement.  Nasser was convinced that a regiment of [[Egyptian Special Forces]] and a wing of [[fighter-bomber]]s would be able to secure the Yemeni republican [[coup d'état]].

Nasser's considerations for sending troops to Yemen may have included the following: (1) impact of his support to the [[Algerian War of Independence]] from 1954–62; (2) Syria breaking up from Nasser's UAR in 1961; (3) taking advantage of a breach in British] and French relations, which had been strained by Nasser's support for the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] in [[Algeria]] and primarily for his efforts to undermine the [[Central Treaty Organization]] (CENTO), which caused the downfall of the [[List of Kings of Iraq|Iraqi monarchy]] in 1958; (4) confronting [[imperialism]], which Nasser saw as Egypt's destiny; (5) guaranteeing dominance of the [[Red Sea]] from the [[Suez Canal]] to the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] strait; (6) retribution against the [[Saudi royal family]], whom Nasser felt had undermined his union with Syria.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt;

==History==

===Coup d'état===

====Plot====
[[File:Abdullah Sallal.jpg|thumb|Author Dana Adams Schmidt with President Sallal, March 1967]]
At least four plots were going on in San'a. One was headed by Lieutenant Ali Abdul al Moghny. Another one was conceived by Sallal. His plot merged into a third conspiracy prodded by the Hashid tribal confederation in revenge for Ahmad's execution of their paramount sheik and his son.  A fourth plot was shaped by several young princes who sought to get rid of al-Badr but not the imamate. The only men who knew about those plots were the Egyptian [[chargé d'affaires]], Abdul Wahad, and al-Badr himself. The day after Ahmad's death, al-Badr's minister in London, Ahmad al Shami, sent him a telegram urging him not to go to San'a to attend his father's funeral because several Egyptian officers, as well as some of his own, were plotting against him. Al-Badr's private secretary did not pass this message to him, pretending he did not understand the code.  Al-Badr may have been saved by the gathering of thousands of men at the funeral.  Al-Badr learned of the telegram only later.&lt;ref name=schimdt22&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

A day before the coup Wahad, who claimed to have information from the Egyptian intelligence service, warned al-Badr that Sallal and fifteen other officers, including Moghny, were planning a revolution. Wahad's purpose was to cover himself and Egypt in case the coup failed, to prompt the plotters into immediate action, and drive Sallal and Moghny into a single conspiracy. Sallal got imamic permission to bring in the armed forces.  Then, Wahad went to Moghny, and told him that al-Badr had somehow discovered the plot, and that he must act immediately before the other officers would be arrested. He told him that if he could hold San'a, the radio and the airport for three days, the whole of Europe would recognize him.&lt;ref name=schimdt23&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Sallal ordered that the military academy in San'a go on full alert&amp;nbsp;— opening all armories and issuing weapons to all junior officers and troops. On the evening of September 25, Sallal gathered known leaders of the Yemeni nationalist movement and other officers who had sympathized or participated in the military protests of 1955. Each officer and cell would be given orders and would commence as soon as the shelling of al-Badr's palace began. Key areas that would be secured included Al-Bashaer palace (al-Badr's palace), Al-Wusul palace (Reception area for dignitaries), the radio station, the telephone exchange, Qasr al-Silaah (The Main Armory), and the central security headquarters (Intelligence and Internal Security).&lt;ref name=enein/&gt;

====Execution====
At 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., al-Badr heard tanks moving through the nearby streets, and reckoned that they were the ones Sallal had asked to move. At 11.45 p.m. the army began shelling the palace. Al-Badr seized a machine gun and began firing at the tanks, although they were out of range.  Moghny sent an armored car to Sallal's house and invited him to the headquarters, where he asked him to join the revolution. Sallal agreed, on condition that he would be President. Moghny agreed.&lt;ref name=schimdt29&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The coup d'état was carried out with 13 tanks from the Badr Brigade, six armored cars, two mobile artillery cannons, and two anti-air guns. Command and control of the forces loyal to the coup would take place at the Military Academy. A unit of revolutionary officers accompanied by tanks headed towards Al-Bashaer Palace. By microphone, they voiced an appeal to the imamate Guard for tribal solidarity and to surrender Muhammad al-Badr, who would be sent peacefully into exile. The imamate Guard refused to surrender and opened fire, prompting the revolutionary leaders to respond with tank and artillery shells. The rebels planned to deploy tanks and artillery in the coup.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt;

The battle at the palace continued until guards surrendered to the revolutionaries the following morning. The radio station was first to fall, secured after a loyalist officer was killed and resistance collapsed. The armory was perhaps the easiest target, as a written order from Sallal was sufficient to open the storage facility, beat the royalists, and secure rifles, artillery and ammunition for the revolutionaries. The telephone exchange likewise fell without any resistance. At the Al-Wusul Palace, revolutionary units remained secure under the guise of granting and protecting diplomats and dignitaries staying there to greet the new Imam of Yemen. By late morning on September 26, all areas of San'a were secure and the radio broadcast that Muhammad al-Badr had been overthrown by the new revolutionary government in power. Revolutionary cells in the cities of Taiz, Al-Hujja and the port city of [[Hodeida]] then began securing arsenals, airports and port facilities.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt;

====Coup aftermath====
[[File:Yemeni coup.jpg|thumb|left|Abdullah Sallal (center) and the heads of the coup in October, 1962]]
Al-Badr and his personal servants managed to escape through a door in the garden wall in the back of the palace. Because of the curfew declared, they had to avoid the main streets. They decided to escape individually and meet in the village of Gabi al Kaflir, where they were reunited after a forty-five-minute walk.&lt;ref name=schimdt30-31&gt;Schmidt (1968), pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Sallal had to defeat a fellow revolutionary, Al-Baidani, an intellectual holding a doctorate degree, who did not share in Nasser's vision. On September 28, the radio announced al-Badr's death.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt; Sallal gathered tribesmen in San'a and proclaimed: "The corrupt monarchy which ruled for a thousand years was a disgrace to the Arab nation and to all humanity. Anyone who tries to restore it is an enemy of God and man!"&lt;ref name=arabiafelix/&gt; By then, he had learned that al-Badr was still alive and had made his way to Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=arabiafelix&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian General Ali Abdul Hameed was dispatched by plane, and arrived on September 29 to assess the situation and needs of the Yemeni Revolutionary Command Council. Egypt sent a battalion of Special Forces (Saaqah) on a mission to act as personal guards for Sallal. They arrived at Hodeida on October 5.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt; Fifteen days after he had left San'a, al-Badr sent a man ahead to the Saudi Arabia to announce that he was alive. He then went there himself, crossing the border near [[Khobar]], at the north-eastern edge of the kingdom.&lt;ref name=schimdt34&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomatic attempts===
Saudi Arabia, fearing Nasserist encroachment, moved troops along its border with Yemen, as the King [[Hussein of Jordan]] dispatched his Army chief of staff for discussions with al-Badr's uncle, Prince Hassan. Between October 2–8 four Saudi cargo planes left Saudi Arabia loaded with arms and military material for Yemeni royalist tribesmen; however, the pilots defected to [[Aswan]]. Ambassadors from [[Bonn]], [[London]], [[Washington D.C.]] and [[Amman]] supported the Imam while ambassadors from [[Cairo]], [[Rome]] and [[Belgrade]] declared support for the republican revolution.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt; The USSR was the first nation to recognize the new republic, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] cabled Sallal: "Any act of aggression against Yemen will be considered an act of aggression against the Soviet Union."&lt;ref name=afterahmad/&gt;

The United States was concerned that the conflict might spread to other parts of the Middle East. [[US President|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] rushed off notes to Nasser, [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]], Hussein and Sallal. His plan was that Nasser's troops should withdraw from Yemen while Saudi Arabia and Jordan halted their aid to the Imam. Nasser agreed to pull out his forces only after Jordan and Saudi Arabia "stop all aggressive operations on the frontiers".&lt;ref name=diplomacyin/&gt; Faisal and Hussein rejected Kennedy's plan, since it would involve US recognition of the "rebels".&lt;ref name=diplomacyin/&gt; They insisted that the US should withhold recognition of Sallal's Presidency since the Imam might still regain control of Yemen, and that Nasser had no intention of pulling out. The Saudis argued that Nasser wanted their oil fields and was hoping to use Yemen as a springboard for revolt in the rest of the Arabian peninsula.&lt;ref name=diplomacyin&gt;{{Cite news

However, the British government was insisting on the strength of the Imam's tribal support.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schimdt186/&gt; [[United Nations]] recognition followed that of the US by a day. The UN continued to consider the republic the only authority in the land and completely ignored the royalists.&lt;ref name=schimdt190&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain, with its commitment to South Arabia and its base in Aden, considered the Egyptian invasion a real threat. Recognition of the republic posed a problem to several treaties Britain had signed with the sheiks and sultans of the [[South Arabian Federation]]. Saudi Arabia urged the British to identify themselves with the royalists. On the other hand, there were some in the [[British Foreign Office]] who believed Britain could buy security for Aden by recognizing the republic. However, Britain eventually decided not to recognize. [[Iran]], [[Turkey]] and most of western Europe also withheld recognition. The republic did receive the recognition of [[West Germany]], Italy, Canada and Australia, as well as the remaining Arab governments, [[Ethiopia]] and the entire [[communist bloc]].&lt;ref name=schimdt190-191&gt;Schmidt (1968), pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt;

A week after the American recognition, Sallal boasted at a military parade the republic had rockets that could strike "the palaces of Saudi Arabia",&lt;ref name=theus/&gt; and in early January the Egyptians again bombed and strafed [[Najran]], a Saudi Arabian city near the Yemenite border. The US responded with another aerial demonstration over Jeddah and a destroyer joined on January 15. The US reportedly agreed to send antiaircraft batteries and radar-control equipment to Najran.&lt;ref name=theus&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Ralph Bunche]] was sent to Yemen, where he met with Sallal and Egyptian Field Marshal [[Abdel Hakim Amer]]. On March 6 Bunche was in Cairo, where Nasser reportedly assured him that he would withdraw his troops from Yemen if the Saudis would stop supporting the royalists.&lt;ref name=schmidt192-193&gt;Schmidt (1968), pp. 192–193&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Hard-surface===
While Bunche was reporting to [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] [[U Thant]], the [[United States Department of State]] sought the help of ambassador [[Ellsworth Bunker]]. His mission was based on a decision made by the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], which was conceived by [[McGeorge Bundy]] and [[Robert Komer]]. The idea behind what became known as "Operation Hard-surface"&lt;ref name=schimdt193/&gt; was to trade American protection (or the appearance of it) for a Saudi commitment to halt aid to the royalists, on the basis of which the Americans would get Nasser to withdraw his troops. The operation would consist of "eight little planes."&lt;ref name=schimdt193&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

Bunker arrived in Riyadh on March 6. Faisal refused Bunker's offer, which was also hitched to pledges of reform. The original instructions for Operation Hard-surface were that American planes would "attack and destroy"&lt;ref name=schmidt193-194/&gt; any intruders over Saudi air space, but were later changed to read that the Saudis could defend themselves if attacked. Bunker evidently stuck to the original formula and stressed that if only Faisal would halt his aid to the royalists, the US would be able pressure Nasser to withdraw. Faisal eventually accepted the offer, and Bunker went on to meet with Nasser in [[Beirut]], where the Egyptian President repeated the assurance he had given Bunche.&lt;ref name=schmidt193-194&gt;Schmidt (1968), pp. 193–194&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bunche and Bunker mission gave birth to the idea of an observer mission to Yemen, which eventually became the [[United Nations Yemen Observation Mission]]. The U.N. observer team, which would be set up by the former UN [[Republic of the Congo (Leopoldville)|Congo]] commander, [[Sweden|Swedish]] Major General [[Carl von Horn (1903–1989)|Carl von Horn]]. His disengagement agreement called for (1) Establishment of a demilitarized zone extending twenty kilometers on either side of a demarcated Saudi Arabian Yemen border, from which all military equipment was to be excluded; (2) Stationing of UN observers within this zone on both sides of the border to observe, report and prevent any continued attempt by the Saudis to supply royalist forces.&lt;ref name=schimdt195&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, von Horn was sent to discover what kind of force was required. A few days later, he met with Amer in Cairo and found out that Egypt had no intention of drawing all its troops from Yemen. After a few more days, he was told by the Saudi deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, [[Omar Saqqaff]], that the Saudis would not accept any attempt by Egypt to leave security forces after their withdrawal.&lt;ref name=schimdt195/&gt; Saudi Arabia had already been cutting back on its support to the royalists, in part because Egypt's projected plan for unity with Syria and Iraq made Nasser seem too dangerous. By that time, the war cost Egypt $1,000,000 a day and nearly 5,000 casualties. Although promising to remove her troops, Egypt had the privilege of leaving an unspecified number for the "training"&lt;ref name=anotherjob/&gt; of Yemen's republican army.&lt;ref name=anotherjob&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, von Horn went to San'a, unsuccessfully trying to achieve the objective of 1) ending Saudi aid to the royalists, 2) creating a 25-mile demilitarized strip along the Saudi border, and 3) supervising the phased withdrawal of the Egyptian troops.&lt;ref name=harriedare&gt;{{Cite news

===Egyptian offensives===
[[File:Yemencivilwar.png|thumb|left|The Ramadan (straight) and Haradh (dotted) offensives]]
The Egyptian [[General Staff]] divided the Yemen War into three operational objectives. The first was the air phase, it began with jet trainers modified to strafe and carry bombs and ended with three wings of fighter-bombers, stationed near the Saudi-Yemeni border. Egyptian sorties went along the [[Tiahma]] Coast of Yemen and into the Saudi towns of Najran and [[Jizan]]. It was designed to attack royalist ground formations and substitute the lack of Egyptian formations on the ground with high-tech air power. In combination with Egyptian air strikes, a second operational phase involved securing major routes leading to San'a, and from there secure key towns and hamlets. The largest offensive based on this operational tactic was the March 1963 "[[Ramadan]] Offensive" that lasted until February 1964, focused on opening and securing roads from San'a to [[Sadah]] to the North, and San'a to [[Marib]] to the East. The success of the Egyptian forces meant that royalist resistance could take refuge in hills and mountains to regroup and carry out hit-and-run offensives against republican and Egyptian units controlling towns and roads. The third strategic offensive was the pacification of tribes and their enticement to the republican government, meaning the expenditures of massive amounts of funds for humanitarian needs and outright bribery of tribal leaders.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt;

====Ramadan offensive====
[[File:Republican helicopter.jpg|thumb|A republican helicopter, captured early in the war by the royalists outside Marib]]
The Ramadan offensive began in February 1963 when Amer and Sadat arrived in San'a. Amer asked Cairo to double the 20,000 men in Yemen, and in early February the first 5,000 of the reinforcement arrived. On February 18 a task force of fifteen tanks, twenty armored cars, eighteen trucks and numerous jeeps took off from San'a' moving northwards, heading for Sadah. More garrison troops followed. A few days later another task force, spearheaded by 350 men in tanks and armored cars, struck out from Sadah southeastwards toward Marib. The maneuvered into the [[Rub al-Khali]] desert, perhaps well into Saudi territory, and there they were built up by an airlift. Then they headed westwards. On February 25 they occupied Marib and on March 7 they took Harib. A royalist force of 1,500 men ordered down from Najran failed to stop them on their way out from Sadah. The royalist commander at Harib fled to [[Beihan]], on the British-protected side of the border.&lt;ref name=schimdt164-165&gt;Schmidt (1968), pp. 164–165&lt;/ref&gt; In the battle of [[El Argoup]], {{convert|25|mi}} southeast of San'a, 500 royalists under Prince Abdullah's command attacked an Egyptian position on top of a sheer-sided hill that was fortified with six Soviet [[T-54 tank]]s, a dozen armored cars and entrenched machine guns. The royalists advanced in a thin skirmish line and were plastered by artillery, mortars and strafing planes. They replied with rifles, one mortar with 20 rounds, and a bazooka with four rounds. The battle lasted a week and cost the Egyptians three tanks, seven armored cars and 160 dead.&lt;ref name=forallah/&gt; The Egyptians were now in positions from which they could hope to interdict the royalist movement of supplies in the mountains north and east of San'a'.&lt;ref name=schimdt164-165/&gt;

In the beginning of April the royalists held a conference with Faisal in Riyadh. They decided to adopt new tactics, including attempts to get supplies around the positions now held by the Egyptians by using camels instead of trucks to cross the mountains to reach the positions east of San'a. Camel caravans from Beihan would swing into the Rub al-Khali and enter Yemen north of Marib. It was also decided that the royalists must now strengthen their operations west of the mountains with three "armies". By the end of April, they began to recover and contended to have regained some of positions from the Egyptians had taken in the Jawf, particularly the small but strategic towns of [[Barat, Yemen|Barat]] and [[Safra, Yemen|Safra]], both in the mountains between Sadah and the Jawf, and were able to move freely in the eastern [[Khabt]] desert. In the Jawf they claimed to have cleaned up all Egyptian strong-points except [[Hazm]], and in the west the town of [[Batanah]].&lt;ref name=schimdt169-170&gt;Schmidt (1968), pp. 169–170&lt;/ref&gt;

====Haradh offensive====
On June 12, Egyptian infantry numbering at about 4,000, reinforced by the republican army and mercenaries from the Aden protectorate invaded the town of [[Beit Adaqah]], about {{convert|30|mi}} west of San'a, where Prince Abdullah held a front extending from the Hodeida road, through [[Kawakaban]] province, to southern [[Hajjah]]. In two days, the attackers advanced about {{convert|12|mi}}, before being repelled by a counter-attack. The royalists admitted about 250 casualties. Next, the Egyptians attacked Sudah, about {{convert|100|mi}} north-west of San'a. They used the unpopularity of the local royalist commander to bribe several local sheiks and occupied the town unopposed. After a month, the sheiks sent delegations to al-Badr soliciting pardons and asking for guns and money with which to fight the Egyptians. Al-Badr sent new forces and managed to regain the surroundings of Sudah, though not the town itself.&lt;ref name=schimdt178-179&gt;Schmidt (1968), pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Royalists on armored car.jpg|thumb|left|A Soviet-manufactured armored car, captured by royalist guerrillas from the Egyptians near Haradh]]
On August 15, the Egyptians launched an offensive from their major north-western base in Haradh. They had 1,000 troops and about 2,000 republicans. The plan, as interpreted by British intelligence, seemed to have been to cut the {{convert|30|mi}} track southward through the mountains from the Saudi border at [[Khoubah]] to al-Badr's headquarters in the [[Qara mountains]] near [[Washa]], and then to split into two task forces, one moving east through Washa to the headquarters and the other north-eastwards along the track to the Saudi border below the [[Razih]] mountains. The Egyptians began their move on Saturday morning, moving along the Haradh and Tashar ravines. On Saturday and Sunday afternoons they were caught in heavy rain and their vehicles, including twenty tanks and about forty armored cars sank axle deep into the mud. The defenders left them alone until Monday at dawn. Al-Badr left his headquarters at three that morning with 1,000 men to direct a counterattack in the Tashar ravine, while Abdullah Hussein attacked in the Haradh ravine.&lt;ref name=schimdt179-180&gt;Schmidt (1968), pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Egyptians had planned a coordinated drive from Sadah to the southwest, below the Razih mountains, hoping to link up with the force coming from Haradh. They were counting on a local sheik, whose forces were to supposed to join 250 Egyptian parachutists. The sheik failed to deliver, and the parachutists made their way back to Sadah, suffering losses from snipers on the way. Al-Badr had sent radio messages and summonses by runner in all directions calling for reinforcement. He asked reserve forces training in the Jawf to arrive in trucks mounting 55- and 57-millimeter cannon and 81 millimeter mortars and heavy machine guns. They arrived within forty-eight hours, in time to face the attackers. They outflanked the Egyptian columns, still stuck in mud in the ravines. They later announced they had knocked out ten of the Egyptian tanks and about half of their armored cars, and claimed to have shot down an Ilyushin bomber.&lt;ref name=schimdt180&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; The royalists also carried out two supporting movements. One was a raid on [[Jihana]], in which several staff officers were killed. The second was an attempt, involving British advisors and French and Belgian mercenaries from [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], to bombard San'a from a nearby mountain peak. Other diversionary operations included raids on Egyptian aircraft and tanks at the south airport of San'a and a mortar at the Egyptian and republican residence in a suburb of Taiz.&lt;ref name=schimdt180-182&gt;Schmidt (1968), pp. 180–182&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Egyptians managed to drive al-Badr out of his headquarters to a cave on Jabal Shedah, they could not close the Saudi border. They declared victory on the radio and on the press, but were obliged to agree to a ceasefire on the upcoming [[Erkwit]] conference on November 2.&lt;ref name=schimdt182&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexandria summit and Erkwit ceasefire===
In September, 1964, Nasser and Faisal met in the Arab summit in [[Alexandria]]. By that time Egypt had 40,000 troops in Yemen and had suffered an estimated 10,000 casualties. In their official communiqué the two leaders promised to 1) cooperate fully to solve the existing differences between the various factions in Yemen, 2) work together in preventing armed clashes in Yemen, and 3) reach a solution by peaceful agreement. The communiqué was widely hailed in the Arab world, and Washington called it a "statesmanlike action" and a "major step toward eventual peaceful settlement of the long civil war." Nasser and Faisal warmly embraced at Alexandria's airport and called each other "brother". Faisal said he was leaving Egypt "with my heart brimming with love for President Nasser."&lt;ref name=thealexandria&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, at a secret conference in Erkwit, [[Sudan]], the royalists and republicans declared a ceasefire effective at 1:00 PM on Monday, November 8. Tribesmen of both sides celebrated the decision until that day, and for two days after it went into effect, they fraternized at several places.&lt;ref name=schimdt207&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2 and 3, nine royalists and nine republicans, with a Saudi and an Egyptian observer, worked out the terms. A conference of 168 tribal leaders was planned for November 23. For the royalists, the conference was to become an embryo national assembly that would name a provisional national executive of two royalists, two republicans and one neutral, to administer the country provisionally and to plan a plebiscite. Until that plebiscite, which would decide whether Yemen would be a monarchy or a republic, both Sallal and al-Badr were to step aside.&lt;ref name=schimdt208-209&gt;Schmidt (1968), pp. 208–209&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the two days the Egyptians resumed their bombing of royalist positions. The conference planned for November 23 was postponed to the 30th, then indefinitely. The republicans blamed the royalists for not arriving, while the royalists blamed the Egyptian bombings.&lt;ref name=schimdt209&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royalist offensive===
[[File:Royalist camp.jpg|thumb|The camp used by royalist forces at Hanjar, in north-eastern Yemen]]
Between December 1964 and February 1965 the royalists discerned four Egyptian attempts to drive directly into the Razih mountains. The intensity of these thrusts gradually diminished, and it was estimated that the Egyptians lost 1,000 men killed, wounded and taken prisoner. Meanwhile, the royalists were building up an offensive.&lt;ref name=schimdt214&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian line of communications went from San'a to [[`Amran|Amran]], then Khairath, where it branched off north-eastwards to Harf. From Harf it turned due south to Farah, and then South-eastwards to Humaidat, Mutamah and Hazm. From Hazm it led south-eastwards to Marib and Harib. A military convoy went over this route twice a month. Since the royalists had closed the direct route across the mountains from San'a to Marib, the Egyptians had no other way.&lt;ref name=schimdt221-222&gt;Schmidt (1968), pp. 221–222&lt;/ref&gt;

The royalists under the command of Prince Mohamed's objective was to cut the Egyptians' line and force them to withdraw. They intended to take over the garrisons along this line and establish positions from which they could interdict the Egyptian movement. They had prepared the attack with the help of the Nahm tribe, who tricked the Egyptians into believing that they were their allies and would take care of the mountain pass known as Wadi Humaidat themselves. The royalist deal was that the Nahm would be entitled to loot the ambushed Egyptians. The Egyptians may have suspected something was up, as they sent a reconnaissance aircraft over the area a day before the attack. The royalists thus occupied two mountains known as Asfar and Ahmar and installed 75-mm guns and mortars overlooking the wadi.&lt;ref name=schimdt222&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; On April 15, the day after the last Egyptian convoy went through, the royalists launched a surprise attack. Both forces numbered at only a couple of thousands. The guns positioned on Asfar and Ahmar opened fire, and then the Nahm came out from behind the rocks. Finally, Prince Mohamed's troops followed. This time, the royalists' operation was fully coordinated by radio. Some of the Egyptians surrendered without resistance, others fled to Harah 800 yards to the north. Both sides brought reinforcements and the battle shifted between Harf and Hazm.&lt;ref name=schimdt222/&gt;

Meanwhile, Prince Abdullah bin Hassan began to raid Egyptian positions north-east of San'a at Urush, Prince Mohamed bin Mohsin was attacking the Egyptians with 500 men west of Humaidat, Prince Hassan struck out from near Sadah and Prince Hassan bin Hussein moved from Jumaat, west of Sadah, to within mortar-firing distance of the Egyptian airfield west of Sadah. Fifty Egyptians surrendered at Mutanah, near Humaidat. They were eventually allowed to evacuate to San'a with their arms. Mohamed's policy was to keep officers as prisoners for exchange, and to allow soldiers to go in return for their arms. Three to five thousand Egyptian troops in garrisons on the eastern slopes of the mountains and in the desert now had to be supplied entirely by air.&lt;ref name=schimdt222-223&gt;Schmidt (1968), pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stalemate===
[[File:Marib bomb damage.jpg|thumb|left|Egyptian bomb damage in a village near Marib]]
The royalist radio tried to widen the split in republican ranks by promising amnesty to all non-royalists once the Egyptians were withdrawn. Al-Badr also promised a new form of government: "a constitutionally democratic system" ruled by a "national assembly elected by the people of Yemen". At Sallal's request, Nasser provided him with ammunition and troop reinforcements by transport plane from Cairo.&lt;ref name=backto&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August, the royalists had seven "armies", each varying in strength between 3,000 and 10,000 men, with a total somewhere between 40,000 and 60,000. There were also five or six times as many armed royal tribesmen, and the regular force under Prince Mohamed. In early June they moved into Sirwah in eastern Yemen. On June 14 they entered Qaflan and on July 16 they occupied Marib.&lt;ref name=schimdt233&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; According to official Egyptian army figures, they had 15,194 killed.&lt;ref name=schimdt234&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; The war was costing Egypt $500,000 a day. The royalists had lost an estimated 40,000 dead.&lt;ref name=aman/&gt; In late August, Nasser decided to get the Soviets more involved in the conflict. He convinced them to cancel a $500 million debt he had incurred and provide military aid to the republicans.&lt;ref name=safran120&gt;Safran (1988), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In early May, Sallal fired his Premier, General Hassan Amri, and appointed Ahmed Noman in his place. Noman was considered a moderate who believed in compromise. He had resigned as president of the republican Consultative Council in December in protest against Sallal's "failure to fulfill the people's aspirations". Noman's first act was to name a new 15-man Cabinet, maintaining an even balance between Yemen's two main tribal groupings, the mountain [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] Shias, who were mostly royalist, and the [[Shafi'i]] [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]], who were mostly republican.&lt;ref name=aman&gt;{{Cite news |issn = 0040-781X |title = A Man to End the War |work = Time |accessdate = August 26, 2008 |date = 1965-05-07 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898737,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt had run up a foreign debt of nearly $3 billion, and the gap between exports and imports had widened to a record $500 million for 1965. On Victory Day in [[Port Said]], Nasser conceded that "We are facing difficulties. We must all work harder  and make sacrifices. I have no magic button that I can push to produce the things you want". Premier [[Zakaria Mohieddin]] raised Egypt's income tax, added a "defense tax" on all sales, and boosted tariffs on nonessential imports. He also hiked the cost of luxury goods 25% and set low price ceilings on most foodstuffs. He sent 400 plainclothesmen to Cairo's to arrest 150 shopkeepers for price violations.&lt;ref name=fewercurses&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1966, the Egyptian forces, now numbering almost 60,000, launched their biggest offensive. The royalists counterattacked but the stalemate resumed. Egyptian-supported groups executed sabotage bombings in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=safran121&gt;Safran (1988), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech on [[May Day]], 1966, Nasser said the war was entering a new phase. He launched what he called a "long-breath strategy." The plan was to pare the army from 70,000 men to 40,000, withdraw from exposed positions in eastern and northern Yemen, and tighten the hold on particular parts of Yemen: the Red Sea coastline; a northern boundary that takes in the well-fortified town of Hajja and San'a; and the border with the South Arabian Federation, which was to become independent in 1968. Nasser insisted that attacks on Najran, Qizan and other "bases of aggression" would continue, arguing that "these were originally Yemeni towns, which the Saudis usurped in 1930".&lt;ref name=longbreath&gt;{{Cite news

The Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East and South Asia, flew in for talks with both Faisal and Nasser. In Alexandria, Nasser refused to pull out his troops, despite the risk of losing part or all of a new $150 million US food-distribution program, and another $100 million worth of industrial-development aid.&lt;ref name=longbreath/&gt; Later that month, [[Alexei Kosygin]] counseled Nasser not to risk a stoppage of the U.S. Food for Peace program because Russia could not afford to pay the bill. The Russians were also willing to aid Nasser with arms and equipment in Yemen, but feared that a widening of the conflict to Saudi Arabia would lead to a "hot war" confrontation in the Middle East. Nasser was warned that "the Soviet Union would be displeased to see an attack on Saudi Arabia."&lt;ref name=thenew&gt;{{Cite news

In October, Sallal's palace in San'a was attacked with a bazooka, and insurgents began targeting an Egyptian army camp outside the city and setting fire to Egyptian installations, killing a reported 70 Egyptian troops. Sallal arrested about 140 suspects, including Mohamed Ruwainy, the ex-Minister for Tribal Affairs, and Colonel Hadi Issa, former deputy chief of staff of the armed forces. Sallal accused Ruwainy and Issa of organizing a "subversive network seeking to plunge the country into terrorism and panic" and planning a campaign of assassination, financed by Saudi Arabia, Britain, Israel and the US.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Ruwainy, Issa and five others were executed, while eight others received prison sentences ranging from five years to life.&lt;ref name=inthe&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February, 1967, Nasser vowed to "stay in Yemen 20 years if necessary", while Prince Hussein bin Ahmed said "We are  prepared to fight for 50 years to keep Nasser out, just as we did the Ottoman Turks."

====Chemical warfare====
[[File:Red Cross at Uqd.jpg|thumb|left|The International Red Cross hospital at Uqd]]
The first use of [[Chemical warfare|gas]] took place on June 8, 1963 against Kawma, a village of about 100 inhabitants in northern Yemen, killing about seven people and damaging the eyes and lungs of twenty-five others.&lt;ref name=schimdt257&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; This incident is considered to have been experimental, and the bombs were described as "home-made, amateurish and relatively ineffective". The Egyptian authorities suggested that the reported incidents were probably caused by [[napalm]], not gas. The [[Israeli Foreign Minister]], [[Golda Meir]], suggested in an interview that Nasser would not hesitate to use gas against Israel as well.&lt;ref name=schimdt259&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; There were no reports of gas during 1964, and only a few were reported in 1965. The reports grew more frequent in late 1966. On December 11, 1966, fifteen gas bombs killed two people and injured thirty-five. On January 5, 1967, the biggest gas attack came against the village of Kitaf, causing 270 casualties, including 140 fatalities.&lt;ref name=nti&gt;{{Cite web

On May 10, the twin villages of Gahar and Gadafa in Wadi Hirran, where Prince Mohamed bin Mohsin was in command, were gas bombed, killing at least seventy-five.&lt;ref name=schimdt264&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Red Cross]] was alerted and on June 2, it issued a statement in [[Geneva]] expressing concern.&lt;ref name=schimdt265&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute of Forensic Medicine at the [[University of Berne]] made a statement, based on a Red Cross report, that the gas was likely to have been halogenous derivatives – [[phosgene]], [[mustard gas]], [[lewisite]], [[chlorine]] or [[cyanogen bromide]].&lt;ref name=schimdt267&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; The gas attacks stopped for three weeks after the [[Six-Day War]] of June, but resumed on July, against all parts of royalist Yemen.&lt;ref name=schimdt268&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Casualty estimates vary, and an assumption, considered conservative, is that the mustard and phosgene-filled aerial bombs caused approximately 1,500 fatalities and 1,500 injuries.&lt;ref name=nti/&gt;

Only military  expenditures were increased, by $140 million to an estimated $1 billion. Nasser also increased the price of beer, cigarettes, long-distance bus and railroad fares and admission to movies. Egypt was losing $5,000,000 a week in revenues from the closing of the Suez Canal, on the other side of which, the Israelis were sitting on the Sinai wells that had produced half of Egypt's oil supply.

As part of the [[Khartoum Resolution]] of August, Egypt announced that it was ready to end the war in Yemen. [[Egyptian Foreign Minister]], [[Mahmoud Riad]], proposed that Egypt and Saudi Arabia revive their Jeddah Agreement of 1965.

Sallal's popularity among his troops declined, and after two bazooka attacks on his home by disaffected soldiers, he took Egyptian guards. He ordered the execution of his security chief, Colonel Abdel Kader Khatari, after Khatari's police fired into a mob attacking an Egyptian command post in San'a, and had refused to recognize the committee of Arab leaders appointed at Khartoum to arrange peace terms. He also fired his entire Cabinet and formed a new one, installing three army men in key ministries, and took over the army ministry and the foreign ministry for himself.

===Siege of Sana'a===
{{main|Siege of Sana'a (1967)}}
[[File:Prince Mohamed bin Hussein.jpg|thumb|Prince Mohamed bin Hussein, deputy to Muhammad al-Badr, in command of the royalist forces besieging San'a, December 1967]]
On November 5, Yemeni dissidents, supported by republican tribesmen called down to San'a, moved four tanks into the city's dusty squares, took over the Presidential Palace and announced over the government radio station that Sallal had been removed "from all positions of authority". The coup went unopposed. In Baghdad, Sallal asked for political asylum, saying "every revolutionary must anticipate obstacles and difficult situations".&lt;ref name=whenfriends/&gt; The Iraqi government offered him a home and a monthly grant of 500 dinars.&lt;ref name=schimdt293&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

The new republican government was headed by Qadi [[Abdul Rahman Iryani]], Ahmed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman. The Prime Minister was Mohsin al-Aini. Noman, however, remained in Beirut. He was doubtful of his colleagues reluctance to negotiate with the Hamidaddin family, preferring to expel it instead. On November 23, he resigned, and his place was taken by Hassan Amri.&lt;ref name=schimdt294&gt;Schmidt (1968), p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Mohamed bin Hussein told the country's chiefs "We have money, and you will have your share if you join us. If not, we will go on without you". The chiefs agreed to mobilize their tribes. 6,000 royalist regulars and 50,000 armed tribesmen known as "the Fighting Rifles" surrounded San'a, captured its main airport and severed the highway to the port of Hodeida, a main route for Russian supplies. In a battle twelve miles east of the capital, 3,200 soldiers of both sides were killed, and an entire republican regiment reportedly deserted to the royalists. Bin Hussein gave them an ultimatum: "Surrender the city or be annihilated".&lt;ref name=thesiege&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iryani went to Cairo for what the Egyptian official press agency called "a medical checkup". Foreign Minister Hassan Makki also left Yemen, leaving the government in charge of Amri. Amri declared a 6 p.m. curfew and ordered civilians to form militia units "to defend the republic". In Liberation Square, six suspected royalist infiltrators were publicly executed by a firing squad, and their bodies were later strung up on poles.&lt;ref name=thesiege/&gt;

The republicans boasted a new air force, while the royalists claimed to have shot down a MiG-17 fighter with a Russian pilot. The [[US State Department]] said that this claim, as well as reports of twenty-four MiGs and forty Soviet technicians and pilots who had arrived in Yemen, were correct. In January, the republicans were defending San'a with about 2,000 regulars and tribesmen, plus armed townsmen and about ten tanks. They also had the backing of a score or more fighter aircraft piloted by Russians or Yemenis who passed a crash course in the Soviet Union. The city could still feed itself from the immediately surrounding countryside. Between 4,000 and 5,000 royalists suffered from republican air power, but had the advantage of high ground. However, they did not have enough ammunition, as the Saudis had halted arms deliveries after the Khartoum agreement and stopped financing the royalists after December.&lt;ref name=schimdt296-297&gt;Schmidt (1968), pp. 296–297&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final accords===
By February 1968, the siege was lifted and the republicans had essentially won the war.&lt;ref name=dresch115&gt;Dresch (2000), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the British had withdrawn from the [[Federation of South Arabia]], which had now become [[South Yemen]].&lt;ref name=yoke&gt;{{Cite news

==Aftermath==
By 1971, both Egypt and Saudi Arabia had disengaged from Yemen.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt; South Yemen formed a connection with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=dresch120&gt;Dresch (2000), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1971, Amri resigned after murdering a photographer in San'a, and more power was given to Iryani, the effective President. By then, the royalists were integrated into the new republic, except for al-Badr's family, and a consultative Council was established. Clashes along the border between the states rose, and in 1972 a small war broke.&lt;ref name=dresch124/&gt;

After the war, the tribes were better represented in the republican government. In 1969, sheikhs were brought into the National Assembly and in 1971 into the Consultative Council. Under Iryani, the sheikhs, particularly the ones who fought for the republicans and were close to the mediation attempt. By the end of the war there was a breach between the older and more liberal politicians and republican sheiks, and certain army sheiks and activists from South Yemen. In the summer of 1972, a border war broke and ended with a declaration from both North Yemen and South Yemen that they would reunite, but they did not.&lt;ref name=dreschtribes261-262&gt;Dresch (1994), pp. 261–262&lt;/ref&gt; There were complaints in North Yemen about foreign influence by Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=dresch124/&gt;

==Opposing forces==

===Royalists===
[[File:Prince Hassan in Wadi Amlah.jpg|thumb|Yemeni Prime Minister, Prince Hassan, talking to tribesmen outside his cave in Wadi Amlah, December 1962]]
Muhammad al-Badr led his campaign with the princes of the house of Hamidaddin. Those included Hassan bin Yahya, who had come from New York, Mohamed bin Hussein, Mohamed bin Ismail, Ibrahim al Kipsy, and Abdul Rahman bin Yahya. At fifty-six, Hassan bin Yahya was the oldest and most distinguished. Prince Hassan was made Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief. The Imam was joined by his childhood pen pal, American [[Bruce Conde]], who set up the post office and would later rise to the rank of general in the Royalist forces.&lt;ref name=schimdt62-63&gt;Schmidt (1968), pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the Saudis spent $15 million to equip royalist tribes, hire hundreds of European mercenaries, and establish their own radio station. [[Pakistan]], which saw a chance to make money in the conflict, extended rifles to the royalists. Remnants of the Imam's Army also had elements of the [[Saudi National Guard]] fight alongside its ranks. [[Iran]] subsidized royalist forces on and off, as the [[Shah]] felt compelled to provide al-Badr (a Zaidi) with financing. The [[United Kingdom|British]] allowed convoys of arms to flow through one of its allies in Northern Yemen, the Sheriff of [[Beijan]], who was protected by the British administration in [[Aden]]. [[British military]] planes conducted night operations to resupply al-Badr's forces.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt; The [[MI6]] was responsible for contacting the royalists, and used the services of a private company belonging to Colonel [[David Stirling]], founder of the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS), who recruited dozens of former SAS men as advisors to the royalists.&lt;ref name=melman&gt;{{Cite news

The [[Lyndon Johnson]] administration was more willing than Kennedy's to support long-range plans in support of the Saudi army. In 1965, the US authorized an agreement with the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] to supervise the construction of military facilities and in 1966 it sponsored a $100 million program which provided the Saudi forces with combat vehicles, mostly trucks. Faisal also initiated an Islamic alignment called the Islamic Conference, to counter Nasser's [[Arab socialism]].&lt;ref name=safran119&gt;Safran (1988), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prince Abdullah Hussein.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Abdullah Hussein (below, center) with his men soon after the Egyptian air attack in Wadi Hirran, December 1962]]
The tribes of Southern Saudi Arabia and Northern Yemen were closely linked, and the Saudis enticed thousands of Yemeni workers in Saudi Arabia to assist the royalist cause. In addition to the Saudis and British, the Iraqis also sent plane loads of [[Baathist]] Yemenis to undermine Sallal's regime.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt; The royalists fought for the Imam despite his father's unpopularity. One sheik said "The Imams have ruled us for a thousand years. Some were good and some bad. We killed the bad ones sooner or later, and we prospered under the good ones". The hill tribes were Shia, like the Imam, while the Yemenis of the coast and the south were Sunni, as were most Egyptians. President Sallal was himself a mountain Shia fighting with lowland Sunnis. Al-Badr himself was convinced that he was Nasser's biggest target, saying "Now I'm getting my reward for befriending Nasser. We were brothers, but when I refused to become his stooge, he used Sallal against me. I will never stop fighting. I will never go into exile.

Al-Badr had formed two royalist armies&amp;nbsp;— one under his uncle Prince Hassan in the east and one under his own control in the west. Both armies controlled most of the north and east of Yemen, including the towns of [[Harib]] and [[Marib]]. The provincial capital of Northern Yemen, [[Sadah]], which would have given the Imam a key strategic road towards the main capital [[San'a]], was controlled by the republicans. There were also areas like the town of [[Hajjah]], where the royalists controlled the mountains while the Egyptians and republicans controlled the town and fortress. [[Mercenary|Mercenaries]] from France, [[Belgium]] and England, who had fought in [[Rhodesia]], [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]], were sent to assist the Imam in planning, training and giving the irregular forces the ability to communicate with one another and the Saudis. They trained tribesmen in the use of [[anti-tank warfare|antitank weapons]], such as the 106mm gun and in mining techniques. The numbers of mercenaries are estimated in the hundreds, although Egyptian sources at the time reported 15,000. Royalist tactics were confined to [[guerilla warfare]], isolating conventional Egyptian and republican forces, and conducting attacks on supply lines.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt;

The objective of the British was mainly keeping the Aden base via cooperating with the [[Federation of South Arabia]], which complicated British relations with many global and regional players, as well as with the rulers of South Arabia themselves. The British involvement was executed mainly via the British Mercenary Organization (BMO), which was capable to stage its own covert operations, independent of London and away from the view of their sponsor Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=jones5/&gt; The BMO was specifically formed to train and support the royalists on the course of the war.&lt;ref name=jones5/&gt;

The Saudis did not have radar systems, and would later state they were not aware of the airlifts. The planes would make the drops and then refuel in [[French Somaliland]] (now [[Djibouti]]) and return to bases in Israel.&lt;ref name=stern&gt;{{Cite news| last = Stern| first = Yoav| title = How Israel Intervened in the Civil War in Yemen| work = Haaretz| accessdate = October 2, 2008| date = 2004-07-26| url = http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=455889| language = he}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the sixth flight, Boyle suggested that the IAF aircraft would also be used to bomb San'a.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Weizman supported the idea and plans were made, but the [[Israel Defense Forces]] Chief of Staff ([[Ramatkal]]) [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and [[Israeli Prime Minister]], [[Levi Eshkol]], denied him.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The ''Porcupine'' operation went on over a period of slightly more than two years, during which the Stratofreighter carried out 14 nighttime sorties from Tel Nof to Yemen.&lt;ref name=melman/&gt;

British support to the royalists remained covert throughout. The Prime Minister [[Alec Douglas-Home]] replied to [[Michael Foot]]'s parliamentary question on 14 May 1964, having according to Hart-Davis "to skate across thin ice" by saying "Our policy towards the Yemen is one of non-intervention in the affairs of that country. It is not therefore our policy to supply arms to the Royalists in the Yemen, and the Yemen Government have not requested these or other forms of aid."&lt;ref name=Hart-Davis7&gt;Hart-Davis, 2012. Chapter 7: ''Shortage of Gold''. page 174.&lt;/ref&gt; To a further question (by George Wigg), Douglas-Home said that "at no time in the last eighteen months have British arms been supplied to the Imam's Government". Hart-Davis notes that this "may have been strictly true; but ... a great many weapons of non-British provenance had been spirited into the Yemen through Jim Johnson's machinations."&lt;ref name=Hart-Davis7/&gt;

British mercenary involvement became public knowledge, when five letters addressed to Johnny Cooper were captured by the Egyptians in November 1963.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Their content was published by ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' and then broadcast by Cairo radio on 1 May 1964. Al-Ahram quoted an estimate for British, French and other foreigners of "over 300 officers", "directed from Britain and most probably under the command of British Intelligence". On 5 July 1964 the [[Sunday Times]] published the letters, connecting "these [[John Buchan|Buchan]]esque freebooters" (Cooper and his team) with Tony Boyle.&lt;ref name=Hart-Davis8&gt;Hart-Davis, 2012. Chapter 8: ''Breach of Security''. pages 175–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the British Government was able to continue denying any knowledge of mercenary activity. On 21 July 1964, Douglas-Home replied to a parliamentary question by saying "Both the present High Commissioner and his predecessor have assured us that they were not aware that the person in question (Tony Boyle) was involved in any way". The following day (22 July 1964), Douglas-Home sent a memorandum to the Foreign Secretary [[Rab Butler]], in which he "decreed that the United Kingdom should 'make life intolerable' for Nasser, 'with money and arms', and that this 'should be deniable if possible'." The result was that a secret Joint Action Committee was created to handle British policy on Yemen.&lt;ref name=Hart-Davis8b&gt;Hart-Davis 2012. Chapter 8: ''Breach of Security''. pages 181, 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The British support continued until 1965, when the Kingdom decided to abandon its Aden Colony.

====Saudi and Jordanian support====
Saudis and Jordanians provided an active support to the royalists through the first years of war. The September 1962 coup d'état in Yemen was perceived a threat to the monarchies in both Saudi Arabia and Jordan, prompting shipments of weapons to the royalists, beginning October 1.&lt;ref name=brecher/&gt; The support to the monarchists was quickly countered by the Egyptian aid to the Republicans, rapidly spiraling the country into a full-scale war, as the Republicans called for general mobilization and the Egyptians dispatching troops. On November 4, with the war expanding across North Yemen, the Mecca Radio reported of Egyptian air force attacks on Saudi villages.&lt;ref name=brecher/&gt; The same day, a military alliance of Saudi Arabia and Jordan became widely known.&lt;ref name=brecher/&gt; Following the Egyptian raids on Saudi Arabia and the official Joint Defense Pact formed between Egypt and the Republicans, the Saudis decided to launch attacks on the Republicans in North Yemen.&lt;ref name=brecher/&gt;

The Jordanians withdrew from the war in 1963, by recognizing the Republicans,&lt;ref name=brecher/&gt; but the Saudi support continued. At some point Saudi border towns and airfields were attacked by Egyptian forces in order to "prevent Saudi supplies and ammunition from reaching Royalist-held areas in the Yemen".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/books?hl=iw&amp;lr=&amp;id=RXci-P9IbigC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=saudi+yemen+civil+war&amp;ots=y8EFih-tFj&amp;sig=X3FFZAiDzKbd7hV0a_pimE4F0uU&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Jones C. ''Britain and the Yemen Civil War, 1962–1965'' P.65]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republicans and Egyptian deployment===
The [[Yemen Arab Republic|republicans]] were supported by [[Egypt]] and were supplied warplanes from the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=sandler977&gt;Sandler, Stanley. ''Ground Warfare: The International Encyclopedia''. Vol.1 (2002): p.977. "Egypt immediately began sending —military supplies and troops to assist the Republicans... On the royalist side Jordan and Saudi Arabia were furnishing military aid, and Britain lent diplomatic support. In addition to Egyptian aid, the Soviet Union supplied 24 Mig-19s to the republicans."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anwar Sadat]] was convinced that a regiment reinforced with aircraft could firmly secure Al-Sallal and his free officer movement, but within three months of sending troops to Yemen, Nasser realized that this would require a larger commitment than anticipated. A little less than 5,000 troops were sent in October 1962. Two months later, Egypt had 15,000 regular troops deployed. By late 1963, the number was increased to 36,000; and in late 1964, the number rose to 50,000 Egyptian troops in Yemen. In late 1965, the Egyptian troop commitment in Yemen was at 55,000 troops, which were broken into 13 infantry regiments of one artillery division, one tank division and several Special Forces as well as paratroop regiments.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt; [[Ahmed Abu-Zeid]], who served as Egypt's ambassador to royalist Yemen from 1957 to 1961, sent numerous reports on Yemen that did not reach Ministry of Defense officials. He warned Egyptian officials in [[Cairo]], including Defense Minister Amer, that the tribes were difficult and had no sense of loyalty or [[nationhood]]. He opposed sending Egyptian combat forces and, arguing that only money and equipment be sent to the Yemeni Free Officers, and warned that the Saudis would finance the royalists.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt;

Egyptian field commanders complained of a total lack of [[topographical map]]s causing a real problem in the first months of the war. Commanders had difficulty planning military operations effectively or sending back routine and casualty reports without accurate coordinates. Field units were given maps that were only of use for aerial navigation. Chief of Egyptian Intelligence, [[Salah Nasr]], admitted that information on Yemen was nonexistent. Egypt had not had an embassy in Yemen since 1961; therefore when Cairo requested information from the US ambassador to Yemen, all he provided was an [[economic]] report on the country.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt;

[[File:Egyptian instructing.jpg|thumb|right|An Egyptian instructor at the San'a military academy showing a Yemeni how to use a bayonet affixed to a [[Mosin–Nagant]] rifle]]
In 1963 and 1964, the Egyptians had five squadrons of aircraft in Yemen at airfields near San'a and [[Hodeida]]. They were using [[Yakovlev Yak-11|Yak-11]] piston-engined fighters, [[MiG-15]] and [[MiG-17]] jet fighters, [[Ilyushin Il-28]] twin-engined bombers, [[Ilyushin Il-14]] twin-engined transports and [[Mil Mi-4]] transport helicopters. They were also flying four-engined [[Tupolev]] bombers from bases in Egypt, such as [[Aswan]]. All the air crew were Egyptian, except for the Tupolev bombers which were thought to have mixed Egyptian and Russian personnel. The Ilyushin transports flying between Egypt and Hodeida had Russian crews.&lt;ref name=schimdt168-169&gt;Schmidt (1968), pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the war, the Egyptians relied on [[airlift]]. In January 1964, when royalist forces placed San'a under siege, Egyptian [[Antonov]] heavy-lift cargo planes airlifted tons of food and kerosene into the region. The Egyptians estimate that hundreds of millions of dollars were spent to equip Egyptian and republican Yemeni forces, and in addition, [[Moscow]] refurbished the [[Al-Rawda Airfield]] outside San'a. The [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|politburo]] saw a chance to gain a toehold on the Arabian Peninsula and accepted hundreds of Egyptian officers to be trained as pilots for service in the Yemen War.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt;

Egyptian air and naval forces began bombing and shelling raids in the Saudi southwestern city of [[Najran]] and the coastal town of [[Jizan]], which were staging points for royalist forces. In response, the Saudis purchased a British [[English Electric Thunderbird|Thunderbird air defense system]] and developed their airfield in [[Khamis Mushayt]]. [[Riyadh]] also attempted to convince [[Washington D.C.|Washington]] to respond on its behalf. [[John F.Kennedy|President Kennedy]] sent only a wing of jet fighters and bombers to [[Dhahran]] Airbase, demonstrating to Nasser the seriousness of American commitment to defending U.S. interests in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=enein/&gt;

==Peace attempts: Khamir, Jeddah and Haradh conferences==

===Khamir===
Noman spoke over Radio San'a, offering reconciliation and inviting "all tribes of all persuasions" to meet with him the following week at Khamir, 50 miles north of San'a, to achieve "the one thing which we all prize over anything else: peace for the nation." In order to convince al-Badr to come the conference, Noman announced that he personally would head the republican delegation at Khamir, and that Sallal would stay in San'a.&lt;ref name=aman/&gt; Al-Badr and his ranking chiefs did not attend the conference, but a handful of pro-royalist sheiks were present. The conference named a committee of five tribal and four religious leaders who were charged with seeking out the "beguiled brothers", al-Badr and his friends. Noman's effort, including a private promise to reach a withdrawal of Egyptian troops, was backed by Nasser. Radio Cairo hailed the Khamir conference as the "dawn of a new era." Sallal called the talks "a complete success", while al-Badr stated that "It is essential that the conflict which has devastated our beloved country be brought to an end by peaceful negotiations between the Yemeni people themselves."&lt;ref name=appointmentin&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by early June, when Noman said that Egypt's 50,000 troops would have to be replaced by a joint royalist-republican  peace force, the Nasserites lost interest in the deal. After Noman flew to Cairo to protest directly to Nasser, Sallal threw seven civilian  Cabinet ministers into jail. Noman resigned, saying "It is obvious that Sallal and his cronies are more interested in war than  peace". Sallal soon named a new Cabinet to replace Noman's, with 13 military men and two civilians.&lt;ref name=apreference&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he arrived in Jedda harbor aboard his presidential yacht Hurriah (Freedom) to negotiate with Faisal. It was Nasser's first visit to Saudi Arabia since 1956. At the request of the Egyptians, due to assassination rumors, the banners and flags normally put up to celebrate a visiting dignitary were omitted, the sidewalks were cleared of people, and the car was a special bulletproof model. On the evening of his arrival, Nasser was welcomed at a banquet and reception for 700 guests. In less than 48 hours they reached full agreement. Once the agreement was signed, Faisal embraced Nasser and kissed him on both cheeks.&lt;ref name=notime&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement provided for
# The gradual withdrawal of the Egyptian force within a ten-month period and the cessation of all Saudi help to the royalists; and
# The formation of a Yemen Congress of fifty, representing all factions, which would be charged with forming a transitional regime and establishing procedures for a national plebiscite to determine Yemen's future government.&lt;ref name=notime/&gt;

===Haradh===
[[File:Prince Abdurahman bin Yahya.jpg|thumb|Prince Abdurrahman bin Yahya, youngest brother of the Imam Ahmad, with a veteran of the imamic army, at Uqd]]
On November 23, the two sides met in Haradh. The first issue was the name of the transition state that was supposed to exist until a plebiscite could be held the following year. The royalists wanted the name "Kingdom of Yemen"  but were willing to settle for a neutral title like "State of Yemen". The republicans insisted on having the word "republic" or "republican" in the title. It was agreed to suspend the conference until after the month-long fast of Ramadan, which was about to begin the following week.&lt;ref name=dialogueof&gt;{{Cite news

'''Paul Kirchhoff''' (17 August 1900, [[Halle, North Rhine-Westphalia|Halle]], [[Province of Westphalia]] – 9 December 1972) was a [[Germans|German]]-[[Mexico|Mexican]] [[anthropologist]], most noted for his seminal work in defining and elaborating the [[culture area]] of [[Mesoamerica]], a term he [[neologism|coined]]. 

Paul Kirchhoff was born in the [[Germany|German]] locality of [[Halle, North Rhine-Westphalia|Hörste]], in the region of [[Westphalia]]. He commenced his [[undergraduate studies]] in [[Protestant]] [[theology]] and [[comparative religion]] at the [[University of Berlin]], moving later to [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg]]. In the mid-1920s he undertook further studies at the [[University of Leipzig]] in [[ethnology]] and [[psychology]], where he first developed his abiding interest in the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;Reisse (1991), see also citation in Gray (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; completing his studies in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Biblioteca Paul Kirchhoff (n.d.) names only his studies in Berlin (''"Estudió filosofía y letras en la Universidad de Berlín, especializándose en etnología americana (1927)"''), although Reisse details his attendance at the other institutions mentioned for his degrees.&lt;/ref&gt;   

He was the co-founder of Mexico's [[National School of Anthropology and History]] in 1938, and held a research position at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].  

Kirchhoff was instrumental in defining the concept of [[Mesoamerica]], a cultural region sharing a number of common characteristics throughout most of pre-Columbian history, geographically defined as central and southern Mexico and northern [[Central America]].

Also, Kirchhoff was a [[left communist]] who was a militant of a group called the Grupo de Trabajadores in Mexico. Kirchoff had formerly been a member of the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD) and then formed an opposition tendency within the [[Revolutionary Workers League (Oehlerite)]] in the USA which went on to join the American Fraction of the International Communist Left.

He died in [[Mexico City]] in 1972.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16000">'''Post-postmodernism''' is a wide-ranging set of developments in [[critical theory]], [[philosophy]], [[architecture]], [[art]], [[literature]], and [[culture]] which are emerging from and reacting to [[postmodernism]]. Another similar recent term is [[metamodernism]].

==Periodization==
Most scholars would agree that [[modernism]] began around 1900 and continued on as the dominant cultural force in the intellectual circles of Western culture well into the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Compare, for example:&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Peter|title=Modernism|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-41544-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-v8SXB4l7kcC|page=18}}: "[modernism] is [...] primarily located in the years 1890-1930 [...]"&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Tim|title=Modernism: A Cultural History|publisher=[[Polity Press]]|location=Cambridge|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7456-2983-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3k_C-1NZ4YYC&amp;dq=isbn=0-7456-2983-0|page=24}}: "[modernism] can be defined as a series of international artistic movements in the period 1900-40 [...]."&lt;/ref&gt; Like all eras, modernism encompasses many competing individual directions and is impossible to define as a discrete unity or totality. However, its chief general characteristics are often thought to include an emphasis on "radical aesthetics, technical experimentation, spatial or rhythmic, rather than chronological form, [and] self-conscious reflexiveness"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Peter|title=Modernism|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-41544-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-v8SXB4l7kcC|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the search for authenticity in human relations, abstraction in art, and utopian striving. These characteristics are normally lacking in postmodernism or are treated as objects of irony.
{{Postmodernism}}
[[Postmodernism]] arose after World War II as a reaction to the perceived failings of modernism, whose radical artistic projects had come to be associated with [[totalitarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Groys, Boris: ''The Total Art of Stalinism'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; or had been assimilated into mainstream culture. The basic features of what we now call postmodernism can be found as early as the 1940s, most notably in the work of [[Jorge Luis Borges]].&lt;ref&gt;See Barth, John: “[[The Literature of Exhaustion]].” ''The Atlantic Monthly'', August 1967, pp. 29-34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most scholars today would agree that postmodernism began to compete with modernism in the late 1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., for example, Huyssen, Andreas: ''After the Great Divide. Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, postmodernism has been a dominant, though not undisputed, force in art, literature, film, music, drama, architecture, history, and continental philosophy. Salient features of postmodernism are normally thought to include the ironic play with styles, citations and narrative levels,&lt;ref&gt;See Hutcheon, Linda: ''A Poetics of Postmodernism. History, Theory, Fiction''. New York: Routledge, 1988, pp. 3-21; McHale, Brian: ''Postmodern Fiction'', London: Methuen, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; a metaphysical skepticism or [[nihilism]] towards a "[[grand narrative]]" of  Western culture,&lt;ref&gt;See Lyotard, Jean-François, ''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge'', Minneapolis: University of Minneapolis Press 1984&lt;/ref&gt; a preference for the virtual at the expense of the real (or more accurately, a fundamental questioning of what 'the real' constitutes)&lt;ref&gt;See Baudrillard, Jean: “[[Simulacra and Simulation]]s.” In: ''Jean Baudrillard. Selected Writings''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1988, pp. 166-184.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "waning of affect"&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham: Duke University Press 1991, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; on the part of the subject, who is caught up in the free interplay of virtual, endlessly reproducible signs inducing a state of consciousness similar to schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham: Duke University Press 1991, pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s there has been a small but growing feeling both in popular culture and in academia that postmodernism "has gone out of fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Garry and Lopez, Jose (eds.): ''After Postmodernism: An Introduction to Critical Realism''. London: The Athlone Press 2001, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been few formal attempts to define and name the era succeeding postmodernism, and none of the proposed designations has yet become part of mainstream usage.

==Definitions==
Consensus on what constitutes an era can not be easily achieved while that era is still in its early stages. However, a common theme of current attempts to define post-postmodernism is emerging as one where faith, trust, dialogue, performance, and sincerity can work to transcend postmodern [[irony]]. The following definitions, which vary widely in depth, focus, and scope, are listed in the chronological order of their appearance.

===Turner's ''post-postmodernism''===
In 1995, the landscape architect and urban planner [[Tom Turner]] issued a book-length call for a post-postmodern turn in urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Turner criticizes the postmodern credo of “anything goes” and suggests that “the built environment professions are witnessing the gradual dawn of a post-Postmodernism that seeks to temper reason with faith.”&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Turner argues for the use of timeless organic and geometrical patterns in urban planning. As sources of such patterns he cites, among others, the Taoist-influenced work of the American architect [[Christopher Alexander]], [[gestalt psychology]]  and the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]]’s concept of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]. Regarding terminology, Turner urges us to “embrace post-Postmodernism – and pray for a better name.”&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995), p. 10; see also a summary of the book at [http://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/library_online_ebooks/architecture_city_as_landscape]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epstein's ''trans-postmodernism''===
In his 1999 book on [[Russian postmodernism]] the Russian-American Slavist [[Mikhail Epstein]] suggested that postmodernism  “is […] part of a much larger historical formation,” which he calls “[[postmodernity]].”&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein believes that postmodernist aesthetics will eventually become entirely conventional and provide the foundation for a new, non-ironic kind of poetry, which he describes using the prefix "[[:wikt:trans-|trans-]]":
{{quote|In considering the names that might possibly be used to designate the new era following "postmodernism," one finds that the prefix "trans" stands out in a special way. The last third of the 20th century developed under the sign of "post," which signalled the demise of such concepts of modernity as "truth" and "objectivity," "soul" and "subjectivity," "utopia" and "ideality," "primary origin" and "originality," "sincerity" and "sentimentality." All of these concepts are now being reborn in the form of "trans-subjectivity," "trans-idealism," "trans-utopianism," "trans-originality," "trans-lyricism," "trans-sentimentality" etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.focusing.org/apm_papers/epstein.html | title=Epstein (specific) - the Place of Postmodernism in Postmodernity}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As an example Epstein cites the work of the contemporary Russian poet [[Timur Kibirov]].&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, pp. 457-460&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gans' ''post-millennialism''===
The term ''post-millennialism'' was introduced in 2000 by the American cultural theorist [[Eric Gans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = The Post-Millennial Age | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 209 | date = June 3, 2000 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw209/ | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the era after postmodernism in ethical and socio-political terms. Gans associates postmodernism closely with "victimary thinking," which he defines as being based on a non-negotiable ethical opposition between perpetrators and victims arising out of the experience of [[Auschwitz]] and [[Hiroshima]]. In Gans's view, the ethics of postmodernism is derived from identifying with the peripheral victim and disdaining the utopian center occupied by the perpetrator. Postmodernism in this sense is marked by a victimary politics that is productive in its opposition to modernist utopianism and totalitarianism but unproductive in its resentment of capitalism and liberal democracy, which he sees as the long-term agents of global reconciliation. In contrast to postmodernism, post-millennialism is distinguished by the rejection of victimary thinking and a turn to "non-victimary dialogue"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Victimary Thinking Forever? | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 230 | date = March 31, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw230.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; that will "diminish […] the amount of resentment in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Moral Heroism | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 237 | date = June 9, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw237.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gans has developed the notion of post-millennialism further in many of his internet ''Chronicles of Love and Resentment''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Chronicles of Love and Resentment | work = Anthropoetics | publisher = [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | date =  | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/Chronicles_home.cfm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}} }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term is allied closely with his theory of [[generative anthropology]] and his scenic concept of history.&lt;ref&gt;For more on both see Gans, Eric: ''Originary Thinking: Elements of Generative Anthropology''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kirby's ''pseudo-modernism'' or ''digimodernism''===
In his 2006 paper [[The Death of Postmodernism and Beyond]], the British scholar [[Alan Kirby (writer)|Alan Kirby]] formulated a socio-cultural assessment of post-postmodernism that he calls “pseudo-modernism.”&lt;ref name="philosophynow"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kirby | first = Alan | authorlink = Alan Kirby (writer)| title = The Death of Postmodernism And Beyond | journal = Philosophy Now | volume = | issue = 58 | date = November–December 2006 | language =  | url = http://www.philosophynow.org/issue58/58kirby.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby associates pseudo-modernism with the triteness and shallowness resulting from the instantaneous, direct, and superficial participation in culture made possible by the internet, mobile phones, interactive television and similar means: "In pseudo-modernism one phones, clicks, presses, surfs, chooses, moves, downloads."&lt;ref name="philosophynow" /&gt;

Pseudo-modernism's "typical intellectual states" are furthermore described as being "[[ignorance]], [[fanaticism]] and [[anxiety]]" and it is said to produce a "trance-like state" in those participating in it. The net result of this media-induced shallowness and instantaneous participation in trivial events is a "silent autism" superseding "the neurosis of modernism and the narcissism of postmodernism." Kirby sees no aesthetically valuable works coming out of "pseudo-modernism." As examples of its triteness he cites reality TV, interactive news programs, "the drivel found […] on some [[wikipedia|Wikipedia pages]]", docu-soaps, and the essayistic cinema of [[Michael Moore]] or [[Morgan Spurlock]].&lt;ref name="philosophynow"/&gt; In a book published in September 2009 titled ''Digimodernism: How New Technologies Dismantle the Postmodern and Reconfigure our Culture'', Kirby developed further and nuanced his views on culture and textuality in the aftermath of [[postmodernism]].

===Vermeulen and van den Akker's ''metamodernism''===
In 2010 the cultural theorists Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van den Akker introduced the term [[metamodernism]] &lt;ref name="journalofaestheticsandculture"&gt;Vermeulen, Timotheus and Robin van den Akker. "[http://aestheticsandculture.net/index.php/jac/article/view/5677/6304 Notes on metamodernism]", ''Journal of Aesthetics and Culture" 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; as an intervention in the post-postmodernism debate. In their article 'Notes on metamodernism' they assert that the 2000s are characterized by the emergence of a sensibility that oscillates between, and must be situated beyond, modern positions and postmodern strategies. As examples of the metamodern sensibility Vermeulen and van den Akker cite the 'informed naivety', 'pragmatic idealism' and 'moderate fanaticism' of the various cultural responses to, among others, climate change, the financial crisis, and (geo)political instability.

The prefix 'meta' here refers not to some reflective stance or repeated rumination, but to Plato's ''[[metaxy]]'', which intends a movement between opposite poles as well as beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metamodernism.com/2010/10/14/what-meta-means-and-does-not-mean/ | title=What meta means and does not mean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1794">'''''Schweizerischer Burgenverein''''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[voluntary association]] dedicated to the study and preservation of medieval [[castle]]s in Switzerland. 
Established in 1927 as ''Schweizerische Vereinigung zur Erhaltung der Burgen und Ruinen'' ("Swiss association for the preservation of castles and ruins"; the current name was adopted in 1959), its original purpose was the securing of castle ruins to prevent their further decay. Under the presidency of Hugo Schneider (1955–1972), the focus shifted on archaeological research, including the first systematic excavations of many sites earlier acquired by the association.  Since 1975, the association has been a member of the [[Swiss Academy of Humanities and Social Sciences]].  During its earlier history, the association served an important function in the preservation of the historical record and archaeological research, a role which was increasingly taken over by state-financed cantonal offices for archaeology since the 1970s, causing the ''Burgenverein'' to shift its focus to scientific publication (a journal on medieval archaeology, ''Schweizer Beiträge zur Kulturgeschichte und Archäologie des Mittelalters'', ISSN 1661-4550, since 1974) and education of the general public (the  magazine ''Mittelalter – Moyen Age – Medioevo – Temp Medieval'' appeared since 1996). The association reported a number of  1,200 members as of 2013.

'''Scipion Dupleix''', lord of Clarens ([[Condom, Gers|Condom]], 1569 – Condom, 1661), was a French historian.

Dupleix came to Paris in 1605, in Queen [[Margaret of Valois]]' retinue, who appointed him as her hotel's ''maitre de requêtes''.

In his position as tutor of [[Antoine de Bourbon]], the legitimated son of [[Henri IV of France|Henri IV]], he wrote ''la Curiosité naturelle rédigée en questions selon l'ordre alphabétique'', ''l'Éthique ou philosophie morale'', and ''les Causes de la veille et du sommeil, des songes &amp; de la vie &amp; de la mort'' for his pupil.

[[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] made him a historiographer of France and a councilor of state in 1619.

==History==
The city's name, ''Shenyang'', literally means "the ''[[Yin and Yang|Yang]]'' side of the Shen River", referring to the fact that the [[Hun River (Liao River tributary)|Hun River]], formerly called the Shen River ({{zh|t=瀋水|p=Shěn Shuǐ|labels=no}}), is at the south side of the city.  According to Chinese tradition, a river's north bank and a mountain's south slope are considered to be the "sunny" – or "Yang" – side.&lt;ref name="理论界"&gt;{{cite journal |author=顾奎相 |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=January 2013   |script-title=zh:沈阳名称由来考——因"沈水"而得名,非"合成"说 |journal=《理论界》 |volume= |issue=01 |pages= |id= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient era===
[[File:Xinle Civilisation Shenyang China.JPG|thumb|left|Xinle Civilization]]
Archaeological findings show that humans resided in present-day Shenyang as early as 8,000&amp;nbsp;years ago. The remains of the [[Xinle culture]], a late [[neolithic period]] society over 6,800–7,200&amp;nbsp;years old,&lt;ref&gt;''Archaeology of Asia'', pp.129&lt;/ref&gt; are located in a museum in the north part of Huanggu District. It is complemented by a recreated village on site. A wood-sculptured bird unearthed there is the earliest cultural relic in Shenyang, as well as one of oldest wood sculptures found anywhere in the world.

The city, now known as Shenyang, was first established in about 300&amp;nbsp;BCE during the [[Warring States period]] by [[Yan (state)|Yan]] general [[Qin Kai (general)|Qin Kai]], who conquered the [[Liaodong]] region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=zh-hans |author=陈寿 |authorlink= |coauthors= |script-title=zh:《三国志·魏志·东夷传》 |year=2000 |publisher=浙江古籍出版社 |location= |isbn=|quote={{lang|zh-hans|昔萁子之后北朝鲜侯，自称为王，后子孙稍骄虐，燕乃遣将[[秦开]]，攻其西方，取地两千余里，至满番汗为界，朝鲜遂弱。}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was then named  '''Hou City''' ({{zh|t=侯城|p=Hóu Chéng|links=no|labels=no}}).  However, around 350 years later during the reign of [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]], the city was sacked and burnt by the [[Donghu people|Donghu]] [[Eurasian nomads|nomads]] and subsequently abandoned.  It came back to prominence during early [[Liao dynasty]] and was known as the '''Shen Prefecture''' ({{zh|t=瀋州|p=Shěn Zhōu|links=no|labels=no}}) through to the end of [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]], and became the '''Shenyang Circuit''' ({{zh|t=瀋陽路|p=Shěnyáng Lù|links=no|labels=no}}) during the [[Yuan dynasty]].&lt;ref name="中国网沈阳历史"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.com.cn/city/zhuanti/07lnx/2007-06/07/content_8357641.htm |script-title=zh:沈阳历史 |publisher=中国网 |accessdate=2014-05-29 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Ming dynasty]], it was designated as a "guard town" (militarized settlements, such as walled/heavily garrisoned cities or towns) named '''Shenyang Central Guard''' ({{zh|t=瀋陽中衛|p=Shěnyáng Zhōngwèi|links=no|labels=no}}) and gradually became one of the most important strongholds beyond the [[Shanhai Pass]].

===Manchu capital===
[[File:Mukden Palace in Shenyang.jpg|thumb|The [[Mukden Palace]]]]
In 1625, the [[Manchu]] leader [[Nurhaci]] captured Shenyang and decided to relocate his entire administrative infrastructures to the city, or '''''{{transl|mnc|Simiyan}} hoton''''' ({{Lang-mnc|m={{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠰᡳᠮᡳᠶᠠᠨ &lt;br/&gt;ᡥᠣᡨᠣᠨ}}}}) as it is called in [[Manchu language]].{{sfnp|Ebrey|2010|pp=220–224}}  The official name was changed to '''Shengjing''' ({{zh|t=盛京|p=Shèng Jīng||l=rising capital|labels=no}}), or ''' Mukden''' ({{Lang-mnc|m={{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠮᡠᡴ᠋ᡩᡝᠨ}}}}), in 1634.  The new name derives from the [[Manchu]] word, ''{{transl|mnc|mukdembi}}'' ({{Lang-mnc|m={{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠮᡠᡴ᠋ᡩᡝᠮᠪᡳ}}}}), meaning "to rise" as reflected also by its Han Chinese name.&lt;ref name = "盛京史话"/&gt;  Under [[Nurhaci]]'s orders, the [[Mukden Palace|Imperial Palace]] was constructed in 1626, symbolizing the city's emerging status as the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] political center.  The palace featured more than 300 ostentatiously decorated rooms and 20 gardens as a symbol of power and grandeur.&lt;ref name = "盛京史话"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lndangan.gov.cn/lnsdaj/jcln/msmf/content/4028eaa228fb517a0128fb557fae1891.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233938/http://www.lndangan.gov.cn/lnsdaj/jcln/msmf/content/4028eaa228fb517a0128fb557fae1891.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-12-02 |script-title=zh:盛京城史话 |publisher=辽宁省档案信息网 |accessdate=2014-05-28 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644 and the routing of the [[Shun dynasty|Shun]] army in the [[Battle of Shanhai Pass]] merely a day later, the Manchus successfully entered the [[Shanhai Pass]] to establish the [[Qing dynasty]] in [[China proper]], with the capital relocated to [[Beijing]].  However, Shenyang retained considerable importance as the secondary capital and the spiritual home of the [[Qing dynasty]] through the centuries.&lt;ref name = "盛京史话"/&gt;  Treasures of the royal house were kept at its palaces, and the tombs of the early Qing rulers were once among the most famous monuments in China.  In 1657, '''Fengtian Prefecture''' ({{zh|t=奉天府|p=Fèngtiān Fŭ|labels=no}}; {{Lang-mnc|m={{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠠᠪᡴᠠᡳ &lt;br/&gt;ᡳᠮᡳᠶᠠᠩᡤᠠ &lt;br/&gt;ᡶᡠ}}|v=abkai imiyangga fu|a=abkai imiyangga fu}} or {{Lang-mnc|m={{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᡶᡠᠩ ᡨᡳᠶᠠᠨ}}|v=fung tiyian|a=fung tiyian}}) was established in the Shenyang area, and '''Fengtian''' ({{zh|l=[[Mandate of Heaven|mandated by Heaven]]}}) was sometimes used synonymously with Shenyang/Mukden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cathay.ce.cn/history/201005/14/t20100514_21397914.shtml |script-title=zh:三陵巷 三陵衙门和盛京将军 |publisher=中国经济网 |accessdate=2013-05-01 |language=zh |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515132813/http://cathay.ce.cn/history/201005/14/t20100514_21397914.shtml |archivedate=2013-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian and Japanese influence===
[[File:Map of Shenyang in 1919.jpg|thumb|Japanese-administered zone (orange) and the old Shenyang city (violet) in 1919]]
After the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] coerced the annexation of the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] with the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] in 1895, though was forced to give it up due to diplomatic pressure from the [[Triple Intervention]].  In the aftermath of the Japanese threat, [[Qing China|Qing]] viceroy [[Li Hongzhang]] visited Moscow in 1896 and [[Li–Lobanov Treaty|signed a secret treaty]] with Russian foreign minister [[Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky]], allowing [[Imperial Russia]] to build [[Chinese Eastern Railway|a Russian gauge railway]] in Manchuria, which opened the door towards further Russian expansionism in the form of [[Convention for the Lease of the Liaotung Peninsula|another lease convention in 1898]], effectively allowing Russia to annex Northeast China in all but name.  However, after the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in 1900, [[Russian Empire|Russian]] forces used the anti-foreigner insurgency as a pretext to formally invade and occupied most of Manchuria, and Mukden became a Russian stronghold in the [[Far East]] with the building of the [[South Manchurian Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=93gAAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=nest+soup#v=snippet&amp;q=mukden%20russians%20day%20before%20formally&amp;f=false|title=The Century illustrated monthly magazine, Volume 68|author=|editor=|year=1904|publisher=The Century Co.|edition=|location=NEW YORK|page=581|isbn=|volume=|accessdate=2011-07-06}}(Original from Harvard University)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOfUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=russians+mukden+formally#v=snippet&amp;q=russians%20mukden%20formally&amp;f=false|title=The Century: a popular quarterly, Volume 68|author=Making of America Project|editor=|year=1904|publisher=Scribner &amp; Co.|edition=|location=NEW YORK|page=581|isbn=|volume=|accessdate=2011-07-06}}(Original from the University of Michigan)&lt;/ref&gt;

The postmark of the Chinese postal administration kept the spelling "MOUKDEN/{{lang|zh|奉天}}" for usage on international mails until the late 1920s.

In the early 20th century, Shenyang began expanding out of its old city walls.

Over the past 200 years or so, Shenyang has somehow managed to grow and increase its industrial might, despite consecutive wars with [[Russia]] and [[Japan]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Second World War, and China's Civil War (Shenyang became the main battleground between the Communists and Nationalists). The city never came to an economic halt until the 1990s, when its massive factories went bankrupt and left millions jobless, which was well documented in the film ''[[Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2007/04/19/btm/index_np.html|title=West of the Tracks|publisher=The New York Times|author=CATSOULIS, Jeannette|accessdate=2007-11-24|date=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old City==
[[File:Map of Mukden 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Layout of Shenyang's old city walls]]
The old city of Shenyang resided almost entirely within the modern day [[Shenhe District]], and used to have two [[Chinese city wall|city wall]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Situated roughly within the area bounded by the four "Shuncheng" ({{zh|s=顺城|l=along the city walls|labels=no}}) roads/streets in Shenhe District, the (now-demolished) square-shaped inner city wall marked the bounds of ancient Shenyang.  The earliest wall was built in 926 during early [[Liao dynasty]] to settle [[Northern Song]] civilians the [[Khitan people|Khitans]] abducted from raids to use as [[unfree labour|slave labourer]]s, and was then made of [[rammed earth]] because the city was merely a small settlement at the time (historically the administrative center of the [[Liaodong]] region was at [[Liaoyang]]).  However, in 1368, [[Hongwu Emperor]] of the newly founded [[Ming dynasty]] ordered a new regional military command—the Liaodong Regional Military Commission ({{zh|t=遼東都指揮使司|labels=no}})—to be established, and Shenyang was made a prominent regional "guard town" ({{zh|t=衛所|labels=no}}).  In 1388, Min Zhong ({{zh|t=閔忠|labels=no}}), the newly appointed city commissioner of the Shenyang Central Guard, wrote to Hongwu Emperor immediately upon his tenure requesting permission to upgrade the city wall, and the old wall was made taller and thoroughly reinforced with overlaid bricks.  According to ''[[History of Ming]]'', the reconstructed Ming-era wall was 2.5 ''[[zhàng]]''s ({{convert|8|m|disp=or|abbr=off}}) tall, more than 1 ''zhàng'' ({{convert|3.2|m|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}) wide at the top, and 9 ''[[li (unit)|li]]''s and 30 ''bu''s (about {{convert|5.2|km|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}) long.  It has two layers of [[moat]]s dug outside, each being 3 ''zhàng''s ({{convert|9.6|m|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}) wide and 8 ''[[chi (unit)|chi]]''s ({{convert|2.56|m|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}) deep, fed with water from [[Hun River (Liao River tributary)|Shen River]].  There were four [[city gate]]s, each at the center of one side, connected by two main roads that intersected at Central Temple of the city's center in a "+" fashion.

This Ming wall was heavily damaged in 1625 after the Manchu laid siege and captured the city, with only the north wall and gate (which had undergone reinforcing reconstructions in 1545 under the orders of [[Jiajing Emperor]]) remained intact.  The Manchu leader [[Nurhachi]] however saw the strategic value of the city, and decided to formally relocate his [[Qing dynasty|Later Jin]] capital from Liaoyang to Shenyang, and ordered the city wall to be rebuilt.  According to ''Annals of Mukden'' ({{zh|t=盛京通志|labels=no}}), the new city wall was a standard [[brick#fired brick|black brick]] [[defensive wall|wall]] standing at a height of 3.5 ''zhàng''s (about {{convert|12.5|m|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}), a width of 1.8 ''zhàng''s (about {{convert|6.4|m|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}) and a total length of 9 ''li''s and 332 ''bu''s (about {{convert|6.4|km|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}) long, complete with 12 [[fortified tower|tower]]s (8 gate and 4 corner) and a 14.5 ''zhàng''s (about {{convert|52|m|disp=or|adj=mid|abbr=off}}) wide moat.  The city gates were increased from four to eight, though the old Ming-era north gate and tower was preserved but sealed shut, later known as the "Ninth Gate" ({{zh|t=九門|labels=no}}).

The outer city wall, called the "peripheral wall" ({{zh|t=邊牆|p=Biān Qiáng|labels=no}}) or "[[fortification|pass]] wall" ({{zh|t=關牆|p=Guān Qiáng|labels=no}}), was actually a [[rammed earth]] [[rampart (fortification)|rampart]] built in 1680 to expand the urban area outside the inner city.  It was almost round in shape, standing at a height of 7.5 ''chi''s (around {{convert|2.7|m|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}) and an overall length of 32 ''li''s and 24 ''bu''s (about {{convert|20.7|km|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}), and also had eight gates known as the "peripheral gates" ({{zh|t=邊門|p=Biān Mén|labels=no}}).  The corresponding inner and outer gates were linked by roads that intersected within the inner city in a "#" pattern around the [[Mukden Palace]].

Nearly all of these city walls and gates were demolished after 1949.  Two gates and one corner tower of the inner wall were rebuilt during the 1990s.  There had, however, been proposals to rebuild the other gates and towers in preparation to the [[2013 National Games of China|12th National Games in 2013]].

Around {{convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} outside Shenyang's former outer wall, there were four [[pagoda]]s each located within an associated [[Tibetan buddhism|Tibetan buddhist]] temple, namely the East Pagoda in Yongguang Temple ({{zh|t=永光寺|labels=no}}), the South Pagoda in Guangci Temple ({{zh|t=廣慈寺|labels=no}}), the West Pagoda in Yanshou Temple ({{zh|t=延壽寺|labels=no}}) and the North Pagoda in Falun Temple ({{zh|t=法輪寺|labels=no}}). They were built in 1643 and completed in 1645.  The four pagodas are identical white Buddha-[[stupa]]s as tall as {{convert|26|m|ft|abbr=on}}.  Nowadays only the temple for the North Pagoda is well preserved, the East and South has only the pagodas left, and the temple for the West Pagoda was rebuilt in 1998.

Both the [[Temple of Heaven]] and Temple of Earth were also to be found in the old city during the [[Qing dynasty]].  They were smaller replicas of Beijing's counterparts. Neither exists today.

==Geography==
Shenyang ranges in latitude from 41° 11' to 43° 02' N and in longitude from 122° 25' to 123° 48' E, and is located in the central part of Liaoning province.  The western parts of the city's administrative area are located on the [[alluvial plain]] of the [[Liao River]] system, while the eastern part consists of the hinterlands of the [[Changbai Mountains]], and is covered with forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syghgt.gov.cn/ywpd/kczy/content/4028e48233b28ecb01343f9e7c6822ad.html |script-title=zh:沈阳区域地质概述 |work=沈阳市规划和国土资源局 |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The highest point in Shenyang is {{convert|414|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[metres above sea level|above sea level]] and the lowest point only {{convert|7|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minsheng.youth.cn/mszxgch/mswzxx/201308/t20130814_3698864.htm |script-title=zh:沈城母亲河:水光异彩 璀璨浑河 |publisher=中国青年网 |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The average elevation of the urban area is {{convert|45|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="jdsycsfzyshbq"&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree=博士 |chapter= |script-title=zh:近代沈阳城市发展与社会变迁 |url= |author=孙鸿金 |year=2012 |publisher= |accessdate= |docket= |oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's main urban area is located to the north of '''[[Hun River (Liao River tributary)|Hun River]]''', formerly the largest tributary of the Liao River ''proper'' and often locally referred as the city's "mother river".  The central urban area is surrounded by three [[canal|artificial river]]s—respectively the '''South Canal''' ({{lang|zh-hans|南运河}}) from the south and southeast, the '''Xinkai River''' ({{lang|zh-hans|新开河}}, formerly the '''North Canal''') from the north and northeast, and the '''Weigong River''' ({{lang|zh-hans|卫工河}}, formerly the Weigong [[Nullah]]) from the west, all interconnected by channels as a continuous [[waterway]].  The South Canal in particular, famous for the series of [[linear park]]s and gardens along it, was constructed upon the old course of the '''Wanquan River''' ({{zh|t=萬泉河|l=ten thousand springs river|labels=no}}), historically also called the '''Little Shen River''' ({{zh|t=小瀋水|labels=no}}) or '''Wuli River''' ({{zh|t=五里河|l=five-''[[li (unit)|li]]'' river|labels=no}}), which was a principal water source for the old city.&lt;ref name="southcanal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shenhe.gov.cn/dev~shenheweb/home/article/A5978D2B-1760-438A-A4BB-FA0EABAA710D.html |script-title=zh:南运河的今与昔 |publisher=沈河区政府门户网 |accessdate=2016-10-31 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These are reinforced on the peripheries by smaller rivers such as Xi River ({{lang|zh-hans|细河}}), Puhe River ({{lang|zh-hans|蒲河}}) and Mantang River ({{lang|zh-hans|满堂河}}), and drains into the Hun River at three different locations on the southeast, due south and southwest side of the city.  There was also previously another canal on the east side called Huishan Nullah ({{lang|zh-hans|辉山明渠}}) that drains into Xinkai River's lower section, but is now no longer existent due to [[land reclamation]] from urban constructions.

===Environment===
Shenyang has many [[park]]s, among the most famous are the {{convert|14.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} '''South Canal Linear Parks''' ({{zh|s=南运河带状公园|labels=no}}) situated along the homonymous river traversing the southern parts of Dadong, Shenhe and Heping District, covering an area of approximately {{convert|1400000|m2|acre|abbr=on}}.  It comprises 6 large [[park]]s and 18 [[linear park|riverside garden]]s, with exotic variety of vegetations such as [[Chinese rose|rose]], [[Siberian apricot|apricot]], [[bladder cherry]], [[Chinese honeylocust|honeylocust]], [[natal lily]], [[scarlet sage]], [[ivy morning glory|morning glory]] and [[Rudbeckia hirta|black-eyed-Susan]], and extensive [[greenway (landscape)|greenspace]]s of [[peach]], [[Chinese pear|pear]], [[Asiatic apple|crabapple]]s, [[ginkgo]]s, [[weeping willow (tree)|weeping willow]]s, [[pine]]s and [[black locust]]s.&lt;ref name="southcanal"/&gt;  It is the largest stretch of vegetated [[urban open space]] in Shenyang, contributing significantly to the city's current 40 percent "[[greening]] ratio", and was instrumental in the city being awarded the "national forest city" title in 2005.

According to the Shenyang Environmental Protection Bureau, winter usage of coal by [[heat-only boiler station|boiler station]]s for [[hydronic]] [[district heating]] is the source of 30 percent of the air pollution in Shenyang.  Half of the 16 million metric tons of coal consumed by the city during the winter of 2013&amp;ndash;2014 were used for heating.  Other major factors include dust from construction sites (20 percent), vehicle exhaust (20 percent), industrial emissions (10 percent) and extraterritorial dust (20 percent, mostly [[yellow dust]] from [[Gobi Desert]]).  However, air quality was described by the Bureau as "slowly improving".&lt;ref name=CE111313&gt;{{cite news|author1=Liu Ce|title=Coal for heating identified as top air polluter in NE China|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2013-11/13/content_17103212.htm|accessdate=December 10, 2014|work=China Daily|publisher=chinadaily.com.cn|date=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative divisions==
Shenyang's metropolitan area traditionally consisted of the 5 small inner urban districts, surrounded by 4 larger outer suburban districts, and accompanied by 4 rural counties on the north and west sides.  In general, [[agriculture]], [[animal husbandry]] and agricultural product processing dominate northeastern Shenyang; eastern Shenyang is an [[automotive parts]] hub; southern Shenyang is a high-tech industrial base; and western Shenyang is home to [[heavy machinery]] manufacturing.  The city center specialises in retail and financial services.&lt;ref name="Critical Eye on Shenyang"/&gt;

Out of the rural counties, the Xinmin County was upgraded to a [[county-level city]] in 1993, and the Liaozhong County was incorporated into a new suburban district in 2016 as part of the [[Northeast Area Revitalization Plan|provincial/national development plan]].

As a result, Shenyang now officially has direct jurisdiction over 10 [[District of China|city districts]], 1 [[satellite city]] and 2 [[County (People's Republic of China)|rural counties]]:

===Districts===

====Shenhe District====
[[File:Shenyang Qingnian Street.JPG|thumb|right|Buildings along Youths Avenue (Qingnian Street, 青年大街) in southern Shenhe District]]
The '''Shenhe District''' ({{zh|s=沈河区|l=Shen River district|links=no|labels=no}}) is the central area of Shenyang, and currently hosts the [[seat of government|seat]] of the City Government. The old city wall is entirely located in Shenhe District. It has an area of {{convert|60|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="sysinet.gov.cn"&gt;《沈阳统计年鉴（2015）》——分地区土地面积和人口密度 http://www.sysinet.gov.cn/web/tjnianjian/2015sy/01综合/1综合14.htm{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Hukou system|registered]] population of 716,417 (as per 2014).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;《沈阳统计年鉴（2015）》——分地区户籍人口数 http://www.sysinet.gov.cn/web/tjnianjian/2015sy/14人口/14人口4.htm{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is the Central Temple ({{zh|s=中心庙|p=Zhōngxīn Mìao|labels=no}}), built during the [[Ming dynasty]], showing the center of ancient Shenyang.  This temple is located just south of the '''Middle Street''' ({{zh|s=中街|t=|hp=Zhōng Jiē|labels=no}}), one of the most famous shopping streets and the first commercial [[pedestrian zone]] in China.  Shenhe District is also home to the famous Wu'ai Market ({{zh|s=五爱市场|p=Wŭài Shìchǎng|labels=no}}), the largest [[light industry]] wholesale trading center in the entire [[Bohai Economic Rim]].

Shenhe District is the site of the [[Mukden Palace]], just south of the Central Temple.  It is also the site of [[Zhang Zuolin]]'s former home and headquarters, Shengjing Ancient Cultural Street.  In the western Shenhe District there is a [[Muslim]] town, and the South Pagoda ({{zh|c=南塔|hp=Nán tǎ|labels=no}}) is located in southern Shenhe District.  There are a lot of high-end hotels located in Shenhe District, such as [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]], [[Kempinski]], Lexington, [[Marriott Hotels &amp; Resorts|Marriott]] (which is the first Marriott Hotel directly named "Marriott" in [[mainland China]], but due to finance conflicts is not administrated by [[Marriott International]]).  The major thoroughfare of '''Youths Avenue''' ({{zh|c=青年大街|hp=Qīngnián Dà Jiē|labels=no}}), the city's primary north-south [[arterial road]] that traverses past the '''City Government Square''' ({{zh|s=市府广场|p=Shìfǔ Guǎngchǎng|labels=no}}) at the modern center of the city linking [[Beiling Park]] to the [[Taoxian Airport]], separates the southern portion of Shenhe District from the neighbouring southern Heping District.  The iconic {{convert|305.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Liaoning Broadcast and TV Tower]] is situated alongside this avenue.

Shenhe District is also home to Northeast China's main [[railway hub]], the [[Shenyang North Railway Station]] (locally known as the "North Station").  The railways leading to the station forms the border between Shenhe District and the neighbouring eastern portion of Huanggu District.  The station building has recently {{when|date=November 2016}} undergone a major overhaul and extension.

====Heping District====
[[File:Mao Statue at Zhong Shan Guang Chang.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Long Live the Victory of Mao Tse-Tung Thought (Shenyang)|Chairman Mao statue]] at Zhongshan Square]]
The '''Heping District''' ({{zh|s=和平区|l=peace district|labels=no}}) is located slightly west of the center of Shenyang.  It has an area of {{convert|59|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="sysinet.gov.cn"/&gt; and a population of 645,399 (2014).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Heping District has all manner of commercial businesses that are brightly [[neon light|neon]]-lit at night, centered around '''Taiyuan Street''' ({{zh|s=太原街|p=Taìyuán Jīe|labels=no}}), one of the most famous shopping district in the Northeast.

The district, better known as the downtown, sprung up around [[Shenyang Railway Station]] (known locally as the "South Station" in contrast to the "North Station" in Shenhe District), the former hub of the [[South Manchurian Railway]].  At the center of the district is '''Zhongshan Square''' ({{zh|s=中山广场|hp=Zhōngshān Guǎngchǎng|labels=no}}), which features [[Long Live the Victory of Mao Tse-Tung Thought (Shenyang)|one of China's largest statues of Chairman Mao]]—a record of the era of the [[Cultural Revolution]].  Northwest of Zhongshan Square lies the [[Xita (Shenyang)|West Pagoda]] Korean Neighborhood or [[Koreatown]].  Many of the boulevards in this area are lined of very large [[ginkgo]] trees, which become golden in color and produce their distinctive fruits in autumn.

Heping District is also the core area for many political institutions in the Northeast, including [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] Liaoning Provincial Committee, headquarters of the [[Northern Theater Command]] (previously the [[Shenyang Military Region]]), [[General Logistics Department]] and the [[consulate|consulates-general]] of the [[United States]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[North Korea]] and other countries.  Northeast Electricity, [[China Post]], railways, other such industrial hubs and many media outlets such as [[Liaoning Television|Liaoning Radio and Television]], Shenyang Radio and Television and ''Shenyang Daily'' newspaper are also located in this district.

====Dadong District====
The '''Dadong District''' ({{zh|s=大东区|l=great east district|labels=no}}) is an industrial zone and used to be the largest of the inner city districts.  Its name derives from the fact that the district started off as the residential area immediately outside the old inner city wall's Fujin Gate ({{zh|t=撫近門|labels=no}}), which is also called Great East Gate ({{zh|t=大東門|labels=no}}).  It has an area of {{convert|100|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="sysinet.gov.cn"/&gt; and a population of 689,576 (2014).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The district contains popular tourist landmarks such as the [[Mukden Incident|9.18]] Historical Museum, the North and East Pagodas, Bawang Temple and the Wanquan Park.  The oldest airfield in Shenyang, the now-defunct East Pagoda Airport, is also located in Dadong District.

====Huanggu District====

The '''Huanggu District''' ({{zh|s=皇姑区|l=royal aunt district|labels=no}}) is named after [[Huanggutun Railway Station|Huanggutun]] ("tun" means village), where the [[Huanggutun Incident]] took place.  The name is actually a mis-tranliteration of the pronunciation for ''Fiyanggū'' ({{Lang-mnc|m={{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᡶᡳᠶᠠᠩᡤᡡ}}}}, {{zh|t=費揚武|links=no}}, 1605–1643), the Manchu [[Prince Zheng|Prince Jian of the First Rank]] whose tomb was in the area.  It has an area of {{convert|66|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="sysinet.gov.cn"/&gt; and a population of 817,288 (2014).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The district is the site of [[Beiling park]], the large historical mausoleum of [[Qing dynasty]] emperor [[Huang Taiji]], as well as the Liaoning Mansion Hotel. It also hosts the seat of the Provincial Government of Liaoning.

====Tiexi District====
The '''Tiexi District''' ({{zh|s=铁西区|l=railway's west district|labels=no}}) is the most populous district and makes up the western part of the inner city, west of the [[South Manchurian Railway]] (hence the district's name) and south of the [[Beijing–Harbin Railway|Jingshen Railway]], and is famous for its [[heavy industry]].  This mixed-use district also contains large blocks of residential complexes, so as well as strips of small to medium-sized shopping districts.  It previously had only an area of {{convert|39|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;《沈阳统计年鉴（2004）》——土地面积 {{cite web|url=http://www.sysinet.gov.cn/web/tjnianjian/2004sy/01zh/zh.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009213634/http://www.sysinet.gov.cn/web/tjnianjian/2004sy/01zh/zh.htm |archivedate=2016-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a population of 764,419.&lt;ref&gt;《沈阳统计年鉴（2004）》——分地区人口数 {{cite web|url=http://www.sysinet.gov.cn/web/tjnianjian/2004sy/13rk/13rk.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009213515/http://www.sysinet.gov.cn/web/tjnianjian/2004sy/13rk/13rk.htm |archivedate=2016-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2002, the Shenyang city government annexed a large area of suburban land from the neighbouring Yuhong District to establish a new state-level development zone—the Shenyang Economic and Technological Development Zone ({{lang|zh-hans|沈阳经济技术开发区}}), and transferred its administration to Tiexi District to form the '''Tiexi New District''' ({{lang|zh-hans|铁西新区}}), thus giving Tiexi District the current "necked" shape on the map.  The new Tiexi District now has a population of 907,091 (2014),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; a total area of {{convert|286|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="sysinet.gov.cn"/&gt; and enjoys the same administrative rank as a municipality (Administrative Committee of Shenyang).

The district is featured in a 9-hour epic documentary film ''[[Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks|West of the Tracks]]'' by a young filmmaker Wang Bing. It shows the transition in this [[rust belt]] district—a [[palimpsest]] of not only Chinese but also world history. The first factories of this place were built in 1934 by the Japanese to produce war goods for the Imperial Army and nationalized after World War II.  As late as the early 1980s, the factories here employed about one million workers, but all of them went jobless in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc50.2008/WestofTracks/index.html |title="West of the Tracks" by Jie Li |publisher=Ejumpcut.org |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hunnan District====
[[File:Shenyang Dongling.jpg|thumb|[[World Heritage Site]]: [[Fuling Tomb]](Dongling Park)]]
The '''Hunnan District''' ({{zh|s=浑南区|l=Hun River's south district|labels=no}}), was formerly called the '''Dongling District''' ({{zh|s=东陵区|l=[[Fuling Tomb|East Mausoleum]] district|labels=no}}) before June 17, 2014, referring to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]-listed tombs dedicated to [[Nurhachi]], the founder of [[Qing dynasty|Later Jin]], and his empress [[Empress Xiaocigao (Qing dynasty)|Monggo-Jerjer]].  The large suburban district is located on the east and southeast side of urban Shenyang, with most of its territory south of the Hun River, hence its current name.  It has an area of {{convert|734|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="sysinet.gov.cn"/&gt; and a population of 324,074 (2014).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The Shenyang Botanical Garden and the Shenyang International Expo Garden (which hosted the [[Shenyang China International Horticultural Exposition 2006|2006 International Horticultural Exposition]]) are also located in this district.

Hunnan District hosts the city's only operational commercial airport, the [[Taoxian International Airport]], and is rapidly becoming high-end residential areas with luxury apartments, fine neighbourhoods and commercial developments, as suburbs of Shenyang are growing steadily.  The district is traversed by two corridors along two major highways, one leading to the Eastern Mausoleum and the neighbouring city of [[Fushun]], and the other leading to the airport.

Launched in 1988 as the Shenyang National New and High-Tech Industrial Development Zone and elevated to a national-level zone in 1991, the Hunnan New Area ({{lang|zh-hans|浑南新区}}) focuses on electronic and information technology products such as software, computers, network systems, communication equipment and audio/visual equipment; advanced manufacturing technologies, especially for automobiles, medical equipment; advanced materials and biological and pharmaceutical products. The zone has hosted more than 5,700 enterprises, including 700 foreign-invested enterprises. {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Foreign companies such as the [[General Electric Co.]], [[Tyco International]], and [[Mitsubishi Group]] operate in the zone.  Currently, the Shenyang City Government is working on expanding the city and plans to relocate its seat to the Hunnan New Area from the current site in Shenhe District. {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

====Sujiatun District====
The '''Sujiatun District''' ({{zh|s=苏家屯区|l=[[Su (surname)|Su]] family village district|labels=no}}) forms the southernmost part of the suburbs, located {{convert|15|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away from central Shenyang.  The 2014 registered population of Sujiatun is 428,859.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and it has an area of {{convert|782|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="sysinet.gov.cn"/&gt;  Sujiatun is known mostly for its agricultural and industrial activity.  It borders the districts of Yuhong and Heping to the north, Dongling to the northeast, Tiexi to the northwest; it also borders the [[prefecture-level cities]] of [[Fushun]] to the east, [[Benxi]] to the southeast, and [[Liaoyang]] to the southwest.

====Shenbei New District====
The '''Shenbei New District''' ({{zh|s=沈北新区|l=Shenyang's north new district|labels=no}}), formerly '''Xinchengzi District''' ({{zh|s=新城子区|l=new town district|labels=no}}), is a new development zone and forms the majority of the northern suburbs.  It has an area of {{convert|884|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="sysinet.gov.cn"/&gt; and a population of 320,370 (2014).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  It borders Hunnan District to the southeast, Dadong and Huanggu Districts to the south, Yuhong District to the southwest, [[Xinmin City]] and [[Faku County]] to the northwest; it also borders the prefecture-level cities of [[Tieling]] to the northeast and [[Fushun]] to the southeast.

====Yuhong District====
The '''Yuhong District''' ({{zh|s=于洪区|l=[[Yu (surname 于)|Yu]] and [[Hong (surname)|Hong]] district|labels=no}}) forms part of the northwestern and western suburbs.  It has an area of {{convert|499|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="sysinet.gov.cn"/&gt; and a population of 435,333 (2014).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  It borders Shenbei New District to the northeast, Huanggu District to the east, Tiexi District to the south, and [[Xinmin City]] to the west.  [[China Resources Beverage]], the distributor of C'estbon Water, has its Northeast regional office in the district.

The large southwestern part of the neighbouring Tiexi District also used to belong to Yuhong District, but in May 2002, the southwestern part of Yuhong District was ceded on order of the city government to establish the Shenyang Economic and Technological Development Zone, and the administration of the region was later transferred to Tiexi District instead.  This annexation of land left an [[exclave]] territory lying between Tiexi District, Heping District and Sujiatun District, separated from the main body of Yuhong District, hence making the Tiexi District flanked at the "neck" by the two parts of Yuhong.

====Liaozhong District====
The '''Liaozhong District''' ({{zh|s=辽中区|l=Liaoning's center district|labels=no}}, referring to its central location within the province) is the newest and largest suburban district.  Formerly the '''Liaozhong County''' ({{lang|zh-hans|辽中县|labels=no}}),  its rural county status was made defunct in January 2016, and formally instated as a suburban city district on April 11, 2016.  It lies {{convert|67|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} southwest of downtown Shenyang, near the intersection of G1 Beijing–Harbin Expressway and G91 Liaozhong Ring Expressway.  {{As of|2014}}, it had a population of 532,900&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; residing in an area of {{convert|1645|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="sysinet.gov.cn"/&gt;  It is the most southwestern part of Shenyang City, bordering Xinmin City to the north, and Tiexi District to the northeast, as well as the prefecture-level cities of [[Liaoyang]] to the southeast, [[Anshan]] to the south and southwest, and [[Jinzhou]] to the west.

===Satellite city===

====Xinmin City====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
The '''Xinmin City''' ({{zh|s=新民市|l=new residents city|labels=no}}), formerly '''Xinmin County''' ({{zh|s=新民县|labels=no}}) before 1993, is a [[county-level city]] and contains the westernmost part of the Greater Shenyang area, and by far the most spacious of any county-level divisions of Shenyang with an area of {{convert|3,297|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, with a registered population of 690,703 (2014).  It borders [[Faku County]] to the northeast, [[Shenbei New District|Shenbei]] and [[Yuhong District]]s to the east, [[Tiexi District, Shenyang|Tiexi District]] to the southeast, [[Liaozhong District]] to the south, the prefecture-level cities of [[Jinzhou]] to the west and [[Fuxin]] to the northwest.

Xinmin has one of the leading [[horticulture]] industries in China, especially in [[apple]]s, [[watermelon]] and [[napa cabbage|white cabbage]]s, as well as [[animal husbandry]] such as chicken and pigs.  [[Light manufacturing]] is also an important part of Xinmin's economy, with 57% of its GDP derived from food processing, pharmaceuticals and packaging products in 2012.  The city also has access to the [[Liaohe oil field]].  There are also proposals to relocated the defunct East Pagoda Airport to Xinmin for reopening.

===Rural counties===

====Faku County====
The '''Faku County''' ({{zh|s=法库县|labels=no}}) lies {{convert|77|km|mi}} north of urban Shenyang, and has an area of {{convert|2,281|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}} with a population of 447,952 (2014).  The county's name is reportedly a phonetic transliteration of the Manchu word for [[fishing weir]], due to the county's [[fishing]] resources from its extensive network of rivers, lakes and reservoirs.  The county borders the [[Kangping County]] to the north, [[Shenbei New District]] to the southeast, [[Xinmin City]] to the southwest, and the [[prefecture-level cities]] of [[Tieling]] to the east, and [[Fuxin]] to the west.  Other than agriculture, Faku County has the richest source of minerals in the Shenyang area, including the largest reserve of [[kaolinite]] and [[wollastonite]] in China.  As a result, in recent years the county has attracted a lot of foreign investment from the [[ceramic]] industry.

====Kangping County====
The '''Kangping County''' ({{zh|s=康平县|l=prosperous and peaceful county|labels=no}}) is the northernmost and most remote part of the Greater Shenyang area, and has an area of {{convert|2,167|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} with a population of 352,434 (2014).  It was historically first established in 1880 under the blessing of the [[Guangxu Emperor]], hence the name.  The county borders the [[Faku County]] to the south, the  [[prefecture-level cities]] of [[Tieling]] to the east, [[Fuxin]] to the southwest and [[Inner Mongolia]]'s [[Tongliao]] to the north.  The county is mostly agricultural, with majority of its GDP coming from crop and fruit planting.  However, in recent years the [[synthetic fabric]], [[carbon fiber]] and [[alternative energy]] industries begin to take hold in Kangping.  The county currently has the third largest [[wind farm]] in the whole province.

Shenyang is the [[railway hub]] of [[Northeast China]].  Eight railways connect Shenyang with [[Beijing]], [[Dalian]], [[Changchun]], [[Harbin]] and [[Fushun]].  The city is also served by the [[Qinhuangdao–Shenyang High-Speed Railway]], the main passenger transport corridor in and out across the [[Shanhai Pass]], and the first passenger-specific railway line in China.  In early 2007, a {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}} high-speed train decreased travel time between [[Beijing]] and Shenyang by almost three-fold to around 4 hours. The [[Harbin–Dalian High-Speed Railway]] opened in late 2012 and connects Shenyang with other major cities in Northeast China such as [[Harbin]], [[Changchun]] and [[Dalian]] at speeds of up to {{convert|300|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harbin-Dalian High-speed railway starts summer schedule|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/photo/2013-04/21/c_132327435.htm|publisher=Xinhua|accessdate=9 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001214413/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/photo/2013-04/21/c_132327435.htm|archivedate=1 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liaoning Station before 1949.jpeg|thumb|The old Liaoning General Station]]
The '''Shenyang North Railway Station''' ({{zh|s=沈阳北站|p=Shěnyáng Bĕi Zhàn}}) was formerly the '''Liaoning General Station''' ({{zh|t=遼寧總站|p=Liáoníng Zǒngzhàn|labels=no}}) before 1946, and colloquially known as the "Old North Station".  The original station building (now a [[Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level|MHCSPNL]]-listed heritage building), initially named the '''Fengtian City Station''' ({{zh|t=奉天城站|p=Fèngtīan Chéng Zhàn|labels=no}}) at the time of completion, was built in 1927 at the terminal point of [[Beijing–Harbin Railway|Jingfeng Railway]], about {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of the current station site, on the orders of warlord [[Zhang Zuolin]] to compete with the then Japanese-administered Shenyang Railway Station.  The Main Station Building ({{zh|c=主站房|labels=no}}) of the current "New North Station" began construction in 1986 and was commissioned for operation in December 1990, and became one of the five most important railway hubs in China, earning itself the nickname "'''Northeast's No. 1 Station'''" ({{zh|s=东北第一站|labels=no}}).&lt;ref name="hscb"&gt;{{cite news|author=李淑娟|authorlink=|coauthors= |script-title=zh:沈阳北站被称为"东北第一站"|url=http://news.liao1.com/epaper/hscb/html/2009-09/26/content_129031.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212043350/http://news.liao1.com/epaper/hscb/html/2009-09/26/content_129031.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-12-12|work=《华商晨报》|location=Shenyang, Liaoning |publisher=|date=2009-09-26|accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|authorlink=|coauthors= |script-title=zh:沈阳北站："京哈铁路"动脉上的心脏|url=http://news.liao1.com/newspage/2009/08/4319472.html|work=《沈阳日报》|publisher=沈阳日报传媒集团|date=2009-08-23|accessdate=2013-11-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203112158/http://news.liao1.com/newspage/2009/08/4319472.html|archivedate=2013-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, a huge expansion project known as the "North Station Transport Hub Reconstruction Project" ({{zh|s=北站交通枢纽改造工程|labels=no}}) was initiated in response to the growing demand of floor area posed by the increasing passenger traffic after introduction of the [[High-speed rail in China|high-speed rail]] service.  The station now has an additional 3-storey "Sub-Station Building" ({{zh|s=子站房|labels=no}}) and a "North Square" ({{zh|s=北广场|labels=no}}) on the northern (Huanggu District) side of the railways, while the old waiting lounge in the original 16-storey Main Station Building is now relocated to a large elevated concourse that bridges over the rail tracks, with a pillar-less roof (the largest in mainland China) doming the platforms.  The original South Square ({{zh|s=南广场|labels=no}}) outside the Main Station Building was rebuilt into a multi-levelled complex, with two above ground forming an elevated airport-style drop-off zone and a large ground-level area for bus stops, as well as a three-level underground city providing shopping malls, parking lots, taxi pick-up and interchange with [[Line 2, Shenyang Metro|Subway Line 2]], while also capable of rapid conversion into an [[air raid shelter]] if needed.

[[File:Shenyang Railway Station.jpg|thumb|Shenyang Railway Station]]
The '''Shenyang Railway Station''' ({{zh|s=沈阳站|p=Shěnyáng Zhàn}}) has a history of more than 100 years.  It was built by the Russians in 1899 on the eastern side of the [[South Manchurian Railway]] and was named the '''Fengtian Station''' ({{zh|t=奉天站|p=Fèngtiān Zhàn}}) at the time.  It was later expanded by the Japanese after the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and renamed to '''Fengtian [[Yam (route)|Yam]]''' ({{zh|t=奉天驛|p=Fèngtiān Yì}}) until the end of the [[World War II]].  Before adopting its current name, the station was known as the '''Shenyang South Railway Station''' ({{zh|t=瀋陽南站|p=Shĕnyáng Nán Zhàn}}) or simply the "South Station" (in contrast to the forementioned "North Station") between 1945 and 1950, a name the locals still use colloquially to present days (though the current [[Shenyang South Railway Station]] is actually at the suburban junction between [[Hunnan]] and [[Sujiatun]]).  Today, the station focuses on regular-speed passenger service and is being refurbished with a large archway and new terminal, reducing access to the boarding platforms by rerouting customers under and over ground while construction is completed.  The station was expanded in 2010 with the addition of a new West Station Building ({{zh|s=西站房|labels=no}}) and a West Square ({{zh|s=西广场|labels=no}}) on the western side of the railways.&lt;ref name="沈阳站西"&gt;{{cite news |author=李莉 |authorlink= |coauthors= |script-title=zh:沈阳站西出口明年底建成 西广场建设规划已敲定 |url=http://liaoning.nen.com.cn/liaoning/223/3678223.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212193719/http://liaoning.nen.com.cn/liaoning/223/3678223.shtml |archivedate=2013-12-12 |work=《沈阳日报》 |publisher=沈阳日报传媒集团 |date=2010-12-21 |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The old East Station Building ({{zh|s=东站房|labels=no}}) is currently on the provincial protected heritage list.

Since 2011, a daily direct [[rail freight transport|container rail service]] has carried automotive parts {{convert|11000|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Leipzig, Germany]] to Shenyang through [[Siberia]] with a  23-day transit time.&lt;ref name="siberia"&gt;[http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/db-schenker-to-launch-daily-freight-train-to-china.html DB Schenker to launch daily freight train to China] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621041859/http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/db-schenker-to-launch-daily-freight-train-to-china.html |date=June 21, 2012 }} ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'', 30 September 2011.

===Road===
[[File:ShenyangDistrictAndLandmark.jpg|thumb|Shenyang's districts, landmarks and major roads]]
In the [[Manchukuo]] era, the initial road transportation network was laid out, as is now in the central districts of Shenyang.  The city follows a largely [[grid plan|grid]]-style urban layout, with the roads follow a slightly northwest-to-southeast orientation due to the [[South Manchurian Railway]], which runs perpendicular to that direction.  The streets in Shenyang are almost always named according to a routine convention—one that runs more in the north-south direction is called a "street" ({{zh|s=街|p=Jīe|labels=no}}) or "avenue" ({{zh|s=大街|p=Dà Jīe|l=big street|labels=no}}), and one that runs more east-west are call a "road" ({{zh|s=路|p=Lù|labels=no}}) or "boulevard" ({{zh|s=大道|p=Dà Dào|l=big path|labels=no}}).  The only exceptions to this rule are the east-west Middle Street in [[Shenhe District]], which takes its historical name from ancient times (though its modern official name is actually the "Middle Street Road"); and the north-south Minzhu Road ({{zh|s=民主路|labels=no}}) in [[Heping District, Shenyang|Heping District]] that traverses diagonally across the [[City block#Superblock|superblock]] between the [[Shenyang Railway Station]] and the Zhongshan Park, but as one of the only three diagonal streets in the entire city it is accommodated as a "road" instead of "street" in keeping with the other two diagonal counterparts that runs east-west.

In addition to the grid streets, Shenyang also was developing several [[ring road]] systems, going back as early as the "Fengtian City Plan" ({{zh|t=奉天都邑計劃|labels=no}}) proposed by the Japanese-controlled [[puppet state|puppet]] [[Manchukuo]] government in 1932.  Outside of the (now demolished) city walls, the city initially planned three [[beltway]]s, namely the "inner ring", "middle ring" and "outer ring" roads.  Gradually with urban development, the inner ring idea faded away into the inner city grids, but the middle ring concept was retained and later transformed into the nowadays '''1st Ring Road''' ({{zh|s=一环路|labels=no}}, officially called the "Middle Ring Road" until 1995), and the outer ring morphed roughly into parts of the present day '''2nd Ring Road''' ({{zh|s=二环路|labels=no}}).  The '''3rd Ring Road''' ({{zh|s=三环路|labels=no}}) was completed in 1995, and in 2013 was upgraded into an 8-lane, {{convert|82|km|mi|abbr=on}} freeway—the G15&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; Shenyang Round City Expressway ({{zh|s=沈阳绕城高速公路|labels=no}}).  The 10-lane, {{convert|132|km|mi|abbr=on}} '''4th Ring Road''' ({{zh|s=四环路|labels=no}}) is a [[limited-access highway]] about {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} out from the 3rd Ring, completed in 2013.  The planned 6-lane, {{convert|198|km|mi|abbr=on}} '''5th Ring Road''' ({{zh|s=五环路|labels=no}}) and the proposed {{convert|399|km|mi|abbr=on}} '''6th Ring Road''' ({{zh|s=六环路|labels=no}}), also known as the [[G91 Liaozhong Ring Expressway]] ({{zh|s=辽中环线高速公路|labels=no}}), are both currently under construction.

[[File:Jingshen Expwy Jul2004.jpg|thumb|Jingshen Expressway]]
Shenyang is connected to the other regions by several major expressways in radial pattern.  The [[Shenyang–Dalian Expressway|G15 Shenda Expressway]] ({{zh|s=沈大高速公路|labels=no}}) to the southwest is the first expressway built in China and is an 8-lane, {{convert|348.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[controlled-access highway]] with a maximum speed limit of {{convert|120|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, connecting Shenyang to [[Dalian]], one of the largest port city in China.  The {{convert|222|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Shendan Expressway]] ({{zh|s=沈丹高速公路|labels=no}}) to the southeast, part of the [[G1113 Dandong–Fuxin Expressway|G11&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; Dandong–Fuxin Expressway]] that traverses Shenyang from the northwest, is a 4-lane expressway leading to [[Benxi]] and [[Dandong]], and also serves [[Shenyang Taoxian International Airport]].  The 4-lane [[G1212 Shenyang–Jilin Expressway|G12&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; Shenji Expressway]] ({{zh|s=沈吉高速公路|labels=no}}) to the east was completed in 2011, linking Shenyang to [[Jilin City|Jilin]] via [[Fushun]].  The 8-lane [[Beijing–Shenyang Expressway|Jingshen Expressway]] ({{zh|s=京沈高速公路|labels=no}}) to the west is an integral part of the extended [[G1 Jingha Expressway]] ({{zh|s=京哈高速公路|labels=no}}) beyond the northeast, and is a major interprovincial "trunk road" across the [[Shanhai Pass]] linking to the national capital [[Beijing]] some {{convert|658|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.  There are other smaller provincial-level expressways ("S routes") to other cities like [[Fushun]], [[Liaoyang]] and [[Panjin]], as well as many long-distance and express bus routes to Beijing and other large Northeastern regional centers via major national roads such as the [[China National Highways]] [[China National Highway 101|101]], [[China National Highway 102|102]], [[China National Highway 203|203]] and [[China National Highway 304|304]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7944">The concept of the '''spatial icon''', introduced by [[Aleksey Lidov|Alexei Lidov]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hodegetria of Constantinople" in the encyclopedia ''Miraculous icons in the Eastern Christian culture'', Moscow, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; plays a central role in [[hierotopy]] and is used to describe the perception of sacred spaces. Spatial icons are image-visions, that are evoked, for example, in the space of a [[temple]] or [[sanctuary]]. The spatial icon encompasses a broad range of components involved in the formation and definition of sacred spaces.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Spatial Icons. The Miraculous Performance with the Hodegetria of Constantinople" in ''Hierotopy. Creation of  Sacred Spaces in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Progress-tradition, 2006, pp. 325-372.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a consciously created spatial image that transcends the material objects involved in its formation. A variety of plastic elements, including everything from buildings to decoration, and from [[mural]]s to [[liturgy|liturgical]] artifacts, work together to form a spatial icon. Sacred [[relic]]s and iconic images often play an integral role in the creation of a comprehensive spatial image.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bogdanovich. "The Performativity of Shrines in a Byzantine Church: The Shrines of St. Demetrios" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011. pp. 275-316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Sarabianov. "Relics and Images of Saints in the Sacred Space of St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev" in ''Spatial icons.

"Interrelationships of Relics and Images in Buddhist and Christian Traditions: Comparative and Performative Aspects" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011. pp. 643-662.&lt;/ref&gt; Various dynamic and performative media also play a significant role, such as rituals and song,&lt;ref&gt;L. Evseeva, L. Kondrashkova. "Creating the Iconic Space: Text, Singing and Image in the Sixteenth Century Festive Liturgy" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 473-507.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the artistic manipulation of natural light,&lt;ref&gt;A. Godovanets. "The Icon of Light in the Architectural Space of Hagia Sophia" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A.

The Sensual Icon. Space, Ritual, and the Senses in Byzantium, Pennstate Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; From this point of view, [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Church (building)|churches]] can be seen as spatial icons in which divine image-visions, such as [[Paradise]] or [[Heavenly Jerusalem]], were incarnated in the sacred space by means of the various media employed without being directly depicted.&lt;ref&gt;M. Sokolov. "Principle of Paradise." Moscow: Progress-Tradition, 2011, Ch. 1. Earthern and Heavenly Paradise, pp. 23-88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov.

L. Kessler. "Seeing Medieval Art", Broadview Press, 2004, ch.5, Church, pp. 109-110.&lt;/ref&gt; The temples and sanctuaries of various [[religion]]s were originally conceived, designed and created as spatial icons.&lt;ref&gt;Sh. Tsuji. "Creating an Iconic Space. The Transformation of Narrative Landscape" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 627-642.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition in particular, impressive examples of spatial icons are to be found in re-creations of the Holy Land, or "New Jerusalems".&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. [http://hierotopy.ru/contents/NewJerusalems_01_Lidov_Introduction_2009_RusEng.pdf "New Jerusalems. Transferring of the Holy Land as Generative Matrix of Christian Culture"] in ''New Jerusalems. Hierotopy and iconography of sacred spaces'', ed. A.

Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 101-118.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, spatial icons were the work of specific authors; their art could be compared with that of contemporary [[film director]]s, for in both cases, there is the coordinated effort of various artists and specialists in shaping a single, comprehensive vision.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Creator of Sacred Space as a Phenomenon of Byzantine Culture" in ''L’artista a Bisanzio e nel mondo cristiano-orientale'', ed. Michele Bacci, Pisa, 2003, pp.135-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performativity, as well as various dynamic elements, is a significant feature of spatial icons.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Byzantine World and Performative Spaces" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011. pp. 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a statue or building, they are constantly in motion, changing with the movement and activity of ritual and celebration, as well as with the alteration of light, odor and the movements of those participating and inhabiting them. The Tuesday performance surrounding the [[Hodegetria#Constantinople|Hodegetria icon in Constantinople]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy: spatial icons and image-paradigms in Byzantine culture", Ch. 2. Spatial icons. The Miraculous Performance with the Hodegetria in Constantinople. Moscow: Theoria, 2009, pp. 39-70.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Donkey walk]] taking place in [[Medieval]] Moscow&lt;ref&gt;M. Flier. "The Image of the Tsar in the Muscovite Palm Sunday Ritual" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 533-562.&lt;/ref&gt; are classical examples of iconic performativity in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Christian]] tradition. In both cases, the city itself was temporarily transformed into the matrix of a spatial icon; the participants involved in these rituals were thus veritable co-creators of the sacred space along with the artists, priests and celebrants responsible for leading it. Another example of this performative element at work in spatial icons can be found in the ritual creation and destruction of the [[sand mandala]] in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition.

'''Sébastien Fath''' (born 1968 in [[Strasbourg]]) is a French professional historian and a Ph.D at the [[Sorbonne]] University. Also trained in Sociology, he is the main French specialist in the study of [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Protestantism]]. Author of sixteen books, he is a permanent researcher at the [[National Center for Scientific Research]] (CNRS). He is a full member of the GSRL (Groupe Sociétés Religions Laïcités), a research team working on religion and secularism. As a social scientist and a citizen, cross-cultural reflexion on Civil Society, Politics and Religion is his focus.

He is working in a twofold direction since 2009.
First, relationships between '''evangelicalism, immigration, interculturality and urban space'''. This includes studying the cultural reshaping of congregations in Paris through the impact of immigration, the new types of Gospel music produced between Africa and Europe, and the new Protestant landscape as it is impacted by demographic changes. 
The second direction is '''Geopolitics and Evangelicalism'''. Three topics in particular are studied:

-Sub-saharian Africa as a contact-zone between Evangelicalism and Islam,

-Protestant Francophony (French speaking Protestant networks)

-Religion &amp; society in South Sudan.

''' Taha Hussein''' (November 15, 1889 – October 28, 1973; {{IPA-arz|ˈtˤɑːhɑ ħ(e)ˈseːn|lang}}) was one of the most influential 20th-century [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] writers and intellectuals, and a figurehead for [[Al-Nahda|The Egyptian Renaissance]] and the [[modernism|modernist]] movement in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. His [[sobriquet]] was "The Dean of Arabic Literature" (Fr. ''doyen des lettres arabes'').&lt;ref name=Ghanayim1994&gt;{{cite journal

He was nominated for a [[Nobel prize in literature]] fourteen times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=4387|title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Taha Hussein was born in Izbet el Kilo, a village in the [[Minya Governorate]] in central [[Upper Egypt]]. He went to a [[kuttab]], and thereafter was admitted to [[Al-Azhar University|El Azhar University]], where he studied Religion and [[Arabic literature]]. From an early age, he was reluctant to take the traditional education to his heart. Hussein was the seventh of thirteen children, born into a lower-middle-class family. He became blind at the age of three, the result of faulty treatment by an unskilled practitioner, a condition which caused him a great deal of anguish throughout his entire life.

Hussein met and married Suzanne Bresseau (1895–1989) while attending the [[University of Montpellier]] in France. She was referred to as "sweet voice". This name came from her ability to read to him as he was trying to improve his grasp of the French language. Suzanne became his wife, best friend and the mother of his two children and was his mentor throughout his life.

Taha Hussein's children, his daughter Amina and her younger brother Moenis, were both important figures in Egypt. Amina, who died at the age of 70, was among the first Egyptian women to graduate from [[Cairo]] University. She and her brother, Moenis, translated his ''Adib'' (The Intellectual) into French. This was especially important to their father, who was an Egyptian who had moved to France and learned the language. Even more important, the character of Adib is that of a young man who, like Taha Hussein, has to deal with the cultural shock of an Egyptian studying and living in France.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Academic career==
When the secular [[Cairo University]] was founded in 1908, he was keen to be admitted, and despite being blind and poor he won a place. In 1914, he became the second graduate to receive a PhD, with a thesis on the [[sceptic]] poet and philosopher [[Abu-Alala' Al-Ma'ari]]. He went on to become a professor of Arabic literature there. In 1919, he was appointed a professor of history at [[Cairo University]]. Additionally, he was the founding [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the [[University of Alexandria]]. Although he wrote many novels and essays, in the West he is best known for his autobiography, ''Al-Ayyam'' ({{lang|ar|الايام}}, ''The Days'') which was published in English as ''An Egyptian Childhood'' (1932) and ''[[The Stream of Days]]'' (1943). However, it was his book of literary criticism ''On Pre-Islamic Poetry'' ({{lang|ar|في الشعر الجاهلي}}) of 1926 that bought him some fame in the Arab world.&lt;ref name="Taha Hussein's ordeal"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Labib Rizk|first1=Dr Yunan|title=A Diwan of contemporary life (391)|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/Archive/2001/535/chrncls.htm|accessdate=1 May 2018|work=Ahram Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, he expressed doubt about the authenticity of much early Arabic poetry, claiming it to have been falsified during ancient times due to tribal pride and rivalry between tribes. He also hinted indirectly that the [[Qur'an]] should not be taken as an objective source of history. Consequently, the book aroused the intense anger and hostility of the religious scholars at [[al-Azhar|Al Azhar]] and many other traditionalists, and he was accused of having insulted Islam. However, the public prosecutor stated that what Taha Hussein had said was the opinion of an academic researcher and no legal action was taken against him, although he lost his post at [[Cairo University]] in 1931. His book was banned but was re-published the next year with slight modifications under the title ''On Pre-Islamic Literature'' (1927).

Taha Hussein was an intellectual of the [[Egyptians#Nationalism|Egyptian Renaissance]] and a proponent of the ideology of [[Egyptian nationalism]] along with what he called [[Pharaonism]], believing that Egyptian civilization was diametrically opposed to Arab civilization, and that [[Egypt]] would only progress by reclaiming its ancient pre-Islamic roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Gershoni, I., J. Jankowski. | title=Egypt, Islam, and the Arabs | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Hussein obtained his MA from the [[University of Montpellier]], he continued his studies and received another PhD at the [[Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]]. For his doctoral dissertation, written in 1917, Hussein wrote on [[Ibn Khaldun]], a Tunisian historian, claimed by some to be the founder of sociology. Two years later, in 1919, Hussein made his way back to Egypt from France with his wife, Suzanne, and was appointed professor of history at [[Cairo University]].

In 1950, Hussein was appointed Minister of Education, and was able to put into action his motto: "Education is like the air we breathe and the water we drink." Mr. Farid Shehata was his personal secretary and his eyes and ears during this period. Without Taha Hussein and his passion to promote education, millions of Egyptians would never have become literate.

==Positions and tasks==

In 1950, he was appointed a [[Minister of Knowledge]] (Ministry of Education nowadays) in which capacity he led a call for free education and the right of everyone to be educated. Additionally, he was an advocate against the confinement of education to the rich people only. In that respect, he said, "Education is as water and air, the right of every human being". Consequently, in his hands, education became free and Egyptians started getting free education. He also transformed many of the Quranic schools into primary schools and converted a number of high schools into colleges such as the Graduate Schools of Medicine and Agriculture. He is also credited with establishing a number of new universities.

Taha Hussein held the position of [[chief editor]] of a number of newspapers and wrote innumerable articles. He was also a member of several scientific academies in [[Egypt]] and around the world.

[[File:Barmen (1870).jpg|thumb|Early industrialised region at [[Barmen]] in the [[Wupper|Wupper Valley]], 1870 - painting by [[August von Wille]]]]
'''Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution''' in Britain was centred in south [[Lancashire]] and the towns on both sides of the [[Pennines]]. In Germany it was concentrated in the [[Wuppertal|Wupper Valley]], [[Ruhr|Ruhr Region]] and Upper Silesia, in Spain it was concentrated in [[Catalonia]] while in the United States it was in [[New England]]. The four key drivers of the [[Industrial Revolution]] were [[textile manufacturing]], [[iron founding]], [[steam power]] and cheap [[Wage labour|labour]].

Before the 18th century, the manufacture of cloth was performed by individual workers, in the [[weavers' cottage|premises in which they lived]] and goods were transported around the country by [[packhorse]]s or by [[Navigation|river navigations]] and contour-following [[canal]]s that had been constructed in the early 18th century. In the mid-18th century, [[artisan]]s were inventing ways to become more productive. [[Silk]], [[wool]], and [[fustian]] fabrics were being eclipsed by [[cotton]] which became the most important textile.

Innovations in [[carding]] and [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] enabled by advances in [[cast iron]] technology resulted in the creation of larger [[spinning mule]]s and [[water frame]]s. The machinery was housed in water-powered [[Cotton mill|mill]]s on [[stream]]s. The need for more power stimulated the production of steam-powered [[beam engine]]s, and [[Stationary steam engine|rotative mill engines]] transmitting the power to [[line shaft]]s on each floor of the mill. Surplus power capacity encouraged the construction of more sophisticated [[power loom]]s working in [[weaving|weaving shed]]s. The scale of production in the [[mill town]]s round Manchester created a need for a [[commerce|commercial structure]]; for a [[Royal Exchange, Manchester|cotton exchange]] and [[Manchester cotton warehouses|warehousing]]. The technology was used in [[woollen]] and [[worsted]] mills in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] and elsewhere.

--&gt;

==Elements of the Industrial Revolution==

[[File:Mule-jenny.jpg|thumb|The only surviving example of a Spinning Mule built by the inventor Samuel Crompton]]
The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations,&lt;ref name=ca&gt;[http://industrialrevolution.sea.ca/innovations.html The Industrial Revolution – Innovations]&lt;/ref&gt; made in the second half of the 18th century:
*'''Textiles''' – [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay's]] 1733, [[Flying shuttle]] enabled cloth to be woven faster, of a greater width, and for the process to later be mechanised. [[Cotton]] [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] using [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[water frame]], James Hargreaves's [[Spinning jenny|Spinning Jenny]], and Samuel Crompton's [[Spinning mule|Spinning Mule]] (a combination of the Spinning Jenny and the Water Frame). This was patented in 1769 and so came out of patent in 1783. The end of the patent was rapidly followed by the erection of many [[cotton mill]]s. Similar technology was subsequently applied to spinning [[worsted]] [[yarn]] for various textiles and [[flax]] for [[linen]].
*'''Steam power''' – The improved [[steam engine]] invented by [[James Watt]] and patented in 1775 was initially mainly used for pumping out [[Mining|mines]], but from the 1780s was applied to power machines. This enabled rapid development of efficient semi-automated factories on a previously unimaginable scale in places where [[Hydropower|waterpower]] was not available.
*'''Iron founding''' – In the [[ironworks|Iron industry]], [[coke (fuel)|coke]] was finally applied to all stages of iron [[smelting]], replacing [[charcoal]]. This had been achieved much earlier for [[lead]] and [[copper]] as well as for producing [[pig iron]] in a [[blast furnace]], but the second stage in the production of [[wrought iron|bar iron]] depended on the use of [[potting and stamping]] (for which a [[patent]] expired in 1786) or [[Puddling (metallurgy)#Puddling furnace|puddling]] (patented by [[Henry Cort]] in 1783 and 1784).

These represent three 'leading sectors', in which there were key innovations, which allowed the economic take off by which the Industrial Revolution is usually defined. This is not to belittle many other inventions, particularly in the [[textile]] industry. Without earlier ones, such as the [[spinning jenny]] and [[flying shuttle]] in the textile industry and the smelting of pig iron with coke, these achievements might have been impossible. Later inventions such as the [[power loom]] and [[Richard Trevithick]]'s high pressure [[steam engine]] were also important in the growing industrialisation of Britain. The application of steam engines to powering [[cotton mill]]s and [[ironworks]] enabled these to be built in places that were most convenient because other resources were available, rather than where there was water to power a [[watermill]].

==Processing of cotton==
{{Cotton processing flowchart}}

Cotton is the world's most important natural fibre. In the year 2007, the global yield was 25 million tons from 35 million hectares cultivated in more than 50 countries.&lt;ref name="Majeed"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.dawn.com/2009/01/19/ebr5.htm|title= Cotton and textiles — the challenges ahead|last=Majeed|first=A|date=January 19, 2009 |publisher=Dawn-the Internet edition|accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;{{Citation|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/industry/machproc.php |title=Machine processes|work=Spinning the Web|publisher=Manchester City Council: Libraries|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry and Invention==
Before the 1760s, textile production was a [[cottage industry]] using mainly [[flax]] and [[wool]]. A typical weaving family would own one hand [[loom]], which would be operated by the man with help of a boy; the wife, girls and other women could make sufficient [[yarn]] for that loom. 

The knowledge of textile production had existed for centuries. [[Indian subcontinent|India]] had a textile industry that used [[cotton]], from which it manufactured cotton textiles. When raw cotton was exported to Europe it could be used to make [[fustian]].&lt;ref name="gupta"/&gt;

Two systems had developed for spinning: the [[Spinning wheel|simple wheel]], which used an '''intermittent''' process and the more refined, [[Saxony wheel]] which drove a differential [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] and flyer with a heck that guided the thread onto the bobbin, as a '''continuous''' process. This was satisfactory for use on hand looms, but neither of these wheels could produce enough thread for the looms after the invention by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] in 1734 of the [[flying shuttle]], which  made the loom twice as productive.

Cloth production moved away from the cottage into ''manufactories''. The first moves towards manufactories called [[cotton mill|mill]]s were made in the spinning sector. The move in the weaving sector was later. By the 1820s, all cotton, wool and worsted was spun in mills; but this yarn went to outworking weavers who continued to work in their own homes. A mill that specialised in weaving fabric was called a [[weaving shed]].

==Early Inventions==
===East India Company===
Prior to the start of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century, [[Mughal India]] was the most important manufacturing center in world trade,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Why Europe Grew Rich and Asia Did Not: Global Economic Divergence, 1600–1850 |given=Prasannan |surname=Parthasarathi |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-139-49889-0 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing about 25% of the world's industrial output,&lt;ref name="williamson"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Economics/staff/orourkek/Istanbul/JGWGEHNIndianDeind.pdf|title=India’s Deindustrialization in the 18th and 19th Centuries|author=[[Jeffrey G.

Schmidt (2015), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BqdzCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100 ''An Atlas and Survey of South Asian History'', page 100], [[Routledge]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[1650–1700 in Western European fashion|European fashion]], for example, became increasingly dependent on Mughal Indian textiles and silks. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Mughal India accounted for 95% of [[East India Company|British imports]] from [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="Prakash"&gt;[[Om Prakash (historian)|Om Prakash]], "[http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/CX3447600139/WHIC?u=seat24826&amp;xid=6b597320 Empire, Mughal]", ''History of World Trade Since 1450'', edited by John J. McCusker, vol. 1, Macmillan Reference USA, 2006, pp. 237-240, ''World History in Context'', accessed 3 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 17th century, the newly established factories of the [[East India Company]] (EIC) in [[South Asia]] started to produce finished cotton goods in quantity for the UK market. The imported [[Calico]] and [[chintz]] garments competed with, and acted as a substitute for indigenous [[wool]] and the [[linen]] produce, resulting in local weavers, spinners, dyers, shepherds and farmers petitioning their MP's and in turn the [[United Kingdom government]] for a ban on the importation, and later the sale of woven cotton goods. Which they eventually achieved via the 1700 and 1721 [[Calico Acts]]. The acts banned the importation and later the sale of finished pure cotton produce, but did not restrict the importation of raw cotton, or sale or production of [[Fustian]].

The exemption of raw cotton saw two thousand bales of cotton being imported annually, from Asia and the Americas, and forming the basis of a new indigenous industry, initially producing [[Fustian]] for the domestic market, though more importantly triggering the development of a series of mechanised spinning and weaving technologies, to process the material. This mechanised production was concentrated in new [[cotton mill]]s, which slowly expanded till by the beginning of the 1770s seven thousand bales of cotton were imported annually, and pressure was put on Parliament, by the new mill owners, to remove the prohibition on the production and sale of pure cotton cloth, as they wished to compete with the EIC imports.&lt;ref name="gupta"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Broadberry|first1=Stephen|last2=Gupta|first2=Bishnupriya|title=Cotton textiles and the great divergence: Lancashire, India and shifting competitive advantage, 1600-1850|url=http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf|website=International Institute of Social History|publisher=Department of Economics, University of Warwick|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian cotton textiles, particularly those from [[Bengal]], continued to maintain a competitive advantage up until the 19th century. In order to compete with India, Britain invested in labour-saving technical progress, while implementing [[protectionist]] policies such as bans and [[tariff]]s to restrict Indian imports.&lt;ref name="gupta"/&gt; At the same time, the EIC's [[Company rule in India|rule in India]] contributed to its [[deindustrialization]], opening up a new market for British goods,&lt;ref name="gupta"/&gt; while the capital amassed from Bengal after its [[Battle of Plassey|1757 conquest]] was used to invest in British industries such as textile manufacturing and greatly increase British wealth, contributing to Britain's Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="tong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esposito"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ray"/&gt; Britain eventually surpassed India as the world's leading cotton textile manufacturer in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="gupta"/&gt;

===Britain===
During the 18th and 19th centuries, much of the imported cotton came from slave [[plantation]]s in the [[Southern United States]]. In periods of political uncertainty in North America, during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and later [[American Civil War]], however, Britain relied more heavily on imports from the colonial Indian [[British Raj]] to feed its cotton manufacturing industry. Ports on the west coast of Britain, such as [[Liverpool]], [[Bristol]], and [[Glasgow]], became important in determining the sites of the cotton industry.

[[Lancashire]] became a centre for the nascent [[cotton industry]] because the damp climate was better for spinning the yarn. As the cotton thread was not strong enough to use as [[warp (weaving)|warp]], [[wool]] or [[linen]] or [[fustian]] had to be used. Lancashire was an existing wool centre. Likewise, [[Glasgow]] benefited from the same damp climate.

The early advances in weaving had been halted by the lack of thread. The spinning process was slow and the weavers needed more cotton and wool thread than their families could produce. In the 1760s, [[James Hargreaves]] improved thread production when he invented the [[Spinning Jenny]]. By the end of the decade, [[Richard Arkwright]] had developed the [[water frame]]. This invention had two important consequences: it improved the quality of the thread, which meant that the cotton industry was no longer dependent on wool or linen to make the warp, and it took spinning away from the artisans' homes to specific locations where fast-flowing streams could provide the water power needed to drive the larger machines. The [[Pennines|Western Pennines]] of Lancashire became the centre for the cotton industry. Not long after the invention of the water frame, [[Samuel Crompton]] combined the principles of the Spinning Jenny and the Water Frame to produce his [[Spinning Mule]]. This provided even tougher and finer cotton thread.

The textile industry was also to benefit from other developments of the period. As early as 1691, [[Thomas Savery]] had made a vacuum steam engine. His design, which was unsafe, was improved by [[Thomas Newcomen]] in 1698. In 1765, [[James Watt]] further modified Newcomen's engine to design an external condenser steam engine. Watt continued to make improvements on his design, producing a separate condenser engine in 1774 and a rotating separate condensing engine in 1781. Watt formed a partnership with a businessman called [[Matthew Boulton]], and together they manufactured steam engines which could be used by industry.

Prior to the 1780s, most of the fine quality cotton muslin in circulation in Britain had been manufactured in India. Due to advances in technique, British "mull muslin" was able to compete in quality with Indian muslin by the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Marsh, ''19th Century Embroidery Techniques'' (Guild of Master Craftsman Publications Ltd, 2008), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeline of inventions===

In 1734 in [[Bury, Lancashire]], [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] invented the [[flying shuttle]] &amp;mdash; one of the first of a series of [[invention]]s associated with the cotton industry.  The flying shuttle increased the width of cotton cloth and speed of production of a single weaver at a [[loom]].{{sfn|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=11}}  Resistance by workers to the perceived threat to jobs delayed the widespread introduction of this technology, even though the higher rate of production generated an increased demand for [[spinning (textiles)|spun]] cotton. [[File:Bradford Industrial Museum 014.jpg|thumb|Shuttles]]

In 1738, [[Lewis Paul]] (one of the community of [[Huguenot]] [[Weaver (occupation)|weavers]] that had been driven out of France in a wave of religious persecution) settled in [[Birmingham]] and with [[John Wyatt (inventor)|John Wyatt]], of that town, they patented the [[Spinning frame|Roller Spinning machine]] and the [[Cotton-spinning machinery|flyer-and-bobbin]] system, for drawing [[wool]] to a more even thickness.  Using two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds [[yarn]] could be twisted and spun quickly and efficiently.  This was later used in the first [[cotton]] spinning [[cotton mill|mill]] during the Industrial Revolution.

1742: Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by [[donkey]]; this was not profitable and was soon closed.

1743: A factory opened in [[Northampton]], fifty spindles turned on five of Paul and Wyatt's machines proving more successful than their first mill.  This operated until 1764.

1748: Lewis Paul invented the hand driven [[carding]] machine.  A coat of wire slips were placed around a card which was then wrapped around a cylinder. Lewis's invention was later developed and improved by [[Richard Arkwright]] and [[Samuel Crompton]], although this came about under great suspicion after a fire at Daniel Bourn's factory in [[Leominster]] which specifically used Paul and Wyatt's spindles.  Bourn produced a similar patent in the same year.

1758: Paul and Wyatt based in [[Birmingham]] improved their roller spinning machine and took out a second patent.  Richard Arkwright later used this as the model for his [[water frame]].

=== Start of the Revolution ===
The [[Bridgewater Canal|Duke of Bridgewater's canal]] connected Manchester to the coal fields of [[Worsley]]. It was opened in July 1761. [[Matthew Boulton]] opened the [[Soho Foundry]] engineering works in [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]], [[Birmingham]] in 1762.  These were both events that enabled [[cotton mill]] construction and the move away from home-based production.
In 1764, Thorp Mill, the first water-powered cotton mill in the world was constructed at [[Royton]], [[Lancashire]], England. It was used for carding cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Mortimer|first=John|title=Industrial Lancashire|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/journey.php?Title=NW+Cotton+towns+learning+journey&amp;step=2&amp;theme=places|year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multiple spindle spinning jenny was invented in 1764. [[James Hargreaves]] is credited as the inventor. This machine increased the thread production capacity of a single worker &amp;mdash; initially eightfold and subsequently much further.  Others&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grimshaworigin.org/WebPages/ArkCartw.htm Grimshaw] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029210715/http://www.grimshaworigin.org/WebPages/ArkCartw.htm |date=2005-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; credit the original invention to [[Thomas Highs]]. [[Industrial unrest]] forced Hargreaves to leave [[Blackburn]], but more importantly for him, his unpatented idea was exploited by others. He finally patented it in 1770.  As a result, there were over 20,000 spinning jennies in use (mainly unlicensed) by the time of his death.

[[File:Arkright's Mill - Cromford 29-04-06.jpg|thumb| Arkwright's [[Cromford Mill]].]]
[[Richard Arkwright]] first spinning mill, [[Cromford Mill]], [[Derbyshire]], was built in 1771. It contained his invention the [[water frame]]. The water frame was developed from the [[spinning frame]] that Arkwright had developed with (a different) [[John Kay (spinning frame)|John Kay]], from [[Warrington]].  The original design was again claimed by Thomas Highs: which he purposed he had [[patent]]ed in 1769.&lt;ref name=mmw&gt;[http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/icons_of_invention/technology/1750-1820/IC.005/]: Press the 'Ingenious' button and use search key '10302171' for the patent&lt;/ref&gt;  Arkwright used [[waterwheel]]s to power the textile machinery. His initial attempts at driving the frame had used horse power, but a mill needed far more power. Using a waterwheel demanded a location with a ready supply of water, hence the mill at Cromford. This mill is preserved as part of the [[Derwent Valley Mills]]  &lt;!-- in some ways it was modelled on [[Matthew Boulton]] and [[John Fothergill (merchant)|John Fothergill]]'s [[Soho Manufactory]].--&gt; Arkwright generated jobs and [[factory town|constructed accommodation]] for his workers which he moved into the area. This led to a sizeable industrial community. Arkwright protected his investment from industrial rivals and potentially disruptive workers. This model worked and he expanded his operations to other parts of the country.

[[Matthew Boulton]] partnership with Scottish engineer [[James Watt]] resulted, in 1775, in the commercial production of the more efficient [[Watt steam engine]] which used a separate condensor.

[[Samuel Crompton]] of [[Bolton]] combined elements of the spinning jenny and water frame in 1779, creating the [[spinning mule]]. This mule produced a stronger thread than the water frame could. Thus in 1780, there were two viable hand operated spinning system that could be easily adapted to run by power of water.&lt;ref name="Hills 1993 43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early mules were suitable for producing yarn for use in the manufacture of [[muslin]], and which were known as the muslin wheel or the [[Hall i' th' Wood]] (pronounced Hall-ith-wood) wheel. As with Kay and Hargreaves, Crompton was not able to exploit his invention for his own profit, and died a pauper.

In 1783 a mill was built in Manchester at Shudehill, at the highest point in the city away from the river. [[Shudehill Mill]] was powered by a 30&amp;nbsp;ft diameter waterwheel. Two storage ponds were built, and the water from one passed from one to the other turning the wheel. A steam driven pump returned the water to the higher reservoir. The steam engine was of the atmospheric type.&lt;ref name="Hills 1993 43"/&gt;  An improvement devised by Joshua Wrigley, trialled in [[Chorlton-upon-Medlock]] used two [[Thomas Savery|Savery engine]]s to supplement the [[River Medlock|river]] in driving on [[overshot waterwheel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--In 1785, the Reverend Edmund Cartwright invented the power loom. His invention was perfected over a ten year period by William Horrocks. Henry Cort replaced the early wooden machines with new machines made of iron. These new iron machines needed coal, rather than charcoal, to produce the steam to drive them.--&gt;

In 1784, [[Edmund Cartwright]] invented the [[power loom]],{{sfn|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=11}}  and produced a prototype in the following year.  His initial venture to exploit this technology failed, although his advances were recognised by others in the industry.  Others such as [[Robert Grimshaw]] (whose factory was destroyed in 1790 as part of the growing reaction against the mechanization of the industry) and Austin&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1823cotton.html Guest source]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; developed the ideas further.

In the 1790s industrialists, such as [[John Marshall (industrialist)|John Marshall]] at [[Marshall's Mill]] in Leeds, started to work on ways to apply some of the techniques which had proved so successful in cotton to other materials, such as flax.

In 1803, [[William Radcliffe]] invented the [[dressing frame]] which was [[patent]]ed under the name of [[Thomas Johnson (dressing frame)|Thomas Johnson]] which enabled power looms to operate continuously.

===Later developments===

{{for|further details of the operation and history of spinning mules|Spinning mule}}
With the Cartwright Loom, the Spinning Mule and the Boulton &amp; Watt steam engine, the pieces were in place to build a mechanised textile industry. From this point there were no new inventions, but a continuous improvement in technology as the mill-owner strove to reduce cost and improve quality. Developments in the transport infrastructure - the canals and, after 1831, the railways -  facilitated the import of raw materials and export of finished cloth.

The use of water power to drive mills was supplemented by steam driven water pumps, and then superseded completely by the [[Stationary steam engine|steam engines]]. For example, [[Samuel Greg]] joined his uncle's firm of textile merchants, and, on taking over the company in 1782, he sought out a site to establish a mill. [[Quarry Bank Mill]] was built on the [[River Bollin]] at [[Styal]] in [[Cheshire]]. It was initially powered by a [[water wheel]], but installed steam engines in 1810.{{efn|Quarry Bank Mill in Cheshire still exists as a well-preserved museum.  It illustrates how the mill owners used child labour, taking orphans from nearby [[Manchester]]; it shows working conditions and how children were housed, clothed, fed and provided with some education.  This mill also shows the transition from water power to steam power; steam engines to drive the looms being installed in 1810.}} In 1830, the average power of a mill engine was 48&amp;nbsp;hp, but Quarry Bank mill installed a new 100&amp;nbsp;hp water wheel.&lt;ref name="Hills 1993 113"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was to change in 1836, when Horrocks &amp; Nuttall, Preston took delivery of 160&amp;nbsp;hp double engine.  William Fairbairn addressed the problem of line-shafting and was responsible for improving the efficiency of the mill. In 1815 he replaced the wooden turning shafts that drove the machines at 50rpm, to wrought iron shafting working at 250&amp;nbsp;rpm, these were a third of the weight of the previous ones and absorbed less power.&lt;ref name="Hills 1993 113"/&gt; The mill operated until 1959.

====Robert's power loom====
[[File:Powerloom weaving in 1835.jpg|thumb|A Roberts loom in a weaving shed in 1835. Note the wrought iron shafting, fixed to the cast iron columns]]
In 1830, using an 1822 patent, [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]] manufactured the first loom with a [[cast iron|cast-iron]] frame, the [[Roberts Loom]].{{sfn|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=11}} In 1842 [[Howard &amp; Bullough|James Bullough and William Kenworthy]], made the [[Lancashire Loom]]. It is a semiautomatic [[power loom]]. Although it is self-acting, it has to be stopped to recharge empty shuttles. It was the mainstay of the [[Lancashire]] cotton industry for a century, when the [[Northrop Loom]] invented in 1894 with an automatic weft replenishment function gained ascendancy.

====Robert's self acting mule====
[[File:Baines 1835-Roberts' Self Acting Mule.png|thumb|Roberts self-acting mule with quadrant gearing]]
Also in 1830, Richard Roberts patented the first [[Spinning mule#Roberts' self-acting mule|self-acting mule]]. The [[Stalybridge mule spinners strike]] was in 1824, this stimulated research into the problem of applying power to the winding stroke of the mule.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Roberts, Richard (DNB00)|last=|first=|year=|publisher=|page=|wspage=|scan=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''draw'' while spinning had been assisted by power, but the ''push'' of the wind had been done manually by the spinner, the mule could be operated by semiskilled labour. Before 1830, the spinner would operate a partially powered mule with a maximum of 400 spindles after, self-acting mules with up to 1,300 spindles could be built.{{sfn|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=9}}

The savings that could be made with this technology were considerable.  A worker spinning cotton at a hand-powered spinning wheel in the 18th century would take more than 50,000 hours to spin 100&amp;nbsp;lb of cotton; by the 1790s, the same quantity could be spun in 300 hours by mule, and with a self-acting mule it could be spun by one worker in just 135 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=A Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working practices==
The nature of work changed during industrialisation from a craft production model to a factory-centric model. It was during the years 1761 to 1850 that these changes happened. Textile factories organized workers' lives much differently from craft production.  Handloom [[Weaver (occupation)|weavers]] worked at their own pace, with their own tools, and within their own cottages.  Factories set hours of work, and the machinery within them shaped the pace of work.  Factories brought workers together within one building to work on machinery that they did not own.  Factories also increased the division of labour.  They narrowed the number and scope of tasks. They included children and women within a common production process. As Manchester mill owner [[Friedrich Engels]] decried, the family structure itself was "turned upside down" as women's wages undercut men's, forcing men to "sit at home" and care for children while the wife worked long hours.&lt;ref&gt;Cora Granata and Cheryl A. Koos, Modern Europe 1750 to the Present (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2008) 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Factories flourished over manual craftsmanship because they had more efficient production output per worker, keeping prices down for the public, and they had much more consistent quality of product. &lt;!--POV Reference and copy-editing needed here-- His findings in Derby found that;--&gt; The work-discipline was forcefully instilled upon the workforce by the factory owners, and he found that the working conditions were poor, and poverty levels were at an unprecedented high. Engels was appalled, and his research in Derby played a large role in his and [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] book '[[Das Kapital]]'.
&lt;!--
Working conditions in some early British textile factories were unfavourable relative to modern standards.  Children, men, and women regularly volunteered for 68-hour work weeks.  Factories often were not well ventilated and became very hot in the summer.  Worker [[health and safety]] regulations were non-existent.
--&gt;
At times, the workers rebelled against poor wages. The first major industrial action in Scotland was that of the [[Calton weavers]] in Glasgow, who went on strike for higher wages in the summer of 1787. In the ensuing disturbances, troops were called in to keep the peace and three of the weavers were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The history of Glasgow: from the earliest period to the present time |author=George MacGregor |publisher=T. D. Morison |year=1881 |pages=371–372}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was continued unrest. In Manchester in May 1808, 15,000 protesters gathered on St George's Fields and were fired on by dragoons, with one man dying. A strike followed, but was eventually settled by a small wage increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;!-- I want a references to th 1824 mule spinners strike- but I am still searching --&gt;
In the [[1842 General Strike|general strike of 1842]], half a million workers demanded the [[Chartism|Charter]] and an end to pay cuts. Again, troops were called in to keep the peace, and the strike leaders were arrested, but some of the worker demands were met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The early [[Cotton mill|textile factories]] employed a large share of [[child labor|children]], but the share declined over time.  In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered cotton mills were described as children. [[Sir Robert Peel]], a mill owner turned reformer, promoted the 1802 [[Health and Morals of Apprentices Act]], which was intended to prevent pauper children from working more than 12 hours a day in mills. Children had started in the mills at around the age of four, working as [[mule scavenger]]s under the working machinery until they were eight, they progressed to working as [[little piecers]] which they did until they were 15. During this time they worked 14 to 16 hours a day, being beaten if they fell asleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children were sent to the mills of Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Lancashire from the [[workhouse]]s in London and other towns in the south of England. A well-documented example was that of [[Litton Mill]].  Further legislation followed. By 1835, the share of the workforce under 18 years of age in cotton mills in England and Scotland had fallen to 43%.  About half of workers in [[Manchester]] and [[Stockport]] cotton factories surveyed in 1818 and 1819 had begun work at under ten years of age.&lt;ref name="galbi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galbi|first=Douglas|date=1997|title=Child Labor and the Division of Labor in the Early English Cotton Mills|journal=Journal of Population Economics |volume=10|issue=4|pages=357–75|url=http://www.galbithink.org/child.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Most of the adult workers in cotton factories in mid-19th-century Britain were workers who had begun work as child labourers.  The growth of this experienced adult factory workforce helps to account for the shift away from child labour in textile factories.

==A representative early spinning mill 1771==
[[File:Arkwright Mill entrance - geograph.org.uk - 351665.jpg|right|thumb|Gateway to Arkwright's Mill]]
[[Cromford Mill]] was an early Arkwright mill and was the model for future mills. The site at Cromford had year-round supply of warm water from the [[sough]] which drained water from nearby [[lead]] mines, together with another brook. It was a five-storey mill. Starting in 1772, the mills ran day and night with two 12-hour shifts.

It started with 200 workers, more than the locality could provide so Arkwright built housing for them nearby, one of the first manufacturers to do so. Most of the employees were women and children, the youngest being only 7 years old. Later, the minimum age was raised to 10 and the children were given 6 hours of education a week, so that they could do the record keeping their illiterate parents could not.

The first stage of the spinning process is carding, initially this was done by hand, but in 1775 he took out a second patent for a water-powered carding machine and this led to increased output. He was soon building further mills on this site and eventually employed 1,000 workers at Cromford. By the time of his death in 1792, he was the wealthiest untitled person in Britain.&lt;ref name="Thornber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thornber.net/cheshire/ideasmen/arkwright.html|title=RICHARD ARKWRIGHT (1732-1792)|last=Thornber|first=Craig|work=Cheshire Antiquities|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The gate to Cromford Mill was shut at precisely 6am and 6pm every day and any worker who failed to get through it not only lost a day's pay but was fined another day's pay. In 1779, Arkwright installed a cannon, loaded with grapeshot, just inside the factory gate,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/arkwright03.htm Cotton Times website]&lt;/ref&gt; as a warning to would-be rioting textile workers, who had burned down another of his mills in Birkacre, Lancashire.  The cannon was never used.

The mill structure is classified as a [[Grade I listed building]], it was first classified in June 1950.&lt;ref name = "NHLE"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1248010|desc= Cromford Mill |access-date= 1 February 2014 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- More research needed--&gt;

==A representative mid-century spinning mill 1840==

[[Brunswick Mill, Ancoats]] is a cotton spinning mill in Ancoats, Manchester, Greater Manchester. It was built around 1840, part of a group of mills built along the [[Ashton Canal]], and at that time it was one of the country's largest mills. It was built round a quadrangle, a seven-storey block faced the canal.{{sfn|Williams|Farnie|1992|pp=154–156}} It was taken over by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in the 1930s and passed to Courtaulds in 1964. Production finished in 1967.

The Brunswick mill was built around 1840 in one phase.{{sfn|Williams|Farnie|1992|pp=154–156}} The main seven storey block that faces the Ashton Canal was used for spinning. The preparation was done on the second floor and the self-acting mules with 400 spindles were arranged transversely on the floors above. The wings contained the blowing rooms, some spinning and ancillary processes like winding. The four storey range facing Bradford Road was used for warehousing and offices. The mill was built by [[David Bellhouse]], but it is suspected that [[William Fairbairn]] was involved in the design. It is built from brick, and has slate roofs. Fireproof internal construction was now standard. Brunswick was built using cast iron columns and beams, each floor was vaulted with transverse brick arches.&lt;ref name = "NHLE1197807"/&gt; There was no wood in the structure. It was powered by a large double beam engine.{{sfn|Williams|Farnie|1992|pp=154–156}}

In 1850 the mill had some 276 carding machines, and 77,000 mule spindles,&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/wiki/Brunswick_Mill|title=Graces guides, Brunswick Mill|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20 drawing frames, fifty slubbing frames and eighty one roving frames.&lt;ref name="Manchester"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parkinson-Bailey|first=John|title=Manchester: An architectural history.|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7190-5606-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ush5WC9BM_gC|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure was good and it successfully converted to ring spinning in 1920- and was the first mill to adopt mains electricity as its principal source of power. The mill structure was classified as a [[Grade II listed building]] in June 1994.&lt;ref name = "NHLE1197807"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1197807|desc= Brunswick Mill |access-date= 12 May 2014 |mode=cs2 |fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Export of technology==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Warez]] --&gt;
While profiting from expertise arriving from overseas (e.g. [[Lewis Paul]]), Britain was very [[protectionism|protective]] of home-grown technology.  In particular, [[engineering|engineers]] with skills in constructing the textile mills and machinery were not permitted to [[emigration|emigrate]] &amp;mdash; particularly to the fledgeling [[Thirteen Colonies|America]].

;Horse power (1780–1790)
The earliest cotton mills in the [[United States]] were horse-powered. The first mill to use this method was the [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]], built in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]]. It was started on 18 August 1788 by entrepreneur [[Cabot family|John Cabot]] and brothers. It was operated in joint by Moses Brown, [[Israel Thorndike]], Joshua Fisher, Henry Higginson, and Deborah Higginson Cabot. The [[Salem Mercury]] reported that in April 1788 the equipment for the mill was complete, consisting of a spinning jenny, a carding machine, warping machine, and other tools. That same year the mill's location was finalized and built in the rural outsets of North Beverly. The location had the presence of natural water, but it was cited the water was used for upkeep of the horses and cleaning of equipment, and not for mass-production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalindex.com/nsbol/1municip/beverly/his_cott.htm Beverly Community History Cotton Mill], www.globalindex.com. URL accessed January 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Worcester (Mass.) Spy. August 31, 1897, Wednesday. Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the internal designs of the Beverly mill were hidden due to concerns of competitors stealing designs. The beginning efforts were all researched behind closed doors, even to the point that the owners of the mill set up milling equipment on their estates to experiment with the process. There were no published articles describing exactly how their process worked in detail. Additionally, the mill's horse-powered technology was quickly dwarfed by new water-powered methods.&lt;ref&gt;The Beverly Cotton Manufactory: Or some new light on an early cotton mill.

;Slater
Following the creation of the United States, an engineer who had worked as an apprentice to Arkwright's partner [[Jedediah Strutt]] evaded the ban.  In 1789, [[Samuel Slater]] took his skills in designing and constructing factories to [[New England]], and he was soon engaged in reproducing the textile mills that helped America with its own industrial revolution.

Local inventions spurred this on, and in 1793 [[Eli Whitney]] invented and patented the [[cotton gin]], which sped up the processing of raw cotton by over 50 times.

&lt;!--  An [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]] farmer by the name of Richard Mowry successfully built and marketed the equipment needed to manufacture woolen, linen or cotton cloth. &lt;ref name="national"&gt;{{cite web|title="Blackstone River Valley, New England's Historic National Park area; Naviagator/Uxbridge"|publisher=Blackstonevalley.com|url=

The first use of power looms in wool manufacture in America was at the Capron Mill in Uxbridge.&lt;ref name="walking"/&gt; The original mill was built in 1820, by John Capron, the father of Colonel [[John Capron]], on the [[Mumford River]] at Uxbridge Center.&lt;ref name = "walking"&gt;{{cite web |title= Walking tours - Uxbridge |publisher= Blackstone Daily |url= http://www.blackstonedaily.com/Outdoors&amp;Nature/WTuxbridge.htm |accessdate= 2007-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="address"&gt;{{cite book|last= Chapin |first= Judge Henry|authorlink=|title="Address Delivered at the Unitarian Church in Uxbridge, 1864"|page= 165|publisher=Charles Hamilton Press (Harvard Library; from Google Books)|date= 1881|location=Worcester, MA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ua-pgcKRY2QC&amp;pg=RA1-

The first American manufacture of wool satinets also occurred at Capron Mill.

'''Theodore Cardwell Barker''' (19 July 1923 – 22 November 2001), usually known as '''Theo Barker''', was a British social and economic historian.

==Life==
Barker was born in [[St Helens, Lancashire]], England on 19 July 1923.  After schooling in the area, he studied at the [[University of Oxford]], obtaining a first-class degree in [[Modern History]] from [[Jesus College, Oxford]] in 1948.  He obtained a doctorate from the [[University of Manchester]] in 1951, on the 19th century history of St Helens.  This led to his first book, co-written with a school contemporary, John Harris, who had been researching St Helens in the 18th century.  ''A Merseyside Town in the Industrial Revolution'' (1954) was influential in the emerging field of urban history.  After teaching at the [[University of Aberdeen]] for 1 year, Barker taught at the [[London School of Economics]] between 1953 and 1964, when he became Professor of Economic and Social History at the newly established [[University of Kent]].  In 1976, he returned to the LSE and retired in 1983.  He died on 22 November 2001.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/dec/05/guardianobituaries.socialsciences | title=Obituary: Theo Barker|work=[[The Guardian]]|date= 5 December 2001|last=Thompson|first=F. M. L.|accessdate=30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
His work on the history of St Helens led to his researching the history of [[Pilkington Glass]], which was based in the town.  He published ''Pilkington Brothers And The Glass Industry'' in 1960.  He was also interested in transport history, co-authoring ''A History Of London Transport: The 19th Century'' (1963), and contributing extensively to the 1974 volume about the 20th century.  This interest led to him becoming chairman of the Transport History Research Trust.  Other writings on related topics included ''The Transport Contractors Of Rye'' (1982) and ''The Rise And Rise of Road Transport, 1600–1990'' (1993).  He wrote histories of the [[Worshipful Company of Carpenters]] and [[Worshipful Company of Pewterers]] in 1968 and 1974 respectively.  He served as president of the Railway and Canal Historical Society, as founding chairman of the Oral History Society and as secretary and then chairman of the British National Committee of Historians.  He was not, however (despite his wishes), elected as a [[Fellow of the British Academy]].&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;
