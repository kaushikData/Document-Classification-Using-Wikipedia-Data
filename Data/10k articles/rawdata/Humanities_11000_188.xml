      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19835">The World Monuments Watch is a flagship advocacy program of the [[New York City|New York]]-based private [[non-profit organization]] [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) and [[American Express]] to call to action and challenge government authorities responsible for important cultural resources to identify sites immediately at risk, and to stimulate public awareness of the tremendous need to [[Historic preservation|preserve]] and create sustainable uses for significant [[cultural heritage|heritage made by man]].&lt;ref name=1998_press_release&gt;{{cite web | title = Palpung named to list of endangered monuments | date=September 1997 | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url = http://www.asianart.com/cers/palpung/palpwmw.html|accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1998_official&gt;{{cite web | title = 1998 World Monuments Watch | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url = http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_Catalog_1998.pdf|accessdate=8 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection process==
Every two years, the program publishes a select list known as the Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites that is in urgent need of preservation funding and protection. The sites are nominated by public authorities, local preservation groups, and qualified individuals.&lt;ref name=1998_official /&gt; An independent panel of international experts then select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the site's overall significance, the urgency of its situation, the viability of action plans to save it, and the ability of a local constituency to sustainably maintain the site in the future with the means to do so.&lt;ref name=1998_press_release /&gt; WMF and American Express award grants to sites included on the Watch List. In addition, the leverage from the listing spurs government agencies and local donors to allocate funds and take an active role in protecting the cultural landmark.&lt;ref name=1998_official /&gt;

==1998 Watch List==
The 1998 World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites was launched on September 8, 1997, by WMF President [[Bonnie Burnham]].&lt;ref name=1998_official /&gt;

'''Alice Gorman''' (born 1964) FSA is an Australian archaeologist, heritage consultant, and lecturer, who is best known for pioneering work in the field of [[space archaeology]] and her Space Age Archaeology blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://zoharesque.blogspot.com.au/ |title=Space Age Archaeology |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based at [[Flinders University]], she is an expert in Indigenous stone tool analysis, but better known for her research into the archaeology of orbital debris, terrestrial launch sites, and satellite tracking stations.&lt;ref&gt;Dovey, Ceridwen, ''[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/dr-space-junk-unearths-the-cultural-landscape-of-the-cosmos Dr. Space Junk Unearths the Cultural Landscape of the Cosmos]'', The New Yorker, 1 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Gorman teaches modern material culture studies, cultural heritage management,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.flinders.edu.au/people/alice.gorman |title=Alice Gorman |website=www.flinders.edu.au |language=en |access-date=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian stone tools.  Dr. Gorman is also a founding member of the Archaeology, Science and Heritage Council of [[For All Moonkind, Inc.]], a nonprofit organisation developing and seeking to implement an international convention to protect human cultural heritage in outer space.

== Traditional archaeology ==

Gorman graduated from [[Melbourne University|The University of Melbourne]] in 1986 with a B.A. (Hons) before working as an archaeological consultant in the Indigenous heritage management sector. She returned to study in the late 1990s and obtained a Ph.D. from [[The University of New England]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.flinders.edu.au/people/alice.gorman |title=Alice Gorman Flinders University Biography |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her doctoral thesis examined how archaeologists can identify tools used in body modification through wear and residue analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Gorman, A. C., 2001, The archaeology of body modification. Identifying symbolic behaviour through use-wear and residues on flaked stone tools. Unpublished doctoral thesis, Division of Archaeology and Palaeoanthropology, School of Human and Environmental Studies, University of New England, Armidale.&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation, she continued working as a heritage consultant until receiving a permanent academic position at Flinders University in 2005. Gorman continues to work in the Indigenous heritage management sector on short-term contracts.

== Space archaeology ==

From an early age, Gorman wanted to be both an astrophysicist and an archaeologist. While she ended up pursuing a career in archaeology, she has reconciled the two by turning her research focus onto the archaeology of space exploration, or simply, [[space archaeology]] (for the use of satellite imagery to examine archaeological sites and landscapes, see [[Remote sensing (archaeology)|remote sensing]]). In 2003, she took part in the first conference session on space archaeology at the Fifth World Archaeological Congress with John Campbell and Beth Laura O'Leary.

Since the mid-2000s, she has produced a number of publications on space archaeology and is credited for pioneering the concept of space as a cultural landscape and the application of cultural significance assessment to "space junk". She has also considered the contribution of Indigenous people to global space exploration and the archaeological signatures of this interaction.

Gorman's space archaeology research includes the oldest satellite still in orbit, Vanguard 1, the Woomera and Kourou terrestrial launch sites, and the Orroral Valley NASA Tracking Station. In 2013, Gorman received recognition for her work on the archaeology of space when she was invited to present at [[TED (conference)|TEDx Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Space archaeology {{!}} Alice Gorman {{!}} TEDxSydney|date=9 May 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5fn-iycWBs|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorman is a member of the faculty of the [[International Space University]], an assessor for the [[Australian Research Council]], and a member of numerous space and archaeology organisations. She writes regularly for [[The Conversation (website)|''The Conversation'']], where she details much of her space archaeology research for a general audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://theconversation.com/profiles/alice-gorman-4234 |title='The Conversation' Author Profile: Alice Gorman |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has been included in the 2013 Science Online anthology and the collection of Best Australian Science Writing from 2013 to 2017.  

== Awards and Recognition ==
In 2016, Gorman was elected as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sal.org.uk/about-us/fellows-directory/?fs=gorman&amp;page=1 |title=Fellows Directory - Society of Antiquaries |website=www.sal.org.uk |language=en |access-date=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 she was awarded the Bragg UNSW Press Prize for Science Writing for her essay "Trace fossils: The silence of Ediacara, the shadow of uranium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsouthpublishing.com/scienceprize |title=The Bragg UNSW Press Prize for Science Writing |publisher=Newsouth Publishing |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Book collection.jpg|250px|thumb|Some inexpensive collectible books: these are, left to right, by [[John Tyndall|Tyndall]], [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Collingwood]], [[Henry Martyn Field (minister)|H. M. Field]], [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|Bryce]], [[Virginia Woolf|Woolf]], and [[Isaac Asimov|Asimov]] ]]
'''Book collecting''' is the [[collecting]] of [[book]]s, including seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining whatever books are of interest to a given collector. The love of books is ''bibliophilia'', and someone who loves to read, admire, and collect books is called a ''[[Bibliophily|bibliophile]]''.

Book collecting can be easy and inexpensive: there are millions of new and used books, and thousands of [[bookstore]]s, including online booksellers such as [[Abebooks]], [[Alibris]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and [[Biblio.com]]. Wealthy book collectors pursue great rarities such as the [[Gutenberg Bible]], and Shakespeare's [[First Folio]], books which are both famous and extremely valuable. Collectors of lesser means may collect works by a favorite author, [[first edition]]s of modern authors, or books on a given subject. Book prices generally depend on the demand for a given edition, the number of copies available, and a book's condition. Some collectors join associations such as The Fine Press Book Association, which is aimed at collectors of modern [[Fine press|fine printing]]. The [[Private Libraries Association]] also covers modern fine printing, but is much more general in its outlook.

==History of book collecting==
In the ancient world, ''papyri'' and scrolls (the precursors of the book in [[codex]] form) were collected by both institutions and private individuals. In surviving accounts there are references to bibliophile book collectors in that era. [[Socrates]] was reported by the historian [[Xenophon]] to have criticized a rich young man seeking to outdo his friends by collecting the works of famous poets and philosophers. [[Seneca the Younger]] deplored ostentatious book collecting, asking: "What is the use of possessing numberless books and libraries, whose titles their owner can hardly read through in a lifetime?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], Aubrey Stewart, tr., ''[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Of_Peace_of_Mind Of Peace of Mind]'', London: George Bell and Sons, 1900 (Bohn's Classical Library Edition), Book X ; republished on en.wikisource.org. Retrieved 14 November 2017. ''Of Peace of Mind'' is a translation of Seneca's ''[[De Tranquillitate Animi]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1344 the English bishop [[Richard de Bury]] wrote [[The Philobiblon]] in which he praised the love and appreciation of books.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, S. S. (1986). ''Richard D'Aungerville de Bury, 1287-1345 (England, Bishop of Durham)''. Emory University. ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip the Good]] brought together a collection of "about six hundred manuscripts in his possession at the height of his reign",&lt;ref&gt;Leah Dobrinska, [https://blog.bookstellyouwhy.com/philip-the-good-early-book-collector-and-patron-of-the-arts  Philip the Good: Early Book Collector, Patron of the Arts], bookstellyouwhy.com. Retrieved 15 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; which was the largest private collection of his day.

With the advent of the [[printing press]] invented by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the 15th century, which resulted in cheaper and more abundant books, and with the contemporaneous economic, social and political changes of the [[Renaissance]], book collecting received a great impetus. [[Jean Grolier de ServiÃ¨res|Jean Grolier]], the Treasurer-General of France, was an important bibliophile and book collector of this period.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Austin, [https://www.oakknoll.com/resources/bookexcerpts/106587.pdf ''The Library of Jean Grolier: A Preliminary Catalogue''], New York: The Grolier Club, 1971, pp. 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Grolier owned a library of 3,000 volumes and was known for his love of the Latin classics and of richly decorated bookbindings. He was a patron of the [[Aldine Press]] that had been founded by the prominent Renaissance printer, typographer, editor and publisher, [[Aldus Manutius the Elder]].

During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] many [[monastic]] libraries were broken up, and their contents often destroyed. There was an English [[antiquarian]] reaction to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII's]] [[dissolution of the monasteries]]. The commissioners of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] plundered and stripped [[university]], [[college]], and [[monastic]] libraries; so to save books from being destroyed, those who could, such as [[Matthew Parker|Archbishop Matthew Parker]] and [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Cotton]], began to collect them.

By the late 17th century, millions of printed books were in circulation and auctions devoted to books began to occur and printed catalogues devoted to books began to be issued by book dealers and by auction houses in Europe and America,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Norman, [http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=2921 The First Book Catalogue Published in America (1693)], historyofinformation.com. Retrieved on 26 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a growing popularity of book collecting with the increasingly literate public.

With the advent of the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]] in the 18th century and its focus on the past, book collectors began to show an interest in old books, antiquarian editions and manuscripts. This new emphasis was nourished by the flood of old books onto the market following the dissolution of monastic and aristocratic libraries during the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Owen Chadwick, "The Acton Library", in: Peter Fox, ed., ''Cambridge University Library: The Great Collections'', Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Whig politician [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|George John, 2nd Earl Spencer]] (1758-1834) collected tens of thousands of volumes. Strengths of his collection included first editions of the classics; works produced by important early presses, and notably an almost complete collection of [[Aldine Press|Aldine editions]]; and many Bibles.&lt;ref&gt;William Younger Fletcher, [https://archive.org/details/englishbookcolle00fletiala ''English Book Collectors''], London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner and Company, 1902 (The English Bookman's Library), pp. 309-312.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812 he founded the bibliophilic [[Roxburghe Club]].

[[Thomas Phillipps|Sir Thomas Phillipps]] (1792-1872) collected 40,000 printed books and 60,000 manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Phillipps,_Thomas_(DNB00) Phillipps, Thomas (DNB00)], [[Dictionary of National Biography]], 1885-1900, Volume 45. Retrieved 12 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He was "the greatest collector of manuscript material the world has ever known".&lt;ref&gt;Seymour de Ricci, [https://archive.org/details/englishcollector00ricc ''English Collectors of Books &amp; Manuscripts (1530-1930) and Their Marks of Ownership. The Sandars Lectures 1929-1930''], Cambridge University Press, 1930; reprinted Indiana University Press, 1960, p. 119. Retrieved 13 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; His zealous collecting efforts, which were termed [[bibliomania]] by [[Thomas Frognall Dibdin]], resulted in the preservation of much historical material, particularly manuscripts, that would otherwise have been destroyed.

The increasingly wealthy United States during the 19th century saw the appearance of "titan" book collectors such as the railroad magnate [[Henry E. Huntington|Henry Huntington]] and the financier and banker [[J. Pierpont Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Ferguson, [https://blogs.princeton.edu/rarebooks/2008/03/collecting-in-19th-century-ame/ Collecting in 19th Century America], princeton.edu. Retrieved 13 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genres, themes, and interests==
{{Prose|section|date=December 2009}}
There are millions of books, so collectors necessarily specialize in one or more [[genre]]s or subgenres of [[literature]]. A reader of [[fiction]], who enjoys [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], might decide to collect [[first edition]]s of [[Zane Grey]]'s [[novel]]s. A lover of modern [[English poetry]] might collect the works of [[W H Auden]]. A Californian who prefers [[non-fiction]] might look for books about the [[history]] of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

Individual interests may include:

* A particular [[author]] or [[genre]] or [[field of study]] (science, medicine, history, etc.)
* A particular [[illustrator]]
* [[List of literary awards|Award]] winning books

==Prices==
Book prices generally depend on the demand for a given book, the number of copies available for purchase, and the condition of a given copy. As with other collectibles, prices rise and fall with the popularity of a given author, title, or subject.

Because of the huge number of books for sale, there is no single comprehensive price guide for collectible books. The prices of the copies listed for sale at the online bookseller sites provide some indication of their current market values.

==Condition==
{{Further|List of used book conditions}}
As with other collectibles, the value of a book ultimately depends on its physical condition.
Years of handling, moving, and storage take their toll on the [[dust jacket]], cover, pages, and binding. Books are subject to damage from sunlight, moisture, and insects. Acid from the papermaking process can cause the pages to develop brown spots, called ''[[foxing]]''; gradually turn brown, called ''tanning''; and ultimately crumble.

Common defects include general wear; jacket/cover edge wear, scratches, and tears; the previous owner's written name, [[Bookplate]], or label; soil and stains; [[Dog ears|dogear]]ed pages; underlining, highlighting, and marginalia; water damage; torn hinges, endpapers and pages; and pages, illustrations, or whole [[Bookbinding#Terms and techniques|signatures]] free of the binding, or missing entirely.

A book in good condition should be a rectangular solid when at rest, whether upright or on its back, with the covers at right angles to the spine. If a book is out of square, usually from resting crooked on a shelf, or leans to the right or left when on its back, it is ''cocked'', or ''shelf-cocked''. If the covers bend in or flare out, usually from rapid humidity changes, a book is ''bowed'' (bent like a drawn bow). Thick hardbound books also tend to have their pages sag downward in the middle even if they are sitting level on a shelf.

==Sources==
New books are readily available from [[bookstore]]s and online. Many bookstores specialize in out-of-print, used, antiquarian, rare and collectible books. Online booksellers, including [[Abebooks]], [[Alibris]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and [[Biblio.com|Biblio]], encourage other stores and individuals to sell books through their websites, and charge a commission.

Antique and collectible stores may have a few books for sale. Major auction houses sell quality collectible books, and local auction houses may sell books by the carton. Thrift shops and second-hand stores commonly have book sections. Other sources include estate, yard, garage, or rummage sales; and charity fund-raisers.

==Antiquarian book collecting==
Antiquarian book collecting may be roughly defined as an interest in books printed prior to 1900 and can encompass interest in 19th, 18th, 17th, 16th, and 15th-century books. Antiquarian book collectors are not exclusively interested in [[first edition]]s and first printings, although they can be. European books created before 1455 are all hand-written and are therefore one-of-a-kind historical artifacts in which the idea of "edition" and "printing" is irrelevant. There is also an interest among antiquarians for books beautifully made with fine bindings and high quality paper. For many books printed before about 1770, the first edition is not always obtainable, either because of price and/or availability. Later editions/printings from an era of interest are still often desirable to the antiquarian collector as they are also artifacts.

[[File:ParadiseLost1720Ed.jpg|thumb|right|The beginning of [[Paradise Lost]] from a 1720 illustrated edition. Not a first edition but desirable among antiquarians.]] For example, a first edition of [[Paradise Lost]] (1667) by [[John Milton]] can fetch equivalent to a down payment on a house. However, the first illustrated folio edition of 1688, technically a later edition, is worth a fraction of the first edition, but still fetches in the thousands of dollars as an illustrated book from the era in which Milton lived.

There were many editions of [[Alexander Pope]]'s translation of [[The Iliad]] and [[The Odyssey]]. The first edition of 1715-1720 is worth a small fortune whereas slightly later 18th-century editions are a lot less expensive but still garner premium prices. The [[John Ogilby]] 17th-century translations of [[Homer]]'s [[The Iliad]] and [[The Odyssey]] garner hefty prices, but not as much as the first edition of the Pope translation. This may be in part due to a significant number of copies of Ogilby's first edition probably perished in the [[Great Fire of London]] of 1666.

The first English movable-type printer was [[William Caxton|Caxton]] in the late 15th century. Editions of his books from the 15th century are very rare. 
Occasionally, 16th-century editions similar to Caxton's books appear among antiquarian book dealers and auctions, often fetching very high prices. The last Shakespeare First Folio of 1623 (first edition of the collected works of [[William Shakespeare]]) garnered a record-breaking 5.5 million in 2006. Later 17th-century folios of [[William Shakespeare]]'s works can still fetch about the price of a small house but are more readily available and relatively obtainable, whereas almost all extant copies of the First Folio are owned by libraries, museums or universities and thus are unlikely to appear on the market. For the antiquarian collector, how a particular book's production fits into a larger historical context can be as important as the edition, even if it may not be a first edition.

Also of interest are books previously owned by famous persons, or personages of high stature, such as someone from royalty or the nobility. Tracing the history of an antiquarian book's possession history, referred to as "[[provenance]]", can markedly affect the value of a copy, even if it is not desirable ''per se''. For example, a copy of a less-important 18th-century book known to have been owned by [[Voltaire]] would achieve a value many times its stand-alone market value, simply because it was once in Voltaire's possession. Previous owners of books often signed their copies or labelled them with [[Bookplate]]s, and it is often not difficult to identify a prominent previous owner if the provenance is well documented. Books owned by well-known individuals that also have a connection with the author (often as a gift from the author with a written dedication to the recipient) are known as [[Association copy|Association copies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abebooks.co.uk/books/RareBooks/author-signature-signed-inscribed/association-copies.shtml | title=Association Copies | publisher=AbeBooks Inc. | accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The American School Library]] is an example of a very rare multi-volume boxed set with works by many popular or famous authors. Apparently the only extant full set is owned by the [[Smithsonian Institution's]] [[National Museum of American History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The American School Library|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_American_School_Library.html?id=DtQOHQAACAAJ|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|accessdate=7 November 2017|language=en|date=1839}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamel]|first1=Michael Olmert ; [introduction by Christopher de|title=The Smithsonian book of books|date=1992|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-89599-030-X|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book collecting in China==
The history of book collecting in [[China]] dates back over two millennia. An important effort to collect books in China was made during the early [[Han Dynasty]] by the government, as many important books were [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|burned]] during the [[Qin Dynasty]]. From then on, book collecting began to flourish in China, particularly after the invention of [[block printing]] during the early [[Tang Dynasty]], with both imperial and private collections blooming throughout the country. However, the systematic study of book collecting began only during the [[Qing Dynasty]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Terminology===
*Cangshulou ({{zh|èæ¸æ¨}} "book collecting tower"): [[library]], such as the private [[Tianyi Chamber]] (å¤©ä¸é£), the oldest existing library in China, or the imperial [[Wenyuan Chamber]] (ææ·µé£), where the works collected in ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'' were reposited
*Jinxiangben (å·¾ç®±æ¬ "headscarf box edition"): ancient pocket edition
*Jiupingzhuang (èå¹³è£ "old [[paperback]]") or Jiushu (èæ¸ "old books"): old books published after 1911, when the Qing Dynasty was overthrown
*Maobianben (æ¯éæ¬ "hairy-side edition"): uncut editions
*Songben (å®æ¬ "Song edition") or Songban (å®ç "Song edition"): block printed books published during the [[Song Dynasty]], highly valued by collectors
*Xianzhuangshu (ç·è£æ¸ "thread-bound book"): thread-bound books, usually referred to those published before 1911

==Virtual book collecting==
Virtual book collecting can be described as collecting books in a digital format (virtually) on a computer or other electronic device. A bibliophile may acquire [[ebooks]] by downloading them or copying from borrowed media, such as CDs and DVDs. However, this may violate [[copyright]] law, depending on the license under which the ebook was released. Ebooks acquired from [[Project Gutenberg]] and many similar free collections cause no violation as they have gone out of copyright, have been released under a [[Creative Commons license]], or else are in the public domain.

The '''Caravaggisti''' (or the "Caravagesques") were stylistic followers of the 16th-century Italian [[Baroque]] painter [[Caravaggio]]. His influence on the new Baroque style that eventually emerged from [[Mannerism]] was profound. Caravaggio never established a workshop as most other painters did, and thus had no school to spread his techniques. Nor did he ever set out his underlying philosophical approach to art, the [[psychological fiction|psychological realism]] which can only be deduced from his surviving work. But it can be seen directly or indirectly in the work of [[Rubens]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Bernini]], and [[Rembrandt]]. Famous while he lived, Caravaggio himself was forgotten almost immediately after his death. Many of his paintings were reascribed to his followers, such as ''[[The Taking of Christ (Caravaggio)|The Taking of Christ]]'', which was attributed to the Dutch painter [[Gerrit van Honthorst]] until 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Jonathan|last=Harr|authorlink=Jonathan Harr|title=[[The Lost Painting: The Quest for a Caravaggio Masterpiece]]|publisher=Random House|year=2005|isbn=0-375-50801-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in the 20th century that his importance to the development of Western art was rediscovered. In the 1920s [[Fondazione Roberto Longhi|Roberto Longhi]] once more placed him in the European tradition: "Ribera, [[Vermeer]], La Tour and Rembrandt could never have existed without him. And the art of [[EugÃ¨ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Ãdouard Manet|Manet]] would have been utterly different".&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Longhi, quoted in Lambert, op. cit., p.15&lt;/ref&gt; The influential [[Bernard Berenson]] stated: "With the exception of [[Michelangelo]], no other Italian painter exercised so great an influence."&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Berenson, in Lambert, op. cit., p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italian==

===Rome===
At the height of his popularity in [[Rome]] during the late 1590s and early 17th century, Caravaggio's dramatic new style influenced many of his peers in the Roman art world. The first Caravaggisti included [[Mario Minniti]], [[Giovanni Baglione]] (although his Caravaggio phase was short-lived), [[Leonello Spada]] and [[Orazio Gentileschi]]. In the next generation there were [[Carlo Saraceni]], [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]] and [[Orazio Borgianni]] as well as anonymous masters such as the [[Master of the Gamblers]]. Gentileschi, despite being considerably older, was the only one of these artists to live much beyond 1620, and ended up as court painter to [[Charles I of England]]. His daughter [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] was also close to Caravaggio, and one of the most gifted of the movement. Yet in Rome and in Italy it was not Caravaggio, but the influence of [[Annibale Carracci]], blending elements from the [[High Renaissance]] and [[Lombardy|Lombard]] realism, which ultimately triumphed. Other artists active in Rome, worth mentioning, include [[Angelo Caroselli]], [[Pier Francesco Mola]], [[Tommaso Salini]] and [[Francesco Buoneri]]. [[Giacinto Brandi]] was active mainly in Rome and Naples. Dutch painter [[David de Haen]] was active in Rome between 1615 and 1622.

===Naples===
In May 1606 after the killing of Ranuccio Tomassoni, Caravaggio fled to [[Naples]] with a [[Caravaggio#Exile and death (1606â1610)|death sentence on his head]].&lt;ref name=PUGLISI&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caravaggio|year=1998|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=0-7148-3966-3|author=Catherine Puglisi}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there he completed several commissions, two major ones being the ''[[Madonna of the Rosary (Caravaggio)|Madonna of the Rosary]]'', and ''[[The Seven Works of Mercy (Caravaggio)|The Seven Works of Mercy]]''.&lt;ref name=PUGLISI/&gt; His work had a profound effect on the local artists and his brief stay in Naples produced a notable school of Neapolitan Caravaggisti, including [[Battistello Caracciolo]], [[Bernardo Cavallino]], [[Carlo Sellitto]], [[Massimo Stanzione]], [[Francesco Guarino]], [[Andrea Vaccaro]], [[Cesare Fracanzano]] and [[Antonio de Bellis]]. [[Giacinto Brandi]] was active mainly in Rome and Naples. The Caravaggisti movement there ended with a terrible outbreak of plague in 1656, but at the time Naples was a possession of Spain and the influence of Caravaggism had already spread there.

===Northern Italy===
[[Marco Antonio Bassetti]] is known to have been in Rome in 1616, and may have arrived there two years earlier. In Rome he came under the influence of the paintings of Caravaggio and Orazio Borgianni. On his return to [[Verona]] he painted a St. Peter and Saints for the church of San Tomaso and a Coronation of the Virgin for Sant' Anastasia. He died from the plague in Verona in 1630. 

[[Bernardo Strozzi]], born and mainly active in [[Genoa]] and later [[Venice]], is considered a principal founder of the Venetian Baroque style.  In the 1620s Strozzi gradually abandoned his early [[Mannerist]] style in favor of a more personal style characterized by a new naturalism derived from the work of Caravaggio and his followers. The Caravaggist style of painting had been brought to Genoa both by [[Domenico Fiasella]], after his return from Rome in 1617â18, and by followers of Caravaggio who spent time working in the city.

Italian painter [[Biagio Manzoni]] was active in [[Faenza]]. Italian painter from [[Reggio Emilia]] [[Bartolomeo Schedoni]], [[Daniele Crespi]] from [[Milan]] and [[Luca Cambiasi]], also known as Luca Cambiaso and Luca Cangiagio, the leading artist in [[Genoa]] in the 16th century, often depicted  brilliantly lit figures set against a dark background. [[Felice Boselli]], active in [[Piacenza]], used contrast Caravaggisti lighting for his still-lifes. [[Tanzio da Varallo]] (or simply il Tanzio) was active mainly in [[Lombardy]] and [[Piedmont]], including the [[Sacro Monte]] at [[Varallo Sesia]], where he worked contemporaneously with [[Pier Francesco Mazzucchelli]] (il Morazzone). The Italian painter and engraver [[Bernardino Mei]] worked in his native [[Siena]] and in Rome, finding patronage above all in the Chigi family.

===Central Italy===
[[Pietro Ricchi]] (or  il Lucchesino), born in [[Lucca]], also often depicted  brilliantly lit figures set against a dark background (see St. Sebastian).

===Sicily===
[[Mario Minniti]] was an Italian artist active in Sicily after 1606. He, at the age of 16, even posed for Caravaggio's painting [[Boy with a Basket of Fruit]].

==Dutch==
The [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] lists 128 artists labelled "Caravaggisten".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rkd.nl/rkddb/dispatcher.aspx?action=search&amp;search=school_stroming=%22Caravaggisten%22&amp;database=ChoiceArtists&amp;id=1 Caravaggisten] in the [[RKD]].&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch painter [[David de Haen]] was active in Rome between 1615 and 1622. Another artist worth mentioning is [[Paulus Bor]], who  initially painted rather Caravaggisti-like history paintings, but his works fast became marked by a classicism related to that of his townsman van Campen. [[Abraham Lambertsz van den Tempel]] is worth mentioning for his realism and contrasting lighting. Flemish born painter [[Frans Badens]] was active in Amsterdam. 

===Utrecht===
{{main|Utrecht Caravaggism}}
In the early 17th century Catholic artists from the [[Netherlands]] travelled to Rome as students and were profoundly influenced by the work of Caravaggio. On their return to the north this group, known as the [[Utrecht Caravaggism|"Utrecht Caravaggisti"]], had a short-lived but influential flowering in the 1620s among painters like [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]], [[Gerrit van Honthorst]], [[Andries Both]] and [[Dirck van Baburen]]. The brief flourishing of Utrecht Caravaggism ended around 1630, when major artists had either died, as in the case of Baburen and Terbrugghen, or had changed style, like van Honthorst's shift to [[portrait painting|portraiture]] and history scenes informed by the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish]] tendencies popularized by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and his followers. In the following generation the effects of Caravaggio, although attenuated, are to be seen in the work of [[Vermeer]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], and [[Gerrit Dou]]'s "niche paintings".

==Flemish==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Cain slaying Abel, 1608-1609.jpg|thumb|''Cain slaying Abel'', Rubens, 1608-1609]]
Rubens was likely one of the first Flemish artists to be influenced by [[Caravaggio]].  During the period 1600-1608, Rubens resided in Italy.  He settled in [[Mantua]] at the court of Duke [[Vincenzo I of Gonzaga|Vincenzo&amp;nbsp;I Gonzaga]] but also spent time in Rome. During his stay in Rome in 1601 he became acquainted with Caravaggioâs work.  He later made a copy of Caravagio's ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment of Christ]]'' and recommended his patron, the Duke of Mantua, to purchase [[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|''The Death of the Virgin'']] ([[Louvre]]).  Rubens was after his return to Antwerp instrumental in the acquisition of [[Madonna of the Rosary (Caravaggio)|''The Madonna of the Rosary'']] ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum|Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna]]) for the [[St. Paul's Church, Antwerp|St. Paul's Church]] in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Sirjacobs, Raymond. ''Antwerpen Sint-Pauluskerk: Rubens En De Mysteries Van De Rozenkrans = Rubens Et Les MystÃ¨res Du Rosaire = Rubens and the Mysteries of the Rosary'', Antwerpen: Sint-Paulusvrienden, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  During his stay in Italy Rubens broadened his interest in Caravaggioâs work to include the 1606 ''[[Supper at Emmaus (Caravaggio), Milan|Supper at Emmaus in Milan]]'' ([[Pinacoteca di Brera]]) and the 1600 ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Calling of St Matthew]]'' as well as the more recent work in the [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]] and the [[Basilica of Sant'Agostino]]. Although some of this interest in Caravaggio is reflected in his drawings during his Italian residence, it was only after his return to Antwerp in 1608 that his works show openly Caravaggesque traits such as in the ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens - Cain slaying Abel, 1608-1609.jpg|Cain slaying Abel]]'' (1608-1609) ([[Courtauld Institute of Art]]).  However, the influence of Caravaggio on Rubensâ work would be less important than that of [[Raphael]], [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]], [[Federico Barocci|Barocci]] and the Venetians.&lt;ref&gt;Gregori, Mina, Luigi Salerno, and Richard E. Spear, ''The Age of Caravaggio'', Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Artists, who were influenced by Rubens, such as [[Pieter van Mol]], [[Gaspar de Crayer]] and [[Willem Jacob Herreyns]], also used certain stark realism and strong contrasts of light and shadow, common to Caravaggisti style. 

Rubens' contemporary [[Abraham Janssens]] was another Flemish painter who travelled to Italy (from 1597 to 1602) where he became acquainted with the work of Caravaggio.  His work after his return to Antwerp shows the influence of Caravaggio.  The composition ''[[:Image:Abraham Janssens 001.jpg|Scaldis and Antwerpia]]'' of 1609 derives its expressive power from the use of strong contrasts of light and shadow ([[chiaroscuro]]) as was pioneered by Caravaggio.&lt;ref name=sca&gt;[http://www.okv.be/OKV-artikel/abraham-janssens-scaldis-en-antwerpia Roger A. d'Hulst, ''Abraham Janssens - Scaldis en Antwerpia''] at Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is mainly the Flemish artists from the generation after Rubens coming on the art scene in the 1620s who were most influenced by Caravaggio.  It can even be said that there was a Caravaggist craze in Flanders from about 1620 to 1640.&lt;ref name=rombouts&gt;[http://barokinvlaanderen.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/en/biography/theodoor-rombouts Matthias Depoorter, ''Theodoor Rombouts'' on vlaamsekunstcollectie.be]&lt;/ref&gt;  The artists are often referred to as the Ghent Caravaggisti and the Antwerp Caravaggisti after the city in which they were principally active. There is, however, no discernible stylistic distinction between these two movements other than individual ones.  Among the Ghent Caravaggisti can be listed [[Jan Janssens]], [[Melchior de la Mars]] and [[Antoon van den Heuvel]].  The list of Antwerp Caravaggisti is significantly longer reflecting the importance of this city as the pre-eminent artistic centre of Flanders.  They include [[Theodoor Rombouts]], [[Gerard Seghers]], [[Jan Cossiers]], [[Adam de Coster]] and [[Jacques de l'Ange]].

What most of these artists shared in common is that they likely visited Italy where they had first-hand contact with the work of Caravaggio or his Italian and Dutch followers.  The influence of Caravaggio and his followers on their work can be seen in the use of dramatic light effects and expressive gestures as well as the new subject matter such as card sharps, fortune tellers, the denial of St Peter, etc.&lt;ref name=rombouts/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://barokinvlaanderen.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/en/biography/jan-janssens ''Jan Janssens'' on vlaamsekunstcollectie.be]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=seghers&gt;[http://barokinvlaanderen.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/en/biography/gerard-seghers Matthias Depoorter, ''Gerard Seghers'' on vlaamsekunstcollectie.be]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the artists focused on certain aspects of Caravaggio's oeuvre.  For instance, Adam de Coster was referred to as the ''Pictor Noctium'' (painter of the nights) because of his preference for the use of stark chiaroscuro and the repeated motif of half-length figures illuminated by a candle which is covered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/old-master-paintings-n08453/lot.58.html Adam de Coster, ''The Denial of Saint Peter''] at [[Sotheby's]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these artists such as Rombouts, Cossiers and Seghers later abandoned their strict adherence to the Caravaggist style and subject matter and struck out in different directions often under the influence of the older generation of Flemish artists who had such a dominant influence on Flemish art in the 17th century, i.e. Rubens and [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyck]].&lt;ref name=rombouts/&gt;&lt;ref name=seghers/&gt;

==French==
One of the first [[France|French]] artists to studio in Rome during the Caravaggio Years was [[Jean LeClerc (painter)|Jean LeClerc]], who studied under Saraceni during the early 17th century. [[Simon Vouet]] spent an extensive period of time in Italy, from 1613 to 1627. His patrons included the [[Barberini family]], [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]], [[Paolo Giordano II Orsini|Paolo Giordano Orsini]] and [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]].&lt;ref&gt;Brejon de LavergnÃ©e, Barbara. 'Simon Vouet', ''Oxford Art Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also visited other parts of Italy: [[Venice]]; [[Bologna]], (where the [[Annibale Carracci|Carracci family]] had their academy); [[Genoa]], (where from 1620 to 1622, he worked for the [[Doria (family)|Doria princes]]); and Naples. He absorbed what he saw and distilled it in his painting: Caravaggio's dramatic lighting; Italian Mannerism; [[Paolo Veronese]]'s color and ''[[di sotto in su]]'' or foreshortened perspective; and the art of [[Annibale Carracci|Carracci]], [[Guercino]], [[Giovanni Lanfranco|Lanfranco]] and [[Guido Reni]]. Vouet's success in Rome led to his election as president of the [[Accademia di San Luca]] in 1624. Despite his success in Rome, Vouet returned to France in 1627. Vouet's new style was distinctly Italian, importing the Italian Baroque style into France. Other French artists enamored by the new style included [[Valentin de Boulogne]], who was living in Rome by 1620, and studied under Vouet and later Boulognes pupil [[Nicolas Tournier]].

[[Georges de La Tour]] is assumed to have travelled either to Italy or the Netherlands early in his career. His paintings reflect the influence of Caravaggio, but this probably reached him through the Dutch ''Caravaggisti'' and other Northern ([[List of French artists|French]] and [[List of Dutch painters|Dutch]]) contemporaries. In particular, La Tour is often compared to the Dutchman [[Hendrick Terbrugghen]].&lt;ref name="AB"&gt;Anthony Blunt, "Art and Architecture in France, 1500â1700", 1953, Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Finson]], also known as Ludovicus Finsonius, was a Flemish Baroque painter, who also worked in France.

==Spanish==
[[Francisco Ribalta]] became among the first followers in [[Spanish Golden Age|Spain]] of the [[Tenebrism|tenebrist]] style. It is unclear if he directly visited either [[Rome]] or [[Naples]], where Caravaggio's style had many adherents, although through its Naples connection Spain was probably already exposed to Caravaggisim by the early 17th century. His son [[Juan Ribalta]], [[Vicente CastellÃ³]] and [[Jusepe de Ribera]] are said to have been his pupils, although it is entirely possible that Ribera acquired his tenebrism when he moved to Italy. The style garnered a number of adherents in Spain, and was to influence the Baroque or [[Golden Age]] Spanish painters, especially [[ZurbarÃ¡n]], [[Diego VelÃ¡zquez|VelÃ¡zquez]] and [[BartolomÃ© Esteban Murillo|Murillo]]. Even the art of still life in Spain, the [[bodegÃ³n]] was often painted in a similar stark and austere style. [[Orazio Borgianni]] signed a petition to begin an Italianate academy of painting in Spain and executed a series of nine paintings for the Convento de Portacoeli, Valladolid, where they remain. [[Giovanni Battista Crescenzi]] was an Italian painter and architect of the early-Baroque period, active in Rome and Spain, where he helped decorate the pantheon of the Spanish kings at El Escorial. He rose to prominence as an artist during the reign of Pope Paul V, but by 1617 had moved to Madrid, and from 1620 on, he was active in El Escorial. Philip III of Spain awarded him the title of Marchese de la Torre, Knight of Santiago. His pupil [[Bartolomeo Cavarozzi]] was active in Spain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4167">'''Communicative competence''' is a term in [[linguistics]] which refers to a language user's grammatical  knowledge of [[syntax]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[phonology]] and the like, as well as social knowledge about how and when to use utterances appropriately.

The term was coined by [[Dell Hymes]] in 1966,{{sfn|Hymes|1966}} reacting against the perceived inadequacy of [[Noam Chomsky]]'s (1965) distinction between ''[[linguistic competence]]'' and ''[[Linguistic performance|performance]]''.{{sfn|Chomsky|1965}} To address Chomsky's abstract notion of competence, Hymes undertook [[ethnographic]] exploration of communicative competence that included "communicative form and function in integral relation to each other".{{sfn|Leung|2005}} The approach pioneered by Hymes is now known as the [[ethnography of communication]].

The notion of communicative competence is one of the theories that underlies the [[Communicative language teaching|communicative approach]] to foreign language teaching.{{sfn|Leung|2005}} At least three core models exist. The first and most widely used is Canale and Swain's model{{sfn|Canale|Swain|1980}} and the later iteration by Canale.{{sfn|Canale|1983}} In a second model, sociocultural content is more precisely specified by Celce-Murcia, Dornyei, and Thurrell in 1995. For their part, they saw communicative competence as including linguistic competence, strategic competence, sociocultural competence, actional competence, and discourse competence.{{sfn|Celce-Murcia|Dornyei|Thurrell|1995}} A third model widely in use in federal language training in Canada is Bachman and Palmer's model.{{sfn|Bachman|Palmer|2010}}

The understanding of communicative competence has been influenced by the field of [[pragmatics]] and the [[philosophy of language]], including work on [[speech act]]s.{{sfn|Hymes|1964}}

'''David Franklin Fasold''' (February 23, 1939 â April 26, 1998) was an [[United States Merchant Marine]] officer and salvage expert who is best known for his book ''The Ark of Noah'', chronicling his early expeditions to the [[DurupÄ±nar site|DurupÄ±nar]] [[Noah's Ark]] site in eastern Turkey.  Repudiating and then changing his views about the site, Fasold was a participant in a suit with [[Australian]] [[geologist]] and [[skeptic]] [[Ian Plimer]] against an Australian [[Creationism|creationist]] group.  The suit, dubbed the "[[Scopes Trial|Monkey Trial]] II,"&lt;ref name =TDN&gt;{{Cite news

==Biography and marine career==
Fasold was born in [[Chicago]] in 1939 and grew up in [[Wheaton, Illinois]], son of Frank, an [[architect]], and Ruth Fasold, who raised him as strict [[Plymouth Brethren]].  In 1957 he joined the [[United States Merchant Marine]] becoming an officer and traveling the world.  He met his wife Anna Elizabeth Avila, from [[El Salvador]], in [[San Jose, California]], in the 1950s.  After beginning a family he moved to [[Key West]], [[Florida]], where Fasold built up a respectable [[marine salvage]] company.  In the 1970s and 1980s he assisted various marine [[Treasure hunting|treasure hunters]], including [[Mel Fisher]].  He raised two sons, Nathan and Michael, before dying of [[cancer]] in [[Corvallis, Oregon]], on April 26, 1998, financially broken from years of expeditions and research.&lt;ref name=Dawes&gt;{{Cite book

==DurupÄ±nar Site==
Always interested in the history of the [[Bible]] and [[Noah's Ark]], Fasold studied pre-Christian accounts of the [[Deluge (mythology)|Deluge]] and came to believe that the ark would be found not on [[Mt. Ararat]] but somewhere to the southwest.  In 1985, Fasold teamed up with [[Ron Wyatt]] to investigate the [[DurupÄ±nar site]] (located at approximately {{Coord|39|26|26.26|N|44|14|04.26|E|type:landmark}}), a boat-shaped mound site named after [[Turkish Army]] Captain Ä°lhan DurupÄ±nar who identified the formation in a [[Turkish Air Force]] aerial photo while on a mapping mission for [[NATO]] in 1959.&lt;ref name=Dawes/&gt;&lt;ref name =Fasold&gt;{{Cite book

In 1985, Fasold and Wyatt were joined by [[geophysicist]] [[John Baumgardner]] for the expedition recounted in Fasold's ''The Ark of Noah''.  As soon as Fasold saw the site, he exclaimed that it was a ship wreck.  Fasold had brought a state-of-the-art [[frequency generator]], set on the wavelength for [[iron]] and searched the formation for internal iron loci.  This technique was later compared to [[dowsing]] by the site's detractors.  Fasold and the team measured the length of the formation as 538 feet, close to the 300 [[cubits]] of the [[Bible]] if the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] cubit of 20.6&amp;nbsp;inches is used.  Later measurements by others found it to be 515 feet, exactly 300 Egytpian cubits in length.  Fasold believed the team had found the fossilized remains of the upper deck and that the original reed substructure has disappeared.  In the nearby village of Kazan, so-called [[Arzap Drogue Stones|drogue]] stones that they believed were once attached to the ark were investigated.&lt;ref name =Fasold/&gt;&lt;ref name =Berlitz&gt;{{Cite book| last = Berlitz | first = Charles | title = The Lost Ship of Noah | publisher = Putnam | location = New York | pages = 51â61,157â162 | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-399-13182-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =Wyatt&gt;{{Cite book

===''The Ark of Noah'' and the break with Wyatt===
[[File:Fasold Book.jpg|thumb|The first edition of Fasold's book ''The Ark of Noah'', showing the [[DurupÄ±nar site]] and the ark as a large [[reed boat]].]]

Ron Wyatt and David Fasold were both featured on a [[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]] television special soon after their expedition. [[Charles Berlitz]] wrote of Fasold's searches in his 1987 book ''The Lost Ship of Noah'', also printing part of an extensive 1985 interview with Fasold on pages 157-161.&lt;ref name =Berlitz/&gt;  Wyatt wrote a small booklet, presenting his evidence found at the site, including what he considered  petrified wood from deck timbers, pitch, and metal rivets.&lt;ref name =Wyatt/&gt;  Fasold took a different approach, concentrating on [[pre-biblical]] literature and, as a nautical engineer, recognized the likelihood that it was made, like other ancient large boats and rafts, of reeds. He concluded that the enigmatic "gopher wood" of Genesis 6:14 was in fact a covering of [[bitumen]] and [[Phragmites|reeds]], and the words was related to ''kaphar'' or [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] . He also made the claim that there were two [[Dilmun]]s, one located on [[Bahrain]] and the original one in the [[Zagros]] mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Fasold makes this claim in pp. 206-211 of ''The Ark of Noah'', years before archaeologist [[David Rohl]] did in chapter eight of his book ''Legend: The Genesis of Civilisation''. There are other similarities between their theories, though arrived at by different methodologies.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Fasold published his own book, ''The Ark of Noah''.&lt;ref name =Fasold/&gt;

In ''The Ark of Noah'', Fasold took many [[fundamentalists]] and creationists to task for insisting that the ark was rectangular in shape, made of wood, and must have landed on Mount Ararat (when the Bible states "the mountains of Ararat"). He also critically examined and dismissed many previous ark sightings at Ararat. The exposure of his find in the media led to further expeditions to the site in the late 1980s and early 1990s. During this time, Wyatt supposedly discovered petrified wood and metal items, and exposed the remains of decayed rib timbers at the site.  Fasold doubted many of Wyatt's claims during this time, and broke with Wyatt's interpretations.&lt;ref name =Fasold/&gt;&lt;ref name=Deal&gt;{{Cite book| last = Deal | first = David Allen | title = Noah's Ark: The Evidence | publisher = Artisan | location = Muscogee, OK | pages = 45â46 | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-933677-02-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, Fasold formed the Noahide Society and issued a newsletter called ''Ark-Update''.&lt;ref name=Dawes/&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref name="Wilson 2002 36â39"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Wilson | first = Ian | title = Before the Flood | publisher = St. Martin's Press | location = New York | pages = 36â39 | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-312-30400-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also produced several audio and video tapes.&lt;ref&gt;Like, for instance, {{cite video

===Doubts and changing views===
During the 1990s, Fasold was caught between three opposing camps that derided his interest in the site. On one side were orthodox creationists who believed the ark could only lie on Mt. Ararat; the second camp included Wyatt and others who continued their research and reported significant discoveries; the third camp included skeptical geologists and biblical minimalists who called the site a hoax.&lt;ref name=Dawes/&gt;{{rp|95â127}}  After a few scientific expeditions to the DurupÄ±nar site that included drillings and excavation in the 1990s, Fasold began to have doubts that the DurupÄ±nar formation was Noah's ark. He visited the site with geologist [[Ian Plimer]] in September 1994, and in a subsequent interview noted his change of mind saying "I believe this may be the oldest running hoax in history. I think we have found what the ancients said was the Ark, but this structure is not Noah's Ark."&lt;ref name =Pockley&gt;{{Cite news

In April 1997 during his testimony in an Australian court case Fasold repudiated his belief in the Ark, and stated that he regarded the claim as "absolute BS".&lt;ref name= Clifton&gt;{{Cite news| last = Clifton | first = Brad | title = Doubts sank faith in Ark| newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]]  | date = 9 April 1997 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Thomson&gt;{{Cite news| last = Thomson| first =Kirstyn | title = Witness Tells How Ark Faith Sank| newspaper = The West Australian | date = 9 April 1997 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =Finkel&gt;{{Cite journal

Ark researchers such as David Allen Deal and&lt;ref name=Deal/&gt; [[Robert Michelson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Corbin | first = B. J. | title = The Explorers of Ararat and the Search for Noah's Ark | publisher = Great Commission Illustrated Books | location = Long Beach, CA | year = 1999 | isbn = 0965346986 | page = 429}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian friend and biographer June Dawes&lt;ref name=Dawes/&gt;{{rp|184}} reported that before his 1998 death Fasold again claimed the DurupÄ±nar site to be the location of the ark. Dawes wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Fasold] kept repeating that no matter what the experts said, there was too much going for the [DurupÄ±nar] site for it to be dismissed.  He remained convinced it was the fossilized remains of Noah's Ark.&lt;ref name=Dawes/&gt;{{rp|184}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Jabal al-Lawz==
In 1986 Fasold, along with [[Ron Wyatt]], was one of the first [[United States|Americans]] to investigate the notion that [[Jabal al-Lawz]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] might be the [[Biblical Mount Sinai]].  During an illegal trek through the desert around the mountain, Wyatt and Fasold were arrested and detained for a short period.  Former ''[[New York Times]]'' journalist [[Howard Blum]] wrote of Fasold's journeys in his 1998 book ''The Gold of Exodus''.&lt;ref name=Dawes/&gt;{{rp|47â62}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Blum | first = Howard | title = The Gold of Exodus: The Discovery of the True Mount Sinai | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York | pages = 44â59 | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-684-80918-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plimer case==
In 1997, Fasold was involved in an Australian case against a creationist named Allen Roberts who reproduced some of Fasold's artwork without permission. A co-plaintiff was Australian [[secular humanism|Humanist]] and [[skeptic]] [[Ian Plimer]].  Plimer sued Roberts's organization Ark Search, claiming that Roberts and Ark Search made false and misleading claims about the Durupinar site.  Plimer argued that Robert's speech was not protected [[free speech]], but instead he sued under the [[Competition and Consumer Act 2010|Fair Trading Act]], claiming that Roberts was misleading the public.  The case was promoted by the media around Australia and the world as a second [[Scopes Monkey Trial]].  Plimer's action failed; Judge Ron Sackville said "Courts should not attempt to provide a remedy for every false or misleading statement made in the course of public debate on matters of general interest."  Judge Sackville accepted that Roberts had infringed Fasold's [[copyrights]], but Fasold described the award of $2,500 [[Australian dollars]] in damages as "a slap in the face," pointing out that he had won more in two similar cases in the United States.&lt;ref name=TDN/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson 2002 36â39" /&gt;&lt;ref name =Finkel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''El BaÃºl'''{{Pronunciation-needed}} is a [[Pre-Columbian]] [[archaeological site]] in present-day [[Escuintla Department]], [[Guatemala]].  El BaÃºl, along with the sites of [[Bilbao (Mesoamerican site)|Bilbao]] and [[El Castillo (Maya site)|El Castillo]], is part of the [[Cotzumalhuapa]] Archaeological Zone.  It was occupied during the prehistoric [[Formative stage]] of the Americas.

==Site==
The El BaÃºl acropolis is located 4&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Santa LucÃ­a Cotzumalguapa]], {{convert|550|m|ft}} above sea level, {{convert|50|km|mi}} from the Pacific Ocean.  Its southern acropolis complex was destroyed in 1997 by urban development and the main groups are now covered by [[Sugarcane|sugar cane]] fields. The [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]] is located {{convert|500|m|ft}} north of the acropolis with several residential groups in between. It is united by two causeways. The site's geologic context is volcanic; it is located just south of an active stratovolcano, [[VolcÃ¡n de Fuego|Fuego volcano]].

The site contains monumental architecture in its acropolis as well as a probable sweatbath and [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] workshops.  Analysis of these deposits is particularly important for the study of the ancient obsidian industry. The P31 stratigraphic pit continued below these deposits to a depth of {{convert|3.78|m|ft}}, revealing [[volcanic ash]] layers derived from the adjacent Fuego volcano. [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|Obsidian]] [[debitage]] continued below these ash layers, suggesting that the area was used as a refuse deposit for a prolonged period.

The largest causeway is {{convert|2.5|km|mi}} long and ranges from {{convert|11|to|14|m|ft}} wide, joining the acropoli of Bilbao and El BaÃºl. Before entering El BaÃºl, the causeway ran across a large bridge over the [[Santiago River (Guatemala)|Santiago River]] gorge. The foundation walls of the bridge, which most probably sustained a wooden structure, are still visible along a 3{{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on}} span of the river course. An excavation carried out on the western side of the river gorge revealed two constructional stages for the causeway at this location, both of which date to the Late Classic period. Many monumental sculptures have been found along the causeways.

'''Elocution''' is the study of formal speaking in [[pronunciation]], [[grammar]], style, and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].

==History==
In Western classical [[rhetoric]], elocution was one of the five core disciplines of [[pronunciation]], which was the art of delivering speeches. Orators were trained not only on proper [[diction]], but on the proper use of gestures, stance, and dress. (Another area of rhetoric, [[elocutio]], was unrelated to ''elocution'' and, instead, concerned the style of writing proper to discourse.)

Elocution emerged as a formal discipline during the eighteenth century. One of its important figures was [[Thomas Sheridan (actor)|Thomas Sheridan]], actor and father of [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]].  Thomas Sheridan's lectures on elocution, collected in ''Lectures on Elocution'' (1762) and his ''Lectures on Reading'' (1775), provided directions for marking and reading aloud passages from literature. Another actor, John Walker, published his two-volume ''Elements of Elocution'' in 1781, which provided detailed instruction on voice control, gestures, pronunciation, and emphasis.

With the publication of these works and similar ones, elocution gained wider public interest. While training on proper speaking had been an important part of private education for many centuries, the rise in the nineteenth century of a middle class in Western countries (and the corresponding rise of public education) led to great interest in the teaching of elocution, and it became a staple of the school curriculum. American students of elocution drew selections from what were popularly deemed "Speakers." By the end of the century, several Speaker texts circulated throughout the United States, including McGuffey's ''New Juvenile Speaker'', the ''Manual of Elocution and Reading'', the ''Star Speaker'', and the popular ''Delsarte Speaker''. Some of these texts even included pictorial depictions of body movements and gestures to augment written descriptions.

The era of the elocution movement, defined by the likes of Sheridan and Walker, evolved in the early and mid-1800's into what is called the scientific movement of elocution, defined in the early period by James Rush's ''The Philosophy of the Human Voice'' (1827) and [[Richard Whately]]'s ''Elements of Rhetoric'' (1828), and in the later period by [[Alexander Melville Bell]]'s ''A New Elucidation of Principles of Elocution'' (1849) and ''Visible Speech'' (1867).

In her recent book ''The Elocutionists: Women, Music, and the Spoken Word'' (University of Illinois Press, 2017), [[Marian Wilson Kimber]] addresses the oft-forgotten, female-dominated genre of elocution set to musical accompaniment in the United States.

==Sample curriculum==

An example of this can be seen in the Table of Contents of [[McGuffey Readers|McGuffey's ''New Sixth Eclectic Reader'']] of 1857:

:Principles of Elocution
::I. Articulation
::II. Inflections
::III. Accent and Emphasis
::IV. Instructions for Reading Verse
::V. The Voice
::VI. Gesture

From the 18th century, an '''engagÃ©''' ({{IPA-fr|ÉÌÉ¡aÊe|lang}}, ''[[wikt:engagee#English|engagee]]'') was a [[French Canadians|French-Canadian]] man employed to [[canoe]] in the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]], usually as an [[Indentured servitude|indentured servant]].  He was expected to handle all transportation aspects of [[Frontier#Colonial North America|frontier]] river and lake travel: maintenance, loading and unloading, propelling, steering, [[portage|portaging]], camp set-up, navigation, interaction with [[indigenous people of North America|indigenous people]], etc.  The term was also applied to the men who staffed the [[pirogue]]s on the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]. Their role can be contrasted with the free, licensed ''[[voyageurs]]'', the independent merchant ''[[Coureur des bois|coureurs des bois]]'', as well as seafaring [[sailor]]s.

Can also refer to a person socially or politically engaged, especially in the arts and culture.

'''Equality of sacrifice''' is a term used in [[political theory]] and [[political philosophy]] to refer to the perceived fairness of a coercive policy.

[[John Stuart Mill]] noticed that citizens often view [[tax]]ation laws as being fair, as long as taxation is also applied equally to everyone else in society.&lt;ref&gt;"As a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it, whatever sacrifices it requires from them should be made to bear as nearly as possible with the same pressure upon all [...] Equality of taxation, therefore, as a maxim of politics, means equality of sacrifice." [[John Stuart Mill]]. 1848. ''[[Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy]]'', p. 804 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2006747]&lt;/ref&gt; Political theorist [[Margaret Levi]] applied the term to the perceived fairness of [[conscription]] in democracies, to which citizens may consent as long as conscription is enforced as a universal duty &amp;ndash; as opposed to elitist and exceptionalist policies, as it will sometimes occur in partial [[mobilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Levi, Margaret. 1997. ''Consent, Dissent and Patriotism''. Cambridge University Press ({{ISBN|052159961X}}) p. 26 &lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also adopted by [[Lee Iacocca]]&lt;ref&gt;Iacocca and Novak. 1984. ''[[Iacocca: An Autobiography]]''. New York: Bantam Books. Chapter 20.&lt;/ref&gt; who, as the president of [[Chrysler]], lowered his salary to less than a dollar a year before asking union members for radical wage cuts in order to deal with the company's financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Yeon and Mai-Dalton, Renate R. 1999. "The Model of Follower's Responses To Self-Sacrificial Leadership: An Empirical Test". ''The Leadership Quarterly'', Volume 10, Issue 3 (November 18) p. 398 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6W5N-3XX6KF9-F&amp;_user=789722&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000043357&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=789722&amp;md5=634ac86977034115cf258410ce309fd1]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[financial crisis of 2007â2010]], Iacocca's example has often been mentioned in opposition to "unconditional" government bail-out of failing companies. In a letter to the leaders of the big three U.S. automakers, Senator [[Chuck Grassley]] said that before receiving a government bailout executives should follow the example of former Chrysler head Lee Iacocca and cut their own pay:

{{cquote|Lee Iacocca essentially worked for pennies to demonstrate leadership and forcefully prove to his colleagues that he was ready to make sacrifices to reinvigorate Chrysler [...] Todayâs executives could learn a lot from this example. They should take every step possible, including cutting executive salaries and bonuses, and exhaust all alternatives before coming to the taxpayers for tens of billions of dollars in help.&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, Jason.

Some economists believe that the minimum wage laws in the United States lead to less equality because young black males are less likely to be able to get a job when the minimum wage is increased; this inequality exists primarily because young black workers typically live in urban areas where the food and drink industry, who mainly pay their workers minimum wage, are prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Even |first=William |title=Unequal Harm: Racial Disparities in the Employment Consequences of Minimum Wage Increases |url=http://epionline.org/study_detail.cfm?sid=137 |publisher=Employment Policies Institute |accessdate=30 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309184058/http://epionline.org/study_detail.cfm?sid=137 |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Expressive aphasia''', also known as '''Broca's aphasia''', is a type of [[aphasia]] characterized by partial loss of the ability to produce language (spoken, manual,&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hicoka|first1=Gregory|title=The neural organization of language: evidence from sign language aphasia|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=1 April 1998|volume=2|issue=4|pages=129â136|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661398011541|accessdate=18 December 2017|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01154-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or written), although comprehension generally remains intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-resources/brocas-aphasia/|title=Broca's Aphasia - National Aphasia Association|work=National Aphasia Association|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person with expressive aphasia will exhibit effortful speech. Speech generally includes important content words, but leaves out function words that have only grammatical significance and not real-world meaning, such as prepositions and articles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Language|last=Fromkin|first=Victoria|last2=Rodman|first2=Robert|last3=Hyams|first3=Nina|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|year=2014|isbn=978-1133310686|location=Boston, MA|pages=464â465}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as "telegraphic speech". The person's intended message may still be understood but his or her sentence will not be grammatically correct. In very severe forms of expressive aphasia, a person may only speak using single word utterances.&lt;ref name='ASHA'&gt;ASHA.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asha.org"&gt;Appendix: Common Classifications of Aphasia. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.asha.org/Practice-Portal/Clinical-Topics/Aphasia/Common-Classifications-of-Aphasia/&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, comprehension is mildly to moderately impaired in expressive aphasia due to difficulty understanding complex grammar.&lt;ref name="ASHA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="asha.org" /&gt;

It is caused by acquired damage to the anterior regions of the [[Human brain|brain]], such as the left posterior [[inferior frontal gyrus]] or inferior frontal operculum, also described as [[Broca's area]] ([[Brodmann area 44]] and [[Brodmann area 45]]).&lt;ref name="Purves"&gt;{{cite book|title=Neuroscience|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0-87893-742-4|edition=fourth|author=Purves, D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one subset of a larger family of disorders known collectively as [[aphasia]]. Expressive aphasia contrasts with [[receptive aphasia]], in which patients are able to speak in grammatical sentences that lack semantic significance, and generally also have trouble with comprehension.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakai_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Jeong|first2=JW|last3=Brown|first3=EC|last4=Rothermel|first4=R|last5=Kojima|first5=K|last6=Kambara|first6=T|last7=Shah|first7=A|last8=Mittal|first8=S|last9=Sood|first9=S|last10=Asano|first10=E|year=2017|title=Three- and four-dimensional mapping of speech and language in patients with epilepsy|journal=Brain|volume=140|issue=5|pages=1351â1370|doi=10.1093/brain/awx051|pmid=28334963|last1=Nakai|first1=Y|pmc=5405238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressive aphasia differs from [[dysarthria]], which is typified by a patient's inability to properly move the muscles of the tongue and mouth to produce speech. Expressive aphasia also differs from apraxia of speech which is a motor disorder characterized by an inability to create and sequence motor plans for speech.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Neurogenic Communication Disorders|last=Brookshire|first=Robert|publisher=Mosby|year=2007|isbn=978-0323045315|location=St. Louis, MO|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Broca's (expressive) aphasia is a type of non-fluent aphasia in which an individualâs speech is halting and effortful. Misarticulations or distortions of consonants and vowels, namely phonetic dissolution, are common. Individuals with expressive aphasia may only produce single words, or words in groups of two or three.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Long pauses between words are common and multi-syllabic words may be produced one syllable at a time with pauses between each syllable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The prosody of a person with Broca's aphasia is compromised by shortened length of utterances and the presence of self-repairs and disfluencies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Manasco, H. (2014). The Aphasias. In Introduction to Neurogenic Communication Disorders (Vol. 1, p. 91). Burlington, MA: Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]] and stress patterns are also deficient.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Perception: Language and Speech. Vol VII|last=Goodglass|first=H.|author2=N. Geschwind|publisher=Academic Press|year=1976|editor=E. Carterette and M.P. Friedman|location=New York|chapter=Language disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the following passage, a patient with Broca's aphasia is trying to explain how he came to the hospital for dental surgery and it may look like this:&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes... ah... Monday... er... Dad and Peter H... (his own name), and Dad.... er... hospital... and ah... Wednesday... Wednesday, nine o'clock... and oh... Thursday... ten o'clock, ah doctors... two... an' doctors... and er... teeth... yah.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The speech of a person with expressive aphasia contains mostly content words such as nouns, verbs, and some adjectives. However, function words like conjunctions, articles, and prepositions are rarely used except for âandâ which is prevalent in the speech of most patients with aphasia. The omission of function words makes the person's speech agrammatic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A communication partner of a person with aphasia may say that the person's speech sounds telegraphic due to poor sentence construction and disjointed words.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For example, a person with expressive aphasia might say "Smart... university... smart... good... good..."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Self-monitoring is typically well preserved in patients with Broca's aphasia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They are usually aware of their communication deficits, and are more prone to depression and outbursts from frustration than are patients with other forms of aphasia.[[Expressive aphasia#cite note-Chapey 2008 8-7|&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

In general, word comprehension is preserved, allowing patients to have functional receptive language skills.&lt;ref name="Manasco"&gt;{{cite book|title=INtroduction to Neurogenic Communication Disorders|last1=Manasco|publisher=William Brottmiller|year=2014|isbn=9781449652449|editor=Katey Birtcher|location=Pennsylvania, USA|pages=80â81|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with Broca's aphasia understand most of the everyday conversation around them, but higher-level deficits in receptive language can occur.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Neurogenic Communication Disorders|last1=Manasco|first1=M. Hunter|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=9781449652449|page=80|date=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because comprehension is substantially impaired for more complex sentences, it is better to use simple language when speaking with an individual with expressive aphasia. This is exemplified by the difficulty to understand phrases or sentences with unusual structure. A typical patient with Broca's aphasia will misinterpret "the man is bitten by the dog" by switching the subject and object to âthe dog is bitten by the man.â&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbsonline.cup.cam.ac.uk/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.grodzinsky.html|title=Neurology of Syntax|work=Behavioral and Brain Sciences 23 (1)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040518000003/http://bbsonline.cup.cam.ac.uk/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.grodzinsky.html|archivedate=2004-05-18|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2006-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, people with expressive aphasia can understand speech and read better than they can produce speech and write.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The person's writing will resemble his or her speech and will be effortful, lacking cohesion, and containing mostly content words.&lt;ref name="Chapey 2008 8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Intervention Strategies in Aphasia and Related Neurogenic Communication Disorders|last=Chapey|first=Roberta|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7817-6981-5|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letters will likely be formed clumsily and distorted and some may even be omitted. Although listening and reading are generally intact, subtle deficits in both reading and listening comprehension are almost always present during assessment of aphasia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Because Broca's area is anterior to the primary motor cortex which is responsible for movement of the face, hands, and arms, a lesion affecting Broca's areas may also result in hemiparesis (weakness of both limbs on the same side of the body) or hemiplegia (paralysis of both limbs on the same side of the body).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The brain is wired contralaterally, which means the limbs on right side of the body are controlled by the left hemisphere and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teasell|first=Robert|date=2003|title=Stroke recovery and rehabilitation.|url=|journal=Stroke|volume=34 | issue = 2 |pages=365â366|via=|doi=10.1161/01.str.0000054630.33395.e2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, when Broca's area or surrounding areas in the left hemisphere are damaged, hemiplegia or hemiparesis often occurs on the right side of the body in individuals with Broca's aphasia.

Severity of expressive aphasia varies among patients. Some people may only have mild deficits and detecting problems with their language may be difficult. In the most extreme cases, patients may be able to produce only a single word. Even in such cases, over-learned and rote-learned speech patterns may be retained&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csuchico.edu/~pmccaff/syllabi/SPPA336/336unit7.html|title=Specific Syndromes: The Nonfluent Aphasias|work=Neuropathologies of Language and Cognition|accessdate=2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;- for instance, some patients can count from one to ten, but cannot produce the same numbers in novel conversation.

===Manual language and aphasia===
In deaf patients who use manual language (such as American Sign Language), damage to the left hemisphere of the brain leads to disruptions in their signing ability.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Paraphasic errors similar to spoken language have been observed; whereas in spoken language a phonemic substitution would occur (e.g. "tagle" instead of "table"), in [[ASL]]  case studies errors in movement, hand position, and morphology have been noted. Agrammatism, or the lack of grammatical morphemes in sentence production, has also been observed in lifelong users of American Sign Language who have left hemisphere damage. The lack of syntactic accuracy shows that the errors in signing are not due to damage to the motor cortex, but rather are a manifestation of the damage to the language-producing area of the brain. Similar symptoms have been seen in a patient with left hemisphere damage whose first language was [[British Sign Language]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Jane|title=Aphasia in a user of British Sign Language: Dissociation between sign and gesture|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|date=15 June 2004|volume=21|issue=5|pages=537â554|doi=10.1080/02643290342000249|pmid=21038221}}&lt;/ref&gt; further showing that damage to the left hemisphere primarily hinders linguistic ability, not motor ability. In contrast, patients who have damage to non-linguistic areas on the left hemisphere have been shown to be fluent in signing, but are unable to comprehend written language.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

===Overlap with receptive aphasia===
In addition to difficulty expressing oneself, individuals with expressive aphasia are also noted to commonly have trouble with comprehension in certain linguistic areas. This agrammatism overlaps with receptive aphasia, but can be seen in patients who have expressive aphasia without being diagnosed as having receptive aphasia. The most well-noted of these are object-relative clauses, object Wh- questions, and topicalized structures (placing the topic at the beginning of the sentence).&lt;ref name="Friedmann"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Friedmann | first1 = Naama | last2 = Gvion | first2 = Aviah | last3 = Novogrodsky | first3 = Rama| title = Syntactic Movement in Agrammatism and S-SLI: Two Different Impairments | editor = Adriana Belletti| work = Language acquisition and development proceedings of GALA2005 | publisher = Cambridge Scholars Press | year = 2006 | location = Newcastle, UK | pages = 197â210 | url = http://www.language-brain.com/docs/Friedmann_Gvion_Novogrodsky_movementSLI_agrammatism.pdf | isbn = 9781847180285 |oclc=133524617 |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three concepts all share phrasal movement, which can cause words to lose their thematic roles when they change order in the sentence.&lt;ref name="Friedmann" /&gt; This is often not an issue for people without agrammatic aphasias, but many people with aphasia rely heavily on word order to understand roles that words play within the sentence.

==== Common causes ====
The most common cause of expressive aphasia is [[stroke]]. A stroke is caused by hypoperfusion (lack of oxygen) to an area of the brain, which is commonly caused by [[thrombosis]] or [[embolism]]. Some form of aphasia occurs in 34 to 38% of stroke patients.&lt;ref name="Bakheit"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakheit|first=AMO|last2=Shaw|first2=S|last3=Carrington|first3=S|last4=Griffiths|first4=S|year=2007|title=The rate and extent of improvement with therapy from the different types of aphasia in the first year of stroke|url=|format=|journal=Integumentary Rehabilitation|volume=21|issue=10|pages=941â949|doi=10.1177/0269215507078452|pmid=17981853|id=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressive aphasia occurs in approximately 12% of new cases of aphasia caused by stroke.&lt;ref name="Pedersen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pedersen|first=PM|last2=Vinter|first2=K|last3=Olsen|first3=TS|year=2004|title=Aphasia after stroke: Type, severity, and prognosis - The Copenhagen aphasia study|url=|format=|journal=Cerebrovascular Diseases|volume=17|issue=1|pages=35â43|doi=10.1159/000073896|pmid=14530636|id=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, expressive aphasia is caused by a stroke in Broca's area or the surrounding vicinity. Broca's area is in the lower part of the premotor cortex in the language dominant hemisphere and is responsible for planning motor speech movements. However, cases of expressive aphasia have been seen in patients with strokes in other areas of the brain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Patients with classic symptoms of expressive aphasia in general have more acute brain lesions, whereas patients with larger, widespread lesions exhibit a variety of symptoms that may be classified as [[global aphasia]] or left unclassified.&lt;ref name="Bakheit" /&gt;

Expressive aphasia can also be caused by trauma to the brain, [[tumor]], and [[cerebral hemorrhage]]&lt;ref name="Ozeren"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orzeren|first=A|author2=F Koc|author3=M Demirkiran|author4=A Sonmezler|year=2006|title=Global aphasia due to left thalamic hemorrhage|url=|format=|journal=Neurology India|volume=54|issue=4|pages=415â417|doi=10.4103/0028-3886.28118|pmid=17114855|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[extradural hematoma]].&lt;ref name="Commondoor"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Commondoor, R.|author2=Eisenhut, M.|author3=Fowler, C.|author4=Kirollos, R. W.|author5=Nathwani, N.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2009|title=Transient Broca's Aphasia as Feature of an Extradural Abscess|journal=Pediatric Neurology|volume=40|issue=1|pages=50â53|doi=10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2008.06.018|pmid=19068255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding [[lateralization of brain function]] is important for understanding which areas of the brain cause expressive aphasia when damaged. In the past, it has been believed that the area for language production differs between left and right-handed individuals. If this were true, damage to the homologous region of Broca's area in the right hemisphere should cause aphasia in a left-handed individual. More recent studies have shown that even left-handed individuals typically have language functions only in the left hemisphere. However, left-handed individuals are more likely to have a dominance of language in the right hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Purves" /&gt;

==== Uncommon causes ====
Less common causes of expressive aphasia include primary [[Autoimmune encephalitis|autoimmune phenomenon]] and autoimmune phenomenon that are secondary to cancer (as a [[paraneoplastic syndrome]]) have been listed as the primary hypothesis for several cases of aphasia, especially when presenting with other psychiatric disturbances and focal neurological deficits. Many case reports exist describing paraneoplastic aphasia, and the reports that are specific tend to describe expressive aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKeon|first=Andrew|date=April 2013|title=Paraneoplastic and Other Autoimmune Disorders of the Central Nervous System|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3726118/|journal=The Neurohospitalist|volume=3|issue=2|pages=53â64|doi=10.1177/1941874412453339|issn=1941-8744|pmc=3726118|pmid=23983888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeung|first=Darwin F|last2=Hsu|first2=Rose|date=2014-08-05|title=Expressive aphasia in a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4130962/|journal=SpringerPlus|volume=3|doi=10.1186/2193-1801-3-406|issn=2193-1801|pmc=4130962|pmid=25126489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Will|first=A.|last2=Akalin|first2=Murat|date=2012-04-24|title=Paraneoplastic Limbic Encephalitis with NMDA Receptor (NR1) Antibodies in Breast Cancer (S08.007)|url=http://n.neurology.org/content/78/1_Supplement/S08.007|journal=Neurology|language=en|volume=78|issue=1 Supplement|pages=S08.007âS08.007|issn=0028-3878}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5XLSPrCtB4C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=paraneoplastic+aphasia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QO34Vd-SSQ&amp;sig=vdTLrQ97qyQD8F7xNfW8fqe7lo8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj9-fbp8_HeAhVQR60KHTjWDecQ6AEwEXoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=paraneoplastic%20aphasia&amp;f=false|title=Paraneoplastic Syndromes|last=Darnell|first=Robert|last2=Darnell|first2=Robert B.|last3=Posner|first3=Jerome B.|date=2011-08-22|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780199772735|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lancaster|first=Eric|date=April 2015|title=Continuum: The Paraneoplastic Disorders|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4443809/|journal=Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)|volume=21|issue=2 0|pages=452â475|doi=10.1212/01.CON.0000464180.89580.88|issn=1080-2371|pmc=4443809|pmid=25837906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although most cases attempt to exclude micrometastasis, it is likely that some cases of paraneoplastic aphasia are actually extremely small metastasis to the vocal motor regions.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Neurdegenerative diseases may present with aphasia. [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's Disease]] may present with either [[fluent aphasia]] or expressive aphasia. There are case reports of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease presenting with expressive aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahboob|first=Hafiz B.|last2=Kaokaf|first2=Kazi H.|last3=Gonda|first3=Jeremy M.|date=2018-02-14|title=Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Presenting as Expressive Aphasia and Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5832162/|journal=Case Reports in Critical Care|volume=2018|doi=10.1155/2018/5053175|issn=2090-6420|pmc=5832162|pmid=29666711}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-resources/primary-progressive-aphasia/|title=Primary Progressive Aphasia - National Aphasia Association|work=National Aphasia Association|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Expressive aphasia is classified as non-fluent aphasia, as opposed to fluent aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asha.org/Practice-Portal/Clinical-Topics/Aphasia/Common-Classifications-of-Aphasia/|title=Common Classifications of Aphasia|website=www.asha.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis is done on a case by case basis, as [[lesions]] often affect the surrounding [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] and deficits are highly variable among patients with aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-faqs/|title=Aphasia FAQ's|last=|first=|date=November 7, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A physician is typically the first person to recognize aphasia in a patient who is being treated for damage to the brain. Routine processes for determining the presence and location of lesion in the brain include Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) scans. The physician will complete a brief assessment of the patient's ability to understand and produce language. For further diagnostic testing, the physician will refer the patient to a speech-language pathologist, who will complete a comprehensive evaluation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/aphasia|title=Aphasia|last=|first=|date=March 6, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to diagnose a patient who is suffering from Brocaâs aphasia, there are certain commonly used tests and procedures. The Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) classifies individuals based on their scores on the subtests; spontaneous speech, auditory comprehension, repetition, and naming.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) can inform users what specific type of aphasia they may have, infer the location of lesion, and assess current language abilities. The Porch Index of Communication Ability (PICA) can predict potential recovery outcomes of the patients with aphasia. Quality of life measurement is also an important assessment tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csuchico.edu/~pmccaffrey/syllabi/SPPA336/336unit9.html|title=The Diagnosis of Aphasia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests such as the Assessment for Living with Aphasia (ALA) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) allow for therapists to target skills that are important and meaningful for the individual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition to formal assessments, patient and family interviews are valid and important sources of information. The patientâs previous hobbies, interests, personality, and occupation are all factors that will not only impact therapy but may motivate them throughout the recovery process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Patient interviews and observations allow professionals to learn the priorities of the patient and family and determine what the patient hopes to regain in therapy. Observations of the patient may also be beneficial to determine where to begin treatment. The current behaviors and interactions of the patient will provide the therapist with more insight about the client and his or her individual needs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other information about the patient can be retrieved from medical records, patient referrals from physicians, and the nursing staff.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In non-speaking patients who use manual languages, diagnosis is often based on interviews from the patient's acquaintances, noting the differences in sign production pre- and post- damage to the brain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many of these patients will also begin to rely on non-linguistic gestures to communicate, rather than signing since their language production is hindered.

==Treatment==
Currently, there is no standard treatment for expressive aphasia. Most aphasia treatment is individualized based on a patient's condition and needs as assessed by a speech language pathologist. Patients go through a period of spontaneous recovery following brain injury in which they regain a great deal of language function.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In the months following injury or stroke, most patients receive traditional treatment for a few hours per day. Among other exercises, patients practice the repetition of words and phrases. Mechanisms are also taught in traditional treatment to compensate for lost language function such as drawing and using phrases that are easier to pronounce.&lt;ref name="Meinzer"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Extending the Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) approach to cognitive functions: Constraint-Induced Aphasia Therapy (CIAT) of chronic aphasia|journal=NeuroRehabilitation|year=2007|first=Marcus|last=Meinzer|author2=Thomas Elbert|author3=Daniela Djundja|author4=Edward Taub|pmid=17971622|volume=22|issue=4|pages=311â318|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emphasis is placed on establishing a basis for communication with family and caregivers in everyday life. Treatment is individualized based on the patient's own priorities, along with the family's input.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aphasia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aphasia &gt; Treatment|url=http://www.asha.org/PRPSpecificTopic.aspx?folderid=8589934663&amp;section=Treatment|website=ASHA Practice Portal|publisher=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|accessdate=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patient may have the option of individual or group treatment. Although less common, group treatment has been shown to have advantageous outcomes. Some types of group treatments include family counseling, maintenance groups, support groups and treatment groups.

===Melodic intonation therapy===
[[Melodic intonation therapy]] was inspired by the observation that individuals with non-fluent aphasia sometimes can sing words or phrases that they normally cannot speak. "Melodic Intonation Therapy was begun as an attempt to use the intact melodic/prosodic processing skills of the right hemisphere in those with aphasia to help cue retrieval words and expressive language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Case Study of the Efficacy of Melodic Intonation Therapy|journal=Music Perception |volume=24|issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=23â36 |issn=0730-7829 |doi=10.1525/mp.2006.24.1.23 |author=Wilson Sarah J|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186051/UQ186051_OA.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that this is because singing capabilities are stored in the right hemisphere of the brain, which is likely to remain unaffected after a stroke in the left hemisphere.&lt;ref name='Schlaug'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1525/mp.2008.25.4.315|title=From Singing to Speaking: Why singing may lead to recovery of expressive language function in patients with Broca's Aphasia|journal=Music Perception|year=2008|first=Gottfried|last=Schlaug|author2=Sarah Marchina|author3=Andrea Norton|volume=25|issue=4|pages=315â319|id= |pmid=21197418|pmc=3010734}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent evidence demonstrates that the capability of individuals with aphasia to sing entire pieces of text may actually result from rhythmic features and the familiarity with the lyrics.&lt;ref name='Stahl a'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stahl|first1=Benjamin|last2=Kotz|first2=Sonja A.|last3=Henseler|first3=Ilona|last4=Turner|first4=Robert|last5=Geyer|first5=Stefan|title=Rhythm in disguise: why singing may not hold the key to recovery from aphasia|journal=Brain |volume=134|issue=10 |year=2011 |pages=3083â3093 |issn=0006-8950|doi=10.1093/brain/awr240 |pmid=21948939 |pmc=3187543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of Melodic Intonation Therapy is to utilize singing to access the language-capable regions in the right hemisphere and use these regions to compensate for lost function in the left hemisphere. The natural musical component of speech was used to engage the patients' ability to produce phrases. A clinical study revealed that singing and rhythmic speech may be similarly effective in the treatment of non-fluent aphasia and apraxia of speech.&lt;ref name='Stahl b'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stahl|first1=Benjamin|last2=Henseler|first2=Ilona|last3=Turner|first3=Robert|last4=Geyer|first4=Stefan|last5=Kotz|first5=Sonja A.|title=How to engage the right brain hemisphere in aphasics without even singing: Evidence for two paths of speech recovery|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |volume=7 |issue=35 |year=2013 |pages=1â12 |issn=1662-5161 |doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00035|pmid=23450277|pmc=3583105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, evidence from [[randomized controlled trial]]s is still needed to confirm that Melodic Intonation Therapy is suitable to improve propositional utterances and speech intelligibility in individuals with (chronic) non-fluent aphasia and apraxia of speech.&lt;ref name='van der Meulen a'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van der Meulen|first1=I.|last2=van de Sandt-Koenderman|first2= M. W.|last3=Heijenbrok-Kal|first3=M. H.|last4=Visch-Brink|first4=E. G.|last5=Ribbers|first5=G. M.| title=The efficacy and timing of Melodic Intonation Therapy in subacute aphasia.|journal=Neurorehabil.

Melodic Intonation Therapy appears to work particularly well in patients who have had a unilateral, left hemisphere stroke, show poor articulation, are non-fluent or have severely restricted speech output, have moderately preserved auditory comprehension, and show good motivation. MIT therapy on average lasts for 1.5 hours per day for five days per week. At the lowest level of therapy, simple words and phrases (such as "water" and "I love you") are broken down into a series of high- and low-pitch syllables. With increased treatment, longer phrases are taught and less support is provided by the therapist. Patients are taught to say phrases using the natural melodic component of speaking and continuous voicing is emphasized. The patient is also instructed to use the left hand to tap the syllables of the phrase while the phrases are spoken. Tapping is assumed to trigger the rhythmic component of speaking to utilize the right hemisphere.&lt;ref name='Schlaug' /&gt;

[[FMRI]] studies have shown that Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) uses both sides of the brain to recover lost function, as opposed to traditional therapies that utilize only the left hemisphere. In MIT, individuals with small lesions in the left hemisphere seem to recover by activation of the left hemisphere perilesional cortex. Meanwhile, individuals with larger left-hemisphere lesions show a recruitment of the use of language-capable regions in the right hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Schlaug"/&gt; The interpretation of these results is still a matter of debate. For example, it remains unclear whether changes in neural activity in the right hemisphere result from singing or from the intensive use of common phrases, such as "thank you", "how are you?" or "I am fine." This type of phrases falls into the category of [[formulaic language]] and is known to be supported by neural networks of the intact right hemisphere.&lt;ref name='Stahl c'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stahl|first1=Benjamin|last2=Kotz|first2=Sonja A.|title=Facing the music: Three issues in current research on singing and aphasia|journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=5 |issue=1033 |year=2013 |pages=1â4 |issn=1664-1078 |doi= 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01033|pmid=25295017|pmc=4172097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pilot study reported positive results when comparing the efficacy of a modified form of MIT to no treatment in people with nonfluent aphasia with damage to their left-brain. A randomized controlled trial was conducted and the study reported benefits of utilizing modified MIT treatment early in the recovery phase for people with nonfluent aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conklyn|first1=D|last2=Novak|first2=E|last3=Boissy|first3=A|last4=Bethoux|first4=F|last5=Chemali|first5=K|title=The Effects of Modified Melodic Intonation Therapy on Nonfluent Aphasia: A Pilot Study|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|date=2012|volume=55|issue=5|pages=1463â1471|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2012/11-0105)|pmid=22411278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melodic Intonation Therapy is used by music therapists, board-certified professionals that use music as a therapeutic tool to effect certain non-musical outcomes in their patients. Speech language pathologists can also use this therapy for individuals who have had a left hemisphere stroke and non-fluent aphasias such as Brocaâs or even apraxia of speech.

===Constraint-induced therapy===
Constraint-induced aphasia therapy (CIAT) is based on similar principles as [[constraint-induced movement therapy]] developed by Dr. [[Edward Taub]] at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.&lt;ref name='Meinzer' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Pulvermuller'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Constraint-Induced Therapy of Chronic Aphasia following Stroke|journal=Stroke|year=2001|first=Friedemann|last=Pulvermuller|pmid=11441210|volume=32|issue=7|pages=1621â1626|id= |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/32/7/1621|format=|accessdate=|doi=10.1161/01.STR.32.7.1621 |display-authors=etal|citeseerx=10.1.1.492.3416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constraint-induced movement therapy is based on the idea that a person with an impairment (physical or communicative) develops a "learned nonuse" by compensating for the lost function with other means such as using an unaffected limb by a paralyzed individual or drawing by a patient with aphasia.&lt;ref name='Pulvermuller2'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/02687030701612213|title=Aphasia therapy on a neuroscience basis|journal=Aphasiology|year=2008|first=Friedemann|last=Pulvermuller|author2=Marcelo Berthier|pmid=18923644|volume=22|issue=6|pmc=2557073|pages=563â599|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In constraint-induced movement therapy, the alternative limb is constrained with a glove or sling and the patient is forced to use the affected limb. In constraint-induced aphasia therapy the interaction is guided by communicative need in a language game context, picture cards, barriers making it impossible to see other players' cards, and other materials, so that patients are encouraged ("constrained") to use the remaining verbal abilities to succeed in the communication game.&lt;ref name='Pulvermuller' /&gt;

Two important principles of constraint-induced aphasia therapy are that treatment is very intense, with sessions lasting for up to 6 hours over the course of 10 days and that language is used in a communication context in which it is closely linked to (nonverbal) actions.&lt;ref name='Meinzer' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Pulvermuller' /&gt;  These principles are motivated by neuroscience insights about learning at the level of nerve cells (synaptic plasticity) and the coupling between cortical systems for language and action in the human brain.&lt;ref name='Pulvermuller2' /&gt; Constraint-induced therapy contrasts sharply with traditional therapy by the strong belief that mechanisms to compensate for lost language function, such as gesturing or writing, should not be used unless absolutely necessary, even in everyday life.&lt;ref name='Meinzer' /&gt;

It is believed that CIAT works by the mechanism of increased [[neuroplasticity]]. By constraining an individual to use only speech, it is believed that the brain is more likely to reestablish old neural pathways and recruit new neural pathways to compensate for lost function.

The strongest results of CIAT have been seen in patients with chronic aphasia (lasting over 6 months). Studies of CIAT have confirmed that further improvement is possible even after a patient has reached a "plateau" period of recovery.&lt;ref name='Meinzer' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Pulvermuller' /&gt; It has also been proven that the benefits of CIAT are retained long term. However, improvements only seem to be made while a patient is undergoing intense therapy.&lt;ref name='Meinzer' /&gt; Recent work has investigated combining constraint-induced aphasia therapy with drug treatment, which led to an amplification of therapy benefits.&lt;ref name='Berthier'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ana.21597|title=Memantine and constraint-induced aphasia therapy in chronic poststroke aphasia|journal=Annals of Neurology|year=2009|first=Marcelo|last=Berthier|volume=65|issue=5|pages=577â578|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=|pmid=19475666|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medication===
In addition to active speech therapy, pharmaceuticals have also been considered as a useful treatment for expressive aphasia. This area of study is relatively new and much research continues to be conducted.

The following drugs have been suggested for use in treating aphasia and their efficacy has been studied in control studies.

* [[Bromocriptine]] &amp;ndash; acts on [[Catecholamine]] Systems&lt;ref name='de Boissezon'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2006.07.004|title=Pharmacotherapy of aphasia: Myth or reality?|journal=Brain and Language|year=2007|first=de Boissezon|last=Xavier|author2=Patrice Peran|pmid=16982084|volume=102|issue=1|pages=114â125|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Piracetam]] &amp;ndash; mechanism not fully understood, but most likely interacts with cholinergic and glutamatergic receptors, among others&lt;ref name='de Boissezon' /&gt;
* [[Cholinergic]] drugs ([[Donepezil]], [[Aniracetam]], [[Bifemelane]]) &amp;ndash; acts on [[acetylcholine]] systems&lt;ref name='de Boissezon' /&gt;
* [[Dopaminergic]] [[psychostimulants]]: ([[Dexamphetamine]], [[Methylphenidate]])&lt;ref name='de Boissezon' /&gt;

The most effect has been shown by piracetam and amphetamine, which may increase [[Neuroplasticity|cerebral plasticity]] and result in an increased capability to improve language function. It has been seen that piracetam is most effective when treatment is begun immediately following stroke. When used in chronic cases it has been much less efficient.{{sfn|Berthier|2005}}

Bromocriptine has been shown by some studies to increase verbal fluency and word retrieval with therapy than with just therapy alone.&lt;ref name='de Boissezon' /&gt;  Furthermore, its use seems to be restricted to non-fluent aphasia.&lt;ref name='Berthier' /&gt;

Donepezil has shown a potential for helping chronic aphasia.&lt;ref name='Berthier' /&gt;

No study has established irrefutable evidence that any drug is an effective treatment for aphasia therapy.&lt;ref name='de Boissezon' /&gt; Furthermore, no study has shown any drug to be specific for language recovery.&lt;ref name='Berthier' /&gt;  Comparison between the recovery of language function and other motor function using any drug has shown that improvement is due to a global increase plasticity of neural networks.&lt;ref name='de Boissezon' /&gt;

===Transcranial magnetic stimulation===
In [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), magnetic fields are used to create electrical currents in specified [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] regions. The procedure is a painless and noninvasive method of stimulating the cortex. TMS works by suppressing the inhibition process in certain areas of the brain.&lt;ref name='Naeser'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2004.08.004|title=Improved picture naming in chronic aphasia after TMS to part of right Broca|journal=Brain and Language|year=2004|first=Naeser|last=Margaret|author2=Paula Martin|author3=Marjorie Nicholas|author4=Errol Baker|pmid=15766771|volume=93|issue=1|pages=95â105|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By suppressing the inhibition of neurons by external factors, the targeted area of the brain may be reactivated and thereby recruited to compensate for lost function. Research has shown that patients can demonstrate increased object naming ability with regular transcranial magnetic stimulation than patients not receiving TMS.&lt;ref name="Naeser"/&gt; Furthermore, research suggests this improvement is sustained upon the completion of TMS therapy.&lt;ref name='Naeser' /&gt; However, some patients fail to show any significant improvement from TMS which indicates the need for further research of this treatment.&lt;ref name='Martin'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2009.07.007|title=Overt Naming fMRI Pre- and Post- TMS: Two Nonfluent Aphasia Patients, with and without Improved Naming Post- TMS|journal=Brain and Language|year=2009|first=Paula|last=Martin|author2=Margaret Naeser|author3=Michael Ho|author4=Karl Doron|author5=Jacquie Kurland|pmid=19695692|volume=111|issue=1|pmc=2803355|pages=20â35|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of underlying forms===
Described as the linguistic approach to the treatment of expressive aphasia, treatment begins by emphasizing and educating patients on the thematic roles of words within sentences.&lt;ref name="TUF"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thompson CK, Shapiro LP |title=Treating agrammatic aphasia within a linguistic framework: Treatment of Underlying Forms |journal=Aphasiology |volume=19 |issue=10â11 |pages=1021â1036 |date=November 2005 |pmid=17410280 |pmc=1847567 |doi=10.1080/02687030544000227 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentences that are usually problematic will be reworded into active-voiced, declarative phrasings of their non-canonical counterparts.&lt;ref name="TUF" /&gt; The simpler sentence phrasings are then transformed into variations that are more difficult to interpret. For example, many individuals who have expressive aphasia struggle with Wh- sentences. "What" and "who" questions are problematic sentences that this treatment method attempts to improve, and they are also two interrogative particles that are strongly related to each other because they reorder arguments from the declarative counterparts.&lt;ref name="TUF" /&gt; For instance, therapists have used sentences like, "Who is the boy helping?" and "What is the boy fixing?" because both verbs are transitive- they require two arguments in the form of a subject and a direct object, but not necessarily an indirect object.&lt;ref name="TUF" /&gt; In addition, certain question particles are linked together based on how the reworded sentence is formed. Training "who" sentences increased the generalizations of non-trained "who" sentences as well as untrained "what" sentences, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="TUF" /&gt; Likewise, "where" and "when" question types are very closely linked. "What" and "who" questions alter placement of arguments, and "where" and "when" sentences move adjunct phrases.&lt;ref name="TUF" /&gt; Training is in the style of: "The man parked the car in the driveway. What did the man park in the driveway?"&lt;ref name="TUF" /&gt; Sentence training goes on in this manner for more domains, such as clefts and sentence voice.&lt;ref name="TUF" /&gt;

Results: Patientsâ use of sentence types used in the TUF treatment will improve, subjects will generalize sentences of similar category to those used for treatment in TUF, and results are applied to real-world conversations with others.&lt;ref name="TUF" /&gt; Generalization of sentence types used can be improved when the treatment progresses in the order of more complex sentences to more elementary sentences. Treatment has been shown to affect on-line (real-time) processing of trained sentences and these results can be tracked using fMRI mappings.&lt;ref name="TUF" /&gt; Training of Wh- sentences has led improvements in three main areas of discourse for aphasics: increased average length of utterances, higher proportions of grammatical sentences, and larger ratios of numbers of verbs to nouns produced.&lt;ref name="TUF" /&gt; Patients also showed improvements in verb argument structure productions and assigned thematic roles to words in utterances with more accuracy.&lt;ref name="TUF" /&gt; In terms of on-line sentence processing, patients having undergone this treatment discriminate between anomalous and non-anomalous sentences with more accuracy than control groups and are closer to levels of normalcy than patients not having participated in this treatment.&lt;ref name="TUF" /&gt;

===Mechanisms of recovery===
Mechanisms for recovery differ from patient to patient. Some mechanisms for recovery occur spontaneously after damage to the brain, whereas others are caused by the effects of language therapy.&lt;ref name='Berthier' /&gt; [[FMRI]] studies have shown that recovery can be partially attributed to the activation of tissue around the damaged area and the recruitment of new neurons in these areas to compensate for the lost function. Recovery may also be caused in very acute lesions by a return of blood flow and function to damaged tissue that has not died around an injured area.&lt;ref name='Berthier' /&gt; It has been stated by some researchers that the recruitment and recovery of neurons in the left hemisphere opposed to the recruitment of similar neurons in the right hemisphere is superior for long-term recovery and continued rehabilitation.&lt;ref name='Heiss'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/1531-8249(199904)45:4&lt;430::AID-ANA3&gt;3.0.CO;2-P|title=Differential capacity of left and right hemispheric areas for compensation of poststroke|first5=H|last5=Karbe|first4=M|last4=Ghaemi|first3=A|last3=Thiel|first2=J |journal=Ann Neurol|last2=Kessler|year=1999|first=W-D|last=Heiss|volume=45|pmid=10211466|issue=4|pages=430â438|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that, because the right hemisphere is not intended for full language function, using the right hemisphere as a mechanism of recovery is effectively a "dead-end" and can lead only to partial recovery.&lt;ref name='Martin' /&gt;

It has been proven that, among all types of therapies, one of the most important factors and best predictors for a successful outcome is the intensity of the therapy. By comparing the length and intensity of various methods of therapies, it was proven that intensity is a better predictor of recovery than the method of therapy used.&lt;ref name='Sanjit'&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1161/01.STR.0000062343.64383.D0|pmid= 12649521|title= Intensity of Aphasia Therapy, Impact on Recovery * Aphasia Therapy Works!|journal=Stroke|year=2003|first=Bhogal|last=Sanjit|author2=Robert Teasell|author3=Mark Speechley|author4=Martin Albert|volume=34|issue=4|pages=987â993|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
In most individuals with expressive aphasia, the majority of recovery is seen within the first year following a stroke or injury. The majority of this improvement is seen in the first four weeks in therapy following a stroke and slows thereafter.&lt;ref name='Bakheit' /&gt; However, this timeline will vary depending upon the type of stroke experienced by the patient. Patients who experienced an ischemic stroke may recover in the days and weeks following the stroke, and then experience a plateau and gradual slowing of recovery. On the contrary, patients who experienced a hemorrhagic stroke experience a slower recovery in the first 4â8 weeks, followed by a faster recovery which eventually stabilizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introduction to Neurogenic Communication Disorders|last = Manasco|first = M. Hunter|publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous factors impact the recovery process and outcomes. Site and extent of lesion greatly impacts recovery. Other factors that may affect prognosis are age, education, gender, and motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Cynthia K.|date=2000|title=Neuroplasticity: Evidence from Aphasia|url=|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|volume=|pages=33 (4): 357â366|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupation, handedness, personality, and emotional state may also be associated with recovery outcomes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Studies have also found that prognosis of expressive aphasia correlates strongly with the initial severity of impairment.&lt;ref name="Pedersen" /&gt; However, it has been seen that continued recovery is possible years after a stroke with effective treatment.&lt;ref name="Meinzer" /&gt; Timing and intensity of treatment is another factor that impacts outcomes. Research suggests that even in later stages of recovery, intervention is effective at improving function, as well as, preventing loss of function.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raymer|first=Anastasia|date=February 2008|title=Translational Research in Aphasia: from Neuroscience to Neurorehabilitation|url=|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|volume=51|pages=259â275|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike receptive aphasia, patients with expressive aphasia are aware of their errors in language production. This may further motivate a person with expressive aphasia to progress in treatment, which would affect treatment outcomes.&lt;ref name="Bakheit" /&gt; On the other hand, awareness of impairment may lead to higher levels of frustration, depression, anxiety, or social withdrawal, which have been proven to negatively affect a person's chance of recovery.&lt;ref name="Code"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Code|first=C|last2=Hemsley|first2=G|last3=Herrmann|first3=M|year=1999|title=The emotional impact of aphasia|url=|format=|journal=Semin Speech Lang|volume=20|issue=1|pages=19â31|doi=10.1055/s-2008-1064006|pmid=10100374|id=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expressive aphasia was first identified by the French neurologist [[Paul Broca]]. By examining the brains of deceased individuals having acquired expressive aphasia in life, he concluded that language ability is localized in the ventroposterior region of the frontal lobe. One of the most important aspects of Paul Broca's discovery was the observation that the loss of proper speech in expressive aphasia is due to the brain's loss of ability to produce language, as opposed to the mouth's loss of ability to produce words.&lt;ref name="Purves" /&gt;

The discoveries of Paul Broca were made during the same period of time as the German Neurologist [[Carl Wernicke]], who was also studying brains of aphasiacs post-mortem and identified the region now known as [[Wernicke's area]]. Discoveries of both men contributed to the concept of localization, which states that specific brain functions are all localized to a specific area of the brain. While both men made significant contributions to the field of aphasia, it was Carl Wernicke who realized the difference between patients with aphasia that could not produce language and those that could not comprehend language (the essential difference between expressive and [[receptive aphasia]]).&lt;ref name="Purves" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Annual report of the Director to the Board of Trustees for the year .. (1906) (17809550884).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Stanley Field, Field Museum President, 1906]]
The Field Museum and its collections originated from the 1893 [[Worldâs Columbian Exposition]] and the artifacts displayed at the fair.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2518/ |title = Port of Aden from the Sea |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = December 1894 |accessdate = 2013-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2017}} In order to house the exhibits and collections assembled for the 1893 Chicago Worldâs Fair for future generations, [[Edward Ayer]] convinced the merchant [[Marshall Field]] to fund the establishment of a museum.&lt;ref name=Lockwood&gt;{{cite book|last=Lockwood|first=F.C.|title=The life of Edward E. Ayer.|year=1929|publisher=AC McClurg|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally titled the ''Columbian Museum of Chicago'' in honor of its origins, the Field Museum was incorporated by the State of Illinois on September 16, 1893, for the purpose of the "accumulation and dissemination of knowledge, and the preservation and exhibition of artifacts illustrating art, archaeology, science and history."&lt;ref name="Farrington1930"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farrington|first=OC|title=A Brief History of Field Museum from 1893 to 1930|journal=Field Museum News|year=1930|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1, 3|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/4376562}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Columbian Museum of Chicago occupied the only building remaining from the World's Columbian Exposition in Jackson Park, the Palace of Fine Arts, which now houses the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]].&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=EP|title=Museums in Motion: An Introduction to the History and Functions of Museums|year=1979|publisher=American Association for State and Local History|location=Nashville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the museum's name was changed from Columbian Museum of Chicago to ''Field Museum of Natural History'' to honor its first major benefactor, Marshall Field, and to reflect its focus on the natural sciences.&lt;ref name="Annual Report"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Field Museum of Natural History|title=Annual Report of the Director to the Board of Trustees for the Year 1906|year=1907|volume=3|issue=1|pages=8â9|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/4350936}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period from 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Field|first=S.|title=Address of Mr. Stanley Field, president of the Museum|year=1943|publisher=Field Museum Press|location=Chicago|pages=3â5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Field|first=S.|title=Fifty years of progress|journal=Field Museum News|year=1943|volume=14|issue=9/10|pages=3â10}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1966,&lt;ref name=webber66&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webber|first=EL|title=Field Museum Again: name change honors Field Family|journal=Field Museum of Natural History Bulletin|year=1966|volume=37|issue=3|pages=2â3|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/4188067#page/2/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; the museum was known as the Chicago Natural History Museum.
In 1921, the Museum moved from its original location in [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]] to its present site on Chicago Park District property near downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Field Museum Changes Locations|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/field_museum_library/sets/72157614806438040/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By the late 1930s the Field emerged as one of the three premier museums in the United States, the other two being the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH, New York) and the National Museum of Natural History (Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC).&lt;ref name=Coleman&gt;{{cite book|last=Coleman|first=LV|title=The Museums in America: A critical study, Volumes 1-3.|year=1939|publisher=The American Association of Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Field Museum has maintained its reputation through continuous growth, expanding the scope of collections and its scientific research output, in addition to the its award-winning exhibitions, outreach publications, and programs.&lt;ref name=Williams1973 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nitecki&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nitecki|first=M|title=Field Museum of Natural History|journal=ASC Newsletter|year=1980|volume=8|issue=5|pages=61â70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NashFeinman /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=L|title=An explorer's guide to the Field Museum|year=1998|publisher=The Field Museum|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Field Museum is part of Chicagoâs lakefront [[Museum Campus]] that includes the [[John G. Shedd Aquarium]] and the [[Adler Planetarium]].&lt;ref name=MIP /&gt;

In 2015, it became public that an employee had defrauded the museum of $900,000 over a seven-year period to 2014.&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/museums/ct-field-museum-employee-theft-20151211-story.html |title=Former Field Museum employee accused of stealing $900,000 over 7 years  |last=Steve Johnson |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |publication-date=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sue the ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' ===
[[File:Sue 2018.jpg|thumb|''Sue'', the largest and most complete (90%) ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' skeleton currently known]]
{{Main|Sue (dinosaur)}}
On May 17, 2000, the Field Museum unveiled ''[[Sue (dinosaur)|Sue]]'', the most complete and best-preserved ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' [[fossil]] yet discovered.

An examination of the bones revealed that Sue died at age 28, a record for the fossilized remains of a ''T. rex'' until [[Trix (dinosaur)|Trix]] was found in 2013..

==Scientific collections==
Professionally managed and maintained specimen and artifact collections, such as those at the Field Museum of Natural History, are a major research resource for the national and international scientific community, supporting extensive research that tracks environmental changes, benefits homeland security, public health and safety, and serves taxonomy and systematics research.&lt;ref name=Shaffer1998&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaffer|first=HB|author2=RN Fisher |author3=C Davidson |title=The role of natural history collections in documenting species declines|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|year=1998|volume=13|issue=1|pages=27â30|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01177-4|pmid=21238186}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of Field Museumâs collections rank among the top ten collections in the world, e.g., the bird skin collection ranks fourth worldwide;&lt;ref name=Banks1973&gt;{{cite journal|last=Banks|first=RC |author2=Clench, MH |author3=Barlow JC|title=Bird collections in the United States and Canada|journal=Auk|year=1973|volume=90|pages=136â170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowther1995|first=P|title=Ornithology at the Field Museum.

The scientific collections of the Field Museum originate from the specimens and artifacts assembled between 1891 and 1893 for the World Columbian Exposition.&lt;ref name=Nitecki /&gt;&lt;ref name=Farrington1930 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Meyer1905&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyer|first=AB|title=Studies of the museums and kindred institutions of New York City, Albany, Buffalo, and Chicago, with notes on some European institutions [published in English, translated from German, in-depth comparative review of Field Museum exhibits, collections and operations around 1899- 1900]|date=1905|publisher=Smithsonian Institution, Government Printing office, No 138|pages=311â608}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collier1969&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collier|first=D|title=Chicago Comes of Age: The World's Columbian Exposition and the Birth of Field Museum|journal=Field Museum of Natural History Bulletin|date=1969|volume=40|issue=5|pages=2â7|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/4375358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anon1894&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anonymous|title=An historical and descriptive account of the Field Columbian Museum|journal=Field Columbian Museum, Chicago, Pub. 1|date=1894|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1â91|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/14209#/summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Already at its founding, the Field Museum had a large anthropological collection.&lt;ref name=Conn2010 /&gt;
A large number of the early natural history specimens were purchased from Wardâs Natural History Establishment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ward's Natural Science Establishment Papers |url=https://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=1181 |date=1876â1988 |publisher=[[University of Rochester]] Libraries |accessdate=June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Rochester, New York. An extensive acquisition program, including large expeditions conducted by the museumâs curatorial staff resulted in substantial collection growth.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nitecki /&gt;&lt;ref name=Akeley1920&gt;{{cite book|last=Akeley|first=C|title=In Brightest Africa|year=1920|publisher=Garden City Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first 50 years of the museumâs existence, over 440 Field Museum expeditions acquired specimens from all parts of the world.&lt;ref name=Field1943address&gt;{{cite book|last=Field|first=S|title=Address of Mr. Stanley Field, president of the Museum|year=1943|publisher=in: Three Addresses, Field Museum Press|location=Chicago|pages=3â5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, material was added through purchase, such as the [[Herman Strecker|Strecker]] butterfly collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Butterfly and Moth Collection: Herman Strecker Collection |url=http://archive.fieldmuseum.org/butterfly/herman.htm |date=2007 |publisher=The Field Museum |access-date=January 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1908 for example.
Extensive specimen material and artifacts were given to the museum by collectors and donors, such as the Boone collection of over 3,500 East Asian artifacts, consisting of books, prints and various objects. In addition, "orphaned collections" were and are taken in from other institutions such as universities that change their academic programs away from collections-based research. For example, already beginning in 1907, Field Museum accepted substantial botanical specimen collections from universities such as University of Chicago, Northwestern University and University of Illinois at Chicago, into its [[herbarium]]. These specimens are maintained and continuously available for researchers worldwide.&lt;ref name=Nitecki /&gt; Targeted collecting in the US and abroad for research programs of the curatorial and collection staff continuously add high quality specimen material and artifacts; e.g., [[Robert F. Inger|Dr. Robert Inger]]âs collection of frogs from Borneo as part of his research into the ecology and biodiversity of the Indonesian fauna.&lt;ref name="Resetar &amp; Voris" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Emerson1989&gt;{{cite journal|last=Emerson|first=SB|title=Introduction, in: Emerson, S.B.

Collecting of specimens and acquisition of artifacts is nowadays subject to clearly spelled-out policies and standards, with the goal to acquire only materials and specimens for which the provenance can be established unambiguously. All collecting of biological specimens is subject to proper collecting and export permits; frequently, specimens are returned to their country of origin after study. Field Museum stands among the leading institutions developing such ethics standards and policies; Field Museum was an early adopter of voluntary repatriation practices of ethnological and archaeological artifacts.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;&lt;ref name=Conn2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Conn|first=S|title=Do museums still need objects?|date=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-4190-7|pages=262 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection care and management===
Field Museum collections are professionally managed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fieldmuseum.org/explore/department/conserving-collections|title=Conserving Our Collections|work=The Field Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; by collection managers and conservators, who are highly skilled in preparation and preservation techniques. In fact, numerous maintenance and collection management tools were and are being advanced at Field Museum. For example, Carl Akeleyâs development of taxidermy excellence produced the first natural-looking mammal and bird specimens for exhibition as well as for study.&lt;ref name="Bodry-Sanders1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bodry-Sanders|first=P|title=Carl Akeley: Africaâs collector, Africaâs savior|year=1990|publisher=Paragon House|location=New York|pages=289 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Field Museum curators developed standards and best practices for the care of collections.&lt;ref name=Solem1980&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solem|first=A|title=Standards for malacological collections|journal=Curator|year=1980|volume=24|issue=1|pages=19â28|doi=10.1111/j.2151-6952.1981.tb00568.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservators at the Field Museum have made notable contributions to the [[Preventive conservation|preservation of artifacts]] including the use of pheromone trapping for control of webbing clothes moths.&lt;ref name=Norton1996&gt;{{cite book|last=Norton|first=RE|title=A case history of managing outbreaks of Webbing Clothes Moth (Tineola bisselliella)|year=1996|publisher=Preprints of the ICOM C-C 11th Triennial Meeting|location=Paris:ICOM-CC|pages=61â67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a modern collections-bearing institution, the vast majority of the scientific specimens and artifact are stored in specially designed collection cabinets, placed in containers made of archival materials, with labels printed on acid-free paper, and specimens and artifact are stored away from natural light to avoid fading. Preservation fluids are continuously monitored and in many collections humidity and temperature are controlled to ensure the long-term preservation of the specimens and artifacts. Field Museum was an early adopter of positive-pressure based approaches to control of environment in display cases,&lt;ref name=Michalski1885&gt;{{cite journal|last=Michalski|first=S|title=A relative humidity control module|journal=Museum (UNESCO)|year=1985|volume=146|pages=85â88}}&lt;/ref&gt; using control modules for humidity control in several galleries where room-level humidification was not practical.&lt;ref name=SeaseAnderson1994&gt;{{cite book|last=Sease, C Anderson|first=C|title=Preventive conservation at the Field Museum"  Preventive conservation: practice, theory and research.

===Collection records===
[[File:Museo Field, Chicago, Illinois, Estados Unidos, 2012-10-20, DD 08.jpg|thumb|Night view of the exterior of the museum.]]
Collection management requires meticulous record keeping. Handwritten ledgers captured specimen and artifact data in the past. Field Museum was an early adopter of computerization of collection data beginning in the late 1970.&lt;ref name=Nitecki /&gt;&lt;ref name=NSFaward1992&gt;{{cite web|last=National Science Foundation|title=The Assessment of the Needs of Free-Standing Museums for the Computerization of Collections Management and Related Research, BSR-9118843, award summary|url=http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=9118843&amp;HistoricalAwards=false|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Field Museum contributes its digitized collection data to a variety of online groups and platforms, such as: HerpNet, VertNet and Antweb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antweb.org/|title=AntWeb|work=antweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Biodiversity Information Facility or GBif,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gbif.org/|title=Free and Open Access to Biodiversity Data - GBIF.org|work=gbif.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. All Field Museum collection databases are unified and currently maintained in KE EMu software system. The research value of digitized specimen data and georeferenced locality data is widely acknowledged,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idigbio.org/|title=iDigBio Home|work=iDigBio}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling analyses of distribution shifts due to climate changes, land use changes and others.&lt;ref name=Suarez2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suarez|first=AV|author2=ND Tsutsui|title=The value of museum collections for research and society|journal=BioScience|date=2004|volume=54|pages=66â74|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0066:tvomcf]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection use===
During the World's Columbian Exposition, all acquired specimens and objects were on display;&lt;ref name=Meyer1905 /&gt;  the purpose of the Worldâs Fair was exhibition of these materials. For example, right after opening of the Columbian Museum of Chicago the [[mollusk]] collection occupied one entire exhibit hall, displaying 3,000 species of mollusks on about 1,260 square feet. By 1910, 20,000 shell specimens were on display, with an additional 15,000 âin storageâ.&lt;ref name=Rea1910&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rea|first=PM|title=A directory of American Museums of Art, History and Science|journal=Bulletin of the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences|date=1910|volume=10|issue=1|pages=3â360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In todayâs museum, only a small fraction of the specimens and artifacts are publicly displayed. The vast majority of specimens and artifacts are used by a wide range of people in the museum and around the world. Field Museum curatorial faculty and their graduate students and postdoctoral trainees use the collections in their research and in training e.g., in formal high school and undergraduate training programs. Researchers from all over the world can search online for particular specimens and request to borrow them, which are shipped routinely under defined and published loan policies, to ensure that the specimens remain in good condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fieldmuseum.org/explore/department/zoology/invertebrates/collections|title=Invertebrates|work=The Field Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2012, Field Museumâs Zoology collection processed 419 specimen loans, shipping over 42,000 specimens to researchers, per its Annual Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/explore/collections-and-research-annual-reports|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014042217/http://fieldmuseum.org/explore/collections-and-research-annual-reports|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-10-14|title=Collections and Research Annual Reports|work=The Field Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The collection specimens are an important cornerstone of research infrastructure in that each specimen can be re-examined and with the advancement of analytic techniques, new data can be gleaned from specimens that may have been collected more than 150 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/explore/our-collections|title=Research &amp; Collections|work=The Field Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Library==
The library at the Field Museum was organized in 1893 for the museum's scientific staff, visiting researchers, students, and members of the general public as an resource for research, exhibition development and educational programs. The 275,000 volumes of the Main Research Collections concentrate on biological systematics, environmental and evolutionary biology, anthropology, botany, geology, archaeology, museology and related subjects.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The Field Museum Library includes the following collections:

===Ayer collection===
This private collection of [[Edward E. Ayer]], the first president of the museum, contains virtually all the important works in the history of [[ornithology]] and is especially rich in color-illustrated works.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Laufer Collection===
 
The working collection of Dr. [[Berthold Laufer]], Americaâs first [[sinologist]] and Curator of Anthropology until his death in 1934 consists of about 7,000 volumes in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], and numerous Western languages on anthropology, [[archaeology]], religion, science, and travel.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Photo Archives===
The Photo Archives contain over 250,000 images in the areas of anthropology, botany, geology and zoology and documents the history and architecture of the museum, its exhibitions, staff and scientific expeditions. In 2008 two collections from the Photo Archives became available via the ''Illinois Digital Archives'' (IDA): The World's Columbian Exposition of 1893&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idaillinois.org/cdm4/browse.php?CISOROOT=%2Ffmnh|title=World's Columbian Exposition of 1893|work=idaillinois.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Urban Landscapes of Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Urban Landscapes of Illinois: Digitization of Original Glass Negatives |url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/urbanlandscapes/ |date=2008 |publisher=The Field Museum |accessdate=June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, the Photo Archives became part of the Flickr Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/field_museum_library/|title=Flickr: The Field Museum Library's Photostream| work=Flickr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karl P. Schmidt Memorial Herpetological Library===
 
The Karl P. Schmidt Memorial Herpetological Library, named for [[Karl Patterson Schmidt]] is a research library containing over 2,000 herpetological books and an extensive reprint collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Division of Amphibians and Reptiles|url=http://fieldmuseum.org/explore/department/zoology/amphibians-and-reptiles|publisher=The Field Museum|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and research==

The Field Museum offers opportunities for informal and more structured public learning. Exhibitions remain the primary means of informal education, but throughout its history the Museum has supplemented this approach with innovative educational programs. The Harris Loan Program, for example, begun in 1912, reaches out to children in Chicago area schools, offering artifacts, specimens, audiovisual materials, and activity kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harris.fieldmuseum.org/index/default.php |title=Harris Learning Collection |work=fieldmuseum.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231214313/http://harris.fieldmuseum.org/index/default.php |archivedate=2013-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Education, begun in 1922, offers classes, lectures, field trips, museum overnights and special events for families, adults and children.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  The Field has adopted production of the [[YouTube]] channel ''The Brain Scoop'', hiring its host [[Emily Graslie]] full-time as 'Chief Curiosity Correspondent'.&lt;ref name="Field Museum Staff Page"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/staff/profile/1146 |title=Staff - Emily Graslie|website=The Field Museum|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding the Field Museum has been an international leader in evolutionary biology and paleontology, and archaeology and ethnography.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} It has long maintained close links, including joint teaching, students, seminars, with the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Academic Training &amp; Research Education|url=https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/careers/academic-training-research-education|work=The Field Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional symposia and lectures, like the annual A. Watson Armour III Spring Symposium, present scientific results to the international scientific community and the public at large.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==''Fieldiana''==
The museum publishes four [[peer-reviewed]] [[monograph series]] issued under the collective title ''Fieldiana'', devoted to [[anthropology]], [[botany]], [[geology]] and [[zoology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/research_collections/fieldiana/ |title=  Fieldiana|accessdate=2008-01-26| publisher=Field Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monographs in these series are accessible at the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fieldiana |date=March 19, 2009 |url=https://archive.org/details/fieldiana |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular media==

===In television===
The museum was used in a 1986 [[McDonald's]] commercial entitled "Field Trip".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rad Universe|title=McDonald's "Field Trip" - 1986 Commercial|date=2012-11-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsVl1RhCrPc|accessdate=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2444">In any [[narrative]], the '''focal character''' is the [[Character (arts)|character]] on whom the [[audience]] is meant to place the majority of their interest and attention. They are almost always also the [[protagonist]] of the story; however, in cases where the "focal character" and "protagonist" are separate, the focal character's emotions and ambitions are not meant to be empathized with by the audience to as high an extent as the protagonist (this is the main difference between the two character terms). The focal character is mostly created to simply be the "excitement" of the story, though not necessarily the main character about whom the audience is emotionally concerned. The focal character is, more than anyone else, "the person on whom the spotlight focuses; the center of attention; the man whose reactions dominate the screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

For example, in [[Gaston Leroux]]'s ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'', the protagonist is [[Christine DaaÃ©]] (the audience is concerned mostly with her emotions, aims, and well-being), while the focal character is the "[[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Phantom]]" (the audience is concerned mostly with the [[Attractiveness|allure]] of his actions and reactions&amp;mdash;though to some degree, later on, his emotions as well). In another example, in "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], the protagonist of the story is unnamed and does not have a great effect on the story, though he is present. He does not show much emotion throughout the story, and the reader is not as interested in him. The focal character of the story is Roderick Usher, whom the reader cares for more greatly and follows his condition and emotions more.

The focal character is also not necessarily the same thing as the [[viewpoint character]], through whose perspective the story is seen. In Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s works of [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Doctor Watson|Watson]] is the viewpoint character, but the story revolves around Holmes, making him the focal character.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9160">The '''Gender  Empowerment Measure''' ('''GEM''') is an [[index (statistics)|index]] designed to [[Measures of gender equality|measure of gender equality]]. GEM is the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s attempt to measure the extent of [[gender inequality]] across the globe's countries, based on estimates of women's relative [[economic income]], participations in high-paying positions with economic power, and access to professional and parliamentary positions. It was introduced at the same time as the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI) but measures topics like empowerment that are not covered by that index.

== History ==
In 1995 in the ''[[Human Development Report]]'' commissioned by the [[United Nations Development Program]] set-out to create two new measurement indices for measuring development. Their aim was to add to the [[Human Development Index]] by way of including a gender dimension in the measure. They were created in order to rival the traditional income-focused measures of development such as the [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) and the [[Gross National Product]] (GNP). [[Mahbub ul Haq]], the first director of the Human Development Report Office, established several principles for the newly emerging measure including provisions that it had to be simple, had to be represented as a single number, had to be easily calculated, had to yield numbers that were internationally comparable, had to use numbers available on a yearly basis and had to use numbers that were easily interpretable. The resulting measures that were created were the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI) and the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM). The GEM, the more specialized of the two, is focused on indicating the relative [[empowerment]] of women in a given country.&lt;ref name="Gender"&gt;Klasen S. UNDP's Gender-Related Measures: Some Conceptual Problems and Possible Solutions. Journal of Human Development [serial online]. July 2006;7(2):243-274. Available from: EconLit with Full Text, Ipswich, MA. Accessed September 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition and calculation ==
The GEM was designed to measure "whether women and men are able to actively participate in economic and political life and take part in decision-making" (UNDP, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;73)(Klasen 257). The GEM tends to be more agency focused (what people are actually able to do) than well-being focused (how people feel or fare in the grand scheme of things).&lt;ref name="Gender" /&gt; The GEM is determined using three basic indicators: Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments, percentage of women in economic [[decision making]] positions (incl. administrative, managerial, professional and technical occupations) and female share of income (earned incomes of males vs. females).&lt;ref name="What"&gt;Betata, H. C. (2007). What is missing in measures of women's empowerment?. Journal of Human Development , 7(2), 221-241.&lt;/ref&gt; The GEM is thought to be a valuable policy instrument because it allows certain dimensions that  were previously difficult to compare between countries to come into international comparison.&lt;ref name="Measuring"&gt;Charmes J, Wieringa S. Measuring Women's Empowerment: An Assessment of the Gender- Related Development Index and the Gender Empowerment Measure. Journal of Human Development [serial online]. November 2003;4(3):419-435. Available from: EconLit with Full Text, Ipswich, MA. Accessed September 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debates ==
As time passes, and these measures (the GDI and the GEM) are applied year after year, debate has arisen over whether or not they have been as influential in promoting gender-sensitive development as was hoped when they were first created. Some of the major criticisms of both measures includes that they are highly specialized and difficult to interpret, often misinterpreted, suffer from large data gaps, do not provide accurate comparisons across countries, and try to combine too many development factors into a single measure. The concern then arises that if these indices are not well informed, then their numbers might hide more than they reveal.&lt;ref name="Gender" /&gt;

In terms of the GEM in particular, it is often said to represent an elite bias.&lt;ref name="Gender" /&gt; It has been accused of measuring inequality only among the most educated and economically advantaged women and to focus mainly on the higher echelons of society.&lt;ref name="What" /&gt; Women in grassroots organizations or at the local political level are not reflected, as well as work in lower levels of employment or in the informal sector, where many women in poor and developing countries are forced to seek employment.&lt;ref name="Gender" /&gt;  Furthermore, statistical information (data) is not very readily available for many of the indicators in the GEM. Not many less-developed countries collect reliable data on women's involvement in economic participation or labor involvement. As a result, the GEM is only reliable for very highly developed countries which do collect those statistics. It is also often argued that the number of women in parliament isn't an adequate indication of gender empowerment progress in a given country because many times [[feminists]] are considered political liabilities, and as such, female politicians do not always promote female interests. On the other hand, however, information regarding the number of parliamentary seats held by women is very easy to obtain, and very hard to alter, making it one of the more reliable sources of data in the measure. Another criticism of the GEM is its failure to address the issue of female control over their bodies and sexuality, which some argue is an important source of female empowerment and as such should be included in the measure.&lt;ref name="What" /&gt; Additionally, the GEM has also been criticized for being far too dependent on the income component of the measure for determining the overall GEM score.&lt;ref name="Measuring" /&gt;

== Suggestions for improving ==

===Suggested alterations===
{{One source section|date=January 2016}}
Many suggestions have been made to alter the GEM.  It has been suggested that the GEM be altered to include female representation in local government instead of only national government to make it less elite. Furthermore, it has been recommended that it should be revised to reflect female participation in political activities such as voting.  Additionally, it has been recommended that a component regarding women's control over their own bodies and sexuality be added by measuring availability of [[birth control]] and the right to abortion.  It has also been suggested that the GEM could be altered to include the proportion of females who are in [[extreme poverty]] as opposed to the proportion of parliamentary positions held by females.  Lastly, it has been suggested that the GEM could be altered to include female levels of unemployment.&lt;ref name="What" /&gt;  Other suggestions include coming up with different ways to deal with the earned income part so as to make it a more straightforward mode of measurement.&lt;ref name="Reforming"&gt;Klasen, Stephan1; Schuler, Dana. Reforming the Gender-Related Development Index and the Gender Empowerment Measure: Implementing Some Specific Proposals. Feminist  Economics. January 2011 (1) 1 - 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggestions have also been made to replace the GEM as a whole.&lt;ref name="What" /&gt; One such suggestion is the calculation of separate [[Human Development Index]]es for males and females&lt;ref name="Gender" /&gt; which would provide a more straightforward picture of gender inequality (first suggested by Halis Akder in 1994).&lt;ref name="Reforming" /&gt; Another suggestion is to create a Gender-Gap Measure.&lt;ref name="Gender" /&gt; In 2003 Charmes and Wieringa came up with the Women's Empowerment Matrix which considers six spheres (physical, socio-cultural, religious, political, legal and economic) as well as six levels: individual, household, community, state, regional, and global. The GEE is another suggested alternative to the GEM, this measure would include legal framework and protection of women's rights, as well as other important areas of women's empowerment that are overlooked by the GEM like women's movements, public attitudes, and equal rights.&lt;ref name="What" /&gt; Lastly, in the 2010 [[Human Development Report]], a new measuring mechanism was created entitled the [[Gender Inequality Index]]. This new experimental measure considers three dimensions: Reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation which aim to ameliorate some of the problems associated with the GEM.&lt;ref name="Reforming" /&gt;

== Description ==
The container consists of a vessel, usually in terracotta, perforated to allow the passage of air, polished on the inside to prevent escape and with a lid to seal the top. Inside there are two or more shelves placed against the vessel walls and additional holes in the bottom of the vessel, generally more numerous than those on the sides.&lt;ref name=wander/&gt;  By inducing hibernation via darkness and confinement, the glirarium would cause the dormouse to fatten.&lt;ref name=LacusCurtius/&gt;&lt;ref name=wander/&gt;

Steinsland specialises in [[Germanic paganism|pre-Christian religion]], the associated [[Old Norse]] texts and [[mythology]] and the [[Christianization|conversion]] of Scandinavia.&lt;ref name=forskning/&gt; At both Oslo and TromsÃ¸, she made Norse religion a main subject within the history of religion programme.&lt;ref name=Apollon/&gt; She is a member of the group for theology and religious studies in the Academy of Science and Letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26848/artikkel/vis.html?tid=27645|title=Gruppe 8: Religionsvitenskap og teologi|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a historian of religion, her publications take [[Norsemen|Norse]] paganism seriously and present it in a non-traditional light as having been still strong and vital when it encountered Christianity.&lt;ref name=PROSA/&gt; In 2005 she published a wideranging introductory book, ''NorrÃ¸n religion'' (Norse religion), which presents the subject from the perspective of myth and praxis. In her influential 1989 [[PhD]] dissertation, ''Det hellige bryllup og norrÃ¸n kongeideologi: en analyse av hierogami-myten i SkÃ­rnismÃ¡l, Ynglingatal, HÃ¡leygjatal og HyndluljÃ³d'' (the [[sacred marriage]] and Norse ideology of kingship: an analysis of the myth of the ''hieros gamos'' in ''[[SkÃ­rnismÃ¡l]]'', ''[[Ynglingatal]]'', ''[[HÃ¡leygjatal]]'' and ''[[HyndluljÃ³Ã°]]''), she reinterpreted the sacred marriage between a god and a [[jÃ¶tunn|giantess]] as a power [[myth]] legitimising rulership rather than a fertility myth; she specialises in the interpretation of written sources but has also made extensive use of [[archaeology]] and frequently takes an interdisciplinary approach.&lt;ref name=PROSA/&gt; She has also emphasised the female aspect of pre-Christian religion,&lt;ref name=Apollon/&gt; particularly in her 1997 book ''Eros og dÃ¸d i norrÃ¸ne myter'' ([[Eros (concept)|Eros]] and death in Norse myths), in which she contrasts the sexualisation of death in, for example, references to drowning as being embraced by the sea goddess [[RÃ¡n]] with the post-conversion view of female sexuality as shameful.&lt;ref name=PROSA/&gt;

Steinsland has also readily written [[Op-ed|newspaper opinion article]]s,&lt;ref name=forskning/&gt; for example in 2000 taking the position that [[Thor Heyerdahl]]'s [[Odin]] expedition to [[Azerbaijan]] was a "charade" orchestrated by [[Snorri Sturluson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tux1.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/d176403.htm "Heyerdahls og Odins 'narrespill': Med Thor Heyerdahls nye Odin-prosjekt er et 800 Ã¥r gammelt 'narrespill' satt i scene, en gedigen skÃ¸yerstrek, regissert av Snorre Sturlason"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716233921/http://tux1.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/d176403.htm |date=2011-07-16 }}, Meninger - Kronikk, ''Aftenposten'' 24 November 2000, retrieved January 14, 2011 {{no icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hugo Winckler''' (4 July 1863 &amp;ndash; 19 April 1913) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Archeology|archaeologist]] and historian who uncovered the capital of the [[Hittites|Hittite]] Empire ([[Hattusa]]) at [[BoÄazkale]], [[Turkey]].

A student of the languages of the ancient [[Middle East]], he wrote extensively on [[Assyria]]n [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] and the [[Old Testament]], compiled a history of [[Babylonia]] and Assyrian that was published in 1891, and translated both the [[Code of Hammurabi]] and the [[Amarna letters]].  In 1904, he was appointed professor of Oriental languages at the [[University of Berlin]].

==Education==
Winckler studied at the University of Berlin with [[Eberhard Schrader]], founder of the German Assyriology. He was awarded his doctorate on 24 June 1886, for his work on the cuneiform texts of Sargon.

==Career==

===Teaching===
Winckler became a lecturer at the [[University of Berlin]] in 1891. In 1904, he was appointed [[Academic ranks in Germany|Extraordinary Professor]] of Oriental languages.&lt;ref name="Jewish Virtual"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0021_0_20954.html Jewish Virtual Library, Profile of Hugo Winckler]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excavations===
Winckler began excavations at [[BoÄazkale]] in 1906 with support from the German Orient Society together with Ottoman archeologist [[Theodore Makridi]].  His excavations revealed a stockpile of thousands of hardened clay tablets, many written in the hitherto unknown [[Hittite language]], that allowed Winckler to draw a preliminary outline of Hittite history in the 14th and 13th centuries BC.  Winckler continued excavations at the site until 1912, during which time his finds proved that the city was once the capital of a great empire.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/Hugo-Winckler Britannica - Hugo Winckler]&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets, known as the [[BogazkÃ¶y Archive]] were deciphered in 1924 by the [[Czechs|Czech]] scholar [[BedÅich HroznÃ½]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia.com"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-Winckler.html Encyclopedia.com Winckler, Hugo]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact===
[[Otto Rank]], in [[Art and Artist]], describes Winckler as the "rediscoverer of the ancient Oriental world picture in the fifth to sixth millennium B.C.&lt;ref name="Geschichte Israels"&gt;Geschichte Israels, Part II, 1900, pp. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Winckler's popular description: "The whole universe is the great world, the macrocosm; its parts are small universes in themselves, microcosms.  Such a *microcosm* is man, who is himself an image of the universe and a perfect being.  But the great universe is likewise a man, and as it is `God,' God has human form.  *`In his own image,'* therefore, was man created.  This was still the belief of medieval medicine, which we know to have had (chiefly for the purpose of bleeding) a method of dividing up the human body according to the twelve signs of the zodiac (head, ram; neck, bull; arms, twins; and so on).  On this `scientific' treatment of a patient was based... "

Rank also wrote in  ''Art and Artist'', regarding the significance of macroscosmic symbolism, "In the first, and still the best, summary of this sort, which Winckler gives us in the chapter "Myth, Legend, and Play" of his popular account of the intellectual culture of ancient Babylon, the fundamental fact is established that the festivals connected with various games had all a seasonal character, with a definite calendar as their basis.  In these festivals and the associated games, "the events in heaven which the festival represents--for example, the death and rebirth of the deity, the victory over the powers of darkness, the dragon--are represented and played before the people"&lt;ref&gt;Geschichte Israels, Part II, 1900, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Invincible Super Man Zambot 3''}} is a [[Super Robot]] [[anime]] series created by [[Yoshiyuki Tomino]] and [[Yoshitake Suzuki]], featuring character design by [[Yoshikazu Yasuhiko]] and produced by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]]. It was first broadcast on Japanese TV in 1977. The series lasted for 23 episodes.

== Story ==
There once existed a planet named Beal, until it was wiped out by the mysterious entity known as Gaizok.  The few remaining survivors escaped to Earth and split into three families, named Jin, Kamie, and Kamikita respectively.  While attempting to start a new life, the collectively known "Jin Family" prepared for the inevitable Gaizok invasion on Earth and its giant mechanical beasts known as "Mecha Boosts".  In order to defend their new home, they have built three vehicles which when combined form the mighty Zambot 3.  The Jin Family must not only defend against Gaizok attacks, but also harsh criticisms from the very people they protect, who blame the Jin Family for the invasion in the first place.

The show begins as a typical Super Robot anime, but effort to putting realistic explanation to the "strangeness" seen in the precedent anime like "why young children are chosen for the pilots" etc., trial to depict civilians' sufferings under the invasion of aliens, and also with the cruel '''Human Bomb''' episodes middle of the show and the tragic end that most protagonists are killed, this work is regarded as the most important forerunner to the [[Real Robot]] anime.

Director [[Yoshiyuki Tomino]]'s nickname, "Kill 'Em All Tomino" originates from this work.

==Characters==

===Jin Family===

====Zambot 3 Crew====
'''Kappei Jin''' is the main character of Zambot 3 and pilot of the Zambird/Zambo Ace as well as controlling the primary functions of the titular robot.  At 12 years old, Kappei is always eager to get into dangerous, high-risk situations, be it in battle against one of Gaizok's Mecha Boosts or against his rival KÅzuki.  While Kappei is generally willing to go into battle, he will at times run into an emotional dilemma, generally stemming from civilian backlash against the Beal-Seijin.  Kappei is also very athletic and a skilled martial artist.  His best friends are his pet dog, Chiyonishiki and the girls Aki and Michi. Out of the entire team, Kappei is the only member to survive the final battle, as UchÅ«ta and Keiko perish in a successful suicide attack, Chiyonishiki is killed when the Zambo Ace's right lower leg (which houses his cockpit) is destroyed, and the rest of the Jin Family dies when their ship burns up while they are giving Kappei time to escape.

'''Chiyonishiki''' is Kappei's pet dog [[akita inu]] and his faithful friend, who "copilots" Zambird alongside Kappei. [[Yoshinori Kanada]] of Studio Z misunderstood him as a robot dog, so there are some scenes which implicate his robotic nature.

'''UchÅ«ta Kamie''' is 15 years old and pilot of the Zambull.  While UchÅ«ta is more mature than Kappei, he is about as eager to jump into battle, to the point that early on in the series Kappei and UchÅ«ta would argue over who should be doing most of the fighting.  UchÅ«ta has to deal with a family that is not as devoted to the fight against Gaizok as himself. In the final battle, he and Keiko perish in a successful suicide attack.

'''Keiko Kamikita''' is 14 years old and pilot of the Zambase.  On the Kamikita's ranch, Keiko's hobbies are archery and horseback riding.  While not as overtly aggressive as her male teammates, Keiko is if anything more willing to fight Gaizok, even at times attempting to pilot despite bodily injury.  While Keiko has the strongest convictions of the team, she is also perhaps the most emotionally vulnerable.  One of Keiko's most famous lines is, "Please transform, and don't make a girl say 'please!'" In the final battle, she and UchÅ«ta perish in a successful suicide attack.

====Other Jin Family members====
'''Heizaemon Kamikita''' is Keiko's grandfather and commander of the King Beal.

'''Gengoroh Jin''' is Kappei's father.

'''Ichitaroh Jin''' is Kappei's older brother.

===Humans===
'''Shingo KÅzuki''' is 13 years old and the leader of a local gang of kids.  Shingo (most frequently referred to as KÅzuki in the series) is essentially Kappei's rival, as both have tendencies to play in the most dangerous ways possible, e.g. fighting each other with anchors.  Like Kappei, Shingo is a skilled martial artist.  Shingo is a civilian and does not pilot any anti-Gaizok vehicles, but he is nevertheless thrust into the middle of the conflict due to both circumstances beyond his control and through his own actions.   Shingo has a mother and a sister, Kaoru, of whom he is very protective.

'''Kaoru KÅzuki''' is Shingo's little sister.  Unlike most others, Kaoru sees the Jin Family and particularly Kappei as good people.

'''Aki''' is 12 years old and can be seen as Kappei's "love interest."  Along with her best friend, Michi, Kappei frequently takes them along on his adventures, both in and out of Zambird.  Aki is very sensible and confident, and will give Kappei a few harsh words if need be.  At the same time, she is rather impressed by Kappei and the Zambird.  The Zambot Archives book refers to Aki and Michi as the "Kappei Fan Club."

'''Michi''' is 12 years old and best friends with Aki.  Michi, like Aki, tends to follow Kappei for one reason or another.  Shyer and more reserved than Aki, Michi is usually worried about what will happen to them whenever Kappei does anything dangerous/stupid.  The Zambot Archives book refers to Aki and Michi as the "Kappei Fan Club."

===Gaizok===
'''Gaizok''' is the mysterious entity responsible for the destruction of the planet Beal.  He seeks to do the same to Earth as he did to Beal, and perhaps other planets as well.  No one knows Gaizok's true motives or even his true identity, including his subordinate, Killer the Butcher. In the last episodes, Gaizok is revealed to be an extremely evolved artificial intelligence, that was once created by an ancient, super-advanced civilization, with the task of destroying anyone that would display aggressive feelings. But, having turned mad with old age, Gaizok has come to the conclusion that every feelings are dangerous and must be suppressed, meaning the destruction of all sentient beings.

'''Killer the Butcher''' is the most prominent villain in Zambot 3.  Butcher is responsible for sending out Mecha Boosts to attack the Earth, particularly Japan.  Butcher is a rather eccentric villain, and is seen constantly indulging in luxuries, be it eating endless amounts of meat, trying on jewelry, or attempting to sun bathe despite being inside of the Bandok.  However, this extravagance does not make him any less ruthless.  Butcher was sent to kill the humans, and that's exactly what he plans to do.  Butcher's headquarters is the powerful mobile fortress, Bandok.

'''Gizzar''' is Butcher's right-hand man and field commander coming up with diabolical plots. Unlike Butcher he takes his job very seriously and is very thin, but he is still just as ruthless. Gizzar is often Butcher's whipping boy whenever something goes wrong.

'''Barettar''' is a field commander nearly identical to Gizzar except for muscular and has scars all over his face.

'''Zubutar''' is the Bandok's chief designer of the Mecha-Boosts.

'''Snai-Sworders''' are small snail-like reconnaissance robots used by Butcher to observe battles. They possess no offensive capabilities.

'''Bandok''' is the four-legged robot space fortress commanded by Butcher. For the first nine episodes it serves as only a headquarters near Earth's orbit where Mecha-Boosts are produced. In episode ten it comes to Earth and releases a series of Beltar Tanks to defend itself. After Mecha-Boost Tracid is destroyed, Zambot 3 attempts to attack only for a barrier to knock it away. In the next episode it is forced to flee back into space after being destroyed internally by Zambo Ace. Returns to Earth in episode 18 as the primary facility for converting humans into living bombs, keeping itself underwater at well over twelve hundred meters below the surface until Zambot 3 discovers its location. The head detaches itself and starts firing extremely large torpedoes at Zambot 3 from its mouth as well as stops the Moon Attack with an energy barrier. It retreats to space again in episode 19 after large quantities of damage and the energy barrier being destroyed by Zambot 3's Moon Attack and destruction of Mecha-Boost Gaidar. In episode 21 the Bandok uses well over two thousand space mines and homing missiles with eyeballs for nose cones called Gaizok Missiles to attack the King Beal as the Jin family approaches for the final battle. When King Beal is close enough, each arm of the Bandok fires a Bandok Cannon presumably just as powerful as the Ion Cannon. After 2nd Beal rams into its underside the main body is ultimately destroyed with the head being all that is left. In its final battle in episode 22 the head piloted by Butcher fires Bandok Missiles and eye lasers only for it to be finished off by the Ion Cannon.

'''Red Knight Deathcain''' and '''Blue Knight Heldyne''' are the two knights of Gaizok sealed within the Bandok as its guardians. Both appearing in episode 22 after most of the Bandok was destroyed, Butcher is forced into battle by Gaizok with both of these death personified knights as a last resort. Both appear as European knights on horses. Each one is armed with a small round shield that fires lightning bolts that can be combined for an extremely bright flash that launches swords and maces, although Deathcain possesses a sword while Heldyne possesses a double sided lance.

'''''Mecha-Boosts'''''

*'''Mecha-Boost Domira:''' Appears in episode 1. Appears as a humanoid with a chicken head and octopus arms. Uses tentacles armed with axes, energy blasts fired from the mouth, twin missiles from each hip, can extend its body using its stretchable midsection that also serves as the weak point. Killer The Butcher claims it is only a reconnaissance type.
*'''Mecha-Boost Zidobirar:''' Appears in episode 2. Appears as a large frilled lizard with a torso and arms of a human attached to it with pendulum style axes for hands that can be launched. After arriving on Earth via a meteor, it burrows underground and launches highly accurate fire balls from the mouth that can even curve to hit its target. Also armed with a horn on its forehead and each side of its frill as well as a mace-like tail. The neck from the humanoid torso serves as the weak point  and can fire a green energy ray used to detonate short range missiles before they reach it and also fires a blue sonic cannon.
*'''Mecha-Boost Gabidan:''' Appears in episode 3. First stage appears as a humanoid with a bird head and neck that can extend long distances, bird wings, meathook claws for hands and feet, and a face on its chest. Travels by levitation in a [[cumulonimbus cloud]] (most likely [[Cumulonimbus incus|Incus]] class) and fires a freezing ray for the mouth on its chest that instantly turns humans and buildings into ice, making them extremely fragile. Second stage appears as a phoenix with a large eye on its chest. It is armed with red lightning spawned from the mouth and a long range flamethrower also from the mouth.
*'''Mecha-Boost Doyozurar:''' Appears in episode 4. Appears as a tick with tentacled legs armed with pincers and a tentacled mouth with a face.

Tentacled mouth is armed with a flamethrower and missiles and can use its own teeth for quick strikes. Can rotate its body extremely fast to form a tornado and burrow underground for quick escapes. Doyozurar reappears in episode 20 with a no name Mecha-Boost, Garuchak, and Anmosgar.
*'''Mecha-Boost Garunge:''' Appears in episode 5. Appears as a [[house fly]] with a pedal-like dish around its neck later used to protect the head and a cannon on each shoulder. Armed with fire balls from the mouth, can use the pedal like dish can form into a horn while protecting the head in a similar fashion to Gabura from the original [[Ultraman]], a thick shell that can deflect regular laser attacks and projectiles as well as break the Zambo Cutter, can launch missiles from the cannons on its shoulders, and emit electrical pulses from its body. Its internal structure is exposed while its wings retract.
*'''Mecha-Boost Elegin:''' Appears in episode 6. Its tail appears as a yellow flower with tentacles instead of pedals, the rest of the body looks similar to a [[turtle]] except with a frill on its shell and a blade on each front leg. Armed with a jamming signal, black toxic gas from its tentacles, can launch purple buzzsaw discs from its flower that act like boomerangs, launches missiles from the front part of its shell which can be replaced with large bony spikes, and emits lightning-like toxic gas from its mouth. It can also swim extremely fast while underwater for quick escapes, levitate, and will regenerate from attacks so long as the energy compartments in its back and tail are functioning.
*'''Mecha-Boost Kumoganira:''' Appears in episode 7. Appears as a six-legged crab with a shower nozzle coming from the mouth. Armed with highly flammable purple gas, fire balls, and electric webs from its nozzle, thorny ropes from each claw that can emit electricity, a missile launcher in its forehead that can also fire drills that are rather weak, and claws thick enough to block the Zambot Buster. Moves entirely by using levitation.
*'''Mecha-Boost Garuchak:''' Appears in episode 8. Appears as a demonic bat with wings on its arms that grant it flight on its upper half and a [[jellyfish]] with a face and two squid whip tentacles on its lower half. Armed with a very powerful flamethrower from the mouth from the head on its upper body, skin is covered in an alien metal that can deflect or redirect attacks, sonic waves from the wings on its arms, and fires missiles from the mouth on its lower half. Can be destroyed if hit in the inside of the mouth on its upper half. Garuchak reappears in episode 20 with a no name Mecha-Boost, Doyozurar, and Anmosgar. Unlike the first version this one launches fire balls instead of missiles from the mouth on its lower half.
*'''Mecha-Boost Anmosgar''': Appears in episode 9. Appears as a turtle with dog ears, masks on each of its upper arms that can be launched as projectiles, and a tank from the waist down. Armed with a strong freeze gas from the mouth and will convert its body into highly magnetic timed hydrogen bombs if destroyed by combustion. Can fly and reform itself if the polarity of its bombs are unbalanced. Anmosgar reappears in episode 20 with a no name Mecha-Boost, Doyozurar, and Garuchak
*'''Mecha-Boost Tracid:''' Appears in episode 10. Appears as a two headed robot with two cannons on each dome scalp, a large [[arrowheads]] for the right hand and a drill for the left hand, and treads for the feet of each leg. Capable of breaking down its body down as well as reform into double barreled tanks called Beltar Tanks that can fire missile shells and lasers, can fire very strong missile shells from the double barreled cannons on the top of each head, has thick tank armor to project it from normal attacks, can regenerate its drill hand after it is fired, and arrowhead hand can be launched while attached to an electric cable that will shock whatever grabs the arrowhead. Tracid reappears in episode 20 with Doyozurar, Garuchak, and Anmosgar, however, unlike the others it is transported to Earth using a no name Mecha-Boost and combines from Beltar tanks after King Beal's Ion Cannon destroys it. Unlike the first version, this one can fly.
*'''Mecha-Boost Vibron:''' Appears in episode 11. Appears as a [[plesiosaur]] with tank treads on its shoulders, a mace tail capable of extending for constriction, and a hose for its mouth. Armed with a flamethrower in its hose mouth, missiles from in its front flippers, tank treads extend like whips that emit electricity as well as its tail, and an energy ray from its eyes used to destroy missiles. Moves entirely by using levitation.
*'''Mecha-Boost Mogundar:''' Appears in episode 12. Appears as an elephant with a drill instead of a trunk as well as a drill on its scalp, large bladed ears and pincers, holes around the front feet that are presumably missile pods, tank treads for back feet, and a dish-like tail. Armed with armor that allows it to survive crashing from orbit, missiles from its mouth, both drills on its face capable of regenerating after launching as well as explode like bombs, and can regenerate if torn to pieces into Mecha-Boost Harindar. Can jump very high into the air using its powerful legs.
*'''Mecha-Boost Harindar:''' Appears in episode 12. Appears very similar to [[Anguirus]] except with pincers at the mouth, five horns, three of which are on the nose, and tank treads for feet.

*'''Mecha-Boost BuuBon:''' Appears in episode 16. Appears as a jellyfish with an aircraft carrier of its head. Armed with a squad of mechanical sharks including one around 130 feet long, long extendable tentacles, green energy bolts from its head, and its hull is capable of deflecting Zambot 3's Zambot Cutter. The underside serves as its weak point, a simple attack will temporarily disable its levitation.
*'''Mecha-Boost Hirayangar:''' Appears in episode 17 with four no name mecha-boosts. Appears as a humanoid with rocket engines from the waist down, sharp claws for hands, a fly-trap mouth for a torso, and a series of eyes connected to very skinny stalks.

==Mechanical weapons and vehicles==

===Bealian machines===

====Zambot 3====
Zambot 3, along with the King Beal, are the primary defenses against the Gaizok invasion.  Zambot 3 is formed when the Zambird, Zambull and Zambase combine by a sequence called Zambot Combination.  There is a separate cockpit for each pilot. In the final battle, the Zambull and Zambase are destroyed in UchÅ«ta and Keiko's successful suicide attack, and the Zambo Ace is damaged beyond repair.

'''Height:''' 60 meters&lt;br&gt;
'''Weight:''' 500 tons&lt;br&gt;
'''Output:''' 350,000 horsepower (260 MW)&lt;br&gt;
'''Energy source:''' Ion energy&lt;br&gt;
'''Main weapons'''
*Arm Punch â Retaining the launching fists of the Zambull, Zambot 3 fires its fist in typical super robot fashion.
*Teisatsu Mecha Regon (Reconnaissance Mecha Regon) â Zambot 3 retains Zambase's remote cameras.
*Zambot Grap â A pair of sai that can also join at the handles to transform into a double-sided lance, Zambot Blow, as well as a sword, Zambot Cutter.  The variations are often used one after the other and to adapt to different situations.
*Buster Missile â Missiles fired from the pods on sides of Zambot 3's legs.
*Zambot Buster â The pods on the side of Zambot 3's legs are thrown like shuriken, and will often hit the enemy twice.
*Moon Attack â Energy is gathered from Zambot 3's hands to the moon on is forehead.  A crescent moon-shaped energy attack flies at the target, multiplies and surrounds it, then recombines and punches a crescent moon-shaped hole through the target.

'''Weaknesses''': Zambot 3 has very few glaring design flaws, but the most prominent one is that its armor begins to fail when in waters deeper than 7000 meters.

====Zambird/Zambo Ace====
Pilot: Kappei Jin

Zambird is a high-speed aerial vehicle which is able to go faster than Japan Self-Defense Force fighter jets.  Zambird can transform into the humanoid Zambo Ace.  Zambo Ace's primary armament is its Zambo Magnum.  Zambird forms primarily the head and the inner torso of Zambot 3 and has two cockpits, with Kappei in the left and ChÅ«nishiki in the right (which ultimately leads to the latter's demise).

'''Main Weapons'''

''''Zambird''''
*Tremble Horn: A laser that is shot out of the parabolic dish on top of Zambird.
*50mm Vulcans: Fired out of the front of Zambird.
*Missiles
*Rockets

''''Zambo Ace''''
*Zambo Magnum: A large gun which can be outfitted with different parts to form not only a magnum but also a sniper rifle and rocket launcher.

====Zambull====
Pilot: UchÅ«ta Kamie

Zambull is a tank-like vehicle that has the most hitting power out of the three parts of Zambot 3.  Zambull forms the outer torso and arms of Zambot 3, as evidenced by the large fists that sit on top of Zambull.

'''Main Weapons'''
*Giant Cannon
*Missiles
*Arm Punch: Zambull fires its fist.
*Drill Missiles

====Zambase====
Pilot: Keiko Kamikita

Zambase functions as both an attack and support vehicle.  In addition to possessing its own weapons for offense, Zambase also carries spare ammunition and Zambo Magnums for Zambo Ace, as well as remote cameras for reconnaissance.  Zambase forms primarily the legs of Zambot 3, and is also responsible for overseeing balance and power distribution throughout the entire robot.

'''Main Weapons'''
*Base Laser
*Base Fire
*Missiles
*Teisatsu Mecha Regon: Remote spy cameras

==Video games==
Zambot 3 has made an appearance in several ''[[Super Robot Wars]]'' titles.

'''Jean Sendy''' (1910â1978)&lt;ref&gt;[http://mysteretboulesdecristal.centerblog.net/6458994-jean-sendy-1910-1978 MystÃ¨re et boules de cristal]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[French people|French]] writer and translator, author of works on [[esotericism|esoterica]] and [[UFO]] phenomena. He was also an early proponent of the [[ancient astronaut]] hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://raelian.com/en/jean_sendy.php Profile for Jean Sendy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient astronauts==
He wrote the 1968 book ''The moon: The key to the Bible'' in which he claimed the word "Elohim" mentioned in the Hebrew [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] of the Bible, which is usually translated as [[God]], should in fact be translated in the plural as "Gods" because the singular of the word ''Elohim'' is ''Eloah''.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Sendy, La Lune, Cle de la Bible, 1968 pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the "Gods" were actually space travelers (an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] race of [[humanoids]]). Sendy believed that Genesis was factual history of ancient astronauts colonizing earth who became "angels in human memory". The book contains similar ideas to that of the UFO religion [[RaÃ«lism]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan J. Palmer, Aliens adored: RaÃ«l's UFO religion, 2004, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diana G. Tumminia, Alien worlds: social and religious dimensions of extraterrestrial contact, 2007 p. 65 {{ISBN|978-0-8156-0858-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.prevensectes.com/rael19.htm&amp;ei=EIbeTZiLOYG2hAedwIHDCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ7gEwAA&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dwww.prevensectes.com%2Bjean%2Bsendy%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26biw%3D1345%26bih%3D627%26prmd%3Divnso Jean Sendy and RaÃ«lism]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1969 book ''Those Gods who made Heaven and Earth'', Sendy claimed that space travelers 23,500 years ago arrived in the [[solar system]] in a large hollow sphere and seeded humanity.

'''Judeo-Berber''' ({{lang-ber|Tamazight Tudayt}}, {{Lang-he|××¨××¨××ª ××××××ª}}) is any of several hybrid [[Berber languages|Berber]] varieties traditionally spoken as a second language in [[Jew]]ish communities of central and southern [[Morocco]], and perhaps earlier in Algeria. Judeo-Berber is (or was) a [[contact language]]; the first language of speakers was [[Judeo-Arabic]].&lt;ref name=Chetrit2016&gt;Chetrit (2016) "Jewish Berber", in Kahn &amp; Rubin (eds.) ''Handbook of Jewish Languages'', Brill&lt;/ref&gt; (There were also Jews who spoke Berber as their first language, but not a distinct Jewish variety.)&lt;ref name=Chetrit2016/&gt; Speakers emigrated to Israel in the 1950s and 1960s. While mutually comprehensible with the [[Tamazight]] spoken by most inhabitants of the area (Galand-Pernet et al. 1970:14), these varieties are distinguished by the use of Hebrew loanwords and the pronunciation of ''Å¡'' as ''s'' (as in many Jewish Moroccan Arabic dialects).

==Geographic distribution==
Communities where Jews in [[Morocco]]  spoke  Judeo-Berber  included : [[Tinerhir]], [[Ouijjane]], [[Asaka, Morocco|Asaka]], [[Imini]], [[Draa]] valley, [[Demnate]] and [[Ait Bou Oulli]] in the Tamazight-speaking [[Middle Atlas]] and High Atlas and [[Ifrane Atlas-Saghir|Oufrane]], [[Tiznit]] and [[Illigh]] in the Tasheliyt-speaking [[Souss]] valley (Galand-Pernet et al. 1970:2). Jews were living among tribal Berbers, often in the same villages and practiced old tribal Berber protection relationships. 

Almost all speakers of Judeo-Berber left Morocco in the years following its independence, and their children have mainly grown up speaking other languages.  In 1992, about 2,000 speakers remained, mainly in [[Israel]]; all are at least bilingual in [[Judeo-Arabic language|Judeo-Arabic]].

==Phonology==

Judeo-Berber is characterized by the following phonetic phenomena: &lt;ref name=Chetrit2016/&gt;

* Centralized pronunciation of /i u/ as [É¨ Ê]
* Neutralization of the distinction between /s Ê/, especially among monolingual speakers
* Delabialization of lablialized velars (/kÊ· gÊ· xÊ· É£Ê·/), e.g. nÉkkÊ·ni/nukkni &gt; nÉkkni 'us, we'
* Insertion of epenthetic [É] to break up consonant clusters
* Frequent diphthong insertion, as in Judeo-Arabic
* Some varieties have q &gt; kÊ² and dË¤ &gt; tË¤, as in the local Arabic dialects
* In the eastern Sous Valley region, /l/ &gt; [n] in both Judeo-Berber and Arabic

==Usage==
Apart from its daily use, Judeo-Berber was used for orally explaining religious texts, and only occasionally written, using Hebrew characters; a manuscript [[Pesah]] [[Haggadah]] written in Judeo-Berber has been reprinted (Galand-Pernet et al. 1970.) A few prayers, like the Benedictions over the Torah, were recited in Berber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dayan.org/articles/JewsandBerbers.pdf |title=Jews and Berbers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219184242/http://www.dayan.org/articles/JewsandBerbers.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-19 |df= }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(72.8&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Taken from Galand-Pernet et al. 1970:121 (itself from a manuscript from Tinghir):
:×Ö´×Ö°×Ö·×Ö°× ×Ö·×Ö°×Ö´× Ö·×Ö¸× ××¤Ö¼×¨×¢× ×Ö°×Ö·×¦Ö¸×¨. ×Ö´×©×Ö¹×¤Ö´×Ö·× ×¨×× × Ö¼× ×Ö°×Ö°× Ö¸× ×©×Ö¹×¤×Ö¹×© × Ö´×Ö°×¨×¢ ×©×Ö¹×¤×Ö¹×©  ×Ö´××××Ö¹×Ö·× 
:''ixÉddamn ay n-ga i pÉrÊ¿u gÂ° maá¹£Ér.  i-ss-ufÄ¡ aÄ¡ Éá¹bbi ÉnnÉÄ¡ dinnaÄ¡ s ufus Én ddrÊ¿, s ufus ikuwan.''
:Rough word-for-word translation: servants what we-were for Pharaoh in Egypt.  he-cause-leave us God our there with arm of might, with arm strong.
:Servants of Pharaoh is what we were in Egypt.  Our God brought us out thence with a mighty arm, with a strong arm.

The '''King's Manor''' is a Grade I [[listed building]] in [[York]], [[England]], and is part of the [[University of York]].

==History==
King's Manor was originally built to house the abbots of [[St Mary's Abbey, York]].&lt;ref name=past&gt;{{PastScape|mnumber=58182 |mname=King's Manor, York|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbot's house probably occupied the site since the eleventh century, but the earliest remains date from the fifteenth century.  When the abbey was dissolved in 1539, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] instructed that it be the seat of the [[Council of the North]].&lt;ref name=past/&gt; It performed this role until the Council was abolished in 1641.&lt;ref name=past/&gt;  From 1667 to 1688, it was the residence of the Governor of York. During the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, the Governor, [[Sir John Reresby, 2nd Baronet]], remained loyal to the King, James II, but a party of armed men, led by Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby, captured the Manor and the City of York, and held them for [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. After 1688, the building was hired out to private tenants until the nineteenth century, when it was taken over and expanded by the Yorkshire School for the Blind.&lt;ref name=past/&gt; For a detailed description of the history and architecture of the building, perhaps the best source is that contained in the RCHME Inventory of the City of York, Volume IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/rchme/york/vol4/pp30-43|title=The King's Manor {{!}} British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use by University of York ==
On the departure of the Blind School in 1958, the Manor was acquired by York City Council, who leased it to the University in 1963.&lt;ref name="past" /&gt;  The main University later moved to the Heslington Campus. From 1966, the principal academic department to use the Manor was the Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies (IoAAS). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ip51.icomos.org/~fleblanc/projects/1971-1979_PC/p_pc_uk_york_course/p_pc_york_course_program.pdf|title=IoAAS courses description|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IoAAS was a leading UK provider of mid-career education for architects and related professionals, specialising latterly in architectural conservation studies. The main public room of the Manor is the Huntingdon Room, used for courses and meetings. As well as the IoAAS, there were several other Departments in the Kingâs Manor, the main ones being the Centre for Medieval Studies, a Language Teaching centre and the Design Unit (an architectural practice, but part of the IoAAS). The building also housed six University staff flats. The Dining Room provided an important place for the meeting of âtown and gownâ, especially in the early years of the University. Following the closure of the IoAAS, the main occupant became the [[Department of Archaeology at the University of York|Department of Archaeology]] (including the [[Archaeology Data Service]]), plus the Centre for Medieval Studies and the Centre for Eighteenth Century Studies.&lt;ref name="past" /&gt;

''[[Second Life]]'' (SL) is an [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]] 3D environment that can be used for entertainment and educational purposes. Due to increasing interest in digital services, some [[libraries]] have established virtual services on ''Second Life''.

== History ==
By 2007, there were more than 40 '''libraries in ''Second Life''''' and the number was increasing as of April 2011.&lt;ref name="ucd" /&gt; Many of those libraries were found in Cybrary City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libsuccess.org/index.php?title=Cybrary_City|title=Cybrary City - Library Success: A Best Practices Wiki|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of the information archipelago on ''Second Life''. This place was built for libraries to set up their virtual services and for displaying their resources. Libraries can provide their services while also learning new skills for 21st-century librarianship.

==''Second Life'' libraries==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Caledon Whitehall library 004.png|thumb|A screencap of a virtual library]] --&gt;

[[Library]] services in ''[[Second Life]]'' can be found at the following SL locations:

*Info Island 1
*Info Island 2
*Edu Island
*Caledon Library
*Healthinfo Island
*Imagination Island - Rachelville
*ALA Arts Island
*Cybrary City 1
*Cybrary City 2&lt;ref name="flying"&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenhill|first=Kathryn|title=Flying Librarians of Oz: What's all the fuss about Second Life and what's it got to do with libraries?|url=http://www.slideshare.net/sirexkat/flying-librarians-of-oz-whats-all-the-fuss-about-second-life-and-whats-it-got-to-do-with-libraries|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Second Life'' libraries are examples of [[Virtual learning environment|immersive learning environments]]. Users can interact with the services in practical ways, such as walking around a virtual space. Libraries in ''Second Life'' often put on digital exhibitions as part of their services, for example an exhibit displaying virtual representations of [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] paintings, including ''Starry Night''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hill|first=Valerie|author2=Lee, Hyuk-Jin |title=Libraries and immersive learning environments unite in Second Life|journal=Library Hi Tec|year=2009|volume=27|issue=3|pages=338â356|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1811857&amp;show=abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of virtual library services is to attract new users to traditional libraries as well as establishing links with librarians from all over the world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chappell |author2=Rachlin, Palmer |author3=Vinson, Zamarripa |title=When Real and Virtual World Collide: A Second Life Library |year=2009 |url=http://www.desktop-computing.com/capstone/Documents/WhenVirtualWorldsCollideFinal.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323051006/http://www.desktop-computing.com/capstone/Documents/WhenVirtualWorldsCollideFinal.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these services are run by volunteers.

There have been numerous initiatives to create educational spaces within ''Second Life''. There are Victorian areas in which residents dress in period clothes, an Egyptian tomb and a Renaissance Island created by the Alliance Second Life Libraries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=L.|author2=Lindbloom, M. |author3=Peters, T. |author4=Pope, K. |title=Virtual Libraries and Education in Virtual Worlds: Twenty-first century library services|journal=Policy Futures in Education|year=2008|volume=6|issue=1|url=http://www.wwwords.co.uk/pdf/validate.asp?j=pfie&amp;vol=6&amp;issue=1&amp;year=2008&amp;article=6_Bell_PFIE_6_1_web}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central Missouri State University has also received funding to create a reproduction of 1920s Harlem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual Harlem|url=http://www.evl.uic.edu/core.php?mod=4&amp;type=1&amp;indi=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libraries can also put on virtual events such as conferences, seminars and lectures. In 2008 and 2009 Alliance Library System (ALS) organised a conference called ''Virtual Worlds: Libraries, Education and Museums Conference''. It took place in the New Media Consortium Conference Center in ''Second Life'' and was designed to "provide a gathering place for librarians, information professionals, educators, museologists, and others to learn about and discuss the educational, informational, and cultural opportunities of virtual worlds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Lori|title=Virtual Worlds: Libraries, Education and Museums Conference|url=http://lisnews.org/node/29040|publisher=LIS News|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual libraries which are independent, run by volunteers and not affiliated with a traditional [[library]] are often the most successful ones in ''Second Life''. ''Second Life''-only virtual libraries tend to be more successful than the ''Second Life'' branches of public libraries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Users suggest that the libraries in ''Second Life'' serve a niche population, which results in difficulties with marketing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Staff of public libraries have different perspectives on SL when they are experimenting with it, which results in general conflict.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In order to have a successful virtual library in ''Second Life'' there are six different elements that should be considered.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; These are:

*Location
*Timing
*Funding
*Techniques
*Organisational baggage
*Computing technology&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Examples and projects==

===Alliance Library System (ALS)===

The Alliance Library System&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliancelibrarysystem.com/|title=Reaching Across Illinois Library System|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Illinois]] based local library co-operator, providing vital library services to citizens. It serves three sectors: libraries, legislators and communities. It is also one of the nine multitype library systems.  Multitype library systems cooperate amongst different library sectors in a community, including academic, public, school, and special libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multicounty Multitype Library Cooperation Systems|url=http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/Learning_Support/Library_Services/Minnesota_Libraries_and_Librarians/Multitype_Library_Systems/index.html|publisher=Minnesota Department of Education|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Alliance Library System, the Mid-Illinois Talking Book Center, and the Illinois State Library Talking Book and Braille Service founded Online Programming for All Libraries (OPAL).&lt;ref name=opal&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to OPAL: Online Programs for All|url=http://www.opal-online.org/|publisher=Online Programming for All Libraries (OPAL)|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.opal-online.org/ OPAL] is an international cooperative program supported by libraries and organisations that provide web-based service and courses/trainings for library customers and staff. The administrator of OPAL is TAP Information Services. Programs include library training, special events and virtual tours of digital library collections. OPAL events mainly happen online. Those online rooms can be accessed via various ways (e.g. voice-over-IP, text chatting and synchronised browsing) by participants. In 2006, Alliance Library System and OPAL Opened an Alliance of Libraries 2.0 on ''Second Life'' together.&lt;ref name=shifted&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Library |url=http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/archives/2006/04/12/second_library.html |publisher=The Shifted Librarian |accessdate=25 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927182406/http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/archives/2006/04/12/second_library.html |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the Alliance Library System, along with other library organisations, began to investigate the possibility of establishing a library network on Second Life. By late 2006 they had purchased some land in ''Second Life'' and built a virtual library. They started holding discussion groups as well as classes for teens in the library, including courses on podcasting and film-making and an open-mic night.&lt;ref name=SLJ&gt;{{cite web|last=Barack|first=Lauren|title=Library Gets Second Life|url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6338703.html|publisher=School Library Journal|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 ALS created a virtual information archipelago called Info Island. The grand opening was on 12â14 October 2007.&lt;ref name=beth&gt;{{cite web|last=Kanter|first=Beth|title=Alliance Library System and Second Life Library/Info Island Official Opening|url=http://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2006/10/alliance_librar.html|publisher=Beth's Blog: How Nonprofit Organizations Can Use Social Media to Power Social Networks for Change|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Info Island consists of numerous islands housing various libraries and institutions run by the volunteers of the [http://infoisland.org/ Community Virtual Library] as well as Academic libraries such as Stanford University Library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wicklund|first=Deni|title=See the Stanford Libraries' Island in Second Life|url=http://speaking.stanford.edu/highlights/See_SU_Libraries_in_Second_Life.html|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and government organisations such as the Centres for Disease Control.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===When real and virtual worlds collide: a ''Second Life'' library===

"When Real and Virtual Worlds Collide: A Second Life Library" is a research paper carried out by Chase Baity, Pam Chappell, David Rachlin, C. Vinson and Marilyn Zamarripa. The group studied traditional public libraries, their ''Second Life'' counterparts, and independent ''Second Life'' in order to find out whether independent ''Second Life'' libraries or libraries affiliated with a Real Life library were the most successful. They used surveys, focus groups, and interviews. Over 350 users and 15 staff members participated in the study.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
 
The research questions for the study were:

* What are the integrated goals between the real world and virtual world libraries?
* What is the optimal way to deliver services to reach these goals that are highly usable for employees and patrons?
* How usable currently is the virtual library?&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

A secondary question was looking at how other real life and ''Second Life'' libraries are similar to or different from the Olathe project.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The study found that "Second-Life-only libraries are far more popular than Second Life branches of public libraries".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; They also found that "there are no clear indications of what makes a ''Second Life'' library more or less popular than an other.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===University College Dublin (UCD) Library in ''Second Life''===

The University College Dublin (UCD) [[UCD Library|James Joyce Library]] built up the first Irish library in Second Life.&lt;ref name="ucd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Library Joins Second Life|url=http://www.ucd.ie/news/june07/062707_second_life.html|publisher=UCD News|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University College Dublin]] set up its library in ''Second Life'' in March 2007 as a part of ALS's Cybrary City project.&lt;ref name="jibs"&gt;{{cite web|last=McMauley |first=Cathal |title=The Library in Second Life |url=http://www.jibs.ac.uk/events/workshops/web2.0/second-life.ppt |publisher=JIBS |accessdate=30 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727010726/http://www.jibs.ac.uk/events/workshops/web2.0/second-life.ppt |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This virtual library has several features and services, including user surveys, e-mail services, e-books, presentations, comment box, virtual PC, notecard giver, trampoline, dance machine and visitor counter. A work group was established for services, technology, staffing and marketing.&lt;ref name="jibs" /&gt;

===Caledon Library===

The Independent State of Caledon is an area of ''Second Life'' which is exclusively Victorian-themed.&lt;ref name=caledon&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent State of Caledon |url=http://www.steampunkwiki.com/wiki/Independent_State_of_Caledon |publisher=Steampunk Wiki |accessdate=25 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508222218/http://www.steampunkwiki.com/wiki/Independent_State_of_Caledon |archivedate= 8 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes its own virtual library.

As well as a traditional building, Caledon Library has an outdoor reading room, the Vannevar Bush Memorial Reading Garden. Users can find a book and sit under a tree to read it.&lt;ref name=caledon2&gt;{{cite web|title=Caledon Library |url=http://infoisland.org/about/caledon/ |publisher=Community Virtual Library |accessdate=25 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724113948/http://infoisland.org/about/caledon/ |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also holds book discussion groups and hosts art exhibitions.&lt;ref name="caledon2" /&gt;

Caledon Library has two main collection policies. These are 19th-century literature and materials relating to the Independent State of Caledon.&lt;ref name="caledon2" /&gt; They collect primary source material (including 19th-century novels and periodicals or materials from earlier ages considered important in the 19th century) and research materials relating to the 19th century. They are hoping to build a "listening collection" of audio books on these topics. Another project is a collection of materials created by residents of Caledon or items relating to Caledon.  Their aspiration is to eventually establish the Caledon Archives.&lt;ref name="caledon2" /&gt;

===Other examples of educational libraries in ''Second Life''===

* Many US universities in ''Second Life'' such as [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]].
* Universities from the following countries:  UK, Australia, Denmark, France, The Netherlands etc.
* UCLA offered a graduate level course, DIS 250 "Techniques and Issues in Information Access: Information Seeking in Second Life"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/jrichardson/courses/250W08.htm|title=UCLA DIS 250 "Techniques and Issues in Information Access: IS in Second Life," Winter 2008, Dr. John V. Richardson Jr.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the Winter 2008 term.

==Impact==

Due to changes in modern lifestyle and consumer behaviours, modern customers may not visit local library buildings. This has become a worry and reason for city councils to cut libraries' budgets. Some libraries, such as ALS decided to take the organisations to their customers, transferring from real life into a [[virtual world]].&lt;ref name="SLJ" /&gt;

In recent years ''Second Life'' libraries have held discussion groups and planned events. Participant librarians say that responses have been much higher than they thought they could be. For example, in the early days of ALS establishing a virtual library in Second Life, a surprising number of Residents visited the building, with some even asking reference questions.&lt;ref name="SLJ" /&gt;

According to successful examples, more and more libraries have realised that ''Second Life'' is a new and good means to interact with their customers, helping traditional libraries to accommodate new demands and challenges.

==Issues for real life librarians==

Some "real life" librarians may find it difficult to balance their duties in their online and offline capacities. Librarians are passionate about their commitments to virtual world libraries to the extent that most librarians completed virtual library work at home and are not compensated by their libraries for this work&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blankenship|first=Emily|author2=Holingsworth, Yolanda |title=Balancing both lives: issues facing librarians working in Second Life and real life worlds|journal=New Library World|year=2009|volume=110|issue=9/10|pages=430â440|doi=10.1108/03074800910997445|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=0307-4803&amp;volume=110&amp;issue=9/10&amp;articleid=1817279&amp;show=html|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. This could potentially cause problems with stress and fatigue.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Librarians also indicated that adequate computing equipment and faster broadband access is important for increasing the productivity and performance of Second Life libraries, and these requirements limit the involvement of numerous librarians.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Additional issues of computing supports include network security programs that help Second Life libraries to solve problems such as appropriate permissions, authentications, limitations of functionality based on security restrictions and service attacks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Additionally, there are some technology challenges. For example, the use of [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) â common in most libraries â has become one of the challenges for ''Second Life'' libraries. ''Second Life'' is sometimes unable to get all the information normally stored on RFID devices such as the means keeping track of library books, people or policies.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily&gt;{{cite web|title=3D Library Visit: Using Second Life To Research Everyday Problems|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080330225933.htm|publisher=Science Daily|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Some professionals have acknowledged that ''Second Life'' offers unique opportunities to expand the horizons of traditional library services.&lt;ref name="ucd" /&gt; In addition, some university librarians believe that ''Second Life'' libraries can be a valuable part of University services, becoming involved in activities such as delivering a downloading service for lecture notes.&lt;ref name="ucd" /&gt;

Some studies have found that some librarians did not pay enough attention to pre-planning their ''Second Life'' libraries, despite librarianship having a culture of planning and management.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Most ''Second Life'' librarians have no time to manage a ''Second Life'' Library during their working time because there is not any official timeline that designed by departments.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; As a result, ''Second Life'' libraries are misunderstood by many people who view ''Second Life'' libraries as just games without any educational value. Although the ''Second Life'' library is easier to navigate and provides many useful and good materials, it has few users. The reason is that the ''Second Life'' branch has not been well promoted in real life so library users do not know its existence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The post is held by a [[physician]] who serves to advise and lead a team of public health professionals such as [[environmental health officer]]s and [[public health nurse]]s on matters of [[public health]] importance.

The equivalent senior health official at the national level is often referred to as the [[Chief Medical Officer]], although the title varies across countries, for example known as the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] in the United States and the [[Chief Public Health Officer of Canada|Chief Public Health Officer]] in Canada.

==India==
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}
Health officers in India are expected to have prescribed qualifications, such as a Bachelor of Sanitary Science (B.S.Sc.), a degree of an institution recognized by the [[Medical Council of India]] or a diploma in Public Health after a 2-year study at the [[University of Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification No:22/2014 Health Officer in the Tamil Nadu Public Health Service, 2013-2014|url=http://www.tnpsc.gov.in/notifications/22_2014_not_eng_Health_Officer.pdf|publisher=TAMIL NADU PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION|accessdate=8 November 2015|pages=14|format=pdf|date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, the municipal position was an elected head of the [[local board of health]], however the term MOH has also been used to refer to the [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Officer]]. Under the [[Metropolis Local Management Act 1855]], London municipalities were each required to appoint a medical officer. In 1856, 48 officers took up appointments in the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Epidemic Streets: Infectious Disease and the Rise of Preventive Medicine | page = 4 | author = Anne Hardy | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-19-820377-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these specialists formed [[Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of Health]]. They were important and influential in the establishment of municipal hospitals under the provisions of the [[Local Government Act 1929]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levene|first1=Alysa|last2=Powell|first2=Martin|last3=Stewart|first3=John|title=The Development of Municipal General Hospitals in English County Boroughs in the 1930s|journal=Medical History|date=January 2006|volume=1|issue=50|pages=3â28|pmc=1369011|pmid=16502869|doi=10.1017/s002572730000942x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1974 NHS reorganisation they were replaced by Community Physicians who were attached to the different levels of the NHS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9220">'''Moralistic therapeutic deism''' ('''MTD''') is a term that was first introduced in the book ''Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers'' (2005) by sociologists [[Christian Smith (sociologist)|Christian Smith]] and Melinda Lundquist Denton. The term is used to describe what they consider to be the common beliefs among [[Demographics of the United States|American youth]].&lt;ref name="hansen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="veith"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://world.wng.org/2005/06/a_nation_of_deists |title=A nation of deists |last=Veith |first=Gene Edward |date=25 June 2005 |work=[[World (magazine)|World]] |accessdate=17 December 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161217030443/https://world.wng.org/2005/06/a_nation_of_deists |archivedate=17 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youthandreligion.nd.edu/announcements/soul-searching-the-religious-and-spiritual-lives-of-american-teenagers/ |title=Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers |website=[[University of Notre Dame | ND.edu]] |accessdate=4 May 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504153807/http://youthandreligion.nd.edu/announcements/soul-searching-the-religious-and-spiritual-lives-of-american-teenagers/ |archivedate= 4 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is the result of the research project the "National Study of Youth and Religion".

== Definition ==
The author's study found that many young people believe in several moral statutes not exclusive to any of the major world religions. It is not a new religion or [[theology]] as such, but identified as a set of commonly-held spiritual beliefs. It is this combination of beliefs that they label Moralistic Therapeutic Deism:

# A god exists who created and ordered the world and watches over human life on earth.
# God wants people to be good, nice, and fair to each other, as taught in the Bible and by most world religions.
# The central goal of life is to be happy and to feel good about oneself.
# God does not need to be particularly involved in one's life except when God is needed to resolve a problem.
# Good people go to [[heaven]] when they die.

These points of belief were compiled from interviews with approximately 3,000 teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;R. Albert Mohler, Jr., [http://www.christianpost.com/article/20050418/moralistic-therapeutic-deism-the-new-american-religion/index.html Moralistic Therapeutic Deism--the New American Religion], Christian Post, 18 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Authors' analysis ==
The authors say the system is "moralistic" because it "is about inculcating a moralistic approach to life. It teaches that central to living a good and happy life is being a good, [[Morality|moral]] person."{{sfn|Smith |Lundquist Denton|2005|p=163}} The authors describe the system as being "about providing therapeutic benefits to its adherent" as opposed to being about things like "[[repentance]] from [[sin]], of keeping the [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], of living as a [[servant]] of a sovereign divine, of steadfastly saying one's [[prayer]]s, of faithfully observing high holy days, of building character through [[suffering]]..."{{sfn|Smith |Lundquist Denton|2005|pp=163-164}} and further as "belief in a particular kind of God: one who exists, created the world, and defines our general moral order, but not one who is particularly personally involved in one's affairsâespecially affairs in which one would prefer not to have God involved."{{sfn|Smith |Lundquist Denton|2005|p=164}}

The remoteness of God in this kind of theism explains the choice of the term "[[Deism]]", even though "the Deism here is revised from its classical eighteenth-century version by the therapeutic qualifier, making the distant God selectively available for taking care of needs." It views God as "something like a combination Divine Butler and Cosmic Therapist: he's always on call, takes care of any problems that arise, professionally helps his people to feel better about themselves, and does not become too personally involved in the process."{{sfn|Smith |Lundquist Denton|2005|p=165}}

The authors believe that "a significant part of [[Christianity in the United States]] is actually only tenuously Christian in any sense that is seriously connected to the actual historical Christian tradition, but has rather substantially morphed into Christianity's misbegotten stepcousin, Christian Moralistic Therapeutic Deism."{{sfn|Smith |Lundquist Denton|2005|p=171}}

CNN online featured an article, "More Teens Becoming Fake Christians" on Kenda Creasy Dean's 2010 book ''Almost Christian: What the Faith of Our Teenagers is Telling the American Church''. (Oxford University Press, 2010). She writes, "The problem does not seem to be that churches are teaching young people badly, but that we are doing an exceedingly good job of teaching youth what we really believe, namely, that Christianity is not a big deal, that God requires little, and the church is a helpful social institution filled with nice peopleâ¦" She goes on to say that "if churches practice MTD in the name of Christianity, then getting teenagers to church more often is not the solution (conceivably it could make things worse). A more faithful church is the solutionâ¦. Maybe the issue is simply that the emperor has no clothes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Blake |date=27 August 2010 |title=Author: More teens becoming 'fake' Christians |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/08/27/almost.christian/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Deist writers have leveled two criticisms against use of the term Moralistic Therapeutic Deism, or MTD.  First, it has been argued that the word "[[Deism]]" has been too radically redefined by the coiners of the phrase. Deism in the classical sense means belief in an intelligent designer arrived at through reason and observation of the natural world. One critic states that: {{quote|"the 'religion' called Moralistic Therapeutic Deism would be more accurately called Moralistic Therapeutic Theism. (See "[[Theism]]") There is no reason to invent the phrase Moralistic Therapeutic Deism to begin withâbecause it is, as has already been stated many times, merely a diluted version of the revealed religion that already exists. In truth, it holds no relationship with Deism as we know it."&lt;ref name="underwood"&gt;{{cite web |last=Underwood |first=Drew |title=Moralistic Therapeutic... Theism? |work=Springfield Deism Examiner |date=22 September 2011}}{{self-published inline|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A second criticism is that the term is tendentious rather than descriptive, since, as even the originators admit, "no teenager would actually use the terminology 'Moralistic Therapeutic Deist' to describe himself or herself,"{{sfn|Smith |Lundquist Denton|2005|p=163}} The term is usually applied to denigrate a set of beliefs  less traditional than one's own. 

A third critique is that Moralistic  Therapeutic Deism is thus more of a general [[worldview]] than a religion or [[theology]] in itself. The above mentioned moral concepts of MTD, (what the original study called the "5 core beliefs") are not unique to any particular religion or spiritual practice. They can, however, be seen as principles extracted and generalised from [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] Christianity, but devoid of specific doctrines about [[God]] and [[Humans|humanity]].&lt;ref name="MTD definition"&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is Moralistic Therapeutic Deism (MTD)? | url=https://www.gotquestions.org/Moralistic-Therapeutic-Deism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commentary ==
Damon Linker suggested in a 2009 blog post that Moralistic Therapeutic Deism, while theologically "insipid", is "perfectly suited to serve as the [[civil religion]] of the highly differentiated twenty-first century United States,"&lt;ref name="linker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/blog/damon-linker/the-future-christian-america|title=The Future of Christian America|last=Linker|first=Damon|date=2009-04-07|work=[[The New Republic]]|accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a contention that was disputed by Collin Hansen,&lt;ref name="hansen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/aprilweb-only/116-11.0.html|title=Death By Deism|last=Collin|first=Hansen|date=20 April 2009|work=[[Christianity Today]]|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ross Douthat]], and [[Rod Dreher]].

The '''Museum of Fine Arts''' ({{lang-hu|'''SzÃ©pmÅ±vÃ©szeti MÃºzeum'''}} [ËseËpmyveËsÉti ËmuËzÉum]) is a museum in [[Heroes' Square (Budapest)|Heroes' Square]], [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], facing the [[Kunsthalle Budapest|Palace of Art]].

It was built by the plans of [[Albert Schickedanz]] and [[FÃ¼lÃ¶p Herzog]] in an [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]]-[[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style, between 1900 and 1906. The museum's collection is made up of international art (other than Hungarian), including all periods of European art, and comprises more than 100,000 pieces. The collection is made up of older additions such as those from [[Buda Castle]], the [[House of EsterhÃ¡zy|EsterhÃ¡zy]] and [[Zichy]] estates, as well as donations from individual collectors. The Museum's collection is made up of six departments: Egyptian, Antique, Old sculpture gallery, Old master paintings gallery, Modern collection, Graphics collection. The institution celebrated its centenary in 2006.

On 16 February 2015, the museum closed to the public for renovation. It is expected to reopen on 31 October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.szepmuveszeti.hu/main Museum website, March 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, a selection of works are housed in the [[Hungarian National Gallery]].

==Collection and exhibits==

===Ancient Egyptian art===
The gallery holds the second largest collection of Egyptian art in central Europe.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} It comprises a number of collections bought together by Hungarian Egyptologist, [[Eduard Mahler]], in the 1930s. Subsequent digs in Egypt have expanded the collection. Some of the most interesting pieces are the painted [[mummy]] sarcophagi.
[[Image:Museum Fine Arts04.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A corridor]]

===Classical antiquities===
The core of the collection was made up of pieces acquired from [[Paul Arndt]], a classicist from [[Munich]]. The exhibition mainly includes works from Ancient Greece and Rome. Most significant is the 3rd century marble statue called the Budapest dancer. The Cyprean and Mycenaean collection is also notable, also the ceramics and bronzes.

===Old master paintings (13th to 18th centuries)===
The 3000 paintings in the collection offer an almost uninterrupted survey of the development of European painting from the 13th to the late 18th centuries. The core of the collection is constituted by the 700 paintings acquired from the Esterhazy estate.

===Old Sculpture===
The collection's main section is devoted to pieces from the Middle Ages to the 17th century. It was based on the Italian collection of Karoly [[Pulszky]] and [[Istvan Ferenczy's]] bronze collections. From the latter came one of the most treasured works, the [[Rearing Horse and Mounted Warrior|small equestrian by Leonardo da Vinci]]. A number of painted wooden sculptures feature in the German and Austrian section.

====Drawings and prints====
The collection shows selected rotating exhibitions of its collection of 10,000 drawings and 100,000 prints originating mainly from the Esterhazy, Istvan Delhaes and Pal Majovsky acquisitions. All periods of European graphic art are represented. Important pieces include two studies by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] for the 'Battle of Anghiari', 15 drawings by [[Rembrandt]], 200 pieces by [[Francisco Goya|Goya]], and French [[aquatint]]s.

====Art after 1800====

The museum's collection of 19th- and 20th-century art is less significant than those found in other departments; it is a younger collection. The bulk of the painting is from the [[Biedermeier]] period and French art. From the latter are representatives of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] period ([[EugÃ¨ne Delacroix]]), the Barbizon school ([[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]], [[Gustave Courbet]]) and [[Impressionism]] ([[Ãdouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]). There is a large collection of sculptures by [[Auguste Rodin]] and [[Constantin Meunier]].

==Vasarely Museum==
Hungarian artist, [[Victor Vasarely]], donated a significant collection of his works to the gallery. These have found a permanent home outside the walls of the gallery at the [[Zichy]] mansion in [[Obuda]]. The two-storey wing of the building is known as the Vasarely Museum and is the only one of its kind in eastern Europe.

==Budapest Museum Quarter project==
In 2008, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts, LÃ¡szlÃ³ BaÃ¡n, proposed the merging of his museum with that of the [[Hungarian National Gallery]], due to the similar exhibition and collection profile of the two. Both (along with the Ludwig Museum of Contemporary Art) specialize in 20th century and [[Contemporary art|contemporary fine art]], much of which was created by Hungarian artists living overseas.&lt;ref name = Melyi&gt;{{cite news|last=MÃ©lyi|first=JÃ³zsef|title=Notes for a Budapest Museum Master Plan|url=http://www.artmargins.com/index.php/2-articles/606-notes-for-a-budapest-museum-master-plan-|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=Art Margins Online|date=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his request to add an â¬18million underground extension to the Museum of Fine Arts, which would have united collections spread across the city, was denied in February 2011, BaÃ¡n presented an alternative plan to the government to build two new buildings at the cost of â¬150m. He envisioned the new buildings, one housing contemporary European art and the other Hungarian photography, as a "special museum island" that would complement the Museum of Fine Arts and the [[Kunsthalle Budapest|Budapest Art Hall]] (MÅ±csarnok) by permanently joining the two collections by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=Budapest director's double vision for national museum|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=3 August 2011|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Budapest-directors-double-vision-for-national-museum/24249|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112021110/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Budapest-directors-double-vision-for-national-museum/24249 |archivedate=12 January 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Secretary of State for Culture [[GÃ©za SzÅcs]] officially announced plans to build a new structure along [[Andrassy ut|AndrÃ¡ssy Ãºt]] close to [[VÃ¡rosliget|City Park]] and near the existing Budapest Museum of Fine Arts and [[Kunsthalle Budapest|Budapest Art Hall]] (MÅ±csarnok). This building would house the collections of the current [[Hungarian National Gallery]].&lt;ref name=MTI&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Government commissioner appointed for planned "museum quarter" in Budapest|url=http://www.realdeal.hu/20111003/museum-of-fine-arts-director-appointed-as-museums-quarter-government-commissioner/|accessdate=4 August 2016 |website=Realdeal.hu|date=3 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006084718/http://realdeal.hu/20111003/museum-of-fine-arts-director-appointed-as-museums-quarter-government-commissioner/ |archivedate=6 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This expanded plan, which would utilize the entire boulevard, is also referred to as the [[Budapest Museum Quarter]] or AndrÃ¡ssy Quarter.&lt;ref name=Foldes&gt;{{cite news|last=FÃ¶ldes|first=AndrÃ¡s|title=Houdini-cirkusz es fiÃ¡kerek az AndrÃ¡ssyn|url=http://index.hu/belfold/budapest/2011/09/15/houdini_cirkusz_es_egyeb_megaberuhazasok_a_fovarosban/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=index.hu|date=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early December 2011, Ferenc CsÃ¡k, director of the [[Hungarian National Gallery]] since 2010 and critical of the proposed merger of the gallery with the Museum of Fine Arts, called the merge process "[v]ery unprofessional, antiâdemocratic and shortâsighted" and announced that he would resign at the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=Hungarian national gallery director resigns in protest|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Hungarian+national+gallery+director+resigns+in+protest/25182|accessdate=4 August 2016|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=7 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327161327/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Hungarian+national+gallery+director+resigns+in+protest/25182 |archivedate=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2012|03|05}}, a new director had not been named and the Hungarian National Gallery was being led by Deputy General Director, GyÃ¶rgy SzÅ±cs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact|url=http://www.mng.hu/en/contact|work=Hungarian National Gallery|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2380">'''Mutual liberty''' is an idea first coined by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in his 1835 work ''[[Democracy in America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexis de Tocqueville, ''Democracy in America'' (New York: Bantam Books, 2000), 9â15.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, Tocqueville was referring to the general nature of [[United States|American]] [[society]] during the 19th century. It appeared to him, at least on the surface, that every [[citizen]] in the [[United States]] had the [[wikt:opportunity|opportunity]] to participate in the civic activities of the [[country]]. Another way to look at mutual liberty is by accounting for the collective [[free will]]s of every rational being in a [[community]]. Even though the notion of mutual liberty was introduced by Tocqueville, it was [[John Stuart Mill]] who greatly expanded it.&lt;ref name=mill&gt;John Stuart Mill, ''On Liberty and Utilitarianism'' (New York: Bantam Books, 1993), 12â16.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill believed that the most proper occasion for mutual liberty was in a community governed by the [[consent of the governed]], i.e., a [[republic]].&lt;ref name=mill/&gt; And according to Mill, it is only in a republic where members of all political [[Political faction|factions]] can participate.&lt;ref name=mill/&gt; It has been said that a republic is the form of government that divides people least.&lt;ref&gt;James McMillan, ''Modern France: 1880â2002'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2003), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement pertains greatly to mutual liberty. Unlike [[positive liberty|positive]] and [[negative liberty]], mutual liberty encompasses all citizens. It makes no distinction between political preference and social status. Mutual liberty pervades all sectors of society, from the homeless man on the street to the premier of the [[State (polity)|state]]. It is the process through which a general sense of [[morality]] gets exerted on the widest range of people in any given communal setting.

'''Non-Hispanic whites''' or '''whites not of Hispanic or Latino origin''' (commonly referred to as [[Anglo-Americans]]),&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/anglo Oxford English Dictionary: "Anglo"] ''North American A white English-speaking person of British or northern European origin, in particular (in the U.S.) as distinct from a Hispanic American or (in Canada) as distinct from a French-speaker.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Mish, Frederic C., Editor in Chief ''Webster's Tenth New Collegiate Dictionary'' Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A.:1994--Merriam-Webster See original definition (definition #1) of ''Anglo'' in English: It is defined as a synonym for ''Anglo-American''--Page 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dictionary.com&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Anglo | title = Anglo - Definitions from Dictionary.com; American Heritage Dictionary | accessdate = 2008-03-29 | quote = Usage Note: In contemporary American usage, Anglo is used primarily in direct contrast to Hispanic or Latino. In this context it is not limited to persons of English or even British descent, but can be generally applied to any non-Hispanic white person, making mother tongue (in this case English) the primary factor. Thus in parts of the United States such as the [[Southwest United States]] with large Hispanic populations, an American of Polish, Irish, or German heritage might be termed an Anglo just as readily as a person of English descent. However, in parts of the country where the Hispanic community is smaller or nonexistent, or in areas where ethnic distinctions among European groups remain strong, Anglo has little currency as a catch-all term for non-Hispanic whites. Anglo is also used in non-Hispanic contexts. In Canada, where its usage dates at least to 1800, the distinction is between persons of English and French descent. And in American historical contexts Anglo is apt to be used more strictly to refer to persons of English heritage, as in this passage describing the politics of nation-building in pre-Revolutionary America: "The 'unity' of the American people derived ... from the ability and willingness of an Anglo elite to stamp its image on other peoples coming to this country" (Benjamin Schwarz). |publisher= Lexico Publishing Group, LLC| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080315013806/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Anglo| archivedate= 15 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[European Americans]] who are not of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] origin/ethnicity, as defined by the [[United States Census Bureau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_68172.htm|title=White persons, percent, 2000|date=4 January 2011|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=19 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104065256/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_68172.htm|archivedate=4 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=dt&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G2000_B03002&amp;-tree_id=306&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-all_geo_types=N&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en|title=American FactFinder - Search|first=U.S. Census|last=Bureau|website=factfinder.census.gov|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hispanics and Latinos can be of any race, as the [[United States Census Bureau]] regards the Hispanic ethnicity as independent of race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/compraceho.html |title=Guidance on the Presentation and Comparison of Race and Hispanic Origin Data |accessdate=2010-01-12 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |quote=Race and Hispanic origin are two separate concepts in the federal statistical system.

Americans of European ancestry represent ethnic groups that combined account for more than half of the share of the Non-Hispanic white population are the [[German Americans|Germans]], the [[Irish Americans|Irish]], and [[English Americans|English]] (additionally [[American ancestry|Americans]]).

In the [[United States]], this population was first derived from [[British colonization of the Americas|English]] (and, to a lesser degree, [[French colonization of the Americas|French]]) settlement of the Americas, as well as [[Human settlement|settlement]] by other Europeans such as the [[German Americans|Germans]] and [[Dutch Americans|Dutch]] that began in the 17th century (see [[History of the United States]]). Continued growth since the early 19th century is attributed to sustained very high birth rates alongside relatively low death rates among settlers and natives alike as well as periodically [[History of immigration to the United States|massive immigration]] from European countries, especially [[German Americans|Germany]], [[Irish Americans|Ireland]], [[English Americans|England]], [[Italian Americans|Italy]], [[Greek Americans|Greece]], [[Swedish Americans|Sweden]] and [[Norwegian Americans|Norway]], as well as [[Polish Americans|Poland]], [[Russian Americans|Russia]], and many more countries.

== History ==
The first Europeans who came to North Americas were [[Leif Erikson|Norse explorers]] around the year 1000, however they ultimately left the continent leaving no permanent settlements behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15040888|title=Coming to America: Who Was First?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|pilgrims]] and colonists came in the 1600s along the east coast, mainly from England, in search of economic opportunities and religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/colonial/jb_colonial_subj.html|title=Colonial America (1492-1763)|website=www.americaslibrary.gov|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time emigrants from Europe settled the coastal regions developing a commercial economy. Between one-half and two-thirds of white immigrants to the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] between the 1630s and American Revolution had come as [[Indenture|indentured servants]].&lt;ref&gt;Galenson 1984: 1&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of European immigrants to all 13 colonies before 1775 was about 500,000; of these 55,000 were involuntary prisoners. Of the 450,000 or so European arrivals who came voluntarily, an estimated 48% were indentured.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Tomlins, "Reconsidering Indentured Servitude: European Migration and the Early American Labor Force, 1600â1775," ''Labor History'' (2001) 42#1 pp 5â43, at p.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] there were about 2.5 million whites in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, R. V. (2015). ''Population of the British Colonies in America Before 1776: A Survey of Census Data''.

D., &amp; Luebking, S. H. (Eds.). (2006). ''The source: A guidebook to American genealogy''. Ancestry Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the revolution and the 1820s there was relatively little immigration to the U.S. Starting after the 1820s large scale migration to the U.S began and lasted until the [[Immigration Act of 1924|1920s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prb.org/us-migration-trends/|title=Trends in Migration to the U.S. â Population Reference Bureau|website=www.prb.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the newcomers were of Irish,&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, James Patrick, Philip Coleman, Jason Francis King, ed.

Since [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|1965]] white migration to the U.S has been relatively minor compared to other racial and ethnic groups.

== Population stagnation and decline ==
The falling percentage of non-Hispanic white Americans is due to multiple factors:

1. '''Immigration'''.  The U.S. has the largest number of immigrants in the world with the vast majority coming from countries where the population is of non-white and/or Hispanic origin. Immigration to the U.S. from European countries has been in a steady decline since World War II averaging 56% of all immigrants in the 1950s and declining to 35% of all immigrants in the 1960s, 20% in the 1970s, 11% in the 1980s, 14% in the 1990s, and 13% in the 2000s.  In 2009, approximately 90% of all immigrants came from non-European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/yearbook/2009/ois_yb_2009.pdf |title=US Office of Immigration Statistics: 2009 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. does receive a small number of non-Hispanic white immigrants, mainly from countries such as Brazil, Canada, Poland, Russia, and the UK, as well as [[Egypt]] and [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics|title=Immigration Data &amp; Statistics - Homeland Security|website=Dhs.gov|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. '''Intermarriage'''. The USA is seeing an unprecedented increase in intermarriage between the various racial and ethnic groups.  In 2008, a record 14.6% of all new marriages in the United States were between spouses of a different race or ethnicity from one another. 9% of non-Hispanic whites who married in 2008 married either a non-white or Hispanic. Among all newlyweds in 2008, intermarried pairings were primarily white-Hispanic ''of any race'' (41%) as compared to white-Asian (15%), white-black (11%), and other combinations (33%). Other combinations consists of pairings between different minority groups, multi-racial people, and Native Indigenous Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewsocialtrends.org/files/2010/10/755-marrying-out.pdf|format=PDF|title=Marrying Out : One-in-Seven New U.S. Marriages is Interracial or Interethnic|website=Pewsocialtrends.org|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children of such unions would not automatically be classified as white non-Hispanic, although note that one self-identifies their racial and/or ethnic category, and would not preclude a certain number identifying themselves as non-Hispanic white rather than white Hispanic once they grow up, particularly if in addition to having a European appearance they do not speak Spanish or carry a Spanish surname, for example. According to Pew, 59% of non-Hispanics who acknowledged having some Hispanic ancestry of any race but do not consider themselves Hispanic and are able to pass as white non-Hispanic are tallied as such, adding about 3 million persons to the non-Hispanic white population rather than to the white Hispanic population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewhispanic.org/2017/12/20/hispanic-identity-fades-across-generations-as-immigrant-connections-fall-away/&lt;/ref&gt;

3. '''Methodology'''. In the 2000 Census, people were allowed to check more than one race in addition to choosing "Hispanic." There was strong opposition to this from some civil rights activists who feared that this would reduce the size of various racial minorities. The government responded by counting those who are white and of one minority race or ethnicity as minorities for the purposes of civil-rights monitoring and enforcement. Hence one could be 1/8th black and still be counted as a minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/opinion/fix-the-census-archaic-racial-categories.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title="Fix the Censusâ Archaic Racial Categories"|author=KENNETH PREWITT|date=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, because this does not apply to Hispanic origin (one is either Hispanic or not, but cannot be both Hispanic ''and'' non-Hispanic), the offspring of Hispanics and non-Hispanics are usually counted as Hispanic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/majority_minority_america_will_more_hispanics_and_asians_become_white_.html|title=The Myth of Majority-Minority America|first=Matthew|last=Yglesias|date=22 May 2012|website=Slate.com|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the [[Pew Research Center]] reported that high intermarriage rates and declining Latin American immigration has led to 11% of U.S. adults with Hispanic ancestry (5.0 million people) to no longer identify as Hispanic.&lt;ref name=PRCFade&gt;{{Cite web|last1= Gonzalex-Barrera   |first1=Ana|last2= Lopez |first2=Gustavo |last3= Lopez |first3=Mark Hugo |authorlink=   |title=Hispanic Identity Fades Across Generations as Immigrant Connections Fall Away   |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|date= December 20, 2017|url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/2017/12/20/hispanic-identity-fades-across-generations-as-immigrant-connections-fall-away/  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; First generation immigrants from Spain and Latin America identify as Hispanic at very high rates (97%) which reduces in each succeeding generation, second generation (92%), third generation (77%), and fourth generation (50%).&lt;ref name=PRCFade /&gt;

4. '''Attrition'''.  Minority populations are younger than non-Hispanic whites. The national median age in 2011 was 37.3 with non-Hispanic whites having the oldest median age (42.3) while Hispanics have the youngest (27.6). Non-Hispanic blacks (32.9) and non-Hispanic Asians (35.9) also are younger than whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/05/17/explaining-why-minority-births-now-outnumber-white-births/|title=Explaining Why Minority Births Now Outnumber White Births|first1=Jeffrey S.|last1=Passel|first2=Gretchen|last2=Livingston|first3=DâVera|last3=Cohn|date=17 May 2012|website=Pewsocialtrends.org|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Census Bureau reported that for the first time, due to the more advanced age profile of the non-Hispanic white population, non-Hispanic whites died at a faster rate than non-Hispanic white births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/us/census-benchmark-for-white-americans-more-deaths-than-births.html?_r=0 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title="Census Benchmark for White Americans: More Deaths Than Births"|author=SAM ROBERTS|date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although non-Hispanic whites are declining as a percentage, in actual numbers they were&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/us/census-benchmark-for-white-americans-more-deaths-than-births.html?_r=0 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title="Census Benchmark for White Americans: More Deaths Than Births"|author=SAM ROBERTS|date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; growing. From 2000 - 2010 the non-Hispanic white population grew from 194,552,774 to 196,817,552 - A growth of 1.2% over the 10-year period, due to residual [[population momentum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/29/us/census/index.html|title=White U.S. population grows but drops in overall percentage|first=By the CNN Wire|last=Staff|website=CNN|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, in 37 out of the 50 U.S. states non-Hispanic whites made up a greater percentage of the state's population than the U.S. overall share of 62.8%; however, the 13 states with greater shares of non-whites include the four most populous states (California, Texas, New York, and Florida). Also, note that while the ''total'' non-Hispanic white population has grown since 2000 in 36 out of the 50 states, the ''relative share'' of non-Hispanic whites in the overall state population has declined in all 50 states during that same time period.

As of 2016, five states are majority minority: Hawaii, California, New Mexico, Texas, and Nevada.

The '''Pakistani textbooks controversy''' relates to the reported inaccuracy of some Pakistani textbooks and the existence of [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]] in them. The content of Pakistan's official textbooks has often been criticized by several sources including many within Pakistan for sometimes promoting religious intolerance and [[Indophobia]], leading to calls for curriculum reform.

== Background ==

According to [[Hussain Haqqani]], only officially published textbooks are used in Pakistan's schools and colleges since the era of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]]. This is used by Pakistani government to create a standard narrative of Pakistan's history. During the rule of General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] a "program of [[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Islamization]]" of the country including the textbooks was started.&lt;ref name="MosqueMilitary"/&gt; General Zia's 1979 education policy stated that "[the] highest priority would be given to the revision of the curricula with a view to reorganizing the entire content around Islamic thought and giving education an ideological orientation so that Islamic ideology permeates the thinking of the younger generation and helps them with the necessary conviction and ability to refashion society according to Islamic tenets".&lt;ref name="Jamil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itacec.org/document/nep09/NCERT%20Pakistan%20paper%20BRJ.pdf|title=Curriculum Reforms in Pakistan â A Glass Half Full or Half Empty?|last=Jamil|first=Baela Raza|publisher=Idara-e-Taleem-o-Aagahi|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Sustainable Development Policy Institute]], since the 1970s Pakistan's school textbooks have systematically inculcated hatred towards [[India]] and [[Hindus]] through historical revisionism.&lt;ref name=SDPI/&gt; There is no mention of Islamic conquests and conversion of Hindus. Many texts give an impression that ancient Indian heritage was not destroyed by Afghans and Turks but Muslim heritage was destroyed by Indians, which supposedly contradicts the theory of mainstream historians.&lt;ref name=SDPI/&gt;

==Criticism==
In a 1995 paper published in the ''[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]'', historian [[Ayesha Jalal]] stated that "Pakistan's history textbooks amongst the best available sources for assessing the nexus between power and [[bigotry]] in creative imaginings of a national past." She points out authors whose "expansive pan-[[Islam]]ic imaginings" detect the beginnings of Pakistan in the birth of Islam on the [[Arabia|Arabian peninsula]]. ''A Text Book of Pakistan Studies'' claims that Pakistan "came to be established for the first time when the Arabs under [[Mohammad bin Qasim]] occupied [[Sindh]] and [[Multan]]'; by the thirteenth century 'Pakistan had spread to include the whole of [[Northern India]] and [[Bengal]]' and then under the [[Khalji dynasty|Khalji]]s, Pakistan moved further south-ward to include a greater part of Central India and the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]'. [...] The spirit of Pakistan asserted itself', and under [[Aurangzeb]] the 'Pakistan spirit gathered in strength'; his death 'weakened the Pakistan spirit'."
Jalal points out that even an acclaimed scholar like [[Jameel Jalibi]] questions the validity of a national history that seeks to "claim Pakistan's pre-Islamic past" in an attempt to compete with [[India]]'s historic antiquity. K. Ali's two volume history designed for BA students traces the pre-history of the 'Indo-Pakistan' subcontinent to the Paleolithic Age and consistently refers to the post-1947 frontiers of Pakistan while discussing the [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]]s and the [[Aryan]]s.&lt;ref name="Jalal"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tufts.edu/~ajalal01/Articles/conjuring.pdf|title=Conjuring Pakistan: History as Official Imagining|last=Jalal|first=Ayesha|work=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=27|year=1995|pages=73â89|accessdate=10 April 2011|doi=10.1017/S0020743800061596 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-Indian]] sentiments, coupled with [[anti-Hindu]] prejudices have existed in Pakistan since its [[Partition of India|formation]], alternated with [[military dictatorship]], and India being a [[secular state]] with a civilian government.&lt;ref name="Vali Nasr"&gt;Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr, The Vanguard of the Islamic Revolution: The Jama`at-i Islami of Pakistan (University of California Press, 1994) p121-122&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Tufts University]] professor [[Vali Nasr|Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr]], [[Indophobia]] in Pakistan increased with the ascendancy of the [[Militant (word)|militant]] [[Islamist]] [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] under [[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]].&lt;ref name="Vali Nasr"/&gt; [[Indophobia]], together with [[Anti-Hinduism]] and [[racist]] ideologies, such as the [[Martial Race]] theory, were the driving factors behind the re-writing of school textbooks in Pakistan (in both "[[secular]]" schools and Islamic [[madrassah]]s) in order to promote a biased and revisionist historiography of the [[Indian subcontinent]] that promulgated [[Indophobic]] and [[anti-Hindu]] prejudices. These narratives are combined with [[Islamist]] [[propaganda]] in the extensive revising of Pakistan's history. By propagating concepts such as [[jihad]], the inferiority of non-Muslims, Indiaâs perceived ingrained enmity with Pakistan, etc., the textbook board publications used by all government schools promote an [[obscurantist]] mindset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.dawn.com/archives/30854 Curriculum of hatred], [[Dawn (newspaper)]], 2009-05-20&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the historian Professor [[Mubarak Ali]], textbook "reform" in Pakistan began with the introduction of [[Pakistan Studies]] and [[Islamic studies]] by [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] in 1971 into the national curriculum as a compulsory subject. Former military dictator [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], under a general drive towards Islamization, started the process of historical revisionism in earnest and exploited this initiative. 'The Pakistani establishment taught their children right from the beginning that this state was built on the basis of religion â that's why they don't have tolerance for other religions and want to wipe-out all of them.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/may/18/pakistan-textbooks-religious-extremism The threat of Pakistan's revisionist texts], [[The Guardian]], 2009-05-18&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pakistani physicist, [[Pervez Hoodbhoy]], the [[Islamist]] revisionism of Pakistan's schools began in 1976 when an act of parliament required all government and private schools (except those teaching the British O-levels from Grade 9) to follow a curriculum that includes learning outcomes for the federally approved Grade 5 social studies class such as: 'Acknowledge and identify forces that may be working against Pakistan,' 'Make speeches on Jihad,' 'Collect pictures of policemen, soldiers, and national guards,' and 'India's evil designs against Pakistan.'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0121/p04s03-wosc.html?page=1 Pakistan: Do school texts fuel bias?], [[Christian Science Monitor]], 2009-01-21&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Yvette Rosser]] criticizes Pakistani textbooks for propagating [[jingoism|jingoist]] and [[irredentist]] beliefs about Pakistan's history and culture, and being negationist in its depiction of [[political Islam]] and the treatment of minorities in Pakistan, such as [[Hinduism in Pakistan|Hindus]] and [[Christianity in Pakistan|Christians]]. [[Irredentism]] is manifested through claims of "eternal Pakistan" (despite the country being created from [[British India]] only in 1947), narrow and sectarian interpretation of Islam, downplaying the tolerant aspects of the religion and focusing on [[Islamic Fundamentalist]] interpretations (such as all banking being un-Islamic), and making accusations of [[dual loyalty]] on minority Hindus and Christians in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

According to Pakistani professor [[Tariq Rahman]], Pakistani textbooks cannot mention Hindus without calling them cunning, scheming, deceptive or something equally insulting. The textbooks ignore the pre-Islamic history of Pakistan except to put the Hindu predecessors in negative light.&lt;ref name="Ideaofpakistan"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-78yjVybQfkC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=textbook+reform+pakistan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EKYdBxeV0y&amp;sig=0gkKDbdXguv_9JacWm02Dh3MpSU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9cefTbm_KInogQewysXkBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The idea of Pakistan|last=Cohen|first=Stephen|accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Pakistani historian [[Khursheed Kamal Aziz]] similarly has criticized Pakistani history textbooks. He stated that textbooks were full of historical errors and suggested that mandatory study amounted to teaching "prescribed myths". After examining 66 textbooks used at various levels of study Aziz argued that the textbooks supported military rule in Pakistan, promoted hatred for Hindus, glorified wars and distorted the pre 1947 history of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="MosqueMilitary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nYppZ_dEjdIC&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;ots=ZxptAn59N1&amp;dq=reforming%20textbooks%20pakistan&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Pakistan:between mosque and the military|last=Haqqani|first=Hussain|work=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Iftikhar Ahmad of [[Long Island University]] published in [[Current Issues in Comparative Education]] in 2004 drew five conclusions from content analysis of the social studies textbooks in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Ahmad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ853848&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ853848|title=Islam, Democracy and Citizenship Education: An Examination of the Social Studies Curriculum in Pakistan|last=Ahmad|first=Iftikhar|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# First, the selection of material and their thematic sequence in the textbooks present Islam not simply as a belief system but a political ideology and a grand unifying worldview that must be accepted by all citizens.
# Second, to sanctify Islamic ideology as an article of faith, the textbooks distort historical facts about the nation's cultural and political heritage.
# Third, the textbooks offer a biased treatment of non-Muslim citizens in Pakistan.
#Fourth, the main objective of the social studies textbooks on Pakistan studies, civics, and global studies, is to indoctrinate children for a romanticized Islamic state as conceptualized by Islamic theocrats.
#Fifth, although the vocabulary in the textbooks underscores Islamic virtues, such as piety, obedience, and submission, little is mentioned about critical thinking, civic participation, or democratic values of freedom of speech, equality, and respect for cultural diversity.

A study by Nayyar &amp; Salim of the [[Sustainable Development Policy Institute]] concluded in 2003 that there is an increasing trend where children are taught Pakistan Studies as a replacement for the teaching of history and geography as full-fledged disciplines. Previously, children were taught the very early pre-Islamic history of South Asia and its contribution to rich cultural diversity of modern-day Pakistan. This long historical perspective of Pakistan is absent these Pakistan Studies textbooks. Instead, children are now taught that the history of Pakistan starts from the day the first Muslim set foot in India. The study reported that the textbooks also had a lot of gender-biased stereotypes and other perspectives that "encourage [[prejudice]], [[bigotry]] and [[discrimination]] towards fellow Pakistanis and other nations, especially against religious minorities, as well as the omission of concepts ... that could encourage critical self awareness among studentsâ.&lt;ref name=SDPI&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110816022019/http://www.uvm.edu/~envprog/madrassah/TextbooksinPakistan.pdf The subtle Subversion: A report on Curricula and Textbooks in Pakistan] Compiled by A. H. Nayyar and Ahmed Salim&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubina Saigol, a US educated expert, said "I have been arguing for the longest time that, in fact, our state system is the biggest [[Madrassah]], we keep blaming madrassahs for everything and, of course, they are doing a lot of things I would disagree with. But the state ideologies of hate and a violent, negative nationalism are getting out there where madrassahs cannot hope to reach."&lt;ref name="LAT20050818"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/18/world/fg-schools18|title=In Pakistan's Public Schools, Jihad Still Part of Lesson Plan|last=Watson|first=Paul|date=18 August 2005|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to [[NCERT]]'s extensive review of textbooks in India in 2004, Verghese considered the erosion of plural and democratic values in textbooks in India, and the distortion of history in Pakistan to imply the need for coordination between [[Bangladesh]]i, Indian, and Pakistani historians to produce a composite history of the [[Indian subcontinent|Subcontinent]] as a common South Asian reader.&lt;ref&gt;Verghese, B.G. (2004). ''[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2004/06/23/stories/2004062301721000.htm Myth and hate as history]''. [[The Hindu]]. 23 June. Retrieved on 7 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, international scholars also warn that any attempt for [[Education reform|educational reforms]] under international pressure or market demands should not overlook the specific expectations of the people at local levels.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, M.J. (2006). [http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/pdf/10.1525/as.2006.46.5.699?cookieSet=1 Muslims, Markets, and the Meaning of âA Good Educationâ in Pakistan]. ''Asian Survey''. 46(5). pp. 699â720.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reform efforts==
In 2011 [[Fazalur Rahim Marwat]], the chairman of Textbook board of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] stated that reform of textbooks was being undertaken in the state. Marwat stated that previously, school books played a key role in spreading hatred against non-Muslims, particularly against Hindus and distorted the history. Such material had now been removed from the textbooks used in the state.&lt;ref name="et20110115"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/104066/mortal-threat-reforming-education-to-check-extremism/|title=Mortal Threat:Reforming education to check extremism.|last=Butt|first=Qaiser|date=15 January 2011|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Marwat had previously blamed General Zia for âsowing seeds of discord in society on religious and ethnic lines by stuffing school curricula with material that promoted hatred now manifested in the shape of extremism, intolerance, militancy, sectarianism, dogmatism and fanaticism.â In addition he stated "After the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] countless lessons and chapters were introduced that spread hatred among the students and portrayed India as the biggest enemy of the Muslims. That stuff should be done away with."&lt;ref name="Dawn20100727"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/136078|title=Curricula to be cleansed of hatred|last=Yusufzai|first=Ashfaq|date=27 July 2010|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Janura was born on 25 March 1911 in [[Fier]], then still part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He emigrated to [[Romania]] at an early age and finished high school there. Janura studied law in Italy and graduated in jurisprudence from the [[University of Pisa]]. In 1941 he returned to Albania (at that time the [[Albanian Kingdom (1939â43)|Albanian Kingdom]] under Italy) where he started working as a judge in [[Gostivar]], which had been recently incorporated in the Albanian state.&lt;ref name="Neziri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Myftaraj"/&gt; Janura remained in Yugoslavia after [[World War II]]. From that moment he was engaged in the development of the Albanian literature and language, literary criticism, and the overall status of the Albanian language within Yugoslavia, and specifically the Republic of Macedonia. He was also a folklorist, having collected and published rare Albanian folklore. As the head of the Albanian Catedra of the University of Skopje, he participated in the [[Albanian Orthography Congress|Orthography Congress]] of 1972 and was one of the signatories of the newly established orthographic rules.&lt;ref name="Myftaraj"/&gt; Janura died on 30 August 1983.

==Work==
Janura is the author of around 300 articles of three categories: informative-publicity, research studies, and [[monograph]]s. The first category comprises articles about various literature figures, as [[Fan Noli]], [[Zef Serembe]], [[Ali Asllani]], Mark Gurakuqi, etc. Some of the research articles focus about [[VoskopojÃ«]] old scripts and writings, work of [[Naim Frasheri]], [[Ndre Mjeda]], [[Asdreni]], also the [[Codex Beratinus|Codex of Berat]], and the Albanian language in [[Dubrovnik]]'s archives.&lt;ref name="Neziri"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Janura was very active as a contemporary literature critic, especially of that originating in Yugoslavia. His most important monographs are ''PÃ«r historinÃ« e alfabetit shqip'' (For the history of the Albanian alphabet) of 1969 which remains one of the first studies on the [[Synchrony and diachrony|diachrony]] of the Albanian language, and ''[[Migjeni]]'' (Migjeni) of 1982, both published in Skopje. The book on [[Migjeni]]'s work (Millosh Gjergj Nikolla) is a monograph of 326 pages and is one of the first in the history of Albanian literature. It is arranged in four sections. The first covers the poet's life important moments and how they affected his work, the second and largest section covers the poet's work in the prism of the [[Albanology]]. The monograph led the way to many following studies on Migjeni's work.&lt;ref name="Neziri"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;He was also the co-author of didactic textbooks for elementary schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/liber-leximi-per-klasen-e-3-gjimnaz-dhe-per-klasen-e-7-te-shkollave-tetevjecare/oclc/43135297&amp;referer=brief_results LibÃ«r leximi pÃ«r klasÃ«n e 3 gjimnaz dhe pÃ«r klasÃ«n e 7 tÃ« shkollave tetÃ«vjecÌ¦are, Skopje: "Prosvetno Dello", 1954.

[[File:Pitsa panel 2.jpg|thumb|"Panel 2"]]
The '''Pitsa panels''' or '''Pitsa tablets''' are a group of painted wooden tablets found near Pitsa, [[Corinthia]] ([[Greece]]). They are the earliest surviving examples of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[panel painting]].

==Location==
The four panels, two of them highly fragmentary, were discovered during the 1930s in a cave near the village of Pitsa, in the vicinity of [[Sicyon]]. They can be stylistically dated to ''circa'' 540â530 BC, i.e., to the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] of Greek art.

==Technique==
The tablets are thin wooden boards or panels, covered with [[stucco]] ([[plaster]]) and painted with mineral pigments. Their bright colours are surprisingly well preserved. Only eight colours (black, white, blue, red, green, yellow, purple and brown) are used, with no shading or gradation of any sort. Probably, the black contour outlines were drawn first and then filled in with colours.

==Motifs==
The tablets depict religious scenes connected with the cult of the [[nymphs]].

One of the two near-complete examples shows a [[sacrifice]] to the nymphs. Three or more females, dressed in [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] and [[peplos]], are approaching an altar to the right. They are accompanied by musicians playing the [[lyre|lyra]] and [[aulos]]. The person nearest the altar appears to be pouring a [[libation]] from a jug. A small figure behind her, perhaps a slave, is leading a lamb, the sacrificial victim. An inscription in the [[Archaic_Greek_alphabets#Corinthian |Corinthian alphabet]] names two woman dedicators, Euthydika and Eucholis and states that the tablet, or the depicted offering, is dedicated to the nymphs.

The second well-preserved tablet also has a written dedication to the nymphs and shows three partially overlapping female figures, perhaps the nymphs themselves.

==Function and context==
The tablets are [[votive]] offerings, connected with the rural cult of the nymphs, which was widespread throughout Greece. Stylistically and technically, they probably represent rather low quality panel paintings of their time. This, as well as references to wooden painted or inscribed votives at other Greek sanctuaries (e.g. [[Epidaurus]]), indicates that the Pitsa tablets belong to the types of votives available to the lower, or poorer, sections of population. Such simple votives may have been far more numerous originally, but the fact that they are made of perishable materials, whereas richer votives were of stone, bronze or precious metals, has led to their near-total disappearance from the archaeological record.

==Significance==
Most ancient paintings that survived are either [[fresco]]es or [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase paintings]]. It is known that panel paintings were held in much higher regard, but very few of them have survived. The best known examples of ancient [[panel painting]], the [[Fayum mummy portraits]] and the [[Severan Tondo]], are of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] date. The Pitsa panels, probably preserved due to the unusual climatic conditions inside the cave, are by far the earliest examples of this technique to survive. As the only pre-Roman specimens, they represent virtually all the evidence for a whole style of art. Incidentally, the ancient Greeks believed that panel painting was invented in Sicyon, not far from Pitsa.

(New York: Warner Destiny, 1976). 143.&lt;/ref&gt; and pendulum-[[dowsing]] author, [[Antoine Bovis]], developed the idea that small models of pyramids can preserve food. The story persists that Bovis, while standing inside the King's Chamber of the Great Pyramid in Egypt, saw a garbage can inside the chamber piled with dead animals that had wandered into the structure, noticed that these small carcasses were not decaying and inferred that the structure somehow preserved them.&lt;ref&gt;Loxton, Daniel. {{cite web|url=http://www.skeptic.com/productlink/magv12n2|title=''Junior Skeptic'' #23: Pyramid Power}} (Altadena: Skeptics Society, 2006). 81â83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laigaard, Jens. {{cite web|url=http://www.skeptic.com/junior_skeptic/issue23/translation_Laigaard.html|title=excerpt from Chapter Eight of ''Pyramideenergien â kritisk undersÃ¸gelse''}} (1999).

(New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1970). 340.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bovis never claimed to have visited Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Loxton, Daniel. {{cite web|url=http://www.skeptic.com/productlink/magv12n2|title=''Junior Skeptic'' #23: Pyramid Power}}  (Altadena: Skeptics Society, 2006). 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skeptic1935" /&gt;  In his self-published French-language booklet&lt;ref&gt;Bovis, Antoine. {{cite web|url=http://skeptic.com/downloads/Antoine_Bovis_Booklet.pdf|title=ExposÃ© de M.A. Bovis au CongrÃ¨s International de Radiotellerie Ã  Nice}}  (Nice: Bovis, c. 1935.) PDF scan of original hosted at ''Skeptic.com.''&lt;/ref&gt; Bovis ascribes his discovery to reasoning and experiments in Europe using a dowsing pendulum:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have supposed that Egyptians were already very good dowsers and had oriented their pyramid by means of rod and pendulum. Being unable to go there to experiment and verify the radiations of the Keops Pyramid, I have built with cardboard some pyramids that you can see now, and I was astonished when, having built a regular pyramid and oriented it, I found the positive at the East, the negative at the West, and at the North and the South, dual-positive and dual-negative...

A new supposition: since with the help of our positive 2000Â° magnetic plates we can mummify small animals, could the pyramid have the same property? I tried, and as you can observe with the small fish and the little piece of meat still hanging, I succeeded totally.&lt;ref name="skeptic1935" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1949, inspired by Bovis,&lt;ref&gt;Drbal, Karel. âThe Struggle for the Pyramid Patent.â Pyramid Power, edited by Max Toth and Greg Nielson. (New York: Warner Destiny, 1976). 141.&lt;/ref&gt; a Czechoslovakian named Karel Drbal applied for a patent on a "Pharaoh's shaving device", a model pyramid alleged to maintain the sharpness of razor blades. According to the patent (#91,304), "The method of maintaining the razor blades and straight razor blades sharp by placing them in the magnetic field in such a way that the sharp edge lies in the direction of the magnetic lines."&lt;ref&gt;Drbal, Karel. {{cite web|url=http://www.amasci.com/freenrg/tors/drbl.html|title=''Patenti Spis c. 91304.'' (Prague: 1959).}} English translation hosted at www.amasci.com. Retrieved November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Drbal alleged that his device would focus "the earth's magnetic field", although he did not make it clear how this would work, or whether the device's shape or materials exerted the effect.&lt;ref&gt;Loxton, Daniel. {{cite web|url=http://www.skeptic.com/productlink/magv12n2|title=''Junior Skeptic'' #23: Pyramid Power}} (Altadena: Skeptics Society, 2006). 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drbal's contention that razors could be sharpened or have their sharpness maintained by alignment with Earth's magnetic field was not new.&lt;ref&gt;Loxton, Daniel. {{cite web|url=http://www.skeptic.com/productlink/magv12n2|title=''Junior Skeptic'' #23: Pyramid Power}}  (Altadena: Skeptics Society, 2006). 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, ''[[The Times]]'' carried letters claiming, "if I oriented my razor bladesâ¦N. and S. by the compassâ¦they tend to last considerably longer"&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Gilbert. Letter. ''The Times.'' 7 Oct. 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; and "The idea of keeping razor blades in a magnetic field is not quite new. About the year 1900 I found this outâ¦."&lt;ref&gt;Grange, William DâOyly. Letter. ''The Times.'' 19 Oct. 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder, authors of the paranormal, visited Czechoslovakia in 1968, where they happened upon a cardboard pyramid manufactured commercially by Drbal.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrander, Sheila, and Lynn Schroeder. ''Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain.'' (New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1970). 339-340.&lt;/ref&gt; They met Drbal,&lt;ref&gt;Ostrander, Sheila, and Lynn Schroeder. ''Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain.'' (New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1970). 342.&lt;/ref&gt; and dedicated a chapter of their popular 1970 book ''Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain'' to pyramid power. This book introduced both the concept of pyramid power and the story about Antoine Bovis to the English-speaking world.

== Origin of the term ==
Debate continues over who coined the term "pyramid power". Author [[Max Toth]] has claimed he coined the phrase,&lt;ref name="loxton1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skeptic.com/junior_skeptic/issue23/interview_Toth.html |title=A Conversation with Max Toth |accessdate=1 December 2008 |last=Loxton |first=Daniel |publisher=''Skeptic.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has [[Patrick Flanagan]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Both authors released books entitled ''Pyramid Power'' in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Toth, Max and Greg Nielson. ''Pyramid Power''. (New York: Warner Destiny, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Patrick. ''Pyramid Power'' (Santa Monica: Pyramid Power â V, Inc, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Toth, this led to a lawsuit by Flanagan against him.&lt;ref name="loxton1" /&gt;

However, the term "pyramid power" in its current usage first appeared in print in [[Sheila Ostrander]] and [[Lynn Schroeder]]'s 1970 book ''Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain''.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrander, Sheila, and Lynn Schroeder. ''Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain.'' (New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1970). 339-348.&lt;/ref&gt; Ostrander and Schroeder claim that "Czechoslovakian researchers" coined the term in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;page 431&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popularisation ==
Flanaganâs book was featured on the cover and in the lyrics of [[The Alan Parsons Project]] album ''[[Pyramid (The Alan Parsons Project album)|Pyramid]]''. "Pyramania", a song from the album, mocked the idea of pyramid power.

Pyramid power was the subject of a famous spoof by [[Martin Gardner]] in his "Mathematical Games" column in the ''[[Scientific American]]'' issue of June 1974, featuring his favorite characters [[Irving Joshua Matrix|Dr. Matrix]] and Iva Matrix.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The theories behind Pyramid Power convinced the Onan Family, hotel and condo developers in [[Gurnee, Illinois]], to build the "Pyramid House" in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldpyramid.com/new/html/about_load.html Pyramid House website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.com/maps?t=k&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=42.413239,-87.941313&amp;spn=0.001531,0.002494&amp;om=1 (Satellite via Google)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Summerhill Pyramid Winery]] in [[Kelowna, British Columbia]] built a four-story replica of the Great Pyramid, alleged by the winery to improve the quality of wine aged within it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.summerhill.bc.ca/Story/The-Pyramid (Summerhill Winery Pyramid Story)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A religion founded in 1975, called [[Summum]], completed the construction of a pyramid called the [[Summum Pyramid]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] in 1979.

Pyramid power was used by the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and their coach [[Red Kelly]] during the [[1975â76 NHL season|1975â76]] quarter-final series, to counter the [[Philadelphia Flyers]]' use of [[Kate Smith]]'s rendering of "[[God Bless America]]". Kelly hung a plastic model of a [[pyramid]] in the team's clubhouse after a pair of away defeats at the start of the series, and each player took turns standing under it for exactly four minutes. The Maple Leafs managed to win all three of their home matches before losing the series' decisive game seven.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19760424&amp;id=VHJIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=S10DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6601,211598&amp;hl=en "Leafs employ 'pyramid power,'" ''The Associated Press'', Saturday, April 24, 1976.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Pratchett]]'s fantasy novel ''[[Pyramids (Discworld)|Pyramids]]'' incorporates elements of the theory when an industry develops based around pyramids' ability to stop time.

It is common in [[New Age]] magazines to see advertisements for open metal-poled pyramids large enough to [[Meditation|meditate]] under. The New Age group [[Share International]], founded by [[Benjamin Creme]], practices a form of meditation called 'Transmission Meditation' using an open metal-poled [[tetrahedron]] in order to tune into the [[Spiritual energy|cosmic energy]] of [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] and other spiritual masters.

== Skepticism ==
The neurologist and skeptic [[Terence Hines]] has written that pyramid power is a [[pseudoscience]] and tests have failed to provide any evidence for its claims:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Influenced by [[Erich von DÃ¤niken]]âs claims that Egyptian mummies had been preserved by some process unknown to science, pyramid power became quite a craze in the world of pseudoscience for a brief time in the mid-1970s. The idea was that the pyramidal shape itself was magical and filled with a mysterious energy and power... Pyramid power claims have actually been tested. Alter (1973) and Simmons (1973) showed that pyramid-shaped containers were no more effective than any other shape at preserving organic matter (flowers or meat) placed in them. Nor did putting dull razor blades in a pyramid-shaped holder restore them to sharpness, contrary to a frequent claim of pyramid power promoters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines|Hines, Terence]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 306. {{ISBN|1-57392-979-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2005, [[MythBusters (2005 season)#Episode 32 â "Jet Pack"|an episode]] of ''[[MythBusters]]'' was aired on the [[Discovery Channel]] in which a basic test of pyramid power was performed, using pyramids built to the specifications found in pyramid power claims, reflecting the location of the King's Chamber in the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. Several claims were tested, concerning food rotting, a flower rotting and a razor blade going dull. With control protocols in place, there was no significant difference between items in pyramids and items outside.

==Early life==
Robert Malley was born in 1963 to Barbara (nÃ©e Silverstein) Malley, a New Yorker who worked for the United Nations delegation of the Algerian [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FNL), and her husband, [[Simon Malley]] (1923â2006), an Egyptian-born Jewish journalist who grew up in Egypt and worked as a foreign correspondent for ''[[Al Gomhuria]]''. The elder Malley spent time in New York, writing about international affairs, particularly about nationalist, anti-imperial movements in Africa, and made a key contribution by putting the FNL on the world map.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Simon Malley|url=https://www.theguardian.com/print/0,,329586505-103684,00.html|work=Guardian|date=September 27, 2006|accessdate=2008-04-21|location=London|first=Victoria|last=Brittain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, the elder Malley moved his familyâincluding son Robertâto France, where he founded the magazine ''Africasia'' (later known as ''Afrique Asia'').

The Malleys remained in France until 1980, when then French president [[ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing]] briefly expelled Simon Malley from the country to New York.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; 

Robert Malley attended [[Yale University]], and was a 1984 [[Rhodes Scholar]] at [[Oxford University]], where he earned a [[Ph.D.]] in political philosophy. There he wrote his doctoral thesis about [[Third-worldism]] and its decline. Malley continued writing about foreign policy, including extended commentary about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He earned a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] at [[Harvard Law School]], where he met his future wife, Caroline Brown.&lt;ref name="press release"&gt;{{cite press release|title=President Names Statement by the Press Secretary on Robert Malley Appointment |url=http://www.clintonpresidentialcenter.org/legacy/100698-president-names-statement-by-the-press-secretary-on-robert-malley-appointment.htm |accessdate=2008-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040912003850/http://www.clintonpresidentialcenter.org/legacy/100698-president-names-statement-by-the-press-secretary-on-robert-malley-appointment.htm |archivedate=September 12, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another fellow law school student was [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name=jdf0220&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/12745/|title=Peace Negotiator Who Advised Obama Campaign Strikes Back at Critics|last=Guttman|first=Nathan|work=Jewish Daily Forward|date=February 20, 2006|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991â1992, Malley clerked for Supreme Court Justice [[Byron White]], while Brown clerked for Supreme Court Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]. As of 2010, the couple has two sons, Miles and Blaise, and one daughter, Frances.&lt;ref name="press release"/&gt;

==Career==
After his Supreme Court clerkship, Malley became a Fellow at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] where he published ''The Call From Algeria: Third Worldism, Revolution, and the Turn to Islam''âa book that charts Algeria's political evolution from the turn of the 20th century to the present, exploring the historical and intellectual underpinnings of the crisis in Algeria. His book received critical acclaim, and Malley was described as "exceptionally well read, creative in seeing connections and influences, and gifted with a graceful, if world-weary writing style."&lt;ref name="ucp"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Call From Algeria|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/6721.php|publisher=University of California Press|date=November 1996|accessdate=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malley served in the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] as Director for Democracy, Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs at the National Security Council from 1994â1996. In that post he helped coordinate refugee policy, efforts to promote democracy and human rights abroad and U.S. policy toward Cuba.&lt;ref name="press release"/&gt; From 1996â1998 he was Executive Assistant to National Security Advisor Sandy Berger. In October 1998, Malley was appointed Special Assistant to President Clinton for Arab-Israeli Affairs, a post he held until the end of the administration in 2001.&lt;ref name="press release"/&gt;

After his service with the administration, Malley became Senior Policy Advisor for the Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Development in Washington, D.C. He later became Program Director for Middle East and North Africa at the [[International Crisis Group]] in Washington, D.C., directing analysts based in [[Amman]], [[Cairo]], [[Beirut]], [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Baghdad]]. Malley's team covers events from [[Iran]] to [[Morocco]], with a heavy focus on the ArabâIsraeli conflict, the situation in [[Iraq]], and Islamist movements throughout the region. Malley also covers developments in the United States that affect policy toward the Middle East.&lt;ref name="ICG"/&gt; 

According to [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign]], Malley provided informal advice to the campaign in the past without having any formal role in the campaign.&lt;ref name=Times050908&gt;{{cite news|title=Barack Obama sacks adviser over talks with Hamas|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article3897414.ece#cid=OTC-RSS&amp;attr=2015164|work=[[The Times]]|date=May 10, 2008|accessdate=2008-05-10|location=London|first=Tom|last=Baldwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 2008, the campaign severed ties with Malley when the British ''[[The Times|Times]]'' reported that Malley had been in discussions with the militant Palestinian group [[Hamas]], listed by the U.S. State Department as a terrorist organization.&lt;ref name="Times050908"/&gt; In response, Malley told ''The Times'' he had been in regular contact with Hamas officials as part of his work with the International Crisis Group. "My job with the International Crisis Group is to meet with all sorts of savory and unsavory people and report on what they say. I've never denied whom I meet with; that's what I do", Malley told NBC News, adding that he informs the State Department about his meetings beforehand and briefs them afterward.&lt;ref name=amnbc0510&gt;{{cite news|title=Informal Obama Adviser Steps Aside Over Hamas Talks|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/05/09/1005411.aspx|publisher=First Read blog at MSNBC website, report by [[Andrea Mitchell]]|date=May 9, 2008|accessdate=2008-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510181918/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/05/09/1005411.aspx|archivedate=May 10, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malley has published many articles in which he calls upon the Israelis (and the international community) to bring Hamas to the negotiating table in order to secure an IsraeliâPalestinian ceasefire and insure that any agreement reached with Palestinians will be respected by the Islamist movements in Palestinian society too (see the section [[Robert Malley#Views|Views]]).

The ''New York Times'' reported on 18 February 2014 that Malley was joining the Obama administration to consult on [[Persian Gulf]] policy as senior director of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.575015|title=Ex-Clinton aide returns to White House with Persian Gulf brief|date=19 February 2014|work=Haaretz|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 March, the National Security Council announced that Malley would be replacing Philip Gordon as the Special Assistant to the President and White House Coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf Region, effective on 6 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/06/statement-nsc-spokesperson-bernadette-meehan-special-assistant-president Statement by NSC Spokesperson Bernadette Meehan on the Special Assistant to the President and White House Coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf Region], WhiteHouse.gov&lt;/ref&gt; On November 30, 2015, it was reported that Malley would become the National Security Council's "ISIS Czar &lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"/&gt; The subject was the lead US negotiator in the 2015 [[Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action|Iran nuclear deal ]] and defended the agreement against a pullout by the Trump administration.&lt;ref&gt;PBS Newshour.

[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/trump-signals-might-pull-iran-nuclear-deal-whats-stake/ PBS website] Retrieved 26 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After Obama left office, Malley returned to the International Crisis Group, serving as the new Vice President for Policy. He is currently the President and CEO.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Views==
Robert Malley has published several articles on the failed [[2000 Camp David Summit]] in which he participated as a member of the U.S. negotiating team. Malley rejects the mainstream opinion that lays all the blame for the failure of the summit on Arafat and the Palestinian delegation. In his analysis, the main reasons were the tactics of then-Israeli prime minister [[Ehud Barak]] and the substance of his proposal which made it impossible for Arafat to accept Barak's offer.&lt;ref name="tragedyoferrors" /&gt;

Malley argues that negotiations with the Palestinians today must include [[Hamas]] because the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) is no longer considered the Palestinian people's sole legitimate representative.&lt;ref name="roadtomecca"&gt;{{cite news|last=Malley|first=Robert|author2=Hussein Agha |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20176|title=The Road to Mecca|work=New York Review of Books|date=2007-05-10|accessdate=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the PLO as antiquated, worn out, barely functioning, and, because it does not include the broad Islamist current principally represented by Hamas, of questionable authority. Malley favors negotiating with Hamas at least for the purpose of a ceasefireâciting Hamas officials in Gaza who made clear they were prepared for such an agreement with Israel.&lt;ref name="timebomb"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/21/opinion/edmalley.php?page=1|title=The Gaza Time Bomb|last=Malley|first=Robert|work=International Herald Tribune|date=2008-01-21|accessdate=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He supports efforts to reach an Israel-Hamas ceasefire which would include an immediate end to Palestinian rocket launches and sniper fire and a freeze on Israeli military attacks on Gaza. Malley's arguments rest on both humanitarian and practical reasons. Malley points to the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade imposed by Israel]] on the [[Gaza Strip]] has not stopped [[Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel|Hamas's rocket attacks]] on nearby Israeli towns and notes that the siege has caused millions of Gazans to suffer from lack of medicine, fuel, electricity and other essential commodities, so cease-fire would avoid "enormous loss of life, a generation of radicalized and embittered Gazans, and another bankrupt peace process."&lt;ref name="timebomb" /&gt;

In addition, Malley calls for Israel, the Palestinians, Lebanon, Syria and other Arab countries to resume negotiations on all tracks based on the [[Arab Peace Initiative]], which promises full Arab recognition and normalization of relations with Israel in the context of a comprehensive peace agreement in exchange for a withdrawal of Israeli forces from the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]] to the 1967 borders, the recognition of an independent Palestinian state with [[East Jerusalem]] as its capital, and a "just solution" for [[Palestinian refugee]]s.&lt;ref name="roadtomecca" /&gt;

"Today, Malley still stands out for his calls to engage in negotiations with Syria and Iran and for finding 'some kind of accommodation' with Hamas", ''The Jewish Daily Forward'' reported in February 2008.&lt;ref name=jdf0220 /&gt;

==Criticism from Israel supporters==
Malley was criticized by supporters of Israel after co-authoring an article in the July 8, 2001 edition of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' arguing that the blame for the failure of the [[2000 Camp David Summit]] should be divided among all three leaders who were present at the summit, Arafat, Barak, and [[Bill Clinton]], not just Arafat, as was suggested by some mainstream policy analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fictions About the Failure At Camp David |first=Robert |last=Malley |date=July 8, 2001 |work=[[New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/08/opinion/fictions-about-the-failure-at-camp-david.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Later, however, other scholars and former officials voiced similar views to those of Malley", according to a February 20, 2008 article in ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]''.&lt;ref name=jdf0220/&gt;

Malley and his views have come under attack from other critics, such as [[Martin Peretz]] of the magazine ''[[The New Republic]]'', who has opined that Malley is "anti-Israel", a "rabid hater of Israel. No question about it", and that several of his articles in the ''New York Review of Books'' were "deceitful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=6bd11ed5-bf80-44a0-b683-a0563e11ab89 |title=Can Friends of Israel â and Jews â Trust Obama? In a word, yes.|last=Peretz|first=Martin|work=The New Republic |date=2008-01-31 |accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the conservative webzine ''[[The American Thinker]]'', Ed Lasky asserted that Malley "represents the next generation of anti-Israel activism."&lt;ref name=jdf0220/&gt;

Malley told the ''Jewish Daily Forward'' that "it tends to cross the line when it becomes as personal and as un-based in facts as some of these have been." While he loved and respected his father, he said, their views sometimes differed, and it is "an odd guilt by association" fallacy to criticize him based on his father's views.&lt;ref name=jdf0220/&gt; Simon Malley was called a sympathizer of the PLO by Daniel Pipes.&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, Daniel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CBsSovwFpbcC&amp;pg=PA137 ''The Long Shadow: Culture and Politics in the Middle East''] Transaction Publishers: 1989. {{ISBN|0-88738-849-3}}, p 137, as presented in a Google Books search. Retrieved on January 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to what they called "vicious, personal attacks" on Malley, five Jewish, former U.S. government officialsâformer National Security Advisor [[Sandy Berger]], Ambassador [[Martin Indyk]], Ambassador [[Daniel C. Kurtzer]], Ambassador [[Dennis Ross]], and former State Department Senior Advisor [[Aaron David Miller]]âpublished a letter (dated February 12, 2008) in the ''New York Review of Books'' defending Malley.&lt;ref name=jdf0220 /&gt; They wrote that the attacks on Malley were "unfair, inappropriate, and wrong", and objected to what they called an attempt "to undermine the credibility of a talented public servant who has worked tirelessly over the years to promote ArabâIsraeli peace and US national interests."&lt;ref&gt;Letters to the NYRB: [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21170 In Defense of Robert Malley] ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', March 20, 2008 p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; This view is also shared by [[M.J. Rosenberg]], Director of Policy for Israel Policy Forum and a former editor at the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]], who condemned the attacks on Malley, writing that Malley is "pro-Israel" and the only reason he is being criticized is because he supports IsraeliâPalestinian negotiations.&lt;ref name="rosenberg"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Michael|title=Smearing Rob Malley|work=The Huffington Post |date=2008-02-18 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mj-rosenberg/smearing-rob-malley_b_87290.html|accessdate=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Playing janken - school in Japan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=|In [[Education in Japan|Japanese schools]] the ''senpaiâkÅhai'' relation is taught from an early age as an integral part of daily life.]]
{{see also|Japanese honorifics}}

'''''Senpai''''' ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:åè¼©|åè¼©]]}}, "earlier colleague") and '''''kÅhai''''' ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:å¾è¼©|å¾è¼©]]}}, "later colleague") are terms from the [[Japanese language]] describing an informal hierarchical interpersonal relationship found in organizations, associations, clubs, businesses, and schools in [[Japan]].  The concept is based in [[Japanese philosophy]] and has permeated [[Culture of Japan|Japanese society]].

The relationship is an interdependent one, as a ''senpai'' requires a ''kÅhai'' and vice versa, and establishes a bond determined by the date of entry to an organization.  The ''kÅhai'' defers to the ''senpai''{{'}}s seniority and experience, and speaks to the ''senpai'' using [[Japanese honorifics|honorific language]].

==Concept==

The relationship is an interdependent one, as a ''senpai'' requires a ''kÅhai'' and vice versa,{{sfn|Blomberg|1994|p=203}} and establishes a bond determined by the date of entry to an organization.{{sfn|Kodansha|1994|p=310}}  ''Senpai'' refers to the member of higher experience, hierarchy, level, or age in the organization who offers assistance, friendship, and counsel to a new or inexperienced member, known as the ''kÅhai'', who must demonstrate gratitude, respect, and occasionally personal loyalty.{{sfn|Kodansha|1994|p=310}}{{sfn|Matsumoto|2005|pp=1480â1481}}  The ''Senpai'' acts at the same time as a friend.{{sfn|Kodansha|1994|p=310}}{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=187}}  This relation is similar to the interpersonal relation between tutor and tutored in Eastern culture, but differs in that the ''senpai'' and ''kÅhai'' must work in the same organization.{{sfn|Kopp|2010}}

The relation originates in [[Confucianism|Confucian]] teaching, as well as the morals and ethics that have arrived in Japan from ancient China and have spread throughout various aspects of Japanese philosophy.  The ''senpaiâkÅhai'' relation is a vertical hierarchy (like a fatherâson relation) that emphasizes respect for authority, for the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], and for one's elders, eliminating all forms of internal competition and reinforcing the unity of the organization.{{sfn|Matsumoto|2005|pp=1480â1481}}{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=187}}

Over time this mechanism has allowed the transfer of experience and knowledge, as well as the expansion of acquaintances, to maintaining the art of teaching alive.  It also allows the development of beneficial experiences between both, as the ''kÅhai'' benefits from the ''senpai''{{'}}s knowledge and the ''senpai'' learns new experiences from the ''kÅhai'' by way of developing a sense of responsibility.{{sfn|Panek|2006|p=135}}{{sfn|Hassell|1983|p=61}}{{sfn|Rubio|Brody|Castrogiovanni|2008|p=37}} This comradeship does not imply friendship; a ''senpai'' and ''kÅhai'' may become friends, but such is not an expectation.{{sfn|Brinton|2001|p=159}}

The [[Korean language|Korean]] terms [[Korean_honorifics#Seonbaeâhubae|''seonbae'' and ''hubae'']] are written with the same [[Kanji|Chinese characters]] and indicate a similar seniorâjunior relationship. The terms may have derived from Japanese, and may have had Chinese origins, though the ''senpaiâkÅhai'' relationship does not exist in Chinese culture.{{sfn|Sechiyama|2013|p=169}} However, it is close to the system of [[sifu]]âstudent system of Chinese martial arts.

==History==

[[File:Hamamatsu GirlsHighSchool 1911 SportsDay Naginata.jpg|thumb|alt=|Demonstrating the use of the ''[[naginata]]'' at a sports festival in [[Hamamatsu]] in 1911.  Discipline training in school clubs historically has influenced the ''senpaiâkÅhai'' system with students.]]

The ''senpaiâkÅhai'' system has existed since the beginning of [[History of Japan|Japanese history]].  Three elements have had a significant impact on its development: [[Confucianism]], the traditional Japanese family system, and the [[Civil Code of Japan|Civil Code of 1898]].{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=188}}

Confucianism arrived from China between the 6th and 9th centuries, but the derived line of thought that brought about deep social changes in Japan was [[Neo-Confucianism]], which became the official doctrine of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] (1603â1867).  The precepts of loyalty and [[filial piety]] as [[tribute]] ({{lang|ja|æè²¢}} ''{{transl|ja|chÅkÅ}}'') dominated the Japanese at the time, as respect for elders and ancestor worship that Chinese Confucianism taught were well accepted by the Japanese, and these influences have spread throughout daily life.  Like other Chinese influences, the Japanese adopted these ideas selectively and in their own manner, so that the "loyalty" in Confucianism was taken as loyalty to a [[DaimyÅ|feudal lord]] or the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]].{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|pp=188â189}}

The Japanese family system ({{lang|ja|å®¶}} ''{{transl|ja|[[Ie (Japanese family system)|ie]]}}'') was also regulated by Confucian codes of conduct and had an influence on the establishment of the ''senpaiâkÅhai'' relation.  In this family system the father, as male head, had absolute power over the family and the eldest son inherited the family property.  The father had power because he was the one to receive an education and was seen to have superior ethical knowledge.  Since reverence for superiors was considered a virtue in Japanese society, the wife and children had to obey it. In addition to the hereditary system, only the eldest son could receive his father's possessions, and neither the eldest daughter nor the younger children received anything from him.{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=189}}

The last factor influencing the ''senpaiâkÅhai'' system was the Civil Code of 1898, which strengthened the rules of privilege of [[seniority]] and reinforced the traditional family system, giving clear definitions of hierarchical values within the family.  This was called ''koshusei'' ({{lang|ja|æ¸ä¸»å¶}}, "family-head system"), in which the head of the household had the right to command his family and the eldest son inherited that position.  These statutes were abolished in [[1947]], after the [[surrender of Japan]] at the end of [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]].  These ideals nevertheless remained during the following years as a psychological influence in Japanese society.{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=189}}

==Terminology==

The seniority rules are reflected in various grammatical rules in the [[Japanese language]].  A person who speaks respectfully to a superior uses [[Honorific speech in Japanese|honorific language]] ({{lang|ja|æ¬èª}} ''{{transl|ja|keigo}}''), which is divided into three categories:{{sfn|Matsuura|Porta Fuentes|2002|p=261}}{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=189}}

* ''{{transl|ja|Sonkeigo}}'' ({{lang|ja|å°æ¬èª}}, "respectful language"): used to denote respect towards a superior with or of whom one speaks, including the actions, objects, characteristics, and persons related to this person.{{sfn|Matsuura|Porta Fuentes|2002|p=261}}
* ''{{transl|ja|KenjÅgo}}'' ({{lang|ja|è¬è­²èª}}, "humble language"): in contrast to ''sonkeigo'', with ''kenjÅgo'' the speaker shows respect to a superior by lowering or deprecating him or herself.{{sfn|Matsuura|Porta Fuentes|2002|p=262}}
* ''{{transl|ja|Teineigo}}'' ({{lang|ja|ä¸å¯§èª}}, "polite language"): differs from the other two in that the speaker shows only to the speaker rather than those being spoken about.&lt;!-- this could be improved --&gt;  Use of the verb ''desu'' ("to be") and the verb ending ''-masu'' are examples of ''teineigo''.{{sfn|Matsuura|Porta Fuentes|2002|p=261}}

''Sonkeigo'' and ''kenjÅgo'' have expressions (verbs, nouns, and special prefixes) particular to the type of language; for example, the ordinary Japanese verb for "to do" is ''suru'', but in ''sonkeigo'' is ''nasaru'' and in ''kenjÅgo'' is ''itasu''.{{sfn|Matsuura|Porta Fuentes|2002|pp=263â265}}

Another rule in the hierarchical relation is the use of honorific suffixes of address.  A ''senpai'' addresses a ''kÅhai'' with the suffix ''-kun'' after the ''kÅhai''{{'}}s given name or surname, regardless if the ''kÅhai'' is male or female.  A ''kÅhai'' similarly addresses a ''senpai'' with the suffix ''-senpai'' or ''-san''; it is extremely unusual for a ''kÅhai'' to refer to a ''senpai'' with the suffix ''-sama'', which indicates the highest level of respect to the person spoken to.{{sfn|Matsuura|Porta Fuentes|2002|pp=115â116}}&lt;!--  Although the ''senpaiâkÅhai'' relation is marked with respect language, the suffixes ''-kun'', ''-senpai'' or ''-san'' are used to indicate there is also a relation of comradery and confidence between the two.  ''Senpai'' can also be used as a pronoun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/lexicon.php?id=20 ''Sempai'']. ''[[Anime News Network]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Prevalence==

[[File:1gB.jpg|thumb|At the international level the ''senpaiâkÅhai'' relation has spread through [[martial arts]], in which the members of different ''[[kyÅ«]]'' and ''[[Dan (rank)|dan]]'' levels are sorted by belt colour.]]

One place the ''senpaiâkÅhai'' relation applies to its greatest extent in Japan is in schools.  For example, in junior and senior high schools (especially in school clubs) third-year students (who are the oldest) demonstrate great power as ''senpais''.  It is common in school sports clubs for new ''kÅhais'' to have to perform basic tasks such as retrieving balls, cleaning playing fields, taking care of equipment, and even wash elder students' clothes.  They must also bow to or salute their ''senpais'' when congratulated,{{sfn|Sugimoto|2003|p=132}}{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=191}} and ''senpais'' may punish ''kÅhais'' or treat them severely.{{sfn|Blomberg|1994|p=203}}{{sfn|Sugimoto|2003|p=132}}

The main reason for these humble actions is that it is believed that team members can become good players only if they are submissive, obedient, and follow the orders of the trainer or captain, and thus become a humble, responsible, and cooperative citizen in the future.  Relations in Japanese schools also place a stronger emphasis on the age than on the abilities of students.  The rules of superiority between a ''senpai'' and a ''kÅhai'' are analogous to the teacherâstudent relation, in which the age and experience of the teacher must be respected and never questioned.{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=191}}

The ''senpaiâkÅhai'' relation is weaker in universities, as students of a variety of ages attend the same classes; students show respect to older members primarily through polite language (''teineigo'').  Vertical seniority rules nevertheless prevail between teachers based on academic rank and experience.{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=191}}

The ''senpaiâkÅhai'' system also prevails in Japanese businesses.  The social environment in Japanese businesses is regulated by two standards: the system of superiority and the system of [[permanent employment]].  The status, salary, and position of employees depend heavily of seniority, and veteran employees generally take the highest positions and receive higher salaries than their subordinates.  Until the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, employment was guaranteed for life and thus such employees did not have to worry about losing their positions.{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=191}}

The ''senpaiâkÅhai'' relation is a cornerstone in interpersonal relations within the Japanese business world; for example, at meetings the lower-level employee should sit in the seat closest to the door, called ''shimoza'' ({{lang|ja|ä¸åº§}}, "lower seat"), while the senior employee (sometimes the boss) sits next to some important guest in a position called ''kamiza'' ({{lang|ja|ä¸åº§}}, "upper seat").  During meetings, most employees do not give their opinions, but simply listen and concur with their superiors, although they can express opinions with the prior consent of the employees of greater rank and influence in the company.{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=192}}

Outside Japan, the ''senpaiâkÅhai'' relation is often found in the teaching of [[Japanese martial arts]], though misunderstandings arise due to lack of historical knowledge, and as the vertical social hierarchy of Japan does not exist in Western cultures.{{sfn|Lowry|2002|pp=28, 122}}

==Issues==

Despite the ''senpaiâkÅhai'' relation's deep roots in Japanese society, there have been changes since the end of the 20th century in academic and business organizations.  ''KÅhais'' no longer show as much respect to the experience of their ''senpais'', the relation has become more superficial, and the age factor has begun to lose importance.  The student body has diversified with Japanese students who have spent a large part of their lives overseas and have returned to Japan, as well as foreign students without a mentality rooted in the Japanese hierarchical system.{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=187}}

The collapse of [[Japanese asset price bubble|the economic bubble]] in the early 1990s caused a high level of unemployment, including the laying off of high-ranked employees.  Companies since then first began to consider employees' skills rather than age or length of service with the company, due to which many long-serving employees lost their positions over being incapable of fulfilling expectations.  Gradually many companies have had to restructure their salary and promotion systems, and seniority has thus lost some influence in Japanese society.{{sfn|Davies|Ikeno|2002|p=187}}

Attitudes towards the ''senpaiâkÅhai'' system vary from appreciation for traditions and the benefits of a good ''senpaiâkÅhai'' relationship; to reluctant acquiescence; to antipathy.  Those who criticize the system find it arbitrary and unfair, that ''senpais'' were often pushy, and that the system results in students who are shy or afraid of standing out from the group. For example, some ''kÅhais'' fear that if they outperform their ''senpais'' in an activity, their ''senpai'' will [[Face (sociological concept)|lose face]], for which ''kÅhais'' must apologize.  In some cases, the relation is open to violence and bullying.  Most Japanese peopleâeven those who criticize itâaccept the ''senpaiâkÅhai'' system as [[Common sense|common-sense]] aspect of society, straying from which will have inevitably negative social consequences.{{sfn|McVeigh|2015|pp=220â224}}

{{Italic title}}
'''''Thought-Forms: A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation''''' is a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] book compiled by the members of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]] [[Annie Besant|A. Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]]. It was originally published in 1901 in London.{{sfn|Melton|2001b|p=1566}}{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=248}} From the standpoint of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], it tells regarding visualization of thoughts, experiences, emotions and music. Drawings of the "thought-forms" were performed by painters Varley, Prince, and McFarlane.{{sfnm|Gettings|1978|1p=136|Tillett|1986|2p=224}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Vladimir Trefilov|Trefilov]], Theosophy, unlike an academic science, "views the whole world as a manifestation of thought in all categories of matter. [[Occultism|Occult science]] know about the existence of higher types of rarefied matter. Man is in no way limited by the physical world alone."{{sfn|Ð¢ÑÐµÑÐ¸Ð»Ð¾Ð²|1994|p=234}} [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] wrote, "There are [[Plane (esotericism)|other worlds]] than that which our senses reveal to us, [[clairvoyance|other senses]] than those which we share with the lower animals, other forces than those of material nature."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|2008|p=373}} Thus, it is necessary to develop the "new senses" in order to "perceive thought-forms."{{sfn|Ellwood|1986|p=117}} Academic science explains the visualization of sensations of a mentally healthy person by a phenomenon of the [[synesthesia]].{{sfn|Britannica}}}}

== From history of compilation ==
This book has become the result of the joint work of the authors, which began in 1895, when they had started an investigation of "the subtle matter of the universe."{{sfn|Wessinger}} They were interested the work of the human mind as, according their claim, this work "extrudes into the external world" the thought-forms.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}

In September 1896, Besant reported in [[Lucifer (magazine)|''Lucifer'']] that "two clairvoyant Theosophists" (whose personalities were not disclosed in the journal, although some members of the Society knew about them) had started "observing the substance of thought." Her article named ''Thought-Forms''{{refn|group=note|Leadbeater does not appear here as a co-author of Besant, nevertheless, according to [[Olav Hammer|Hammer]], after [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky's]] death, it was he who became the main ideologist of the "second generation" of the Theosophists.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=509}}}} was accompanied by four pages of pictures of diverse thought-forms which the investigators "had observed and described to an artist."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}{{refn|group=note|A tradition of "seeing thoughts" already existed in [[spiritualism]]. Dr. Baraduc, a famous French psychiatrist, had informed the "Acadamie de Medecine" in 1896 that he had succeeded to photograph thoughts.{{sfn|Melton|2001b|p=1565}}{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=990}}}} The colour sketches of the unknown performance were depicting: on the first plateâthought-forms of "devotion," "sacrifice," and "devotional," on the second oneâthree types of "anger," on the third oneâthree types of "love" ("undirected," "directed," and "grasping"), and on the fourth oneâthought-forms of "jealousy," "intellect," and "ambition."{{sfn|Index}} Besant gave the article scientific coloring, not forgetting to mention [[Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen|RÃ¶ntgen]], Baraduc,{{sfn|Melton|2001a}} [[Carl Reichenbach|Reichenbach]], "vibrations and the ether."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}

This "small but influential book",{{refn|group=note|According to the scholars of religious studies, the authors of the ''Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America.''{{sfn|Keller|2006}}}} which contains color pictures of thought-forms that the authors said are created "in subtle spirit-matter," was published in 1901. The book affirms that "the quality" of thoughts influences the life experience of their creator, and that they "can affect" other people.{{sfn|Keller|2006|p=755}}{{refn|group=note|As Leadbeater noted, "books are specially strong centres of thought-forms, and their unnoticed influence in a man's life is often a powerful one."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 15}}}}

== Basic concepts ==
=== Meaning of color ===
[[File:Colorchart.jpg|thumb|left|160px|&lt;center&gt;Frontispiece. The meanings of colours.&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors write that they, like many theosophists, are convinced that "thoughts are things," and the task of their book is to help the reader understand this.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=16}}{{refn|group=note|[[Gary Lachman|Lachman]] noted that it is "the central maxim of ''Thought-Forms.''"{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}} The frontispiece of the book contains a table "The meanings of colours" of thought-forms and [[Aura (paranormal)|human aura]] associated with feelings and emotions, beginning with "High Spirituality" (light blueâin the upper left corner) and ending by "Malice" (blackâin the lower right corner), 25 colors in all.{{refn|group=note|See the frontispiece of ''Thought-Forms,'' 1901. For comparison, see table "Auric Colors and Their Meanings"{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=64â66}} and Ch. "Colours."{{sfn|Powell|1927|loc=Ch. 3}}}}{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}{{sfn|ÐÐ¸ÑÐ°ÑÐµÐ²Ð°|2010|p=29}}{{refn|group=note|"Every thought form bears the same color that it would possess if it had been retained in the body of the aura itself."{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=34}}}} The authors argue that human aura is "the outer part of the cloud-like substance of his higher bodies, interpenetrating each other, and extending beyond the confines of his physical body."{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=55}} The [[Mental body|mental]] and [[Astral body|desire]] bodies (two human higher bodies) are "those chiefly concerned with the appearance of what are called thought-forms."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=17|Johnston|2012|2p=158}}{{refn|group=note|[[Robert Ellwood|Ellwood]] wrote that, according to theosophy, "auras may be made up of a complex combination of etheric, astral, and mental matter which the clairvoyant is able to perceive, although the most significant ones originate on the border of the mental and astral planes, where the activity of the former is reflected in the configurations of astral matter. When comparable patterns appear as a 'cloud' above or near a person, they may be called 'thought-forms' and as such have been reported in theosophical literature."{{sfn|Ellwood|1986|p=115}}}}{{refn|group=note|Thought-forms are created from the same matter from which the aura is formed, and have the same general properties, in particular, color. Knowledge of the properties of an aura of man is necessary for a proper "understanding of the nature of the thought-forms."{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=31}} According to Powell, the term "thought-forms" is "not wholly accurate," because in the overwhelming majority of cases they are being formed by both astral and mental bodies. It would be more correct to call them ''thought-emotion forms.''{{sfn|Powell|1927|pp=43, 55}} Gettings wrote that in studying the illustrations from this book "one cannot help observing that they do not really relate to thought so much as to feeling â they are really emotion forms rather than thought forms."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Tillett, "Whether or not there is scientific validity in claims about the aura, it remains significant that Leadbeater's descriptions (given initially in an article [''The Aura''] in ''[[The Theosophist]]'' in [December] 1895{{sfn|IndexT}}) have been more or less repeated by later researchers, both scientific and occult. The earliest scientific study of the aura [''The Human Atmosphere,'' 1911] was published by [[Walter John Kilner]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=953}}}}

=== Three principles and three classes ===
The book states that "the production of all thought-forms" is based on three major principles:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Quality of thought determines colour.
# Nature of thought determines form.
# Definiteness of thought determines clearness of outline.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=31|ÐÐ¸ÑÐ°ÑÐµÐ²Ð°|2010|2p=29|Jones|2012|3p=54}}{{refn|group=note|[[Alice Bailey|Bailey]] has contraposed the "clear and well-defined, pulsating with the spirit of service" thought-forms of the initiated occultist with the "disjointed, unconnected, and uncorrelated" thought-forms created by the "mass of men."{{sfn|Bailey|2012|p=87}} As Powell wrote, many people go through life, literally tightly locked in their own cells, which they themselves have built, "surrounded by masses of forms created by their habitual thoughts."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=47}} Leadbeater noted later that most people can not free themselves from the influence "of the great crowd of thought-forms which constitute [preconceived] public opinion; and because of those they never really see the truth at all."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 10}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Thought-forms, or 'an artificial [[elemental]]s,' have a huge impact on the earthly life of people, performing certain functions depending on the desires and direction of the thought that created them."{{sfn|Ð¢ÑÐµÑÐ¸Ð»Ð¾Ð²|1994|p=237}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authors define the following three classes of thought-forms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# That which takes the image of the thinker. When a man thinks of himself as in some distant place, or wishes earnestly to be in that place, he makes a thought-form in his own image which appears there.
# That which takes the image of some material object. [The painter who forms a conception of his future picture builds it up out of the matter of his mental body, and then projects it into space in front of him, keeps it before his mind's eye, and copies it. The novelist in the same way builds images of his character in mental matter, and by the exercise of his will moves these puppets from one position or grouping to another, so that the plot of his story is literally acted out before him.]{{refn|group=note|A comparison of the thought-forms of literary heroes with marionettes, Leadbeater repeated in 1913 in his next Theosophical book.{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 6}}}}
# That which takes a form entirely its own,{{refn|group=note|Pisareva wrote that the thought-forms belonged to this category may be named the "symbolic forms."{{sfn|ÐÐ¸ÑÐ°ÑÐµÐ²Ð°|2010|p=27}}}} expressing its inherent qualities in the matter which it draws round it. [Those of which we here give specimens are almost wholly of that class.]{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=36|ÐÐ¸ÑÐ°ÑÐµÐ²Ð°|2010|2p=26}}{{sfn|Harris}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Examples of thought-forms ==
[[File:Form16.jpg|thumb|left|160px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 16. Self-Renunciation.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=44}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "a pale blue lotus."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}} Blue color expresses "spirituality."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=66}} "A thought of definite, well-sustained devotion may assume a form closely resembling a flower."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=57}} The more purified desires and thoughts of man, the more "radiant and beautiful" are his thought-forms which he create.{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
"To paint in earth's dull colours the forms clothed in the living light of other worlds, â Besant writes in the foreword, â is a hard and thankless task." The authors claim that the images in the book "are not imaginary forms, prepared as some dreamer thinks that they ought to appear." Rather, "they
are representations of forms actually observed as thrown off by ordinary men and women." And the authors sincerely hope that they will force the reader "realise the nature and power of his thoughts, acting as a stimulus to the noble, a curb on the base."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1pp=6, 39|Breen|2014|2p=110}}

=== Created by emotions ===
[[File:Form13.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 13. Grasping Animal Affection.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=43}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "brown-red swirls."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} "Thoughts of a greedy, lustful, or malicious character appear differently from those of a noble, selfless, loving nature."{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Thoughts in which selfishness or greed are prominent usually take a hooked form, the hooks in some case actually clawing round the object desired."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=56}} Leadbeater has compared similar thought-forms with the "[[grappling hook]]s."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 8}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
In Fig. 13 shows the thought-form created by "a strong craving for personal possession." Its color has dull unpleasing hue "deadened with the heavy tint indicative of selfishness." The curving hooks are its especially characteristic. Creator this thought-form had never "conception of the self-sacrificing love which pours itself out in joyous service," no thinking of return.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=44}}{{refn|group=note|Tillett saw here only the "brown-red swirls."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} An especially powerful class of this kind of thought-forms takes on "the appearance of a nebulous octopus, with long, winding, clinging tentacles, striving to wrap around the other person," and to drag him toward the aura of creator.{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=33}}}}{{refn|group=note|"A gross sensual love will be a dull and heavy crimson"... The mutual influence of thoughts is like "adding fuel to the fire." If someone for a long time is fraught with low thoughts, then into his mind will pour such a vicious stream that he will be horrified if he understands what he is doing with himself.{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=65, 84}} According to Leadbeater, do not need to collect photos of actresses [and actors], as "they always attract the most undesirable thought-forms from hosts of impure-minded people."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 15}}}}
[[File:Form19.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 19. The Intention to Know.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=51|Gettings|1987|2p=48|Breen|2014|3p=112}}{{refn|group=note|"I asked him when he saw this curious shape."{{sfn|Jinarajadasa|2003}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors write that a form in Fig. 19 at the top is a specific thought-form which had accompanied a question demonstrating deep thought and penetration. The first variant of the answer did not fully satisfy the questioner, and his desire to achieve a full and comprehensive answer was expressed in the fact that his "thought-form deepened in colour and changed into the second of the two shapes (in Fig. 19 below), resembling a corkscrew even more closely than before."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=51}}{{refn|group=note|[[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa|Jinarajadasa]] informed that on his question to Leadbeater "when he saw this curious shape" he answered that it is a creation of Mr. [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett]], "who tried to 'worm' things out of him, when he appeared to be holding back some knowledge which Mr. Sinnett wanted."{{sfn|Jinarajadasa|2003}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Orange, of a bright shade, represents pride and ambition. Yellow, in its various shades, represents intellectual power."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=65}} Gold colour "indicates pure intellect applied to philosophy or mathematics."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=12}}}}
[[File:Forms22-23.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 22, 23. Murderous Rage and Sustained Anger.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "a bright red spike."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|pp=224â225}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
Fig. 22 and 23 are thought-forms of a "murderous rage" (on the right) and a "sustained anger" (on the left). The first form was taken "from the aura of a rough and partially intoxicated man in the [[East End]] of London," when he was knocking down a woman; a flare flashed in her direction, triggering an explosion of horrorâshe recognized that one would be struck. In the same illustration drawned a "stiletto-like dart" directed to the lower left corner: it is a thought "of steady anger, intense and desiring vengeance, of the quality of murder, sustained through years, and directed against a person who had inflicted a deep injury on the one who sent it forth."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|Tillett has seen on the left "a bright red spike."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} Sustained anger takes the form of "a sharp, red stiletto."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=58}} The thought-form of anger has a color of black and red, with characteristic flares.{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=34}}}}{{refn|group=note|Red color seen in the form of bright red flares like the lightning flash shows anger. These are "usually shown on a black background in the case of anger arising from hatred or malice."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=64â65}}}}
[[File:Sudden Fright.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 27. Sudden Fright.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=55}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "a cloud of red-grey crescents."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}} "''Sudden Fright'' appears as a series of grey and red crescent shapes bursting out of the aura."{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Greed for alcohol - Annie Besant Thought Form - Project Gutenberg eText 16269.PNG|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 29. Greed for Drink.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=56}}{{refn|group=note|"The craving for alcohol produced undesirable brown-red hooks."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}}}}{{refn|group=note|"The thought of the desire for drink could not enter the body of a purely temperate man. It would strike upon his astral body, but it could not penetrate and it would then return to the sender."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=49}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors state that when a person is suddenly frightened, then has a place the effect shown in Fig. 27. It is emphasized that "all the crescents" on the right, which apparently have been emitted earlier than others, do not show anything other than "the livid grey of fear; but a moment later the man is already partially recovering from the shock, and beginning to feel angry that he allowed himself to be startled." The later crescents have changed to scarlet, and it evidences the "mingling of anger and fear," while the last crescent is quite scarlet, and it shows that "already the fright is entirely overcome, and only the annoyance remains."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=55}}{{refn|group=note|According to Tillett, here you can see "a cloud of red-grey crescents."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}} Gray color of a specific shade, "almost that of a corpse", demonstrates "fear and terror." Red color shows anger.{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=64}}}}

=== Created by experiences ===
Beginning from Fig. 30, "the book changes course in an interesting way," moving from the illustrations of individual thoughts and emotions to the narrative of events.{{sfn|Breen|2014|pp=111â112}} Besant and Leadbeater write that occasioned by a "terrible accident" at sea, three thought-forms depicted in Fig. 30 "were seen simultaneously, arranged exactly as represented, though in the midst of indescribable confusion." The authors continue:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"They are instructive as showing how differently people are affected by sudden and serious danger. One form [on the right] shows nothing but an eruption of the livid grey of fear, rising out of a basis of utter selfishness: and unfortunately there were many such as this. The shattered appearance of the thought-form shows the violence and completeness of the explosion, which in turn indicates that the whole soul of that person was possessed with blind, frantic terror, and that the overpowering sense of personal danger excluded for the time every higher feeling."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=57|Breen|2014|2p=112}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authors explain that the thought-form in Fig. 30 on the left shows an attempt to find "solace in prayer," and in this way overcome fear. This can be seen under a grayish-blue color, "which lifts itself hesitatingly upwards." Yet it is seen that judging by "the lower part of the thought-form, with its irregular outline and its falling fragments, that there is in reality almost as much fright here" as in the case on the right. Thus, one person has a chance to restore "self-control," while the other remains "an abject slave to overwhelming emotion." The thought-form at upper has been created by a member of the ship crew responsible for the lives of passengers, and it demonstrates a "very striking contrast" of the weakness manifesting in two forms from below. Herein shown "a powerful, clear-cut and definite thought, obviously full" of energy and determination. Orange color speaks of his confidence in ability to manage with the difficulty. The "brilliant yellow" means that his intellect is already at work upon the problem.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=57}}{{refn|group=note|Gray color of a specific shade demonstrates "fear and terror."

Fig. 31 is another declarative piece, depicting "the thought-form of an actor while waiting to go upon the stage." The authors expound that the orange band indicates self-confidence,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"yet in spite of this there is a good deal of unavoidable uncertainty as to how this new play may strike the fickle public, and on the whole the doubt and fear overbalance the certainty and pride, for there is more of the pale grey than of the orange, and the whole thought-form vibrates like a flag flapping in a gale of wind." {{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=59|Breen|2014|2p=112}}{{refn|group=note|Gray color represents fear.

In the thought-form on the left in Fig. 34, as the authors explain, there is nothing but "the highest and most beautiful" feelings. At the base of the thought-form, you can see "a full expression of deep sympathy," the light green color shows the understanding of the suffering of the deceased's relatives and condolence with them, and the strip "of deeper green shows the attitude of the thinker towards the dead man himself." The dense rose-color shows love to both the deceased and the surrounding, while the upper part, consisting of a cone and stars above it, indicates a feeling in connection with thoughts of death: the blue express "its devotional aspect," while as "the violet shows the thought of, and the power to respond to, a noble ideal" and the ability to match, the stars reflect "the spiritual aspirations."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=62}}{{refn|group=note|According to Gettings, the thought-form to the left is a spiritual one "which was a result of the highest meditation in the face of the loss of the loved one."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}} "Pale, luminous blue-green" shows deep sympathy and compassion. "Luminous lilac-blue, usually accompanied by sparkling golden stars" is associated with a high level of spirituality and noble aspirations. Rose color expresses selfless love.{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=12}}}} In the same figure, the thought-form on the right reflects nothing but only "profound depression, fear and selfishness." His only definite feelings are despair and the sense of his personal loss, and these show themselves in proper strips of brown-grey and leaden grey color, while the "very curious downward protrusion" demonstrates the strong selfish desire to raise the dead man into his earth life.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=62}}{{refn|group=note|Dark gray color represents "depression and melancholy."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=64}}}}{{refn|group=note|Gettings wrote that the form to the right demonstrates a distress of the materialist forming from the mind of one "who is unable to accept that death is a liberation into a higher world, and the proboscis-like feeler which runs from the base of this thought form is said to be reaching into the grave, as if to bring back the dead body."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}} "The man who had lived in the ordinary blank ignorance with regard to death, had no thought in connection with it but selfish fear and depression; whereas the man who understood the facts was entirely free from any suggestion of those feelings, for the only sentiments evoked in him were those of sympathy and affection for the mourners, and of devotion and high aspiration."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 11}}}}

The description of the event depicted in the book on Fig. 38, as noted a historian Breen, "anticipates the 1960s" as well with its conjunction of meditation and idealism: this thought-form was "generated by one who was trying, while sitting in [[meditation]], to fill his mind with an aspiration to enfold all mankind in order to draw them upward towards the high ideal which shone so clearly before his eyes."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=67|Breen|2014|2p=113}} The ability of the authors to see the "vibrations of ideas, emotions,  and sounds" demonstrates, in his opinion, "a sort of [[spirit]]ual [[synesthesia]]" which transform the religious act into a [[Neurology|neurological]] phenomenon.{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=110}}

The authors write that the thought-form shown in Fig. 41 was accompanied by "the devotional aspiration" to that [[Logos]] may thus be manifested through the man in meditation. It is this religious feeling gives a "pale blue" shade to the five-pointed star. This form has been used "for many ages as a symbol of God manifest in man."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=69}}{{refn|group=note|Thought-forms created by men who have "mind and emotion well under control and definitely trained in meditation, are clear, symmetrical objects."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=58}} Light blue color, of a "peculiarly clear and luminous shade, represents spirituality."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=66}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Breen, this thought-form looks like a kind of [[logo]]s in advertising: it can be easily taken as an old oil company sign, "competing with [[Esso]], [[British Petroleum]]and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]."{{sfn|Breen|2014|pp=112â113}} Nevertheless, according to Bailey, our solar system is the manifested "thought-form" of its Logos.{{sfn|Bailey|1925|p=556}}}}{{refn|group=note|The diversity of guises of thought-forms is almost endless.

Plate M showing the form created by music of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] "depicts yellow, red, blue and green lines rising out of a church." This, as the authors explain, "signifies the movement of one of the parts of the melody, the four moving approximately together denoting the treble, alto, tenor and bass respectively." Moreover, "the scalloped edging surrounding the whole is the result of various flourishes and [[arpeggio]]s, and the floating crescents in the centre represent isolated or [[staccato]] chords."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=77|Breen|2014|2p=110}}{{refn|group=note|Lachman named the musical forms of Besant and Leadbeater "the synaesthetic forms created by music."{{sfn|Lachman|2008}} In the first part of her article ''[[Occult or Exact Science?]]'' Blavatsky described in detail the multiple phenomena of color-sound vision.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1956|pp=57â58}}}}

According to professor [[Robert Ellwood|Ellwood]], the book by Besant and Leadbeater had a large influence on [[modern art]]. "It suggested, to a world moving rapidly beyond the literalism of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] art, the expression in painting of [[Surrealism|surreal]] forms and forces underlying, but different from, the visible world."{{sfn|Ellwood}} ''Thought-Forms'' demonstrated how the symbolism of "astral colors and forms" can express the specificity of "certain soul's and mental states." It had a great influence on [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]{{sfn|Kramer|1995}}{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}{{refn|group=note|The ideas which Kandinsky "elaborated in numerous notes and articles, including the now iconic text ''On the Spiritual in Art,'' were a combination of Besant and Leadbeater's theories on thought-forms, [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner's]] considerations of colour, music, and vibration, [and] theories about synaesthesia."{{sfn|Johnston|2012|p=159}} Kandinsky "owned a German translation" (1908 edition) of the book ''Thought-Forms.''{{sfn|Gettings|1978|p=135}}}} as one of the essential factors that led to the "genius opening of new perspectives for painting."{{sfn|ÐÑÑÐºÐ¾Ð²|2007|p=83}}{{refn|group=note|According to Lachman, one Kandinsky's painting in which the "influence of ''Thought-Forms'' is quite visible" is [http://www.wassilykandinsky.ru/work-186.php ''Woman in Moscow'' (1912).]{{sfn|Lachman|2008}} Also one of Kandinsky's paintings "is similar" to the musical form from the book of Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Alvarenga|2011}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Jones, two Leadbeater's books are "relevant to [[FrantiÅ¡ek Kupka|Kupka's]] search for the immaterial: ''Clairvoyance'' (1899) and ''Thought-Forms'' (1901), co-written with Besant."{{sfn|Jones|2012|p=51}}}}

According to reminiscences by [[Leonid Sabaneyev|Sabaneyev]], besides ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] interested a magazine ''Vestnik Theosofii,'' which published [from 1908] the translations of Besant and Leadbeater's works.{{sfn|Ð¡Ð°Ð±Ð°Ð½ÐµÐµÐ²|2000|p=63}}{{sfn|ÐÑÑÐ¸Ð² ÐÐ¢}} Apparently, being impressed by theirs theosophical works, he once said that "strong, powerful thought creates a thought-form so intense that it, in addition to the will, flows into the consciousness of other people."{{sfn|Ð¡Ð°Ð±Ð°Ð½ÐµÐµÐ²|2000|p=307}}{{refn|group=note|According to an Ukrainian philosopher Julia Shabanova, a book ''Thought-Forms'' was being "discussed" by Alexander Scriabin and [[Jean Delville]], a Belgian [[symbolist]] painter.{{sfn|Ð¨Ð°Ð±Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð°}}}} The perform of the [[Part (music)|part]] of light in [[Prometheus: The Poem of Fire|''Prometheus'']] he imagined in the form of a radiance of some "luminous matter," which was supposed to fill the hall.{{sfn|Ð¡Ð°Ð±Ð°Ð½ÐµÐµÐ²|2000|p=70}}{{refn|group=note|"Scriabin introduced many Theosophical ideas into his compositions and also experimented with 'synesthesia,' the strange experience of 'hearing colors' and 'seeing music'."{{sfn|Lachman|2002}}}}{{refn|group=note|See also: [[Clavier Ã  lumiÃ¨res]]}}

A historian Breen wrote that Besant and Leadbeater were well aware how annoying stuff may be their book for a "society that remained deeply conservative." In early January 1901, when this book was published, "[[Queen Victoria]] still ruled England. '[[Modernism]]' as a movement or even a concept did not exist. When we consider this world of 1901, â further wrote Breen, â it becomes difficult not to believe that Besant, Leadbeater and their milieu deserve a more prominent place in the annals of both abstract art and the history of modernism." As the art critic [[Hilton Kramer|Kramer]] has pointed, "what is particularly striking about the outlook of the artists primarily responsible for creating [[Abstract art|abstraction]] is their espousal of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|occult doctrine]]."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=113}} [[W. B. Yeats|Yeats]], [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]], Kandinsky, and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] were charmed by Theosophy.{{refn|group=note|[[Max Beckmann|Beckmann]] who was "impressed" by the book ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' he read in 1934 made several different sketches "on the theme" of its second volume ''Anthropogenesis.'' The album with these sketches is in the Washington [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery]].{{sfn|ÐÑÑÐºÐ¾Ð²|2009|p=171}}}} In the first decades of the twentieth century, it was a widespread "component of Western cultural life."{{sfn|Breen|2014|pp=113â114}}{{refn|group=note|"[[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] famously quoted [[Vedas|Vedic scripture]]... when he witnessed the first atomic bomb blast. But in the context of figures like Besant and Ledbetter, Oppenheimer's fascination with Eastern [[mysticism]] seems less like a personal quirk and more like a thread in a larger tapestry: an interweaving of mysticism, technology, and art that began at the turn of the last century and is still with us in the twenty-first."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=114}}}}

Thus, Besant and Ledbetter had played, summed up Breen, "a small but intriguing role in shaping the globalized culture... which weaves together [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]], mysticism and rationalism, sound and sight."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=114}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Albert Goldman|Goldman]], [[Elvis Presley|Presley]] interested the books by Blavatsky "and those of her disciples" Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Goldman|1981|p=366}} Leadbeater's ''Inner Life'' has belonged to his favourite books, and he often read from it "aloud before going on stage to perform."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=10}}}}{{See also|Synesthesia#Art}}

An academic science names the activities of such "investigators," as the authors of this book, "[[pseudoscience]]", because it based on a concept of the [[extrasensory perception]].{{sfn|Carroll|2003}} The belief in existence of thought-forms "remains influential today" for the Theosophists, followers of [[New Thought]], [[New Age]] and in [[Neopaganism|neopagan movements]], including [[Wicca]].{{sfn|Keller|2006|pp=755â756}}{{sfn|Wessinger|2013|p=44}}

'''Timeline of women's legal rights in the United States (other than voting)''' represents '''formal''' legal changes and reforms regarding women's rights in the United States. That includes actual law reforms as well as other formal changes, such as reforms through new interpretations of laws by [[precedent]]s. The right to vote is exempted from the timeline: for that right, see ''[[Timeline of women's suffrage in the United States]]''. The timeline also excludes ideological changes and events within feminism and antifeminism: for that, see ''[[Timeline of feminism in the United States]]''. 
&lt;!--Please also add entries to the Timeline of women's legal rights (other than voting) article--&gt;

* The ''[[Comstock Law]]'' was a federal act passed by the [[United States Congress]] on March 3, 1873, as the Act for the "Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use". The Act criminalized usage of the [[U.S. Postal Service]] to send any of the following items:&lt;ref name="Horowitz"&gt;Horowitz, Helen Lefkowitz. Rereading Sex. New York: Random House, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[erotica]],
* [[contraceptive]]s,
* [[abortifacient]]s,
* [[sex toy]]s,
* Personal letters alluding to any sexual content or information 
* or any information regarding the above items.

In places like [[Washington D.C.]], where the federal government had direct jurisdiction, the act also made it a misdemeanor, punishable by fine and imprisonment, to sell, give away, or have in possession any "obscene" publication.&lt;ref name="Horowitz" /&gt; Half of the states passed similar anti-obscenity statutes that also banned possession and sale of obscene materials, including contraceptives.&lt;ref name="Beisel"&gt;Beisel, Nicola. Imperiled Innocents. New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was named after its chief proponent, [[Anthony Comstock]]. Due to his own personal enforcement of the law during its early days, Comstock received a commission from the postmaster general to serve as a special agent for the U.S. Postal Services.&lt;ref name="Horowitz" /&gt;

The case is also notable for being an early [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] challenge to [[Sexism|sex discrimination]] in the United States. In this case the United States Supreme Court held that Illinois constitutionally denied law licenses to women, because the right to practice law was not one of the privileges and immunities guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed.

* ''[[Minor v. Happersett]],'' 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 162 (1875), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court [[holding (law)|held]] that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] did not grant anyone, and in this case specifically a female citizen of the state of Missouri, a right to vote even when a state law granted rights to vote to a certain class of citizens.  The Supreme Court upheld state court decisions in [[Missouri]], which had refused to register a woman as a lawful voter because that state's laws allowed only men to vote. The ''Minor v. Happersett'' ruling was based on an interpretation of the [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The Supreme Court readily accepted that Minor was a citizen of the United States, but it held that the constitutionally protected privileges of citizenship did not include the right to vote. The [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]], which became a part of the Constitution in 1920, effectively overruled ''Minor v. Happersett'' by prohibiting discrimination in voting rights based on sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ray |first=Angela G. |authorlink= |author2=Richards, Cindy Koenig |year=2007 |title=Inventing Citizens, Imagining Gender Justice: The Suffrage Rhetoric of Virginia and Francis Minor |journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=375&amp;ndash;402 |doi=10.1080/00335630701449340 |url=http://peerreviewed.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Inventing-Citizens-QJS-Publication.pdf |accessdate=February 27, 2012 |quote= }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p. 376.

Also, one may enter into any kinds of contracts in their new adopted name. Contracts include employment (see ''[[Coppage v.

However, she had been denied voter registration by the respondent in his capacity as a Commissioner of the San Francisco Board of Election on the grounds of her marriage to a Scottish man.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; MacKenzie contended that the Expatriation Act of 1907 "if intended to apply to her, is beyond the authority of Congress", as neither the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] nor any other part of the Constitution gave Congress the power to "denationalize a citizen without his concurrence". However, Justice [[Joseph McKenna]], writing the majority opinion, stated that while "[i]t may be conceded that a change of citizenship cannot be arbitrarily imposed, that is, imposed without the concurrence of the citizen", but "[t]he law in controversy does not have that feature. It deals with a condition voluntarily entered into, with notice of the consequences." Justice [[James Clark McReynolds]], in a concurring opinion, stated that the case should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|url=https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/239/239.US.299.79.html|litigants=MacKenzie v.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the Cable Act only partially reversed previous policies and allowed women to retain their United States citizenship after marrying a foreigner who was not Asian. Thus, even after the Cable Act become effective, any woman who married an Asian alien lost her United States citizenship, just as under the previous law. The Cable Act also had other limitations: a woman could keep her United States citizenship after marrying a non-Asian alien if she stayed within the United States. However, if she married a foreigner and lived on foreign soil for two years, she could still lose her right to United States nationality.

* ''[[Goesaert v. Cleary]]'', [[court citation|335 U.S. 464]] (1948), was a [[United States]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case in which the Court upheld a [[Michigan]] law which prohibited women from being licensed as a bartender in all cities having a population of 50,000 or more, unless their father or husband owned the establishment. Valentine Goesaert, the plaintiff in this case, challenged the law on the ground that it infringed on the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Speaking for the majority, Justice Felix Frankfurter affirmed the judgment of the Detroit, Michigan district court and upheld the constitutionality of the state law. The state argued that since the profession of bartending could potentially lead to moral and social problems for women, it was within the state's power to bar them from working as bartenders. Only when the owner of the bar was a sufficiently close relative to the women bartender could it be guaranteed that such immorality would not be present.

* prevents the maximum utilization of the available [[Labor force|labor resources]];
* tends to cause labor disputes, thereby burdening, affecting, and obstructing [[commerce]];
* burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; and
* constitutes an unfair method of competition.

The law provides (in part) that:

:No [[employer]] having employees subject to any provisions of this section [section 206 of title 29 of the United States Code] shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs[,] the performance of which requires equal [[skill]], effort, and [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a [[seniority|seniority system]]; (ii) a [[merit system]]; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex [ . . . . ]&lt;ref name=EEOC/&gt; For the first nine years of the EPA, the requirement of equal pay for equal work did not extend to persons employed in an executive, administrative or professional capacity, or as an outside salesperson. Therefore, the EPA exempted white-collar women from the protection of equal pay for equal work. In 1972, Congress enacted the [[Education Amendments of 1972]], which amended the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] to expand the coverage of the EPA to these employees, by excluding the EPA from the professional workers exemption of the FLSA.

* [[Title VII]] of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, codified as Subchapter VI of Chapter 21 of [[title 42 of the United States Code]], prohibits discrimination by covered employers on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin (see {{usc|42|2000e-2}}&lt;ref name = "Finduslaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 â CRA â Title VII â Equal Employment Opportunities â 42 US Code Chapter 21 |publisher=finduslaw |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Title VII applies to and covers an employer "who has fifteen (15) or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year" as written in the Definitions section under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e 42 U.S.C. Â§2000e(b)]. Title VII also prohibits discrimination against an individual because of his or her association with another individual of a particular race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, such as by an interracial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parr v. Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Company]]'', 791 F.2d 888 (11th Cir. 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; The EEO Title VII has also been supplemented with legislation prohibiting pregnancy, age, and disability discrimination (''See'' [[Pregnancy Discrimination#Pregnancy Discrimination Act|Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978]], [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/age_discrimination_in_employment_act_of_1967_adea_29_u_s_code_chapter_14 |title=Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 |publisher=Finduslaw.com |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]).

In very narrowly defined situations, an employer is permitted to discriminate on the basis of a protected trait where the trait is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise. To prove the [[bona fide occupational qualifications]] defense, an employer must prove three elements: a direct relationship between the protected trait and the ability to perform the duties of the job, the BFOQ relates to the "essence" or "central mission of the employer's business", and there is no less-restrictive or reasonable alternative (''[[United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|499|187|1991}} 111 S.Ct. 1196). The Bona Fide Occupational Qualification exception is an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination based on protected traits (''[[Dothard v. Rawlinson]]'', {{ussc|433|321|1977}} 97 S.Ct. 2720). An employer or customer's preference for an individual of a particular religion is not sufficient to establish a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (''[[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kamehameha School â Bishop Estate]]'', 990 F.2d 458 (9th Cir. 1993)). There are partial and whole exceptions to Title VII for four types of employers:
* Federal government; (Comment: The proscriptions against employment discrimination under Title VII are now applicable to certain federal government offices under [http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21#17 42 U.S.C.

The case involved a [[Connecticut]] "[[Comstock law]]" that prohibited any person from using "any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception."  By a vote of 7â2, the Supreme Court invalidated the law on the grounds that it violated the "right to marital privacy", establishing the basis for the right to privacy with respect to intimate practices. This and other cases view the right to privacy as a right to "protect[ion] from governmental intrusion."

Although the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] does not explicitly mention "privacy", Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote for the majority that the right was to be found in the "[[penumbra (law)|penumbras]]" and "emanations" of other constitutional protections, such as the [[self-incrimination clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. Justice [[Arthur Goldberg]] wrote a concurring opinion in which he used the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] in support of the Supreme Court's ruling. Justice [[Arthur Goldberg]] and Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II]] wrote concurring opinions in which they argued that privacy is protected by the [[due process clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Justice [[Byron White]] also wrote a concurrence based on the due process clause.

Â§Â§ 1681â1688, co-authored and introduced by Senator [[Birch Bayh]]; it was renamed the [[Patsy Mink]] Equal Opportunity in Education Act in 2002, after its late House co-author and sponsor. It states (in part) that:

* For the first nine years of the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], the requirement of equal pay for equal work did not extend to persons employed in an executive, administrative or professional capacity, or as an outside salesperson. Therefore, the EPA exempted white-collar women from the protection of equal pay for equal work. The [[Education Amendments of 1972]] amended the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] to expand the coverage of the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]] to these employees, by excluding the EPA from the professional workers exemption of the FLSA.
* ''[[Eisenstadt v.

* The common law offence of being a [[common scold]] was extant in New Jersey until struck down in 1972 by Circuit Judge McCann who found it had been subsumed in the provisions of the Disorderly Conduct Act of 1898, was bad for vagueness and offended the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution for sex discrimination.
* Under Â§ 215 of the [[Social Security Act]] (42 USCS 415), old-age insurance benefits are computed on the basis of the wage earner's "average monthly wage" earned during their "benefit computation years," which are the "elapsed years" (reduced by five) during which their covered wages were highest. Under the pre-1972 version, the computation for old age insurance benefits was such that a woman obtained larger benefits than a man of the same age having the same earnings record. The 1972 amendment altered the formula for computing benefits so as to eliminate the previous distinction between men and women, but only as to men reaching the age of 62 in 1975 or later; it was not given retroactive application.

Wade]]'', {{ussc|410|113|1973}}, was a [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark decision]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] on the issue of [[abortion]]. The Court ruled 7â2 that a right to [[Privacy#Privacy law|privacy]] under the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] extended to a woman's decision to have an abortion, but that this right must be balanced against the state's two legitimate interests in regulating abortions: protecting women's health and protecting the potentiality of human life.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 162 ("We repeat, however, that the State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman, whether she be a resident of the State or a non-resident who seeks medical consultation and treatment there, and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.").&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that these state interests became stronger over the course of a pregnancy, the Court resolved this [[balancing test]] by tying state regulation of abortion to the third [[Trimester (pregnancy)#Physiology|trimester of pregnancy]].
* ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', 410 U.S. 179 (1973), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court overturning the abortion law of Georgia. The Supreme Court's decision was released on January 22, 1973, the same day as the decision in the better-known case of Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). Doe v. Bolton challenged Georgia's much more liberal abortion statute.
* ''[[Frontiero v. Richardson]]'', {{ussc|411|677|1973}}, was a [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark]] [[United States Supreme Court]] case&lt;ref&gt;Technically, the case was decided under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s [[Due Process Clause]], not under the Equal Protection Clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], since the latter applies not to the federal government but to the states. However, because ''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'', through the doctrine of reverse [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporation]], made the standards of the Equal Protection Clause applicable to the federal government, it was for practical purposes an addition not to due process, but rather to equal protection jurisprudence.&lt;/ref&gt; which decided that benefits given by the [[United States armed forces|United States military]] to the family of service members cannot be given out differently because of sex.
* ''[[Pittsburgh Press Co. v.

* ''[[Geduldig v. Aiello]]'', {{ussc|417|484|1974}}, was an [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] case in the [[United States]] in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled on whether unfavorable treatment to pregnant women could count as sex discrimination. It held that the denial of [[insurance]] benefits for work loss resulting from a normal [[pregnancy]] did not violate the [[Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].  The [[California]] insurance program at issue did not exclude workers from eligibility based on [[sex]] but did exclude pregnancy from a list of compensable [[disabilities]].  The majority found that even though only women would be directly affected by the administrative decision, the classification of normal pregnancy as non-compensable was not a sex-based classification, and therefore the court would defer to the state so long as it could provide a [[Rational basis review|rational basis]] for its categorization.
* The ''[[Equal Credit Opportunity Act]]'' (ECOA) is a [[United States]] law (codified at {{usc|15|1691}} et seq.), enacted in 1974, that makes it unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Intro to Business|last1= Dlabay|first1= Les R. |last2=Burrow |first2=James L. |last3=Brad |first3= Brad |year= 2009|publisher= South-Western [[Cengage Learning]]|location= [[Mason, Ohio]]|isbn=978-0-538-44561-0 |page= 470|quote= The ''Equal Credit Opportunity Act'' prohibits creditors from denying a person credit because of age, race, sex, or marital status.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the fact that all or part of the applicant's income derives from a public assistance program; or to the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the [[Consumer Credit Protection Act]].

Failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act's Regulation B can subject a financial institution to civil liability for actual and punitive damages in individual or class actions.

The Court also acknowledged that parties economically affected by regulations may challenge them "by acting as advocates of the rights of third parties who seek access to their market or function." The case specifically concerned the fact that Oklahoma passed a statute prohibiting the sale of "nonintoxicating" 3.2% beer to males under the age of 21 but allowed females over the age of 18 to purchase it. The Court held that the gender classifications made by the Oklahoma statute were unconstitutional because the statistics relied on by the state were insufficient to show a substantial relationship between the statute and the benefits intended to stem from it.

However, on the issue of whether women could fill close contact jobs in all male maximum security prisons the Court ruled 6â3 that the BFOQ defense was legitimate in this case.

* ''[[Bellotti v. Baird (1979)]]'', 443 U.S. 622 (1979) was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case that ruled that teenagers do not have to secure parental consent to obtain an [[abortion]]. The Court, 8-1, elaborates on its parental consent decision of 1976. It implies that states may be able to require a pregnant, unmarried minor to obtain parental consent to an abortion so long as the state law provides an alternative procedure to parental approval, such as letting the minor seek a state judge's approval instead.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(a) Every person who performs or induces an abortion shall prior thereto have made a determination based on his experience, judgment or professional competence that the fetus is not viable, and if the determination is that the fetus is viable or if there is sufficient reason to believe that the fetus may be viable, shall exercise that degree of professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus which such person would be required to exercise in order to preserve the life and health of any fetus intended to be born and not aborted and the abortion technique employed shall be that which would provide the best opportunity for the fetus to be aborted alive so long as a different technique would not be necessary in order to preserve the life or health of the mother.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Doctors who failed to adhere to the provisions of this section were liable to civil and criminal prosecution "as would pertain to him had the fetus been a child who was intended to be born and not aborted." Franklin and others sued, arguing that the provision was both vague and overbroad. In a 6â3 decision written by ''[[Roe v. Wade|Roe]]'' author [[Harry Blackmun]], the Supreme Court agreed, finding that requiring a determination "if... the fetus is viable or if there is sufficient reason to believe the fetus may be viable" was insufficient and impermissibly vague guidance for physicians who might face criminal liability if a jury disagrees with their judgment.

Grove City College was not a federally funded institution; however, they did accept students who were receiving [[Basic Educational Opportunity Grant]]s through a Department of Education program.&lt;ref name="oyez"/&gt; The Department of Education's stance was that, because some of its students were receiving federal grants, the school was receiving federal assistance and Title&amp;nbsp;IX applied to it. The Court decided that since Grove City College was only receiving federal funding through the grant program, only that program had to be in compliance. The ruling was a major victory for those opposed to Title&amp;nbsp;IX, as it made many institutions' sports programs outside of the rule of Title&amp;nbsp;IX and, thus, reduced the scope of Title&amp;nbsp;IX.&lt;ref name="Suggs"&gt;Suggs, Welsh.

* ''[[Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins]]'', {{Ussc|490|228|1989|el=no}}, was an important decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] on the issue of employer liability for [[sex discrimination]]. The Court held that the employer, the accounting firm [[Price Waterhouse]], must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision regarding employment would have been the same if sex discrimination had not occurred. The accounting firm failed to prove that the same decision to postpone [[Ann Hopkins]]'s promotion to partnership would have still been made in the absence of sex discrimination, and therefore, the employment decision constituted sex discrimination under [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The significance of the Supreme Court's ruling was twofold. First, it established that [[Sexism#Gender stereotypes|gender stereotyping]] is actionable as sex discrimination. Second, it established the [[Mixed motive discrimination|mixed-motive framework]] as an evidentiary framework for proving discrimination under a disparate treatment theory even when lawful reasons for the adverse employment action are also present.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Leslie.

* ''[[Jespersen v. Harrah's Operating Co.]]'', No. 03-15045 (9th Cir. Apr. 14, 2006, en banc) was a United States federal [[employment law]] [[sex discrimination]] case.

Darlene Jespersen was a 20-year employee at [[Harrah's Casino]] in [[Reno, Nevada]].  In 2000, Harrah's advanced a "Personal Best" policy, which created strict standards for employee appearance and grooming, which included a requirement that women wear substantial amounts of [[makeup]].

In 2001, Jespersen filed a lawsuit in [[United States District Court for the District of Nevada]], which found against her claim. The district court opined that the policy imposed "equal burdens" on both sexes and that the policy did not discriminate based on [[Suspect classification#Federal classifications|immutable]] characteristics of her sex.  The [[9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed the decision, but on rehearing [[en banc]], reversed part of its decision.  The full panel concluded, in contrast to the previous rulings, that such grooming requirements could be challenged as sex [[stereotyping]] in some cases, even in view of the decision in ''[[Price Waterhouse v.

* ''[[Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England]]'', [[Case citation|546 U.S. 320]] (2006), was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] involving a [[facial challenge]] to [[New Hampshire]]'s parental notification [[abortion]] law.  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First Circuit]] had ruled that the law was unconstitutional and an injunction against its enforcement was proper.  The Supreme Court vacated this judgment and remanded the case, but avoided a substantive ruling on the challenged law or a reconsideration of prior Supreme Court abortion precedent.  Instead, the Court only addressed the issue of remedy, holding that invalidating a statute in its entirety "is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief."

* ''United States v.

In a 9â0 decision, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held that Castleman's conviction of "misdemeanor domestic assault" did qualify as a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" under [[Tennessee]] state law.

* ''[[Zubik v.

* ''[[National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v.

The law required that licensed centers post visible notices that other options for pregnancy, including abortion, are available from state-sponsored clinics. It also mandated that unlicensed centers post notice of their unlicensed status. The centers, typically run by Christian non-profit groups, challenged the act on the basis that it violated their free speech. After prior reviews in lower courts, the case was brought to the Supreme Court, asking "Whether the disclosures required by the California Reproductive FACT Act violate the protections set forth in the free speech clause of the First Amendment, applicable to the states through the 14th Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/national-institute-family-life-advocates-v-becerra/ National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v.

'''Well Loved Tales''' was a series of illustrated re-tellings of [[fairy tales]] and other [[traditional stories]] published by [[Ladybird Books|Ladybird]] between 1964 and the early 1990s. The books were labelled as "easy reading" and were graded depending on such aspects as their length, complexity and vocabulary. Most of the stories in the series were based on stories by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Charles Perrault]], alongside a number of traditional English folk tales such as ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' and ''[[The Three Little Pigs]]''. The first title in the series was ''[[Cinderella]]'', and over the next decade, twenty seven titles were published, all written by Vera Southgate. In 1979, with the publication of ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio|Pinocchio]]'' and ''[[Tom Thumb]].''
in the series, the look and format of the books changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweeweb.co.uk/ladybird/ladybird_series_606d.html|publisher=The Wee Web|title=Ladybird series 606d - Well Loved Tales|accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books now universally featured a green spine and back cover, as well as a standard logo. The series also broke with the Ladybird tradition of having a left page of just text and a right page of just picture, and the illustrations became more stylised than the previous editions. Older titles were gradually re-illustrated over the years. Under this new look, even more titles retold by a variety of different editors and authors came to be added over the course of the 1980s, with popular stories including ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Later Well Loved Tales - different titles|url=http://ladybirdseries.webnode.com/later-well-loved-tales-different-titles/|publisher=www.ladybirdflyawayhome.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series gradually went out of print in the early 1990s, yet the current "Ladybird Tales" series has reused some of the original Well Loved Tales texts.

== Reception ==
Titles in the series were translated into many different languages including [[Arabic]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]]. Eventually sales in the series sold upwards of 80 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweeweb.co.uk/ladybird/ladybird_series_606d.html|publisher=The Wee Web|title=Ladybird series 606d - Well Loved Tales|accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older books have been known to fetch quite high prices on the secondhand market; for example, first editions of "[[Cinderella]]" with a dust jacket have been known to go for as much as Â£150.

Perhaps due to the nostalgia for some of the earlier titles in the series, later editions with more stylised illustrations are often held by some with lesser regard. Equally, the original editions of the 1960s and 1970s have been criticised for their illustrations for being lifeless and not leaving much to the imagination. Equally, some have raised concerns over the drastic abridging of longer stories such as ''Pinocchio'' and the right to retelling distinctly literary fairy tales with a clear author such as Hans Christian Andersen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Lorraine|last2=Alderson|first2=Brian|title=The Ladybird Story: Children's Books for Everyone|date=2014|publisher=British Library|location=London|isbn=0712357289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''White-Washing Race: The Myth of a Color-Blind Society''''' is a book arguing that racial discrimination is still evident on contemporary American society.  The book draws on the fields of [[sociology]], [[political science]], economics, criminology, and legal studies.  The authors argue that the inequalities which prevail in America today, especially with regard to wages, income, and access to housing and [[health care]], are the effects of either cultural or individual failures.

The book provides an alternative explanation: that racismâparticularly institutionalized racismâis as much a problem in America as in earlier times. Such inequalities continue to exist in the [[Labour economics|labor market]], the [[welfare state]], the [[Criminal justice|criminal justice system]], and schools and universities.  The book recounts the history of advancement among [[African American|black Americans]] since the 1960s, and   current [[Discrimination|anti-discrimination]] policies, but advocates new policies for increased [[Desegregation|racial equality]] in a post-affirmative action world.

'''Yidam''' {{bo|à½¡à½²à¼à½à½}} is a type of deity associated with tantric or [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]] said to be manifestations of [[Buddhahood]] or enlightened mind. During personal meditation (''sÄdhana'') practice, the yogi identifies their own form, attributes and mind with those of a yidam for the purpose of transformation.&lt;ref name="PrincetonDic"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Buswell |first1=Robert E. |authorlink1=Robert Buswell Jr.|last2=Lopez |first2=Donald S. |authorlink2=Donald S. Lopez, Jr. |date=2013|title=The Princeton dictionary of Buddhism|page= |location=Princeton and Oxford|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-15786-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yidam is sometimes translated by the terms "meditational deity" or "tutelary deity". Examples of yidams include the meditation deities Chakrasamvara, Kalachakra, Hevajra, Yamantaka, and Vajrayogini, all of whom have a distinctive iconography, mandala, mantra, rites of invocation and practice.

In Vajrayana, the yidam is one of the [[Three Roots|three roots]] of the "inner" refuge formula and is also the key element of [[Vajrayana#Deity yoga|Deity yoga]] since the 'deity' in the yoga is the yidam.

==Etymology==
Yidam is said to be a contraction of Tib. ''yid-kyi-dam-tshig'',&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Sarah. "The Dharma Dictionary." Buddhadharma Magazine, Spring 2005. [http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2005/spring/dharma_dictionary.html Dharma Dictionary: Yidam].&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "[[samaya]] of mind"- in other words, the state of being indestructibly bonded with the inherently pure and liberated nature of mind.

The [[Sanskrit]] word '''{{IAST|iá¹£á¹­adevatÄ}}''' or '''{{IAST|iá¹£á¹­adevaá¸¥}}''' a compound of ''iá¹£á¹­a'' (desired, liked, reverenced) + ''devatÄ'' (a [[deity]] or divine being) is a term associated with yidam in many popular books on Buddhist Tantra but has not been attested in any Buddhist tantric text in Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;where the Hindus take the Istadeva for an actual deity who has been invited to dwell in the devotee's heart, the Yidams of Tantric Buddhism are in fact the emanations of the adepts own mind. "''The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet: A Practical Guide to the Theory, Purpose, and Techniques of Tantric Meditation'' by John Blofeld. Penguin:1992.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Three Roots==
The yidam appears as one of the [[Three Roots]] in the [[Tibetan Buddhist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmer-Brown|first=Judith|title=Dakini's Warm Breath:The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism|publisher=Shambhala Publications Inc.|year=2002|isbn=978-1-57062-920-4|pages=327 n.51}} Simmer-Brown cites evidence that Three Roots is a Tibetan Buddhist formulation from the time of Padmasambhava.&lt;/ref&gt; 'Inner' refuge formulation. The [[iconography]] of the yidam may be 'peaceful', 'wrathful' (Tibetan ''tro wa'') or 'neither peaceful or wrathful' (Tibetan:'' shi ma tro''), depending on the practitioner's own nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmo|first=Tenzin|title=Reflections on a Mountain Lake:Teachings on Practical Buddhism|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=2002|pages=229â231|isbn=1-55939-175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The yidam represents awakening and so its appearance reflects whatever is required by the practitioner in order to awaken. The guru will guide the student as to which yidam is appropriate for them and then [[Wang (Tibetan Buddhism)|initiation]] into the [[mandala]] of the Ishta-deva is given by the [[guru]], so that [[Deity Yoga]] practices can be undertaken. In essence, the [[mindstream]] of the guru and the yidam are indivisible. The yidam is considered to be the root of success in the practice.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==In East Asian Buddhism==
The Vajrayana traditions of China, Korea and Japan, while smaller and less prominent than Indo-Tibetan tantric Buddhism, are characterized in part by the utilization of yidams in meditation, though they use their own terms. One prominent ishta-devata in East Asian vajrayana is '''[[Marici (Buddhism)|Marici]]''' (Ch: ''Molichitian'', Jp: ''Marishi-ten''). In the [[Shingon]] tradition of Japan, prominent yidam include the "five mysteries of Vajrasattva," which are '''[[Vajrasattva]]''' (Jp. ''Kongosatta''), '''Surata/Ishta-vajrinÄ«''' (Jp. ''Yoku-kongonyo''"æ¾éåå¥³"), '''KelikilÄ-vajrinÄ«''' (Jp. ''Shoku-kongonyo''"è§¦éåå¥³"), '''KÄmÄ/RÄga-vajrinÄ«''' ((Jp. ''Ai-kongonyo''"æéåå¥³"), and '''KÄmesvarÄ/Mana-vajrinÄ«''' ((Jp. ''Man-kongonyo''"æ¢éåå¥³").&lt;ref&gt;''Tantric Buddhism in East Asia'' by Richard Payne, Wisdom Publications: 2005. {{ISBN|0-86171-487-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yidam in Nepalese Newar Buddhism==
The principal yidam in the [[Newar]] Vajrayana tradition of Nepal are [[Chakrasamvara]] and [[Vajravarahi]].&lt;ref name="Dina Bangdel 2003. p. 32"&gt;Dina Bangdel, "Tantra in Nepal," ''The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art'' Serindia Publications: 2003. {{ISBN|1-932476-01-6}}, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In that tradition, three components are essential to a temple complex: a main shrine symbolizing [[Svayambhu Mahachaitya]]; an exoteric shrine featuring [[Buddha Shakyamuni]] and other buddhas and bodhisattvas; and an esoteric shrine dedicated to the yidam, to which only initiates may be admitted.&lt;ref name="Dina Bangdel 2003. p. 32"/&gt;

==Working definition==
According to ''The Tonglen and Mind Training Site'' which discusses [[Tonglen]] and [[NgÃ¶ndro]], Yidam is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Visualized representative of your enlightened energy, or Buddha-nature. Tricky concept for Westerners; closest concept might be that of a patron saint in Catholicism, except that a yidam is not a historical figure and is not necessarily supposed to 'exist' in the same way human beings do. Other related concepts might be a totem or power animal in the Native American tradition, or even the fairy godmother in children's tales.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://lojongmindtraining.com/glossary.aspx Lojong Mind Training: Yidam] (accessed: December 6, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Exegesis==
During the (meditation) practice of the [[generation stage]], a practitioner ([[sadhaka]]) establishes a strong familiarity with the Ishta-deva (an enlightened being) by means of visualization and a high level of concentration. During the practice of the [[completion stage]], a practitioner focusses on methods to actualize the transformation of one's own mindstream and body into the meditation Deity by meditation and yogic techniques of energy-control such as [[Kundalini yoga|kundalini]] ([[tummo]] in Tibetan). Through these complementary disciplines of generation and completion one increasingly perceives the pervasive [[Buddha nature]].

Judith Simmer-Brown summarises: &lt;blockquote&gt;
... a yidam, a personal meditational deity, a potent ritual symbol simultaneously representing the mind of the guru and lineage of enlightened teachers, and the enlightened mind of the tantric practitioner. Recognizing the inseparability of these two is the ground of tantric practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmer-Brown|first=Judith|title=Dakini's Warm Breath:The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism|publisher=Shambhala|year=2001|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Berzin]] (1997: unpaginated) in discussing Buddhist [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] commitment and [[bodhisattva vows]] frames a caution to [[sadhana]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
More specifically, this commitment means not taking ultimate refuge in gods or spirits. Buddhism, particularly in its Tibetan form, often contains ritual ceremonies, or pujas, directed toward various Buddha-figures or fierce protectors in order to help dispel obstacles and accomplish constructive purposes. Performing these ceremonies provides conducive circumstances for negative potentials to ripen in trivial rather than major obstacles, and positive potentials to ripen sooner rather than later. If we have built up overwhelmingly negative potentials, however, these ceremonies are ineffective in averting difficulties. Therefore, propitiating gods, spirits, protectors or even Buddhas is never a substitute for attending to our karma&amp;nbsp;â avoiding destructive conduct and acting in a constructive manner. Buddhism is not a spiritual path of protector-worship, or even Buddha-worship. The safe direction of the Buddhist path is working to become a Buddha ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;Berzin, Alexander (1997). ''Taking the Kalachakra Initiation: Part III: Vows and Closely Bonding Practices.'' Source: [http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/e-books/published_books/kalachakra_initiation/pt3/kalachakra_initiation_06.html Taking the Kalachakra Initiation] (accessed: July 14, 2016). NB: Originally published as
Berzin, Alexander. Taking the Kalachakra Initiation. Ithaca, Snow Lion, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the [[Vajrayana]] practices of Tibetan Buddhism, 'safe direction', or '[[refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]]' is undertaken through the [[Three Roots]], the practitioner relying on an Ishta-deva in [[Deity Yoga]] as a means of becoming a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]].

===Common yidams===
Some common yidams include [[Hayagriva]], [[Vajrakilaya]] (Dorje [[Phurba]]), [[Samputa]], [[Guhyasamaja]], [[Yamantaka]], [[Hevajra]], [[Kurukulla]], [[Cakrasamvara]], [[Vajrayogini]], and [[Kalachakra]]. Also, other enlightened beings such as the regular forms of the Buddhas, [[Bodhisattva]]s, [[Padmasambhava]], certain [[Dharmapala]]s, [[Dakini]]s, Wealth Deities, and [[yab-yum]] representations, among others, can also be practiced as a yidam.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[Avalokiteshvara]], [[Tara (Buddhist)|Tara]], [[Manjusri]], [[Hevajra]] and consort [[Nairatmya]], [[Heruka]]-Chakrasamvara and consort [[Vajravarahi]], etc. are frequently chosen as yidams, but any deity of the [[tantric Buddhism|tantric]] pantheon may be adopted as such.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The yidam is used as a means or a goal of transformation towards full enlightenment. According to certain traditions, the Ishtadevas are considered as the emanation of the adept's own [[mind]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
