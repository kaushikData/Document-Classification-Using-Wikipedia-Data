The '''Andean Cat Alliance''' ('''Alianza Gato Andino''' - '''AGA''') is a network of researchers and conservationists working to study and protect the [[andean cat]] (''Leopardus jacobita'') and its [[habitat]] in [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]] and [[Peru]]. It is partnered with the [[Wildlife Conservation Network]],&lt;ref name=wcn&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wildnet.org/wildlife-programs/andean-cat|title=Andean Cat Alliance at Wildlife Conservation Network|publisher=WCN}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has developed a strategic plan for conservation of the species.&lt;ref name=iucn&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Villalba, L. | author2 = Lucherini, M. | author3 = Walker, S. | author4 = Lagos, N. | author5 = Cossios, D. | author6 = Bennett, M. | author7 = Huaranca, J. | last-author-amp = yes | title = ''Leopardus jacobita'' | journal = [[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] | volume = 2016 | page = e.T15452A50657407 | publisher = [[IUCN]] | date = 2016 | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/15452/0 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.2016-1.RLTS.T15452A50657407.en | access-date = 13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fiona Sunquist|author2=Mel Sunquist|title=The Wild Cat Book: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about Cats|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZH6aBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123|year=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-78026-9|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
AGA was founded in 1999, and comprises around 25 professional biologists and other scientists.&lt;ref name=lamula&gt;{{cite news|author1=Mongabay Latam|author2=Miriam Telma Jemio|title=Cuatro países de Latinoamérica se unen para salvar al gato andino|trans-title=Four Latin American countries get together to save the Andean cat|url=https://mongabay-latam.lamula.pe/2016/11/24/cuatro-paises-de-latinoamerica-se-unen-para-salvar-al-gato-andino/mongabaylatam/|work=La Mula (Peru)|date=24 November 2016|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Andean cat==
The Andean cat is regarded as one of the most [[endangered]] [[wild cats]] in the world and perhaps the rarest South American [[felid]]. Very little is known about this species and there have been only 10 documented sightings in the last 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance has managed to be the first to capture and radio-collar an Andean cat, and were also the first to obtain photographs by camera trap.&lt;ref name=wcn_cam&gt;{{cite web
 |url =https://wildnet.org/updates?pid=2
 |title = Andean Cat
 |publisher = WCN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

===Geographic distribution===
The Andean Cat Alliance uses camera trapping, DNA analysis of feces, and surveys of local inhabitants to confirm the andean cats presence. AGA has widened the cat's known range in [[Peru]] and [[Argentina]] and has helped to better understand its population density and genetic variability.&lt;ref name=lamula /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gotcha! Elusive and rare Andean mountain cats snapped in new location|url=https://www.earthtouchnews.com/conservation/endangered/gotcha-elusive-and-rare-andean-mountain-cats-snapped-in-new-location/|work=Earth Touch News Network|date=18 September 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
The Andean Cat Alliance conducts training for park guards and local people to help them become local wildlife monitors so they may better contribute to protecting the andean cat and its habitat. Other activities include holding seminars and community festivals to both develop conservation strategies, and to raise awareness and learn the needs of the communities in each of the four range countries.&lt;ref name=gato&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.gatoandino.org/index.php/en/
 |title = Allianza Gato Andina - AGA (english version)}}&lt;/ref&gt; AGA's publicity initiatives have included getting the Chilean government to associate the animal with the "Day of Native Fauna", marked annually on 5 November.&lt;ref name=lamula /&gt;

===Conservation centers===
The Alliance is building an EcoMuseo (“Ecological Museum”) in the “Centro Poblado Menor de Alto Perú,” a Peruvian village located in proximity to andean cat habitat.&lt;ref name= gato/&gt; Working with the Small Wild Cat Conservation Foundation (SWCCF) it has established a conservation center in the Salar de Surire, Chile, where it aims to dissuade the local people from hunting the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Benedicto Cuervo Álvarez |title=El gato andino|url=http://www.otromundoesposible.net/el-gato-andino/|work=Otro Mundo Es Posible|date=17 July 2016|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasing Protected Areas===
One of the main goals of the Alliance is to work with governments to strengthen management of Andean cat habitat and promote new protected areas and corridors where needed.&lt;ref name=gato/&gt;

'''Andrew Martin Kamarck''' (died 3 March 2010) was an [[United States|American]] [[economist]], Director of the [[Economic Development Institute]] at the [[World Bank]] and [[Regents Professor]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles]].

In 1936, Kamarck got his BA [[summa cum laude]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="capecodder"&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/wickedlocal-brewster/obituary.aspx?n=andrew-m-kamarck&amp;pid=140665723 ''Andrew M. Kamarck''] Obituary. In: ''[[The Cape Codder]]'', March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, he got his [[Ph.D]] at Harvard.&lt;ref name="capecodder"/&gt; He worked for the [[Federal Reserve Board]] and, during [[World War II]], he "was posted to the [[Allied Control Commission]] for Italy, where he supervised the [[Banca d'Italia]]". In 1944, he "was assigned as Chief of the [[U.S. Financial Intelligence]] in [[Germany]]".&lt;ref name="umich"&gt;[http://press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=17159 ''Economics as a Social Science: An Approach to Nonautistic Theory.''] Book description at [[The University of Michigan Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

He then continued to work for the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] in 1946, contributing to the "policy guidelines for the [[Marshall Plan]]." He later became World Bank Economic Adviser, Professor at University of California, Los Angeles (1964–65) "and Research Associate at the [[Harvard Center of International Affairs]].&lt;ref name="umich"/&gt;

[[Image:Borden Base Line Plaque, South Deerfield MA.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Plaque at the Tilton Library in [[South Deerfield, Massachusetts|South Deerfield]]]]

The '''Borden Base Line''' is a historic  survey line (7.42 miles, {{convert|39009.73|ft|m}} long) running north/south through [[Hatfield, Massachusetts|Hatfield]] and [[South Deerfield, Massachusetts]]. It was completed in 1831, and is now on the [[List of historic civil engineering landmarks]].

The base line measurement was the first project of its kind undertaken in America, and essential for Massachusetts' pioneering Trigonometrical Survey, performed under chief engineer Robert Treat Paine. Its careful measurement was critical, since the accuracy of the whole triangulation network depended on it.

The base line was measured with greater accuracy than previously possible by using a new measuring device invented by [[Simeon Borden]], which employed a bi-metallic measuring instrument to provide constant readings despite temperature variations. His apparatus was {{convert|50|ft|m}} long, enclosed in a tube, and employed with four compound microscopes.

Borden was a highly competent engineer whose ability was widely recognized. Indeed, the entire project became generally known as the Borden Survey. He measured the base line with a nominal accuracy of better than one part in 5 million. As Professor A. D. Butterfield has written, "The work performed and results obtained far surpassed in magnitude and attainment of any previous work of this kind in America."

It appears that the north end of the baseline lies just south of the intersection of today's Route 116 and Route 5 in [[South Deerfield, Massachusetts]]. According to the Valley Historians, the south end is still marked by a copper plug set into a boulder, located in the back yard of the house at 30 Bridge Street, [[Hatfield, Massachusetts]].

[[File:Atlas Cosmographicae (Mercator) 035.jpg|thumb|[[Gerardus Mercator]]'s map of Europe (printed in 1596)]]
The earliest [[cartography|cartographic]] depictions of [[Europe]] are found in [[early world maps]]. In [[classical antiquity]], ''Europe'' was assumed to cover the quarter of the globe north of the [[Mediterranean]], an arrangement that was adhered to in medieval [[T and O map]]s.

[[Ptolemy's world map]] of the 2nd century already had a reasonably precise description of southern and western Europe, but was unaware of particulars of northern and eastern Europe.

Medieval maps such as the [[Hereford Mappa Mundi]] still assumed that [[Scandinavia]] was an island. Progress was made in the 16th century, and [[Gerard Mercator]] gave an accurate representation of all of Europe, including Scandinavia shown as a peninsula.

'''Chapeltoun''' is an estate on the banks of the Annick Water in [[East Ayrshire]], Scotland. This is a rural area famous for its milk and [[Dunlop cheese|cheese]] production and the [[Ayrshire cattle|Ayrshire or Dunlop breed of cattle]].

==Templeton and the Knights Templar==
The [[feudal]] allocation of tenements to the vassals of the overlord, such as Hugh de Morville, was carried out very carefully, with the boundaries being walked and carefully recorded.&lt;ref name="Dillon"&gt;Dillon, William J. (1950). The Origins of Feudal Ayrshire. Ayr Arch Nat Hist Soc V.3. P. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'ton' at this time was added to the site of the dwelling house, not necessarily a grand stone-built structure, which was bounded by a wall or fence. The tenements were held in a military tenure, the land being in exchange for military assistance to the overlord. In later years the military assistance could be exchanged for financial payment.

The name Templeton may have arisen due to lands here being given by the overlord to a vassal. The site of the original dwelling is unknown, Laigh Chapelton being the oldest known site of a habitation, probably dating from at least 1775.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;Armstrong and Son. Engraved by S.Pyle (1775). A New Map of Ayr Shire comprehending Kyle, Cunningham and Carrick.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Chapelton is relatively recent as [[Timothy Pont|Pont's Map]] of 1604 does not show such a place name; however, he does show a Templeton in approximately the right place between the Annick Water and the Glazert Water. Other [[Knights Templar]] temple-lands were to be found at the Templehouse and Fortalice in the old village of Darlington near [[Stewarton]], Templehouse near [[Dunlop, East Ayrshire|Dunlop]], at Templetounburn on the outskirts of Crookedholm and at several other places in the area, such as Temple-Ryburn and Temple-Hapland.

In 1312 the Knights Templar order, whose Scottish headquarters had been at [[Torphichen]], was disbanded&lt;ref name="Barber"&gt;Barber, Malcolm (1996). ''The New Knighthood. A History of the Order of the Temple''. Pub. Cambridge. {{ISBN|0-521-55872-7}}. P. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; and its lands given to the [[Knights of St. John]]&lt;ref name="Dobie"&gt;Dobie, James D. (ed Dobie, J.S.) (1876). ''Cunninghame, Topographized by Timothy Pont'' 1604–1608, with continuations and illustrative notices. Pub. John Tweed, Glasgow.&lt;/ref&gt; who today run the [[St John Ambulance]] amongst other activities. Lord Torphichen as preceptor obtained the temple-land tenements and the lands passed through the hands of Montgomerie of Hessilhead to Wallace of Cairnhill (now Carnell) in 1720, before passing out of the hands of the aristocracy. A tenement is a grant of land which has a building on it and is held in tenure by the tenant&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;Robinson, Mairi (2000). The Concise Scots Dictionary. Aberdeen. {{ISBN|1-902930-00-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The farms in the area used the Chapelton name in 1829 (Aitken) and Armstrong's 1775 map shows and names a Chapel. The name change from Templetoun to Chapelton may have resulted from the end of the official existence of the temple-lands sometime after 1720 or as a result of the breaking up of the ownership of these lands at around this date or possibly slightly earlier. Thus the name Templeton was in use in 1604&lt;ref name="Pont"&gt;[[Pont, Timothy]] (1604). ''Cuninghamia''. Pub. J. Blaeu.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1654, but not by 1775&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt; The will of Katherine Muir / Mure, dated 1665, relict of William Hepburn of Chapeltoun in the Parish of Stewarton,&lt;ref name="Commissariot"&gt;Commisariot of Glasgow Wills from the Commissariot of Glasgow 1547.&lt;/ref&gt; implies a change of name at an earlier date. This Chapeltoun may be the modern day Chapeltoun Mains.

Paterson (1866)&lt;ref name="Paterson"&gt;[[James Paterson (journalist)|Paterson, James]] (1863–66). ''History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton''. V. – III – Cunninghame. Edinburgh: J. Stillie.&lt;/ref&gt; states that ''on the lands of Langshaw (now Lainshaw) there was a chapel, dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]] and that it had an appropriate endowment''. After the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] the endowment was appropriated by the patron and the chapel allowed to fall into ruins. Temple-lands did not pay teins to maintain the local church and they were therefore a highly prized and lucrative asset.

In 1616 the patronage of the chapel and the lands of Peacock Bank (sic) were held by Sir Neil Montgomerie of Lainshaw as granted 'clare constat' by the Earl of Eglinton, but by 1661 the patronage was once again held directly by the Earl of Eglinton as indicated below. The site of the chapel was called Chapelton in the 17th century and Chapel by 1874. The same information is given by Paterson&lt;ref name="Paterson"/&gt; in 1866, Groome in 1885 and Barclay.

|'''Etymology'''
|- style="text-align:left; font-size:x-medium;"
|The name ''Chapeltoun'' clearly derives from ''Chapel &amp; Toun'', indicating that a small settlement existed around the chapel in much the same way as many 'Kirktons' exist as at Kilmaurs-Glencairn and Stewarton kirks.
|}
Dobie&lt;ref name="Dobie"/&gt; in 1876 records that Hugh, Earl of Eglinton inherited in May 1661 the 10 merkland of Langshaw with the patronage of the Chapel of the Blessed Virgin within these lands. A reference is made to a James Wyllie, whose family held these lands for several generations. This statement is made as part of a reference to the 5 merk lands of Gallaberry which were part of a larger area of land, most of which belonged to the estate of Dunlop. The name Gallaberry&lt;ref name="Dobie"/&gt; is thought to be derived from the Saxon word ''burgh'' and the Celtic word [[Gaul]]s, the term meaning therefore the burgh, mansion or strength of the Gauls. Sanderson mentions a rural chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mother Mary located on the Lainshaw lands.

It is relevant here to note that Dobie lists three families with the name Tempiltoun in the Kilmaurs valuation role of 1640 while no other Cunninghame parishes have this name listed. One of the oldest graves in Kilmaurs-Glencairn churchyard, dating from the 17th century, is that of a Tempiltoun. The family Bible of the Templetons is held (2008) by the Forrests of Byres Farm, who are direct descendants.

Dobie states that two chapels existed, one at [[Lands of Lainshaw|Lainshaw]] and one at Chapeltoun, however he may have confused the term 'attached' which can mean that it was on the land of or had been endowed by the owner or the Lord of the Barony, rather than necessarily being in close proximity to the castle/house of Lainshaw. If Patersons statement implying that only one chapel existed and that it was at Chapelton is correct, and he was brought up locally, then our knowledge of the history of the Chapel of St. Mary is greatly increased.

The Topographical Dictionary of Scotland in 1846 states that "About a mile from the town (Stewarton), on the farm of Chapelton (now Chapeltoun Mains), were recently dug up the foundations of an ancient chapel, of which however, no authentic records have been preserved."
[[File:Chapelhill1.JPG|left|thumb|190px|The Chapel Hill from the Annick Water.]]
In January 1678 Robert Cunynghame, druggist / apothecary / surgeon in Edinburgh, is stated to be the heir to Anne, daughter of Sir Robert Cunynghame of Auchenharvie. She was his [[wikt:cousin-german|cousin-german]] and part of the inheritance was 10 merk land of Fairlie-Crivoch, with the chapel lands and glebe of Fairlie-Crivoch. No other chapel is in the locality, so this most probably refers to the Chapel at Chapelton. He also owned much of the lands of [[Lambroughton]]. Crivoch was a barony and the lands had been split into Lindsay-Crevoch and Montgomerie-Crevoch. Fairlie Crevoch is probably the property close to the old Crivoch Mill at Kennox.

The chapel can never have been very large and was abandoned at the time of the Protestant reformation in Scotland led by the ex-Roman Catholic priest [[John Knox]] (1514 to 1572). It is not marked as a ruin on the 1775 Armstrong map, but as a small mansion house, implying that a Chapel House existed somewhere in the vicinity, in addition to the 1775 Laigh (possibly later named Chapelton). It has been stated that this site was just called 'chapel' at this time and this is the name given on Armstrong's map.

No evidence for the site of the priest's dwelling exists, however the site of the old Templeton/Chapelton House suggest itself. If the Laigh marked on the 1775 map refers to Laigh Chapelton then the antiquity of the site is further enhanced as it is the only other named site in the vicinity of the chapel.

The history of the monastic settlement and the chapel of Saint Mary at the Chapel Crags beside the [[Thurgartstone|Thugart stane/T'Ogra Stane/Thurgatstane/Thorgatstane/Field Spirit Stane/Ogrestane]] near [[Dunlop, East Ayrshire|Dunlop]] is a parallel example to the Chapel on the Chapel Hill. The pagan stone is still exists, {{convert|13|ft|m}} long, {{convert|10|ft|m}} broad and {{convert|4|ft|m}} high,&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, John (1895). Prehistoric Man in Ayrshire. Pub. Elliot Stock.&lt;/ref&gt; but no evidence of the Christian sites is visible, apart from the inconspicuous Holy Well in the field bordered by the burn. Bayne states that the stone may have been a [[Rocking stone|rocking or 'logan stone']] at one time and it is recorded that the farmer was not permitted to plough within a set distance of the stone, presumably because of a tradition of pagan burials around this monument, which is a 'glacial erratic' in origin. It was still worshiped up until "''the times of popery''" according to McIntosh.
[[File:Annickwater1.JPG|thumb|180px|The Annick Water looking upstream from Chapeltoun Bridge.]]
The topography of the area is typical of the sort of site chosen for early ecclesiastical establishments and the building of chapels or churches on pagan sites is a classic example of the way that Christianity supplanted pagan beliefs and practices. Both these religious sites are also in sheltered valleys, with ample running water and they are hidden from view.

As stated the 1775 Armstrong&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt; map of Ayrshire clearly shows a 'Chapel' marked, so it was known to exist at this time, however the remains would have been mined/removed over the years by local farmers and used for building work, etc. The remains of the chapel would have been hard to locate by the early 18th century. Arrowsmith&lt;ref name="Arrowsmith"&gt;Arrowsnith, Aaron (1807). A Map of Scotland Constructed from original Materials.&lt;/ref&gt;'s 1807 map shows Chapel marked near Linshaw (Lainshaw) and no Laigh mentioned, while Ainslie's 1821 map shows a Chapel and a Laigh.&lt;ref name="Ainslie"&gt;Ainslie, John (1821). A Map of the Southern Part of Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that the term Chapel on most maps could be referring to a dwelling or farm and not the Chapel on the mound.

The 1856 'Name Book'&lt;ref name="rcahms.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/|title=The RCAHMS's Canmore Website|accessdate=16 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Ordnance Survey|OS]] states that part of the house of Chapelton (NS 395 441) is believed to have been a chapel dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]]. Though parts of the building are of great age, it is not certain that this was the chapel; it may have been the residence of the chaplain, while the chapel stood near Chapel Hill. This Chapel Hill is a circular artificial hill. About 1850, Mr. J McAlister raised it to its present height by taking the earth etc. that had slid from its sides, and putting it on the top. While doing this, a quantity of human bones was found near the base on the S and E sides, and also some stones which from their appearance Mr. McAlister thought had been exposed to fire, suggesting that the old chapel was destroyed by fire. Mr. R Miller, a former proprietor, stated that when the present road past Chapel Hill was being made, a quantity of bones was found, giving the idea that there had been a burial ground here.&lt;ref name="rcahms.gov.uk"/&gt;
[[File:Lambroughton Woods.JPG|left|thumb|230px|The Bonnie wood o' Lambroughton.]]
Smith,&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; the well known antiquarian, in 1895 describes the mound as being 22 paces in diameter, {{convert|20|ft|m}} high on the low side and {{convert|7|ft|m}} high on the high side. He states that it is well cared for and that a flight of steps, not clearly visible today, ran up from its base to the top. However significantly he makes no reference to any remains of the chapel itself. The 1897 25" to the mile OS shows a path at the Chapelhill House side of the mound and a possibly a curving path or steps up. Smith also states that the mound was repaired some fifty years before, which fits in with the approximate dates for the likely construction of the Chapelton (old) house, by or for James McAlister&lt;ref name="Dobie"/&gt; who is given as the owner of Chapelton at around this time, and it is stated in 1874 that the chapel ruins were found some 40 years before, i.e. around 1834. The 1846 record states that they had been found recently however (Topo Dict Scot).

In 1842&lt;ref name="Steven"&gt;Steven, Rev. Charles Bannatyne (Revised 1842). ''Parish of Stewarton''. Presbytery of Irvine, Synod of Glasgow and Ayr&lt;/ref&gt; it is recorded that "''Near the farm house of Low Chapelton, above a mile below Stewarton, on the right bank of the Annock, there appears to have once been a chapel, the ruins of which were lately dug up, when the proprietor was engaged in planting trees. There are now no records remaining of the place of worship.''"

In the 1980s a group of '[[Wicca]]' chose the Chapel Hill top to hold a '[[Halloween]]' festival with a large bonfire, etc., much to the surprise of the locals.

===The Moot of Chapelton===
A '''Moot Hill of Chapelton''' is recorded in the Register of the Great Seal of Scotland as being specifically excluded by King James from a grant of lands including Lainshaw, Robertland and Gallowberry to Alexander Hume in the 15th century. This could be a secondary use of a burial mound, although a number of the 'Moot' or 'Justice' Hills seem to have been constructed for the purpose. It may imply that the chapel itself was not on the hill, given that the 15th-century date is pre-reformation and the chapel would therefore be still in use.

===Alternative names for the Chapel Hill===
[[File:Chapel Hill from Chapeltoun Mains.JPG|thumb|200px|The Chapel Hill from near Chapeltoun Mains.]]
Alternative local names for the burial mound are the 'Jockey's cap' and the 'Monk's Graveyard', the 1897 OS map states that human bones were found in the hill. The Forrest family of Byres Farm are direct descendants of the Templetons and they use the term 'Monk's Graveyard' for the Chapel Hill. The validity of oral tradition in this case is exceptionally strong and may indicate that the chapel was not on the mound but on the site of the old Chapelton House. John Dobie in his additional notes to his father's work calls the site 'the Chapeltons'. The mound itself is one of the finest preserved Bronze Age burial mounds in Ayrshire.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; A previous owner of the Chapel Hill mound allowed an unofficial excavation to take place in around 2001. It is not known if any finds were made.

A visit by the [[Ordnance Survey|OS]] in August 1982 stated that "It is difficult to make any accurate assessment of this feature. It has obviously been altered and landscaped beyond any recognition of its original form, and in its present state has an ornamental appearance. Situated on the edge of a natural N–S scarp line at approximately 60 m, it is possible that this was at one time just a slightly raised promontory, but as such, it is almost certainly not a motte and would be more typical of a homestead position in this region.”

The name 'Jockey's Cap' originates from the days when the annual [[Stewarton|'Stewarton Bonnet Guild Festival']] included horse racing – like the [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|'Irvine Marymass']] Celebrations still do. The mound was the perfect site for viewing the 'racecourse' set out on the field below 'Chapeltoun Mains'. The shape of the mound is reminiscent of a jockey's cap.

== Chapelton and the Kennox connection ==
{{main|Kennox House}}
Sir Neil Montgomery of Lainshaw married Elizabeth Cunninghame of Aiket and one of their sons, John of Cockilbie, had a son named John of Crivoch in the mid-17th century. He may have lived at Crivoch before it was purchased by the Somervilles and passed by marriage to the MacAlisters.&lt;ref name="Paterson"/&gt; [[File:Jsomervellkennox.jpg|thumb|160px|Signature of John Somervell of Kennox, 1728.]]The letters of Sir David Cunningham of Auchenharvie to his cousin the laird of Robertland preserved in the National Archives of Scotland detail his efforts to purchase some of these lands (NAS GD237/25/1-4) He sold some of them in turn to James Douglas of Chesters in 1642 (RGS, ix, (1634–1651), no.1189) In around 1700 John Somerville of the Kennox Estate in Lanarkshire purchased the Bollingshaw (now Bonshaw) Barony, including Chapeltoun, and built Kennox (also Kenox in 1832 and Kennoch in 1792) House on the lands of Montgomerie – Crevoch.&lt;ref name="Paterson"/&gt;

[[Montfode Castle|Hugh Montfode of that Ilk]]'s sister Jean was married to John Miller of Laigh Chapelton who died in 1622; they had a son Hugh Miller. Jean Montfode nominated John Miller to be her executor.&lt;ref name=ff&gt;Paterson, Page 54&lt;/ref&gt; The American genealogist Steve Miller has revealed that in 1828 the deceased John Miller, was through his son James who was then living at [[Montfode Castle|Montfode House]], being sued by Col Charles S. McAlister of Kennox.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Gazette No.3655, Page 153&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles S. McAlister and Janet had four children. They bequeathed the part of the Barony of Bollingshaw named Chapelton (the glebes and chapel lands of the Register of Sasines) to their younger son James, who never married and died in 1857.
[[File:Kennoxgates2007.JPG|180px|thumb|The gates and remains of the old lodges at Kennox House in 2007.]]

No date is given for when James Somerville obtained Chapelton, however we know from Dobie that James McAlister, nephew of the aforementioned James, was the owner in 1874. This James McAlister, the nephew of James Somerville, also never married. Chapelton had been re-acquired into the Bollingshaw Barony for him by his Father, Charles McAlister.&lt;ref name="Paterson"/&gt;

==Templeton becomes Chapelton and develops into an Estate==
The Armstrong map of 1775 show a 'Laigh' in fairly close proximity to the 'Chapel'. This is in all probability Laigh Chapelton, suggesting that a dwelling existed at this date and adding strength to the supposition that Laigh Chapelton was a building, or the site of a building, of some considerable antiquity. A legal document, 'Defences for James Wilson of High Chapelton sued by John Miller of Laigh Chapelton' in 1820 gives us the names of the tenants of both of these properties at this time&lt;ref name="Smith-David"/&gt; The rental valuie circa 1820 was £180.&lt;ref name="Robert"&gt;Robertson, George (1820). ''A Topographical Description of Ayrshire; more particularly of Cunninghame.'' Pub. Cunninghame Press, Irvine. P. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal name change from Templeton to Chapelton did not occur as a result of the rediscovery of the St. Mary's Chapel ruins by the new landowner, James McAlister, for it had clearly never been truly lost as such. However the discovery may help provide an approximate date for the reconstruction / extension of the house at Laigh Chapelton. Paterson says in 1866 that the chapel discovery was some years before, evidence from Dobie gives us the date of 1836 and Smith's evidence gives the date of 1845. Aitken shows only a Laigh Chapelton Farm in 1829 and all this suggests that the 'old' Chapelton House and estate were developed in around 1830 to 1850. The early to mid-19th century is a time during which many country houses were built, modernised or extended&lt;ref name="Davis206-7"&gt;Davis, Michael C. (1991). ''The Castles and Mansions of Ayrshire''. Pub. Spindrift Press, Ardrishaig, Pps. 206 &amp; 207.&lt;/ref&gt; and OS maps show the increasing importance of the Laigh Chapelton estate around this time, with the development of formal gardens (from the 1858 OS), new driveways, etc.

===Chapeltoun Mains===
[[File:Chapeltounmains.JPG|left|thumb|190px|Chapeltoun Mains farm with 'Black Sawney's Park' in front, taken from near Chapeltoun Bridge.]]
Chapeltoun (Chapleton, Chappleton, Chapeltown, etc.) Mains farm changes its name from simple Chapelton, which Laigh Chapelton now adopts as the site of the new mansion house, sometime between 1829 and 1858. This suggests that at this time Chapelton Mains was the home farm prior to the building of what is now Chapelhill House in around 1911, as judged from the OS maps. A small building appears near the site of Chapelburn Cottage from 1858. The area around the front of the farm is referred to as 'Black Sawneys Park'; '[[Sawney]]' being an English term for 'Alexander'. At one time it effectively meant a 'Scotsman', as with the use of the name 'Jock'. Another explanation is that the field had black sandy soil due to the river flooding onto the holm and creating rich fertile soil.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William (2009). Oral information. Bottoms point Crevoch Farm.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wattshode ===
[[File:Wattshode1.JPG|thumb|190px|The shelter belt and site of Wattshode.]]
A small property set in {{convert|4|acre|ha}} of the 5 Merk lands of Chapelton, named Wattshode or Wattshod is mentioned as far back as 1723 in the Chapeltoun Mains legal papers.&lt;ref name="Chapeltoun"&gt;Chapeltoun Mains Archive (2007) – legal documents of the Lands of Chapelton from 1709 onwards.&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong records a 'Wetshode' in 1775.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt; In 1598 the word 'Wattshode' was some sort of fabric, frequently described as blue. It could include the local surname name 'Watt'.

A shelter belt beside the track up to Bogflat and signs of [[Urtica dioica|nettle]] growth restricted to the possible site of a building suggests that Wattshode stood in this {{convert|4|acre|ha|adj=on}} field behind Cankerton (previously Cantkertonhole&lt;ref name="Chapeltoun"/&gt;). General Roy's map of 1747 – 55 marks only Watshode and Chapeltoun by name. 'Red Wat-shod' is a Scots expression used by Robert Burns meaning blood-spattered boots.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Patrick Scott (2008). Robert Burns The Patriot Bard.

===Chapelton Moss Head, Bottoms point Crivoch, and Bogside===
[[File:Bottoms point Crevoch.JPG|thumb|190px|Bottoms point Crevoch Farm.]]
A farm originally called Chapelton Moss Head by Thomson in 1828 or Mosshead of Chapelton, is later called just Mosshead and was situated in the fields of Bottoms Farm with its entrance just after the bridge over the Chapel Burn. All traces of it above ground have vanished, while Bogside cottage is still represented by building debris at the edge of the field near the entrance to the Bogflat Farm. Bogside had a rental value of £10 in 1820 and the proprietor was Robert Stevenson. Bottoms point Crevoch farm still exists close to Kennox (2009).

===Bogflat===
[[File:Bogflat1.JPG|left|thumb|190px|Bogflat Farm.]]
Bogflat Farm has been lovingly rebuilt circa 2004 by Stuart Kerr and his wife Stephanie. Stewarton Old Parish Records show Hugh Parker and his spouse Susanna Wardrop living at Bogflat in 1809 when their daughter Annabella was born.  The Parkers were still in residence at the time of the 1841 census.  Neighbours Susanna Wardrop Parker of Bogflat Farm and Agnes Wardrop Watt in Parkside Farm were sisters. John Earl and Isobel his spouse were residing at Bogside in 1827.&lt;ref name="McAlester"&gt;McAlester (1827). Correspondence to William Patrick Esq., Albany Street, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881 an Alexander Muir, aged 38, a general merchant lived at Bogflat with his wife Margaret and sons David and John. A building named Bog is marked on Armstrong's 1775 map and this was most likely Bogflat for we know from a [[Marriage stone]] from Bogflat, now in the Stewarton Museum, that a dwelling was there in 1711 with a 'JR' recorded and other initials, unfortunately now cut off.&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;McDonald, Ian (2006). Oral Communications to Roger S. Ll. Griffith.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 Robert Bryce, Import and Export Merchant of Melbourne, Australia owned Chapelton and Bogflat.&lt;ref&gt;Search over Lainshaw, Page 273&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parkside (Windwaird) and Cankerton Hollow===
[[File:Cankerton.JPG|thumb|180px|Cankerton, previously Cakertonhole, from near Wattshode.]]
Windwaird is the name given by Aitken in 1829 to a house on the Torranyard to Stewarton road, not far from the fairly recently created entrance for pedestrians to Lainshaw House that runs through the Anderson Plantation (a name marked on the maps but not used by the local farmers). This building is called Parkside on the OS maps, first shown on the 1832 map, it is marked on the 1960, but not the 1974 OS. Stewarton Old Parish Records show Alexander Watt and his wife Agnes (Wardrop) in Parkside when their daughter Mary was born in May 1809.  In 1809, neighbours Susanna Wardrop Parker in Bogflat Farm and Agnes Wardrop Watt in Parkside Farm were sisters. The last family to live here were the Muir's, relatives of the Muir's of Gillmill (also Gillmiln) Farm. A 'park' refers to an area of enclosed land in the days when most land was not enclosed with hedges or fencing.

In 1616 the "lands of the Waird, etc." were conveyed to David Cunninghame of Robertland by William, Lord Kilmaurs (McNaught 1912), but any connection with this site is unproven. A ''waird'' is a feudal land tenure right conferred through military service obligations of tenants (see Definitions and Scot's words). Wardpark near Lochridge is spelt Wairdpark in Pont's map of 1604.

Cankerton or Cankerton Hollow is rarely indicated by name; it was the home of James Orr, farmer who died on 6 April 1859 aged 43 (born 31 May 1845). His wife Mary King Brown had died on 12 July 1845 aged just 25 (born 20 September 1820).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ayrshirehistory.com/mauchline_drummond_bogwood.html Drummond family history. Accessed : 6 January 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Another John Orr farmed here with his spouse Janet Wilson. He died on 21 January 1847, aged 68, and she died on 16 October 1889, aged 79, having moved into High Chapeltoun to live with her brothers. Husband &amp; spouse were buried at the Laigh Kirk, Stewarton. Cankerton, originally Cankerton was also found locally as a surname, but the etymology is unclear, a 'canker' usually meaning a 'blight, a fungal disease' of trees or cereals. A Cankerton Estate is listed under a survey of coal deposits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/search_item/index.php?service=NAS&amp;id=RHP10000/AR2 Scotland's Places.

===High Chapeltoun===
High Chapelton is first marked on the 1829 and the 1858 maps, together with a limekiln and a ford over the Annick. An old track is seen running from the farm to the field containing the 'grain barn' near Laigh Castleton; ploughing in this field has not turned up any stones, building or otherwise therefore suggesting a building constructed from wood. James Wilson and his spouse Mary Steven farmed at High Chapeltoun in 1760, when she died, aged 56. They were buried at the Laigh Kirk in Stewarton. Mary Reid of High Chapelton and Stacklawhill was born here on 20 January 1827, daughter of Thomas Reid of Stacklawhill. His wife was Mary Wilson of High Chapelton. The memorial stone is in the Stewarton cemetery. The rental value in around 1820 was £137.&lt;ref name="Robert"/&gt;

==Chapelton (old) house and gardens==
[[File:Chapeltoun House (old).jpg|250px|thumb|The old Chapeltoun House prior to 1908.]]
The 1858 OS shows two buildings on the site, very close to each other but not physically connected. One building probably being the old Laigh Chapelton Farm and the other, on the right, being the residence built for James McAlister. The photograph (Davis 1991) seems to be of the side of the house facing onto the road and the Chapel Hill. The 1851 OS shows formal gardens with a boundary wall, paths and a central feature, possibly a pond. The 1897 OS shows one large building with wings and extensions which appear to be porches and possibly a conservatory. By this date the formal gardens are absent, as in the 1911 OS. The [[ha-ha]] is not shown in the large scale map of 1897 OS, but appears to be present in the 1858 and the 1911 editions. No footbridge can be made out, however the OS maps have a number of errors and omissions, especially the exact outlines of buildings which are often only 'approximations'. Between 1858 and 1897 a main driveway has been constructed into the grounds from nearly opposite the Chapel Hill and a formal path with steps leads from the position of today's main entrance down to Chapelton House.

== Construction of the New Chapeltoun House and Estate ==
The Chapelton (old) House was demolished in around 1908, possibly following a fire as this is the strong local tradition for the demise of the house.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, David (2003). Peacockbank Farm, Stewarton, North Ayrshire.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;Wilson, James (2003). Mid Lambroughton Farm, North Ayrshire.&lt;/ref&gt; A Miss Mary McAllister may have been the last occupant of the house.&lt;ref name="Forrest"&gt;Forrest, James (2003). Mid Lambroughton Farm, North Ayrshire.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the dressed stonework may have been used in the building of the new house, garden and drive walls, the sides of the Chapel burn and elsewhere. The walling around the field side of the Chapel Hill mound is not entirely built with stones from Chapelton (old) House as some old building rubble was brought in from elsewhere at a much later date by the owner of Chapeltoun Mains, Mr. A. Robinson.&lt;ref name="Smith-David"&gt;Smith, Barbara and David. (2006) Oral communication.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gate to the field below the mound has three sandstone gateposts laid horizontally, two of them are exceptionally large and could be the ornamented gateposts from the old entrance and driveway to Chapelton (old) House. The actual drive is now represented by the curling pond behind the walled up entrance and the OS maps show an entrance here until at least 1911. Chapeltoun Mains has only one gatepost and both High Chapeltoun and Chapelhill house have none. These changes probably reflect the requirement to have access for large modern farm machinery. The gateposts are machine cut sandstone and the same design is found elsewhere, such as at the Kennox lodge, Cankerton and opposite Peacockbank Farm (previously Pearce Bank) near Stewarton, near the original entrance road to Lochridge. In 1775 Armstrong's map shows the road going no further than Lochridge (formerly Lochrig). A wind-pump is shown situated above Chapeltoun House on the 1923 OS map.
[[File:Chapeltounlodge.JPG|thumb|180px|Chapeltoun Lodge.]]
During demolition it was noted&lt;ref name="Davis206-7"/&gt; that the stonework in the lower story of Chapelton (old) House was noticeably older than the upper story as would be expected if Laigh Chapelton had developed into Chapelton when it acquired an owner with greater financial means, Mr. James McAlister (or MacAlester), who added first a new 'mansion house', later an upper story to the old farm, developed the ornamental gardens and probably built the bridge over the river with the associated 'ha-ha' (see the section on the estate gardens and landscape).

Michael Davis records that Hugh Neilson, the owner of [[Coatbridge|'Summerlee Iron Company']] had the present mansion house designed in 1908 by Alexander Cullen, an architect from Hamilton. Harling is used extensively on the walls and this was originally left in an unpainted, artistic, grey state.&lt;ref name="Close"&gt;Close, Robert (1992), Ayrshire and Arran. ''An Illustrated Architectural Guide''. Pub. Royal Inc of Arch in Scotland. {{ISBN|1-873190-06-9}}. p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved into the house in 1910, however The gate-lodge was not built until around 1918, having been designed by Cullen, Lochhead and Brown. R.W.Schultz had proposed a terraced garden in 1911, but it is not known to what extent the existing terraces reflect this design. The pillars at the base of the main flight of steps incorporate old ornamental worked sandstone, presumably from the Chapelton (old) House. A separate conservatory building existed in front of the house at one time according to the Kilmarnock Glenfiled Ramblers.&lt;ref name=KGR/&gt; The name 'Chapeltoun', with the extra letter 'u' was presumably adopted for the new mansion house.

A small iron cannon dated 1840 once stood in front of the house having been built by Mr Neilson at his Oak Bank Foundry.&lt;ref name=KGR/&gt;
[[File:Chapelburncottage1.JPG|left|thumb|180px|Chapelburn Cottage]]
Hugh Neilson was a keen player of the bagpipes and the music could be heard at many of the surrounding farms, drifting up from the estate gardens. He was also very fond of curling and as soon as the weather was cold enough he would invite all the locals down for a match and a dram at his curling pond (Hastings 1995). It is believed to have been restored when the house was a hotel, using concrete and tarmac.

The Chapeltoun Estate was never very large, incorporating Chapeltoun Mains, High Chapeltoun, the home farm (now Chapelhill House), Chapelburn Cottage, Mosshead of Chapelton Farm, Bogside cottage and Bogflat. Cankerton (Cankertonhole) and Bloomridge (Bloomrig) were part of the Kennox Estate. Between 1924 and 1960 the Neilsons owned Linn House in [[Dalry, North Ayrshire|Dalry]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Page 317&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogside cottage was lived in by Mr. Troop and his family and later on by a Mr. McGaw who worked at Chapeltoun Mains. He was the Chapeltoun House gardener. Mr. Thow (pronounced Thor) a forester, lived with his family at the Bogflat Farmhouse. A chauffeur, a Mr. McLean lived at Chapelburn cottage&lt;ref name="Wilson-Jenny"&gt;Wilson, Jenny (2006). Oral Communication.&lt;/ref&gt; and Firbank existed as a small copse with a possible (unrecorded) standing stone, the bungalow was built in the 1970s.

An incident remembered by Mrs. Wilson is that of Mr. Neilson challenging a young man from Kilmaurs to a fist fight because he had found that the man was courting one of his housemaids.

The 'mansion' house of 1910 has had a number of changes of use after it was a private house, being the headquarters of an insurance company and a hotel under several different owners, before becoming a family home again around 2004. The [[Lobnitz]] family of Chapeltoun House moved to High Clunch. The Third Statistical Account of 1953 still records Chapeltoun as being one of the six main estates in the parish of Stewarton.

==Gardens and landscape==
A finial from Chapelton House or possibly a 'wheat sheaf' from the old Monks' Well is used as a feature in the gardens.&lt;ref name=KGR/&gt; Apart from pure ornamentation the [[finial]] can also function as a lightning rod, and was once believed to act as a deterrent to witches on broomsticks attempting to land on one's roof. On making her final landing approach to a roof, the witch, spotting the obstructing finial, was forced to sheer off and land elsewhere. An old lintel from a door is recorded in 1939 as being built into a wall in the garden with the inscription 'S.M. 1740', possibly standing for one of the 'Miller' family'.&lt;ref name=KGR/&gt;

===The Monks' well===
[[File:Finialchapelton.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A possible finial from the entrance porch at old Chapelton House or a 'wheat sheaf' from the Monks' Well.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Page 207&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the woodland policies of Chapeltoun House is the Monks' Well (OS 1974), fountain or spring as indicated on the OS maps going back as far as 1858. Its present appearance is probably as a Victorian or Edwardian 'whimsy' or '[[folly]]' with a large, thick sandstone 'tombstone appearance' with a slightly damaged cross carved in relief upon it and a spout through which the spring water once passed into a cast iron 'bowl'. The Kilmarnock Glenfield Rambler's visited Chapeltoun in 1939 and recorded that a gargoyle had once been present as a spout and that the 'cross' was actually a 'wheat sheaf' that had stood on top of the stone.&lt;ref name=KGR&gt;Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers. 03/06/1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems unlikely from the workmanship that the well's stone and 'cross' have anything to do with the old chapel, but one possibility is that it came from over the entrance door to Laigh Chapelton as the custom was for a Templar property to have the 'cross' symbol of the order displayed in such a fashion.&lt;ref name="Dobie"/&gt; On the other hand it could have been made for the Chapelton (old) House to associate the building with the Christian history of the site. The stone is unusually thick and has been clearly reworked to pass a spout through it.&lt;ref&gt;Love, Dane (2009). ''Legendary Ayrshire. Custom : Folklore : Tradition''. Auchinleck : Carn Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-9518128-6-0}}; p. 62 – 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ordnance Survey|OS]] record that in the 1970s a Mr. H.Gollan of Chapeltown stated that the 'Monk's Well', was believed to have been associated with the chapel. In July 1956 the OS state that the 'Monk's Well' is a spring emerging through a stone pipe, situated in a stone-faced cutting in the hill slope. Above the spring is a stone slab with a cross in relief.

===The Curling pond===
A well is marked near the Chapelton (old) House which became a pump later and may now be represented by a surviving stone lined well with steps leading down to it. The water from this well was used to fill the [[Curling|Curling Pond]] which was built by the Neilsen's on the site of the original driveway into the old house/farm. It is said that the curling pond was constructed on the site of the old stables.&lt;ref name=KGR/&gt;
[[File:Hahachapelton.jpg|thumb|180px|A view of the Chapelton [[ha-ha]].]]
At the top edge of riverside meadow are to be found a couple of sizeable [[glacial erratics]], which were dug out during the construction of the sewerage treatment plant. The remains of the abutments of a footbridge across the river are visible where the garden boundary hedge meets the Annick and Florence Miller remembers the bridge as still standing in the late 1920s. This presumably Victorian or Edwardian feature would take people across to the area delineated by a small [[ha-ha]], now thick with [[rhododendron]]s (R.ponticum), typically planted by estate owners.

===The ha-ha===
On the [[Lambroughton]] side of the river is a substantial wall with a wide ditch in front, built with considerable labour and of no drainage function. This structure was probably a [[ha-ha]] (sometimes spelt har har) or sunken fence which is a type of boundary to a garden, pleasure-ground, or park so designed as not to interrupt the view and to not be seen until closely approached. The ha-ha consists of a trench, the inner side of which is perpendicular and faced with stone, with the outer slope face sloped and turfed – making it in effect a sunken fence. The ha-ha is a feature in many landscape gardens laid and was an essential component of the "swept" views of Lancelot [[Capability Brown]]. "The contiguous ground of the park without the sunk fence was to be harmonized with the land within; and the garden in its turn was to be set free from its prim regularity, that it might assort with the wilder country without". Most typically they are found in the grounds of grand country houses and estates and acted as a means of keeping the cattle and sheep out of the formal gardens, without the need for obtrusive fencing. They vary in depth from about 5 feet (Chapeltoun House) to 9 feet (Petworth).

The old driveway to Lainshaw House off the Stewarton to Torranyard road also has a ha-ha on the side facing the home farm before it reaches the woods. The name ha-ha may be derived from the response of ordinary folk on encountering them and that they were, "...then deemed so astonishing, that the common people called them Ha! Ha's! to express their surprise at finding a sudden and unperceived check to their walk." An alternative theory is that it describes the laughter of those who see a walker fall down the unexpected hole. A seat may have been situated by the ha-ha and the woodland view would have been, and indeed still is, very attractive as this area is clearly an ancient woodland remnant. The stone boundary wall stops in line with the ha-ha.

===Chapeltoun Bridge===
The Chapeltoun Bridge over the Annick and is a carefully designed sandstone structure complementing the scene. 'Stepping stones' are marked on the 1897 OS map as being located just downstream from here. The name Annick, previously Annock, Annoch (1791) or Annack Water, possibly derives from the Gaelic ''abhuin'', meaning water and ''oc'' or ''aig'' meaning little or small. The valley which this river runs through was once called ''Strathannock''.&lt;ref name="Dobie"/&gt; Immense labour has been expended building walls on either side of the river and even the Chapel Burn bed is 'cobbled'.

'Fossilised' linear bands of stone deposition in gardens which were part of this 'boundary' field suggest that the old [[Rig and furrow]] system was used hereabouts, however extensive modern ploughing has hidden the 'tell tale' signs.&lt;ref name="McNaught"&gt;*McNaught, Duncan (1912). ''Kilmaurs Parish and Burgh.'' Pub. A.Gardner.&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of stone clearance in the 'Lambroughton Woods' bearing plough scoring, illustrates the extent of the ploughing. Other fields in the area still show these unmistakable signs of cultivation and place names such as Lochrig (now Lochridge) and Righead Smithy preserve the history of the practice.

==Natural history==
The area of 'wild-wood' beyond the ha-ha, with its 'sheets of bluebells', the wood rushes, wood sorrel, dog's mercury, snowdrops, celandine, broad buckler, lady and male-shield ferns, helleborine orchids and other species typical of long established woodlands, abruptly ends at the 'march' (estate boundary) indicated by a large earth bund and a coppiced boundary beech. The 1858 OS shows the wood as confined to the area of the ha-ha, however by 1897 the OS shows woodland as far up as the march. The Lambroughton woods beyond (until recently the property of the Montgomery / Southannan Estate) are not shown on the older maps including the 1911 OS, they are shown in the 1960 OS map as a pine plantations&lt;ref name="Groome"&gt;Groome, Francis H. (1885). ''Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland: A Survey of Scottish Topography.'' V.6. P. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst what was scrub or partial woodland cover containing elder, gean, ash, etc. Before this time the area above the river was not even fenced off at the top where it becomes 'level' with the field.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Although [[Heracleum mantegazzianum|giant hogweed]] is taking hold along the Annick (2006), however the riparian (water side) flora is still indicative of long established and undisturbed habitats. The rare crosswort, (a relative of the goosegrass or cleavers) is found nearby. The river contains, amongst others, brown trout, sea trout, salmon, eels, minnows, and stickleback. The water quality is much improved since the Stewarton cloth mills closed and the river no longer carries their dyes and other pollutants as shown by the presence of freshwater limpets and shrimps, together with leeches, caddis fly larvae and water snail species.

[[Kingfisher]]s have been seen just downstream and the estate's woodland policies and river contain, amongst others, tawny and barn owls, herons, mallard, ravens, rooks, treecreepers, buzzards, peewits or lapwings, roe deer, mink, moles, shrews, grey squirrels, hares, hedgehogs, foxes, [[badger]]s, [[pipistrelle]] bats and probably [[otter]]s. Migrating Canada and [[greylag goose|greylag geese]] frequent the nearby fields on their way up from the [[Solway Firth|Caerlaverock]] or coming down from [[Spitzbergen]] in the winter. Duncan McNaught&lt;ref name="McNaught"/&gt; in 1895 records that he found a kingfisher's nest at an arms length inside an earthen burrow at Chapelton on the Annick.

The estate woodlands contains typical species, such as copper beech, horse-chestnut, yew, bay-laurel, oaks, ornamental pines, and a fine walnut. Several very large beeches and sycamores are also present. The ''Glenfield Ramblers'' recorded two especially rare species in the area of the Lainshaw Estate, the [[Pyrola minor|lesser wintergreen]] and the [[bird's nest orchid]]. Unfortunately no precise details of the site were recorded.&lt;ref name="Glen. Ramb."&gt;Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers Society. (1930). V.10. P. 62 &amp; 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hedgerow trees accepted today as part of the familiar landscape were not planted by farmers for visual effect, they were crops and the wood was used for building and fencing and the millers needed beech or hornbeam wood for mill machinery, in particular for the sacrificial cogs on the main drive gears. It is not generally appreciated how much the Ayrshire landscape has changed its character, for even in 1760–70 the ''Statistical Account'' it is stated that "there was no such thing to be seen as trees or hedges in the parish; all was naked and open".

The Glazert burn, previously Glazart or Glassert&lt;ref name="Paterson-2"&gt;Paterson, James (1847). ''History of Ayr and a Genealogical Account of the Ayrshire Families.'' P. 452.&lt;/ref&gt; has otters and the rare [[Freshwater pearl mussel|freshwater mussel]] (source of freshwater pearls). The name may come from the celtic, ''glas'' in Gaelic meaning grey or green and ''dur'' meaning water. It is recorded by Dobie in 1876 as being a favourite resort of fishermen and this is still very much the case today (2006). Another River Glazert, runs through a considerable part of the parish of Campsie, emptying itself into the Kelvin, opposite the town of [[Kirkintilloch]].

A number of small woodlands are marked as 'fox coverts', such as below Chapeltoun Mains and near Anderson's Plantation, left for foxes to breed and shelter in safety. The local Eglinton [[Hunting|hunt]] used to meet at Chapeltoun House.&lt;ref name="Barclay"&gt;Barclay, Alastair (1989). ''The Bonnet Toun''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fawcett"&gt;Fawcett, William (1934), ''The Eglinton Hunt.'' Pub. The Hunt Association. London. P. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Toll Road and Milestones==
[[File:LawMountMilestone.jpg|thumb|120px|A [[Milestone]] near Stewarton in East Ayrshire.]]
Wheeled vehicles were unknown to farmers in the area until the end of the 17th century and prior to this sledges were used to haul loads&lt;ref name="Strawhorn"&gt;[[John Strawhorn|Strawhorn, John]] and Boyd, William (1951). ''The Third Statistical Account of Scotland. Ayrshire.'' Pub. Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; as wheeled vehicles were useless. Roads were mere tracks and such bridges as there were could only take pedestrians, men on horseback or pack-animals. The first wheeled vehicles to be used in Ayrshire were carts offered gratis to labourers working on Riccarton Bridge in 1726. In 1763 it was still said that no roads existed between Glasgow and Kilmarnock or Kilmarnock and Ayr and the whole traffic was by twelve pack horses, the first of which had a bell around its neck.&lt;ref name="Ker267"&gt;Ker, Rev. William Lee (1900) ''Kilwinnning''. Pub. A.W.Cross, Kilwinning. P. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; A mill-wand was the rounded piece of wood acting as an axle with which several people would role a millstone form the quarry to the mill and to permit this the width of some early roads was set at a 'mill-wand breadth'.
[[File:Crossgates1.JPG|left|thumb|180px|Crossgates Farm.]]
The Stewarton to Torranyard (Torrenzairds in 1613) road was a turnpike as witnessed by the farm name Crossgates (Stewarton 3 and Irvine 5{{fraction|1|4}} miles), Gateside (near Stacklawhill Farm) and the check bars that are shown on the 1858 OS at Crossgates and at the Bickethall (previously Bihetland) road end to prevent vehicles, horse riders, etc. turning off the turnpike and avoiding the toll charges. A small toll house is shown at Crossgates, now demolished, on the left when facing Torranyard. In Scots a 'bicket' is a 'pocket', an appropriate description of the area the farm lies in. A modern cottage nearby is called 'Robelle' after the farmers Robert and Isabelle from Bickethall.

The name 'Turnpike' originated from the original 'gate' used being just a simple wooden bar attached at one end to a hinge on the supporting post. The hinge allowed it to 'open' or 'turn' This bar looked like the 'pike' used as a weapon in the army at that time and therefore we get 'turnpike'. The term was also used by the military for barriers set up on roads specifically to prevent the passage of horses. Other than providing better roads, the turnpikes settled the confusion of the different lengths given to miles,&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, Ruth &amp; Alan (1999). ''The Milestones of Arran''.&lt;/ref&gt; which had varied from 4,854 to nearly {{convert|7000|ft|m}}. Long miles, short miles, Scotch or Scot's miles (5,928&amp;nbsp;ft), Irish miles (6,720&amp;nbsp;ft), etc. all existed. Another point is that when the toll roads were constructed the [[Turnpike trust]]s went to considerable trouble to improve the route of the new roads and these changes could be quite considerable. The tolls on roads were abolished in 1878 to be replaced by a road assessment, which was taken over by the County Council in 1889.

Colonel McAlester was a member of the Turnpike Trust and no doubt exerted considerable influence over the route of the turnpike and other matters. [[John Loudon McAdam]] was very actively involved with Scottish Turnpikes, living at Sauchrie near Ayr until he moved to Bristol to become [[surveying|Surveyor]] to the local Turnpike Trust in 1826.

None of the toll road milestones are visible because they were buried during the [[Second World War]] to prevent them from being used by invading troops, agents, etc.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; This seems to have happened all over Scotland, however Fife was more fortunate than Ayrshire, for the stones were taken into storage and put back in place after the war had finished.&lt;ref name="Stephen"&gt;Stephen, Walter M. (1967–68). Milestones and Wayside Markers in Fife. Proc Soc Antiq Scot, V.100. P.184.&lt;/ref&gt; The milestone near Bloomridge Farm and Kirkmuir Farm are likewise missing, presumed buried.

== Kirkmuir, Kirkhill, Gillmill, Righead and the Freezeland Plantation ==
[[File:Gillmill1.JPG|left|thumb|150px|A view of Gill Mill farm in 2007.]]
[[File:Kirkmuir1.JPG|thumb|150px|A view of Kirkmuir farm in 2007.]]
Close to Kirkmuir (previously Laigh Kirkmuir), a farm occupied by William Mure in 1692,&lt;ref name="Commissariot"/&gt; is the Freezeland plantation (previously Fold Park) on the turnpike as marked on the 1858 OS. Nowadays it is a smallholding without a dwelling house. The origin of the name is unclear, although 'furz' or furs' is old Scots for [[gorse]] or [[whin]], however the existence of this small patch of fenced off land may be linked to the reference in Thomson's 1832 map to a fold, either for sheep or cattle. In 1799 the surrounding field is known as Fold Park.&lt;ref name="NAS10"&gt;National Archives of Scotland. RHP/1199.&lt;/ref&gt; It could have been a pen for strayed stock or be connected with the tolls on the turnpike in some way or a 'stell', the Scot's word for a partial enclosure made by a wall or trees, to serve as a shelter for sheep or cattle. A building may have existed here. Kirkmuir was farmed by John Brown (died 21 August 1880, aged 54) and his wife Catherine Anderson (died 27 August 1895, aged 72). James Walker (died 11 December 1926, aged 86) and his wife Mary Woodburn (died 27 April 1899, aged 57) also farmed Kirkmuir. They were all buried in the Laigh Kirk graveyard.

The field between Kirkmuir &amp; Righead was known as Lady Moss Meadow.&lt;ref name="NAS10"/&gt; Righead was a tollhouse at a later stage, however it was built as a 'butt and ben'. Skirmshaw is the name of some fields nearby in 1797, although no building appears to be present at that time. Picken's (formerly Padzean) Park was across the road from Righead, behind the estate tree boundary. Picken (Padzean) is a fairly common local name (see Kirkhill). Millstone Flat Park is the field above the chalybeate spring on its side of the Ha Ha.through Lady Moss Meadow&lt;ref name="NAS10"/&gt; Kirkmuir was originally a farm on the Longridge Plantation near Highcross Farm (Thomson 1832), later becoming Little Kirkmuir and being marked but not named by 1895, before ceasing to be recorded at all on the OS maps by 1921.

A 'Kirkhill' dwelling is last marked on the 1858 and 1895 0S, below Kirkhill and near to South Kilbride. Andrew Picken was the farmer here in 1867, when his spouse, Ann Blair died, aged 59; she was buried at the Laigh Kirk in Stewarton. It was close to a small burn running from Water Plantation, above Stewarton, in a sheltered glen, typical of early religious settlements and the Kirkhill itself, which was wooded in 1858, is an excellent viewpoint. A track led up to it from Gillmill Farm and it had an entrance near that of South Kilbride. Robert Stevenson farmed at Gillmill and died on 27 May 1810, aged 48.

The plethora of religious names in this area – the Kirkmuirs, Kirkhill, Lady Moss, High Cross, Canaan and the Kilbrides, suggest that at some point in the distant past a pre-Christian and Christian site was located here. No documentary evidence appears to survive and the earliest record is for Kirkry in 1654, now Kilbride. [[Bride]], [[Brigit]] or St. Brigid was originally a Celtic Goddess linked with the festival of [[Imbolc]], the eve of the first of February. She was the goddess of spring and was associated with healing and sacred wells. The Carlin Stone&lt;ref name="Mack"&gt;Mack, James Logan (1926). ''The Border Line.'' Pub. Oliver &amp; Boyd. P. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; at Commoncrags in Dunlop is associated with the 'old winter hag', the antithesis of the goddess Bride.&lt;ref name="Ralls-McLeod"&gt;Ralls-McLeod, Karen &amp; Robertson, Ian. 2003. ''The Quest for the Celtic Key''. Luath Press. {{ISBN|1-84282-031-1}}. P. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; The name Canaan at Kirkmuir was in use as early as 1779. In 1922 James Martin and Mary Gilmour purchased Gillmill and Canaan from the Cunninghames of Lainshaw.&lt;ref&gt;Search over Lainshaw, Page 313&lt;/ref&gt;

High Cross was occupied by the Harvies in 1951, who had purchased the farm from the Nairnshaw Estate in 1921. According to Strawhorn they had reconditioned the old thatched farmhouse in 1915 and added a gravitation water supply, bathroom, telephone and electricity. The farm buildings are now (2006) abandoned and the site awaits a new use.

==Mineral wells and the source of the Chapel Burn==
Paterson&lt;ref name="Paterson"/&gt; (1866) states that there is a mineral spring near Stewarton, called the ''Bloak Well''. Robinson&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt; gives the Scot's word 'blout' as meaning the 'eruption of fluid' or a place that is soft or wet. Both meanings would fit in this context. Blout and Bloak are very similar words, with a Bloak Moss not very far away at [[Auchentiber]].

[[File:Bloakwell.jpg|thumb|150px|A view of Bloak Well, now called Salt Well in 2006.]]
A well recorded as [[Bloak|Bloak Well]] was first discovered in 1800,&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; around 1826 (Paterson 1866) or 1810&lt;ref name="Topographical Dictionary of Scotland"&gt;Topographical Dictionary of Scotland (1846). P. 467&lt;/ref&gt; or 1800, by the fact that pigeons from Lainshaw House and the neighbouring parishes were found to flock here to drink. Mr. Cunningham of Lainshaw built a handsome house over the well in 1833 and appointed a keeper to take care of it as the mineral water was of some value owing to healing properties attributed to it. The well was located in the middle of the kitchen.&lt;ref name="Houston"&gt;Houston, John (1915), Auchentiber Moss, 14 August 1915. Annals of the Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers Society. 1913–1919.

The Chapel Burn rises near the Anderson Plantation in the fields below Lainshaw Mains and it is marked as a [[chalybeate]] or mineral spring on the 1911 6" OS map. Bore holes nearby suggest that the water was put to a more formal use at one time, supplying cattle troughs or possibly even for a stand pipe as mineral water was popular for its supposed curative properties. According to the opinion of the day, it could cure 'the colic, the melancholy, and the vapours; it made the lean fat, the fat lean; it killed flat worms in the belly, loosened the clammy humours of the body, and dried the over-moist brain. The main spring here has been covered over and the water piped out to the burn.&lt;ref&gt;Love, Dane (2009). Legendary Ayrshire. Custom : Folklore : Tradition. Auchinleck : Carn Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-9518128-6-0}}; p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chapelburn1.JPG|left|thumb|200px|The Chapel Burn near its confluence with the [[Annick Water]].]]
The [[chalybeate]] spring (otherwise known as [[Siderite]], a mineral consisting of iron(II) carbonate, FeCO3 – 48 percent iron) described here is not the only well / spring in the area which is identified as being a mineral spring, for there is still a cottage named Saltwell in what was the hamlet of Bloak. This information is stated by the Topographical Dictionary of Scotland, however Mrs. Florence Miller of Saltwell recollects that this well was never known specifically as the Bloak Well.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Miller, Florence (2006). Oral Communications to Roger S.Ll. Griffith.&lt;/ref&gt; The present building was purchased from the Cunninghames of Lainshaw in the 1920s, having been built between 1800 and 1850. It is thought that the salt well now lies beneath the floor of the building and various physical features of the building suggest that it is the structure built by the Cunninghames. The well was first discovered by the fact that migrating birds, especially swifts and swallows, flocked to it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Miller, Florence (2006). Oral Communication.&lt;/ref&gt; It is of unknown composition and is not listed as chalybeate. The cottage was a 'but and ben' and it is a 'handsome' building as described by Paterson. A Redwells Farm is located nearby at Auchentiber, the etymology of ''[[tiber]]'' itself refers to a well.&lt;ref&gt;McNaught, Duncan (1912). ''Kilmaurs Parish and Burgh.'' Pub. A. Gardner.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 the ''Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers' Society'' record a ''Ramble'' during which they walked past the well known local spring, its waters rich in iron, on their way to the Kennox Estate, having already visited the Lainshaw Estate.&lt;ref name="Glen. Ramb."/&gt; This must be the source of the Chapel Burn.

==The March Dyke and a dispute between neighbours==
The Chapeltoun march is a significant historic survival in an Ayrshire context and in addition we have some information about its construction.&lt;ref name="Smith-David"/&gt; Defence for James Wilson Sued by John Miller 7th. August 1820. Manuscript and personal communications.  We are told in 1820 that "the march dyke was "built some many years ago when such boundaries were quite a new thing and thought by some to be rather an incovenience". Ditchers were employed to build it and thorns and trees were purchased to plant on it. The word fence is used as well as dyke in regards of the construction method. Part of the march dyke is still clearly indicated by a large coppiced beech and we know that this coppicing or pollarding was done because such 'marker' trees will live considerably longer than trees which have been left untouched.
[[File:High chapelton.JPG|left|thumb|160px|The Wilson family grave at the Laigh Kirk in [[Stewarton]].]]
[[File:Miller chapeltoun.JPG|thumb|160px|The Miller family grave at the Laigh Kirk in [[Stewarton]].]]
James Wilson of High Chapelton and John Miller of Laigh Chapelton went to court over the matter of the march dyke built between their lands by the father of James.&lt;ref name="Smith-David"/&gt; The document makes it clear that such inclosures were unusual at the time and although John's father very reluctantly agreed to the march dyke being built with a straightening of the old boundary, he did not pay anything towards its construction or for its maintenance, despite the march being of a level of construction which required skilled ditchers to be employed for the task.

The ill-feeling seems to have spread into the next generation for James records that John has cut 'march' trees down in the past and has thrown thorns and brambles from the march into the High Chapeltoun's hayfields. The irony is that John of Laigh Chapelton is suing James for cutting down trees from the march dyke and requires money to plant new trees and to compensate for the inconvenience he has been put through. We do not know the outcome, however the action is described as "trifling and frivolous". The clue to the ill-feeling may be in the term 'straightening' which may imply that John's father agreed to a new march which may have resulted in some small loss of his lands.
[[File:The Lambroughton March.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Part of the disputed Lambroughton March.]]
The rental value of High Chapelton was £137 in 1820 and Laigh Chapelton was £180. The memorial stone to the Miller family of Chapelton (Chapelton is the spelling on the tombstone) is very well preserved at the Laigh Kirk, Stewarton. John Miller died on 3 December 1734, aged 30, and his spouse, Jean Gilmour died on 24 November 1747, aged 42. Their son James died on 1 November 1793, aged 60, and his spouse, Margaret Gilmour, died on 1 April 1802, aged 61. Their son John is the one involved in the dispute; he died on 25 December 1825, aged 59. His spouse was Grizel Gray, who died on 7 January 1855.

The march dyke is clearly marked on the 1885 OS map, following the course of the bank above the water meadow from the riverside and then running up as a 'v' shape towards High Chapeltoun before coming back down to join the lane near the Chapel mound. It doesn't follow the line of the natural ridge above the waterside meadow.

Aiton in 1811 mentions "''a curious notion that has long prevailed in the County of Ayr, and elsewhere, that the wool of sheep was pernicious to the growth of thorns''" (hawthorn or whitethorn and blackthorn or sloe).

Crivoch or Crevoch (also Crevock in 1821&lt;ref name="Ainslie"/&gt;) mill, part of which was recently (2005) rebuilt as Angel Cottage, a family home, was the site of a Mill and associated miller's dwelling, byre, etc. as far back as 1678. 'Cruive' is Scots for a pen for livestock.&lt;ref name="Warrack"&gt;Warrack, Alexander (1982). "Chambers Scots Dictionary". Chambers. {{ISBN|0-550-11801-2}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Crevoch Angel cottage.JPG|thumb|170px|Angel Cottage in 2007 at Crivoch.]]
The old cornmill was part of the Barony of Crevoch and lay in the portion which was called Crivoch-Lindsay. In 1608 Archibald Lindsay was heir to Andrew Lindsay the owner, however by 1617 the lands were in the hands of James Dunlop, whose father was James Dunlop of that Ilk.
In January 1678 Robert Cunynghame, apothecary / druggist in Edinburgh, is stated to be the heir to Anne, daughter of Sir Robert Cunynghame of Auchenharvie. She was his cousin-german and part of the inheritance was the 5 merk land of Fairlie-Crivoch and the mill. He also owned some of the lands of [[Lambroughton]] and [[Auchenharvie Castle|Auchenharvie]] near [[Cunninghamhead]] / Perceton. A Robert and Jonet Galt are recorded as living at Crivoch in around 1668.&lt;ref name="Commissariot"/&gt; In 1742 William Millar, Baillie, was 'Milner in Crivoch Miln'.&lt;ref name="Chapeltoun"/&gt;

The mother of the late Mrs. Minnie Hastings of West Lambroughton Farm&lt;ref name="HastingsM"&gt;Hastings, M (1995). Personal communication to R.S.Ll.Griffith.&lt;/ref&gt; had been one of the last occupants of the house at the Crevoch Mill site. The family name was Kerr. A track led from Crivoch up to Bottoms farm and this gave access through to Chapeltoun. The full name of Bottoms farm is ''Bottoms at Point Crivoch''. The [[Geranium phaeum|dusky cranesbill]], a rare garden escape, was recorded by the Glenfield Ramblers' at Crivoch mill in the 1850s and was still growing at the site in 2004.

In 1735 John Cummin, a schoolmaster, is recorded as living at Crivoch.&lt;ref name="Chapeltoun"/&gt;

===The Gallowayford Cists and Farm===

|'''Etymology'''
|- style="text-align:right; font-size:x-medium;"
|&lt;center&gt;Gallowayford derives its name from the gallows which were positioned here in feudal times. McAlister made this point to the Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers on one of their visits. It is possible that a [[dule tree]] was used as the gallows.&lt;/center&gt;
|}
At Gallowayford near Kennox is the site of the discovery in 1850&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; of stone-lined graves about {{convert|3|ft|m}} square, in a group of tumuli, in which were found two urns containing flint arrowheads and some 'Druid's glass' beads. Charles McAlister Esq. of Kennox House, the laird, had ordered these graves to be opened and examined. The flints and the eleven beads (probably made of amber) have been lost after having been taken into the keeping of the laird. They had at least been photographed and sketched by a visitor in the 1920s. The urns were also feared lost; however, it was found that they had been recorded under Loup and not Kennox (as the owner was Laird of both places) in the record of the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland. In 1949 they had been purchased from the estate. This find is one of the very few where two urns were found in the same cist, and the assemblage of grave goods is unusual.&lt;ref name="Ritchie"&gt;Ritchie, J.N. (1981/82).

[[File:Moundwood.jpg|thumb|170px|A view of the enigmatic Mound Wood on Kennox Moss in 2006]]
Close to the cists site is the Mound Wood on Kennox Moss, an oval shaped artificial structure made of piled turf and surrounded by a well constructed drystone wall. It has not been investigated archaeologically. An access track ran up to it at one time and Roy's map of 1747 indicates that a dwelling known as Water House existed in this vicinity at that time.

The Gallowayford Farmhouse is now (2006) just a jumble of stones, however John Shields and his spouse Jean Guthrie farmed here in the mid-19th century, Jean dying on 4 October 1887 and John on 22 September 1908; they lost a daughter, Isabella at the age of 4 in 1862. James Miller farmed here previously, dying on 3 April 1813. They are all buried at the Laigh Kirk in Stewarton. General Roy's map of 1747–55 clearly shows Gallowayford and Irvinhill.

[[File:Bankendfarm.JPG|left|thumb|190px|A view of Bankend Farm from the Glazert]]
Bankend Farm near the Annick is marked on the 1775 Armstrong's&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt; map, however it shown as a ruin as far back as 1858. Its name was transferred to the farm of Sandilands sometime after 1923 and the name Sandielands (1820), Sandilands or Sandylands dropped, 'apart' from the cottage nearby which uses the name Sandbank. Nothing of old Bankend remains on the site, the rubble now being located on the riverbank. A Hugh Watt lived here in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Chapeltoun"/&gt; The Sandilands family, with the title Lord Torphichen, held the temple-lands and this would have included "the chapel lands and glebe of Fairlie-Crivoch." The soil in these parts is not sandy and the land ownership may very well be the explanation for the origin of the placename given the connection between the Sandylands or Sandilands family and the former Knights Templar estates. The Lainshaw Estate plan of 1779–91 by William Crawford for William Cunningham Esq. names the area as Sandylands and marks a steading called Sandiriggs.&lt;ref name="NAS10"/&gt; The farms of Bankend and Sandylands became combined as the property of Sandilands.&lt;ref&gt;Lainshaw. Register of Sasines. Page 282&lt;/ref&gt;

A ford crossed the river at this point, the road then running up the hill to West Lambroughton. This was an important crossing as no bridge, road or ford existed at Chapeltoun until possibly the time of the building of Chapelton House in the 1850s.

===Clonbeith Castle===

Given as 'Klonbyith' by Pont in the 1690s Clonbeith was then the property of William Cuninghame, [[kinship|Scion]] of this cadet branch of the Glencairn Cuninghames through those of Aiket Castle. John Cuninghame shot and killed the Earl of Eglinton in 1586 and was caught and 'cut to pieces' in [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]], possibly at Hamilton palace.&lt;ref name="Dobie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ker"&gt;Ker, Rev.

==Stewarton area local and social history==
[[Limekiln]]s are a common feature of the area and limestone was quarried in a number of places, such as at Stacklawhill. Limekilns seem to have come into regular use about the 18th century and were located at Stacklawhill, Haysmuir, Bonshaw, High Chapeltoun, Bloomridge (Blinridge in 1828), Gillmill, Sandylands (now Bank End) and Crossgates. Large limestone blocks were used for building but the smaller pieces were burnt, using coal dug in the parish&lt;ref name="Topographical Dictionary of Scotland"/&gt; to produce lime which was a useful commodity in various ways: it could be spread on the fields to reduce acidity, for lime-mortar in buildings or for lime-washing on farm buildings. It was regarded as cleansing agent. A number of small whinstone, sand and sandstone quarries were also present in the area and brick clay was excavated near Kirkmuir.&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;Thomson, John (1828). A Map of the Northern Part of Ayrshire.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aiton in 1811 comments on the growing of carrots by William Cunningham of Lainshaw as an 'excellent article of food for the human species'. This was one of the first estates to grow them in quantity.

In 1820 only six people were qualified to vote as freeholders in Stewarton Parish, being proprietors of Robertland (Hunter Blair), Kirkhill (Col. J. S. Barns), Kennox (McAlester), Lainshaw (Cunninghame), Lochridge (Stewart) and Corsehill (Montgomery Cunninghame).

The [[Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow|Gallery of Modern Art]] (GOMA) is a neo-classical building in Royal Exchange Square in the Glasgow city centre, which was built in 1778 as the townhouse of [[William Cunninghame]] of Lainshaw, a wealthy tobacco lord. The building has undergone a series of different uses; It was used by the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]]; it then became the Royal Exchange. Reconstruction for this use resulted in many additions to the building, namely the [[Corinthian pillar]]s to the Queen Street facade, the cupola above and the large hall to the rear of the old house.

Shoes were only used for Sunday best and for many of the younger folk going bare foot was the order of the day.

[[James Boswell]] of [[Auchinleck House]], the famous biographer and friend of [[Dr. Samuel Johnson]] was married to his cousin Margaret Montgomerie in [[Lainshaw Castle]]. He had gone to Ireland with Margaret, with the intention of courting another wealthy cousin, however he fell in love with the penniless Margaret and married her instead. The room they were married in was one floor above the room in which the [[Earl of Eglinton]] was laid after he was murdered by [[Cunninghame]] at the old brig or ford on the [[River Annick|Annick Water]] near the entrance to the castle on the [[Stewarton]] road.&lt;ref name="Glen.

John Kerr of [[Stewarton]] built the first practical [[beehive]] in the World in 1819, octagonal in shape with a bee-space and a queen separator introduced by 1849. The shape was thought to be closest to the natural tree-trunk shape which bees were thought to favour. [[L. L. Langstroth]] is often credited with these developments, however an examination of the records shows that John Kerr, a cabinet maker, was the first to use these features in a working hive.&lt;ref name="More"&gt;More, Daphne (1976). ''The Bee Book''. {{ISBN|0-7153-7268-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beeboles and straw [[skep]]s were used previous to these developments and here the bees had to be killed to obtain the honey.
Running from Anderson's Plantation across the hill and back down to the old driveway near to the [[walled garden]] is a wall or dyke replacing a tree lined hedge shown in 1858. The wall or dyke is very unusual in that it is made from roughly equal sized rounded whinstones and it is held together by cement. A great deal of expense and effort would have been needed to build this long section of dyke, which seems to have been in place by 1911.

The estate wall running from near Freezeland to near the Law Mount was built by unemployed labourers in the early 19th century.

[[Rudolf Hess]]'s Messerschmitt Bf 110 was spotted by locals as he flew on his mission from Nazi Germany to meet with the [[Duke of Hamilton]] in 1941. He crashed in Eaglesham on Floors Farm.

[[File:Communes locator map of Côte d'Ivoire.jpg|thumb|left|Communes of Ivory Coast. Green dots indicate the location of the settlement that serves as seat of each commune.]]
The '''communes of Ivory Coast''' are a fifth-level administrative unit of administration in [[Ivory Coast]]. The [[sub-prefectures of Ivory Coast]] contain villages, and in select instances more than one village is combined into a commune. There are currently 197 communes in the 510 sub-prefectures.

Prior to 2011, communes were the third-level administrative units of the country. Under the administration of [[Laurent Gbagbo]], the number of communes grew to more than 1300. In 2011, a reorganisation of the [[subdivisions of Ivory Coast|country's subdivisions]] was undertaken, with a goal of decentralising the state. As part of the reorganisation, communes were converted from third-level divisions into fifth-level divisions.

In March 2012, the government abolished 1126 communes on the grounds that under the new jurisdiction of [[districts of Ivory Coast|districts]], [[regions of Ivory Coast|regions]], [[departments of Ivory Coast|departments]], and [[sub-prefectures of Ivory Coast|sub-prefectures]], these particular communes were not viable governmental units economically.&lt;ref name = 2012reorganisation&gt;[http://news.abidjan.net/h/428492.html "Le gouvernement ivoirien supprime 1126 communes, et maintient 197 pour renforcer sa politique de décentralisation en cours"], ''news.abidjan.net'', 7 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the reorganisation, there are now 197 communes in Ivory Coast.&lt;ref name = 2012reorganisation/&gt; In many parts of the country, responsibilities previously carried out by the communes have been transferred to other levels of government. In most cases, the town that is the seat of the commune is also the seat of a sub-prefecture.

[[File:Antarctic-seas-en.jpg|right|thumb|460px|The proposed Cooperation Sea name as part of the [[Southern Ocean]]]]
'''Cooperation Sea''', also called '''Commonwealth Sea''' (erratum) or '''Sodruzhestvo Sea''', is a proposed sea name for part of the [[Southern Ocean]], between [[Enderby Land]] (the eastern limit of which is 59°34'E) and [[West Ice Shelf]] (85°E), off the coast of [[MacRobertson Land]] and [[Princess Elizabeth Land]].&lt;ref&gt;O’Brien, P.E., Cooper, A.K., Richter, C., et al., (2001). [http://www-odp.tamu.edu/publications/188_IR/VOLUME/CHAPTERS/IR188_01.PDF LEG 188 SUMMARY: PRYDZ BAY–COOPERATION SEA, ANTARCTICA]. ''Proceedings of the Ocean Drilling Program, Initial Reports''. Volume 188.&lt;/ref&gt; It would stretch over an area of 258,000&amp;nbsp;km².  It would be bordered by the [[Davis Sea]] on the east, and by another Russian proposal to the 2002 [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO) draft, a [[Cosmonauts Sea]] to the west.

The Cooperation Sea was named in 1962 by the [[Soviet Antarctic Expedition]] in honor of international science cooperation in Antarctica. The name first appeared as a proposal to the IHO in the IHO 2002 draft.  This draft was never approved by the IHO (or any other organization), and the 1953 IHO document (which does not contain the name) remains currently in force.&lt;ref name="IHO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd (currently in-force) edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leading geographic authorities and atlases do not use the name, including the 2014 10th edition of the World Atlas from the United States' [[National Geographic Society]] and the 2014 12th edition of the British [[Times Atlas of the World]]. But Soviet and Russian-issued maps do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rubricon.com/imgbyid.asp?ii=1&amp;iid=219112465]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Davis Station]] is located on the coast near here.

[[File:Copper-20507.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Native copper]] from [[Mufulira]], [[Zambia]] ]]
The '''Copperbelt''' is a [[natural region]] in [[Central Africa]] which sits on the border region between northern [[Zambia]] and the southern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. It is known for [[copper mining]]. 

Traditionally, the term ''Copperbelt'' includes the mining regions of Zambia's [[Copperbelt Province]] (notably the towns of [[Ndola]], [[Kitwe]], [[Chingola]], [[Luanshya]], and [[Mufulira]] in particular) and the Congo's [[Haut-Katanga Province]] (notably [[Lubumbashi]], [[Kolwezi]], and [[Likasi]]). In some contexts the term may exclude the Congo entirely.

== History ==
[[File:Kisanga-mijn Ruandese arbeiders einde-jaren 1920.JPG|thumb|left|Rwandan [[migrant worker]]s in a Congolese copper mine, {{circa}}1920, during the [[Belgian Congo|Belgian colonial period]]]]
[[File:Ancienne unité de monnaie en cuivre.jpg|thumb|right|Pre-colonial copper coin from the [[Katanga Province]]. Nowadays, these coins are not produced anymore, but the remaining are still used symbolically among traditional families for the payment of dowry along with money and other goods.]]

The Western discovery of [[copper]] in Zambia is owed partly to the celebrated American scout [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], who in 1895 led and oversaw the massive Northern Territories (BSA) Exploration Co. expedition which established that major copper deposits existed in Central Africa.&lt;ref name="baxter1970"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baxter |first=T.W. |author2=E.E. Burke |title=Guide to the Historical Manuscripts in the National Archives of Rhodesia |page=67 |year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along the [[Kafue River]] in then [[Northern Rhodesia]], Burnham saw many similarities to copper deposits he had worked in the [[United States]], and he encountered natives wearing copper bracelets.&lt;ref name="scouting"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burnham |first=Frederick Russell |authorlink=Frederick Russell Burnham |title=Scouting on Two Continents |publisher=Doubleday, Page &amp; company |year=1926 |location=|pages=2; Chapters 3 &amp; 4 |oclc=407686 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his report to the [[British South Africa Company]] Burnham had this to say about the region:&lt;ref name="burnham1899"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burnham |first=Frederick Russell |authorlink=Frederick Russell Burnham |editor-first=Walter H. |editor-last=Wills |title=[[s:Northern Rhodesia|Bulawayo Up-to-date; Being a General Sketch of Rhodesia]] |publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent &amp; Co. |year=1899 |pages=177–180 |chapter=Northern Rhodesia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''About 200 miles north of the [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Falls]] on the [[Incalla]] river, and twelve miles from the Kafukwe (Ed: now known as the [[Kafue River]]) and still on the high plateau is probably one of the greatest copper fields on the continent. The natives have worked this ore for ages, as can be seen by their old dumps, and they work it to-day. The field is very extensive, and reaches away to [[Katanga (province)|Katanga]]... The natives inhabiting this part of the country are skilled workmen, and have traded their handiwork with all comers, even as far afield as the Portuguese of the West Coast and the Arabs of the East. These natives, being miners and workers of copper and iron, and being permanently located in the ground, would give the very element needed in developing these fields.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The increasing use of copper bids fair to make it one of the most valuable products a country can have.... The copper mines of [[Montana]] and [[Arizona]] have proven of more value than the gold mines, regardless of the fact that the copper had to be hauled two thousand miles by rail to the seaboard, and the coal and coke to smelt it hauled hundreds of miles to the mines. So far as natural difficulties are concerned, this northern field can be fed from the coal deposits of the valley of the [[Zambezi]] (Ed: Burnham had previously discovered the massive coal fields at [[Hwange]]), and the product shipped to the East Coast at a less expense than the product of Montana and Arizona can be laid on the dock at [[New York City|New York]].''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many years later, the [[British South Africa Company]] built towns along the river and a railroad to transport the copper through [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref name="juang2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Juang |first=Richard M. |title=Africa and the Americas: culture, politics, and history : a multidisciplinary encyclopedia, Volume 2 Transatlantic relations series |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=1157 |year=2008 |isbn=1-85109-441-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prehistory ==
The Copperbelt was inhabited by many prehistoric groups including the [[Chondwe Goup|Chondwe Group]] whose pottery resembles that of Luangwa vessels found today in the [[Kalambo Falls]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillipson|first=D.W.|year=1974|title=Iron Age History and Archaeology in Zambia|jstor=180367|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=15 |issue=1|pages=1–25|doi=10.1017/s0021853700013219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
During the 1950s, this was the largest copper producing area in the world, and included the [[Luanshya|Roan Antelope Mine]], [[Nkana]] Mine, the [[Nchanga Mines]], the [[Mufulira]] Mine, and the Rokana Mine.  [[Chalcopyrite]], [[bornite]], and [[chalcocite]] are found in the [[metamorphosed]] [[calcareous]] [[shale]]s and [[arkose]]s of the Lower Roan [[formation (geology)|Formation]] in the Katanga System.&lt;ref name="Heinrich"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heinrich|first1=E. Wm.|title=Mineralogy and Geology of Radioactive Raw Materials|date=1958|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book COmpany, Inc.|location=New York|pages=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular Culture==
From [[Doris Lessing]]'s [[The Grass is Singing]], "He met a man from [[Northern Rhodesia]], who told him about the copper mines and the wonderfully high salaries.  They sounded fantastic to Tony,  He took the next train to the copper belt..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessing|first1=Doris|title=The Grass is Singing|date=1950|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=9780061673740|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Eine warme Kartoffel ist ein warmes Bett''''' (''A Warm Potato is a Warm Bed'') is a collection of [[essay]]s by [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[Herta Müller]], first published in 1992.&lt;ref name="Eke 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eke |first=N.O. |title=Herta Müller-Handbuch |publisher=J.B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5952">[[File:AT1305 map.png|thumb|Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands ecoregion map.]]

The '''Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands''' [[ecoregion]] is a semi-desert strip on or near the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Aden]] coasts in [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Djibouti]] and [[Somalia]]. This ecoregion lies mainly between sea level and 800 meters (m) elevation. There are, however, many hills and massifs, which range up to 1300 m as well as outstanding fault-induced depressions, such as the [[Danakil Depression|Danakil]], lying as low as 155 m below sea level. This region is extremely active tectonically, experiencing many [[earthquake]]s and intermittently active volcanoes. Rainfall is very low and yearly averages range from 100 to 200 millimeters (mm), with less rain falling closer to the coast. There are many species of interest, including the endemic Archer's lark (Heteromirafra archeri), a species of dragon tree (Dracaena ombet), and a large suite of [[desert]] ungulates, including the last viable population of African wild ass (Equus africanus somalicus).

==Location and description==
This ecoregion extends inland from the Red Sea and the Gulf of Oman, including the [[Dahlak Archipelago]] and other islands, stretching from the Sudanese-Eritrean border, south through [[Ethiopia]] to [[Djibouti]] and eastwards into [[Somalia]], in the [[Somaliland]] region of the country. While it mainly lies between sea level and 800 m, there are many arid hills and massifs up to 1300 m. Higher massifs such as the Goda and Mabla in Djibouti are considered to be outliers of the Ethiopian Montane Forest ecoregion. There are also fault-induced depressions, such as the Danakil Depression and [[Lac Assal]], lying as much as 160 m below sea level. Elevation generally increases westward towards the Ethiopian and Eritrean highlands. The region is extremely active tectonically, and it experiences many [[earthquake]]s associated with the continuing enlargement of the Rift Valley. Volcanoes in the ecoregion are also intermittently active. Basement rocks are composed mainly of Tertiary lava flows, although there are also Quaternary basinal deposits at the northern end and pre-Cretaceous basinal deposits on the northern coast of [[Somalia]]. [[Soil]]s developed over the lava deposits are mainly lithosols, while regosols are predominant on the Quaternary and pre-Cretaceous basinal deposits. There are very few permanent watercourses. The most notable is the [[Awash River]] of [[Ethiopia]] that terminates in a series of lakes near the border with [[Djibouti]].

==Climate==
The [[climate]] is very hot and dry. Mean annual [[rainfall]] varies from less than 100&amp;nbsp;mm close to the coast to around 200&amp;nbsp;mm further inland. Mean minimum [[temperature]]s range from 21° to 24°C, and mean maximum temperature is around 30°C. Most of the people have to build their houses with clay to keep the hot outside and the cold outside.

==Flora==
The plant life of the region needs more study, which has been hampered by long-term political strife in the region. Endemic flora includes a [[Dracaena (plant)|dragon tree]] ''([[Dracaena ombet]])''. Due largely to political instability in the region over the last 30 years, many elements of the fauna and flora remain poorly known. As a suggestion of floral richness, an estimated 825 to 950 species have been observed in [[Djibouti]], although many of these have been found only in the small outlying patches of the [[Ethiopian montane forest]]. These outliers are part of the Day Forests and Mabla Massifs above 1,100 m in [[Djibouti]].

==Fauna==
Mammals found here include the last Somali Wild Ass ''([[Equus africanus somalicus]])'' to be found in the wild, on the [[Buri Peninsula]] of Eritrea. Other grazing animals include [[Beira (antelope)|Beira]], [[Dorcas gazelle]], [[Soemmerring's Gazelle]], [[gerenuk]] and the [[East African Oryx|Beisa oryx]]. The only purely endemic mammal is a gerbil ''[[Gerbillus acticola]]''. There are a number of dry habitat reptiles including the endemic [[gecko]]s, Arnold's leaf-toed gecko ''([[Hemidactylus]] arnoldi)'' and the Somali Northern Sand Gecko ''([[Tropiocolotes]] tripolitanus somalicus)''. Birds include the endemic Archer's lark ''([[Heteromirafra archeri]])''.

==Threats and preservation==
[[Human]] population density is typically less than ten persons per square kilometer (km2). In some areas, there is less than one person per km2. The dominant ethnic groups are the nomadic [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] [[Afar people|Afars]] and a Somali clan, the [[Issa (clan)|Issas]]. Human density, however, does not account for grazing animals. The conservation status of this ecoregion is not good, with few protected areas and lack of enforcement in existing ones. Habitats however have been degraded, mainly by grazing of livestock as well as cutting of trees for firewood and clearing of land for planting. The only protected area is the [[Mille-Serdo Wild Ass Reserve]] in Ethiopia although protection is planned for the Buri Peninsula and the Danakil Depression in Eritrea. Urban areas in the region include the ports of Massawa in Eritrea, [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti city]], and [[Berbera]] in Somalia. Smaller towns include the former [[Afar Region]] capital of [[Asaita]] in Ethiopia and smaller ports along the coast such as [[Tadjoura]] in Djibouti and [[Zeila]] in Somalia. Tourism in the region includes diving in the Dahlak islands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3443">An '''evergreen forest''' is a forest made up of [[evergreen]] trees. They occur across a wide range of climatic zones, and include trees such as [[Pinophyta|conifers]], [[live oak]], and [[holly]] in cold climates, [[eucalypt]]s, [[acacias]] and [[banksias]] in more temperate zones, and [[rainforest]] trees in tropical zones.

===Species of trees===
Coniferous temperate evergreen forests are most frequently dominated by species in the families [[Pinaceae]] and [[Cupressaceae]]. Broadleaf temperate evergreen forests include those in which [[Fagaceae]], such as [[oak]]s, are common, those in which [[Nothofagus|Nothofagaceae]] predominate, and the [[Eucalyptus]] forests of the Southern Hemisphere. There also are assorted temperate evergreen forests dominated by other families of trees, such as [[Lauraceae]] in [[laurel forest|Laurel Forest]].

==Regions==
[[Temperate]] [[evergreen]] forests, coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed, are found largely in the [[Temperateness|temperate]] [[Middle latitudes|mid-latitudes]] of [[North America]], [[Siberia]], Canada, Australia, [[Africa]], Scandinavia, Himalayas and western ghats of India. Broadleaf evergreen forests occur in particular in southern China, southeastern Brazil, parts of southeastern North America and the [[Pacific Northwest]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/204/4400/1380|work=Science Magazine|title=Evergreen Coniferous Forests of the Pacific Northwest
|date=June 29, 1979|accessdate=April 28, 2017|author=Waring, R.H. and J.F. Franklin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in countries around the [[Mediterranean Basin]], such as Lebanon and Morocco. Other examples include the wet temperate conifer forests of northwestern North America.

'''[[Tropical]] [[evergreen]] forests''' (or ''tropical rainforests'') are usually found in areas receiving more than 234&amp;nbsp;cm of rainfall and having a monthly mean temperature of 18&amp;nbsp;°C or higher in the coldest months. They occupy about seven percent of the Earth's surface and harbour more than half of the planet's terrestrial plants and animals. Tropical evergreen forests are dense, multi-layered, and harbour many types of plants and animals. These forests are found in the areas receiving heavy rainfall (more than 200&amp;nbsp; cm annual rainfall). They are very dense. Even the sunlight does not reach the ground. Numerous species of trees are found in these forests. Different types of trees shed their leaves at different times of the year. Therefore, these forests always appear green and are known as evergreen forests. These forests are found in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, along with the slopes of the Western Ghats and parts of Northeastern states of Assam, West Bengal and Odisha. These areas experience hot and humid climate with the short dry season. The important trees of these forests are rosewood, ebony and mahogany

The '''Fisher Bank''' is a sand bank in the [[North Sea]], off the west coast of [[Denmark]]. It consists of ''Great Fisher Bank'', and ''Little Fisher Bank'' (the latter closer to Danish coast). Some older charts refer to them as the "Great Fishing Bank" and the "Little Fishing Bank". As ''Fisher'' it gives its name to one of the sea areas in the British [[Shipping Forecast]].&lt;ref name=Collyer/&gt;

==Location==
Sea area Fisher is defined by the co-ordinates:
* 56°00'N 08°10'E
* 56°00'N 04°00'E
* 57°45'N 04°00'E
* 57°45'N 07°30'E
* 57°05'N 08°35'E

and the Danish coast.

==Character==
As its name suggests, these large sandbanks provide rich fishing grounds, but overfishing has left them less productive than they were, and many Danish fishing vessels have moved elsewhere, into the North Sea or the Baltic.&lt;ref name=Collyer&gt;{{cite book|author=Collyer, Peter|title=Rain Later, Good: Painting the Shipping Forecast |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KsOkAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 |year=2013 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-1-4081-5901-9 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Спомен плоча у Бојчинској шуми.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the forest in which partisan staffs and units in "partisan bases" were located from the summer of 1942 until the end of the war - [[dugout (shelter)|dug outs]] and watchtowers of the border troop of the [[First Srem Partisan Unit]]. Memorial plaque 4 July 1963 ]]

During the [[First World War]], residents and soldiers found shelter in the forest. King [[Alexander I Karadordevic|Alexander]] used it as a hunting ground (1934). During the [[Second World War]], Forest of Bojčin was a very important political, military and economic center.  In [[1941]], a partisan uprising was staged in the forest in Donji Srem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veliko druženje u slavnoj šumi|url=http://www.subnor.org.rs/dani-ustanka-i-borca-2#more-2202|website=SUBNOR|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; People from the surrounding villages also hid in the forest, fleeing from enemies - especially the [[Germans]] and the [[ustashas]]. In more than one base under the ground, which have been saved to date, many of the fighters from Central Serbia continued for east Bosnia during the remainder of the war, after crossing the Sava River and taking a short stop in order to recover and train, and then took part in heated battles against the enemy.
A tarmac road leads to the partisan bases through the middle of the forest. At a distance of 2&amp;nbsp;km from the entrance to the forest, on the site where the partisan bases where Srem army hid in the dugouts and catacombs once stood, there is a memorial set up in 1963. The place is a bit neglected and left to oblivion. In the continuation, the following 3&amp;nbsp;km, there is a pond and mud, and it is quite difficult to get through.
Due to its natural value, historical significance and monumental buildings with preserved properties, the Forest of Bojčin was protected as early as 1965 as a natural memorial monument.

=== National Liberation memorial characteristics ===
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Veliko druženje u slavnoj šumi|date=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the edge of the Forest of Bojčin, on the right side of the road for Progar, a monument in the form of a concrete pillar was erected on a pedestal of rough hewn stone of rectangular shape. On the right side of the pillar, a white marble plaque is built in with the text: "In the year 1942 the first battle in the southeastern Srem between partisans and ustashas took place in this forest. July 4, 1960, Alliance fighters of the NLW". Concrete memorial in the form of a rectangle is located in the Forest of Bojčin, 2&amp;nbsp;km from the forester's cottage, on the right side of the road for Ašanja. A white marble plaque is built in with the inscription: "Since 1942 to liberation, this part of the forest served as a permanent bivouac of partisan staffs and units and at the same time as winter stores of partisan bases and observation posts of the border troops of the First Srem Detachment. July 4, 1963. Association of veterans."

== Flora and fauna ==
[[File:Стаза кроз Бојчинску шуму.jpg|thumb|right|Through the Forest of Bojčin]]
The forest occupies an area of 629.51 ha. [[Red oak]] is particularly represented in its territory, as a fragment of the old, once enormous, lowland forest wetland. In the forest, there is a total of 185 recorded species, of which 15 have the status of protected and strictly protected species. One hundred and sixty-five (165) species of [[fungi]] grow in the forest, 15 of which with protection status, while two species are on the European Red List of mushrooms in Europe. Besides the oak, the forest is rich with [[hornbeam]] and [[Tilia|linden]], there are also [[Populus|poplar]], [[dogwood]], [[elderberry]] and [[List of Rosa species|wild rose]]. [[Wild garlic]] grows in one part of the forest, while in the spring there are a lot of [[wild strawberries]], in swampy areas there is [[iris (plant)|iris]], and very frequently [[fennel]].
One hundred and eight (108) species of birds were recorded in the forest, i.e. 30% of the total number of bird species recorded in Serbia. Also, there are 10 species of [[amphibians]] and [[reptiles]], of which as many as 8 species is protected by law. When it comes to animals which roam freely through the forest, [[rabbits]] and [[elk]] can be seen. Swineherds keep their pigs in the forest, and [[Sus (genus)|wild pigs]] that feed on [[acorn]]s can also be found. A large number of insects also lives there, of which the most notable are [[mosquitoes]], [[horseflies]] and [[hornets]].
The area is still relatively preserved, has great natural value, but it is in danger of further degradation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=: Studija o zaštiti Bojčinske i Lipovičke šume, kao i Forlanda leve obale Dunava|url=http://www.beograd.rs/index.php?lang=cir&amp;kat=beoinfo&amp;sub=1457289%3f|website=Grad Beograd|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its proximity to the urban zone, which is why it has been put under protection.

== Summer stage ==
[[File:Позориште Бојчинска шума.jpg|thumb|right|Summer Stage on the edge of the Forest of Bojčin near Progar]]
At the edge of the Forest of Bojčin, a summer theater was built in 2010, designed by architect Zdravko Milinković. The stage is covered with thick reeds, with a scenic diameter of 16 meters. Apart from the stage, there are two dressing rooms and a covered amphitheater auditorium for 1,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letnja pozornica Bojčinska šuma u Progaru|url=http://www.surcin.rs/index.php/projekti/139?status=complete&amp;page=4|website=Opština Surčin|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Directly behind the stage, an art colony was built in the same year, consisting of six wooden houses at a distance of about twenty meters. Each house has a room of 12 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, bathroom and a terrace of 10 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the space is air conditioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opština Surčin|url=http://www.surcin.rs/index.php/projekti/138?status=complete&amp;page=4|website=Umetnička kolonija}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Next to the stage, there is an ethno restaurant "Bojčinska koleba", a catering facility consisting of typical Srem houses for [[pigs]], covered with [[reed (plant)|reed]]s. Folds with [[mangalitsa]]s are located in the vicinity of the restaurant.

== Events ==
[[File:Споменик Бојчинска Шума.jpg|thumb|right|NLS Memorial in the Forest of Bojčin]]
* Although the new government in 2001 abolished fighter [[Veteran Day]] and [[Day of the Uprising of the People of Serbia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gligorijević|first1=Jovana|title=Zašto Srbija nema antifašistički praznik|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=999461|accessdate=24 May 2017|issue=br. 1070|publisher=Vreme|date =16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Forest of Bojčin, holidays are still celebrated traditionally, on [[4 July|4]] and [[7 July]], in the organization of the City Board of FAVNLW Belgrade and the Municipality of Rakovica, as the memory of the beginning of the [[antifascist]] battle. The Veterans’ Monument was transferred from Srem into the forest, which stood in front of the municipal building in the center of Surčin until July 2, 2012, during the past 55 years, sparking protests of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U Surčinu srušen spomenik partizanima|url=http://pe.org.rs/vesti/u-surcinu-srusen-spomenik-partizanima/|accessdate=24 May 2017|publisher=Centar za politike emancipacije|date=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this monument, at the entrance to the Forest of Bojčin, near the road for Progar, there is a [[monument to the first battle]]  between the partisans and the ustashas in southeastern Srem in the summer of 1942. The monument was erected in 1960.
* Bojčin Cultural Summer is a cultural and artistic festival held since 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bojčinsko leto|url=http://www.surcin.rs/index.php/bojcinsko-leto|website=Opština Surčin|accessdate=24 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904184109/http://www.surcin.rs/index.php/bojcinsko-leto|archivedate=4 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; every weekend, lasting for 5 months, from early May to late September.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is by the Congo River Basin, which covers an area of almost {{convert|1000000|km2}}. The country's only outlet to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] is a narrow strip of land on the north bank of the Congo River.

The vast, low-lying central area is a plateau-shaped basin sloping toward the west, covered by [[tropical rainforest]] and criss-crossed by rivers, a large area of this has been categorized by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as the [[Central Congolian lowland forests]] [[ecoregion]]. The forest center is surrounded by mountainous terraces in the west, plateaus merging into savannahs in the south and southwest. 

Dense grasslands extend beyond the Congo River in the north. High mountains of the [[Ruwenzori Range]] (some above {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are found on the eastern borders with [[Rwanda]] and [[Uganda]] (see [[Albertine Rift montane forests]] for a description of this area).

== Climate ==
[[File:Democratic Republic of the Congo map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Democratic Republic of the Congo map of Köppen climate classification.]]
The Democratic Republic of the Congo lies on the [[Equator]], with one-third of the country to the north and two-thirds to the south. The climate is hot and humid in the river basin and cool and dry in the southern highlands, with a cold, alpine climate in the [[Rwenzori Mountains]]. 

South of the Equator, the rainy season lasts from October to May and north of the Equator, from April to November. Along the Equator, rainfall is fairly regular throughout the year. During the wet season, thunderstorms often are violent but seldom last more than a few hours. The average rainfall for the entire country is about {{convert|1070|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

'''Dr. Harka Bahadur Gurung''' (1939–2006) was a Nepalese geographer, anthropologist, author, artist and politician, known for his conservation work.&lt;ref name=IPS&gt;{{cite web|last=Pradhan|first=Suman|title=Chopper Tragedy Blow to Nature Conservation|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/09/nepal-chopper-tragedy-blow-to-nature-conservation/|publisher=Inter Press Service|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNAS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dahal|first=Dilli R.|title=In Memory of Dr Harka Gurung|journal=Contributions to Nepalese Studies|date=January 2007|volume=31|issue=1|pages=1–10|url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/contributions/pdf/CNAS_34_01_01.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gurung was born in [[Lamjung District|Lamjung]] on 5 February 1939, in the village of Taranche. His father was an [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] in the British Army. After completing his secondary education at King George Military School, he studied for a B.A. and M.A. in Geography at [[Patna University]], and later received a PhD from [[Edinburgh University]] after being offered a scholarship there.&lt;ref name="CNAS"/&gt;

==Academic career==
After completing his PhD, Gurung worked as a Research Fellow at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] in London, returning to Nepal in 1966 to take up a lecturing post at [[Tribhuvan University]] in Kathmandu. In 1984 he was appointed Visiting Fellow at the [[East–West Center]] in Hawaii. A prolific scholarly author, Gurung published fifteen books and around 675 academic articles and reports.&lt;ref name="CNAS"/&gt; He also worked as an advisor to the [[World Wildlife Fund]] in Nepal.&lt;ref name="Thapa2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manjushree Thapa|title=A Boy from Siklis: The Life and Times of Chandra Gurung|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l4Qs8M5BOEIC&amp;pg=PA189|accessdate=12 March 2013|date=8 September 2009|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-306548-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
In 1968 Gurung was appointed Vice-Chairman of Nepal's National Planning Commission. He subsequently held several government posts, including Minister of State for Education, Trade and Industry Minister, and Minister of State for Tourism. He served as Director of the Asia and Pacific Development Centre from 1993–1998, and was a consultant for the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name="CNAS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nepal labours in the face of trade siege|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DKJUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hJADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6796,2678806&amp;dq=harka-gurung&amp;hl=en|accessdate=12 March 2013|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=11 April 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Gurung unfortunately died in 2006 along with 23 others in a [[2006 Shree Air Mil Mi-8 crash|helicopter crash]] at Ghunsa in [[Taplejung]], whilst returning from a conservation meeting.&lt;ref name="IPS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former city student dies in Nepal copter crash|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/former-city-student-dies-in-nepal-copter-crash-1-999924|accessdate=12 March 2013|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=26 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 Kathmandu International Mountain Film Festival was dedicated to his memory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Basnet|first=Rosha|title=Remote Lives at the 'KIMFF'|url=http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?no=334976&amp;rel_no=1|work=Oh My News|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lamjung F.C. created a memorial [[association football|football]] tournament in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lamjung FC to organize football tournament in memory of Dr Harka Gurung|url=http://www.nepalifootball.com/l-news/nehru-cup-2012/203-lamjung-fc-to-organize-football-tournament-in-memory-of-dr-harka-gurung.html|work=Nepali Football.com|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pokhara, a three-hectare eco-park (the Dr Harka, Chandra &amp; Migma Memorial Laligurans Eco Park) was set up to commemorate Harka and those who died with him in the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dhumpus to get an 'eco park'|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2369139171.html|work=The Kathmandu Post|publisher=HighBeam Research (subscription required)|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hillock''' or '''knoll''' is a small hill,&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hillock The Free Dictionary], "hillock" entry, retrieved December 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; usually separated from a larger group of [[hill]]s such as a [[Mountain range|range]]. Hillocks are similar in their distribution and size to small [[mesa]]s or [[butte]]s. The term is largely a British one.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} This particular formation occurs often in [[Great Britain]] and [[China]].{{clarify|date=April 2017}} A similar type of landform in the Scandinavian countries goes by the name ”kulle” or ”bakke” (depending on the country) and is contrary to the above phenomena formed when [[glacier]]s polish down hard, crystalline bedrock of [[gneiss]] or [[granite]]s, leaving a rounded rocky hillock with sparse vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gjessing|first1=L.|title=Norges landformer.|date=1978|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|isbn=82-00-01772-9|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous knolls is the one near [[John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy's]] point of assassination, the [[grassy knoll]].

A "blind knoll" is either hidden or not readily apparent to those driving vehicles. There are road signs that warn of this, advising drivers to slow down.

The '''history of Luzon''' covers events that happened in the largest island of the Philippine Archipelago, [[Luzon]]. Luzon wrested the record of having the oldest man ever discovered in the Philippines with discovery of the [[Callao Man]] in 2007, which predated the [[Tabon Man]] by around 20,000 years.&lt;ref name=morella&gt;Morella, Cecil. (August 3, 2010). [http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/callao-man-philippines.html 'Callao Man' Could Redraw Filipino History]. Agence France-Presse. Retrieved October 21, 2010 from Discovery News.&lt;/ref&gt; The written history of Luzon began in around 900 AD with the discovery of the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] in 1989. After that, Luzon began to appear in the annals of the Chinese and Japanese. One example would be the [[Ming Shilu]], wherein Luzon appeared in 22 records.&lt;ref name=wade&gt;{{cite web|last=Wade|first=Geoff|title=Southeast Asia in the Ming Shi-lu: an open access resource, Luzon search|url=http://epress.nus.edu.sg/msl/search/?q=Luzon&amp;b=Search|publisher=Asia Research Institute and the Singapore E-Press, National University of Singapore|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luzon was split among [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] kingdoms, Muslim principalities, and [[Philippine mythology|ethnoreligious]] tribes, who had trading connections with [[Borneo]], [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], [[Java]], [[Indochina]], [[India]], [[Ryukyu Islands|Okinawa]], [[Japan]] and [[China]] before the Spanish established their rule. As a result of the [[Spanish–American War]], Luzon became American territory. In the [[Second World War]], Luzon saw one of the fiercest battles during the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]]. Luzon, apart from being the largest island, had been the economic and political center of the Philippines ever since the country entered the Western Calendar, being home to the country's capital city, [[Manila]], and the country's largest [[metropolis]], [[Metro Manila]].

==Prehistory of Luzon==

The first evidence of the systematic use of Stone-Age technologies in the Philippines is estimated to have dated back to about 50,000 BC,&lt;ref name="Jocano 2001 108"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jocano|2001|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this phase in the development of proto-Philippine societies is considered to end with the rise of metal tools in about 500 BC, although stone tools continued to be used past that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jocano|2001|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new discoveries in Luzon, particularly in [[Rizal, Kalinga|Liwan, Kalinga]], found stone tools that were dated through potassium argon test at most 920,000 years old, and at least 750,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ocampo|first=Ambeth|title=Looking Back 6: Prehistoric Philippines|year=2012|publisher=Anvil Publishing, Inc.|location=Mandaluyong City, Philippines|isbn=978-971-27-2767-2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest human remains known in the Philippines are the fossilized remains discovered in 2007 by Armand Salvador Mijares in [[Callao Cave]], [[Peñablanca, Cagayan]]. The find was of a 67,000-year-old remains that predate the [[Tabon Man]], which was discovered in 1962 by [[Robert Bradford Fox]].&lt;ref name=Scott1984pp14-15&gt;{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|pp=14–15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the find consisted of a single 61 millimeter [[metatarsal]] which, when dated using [[Radiometric dating#Modern dating methods|uranium series ablation]], was found to be at least about 67,000 years old.&lt;ref name=morella/&gt; If definitively proven to be remains of [[Homo sapiens]], since there was a certainty that the Callao Man could be a [[Homo floresiensis]], it would antedate the 47,000-year-old remains of [[Tabon Man]] to become the earliest human remains known in the Philippines, and one of the oldest human remains in the Asia Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Severino, Howie G. (August 1, 2010). [http://www8.gmanews.tv/story/197541/researchers-discover-fossil-of-human-older-than-tabon-man Researchers discover fossil of human older than Tabon Man] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804040818/http://www.gmanews.tv/story/197541/researchers-discover-fossil-of-human-older-than-tabon-man |date=2010-08-04 }}.

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary theory surrounding the migration of Callao Man and his contemporaries to Luzon from what is believed to be the present-day Indonesia is that they came by raft. It is notable that the approximate time this happened is, according to experts, prior to the point when human beings were thought to be capable of making long voyages across the sea. It has also been noted that Callao Man could have crossed into the Philippines by a [[land bridge]]. This is because at the time Callao Man lived, it was the period known as [[Ice age]] and the [[sea level]] was lower. Because of lower sea levels, there could have been an [[Isthmus]] between the Philippines and the rest of [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20100702-278657/Callao-Man Callao Man] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723154949/http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20100702-278657/Callao-Man |date=2011-07-23 }}".

===Cultural and technological achievements in Luzon===
{{further|Cultural achievements of pre-colonial Philippines}}
Mining in the Philippines began around 1000 BC. However, the discovery of a [[brass]] needle in Musang Cave, Cagayan pushed back the date to 2160 BC, the date the needle was made.&lt;ref name=tan&gt;{{cite book|last=Tan|first=Samuel|title=A History of the Philippines|year=1987|publisher=University of the Philippines|location=Quezon City}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metal smiths from this era had already developed a crude version of modern metallurgical processes, notably the hardening of soft iron through [[carburization]].

===Laguna Copperplate Inscription===
{{main|Laguna Copperplate Inscription}}
[[File:Laguna Copperplate Inscription.gif|right|thumb|The Laguna Copperplate Inscription (circa AD 900) is inscribed with small writing hammered into its surface. It shows heavy [[Greater India|Indian cultural influence]] (by way of [[Srivijaya]]) present in the Philippines prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century.]]

The Laguna Copperplate Inscription is the earliest known written document found in the [[Philippines]]. The plate was found in 1989 by a sand labourer near the mouth of the Lumbang River in [[Barangay]] Wawa, [[Lumban, Laguna|Lumban]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]]. The inscription on the plate was first deciphered by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[anthropologist]] [[Antoon Postma]].&lt;ref&gt;(2010-05-07).

[http://www.bayangpinagpala.org/ "Laguna Copperplate Inscription: A New Interpretation Using Early Tagalog Dictionaries"]. Bayang Pinagpala. Retrieved on 2011-11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription is on a thin copper plate measuring less than 20 × 30&amp;nbsp;cm (8 × 12 inches) in size with words directly embossed onto the plate. It differs in manufacture from other Javanese scrolls of the period, which had the words inscribed onto a heated, softened scroll of metal.&lt;ref name="mts" /&gt;

Inscribed on it the [[Saka era]] date year of Saka 822, month of Waisaka, the fourth day of the waning moon, which corresponds to Monday, 21 April 900 AD in the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref name="bibingka" /&gt; The writing system used is the [[Old Kawi|Kawi Script]], while the language is a variety of [[Old Malay]], and contains numerous loanwords from [[Sanskrit]] and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is between [[Tagalog language|Old Tagalog]] and [[Old Javanese]].&lt;ref&gt;Postma, Antoon.

The Laguna Copperplate Inscription, among other recent finds such as the [[Golden Tara]] of [[Butuan]] and 14th century pottery and gold jewellery in [[Cebu]], is significant in revising [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|precolonial Philippine history]], which was until then considered by some Western historians to be culturally isolated from the rest of Asia, as no evident pre-Hispanic written records were found at the time. Noted Philippine historian [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]] debunked these theories in 1968 with his ''Prehispanic Source materials for the Study of Philippine History'' which was subsequently published in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Henry Scott |title=Prehispanic Source materials for the Study of Philippine History |isbn=971-10-0226-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Barangay government===
{{further|Ancient barangay}}
[[File:Naturales 4.png|thumb|[[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] royalty and his wife, wearing the distinctive color of his class (red), an illustration from the [[Boxer Codex]].]]

The barangay government emerged in around 200 AD, which owed the name from the Malay boat [[balangay]]. In more developed barangays in the [[Visayas]] (e.g. [[Cebu]], [[Bohol]], and [[Panay]]) which were the first to be conquered by Spain by means of pacts, peace treaties, and reciprocal alliances,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. William Henry Scott, ''Cracks in the Parchment Curtain'', Quezon City: 1998, p. 4. Also cf. Antonio Morga, Sucessos de las Islas Filipinas, 2nd ed., Paris: 1890, p. xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[datu]]'' was at the top of the social order in a ''sakop'' or ''haop'' (elsewhere referred to as ''[[barangay]]'').&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Scott, ''Cracks in the Parchment Curtain'', Quezon City: 1998, pp. 102 and 112&lt;/ref&gt; In Luzon, the social structure had been less stable and more complex as compared to the barangays in the Visayas. Enjoying a more extensive commerce than those in Visayas, having the influence of Bornean political contacts, and engaging in farming wet rice for a living, the Tagalogs, who had established the dominant pre-colonial barangays in Luzon, were described by the Spanish Augustinian friar [[Martin de Rada]] as more traders than warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. William Henry Scott, ''Cracks in the Parchment Curtain'', Quezon City: 1998, pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The more complex social structure of the Luzon barangays was less stable because it was still in a process of differentiating. A Jesuit priest Francisco Colin made an attempt to give an approximate comparison of it with the Visayan social structure in the middle of the 17th century. The term ''[[datu]]'' or ''[[lakan]]'', or ''apo'' refers to the chief, but the noble class to which the ''datu'' belonged to was known as the ''[[maginoo]]'' class. Any male member of the ''maginoo'' class can become a ''datu'' by personal achievement.&lt;ref name="Scott125"&gt;Cf. William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In circa 1595, the Spanish made a manuscript known as the [[Boxer Codex]] which contained illustrations of [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] during the early Spanish era. Aside from a description of, and historical allusions to the [[Philippines]] and various other Far Eastern countries, it also contains seventy-five colored drawings of the inhabitants of these regions and their distinctive costumes. At least fifteen illustrations deal with the natives of the Philippine Archipelago.&lt;ref name=roces1977p1003&gt;{{Harvnb|Roces|1977|p=1003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period between the 7th century to the beginning of the 15th century, numerous prosperous centers of trade had emerged, including the three city-states that formed in what is now [[Metro Manila]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huerta |first=Felix, de |authorlink=Felix Huerta |title=Estado Geografico, Topografico, Estadistico, Historico-Religioso de la Santa y Apostolica Provincia de San Gregorio Magno |publisher=Imprenta de M.

Pre-Hispanic burial grounds are found in many towns of Iloilo. These burial grounds contained antique porcelain burial jars and coffins made of hard wood, where the dead were put to rest with abundance of gold, crystal beads, Chinese potteries, and golden masks. These Philippine national treasures are sheltered in Museo de Iloilo and in the collections of many Ilonngo old families. Early Spanish colonizers took note of the ancient civilizations in Iloilo and their organized social structure ruled by nobilities. In the late 16th Century, Fray Gaspar de San Agustin in his chronicles about the ancient settlements in Panay says: ''"También fundó convento el Padre Fray Martin de Rada en Araut- que ahora se llama el convento de Dumangas- con la advocación de nuestro Padre San Agustín...Está fundado este pueblo casi a los fines del río de Halaur, que naciendo en unos altos montes en el centro de esta isla (Panay)...Es el pueblo muy hermoso, ameno y muy lleno de palmares de cocos. Antiguamente era el emporio y corte de la más lucida [[nobility|nobleza]] de toda aquella isla."'' Gaspar de San Agustin, O.S.A., ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas (1565-1615)'', Manuel Merino, O.S.A., ed., Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas: Madrid 1975, pp. 374–375.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Butuan]], the Kingdom of Luyag na Caboloan situated in [[Pangasinan]], the Kingdoms of [[Zabag kingdom|Zabag]] and Wak-Wak situated in [[Pampanga]] and [[Aparri]] (which specialized in trade with [[Japan]] and the [[Kingdom of Ryukyu]] in [[Okinawa]]).

In [[Zhao Rugua]]'s account, ''[[Zhu fan zhi]]'', Liu-sin (刘罪) was one of the islands in the country known as [[Ma-i]]. This is presumed to be Luzon (吕宋).&lt;ref name="chufanchi 172"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chau Ju-Kua: his work on the Chinese and Arab trade in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, entitled Chu-fanchi, page 172|url=http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CADAL/B31403797/|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traders from Ma-i (麻逸, present-day Mait in northern [[Mindoro]]) came to Canton as early as 971 during the [[Northern Song dynasty]] (960‒1127). Their activities received the attention of officials at the Chinese Bureau of Maritime Trade. The traders came again in 982. During the [[Southern Song dynasty]], officials at the Chinese Bureau of Maritime Trade in Fujian reported the arrival of more merchants from various Philippine islands: Ma-i, Baipuer 白蒲邇 (present-day Babuyan Islands), and Sandao 三嶋, which was known also as Sanyu 三嶼, a term that was used collectively to refer to the following three islands: Jamayan 加麻延 (present-day Calamian), Balaoyou 巴姥酉 (present-day [[Palawan]]),and Pulihuan 蒲裏喚 (perhaps Tuliahan River, near present-day [[Manila]]). Their trading activities, especially those by merchants from Sanyu, continued well into the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271‒1368).&lt;ref name=zhenping&gt;{{cite web|last=Zhenping|first=Wang|title=Reading Song-Ming Records on the Pre-colonial History of the Philippines|url=http://www.icis.kansai-u.ac.jp/data/journal01-v1/journal01-19-wang.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The country of Mai is to the north of [[Borneo]]. The [[natives]] live in large [[villages]] on the opposite banks of a stream and cover themselves with a cloth like a sheet or hide their bodies with a [[loin cloth]]. There are metal images (Buddhas) of unknown origin scattered about in the tangled wilds. Few [[pirates]] reach these shores. When trading ships enter the harbor, they stop in front of the official [[plaza]], for the official plaza is that country's place for barter and trade and once the ship is registered, they mix freely. Since the local officials make a habit of using white umbrellas, the merchants must present them as gifts.|&lt;ref&gt;"Prehispanic Source Materials: for the study of Philippine History" (Published by New Day Publishers, Copyright 1984) Written by William Henry Scott, Page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''ISO 3166-2:BB''' is the entry for [[Barbados]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Barbados, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[parishes of Barbados|11 parishes]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|BB}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Barbados. The second part is two digits (01&amp;ndash;11).

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

==Canada==
The French forts in Canada were located west from Alberta to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and as far north as [[James Bay]].  Built between the 1640s and the 1750s, a few were captured from rival [[British Empire|British]] fur trading companies like [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. The forts were located on waterways to provide transport of fur back east to [[Montreal]] or [[Quebec City]]. A few have survived or been re-built, but most are ruins or simply disappeared after abandonment.

|Modi visited Japan on a five-day official trip from 30 August to 3 September, which is labelled as his first bilateral state visit outside the [[South Asia|subcontinent]]. His 2014 visit further strengthened the ties between the two countries, and resulted in several key agreements, including the elevating of the already established strategic partnership to the "Special Strategic Global Partnership". During his visit, official negotiations on the sale of [[US 2]] amphibious aircraft for the Indian Navy and the long pending civil nuclear agreements have both progressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/indias-modi-maintains-warm-ties-with-japans-abe/article20336839/|title=India’s Modi maintains warm ties with Japan’s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe |author=Iain Marlow |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=3 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-09-02/news/53479980_1_shinzo-abe-strategic-global-partnership-japan |title=India, Japan sign key agreements; to share 'Special Strategic Global Partnership' |date=2 September 2014 |newspaper = Economic Times |author=Dipanjan Roy Chaudhury }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Modi delivered his maiden speech in the [[sixty-ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly]] on 27 September 2014, in which he called for the reform and expansion of the [[United Nations Security Council]], most notably bringing attention to India's long standing demand of a permanent membership. He expressed his concerns over the relevance of a 20th century setup in the 21st century, and stressed the need to evaluate the UN's performance in the past 70 years. He also questioned why the UN should serve as the G-All for global governance, instead of several parallel sub-groupings like the [[G7]] or [[G20]]. In the wake of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] threat in West Asia and other similar threats in other parts of the world, Modi urged for the immediate implementation of the 'Comprehensive on International Terrorism' by the UN and offered India's pro-active role in it, citing India as a victim of terrorism for decades. Prior to his speech, he, along with External Affairs Minister [[Sushma Swaraj]], met with UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]], to discuss issues relating to UN governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-modi-at-unga-lets-work-towards-a-sustainable-world-move-towards-g-all/articleshow/43642407.cms|title=PM Modi at UNGA: Let's work towards a sustainable world; move towards G-All|publisher=[[The Economic Times]]|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modi also ridiculed the possibility of any multilateral intervention on the issue of Kashmir, a demand [[Nawaz Sharif]] made in his address at the UNGA on 26 September, stating that the Indian government is ready for 'bilateral talk' with Pakistan provided that Pakistan cultivate a suitable environment for talks by giving up its terrorism policy against India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/cheat-sheet/prime-minister-narendra-modi-s-address-to-un-general-assembly-in-10-points-598833?pfrom=home-lateststories|title=Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Address to UN General Assembly in 10 Points|publisher=[[NDTV]]|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modi commented briefly on climate change and the use of clean energy. In this regard, he also asked world leaders and UN officials to recognise and observe '''Yoga Day''',  in order to emphasise the importance of incorporating [[Yoga]] into a modern-day lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-modi-asks-world-leaders-to-adopt-international-yoga-day/articleshow/43646752.cms|title=PM Modi asks world leaders to adopt International Yoga Day|publisher=[[The Economic Times]]|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modi also was known for fasting during a [[White House]] dinner for the Hindu festival of [[Navratri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2014/0929/What-s-a-White-House-dinner-without-dinner-Modi-and-Obama-will-find-out.-video |title=What's a White House dinner without dinner?

|-
| {{ListFlag|Tino Rangatiratanga Maori sovereignty movement flag.svg}} || 1990 || Flag of ''[[tino rangatiratanga]]'' – official Maori flag || A white curling stripe on a red and black field
|-
| {{ListFlag|NZ flag design Silver Fern (Red, White &amp; Blue) by Kyle Lockwood.svg}}&lt;br /&gt;  {{ListFlag|NZ flag design Silver Fern (Black, White &amp; Blue) by Kyle Lockwood.svg}}&lt;br /&gt;|| 2004 || [[Kyle Lockwood's flag]] – official alternative NZ flag (black white and blue version)|| The original design was a red, white and blue flag with a [[Silver Fern]] representing "the people of New Zealand". The blue colour represents the [[Pacific Ocean]], the red represents the [[Māori people]] and sacrifices made by all [[New Zealanders]] during wartime, white is a reference to [[Aotearoa]] the "Land of the Long White Cloud". The black white and blue version of the flag by [[Kyle Lockwood]] won the first of the [[New Zealand flag referendums, 2015–16]], and the red white and blue design was a close second. Black is one of the most well known [[National colours of New Zealand]], and represents the pride and strength of New Zealand.
|-
| {{ListFlag|Koru flag.svg}} || 1983 || [[Hundertwasser koru flag|Friedensreich Hundertwasser's koru flag]]|| A white flag with a green spiral (koru).
|-
| {{ListFlag|NZflag proposal-dignan.svg}} || 1998 || James Dignan's flag || Combines the red-white-blue and stars of the current flag (though with a brighter blue) and the bold diagonals of the [[Union Flag]] with the black-white-red of the flag of ''[[tino rangatiratanga]]'', and adds the silver fern. Promoted widely after a ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' article in 2002.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_1844158"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=1844158 |title=Let's fly a new flag with pride |date=9 May 2002 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |author=Dignan, James |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| {{ListFlag|Aaron Nicholson's New Zealand Flag.svg}} || 2000 || Aaron Nicholson’s flag || A modification of the current flag with the initials NZ to stylise the Union Flag and a long white cloud has made it to some a flag of compromise. This combination retains traditional links with the [[United Kingdom]] and New Zealand's [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] heritage. The NZ jack design is also reminiscent of the old 1974 Christchurch Commonwealth Games insignia. This design was displayed in newspapers around the country in 2005, and on an earlier TV debate with Angela De Audney.&lt;ref&gt;The Dominion, 5 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

She said that deleting the Union Flag from the New Zealand flag was a possibility if people wanted to redesign the flag, leaving it as a "rather attractive Southern Cross".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10627360|title=Clark backs Southern Cross for our flag|first=Audrey|last=Young|date=20 February 2010|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|- 
| {{ListFlag|Kibblesworthnewzealandflag.svg}} || 2009 || Proposed flag by Adam Kibbey || This flag includes the Union Flag, symbolising British links, and the [[national colours of New Zealand]], black and white, with the red from the cross of the Union Flag being extended to show the Maori colour of red. The southern cross is also prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3K-XAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA270&amp;lpg=PA270&amp;dq=Adam+Kibbey+flag&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-FItAhiZgF&amp;sig=MDr-eBnRFzQc4vhI5TTB7hfaTgk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m44fU5nxBMiRkQWm9oCoAw&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Adam%20Kibbey%20flag&amp;f=false|title=Life Changing: Learning from the past; fixing the future|first=Alasdair|last=Thompson|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| {{ListFlag|Koru Fern NZ Flag.jpg}} || 2015 || James Bowman's flag || The ''Koru Fern'' combines two iconic New Zealand symbols: the [[silver fern]] and the [[koru]].

|-
|{{ListFlag|New Zealand Flag - Land Of The Long White Cloud - Traditional Blue.png}}&lt;br /&gt;{{ListFlag|New Zealand Flag - Land Of The Long White Cloud - Ocean Blue.png}} || 2015 || Proposed New Zealand flag designs by Mike Archer || From the initial 10,300 proposed flag designs submitted to the [[Government of New Zealand|New Zealand Government]], these two were [[New Zealand flag referendums, 2015–16|selected by the Flag Consideration Panel]] and placed on a long list of 40, [publicly revealed on 10 August 2015]. The flag designs subtly reference ‘The Land Of The Long White Cloud’, the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] and the Pacific [[Ring of Fire]], with a nod to New Zealand’s [[Cyathea dealbata|silver fern]] and its geographic location within the world. The colour palette of the first flag, ([https://www.govt.nz/browse/engaging-with-government/the-nz-flag-your-chance-to-decide/gallery/design/18676 Land Of The Long White Cloud – Traditional Blue] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govt.nz/browse/engaging-with-government/the-nz-flag-your-chance-to-decide/gallery/design/18676|title=Land Of The Long White Cloud – Traditional Blue|publisher=[[New Zealand Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;), incorporates elements from the 1902 New Zealand flag and the National Māori flag – [[Tino rangatiratanga]]. The palette of the second flag, ([https://www.govt.nz/browse/engaging-with-government/the-nz-flag-your-chance-to-decide/gallery/design/30754 Land Of The Long White Cloud – Ocean Blue] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govt.nz/browse/engaging-with-government/the-nz-flag-your-chance-to-decide/gallery/design/30754|title=Land Of The Long White Cloud – Ocean Blue|publisher=[[New Zealand Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), has been reduced to reflect New Zealand’s strong connection with the ocean and environment – past, present and future.

The '''New Athos Cave''' ({{lang-ab|Афон Ҿыцтәи аҳаҧы}}; {{lang-ka|ახალი ათონის მღვიმე}}; {{lang-ru|Новоафонская Пещера}}) also '''Novoafonskaya''', '''Novy Afon Cave''', or '''New Afon Cave''' is a [[karst]] [[cave]] in the [[Iverian Mountain]] in [[Abkhazia]] ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]&lt;ref name=abnote/&gt;) near [[New Athos]]. It is one of the largest caves in the world with the volume of its void of about 1,000,000 m³.

==Overview==
The abyss on a slope of the Iverian Mountain was known for ages, referred to as the "Bottomless Pit". It was explored in 1961 by an expedition of four: [[Zurab Tintilozov]],&lt;ref&gt;In Georgian, ზურაბ ტინტილოზოვი&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arsen Okrojanashvili]],&lt;ref&gt;In Georgian, არსენ ოქროჯანაშვილი&lt;/ref&gt; Boris Gergedava,&lt;ref&gt;In Georgian, ბორის გერგედავა&lt;/ref&gt; and Givi Smyr.&lt;ref&gt;In Georgian, გივი სმირი&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1975, it has been a major tourist attraction, featuring [[New Athos Subway|its own underground railway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://metro-novyafon.narod.ru/sys-e.htm New Athos Cave Railway at metro-novyafon.narod.ru]&lt;/ref&gt; The cave consists of 9 major cavities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3017">The '''''Organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve Sénégal''''' (OMVS; in English '''Senegal River Basin Development Authority''') is an organisation grouping [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]] and [[Senegal]] for the purpose of jointly managing the [[Senegal River]] and its [[drainage basin]].

In 1963 a predecessor organization was established, the ''Organisation des Etats Riverians du Fleuve Sénégal'' (or the Senegal River Riparian States Organization), with the four border countries—Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal—to manage the [[Sénégal River drainage basin]] and the river itself. This organization dissolved when Guinea withdrew due to political tensions and the three remaining countries subsequently created the OMVS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Uhlir | editor-first=Paul F.  | year=2003 | title=Scientific Data for Decision Making Toward Sustainable Development: Senegal River Basin Case Study -- Summary of a Workshop (2003) | publisher=National Academies Press | place=Washington DC | isbn=0-309-08709-0 | url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10546&amp;page=6  }} &lt;/ref&gt; Guinea returned to the organisation in 2006.

The OMVS aims to promote ''self-sufficiency in'' food security, to improve the income of the local populations, and to preserve the natural ecosystems. The area has a total population of 35 million inhabitants, of whom 12 million live in the river basin, and where [[malaria]] control intervention coverage is among the lowest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://go.worldbank.org/ZYWU0HFL20 | title=Senegal River Basin: Multi-Purpose Water Resources Development Project | publisher=World Bank Group | accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OMVS has recently received a high score in a global comparison of indicators of Water Cooperation prepared by international think-tank [[Strategic Foresight Group]]. OMVS has a score of 91 in the Water Cooperation Quotient, which examines active cooperation by riparian countries in the management of water resources using 10 parameters, including legal, political, technical, environmental, economic and institutional aspects. The Quotient is calculated on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the best performance. High performance in the Water Cooperation Quotient also means low risk of war between countries in the concerned river basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Water Cooperation for a Secure World | publisher=Strategic Foresight Group | date=25 November 2013 | url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/inner-articles.php?id=310#.VKkI7HshHVI | accessdate=4 January 2015 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Israel]]''' &amp;ndash; country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. The '''State of Israel''' (''Medinat Yisrael'') came into existence as the [[homeland for the Jewish people]] at the [[Mandatory_Palestine#Termination_of_the_Mandate|termination of Mandatory British Palestine]] on 14 May 1948, through the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]]. This was followed by massive migration of Jews from both [[Bricha|Europe]] and the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|Muslim countries]] to Israel, and of [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Arabs]] from Israel, contributing to the extensive and still ongoing [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Declaration+of+Establishment+of+State+of+Israel.htm |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |title=Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel |date=14 May 1948 |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel's [[financial centre|financial capital]] and [[List of technology centers|technology center]] is [[Tel Aviv]]&lt;ref name="lboro.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web |title=GaWC&amp;nbsp;– The World According to GaWC 2008 |work=Globalization and World Cities Research Network |accessdate=1 March 2009 |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2008t.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the proclaimed capital is [[Jerusalem]], although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is [[Positions on Jerusalem|internationally unrecognized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=32762#.Vbpy5flVhBc|title=Jerusalem must be capital of both Israel and Palestine, Ban says|author=United Nations News Centre|work=UN News Centre|date=28 October 2009|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/basic10_eng.htm |title='&amp;#39;Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel'&amp;#39; |publisher=Knesset.gov.il |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About 43% of the [[Jewish population by country|world's Jews]] live in Israel today, the largest Jewish community in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=DellaPergola, Sergio |date=2015 |title=World Jewish Population, 2015 |url=http://www.jewishdatabank.org/Studies/downloadFile.cfm?FileID=3394 |publisher=Berman Jewish DataBank |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pokolistan''' is a [[fictional country]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. It is depicted as a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] state and was introduced during [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly's]] run on the [[Superman]] titles.

==History==
A former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] republic, Pokolistan was a [[military dictatorship]] ruled by [[General Zod]], supported by three metahumans [[Faora#Pokolistanian|Faora]], [[Ignition (comics)|Ignition]] and [[Kancer]]. While its citizens were not necessarily free, they were healthy, safe and prosperous. Much of the nation's prosperity was due to the usage of Kryptonian technology.
Consisting mainly of annexed land from [[Germany]], [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]], the country is roughly the size of Massachusetts. It also corresponds to exactly the same geographical location as the nation of [[Sonar (comics)|Modora]]. As yet, the exact details of how Pokolistan came to occupy the same space as Modora remain unknown. Pokolistan quickly became an orderly society under Zod's rule.

Since Zod's death in battle with Superman, neither Pokolistan nor Zod's team have been revisited in any DC titles.
==In other media==

===Film===
* Pokolistan is featured in the animated film ''[[Superman vs. The Elite]]''. Rising tensions between Pokolistan and [[Bialya]] lead to Superman and [[The Elite (DC Comics)|the Elite]] getting involved, with the conflict only ending once the leaders of both nations are assassinated by [[Manchester Black]].

'''Railroad ecology''' is a term used to refer to the study of the ecological community growing along railroad or [[Rail transport|railway]] tracks and the effects of railroads on [[Ecosystem|natural ecosystems]]. Such ecosystems have been studied primarily in Europe. Similar conditions and effects appear also by roads used by vehicles. Railroads along with roads, canals, and power lines are examples of [[linear infrastructure intrusions]].

==Conditions==

Railroad beds, like road beds, are designed to drain water away from the tracks, so there is usually a bed of rock and gravel resulting in fast drainage away from the tracks.  At the same time, this drainage often accumulates in areas fairly near the tracks where drainage is poor, forming small artificial wetlands.  These unnatural conditions combine to form different zones, some in which water is scarce, others in which water is abundant.

==Maintenance==

Railroad companies routinely clear-cut and/or spray with herbicide any vegetation that grows too close to the tracks.  This favors vegetation that is able to respond favorably to clearcutting, and/or resist herbicides.

On overhead [[railway electrification system|electrified railroad]] lines, clear-cutting must be more extensive, vertically as well as horizontally, in order to prevent vegetation (especially tree limbs) from interfering with the [[Pantograph (rail)|pantographs]] on a moving train, breaking off and falling on the wires, or simply from [[electric arc|arcing]] in proximity to high voltage transmission cables. The same vegetative selection processes described in the previous paragraph apply, but may additionally favor climbing vines due to the presence of catenary and transmission poles in addition to the wooden communications and signal [[utility pole|pole lines]] which often exist(ed) along nonelectrified lines.

==History==

Historically, conditions along railroad beds were very different from today. Coal engines used to blanket the area with soot, favoring species adapted to these conditions (some of which only occurred naturally in volcanic areas). Newer engines produced a less remarkable environment, but many of the same plants have remained and adapted to this new environment.

==Ecological effects==

=== Invasive Species ===
Railway tracks (like roads and highways) are often colonized by non-native invasive species.  In North America, such species include trees such as [[Ailanthus altissima]], [[Paulownia tomentosa]], [[Siberian Elm]], and [[Norway Maple]], and invasive non-woody plants such as [[Japanese Knotweed]] and [[Phragmites]].  The railway tracks provide corridors along which these species can spread and thrive, even when the surrounding areas might be less hospitable to them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14289">'''Regenerative design''' is a process-oriented [[Systems theory|whole systems]] approach to [[Design thinking|design]]. The term "regenerative" describes processes that restore, renew or revitalize their own sources of energy and materials. Regenerative design uses whole systems thinking to create [[Ecological resilience|resilient]] and equitable systems that integrate the needs of [[society]] with the integrity of nature. 

Designers use [[Systems theory|systems thinking]], applied [[Permaculture|permaculture design]] principles, and [[community development]] processes to design human and [[ecological]] systems. The development of regenerative design has been influenced by approaches found in the [[biomimicry]], [[biophilic design]], [[Ecological economics|ecological economics,]] [[Circular economy|circular economics]]. As well as [[Social movement|social movements]] such as permaculture, [[Transition town|transition]] and the [[new economy]]. Regenerative design can also refer to process of designing systems such as [[restorative justice]], [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] and [[regenerative agriculture]].
[[File:Feedback loop.png|thumb|Feedback loop used in regenerative design]]
A new generation of designers are applying ecologically inspired design to [[agriculture]], architecture, [[community planning]], [[Sustainable urban planning|cities]], [[wikt:enterprise|enterprise]]s, [[economics]] and [[Systems ecology|ecosystem regeneration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/designing-regenerative-cultures|title=Permaculture magazine|date=2016-06-18|work=Permaculture magazine|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many designers use the resilient models observed in [[systems ecology]] in their design process and recognize that [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] are [[Ecological resilience|resilient]] largely because they operate in [[closed ecological system|closed loop systems.]] Using this model regenerative design seeks feedback at every stage of the design process. [[Feedback]] loops are an integral to regenerative systems as understood by processes used in [[Restorative practices|restorative practice]] and [[community development]].

Regenerative design is interconnected with the approaches of systems thinking and with [[New Economy Coalition#New Economy movement|New Economy movement]]. The 'new economy' considers that the current economic system needs to be restructured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diebold|first=William|last2=Alperovitz|first2=Gar|last3=Faux|first3=Jeff|date=1984|title=Rebuilding America: A Blueprint for the New Economy|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/20042109|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=63|issue=1|pages=190|doi=10.2307/20042109|issn=0015-7120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is based on the assumption that people and the planet should come first, and that it is human well-being, not economic growth, which should be prioritized. 

Whereas the highest aim of [[sustainable development]] is to satisfy [[fundamental human needs]] today without compromising the possibility of future generations to satisfy theirs, the goal of regenerative design is to develop restorative systems that are dynamic and emergent, and are beneficial for humans and other species. This regeneration process is participatory, iterative and individual to the community and environment it is applied to. This process intends to revitalize communities, human and natural resources, and for some, society as a whole. 

In recent years regenerative design is made possible on a larger scale using open source socio- technicle platforms and technological systems as used in [[Smart city|SMART cities]]. It is an includes community and city development processes like gathering [[feedback]], [[Participatory democracy|participatory governance]], [[sortition]] and [[participatory budgeting]].

== History ==
During the late 1970s, [[John T. Lyle]] (1934–1998), a [[landscape architecture]] professor, challenged graduate students to envision a community in which daily activities were based on the value of living within the limits of available [[Renewable resource|renewable resources]] without [[environmental degradation]]. Over the next few decades an eclectic group of students, professors and experts from around the world and crossing many disciplines developed designs for an institute to be built at [[Cal Poly Pomona]]. In 1992 the [[Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies]] was built over two years and opened in 1994. In that same year Lyle's book ''Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development'' was published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]]. In 1995 Lyle worked with [[William McDonough]] at [[Oberlin College]] for the [[Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies]] completed in 2000. In 2002 McDonough's book, the more popular and successful, ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]'' was published reiterating the concepts developed by Lyle.

Lyle saw the connection between concepts developed by [[Robert Rodale|Bob Rodale]] of the [[Rodale Institute]] for [[regenerative agriculture]] and the opportunity to develop regenerative systems for all other aspects of the world. While regenerative agriculture focused solely on agriculture, Lyle expanded its concepts and use to all systems. With regenerative agriculture, the concepts are very straight forward and simple but Lyle understood that when developing for other types of systems, more complicated ideas such as [[entropy]] and [[embodied energy|emergy]] must be taken into consideration.

Swiss architect [[Walter R. Stahel]] developed approaches entirely similar to Lyle's also in the late 1970s but instead coined the term [[cradle-to-cradle design]] made popular by McDonough and [[Michael Braungart]]

Whilst in 1974 [[David Holmgren]] and [[Bill Mollison]] first started working together to develop the theory and practice of [[permaculture]]. They met when Mollison spoke at a seminar at the Department of Environmental Design and began to work together. During their first three years together Mollison worked at applying their ideas, and Holmgren wrote the manuscript for what would become ''Permaculture One: a perennial agricultural system for human settlements'' as he completed his Environmental Design studies, and submitted it as the major reference for his thesis. He then handed the manuscript to Mollison for editing and additions, before it was published in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dargavel|first=John|last2=Mulligan|first2=Martin|last3=Hill|first3=Stuart|date=July 2003|title=Ecological Pioneers: A Social History of Australian Ecological Thought and Action|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3986208|journal=Environmental History|volume=8|issue=3|pages=481|doi=10.2307/3986208|issn=1084-5453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term permaculture was developed and coined by [[David Holmgren]], then a graduate student at the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education's Department of Environmental Design, and [[Bill Mollison]], senior lecturer in Environmental Psychology at University of Tasmania, in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Permaculture One|last=Holmgren and Mollison|first=|publisher=Transworld Publishers|year=1978|isbn=0552980757|location=|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''permaculture'' originally referred to "permanent agriculture",{{Sfn|King|1911}}&lt;ref&gt;Paull , John (2011) [https://www.academia.edu/9148622/The_making_of_an_agricultural_classic_Farmers_of_Forty_Centuries_or_Permanent_Agriculture_in_China_Korea_and_Japan_1911-2011 The making of an agricultural classic: Farmers of Forty Centuries or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan, 1911-2011], Agricultural Sciences, 2 (3), pp. 175-180.&lt;/ref&gt; but was expanded to stand also for "permanent culture", as it was understood that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system as inspired by [[Masanobu Fukuoka]]’s [[natural farming]] philosophy. Regenerative design is integral to permaculture design.

== Regenerative versus sustainable ==
[[regeneration (ecology)|Regenerative]] and [[sustainable]] are essentially the same thing except for one key point: in a sustainable system, lost [[ecological system]]s are not returned to existence. In a regenerative system, those lost systems can ultimately begin "regenerating" back into existence. Put more simply regenerative systems work using regenerative feedback loops that allows for [[adaptability]], dynamism and [[emergence]] to create and develop resilient systems than the idea that we need to a sustain the world the way we (humans) found it, now and into the future.

There is also a linguistic problem with the word "sustainable", which in the strict sense is meant to mean "[[self-sustaining]]". Because the word root "sustain" means "last" or "endure," the general public and even many non-experts in the industry define the word only as "able to last" or "the capacity to endure." In popular usage by designers and product manufacturers, "sustainable" has become a relative term referring to any material, process or product (including a building) which is less toxic or environmental harmful than those conventionally used.  A product that contains 75% [[recycled]] material is often considered "sustainable", but is in fact merely MORE sustainable than a comparable product that contains no recycled material.  A truly sustainable material would be one made of 100% recycled material that can, in turn, be completely recycled into a comparable new material or product.  This is rarely the case.

"Regenerative" also suffers from a slightly different linguistic problem, the term is still competing with the biological community in terms of its use for the [[regeneration (biology)|re-growth]] of limbs etc.. However once the word itself gains wide usage, its meaning becomes more general, much like in the case of the term "sustainable". The base meaning of "re-generative" means the "capacity to bring into existence again." So if an item or system is regenerative the item or system has the capacity to bring itself into existence again. Using the example above, a truly regenerative product would not only be 100% recycled and recyclable, but it would also improve the environmental conditions at the factory where it was made, the business where it was used and so on throughout its life-cycle (creating habitat, filtering water, catalyzing [[nitrogen-fixation]] processes in the soil, etc.).

== Preservation versus conservation ==
Regenerative design places more importance on conservation and biodiversity rather than on preservation. It is recognized in regenerative design that humans are a part of natural ecosystems. To exclude people is to create dense areas that destroy pockets of existing ecosystems while preserving pockets of ecosystems without allowing them to change naturally over time. By incorporating people into ecosystems all inputs are pulled from local areas and all outputs are accounted for creating a waste-less system. 

== Food systems and business ==
Regenerative farming or '[[regenerative agriculture]]' calls for the creation of demand on agricultural systems to produce food in a way that is beneficial to the production and the ecology of the environment. It uses the [[science]] of [[systems ecology]], and the design and application through [[permaculture]]. As understanding of its benefits to human biology and ecological systems that sustain us is increased as has the demand for [[organic food]]. Organic food grown using regenerative and permaculture design increases the [[biodiversity]] and is used to develop business models that regenerate communities. Whereas some foods are organic some are not strictly regenerative because it is not clearly seeking to maximize biodiversity and the resilience of the environment and the workforce. Regenerative agriculture grows organic produce through [[Corporate social responsibility|ethical supply chains]], [[zero waste]] policies, [[Living wage|fair wages]], [[staff development]] and [[Wellbeing at Work conference|wellbeing]], and in some cases [[cooperative]] and [[social enterprise]] models. It seeks to benefit the staff along the [[supply chain]], customers, and ecosystems with the outcome of human and [[Restoration ecology|ecological restoration]] and regeneration.

== Size of regenerative systems ==
The size of the regenerative system effects the [[complexity]] of the design process. The smaller a [[system]] is designed the more likely it is to be resilient and regenerative. Multiple small regenerative systems that are put together to create larger regenerative systems help to create supplies for multiple human-inclusive-ecological systems.

'''San Jose Ojos de Agua''' is a municipality is located in the department of [[Chalatenango Department|Chalatenango]] in the North of [[El Salvador]]

==The Municipality==
Ojos de Agua is a municipality in the Department of Chalatenango, El Salvador.  It is bordered to the north by [[Honduras]]; to the east by Honduras and [[Nueva Trinidad]]; to the south by [[Las Flores, El Salvador|Las Flores]] and [[Las Vueltas]]; and to the west by [[Concepción Quezaltepeque]] and [[El Carrizal]].  The territorial extension of the municipality is 34.12&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  In 2005 the population of the municipality was 3,579 inhabitants.  For its administration, the municipality is divided into seven cantones and 19 caserios.

===History of Ojos de Agua===
The civilization of El Salvador dates from the Pre-Columbian Era, from around 1500 BC, according to experts (Embajada).  On May 31, 1522, the first of the [[Spain|Spanish]], under the leadership of Captain [[Pedro de Alvarado]], disembarked on the Isla Meanguera, located in the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] (Embajada). In June 1524 Captain Alvarado began a war of conquest against the indigenous people of Cuzcatlán (land of precious things). After 17 days of bloody battles many people died but the Spanish were not defeated, so they continued their conquest (Embajada). During the following centuries the Spanish maintained their control, with European families controlling the land and the native and African slaves (Lonely Planet). Towards the end of 1810 the Priest [[José Matías Delgado]], with the support of many people, began a rebellion (Embajada).  After years of struggle, the [[History of Central America#Independence|Central American Independence Act]] was signed in [[Guatemala]], on September 15, 1821 (Embajada).

By law, on February 18, 1841, the populations of Las Vueltas, Ojos de Agua and La Ceiba formed one electoral area.  The village of Ojos de Agua was designated as a formal town in 1867, although in 1855 the Presbyterian doctor Isidro Méndez declared it to be a town of the department of Chalatenango.  From May 12, 1902 until April 23, 1906, Ojos de Agua annexed the cantón El Zapotal, along with El Coyolar and Yurique, segregating them from the municipality of Las Vueltas.  The canton El Portillo was also segregated from the municipality of El Carrizal.  (Chalatenango Monografía del departamento y sus municipios. Instituto Geográfico Nacional Ingeniero Pablo Arnoldo Guzmán Centro Nacional de Registro. 1995.)

Due to the repression of the landowners, in 1931 farmers and indigenous citizens began a rebellion (Lonely Planet).  The army responded by killing 30,000 people, including the leader of the rebellion, Farabundo Martí, in a bloody act that was later referred to as La Matanza (The Massacre) (Lonely Planet).  But the people remained unhappy with the government.  This began a movement organized around leftist guerrillas to combat the repression violence (Stahler-Sholk, 1994:2).  The government responded with violence, and the Death Squads were formed, which eventually tortured and killed thousands of people (Foley 2006).  More political instability and the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero in 1980 sparked the beginning of the Civil War (Lonely Planet).  This war, which lasted 12 years, resulted in the death of an estimated 75,000 people and the displacement of thousands more (Stahler-Sholk, 1994:3).  The Peace Accords were signed on January 16, 1992 (Embajada).

The department of Chalatenango was heavily impacted by the Civil War.  Many people of Ojos de Agua were forced to abandon their homes because of the violence.  But beginning the early 1990s, and especially after the Peace Accords, the people have returned to repopulate the municipality.

===Observation of the administrative political division===
According to the inhabitants, the caseríos that compose canton Coyolar are now uninhabited.  The El caserío El Sitio in cantón El Portillo is known as Tierra Blanca (White Earth).  The caseío El Copinol in El Zapotal is uninhabited, as are all of the caseríos in cantón Yurique.

===Historia de Cantones y Caseríos===
According to the populace, the caseríos that compose canton Coyolar are uninhabited.  In cantón El Zapotal the caserío El Copinol is uninhabited, as are all the caseríos that compose cantón Yurique.  

According to the inhabitants, the municipality Ojos de Agua is named after the abundance of water sources in the area.  Los Sitios was so named because people used to stay there (“sitiaban”--“they surrounded”) temporarily while taking care of their animals in the area.

El Coyolar was named by the people because the men there were very “macho” (or coyoludos).

==Politics==
There are two main political parties in El Salvador, whose roots lie in the Civil War (Foley 2006, Stahler-Sholk 1994).  The main right-wing party is La Alianza Republicana Nacionalista (Nactionalist Republican Alliance—ARENA), founded on September 30, 1981, and was in power during the last few wars of the Civil War (ARENA 2007).  The Frente Farabundo Marti para La Liberacion Nacional (Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front—FMLN)
the socialist party, is the direct descendent of the guerrilla troops that fought against the Salvadoran government, and was legally constituted as a political party on September 1, 1992 (Stahler-Sholk 1994:3).  Since the Civil War the two have remained the country’s principal political parties, still divided by the left-right binary.  Today ARENA describes itself as a party in whose “forming principals express that a democratic and representational system, which guarantees the freedom of action and the consequences of individual peaceful goals, are the quickest and stablest path to achieve integral development of the nation” (ARENA 2007). The FMLN “has begun to take steps…to act as a consequence of the historically created challenges,  in order to make the party an organization of ‘social fighters…’and ‘to unify more’ the struggle for power (Comisión Nacional de Educación Política 2002).  Other political parties in El Salvador include The Christian Democratic Party, The United Democratic Center, and The Party of National Conciliation.

The mayor of Ojos de Agua is Prof. José Raúl Chinchilla Mejía, of the ARENA party.

==Religion==
83% of the population of El Salvador identifies as Roman Catholic, and the other 17% identify as “other” (CIA World Factbook).  But in the last few years the population of Catholicism has been reduced (USBDHRL).  There is a lot of Protestant activity in the country, and El Salvador has one of the highest rates of Protestantism in Latin America (Soltero y Saravia 2003:1).  There is no doubt that religion plays an important role in the lives of many people.  Patron-saint and other religious festivals are still very important and celebrated in almost all of the municipalities in the country, and almost all the cantones have their own patron-saint in whose honor the festival is celebrated.

==Patron-Saint and Other Traditional Festivals==
*Urban center: March 16–19, in honor of St. Joseph; July 16, in honor of the Virgin del Carmen; October 28, in honor of St. Judas Tadeo
*Coyolar: August 14–15, in honor of the Virgin de la Asunción (El Transito)
*El Portillo: July 27, in honor of the Virgin del Perpetuo Socorro
*El Sitio: May 3, in honor of the Holy Cross
*El Tablón: May 15, in honor of St. Isidro Labrador; March 6, in honor of St. Anthony
*El Zapotal: October 14–15, in honor of Jesús del Rescate
*La Montoñita: May 3, in honor of the Holy Cross and St. Anthony

==Music and Dance==
The popular music used to be ranchera and some boleros.  Some commonly played instruments were violin, guitar and marimba.  Sometimes people made instruments with their own hands, such as flutes made with the stems of papaya-tree leaves and bamboo twigs.  Some people also made music with leaves from orange trees and coffee plants.  Serenades were also frequent.  Most of this music is no longer heard.

One of the traditional dances was called “La Raspa;” people also danced to ranchera music.

==Agricultural Production==
The production that has historically characterized the municipality is that of corn, beans, sorghum (maicillo), rice, and vegetables.  They also produce indigo, and one can still find the remains of the equipment used to manufacture the indigo although it is no longer in use.  The plant was crushed with water and then placed into a bottle, then the ink was prepared.  They also grow hibiscus flowers.

==Food and Drink==
Traditional foods include beans, tortillas, metas, soups, sweets, and seeds.  Other traditional foods and dishes include:

*During the corn harvest people make different types of tamales, atole (a corn and milk-based drink), and corn on the cob.
*There are many different types of types, such as sweet and savory, that can be made with different fillings, like meats and
vegetables, mainly potatoes. Pisques are big tamales that are made for people going on trips, so that they can carry them along.
*Another typical dish is the balls of corn dough that are added to bean soup.
*In this area people make candies and conserves out of various fruits.
*Bean soup with young tender mango.
*Mogo is a dish prepared out of tender bananas, which are ground and fried with sugar or salt.
*Seeds of local plants, such as “paterna” and “pan.”

The majority of the ingredients used to make these foods and drinks are natural and are grown in the area.  They also form part of the biodiversity that, in some cases, is threatened or in danger of extinction.  Nevertheless, these habits are less common as more people eat commercially produced foods.

==Tourist Sites==
*The natural pool of La Piedra Larga, located in Sumpul River, is a popular bathing place
*El Tablón is a beautiful place, surrounded by mountains and with a nice climate
*The following hills: El Tule, El Zarzal and El Cebollal, are actually part of the same geographic formation and can be found in front of the urban center of Ojos de Agua.
*The natural pool Rumbadota
*The natural pool Coponte

==Artisan Products==
*Historically, in the municipality people made pots, tortillas pans, yellow scented candles from vegetable wax, balls of string, hammocks, mortars and pestles, lead-tipped fishing nets, woven mats, and sugar cane mills.
*They also know how to make an alcoholic beverage known as “chaparro.”  This is now made clandestinely because it is illegal, although it is part of the cultural heritage of different villages.   It is used as a cure for hangovers and anemia, because it revitalizes people since it is a highly potent drink.

==Archeological Sites==
*In El Tablón there are stones with drawings
*In El Cerro Vivo there are stones with drawings and house foundations near the clinic.  In the house of Don Maximiliano Ayala there are stones with letters
*In Piedra Larga there are pieces of pottery
*In El Cebollal, La Montañona, and the zone of Naranjito there are obsidian and sparkling stones called “piedra centella.”

'''Sharq El Owainat''' is located in the [[New Valley Governorate]] of [[Egypt]]. It is in the south-west of the country, between the [[Nile]] and [[Libya]].

Along with [[Toshka]], Sharq El Owainat forms part of the larger [[New Valley Project]] which consists of building a system of canals to transport water from [[Lake Nasser]] to irrigate the Western Desert of [[Egypt]].

The Sharq El Owainat project is part of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's election programme over the past decade and was inaugurated in 2001. It was introduced as the hope for future generations to escape the crowded and limited valley of the [[River Nile]] and establish new communities in the western desert. The project aims to attract investors to cultivate an eventual 240,000 [[feddans]] by 2017.

The initial phase of the project resulted in 27,000 [[feddans]] of barren desert land was converted to [[fertility (soil)|fertile]] land. There are about 400 water [[Water well|wells]] in the area with a further 250 under construction. There is also a nursery that includes 26 [[greenhouses]].

Different [[agricultural]] ventures are being carried out, many of the high yield produce of the area are meant for exportation (mainly to [[Europe]]).

The area has its own hospital, police station, telephone lines and television transmission. A [[power plant]] is current under construction in addition to a [[livestock]] slaughter house and meat processing unit.

In August 2009, the UAE-based agricultural company, Janan, agreed a contract to cultivate 100,000 [[feddans]] (about 42,000 [[hectares]]) of land with wheat, corn and feed. This contract also included signing an agreement with the national [[airline]] of Egypt, [[EgyptAir Express]] (''subsidiary of [[EgyptAir]]''), to operate a weekly flight from [[Cairo International Airport]] to [[Sharq El Owainat Airport]] in order to serve the movement of workers and investors to encourage agricultural investment in the region. The flights began 1 November 2009 for an initial 1-year period.

This proposal, from a platform created in 2011, was shown to map the electoral results of the Catalan regional election of 21 December 2017, which provoked renewed interest. The word 'Tabarnia' went viral on 26 December 2017, reaching worldwide top-trending status with over 648,000 mentions. The first major demonstration organized by the Tabarnia movement took place in Barcelona on 4 March 2018, with 15,000 participants according to the Guarda Urbana and 200,000 according to organizers.&lt;ref&gt;https://elpais.com/ccaa/2018/03/04/catalunya/1520162880_273146.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of Tabarnia wish to distance themselves from the Catalan separatist movement and reclaim the right of a number of territories near the area of Barcelona and Tarragona to constitute themselves as an autonomous community within Spain. In the [[Catalan regional election, 2015|2015]] and [[Catalan regional election, 2017|2017]] Catalan regional elections, parties opposed to secession (mainly [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Citizens]], [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia|PSC]] and [[People's Party of Catalonia|PP]]) received a [[Majority#Majority vote|majority]] of votes and seats in Tabarnia as a whole and in a small number of coastal ''comarques'' (Tarragonès, Baix Penedès and Baix Llobregat) including the city of Tarragona. They received a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in the comarca of [[Barcelonès]], yet not in the city of [[Barcelona]] itself. They allude to a series of fiscal arguments similar to those of Catalan separatism in regards to Spain. The term "Tabarnia" is a [[neologism]] based on the names of [[Province of Tarragona|Tarragona]] and [[Province of Barcelona|Barcelona]], the two Catalan provinces where support for separatism is lower,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Political claims ==
Tabarnians claim vote representation in Catalonia to be unfair across the four different provinces Lleida, Girona, Tarragona and Barcelona, resulting in unfair economic investment. Under the current electoral law, in the province of Barcelona 48,521 votes are needed to elect one representative in the Catalan Parlament for the 20,915 votes needed in Lleida, resulting in a 2.3 ratio. Tarragona requires 31,317 votes and Girona 30,048. Catalan separatists argue the current electoral law ensures political representation for areas with a lower population density while tabarnians argue the law has not been revised because historically Lleida and Girona have always had a majority of voters in favor of the separatist political parties that have kept them in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The same way Catalan separatist have used an interpretation of economic data to argue they have an unfavourable finance balance towards the rest of Spain, Tabarnians argue Tarragona and Barcelona underrepresentation in the Catalan Parlament has resulted in unfavourable finance balance towards their region, also backed by similar interpretation of economic data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Tabarnia Movement is still in its early days and is too soon to know how their political claims will unfold. Some Tabarnians simply believe this movement to be a satirical response that mirrors separatist with their own logic. Some Tabarnians demand that, in case a hypothetycal referendum for Catalonia independence was held, the seven different veguerias ([[Vegueria]]) be decided separately, so "Tarragona" and "Àmbit metropolità" are not declared independent against their democratic will. Some Tabarnians have grown so tired of the Catalan separatist movement, that they seem committed to celebrating a referendum in October 2018 to split from Catalonia as a Spanish autonomous region whether the previous referendum takes place or not. Some Tabarnians want to be declared a new autonomous region, which they argue is legally plausible under the present [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

By proposing the hypothetical separation of Tabarnia from Catalonia, the founders of the Tabarnia project want for the separatist politicians to realize that a large proportion of Catalans consider themselves Spanish and do no not want to leave Spain and that a declaration of independence could trigger similar movements within the territory, to the point of absurdity. According to Manuel Muñiz, the dean of the school of international relations at IE University in Madrid, it sparked a debate over "who is to vote and when" in a democracy and he questioned whether regions should be the ones entitled to decide on their independence or if cities would also qualify? Or should it be neighborhoods within cities?&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

According to Salvador Garcia Ruiz, the chief executive of [[Ara (newspaper)|''Ara'']], a Catalan pro-independence newspaper, Tabarnia is nothing more than a sour response to the results of the [[Catalan regional election, 2017]] in which the independentists did not lose their majority over the parliament. He labeled Tabarnia as [[Peter Pan]]'s "Neverland" for the unionists. Podemos' leader [[Pablo Iglesias Turrión|Pablo Iglesias]] was also critical with the movement because he claimed it was fueling an unhelpful "war of flags" but the spokesman for Tabarnia claims that the goal was never to break up Catalonia, but rather ending Catalan secessionism and all its disruptive consequences.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

'''Tal-Ħandaq''' is an area in [[Qormi]], [[Malta]]. It is a low hill. Situated on the left side of Mdina Road in Qormi, in the old days it was a rural area, with a few farms. In the 19th century, the British established a barracks up the hill.  Between January 1947 and July 1978 Tal-Ħandaq was the site of the [[Royal Naval School Tal-Handaq]].  The site re-opened as a new school in September 1981 as the [[Liceo Vassalli Junior Lyceum]].

In the 1980s, the [[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]] (MEPA) started to issue permissions for houses to be built. However, after some residents settled there, plans were changed and the Tal-Ħandaq area was changed to an Industrial Zone and was renamed to ''Tal-Ħandaq Industrial Estate'''. Nowadays, although there remain some residents and a few farms, the area has flourished with an extensive number of small businesses, the most common being Panel Beating and Spray Painting, Stoneworks, Steelworks and Woodworks. There is also a film studio.

==Etymology==
'''Tal Handak''' is the British spelling of the town of Tal-Ħandaq. (In Maltese the letter ''Q'' stands for a [[glottal stop]] {{IPAblink|ʔ}}.)

'''Telephone numbers in China''' are organized according to the Chinese Telephone Code Plan. The numerical formats of landlines and mobile phones are different: landlines have area-codes, whereas mobile phones do not. In major cities, landline-numbers consist of a two-digit area code followed by an eight-digit inner-number. In other places, landline-numbers consist of a three-digit area code followed by a seven- or eight-digit inner-number. The numbers of mobile phones consist of eleven digits.

When one landline is used to dial another landline within the same area, it is not necessary to specify the area-code. Between different areas, the target-number must be prepended with the trunk-prefix, which is 0.

Calling a mobile phone from a land line requires the addition of the "0" in front of the mobile phone number if they are not in the same area as well. Mobile to land line calls require the "0" and the area code, if the land line is not within the same area. Mobile to mobile calls do not require the "0". The "0" is not dialled from outside mainland China.

The [[Special administrative region|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] are not part of this numbering plan, and use the country codes +852 and +853, respectively.

In addition, the PRC numbering plan once reserved space for [[Taiwan]], but have dropped this practice.

== Mobile phones ==
2016 December in mainland China have excuted real name to each cell phone number.

In mainland China, [[mobile phone]] numbers have 11 digits in the format 1xx-xxxx-xxxx, in which the first three digits (e.g. 13x, 14x,15x,17x and 18x) designate the mobile phone service provider.

As new numbers were introduced over time, it is possible to recognize the age of a number: The oldest GSM numbers start with 1390…, the second oldest 1380… and 1300… Keeping the same number over time is somewhat associated with stability and reliability of the owner. As the fourth digit was introduced later, thus it is 0 for all old numbers. In further extensions, non-139,138,130 numbers were introduced. The fifth to seventh digit sometimes relates to age and location.

Even earlier, before GSM, mobile phones had numbers starting with 9. Those numbers were eventually translated into 1390xx9…, where xx were local identifiers.

Mobile service providers can be identified by the first three or four digits as follows:
