[[Image:East-Hem 900ad.jpg|thumb|300px|Eastern Hemisphere at the beginning of the 10th century]]

The '''10th century''' was the period from [[901]] to [[1000]] in accordance with the [[Julian calendar]], and the last century of the [[1st millennium]].

In China the [[Song dynasty]] was established. The [[Muslim World]] experienced a cultural zenith, especially in [[al-Andalus]] under the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]]. Additionally, it was the zenith for the Byzantine and Bulgarian Empires.

Medievalist and historian of technology [[Lynn Townsend White, Jr|Lynn White]] said that "to the modern eye, it is very nearly the darkest of the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]", but concluded that ". . . if it was dark, it was the darkness of the womb."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Tenth Century: How Dark the Dark Ages?'', edited by Robert Sabatino Lopez. Holt, Rinehart and Winston: 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Helen Waddell]] wrote that the 10th century was that which "in the textbooks disputes with the [[7th century|seventh]] the bad eminence, the nadir of the human intellect."&lt;ref&gt;''The Wandering Scholars''. Constable and Co: London, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century, [[Lorenzo Valla]] described it as the '''Century of Lead and Iron''' and later [[Cardinal Baronius]] as the '''Leaden Century''' or '''Iron Century'''.

According to one estimate, the tenth century saw fewer deaths in war (as a percentage of the total population) than any other century since 3000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;democraticpeace.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/why-the-20th-century-was-the-bloodiest-of-all/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''4Q121''' (according to the old system as: ''4Q LXXNum'') is a [[septuagint]] manuscript written on parchment (made of animal skin), dated to the 1st century BCE. The scroll contains fragments of the biblical Book of Numbers 3:40-43; 4:5-16. It was found in Qumran in the Cave 4. This fragment is also numbered 803 in the [[septuagint manuscript|list of manuscripts of the Septuagint]] by [[Alfred Rahlfs]].

The manuscript was published and described in 1992 by Patrick Skehan in ''Qumran cave 4.4 (Discoveries in the Judaean desert 9)''. The old sign of the scroll indicates that it was found in the cave 4, which is the manuscript of the LXX or Septuagint, containing the contents of the Book of Numbers.

This manuscript is kept at the [[Rockefeller Museum]] in Jerusalem (Gr. 265 [4Q121]).

The '''Amelungsburg''' is a {{convert|292|m|ft|0|adj=on}} high hill in the [[Lippe Uplands]] in central Germany, in the municipality of [[Dörentrup]] in the district of [[Kreis Lippe|Lippe]].

The Amelungsburg is believed to be the observation hill (''Warthberg'') belonging to the [[Piepenkopf]] rampart system located on its south-southwestern spur.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Hohenschwert: "Ur- und Frühgeschichtliche Befestigungen in Lippe". Herausgegeben von der Altertumskommission für Westfalen, Münster, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations into the charred remains (''Brandfunde'') at the site of the settlement with its double-embankment have been dated to 250 B.C. and can thus be presumed to have belonged to the [[La Tène culture]]. The settlement was not rebuilt.

At the southwestern foot of the Amelungsburg today is a still easily recognised, roughly 2-metre-high section of the [[rampart (fortification)|ramparts]] with a 1.5-metre-deep [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]]. It is suspected that this advanced rampart used to guard the road system.&lt;ref name="Vor- und frühgeschichtliche Burgen in Lippe"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Leo Nebelsiek|Title=Vor- und frühgeschichtliche Burgen in Lippe, Lippischer Kalender |Year=1950|Date=  1950|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to beat looters, the refuge castle has been investigated. Excavations on the plateau of the Amelungsburg unearthed about 300 individual items. In a number of spots there were both single and multiple hordes of goods.

'''Anja Henriëtte Meulenbelt''' (born 6 January 1945 in [[Utrecht]]&lt;ref name="Parlement &amp; Politiek"/&gt;) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] writer and former politician of the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] (SP).

She wrote ''De Schaamte Voorbij'' (''The Shame is Over''), published in 1976, which was an important piece of second-wave feminist writing in the Netherlands. The novel was confessional in tone, and made the connection between the body and language politics overt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Discovering the Dutch: on Culture and Society of the Netherlands|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789089641007|pages=195–6|editor1=Emmeline N.

She was a [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senator]] from 2003 to 2011.&lt;ref name="Parlement &amp; Politiek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlement.com/id/vge7dtpf1zya/a_h_anja_meulenbelt|title=Drs. A.H.

In August 2014, Meulenbelt terminated her membership of the SP, because she felt the party did not speak out enough against [[Israel]]'s military actions in the [[Gaza Strip]].&lt;ref name="RTL Nieuws 2014-08-02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/binnenland/oud-senaatslid-sp-zegt-lidmaatschap-op-vanwege-gaza|title=Oud-Senaatslid SP zegt lidmaatschap op vanwege Gaza|date=2 August 2014|publisher=[[RTL Nieuws]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="De Telegraaf 2014-08-02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/22924583/__Oud-senator_SP_stapt_uit_partij__.html|title=Oud-senator SP uit de partij om Gaza|date=2 August 2014|publisher=[[De Telegraaf]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3921">[[File:CartulariosValpuesta.jpg|thumb|Fragment in [[Visigothic script]]]]
The '''cartularies of Valpuesta''' are two medieval Spanish [[cartularies]] which belonged to a monastery in the locality of [[Valpuesta]] in what is now the [[province of Burgos]], [[Castile and León]], Spain. The cartularies are called the ''Gótico'' and the ''Galicano'' from the type of script used in each. They are housed in the [[National Archives of Spain]].

The Cartularies of Valpuesta are a series of 12th-century Visigothic documents which, in turn, are copies of earlier documents, some of which date back to the 9th century. These [[cartularies]] contain an abundance of words of a developing Romance dialect and a copious list of place names in the Valley of [[Valdegovía|Gaubea]] and the surrounding area. Probably no other [[codex]] of that period offers so many tokens of an incipient Romance language with similarities with modern Spanish. The scribes did not write in pure, erudite Latin, but rather in a more evolved, Romance-like Latin, to be better understood by the common people. The transcription took place during the formative period of the [[Kingdom of Castile]], and it might reflect the early evolution of the Castilian dialect, although a written standard had yet to be established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskonews.com/udalak/valpuesta/cartularioshistoria.htm "Historia de los cartularios", euskonews.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the authenticity of some of the texts is disputed,&lt;ref&gt;Medieval copyists often took liberties with the text of cartularies in order to enhance the privileges of their monasteries&lt;/ref&gt; the cartularies are regarded as significant in the history of the Spanish language, and their status as manuscripts containing ''the earliest words written in Spanish'' has been promoted by the [[Real Academia Española|Spanish Royal Academy]] and other institutions, even though the documents are meant to be written in Latin. They are written in a very late form of Latin mixed with other elements of a [[Iberian Romance languages|Hispanic Romance]] dialect that corresponds in some traits with modern Spanish. 

The preamble of the Statue of Autonomy of Castile and León mentions the cartularies, along with the [[Nodicia de Kesos]], as documents that contain ''the earliest traces of Spanish'' (''las huellas más primitivas del castellano''). However, there have been other documents with a claim to being the earliest in Spanish, notably, the [[Glosas Emilianenses]] (marginalia of circa 1000 ce from La Rioja). In November of 2010, the Spanish Royal Academy endorsed the cartularies—written in "a Latin language assaulted by a living language"("una lengua latina asaltada por una lengua viva")—as the record of the earliest words written in Castilian, predating those of the Glosas Emilianenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}}  Vergaz, Miguel Ángel (2010).[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/11/07/castillayleon/1289123856.html  «La RAE avala que Burgos acoge las primeras palabras escritas en castellano»]. [[El Mundo (Spain)|''El Mundo'']] (Castilla y Leon edition, Valladolid, Spain).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Selections from the oldest documents were published in 1900 in the French journal ''Revue Hispanique''. 
The cartularies are available in a recent scholarly edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.diariodeburgos.es/noticia.cfm/Vivir/20101124/academicos/rae/tildan/revolucionario/estudio/cartularios/valpuesta/CD784DF0-0B2A-AF1D-2CA0D43D3DB207EC Académicos de la RAE], ''Diario de Burgos''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chemakum''' language ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|m|ə|k|ʌ|m}}; also written as '''Chimakum''' or '''Chimacum''') was spoken by the [[Chemakum]], a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] group that once lived on western [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state's [[Olympic Peninsula]]. It was very similar to the [[Quileute language]], the only surviving [[Chimakuan languages|Chimakuan language]]. In the 1860s, [[Chief Seattle]] and the [[Suquamish]] people killed many of the [[Chimakum]] people. In 1890, [[Franz Boas]] found only three speakers, and they spoke it imperfectly.&lt;ref name=ruby&gt;{{cite book |last= Ruby |first= Robert H. |author2=John Arthur Brown |title= A Guide to the Indian Tribes of the Pacific Northwest |year= 1992 |publisher= University of Oklahoma Press |isbn= 9780806124797 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-7zBc-pqnGsC&amp;pg=PA22 |pages= 22–23, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few [[semi-speaker]]s continued until the 1940s on the east side of the Olympic Peninsula, between Port Townsend and Hood Canal. 

The name ''Chemakum'' is an anglicization of the [[Salishan languages|Salishan]] name for the Chimakum people, perhaps old [[Twana language|Twana]] ''čə́mqəm'' (currently ''čə́bqəb'' {{IPA|[t͡ʃə́bqəb]}}).

==Phonology==
Chemakum had three vowels, long and short, and lexical stress. It had the following consonants. (Note the unusual lack of plain [[velar consonant]]s.)

{{U.S. city population tables}}

This article includes information about the 100 most populous [[municipal corporation|incorporated cities]], the 100 most populous [[Core Based Statistical Area]]s (CBSAs), and the 100 most populous [[Primary Statistical Area]]s (PSAs) of the [[United States]] and [[Puerto Rico]].  This information is displayed in two tables.  The first table ranks the cities, CBSAs, and PSAs separately by population.  The second table displays the areas in hierarchical order by the most populous PSA, then most populous CBSA, and then most populous city.

As defined by the [[United States Census Bureau]], an "[[incorporated place]]" includes a variety of designations, including [[city]], [[town]], [[village (United States)|village]], [[borough (United States)|borough]], and [[municipality]].&lt;ref name=NewEngland&gt;Towns in [[New England]], while incorporated on a level similar to cities in other states, are considered [[minor civil division]]s by the Census Bureau and are not included in its list of incorporated places.  A detailed discussion on this subject can be found at [[New England town#Census treatment of the New England town system]].&lt;/ref&gt;  A few exceptional [[census-designated place|Census Designated Places]] (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's list of incorporated places.&lt;ref name=HonoluluHI&gt;The [[Hawaii|State of Hawai{{okina}}i]] has no incorporated municipalities other than the [[Honolulu County, Hawaii|City and County of Honolulu]], which comprises the entire [[Oahu|Island of O{{okina}}ahu]]. In accordance with Hawaiian law, the [[United States Census Bureau]] defines the state's "cities" and "towns" as [[census-designated place|Census Designated Places]] (CDPs).  The Census Bureau defines the [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Urban Honolulu CDP]] as the portion of the City and County of Honolulu that is coextensive with the Judicial District of Honolulu.  The Urban Honolulu CDP is what is generally thought of as the "city" of [[Honolulu]], and its population is used here and in other population comparisons.  The Urban Honolulu CDP is currently the most populous Census Designated Place in the United States.  The [[Honolulu, HI Metropolitan Statistical Area]] comprises the entire City and County of Honolulu.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently on December 1, 2009, the [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) defined 955 [[Core Based Statistical Area]]s (CBSAs)&lt;ref name=CBSA&gt;The [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) defines a [[Core Based Statistical Area]] as one or more adjacent [[county (United States)|counties]] or [[county-equivalent|county equivalents]] that have at least one [[List of United States urban areas|Urban Core Area]] of at least 10,000 population, together with adjacent communities having a high degree of economic and social integration with that core.  Most recently on December 1, 2009, the OMB defined 955 [[Core Based Statistical Area]]s (CBSAs) for the [[United States]] and [[Puerto Rico]] comprising 374 [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]s (MSAs), which have an urban core population of 50,000 or more, and 581 [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]]s (μSAs), which have an urban core population of 10,000 or more but less than 50,000.&lt;/ref&gt; for the United States and Puerto Rico.  The OMB defines a Core Based Statistical Area as one or more adjacent [[county (United States)|counties]] or [[county-equivalent|county equivalents]] that have at least one [[List of United States urban areas|urban core area]] of at least 10,000 population, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured by commuting ties.&lt;ref name=OMB_10-02&gt;{{cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/bulletins/b10-02.pdf|title=OMB Bulletin No. 10-02: Update of Statistical Area Definitions and Guidance on Their Uses|publisher=[[United States Office of Management and Budget]]|date=December 1, 2009|accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Core Based Statistical Areas currently defined by the OMB include the 374 [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]s (MSAs),&lt;ref name=MSA&gt;The [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) defines a [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA) as a [[Core Based Statistical Area]] having at least one urbanized area of 50,000 or more population, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured by commuting ties.  Most recently on December 1, 2009, the OMB defined 366 MSAs for the [[United States]] and 8 MSAs for [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;/ref&gt; which have an urban core population of at least 50,000, and the 581 [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]]s (μSAs),&lt;ref name="μSA"&gt;The [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) defines a [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]] (μSA) as a [[Core Based Statistical Area]] having at least one urban cluster of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000 population, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured by commuting ties.  Most recently on December 1, 2009, the OMB defined 576 μSAs for the [[United States]] and 5 μSAs for [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;/ref&gt; which have an urban core population of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000.

Most recently on December 1, 2009, the United States Office of Management and Budget also defined 125 [[Combined Statistical Area]]s (CSAs) for the United States and 3 CSAs for Puerto Rico.  The OMB defines a Combined Statistical Area as two or more adjacent Core Based Statistical Areas that have substantial employment interchange.  The CBSAs that combine to create a CSA retain their separate identities within the larger CSA.  

A Primary Statistical Area is a single or multiple Core Based Statistical Area that is not a component of a larger statistical area.  The United States Office of Management and the Budget currently does not use the term "Primary Statistical Area."  Currently, the United States and Puerto Rico have 725 Primary Statistical Areas comprising all [[List of Combined Statistical Areas|128 Combined Statistical Areas]] (CSAs) plus the 188 [[List of Metropolitan Statistical Areas|Metropolitan Statistical Areas]] (MSAs) and 409 [[List of Micropolitan Statistical Areas|Micropolitan Statistical Areas]] (μSAs) that are not a component of a CSA.

--&gt;
'''Computational lexicology''' is a branch of [[computational linguistics]], which is concerned with the use of computers in the study of [[lexicon]]. It has been more narrowly described by some scholars (Amsler, 1980) as the use of computers in the study of ''[[machine-readable dictionary|machine-readable dictionaries]]''. It is distinguished from ''computational lexicography'', which more properly would be the use of computers in the construction of dictionaries, though some researchers have used computational lexicography as [[synonymous]].

==History==
Computational lexicology emerged as a separate discipline within computational linguistics with the appearance of machine-readable dictionaries, starting with the creation of the machine-readable tapes of the ''Merriam-Webster Seventh Collegiate Dictionary'' and the ''Merriam-Webster New Pocket Dictionary'' in the 1960s by John Olney et al. at [[System Development Corporation]]. Today, computational lexicology is best known through the creation and applications of [[WordNet]]. As the computational processing of the researchers increased over time, the use of computational lexicology has been applied ubiquitously in the text analysis. In 1987, amongst others Byrd, Calzolari, Chodorow have developed computational tools for text analysis. In particular the model was designed for coordinating the associations involving the senses of [[polysemous]] words.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd, Roy J., Nicoletta Calzolari, Martin S. Chodorow, Judith L. Klavans, Mary S. Neff, and Omneya A. Rizk. "Tools and methods for computational lexicology."''Computational Linguistics'' 13, no. 3-4 (1987): 219-240.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Study of lexicon ===

Computational lexicology has contributed to the understanding of the content and limitations of print dictionaries for computational purposes (i.e. it clarified that the previous work of lexicography was not sufficient for the needs of computational linguistics). Through the work of computational lexicologists almost every portion of a print dictionary entry has been studied ranging from:

# what constitutes a [[headword]] - used to generate spelling correction lists; 
#what variants and inflections the headword forms - used to empirically understand morphology; 
#how the headword is delimited into syllables; 
#how the headword is pronounced - used in speech generation systems; 
#the parts of speech the headword takes on - used for [[part-of-speech tagging|POS taggers]]; 
#any special subject or usage codes assigned to the headword - used to identify text document subject matter; 
#the headword's definitions and their syntax - used as an aid to disambiguation of word in context; 
#the etymology of the headword and its use to characterize vocabulary by languages of origin - used to characterize text vocabulary as to its languages of origin; 
#the example sentences; 
#the run-ons (additional words and multi-word expressions that are formed from the headword); and 
#related words such as [[synonym]]s and [[antonym]]s.

Many computational linguists were disenchanted with the print dictionaries as a resource for computational linguistics because they lacked sufficient [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] information for computer programs. The work on computational lexicology quickly led to efforts in two additional directions.

===Successors to Computational Lexicology===

First, collaborative activities between computational linguists and lexicographers led to an understanding of the role that corpora played in creating dictionaries. Most computational lexicologists moved on to build large corpora to gather the basic data that lexicographers had used to create dictionaries. The ACL/DCI (Data Collection Initiative) and the LDC ([[Linguistic Data Consortium]]) went down this path. The advent of markup languages led to the creation of tagged corpora that could be more easily analyzed to create computational linguistic systems. Part-of-speech tagged corpora and semantically tagged corpora were created in order to test and develop POS taggers and word semantic disambiguation technology.

The second direction was toward the creation of Lexical Knowledge Bases (LKBs). A Lexical Knowledge Base was deemed to be what a dictionary should be for computational linguistic purposes, especially for computational lexical semantic purposes. It was to have the same information as in a print dictionary, but totally explicated as to the meanings of the words and the appropriate links between senses. Many began creating the resources they wished dictionaries were, if they had been created for use in computational analysis. [[WordNet]] can be considered to be such a development, as can the newer efforts at describing syntactic and semantic information such as the FrameNet work of Fillmore. Outside of computational linguistics, the Ontology work of artificial intelligence can be seen as an evolutionary effort to build a lexical knowledge base for AI applications.

==Standardization==
Optimizing the production, maintenance and extension of computational lexicons is one of the crucial aspects impacting [[Natural language processing|NLP]]. The main problem is the [[interoperability]]: various lexicons are frequently incompatible. The most frequent situation is: how to merge two lexicons, or fragments of lexicons? A secondary problem is that a lexicon is usually specifically tailored to a specific NLP program and has difficulties being used within other NLP programs or applications.

To this respect, the various data models of Computational lexicons are studied by [[ISO/TC37]] since 2003 within the project [[lexical markup framework]] leading to an ISO standard in 2008.

The '''conservation and restoration of frescoes''' is the process of caring for and maintaining [[fresco]]s, and includes documentation, examination, research, and treatment to insure their long-term viability, when desired.

== Technology==
[[Fresco]] is a technique of mural painting in which pigment is applied to freshly-laid or wet lime plaster. Water acts as a type of binding agent that allows the pigment to merge with the plaster, and once the plaster sets the painting becomes an integral part of the wall.

===Materials (chemical make-up)===
[[File:LIME CYCLE.jpg|thumb|Lime cycle]]
Fresco chemicals consist of the following:
* Silicon dioxide (sand)
* Calcium oxide (quick lime)
* Dihydrogen oxide (water)
* Calcium hydroxide (slaked lime)
* Carbon dioxide 
* Calcium carbonate (limestone)

Calcium carbonate (limestone) is decomposed by heat to produce calcium oxide (quicklime) and carbon dioxide gas. Then calcium oxide reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) which is accompanied by the release of heat, a reaction known as exothermic.&lt;ref&gt;Gardinali, Piero R.

== Deterioration of frescoes ==
[[File:Hades abducting Persephone.jpg|thumb|Hades abducting Persephone]]
Frescoes can be found in places of worship such as churches, ancient temples and tombs, as well as private residences and commercial establishments used for public entertainment.  It is these environments and their pollutants that interact with the chemicals, both organic and inorganic, utilized to create the frescoes and the pigments used that contribute to their aesthetic and structural deterioration.  Additionally, wall paintings such as frescoes depending on the technique used, possess a layered structure consisting of support, ground or paint layer.  These constituents of wall paintings undergo deterioration physically, chemically or biologically. Although factors like moisture, salts, and atmospheric pollution have generally been the main contributors to the deterioration of wall paintings in most cases, many in the field believe the growth of biological agencies like fungi and microbial flora is also responsible for decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garg|first1=K.L|last2=Jain|first2=Kamal|last3=Mishra|first3=A.K|title=Role of Fungi in the Deterioration of Wall Paintings|journal=The Science of the Total Environment|date=1995|volume=167|pages=255–271|url=http://data2.xjlas.ac.cn:81/UploadFiles/sdz/cnki/%E5%A4%96%E6%96%87/ELSEVIER/deterioration(environment%20science)/1.pdf|accessdate=2 December 2015|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(95)04587-q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical degradation ==
The presence of pigment discoloration, stains and the formation of bio-film are indicative of chemical degradation. Given the variety of organic and inorganic molecules present in frescoes, many type of micro-organisms may grow on the substrate of the fresco provided that environmental conditions (humidity, temperature, light, and pH) are fostered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ciferri|first1=Orio|title=Microbial Degradation of Paintings|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=March 1999|volume=65|issue=3|pages=879–885|pmc=91117|pmid=10049836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical deterioration can be attributed to fungi through their metabolites either by assimilation or dissimulation processes. In the assimilation process, the fungi use the components of frescoes as a carbon source through enzyme production, whereas in the dissimulation process, the decay is mainly by the excretion of waste products or secretion of metabolic intermediates including acids and pigments which can damage, stain or disfigure the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garg|first1=K.L|last2=Jain|first2=Kamal|last3=Mishra|first3=A.K.|title=Role of Fungi in the Deterioration of Wall Paintings|journal=The Science of the Total Environment|date=1995|volume=167|pages=255–271|url=http://data2.xjlas.ac.cn:81/UploadFiles/sdz/cnki/%E5%A4%96%E6%96%87/ELSEVIER/deterioration(environment%20science)/1.pdf|accessdate=2 December 2015|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(95)04587-q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical degradation==
[[File:Fresco in the Terrace Houses in Ephesus (6).JPG|thumb|Fresco in the terrace houses in Ephesus]]
Signs of cracking and disintegration of paint layers and the formation of paint blisters is indicative of physical/structural degradation.  Industrial pollutants contain gases and burning fossil fuels which react with oxygen and water to produce sulfuric acid and nitric acids.  These acids convert calcium carbonate (limestone) to calcium sulfate which becomes soluble in the water and it forms large crystals within the surface layer causing the fresco to blister and flake off.&lt;ref&gt;Gardinali, Piero R. "Chemistry and Fresco Painting".[http://www2.fiu.edu/~gardinal/class_syllabi/IDS4290%20FALL2010/Lecture%2010%20frescos.pdf] Florida International University. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the adverse effects of environmental pollutants, fungal growth either on or below the surface can cause the dislodging of the paint layers further contributing to the physical and structural degradation of frescoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garg|first1=K.L|last2=Kaml|first2=Jain|last3=Mishra|first3=A.K|title=Role of Fungi in the Deterioration of Wall Paintings|journal=The Science of the Total Environment|date=1995|volume=167|pages=255–271|url=http://data2.xjlas.ac.cn:81/UploadFiles/sdz/cnki/%E5%A4%96%E6%96%87/ELSEVIER/deterioration(environment%20science)/1.pdf|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(95)04587-q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preventive care ==
Frescoes that have been removed from their original context and relocated to cultural institutions have the benefit of being in a more stable environment that is consistently monitored, even though they are at low risk. However, for frescoes still at their place of origin, such as cultural heritage sites, are at high risk because they are vulnerable to environmental elements due to a high volume of tourist traffic in conjunction with other pollutants.  Therefore, as with any similar object, data loggers are useful to monitor ambient conditions such as temperature and relative humidity, as well as thermohygrometric sensors for micro-climate monitoring for fresco paintings in indoor, outdoor or semi-confined environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merello|first1=P.|last2=Garcia-Diego|first2=F.|last3=Zarzo,|first3=M.|title=Microclimate Monitoring of Aridane's House (Pompeii, Italy) for Preventive Conservation of Fresco Painting|journal=Chemistry Central|date=2012|volume=6|issue=145|pmc=3541997|pmid=23190798|doi=10.1186/1752-153X-6-145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cleaning methods ==
Cleaning aims to restore artworks to how the artist intended them to look; however, how an artwork is cleaned will depend on the nature of the material to be removed. With paintings, a variety of organic solvents are used, but the most common solvent is water, often with chelating agents, surfactants or salts to control pH. Applying solutions through tissues, gels and sponges is becoming the norm, due to the level of control offered by holding the cleaning system at the upper surface of the art. Such gels, introduced in the late 1980s, are usually water-based emulsions thickened with cellulose or synthetic polymers. By slowly releasing the solvent, they prevent some of the swelling damage that free solvents cause to paint layers. During the 1960s, it became popular to use synthetic polymers to consolidate and stabilise frescoes – plaster-based wall paintings. They seemed like the perfect replacement for the wax coatings previously used, but over time it became clear that this was not the case. Their presence drastically changed the paintings’ surface properties, causing mechanical stresses and crystallisation of salts beneath the painting leading to accelerated disintegration. In addition, the polymers themselves became discoloured and brittle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brazil|first1=Rachel|title=Conservative Innovations|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2014/06/art-conservation|website=Chemistryworld|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the mid-1990s, laser cleaning was established for stone and started to be used for other materials such as gilded bronzes and frescoes. A major breakthrough came when an Italian physicist at the National Research Council Institute of Applied Physics in Florence, Salvatore Siano, developed a method that used even shorter pulses, of only micro- to nanosecond duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brazil|first1=Rachel|title=Conservative Innovations|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2014/06/art-conservation|website=Chemistryworld|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major innovation in the last decade is the use of colloid science and nanotechnology in conservation. In the mid 1990s colloid scientist Piero Baglioni came up with a microemulsion: a clear mixture of organic solvent and water, stabilised with a surfactant that sits at the interface between the water and organic phases.  Another unusual method of cleaning frescoes is with the use of specific types of bacteria to remove inorganic crusts and animal glues from frescoes. Because bacteria can produce a whole host of enzymes they can deal with complex cleaning problems, metabolising organic and inorganic matter into hydrogen sulfide, molecular nitrogen or carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brazil|first1=Rachel|title=Conservative Innovations|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2014/06/art-conservation|website=Chemistryworld|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repair and restoration techniques ==
[[File:IMG 6172 - MI - Sant'Eustorgio - Sottocoro - Restauratrice - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 1-Mar-2007.jpg|thumb|IMG 6172 - MI - Sant'Eustorgio - Sottocoro - Restauratrice - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 1-Mar-2007]]
During the 18th century, new techniques were perfected for the restoration and conservation of ancient works of art, including methods of detaching fresco paintings from walls. Detachment involves separating the layer of paint from its natural backing, generally stone or brick, and can be categorized according to the removal technique used.

The oldest method, known as the a massello technique, involves cutting the wall and removing a considerable part of it together with both layers of plaster and the fresco painting itself.

The stacco technique, on the other hand, involves removing only the preparatory layer of plaster, called the arriccio together with the painted surface.

Finally, the strappo technique, without doubt the least invasive, involves removing only the topmost layer of plaster, known as the intonachino, which has absorbed the pigments, without touching the underlying arriccio layer. In this method, a protective covering made from strips of cotton and animal glue is applied to the painted surface. A second, much heavier cloth, larger than the painted area, is then laid on top and a deep incision is made in the wall around the edges of the fresco. A rubber mallet is used to repeatedly strike the fresco so that it detaches from the wall. Using a removal tool, a sort of awl, the painting and the intonachino attached to the cloth and glue covering are then detached, from the bottom up.

The back of the fresco is thinned to remove excess lime and reconstructed with a permanent backing made from two thin cotton cloths, called velatini, and a heavier cloth with a layer of glue. Two layers of mortar are then applied; first a rough one and then a smoother, more compact layer.

The mortars make up the first real layer of the new backing. The velatini cloths and the heavier cloth serve only to facilitate future detachments, and are therefore known as the strato di sacrificio, or sacrificial layer. Once the mortar is dry, a layer of adhesive is applied and the fresco is attached to a rigid support made from synthetic material which can be used to reconstruct the architecture that originally housed the fresco. After the backing has completely dried, the cloth covering used to protect the front of the fresco during detachment is removed using a hot water spray and decoloured ethyl alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nocentini|first1=Serena|title='Strappo' Detachment|url=http://www.museobenozzogozzoli.it/technics/StrappoDetachment.html|publisher=Museo Benozzo Gozzoli|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piero Baglioni has also pioneered the use of nanoparticles for repairing deteriorating frescoes. Artists generally painted directly onto wet calcium hydroxide plaster, which reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate (calcite). Over centuries, pollution and humidity causes the carbonate layer to break down and sulfate, nitrate and chloride salts within the walls recrystallize, leading to deterioration of the painted surface. Baglioni was sure that nanoparticles would improve on conventional conservation methods. His treatment injects calcium hydroxide nanoparticles dispersed in alcohol and their small size, just 10–100&amp;nbsp;nm, allows them to penetrate several centimetres into the frescoes and slowly reform the depleted calcite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brazil|first1=Rachel|title=Conservative Innovations|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2014/06/art-conservation|website=Chemistryworld|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotics such as amoxicillin can be used to treat strains of bacteria living in a fresco's natural pigment which can turn them into powder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Avvisati|first1=Carlo|last2=McGivern|first2=Hannah|title=Pompeian Frescoes Cured with Antibiotics|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/conservation/pompeian-frescoes-cured-with-antibiotics/|publisher=The Art Newspaper|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method of fresco repair is the application of a protection and support bandage of cotton gauze and polyvinyl alcohol. Difficult sections are removed with soft brushes and localized vacuuming. The other areas that are easier to remove (because they had been damaged by less water) are removed with a paper pulp compress saturated with bicarbonate of ammonia solutions and removed with deionized water. These sections are strengthened and reattached then cleansed with base exchange resin compresses, and the wall and pictorial layer are strengthened with barium hydrate. The cracks and detachments are stopped with lime putty and injected with an epoxy resin loaded with micronized silica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cacci., ed|first1=Leonardo|title=La Fenice Reconstructed 1996-2003: A Building Site|date=2003|publisher=Marsilio|location=Venezia|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sistine Chapel ===

The [[Sistine Chapel]] was restored in the late 1970s and through the 1980s. This was one of the most significant, largest and longest art restoration projects in history. The entire project took twelve years to complete, not taking into account the inspections, planning and approval of the project. Among the many parts of the chapel that was restored, what drew the most attention were Michelangelo's frescoes.  The restoration sparked controversy. A number of experts criticized the proposed techniques, claiming that the restoration procedure would scrape off the layers of various materials on the frescoes, which would lead to damage beyond repair, and  that the removal of the materials would expose the pigments on the frescoes which were fragile and dated to artificial light, temperature variations, humidity and pollution. Such exposure, they feared, would cause massive damage to the original artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sistine Chapel Restoration Controversy|url=http://apecsec.org/sistine-chapel-restoration-controversy/|website=APECSEC.org|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Villa of Mysteries in Pompeii===
[[File:Fresque des mytères, Pompéi.jpg|thumb|Fresque des mytères, Pompéi]]
For the frescos of [[Villa of the Mysteries]] in Pompeii, early conservation efforts sometimes involved removing frescoes, rebuilding or reinforcing the walls, and then reattaching the paintings. The first conservators also applied a coat of wax mixed with oil to clean the paintings’ surfaces, preserve the ancient pigments, and stabilize the fragile works, giving the frescoes a glossy appearance the ancient artists never intended them to have. At the same time, the wax filled in cracks in the surfaces, sealing moisture inside the walls, further weakening them by compromising the strength of the mortar holding the walls together. By 2013 the villa, like most of Pompeii, was in dire need of modern conservation, as was a protective covering that had been constructed in different phases throughout the years. Parts of paintings were crumbling from unstable walls and the mosaics had been severely damaged by millions of visitors’ feet. Repeated applications of wax had caused the pigments to oxidize and darken, and the frescoes to yellow, significantly altering their appearance. All the surface decorations of the villa, both mosaics and frescoes, had been conserved before, but in irregular ways. Some of the methods currently being employed have been used by decades of conservators at Pompeii. Frescoes have been cleaned by hand using a scalpel or a chemical solution. Painted surfaces have been consolidated with an acrylic resin diluted with deionized water and then injected into cracks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lobell|first1=Jaretta A.|title=Saving the Villa of the Mysteries|url=http://www.archaeology.org/issues/124-1403/features/1813-pompeii-saving-the-villa-of-the-mysteries|website=Archaeology Magazine|publisher=Archaeology Institute of America|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the use of antibiotics for the removal of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Avvisati|first1=Carlo|last2=McGivern|first2=Hannah|title=Pompeian Frescoes Cured with Antibiotics|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/conservation/pompeian-frescoes-cured-with-antibiotics/|website=The Art Newspaper|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teams today also have more high-tech tools at their disposal, including lasers to clean the frescoes, and ultrasound, thermal imaging, and radar to evaluate the level of decay of the walls and paintings. Drones are being used to examine the entirety of the villa's protective covering.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''David Viñas''' (July 28, 1927 – March 10, 2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.telam.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11379%3Aargentine-writer-david-vinas-passed-away&amp;catid=34%3Asociety&amp;Itemid=1 Argentine writer David Viñas passed away] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815174434/http://english.telam.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11379%3Aargentine-writer-david-vinas-passed-away&amp;catid=34%3Asociety&amp;Itemid=1 |date=2011-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] dramatist, critic, and novelist.

== Life and career ==
Viñas was born and raised in [[Buenos Aires]], and enrolled in the [[University of Buenos Aires]], becoming head of the [[Argentine University Federation]] student organization. He published his first novel in 1955, and first came to wide attention when he won the [[Alberto Gerchunoff|Gerchunoff]] Prize for his novel ''Un Dios Cotidiano'' (1957). He received the National Prize for ''Jauna'' (1971). The following year, his play ''[[Lisandro de la Torre|Lisandro]]'' won the National Prize for Theater.

Viñas' work centers on [[Argentine history]], and generally does not partake of the [[magical realism]] favored by his contemporaries. He is deeply concerned with Argentina's legacy of [[authoritarianism]] and the problems posed by the nature and historical dominance of the [[Argentine military]]. Two of his children [[Desaparecidos|disappeared]] during the 1976-83 [[National Reorganization Process|military regime]], and he spent that era in exile, returning to Argentina in 1984.

He was an early mentor of critic and essayist [[Beatriz Sarlo]], although he adhered to a more traditional leftist position than did Sarlo in later years. Following the election of left-wing [[Peronist]] [[Néstor Kirchner]] in 2003, he became a vocal supporter of his, and in 2008 co-founded ''[[Carta Abierta]]'' ("Open Letter") with journalist [[Horacio Verbitsky]], an informal [[think tank]] of left-wing public figures in literature, journalism and academia who regularly publish opinion columns in defense of [[Kirchnerism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Noticias'', March 28, 2009: Los pensadores de la corona.&lt;/ref&gt;

Viñas directed the Institute of Argentine Literature at his [[Alma Mater]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6678">The '''Farmington Plan''' was developed by American research libraries in order to ensure access to research materials and publications regardless of war or other events around the world. The plan created a cooperative acquisitions program for foreign materials by region and subject. Even prior to the Farmington Plan, some institutions had already developed their own foreign acquisitions and preservation programs, including the [[University of Florida]], which preserved Caribbean materials and was only added later as partner in the Farmington Plan.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://library.lib.binghamton.edu/salalm/about/ http://library.lib.binghamton.edu/salalm/about/] The Seminar on the Acquisition of Latin American Library Materials at Tulane University, and [http://www.ideals.uiuc.edu/bitstream/2142/6296/1/librarytrendsv15i2k_opt.pdf http://www.ideals.uiuc.edu/bitstream/2142/6296/1/librarytrendsv15i2k_opt.pdf] National Planning for Resource Development by James E. Skipper, Association of Research Libraries 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Farmington Plan was directed from a central office located at the [[Harvard College Library]].  This central office was responsible for financial coordination as well as maintaining and collating annual records regarding the plan.  The office was initially supported by the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] and later by the Harvard College Library.  Materials were selected and purchased by Farmington Plan Agents in foreign countries, classified, and shipped to participant libraries.

The plan was plagued with difficulties.  Agents had difficulty classifying acquired materials, which led to delays in the placement of documents in library collections.  In addition, differences in currency and international laws complicated materials acquisitions from foreign booksellers.

Throughout its existence, numerous criticisms were leveled at the plan.  Among these were the complaint that the plan would not assist in the acquiring of early-print manuscripts, or recent important printed works (which would be acquired by American library interests without the necessary intervention of the plan).  Many important foreign documents, such as government publications or academic dissertations, remained beyond the plan's reach.  In addition, many library professionals were dissatisfied with a perceived bias within the plan in favor of materials originating in Western European countries.

== History ==

The Farmington Plan's origins stemmed from the outbreak of World War II in 1939 and the ensuing lack of access to foreign research materials by American scholars, along with the destruction of many such materials during times of conflict.

In response to the war and its effect on scholastic access to material, Librarian of Congress [[Archibald MacLeish]] sent out a call for advice and suggestions on how best to handle the matter.  Between 1939 and 1942 numerous suggestions and plans were put forward on the subject by several prominent American librarians of the time, all of which influenced the form of the plan at its inception.

The plan was initiated on October 9, 1942 when an advisory committee met in [[Farmington, Connecticut]] to discuss collaborative collection development for preservation and access to foreign materials.

At its initial inception, the plan was known as the ''Proposal for a Division of Responsibility among American Libraries in the Acquisition and Recording of Library Materials'' and existed as an autonomous entity until it was formally incorporated into the [[Association of Research Libraries]] on March 1, 1944.

At its inception, the plan surveyed and collected material from Belgium and Mexico (1944), Peru, Spain, Sweden, Canada, France, and Italy (1945).

The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in 1953 changed the scope and implementation of the Farmington Plan.  Prior to the war it had focused primarily on the acquisition of scholastic materials, mostly from European countries.  After 1953, the plan expanded to begin acquiring materials from outside western countries, and the plan's mission statement changed to emphasize the acquisition of materials with intelligence value.

The plan went into decline through the 1960s and was eventually discontinued in 1972, in part due to the resurgent strength of the cross-Atlantic book markets after World War Two.  However, the plan's legacy persists into the modern day in the form of numerous other cooperative foreign acquisition programs among American libraries.

'''''Four Crowned Martyrs''''' is a sculptural group by [[Nanni di Banco]]. It forms part of a cycle of fourteen sculptures commissioned by the guilds of [[Florence]] for external niches of [[Orsanmichele]], each sculpture showing that guild's patron saint. This sculpture was commissioned by the Arte dei Maestri di Pietra e Legname and completed around 1416-1417. It is in [[Carrara marble|Apuan marble]] and is made of four figures of the [[Four Crowned Martyrs]], the tallest of which is 2.03 m high. It is now indoors in the [[Museo di Orsanmichele]], although a copy fills its original niche.

'''''Fragments from Antiquity: An Archaeology of Social Life in Britain, 2900-1200 BC''''' is a book on the archaeology of Britain in the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages written by the British archaeologist John C. Barrett, then a senior lecturer at the [[University of Glasgow]]. It was first published in 1994 by the Oxford-based company [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] as a part of their ‘Social Archaeology’ series, edited by the archaeologist [[Ian Hodder]] of the [[University of Cambridge]].

An adherent of the [[post-processualism|post-processual]] school of thought in [[archaeological theory]], in ''Fragments from Antiquity'', Barrett eschews the 'grand narrative' approach which he associates with [[processualism]], instead focusing in on the much smaller period of time between 2900 and 1200 BCE.

Although many of Barrett’s interpretations of the evidence remained controversial, Fragments from Antiquity has remained an influential text amongst archaeologists studying British prehistory.

==Background==

===Post-processualism===
{{Emptysection|date=February 2013}}

===John C. Barrett===
Barrett had contributed a section on Early Bronze Age hoards and metalwork to the 1985 book ''[[Symbols of Power|Symbols of Power: At the Time of Stonehenge]]'', a work written by D.V. Clarke, T.G. Cowie and Andrew Foxon which had been published by the [[National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland]].

|quote     = "A characteristic of modern archaeological writing is to avoid… intimacies. We produce more generalized histories, not of 'people' but of 'processes', which place this or any other life in a larger context of economic and settlement systems, or in the mechanisms of social evolution. These layers of generalization have the effect of finally burying the individual, a move in archaeological writing which creates an unbridgeable distance between our own images of the past and the subjective and local intimacies of people’s own lives as they were once lived."

|source    = Barrett, in his Introduction, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar94|Barrett 1994]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In the book's introduction, Barrett criticises the trend amongst processual archaeologists to focus on the generalisation of past societies into a series of processes, instead arguing that archaeologists should instead think about the individuals of the past, who are otherwise forgotten. He therefore accepts the role that post-processual theory plays in the book, but argues that "this is not a book about archaeological theory", instead being "an empirical study aimed at building a history of the period between about 2900 and 1200 BC in southern Britain" a timespan that he considers to be "one of the most remarkable periods in European prehistory".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar94|Barrett 1994]]. pp. 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Edward Moore''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|OM|FBA}} (4 November 1873 – 24 October 1958) was an English philosopher. He was, with [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and (before them) [[Gottlob Frege]], one of the founders of the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition in philosophy. Along with Russell, he led the turn away from [[idealism]] in British philosophy, and became well known for his advocacy of [[common sense]] concepts, his contributions to [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]], and "his exceptional personality and moral character".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/moore/ "Moore, George Edward"]. Preston, Aaron. Internet Encyclopedia. Iep.utm.edu. 30 December 2005. Retrieved 13 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He was Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Cambridge]], highly influential among (though not a member of) the [[Bloomsbury Group]], and the editor of the influential journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''. He was elected a fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1918. He was a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles]], the intellectual secret society, from 1894 to 1901, and the Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club.

==Life==
Moore was born in [[Upper Norwood]], Croydon, Greater London, on 4 November 1873, the middle child of seven of Dr Daniel Moore and Henrietta Sturge.  His grandfather was the author [[George Moore (physician)|Dr George Moore]].  His eldest brother was [[Thomas Sturge Moore]], a poet, writer and engraver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levy|first1=Paul|authorlink1=Paul Levy (journalist)|title=Moore: G.E.

He was educated at [[Dulwich College]]&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', pages 87-88, (Heinemann: London)&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1892 went up to [[Trinity College,  Cambridge]] to study [[classics]] and [[moral sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MR892GE|name=Moore, George Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He became a Fellow of Trinity in 1898, and went on to hold the [[University of Cambridge]] chair of Mental Philosophy and Logic, from 1925 to 1939.

Moore is best known today for his defence of [[ethical non-naturalism]], his emphasis on [[common sense]] in philosophical method, and the [[Moore's paradox|paradox that bears his name]]. He was admired by and influential among other philosophers, and also by the [[Bloomsbury Group]], but is (unlike his colleague Russell) mostly unknown today outside of academic philosophy.  Moore's essays are known for their clear, circumspect writing style, and for his methodical and patient approach to philosophical problems. He was critical of modern philosophy for its lack of [[Philosophical progress|progress]], which he believed was in stark contrast to the dramatic advances in the [[natural sciences]] since the [[Renaissance]]. Among Moore's most famous works are his book ''[[Principia Ethica]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore |first1=G. E.|title=Principia Ethica|date=1903|publisher=University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0879754982|url=http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his essays, "The Refutation of Idealism", "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]", and "A Proof of the External World".

He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1918-19.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/about/the-council/ The Aristotelian Society – The Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Levy (journalist)|Paul Levy]] wrote in ''Moore: G. E. Moore and the Cambridge Apostles'' (1979) that Moore was an important member of the secretive [[Cambridge Apostles]].

G. E. Moore died on 24 October 1958; he was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium on 28 October 1958 and his ashes interred at the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in [[Cambridge]]; his wife, Dorothy Ely (1892-1977) was buried there. Together they had two sons, the poet [[Nicholas Moore]] and the composer Timothy Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yau|first1=John|authorlink1=John Yau|title=Nicholas Moore, Touched by Poetic Genius|url=http://hyperallergic.com/173897/nicholas-moore-touched-by-poetic-genius/|website=[[Hyperallergic]]|accessdate=29 October 2015|date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Nicholas | last = Marshall | title = Timothy Moore | date = 10 March 2003 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/10/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1 | work = The Guardian | accessdate = 14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
===Ethics===
[[Image:Principia Ethica title page.png|thumb|right|200px|The title page of ''Principia Ethica'']]
His influential work ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' is one of the main inspirations of the movement against [[ethical naturalism]] (see [[ethical non-naturalism]]) and is partly responsible for the twentieth-century concern with [[meta-ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=metaethics |title=Metaethics}} by Geoff Sayre-McCord.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The naturalistic fallacy====
{{Main|Naturalistic fallacy}}

Moore asserted that philosophical arguments can suffer from a confusion between the use of a term in a particular argument and the definition of that term (in all arguments). He named this confusion the [[naturalistic fallacy]]. For example, an ethical argument may claim that if a thing has certain properties, then that thing is 'good.' A [[hedonism|hedonist]] may argue that 'pleasant' things are 'good' things. Other theorists may argue that 'complex' things are 'good' things. Moore contends that even if such arguments are correct, they do not provide definitions for the term 'good.' The property of 'goodness' cannot be defined. It can only be shown and grasped. Any attempt to define it (X is good if it has property Y) will simply shift the problem (Why is Y-ness good in the first place?).

====Open-question argument====
{{Main|Open-question argument}}
Moore's [[argument]] for the indefinability of "good" (and thus for the fallaciousness of the "naturalistic fallacy") is often called the [[open-question argument]]; it is presented in [http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.13 §13 of ''Principia Ethica'']. The argument hinges on the nature of statements such as "Anything that is pleasant is also good" and the possibility of asking questions such as "Is it ''good'' that x is pleasant?" According to Moore, these questions are ''open'' and these statements are ''significant''; and they will remain so no matter what is substituted for "pleasure". Moore concludes from this that any analysis of value is bound to fail. In other words, if value could be analysed, then such questions and statements would be trivial and obvious. Since they are anything but trivial and obvious, value must be indefinable.

Critics of Moore's arguments sometimes claim that he is appealing to general puzzles concerning analysis (cf. the [[paradox of analysis]]), rather than revealing anything special about value. The argument clearly depends on the assumption that if "good" were definable, it would be an [[Logical truth|analytic truth]] about "good," an assumption many contemporary moral realists like [[Richard Boyd]] and [[Peter Railton]] reject.  Other responses appeal to the [[Frege]]an distinction between [[sense and reference]], allowing that value concepts are special and ''sui generis'', but insisting that value properties are nothing but natural properties (this strategy is similar to that taken by [[physicalism|non-reductive materialists]] in [[philosophy of mind]]).

====Good as indefinable====
Moore contended that goodness cannot be analysed in terms of any other property. In ''[http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica Principia Ethica], ''he writes:

: It may be true that all things which are good are also something else, just as it is true that all things which are yellow produce a certain kind of vibration in the light. And it is a fact, that Ethics aims at discovering what are those other properties belonging to all things which are good. But far too many philosophers have thought that when they named those other properties they were actually defining good; that these properties, in fact, were simply not "other," but absolutely and entirely the same with goodness. ([http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.10#s10p3 § 10 ¶ 3])

Therefore, we cannot define "good" by explaining it in other words. We can only point to an ''action'' or a ''thing'' and say "That is good." Similarly, we cannot describe to a person born totally blind exactly what yellow is. We can only show a sighted person a piece of yellow paper or a yellow scrap of cloth and say "That is yellow."

====Good as a non-natural property====
In addition to categorising "good" as indefinable, Moore also emphasized that it is a non-natural property. This means that it cannot be empirically or scientifically tested or verified - it is not within the bounds of "natural science".

====Moral knowledge====
Moore argued that once arguments based on the [[naturalistic fallacy]] had been discarded, questions of intrinsic goodness could only be settled by appeal to what he (following [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwick]]) called "moral intuitions:" [[self-evidence|self-evident]] propositions which recommend themselves to moral reflection, but which are not susceptible to either direct proof or disproof ([http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.45 PE § 45]). As a result of his view, he has often been described by later writers as an advocate of [[ethical intuitionism]]. Moore, however, wished to distinguish his view from the views usually described as "Intuitionist" when ''Principia Ethica'' was written:

{{quotation|In order to express the fact that ethical propositions of my ''first'' class [propositions about what is good as an end in itself] are incapable of proof or disproof, I have sometimes followed Sidgwick's usage in calling them 'Intuitions.' But I beg that it may be noticed that I am not an 'Intuitionist,’ in the ordinary sense of the term. Sidgwick himself seems never to have been clearly aware of the immense importance of the difference which distinguishes his Intuitionism from the common doctrine, which has generally been called by that name. The Intuitionist proper is distinguished by maintaining that propositions of my ''second'' class—propositions which assert that a certain action is ''right'' or a ''duty''—are incapable of proof or disproof by any enquiry into the results of such actions. I, on the contrary, am no less anxious to maintain that propositions of ''this'' kind are ''not'' 'Intuitions,’ than to maintain that propositions of my ''first'' class ''are'' Intuitions.|G. E. Moore|[http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/preface#s0p5 ''Principia Ethica'', Preface ¶ 5]}}

Moore distinguished his view from the view of [[deontological ethics|deontological]] intuitionists, who held that "intuitions" could determine questions about what ''actions'' are right or required by [[duty]]. Moore, as a [[consequentialist]], argued that "duties" and moral rules could be determined by investigating the ''effects'' of particular actions or kinds of actions ([http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.89 PE § 89]), and so were matters for empirical investigation rather than direct objects of intuition ([http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.90 PE § 90]). On Moore's view, "intuitions" revealed not the rightness or wrongness of specific actions, but only what things were good in themselves, as ''ends to be pursued''.

===Proof of an external world===
{{Main|Here is one hand}}
One of the most important parts of Moore's philosophical development was his break from the [[idealism]] that dominated British philosophy (as represented in the works of his former teachers [[F. H. Bradley]] and [[J. M. E. McTaggart|John McTaggart]]), and his defence of what he regarded as a "common sense" form of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. In his 1925 essay "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]", he argued against idealism and [[scepticism]] toward the external world, on the grounds that they could not give reasons to accept that their metaphysical premises were more plausible than the reasons we have to accept the common sense claims about our knowledge of the world, which sceptics and idealists must deny. He famously put the point into dramatic relief with his 1939 essay "Proof of an External World", in which he gave a common sense argument against scepticism by raising his right hand and saying "Here is one hand," and then raising his left and saying "And here is another," then concluding that there are at least two external objects in the world, and therefore that he knows (by this argument) that an external world exists. Not surprisingly, not everyone inclined to sceptical doubts found Moore's method of argument entirely convincing; Moore, however, defends his argument on the grounds that sceptical arguments seem invariably to require an appeal to "philosophical intuitions" that we have considerably less reason to accept than we have for the common sense claims that they supposedly refute. (In addition to fueling Moore's own work, the "Here is one hand" argument also deeply influenced [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], who spent his last years working out a new approach to Moore's argument in the remarks that were published posthumously as ''[[On Certainty]]''.)

===Moore's paradox===
Moore is also remembered for drawing attention to the peculiar inconsistency involved in uttering a sentence such as "It is raining but I do not believe it is raining."—a puzzle which is now commonly called "[[Moore's paradox]]". The puzzle arises because it seems impossible for anyone to consistently ''assert'' such a sentence; but there doesn't seem to be any ''logical contradiction'' between "It is raining" and "I don't believe that it is raining." because the former is a statement about the weather and the latter a statement about a person's belief about the weather, and it is perfectly logically possible that it may rain whilst a person does not believe that it is raining.

In addition to Moore's own work on the paradox, the puzzle also inspired a great deal of work by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who described the paradox as the most impressive philosophical insight that Moore had ever introduced. It is said that when Wittgenstein first heard this paradox one evening (which Moore had earlier stated in a lecture), he rushed round to Moore's lodgings, got him out of bed and insisted that Moore repeat the entire lecture to him.

===Organic wholes===
Moore’s description of the principle of [[organic unity]] is extremely straightforward; nonetheless, and a variant on a pattern that began with Aristotle:

: The value of a whole must not be assumed to be the same as the sum of the values of its parts (Principia, [http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.18 § 18]).

According to Moore, a moral actor cannot survey the "goodness" inherent in the various parts of a situation, assign a value to each of them, and then generate a sum in order to get an idea of its total value. A moral scenario is a complex assembly of parts, and its total value is often created by the relations between those parts, and not by their individual value. The organic metaphor is thus very appropriate: biological organisms seem to have emergent properties which cannot be found anywhere in their individual parts. For example, a human brain seems to exhibit a capacity for thought when none of its neurons exhibit any such capacity. In the same way, a moral scenario can have a value far greater than the sum of its component parts.

To understand the application of the organic principle to questions of value, it is perhaps best to consider Moore’s primary example, that of a consciousness experiencing a beautiful object. To see how the principle works, a thinker engages in "reflective isolation", the act of isolating a given concept in a kind of null-context and determining its intrinsic value. In our example, we can easily see that per ''sui'', beautiful objects and consciousnesses are not particularly valuable things. They might have some value, but when we consider the total value of a consciousness experiencing a beautiful object, it seems to exceed the simple sum of these values (Principia 18:2).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4065">'''GLAM''' is an [[acronym]] for "[[art museum|galleries]], [[library|libraries]], [[archive]]s, and [[museum]]s",&lt;ref&gt;Australian Society of Archivists, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030801224434/http://www.archivists.org.au/events/conf2003/ Australian Society of Archivists Annual Conference - GLAM], 17–20 September 2003, Hilton, Adelaide.[https://books.google.com/books/about/Glam.html?id=fRwMRAAACAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CC Wiki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/GLAM|title=GLAM - CC Wiki|publisher=Creative Commons|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to [[cultural institutions]] that have access to knowledge as their mission.

Various versions of the acronym exist, such as '''LAM''', which leaves out galleries, which may be seen as a subset of museums, and may be confused with commercial galleries where art is bought and sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BibSI |url=http://bibsi.cms.si.umich.edu/node/212 |title=On the LAM: Library, Archive, and Museum Collections in the Creation and Maintenance of Knowledge Communities &amp;#124; BibSI |publisher=Bibsi.cms.si.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305191920/http://bibsi.cms.si.umich.edu/node/212 |archivedate=2014-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lam.alaska.gov/ |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2012-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090501071432/http%3A//lam%2Ealaska%2Egov/ |archivedate= May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=LAM DNA August 4, 2005 by Jim |url=http://hangingtogether.org/?p=15 |title=Blog Archive » LAM DNA |publisher=hangingtogether.org |date=2005-08-04 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLAMR is another variant which includes Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Conference - Australian Society of Archivists|url=https://www.archivists.org.au/learning-publications/2017-conference|website=www.archivists.org.au|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, GLAMs are institutions in the public interest, collecting [[cultural heritage]] materials.

The term LAM has been in use at least since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_saAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=LAM+libraries+archives+museums&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=E-LAM|title=Information Retrieval &amp; Library Automation|date=1997|publisher=Lomond Systems.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged as these institutions saw their missions overlapping, creating the need for a wider industry sector grouping. This became apparent as they placed their collections online—artworks, books, documents, and artifacts all effectively becoming "information resources."

Proponents of greater collaboration argue that the present convergence is actually a return to traditional unity. These institutions share epistemological links dating from the [[Library of Alexandria|“Museum” of Alexandria]] and continuing through the [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] gathered in early modern Europe. Over time as collections expanded, they became more specialized and their housing was separated according to the form of information and kinds of users. Furthermore, during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries distinct professional societies and educational programs developed for each kind of institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Archives, Libraries, Museums: Coming Back Together?|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/libraries_and_culture/v049/49.1.marcum.html|journal = Information &amp; Culture: A Journal of History|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 2166-3033|pages = 74-89|volume = 49|issue = 1|doi = 10.1353/lac.2014.0001|first = Deanna|last = Marcum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As collecting institutions, GLAMs preserve and make accessible primary sources valuable for researchers.

A '''Gesamtkunstwerk''' ({{IPA-de|gəˈzamtˌkʊnstvɛʁk|lang}}, translated as "total work of  art",&lt;ref&gt;Millington ([[Wikt:n.d.|n.d.]]), Warrack (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; "ideal work of art",&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''Gesamtkunstwerk''&lt;/ref&gt; "universal artwork",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/U.html#anchor1538384 ArtLex Art Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814172155/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/U.html |date=2016-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "synthesis of the arts", "comprehensive artwork", "all-embracing art form" or "total artwork") is a work of art that makes use of all or many [[The arts|art forms]] or strives to do so. The term is a [[German language|German]] word which has come to be accepted in [[English language|English]] as a term in [[aesthetics]].

The term was first used by the German writer and [[philosopher]] [[Karl Friedrich Eusebius Trahndorff|K. F. E. Trahndorff]] in an essay in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Trahndorff (1827), ''Ästhetik oder Lehre von Weltanschauung und Kunst''&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[opera]] composer [[Richard Wagner]] used the term in two 1849 essays, and the word has become particularly associated with his aesthetic ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interlude.hk/front/richard-wagners-concept-of-the-gesamtkunstwerk/|title=Richard Wagner's Concept of the ‘Gesamtkunstwerk’|website=Interlude.hk|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether Wagner knew of Trahndorff's essay.

In the twentieth century, some writers applied the term to some forms of architecture, while others have applied it to film and mass media.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;For discussions of architecture as Gesamtkunstwerk, see the relevant section of this article. For discussions of film and mass media, see for instance Matthew Wilson Smith, ''The Total Work of Art: From Bayreuth to Cyberspace.'' New York: Routledge, 2007; Carolyn Birdsall, ''Nazi Soundscapes: Sound, Technology, and Urban Space in Germany, 1933–1945.'' Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2012. pp. 141–72; and Jeongwon Joe, "Introduction: Why Wagner and Cinema? Tolkien Was Wrong." In ''Wagner and Cinema,'' edited by Jeongwon Joe and Sander L. Gilman, 1–26. Indiana: Indiana University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before Wagner==
Some elements of opera reform, seeking a more "classical" formula, had begun at the end of the 18th century. After the lengthy domination of [[opera seria]], and the ''[[da capo aria]]'', a movement began to advance the [[Libretto|librettist]] and the composer in relation to the singers, and to return the drama to a more intense and less moralistic focus. This movement, "reform opera" is primarily associated with [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] and [[Ranieri de' Calzabigi]]. The themes in the operas produced by Gluck's collaborations with Calzabigi continue throughout the operas of [[Carl Maria von Weber]], until Wagner, rejecting both the Italian ''[[bel canto]]'' tradition and the [[French opera|French]] "spectacle opera", developed his union of music, drama, theatrical effects, and occasionally dance.

However these trends had developed fortuitously, rather than in response to a specific philosophy of art; Wagner, who recognised the reforms of Gluck and admired the works of Weber, wished to consolidate his view, originally, as part of his radical social and political views of the late 1840s. Previous to Wagner, others who had expressed ideas about union of the arts, which was a familiar topic among German [[Romanticism|Romantics]], as evidenced by the title of Trahndorff's essay, in which the word first occurred, "Aesthetics, or Theory of Philosophy of Art". Others who wrote on syntheses of the arts included [[Gottfried Lessing]], [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Novalis]].&lt;ref&gt;Millington (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s enthusiastic review of [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]]'s opera ''[[Undine (Hoffmann)|Undine]]'' (1816) admired it  as 'an art work complete in itself, in which partial contributions of the related and collaborating arts blend together, disappear, and, in disappearing, somehow form a new world'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strunk|first=Oliver|title=Source Readings in Music History: The Romantic Era|year=1965|place=New York|pages=63|url=http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/aurifex/issue1/castein.html|accessdate=2008-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050502044016/http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/aurifex/issue1/castein.html|archivedate=2005-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wagner's ideas==
Wagner used the exact term 'Gesamtkunstwerk' (which he spelt 'Gesammtkunstwerk') on only two occasions, in his 1849 essays "[[Art and Revolution]]" and "[[The Artwork of the Future]]",&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1993), p. 35, where the word is translated as 'great united work'; p. 52 where it is translated as 'great unitarian Art-work'; and p. 88 (twice) where it is translated as 'great united Art-work'.&lt;/ref&gt; where he speaks of his ideal of unifying all works of art via the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Warrack (n.d.), ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' is incorrect in saying that Wagner used the word only in "The Artwork of the Future"&lt;/ref&gt; He also used in these essays many similar expressions such as 'the consummate artwork of the future' and 'the integrated drama', and frequently referred to 'Gesamtkunst'.&lt;ref&gt;Millington (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; Such a work of art was to be the clearest and most profound expression of folk legend, though abstracted from its nationalist particulars to a universal humanist fable.

Wagner felt that the Greek tragedies of [[Aeschylus]] had been the finest (though still flawed) examples so far of total artistic synthesis, but that this synthesis had subsequently been corrupted by [[Euripides]]. Wagner felt that during the rest of human history up to the present day (i.e. 1850) the arts had drifted further and further apart, resulting in such "monstrosities" as [[Grand Opera]]. Wagner felt that such works celebrated bravura singing, sensational stage effects, and meaningless plots. In "Art and Revolution" Wagner applies the term 'Gesamtkunstwerk' in the context of Greek tragedy. In "The Art-Work of the Future" he uses it to apply to his own, as yet unrealised, ideal.

In his extensive book ''[[Opera and Drama]]'' (completed in 1851) he takes these ideas further, describing in detail his idea of the union of opera and drama (later called ''music drama'' despite Wagner's disapproval of the term), in which the individual arts are subordinated to a common purpose.

Wagner's own opera cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', and specifically its components ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' and ''[[Die Walküre]]'' represent perhaps the closest he, or anyone else, came to realising these ideals;&lt;ref&gt;Grey (2008) 86&lt;/ref&gt; he was himself after this stage to relax his own [[wikt:stricture|strictures]] and write more 'operatically'.&lt;ref&gt;Millington (1992) 294–95&lt;/ref&gt;

==In architecture==
Some architectural writers have used the term ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' to signify circumstances where an architect is responsible for the design and/or overseeing of the building's totality: shell, accessories, furnishings, and landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Vidalis, "Gesamtkunstwerk – 'total work of art'", ''Architectural Review'', June 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to make a claim for when the notion of the ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' was first employed from the point of view of a building and its contents (although the term itself was not used in this context until the late 20th century); already during the Renaissance, artists such as [[Michelangelo]] saw no strict division in their tasks between architecture, interior design, sculpture, painting and even engineering. 
It has been argued by historian  Robert L. Delevoy that Art Nouveau represented an essentially decorative trend that thus lent itself to the idea of the architectural ''Gesamtkunstwerk''. But it is equally possible it was born from social theories that arose out of a fear of the rise of industrialism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Delevoy, 'Art Nouveau', in ''Encyclopaedia of Modern Architecture''. Thames &amp; Hudson, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:RobieHouseWindows ChicagoIL.jpg|thumb| [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]: Interior of the Robie House, Chicago, 1909.]]

However evidence of complete interiors that typify the concept of ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' can be seen some time before the 1890s. There was an increasing trend amongst architects in the 18th and 19th centuries to control every facet of an architectural commission. As well as being responsible for the structure they tried to extend their role to include designing (or at least vetting) every aspect of the interior work as well. This included not only the interior architectural features but was extended to the design&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gwerk.westbankcorp.com/|title=Home - GESAMTKUNSTWERK|website=GESAMTKUNSTWERK|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; of furniture, carpets, wallpaper, fabrics, light fixtures and door-handles. [[Robert Adam]] and [[Augustus Welby Pugin]] are examples of this trend to create an over-all harmonising effect which in some cases might even extend to the choice or design of table silver, china and glassware.
 
A distinctly modern approach to the concept of architectural ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' emerged with the [[Bauhaus]] school, first established in [[Weimar]] in 1919 by [[Walter Gropius]]. The school specialised in design, art and craftsmanship (architecture was not introduced as a separate course until 1927 after it had transferred to [[Dessau]]). Gropius contended that artists and architects should also be craftsmen, that they should have experience working with different materials and artistic mediums, including industrial design, clothes design and theatre and music. However, Gropius did not necessarily see a building and every aspect of its design as being the work of a single hand.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Wittick, ''Encyclopaedia of Modern Architecture''. Thames &amp; Hudson, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Glass Elephant (German: '''Glaselefant''') is a landmark in [[Hamm]], Germany. The former coal-washing building in the Maximilian colliery was reconstructed as a walk-in sculpture by the artist and architect Horst Rellecke for Hamm's horticultural show in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nash |first=Douglas |date=1996 |title=The Politics of Space: Architecture, Painting, and Theater in Postmodern Germany |url= |location= |publisher=P. Lang |page=69 |isbn=9780820425993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "head" of the Elephant houses a palm garden as well as Rellecke's [[kinetic art]] pieces. The lift to the palm garten can be found in the [[Elephant]]'s glass trunk, while a staircase is located at its "rear". At a height of 29 m&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hammwiki.de/wiki/Glaselefant Glaselefant], HammWiki&lt;/ref&gt;, the Elephant opens up to a panorama of the Maximilian park, the city of Hamm, and its surroundings.

[[File:Bad Hamm Blumen-Elefant.JPG|thumb|left|Elephant sculpture made of flowers in Kurpark Bad Hamm]]

In 2009, for [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] day, which was held in Hamm, the Glass Elephant was lavishly redecorated and equipped with a modern [[LED]] lights installation, which changes colours between white, blue, green, yellow, and red. Ever since then, the Glass Elephant changes its colour at regular intervals. During the autumn holidays in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Glass Elephant is used for a light show for the "Herbstleuchten" (English: autumn radiance) festival. During this light show the LED lights installation changes colours and turns on and off to the rhythm of the music.

Replicas and sculptures of the Glass Elephant can be found all over Hamm&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hammwiki.de/wiki/Elefantenparade Elefantenparade], HammWiki&lt;/ref&gt;. A floral sculpture of the Elephant is located in the Kurpark Bad Hamm.

The '''Hermannskogel''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhɛʁmansˌkoːɡl̩|-|De-at Hermannskogel.ogg}}) is a hill in [[Döbling]], the 19th district of [[Vienna]]. At 542 metres above sea level, it is the highest natural point of Vienna.&lt;!--higher is the top of the Radio antenna on the near Kahlenberg--&gt; It lies on the border to [[Lower Austria]].

The [[Habsburgwarte]], standing atop the Hermannskogel, marked the [[kilometre zero]] in cartographic measurements used in [[Austria-Hungary]] until 1918.

== Geography ==
The Hermannskogel is a forested ridge in the [[Vienna Woods|Wienerwald]]. It is both the highest point in the [[Kahlengebirge]] and in the city of Vienna. The Hermannskogel is part of a north-eastern chain of foothills belonging to the [[eastern Alps]]. It is composed of [[flysch]] containing [[quartz]], [[limestone]], [[marl]], and other [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]]. The many cliff-like layers on the south-western approach to the Hermannskogel clearly show the hill’s geological make-up.

The [[Kahlenberg]] and [[Leopoldsberg]], behind which lie the [[Wiener Pforte]], where the [[Danube]] breaks through the Wienerwald, are three kilometres to the east of the Hermannskogel. The [[Vogelsangberg]] stands nearby, as does the [[Dreimarkstein, Vienna|Dreimarkstein]] (to the southwest).

== History ==
The first documentary reference to the Hermannskogel can be found in the [[Klosterneuburg Monastery]]’s [[tithe]] register. It dates from 1355 and names the hill ''hermannschobel''. The name is composed of the personal name Hermann, which was common in the [[Middle Ages]], and ''Kobel'' (which appears elsewhere as '' Kogel''), a common designation for [[Cone (geometry)|cone-shaped]] hills.

In the Middle Ages, the Hermannskogel was covered in [[vineyards]]. On the side of the hill, in a depression between [[Sievering]] and [[Weidling, Klosterneuburg|Weidling]], is the probable former site of the village Kogelbrunn, which lived from [[viticulture]] and which is mentioned for the first time in a document from 1237 as ''chogelbrunne''. In 1256, Albero von Feldsberg accorded the village to the [[Klosterneuburg Monastery]]. In 1346, it was still inhabited, but it was destroyed at the end of the 15th century, probably a victim of [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] raids. The village’s demise also spelt the end of the vineyards and the Hermannskogel was reclaimed by woods.

The relief army summoned from the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] and other parts of the empire that lifted the [[Battle of Vienna|second siege of Vienna]] camped here in 1683.

In the 19th century, several requests made by the Klosterneuburg Monastery to erect a watchtower on the Hermannskogel were turned down. The 27-metre tall [[Habsburgwarte]] (known from 1938 to 1974 as the Hermannskogelwarte) was first built in 1888 and opened a year later.

== The kilometre zero ==
The Habsburgwarte that stands atop the Hermannskogel was established as the [[Kilometre Zero|kilometre zero]] of cartographic measurements in [[Austria-Hungary]] at the start of the 19th century. In the 1920s however, Austria adopted the [[Gauss–Krüger coordinate system]]. Thereafter, the Hermannskogel had the same function as a trigonometric reference point as the Rauenberg point on the [[Marienhöhe, Berlin|Marienhöhe]] in [[Berlin]]. The transition to the [[ETRS89|1989 European Territorial Reference System]] will take place soon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8842">In linguistics, '''immediate constituent analysis''' or '''IC analysis''' is a method of sentence analysis that was first mentioned by [[Leonard Bloomfield]]&lt;ref&gt;Concerning Bloomfield's understanding of IC analysis, see Bloomfield (1933:161).&lt;/ref&gt; and developed further by Rulon Wells.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning Well's comprehensive discussion of IC analysis, see Wells (1947).&lt;/ref&gt; The process reached a full-blown strategy for analyzing sentence structure in the early works of [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;For Chomsky's early understanding of immediate constituents, see Chomsky (1957).&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is now widespread. Most tree structures employed to represent the syntactic structure of sentences are products of some form of IC-analysis. The process and result of IC-analysis can, however, vary greatly based upon whether one chooses the constituency relation of [[phrase structure grammar]]s (= constituency grammars) or the dependency relation of [[dependency grammar]]s as the underlying principle that organizes [[constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] into hierarchical structures.

==IC-analysis in phrase structure grammars==
Given a [[phrase structure grammar]] (= constituency grammar), IC-analysis divides up a sentence into major parts or immediate constituents, and these constituents are in turn divided into further immediate constituents.&lt;ref&gt;The basic concept of immediate constituents is widely employed in phrase structure grammars. See for instance Akmajian and Heny (1980:64), Chisholm (1981:59), Culicover (1982:21), Huddleston (1988:7), Haegeman and Guéron (1999:51).&lt;/ref&gt; The process continues until irreducible constituents are reached, i.e., until each constituent consists of only a word or a meaningful part of a word. The end result of IC-analysis is often presented in a visual [[diagrammatic form]] that reveals the hierarchical immediate constituent structure of the sentence at hand. These diagrams are usually [[tree (graph theory)|trees]]. For example:

::[[File:E-ICA-01.jpg|Bildbeschriftung hier hinzufügen]]

This tree illustrates the manner in which the entire sentence is divided first into the two immediate constituents ''this tree'' and ''illustrates IC-analysis according to the constituency relation''; these two constituents are further divided into the immediate constituents ''this'' and ''tree'', and ''illustrates IC-analysis'' and ''according to the constituency relation''; and so on.

An important aspect of IC-analysis in phrase structure grammars is that each individual word is a constituent by definition. The process of IC-analysis always ends when the smallest constituents are reached, which are often words (although the analysis can also be extended into the words to acknowledge the manner in which words are structured). The process is, however, much different in dependency grammars, since many individual words do not end up as constituents in dependency grammars.

==IC-analysis in dependency grammars==
{{see also|Catena (linguistics)}}
IC-analysis is much different in [[dependency grammar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning dependency grammars, see Ágel et al. (2003/6).&lt;/ref&gt; Since dependency grammars view the finite verb as the root of all sentence structure, they cannot and do not acknowledge the initial binary [[subject (grammar)|subject]]-[[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] division of the clause associated with phrase structure grammars. What this means for the general understanding of constituent structure is that dependency grammars do not acknowledge a finite [[verb phrase]] (VP) constituent and many individual words also do not qualify as constituents, which means in turn that they will not show up as constituents in the IC-analysis. Thus in the example sentence ''This tree illustrates IC-analysis according to the dependency relation'', many of the phrase structure grammar constituents do not qualify as dependency grammar constituents:

::[[File:E-ICA-02.jpg|IC-tree 2]]

This IC-analysis does not view the finite verb phrase ''illustrates IC-analysis according to the dependency relation'' nor the individual words ''tree'', ''illustrates'', ''according'', ''to'', and ''relation'' as constituents.

While the structures that IC-analysis identifies for dependency and constituency grammars differ in significant ways, as the two trees just produced illustrate, both views of sentence structure are acknowledging constituents. The constituent is defined in a theory-neutral manner:

::'''Constituent'''
::A given word/node plus all the words/nodes that that word/node dominates

This definition is neutral with respect to the dependency vs. constituency distinction. It allows one to compare the IC-analyses across the two types of structure. A constituent is always a complete tree or a complete subtree of a tree, regardless of whether the tree at hand is a constituency or a dependency tree.

==Constituency tests==
The IC-analysis for a given sentence is arrived at usually by way of [[constituent (linguistics)|constituency tests]]. Constituency tests (e.g. [[topicalization]], [[clefting]], pseudoclefting, pro-form substitution, [[answer ellipsis]], passivization, omission, [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]], etc.) identify the constituents, large and small, of English sentences. Two illustrations of the manner in which constituency tests deliver clues about constituent structure and thus about the correct IC-analysis of a given sentence are now given. Consider the phrase ''The girl'' in the following trees:

::[[File:Thegirlishappy.png|IC-tree 3]]

The acronym BPS stands for "bare phrase structure", which is an indication that the words are used as the node labels in the tree. Again, focusing on the phrase ''The girl'', the tests unanimously confirm that it is a constituent as both trees show:

::...'''the girl''' is happy &lt;small&gt;- Topicalization (invalid test because test constituent is already at front of sentence)&lt;/small&gt;
::It is '''the girl''' who is happy. &lt;small&gt;- Clefting&lt;/small&gt;
::(The one)Who is happy is '''the girl'''. &lt;small&gt;- Pseudoclefting&lt;/small&gt;
::'''She''' is happy. &lt;small&gt;- Pro-form substitution&lt;/small&gt;
::Who is happy? -'''The girl'''. &lt;small&gt;- Answer ellipsis&lt;/small&gt;

Based on these results, one can safely assume that the noun phrase ''The girl'' in the example sentence is a constituent and should therefore be shown as one in the corresponding IC-representation, which it is in both trees. Consider next what these tests tell us about the verb string ''is happy'':

:: *...'''is happy''', the girl.  &lt;small&gt;- Topicalization&lt;/small&gt;
:: *It is '''is happy''' that the girl. &lt;small&gt;- Clefting&lt;/small&gt;
:: *What the girl is '''is happy'''. &lt;small&gt;- Pseudoclefting&lt;/small&gt;
:: *The girl '''so/that/did that'''. &lt;small&gt;- Pro-form substitution&lt;/small&gt;
:: What is the girl? -*'''Is happy'''. &lt;small&gt;- Answer ellipsis&lt;/small&gt;

The star * indicates that the sentence is not acceptable English. Based on data like these, one might conclude that the finite verb string ''is happy'' in the example sentence is not a constituent and should therefore not be shown as a constituent in the corresponding IC-representation. Hence this result supports the IC-analysis in the dependency tree over the one in the constituency tree, since the dependency tree does not view ''is happy'' as a constituent.

The art of [[ivory]] carving in India is very ancient with references found in [[Kalidasa|Kalidasa's]] [[Meghadūta]]. The earliest ivory carving from the Indian region is comb dating to the 2nd century CE found at [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]]. Ivory carving flourished in [[Assam]] and [[Mysore]] where elephants were available and the art of ivory carving had royal patronage. Ivory was an object of trade between kingdoms and they found their way into areas where the art of carving had patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

This ivory tusk illustrates important life events of [[The life of the Buddha|Buddha]] in 43 circular roundel, first 25 referring to the story of Buddha's birth to his enlightenment followed by 18 depicting his life events from enlightenment to ''Mahaparinirvana''. Similar scenes have been presented in sculptures and paintings many a times but this ivory tusk shows few new scenes of Buddha's life such as Siddharatha's fight for a bird, his move against animal sacrifice and realization of death. As the thickness of the tusk reduces upwards, one can see at the tip three well-known postures depicting ''Bhumisparsha mudra'', ''Abhayamudra'' and ''Dharmachakrapravatan mudra'' besides the roundels. There is also an intricately carved floral creeper banding around the roundels enhancing its beauty.

'''Jacobitism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|æ|k|ə|b|aɪ|ˌ|t|ɪ|z|əm}} {{respell|JAK|ə|bye|tiz|əm}};&lt;ref name=AHD4&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]|date=2000|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston; New York|isbn=0-395-82517-2|page=933|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OED_Compact_2&gt;{{cite book|title=The Compact Oxford English Dictionary|date=1991|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-861258-3|page=888|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{lang-gd|Seumasachas}} {{IPA-gd|ˈʃeːməs̪əxəs̪||}}, {{lang-ga|Seacaibíteachas, Séamusachas}}) was the name of the political movement in Great Britain and Ireland that aimed to restore the [[House of Stuart]] to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The movement was named after ''Jacobus,'' the Latin form of James. 

After [[James II of England|James II and VII]] went into exile after the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]], the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] argued he had 'abandoned' the throne of England and offered it to his Protestant daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] and her Dutch husband [[William III of England|William III]] as joint monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Tim|title=Revolution; the Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685-1720|date=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=0141016523|pages=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, the [[Convention of the Estates of Scotland|Convention]] did the same but claimed he had 'forfeited' the throne of Scotland by his actions, listed in the Articles of Grievances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McFerran|first1=Noel|title=Grievances of the Scottish Convention, April 13, 1689|url=http://www.jacobite.ca/documents/16890413.htm|website=The Jacobite Heritage|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This was a fundamental change capturing a key ideological difference between Jacobites and their opponents; if Parliament could decide James had forfeited his throne, monarchs derived their legitimacy from Parliament, not God, ending the principle of [[Divine Right of Kings]]. However, Jacobitism was a complex mix of ideas; in Ireland, it was associated with tolerance for Catholicism and the reversal of the land settlements of the 17th century. After 1707, many Scottish Jacobites wanted to undo the [[Acts_of_Union_1707|Acts of Union]] that created Great Britain but opposed the idea of Divine right.  

Outside Ireland, Jacobitism was strongest in the [[Scottish Highlands]] and [[Aberdeenshire]], traditional Catholic areas [[Northumberland]] and [[Lancashire]] in [[Northern England]], primarily [[Northumberland]] and [[Lancashire]]), plus parts of Wales and South-West England. The emblem of the Jacobites is the White [[Cockade]]. White Rose Day is celebrated on 10 June, the anniversary of the birth of [[James Francis Edward Stuart|the Old Pretender]] in 1688.

In addition to the 1689-1691 [[Williamite_War_in_Ireland|Williamite War in Ireland]], there were a number of Jacobite revolts in Scotland and England between 1689 and 1746, plus many unsuccessful plots. The collapse of the [[Jacobite_rising_of_1745|1745 Rising]] ended Jacobitism as a serious political movement.   

== Political background ==
{{Toryism |General}}
The first Stuart to be monarch of both Scotland and England was [[James_VI_and_I|James VI of Scotland]], who claimed his authority was divinely inspired, a concept known as [[Divine_right_of_kings|divine right]]. He considered his decisions were not subject to 'interference' by either Parliament or the Church, a political view that would remain remarkably consistent among his Stuart successors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephen|first1=Jeffrey|title=Scottish Nationalism and Stuart Unionism|journal=Journal of British Studies|date=January 2010|volume=49|issue=1, Scottish Special|pages=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:True Law of Free Monarchies.jpg|thumb|left|150px|'The True Law of Free Monarchies;' James I's political tract formed the basis of Stuart ideology]] 
When James became King of England in 1603, a unified Church of Scotland and England governed by bishops was the first step in his vision of a centralised, Unionist state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephen|first1=Jeffrey|title=Scottish Nationalism and Stuart Unionism|journal=Journal of British Studies|date=January 2010|volume=49|issue=1, Scottish Special|pages=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; While both churches were nominally [[Episcopal_polity|Episcopalian]], in reality they were very different in governance and doctrine; Scottish bishops presided over Presbyterian structures and were doctrinal Calvinists who viewed many [[Church of England]] practices as little better than Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McDonald|first1=Alan|title=The Jacobean Kirk, 1567–1625: Sovereignty, Polity and Liturgy|date=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=185928373X|pages=75-76}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Attempts by James's son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] to impose common practices ultimately led to the 1639-1651 [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], the execution of Charles in 1649 and the incorporation of Scotland into the [[Commonwealth_of_England|English Commonwealth]]. After [[the Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660, political and religious conflict continued; in Scotland, this was largely expressed through conflict over governance and control of the kirk and in England, the role of Parliament.
[[File:James II by Peter Lely.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[James II of England|James II and VII]]; despite inheriting the throne with substantial support in 1685, by 1688 James had alienated the vast majority.]] 
In Ireland, the key issues were land rights and tolerance for the Catholic majority; after the [[Flight_of_the_Earls|Flight of the Earls]] in 1607, their lands were confiscated and settled by Scottish and English Protestants, resulting in the [[Plantation_of_Ulster|Plantation of Ulster]]. Retrieving these was a primary aim of the [[Irish_Rebellion_of_1641|1641 Irish Rebellion]] but after the [[Cromwellian_conquest_of_Ireland|Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]], land held by Irish Catholics had fallen from 60% in 1641 to 9%. Only a small minority of large Catholic landowners benefitted from the 1662 [[Act_of_Settlement_1662|Act of Settlement]] passed after the Restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McCormick |first1=Ted |title=Restoration Ireland, 1660-1688; in The Oxford Handbook of Modern Irish History |date=2014 |publisher=OUP |isbn=0198768214|pages=356-360}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to struggles over religion, the Stuarts strongly resisted the growing strength of Parliament; from 1629-1640, Charles I ruled without one. [[Louis XIV of France]] was the greatest exponent of [[Royal Absolutism]] in contemporary Europe, which meant  many associated political absolutism with Catholicism. Charles II refused to call an English Parliament between 1681-1685, while in Ireland, only one session of Parliament was held between 1660 and 1689. 

In 1685, Charles' Catholic brother became [[James II of England|James II and VII]], with considerable support in all three kingdoms; however, tolerance for his personal Catholicism did not extend to Catholicism in general. James' attempts to extend these measures to other Dissenters and his use of the Royal Prerogative to do so evoked memories of the religious and political divisions that led to the Civil Wars and were resisted by the Presbyterian Scots and his English Tory Anglican supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Tim |title=Politics under the Later Stuarts: Party Conflict in a Divided Society, 1660-1715 |date=1993 |publisher=Longman |isbn=0582040825 |pages=123-127}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his Catholic viceroy in Ireland, [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell]], began replacing Protestant office holders with Catholics, while also purging them from an expanded [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Royal Irish Army]].

In June 1688, two events turned dissent into a crisis; the birth of [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Francis Edward]] on 10 June created a Catholic heir, excluding James' Protestant daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and her husband [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. Prosecuting the [[Seven Bishops]] seemed to go beyond tolerance for Catholicism and into an assault on the Episcopalian establishment; their acquittal on 30 June destroyed James' political authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Tim|title=Revolution; the Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685-1720|date=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=0141016523|pages=235–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Queen Anne by John Closterman.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The last Stuart monarch, Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] ca 1702]]   
In 1685, many feared civil war if James were bypassed; by 1688, anti-Catholic riots made it seem only his removal could prevent one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wormsley|first1=David|title=James II: The Last Catholic King|date=2015|publisher=Allen Lane|isbn=014197706X|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives from across the political class invited William to assume the English throne and he landed in [[Brixham]] on 5 November; James' army deserted him and he went into exile on 23 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Tim|title=Revolution; the Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685-1720|date=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=0141016523|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament offered the English throne to William and Mary in February 1689; a large majority agreed Mary should replace her father but William's demand he be made joint monarch and sole ruler if she died was only narrowly approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Tim|title=Revolution; the Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685-1720|date=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=0141016523|pages=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[Convention of the Estates of Scotland|Scottish Convention]] was elected in March 1689 to agree a Settlement, with only a tiny minority of the 125 delegates loyal to James.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Tim|title=Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy, 1685-1720|date=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=0141016523|pages=379–386}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March, James began the [[Williamite_War_in_Ireland|War in Ireland]]; on 11 April, the Convention ended James' reign and William and Mary accepted the Scottish throne on 11 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coward|first1=Barry|title=The Stuart Age 1603-1714|date=1980|publisher=Longman|isbn=0582488338|page=460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To win Irish support, James reluctantly conceded demands by the [[Patriot_Parliament|Patriot Parliament]] in May 1689 that he restore lands confiscated by Cromwell; these were declared void after his defeat in 1691 but the memory persisted.  

James II died in exile in 1701 and when William died in 1702, his younger daughter [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] became the last Stuart monarch; in 1707, the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] between England and Scotland completed the process begun by James I. Since neither Anne nor Mary had surviving children, the [[Act of Settlement 1701|1701 Act of Settlement]] ensured a Protestant successor by excluding Catholics from the English and Irish thrones, and that of Great Britain after the [[Acts of Union 1707|1707 Act of Union]]. Anne's heir was the distantly related but Protestant [[Sophia of Hanover]], not her Catholic half-brother James. Sophia died two months before Anne in August 1714; her son became [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] and the pro-Hanoverian [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] controlled government for the next 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Somerset|first1=Anne|title=Queen Anne; the Politics of Passion|date=2012|publisher=Harper Press|isbn=0007203764|pages=532–535}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, the exclusion of Tories from government after 1715 would become a major element in support for the exiled Stuarts.

== Religion ==
While Jacobitism was closely linked with [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] from the outset, particularly in Ireland, in Britain Catholics were a small minority by 1689 and the bulk of Jacobite support came from other groups. Catholics formed about 75% of the population of Ireland. In England, however, not more than 2–3% of the population could have been "practising Catholics", though in the north and south of England, "at least one half of the population outside the towns were Catholic in some degree". By this definition, Catholics numbered 10–15% of the English population. Catholicism survived most strongly among the nobility, of whom 15–20% clung to the old faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Kevin | last = Phillips | title = The Cousins Wars | place = New York | publisher = Basic Books | year = 1999 | pages = 52–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland (excluding the Highlands and the Isles), it is estimated that about 2% of the population were Catholic.

=== Ireland ===
The key demands of Irish Jacobitism remained consistent until the Stuart cause ended in the mid eighteenth century; these were religious toleration, legislative autonomy and land ownership. During the 1638-1651 [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and the 1641 [[Irish_Rebellion_of_1641|Irish Rebellion]], much of Ireland was controlled by the Catholic [[Confederate_Ireland|Confederacy]] or Cónaidhm Chaitliceach na hÉireann, who offered their allegiance to [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]]. 

However, Irish support for the [[Stuarts]] was primarily an alliance of convenience, rather than bonds of loyalty, since Charles failed to implement his 1628 promise allowing freedom of worship for Catholics and supported the 1642 [[Adventurers'_Act|Adventurers' Act]] penalising many supporters of the Confederacy. His Catholic son James was seen more favourably and when he became king in 1685, the Catholic [[Richard_Talbot,_1st_Earl_of_Tyrconnell|Earl of Tyrconnell]] was appointed [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]]; he admitted Catholics into the army and militia and refused to enforce anti-Catholic penal laws. 

This meant when James was exiled by the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, Ireland was an obvious location to launch his campaign to retake his kingdoms, which was later known as the [[War in Ireland]]. The 1689 [[Patriot_Parliament|Dublin Parliament]] provided James financial support in return for removing restrictions on Catholic worship but the supremacy of the Protestant [[Church of Ireland]] was left intact, while James actively resisted legislation that reversed post-1651 land confiscations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Thomas |title=Revolution; the Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685-1720 |date=2006 |publisher=Allen Lane |isbn=9780713997590 |page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Magennis 1998 6–111"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/30064327|title=A 'Beleaguered Protestant'?: Walter Harris and the Writing of ''Fiction Unmasked'' in Mid-18th-Century Ireland|first=Eoin|last=Magennis|pages=6–111|journal=Eighteenth-Century Ireland|volume=13|year=1998|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While active Protestant support was limited, as with the [[Church_of_England|Church of England]], many members of the Church of Ireland continued to back the Stuart right to the throne. Prominent Irish [[Nonjuring_schism|Non-Jurors]] included [[William_Sheridan_(Bishop_of_Kilmore_and_Ardagh)|William Sheridan, Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh]] and the Jacobite propagandist [[Charles_Leslie_(nonjuror)|Charles Leslie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Doyle |first1=Thomas |title=Jacobitism, Catholicism and the Irish Protestant Elite, 1700-1710 |journal=Eighteenth-Century Ireland / Iris an dá chultúr |date=1997 |volume=12 |pages=29-30 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30071383 |accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After James was defeated in 1691, all measures passed by the 1689 Parliament were annulled while many of his Catholic soldiers joined the [[Irish Brigade (French)|Irish Brigade]] in the French army.

=== England ===
In England some support came from the [[Nonjuring schism|Nonjuring]] [[Anglican]]s, which started with [[Church of England]] clergy who refused on principle to take the oath of allegiance to William and Mary while James still lived, and developed into an Episcopalian schism of the church with small congregations in all the English cities. In many respects, Jacobites perceived themselves as the heirs of the Royalists or [[Cavaliers]] of the [[English Civil War]] era, who had fought for James II's father Charles I and for the Established Church against the [[Roundheads|Parliamentarians]], the latter standing for the primacy of Parliament and for religious dissent. Jacobite supporters displayed pictures of both Cavalier and Jacobite heroes in their homes.

=== Scotland ===
In lowland Scotland, the Catholics tended to come from the gentry and formed the most ideologically committed supporters, drawing on almost two centuries of subterfuge as a minority persecuted by the state and rallying enthusiastically to Jacobite armies as well as contributing financial support to the court in exile.

The clan chief who led his men at the [[Battle of Culloden]], the 'Gentle Lochiel', survived to command the French Régiment d'Albanie, and died at Bergues in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clan-cameron.org/history.html |title=A History of Clan Cameron |website=Clan-cameron.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scottish Episcopal Church|Scottish Episcopalians]] provided over half of the Jacobite forces in Britain, and although Dundee's rising in 1689 came mostly from the western Highlands, in later risings Episcopalians came roughly equally from north-eastern Scotland and from the Highland clans (the latter containing a large Catholic component). The Episcopalians were also described as Nonjurors. As Protestants they could take part in Scottish politics, but were in a minority and were repeatedly discriminated against in legislation favouring the established [[Church of Scotland]]. The clergy could even be imprisoned, as occurred in the [[Stonehaven Tolbooth]] after three clergymen held services at the chapel at [[Muchalls Castle]]. However, many Episcopalians were quiet about any Jacobite sympathies and were able to accommodate themselves to the new regime. About half of the Episcopalians supporting the Jacobite cause came from the Lowlands, but this was obscured in the risings by their tendency to wear Highland dress as a type of Jacobite uniform.

To the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking Scottish Highland clans, to whom the supporters of Jacobitism were known as ''[[:gd:na Seumasaich|Seumasaich]]'', the conflict was more about inter-clan politics than about religion, and a significant factor was resistance to the territorial ambitions of the (Presbyterian) [[Clan Campbell|Campbells]] of [[Argyll]]. There was a precedent for post-1689 Jacobitism during the period of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], when clans from the western Highlands had fought for James's father Charles I against the Campbells and the [[Covenanters]]. Another factor in Highland Jacobitism was James VII's sympathetic treatment of the Highland clans. Whereas previous monarchs since the late 16th century had been antagonistic to the Gaelic Highland way of life, James had worked sympathetically with the clan chieftains in the Commission for Pacifying the Highlands. Some Highland chieftains therefore viewed Jacobitism as a means of resisting hostile government intrusion into their territories. The significance of their support for the Stuarts was that the Highlands was the only part of Britain which still maintained private armies, in the form of clan levies. During the [[Jacobite risings]], they provided the bulk of Jacobite manpower.

=== Opportunists and adventurers ===
Another source of Jacobite support came from those dissatisfied with political developments. Some [[British Whig Party|Whigs]], most obviously the [[John Erskine, 22nd Earl of Mar|Earl of Mar]], reacted to political disappointments by joining the Jacobites, but while others were courted from 1692 onwards and indicated support, mostly this was just reinsurance in case the Jacobites came out on top.

The [[Tory|Tories]] were a more likely source of support given their commitment to church and king, but many were reluctant to trust the [[Church of England]] to a Catholic king. At times such as 1715–1722 when the Hanoverians appeared to be dismantling Anglican dominance and 1743–1745 when Whig dealings denied the Tories a parliamentary victory they would coalesce and turn to the Jacobites, but they were reluctant when it came to serious action. Nevertheless, this gave hopes that large numbers of Tories would support a Jacobite rising with a serious prospect of winning, particularly when helped by foreign intervention. The rise and fall of the earlier Tory alliance with the Jacobites forms a major part of the background for [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Bride of Lammermoor]]''.

Other Jacobite recruits could be described as adventurers&amp;nbsp;– desperate men who saw the cause as a solution to their (usually financial) problems. Although small in number and varying from unemployed weavers looking for excitement to impoverished gentry like [[William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock]] who served Charles as a colonel and became a general after the [[Battle of Falkirk (1746)|Battle of Falkirk]], they contributed significantly to the daring that brought the Jacobites a prospect of success in their campaigns. However, other such mercenaries often became spies and informers.

A number of pirates were among the opportunists who flocked to the Jacobite banner. Some gave their ships Jacobite names such as [[Queen Anne's Revenge]] or [[Stede Bonnet|Royal James]].&lt;ref name="Jacobitism and the “Golden Age” of Piracy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=E.

== Ideology ==
Jacobite ideology comprised four main tenets: The [[divine right of kings]], the "accountability of Kings to God alone", inalienable hereditary right, and the "unequivocal scriptural injunction of non-resistance and passive obedience",&lt;ref&gt;J.C.D. Clark ''English Society 1660–1832'' Cambridge University Press Second Edition (2000) p89&lt;/ref&gt; though these positions were not unique to the Jacobites. What distinguished Jacobites from Whigs was their adherence to 'right' as the basis for the law, whereas the Whigs held to the idea of [[Possession (law)|'possession']] as the basis of the law. However, such distinctions became less clear over time, with an increase in the use of [[Social contract|contract theory]] by some Jacobite writers during the reign of George I.&lt;ref&gt;H. Erskine-Hill, 'Literature and the Jacobite Cause: Was There a Rhetoric of Jacobitism?’, in E. Cruickshanks (ed.) "Ideology and Conspiracy: Aspects of Jacobitism, 1689–1759" J. Donald, Edinburgh (1982) p55&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobites contended that James II had not been legally deprived of his throne,&lt;ref&gt;J.C.D. Clark ''English Society 1660–1832'' Cambridge University Press Second Edition (2000) p94&lt;/ref&gt; and that the [[Convention Parliament (England)|Convention Parliament]] and its successors were not legal. Scottish Jacobites resisted the [[Act of Union of 1707]]; while not recognising Parliamentary Great Britain, Jacobites recognised their monarchs as Kings of Great Britain.

The majority of Irish people supported James II due to his 1687 [[Declaration of Indulgence]] or, as it is also known, The Declaration for the Liberty of Conscience, which granted religious freedom to all denominations in England and Scotland, and also due to James II's promise to the Irish Parliament of an eventual right to self-determination.&lt;ref name="Harris 2006 440"&gt;{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Harris|title=Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy, 1685–1720|location=London|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7139-9759-0|page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Magennis 1998 6–111"/&gt;

== Community and policy ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Neville Chamberlain]] --&gt;

From its religious roots, Jacobite ideology was passed on through committed families of the nobility and gentry who would have pictures of the exiled royal family and of Cavalier and Jacobite martyrs, and take part in like minded networks. Even today, some Highland clans and regiments pass their drink over a glass of water during the Loyal Toast&amp;nbsp;– to the King Over the Water. More widely, [[commoners]] developed communities in areas where they could fraternise in Jacobite alehouses, inns and taverns, singing seditious songs, collecting for the cause and on occasion being recruited for risings. At government attempts to close such places they simply transferred to another venue. In these neighbourhoods Jacobite wares such as inscribed glassware, brooches with hidden symbols and tartan waistcoats were popular. The criminal activity of smuggling became associated with Jacobitism throughout Britain, partly because of the advantage of dealing through exiled Jacobites in France.

Official policy of the court in exile initially reflected the uncompromising intransigence that got James into trouble in the first place. With the powerful support of the French they saw no need to accommodate the concerns of his Protestant subjects, and effectively issued a summons for them to return to their duty. In 1703 Louis pressed James into a more accommodating stance in the hopes of detaching England from the Grand Alliance, essentially promising to maintain the status quo. This policy soon changed, and increasingly Jacobitism ostensibly identified itself with causes of the alienated and dispossessed.

== Military ==

{{Main|Jacobite risings}}
{{See also|Williamite War in Ireland|Jacobite rising of 1715|Jacobite rising of 1745}}

There were Jacobite risings in 1689, 1715, 1719 and 1745. There were also planned French invasions of Britain in support with or in support of the Jacobites in 1708 and 1744.

== Decline ==
{{no footnotes|section|date=February 2013}}
Jacobitism entered permanent decline after the "Forty-Five" rebellion.

=== Crushing of the clans ===
In an effort to prevent further trouble in the Scottish Highlands, the government outlawed many cultural practices to destroy the warrior [[Scottish clan|clan system]]. The [[Act of Proscription 1746]] – incorporating the [[Disarming Act]] and the [[Dress Act]] – required all swords to be surrendered to the government and prohibited wearing of [[tartan]]s or [[kilt]]s. The [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660]] ended the feudal bond of military service and the [[Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746|Heritable Jurisdictions Act 1746]] removed the virtually sovereign power the chiefs had over their clan. The extent of enforcement of the prohibitions was variable and sometimes related to a [[Scottish clan|clan's]] support of the government during the rebellion.

Government troops were stationed in the Highlands. More roads and [[barracks]] were built to better control the region, with a new fortress at [[Fort George, Highland|Fort George]] to the east of [[Inverness]] which still serves as a base for Highland Regiments of the British Army. Highland clans found a way back to legitimacy by providing regiments to the British Army, many of whom served with distinction in the subsequent [[Seven Years' War]].

===Difficulties in France===
The French made every effort to rescue Jacobite chieftains as well as Charles, and gave him a hero's welcome on his return to France, but soon tired of his badgering them to provide a renewed assault on the Hanoverians. After French victories knocked the Netherlands out of the war, the British offered reasonable peace terms and made the expulsion of Charles from France a precondition of negotiations. Charles ignored the French court's order to depart, continued to demand military action and support for his extravagant lifestyle and flaunted his presence around Paris as peace negotiations for the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] got under way. After British complaints the French government lost patience with Charles and in December 1748 he was seized on his way to the Opéra and briefly jailed before being expelled.

=== Elibank plot ===
From 1749 to 1751 Charles laid the groundwork for a rising in England, visiting London in 1750 when he conferred with the Jacobite leaders and considered an assault on the [[Tower of London]] as well as converting to [[Anglican]]ism. The English Jacobites were clear that they would not move without foreign assistance, and Charles turned to [[Frederick II of Prussia]]. While Frederick was indifferent to the Jacobite cause he made diplomatic use of the opportunity, and appointed the [[George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal|Earl Marischal]] as his ambassador to Paris, in a position to keep him informed and veto any plans. [[Alexander Murray of Elibank]] House, Taplow, the liaison between Charles and the plotters, finally realised there was no hope of foreign assistance and ended the conspiracy, but by then Charles had sent two exiled Scots as agents to prepare the clans. They were betrayed by Alistair Ruadh MacDonell of [[Clan MacDonell of Glengarry|Glengarry]], a spy in Charles's entourage, and while one was arrested, the other barely escaped. Charles responded to the failure by denouncing his comrades, and continuing with his by now routine drunkenness and abuse of his mistress. Finally, in a dispute with Marischal and the English conspirators in 1754, a drunken Charles threatened to publish their names for having "betrayed" him, finally causing his supporters to abandon the Jacobite cause.

=== Loss of French support ===
In 1759 French naval defeats at [[Battle of Lagos|Lagos]] and [[Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon Bay]] forced them to abandon a planned [[Planned French Invasion of Britain (1759)|invasion of Britain]], which would have placed Charles on the throne. It is often considered the last realistic chance for the Jacobites. With its passing, Charles collapsed yet further into alcoholism and was soon entirely abandoned by the French government, who saw little further use for him. The English Jacobites stopped sending funds, and by 1760 Charles, who had returned to Catholicism, was relying on the Papacy to support his lifestyle in Rome.

In 1766, when Old Pretender James (VIII/III) Edward Stuart died, the [[Holy See]] refused to recognise "Bonnie" Prince Charles as the lawful sovereign of Great Britain, thus depriving him of his most powerful remaining support, the French support being long gone. In 1788, the Scottish Catholics swore allegiance to the House of Hanover, and resolved two years later to pray for King George by name.

=== Henry IX ===
[[File:Monument to the Stuarts detail.JPG|thumb|Detail of the monument in the Vatican]]
When Charles died in 1788 the Stuart claim to the throne passed to his younger brother [[Henry Benedict Stuart|Henry]], who had become a Cardinal, and who now styled himself King Henry IX of England. After falling into financial difficulty during the [[French Revolution]], he was granted a stipend by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. However, he never actually surrendered his claims to the throne, though all former supporters of Jacobitism had stopped funding.
Following the death of Henry in 1807, the Jacobite claims passed to those excluded by the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]]: initially to the [[House of Savoy]] (1807–1840), then to the Modenese branch of the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] (1840–1919), and finally to the [[House of Wittelsbach]] (1919–present). [[Franz, Duke of Bavaria]] is the current Jacobite heir. Neither he nor any of his predecessors since 1807 have pursued their claim. Henry, Charles and James are memorialised in the [[Monument to the Royal Stuarts]] in the Vatican.

== Outcome ==
What began with the English parliament asserting a new authority and William looking to expand alliances against France quickly developed into a major distraction, with William being forced to focus attention on Ireland and Scotland, and parliament having to fund the armies needed to overcome the Jacobites. This distraction helped keep Britain from intervening on the continent and contributed to twenty years of peace in Europe, while continuing unrest forced the British state to develop repressive strategies with networks of spies and informers as well as increasing its standing army. While Jacobitism increasingly appealed to the disaffected, it inherently bowed to higher authority and thus reinforced the social order. It left the British state strengthened to deal with the more revolutionary movements that developed later in the 18th century.

=== Romantic revival ===
[[File:Pettie - Jacobites, 1745.jpg|right|thumb|250px|"Jacobites" by [[John Pettie]]:  romantic view of Jacobitism]]
Jacobitism is celebrated in many folk songs, including those by nineteenth century Scots poets such as [[Alicia Ann Spottiswoode|Alicia Spottiswoode]] and [[Carolina Nairne, Lady Nairne]] (whose "[[Bonnie Charlie]]" remains popular). [[The Corries]] were well-known for singing this type of music. One of the best known songs is [[Mo Ghile Mear]] by [[Seán Clárach Mac Domhnaill]] which has been sung by many artists including Sting. Additionally, Jacobitism became the subject of romantic poetry and literature, notably the work of [[Robert Burns]] and [[Sir Walter Scott]].

Walter Scott, author of ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', a story of the 1745 rebellion, combined romantic Jacobitism with an appreciation of the practical benefits of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] government, and in 1822 he arranged a pageantry of reinvented Scottish traditions for the [[visit of King George IV to Scotland]] when [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] visited [[Edinburgh]] and dressed as a [[kilt]]ed successor to his distant relative Charles Stuart. The [[tartan]] pageantry was immensely popular and the kilt became [[Scottish national identity|Scotland's National Dress]].

=== Neo-Jacobite revival ===
{{main|Neo-Jacobite Revival}}
There was a brief revival of political Jacobitism in the 1890s,&lt;ref name=pittock&gt;{{cite book |title=Spectrum of Decadence: The Literature of the 1890s |last=Pittock |first=Murray |publisher=Routledge |date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jacobitemag.com/2017/06/10/jacobite-why-bother/ |title=A Jacobitism |website=Jacobite Magazine |date= |accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A number of Jacobite clubs and societies were formed, such as the Order of the White Rose. In 1890, [[Herbert Vivian]] and [[Ruaraidh Erskine]] co-founded a weekly newspaper, "The Whirlwind" that espoused a Jacobite political view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Whirlwind |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |location=New York |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/350673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivian, Erskine and [[Melville Henry Massue]] formed the Legitimist Jacobite League of Great Britain and Ireland in 1891, which lasted for several years. Vivian went on to stand for Parliament four times on a Jacobite platform - though he failed to be elected each time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stirling Burghs Vacancy |work=Dundee Evening Telegraph |date=29 April 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revival largely came to an end with the [[World War I|First World War]] and the various societies of the time are now represented by the [[Royal Stuart Society]].

==In literature and popular culture ==
Jacobitism has been a popular subject for historical novels, and for speculative and humorous fiction.

Historical novels ''[[Waverley (novel)]]'' and ''[[Rob Roy (novel)]]'' by Sir [[Walter Scott]] focus on the first and second Jacobite rebellions.

''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'' (1886) is a [[historical novel|historical fiction]] [[adventure novel]] by the Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] that features the intrigues of Jacobite troubles in Scotland.

In 1909, a short story by John Buchan entitled The Company of the Marjolaine was published in Blackwood's Magazine. The plot of the story concerns a group of Jacobite sympathisers paying a visit to an aged Bonnie Prince Charlie towards the end of his life.

In the 1920s, [[D. K. Broster]] wrote the Jacobite Trilogy of novels featuring the dashing hero Ewen Cameron.

Science Fiction writer [[John Whitbourn]] described his 1998 book, ''The Royal Changeling'' as "The first work of Jacobite propaganda for several centuries".

Among the political entities sharing a future human-settled galaxy depicted by [[A. Bertram Chandler]] is "The Jacobite Kingdom of Waverly". One of Chandler's stories mentions "the coronation of King James XIV", held with great pomp and broadcast throughout the Galaxy.

[[Joan Aiken]]'s ''Wolves Chronicles'' have as background an alternative history of England, in which King James III, a Stuart, is on the throne, and the [[Hanoverians]] plot to overthrow him.

In an episode of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' TV series, "Esprit de Corps", originally broadcast 14 March 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theavengers.tv/forever/gale2-25.htm |title=The Avengers Forever: Esprit de Corps |website=Theavengers.tv |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Scottish general plots a coup using [[Cathy Gale]] as the Stuart heir, whom he wishes to enthrone as Queen Anne II.

[[Garrison Keillor]] told one of his [[Lake Wobegon]] stories, "The Royal Family", about a poor Minnesota family who are persuaded that they are the long-lost Stuart heirs. They dream of returning to [[Edinburgh]] and taking their rightful place on the throne of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Garrison Keillor: A Critical Companion |last=Marcia |first=Songer |year=2000 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport CT |isbn=0-313-30230-8 |page=67 |url=https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=3uJaAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fictional account is given of the Jacobite/Hanoverian conflict in ''The Long Shadow'', ''The Chevalier'' and ''The Maiden'', Volumes 6–8 of ''[[The Morland Dynasty]]'', a series of historical novels by author [[Cynthia Harrod-Eagles]]. Insight is given through the eyes of the Morland family into the religious, political and emotional issues at the heart of the struggle.

In the film ''[[King Ralph]]'', Ralph Jones, an American, becomes King of the United Kingdom when he is believed to be the only surviving member of the current Royal Family. Lord Percival Graves, the current heir to the throne under the Stuart line of succession, tries to have King Ralph deposed so he can take his place.

In the 1995 film [[Rob Roy (1995 film)|''Rob Roy'']], it is a minor plot element with the Scottish [[Marquis of Montrose]] ([[John Hurt]]) attempting to covertly cultivate rumours that his personal rival and fellow Scot, [[Duke of Argyll]] ([[Andrew Keir]]) is a Jacobite, much to the latter's fury.

The first two books of the [[Diana Gabaldon]] series "[[Outlander series|''Outlander'']]" focus on the causes and lead up to the final Jacobite [[Battle of Culloden]]. The continuing books involve the repercussions of English rule in Scotland and the Scottish immigrants fighting in the [[American Revolution]]. The first book was published under the title ''Cross Stitch'' in the UK.

The popular Starz TV series "Outlander", which is based on the Gabaldon series, heavily features the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]] throughout the first two seasons.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Since Henry's death, none of the Jacobite heirs have claimed the English or Scottish thrones.

'''Michael Joseph "King" Kelly''' (December 31, 1857 – November 8, 1894), also commonly known as "$10,000 Kelly," was an American [[outfielder]], [[catcher]], and [[manager (baseball)|manager]] in various professional American baseball leagues including the [[National League]], [[International Association for Professional Base Ball Players|International Association]], [[Players' League]], and the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]]. He spent the majority of his 16-season playing career with the [[Chicago White Stockings (1870–89)|Chicago White Stockings]] and the [[Boston Beaneaters]]. Kelly was a [[player-manager]] three times in his career – in 1887 for the Beaneaters, in 1890 leading the [[Boston Reds (1890–91)|Boston Reds]] to the [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] in the only season of the Players' League's existence, and in 1891 for the [[Cincinnati Kelly's Killers]] – before his retirement in 1893. He is also often credited with helping to popularize various strategies as a player such as the [[hit and run (baseball)|hit and run]], the hook slide, and the catcher's practice of backing up first base.&lt;ref name="TotalBaseball"&gt;{{cite book |last=The Editors of Total Baseball |title=Baseball:The Biographical Encyclopedia |year=2000 |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |isbn=1-892129-34-5|pages= 595–597 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In only the second vote since [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1939#The Old-Timers Committee|its creation in 1939]] the Old Timers Committee (now the Veterans' Committee) elected Kelly to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945#Old-Timers Committee|in 1945]].

In concluding where to truly give Kelly credit as an innovator, a 2004 book devoted to 19th-century rule bending in baseball—and which came close to exhaustively accounting for all contemporary reporting on various subjects—placed stress on the following: "Kelly's hook slide does sound special, and players probably tried to copy it.  Also, he seems to have been the first big leaguer to successfully cut a base (when the usually lone umpire wasn't looking), at least according to the newspaper record."  And, "Kelly could have been the first to foul off lots of pitches on purpose.  Doing so was a top trick of some Baltimore players of the 1890s.  At the turn of the century, that trick was defused when all foul balls began counting as strikes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 3: Muggsy John McGraw and the Tricksters: Baseball's Fun Age of Rule Bending |publisher=Tile Books|year=2005|pages=472|isbn=0-9725574-2-3}}, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly's [[autobiography]] ''[[Play Ball: Stories of the Ball Field|Play Ball]]'' was published while he was with the Beaneaters in 1888, the first autobiography by a baseball player; it was ghostwritten by Boston baseball writer John J. "Jack" Drohan. Kelly also became a [[vaudeville]] performer during his playing career, first performing in Boston where he would recite the now-famous baseball poem "[[Casey at the Bat]]", sometimes butchering it. Kelly's baserunning innovations are also the subject of the hit 1889 song entitled "Slide, Kelly, Slide" and a 1927 [[comedy film]] [[Slide, Kelly, Slide (film)|of the same name]].

==Early life==
Kelly was born in [[Troy, New York|Troy]], [[New York (state)|New York]]  to Michael Kelly Sr. and his wife Catharine, both [[Irish people|Irish]] [[immigrants]]. Upon the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], his father joined the [[Union Army]], and Mike likely learned to play baseball while living with his mother and younger brother James in Washington, D.C.. After the war, his ill father moved the family to [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. Kelly's parents apparently died within about five years of each other and he was orphaned by age 18.  A best guess, based on tracking Paterson city directories, is that his father died around 1871, and his mother around 1876, when Michael was 18.  According to the 1870 census, a Michael Kelly of his age was working in a silk mill in Paterson as of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2|asin=0972557415}}, pp. 15-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
By 1873, the fifteen-year-old Kelly was good enough to be invited to play baseball on [[Blondie Purcell]]'s [[amateur]] team in Paterson, which played teams throughout the [[New York metro area]], including the [[Brooklyn Atlantics]] from the [[National Association of Base Ball Players|National Association]]. From 1875 to 1877, he played three seasons as a semi-pro: in Paterson and then other cities.

In 1877, he was with the Paterson Olympics until around June 10, when he joined the Delawares of Port Jervis, N.Y. In mid-July, a Paterson paper said he had signed with a Springfield, Ohio, team after rejecting a Port Jervis offer of $70 a month. A few weeks later, Port Jervis had not played again when he signed "with the celebrated Buckeye club of Columbus, Ohio."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his big league debut in 1878 with Cincinnati.  In 1877, Kelly's friend [[Jim McCormick (pitcher)|Jim McCormick]] was signed to play for the [[Columbus Buckeyes (minor league)|Columbus Buckeyes]] of the [[International Association for Professional Base Ball Players|International Association]], and he recommended that his friend Mike be signed to be his catcher. The year after that, Kelly signed to play for the [[Cincinnati Reds (1876–1880)|Cincinnati Reds]], then known as the Red Stockings. Although the concept would come later, Mike Kelly was now a major leaguer.

==Career in Chicago==
After playing in Cincinnati for two years as an outfielder and backup catcher, Cincinnati and [[Chicago White Stockings (1870–89)|Chicago White Stockings]]  players went on a tour of California.  While there, Chicago secured him for 1880, then-Chicago Secretary [[Albert Spalding]] doing the signing.  Later from San Francisco, Kelly wrote Spalding, who was back in Chicago, "Cincinnati Club has gone back on us. Please send expenses.  Am broke." Cincinnati had fallen on hard times by 1879 and released all their players at the end of that season to save having to pay them a last paycheck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1879, Chicago was the most important city financially in the [[National League]], as it drew the best attendance for teams taking long train rides from the East Coast.
 
Kelly was now a young, good-looking man in the big city with money in his pocket. Rather than buying a house, he immediately moved into the [[Palmer House]], the loudest, brashest, most garish and, according to its literature, "fire-proof" [[hotel]] in the world.

As a member of the White Stockings, he was annually among the league leaders in most offensive categories, including leading the league in [[run (baseball)|runs]] from 1884 through 1886 (120, 124 and 155 respectively), and [[batting average|batting]] in 1884 and 1886 (.354 and .388).  One of the best defensive catchers in baseball, he was also one of the first to use a glove and wear a chest protector.  Chicago won five pennants while Kelly played for the White Stockings.

==Career in Boston==
After the 1886 season Spalding sold Kelly to the [[Boston Beaneaters]] for a then-record $10,000, after Kelly balked at returning to the club. Right before the sale, Chicago writer [[Happy Palmer]] quoted Spalding about his plans to manage Kelly: "Oh, tie him up, I guess, if he really is averse to playing here. He may have his ugly up, and I guess from the way he is holding out in his refusal to sign that that is the case. All right, though. I am willing, and if he keeps on in that spirit I’ll make him eat hay with his horses before he is much older. He has been mad long enough now, and it is pretty near time somebody was getting mad at this end of the line. One thing I can certainly predict and that is that if Mr. Mike Kelly does not sign a contract with Chicago pretty d--d quick, he will have cause to regret it. That is all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, pp. 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the sale, he became known as the "$10,000 Beauty." In 1881, actress [[Louise Montague]] had been so dubbed after winning a $10,000 contest for handsomest woman in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, pp. 121-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:King Kelly 0554fu.jpg|thumb|left|King Kelly [[cigarette card]] (Goodwin &amp; Company, 1888)]]

It was in Boston that Mike became "King" Kelly, although he was still overwhelmingly referred to as "Mike" or "The Only" in contemporaneous reporting. As a member of the Beaneaters, he continued to be a key run-producer, scoring 120 runs in 1887 and 1889. He continued to play well and was a great box office draw, but Boston didn't win any pennants. Freed from the watchful eye of Spalding and Anson, Kelly became less self-disciplined.  One day in 1888, Boston player-manager [[John Morrill]] fined him $100 for not reporting to the grounds one day. After dinner the night before, Kelly had told Morrill he was ill, and Morrill said he should still report. The ''[[Boston Herald]]'' said, "Every man on the team thinks [the $100 fine] was deserved." The ''Herald'' also said of Kelly, "At times he goes in and plays with his whole spirit, and he puts life into the team.  A sample of that was seen in yesterday's game, a game that he won for the Bostons. At other times he plays carelessly and indifferently, puts on a spirit of independence, disobeys Morrill on instructions at will, and does as he pleases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly [[manager (baseball)|managed]] and played for the [[Boston Reds (1890–91)|Boston Reds]] in the year-lived [[Players' League]] in 1890, and the Reds won the only Players' League title.
 
During the 1890 season, friends bought him a $10,000 house at [[South Hingham]], Massachusetts, about 15 miles southeast of Boston. Contributors included former umpire [[John Kelly (catcher)|John Kelly]], the owner of their New York bar; Boston fans Arthur "Hi! Hi!" Dixwell and Frank Norton, and Boston Players’ League President [[Charles A. Prince (baseball)|Charles A. Prince]] and Secretary [[Julian B. Hart]]. They contributed $300 each, about $6,000 today. Others who gave included John Graham, Jim McCormick, and captains [[Buck Ewing]] of New York and [[John Montgomery "Johnny" Ward]] of Brooklyn. The house, worth $10,000, could not be mortgaged based on the $1,100 in donations, $400 of which went for a horse and carriage, so in the winter of 1890-91, father-in-law [[John Headifen]] "came to the rescue of his (Kelly's) [sic] friends and subscribed $1800", the Boston Record said. The [[Old Colony Savings Bank]] in Plymouth then gave a matching $2,500 loan, and with that a mortgage was obtained. When he signed with Boston in August 1891, the club's directors gave him a check for $4,300 for "lifting the mortgage on his 'popular subscription' home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

The house, stable and land would be put up for sale in the spring of 1893 for unpaid taxes of $123, about $2,500 today. It also had a $2,000 mortgage left at five percent interest. In October 1893, the house would be sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, Boston National League Director [[William H. Conant]] would recall having paid, around the time of the 1891 payment, a $200 bar bill for Kelly and friends and being forwarded, on a visit to the bar later that night, another Kelly tab for $140.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
In {{baseball year|1891}}, Kelly returned to Cincinnati as the captain of a newly established [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] club there. The team was generally known as the Reds, but were also often called "[[Cincinnati Kelly's Killers|Kelly's Killers]]" in the media due to Kelly's strong presence. The team was in seventh place when it folded in mid-August, and Kelly signed with the Boston Reds, who had moved to the Association after the Players' League folded. He spent just four games with the Reds before jumping back across town to the Beaneaters to finish out the season.

After spending the {{baseball year|1892}} season with the Beaneaters, batting a career-worst .189, his contract was assigned to the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] for {{baseball year|1893}}. He played just 20 games for the Giants, batting .269 and driving in 15 runs.

Kelly's big league career ended after the 1893 season, having compiled 1357 runs, 69 [[home run]]s, 950 [[run batted in|RBI]], and a .308&amp;nbsp;batting average. Unreliable record-keeping practices of the era prevent an accurate estimate of how many [[stolen base]]s Kelly compiled over his career, but statistics kept during his later years indicate he regularly stole 50 or more bases in a season, including a high of 84 in 1887. He also managed to steal six bases in one game.

In 1894, Kelly signed with [[Albert L. Johnson]], the main benefactor of the 1890 Players' League, to play for his new minor league club in Allentown, Pa.  Days before signing him, Johnson had assumed control of the [[Allentown &amp; Lehigh Valley Traction Company]], a trolley line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the last significant comments about Kelly's baseball career, financially, while he was still alive, [[George W. Floyd]] said the following to the ''[[Chicago Times|Chicago Herald]]'' in March 1894:

"Kelly got the worst of it in every deal he made.  When he went from the Boston players' team [in 1890] to the local [association] club [in 1891] he helped that team to make over $100,000 [about $2 million today].  The club at that time was no better than fifth [not sure if that detail is relevant] and his desertion more than anything else gave the finishing blow to the brotherhood [Players’ League].  Mike was popular wherever he played.  The trouble with him was that he had no brain as he himself was concerned.  He knew enough to make money for others, but never could make anything for himself. I don’t think that his playing days are over yet, but every club in the league seems inclined to turn him down.  Mike has a great many friends in every town where baseball is played and it will be bad policy on the magnates’ [owners'] part to retire him from the game which he has adorned so long."&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-August 1894, Allentown left the Pennsylvania State League for the Eastern League and moved to Yonkers, N.Y., where Johnson also had a streetcar line. "The parting may be cruel and mercenary--but regrets--well, hardly any.  So au revoir, Mike", the ''[[Allentown City Item]]'' said. Before disbanding, Kelly failed to heed Johnson's instructions to release the players. By not releasing them, his old league was able to file a complaint with baseball's Board of Control challenging the maneuver. At a meeting in New York, the board ruled that for the next ten days, the Pennsylvania State League could claim Allentown's players. Eastern League President Pat Powers said Kelly was to blame "and President A. L. Johnson of the latter club [Allentown], who was also present, voiced the same sentiments", the New York Sun said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people = Ken Burns|title = Baseball: A Film By Ken Burns|medium = DVD|publisher = PBS Home Video|location=|date =1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Slide, Kelly, Slide! ==
[[Image:KingKellyGC.jpg|thumb|"$10,000 Kelly" baseball card (N172), ca. 1887-90]]The song, "Slide, Kelly, Slide" was America's first "pop hit" record, after its release by [[Edison Studios]], and in 1927 inspired a film version of ''[[Slide, Kelly, Slide (film)|Slide, Kelly, Slide]]''. Prior to that song, most recordings (cylinders), were [[opera]], religious or patriotic in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Appel|first=Martin|title=Slide, Kelly, Slide: The Wild Life and Times of Mike "King" Kelly}} (Lanham, Md: Scarecrow Press, 1996), pp. xii and 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly is also considered to have been the first man to popularize [[autograph]]ing, as fans pursued him on his way to the ballpark for his signature in the 1890s. Prints of a painting of him sliding into second hung in most Irish saloons in Boston, and he was among the first athletes to perform on the [[vaudeville]] stage. His own autobiography, ''[[Play Ball: Stories of the Ball Field|Play Ball]]'', was the first written by a baseball player. The book was put together by ''[[Boston Globe]]'' reporter John Drohan.

Howard W. Rosenberg's 2004 biography of Kelly dispelled any notion that Boston reporter Jake Morse had been the ghostwriter, by quoting Drohan's involvement with the book at length, including unearthing the following sentence from a biography of Drohan in an 1889 book about the Irish in Boston: "His only literary work outside of his newspaper was the preparation of M. J. Kelly's book, 'Play Ball.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 145, citing James Bernard Cullen and William Taylor Jr., The Story of the Irish in Boston, Together with Biographical Sketches of Representative Men and Noted Women (Boston: J.B. Cullen &amp; Co., 1889), 315-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaudeville career==
Kelly took up acting soon after his arrival in Boston. Fellow Boston [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elk lodge]] member and actor [[Nathaniel Carl Goodwin|Nat Goodwin]], a writer said around that time, "repeatedly urged Kelly to abandon his diamond affiliations and embrace the fascinations of stage life, Goodwin claiming that Kelly is a natural born comedian." Goodwin, a native of Boston, had been a founder of its Elks lodge in 1878. [[George W. Floyd]], Goodwin's manager and a native of nearby Quincy, was also a charter member of the lodge and one of its early directors.  Floyd was arguably the first player agent in baseball history. For example, in 1892, Floyd told the ''Chicago Herald'' that he had secured Kelly's new contract with Boston. It included a percentage of the club's earnings above $10,000. Floyd also said, "Kelly is taking the best care of himself and is well fixed.  The boodle [his money] is in the shape of gilt-edged securities and 'mammy,' as Kel affectionately terms his wife, has charge of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 43, 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1888, Kelly made his regular play debut, as Dusty Bob in [[Charles Hale Hoyt|Charles H. "Charley" Hoyt's]] "A Rag Baby." Hoyt had been a Boston baseball writer and was a Boston Elk.  A national fraternal group, the Elks were founded in the 1860s and into the mid-twentieth century had close ties to the theatrical profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of his later vaudeville career, during the off-seasons of 1892-93, which extended into the 1893 season, he appeared in January 1893 in New York at the [[Imperial Music Hall]] on West 29th Street. He was billed as "King Kelly, the Monarch of the Baseball Field." His trousers and shirt collar were too big and he buttoned his jacket wrong.  Also, his straw hat was a size too small. "It was impossible to look at this vaudeville make-up and not laugh", the New York Sun said. "Kelly laughed, too, and shook a roll of music at a lot of friends up in the private boxes." Kelly came on after two French singers of opera. Stage partner [[William Jerome|William "Billy" Jerome]] "took off his hat to him, and introduced him as 'Mr. Kelly, the famous $10,000 peach.'" They sang a parody.  Later, after reciting "Casey at the Bat", he said, according to the Sun, "I'm right at home with Casey."  Also, "It's the first time I’ve been in these clothes, and I don’t quite understand them.  Besides I’ve been over to Guttenberg [a track in New Jersey] to-day, and that is an excuse for anything that a man may do. Come and see me again. I’m obliged for your welcome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the off-season of 1893-94, Kelly performed with [[Mark Murphy (vaudeville)|Mark Murphy]] in "O'Dowd's Neighbors." Of the first city on the tour, Dover, N.J., Murphy said Kelly called it "the very first town I ever played a game of ball in out [sic] of Patsy!"  Patsy, Murphy explained, "is Kellyesque for Paterson."&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"/&gt;

==Casey at the Bat==

{{speculation|date=April 2014}}

There is an unsettled debate about whether Kelly was the model for the title character in [[Ernest Thayer|Ernest Lawrence Thayer's]] 1888 poem "Casey at the Bat." Thayer, as a baseball reporter for the San Francisco Examiner, had seen Kelly play after the 1887 season, when he was on a playing tour to San Francisco.  A "best guess" is to take Thayer at his word that he chose the name "Casey" after a non-player of Irish ancestry he once knew.  However, open to debate is who, if anyone, he modeled Casey's baseball situations after. Arguably the best big league candidate is Kelly, the most colorful, top player of the day of Irish ancestry.  Thayer, in a 1905 letter, singles out Kelly as showing "impudence" in claiming to have written the poem. If he still felt offended, Thayer may have steered later comments away from connecting Kelly to it. Cap Anson 2, the definitive biography of Kelly, states that it did not find Kelly claiming to have been the poem's author.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg_a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and cheating==
Kelly was an adept baserunner, leading the National League in runs scored three times and ranking among the league leaders in stolen bases.

His baserunning was legendary in other ways as well. His arguably most frequent brilliant play was always legitimate—a feetfirst hook slide to avoid being tagged. In 1889, Tim Murnane of the Boston Globe said nine times out of ten, Kelly will "throw himself out of the reach of the baseman, and catch the bag from the outside." Also, "Kelly is not a sprinter, but can get a great start, and this counts more than a fine slide, as a catcher is likely to be hurried when he sees the runner well on his way to a base."&lt;ref name="Rosenberg_b"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;	

Upon Kelly's death, former teammate Tom Brown said, "He originated the slide which I do now in base running, and which is very generally copied by many ball players. The scheme is to slide to the side and get out of the way of the baseman, and not dash into him in the old way. Owing to the success of Kelly's sliding the topical song [`Slide, Kelly, Slide!' by J. W. Kelly, of no relation] was written."&lt;ref name="Rosenberg_b" /&gt;

Kelly also became famous for making unusual plays. He seems to have performed most just a few times and probably made a bigger mark with verbal trickery, while catcher or coacher at first or third base. Right after his death, his longtime captain-manager in Chicago, [[Cap Anson]], said he was a "genius" as a coacher.  Apparently referring to Kelly's ability to distract opposing fielders, Anson said, "Many a run has been scored through Kelly's trickiness. He was a rattling all-around man, but his cleverest work was done behind the plate [while catching]. He was full of tricks and was never so happy as when playing a practical joke." A year later, Anson said, "Mike Kelly was the prince of base runners. I've never seen a man equal to him in that line, and he could get away with more sharp tricks than any man who ever wore a baseball uniform."&lt;ref name="Rosenberg_a" /&gt;

Kelly's uniqueness was in making four attempts to cut bases, while the then-lone [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] wasn’t looking, in the apparent first prevalent year of the trick: 1881. A methodical study of trickery in early baseball found Kelly cutting bases just a few more times over the rest of his career, and none at other times through 1886, his last year with Chicago.  From 1887 to 1893, four seems to be his number of cuts.  One was a success.  Twice he was called out.  Once he went back after being spotted.  From 1881 to 1893, the relevant years to compare, dozens of players cut bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his day, a much more common tricky play was fouling off pitches to draw a walk. Until the first years of the twentieth century, batters were generally not charged with a strike for fouling off a pitch.  Fouled-off bunts started counting as strikes in 1894, when Kelly's big league career was over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the wildest stories of his trickery were not reported contemporaneously by reporters. Perhaps the most famous play that has been wrongly credited to Kelly—at least as taking place during a game that mattered—is from around 1890.  In his 1994 ''The Rules of Baseball'', [[David Nemec]] relates the following "often-told Kelly tale" and is the rare writer to say it is either false or embellished. As cited in Rosenberg's definitive biography of Kelly, Cap Anson 2 (2004), a former teammate of Kelly, [[Charlie Bennett]], said the following after Kelly's death in 1894:

Supposedly, Kelly was not in the game when an opposing batter hit a foul fly. Seeing that catcher [[Charley Ganzel]] could not catch the ball, Kelly announced himself in and made the play. The story would have most likely been from 1889, 1891 or 1892, when Ganzel and Kelly were teammates. Bennett said, "During a game one day, [Kelly] sat on the bench and Ganzel was behind the bat [catching]. A foul fly was popped up, out of Ganzel's reach, when quick as a flash `Kel’ ran forward, ordered Ganzel out of the game, caught the ball, and then ordered the umpire to declare the batter out. [Kelly] maintained with a great deal of force, that he had as much right to order Ganzel out of the game, while a ball was in the air, as at any other time during the progress of the game. However, the decision went against him."&lt;ref name="Rosenberg_b" /&gt;

Rosenberg could not find a contemporaneous account of Kelly having done that, and it is possible he did so in an exhibition game. The closest sounding story to the above appeared right after Kelly's death, when John D. "Johnny" Foster of the ''[[Cleveland Leader]]'' wrote, "The nearest that he ever approached to downright malice in playing in Cleveland was during a game between Cleveland and Boston for the national championship when he called a Cleveland player's name as two men were running for a foul fly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 7. For a wide survey of Kelly's trickery, see the "Casting Kelly" subhead in {{cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=Howard W.|title=Cap Anson 3}}, 327-333, and 337-339.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In November 1894, Kelly died of [[pneumonia]] in Boston.  He had taken a boat there from New York to appear at the Palace Theatre with the London Gaiety Girls.  At the start of the final week of his life, an advertisement in Boston read: "Slide, Kelly, Slide. Palace Theatre. The London Gaiety Girls, Chaperoned by King Kelly, the Famous $10,000 Base Ballist."  During the week, his name was deleted when he was too ill to appear.  "He caught a slight cold on the boat from New York, but thought little of it", a writer said upon his death.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg_c"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

During that week in Boston he stayed in the Plymouth House, owned by Bill Anderson, a fellow Elk. Noticing how ill Kelly seemed, Anderson had him rest and called for a doctor.  The doctor had him taken to his private room in the hospital.  Kelly's wife and brother were notified and did not arrive in time to see him alive.  Anderson, fellow Elk John Graham and the former secretary of Boston of the Players’ League and the American Association, Julian B. Hart, were with him at the end.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg_c" /&gt;

About 7,000 people passed by the open casket.  At a benefit for widow Agnes "Aggie" [nee Headifen] a week later, some of the songs performed were "The Irish Queen", "Nothing is Too Good for the Irish" and "Poor Mick."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

George W. Floyd, a main organizer of the benefit, wired Aggie with news about the proceeds.  Days later, he presented a letter to National League owners meeting in New York. Aggie needed money, he said.  Right after adjourning a meeting, the owners pledged $1,400 to her, about $28,000 in today's dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggie, who never remarried, died in 1937 in New Brunswick, New Jersey. After Mike's death, she made her living by sewing, stopping when her eyesight failed.  Seventeen months before her death, and her health declining, she was interviewed by the New Brunswick Sunday Times.  She said Mike to her was "just an overgrown kid" and, in a reporter's paraphrase, "always eager to help a young fellow on the field [presumably a teammate], never pugnacious despite his marvelous build of 190 pounds and six feet in height [really 5'10"], and charitable to the extreme."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Mike was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 1945, there were no immediate family members to mark the occasion, as his apparently lone child had died in 1894 – after living only an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''María Fernández de Tinoco''' (22 January 1877-23 November 1961) was a [[Costa Ricans|Costa Rican]] writer and amateur archaeologist who became the [[First Ladies and Gentlemen of Costa Rica|First Lady of Costa Rica]] in 1917. Educated in England, Fernández studied archaeology, art and music before returning to Costa Rica. Involved in amateur archaeological digs and charitable works, she wrote articles for publication in local newspapers and magazines and published two novels. When her husband staged a [[coup d'état]] and was later elected [[President of Costa Rica]], she served as [[First Lady]] from 8 June 1917 to 20 August 1919. When he resigned from his post due to mismanagement, the couple moved to Paris, where she participated in archeological and artistic works until his death in 1931. From 1932 to 1934, she resided in Norway before returning to Costa Rica, where she resumed her archeological studies and publishing, while working for the [[National Museum of Costa Rica]]. Involved with the Red Cross, she was awarded the [[Florence Nightingale Medal]] in 1949 and in 2012, the Ministry of Culture of Costa Rica produced a documentary about her life.

==Early life==
María de las Mercedes Elodia Fernández Le Cappellain, known as Mimita, was born on 22 January 1877 in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], Costa Rica to Ada Le Cappellain Agnew and [[Mauro Fernández Acuña]]. She was the second of the couple's seven children.{{sfn|Sáenz Carbonell|Fernández Alfaro|Muñoz Castro de Fernández Silva|2001}}{{sfn|Víquez Guzmán|2009}} Her father was a politician and was involved in the creation of the first secondary school for women in Costa Rica, having hired his sister-in-law, [[Marian Le Cappellain]] to found the school.{{sfn|Molina Jiménez|Palmer|2003|p=92}} Both Ada and her sister Marian were natives of the [[Channel Islands]], grew up on [[Guernsey]], and had previously taught in Costa Rica.{{sfn|Murchie|1981|p=205}} After studying with Juanita Acuña, Fernández completed her education abroad in England, studying archaeology, art and music.{{sfn|Sáenz Carbonell|Fernández Alfaro|Muñoz Castro de Fernández Silva|2001}}{{sfn|Víquez Guzmán|2009}} She returned to Costa Rica and on 5 June 1898 in San José, married [[Federico Tinoco Granados|Federico Alberto de Jesús Tinoco Granados]]. Federico's family were friends of her parents, and like Fernández, he had been educated abroad.{{sfn|Sáenz Carbonell|Fernández Alfaro|Muñoz Castro de Fernández Silva|2001}}

==Career==
While husband became involved in politics, Fernández de Tinoco became involved as one of the founding members of the [[Theosophical Society]] in 1904. She was interested in learning about and exploring indigenous cultures{{sfn|Sáenz Carbonell|Fernández Alfaro|Muñoz Castro de Fernández Silva|2001}} and began making amateur archaeological digs on the family farm. One such dig in 1907, led her to conceive of the plot for a novel.{{sfn|Solera|1987|p=283}} In 1909, under the pseudonym Apaikán{{sfn|Sáenz Carbonell|Fernández Alfaro|Muñoz Castro de Fernández Silva|2001}} published two works ''Yontá'' and ''Zulai'' in a single volume. The novels were the first works by a Costa Rican author to focus on indigenous people. ''Yontá'' gives the background story for ''Zulai'', though it was written last. Both are based on theosophical themes and deal with the sentimental entanglement of two generations of lovers. In ''Yontá'', the main character's name, an indigenous woman meets a mystic from India who brings eastern rituals and religion to the Americas. The couple produce a son, Ivo, who in the second book, ''Zulai'', falls in love with Zulai. Their love is tragically doomed by the jealousy of the ''[[cacique]]s''. {{sfn|Solera|1987|pp=282–283}}

In addition to the novels, Fernández de Tinoco published other scholarly works on archaeology{{sfn|Solera|1987|p=282}} and was a collaborator with [[Ángela Acuña Braun]] in the journal ''Fígaro'', which had been founded in 1914.{{sfn|Rodríguez S.|2004|p=10}} She also devoted time to charitable endeavors, such as co-founding the Costa Rican branch of ''La Gota de Leche'' (A Drop of Milk) and ''El Abrigo de los Niñoswas'' (The Children's Shelter) in 1913 and becoming involved in 1915 with the first Boy Scout Troop of Costa Rica.{{sfn|Sáenz Carbonell|Fernández Alfaro|Muñoz Castro de Fernández Silva|2001}} She published articles on a variety of subjects in newspapers, including the ''Diario de Costa Rica'', ''La Hora'', and ''La República'', and magazines like ''Repertorio Americano'' and ''Revista de Archivos Nacionales''.{{sfn|Meza Márquez|2011|pp=82–83}}

On 27 January 1917, Fernández de Tinoco's husband, Federico, staged a [[coup d'état]] overthrowing the presidency of [[Alfredo González Flores]] and in the elections that followed in April, he was elected president. When his term began on 8 June 1917, Fernández de Tinoco became the [[First Ladies and Gentlemen of Costa Rica|First Lady of Costa Rica]], acting as the hostess of numerous banquets, receptions and public ceremonies, on behalf of her husband. She continued her charitable works, establishing the Children's Commissary of San José ({{lang-es|Children's Commissary of San José}} and was involved with the Costa Rican branch of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]]. Abuses and mistakes in her husband's government forced her husband to resign on 20 August 1919. The couple fled the country, traveling by way of [[Jamaica]] to Paris.{{sfn|Sáenz Carbonell|Fernández Alfaro|Muñoz Castro de Fernández Silva|2001}}

In France, Fernández de Tinoco joined a group of archaeologists and continued to participate in the field. She also served as an assistant to launch the Exhibition of Aboriginal Art of Spanish America, held in 1928 in Paris. When her husband died in 1931, she moved to [[Oslo]], where her sister Ada, and brother-in-law, Antonio J. de Amaral Murtinho, were living. She attended a reception for Lord [[Baden Powell]], founder of the Boy Scouts, held in Oslo in 1932, but within two years, decided to return home to Costa Rica.{{sfn|Sáenz Carbonell|Fernández Alfaro|Muñoz Castro de Fernández Silva|2001}} 

Taking a position with the [[National Museum of Costa Rica]], Fernández de Tinoco, undertook archaeological expeditions throughout the country for the next six years.{{sfn|Sáenz Carbonell|Fernández Alfaro|Muñoz Castro de Fernández Silva|2001}} One of these expeditions made in 1935, to [[Chira Island]] was discussed in a paper ''Chira, la olvidada cuna de aguerridas tribus precolombinas'' (Chira, the forgotten cradle of warlike pre-Columbian tribes) and another ''Una ocarina huetar de 18 notas del Museo Nacional de Costa 
Rica'' (An [[ocarina]] of the Huetar people with eighteen notes in the National Museum of Costa Rica).{{sfn|Meza Márquez|2011|p=82}} She also worked as a teacher and then briefly lived in [[Rio de Janeiro]], where her sister Ada and her family had been transferred when their time in Oslo ended. Between 1943 and 1946, she lived in [[Winona, Minnesota]] with a friend, Harriet Buck and spent time working with the [[American Red Cross]]{{sfn|Sáenz Carbonell|Fernández Alfaro|Muñoz Castro de Fernández Silva|2001}} and in 1949, Fernández de Tinoco was awarded the [[Florence Nightingale Medal]].{{sfn|Sáenz Carbonell|Fernández Alfaro|Muñoz Castro de Fernández Silva|2001}}{{sfn|Víquez Guzmán|2009}} She participated as a delegate for Costa Rica in the August 1946 International Conference of Archaeologists, which was held in Honduras and in 1950, helped in the organization of the Central American Art Exhibition held in Panama. After this time, she began to have heart problems and slowly withdrew from public activities.{{sfn|Sáenz Carbonell|Fernández Alfaro|Muñoz Castro de Fernández Silva|2001}}

==Death and legacy==
Fernández de Tinoco died on 23 November 1961 in San José, Costa Rica.{{sfn|Sáenz Carbonell|Fernández Alfaro|Muñoz Castro de Fernández Silva|2001}} In 2012, a documentary, ''La ocarina de Cuesta de Moras'' (The ocarina of the Cuesta de Moras, which is the address of the National Museum and a play on the title of her 1937 article on the ocarina) was produced by the Ministry of Culture and Youth, detailing the life story of Fernández de Tinoco.{{sfn|''National Museum of Costa Rica''|2012}}

'''Minoritarianism''' is a [[neologism]] for a political structure or process in which a minority segment of a population has a certain degree of primacy in that entity's [[decision making]].&lt;ref&gt; https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/Fhu5gJzl3u4LwuErXoJxFO/Majority-minority-authority.html&lt;/ref&gt; Minoritarianism may be contrasted with [[majoritarianism]], but with legislative power being held or controlled by a minority group rather than the majority.

==Concept in depth==
Minoritarianism is most often applied disparagingly to processes in which a minority is able to block legislative changes through [[supermajority]] threshold requirements.  For example, if a 2/3 vote in favor is required to enact a new law, a minority of greater than 1/3 is said to have "minoritarian" powers.

Even in the case where minority control is nominally limited to blocking the majority with [[veto]] power (whether as a result of a supermajority requirement or a consensus process), this may result in the situation where the minority retains effective control over the group's agenda and the nature of the proposals submitted to the group, as the majority will not propose ideas that they know the minority will veto.

Critics of this use of ''minoritarianism'' argue that the ability to block legislation is substantially different from the ability to enact new legislation against the will of the majority, making the analogy to unpopular "dominant minority rule" examples inappropriate.

Minoritarianism is sometimes used to describe rule by a [[dominant minority]] such as an [[ethnic group]] delineated by [[religion]], [[language]] or some other identifying factor.  Historical examples included [[Rhodesia]] (now called [[Zimbabwe]]) under [[Ian Smith]] and [[South Africa under apartheid]] rule and some would say after apartheid rule.&lt;ref&gt;http://johnpilger.com/articles/south-africa-20-years-of-apartheid-by-another-name [[John Pilger]] Apartheid by another name&lt;/ref&gt;

Minoritarianism may also be used to describe some cases where appeasement of [[minorities]] by [[Votebank|votebank politics]] is practiced.  Examples include, but are not limited to, Indian Muslims, Jewish Americans, and Francophone Canadians.

==In small deliberative groups==
Supermajority decision threshold requirements are often found in small deliberative groups where these requirements are sometimes adopted in an attempt to increase protection of varied interests within the group.  The requirements may be formally stated or may be unstated (for example, when an organization is described as having a "consensus culture").  

A common criticism of [[consensus decision-making]] is that it can lead to a situation wherein a minority can block the will of the majority.  Consensus advocates argue that this is a good feature&amp;mdash;that ''no action'' is preferable to one without the consensus support of the group.

Attempts to resolve the dilemma through formal supermajority standards are generally discouraged by parliamentary authorities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people have mistakenly assumed that the higher the vote required to take an action, the greater the protection of the members. Instead the opposite is true. Whenever a vote of more than a majority is required to take an action, control is taken from the majority and given to the minority. ... The higher the vote required, the smaller the minority to which control passes. &lt;br/&gt;
— from "The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure" by [[Alice Sturgis]]&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5THFbCnDdbIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The institution hosts historical monuments dating back through preserved ancient and medieval Iranian antiquities, including pottery vessels, metal objects, textile remains, and some rare books and coins.&lt;ref name="National Museum of Iran"&gt;[http://www.otraq.com/showlandmark.aspx?landmark=National+Museum+of+Iran&amp;city=Tehran "Otraq.com, Iran's Tourism Guide"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020115136/http://www.otraq.com/showlandmark.aspx?landmark=National+Museum+of+Iran&amp;city=Tehran |date=2014-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes a number of research departments, categorized by different historical periods and archaeological topics.

==History==
[[File:Teheran entree musee national.jpg|thumb|The entrance of the Museum of Ancient Iran, part of the National Museum of Iran.]]

The brick building of the Museum of Ancient Iran was designed by French architects [[André Godard]] and [[Maxime Siroux]] in the early 20th century, and was influenced by [[Sasanian architecture|Sassanian]] vaults, particularly the [[Taq Kasra]] at [[Ctesiphon]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Isenstadt, Kishwar Rizvi. ''Modernism and the Middle East: Architecture and Politics in the Twentieth Century. Studies in Modernity and National Identity''. University of Washington Press, 2011. {{ISBN|0295800305}} pp.14&lt;/ref&gt; Its construction, with an area of about {{convert|11000|m2|sqyd}}, began in 1935 and was completed within two years by Abbas Ali Memar and Morad Tabrizi. It was then officially inaugurated in 1937.

[[File:موزهٔ ایران باستان -موزه دوران اسلامی.JPG|left|thumb|Museum of the Islamic Era, part of the National Museum of Iran.]]
The Museum of Islamic Era was later built with white [[travertine]] on the grassy grounds of the Museum of Ancient Iran. It has gone through quite a few hasty interior changes, and was still being remodeled when the [[1979 Revolution]] swept the country.

While the Museum of Ancient Iran always had a clear mandate to show archaeological relics, as well as some rare medieval textiles and rug pieces, the newer complex began to also feature the exquisite [[Amlash culture|Amlash]] pottery from prehistoric [[Caspian Sea]] regions of Iran. This followed some modern works, and the repeated gutting and remodeling of the interior.

The Museum of Ancient Iran consists of two floors. Its halls contain artifacts and fossils from the Lower, Middle, and Upper [[Paleolithic]], as well as the [[Neolithic]], [[Chalcolithic]], early and late [[Bronze Age]], and [[Iron Age]]s I-III, through the [[Medes|Median]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]], [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]], and [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian]] eras.

The newer complex consists of three floors. It contains various pieces of pottery, textiles, texts, artworks, astrolabes, and adobe [[calligraphy]], from Iran's [[History of Iran#Medieval Iran|post-classical era]].

==Collections==
The oldest artifacts kept at the museum are from [[Kashafrud]], [[Darband Cave|Darband]], and  Shiwatoo, which date back to the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period. [[Mousterian]] stone tools made by [[Neanderthal]]s are also on display at the first hall of the Museum of Ancient Iran. The most important Upper Paleolithic tools are from [[Yafteh]], dating back about 30,000 to 35,000 years. There are also 9,000-year-old human and animal figurines from Sarab mound in [[Kermanshah Province|Kermanshah]], among many other ancient artifacts.

==Exhibitions==
The ground floor of the newer complex has been dedicated to contemporary exhibitions. Temporary exhibition galleries are featured two or three times annually, and usually run for about one to two months. One of the most successful exhibitions, entitled ''Evidence for Two Hundred Thousand Years of Human-Animal Bonds in Iran'', ran from August to October 2014.&lt;ref name="The Guardian's report about exhibition"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2014/nov/14/-sp-iran-archeology-national-museum-tourism "The Guardian's report about exhibition"]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was mainly about the relation and coexistence of past human societies and various animal species in Iran, since the late Lower Paleolithic to modern decades.

'''Norrköping''' ({{IPA-sv|²nɔrːˌɕøːpɪŋ}}) is a [[Urban areas in Sweden|city]] in the [[provinces of Sweden|province]] of [[Östergötland]] in eastern [[Sweden]] and the seat of [[Norrköping Municipality]], [[Östergötland County]], about 160&amp;nbsp;km southwest of the national capital [[Stockholm]]. The city has a population of 95,618 inhabitants in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Population in localities increased by 120 000|url=https://www.scb.se/en/finding-statistics/statistics-by-subject-area/environment/land-use/localities-areas-population/pong/statistical-news/population-in-localities/|website=Statistiska Centralbyrån|accessdate=15 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; out of a municipal total of 130,050,&lt;ref name="SCB"&gt;[http://www.scb.se/Pages/TableAndChart____308469.aspx Folkmängd i Norrköpings kommun den 31 December 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903211116/http://www.scb.se/Pages/TableAndChart____308469.aspx |date=3 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it Sweden's tenth largest city and eighth largest municipality.

The city is situated by the mouth of the river [[Motala ström]], at [[Bråviken]], an inlet of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Water power from the Motala ström and the good [[harbour]] were factors that facilitated the rapid growth of this once industrial city, known for its [[textile]] industry. It has several nicknames such as: "Sweden's [[Manchester]]", "[[Peking]]" and "Surbullestan" (Surbulle [sour bun] was a local nickname for the textile workers, and stan is short for Staden, which means The City or The Town in Swedish).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==History==
The city has [[medieval]] foundations by [[settler]]s around the Norrköping twin city with Linköping Motala stream estuary, who used the falls and rapids to power their mills. The stream was also full of fish such as [[salmon]]. Exact dates are uncertain, but there are mentions of a [[Church (building)|church]] in the 12th century. It was dedicated to [[Saint Olaf]], Norway's [[patron]].

The first trace of the city's name is from 1283, when [[Sophia of Denmark]] donated her rights of salmon fishing to the [[Skänninge]] monastery. The town is estimated to have received [[city status in Sweden|city status]] in the early 14th century, although no written documents exist prior to a document from 1384. This document, signed by [[Albrekt of Sweden]] is stored in the city archive today. [[Köping]] means there was a market there, while Nörr or Norr means "north". There is a smaller town nearby named [[Söderköping]], or "South market".

The city was the location of several battles in the ensuing centuries. As a consequence, nothing of the medieval Norrköping remains today. During the [[Northern Seven Years' War]] (1563–1570), the entire southern part of Norrköping was burnt. It was rebuilt by [[John III of Sweden]], who designed the current street pattern.

In 1618, a weapon industry was established by supervision of [[Gustavus Adolphus]]. The harbour also attracted ships due to its proximity to the industries of [[Finspång]]. In addition to the weapon industry, a large scale industry of [[textile]] was also initiated. An important benefactor was the industrial man [[Louis De Geer (1587–1652)]]. At De Geer's death, Norrköping had 6,000 inhabitants and was Sweden's second largest city.

The city again burnt in 1655, and again in 1719 during the [[Russian Pillage of 1719-21]] when the Russians burnt it to the ground. Stones from the Johannisborg castle were used to build new houses, and today only a few stones remain.

During the 18th century it was rebuilt and several industries soon got a stronghold: In the 1740s, Norrköping boasted three [[sugar refineries]]; in the 1750s the large scale influential [[snus]] industry was established. From this time stems the city churches of Saint Olof and Saint Hedvig, and several other old houses. In 1762, the first theater in Sweden outside of Stockholm was established in the city, the [[Egges Teater]].
[[File:Norrköping 1876.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Norrköping in 1876.]]
Norrköping's importance again flourished. In 1769 the Swedish [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]] assembled there. In 1800 King [[Gustav IV of Sweden]] was crowned in the Church of Saint Olof.

In the later 18th and early 19th Centuries, Norrköping was one of the three Swedish cities where [[History of the Jews in Sweden|Jews]] were allowed to live (see [[History of the Jews in Sweden]]).

The city again suffered fires in 1822 and 1826. Thereafter wooden houses were banned. In 1841 a ship industry was initiated as a branch of [[Motala Verkstad]] in [[Motala]]. In 1850 the industry had over 600 employees making it Sweden's largest ship industry at the time. During the remaining 19th century, the industries kept expanding. The area by the Motala Stream was developed further with the construction of a [[cotton]] refinery, and a [[paper mill]] was constructed in 1854, specializing in newspaper, and is still today exporting to customers around the world.

The industry, including textile manufacturers, also expanded into the 20th century. In 1950 a total of 54 factories had 6,600 employees in town. By 1956, however, 18 of them had been closed due to competition from countries abroad with lower wages, such as [[Italy]] and [[Japan]]. In 1970 only 10 factories and 1,200 employees remained. In that year, the renowned [[Holmen (company)|Holmen]] paper mill, with its 350 years long history, announced closure, and another 900 people were let go{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. To counter the effects, several governmental authorities were relocated to Norrköping from [[Stockholm]]. See also [[Braviken Paper Mill]].

As of 2002, Norrköping is now seeing a revival, as a center of culture and education. The Norrköping symbol represents the "new" Norrköping.

== Climate==
Norrköping had a [[humid continental climate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=17520&amp;cityname=Norrkoping%2C+Sweden&amp;units=|title=Climate Summary for Norrkoping, Sweden|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the reference period of 1961–1990, but it was borderline four-season [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] during that period and has since more resembled the latter, with somewhat warmer temperatures year-round. In spite of it being located near the [[Baltic Sea]], Norrköping has a relatively dry climate with precipitation levels averaging {{convert|508.2|mm|in}} between 1961 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month_year/normal_1961_1990/SMHI_month_year_normal_61_90_precipitation_mm.txt|title=Monthly Normal Precipitation 1961–1990 (Swedish)|publisher=SMHI|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That would in turn be very low for a marine climate, but some way above more arid climates. The humidity for most of the year combined with there being no pronounced dry season keeps the surroundings green in spite of the rain shadow effect. Winter precipitation is quite low, but often falls as snow. On August 26, 2016, Norrköping set a nationwide record for the hottest temperature in the latter parts of August with {{convert|32.7|C|F}} during a sudden and brief burst of extreme heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smhi.se/bloggar/vaderleken-2-3336/rekordsent-datum-for-arets-hogsta-temperatur-nastan-1.108086|title=Record late date for the annual highest temperature (almost)|language=sv|date=29 August 2016|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA notice}}
A '''phoneme''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|oʊ|n|iː|m}}) is one of the units of sound (or gesture in the case of sign languages, see [[chereme]]) that distinguish one word from another in a particular language. For example, in most dialects of English, the sound patterns {{IPAc-en|θ|ʌ|m}} (''thumb'') and {{IPAc-en|d|ʌ|m}} (''dumb'') are two separate words distinguished by the substitution of one phoneme, {{IPA|/θ/}}, for another phoneme, {{IPA|/d/}}. (Two words like this that differ in meaning through a contrast of a single phoneme form what is called a ''[[minimal pair]]''). In many other languages these would be interpreted as exactly the same set of phonemes (i.e. {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} would be considered the same).

In [[linguistics]], phonemes ([[#without-mps|usually]] established by the use of minimal pairs, such as ''kill'' vs ''kiss'' or ''pat'' vs ''bat'') are written between slashes, e.g. {{IPA|/p/}}. To show pronunciation more precisely linguists use square brackets, for example {{IPA|[pʰ]}} (indicating an [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] ''p'').

Within linguistics there are differing views as to exactly what phonemes are and how a given language should be analyzed in ''phonemic'' (or ''phonematic'') terms. However, a phoneme is generally regarded as an [[abstraction]] of a set (or [[equivalence class]]) of speech sounds (''[[Phone (phonetics)|phones]]''[[Bracket|)]] which are perceived as equivalent to each other in a given language. For example, in English, the ''k'' sounds in the words ''kit'' and ''skill'' are not identical (as described [[#Assignment of speech sounds to phonemes|below]]), but they are distributional variants of a single phoneme {{IPA|/k/}}. Different speech sounds that are realizations of the same phoneme are known as [[allophone]]s. Allophonic variation may be conditioned, in which case a certain phoneme is realized as a certain allophone in particular phonological environments, or it may be free in which case it may vary randomly. In this way, phonemes are often considered to constitute an abstract [[underlying representation]] for segments of words, while speech sounds make up the corresponding [[phonetic]] realization, or surface form.

==Notation==
Phonemes are conventionally placed between [[slash (punctuation)|slash]]es in transcription, whereas speech sounds (phones) are placed between [[square bracket]]s. Thus {{IPA|/pʊʃ/}} represents a sequence of three phonemes {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/ʊ/}}, {{IPA|/ʃ/}} (the word ''push'' in standard English), while {{IPA|[pʰʊʃ]}} represents the phonetic sequence of sounds {{IPA|[pʰ]}} ([[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] ''p''), {{IPA|[ʊ]}}, {{IPA|[ʃ]}} (the usual pronunciation of ''push''). This is not to be confused with the similar convention of the use of [[angle bracket]]s to enclose the units of [[orthography]], namely [[grapheme]]s; for example, ⟨f⟩ represents the written letter (grapheme) ''f''.

The symbols used for particular phonemes are often taken from the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), the same set of symbols that are most commonly used for phones. (For computer typing purposes, systems such as [[X-SAMPA]] and [[Kirshenbaum]] exist to represent IPA symbols using only [[ASCII]] characters.) However, descriptions of particular languages may use different conventional symbols to represent the phonemes of those languages. For languages whose writing systems employ the [[phonemic principle]], ordinary letters may be used to denote phonemes, although this approach is often hampered by the complexity of the relationship between orthography and pronunciation (see [[#Correspondence between letters and phonemes|Correspondence between letters and phonemes]] below).

==Assignment of speech sounds to phonemes==
[[File:Phoneme-allophone-determination-chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|A simplified procedure for determining whether two sounds represent the same or different phonemes]]
A phoneme is a sound or a group of different sounds perceived to have the same function by speakers of the language or dialect in question. An example is the [[English language|English]] phoneme {{IPA|/k/}}, which occurs in words such as '''''c'''at'', '''''k'''it'', ''s'''c'''at'', ''s'''k'''it''. Although most native speakers do not notice this, in most English dialects the "c/k" sounds in these words are not identical: in {{audio|en-us-kit.ogg|''kit''}} {{IPA-all|kʰɪt|}} the sound is [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]], while in {{audio|en-us-skill.ogg|''skill''}} {{IPA-all|skɪl|}} it is unaspirated. The words therefore contain different ''speech sounds'', or ''[[Phone (phonetics)|phones]]'', transcribed {{IPA|[kʰ]}} for the aspirated form, {{IPA|[k]}} for the unaspirated one. These different sounds are nonetheless considered to belong to the same phoneme, because if a speaker used one instead of the other, the meaning of the word would not change: using the aspirated form {{IPA|[kʰ]}} in ''skill'' might sound odd, but the word would still be recognized. By contrast, some other sounds would cause a change in meaning if substituted: for example, substitution of the sound {{IPA|[t]}} would produce the different word ''s'''t'''ill'', and that sound must therefore be considered to represent a different phoneme (the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}}).

The above shows that in English {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[kʰ]}} are [[allophones]] of a single phoneme {{IPA|/k/}}. In some languages, however, {{IPA|[kʰ]}} and {{IPA|[k]}} are perceived by native speakers as different sounds, and substituting one for the other can change the meaning of a word; this means that in those languages, the two sounds represent different phonemes. For example, in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], {{IPA|[kʰ]}} is the first sound of ''kátur'' meaning "cheerful", while {{IPA|[k]}} is the first sound of ''gátur'' meaning "riddles". Icelandic therefore has two separate phonemes {{IPA|/kʰ/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}.

===Minimal pairs===
A pair of words like ''kátur'' and ''gátur'' (above) that differ only in one phone is called a [[minimal pair]] for the two alternative phones in question (in this case, {{IPA|[kʰ]}} and {{IPA|[k]}}). The existence of minimal pairs is a common test to decide whether two phones represent different phonemes or are allophones of the same phoneme. To take another example, the minimal pair '''''t'''ip'' and '''''d'''ip'' illustrates that in English, {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}} belong to separate phonemes, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}; since these two words have different meanings, English speakers must be conscious of the distinction between the two sounds.  In other languages, though, including [[Korean language|Korean]], even though both sounds {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}} occur, no such minimal pair exists. The lack of minimal pairs distinguishing {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}} in Korean provides evidence that in this language they are allophones of a single phoneme {{IPA|/t/}}. The word {{IPA|/tata/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[tada]}}, for example.  That is, when they hear this word, Korean speakers perceive the same sound in both the beginning and middle of the word, whereas an English speaker would perceive different sounds in these two locations. Signed languages, such as American Sign Language (ASL), also have minimal pairs, differing only in (exactly) one of the signs' parameters: handshape, movement, location, palm orientation, and non-manual signal or marker. A minimal pair may exist in the signed language if the basic sign stays the same but one of these parameters changes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=109|title=Minimal pairs in sign language phonology|last=Handspeak|first=|date=|website=www.handspeak.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214003747/http://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=109|archivedate=14 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|without-mps}}However, the absence of minimal pairs for a given pair of phones does not always mean that they belong to the same phoneme: they may be too dissimilar phonetically for it to be likely that speakers perceive them as the same sound. For example, English has no minimal pair for the sounds {{IPA|[h]}} (as in '''''h'''at'') and {{IPA|[ŋ]}} (as in ''ba'''ng'''''), and the fact that they can be shown to be in [[complementary distribution]] could be used to argue for their being allophones of the same phoneme. However, they are so dissimilar phonetically that they are considered separate phonemes.{{sfn|Wells|1982|p=44}}

Phonologists have sometimes had recourse to "near minimal pairs" to show that speakers of the language perceive two sounds as significantly different even if no exact minimal pair exists in the lexicon. It is virtually impossible to find a minimal pair to distinguish English {{IPAc-en|ʃ}} from {{IPAc-en|ʒ}}, yet it seems uncontroversial to claim that the two consonants are distinct phonemes. The two words 'pressure' {{IPAc-en|p|r|ɛ|ʃ|ər}} and 'pleasure' {{IPAc-en|p|l|ɛ|ʒ|ər}} can serve as a near minimal pair.{{sfn|Wells|1982|p=48}}

==Other features with phonemic status==
While phonemes are normally conceived of as abstractions of discrete [[Segment (linguistics)|segmental]] speech sounds (vowels and consonants), there are other features of pronunciation – principally [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] – which in some languages can change the meaning of words in the way that phoneme contrasts do, and are consequently called ''phonemic'' features of those languages.

''Phonemic stress'' is encountered in languages such as English. For example, the word ''invite'' stressed on the second syllable is a verb, but when stressed on the first syllable (without changing any of the individual sounds) it becomes a noun. The position of the stress in the word affects the meaning, and therefore a full phonemic specification (providing enough detail to enable the word to be pronounced unambiguously) would include indication of the position of the stress: {{IPA|/ɪnˈvaɪ̯t/}} for the verb, {{IPA|/ˈɪnvaɪt/}} for the noun. In other languages, such as [[French language|French]], word stress cannot have this function (its position is generally predictable) and is therefore not phonemic (and is not usually indicated in dictionaries).

''Phonemic tones'' are found in languages such as [[Mandarin Chinese]], in which a given syllable can have five different tonal pronunciations.

|-
|}Here, the character 媽 (pronounced ''mā'', high level pitch) means "mother"; 麻 (''má'', rising pitch) means "hemp"; 馬 (''mǎ'', falling then rising) means "horse"; 罵 (''mà'', falling) means "scold", and 嗎 (''ma'', neutral tone) is an [[interrogative particle]]. The tone "phonemes" in such languages are sometimes called ''tonemes''. Languages such as English do not have phonemic tone, although they use [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] for functions such as emphasis and attitude.

==Distribution of allophones==
When a phoneme has more than one [[allophone]], the one actually heard at a given occurrence of that phoneme may be dependent on the phonetic environment (surrounding sounds) – allophones which normally cannot appear in the same environment are said to be in [[complementary distribution]]. In other cases the choice of allophone may be dependent on the individual speaker or other unpredictable factors – such allophones are said to be in [[free variation]].

==Background and related ideas==
The term ''phonème'' (from [[Ancient Greek]] φώνημα  ''phōnēma'', "sound made, utterance, thing spoken, speech, language"&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"&gt;Liddell, H.G. &amp; Scott, R. (1940). ''A Greek-English Lexicon. revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones. with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;) was reportedly first used by [[A. Dufriche-Desgenettes]] in 1873, but it referred only to a speech sound. The term ''phoneme'' as an [[abstraction]] was developed by the Polish linguist [[Jan Niecisław Baudouin de Courtenay]] and his student [[Mikołaj Kruszewski]] during 1875–1895.{{sfn|Jones|1957}} The term used by these two was ''fonema'', the basic unit of what they called ''psychophonetics''. [[Daniel Jones (phonetician)|Daniel Jones]] became the first linguist in the western world to use the term ''phoneme'' in its current sense, employing the word in his article "The phonetic structure of the Sechuana Language".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, D. (1917), The phonetic structure of the Sechuana language, Transactions of the Philological Society 1917-20, pp. 99–106&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the phoneme was then elaborated in the works of [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]] and others of the [[Prague School]] (during the years 1926–1935), and in those of [[structuralism|structuralist]]s like [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Edward Sapir]], and [[Leonard Bloomfield]]. Some structuralists (though not Sapir) rejected the idea of a cognitive or psycholinguistic function for the phoneme.{{sfn|Twaddell|1935}}{{sfn|Harris|1951}}

Later, it was used and redefined in [[generative linguistics]], most famously by [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Morris Halle]],{{sfn|Chomsky|Halle|1968}} and remains central to many accounts of the development of modern [[phonology]]. As a theoretical concept or model, though, it has been supplemented and even replaced by others.{{sfn|Clark|Yallop|1995|loc=chpt. 11}}

Some linguists (such as [[Roman Jakobson]] and [[Morris Halle]]) proposed that phonemes may be further decomposable into [[distinctive feature|feature]]s, such features being the true minimal constituents of language.{{sfn|Jakobson|Halle|1968}} Features overlap each other in time, as do [[suprasegmental]] phonemes in oral language and many phonemes in sign languages. Features could be characterized in different ways: Jakobson and colleagues defined them in [[acoustic phonetics|acoustic]] terms,{{sfn|Jakobson|Fant|Halle|1952}} Chomsky and Halle used a predominantly [[articulatory phonetics|articulatory]] basis, though retaining some acoustic features, while [[Peter Ladefoged|Ladefoged]]'s system{{sfn|Ladefoged|2006|pp=268–276}} is a purely articulatory system apart from the use of the acoustic term 'sibilant'.

In the description of some languages, the term [[chroneme]] has been used to indicate contrastive length or ''duration'' of phonemes. In languages in which [[tone (linguistics)|tones]] are phonemic, the tone phonemes may be called [[toneme]]s. Though not all scholars working on such languages use these terms, they are by no means obsolete.

By analogy with the phoneme, linguists have proposed other sorts of underlying objects, giving them names with the suffix ''-eme'', such as ''[[morpheme]]'' and ''[[grapheme]]''. These are sometimes called [[emic unit]]s. The latter term was first used by [[Kenneth Pike]], who also generalized the concepts of [[emic unit|emic and etic]] description (from ''phonemic'' and ''phonetic'' respectively) to applications outside linguistics.{{sfn|Pike|1967}}

==Restrictions on occurrence==
{{main|Phonotactics}}
Languages do not generally allow words or [[syllable]]s to be built of any arbitrary sequences of phonemes; there are [[phonotactics|phonotactic]] restrictions on which sequences of phonemes are possible and in which environments certain phonemes can occur. Phonemes that are significantly limited by such restrictions may be called ''restricted phonemes''.

In English, examples of such restrictions include:

* {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, as in ''si'''ng''''', occurs only at the end of a syllable, never at the beginning (in many other languages, such as [[Māori language|Māori]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], and [[Thai language|Thai]], {{IPA|/ŋ/}} can appear word-initially).
* {{IPA|/h/}} occurs only before vowels and at the beginning of a syllable, never at the end (a few languages, such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], or [[Romanian Language|Romanian]] allow {{IPA|/h/}} syllable-finally).
* In [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic dialects]], {{IPA|/ɹ/}} can only occur immediately before a vowel, never before a consonant.
* {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} occur only before a vowel, never at the end of a syllable (except in interpretations where a word like ''boy'' is analyzed as {{IPA|/bɔj/}}).

Some phonotactic restrictions can alternatively be analyzed as cases of neutralization. See [[#Neutralization and archiphonemes|Neutralization and archiphonemes]] below, particularly the example of the occurrence of the three English nasals before stops.

==Biuniqueness==
'''Biuniqueness''' is a requirement of classic [[structuralism (linguistics)|structuralist]] phonemics. It means that a given [[phone (phonetics)|phone]], wherever it occurs, must unambiguously be assigned to one and only one phoneme. In other words, the mapping between phones and phonemes is required to be many-to-one rather than [[many-to-many]]. The notion of biuniqueness was controversial among some pre-[[generative linguistics|generative]] linguists and was prominently challenged by [[Morris Halle]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

An example of the problems arising from the biuniqueness requirement is provided by the phenomenon of [[flapping]] in [[North American English]]. This may cause either {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}} (in the appropriate environments) to be realized with the phone {{IPA|[ɾ]}} (an [[alveolar flap]]). For example, the same flap sound may be heard in the words ''hi'''tt'''ing'' and ''bi'''dd'''ing'', although it is clearly intended to realize the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}} in the first word and {{IPA|/d/}} in the second. This appears to contradict biuniqueness.

For further discussion of such cases, see the next section.

=={{anchor|Neutralization}}Neutralization and archiphonemes==
{{no references|section|date=June 2018}}
Phonemes that are contrastive in certain environments may not be contrastive in all environments. In the environments where they do not contrast, the contrast is said to be '''neutralized'''. In these positions it may become less clear which phoneme a given phone represents. Some [[phonology|phonologists]] prefer not to specify a unique phoneme in such cases, since to do so would mean providing redundant or even arbitrary information – instead they use the technique of [[underspecification]]. An '''archiphoneme''' is an object sometimes used to represent an underspecified phoneme.

An example of neutralization is provided by the Russian vowels {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}. These phonemes are contrasting in [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]] syllables, but in unstressed syllables the contrast is lost, since both are [[vowel reduction|reduced]] to the same sound, usually {{IPA|[ə]}} (for details, see [[vowel reduction in Russian]]). In order to assign such an instance of {{IPA|[ə]}} to one of the phonemes {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}, it is necessary to consider [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] factors (such as which of the vowels occurs in other forms of the words, or which [[inflection]]al pattern is followed). In some cases even this may not provide an unambiguous answer. A description using the approach of underspecification would not attempt to assign {{IPA|[ə]}} to a specific phoneme in some or all of these cases, although it might be assigned to an archiphoneme, written something like |A|, which reflects the two neutralized phonemes in this position.

A somewhat different example is found in English, with the three [[nasal consonant|nasal]] phonemes {{IPA|/m, n, ŋ/}}. In word-final position these all contrast, as shown by the minimal triplet ''sum'' {{IPA|/sʌm/}}, ''sun'' {{IPA|/sʌn/}}, ''sung'' {{IPA|/sʌŋ/}}. However, before a [[stop consonant|stop]] such as {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} (provided there is no [[morpheme]] boundary between them), only one of the nasals is possible in any given position: {{IPA|/m/}} before {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} before {{IPA|/k/}}, as in ''limp, lint, link'' ( {{IPA|/lɪmp/}}, {{IPA|/lɪnt/}}, {{IPA|/lɪŋk/}}). The nasals are therefore not contrastive in these environments, and according to some theorists this makes it inappropriate to assign the nasal phones heard here to any one of the phonemes (even though, in this case, the phonetic evidence is unambiguous). Instead they may analyze these phones as belonging to a single archiphoneme, written something like |N|, and state the [[underlying representation]]s of ''limp, lint, link'' to be {{IPA|{{!}}lɪNp{{!}}, {{!}}lɪNt{{!}}, {{!}}lɪNk{{!}}}}.

This latter type of analysis is often associated with [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]] of the [[Prague school]]. Archiphonemes are often notated with a capital letter within pipes, as with the examples |A| and |N| given above. Other ways the second of these might be notated include {{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;|m-n-ŋ|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}, {{IPA|{m, n, ŋ&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}, or {{IPA|{{!}}n*{{!}}}}.

Another example from English, but this time involving complete phonetic convergence as in the Russian example, is the flapping of {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} in some American English (described above under [[#Biuniqueness|Biuniqueness]]). Here the words ''betting'' and ''bedding'' might both be pronounced {{IPA|[ˈbɛɾɪŋ]}}, and if a speaker applies such flapping consistently, it would be necessary to look for morphological evidence (the pronunciation of the related forms ''bet'' and ''bed'', for example) in order to determine which phoneme the flap represents. As in the previous examples, some theorists would prefer not to make such a determination, and simply assign the flap in both cases to a single archiphoneme, written (for example) |D|.

For a special kind of neutralization proposed in [[generative linguistics|generative]] phonology, see [[absolute neutralization]].

==Morphophonemes==
{{main|Morphophonology}}
A '''morphophoneme''' is a theoretical unit at a deeper level of abstraction than traditional phonemes, and is taken to be a unit from which [[morpheme]]s are built up. A morphophoneme within a morpheme can be expressed in different ways in different [[allomorph]]s of that morpheme (according to [[morphophonological]] rules). For example, the English plural morpheme ''-s'' appearing in words such as ''cats'' and ''dogs'' can be considered to consist of a single morphophoneme, which might be written (for example) //z// or |z|, and which is pronounced as [s] after most [[voiceless consonant]]s (as in ''cat'''s''''') and [z] in most other cases (as in ''dog'''s''''').

==Numbers of phonemes in different languages==
A given language will use only a small subset of the many possible [[speech sound|sounds]] that the human [[speech organs]] can produce, and, because of [[allophony]], the number of distinct phonemes will generally be smaller than the number of identifiably different sounds. Different languages vary considerably in the number of phonemes they have in their systems (although apparent variation may sometimes result from the different approaches taken by the linguists doing the analysis). The total phonemic inventory in languages varies from as few as 11 in [[Rotokas]] and [[Pirahã language|Pirahã]] to as many as 141 in [[!Kung language|!Xũ]].{{sfn|Crystal|2010|p=173}}

The number of phonemically distinct [[vowel]]s can be as low as two, as in [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]] and [[Arrernte language|Arrernte]]. At the other extreme, the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language [[Ngwe language|Ngwe]] has 14 vowel qualities, 12 of which may occur long or short, making 26 oral vowels, plus 6 nasalized vowels, long and short, making a total of 38 vowels; while [[!Xóõ language|!Xóõ]] achieves 31 pure vowels, not counting its additional variation by vowel length, by varying the [[phonation]]. As regards [[consonant]] phonemes, [[Puinave language|Puinave]] and the Papuan language [[Tauade language|Tauade]] each have just seven, and [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]] has only six. !Xóõ, on the other hand, has somewhere around 77, and [[Ubykh phonology|Ubykh]] 81. The [[English language]] uses a rather large set of 13 to 21 vowel phonemes, including diphthongs, although its 22 to 26 consonants are close to average.

Some languages, such as [[French language|French]], have no phonemic [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] or [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], while [[Cantonese]] and several of the [[Kam–Sui languages]] have nine tones, and one of the [[Kru languages]], [[Wobe language|Wobe]], has been claimed{{By whom|date=April 2017}} to have 14, though this is disputed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The most common vowel system consists of the five vowels {{IPA|/i/, /e/, /a/, /o/, /u/}}. The most common consonants are {{IPA|/p/, /t/, /k/, /m/, /n/}}.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Relatively few languages lack any of these consonants, although it does happen: for example, [[Arabic]] lacks {{IPA|/p/}}, [[Hawaiian language|standard Hawaiian]] lacks {{IPA|/t/}}, [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]] and [[Tlingit language|Tlingit]] lack {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}, [[Hupa language|Hupa]] lacks both {{IPA|/p/}} and a simple {{IPA|/k/}}, colloquial [[Samoan language|Samoan]] lacks {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}, while [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]] and [[Quileute language|Quileute]] lack {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}.

==The non-uniqueness of phonemic solutions==
During the development of phoneme theory in the mid-20th century phonologists were concerned not only with the procedures and principles involved in producing a phonemic analysis of the sounds of a given language, but also with the reality or uniqueness of the phonemic solution. Some writers took the position expressed by [[Kenneth Pike]]: "There is only one accurate phonemic analysis for a given set of data",&lt;ref&gt;Pike, K.L. (1947) ''Phonemics'', University of Michigan Press, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; while others believed that different analyses, equally valid, could be made for the same data. [[Yuen Ren Chao]] (1934), in his article "The non-uniqueness of phonemic solutions of phonetic systems"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chao|first1=Yuen Ren|title=The non-uniqueness of phonemic solutions of phonetic systems|journal=Academia Sinica|date=1934|volume=IV.4|pages=363–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated "given the sounds of a language, there are usually more than one possible way of reducing them to a set of phonemes, and these different systems or solutions are not simply correct or incorrect, but may be regarded only as being good or bad for various purposes". The linguist F.W. Householder referred to this argument within linguistics as "God's Truth vs. hocus-pocus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Householder | first1 = F.W. | year = 1952 | title = Review of ''Methods in structural linguistics'' by Zellig S. Harris | url = | journal = International Journal of American Linguistics | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 260–8 | doi=10.1086/464181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different analyses of the English vowel system may be used to illustrate this. The article [[English Phonology]] states that "English has a particularly large number of vowel phonemes" and that "there are 20 vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation, 14–16 in General American and 20–21 in Australian English"; the present article ([[Phoneme#Numbers of phonemes in different languages]]) says that "the English language uses a rather large set of 13 to 21 vowel phonemes". Although these figures are often quoted as a scientific fact, they actually reflect just one of many possible analyses, and later in the English Phonology article an alternative analysis is suggested in which some diphthongs and long vowels may be interpreted as comprising a short vowel linked to either {{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}. The transcription system for British English (RP) devised by the phonetician [[Geoff Lindsey]] and used in the CUBE pronunciation dictionary also treats diphthongs as composed of a vowel plus {{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindsey|first1=Geoff|title=The CUBE searchable dictionary|url=http://englishspeechservices.com/blog/the-cube-searchable-dictionary/|publisher=English Speech Services|accessdate=31 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231212054/http://englishspeechservices.com/blog/the-cube-searchable-dictionary/|archivedate=31 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fullest exposition of this approach is found in Trager and Smith (1951), where all long vowels and diphthongs ("complex nuclei") are made up of a short vowel combined with either {{IPA|/j/}}, {{IPA|/w/}} or {{IPA|/h/}} (plus {{IPA|/r/}} for rhotic accents), each thus comprising two phonemes: they wrote "The conclusion is inescapable that the complex nuclei consist each of two phonemes, one of the short vowels followed by one of three glides".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trager|first1=G.|last2=Smith|first2=H.|title=An Outline of English Structure|date=1951|publisher=American Council of Learned Societies|page=20|url=https://archive.org/details/outlineofenglish00trag|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transcription for the vowel normally transcribed {{IPA|/aɪ/}} would instead be {{IPA|/aj/}}, {{IPA|/aʊ/}} would be {{IPA|/aw/}} and {{IPA|/ɑː/}} would be {{IPA|/ah/}}. The consequence of this approach is that English could theoretically have only seven vowel phonemes, which might be symbolized {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/ʌ/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}}, or even six if schwa were treated as an allophone of {{IPA|/ʌ/}} or of other short vowels, a figure that would put English much closer to the average number of vowel phonemes in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roach|first1=Peter|title=English Phonetics and Phonology|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-71740-3|pages=99–100|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same period there was disagreement about the correct basis for a phonemic analysis. The [[Structural linguistics|structuralist]] position was that the analysis should be made purely on the basis of the sound elements and their distribution, with no reference to extraneous factors such as grammar, morphology or the intuitions of the native speaker; this position is strongly associated with [[Leonard Bloomfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloomfield|first1=Leonard|title=Language|date=1933|publisher=Henry Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zellig Harris]] claimed that it is possible to discover the phonemes of a language purely by examining the distribution of phonetic segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Zellig|title=Methods in Structural Linguistics|date=1951|publisher=Chicago University Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] definitions of the phoneme, Twaddell (1935) stated "Such a definition is invalid because (1) we have no right to guess about the linguistic workings of an inaccessible 'mind', and (2) we can secure no advantage from such guesses. The linguistic processes of the 'mind' as such are quite simply unobservable; and introspection about linguistic processes is notoriously a fire in a wooden stove."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Twaddell|first1=W.F.|title=On defining the phoneme|journal=Language|date=1935|volume=11 |issue=1|pages=5–62|jstor=522070}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was opposed to that of [[Edward Sapir]], who gave an important role to native speakers' intuitions about where a particular sound or groups of sounds fitted into a pattern. Using English {{IPA|[ŋ]}} as an example, Sapir argued that, despite the superficial appearance that this sound belongs to a group of nasal consonants, "no naive English-speaking person can be made to feel in his bones that it belongs to a single series with {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}. ... It still ''feels'' like ŋg".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sapir|first1=Edward|title=Sound patterns in language|journal=Language|date=1925|volume=1.37|doi=10.2307/409004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of [[generative phonology]] which emerged in the 1960s explicitly rejected the Structuralist approach to phonology and favoured the mentalistic or cognitive view of Sapir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=Current Issues in Linguistic Theory|date=1964|publisher=Mouton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|last2=Halle|first2=Morris|title=The Sound Pattern of English|date=1968|publisher=Harper and Row}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Correspondence between letters and phonemes==
{{Main|Phonemic orthography}}
Phonemes are considered to be the basis for [[alphabet]]ic writing systems. In such systems the written symbols ([[grapheme]]s) represent, in principle, the phonemes of the language being written. This is most obviously the case when the alphabet was invented with a particular language in mind; for example, the Latin alphabet was devised for Classical Latin, and therefore the Latin of that period enjoyed a near one-to-one correspondence between phonemes and graphemes in most cases, though the devisers of the alphabet chose not to represent the phonemic effect of vowel length. However, because changes in the spoken language are often not accompanied by changes in the established [[orthography]] (as well as other reasons, including [[dialect]] differences, the effects of [[morphophonology]] on orthography, and the use of foreign spellings for some [[loanword]]s), the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation in a given language may be highly distorted; this is the case with English, for example.

The correspondence between symbols and phonemes in alphabetic writing systems is not necessarily a [[one-to-one correspondence]]. A phoneme might be represented by a combination of two or more letters ([[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]], [[Digraph (orthography)|trigraph]], etc.), like &amp;lt;sh&amp;gt; in English or &amp;lt;sch&amp;gt; in [[German language|German]] (both representing phonemes {{IPA|/ʃ/}}). Also a single letter may represent two phonemes, as in English &amp;lt;x&amp;gt; representing /gz/ or /ks/. There may also exist spelling/pronunciation rules (such as those for the pronunciation of &amp;lt;c&amp;gt; in [[Italian language|Italian]]) that further complicate the correspondence of letters to phonemes, although they need not affect the ability to predict the pronunciation from the spelling and vice versa, provided the rules are known.

==In sign languages==
Sign language phonemes are bundles of articulation features. Stokoe was the first scholar to describe the phonemic system of [[American Sign Language|ASL]]. He identified the bundles ''[[location (sign language)|tab]]'' (elements of location, from Latin ''tabula''), ''[[handshape|dez]]'' (the handshape, from ''designator''), ''[[movement (sign language)|sig]]'' (the motion, from ''signation''). Some researchers also discern ''[[orientation (sign language)|ori]]'' (orientation), facial [[expression (sign language)|expression]] and/or [[mouthing]]. Just as with spoken languages, when features are combined, they create phonemes. As in spoken languages, sign languages have minimal pairs which differ in only one phoneme. For instance, the ASL signs for ''[https://media.spreadthesign.com/video/mp4/13/455635.mp4 father]'' and ''[https://media.spreadthesign.com/video/mp4/13/48601.mp4 mother]'' differ minimally with respect to location while handshape and movement are identical; location is thus contrastive. 

[[Stokoe notation|Stokoe's terminology and notation system]] are no longer used by researchers to describe the phonemes of sign languages; [[William Stokoe]]'s research, while still considered seminal, has been found not to characterize American Sign Language or other sign languages sufficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57352333|title=Linguistics of American Sign Language : an introduction|last=Clayton|first=Valli|last2=Lucas|first2=Ceil|date=2000|publisher=[[Gallaudet University Press]]|isbn=9781563680977|edition=3rd|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=57352333|authorlink1=Clayton Valli|authorlink2=Ceil Lucas}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Sign language#Non-manual signs|non-manual features]] are not included in Stokoe's classification. More sophisticated models of sign language phonology have since been proposed by Brentari,&lt;ref&gt;Brentari, Diane (1998). ''A prosodic model of sign language phonology''. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Sandler,&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, Wendy (1989). ''Phonological representation of the sign: linearity and nonlinearity in American Sign Language''. Foris.&lt;/ref&gt; and van der Kooij.&lt;ref&gt;Kooij, Els van der (2002). ''Phonological categories in Sign Language of the Netherlands. The role of phonetic implementation and iconicity''. PhD dissertation, Leiden University.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Chereme{{anchor|Cherology}}{{anchor|Chereme}}===
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Chereme]] and [[Cherology]] --&gt;
'''Cherology''' and '''chereme''' (from {{Lang-grc|χείρ}} "hand") are synonyms of [[phonology]] and phoneme previously used in the study of [[sign language]]s. A ''chereme'', as the basic unit of signed communication, is functionally and psychologically equivalent to the phonemes of oral languages, and has been replaced by that term in the academic literature. ''Cherology'', as the study of ''cheremes'' in language, is thus equivalent to phonology. The terms are not in use anymore. Instead, the terms ''phonology'' and ''[[phoneme]]'' (or ''distinctive feature'') are used to stress the linguistic similarities between signed and spoken languages.&lt;ref&gt;Bross, Fabian. 2015. "Chereme", in In: Hall, T. A. Pompino-Marschall, B. (ed.): Dictionaries of Linguistics and Communication Science (Wörterbücher zur Sprach- und Kommunikationswissenschaft, WSK). Volume: Phonetics and Phonology. Berlin, New York: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The terms were coined in 1960 by [[William Stokoe]]&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C. 1960. [http://saveourdeafschools.org/stokoe_1960.pdf Sign Language Structure: An Outline of the Visual Communication Systems of the American Deaf], ''Studies in linguistics: Occasional papers (No. 8)''. Buffalo: Dept. of Anthropology and Linguistics, University of Buffalo.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Gallaudet University]] to describe sign languages as true and full languages.  Once a controversial idea, the position is now universally accepted in linguistics. Stokoe's terminology, however, has been largely abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Seegmiller, 2006. "Stokoe, William (1919–2000)", in ''Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Pinkstinks has created a listing of "Pinkstinks Approved" companies providing non-gender-specific play and learning products for children.&lt;ref name="Approved"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pinkstinks.org.uk/pinkstinks-approved.html | title=Pinkstinks Approved | publisher=Pinkstinks | accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the campaign was reported as urging parents to boycott shops selling pink toys and gifts.&lt;ref name="Boycott"/&gt; In 2010 Pinkstinks criticised [[Marks and Spencer]] for labelling underwear aimed at six-year-old girls as "bra tops".&lt;ref name="M&amp;S"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7718560/MandS-apologises-for-selling-bra-tops-to-girls-aged-six.html | title=M&amp;S apologises for selling 'bra tops' to girls aged six | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=13 May 2010 | accessdate=13 April 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]], Marks and Spencer and [[Sainsbury's]] have responded quickly to criticism by Pinkstinks, removing a "girls" label from a pink [[Playmobil]] set and a "boys" label from a science kit&lt;ref name="Rustin 2"/&gt; and adding non-gender-specific labels to children's nurse and doctor outfits.&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite news | title=PinkStinks: How we took on Sainsbury's&amp;nbsp;– and won | url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/Communications/article/997335/PinkStinks-took-Sainsburys---won/ | work=Third Sector | date=20 April 2010 | agency=[[Haymarket Media Group|Haymarket]] | accessdate=3 July 2013 | author=John Plummer | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
The campaign's founders, Abi and Emma Moore, won an award in the Women Creating Change category at the 2009 [[Sheila McKechnie Foundation]] awards.&lt;ref name="Alumni"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smk.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Annual-Report-2010-11.pdf | title=Working with our alumni | publisher=[[Sheila McKechnie Foundation]] | work=Annual Report 2010–11 | page= 6| date = 2011|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Pinkstinks won the [[Mumsnet]] Award for Promoting Body Confidence in Children.&lt;ref name="Rustin 1"/&gt;

In 2009 [[Bridget Prentice]] MP, who was then [[British Government]] Justice Minister, backed Pinkstinks' campaign to boycott shops selling [[Christmas]] gifts which were aimed particularly at either girls or boys,&lt;ref name="Prince"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/pc-minister-backs-pinkstinks-campaign-435516 | title=PC Minister backs Pinkstinks campaign telling parents not to buy girls pink gifts | work=[[Daily Mirror]] | date=4 February 2012 | accessdate=4 December 2015 | author=James Lyons}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying "It's about not funnelling girls into pretty, pretty jobs, but giving them aspirations and challenging them to fulfil their potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rosa Prince|title=Labour MP: ban shops from selling ‘sexist’ pink toys to little girls|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/6729588/Labour-MP-ban-shops-from-selling-sexist-pink-toys-to-little-girls.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate = 14 February 2015|date=7 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in the UK [[Parliament (United Kingdom)|Parliament]], [[Delyth Morgan, Baroness Morgan of Drefelin|Lady Morgan]], the junior children's minister, said that "it is extremely important that we ensure girls have a chance to play with trucks and trains and wear blue if they look pretty in blue and we shouldn't be defining how young people are looked after by the colour of their toys".&lt;ref name="Parliament"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/dec/09/houseofcommons-lords?INTCMP=SRCH | title=Yesterday in parliament: 'Pinkstinks' | work=[[The Guardian]] | author= [[Press Association]]|date=9 December 2009 | agency=[[Press Association]] | accessdate=15 September 2016 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign has also been backed by [[Ed Mayo]], author and former UK government adviser on consumer issues, who said: "I feel this colour apartheid is one of the things that sets children on two separate railway tracks. One leads to higher pay, and higher status and one doesn't."&lt;ref name="Wallop"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/6683639/Pink-toys-damaging-for-girls.html | title=Pink toys 'damaging' for girls | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=30 November 2009 | accessdate=13 April 2013 | author=Harry Wallop | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mayo, before [[World War II]] pink was more usually associated with boys, while blue&amp;nbsp;– traditionally the colour of the [[Virgin Mary]]&amp;nbsp;– was linked with girls.&lt;ref name="Wallop"/&gt; He said: "When you walk into a toy store, as the campaign Pinkstinks has argued, it is as if feminism had never happened."&lt;ref name="Lego"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/12/lego-people-angry-barbie | title=Lego people are right to be angry&amp;nbsp;– they have to live with Barbie | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=12 June 2013 | accessdate=13 June 2013 | author=[[Ed Mayo]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 2010 ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] had objected to the inclusion of [[Kirsty Moore]], the first woman [[Red Arrows]] pilot,&lt;ref name="Jenkins 2009"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/amy-jenkins-dont-think-pink-girls-it-will-only-turn-your-brain-to-mush-1820552.html | title=Amy Jenkins: Don't think pink, girls. It will only turn your brain to mush | work=[[The Independent]] | date=14 November 2009 | accessdate=14 August 2015 | author=[[Amy Jenkins]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a role model on the Pinkstinks website and had refused to supply a photograph of her.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/amy-jenkins-will-powerful-women-please-stop-saying-im-not-a-feminist-but-1952978.html | title=Will powerful women please stop saying, 'I'm not a feminist, but...' | work=[[The Independent]] | date=24 April 2010 | accessdate=20 April 2013 | author=[[Amy Jenkins]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[Daily Mail]]'' opinion piece, novelist [[Amanda Craig]] confessed to hating pink, but argued that "you can't 'liberate' young girls by banning it. Besides, if you banned pink, there would be a toddlers' revolution. It speaks to their deepest instincts of what is feminine".&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1234007/AMANDA-CRAIG-Like-mums-Im-sick-pink-plague-Labour-REALLY-trying-ban-daughters-favourite-colour.html | title=Like most mums I'm sick of the pink plague, but should Labour REALLY be trying to ban our daughters' favourite colour?| work=[[Daily Mail]] | date=8 December 2009 | accessdate=30 April 2013 | author=[[Amanda Craig]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A., &amp; Montgomery, B. M. (1996). Relating: Dialogues and dialectics.

The relational dialectic is an elaboration on [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s idea that life is an open monologue and  humans experience collisions between opposing desires and needs within relational communications.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, L. A. (2204). A tale of two voices: relational dialectics theory. ''The Journal of Family Communication'', 4(3&amp;4), 182–192.&lt;/ref&gt;  Baxter includes a list of dialectical tensions that reminds us that  relationships are constantly changing, and that successful and satisfying relationships require constant attention. Although Baxter's description of relational dialectics is thorough, it by no means is exact or all inclusive since we all experience different tensions in different ways.

==History==
Relational dialectics is the emotional and value-based version of the philosophical [[dialectic]].  It is rooted in the dynamism of the [[yin and yang]].  Like the classic yin and yang, the balance of emotional values in a relationship is always in motion, and any value pushed to its extreme contains the seed of its opposite.&lt;ref name="Bax6"&gt;Baxter, L. A. &amp; Montgomery, B. M. (1996) ''Relating: Dialogues and dialectics'' Guilford Press, New York, {{ISBN|1-57230-099-X}} ;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Western world]], these ideas hark back to the Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]], who held that the world was in constant flux (like fire), with creative and destructive forces on both sides of every process. [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], a Russian scholar most known for his work in [[Dialogic|dialogism]], applied [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[dialectic]] to literary and rhetorical theory and criticism.  He illustrated the tensions that exists in the deep structure of all human experience.&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;Griffin, Emory A. (2003) A First Look at Communication Theory McGraw Hill, Boston, {{ISBN|0-07-248392-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he identified that the tension that exists between unity and difference. Bakhtin conceived the human dialectic as two forces analogous to the physical forces ''centripetal'' (emotional forces tending towards unity) and ''centrifugal'' (emotional forces tending towards divergence). Like the Yin and Yang, Bakhtin's forces have no ultimate resolution.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

Baxter took the deep structural analysis of Bakhtin and applied it to communication theory.  She found a T-Bangha of axes where this dynamic tension operated.&lt;ref name="Bax6"/&gt;  Later authors have added other axes.&lt;ref name="Sahl"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sahlstein | first1 = Erin M. | year = 2006 | title = Making plans: Praxis strategies for negotiating uncertainty-certainty in long-distance relationships | url = | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 70 | issue = 2| pages = 147–165 | doi=10.1080/10570310600710042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches to Relational Dialectics==
The ''monologic'' approach frames contradictions as either/or, the ''dualistic'' approach frames contradictions as two separate entities, and the ''dialectic'' approach contends that multiple points of view play off one another in every contradiction (both/and).&lt;ref name="West" /&gt;

==Core concepts and assumptions==
There are four main concepts that form the backdrop of relational dialectics, as well as four major assumptions. Relational dialectics assumes that "(1.) relationships are not linear, (2.) relational life is characterized by change, (3.) contradiction is the fundamental fact of relational life, and (4.) communication is central to organizing and negotiating relational contradictions".&lt;ref name="West"&gt;West, Richard, and Lynn Turner (2010) ''Introducing Communication Theory Analysis and Application. 4th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Higher Education {{ISBN|0073385077}}  ;&lt;/ref&gt;

The four core concepts of relational dialectics include: contradiction, totality, process, and praxis.

'''Contradictions''' are the core concept of relational dialectics. It is the dynamic interplay between unified oppositions. A contradiction is formed "whenever two tendencies or forces are interdependent (unity) yet mutually negate one another (negation)".&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, Katherine (2002) ''Communication theories: perspectives, processes, and contexts'' McGraw Hill, Boston, {{ISBN|0-7674-0500-5}} ;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a relationship one can simultaneously desire intimacy and distance.

'''Totality''' suggests that contradictions in a relationship are part of a unified whole and cannot be understood in isolation. In other words, the dialectics cannot be separated and are intrinsically related to each other. For example, the tension between dependence and interdependence cannot be separated from the tension between openness and privacy — both work to condition and define the other.

'''Process '''Relational dialectics must be understood in terms of social '''processes'''. Movement, activity, and change are functional properties (Rawlins,1989). For example, instances such as an individual fluctuating between disclosure and secretiveness. In addition, the individual may move between periods of honest and open communication (Miller, 2002, 2005).

'''Praxis''' is a philosophical term for the concept of 'practical behavior' or sometimes 'the experience of practicing'.  In praxis the dialectic tensions are created and re-created through the active participation and interaction.  In other words, the practical experience of having a relationship exposes one to the imposition of the needs and value of another.  As the relationship endures one's own needs and values become apparent.  Praxis focuses on the practical choices individuals make in the midst of the opposing needs and values (dialectical tensions). In turn, the choices and actions themselves create, re-create, and change the nature of the relationship and hence the dialectical tensions themselves.

Research has recommended theories which further dialectical understanding in relationships, such as in the marriage, in the workplace, etc. Relational dialectics further includes the idea of Contextual Dialectics, or rather, the idea that every relationship exists within a specific place within a specific culture. From there we also see the raise of public and private/real and ideal dialectics and the interplay between what we see on television in public life, versus what experience within our private lives. Examples of this include politicians as well as TV shows. According to West and Turner, "the tension of the real and ideal dialectic is featured when we think of television shows like Leave It to Beaver:  We receive an idealized message of what family life is like, and then when we look at the families we live in, we have to contend with the troublesome realities of family life. The tension between these two images forms this dialectic".&lt;ref&gt;West, Richard, and Lynn Turner (2010) Introducing Communication Theory Analysis and Application. 4th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Higher Education {{ISBN|0073385077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialectics==
According to the original relational dialectic [[Conceptual model|model]], there were many core tensions (opposing values) in any relationship.&lt;ref name="Cheney"/&gt; These are autonomy and connectedness, favoritism and impartiality, openness and closedness, novelty and predictability, instrumentality and affection, and finally, equality and inequality.

Autonomy and connectedness refers to the desire to have ties and connections with others versus the need to separate oneself as a unique individual. An example of autonomy and connectedness would be an athlete, who wants to feel like they are part of a team but also wanting to highlight their individual talents. Favoritism and impartiality refers to the desire to be treated fairly and impartially versus the desire to be seen and known as "special". For instance, a professor may want to be impartial by creating an attendance policy but makes exceptions for students who participate in class and have good grades, demonstrating favoritism. Openness and closedness refers to the desire to be open and divulge information versus the desire to be exclusive and private. When chatting with a boss about one's weekend, there is the desire to be open, however, closedness is also at play, as certain details are often left out, because of the context. Novelty and predictability suggest that there is a desire for the relationship to be predictable versus the desire for it to be original and new. When creating scheduled meetings for board members, the predictability may lie in a fixed schedule, however the novelty may be in scheduling a varying number of locations to peak interests as well as inspiration. Instrumentality and affection, is the desire for affection to be genuine versus the desire for affection to be motivated by benefits and perceived advantages of the relationship. An example of this would be being in a romantic relationship based on love and affection, but maintaining it for benefits such as financial security. Finally, equality and inequality refers to the desire to be considered as equals versus the desire to develop levels of superiority. A female in the military may seek treatment equivalent to that received by her male colleagues, but requires special barracks and adjusted assignments.&lt;ref name="Cheney"/&gt;

According to the theory, while most of us may embrace the ideals of closeness, certainty, and openness in our relationships, the communication is not a straight path towards these goals. Conflicts often produce the exact opposites.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

The table above shows typical dialectical tensions experienced by relational partners based on research done by Baxter and Montgomery showing contrasting efforts in two different ways. The column that displays examples of Internal Dialect shows "ongoing tensions played out within a relationship".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; The column that displays examples of External Dialect shows "ongoing tensions between a couple and their community".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

'''Integration–separation''' is "a class of relational dialectics that includes connection–autonomy, inclusion–seclusion, and intimacy–independence."&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; Some individual autonomy must be given up to connect to others.

'''Stability–change''' is "a class of relational dialectics that includes certainty–uncertainty, conventionally–uniqueness, predictability–surprise, and routine–novelty."&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; Things must be consistent but not mundane. There must be a balance between the expected and unexpected in order to keep a relationship.

'''Expression–nonexpression''' is "a class of relational dialectics that includes openness–closedness, revelation–concealment, candor–secrecy, and transparency–privacy".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; In a relationship, it is important to keep some things between the two parties, while other parts of the relationship are okay to allow the public to know about.

==Dialectics in relationships==
According to Michaela Meyer, "relational dialectics theory exposes tensions within interpersonal relationships while at the same time it assumes a continual maintenance and repair of these tensions. As a result, relational dialectics theory is incredibly useful for defining how tensions are managed within relationships."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = M.

I'm it.": Defining Adolescent Sexual Identity through Relational Dialectics in Dawson's Creek | url = | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 262–276 | doi=10.1080/01463370309370156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive research has been done regarding the role dialectical tensions play in relationships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baxter|first1=Leslie A.|title=Dialectical Theory|journal=International Encyclopedia of Marriage and Family|date=2003|volume=2nd Edition|url=http://db19.linccweb.org/login?url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/galemarriage/dialectical_theory/0?institutionId=6086}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the various factors that influence the tensions and the degree to which they affect the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Joseph P.|last2=Chango|first2=Joanna|last3=Szwedo|first3=David|title=The Adolescent Relational Dialectic and the Peer Roots of Adult Social Functioning|journal=Child Development|date=2014|volume=85|issue=1|pages=192–204|doi=10.1111/cdev.12106|pmc=4030385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through studies of romantic relationships, long distance relationships, friendships, and family relationships, researchers have observed the existence and frequency of certain dialectical tensions within various types of relationships.&lt;ref name="Sahl"/&gt;

According to Marsha Linehan, founder of DBT or Dialectical Behavior Therapy, some people have great difficulty resolving the dialectic tensions that arise in relationships.  Many people with personality disorders, potentially caused or made worse by dysfunctional upbringing, especially Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and some others, perpetually vascilate between the poles of the dialectic conflict, with resulting instability causing problems in living that are not mediated by other therapy modalities. In DBT's biosocial theory, some people "have a biological predisposition for emotional dysregulation, and their social environment validates maladaptive behavior. &lt;ref&gt; Little, Hannah; Tickle, Anna; das Nair, Roshan (16 October 2017).

===Romantic relationships===

A study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erbert | first1 = L. A. | year = 2000 | title = Conflict and dialectics: Perceptions of dialectic contradictions in marital conflict | url = | journal = [[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]] | volume = 17 | issue = 4–5| pages = 638–659 | doi=10.1177/0265407500174009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 25 [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] married couples was designed to determine what types of dialectical tensions were most prevalent in antagonistic conflicts between spouses. Larry Erbert found that the Openness v. Closedness dialectic was most commonly referenced through examples by participants. Research conducted by Baxter and Montgomery confirmed this finding, and broke the dialectic down into four subcategories to further analyze its existence in romantic relationships.

*'''''Openness with''''':  Refers to an individual's self-disclosure of information to another.  In this idea, three types of information are shared: information deemed to be personal, the individuals feelings or personal opinions, and information regarding one individual's relationship with the other.
*'''''Openness To''''': Often this form of openness is labeled as being attentive or responsive. People respond in cognitive, affective, and behavioral ways.
*'''''Closedness with''''': Describes the type of nondisclosive talk that occurs between individuals. It is most often identified as "small talk", being primarily superficial. The talk is oriented around conversation that requires little or no self-disclosure, allowing for a controlled level informational privacy.
*'''''Closedness to''''': Some people experience stress and discomfort when listening to others' problems. In response to this, some individuals attempt to distance themselves in order to discourage others from confiding in them.&lt;ref name="Bax6"/&gt;

Research has been conducted to examine the autonomy-connection dialectic when dealing with termination of romantic relationships. In Erin Sahlestein and Tim Dun's study they found that, "participants' joint conversations and their breakup accounts reflect the two basic forms of contradiction. Both antagonistic and non-antagonistic struggles were evident in these data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sahlstein | first1 = E. | last2 = Dun | first2 = T. | year = 2008 | title = "I Wanted Time to Myself and He Wanted to be Together All the Time": Constructing Breakups as Managing Autonomy-Connection | url = | journal = Qualitative Research Reports In Communication | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 37–45 | doi = 10.1080/17459430802400340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the study discovered that while normally break-ups are retroactively studied, the autonomy-connection dialectic is actually in full swing throughout the termination process as opposed to previous thought of as a move from connection to autonomy.

A study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suter|first1=Elizabeth A.|last2=Daas|first2=Karen L.|title=Negotiating Heteronormativity Dialectally: lesbian couples' display of symbols in future|journal=Western Journal of Communication|date=2007|volume=71|issue=3|page= 177|url=http://link.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org/apps/doc/A169715265/PROF?u=lincclin_pbcc&amp;sid=PROF&amp;xid=fd2c5572|doi=10.1080/10570310701518443}}&lt;/ref&gt; measuring the display of symbols by lesbian couples, revealed that while same-sex couples experience similar challenges that opposite-sex partners do, there are unique challenges that arise to these same-sex couples. These unique problems in turn give rise to unique dialectical tensions within the relationship.

==== Re-marriage ====

In a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilder | first1 = S. E. | year = 2012 | title = A Dialectical Examination of Remarriage Dyadic Communication and Communication with Social Networks | url = | journal = Qualitative Research Reports In Communication | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 63–70 | doi = 10.1080/17459435.2012.722163 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that focused on dialectics in second marriages, six tensions unique to remarriages emerged.

Three tensions related to the remarried dyad:

*'''''Old-new''''' - Many participants found that within their new marriage, the individuals brought with them ideas and expectations based on their previous, or "old," marriages. However, participants recognized that they had since entered a "new" marriage, which would not necessarily carry over the previous old expectations or experiences.
*'''''Emotional closeness-distance''''' - Participants expressed feelings of both emotional closeness and emotional distance with their new partners. While participants found that they experienced emotional closeness with their second spouse, they also found that either they or their new spouse had other close friends or family with whom they were close to.
*'''''Past-present''''' - Many participants found that they do not discuss prior relationships, or other things that relate to the past, with their new partners. Yet, the new couples remained open about issues and topics related to their present life.

Three tensions also emerged from the remarried dyad and their social networks:

*'''''Their time frame-our time frame''''' - Many participants expressed feeling tensions between adhering to a time frame that felt right to the individual, while acknowledging the expectations that they sensed from their friends and family members in regards to what an appropriate relationship and re-marriage time frame would be.
*'''''Dyadic revelation-network revelation''''' - Participants found that they desired to share information with their social network, however, sometimes their partner did not desire them to share such information with that particular network, resulting in tensions among participants to decide between revealing to their partner and revealing information to their social network.
*'''''Old-new''''' - Participants identified the tension that was created through interactions with friends and family from the "old" marriage while being in the "new" [[marriage]]. Participants managed this tension primarily through recalibration and reaffirmation, where participants recognized that both sides had to be present in order for the relationship to exist.

===Long distance relationships===

Based on research by Sahlstein,&lt;ref name="Sahl"/&gt; the uncertainty v. certainty dialectic is the most prevailing dialectic found in long-distance relationships. Her work exposed uncertainty v. certainty as a competing yet complementary need. In interviews conducted with couples engaged in long distance relationships, contradictions emerged. For example, couples were found to plan interactions in order to obtain a level of spontaneity. Within this, three different forms of the praxis of relational dialectics emerged:

*'''''Segmentation''''' - referred to the partners' ability to live separate, independent lives when they were not together.
*'''''Balance''''' - referred to the couple's ability to plan conversations about the future of the relationship.
*'''''Denial''''' - referring to the couple's refusal to admit the effect distance is having on the relationship.

===Friendships===

William Rawlins has examined the role of relational dialectics in regard to [[friendship]]s.  The tension of instrumentality v. affection was found to be the most central to this type of relationship.&lt;ref name="Rawlins"/&gt; Within friendships, importance is placed on the ability to discern the level of affection for "real" friendships opposed to instrumentality for "fake" friendships. [[Aristotle]]'s "friendship of virtue" notion of caring for friends without instrumental purposes exemplifies this point. The dichotomy of instrumentality v. affection cannot be ignored within friendships, as affection may be offered in order to receive instrumental aid from friends. This interweaving of concepts is what distinguishes different types of friendships. While this remains true, the subjectivity of the friends in question ultimately determines the outcome of how heavily instrumentality v. affection is applied.

'''In the workplace'''

'''''Blended Relationships''''' are close friends that are a part of the same work environment. Dialectical tensions occur in organizations as individuals attempt to balance their roles as employees while maintaining established friendships within their occupations. It is not necessary, however, to have a friend in organizations to experience dialectical contradictions. Stress occurs frequently on the individual level as human needs and desires oppose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Brad W.|last2=Jensen|first2=Katherine C.|last3=Hideko|first3=Sera|last4=Cimbora|first4=David M.|title=Ethics and Relational Dialectics in Mentoring Relationships|journal=Training and Education in Professional Psychology|date=2017|issue=Advance online publication|doi=10.1037/tep0000166}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Impartiality vs. Favoritism''''':  Friends within organizations desire to provide each other with special support and assistance but organizations strive for equitable treatment and discourage bias.
*'''''Openness vs. Closedness''''':  It is a tendency of close friends to be open and honest with one another, but organizations often expect a level of confidentiality that places strain on friendships that value the sharing of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baxter | first1 = L. A. | last2 = Bridge | first2 = K. | year = 1992 | title = Blended relationships: friends as work associates | url = | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 200–225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Novelty and Predictability''''': Feeling excited about a restructuring of your organization but anxious since it may interrupt your routine and put stress on your current relationships.
*'''''Instrumentality and Affection''''':  Inviting a coworker to lunch with the intention of asking for support on a project at work.&lt;ref name="Cheney"/&gt;

=== Family relationships ===

''' Sibling relationships '''

Relational dialectics can be applied when considering the significant change in family life that siblings experience when one sibling moves out of the family home for the first time as part of the transition into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conger|first=K.J.|last2=Little|first2=W.M.|year=2010|title=Sibling relationships during the transition to adulthood|url=|journal=Child Development Perspectives|volume=4|issue=2|pages=87–94|doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2010.00123.x|via=|pmc=2917987}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one sibling begins a new phase of life, this change is often accompanied by new friendships or romantic relationships that occur in his/her new lifestyle, along with a new geographic separation, both of which result in a change in communication. As the newly absent sibling begins a new lifestyle beyond his/her home, the pre-existing sibling relationship goes through various changes and transitions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Halliwell | first1 = D | year = 2016 | title = "I Know You, But I Don't Know Who You Are": Siblings' Discursive Struggles Surrounding Experiences of Transition | url = | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 80 | issue = 3| pages = 327–347 | doi = 10.1080/10570314.2015.1091493 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; conducted on discursive struggles among siblings experiencing transition, all participants acknowledged that moving away from their sibling(s) resulted in a [[Discourse|discursive]] struggle between the old and new meanings in the sibling relationship. Two specific discursive struggles were identified:
*'''''Old relationship-new relationship''''' - For many siblings, family rituals were not continued upon moving out, resulting in a change in relationship and a feeling of missing out, emphasizing the changes that occur during the transition from an old relationship into new ones.
*'''''Certainty-uncertainty''''' - Participants found that the change from seeing a sibling regularly to not seeing him/her often resulted in feelings of uncertainty, resulting in an identity shift&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voicing relationships: A dialogic perspective|last=Baxter|first=Leslie A.|publisher=Sage|year=2011|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the relationship and supporting the discursive struggle of certainty-uncertainty.

While participants addressed the varying tensions involved with lifestyle transitions, 8 of the 19 participants in the study expressed that moving away from their sibling strengthened their connection and appreciation for their brother(s) and/or sister(s).

''' Children and stepparents '''

In a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baxter | first1 = L. A. | last2 = Braithwaite | first2 = D. O. | last3 = Bryant | first3 = L. | year = 2004 | title = Stepchildren's perceptions of the contradictions in communication with stepparents | url = | journal = Journal of Social &amp; Personal Relationships | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 447–467 | doi=10.1177/0265407504044841}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on the adult stepchild perceptions of communication in the stepchild-[[Stepfamily|stepparent]] relationship, three contradictions were found to be experienced by the stepchildren participants:
*'''''Dialectics of emotional distance-closeness''''' - While many stepchildren expressed feelings of emotional distance, the participants had varying reasons for keeping the distance. Some participants who still had a positive relationship with their nonresidential parent kept an emotional distance from their stepparent as an act of loyalty that they felt toward their nonresidential parent. Other participants equated emotional distance to the fact that they had little in common with their stepparent. However, many participants expressed feeling some closeness with a stepparent while maintaining an amount of emotional distance. Participants reported that they upheld a relationship with the stepparent that contained honesty, respect, and trust, yet they kept an emotional distance by continuing to address the stepparent by his/her first name, or simply claiming that each individual was very different from the other, causing tension in an effort to promote emotional closeness.
*'''''Stepparent status''''' - Many of the stepchildren in the study also experienced a dialectical tension between desiring for the family authority position to be designated to their one residential parent along with a desire for both the residential parent and the stepparent to share parenting authority. Many participants felt that legitimating their stepparent as a parent would result in the formation of closeness.
*'''''Expression''''' - The participants expressed a desire for open communication with their stepparent, while at the same time, expressing resistance to openness and instead favoring a more careful form of communication due to the fact that the participants often sensed a lack of familiarity with their stepparent.

In another study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braithwaite | first1 = D. O. | last2 = Toller | first2 = P. W. | last3 = Daas | first3 = K. L. | last4 = Durham | first4 = W. T. | last5 = Jones | first5 = A. C. | year = 2008 | title = Centered but not Caught in the Middle: Stepchildren's Perceptions of Dialectical Contradictions in the Communication of Co-Parents | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Communication Research | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 33–55 | doi = 10.1080/00909880701799337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers aimed to identify the contradictions that were perceived by stepchildren when characterizing the ways that familial interactions caused them to feel caught in the middle between parents. The participants expressed that they wanted to be centered in the family while, at the same time, they hoped to avoid being caught in the middle of two opposing parents. The main contradiction identified in the study was similar to the autonomy-connection dialectic; stepchildren desired the freedom to communicate and enact the desired relationship with their parents. However, these stepchildren also felt the need to manage the constraints that resulted from parental communication, particularly when both parents did not cooperate with one another. While the stepchildren wanted to know what was happening, at the same time, they also wanted to be protected, resulting in a second dialectic of control-restraint. Through this study, the researchers believe that openness-closeness dialectic between parents and their children is important to building functional stepfamily relationships.

One study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braithwaite | first1 = D. | last2 = Baxter | first2 = L. | year = 2006 | title = "You're My Parent but You're Not": Dialectical Tensions in Stepchildren's Perceptions About Communicating with the Nonresidential Parent | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Communication Research | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 30–48 | doi = 10.1080/00909880500420200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on the relationship and communication between college-aged stepchildren and their nonresidential parents, found two underlying contradictions: parenting and not parenting, and openness and closeness. Many participants expressed that they wanted their nonresidential parent to be actively involved in parenting them but did not desire it once they were. Participants also expressed that while they wanted open and intimate communication with their nonresidential parents, they felt that they could not closely communicate because of the nonresidential parent's lack of familiarity with the child's everyday life.

== Theory applications ==

=== End of life care ===
Relational dialectics theory can be applied to the context of health care, specifically [[end-of-life care]], providing a system for [[caregiver]] communication that contains tensions and challenges. The quality of the end-of-life journey is influenced by how these tensions are managed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oetzel|first=John|last2=Simpson|first2=Mary|date=April 2015|title=Managing Communication Tensions and Challenges During the End-of-Life Journey: Perspectives of Māori Kaumātua and Their Whānau.|journal=Health Communication|volume=30|issue=4|pages=350–360|doi=10.1080/10410236.2013.861306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relational dialectics theory is an applicable framework for investigating the ongoing communication between physicians and their patients/family members during the process of end-of-life care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amati | first1 = R | last2 = Hannawa | first2 = A | year = 2014 | title = Relational Dialectics Theory: Disentangling Physician-Perceived Tensions of End-of-Life Communication | url = | journal = Health Communication | volume = 29 | issue = 10| pages = 962–973 | doi=10.1080/10410236.2013.815533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When making choices about end-of-life medical care, family members, friends, or surrogate decision makers often experience feelings of tension and burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braun|first=U.K.|last2=Beyth|first2=R.J.|year=2008|title=Voices of African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic surrogates on the burdens of end-of-life decision making|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|volume=23|doi=10.1007/s11606-007-0487-7|pages=267–274|pmc=2359470}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decision-makers must deal with the relational and moral tensions that come with such decision-making.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toller|first=Paige|year=2009|title=Grieving Together and Apart: Bereaved Parents' Contradictions of Marital Interaction|journal=Journal of Applied Communication Research|volume=37|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family members in charge of making end-of-life decisions often face conflicting emotions between holding on and letting go; recognizing the need to let a patient go while wanting to continue fighting to keep a loved one alive.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ohs | first1 = J. E. | last2 = Trees | first2 = A. R. | last3 = Gibson | first3 = C. | year = 2015 | title = Holding On and Letting Go: Making Sense of End-of-Life Care Decisions in Families | url = | journal = Southern Communication Journal | volume = 80 | issue = 5| pages = 353–364 | doi = 10.1080/1041794X.2015.1081979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that focused on the communication tensions perceived among the Maori culture during the end-of-life journey, it was found that despite the culture's focus on collectivism and its emphasis on harmony, four communication tensions existed between caregivers (family and friends) and patients: autonomy and connection, conflict and connection, isolation and connection, and balancing the needs of self and other.

==== Grief ====
The human [[Grief|grieving]] process is marked by relational dialectics. After the death of a child, bereaved parents often experience tension between presence and absence by grieving their child's permanent absence while still experiencing an emotional bond toward the deceased child.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bereaved parents may also experience tension between openness and closeness, where they desire to discuss their feelings with friends or family, yet they are hesitant to share because of the potentially negative reactions they could receive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One study,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; aimed at focusing on how families make sense of contradictory discourses, found two discursive contradictions: family members' wishes vs. patient's wishes, and emotionality vs. [[rationality]]. Through interviews with participants who had experienced the loss of a loved one, researchers concluded that many of the end of life decisions made by family members, patients, and doctors were centered on making sense of the simultaneous desires to hold on and to let go. Participants recognized that they experienced tension between their own preferences and the preferences of a loved one, and with that, experienced the tension between desiring to make decisions based on emotions versus making decisions based on rationality.

Dialectical [[contradiction]]s have also been found among parents who have lost a child. One study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toller | first1 = P. W. | year = 2005 | title = Negotiation of Dialectical Contradictions by Parents who have Experienced the Death of a Child | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Communication Research | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 46–66 | doi = 10.1080/0090988042000318512 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that two primary dialectical contradictions occurred for parents who had experienced the death of a child: openness-closeness, and presence-absence. Parents experienced openness-closeness when they desired to talk about their child and their loss, yet they perceived the outcome as risky, especially if they sensed that friends and family wished for the parents to move on. Participants explained that they were able to manage this contradiction by being selective with their disclosure and taking control over the communicative situation. When dealing with the presence-absence dialectic, bereaved parents experienced tensions between the ongoing bond that they experienced with their child, and the physical absence of the child. Participants expressed that when people were not willing to remember their dead child, the physical absence of the child was deeply felt. However, when people chose to remember the deceased child, the parent experienced feelings of comfort and continual bonding with the child.

'''&lt;big&gt;Understanding Autistic Communication&lt;/big&gt;'''

As relational dialects’ aim is to analyse competence during interaction, it can suggest an approach to researching on communication competence among people which are with [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]]. Applying relational dialects theory to studying interactions of autistic individuals starts from approaching autistic individual as an actor during the interaction and deeming competence a result of the interaction. This approach&lt;ref&gt;Best, S. A. (2012). ''Using relational dialectics theory to better understand autistic communication competence.'' &lt;/ref&gt; can delve into how social contexts, expectations, and roles contribute to the autistics’ competent communication. The investigation of dialects includes integration-separation, expression-privacy, and stability-change enhance the understanding of the communication between people with [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]].

==Dialogue==

[[Dialogue]] is typically a conversation between two or more people. These conversations are what constitute relationships, as communication is the very foundation of any relationship. According to Cools, "the four important concepts that form the foundation of dialogism 1) the self and the other situated in contradictory forces, 2) unfinalizability, 3) the chronotope and the carnivalesque, and 4) heteroglossia and utterance".&lt;ref&gt;Cools, C. (2011). Relational dialectics in intercultural couples' relationships. Kult tuurienvälisten parisuhteiden relationaalinen dialektiikka&lt;/ref&gt; Similarity, in dialogue the following components are the most important: constitutive dialogue, utterance chains, dialectical flux, aesthetic moment, and critical sensibility.

''''Constitutive dialogue''''

While some theorists, along with Baxter, may argue that communication is simply a feature in a relationship, examining constitutive dialogue suggests that communication is actually what creates and maintains a relationship instead. According to Baxter, "a constitutive approach to communication asks how communication defines, or constructs, the social world, including our selves and our personal relationships. From a constitutive perspective, then, persons and relationships are not analytically separable from communication; instead, communication constitutes these phenomena"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baxter | first1 = L. A. | year = 2004 | title = Relationships as dialogues | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 1–22 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6811.2004.00068.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; When initial researchers studied relationships, they found that similarities, backgrounds, and interests are usually what hold people together while self-disclosure is the root of these components. Dialogic researchers would argue that differences are just as important as similarities and they are both discovered through dialogue.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

''''Utterance chains''''

To understand utterance chains, we must know that an [[utterance]] is what a person says in one turn of a conversation. When utterances are "linked to competing discourses", they are considered utterance chains. Baxter believes that there are "four links on the chain where the struggle of competing discourses can be heard."&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; These are: cultural ideologies, relational history, non-yet spoken response of partner or utterance, and normative evaluation of third party to utterance. Baxter also suggest that to understand an utterance, we must also understand the discourse. She posits "in the broadest sense, a discourse is a cultural system of meaning that circulates among a group's members and which makes our talk sensical. for example in the United States the discourse of individualism helps us to understand and value an utterance such as, 'I need to find myself first before I commit to a serious relationship with another person'".&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, L. A., &amp; Braithwaite, D. O. (2008). Relational dialectics theory. Engaging theories in interpersonal communication, 349-362.&lt;/ref&gt;

''''Dialectical flux''''

A dialectical flux is "the unpredictable, unfinalizable, indeterminate nature of personal relationships".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; Relationships are complicated and intertwined with dialectical tensions. Spiraling inversion and segmentation are two strategies that Baxter and Montgomery have established to respond to this complexity. Spiraling inversion is generally a no-win situation; a struggle between two different thought processes. For example, if you were to do something your parents did not approve of, you could lie about it, but your parents might yell at you for lying. And on the other hand, you could tell them upfront, and they could be completely quiet in shock. Segmentation is pertaining to more than one role in a relationship that must be altered depending on the situation. For example, if you were working at your father's shop as a part-time job, he would be considered your father AND your boss. This could mean that he has different expectations of you in different circumstances and his attitude towards you might change between roles.

''''Aesthetic moment''''

Aesthetic moments are brief incidents in a relationship that bring participants together through the use of dialogue. There is a temporary feeling of wholeness felt between partners involved in this dialogue. It is easy to see examples of aesthetic moments in romantic relationships, such as a first kiss or a reciting of wedding vows, but these moments can be experienced by anyone.

''''Critical sensibility''''

According to Griffin, critical sensibility is "an obligation to critique dominant voices, especially those that suppress opposing viewpoints; a responsibility to advocate for those who are muted".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; This means that both sides of a dialogue are equal to one another. No one person is more powerful or dominant than the other, and they are able to communicate without these imbalances interfering. This does not mean that the dialogue is free of competing discourses as listed in Utterance Chains.

==Ethics==

When communicating, we must understand that morals do not apply for all people. Sometimes lying can be entirely minor in communication, but there are oftentimes that lying can majorly affect the perspective of those being lied to. There are several times where most people would justify a "white lie", or a lie that causes no harm. For instance, if your mother was in the hospital, you could tell her she still looked beautiful, even if her appearance was far from it because it would make her feel better. Other actions that are only followed through based on whether they have a positive or negative outcome are called "consequential ethics".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; According to Sissela Bok, "lies drag around an initial negative weight that must be factored into ethical equations". Bok believes in the "principle of veracity" which says that truthful statements are preferable to lies in the absence of special circumstances that overcome the negative weight.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

== Critiques ==
According to theorist Leslie Baxter, there are three major limitations in the work of relational dialectics theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baxter | first1 = L. A. | year = 2004 | title = A Tale of Two Voices: Relational Dialectics Theory | url = | journal = Journal of Family Communication | volume = 4 | issue = 3/4| pages = 181–192 | doi = 10.1207/s15327698jfc0403&amp;4_5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baxter claims that her work has been "too distanced from naturally occurring talk between relating parties", and claims that the theory needs a firmer empirical base when applied to talk between relating parties. Baxter also believes that more future work needs to include multiple voices instead of focusing on the more popular research on the dialectics between "two voices". Lastly, Baxter has stated that future research should focus on discourse through time, such as studying dialogue and how it transforms over a longer period of time.

'''Sasanian Glass''' is the glassware produced between the 3rd and the 7th centuries AD within the limits of the [[Sasanian Empire]], namely Northern Iraq, Iran and Central Asia. This is a silica-soda-lime glass production characterized by thick glass-blown vessels relatively sober in decoration, avoiding plain colours in favour of transparency and with vessels worked in one piece without over- elaborate amendments. Thus the decoration usually consists of solid and visual motifs from the mould (reliefs), with ribbed and deeply cut facets, although other techniques like trailing and applied motifs were practised (See Figure 1).

== Some considerations about the definition of Sasanian Glass ==

Despite there being a general agreement concerning what Sasanian Glass is, there are no clear criteria to describe it. Therefore, before continuing with a further explanation is necessary to clarify it. Usually it is defined by means of Period, Territory and Style.
 
Sasanian glass is frequently referred to with the ambiguous term [[Pre-Islamic Glass]]. But some scholars (e.g. Goldstein 2005) consider the [[Achaemenid]] (550-330BC), [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] (247BC-226AD) and Sasanian(224-642AD) productions as Pre-[[Islamic]] whereas others (e.g. Meyer 1995) consider only the 7th–8th centuries AD immediately before the [[Islamic Golden Age]] and the first [[Abbasid caliphate]]. Sasanian Glass is also named [[Persian Glass]], incorporating all the assemblage manufactured in Persia from the 3rd to the 19th centuries AD (Newman 1977).

The Sasanian Empire spanned a vast area from the [[Fertile Crescent]] to the Central Asian steppe, but with periods of expansion and contraction, reaching Damascus, Jerusalem, Egypt, Yemen or Pakistan. Some of the works were produced in the peripheral regions bordering the Empire and others came from beyond but following Sasanian designs. This creates "uncertainties about the precise place of manufacture of many Sasanian creations" (Demange 2007, 9) and confusion among terms since [[Mesopotamia]], for instance, can be at the same time [[Seleucia]] (Achaemenid), [[Ctesiphon]] (Sasanian) or [[Baghdad]] (Islamic).

Finally, the stylistic criteria can be very tricky due to several reasons. First, there is a considerable difficulty in discerning between the Parthian and Sasanian tradition (Negro Ponzi 1968-69), [[Byzantine]] and Sasanian (Goldstein 2005) and Sasanian and Islamic (Whitehouse 2005) to the extent that ‘Sasanian’ glassware, if carefully analysed, becomes Parthian (Negro Ponzi 1972, 216); that Byzantine pieces have many possibilities of being Sasanian (Saldern 1967), or that the same author examining the same specimen can conclude the piece is Sasanian in a first paper and Islamic in a second report (Erdmann 1950 and 1953).&lt;ref&gt;The references of Saldern and Erdmann have been taken from Whitehouse 2005,  pages 10 and 30 respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the most characteristic method of decoration utilized by Sasanian artisans, the [[wheel-cut technique]] (See Figure 2) was not originated at all by them.  There are splendid examples of wheel-cut vessels at least from the 5th century BC among the Achaemenians that are known both in East and West (Goldstein 1980). "Everything wheel-cut is not Sasanian." (Rogers 2005, 24).

== Origins of Sasanian Glass ==

See [[Roman glass]] or [[Anglo-Saxon Glass]] entries for the differences between [[glassmaking]] and [[glassworking]]

The Sasanian craftsmen smoothly continued the tradition of glassworking, inherited from the Romans and Parthians, transmitting it to the Islamic artisans when their Empire collapsed (Goldstein 1982 and 2005). Although they began from plain and [[mould-blown]] vessels close to the Parthian taste (Negro Ponzi 1984, See Figure 3), they soon generated their own genuine style especially recognizable in the ''’typical hemispherical bowls with round or hexagonal deep incised facets’'' (Negro Ponzi 1987, 272) and widely expanded it throughout all the Sasanian territory and even beyond their borders.

However, there is no such continuity in [[glassmaking]]. Recent studies have demonstrated that there are clear differences between the composition of Roman, Sasanian and Syro-Palestinian - contemporary to the latest- productions (Freestone 2006) and also between Sasanian, Parthian and Islamic manufactures (Mirti et al. 2008 and 2009; Brill 2005).

== The recipe of Sasanian glassmakers ==
[[File:Tabriz Museum Sasanid Glass 1.jpg|thumb|Sassanid glass bowls.]]

Sasanian glass is a silica-soda-lime composition with high levels of K and Mg: this means the use of plant-ash as a source of soda. The Roman and the Parthian glass, on the other hand, employed mineral salts for this purpose (Freestone 2006, Mirti et al. 2009). Consequently, there is no continuation of the formula.

Moreover, Sasanian glasses also show differences when compared with other plant-ash soda glasses.  Freestone analysis revealed that Syro-Palestinian productions were lower in Mg than Sasanian ones, and Brill (2005, 75) concluded that there is a general ''‘overlapping but no close agreement’'' between the Sasanian and the later [[Islamic glass]] and that the former ''‘do not bear a close enough chemical resemblance to any of the particular groups of Islamic glasses’''.
 
In fact, the Sasanian glass is different even within itself. Three recipes have been identified for the glassmaking (Mirti et al. 2008). The first one (minoritarian) is a silica-soda-lime glass with one evaporite as a flux that mainly appears in the earliest stages of the Empire (3rd century). The second group is divided into two other subgroups, both using sodic ash but exploiting different plants. One of them is present from the beginning of the Dynasty and the other from the 4th century onwards. A crucial difference between them, apart from the one mentioned, is that the second subgroup always utilised a purer source of silica. Since this third recipe produced more transparent glass, found in more sophisticated objects than the ones worked with the other recipes (Mirti et al. 2009) this has been interpreted as an argument for the existence of diverse formulas to satisfy the demand of different qualities of glass. It is significant that, in the quest for the transparency meeting the taste of the Sasanians, purer silica was also occasionally utilised in the first subgroup.

== The techniques of Sasanian glassworkers ==

The only technological innovation attributed to Sasanian glassworkers is ''‘the casting of a [[glass blank]] that could be carved as if it were a hard-stone’'' (Rogers 2005, 23). The rest of the arts were acquired from previous artisans. Thus [[wheel-cutting]] from Achaemenians (at least the 5th century BC if not earlier, Saldern 1963; Goldstein 1980); applied ornaments like trails and blobs of glass were introduced around the 3rd–2nd centuries BC and [[glassblowing]] appeared in the 1st century BC. Sasanian glass craftsmen did not invent anything revolutionary but rather developed the available arts to a degree of mastery. In fact, their expertise in glassworking settled the ''‘foundation for virtually all the methods used to produce glass in the Islamic world’'' (Goldstein 2005, 11).

Although it is possible to find some [[core-form]] objects produced by the Sasanians, these are rarities (Goldstein 2005, 28-62). The whole of the Sasanian assemblage is glassblowing. The most frequent technique among the Sasanians was to blow the object giving it a basic shape and then finishing it with the help of paddles, pincers and shears. Other techniques frequently used were [[mould-blowing]] and the [[mould-pressing]]. These two use the mould as the essential part of the process (See Figure 4). In the former the object is blown inside a mould, acquiring the shape and decoration of the final object.  In the second stage the mould is removed and the object is blown to the appropriate size. Mould-pressing consists of pressing the glass against an open mould, obtaining a positive of the final object.

These methods produced slightly asymmetrical objects but have the advantage of permitting a huge versatility in shapes and obtaining articles practically finished since shapes (and patterns) are given with any of the techniques and by means of non-complicate solutions, pinching, cutting, polishing, and applying, the final object is obtained (Negro Ponzi 1968; Goldstein 2005; Whitehouse 2005). These techniques agreed with the Sasanian taste for plainly decorated vessels; thus they do not use the cameo or the scratching solutions that were extremely popular during the Islamic times. Instead they prefer to work the glass cold, polishing and [[panel-and-face-cutting]], creating ‘''a contrast of highlights and shadows, while at the same time providing a better grip’'' (Goldstein 2005, 30).

== The creations of Sasanian glassworkers ==

''‘Best known Sasanian glasses are those decorated with overall patterns of ground, cut and polished hollow facets’'' (Whitehouse 2005, 41, See Figure 5), but this appears around the 5th century AD. Before it,  the ''‘commonest type, spread in all the proto and middle Sasanian levels’'' is a bowl or tumbler with ''‘straight or slightly rounded walls’'' (Negro Ponzi, 1984, 34).

The repertory of forms and functions is, nonetheless, markedly wider: lamps, jars, flasks, tumblers, decanting siphons, dishes, bottles, scrolls or pen cases, jugs, beakers, cups, goblets, sprinklers, balsamaria, chalices, spoons, etc., in all kind of sizes and shapes; round, square, cylindrical, tubular, tronco-conic, etc. and with multiple combinations of them: round bottles with long/short/cylindrical/square necks, tripod-footed bowls, hexagonal, elongated or spherical flasks, square bottles with tronco-conical necks, etc. both plain and decorated and both for ordinary and luxury uses. It is worth mentioning that there is solid evidence (Meyer 1995, Mirti et al. 2008) pointing out that Sasanian glass production was not only for goods of luxury items for a selected elite but also concerned with the manufacture of quotidian goods.

A constant within all the Sasanian production is the search for transparency in the glasses. As has been mentioned, for transparent objects they utilised a specific recipe but it is also true that they did not usually achieve pure transparency but very close results: transparent glasses with green, blue or grey-blue hues. The majority of the Sasanian glass is colourless (with transparent unintended colours caused by impurities in the silica).  There are generally yellowish-green or yellowish-brown tinges and a characteristic smoky-brown tinge frequently associated with the [[face-cut bowls]]. Whole vessels in plain colours are far less common among the Sasanians to the extent that many of the full-coloured examples are believed to be imported. They nevertheless utilised plain colour for decorative motifs.  But again according to their taste, thus trails or pads tend to be delicate (See Figure 8), thin and small, (though during the early Sasanian era are usually thick) setting off the reflective and sparkling surfaces obtained by polishing or cutting, or adding spiral or vertical ribs. It is very common to find that the applications - the application of prunts of glass was especially ''‘popular’'' among the Sasanians (Goldstein 2005, 14)- are equally colourless, applied and pinched, giving to the vessel a spiky aspect, appropriately described by Goldstein (2005) as ''‘sputnik’''. (See Figures 6-7)

== Significance of Sasanian glass ==

The Sasanian Empire ''‘enjoyed a reputation for luxury in Byzantine and Arab written accounts’'' (St. John Simpson 2000, 62). Not for nothing was this the setting of the [[Arabian Nights]]. Glass also reflects this situation: for example during the contraction of the production during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period (400-616AD) ''‘luxury wares were little in demand, with the exception of chip-cut vessels of the Sasanian type’'' (Rogers 2005, 23, See Figure 9).

To the East, Sasanian glass was equally recognised. China named the [[Silk Road]] as the Horse Road or the Glass Road, as Sasanian glass was ''‘highly appreciated’'' there (Gyselen 2007, 17).  Similarly in Japan, it appeared in the tombs (''Shoshoin, Okinoshima, Kamigamo'', etc.) of high-status nobility related to the Emperor (Roger 2005; Whitehouse 2005).

Sasanian glass had a rapid growth and distribution both within and without the borders of the Empire and was not only used in luxury items; glass objects destined for utilitarian uses spread all over the Empire (Meyer 1995) and, most important, over certain social classes that did not have access to it till that moment. The secrets of this success remain surely in the fabrication of different qualities of glass and in its style, simultaneously simple and sophisticated, creating ''‘unusual products based on definite designs that differed from the East Roman patterns’'' (Negro Ponzi 1968-69, 384) and in fact from all other productions manufactured at that date.

== Archaeological Record ==

Till now, there have been no clear examples of glass workshops or of glassmaking factories.  In fact excavated settlements with Sasanian glass are rather scarce: [[Seleucia]], Tell Baruda, [[Ctesiphon]], [[Veh Ardashir]], Choche, [[Nippur]], [[Samarra]] and a few more (Whitehouse 2005). A high number of the pieces have been found in funerary contexts, Tell Mahuz, Ghalekuti, Hassani Mahale, Abu Skhair, etc. A small paradox is that, although the Iranian Plateau is the core of the territory controlled by Sasanians, the archaeological record of glass production is rather meagre there, with the best examples of workshops concentrated on the borders of the empire, namely Northern Iraq (Saldern 1963 and 1966; St. John Simpson 2000; Whitehouse 2005).

This lack of archaeological finds means that most of the provenances of Sasanian glass are unknown; there are just vague notes on them like: "Eastern Roman Empire or Iran", "North-western Iraq", "Mesopotamia", "Iran or Iraq" with a large number of the vessels appearing in antiquities markets. Incidentally, this also causes the wideness of concepts among the different scholars mentioned above about what can be considered as Sasanian.

"We are a long way from a definitive picture of Islamic production through the ages". (Rogers 2005, 25)

'''Solnitsata''' ({{lang-bg|Солницата}}, "The Saltworks") was an ancient town located in present-day [[Bulgaria]], near the modern city of [[Provadia]]. Believed by Bulgarian archaeologists to be the oldest town in [[Europe]], Solnitsata was the site of a [[salt]] production facility approximately six millennia ago;&lt;ref name=Maugh&gt;{{cite news |title=Bulgarians find oldest European town, a salt production center |first=Thomas H. |last=Maugh II |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-oldest-european-town-20121101,0,3214695.story |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=1 November 2012 |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it flourished ca 4700-4200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120702232530/http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?category=Survival+of+Information Survival of Information: the earliest prehistoric town in Europe ]&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement was [[Defensive wall|walled]] to protect the salt, a crucial commodity in antiquity.&lt;ref name=Squires&gt;{{cite news |title=Archaeologists find Europe's most prehistoric town |first=Nick |last=Squires |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/bulgaria/9646541/Bulgaria-archaeologists-find-Europes-most-prehistoric-town-Provadia-Solnitsata.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=31 October 2012 |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its population has been estimated at only 350,&lt;ref name=Squires/&gt; archaeologist Vassil Nikolov argues that it meets established criteria as a prehistoric [[city]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naim.bg/contentFiles/ARH_2012_1_res1.pdf |title=Salt, early complex society, urbanization: Provadia-Solnitsata (5500-4200 BC) (Abstract) |format=PDF |first=Vassil |last=Nikolov |publisher=[[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salt production drove Solnitsata's economy, and the town is believed to have supplied salt throughout the [[Balkans]]. A large collection of [[gold]] objects nearby has led archaeologists to speculate that this trade resulted in considerable wealth for the town's residents.&lt;ref name=Maugh/&gt;

The town is believed to have been destroyed by an [[earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Boyko |last1=Ranguelov |first2=Vassil |last2=Nikolov  |title=Ancient earthquake data extraction by archeological findings |conference=[[European Geosciences Union|EGU]] General Assembly 2010. 2–7 May 2010.

[[File:Raymon de Peñaforte.jpg|thumb|[[Raymond of Peñafort]] founded one of the first schools of the ''Studia Linguarum''.]]
The '''''Studia Linguarum''''' (literally "Language Institutes") were the first attempt to [[Oriental studies|study oriental languages]] by the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]].{{sfn|McCabe|2008|p=29}} The need to study oriental languages was affirmed by the General Chapter of the [[Dominican Order]] in [[Paris]] in 1236.{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|p=77}} The objective of the schools was to help the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] liberate Christian captives in Islamic lands.{{sfn|McCabe|2008|p=29}}

==Description==
The first school of the ''Studia Linguarum'' was established in [[Tunis]] by [[Raymond of Peñafort]] in the early 13th century, where it was also designated as the ''Studium arabicum''.{{sfn|McCabe|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|p=77}}It is known that in 1250, the Provincial Chapter of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] sent 8 friars to the Tunis institute to study Arabic, including the famous Arabist [[Ramon Marti]].{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|p=77}} The school permitted some students to learn [[Arabic]] during the second half of the 13th century.{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|p=77}}

As a side effect of the establishment of these institutes, some Arabic scientific works were also translated in European languages, such as the ophthalmological work ''Liber Oculorum'' of [[Ali ibn Isa al-Kahhal|Ali Ibn Isa]] (Jesu Haly) by Friar [[Dominicus Marrochini]] of the ''Studium'' of [[Murcia]].{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|p=77}}

In 1311, the [[Council of Vienne]] further decided to create schools for the study of oriental languages in the universities of [[Paris]], [[Bologna]], [[Oxford]], [[Salamanca]] and [[Rome]].{{sfn|McCabe|2008|p=29}}

The '''Thames Discovery Programme''' is a [[community archaeology]] project, focusing on the archaeology of the River [[Thames]] on the [[Tideway]]. The Thames Discovery Programme (TDP) was launched in October 2008 and until September 2011, the project was supported by the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] and a grant from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hlf.org.uk/Pages/Home.aspx |title=Heritage Lottery Fund |publisher=Hlf.org.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211220147/http://www.hlf.org.uk/Pages/Home.aspx |archivedate=11 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is designed to communicate an understanding and informed enjoyment of the historic Thames to the widest possible audience, and to train and support members of the public (the Foreshore Recording and Observation Group or FROG) to monitor and record the [[archaeology]] of the foreshore during the lifetime of the project, and into the future.

The project builds on initiatives pioneered by the Museum of London’s Thames Archaeological Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/riverpedia/the-thames-archaeological-survey |title=Thames Archaeological Survey |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that took place from 1993–1999, the work of commercial archaeological units, such as [[Museum of London Archaeology Service|Museum of London Archaeology]]&lt;ref name="museumoflondonarchaeology1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondonarchaeology.org.uk/|title=Museum of London Archaeology |publisher=museumoflondonarchaeology.org.uk |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Thames Explorer Trust’s innovative education projects. Over three years, archaeologists from the programme surveyed 20 archaeological sites along the tidal Thames in the Greater London area, supported by the work of the Foreshore Recording and Observation Group or FROG,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/about/the_frog |title=The FROG |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=1 January 2010 |accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who monitor the surveyed sites for changes, as the daily tides scour away the remaining archaeological features. The FROG is made up of volunteer members of the public, who are trained in foreshore recording techniques, the history and archaeology of the River Thames, health and safety and participation in digital media by the TDP team.

The TDP currently has a small staff team and is hosted by [[Museum of London Archaeology Service|Museum of London Archaeology]].&lt;ref name="museumoflondonarchaeology1"/&gt; Other partners and supporters include the Thames Explorer Trust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thames-explorer.org.uk/ |title=Thames Explorer Trust |publisher=Thames-explorer.org.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Museum of London]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/ Museum of London] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222235451/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/ |date=22 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Port of London Authority]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Port of London – www.pla.co.uk |url=http://www.pla.co.uk/ |title=Port of London Authority |publisher=Pla.co.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[English Heritage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/ |title=English Heritage |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University College London]] [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/ |title=Institute of Archaeology |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cohen |first= Nathalie |authorlink= |author2=Gustav Milne |author3=Eliott Wagg  |date= 2012-12-01|title=The Thames Discovery Programme: Public Engagement and Research on London’s Foreshore |journal=Archaeology International |volume= 15 |issue= |pages= 99–106 |id= |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5334/ai.1506 |doi=10.5334/ai.1506|pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discoveries ==
[[File:Recording the causeway at Isleworth.JPG|thumb|Recording the causeway at Isleworth]]
Using data generated by the Thames Archaeological Survey, the Thames Discovery Programme selected twenty key sites across the [[Greater London]] area for further recording and on-going monitoring during 2008 - 2011. The first site chosen was [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House, London]]; in February 2009, FROG members recorded the causeway, parts of the 1819 riverside wall, the Custom House [[gridiron plan|gridiron]], the remains of two [[ship|vessels]] partly buried on the foreshore and a multi-phase [[revetment]] structure located under [[Billingsgate]] Wharf.

In April 2009, an examination of access to the foreshore at [[Isleworth]] included recording the 20th century boat [[slipway]] and the remains of the Victorian ‘Church Ferry’ [[causeway]].

During low tides in June and July 2009, survey and recording at [[Charlton, London]], formerly the location of Castle’s Shipbreakers Yard focused on the ‘stack’ of very large ships timbers surviving at the top of the foreshore which represent the remains of one or more [[warship]] class vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23724819-volunteers-hunt-bank-of-thames-for-clues-of-lost-victorian-warships.do |title=Volunteers hunt bank of Thames for clues of lost Victorian warships |work=Evening Standard |location=London |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nautical]] remains are very well represented at this site where, in addition to the ‘stack’, we have also discovered a slipway constructed of reused ship and boat timbers, as well as the remains of at least three smaller vessels. During the 2009 Summer Season, teams worked at Alderman Stairs (near [[St Katharine Docks]]), [[Putney]] and [[Bermondsey]]. In November 2009, the first FROG-led project at Carrara Wharf in [[Fulham]] recorded part of the 1729 bridge to [[Putney]], while a TDP survey earlier in the year on the foreshore in front of [[Fulham Palace]] found [[Iron Age]] timber piles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shepherdsbush.ealinggazette.co.uk/2009/11/fulham-foreshore-reveals-ancie.html |title=Fulham foreshore reveals ancient secrets |publisher=Shepherdsbush.ealinggazette.co.uk |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During January 2010, investigations on the [[Isle of Dogs]] with the Thames and Field Metal Detecting Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesandfield.com/ |title=Thames and Field Metal Detecting Society |publisher=Thamesandfield.com |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered the remains of a human skeleton, dating to the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/discoveries-on-the-isle-of-dogs |title=Discoveries on the Isle of Dogs |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=7 January 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tower Buckle.jpg|thumb|left|A buckle found on the Tower of London foreshore in July 2010]]
During the 2010 Summer Season, work continued on the [[Isle of Dogs]], recording the remains of the slipways used during the launch of the [[SS Great Eastern]], the last project of engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. In July 2010, the TDP team and the FROG worked on the foreshore at the [[Tower of London]], undertaking survey and recording of an area normally closed to the public. Sections of the riverside wall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/tower-of-london-fieldwork-report |title=Tower of London Fieldwork Report |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=4 August 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; were recorded and data collected to create a contour survey of the foreshore surface. 

The team also worked with members of the Society of Thames Mudlarks and the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finds.org.uk/ |title=Portable Antiquities Scheme |publisher=Finds.org.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to record artefacts found on the surface. The TDP field team then moved to [[Greenwich]] where the riverside wall was again examined, together with parts of a Tudor timber jetty and a newly discovered medieval structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/greenwich-fieldwork-report |title=Greenwich Fieldwork Report |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=11 September 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also featured on the BBC's [[Digging for Britain]]. During late August 2010, work was undertaken at two sites in West London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/strand-on-the-green-frog-report |title=Strand on the Green Report |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in September, fieldwork was undertaken at Tripcockness near the [[Royal Arsenal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/ballast-blog |title=Tripcockness Fieldwork Report |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=12 September 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rotherhithe]].

In January 2011, the project published the results of recent investigations at Vauxhall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/london-s-oldest-find-discovered-at-vauxhall |title=Vauxhall discoveries |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the remains of the oldest structure so far discovered in the London area, dating to the late Mesolithic period, have been recorded by the Thames Discovery Programme, English Heritage and the Museum of London.

During the 2011 summer field season, the TDP worked at [[Brentford]], recording the remains of two vessels abandoned on the foreshore, and at [[Wapping]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/raindrops-keep-falling |title=Raindrops keep falling |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=9 August 2011 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; surveying the watermans' causeway and nautical remains. Further fieldwork was also undertaken at Greenwich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/greenwich-fieldwork-update|title=Greenwich fieldwork update |publisher=Thamesdiscovery.org |date=12 June 2011 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Tower of London foreshore.

== Outreach and events ==

The Thames Discovery Programme runs a programme of events and activities designed to engage the public with the archaeology and history of the river. [[Outreach]] activities undertaken by the project including public lectures, small exhibitions, information stands, guided walks on the foreshore, observation of the FROG members in action on site and events for families and school groups, seminars, workshops and conferences. 

In 2009 the Thames Discovery Programme worked with a number of different organisations including Fulham Palace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulhampalace.org/ |title=Fulham Palace |publisher=Fulham Palace |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historic Royal Palaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/ |title=Historic Royal Palaces |publisher=Hrp.org.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunnersbury Park Museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hounslow.info/arts/gunnersburyparkmuseum/ |title=Gunnersbury Park |publisher=Hounslow.gov |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camden Young Archaeologists Club,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camdenyoungarchaeologists.org.uk/default.asp Camden Young Archaeologists Club] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325072443/http://www.camdenyoungarchaeologists.org.uk/default.asp |date=25 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of East London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uel.ac.uk/ |title=University of East London |publisher=Uel.ac.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thames Explorer Trust, Thames Estuary Partnership, the London Archaeological Archive and Research Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/Collections-Research/LAARC/ |title=LAARC |publisher=museumoflondon.org.uk |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Worshipful Company of Antiquarian Collectors, the Museum of London and [[Museum in Docklands]].   During 2010 and 2011, the team again worked with a number of different organisations including the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] at [[Rainham Marshes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/guide/r/rainhammarshes/ |title=RSPB Rainham |publisher=Rspb.org.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discover Greenwich,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldroyalnavalcollege.org/discover-greenwich/ |title=Discover Greenwich |publisher=Oldroyalnavalcollege.org |date=23 March 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107003836/http://www.oldroyalnavalcollege.org/discover-greenwich/ |archivedate=7 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historic Royal Palaces at the [[Tower of London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/ |title=Tower of London |publisher=hrp.org.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Southwark Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cathedral.southwark.anglican.org/ |title=Southwark Cathedral |publisher=cathedral.southwark.anglican.org |year=2012 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The project also featured in the Archaeology in Action gallery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/London-Wall/Whats-on/Exhibitions-Displays/Archaeology-in-Action.htm |title=Archaeology in Action |publisher=museumoflondon.org.uk |accessdate=30 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231193716/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/London-Wall/Whats-on/Exhibitions-Displays/Archaeology-in-Action.htm |archivedate=31 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Museum of London]]. Thousands of members of the public have visited the [[foreshore]] and attended other events, particularly during the two-week [[Festival of British Archaeology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://festival.britarch.ac.uk/ |title=Festival of British Archaeology |publisher=Festival.britarch.ac.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; coordinated by the [[Council for British Archaeology]] in July each year. In July 2009, the Thames Discovery Programme celebrated the Festival at Fulham Palace and on the foreshore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://festival.britarch.ac.uk/blog |title=Thames Discovery at Fulham Palace |publisher=Festival.britarch.ac.uk |accessdate=13 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303222307/http://festival.britarch.ac.uk/blog |archivedate=3 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 the team were at the [[Tower of London]], [[Hall Place]] and the Museum of London.

A detailed report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/about/community-archaeology-report |title=Community Archaeology Report |publisher=thamesdiscovery.org |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the events, activities and fieldwork undertaken by the Thames Discovery Programme during the Heritage Lottery Funded phase of the project (October 2008-September 2011) is available on the project website.

'''The Rule of the Blessing''' ('''1QSb''') is a very fragmentary text once thought to be part of the text of the [[Community Rule]] scroll found in Cave 1 at [[Qumran]] as part of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].  It is added as one of two appendices (including the equally [[eschatological]] [[The Rule of the Congregation|Rule of the Congregation]]) following the book of the [[Community Rule]], on one of the first seven scrolls discovered at the [[Qumran]] site.  The Rule of the Blessing includes three [[benedictions]] for use during the [[eschaton]]: one for the general assembly of the [[eschatological]] Tribe of [[Israel]], which describes a sort of “living water” bringing them into a new [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] with God, one concerning [[The Kohanim sons of Tzadok|the Kohen (priest) Sons of Zadok]], chosen by God who will act “like angels” and lead [[Israel]] after the War.  The third prayer is that for the messianic meal, to bless the 
“Prince,” or Davidic [[messiah]], who has come to deliver [[Israel]]. Similar prayers are found elsewhere in the scrolls, and some believe that this particular manuscript may be a collection of prayers for general, daily use.

'''Thematic structure''' is a concept in [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roca |first=I. M. |year=1992 |title=Thematic Structure: Its Role in Grammar |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=9783110134063}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people talk, there are purposes in three separable parts of utterances, the act of speech, the [[Proposition|propositional content]] and the thematic structure. Because speaking is cooperative, in order that the speaking can be effective in the [[conversation]], speakers have to pay attention to their listeners’ knowledge, state of mind and level of understanding. Speakers can assume that listeners know or do not know what speakers are talking about. 

According to [[Michael Halliday]], the speakers’ judgements about the listeners’ current mental states are reflected in what is called the thematic structure used. 

The thematic structure has three main functions:
*To convey given information and new information
*To subject and predicate
*To frame and insert

A thematic structure is a preoccupying conception of a proposition which runs throughout a media text, usually around an initiating topic. It strategically ties together a number of more specific conception or statements on the basis of particular social forms of knowledge and social forms of perception and belief. A thematic structure helps to make a media text coherent -- it orients a text around a central theme of a strand of related themes running through a story.  (reference: David Deacon(2007), Researching communications,p174)

The term "'''unsaid'''" refers what is not explicitly stated, what is hidden and/or implied in the speech of an individual or a group of people.

The unsaid may be the product of intimidation; of a mulling over of thought; or of bafflement in the face of the inexpressible.&lt;ref&gt;Robyn Brandenberg, ''Powerful Pedagogy'' (2008) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistics==
[[Sociolinguistics]] points out that in normal communication what is left unsaid is as important as what is actually said&lt;ref&gt;R. Wardhaugh, ''An Introduction to Sociolinguistics'' (2011) p. 310&lt;/ref&gt;—that we expect our auditors regularly to fill in the [[social context]]/[[social norm|norm]]s of our conversations as we proceed.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Gee/M. Handforthed., ''The Routledge Handbook of Discourse Analysis'' (2013) Ch 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Basil Bernstein]] saw one difference between the [[restricted code]] and the [[elaborated code]] of speech is that more would be left implicit in the former than the latter.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mesthrie, ''Introducing Sociolinguistics'' (2009) p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnology==
In [[ethnology]], [[ethnomethodology]] established a strong link between '''unsaid''' and ''axiomatic''.
[[Harold Garfinkel]], following [[Durkheim]], stressed that in any given situation, even a legally binding contract, the terms of agreement rest upon the 90% of unspoken assumptions that underlie the visible (spoken) tip of the interactive iceberg.&lt;ref&gt;A. Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'' (1974) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward T. Hall]] argued that much [[cross-cultural communication|cross-cultural miscommunication]] stemmed from neglect of the silent, unspoken, but differing [[cultural pattern]]s that each participant unconsciously took for granted.&lt;ref&gt;Edward T. Hall, ''The Silent Language'' (1990) p. vii-viii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalysis==
[[Luce Irigaray]] has emphasised the importance of listening to the unsaid dimension of discourse in psychoanalytic practice&lt;ref&gt;S. Todd ed., ''Learning Desire'' (2013) p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;—something which may shed light on the unconscious [[Fantasy (psychology)|phantasies]] of the analysand.&lt;ref&gt;M. Edelson, ''Language and Interpretation in Psychoanalysis'' (1984) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Other psychotherapies have also emphasised the importance of the [[Non-verbal communication|non-verbal component]] of the patient's communication,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974)  p. 314-7&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes privileging this over the verbal content.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Perls, ''Gestalt Therapy Verbatim'' (1970) p. 57-8&lt;/ref&gt; Behind all such thinking stands [[Freud]]'s dictum: "no mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips...at every pore".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. Argyle ed., ''Social Encounters'' (1973) p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==
*[[Sherlock Holmes]] is said to have owed his success to his attention to the unsaid in his client's communications.&lt;ref&gt;Edward T. Hall, ''The Silent Language'' (1990) p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[Small World: An Academic Romance|Small World]]'', the heroine cheekily excuses her lack of note-taking to a Sorbonne professor by saying: "it is not what you say that impresses me most, it is what you are silent about: ideas, morality, love, death, things...''Vos silences profonds''".&lt;ref&gt;[[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]], ''Small World'' (1985) p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2096">'''Vladimir Nikolayevich Toporov''' ({{lang-ru|Влади́мир Никола́евич Топоро́в}}; 5 July 1928 in [[Moscow]]{{spaced ndash}}5 December 2005 in Moscow) was a leading [[Russia]]n [[Philology|philologist]] associated with the [[Tartu-Moscow semiotic school]]. His wife was [[Tatyana Elizarenkova]].

Toporov authored more than 1500 works, including ''Akhmatova and Dante'' (1972), ''Towards the Reconstruction of the Indo-European Rite'' (1982), ''Aeneas: a Man of Destiny'' (1993), ''Myth. Rite. Symbol. Image'' (1995), ''Holiness and Saints in the Russian Spiritual Culture'' (1998), and ''Petersburg Text of Russian Literature'' (2003). He translated the [[Dhammapada]] into Russian and supervised the ongoing edition of the most complete vocabulary of the [[Prussian language]] to date (5 volumes).

Among Toporov's many honours were the [[USSR State Prize]] (1990), which he turned down to voice his protest against the repressive policies of the Soviet administration in [[Lithuania]]; the first ever [[Solzhenitsyn Prize]] (1998), and the [[Andrei Bely Prize]] for 2004. He was a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and many other scholarly societies.

Based on a long-standing research program of the [[World Bank]], the '''Worldwide Governance Indicators''' capture six key dimensions of [[governance]] (Voice &amp; Accountability, Political Stability and Lack of Violence, [[Government]] Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, [[Rule of law|Rule of Law]], and Control of [[political corruption|Corruption]]) between 1996 and present. They measure the quality of governance in over 200 [[country|countries]], based on close to 40 data sources produced by over 30  organizations worldwide and are updated annually since 2002.

The governance indicators contribute to the growing empirical research of governance which have provided [[activism|activists]] and [[Reform movement|reformers]] worldwide with [[advocacy]] tools for policy reform and monitoring. The indicators, and the underlying data behind them, are part of the current research and opinions that have reinforced the experiences and observations of reform-minded individuals in government, [[civil society]], and the private sector, that [[good governance]] is key for [[international development|development]].&lt;ref name="Kaufman"&gt;Kaufmann, Daniel and Kraay, Aart, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=316861 "Growth Without Governance"] (November 2002). World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 2928.&lt;/ref&gt; Their growing recognition of the link between good governance and successful development, as empirical evidence suggests,&lt;ref name="Kaufman"/&gt; has stimulated demand for monitoring the quality of governance across countries and within individual countries over time. Virtually all of the individual data sources underlying the aggregate indicators are, along with the aggregate indicators themselves, publicly available.

The Worldwide Governance Indicators are a compilation of the perceptions of a very diverse group of respondents, collected in large number of [[Statistical survey|surveys]] and other cross-country [[Evaluation|assessments]] of governance. Some of these instruments capture the views of firms, individuals, and public officials in the countries being assessed. Others reflect the views of [[NGO]]s and aid donors with considerable experience in the countries being assessed, while others are based on the assessments of commercial risk-rating agencies.

A complementary vision of the macro-level Worldwide Governance Indicators are the [[World Bank Governance Surveys]], which are country level governance assessment tools developed by the [[World Bank Institute]].

==Criticisms==

The Worldwide Governance Indicators offer a useful snapshot of some perceptions of a country’s quality of governance but researchers have pointed out significant problems in their construction. These critiques have been extensively rebutted by the WGI authors in several publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=965077 Kaufmann, Daniel, Aart Kraay and Massimo Mastruzzi (2007). "The Worldwide Governance Indicators: Answering the Critics". World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No 4149.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Daniel, Aart Kraay and Massimo Mastruzzi (2010). "Response to: What Do the Worldwide Governance Indicators Measure".  ''European Journal of Development Research''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/ResponseToKnackLangbein.pdf Kaufmann, Daniel, Aart Kraay and Massimo Mastruzzi (2010).

* Not reproducible: Many of the indicators underlying each source’s ratings, are not published.
* Too complex: The WGI “Control of Corruption” uses 23 combinations of sources just for East Europe and Central Asia. The sheer number and diversity of indicators, produced by others, in a single WGI make it very difficult to understand.
* Arbitrary: For example, WGI use the indicator “Environmental regulations hurt competitiveness” from the World Economic Forum’s Executive Opinion Survey, but ignore that Survey’s several questions that give high ratings to countries with a high standard of environmental protection. 
* Absence of an underlying theory of "good" governance: no normative concept or unifying single theory to distinguish between good or bad governance. When are taxes, labour or environmental regulatory protection desirable and when are they excessive? 
* Hidden biases: Low weight given to household surveys relative to the weights of expert assessments and firm surveys. For example, Gallup’s World Poll that asks citizens about their exposure to crime gets zero weight for "Rule of Law", but Global Insight Business Risk and Conditions, a U.S. commercial business information provider that measures the crime risk to businesses, gets the third highest weight.
* Lack of comparability over time and space: For example, the WGI “Control of Corruption” for Eastern Europe and Central Asia has 23 different combinations of sources, but only four pair of countries ratings are based on a common set of sources.
* Lack of actionability: WGI offers little guidance to concrete actions to improve the quality of governance. For example, an indicator for Rule of Law "how secure business people feel about their property" not ''why'' they feel that way. 
* Over-selling: The World Bank Institute advertises its WGIs as "reliable measurements of governance", but for example gives the misleading impression that the views of ordinary citizens are well represented, making the indicators particularly attractive to donor agencies concerned about the poor. WBI heavily stressed inclusion of the Gallup World Poll, a cross-country household survey available for a large number of countries, but Gallup’s World Poll gets zero weight on two WGIs, marginal weight on two other WGIs and provides no data for the remaining two.
* Lack of conceptual clarity:  “[T]he six governance indicators measure a broad underlying concept of ‘effective governance’ …  they appear to say the same thing, with different words …  the six indexes do not discriminate usefully among different aspects of governance. Rather, each of the indexes – whatever its label – merely reflects perceptions of the quality of governance more broadly. An implication is that they may have limited use as guides for policymakers, and for academic studies of the causes and consequences of ‘good governance’ as well… their availability may well have crowded out efforts at measuring the impact of institutions as they really exist in a particular place on real outcomes."

==Strengths==

Despite the above noted limitations and concerns recent econometric research looking at how reliable some of these indicators are, vis-a-vis data collected from natural experiments and other observational surveys, have actually concluded that the Good Governance Indicators do in fact  seem to be measuring, albeit imperfectly, levels of corruption and government effectiveness. &lt;ref&gt; {{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/113281515516828746/pdf/WPS8299.pdf |title= Can We Measure the Power of the Grabbing Hand?

'''Zenitism''' ({{Lang-sh|Zenitizam / Зенитизам}}) was an [[art]] movement in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] from 1921 until 1926, first in [[Zagreb]] from 1921 to 1924 and from 1924 in [[Belgrade]]. The movement was mainly involved in [[visual arts]], [[graphic design]], [[poetry]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[film]], [[architecture]] and [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.nb.rs/zenit/english.html&lt;/ref&gt; Like other avant-garde movements at the time, it held anti-war, anti-bourgeois and anti-nationalist views and rejected traditional culture and art. Micić defined the movement as "abstract metacosmic expressionism."

Most of its ideas were communicated through the [[Zenit (magazine)|Zenit]] magazine which [[Ljubomir Micić]] launched and which published 43 issues.

==The movement==

The movement was established following [[World War I]], during which [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] lost a million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Erlikman, Vadim (2004). Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik. Moscow. {{ISBN|5-93165-107-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some artists from the region were known in Europe, Zenitism was the first notable art movement from the Balkans in Europe.
