      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2327">'''1981 Karnataka liquor deaths''' are deaths in [[Karnataka]] state in [[India]] in 1981 by consuming illegal [[liquor]]. In July 1981 about 308 people died in [[Bangalore]] by illicit liquor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/10/world/deaths-from-illegal-liquor-rise-to-308-in-southern-india.html |title=Deaths From Illegal Liquor Rise to 308 in Southern India |date=July 10, 1981 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adulteration of cheap liquor by [[methyl]] alcohol resulted in deaths.

Availability of cheap spurious alcohol, (known as hooch) is a problem around the [[Tannery Road]] area of the [[Bangalore Cantonment]], with many dwellers getting addicted. Notorious bootlegger Marimuthu (who later became a councillor of [[Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike|BBMP]]) and Ameer Jan were running the racket. Hootch is brewed from industrial alcohol, by separating Methyl Alcohol, and adding water - A dangerous process which can leave traces of poisonous [[Methyl Alcohol]]. The brew is slow poison, damaging kidney and intestines, leading to slow death. On 7 July 1981, about 300 people (Official figures 229) around the [[Tannery Road]] area died as a result of consuming this spurious alcohol. Most of the victims were poor [[Dalit]]s. Police registered cases against 63 people, but none were convicted or punished. An enquiry commission revealed a connection between some politicians and the bootleggers. A paltry sum of INR 1000 per family was paid to the victims by the [[R. Gundu Rao|Gundu Rao]] government.&lt;ref name=Hooch&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hanumantharaya|first1=C H|title=The Big Hooch Tragedy|url=http://talkmag.in/cms/columns/crimefolio/item/421-the-big-hooch-tragedy|accessdate=4 January 2015|issue=Bangalore|publisher=Talk|date=14 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104095842/http://talkmag.in/cms/columns/crimefolio/item/421-the-big-hooch-tragedy|archive-date=2015-01-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ofcom complaints==
21 people complained to the national television regulator, [[Ofcom]], that the explicitness of the sexual scenes breached obscenity and broadcasting regulations, and that the series imparted "inappropriate information to vulnerable young girls". Ofcom ruled that there was no rule banning the showing of genuine sexual acts on free-to-air television, and that "in [their] view the portrayal of sex in this programme genuinely sought to inform and educate on sex", concluding that "whilst the visuals were explicit at times, nothing was transmitted in a manner that could be construed as having the potential to harm people under the age of 18", particularly given its context as a serious factual programme, and as such, it was ruled that the episodes were not in breach of any broadcasting regulations.&lt;ref name=ofcam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/obb77/issue77.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930024022/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/obb77/issue77.pdf |title=Ofcom broadcast bulletin |issue=77 |page=13 |work=[[Ofcom]] |date=29 January 2007 |accessdate=17 June 2014 |archive-date=30 September 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
The show went off the air after 8 episodes for one series in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3033">'''Adopted child syndrome''' is a controversial term that has been used to explain behaviors in [[adoption|adopted]] children that are claimed to be related to their adoptive status. Specifically, these include problems in [[Human bonding|bonding]], [[attachment disorder]]s, [[lie|lying]], stealing, defiance of authority, and acts of violence. The term has never achieved acceptance in the professional community. The term is not found in the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual'', 4th edition, TR]].

== History of the term ==
David Kirschner, who coined the term, says that most adoptees are not disturbed and that the syndrome only applies to "a small clinical subgroup".&lt;ref name=Lifton1975&gt;{{cite book |title=Lost and Found: The Adoption Experience |last=Lifton |first=Betty Jean |year=1975 |publisher=Dial Press |isbn=0-06-097132-0 |url=http://www.bjlifton.com/books.htm |pages=274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers Brodizinsky, Schechter, and Henig&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Being Adopted: The Lifelong Search for Self |last=Brodzinsky |first=David M. |author2=Marshall D. Schecter|author3=Robin Marantz Henig |year=1993 |publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=0-385-41426-9 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/being-adopted-the-lifelong-search-for-self/oclc/466100270}}&lt;/ref&gt; find that in a review of the literature, generally children adopted before the age of six-months fare no differently than children raised with their biological parents.  Later problems that develop among children adopted from the child welfare system at an older age are usually associated with the effects of chronic early maltreatment in the caregiving relationship; [[abuse]] and [[neglect]].

Psychologist [[Betty Jean Lifton]], herself an adopted person, has written extensively on psychopathology in adopted people, primarily in ''Lost and Found: The Adoption Experience'', and ''Journey of the Adopted Self: A Quest for Wholeness'' and briefly discusses Adopted child syndrome.&lt;ref name=Lifton1975/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Journey of the Adopted Self: A Quest for Wholeness |last=Lifton |first=Betty Jean |year=1994 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-03675-9|url=http://www.amfor.net/acs/|quote=Adopted Child Syndrome page, including bibliography|ref=Lifton1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jerome.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7698">'''Bioprocess engineering''', also '''biochemical engineering''', is a specialization of  [[chemical engineering]] or [[Biological engineering]], It deals with the design and development of equipment and processes for the manufacturing of products such as [[agriculture]], [[food]], [[fodder|feed]], [[pharmaceuticals]], [[nutraceuticals]], [[chemicals]], and [[polymers]] and [[paper]] from biological materials &amp; treatment of waste water. 
Bioprocess engineering is a conglomerate of mathematics, biology and industrial design,and consists of various spectrums like designing of [[bioreactors]], study of fermentors (mode of operations etc.). It also deals with studying various biotechnological processes used in industries for large scale production of biological product for optimization of yield in the end product and the quality of end product. Bioprocess engineering may include the work of mechanical, electrical, and industrial engineers to apply principles of their disciplines to processes based on using living cells or sub component of such cells.&lt;ref&gt;Bioprocess engineering- Basic concepts; Shular, Michael A., kargi, Fikret, Prentice Hall of India, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=August 2016}}
In [[physical fitness]], '''body composition''' is used to describe the percentages of [[fat]], [[bone]], [[water]] and [[muscle]] in [[human bodies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = composition of the body – FREE composition of the body information {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: Find composition of the body research|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O128-compositionofthebody.html|website = www.encyclopedia.com|accessdate = 2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because muscular tissue takes up less space in our body than fat tissue, our body composition, as well as our weight, determines leanness. Two people of the same sex and body weight may look completely different because they have a different body composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Body Composition Tests|url = http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/Body-Composition-Tests_UCM_305883_Article.jsp|website = www.heart.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Body density==
The most accurate estimation of body composition is derived from body density by means of the equation of fractional densities which states that the overall density of a mixture containing more than one substance (each with a different density) can be calculated if the proportion and density  of each component substance is known.  For determination of body composition the body is often assumed to be composed of four basic substances ("four compartment model") with the general form of the equation as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;1/Db = w/Dw + f/Df + p/Dp + m/Dm&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Siri&gt;{{cite journal |author=Siri William E |title=The gross composition of the body |journal=Advances in Biological and Medical Physics |volume=4|pages=239–280|year=1956|pmid=13354513}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|262}}
 
Where: &lt;math&gt;Db&lt;/math&gt; = overall body density, &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; = proportion of water, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; = proportion of fat, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; = proportion of protein, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; = proportion of mineral, &lt;math&gt;Dw&lt;/math&gt; = density of water, &lt;math&gt;Df&lt;/math&gt; = density of fat, &lt;math&gt;Dp&lt;/math&gt; = density of protein, &lt;math&gt;Dm&lt;/math&gt; = density of mineral

In a research laboratory setting, the overall density of the body (Db) is calculated from its mass and volume (Db = mass/volume). The mass of the body is found by simply weighing a person on a scale.  The volume of the body is most easily and accurately determined by completely immersing a person in water and calculating the volume of water from the weight of water that is displaced (via "underwater weighing").  The proportions of water, protein and mineral in the body are found by various chemical and radiometric tests.&lt;ref name=Siri&gt;{{cite journal |author=Siri William E |title=The gross composition of the body |journal=Advances in Biological and Medical Physics |volume=4|pages=239–280|year=1956|pmid=13354513}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|239–278}}  The densities of water, fat, protein and mineral are either measured or estimated.  The equation is then rearranged to solve for the proportion of fat (f) from the other quantities.

A reasonably accurate [[Body fat percentage|estimation of body fat]] can be obtained by means of a "two compartment model" of the human body which is based upon two simplifying assumptions:  1. Human fat has a density of 0.9 grams/ml, and 2. The lean (non-fat) components of the human body have an overall density of 1.1 grams/ml.

The two compartment model allows for an estimation of the proportions of fat and lean components of the body to be made from the overall body density.  And, as explained above, the overall body density (Db) is easily calculated from body mass and body volume. Rearranging the equation of fractional densities to solve for the proportion of fat (f) will yield the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;f = 495/Db - 450&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Siri William E |title=Body composition from fluid spaces and density: analysis of methods |journal=Donner laboratory of biophysics and medical physics |volume=UCRL 3349 |page=14 |year=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The density of human fat is remarkably constant across all sub-groups studied but variations have been reported in the density of the fat free mass (i.e. lean or non-fat components).  To address these differences, unique equations for the two compartment model have been proposed for specific populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wagner DR, Heyward VH |title=Measures of body composition in blacks and whites: a comparative review |journal=J Clin Nutr |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=1392–1402 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DEXA==
Body composition measurement with [[dual energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DEXA) is used increasingly for a variety of clinical and research applications. A DEXA scan requires medical supervision by a radiologist and some consider it to be the new "Gold Standard" in body composition testing. Total body scans using DEXA give accurate and precise measurements of body composition, including bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD), lean tissue mass, fat tissue mass, and fractional contribution of fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kiebzak GM, Leamy LJ, Pierson LM, Nord RH, Zhang ZY |title=Measurement precision of body composition variables using the lunar DPX-L densitometer |journal=J Clin Densitom |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=35–41 |year=2000 |pmid=10745300 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/JCD:3:1:035 |doi=10.1385/jcd:3:1:035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimation of body fatness from body density (by means of underwater weighing) was accepted as the "gold standard" for many decades.  Some researchers now claim that whole body scanning techniques (e.g. "DEXA") are the new "gold standard".  But these claims are somewhat dubious since the scanning algorithms are validated against body composition assessments based on fractional density from underwater weighing.

DEXA measurements are highly reproducible if the same type of machine is used (citation needed), making them excellent for monitoring pharmaceutical therapy, nutritional or exercise intervention, sports training and or other body composition altering programs. They are also fast, simple, non-invasive, and expose the subject to a level of x-rays less than that of a cross-country flight. DEXA exams provide both total body and up to 14 regional (trunk, individual arms &amp; legs, android, gynoid, etc.) results.  However, the role of DEXA in clinical evaluations and research studies has been questioned by Wang et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang ZM, Deurenberg P, Guo SS, Pietrobelli A, Wang J, ((Pierson RN Jr)), Heymsfield SB |title=Six-compartment body composition model: inter-method comparisons of total body fat measurement |journal=Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord |volume=22 |pages=329–337 |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; who stated that "the errors of the DXA [DEXA] method are still of concern if it were to be used as the criterion."

==Air displacement plethysmography==
[[File:Adult body composition through air displacement plethysmography.jpg|thumb|Body composition measurement with [[air displacement plethysmography]] or whole-body air displacement plethysmography (ADP) technology]]

Another technique for measuring body composition has been developed for measuring body volume using a different method than underwater weighing.  The technique uses air as opposed to water and is known as [[air displacement plethysmography]] (ADP).  Subjects enter a sealed chamber that measures their body volume through the displacement of air in the chamber.  Body volume is combined with [[body weight]] (mass) in order to determine body density.  The technique then estimates the percentage of body fat and [[lean body mass]] (LBM) through empirically derived equations similar to those used with underwater weighing (for the density of fat and fat free mass).

== From conductivity==
Another method is [[bioelectrical impedance analysis]]  (BIA), which uses the resistance of electrical flow through the body to estimate body fat.  Unfortunately, BIA is highly sensitive to hydration status and water intake.  Drinking water dilutes the electrolytes in the body making it less conductive as does increasing body fat.

== Body Volume Indicator ==

The Body Volume Indicator (BVI) is a technique used for measuring body shape. Initially, BVI technology employed white light scanning machines to measure an individuals body shape&lt;ref&gt;Jose Medina-Inojosa et al. (2016) "Reliability of a 3D Body Scanner for Anthropometric Measurements of Central Obesity". Obes Open Access. 2(3): 10.16966/2380-5528.122.&lt;/ref&gt;. However, recent technological advances in 3D measurement have enabled BVI to be calculated using images taken on a smartphone.  Two images are required to create an individual 3D silhouette. By comparing this 3D silhouette with MRI data, body volume and fat distribution can be calculated [http://www.bodyvolume.com/about-bvi/ (BVI website)].

==Skin folds==
Body composition can also be measured using the skin fold test, which is performed using a tool called a caliper. It can be done in nine steps: 
# Take measurements on the right side of the body.
# Mark client up.
# Pinch skin (KM) above mark
# Pull fat away from muscles
# Place caliper halfway between top and bottom of mark
# Allow caliper to settle (1–2 seconds)
# Take reading – repeat 15 seconds
# Add up total (4) – average
# Calculate body fat %

A common skin fold method is by using gun style [[caliper]]s to measure the thickness of [[subcutaneous fat]] in multiple places on the body. This includes the abdominal area, the [[subscapularis muscle|subscapular]] region, arms, buttocks and thighs. These measurements are then used to estimate total body fat.

==Ultrasound==
Ultrasound has also been used to measure subcutaneous fat thickness, and by using multiple points an estimation of body composition can be made.  Ultrasound has the advantage of being able to also directly measure muscle thickness and quantify intramuscular fat.{{citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=documentation needed here}}

==Circumferences and other measurements==
Assessment of somatic (skeletal) protein is typically determined by simple measurements and calculations including mid arm circumference (MAC), mid arm muscle circumference (MAMC), and creatinine height ratio (CHI). [[Creatinine]] height ratio is calculated as 24-hour urine creatinine multiplied by 100 over the expected 24-hour urine creatinine for height. This calculation results in a percentage which can indicate protein depletion.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Validity==
The methods above are each valid and notable in providing a reasonably accurate range of the "true body composition" of the tested individual. However, each method does possess its own individual limitations, indeed precluding to the existence of so many variable methods available for an individual to use. Therefore, the actual method of testing body composition is not as important as the '''consistency of measurement''' in between each test. (See [[internal consistency]] for merits on testing in this manner.) If an individual is to be tested from one period to the next, all factors should ideally remain as similar as possible to reflect the best indicator of true change in composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=2082845|year=2006|author1=Wells|first1=J. C.|title=Measuring body composition|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|volume=91|issue=7|pages=612–617|last2=Fewtrell|first2=M. S.|doi=10.1136/adc.2005.085522|pmid=16790722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of exercises ==
The exercises needed to maintain optimal body composition differ from man to woman to child, but the ideal types of fitness remain the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Normal ranges of body weight and body fat|url = http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/normal-ranges-of-body-weight-and-body-fat|website = human-kinetics|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary exercises needed to improve body composition involve fat burning and cardiovascular exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Examples of Body Composition Exercises|url = http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/examples-body-composition-exercises-12586.html|website = Healthy Living - azcentral.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effort lasted from 1982 to the 1990s, and generally coincides with [[James P. Grant]]'s tenure as executive director of UNICEF (1980–1995). The child survival revolution included various programs and conferences, including the [[World Summit for Children]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=gautam/&gt;

Rather than treating child mortality as a measurement of development, the effort sought to directly reduce child mortality as a way toward development.&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc96/1980s.htm |title=The 1980s: Campaign for child survival |publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the revolution was started by UNICEF, other organizations, including the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], [[UNDP]], the [[World Bank]], and [[WHO]] joined; thus the revolution is sometimes called "a grand alliance for children".&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt; The revolution was analogized with the [[Green Revolution]] by James Grant.&lt;ref name=jim_grant_book/&gt;{{rp|42}}

|}

==Results and reception==
The initial reaction to Grant's announcement of the child survival revolution was overwhelmingly negative due to several reasons, including practical reasons, e.g., the money and infrastructure to support Grant's plans not existing.&lt;ref name=jim_grant_book/&gt;{{rp|24}}

It is estimated that the child vaccination increased worldwide from 20% in 1982(?) to 80% in 1990 because of the child survival revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Black, Children First: The Story of UNICEF, Past and Present (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 33; see also UNICEF, The State of the World’s Children 1986 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1990, [[Donald Henderson|D. A. Henderson]] noted that although "dramatic progress" had been made because of the child survival revolution, the results were still "little-appreciated".&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;

The child survival revolution is estimated to have saved the lives of 25 million children.&lt;ref name=jim_grant_book/&gt;{{rp|59}}

==Focus areas==
The genesis of the Child Survival Revolution can be traced to 1973 when [[James P. Grant]], gave his annual lecture at Johns Hopkins University's School of Public Health. In reviewing research findings of Prof [[Carl E. Taylor]] Grant grasped how the collective package from Taylor's Narangwal research (childhood pneumonia, oral rehydration therapy, neonatal tetanus, family planning) served as a parallel to The Green Revolution, saying "we can now start to talk about a Child Survival Revolution!" &lt;ref&gt; Daniel C. Taylor and Carl E. Taylor (2016), Just and Lasting Change: When Communities Own Their Futures 2nd Edition (New York: Johns Hopkins University Press, p176-177)&lt;/ref&gt;  Grant had earlier been Deputy Director of USAID, and in that role had been an early and strong backer of [[The Green Revolution]], a global effort that dramatically raised global food supply through a package of agricultural innovations (new seed types, fertilizer, irrigation, pesticides, and mechanization). Grant grasped that it was the synergy that came through a package of interventions that would allow children to survive,

For much of the child survival revolution, James Grant and UNICEF adopted a strategy known as [[GOBI-FFF]], a form of selective primary healthcare:&lt;ref&gt;David Bornstein (2007). How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas New York: Oxford University Press pp. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |text=G for growth monitoring to detect undernutrition in small children, O for [[oral rehydration therapy]] [ORT] to treat childhood diarrhea, B to encourage breastfeeding (which had declined precipitously due to working mothers and the marketing of infant formula), and I for immunization against the six basic childhood diseases: tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, and measles. (They added two Fs: food supplements and family planning; and, later, a third: female education.)}}

Of these, "immunization and ORT were seen as the 'twin-engines' of the child survival revolution".&lt;ref name=gautam/&gt;&lt;ref name="jim_grant_book"&gt;{{cite book |title=Jim Grant: UNICEF Visionary |author1=Peter Adamson |author2=Carol Bellamy |author3=Kul Gautam |author4=Richard Jolly |author5=Nyi Nyi |author6=Mary Racelis |author7=Richard Reid |author8=Jon Rohde |year=2001 |url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/index_4402.html |publisher=UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}}

After 1986, when studies by [[Alfred Sommer]] and others were published, [[vitamin A]] administration also became a focus.&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;

==Organizations involved==
Although the revolution was started by UNICEF, other organizations were involved.

* [[Rockefeller Foundation]]&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt;
* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP)
* [[World Bank]]
* [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)
* [[Rotary International]] pledged to raise $120 million.&lt;ref name="henderson"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Child Survival Revolution |author=[[D. A. Henderson]] |year=1990 |journal=Pediatric Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of mass media==
UNICEF took advantage of the growing levels of basic education and access to television and radio to generate support for the child survival revolution through persuasion.&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt;

James Grant also "persuaded many heads of state to get personally involved in their national programmes for children, for example in their immunization by being photographed giving polio drops to a baby". Several figures from film and sports, like [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Liv Ullmann]], and [[Peter Ustinov]] also participated in the [[List of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors|UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador program]].&lt;ref name=jim_grant_book/&gt;{{rp|62}}

'''Dr. Christine Adjobi''' is an [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivorian]] [[politician]] and [[physician]]. A member of the [[Ivorian Popular Front]] (FPI), she is Minister for the Fight Against [[AIDS]] in the Ivorian government of Prime Minister [[Guillaume Soro]].  In 2002-2003, during the [[First Ivorian Civil War|Ivorian Civil War]], Dr. Adjobi was Delegate Minister in Charge of the Fight Against AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afdevinfo.com/htmlreports/peo/peo_989.html "afdevinfo.com"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203223522/http://www.afdevinfo.com/htmlreports/peo/peo_989.html |date=2008-12-03 }}, accessed March 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As such, she headed a campaign in the besieged areas, aimed at refugees of war, native peoples, and the national armed forces [[National Armed Forces of Côte d'Ivoire|(FANCI)]], all of whom, in times of war, run a greater risk of infection with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. She decided to take into psychosocial and therapeutic care HIV positive people. Thus, successively, she joined the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]'s Retro-CI Project at the Center for Diagnosis and Research on AIDS and other opportunistic infections (CEDRES), in the outpatient unit of the University Hospital Center of [[Treichville]].

[[File:Centralincisorlingual06-06-06b.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Lingual (interior) view of an upper incisor.  The cingulum  is highlighted near the base.]]
In [[dentistry]], '''cingulum''' ([[Latin]]: [[girdle]] or [[belt (disambiguation)|belt]]) refers to an anatomical feature of the [[teeth]]. It refers to the portion of the teeth that forms a convex protuberance at the cervical third of the anatomic crown. It represents the lingual or palatal developmental lobe of these teeth.&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Major M. and Stanley J. Nelson. ''Wheeler’s Dental Anatomy, Physiology, and Occlusion.'' 8th edition. 2003.  {{ISBN|0-7216-9382-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[zoology]] and [[palaeontology]], cingulum refers to this feature only in the upper teeth. When this occurs in the lower teeth it is called the [[cingulid]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12701">'''Community practice''' also known as '''macro practice''' is a branch of [[social work]] in the [[United States of America]] that focuses on larger social systems and [[social change]], and is tied to the [[History of social work|historical roots of United States social work]].&lt;ref name="Gibelman"&gt;Gibelman, M. (1999). The search for identity: Defining social work -- past, present, future. ''Social Work, 44''(4), 298-310.&lt;/ref&gt; The field of community practice social work encompasses [[community organizing]], [[social planning]], human service management, [[community development]], [[policy analysis]], policy advocacy, [[evaluation]], [[mediation]], [[Internet activism|electronic advocacy]] and other larger systems interventions.

In the UK the term is often used for community work or [[Health visitor]]s.

Although community practice has overlap with many other applied [[social science]] disciplines, such as [[urban planning]], economic development, [[Public administration|public affairs]], [[rural sociology]] and nonprofit management, its roots go back as far as the 1890s. Community Practice social workers typically have a Masters in Social Work (MSW). There are several [[Master of Social Work|MSW]] programs in the United States that offer Community Practice Concentrations, while many other MSW programs offer specializations in one or several types of community practice, such as social services administration or policy analysis. The professional group of community practitioners in the USA is the [[Association for Community Organization and Social Administration]] (ACOSA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acosa.org/ Association for Community Organization and Social Administration]&lt;/ref&gt; which publishes the leading journal in the field, [[The Journal of Community Practice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haworthpress.com/store/product.asp?sku=J125 Journal of Community Practice]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical Models of Community Practice==
Due to community work's applied nature, [[theory]] is not always considered necessary or even utilized.  Despite this, there are number of theoretical models of community practice that guide the practitioner toward social action.  These theoretical models have evolved from proto-models utilized in the Progressive Era to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weil|first1=Marie|title=Community Practice: Conceptual Models|date=1996|publisher=The Hayworth Press|isbn=0-7890-0024-5|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Synthesized from the work of [[Jane Addams]], Bessie McClanehan, Robert P. Lane, [[Murray Ross]], [[Jack Rothman]], Sam Taylor, and Robert Roberts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weil|first1=Marie|title=Community Practice: Conceptual Models|date=1996|publisher=The Hayworth Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; community workers Marie Weil and Dorothy Gamble have crafted eight theoretical models of community practice as:&lt;ref name="Columbia University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gamble|first1=Dororthy|last2=Weil|first2=Marie|title=Community Practice Skills: Local to Global Perspectives|date=2010|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=26–27|edition=1|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

==Community practice vs. micro practice==
Historically, social work practice has been divided between two different categories: micro practice and macro practice.&lt;ref name="Gibelman" /&gt; Although there is often an overlap in skills between the two areas, micro-practitioners generally focus on working with individuals whereas macro-practitioners generally work on creating change in larger social, political or community systems.&lt;ref name="Israel"&gt;Segal-Engelchin, D., &amp; Kaufman, R. (2008). MICRO- OR MACRO-ORIENTATION? ISRAELI STUDENTS' CAREER INTERESTS IN AN ANTISOCIAL ERA. ''Journal of Social Work Education, 44''(3), 139-157.
&lt;/ref&gt; Macro-social work professions that typically engage in community practice methods include: [[community organizers]], political organizers, [[fundraisers]], program managers, and community educators.

It should also be noted that a third social work practice category is sometimes referenced called 'mezzo practice'. Mezzo practice can be defined by its combination of micro and macro aspects with the focus of interventions being smaller groups or systems. Whereas macro practice often focuses on policy or systematic changes, some researchers and practitioners consider mezzo practice to focus more on change at the community or neighborhood level. Because there is often an overlap between macro and mezzo, some argue mezzo practice to be a sub-category within macro social work. Although it makes up a smaller portion of social work practice, mezzo practice represents an effective way to bridge some of the perceived distances between micro and macro practice methods.&lt;ref name="Israel" /&gt;

==Non-traditional settings==
Traditionally social work practice is located within office or agency settings. However, community practice may also utilize alternative spaces. Emerging from the tradition of [[settlement houses]] of the nineteenth century, the use of existing spaces for services provided by social work and community organizing truly makes the services community based. Nontraditional settings are public spaces, often part of the [[service industry]] where community members gather socially.&lt;ref name="Delgado"&gt;Delgado, M. (1999). Social Work Practice in Non-traditional Urban Settings. Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt; These spaces must be rooted in the cultural heritage of the community.&lt;ref name="Delgado" /&gt; The spaces should also be unique to the community and already heavily utilized for gathering. The primary role of nontraditional spaces is not to provide social work services, though they can be utilized for such services.&lt;ref name="Delgado" /&gt; These spaces are venues for [[outreach]], where social work services use existing gathering spaces to bring services to the community to provide additional resources to more individuals.&lt;ref name="Weatherill"&gt;Weatherill, S.H., Buston, J.A. &amp; Daly, P.C. (2004) Immunization Programs in Non-Traditional Settings. Canadian Journal of Public Health 95(2). pp. 133-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of using existing gathering spaces as a venue for social work is to build on the existing structures of a community. Communities offer numerous characteristics that can be built upon for services and organizing. Furthermore, by organizing around an existing collective identity or shared experience there is a building block for [[group cohesion]] and may increase effectiveness of organizing.&lt;ref name="Kerno"&gt;Kerno, S.J. (2008). Limitations of Communities of Practice. SAGE Publications: Journal of Leadership and Organizational Studies. 15(1). Pp. 69-78.&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively navigating entry into these spaces may take time and diligence on behalf of the organizer. Once in these spaces, it is important to honor and build upon existing [[leadership]].&lt;ref name="Delgado" /&gt;

Nontraditional settings provide cultural access as well as access to multiple generations. These spaces are often seen as a bridge point where multiple generations gather and where cultural values and traditions are learned or passed on. In many instances these spaces are inclusive of non-English speaking members of the community.&lt;ref name="Delgado" /&gt;

==Limitations==
Macro-social workers and those engaging in community practice methods may encounter a number of limitations that will make their work in the community more challenging.

Since macro-community practice is an ongoing and relatively time intensive process, the consequences can be felt throughout the community and by the organizer(s) when projects or efforts are perceived to fail. The community may reject or distrust the individuals or organizations involved with leading the organizing efforts, creating obstacles for future involvement in the community.&lt;ref name="Freund"&gt;Freund, A. (2003). Teaching Successful Community Practice in Social Work. Journal of Community Practice. 10(3). Pp. 75-91&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, community organizers and organizations may burnout due to distress and chronic exposure to clients just as in micro-social work.&lt;ref name="Newell"&gt;Newell, J.M. &amp; MacNeil, G.A. (2010). Professional Burnout, Vicarious Trauma, Secondary Traumatic Stress, and Compassion Fatigue: A Review of Theoretical Terms, Risk Factors and Prevention Methods for Clinicians and Researchers. Lyceum Books Inc.: Best Practices in Mental Health 6(2). Pp. 57-68&lt;/ref&gt; However, macro-social workers may specifically [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]] on community practice due to unsuccessful efforts or unique constraints of the community, shifting them from macro to micro based work.&lt;ref name="Freund" /&gt;

Currently, social workers engaging in community practice work comprise a minority within the larger social work profession. As of 2010, less than 20% of students in Master of Social Work programs in the United States have a macro-practice related concentration. Those concentrations include: community organizing, [[community planning]], [[social policy]] and [[program evaluation]]. This compares to 56% of students who concentrate in direct practice and clinical social work.&lt;ref name="2010 Stats" /&gt; Because macro-social work is pursued less within the field, macro-social workers can feel under-prepared by their education, unrepresented, and not supported.&lt;ref name="Fergusan"&gt;Fergusan, S., Hill, K. &amp; Erickson, C. (2010). Sustaining and Strengthening a Macro Identity: The Association of Macro Practice Social Work. Taylor &amp; Francis Group: Journal of Community Practice. 18(4). Pp.513-527&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[epidemiology]], '''contact tracing''' is the identification and diagnosis of people who may have come into contact with an infected person. For [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, this is generally limited to sexual partners and can fall under the heading of [[partner services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rothenberg|first1=R.|title=The transformation of partner notification|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=15 Oct 2002|volume=35|issue=Suppl 2|pages=S138-45|pmid=12353200|doi=10.1086/342101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Aar|first1=F.|last2=van Weert|first2=Y.|last3=Spijker|first3=R.|last4=Gotz|first4=H.|last5=de Coul|first5=E. O.|title=Partner notification among men who have sex with men and heterosexuals with STI/HIV: different outcomes and challenges|journal=Int J STD AIDS|date=19 Aug 2014|doi=10.1177/0956462414547398|pmid=25141854}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, for highly virulent diseases such as [[Ebola]] and [[tuberculosis]], a thorough contact tracing would require information regarding casual contacts.

== Partner notification ==
{{Main
|Partner notification}}
Some [[AIDS]] activists have argued that contact tracing is counter-productive in that it would lead people to avoid [[HIV testing]] for fear that it would breach their [[right to privacy]].

By tracing the sexual partners of infected individuals, testing them for infection, treating the infected and tracing their contacts in turn, STI clinics could be very effective at suppressing infections in the general population.

In the 1980s, first genital herpes and then AIDS emerged into the public consciousness as sexually transmitted diseases that could not be cured by modern medicine. AIDS in particular has a long asymptomatic period—during which time HIV (the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS) can replicate and the disease can be transmitted to others—followed by a symptomatic period, which leads rapidly to death unless treated. HIV/AIDS entered the United States in about 1969 likely through a single infected immigrant from Haiti. Recognition that AIDS threatened a global pandemic led to public information campaigns and the development of treatments that allow AIDS to be managed by suppressing the replication of HIV for as long as possible. Contact tracing continues to be an important measure, even when diseases are incurable, as it helps to contain infection.

[[File:Inside a SCS Controlled Atmosphere room for apples.jpg|thumb|Controlled atmosphere room]]
[[File:Controlled Atmosphere Building.jpg|thumb|Controlled atmosphere building]]
A '''controlled atmosphere''' is an [[Agriculture|agricultural]] storage method in which the concentrations of [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[nitrogen]], as well as the [[temperature]] and [[humidity]] of a storage room are regulated. Both dry commodities and fresh fruit and vegetables can be stored in controlled atmospheres.

== Dry commodities ==
[[Cereal|Grains]], [[legumes]] and [[oilseed]] are stored in a controlled atmosphere primarily to control insect pests. Most insects cannot survive indefinitely without oxygen or in conditions of raised (&lt;30%) carbon dioxide. Such controlled atmosphere treatments of grains may take several weeks at lower temperatures (&lt;15&amp;nbsp;°C). A typical schedule for complete disinfestation of dry grain (&lt;13% moisture content) with carbon dioxide at approximately 25&amp;nbsp;°C is a concentration above 35%(v/v) carbon dioxide in air for at least 15 days.&lt;ref&gt;Annis, P.C. and Morton, R. 1997.The acute mortality effects of carbon dioxide on various life stages of Sitophilus oryzae. J. Stored Prod.Res. 33. 115-124&lt;/ref&gt; These atmospheres can be created either by:
* adding pure carbon dioxide or nitrogen, or the low oxygen exhausts of hydrocarbon combustion, or
* using the natural effects of respiration (by grain, molds or insects) to reduce oxygen and increase carbon dioxide ([[Hermetic storage]]).&lt;ref&gt;Annis P.C. and Banks H.J. 1993. Is hermetic storage of grains feasible in modern agricultural systems? In “Pest control and sustainable agriculture” Eds S.A. Corey, D.J. Dall and W.M. Milne. CSIRO, Australia. 479-482.&lt;/ref&gt;

The method is most commonly used on [[apples]] and [[pears]], where the combination of altered atmospheric conditions and reduced temperature allow prolonged storage with only a slow loss of quality.&lt;ref&gt;http://bestapples.com/washington-orchards/packing-process/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/11/26/668256349/thanks-to-science-you-can-eat-an-apple-every-day&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-term storage of vegetables and fruit involves inhibiting the ripening and ageing processes, thus retaining flavor and quality. Ripening is delayed by reducing the level of oxygen and increasing that of carbon dioxide in the cool cell so that the respiration is reduced. Under controlled atmosphere conditions the quality and the freshness of fruit and vegetables are retained, and many products can be stored for 2 to 4 times longer than usual.

==History==
Franklin Kidd and Cyril West of [[Cambridge University]] did the basic research into fruit respiration and ripening leading to the first commercial facility in 1929. By 1960, there was capacity for 4 million bushels of apples in the US and by the 1980s, capacity exceeded 100 million bushels.&lt;ref name="Sigler"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sigler|first1=Derreck|title=CA storage has become staple of the fruit industry|url=http://fruitgrowersnews.com/article/ca-storage-has-become-staple-of-the-fruit-industry/|accessdate=25 July 2017|work=Fruit Growers News|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Damdama'''a reservoir in [[Sohna]], [[ district]] in the [[Indian state]] of [[Haryana]].&lt;ref name=dum2&gt;Rajiv Tiwari, [https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=FBRYCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT117&amp;dq=damdama+lake&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj15LH7rLvXAhXLPI8KHbHzCK4Q6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=damdama%20lake&amp;f=false "Delhi A Travel Guide"], {{ISBN|9798128819703}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the biggest lakes in Haryana and with an area of 3,000 [[acres]] (12.14&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Damdama Lake was formed when a stone and earthen dam constructed by the British was commissioned for rain water harvesting in 1947. The lake, held by an embankment, is fed mainly by monsoon rain pouring into a trough at the base of the [[Aravali hills]]. The Lake greets visitors with a water level down to {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}}. During monsoon the water level reaches up to {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} - {{convert|70|ft|m|abbr=on}}.

==Geology and climate==
As it is located in a hilly region, the [[topography]] of this area is not even. Damdama Lake is spread in the shape of an amoeba and has many branches. Dream Island adventure resort being right in the middle of the lake has a moderate climate and is good for a visit any time of the year. Best time to visit the lake is from October to March, late summers and monsoons. The climate is typically hot during summer, temperature reaching up to 45–47&amp;nbsp;°C.

==Ecology==
Damdama lake is a natural home for birds, &amp; more than 190 species of birds, [[Bird migration|migratory]] as well as local, visit here during summer, monsoon and winter season, i.e. all throughout the year a variety of birds from different places flock to Dream Island. Some of the major birds seen here are water fowl, cranes, cormorants, terns, egrets, kingfishers etc. While driving to Damdama Lake, you can also catch a glimpse of peacocks and blue bulls.

==Leisure==
Surrounded by the Aravali Mountains, it is one of the popular picnic spot to spend the weekend away from the city in a quiet and scenic atmosphere. In the serene location, one can enjoy boating in row boats, paddle boats and motor boats. Damdama is known for its splendid adventure sports facilities such as [[para sailing]], [[kayaking]], cycling, [[angling]], rock climbing, valley crossing. One can also go for nature walks in the nearby Aravali hills.

==Attractions nearby==

===Hot springs===
The [[Sulfur]] [[hot spring]] of [[Sohna#Sohna_Sulphur_Hot_Spring|Sohna Sulphur Hot Spring]] at [[Sohna]] is a religious and tourist attraction with medicinal value for skin diseases.&lt;ref name=trib200&gt;http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000218/haryana.htm#2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HT1&gt;[http://haryanatourism.gov.in/showpage.aspx?contentid=5617&amp;serviceid=39 Haryana Tourism - Barbet Resort]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a legend, one of the [[pandav]], [[Arjuna|Arjun]], dug this well when he was thirsty. Sohna is very close to Dream Island Resort at Damdama Lake.

===Ancient Shiva temple===
An ancient Shiva temple is located in Sohna and was built by the Raja of Bharatpur/Gwalior. Every year on the occasion of Shiv Chaudas &amp; Shiv Ratri, the residents of Sohna offer their special prayers to Lord Shiva &amp; Maa Bhagwati for the new born babies and newly married couples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1479">'''Familial multiple intestinal atresia''' is an inherited disorder where [[Intestinal atresia|atresia]] occurs at multiple locations throughout the small and large intestines. It presents at birth and the prognosis is very poor with almost all those diagnosed with this condition dying with one month. It may be associated with combined [[immunodeficiency]]. 
==Clinical==

In this disorder lesions can occur anywhere from the stomach to the anus. The clinical presentation depends on the location of the lesions(s).
==Genetics==

The underlying lesion in this condition appears to be a mutation in the [[TTC7A]] gene.&lt;ref name=Samuels2013&gt;Samuels ME, Majewski J, Alirezaie N, Fernandez I, Casals F, Patey N, Decaluwe H, Gosselin I, Haddad E, Hodgkinson A, Idaghdour Y, Marchand V, Michaud JL, Rodrigue, M-A, Desjardins S, Dubois S, Le Deist F, Awadalla P, Raymond V, Maranda B Exome sequencing identifies mutations in the gene TTC7A in French-Canadian cases with hereditary multiple intestinal atresia.

[[File:Femaleurinal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A row of female urinals, separated by privacy screens]]

A '''female urinal''' is designed for the anatomy of women and intended to be used by women and girls. Different models enable [[urination]] in standing, [[semi-squatting]], or [[squatting position|squatting]] postures, always without direct bodily contact with the [[urinal]]. 

[[Unisex]] urinals are distributed by various companies and can be used by females and males alike. Female urinals and unisex urinals are much less common than male urinals. Urinals are more abundant in men's and boys' [[public toilets]] than in the [[Toilet (room)|facilities in private homes]].

==Background==
[[File:Female urinal at school in India.jpg|thumb|Squatting urinals for female students at Government Middle School in [[Perumathur|Peramathur]], [[Cuddalore district|Cuddalore District]], Tamil Nadu, India. The urinals on the right side have privacy screens and are used by older girls.]]

===Construction and use===
[[File:Pee standing.jpg|thumb|Body position taken by women for [[urination]] into many female urinals: floating [[Squatting_position#Partial_squat|half squat or ″skier position″]].]]
In the 1970s, Alexander Kira, professor of architecture and [[sanitary engineering]] at [[Cornell University]], conducted studies on [[urination]] behaviour of both genders. He pursued the goal of developing sanitary [[Plumbing fixture|fixtures]] that are adapted to the human body and its needs, breaking with conventional design specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://placesjournal.org/article/designed-in-safety/ |title= Designed-In Safety: The radical reformers who sought to redesign the American bathroom |last= Penner |first= Barbara |date= October 2013 |website= Places Journal |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.treehugger.com/bathroom-design/the-history-of-the-bathroom-part-5-alexander-kira-and-designing-for-people-not-plumbing.html |title= The History of the Bathroom Part 5: Alexander Kira and Designing For People, Not Plumbing |last= Alter |first= Lloyd |date= 15 July 2011 |website= Treehugger |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Instructions manual - how to use the waterless urinal (5879835749).jpg|thumb|Advice for the use of a female urinal in a public restroom (in [[Frankfurt]], Germany)]]
On a conventional [[Flush toilet|toilet bowl]], the "correct" use is determined by the shape of the sanitary fixture. Amongst other things, Kira investigated the body positions that males and females prefer to use when no external guidelines are given, for example while urinating in nature. He examined the [[trajectories]] of the urine stream and its controllability, as well as comfort and health aspects of different body positions. While males usually urinate in a standing posture and direct the stream forward by hand, females prefer to take a squatting position. The stream is controlled by the posture of the entire body and is directed vertically downwards to slightly oblique backwards. This position is generally the most comfortable for females and is associated with the lowest spray dispersion.&lt;ref name="Moellring"&gt;Möllring, B. (2003): ''Toiletten und Urinale für Frauen und Männer: die Gestaltung von Sanitärobjekten und ihre Verwendung in öffentlichen und privaten Bereichen.'' Dissertation at the Universität der Künste Berlin, Faculty of Design [https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-udk/files/8/moellring_bettina.pdf (PDF-document)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kira, A. K.

(Eds.)(2009):'' Ladies and gents: Public toilets and gender.'' Temple University Press, {{ISBN|159213940X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The female urinal models offered today are conceptually similar to each other and follow the shape and design of male urinals but are more closely tailored to the [[female anatomy]]. One difference is that the female stands with her back toward the urinal and adopts a [[Partial squat|half-squatting position]], which is also sometimes called the "skier's posture" or "hovering stance". This is based on the posture that females generally adopt in conventional [[public toilets]] if they are dirty or physical contact is not desired.&lt;ref name="Moellring"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gershenson"/&gt;

In countries where [[squat toilets]] are the norm, female urinals can also be found as a ceramic pan at floor level. This kind of urinal would be used in a full squat position to avoid splashing back of urine. In the past, models that were used in a full squat (similar to [[Asia]]n squat-style toilets) have been developed to the prototype stage&lt;ref&gt;Demiriz, M. (2010). Female urinals.

At present, all female urinals available on the western market are wall-mounted and used in a half-squat, "skiing" position.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thecut.com/2017/08/german-engineers-working-on-the-female-urinal.html German Engineers Want to Bring Gender Equality to Public Toilets.] Katie Van Syckle, ''The Cut'', 12 August 2017. Retrieved 10 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages compared to toilets for urination===
Urinals for female users could potentially have some of the same advantages as [[Urinal|urinals]] for male users compared to [[toilets]] (with regards to urination):&lt;ref name="Kyriakou" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moellring" /&gt;

* lower costs,
* simpler maintenance,
* smaller space requirements (several urinals may be installed on the floor space of a single toilet cubicle),
* reduced water consumption for flushing compared to [[Flush toilet|flush toilets]] ([[Urinal#Waterless urinals|waterless urinals]] can even function without any flushing water),
* more hygienic, contact-free urination process (and no risk of soiling with [[Human feces|feces]] from previous users).
* faster use, and
* easier [[recycling]] of [[Nutrient|nutrients]] as [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecosanres.org/pdf_files/ESR_Publications_2004/ESR2web.pdf|title=Guidelines on the Use of Urine and Faeces in Crop Production.  35p.|last=Jönsson et al.|first=|date=2004|website=Ecological Sanitation Research of the Stockholm Environment Institute|archive-url=http://www.ecosanres.org/pdf_files/ESR_Publications_2004/ESR2web.pdf|archive-date=2004|dead-url=|access-date=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Purpose public toilet.jpg|thumb|left|Public toilets are mainly used for the purpose of urination&lt;ref name="Kyriakou"&gt;Kyriakou, D., &amp; Jackson, J. (2011): ''We Know Squat About Female Urinals.'' Plumbing Connection, (Autumn 2011), 54 ([http://www.map-testing.com/assets/files/female%20urinals.pdf PDF-document])&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Approximately 90% of public toilet use is exclusively for urination (as compared to [[defecation]]).&lt;ref name="Kyriakou" /&gt; Due to the increased number of units in the same amount of floor space, there is a faster process with shorter queue in front of public toilets. By installing urinals, up to 30% more people can use the toilet facilities at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://phys.org/news/2017-07-lengths-restroom.html |title= Researchers study lengths of restroom queues |author= Ghent University |date= 17 July 2017 |website= Phys,org |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female urinals could be possibly suitable for use in public toilets which are highly frequented during peak hours and which are likely to attract large numbers of visitors, especially places like schools, universities, discotheques, shopping centers, and bus stations. In addition, mobile female urinals have been developed for use at open-air events, festivals, as well as free-standing units for public spaces.&lt;ref name="dezeen"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.dezeen.com/2011/07/15/pollee-by-uiwe/ |title= Pollee by UiWE |last= Etherington |first= Rose |date= 15 July 2011 |website= dezeen |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in Australia in 2011 showed that more than half of the women interviewed would use a urinal if it were available.&lt;ref name="Kyriakou"/&gt; In the meantime, demand is increasingly being made for "urination equality" ([[potty parity]]) &amp;nbsp;– equal rights for men and women. A [[grassroots]] urination equality campaign in the [[Netherlands]] caused a sensation in 2017, with women using urinals in men's toilets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/weinig-animo-onder-vrouwen-voor-actie-zeikwijf-toch-succes~af3acf49/ |title= Weinig animo onder vrouwen voor Actie Zeikwijf, toch succes |last= Baars |first= Renske |date= 23 September 2017 |website= AD |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Amerikanisches Frauenpissoir der Firma J.L. Mott Iron Works.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Lady urinal of the company'' J. L. Mott Iron Works'', 1897]]

Recent developments in creating urinals for females and for use by both sexes are not a revolution in [[sanitation]], as some manufacturers suggest. Rather, it is the renaissance of a concept whose roots lie in the 19th century. At that time, during the early days of [[public toilets|public toilet]] development, female urinals were already being installed and urinals were not thought of as being exclusively for males. For example, the 1897 German ''Handbuch der Architektur'' (handbook of architecture) shows "women's urinals with automatic rinsing", although at that time the advantages were also seen in the less costly installation and water savings:&lt;ref name="Moellring"/&gt; 

{{quote|text=Pissoirs for the female sex have even been successfully used in recent years. These consist of so-called "urinettes" or porcelain sitting basins with automatic flushing and are set up especially in the waiting halls of railway stations, in shops where many girls are employed, in theatres where there is a large choir or ballet.&amp;nbsp;... Such "urinettes" have the great fortune of being able to be placed where a 2-inch drainpipe is present, while the rinsing lavatories usually used by women for urination require a 4-inch waste pipe.&lt;ref name="hda1897"&gt;''Handbuch der Architektur'', Ergänzungsheft zum 3. Teil, "Entwässerungsanlagen amerikanischer Gebäude", Stuttgart : Bergsträsser, 1897. – Getr. Zählung&lt;/ref&gt;|author=''Handbuch der Architektur'': "Entwässerungsanlagen amerikanischer Gebäude", 1897}}

At that time, the female urinal was unable to establish itself in Germany, as they were installed only occasionally. In 1902, on the initiative of the City Building Office, a decision was taken in [[Munich]] to install women's urinals throughout the city in public convenience stores.&lt;ref name="Moellring"/&gt; A letter to the Kirchmair Board of Directors, for example, explains the plenary decision of the Baumagistrat on 13 February 1902:

[[File:Entwurf Damenurinal 1906.jpg|thumb|Sketch of the [[Munich]] building city council of a women's urinal, planned for a comprehensive introduction to the public toilets of the city, 1906]]

[[File:Deutsche Frauenpissoire.jpg|thumb||German women's urinals (by [[Villeroy and Boch]]), 1908]]

{{quote|text=It was suggested by several parties that the various classes of toilets should be abolished, that the establishment should be uniform and that a fee of 5 Pfennig should be charged for all toilets, with the exception of the free toilets, (this corresponds to the II. class), and that free toilets should be set up in all existing sanitary facilities. The construction of women's urinals, such as those found in other cities, was also mentioned.&lt;ref name="Moellring"/&gt;|author=Munich City Archive 1902}}

This idea was pursued further, so that the documents of January 13, 1906 contained plans for concrete implementation:

{{quote|text=The basins should be made of cast iron with enamel coating. A seat board is not to be provided. On the other hand, it might be advisable to mount brass rods above the basin, which extend from one wall to another and are fixed there. Older and weaker people could gain support at this pole. An intermittent rinse may be required for both pools every 10 minutes.&amp;nbsp;... For the first attempts to set up "women's urinals", it may be advisable to choose the locations of such urinals near playgrounds so that nannies or other female supervisors can use the same ones.&lt;ref name="Moellring"/&gt;|author=Munich City Archive 1906}}

[[File:Female urinals.jpg|thumb|left|Women's urinals of the ''Manstone company''  from the 1940s]]

In the architectural guide "München und seine Bauten" (Munich and its buildings) from 1912, the women's urinals in three public toilets (Lerchenfeldstraße, Ottostraße and Max-Weber-Platz) were mentioned in the chapter on "Nursing homes". In contrast to the actual toilets, these were intended as "freehold toilets", i.e. for free use. They enjoyed great popularity and were highly frequented. In the course of the 1910s, there was no further expansion, probably because the free use did not generate profits to the city's treasury funds. Finally, the "Freiaborte" (free public lavatories) for women were converted into institutions with costs. A later proposal by the first female city councillor of Munich in 1922 for the reintroduction of those free urinals were already fended off in the first place by the purely male directorate of the "Bade- und Bedürfnisanstalten" establishments.&lt;ref name="Moellring"/&gt;

The development at the turn of the century was not followed up in Germany and these first approaches were increasingly forgotten.&lt;ref name="Moellring"/&gt;

===Developments since the 1970s===

Until the 1970s, few female urinals were available in the US from different manufacturers, such as the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnKiP3SoNLQ Sanistand] of [[American Standard Companies]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, various concepts and prototypes were developed, although most of them were not developed beyond the design stage. Female urinals have only been used again since the turn of the millennium and are marketed commercially, primarily in Europe.&lt;ref name="Moellring"/&gt;

From 1950 to 1974, the [[American Standard Companies|American Standard]] company offered the mass-produced "Ladies' Home Urinal".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It did not provide significant advantages over conventional toilets, because it used just as much floor space and water for flushing. Its main selling point was that it was specifically designed for women to use without touching.

Several other designs have been tried since then, but they required the user either to hover awkwardly or to bring her genitals into close contact with the fixture. Most have not caught on. Current clothes fashions, such as [[panty hose]] and [[slacks]], inhibit females from using them because they do not want their garments to touch the urinal or the floor. Often, females have little experience with urinals and do not know whether to approach them forward or backward.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Standard trough models intended for use with a specialized [[female urination device|funnel]] have been introduced with some success, at outdoor festivals such as [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], to reduce dwell times and to alleviate long queues. In 2011, a portable female urinal—the [[Pollee]]—was introduced at the [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark and was received enthusiastically by female festival visitors.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Current situation==
[[File:Advertisement for waterless urinals in front of ladies entrance (5880397908).jpg|thumb|Advertisement for women's urinals in front of a public toilet in Frankfurt/Main, Germany]]
Urinals are being developed that can be used by all sexes (males, females and [[Third gender|third sex]]es). While urinals for men and boys can be found almost everywhere in public toilets, unisex and female urinals are still niche products.&lt;ref name="Gershenson"/&gt; Many people feel that this should be left alone because of obvious biological differences that make the use of urinals far more convenient for the male population than they would be for the female population.  According to Mete Demiriz, professor of sanitary technology at the ''Westphalian University of Applied Sciences'' in [[Gelsenkirchen]], economic considerations and social conventions also prevent the wider installation of female urinals:&lt;ref name="jetzt"/&gt; 

{{quote|text=It is not profitable for the manufacturers, as they would sell less normal toilets with every female urinal. The selection and production of public toilets is also a male domain. If the women don't get involved, it won't work. Once upon a time there was a large German company in my laboratory that wanted to produce my development. There were also secretaries who tried them out. Then the wife of the CEO said, "What nonsense, I always sit on it at home." That's when it died again. But of course it's not meant for home!|author=Mete Demiriz&lt;ref name="jetzt"/&gt;}}

A study in 1999 surveyed 600 women to discover how interested they were in having female urinals which would be used in a standing position. The majority of respondents indicated a desire to have such facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=THKq9mT-7toC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=0615240240&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxj4S168XcAhXR62EKHTskCGIQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=female%20urinal&amp;f=false|title=Bathrooms Make Me Nervous: A Guidebook for Women with Urination Anxiety|author=Carol Olmert|first=|publisher=CJOB Publications|year=2008|isbn=0615240240|location=|page=146|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urinals for women/girls or both sexes===
==== Female and unisex urinals in public toilets====
[[File:Female Urinal.jpg|thumb|upright|Women's urinal "Lady P" at the [[Dortmund airport]], Germany]]
In the 1990s, a number of prototypes were developed for female urinals, of which only three were finally ready for the market and are now used: the "Lady P" by ''Sphinx Sanitair'',&lt;ref name="sonasbathrooms"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.sonasbathrooms.com/en/blog/check-out-our-lady-p-urinals-exclusively-at-lillies-bordello/ |title= Check out our Lady P urinals exclusively at Lillies Bordello |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 30 March 2017 |website= Sonas Bathrooms |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.msmagazine.com/aug99/what.asp |title= TheLadyP |last= Edut |first= Ophira |date= August 1999 |website= Ms. |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the "Lady Loo" by ''GBH''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gbhgroup.com.my/bathroom.html |title= Lady Loo |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 2014 |website= gbhgroup |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gbhgroup.com.my/images/product/bathroom/latest-products/lady-loo/lady-loo.pdf |title= Lady Loo 2 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= gbhgroup |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Girly" by ''Ceramica Catalano''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.stylepark.com/de/catalano/girly-urinal |title= Girly Urinal |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=  |website= Stylepark |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, which has won several design awards. Since the 2000s, female urinals have been introduced in a few European public toilets.&lt;ref name="Moellring"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jetzt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sonasbathrooms"/&gt;

In the course of the development towards [[unisex toilet]]s, designers and developers are increasingly faced with the challenge of creating gender-appropriate solutions. Models have now been developed that can be used comfortably by females and males alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.yankodesign.com/2010/09/24/men-women-%E2%80%93-we-p-together-in-the-same-bucket/ |title= Men &amp; Women – We Pee Together |last= Seth |first= Radhika |date= 24 September 2010 |website= Yanko Design |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.uridan.com/en/designs/captain/ |title= Captain |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= Uridan |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.mopo.de/hamburg/-gender-wahnsinn---erste-unisex-toiletten-fuer-die-schanze-29438430 |title= „Gender-Wahnsinn“?

In the future, Berlin will have unisex toilets and unisex urinals, to be used by both sexes.&lt;ref name="bento"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bento.de/today/toilettenkonzept-fuer-berlin-oeffentliche-toiletten-bekommen-urinale-auch-fuer-frauen-1576079/ |title= Toilettenkonzept für Berlin: Öffentliche Toiletten bekommen Urinale auch für Frauen |last= Wadhawan |first= Julia |date= 7 August 2017 |website= bento |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://energy.ch/entertainment/article/in-berlin-gibt-es-bald-pissoirs-fuer-frauen |title= Revolution im Stehen: Berlin führt Pissoirs für Frauen ein  |last= Wirch |first= Mirko |date= 9 August 2017 |website= Energy |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the expiration of the operation contract for public toilets with Wall GmbH in Berlin, a new toilet concept for public spaces in Berlin is being developed. Urinals that can be used by both sexes are an essential part of the future unisex toilet facilities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://tegernseerstimme.de/pinkeln-frauen-in-wiessee-bald-im-stehen/847530.html |title= Im Stehen auf Matteo Thuns Designerstück pinkeln |last= |first= |date= |website= Tegernseer Stimme |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wuv.de/marketing/vertrag_mit_wall_laeuft_aus_neues_toilettenkonzept_fuer_berlin |title= Vertrag mit Wall läuft aus: Neues Toilettenkonzept für Berlin |last= Weber |first= Markus |date= 8 August 2017 |website= V&amp;W |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=There are a number of public restrooms in the city that offer exclusively men's urinals and completely exclude women and their toilet needs. According to the Senate, this is unacceptable in terms of equality. Because you don't want a crowd of pissing men in the city, the facilities are cleverly not closed down, but converted into unisex toilets that can be used by all genders[...] Berlin has now taken up the problem heroically and is planning urinals for women and men in all public toilets. This is part of the toilet concept for Berlin, which was presented last week by the Senate Department for Environment, Transport and Climate Protection, together with the company Zebralog and the Technical University of Berlin. The advantage of the unisex urinal is that it catches women's and men's urine stream earlier and thus avoids the otherwise unavoidable splashing and is thus simply more hygienic. Therefore, the urinal can be conveniently used by both sexes.

====Mobile unisex urinals for outdoor use====
{{Main article|Pollee}}
[[File:Pollee female urinal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Pollee'' - a mobile female urinal for outdoor use]]
The world's first mobile urinal for women was presented at the [[Roskilde Festival]] 2011 under the name of [[Pollee]] and proved to be a great success. The Pollee-Urinal is primarily intended for open-air events, especially [[music festival]]s and is distributed as a women's urinal, but can also be used as a unisex urinal in principle.&lt;ref name="dezeen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://vimeo.com/27540864 |title= Pollee - the female urinal at Roskilde Festival|author= Urgent Agency |date= 2012 |website= Vimeo |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems in implementation===

At present, two different arrangements are currently being implemented in practice: in a row arrangement (usually with a screen as a separating element), comparable to male urinals, and in cabins or booths, as in classic toilets. The main advantage compared to the classic toilet, the compact space requirements, is lost. With a row arrangement, the number of facilities increases noticeably and thus a faster use becomes possible. However, this is not the case with the booth arrangement, in which a classic toilet bowl is simply replaced by a urinal. The booth solution is often put forward with the argument that female use of open urinals is socially unacceptable and associated with embarrassment. However, urinating in the company of others can be a problem for some males as well.  There is always the possibility to switch to a classical toilet stall if that the use of urinals is associated with shame (''e.g.'', in the case of [[paruresis]]).&lt;ref name="Moellring"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jetzt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deutschlandfunk"/&gt;

[[File:Urinal_sketch.svg|thumb|Unisex-Urinals (2) which could be used by both men and women, combine features of a female (1) and male (3) only urinal]]
This problem arises all the more in the context of the increasing development towards unisex toilets for males and females. A pooling of toilets raises the question of how urinals should be arranged for both sexes in the room. While toilets are usually housed in booths with lockable doors, urinals are usually installed freely in a row in gender-separated toilets. This construction method requires less space and thus allows more people to urinate at the same time while promoting better hygiene and economics, which is currently one of the main advantages of male urinals. One possibility would be to continue offering urinals in rows. These could, whether separated into male and female urinals or as unisex urinals, be separated by so-called pubic walls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kemmlit-Urinal-Partition-Classic-T%C3%9CV-Certified/dp/B0117B1MCU Pubic Wall advertised]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is questionable whether the lower level of privacy compared to conventional toilets would be accepted. Due to socio-cultural conventions, the open use of urinals by men/boys in front of women/girls would likely create awkwardness for both genders and would currently seem strange and contrary to common morals and etiquette for many users. There are even more practical issues for females, such as women/girls needing toilet paper, having to lower their pants, and sometimes tending to their [[Menstruation#Menstrual management|menstrual hygiene]] needs while going to the toilet for urination.{{citation needed|date = March 2018}}

An alternative would be to accommodate urinals for both sexes in cabins or to continue offering urinals for males only.&lt;ref name="jetzt"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.jetzt.de/gender/berliner-senat-will-urinale-fuer-frauen-einfuehren |title= Der Name 'Frauenpissoir' kann abschrecken |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 9 August 2017 |website= jetzt |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this would at least limit the above-mentioned advantages of the urinals for females. Accordingly, the German lawyer and author Marcus Werner sees a significant disadvantage in unisex toilets if these would lead to the elimination of urinals in classic row order:&lt;ref name="Wirtschaftswoche" /&gt;

{{quote|text=Therefore, it would be very, very sad if the unisex toilet trend would end up causing men to have to queue up because every urinal would be housed in a cabin, which would dramatically reduce the number of facilities. That would be a total waste of time, calculated in terms of gender. Men lose time without women winning. There can be unisex urinals here. But please use the ergonomically wall-mounted urinals in a row. That would take the pressure off everyone.&lt;ref name="Wirtschaftswoche"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wiwo.de/politik/deutschland/werner-knallhart-berlins-pissoire-fuer-frauen-ein-gutes-geschaefts-modell/20162304.html |title= Berlins Pissoire für Frauen: ein gutes 'Geschäfts-Modell'? |last= Werner |first= Marcus |date= 9 August 2017 |website= WirtschaftsWoche |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;|author=Marcus Werner}}

Urinals arranged in cabins have not been popular, since the advantages compared to conventional toilets were not obvious, given the unchanged space requirement.&lt;ref name="Deutschlandfunk"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/tolle-idee-was-wurde-daraus-urinal-fuer-frauen.676.de.html?dram:article_id=380096 |title= Urinal für Frauen |last= Stang |first= Michael von |date= 28 February 2017 |website= Deutschlandfunk |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After 13 years, the four ladies' urinals in the [[Salzburg]] Congress Center were removed in August 2015 due to a lack of interest. They have been replaced by conventional toilets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://salzburg.orf.at/news/stories/2726034/ |title= Kongresshaus: Damen-Urinale werden entfernt |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 12 August 2015 |website= Orf.at |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard Weiss, the architect who is planning this restroom, this would create the greatest possible freedom of choice for all genders:

'''Frank James Jobe''' (July 16, 1925&amp;nbsp;– March 6, 2014) was an American [[Orthopedic surgery|orthopedic surgeon]] and co-founder of the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic. Jobe pioneered both elbow ligament replacement and major reconstructive shoulder surgery for [[baseball]] players.

In 1974, Jobe performed the first "[[Tommy John surgery]]" on then-[[Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitcher [[Tommy John]]. The procedure has become so prevalent an estimated one-third of all major league pitchers have undergone it.&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Frank Jobe brought pitchers new life with Tommy John surgery|quote=According to an ESPN study last season of 124 active pitchers, one-third had undergone the procedure|url=http://www.denverpost.com/rockies/ci_25300356/dr-frank-jobe-brought-pitchers-new-life-tommy|publisher=The Denver Post|author=Renck, Troy E|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobe also performed the first major reconstructive shoulder surgery on a big league player in 1990, which allowed Dodger star [[Orel Hershiser]] to continue his career. Jobe served as a special adviser to the team until his death.

==Early life==
Frank Jobe was born in 1925 in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. After graduating from Collegedale Academy in [[Collegedale, Tennessee]] in 1943, he enlisted in the [[United States Army]]&lt;ref name=nytimes_obit/&gt; and reported to [[Camp Barkeley]] for training.&lt;ref name=dougmiller/&gt;  Serving in World War II as a medical [[staff sergeant]] in the Army's [[101st Airborne Division]], he landed by glider at [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perry |first=Dayn |url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/24471145/dodgers-announce-passing-of-dr-frank-jobe-at-age-88 |title=Jobe obit |publisher=Cbssports.com |date=June 11, 2008 |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later was briefly captured during the [[Siege of Bastogne]] in the [[Battle of the Bulge]].&lt;ref name=nytimes_obit/&gt; Successfully escaping, he went on to earn the [[Bronze Star Medal]], [[Combat Medical Badge]], and [[Glider Badge]] with one star.&lt;ref name=Gurnick&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurnick|first=Ken|title=Famed surgeon Jobe dies at 88|date=March 6, 2014|publisher=MLB.com|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/mlb/famed-surgeon-jobe-dies-at-88?ymd=20140306&amp;content_id=68846290&amp;vkey=news_mlb|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early years===
After the war, Jobe enrolled in [[Southern Missionary College]] with help from the [[G.I. Bill]]. He completed his bachelor's degree at [[La Sierra University]] and went on to medical school at [[Loma Linda University]], receiving his MD in 1956.&lt;ref name=dougmiller&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130722&amp;content_id=54371126&amp;v |title=Frank Jobe's Hall of Fame Life |publisher=Major League Baseball |date=July 22, 2013 |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for three years as a [[general practitioner]] before completing a [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in [[orthopedic surgery]] at the [[Los Angeles County Hospital]].&lt;ref name=nytimes_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dilbeck&gt;{{cite web|last=Dilbeck|first=Steve|title=Miracle Worker; Dr. Jobe Gives Players Back Their Arms|date=September 24, 1999|publisher=Daily News|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MIRACLE+WORKER%3B+DR.+JOBE+GIVES+PLAYERS+BACK+THEIR+ARMS.-a083624171|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 Jobe began to consult with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. He teamed with Dr. [[Robert Kerlan]] to specialize in the developing field of sports medicine. The duo co-founded the Southwestern Orthopaedic Medical Group in 1965, later renamed the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic.&lt;ref name=nytimes_obit/&gt;  Jobe officially joined the Dodgers' medical staff in 1968.&lt;ref name=nytimes_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=herald/&gt;

Along with the Dodgers, the clinic supervised medical treatment for the [[California Angels]] of [[Major League Baseball]], the [[History of the Los Angeles Rams|Los Angeles Rams]] of the [[National Football League]], and the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]]. They eventually worked for the [[Los Angeles Kings]] and the [[Anaheim Ducks]] of the [[National Hockey League]], as well as a large number of other professional and amateur athletes from across the country.&lt;ref name="drjobehof.org/biography"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|publisher=drjobehof.org|url=http://drjobehof.org/#/dr-jobe-biography/|accessdate=September 10, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030221735/http://drjobehof.org/#/dr-jobe-biography/|archivedate=October 30, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tommy John surgery===
[[File:Tommy John 2008 bronx.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Tommy John, in 2008]]
On September 25, 1974, Jobe made sports medicine history when he performed the first reconstruction of the [[Ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint|ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow]] (UCL) using a revolutionary procedure he had devised.

What has since become commonly known as [[Tommy John surgery]] rescued the career of Los Angeles Dodger pitcher [[Tommy John]], a 12-year veteran who went on to pitch an astonishing 14 more seasons after a year off recovering.&lt;ref name=nytimes_obit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/07/sports/baseball/dr-frank-jobe-who-pioneered-tommy-john-surgery-dies-at-88.html?hpw&amp;rref=sports|title=Frank Jobe, Surgeon Who Saved Pitchers’ Careers, Dies at 88|first=Richard|last=Goldstein|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 6, 2014|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A one-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] who had never had more than 16 wins in a season, John went on to three 20-win seasons, three more All-Star appearances, and two second place [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young]] votes post-surgery.

Jobe was unsure the procedure's benefits would last, so he waited two years before performing the second UCL reconstruction. After success with several more baseball players and a [[javelin]] thrower, Jobe became confident in its lasting benefits. The findings of UCL reconstruction were published in the ''[[Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery]]'' in 1986.&lt;ref name=dougmiller/&gt;

In the four decades since its inception elbow ligament replacement has become common practice for pitchers and players at all levels of baseball,&lt;ref name=nytimes_obit/&gt; with an estimated one-third of all Major League pitchers in 2014 having undergone it.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt; What Jobe had estimated as a 1 in 100 prospect of a complete recovery for John had risen to 85–92 percent by 2009.&lt;ref name=Rosenhek&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenhek|first=Eric|title=The gory details of Tommy John surgery|date=July 1, 2009|publisher=The Good Point|url=http://thegoodpoint.com/2009/07/tommy-john-surgery-procedure/|accessdate=July 3, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120215914/http://thegoodpoint.com/2009/07/tommy-john-surgery-procedure/|archivedate=November 20, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For baseball players, full [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] takes about one year for pitchers and about six months for position players. Players typically begin throwing about 16 weeks after surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2003-07-29-tommy-john-rehab-schedule_x.htm|work=USA Today|first1=Mike|last1=Dodd|title=A year of rehab for Tommy John patients|date=July 29, 2003|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his surgery, John had won 124 games. He won 164 after surgery, retiring in 1989 at age 46.&lt;ref name=nytimes_obit/&gt; Other pitchers to extend their careers after Tommy John surgery include [[Stephen Strasburg]], [[David Wells]], [[A. J. Burnett]], [[Francisco Liriano]], [[Chris Carpenter]], [[Tim Hudson]], [[John Smoltz]], [[Joe Nathan]], [[Brian Wilson (baseball)|Brian Wilson]], [[Billy Wagner]], and [[Matt Harvey]]. [[Sandy Koufax]], who suffered a similar injury to John's in 1966, once asked Jobe "why didn’t you do that on me?"&lt;ref name=nytimes_obit/&gt;

The initial Tommy John surgery, John's return to pitching success, and the relationship between the two men was the subject of a 2013 ESPN ''[[30 for 30#30 for 30 Shorts|30 for 30 Shorts]]'' documentary.&lt;ref name=30for30&gt;{{cite web|title=30 for 30 Shorts: Tommy and Frank|url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9499638/the-unlikely-legacy-dr-frank-jobe-pitcher-tommy-john-profiled-latest-30-30-documentary-series|publisher=Grantland|accessdate=August 17, 2013|author=Grantland staff|date=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shoulder reconstruction surgery===
In 1990, Jobe performed major reconstructive surgery on the shoulder of Dodgers pitcher [[Orel Hershiser]]'s throwing arm, the first time this procedure was used on a major league player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-05-30/sports/9103010172_1_miracle-radical-shoulder-surgery-orel-hershiser|title=Hershiser Comeback A `Miracle`|publisher=Sun Sentinel|last= |first= |date=May 30, 1991|accessdate=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this surgery, he pioneered a new procedure that reduced the amount of trauma suffered by tissue during the surgery. The surgery allowed Hershiser to continue his career, and the procedure continues to be used.&lt;ref name=nytimes_obit/&gt;

===Later years===
Jobe served as Clinical Professor, Department of [[Orthopedics]], for The [[Keck School of Medicine of USC|Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California]]. For 40 years, Jobe served as the team physician for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], remaining on their medical staff through 2008.&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite web|agency=Sports Network |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/03/07/3979840/tommy-john-surgery-pioneer-frank.html |title=Tommy John surgery pioneer Frank Jobe dies – Baseball Wires |publisher=MiamiHerald.com |date=March 7, 2014 |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death he was a special advisor to the chairman of the Dodger organization. He had also been the orthopedic consultant for professional golf's [[PGA Tour|PGA]] and [[Champions Tour]]s for 26 years, and named the emeritus physician for the [[PGA Tour]].&lt;ref name="drjobehof.org/biography" /&gt; Jobe mentored [[Lewis Yocum]], who was one of the best orthopedic surgeons in baseball when he died in May 2013.&lt;ref name=nytimes_obit/&gt;

Jobe authored over 140 medical publications, wrote 30 book chapters, and edited seven books. He received three [[honorary doctorate]]s, two from the United States and one from Japan.&lt;ref name="drjobehof.org/biography" /&gt;

==Personal life==
{{Portal|Seventh-day Adventist Church|Christianity|Biography|Medicine}}
Jobe met his future wife Beverly Anderson while working as a general practitioner and she was referred to him as a patient.  Rather than treat her himself, he had another doctor treat her so the pair could date.&lt;ref name=dougmiller/&gt; They had four sons, who had eight grandchildren.&lt;ref name=businessweek/&gt;

Jobe underwent [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] on four arteries in 2002 and had a [[defibrillator]] implanted in 2010.&lt;ref name=dougmiller/&gt; He died on March 6, 2014, at the age of 88, in [[Santa Monica, California]]. Jobe was a lifelong member of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adventistreview.org/church-news/their-faith-still-speaks-notable-deaths-in-2014 Their Faith Still Speaks: Notable Adventist Deaths in 2014] Adventist Review Retrieved October 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adventistreview.org/church-news/frank-jobe,-renown-sports-doctor,-passes-away Frank Jobe, Renown Sports Doctor, Passes Away] Adventist Review Retrieved October 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adventistreview.org/church-news/llu-school-of-medicine-alumnus,-frank-w.-jobe,-remembered-at-dodger-stadium LLU School of Medicine Alumnus, Frank W.

==Legacy==
[[Commissioner of Baseball|Baseball Commissioner]] [[Bud Selig]] issued a statement on Jobe's death saying, "I was deeply saddened to learn of the loss of Dr. Frank Jobe, a great gentleman whose work in baseball revolutionized sports medicine. Since 1974, his groundbreaking Tommy John surgery has revitalized countless careers, especially those of our pitchers."&lt;ref name=businessweek&gt;{{cite web|last=Gloster |first=Rob |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-03-07/frank-jobe-surgeon-who-repaired-pitchers-elbows-dies-at-88 |title=Frank Jobe, Surgeon Who Repaired Pitchers’ Elbows, Dies at 88 |publisher=Businessweek |date= |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Dilbeck of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' referred to Jobe as a "legend" and said "it could be argued that Jobe is the greatest orthopedic surgeon in history", while [[James Andrews (physician)|James Andrews]] called Jobe "one of the premier fathers of modern sports medicine", saying that "without his influence, baseball players' sports-medicine care would probably still be in the dark ages."&lt;ref name=dilbeck&gt;{{cite web|last=Dilbeck |first=Steve |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgersnow/la-sp-dn-frank-jobe-20140306,0,1054358.story#axzz2vI03LLvf |title=Remembering Dr. Frank Jobe |publisher=latimes.com |date= |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hall of Fame consideration===
Jobe's name has periodically been informally mentioned by sportswriters, fans, and players alike as worthy of a nomination for the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=Hoffarth&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffarth|first=Tom|title=What would it take for Dr. Frank Jobe to knife his way into the Baseball Hall of Fame?|date=April 24, 2012|publisher=Daily News|url=http://www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth/archives/2012/04/what-would-it-t.html|accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Isidore&gt;{{cite web|last=Isidore|first=Chris|title=Surgeon should make Cooperstown 'cut'|date=July 27, 2007|publisher=CNN Money|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/07/27/commentary/sportsbiz/index.htm|accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lopresti&gt;{{cite web|last=Lopresti|first=Mike|title=Cooperstown needs to take another look at these influences on the game|date=July 19, 2010|work=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/lopresti/2010-07-19-baseball-hall-of-fame_N.htm|accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, an official campaign Web site to have Frank Jobe honored by the National Baseball Hall of Fame was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drjobehof.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030221735/http://drjobehof.org/ |archivedate=October 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jobe was honored during Hall of Fame weekend on July 27, 2013, in [[Cooperstown, New York]]. Hall of Fame president [[Jeff Idelson]] said Jobe's work is a testament to the positive role of medicine in baseball's growth.

The '''George Eliava Institute of Bacteriophage, Microbiology and Virology'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eliava-institute.org/ George Eliava Institute of Bacteriophage, Microbiology and Virology]&lt;/ref&gt; (aka Tbilisi Institute) has been active since the 1930s in the field of [[phage therapy]], which is used to combat microbial infection (cf. [[antibiotic-resistant]] strains).

== History ==
The institute was opened in [[Tbilisi]], Georgia in 1923, and was a [[bacteriology]] laboratory. Its founder, Prof. [[George Eliava]], was not aware of [[bacteriophage]]s until 1919-1921. In those years he met [[Felix d'Herelle]] during a visit to the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Paris]]. There, Eliava was enthusiastic about the potential of phages in the curing of bacterial disease, and invited d'Herelle to visit his laboratory in Georgia.

D'Herelle visited Tbilisi twice in 1933-34, and agreed to work with Prof. Eliava. It has been suggested that d'Herelle became enamored of the communist idea. In 1934, [[Joseph Stalin]] invited d'Herelle to the institute in Tbilisi; he accepted and worked there for about 18 months. D'Herelle dedicated one of his books to Stalin, ''The Bacteriophage and the Phenomenon of Cure'', written and published in Tbilisi in 1935.

D'Herelle had planned to take up permanent residence in Tbilisi and had started to build a cottage on the grounds of the Institute; it would later house the [[KGB]]'s Georgian headquarters.

However, the collaboration between the two scientists was not to be. Around the time d'Herelle was to take up residence, in 1937 George Eliava was executed and denounced as an [[enemy of the people]]. D'Herelle fled from Tbilisi and, some believe, never returned. Another account states that he was in Paris at the time of Eliava's execution, and decided not to return. D'Herelle's book was also banned from distribution.

In spite of this development, the institute did not change its practical specialization, and continued its activity in the field of bacteriophage research.  In 1938, the Institute of Bacteriophage Research and the Institute of Microbiology &amp; Epidemiology (founded separately in 1936) merged, and the Institute of Microbiology, Epidemiology and Bacteriophage was formed.  It existed until 1951 and was authorized by the People's Commissary of Health of Georgia.  After 1951, it came under the auspices of the All-Union Ministry of Health and was renamed The Institute of Vaccine and Sera.

Since its inception, the institute was composed of a combination of industrial and scientific (research) departments. In 1988 the Institute was rearranged again and emerged as the Scientific Industrial Union "Bacteriophage" (SIU "Bacteriophage"). Around that time, its scientific portion was renamed the George Eliava Research Institute of Bacteriophage.

Based on the original intentions of D'Herelle and Eliava, the Bacteriophage Institute retained its leadership among other institutes of similar profile over the years. [[Teimuraz Chanishvili]] was the leader of the scientific part of the institute for over 30 years, until his death in August 2007.

== The institute behind the Iron Curtain ==

The institute in Tbilisi became a general Soviet institute for the development and production of bacteriophage drugs. Patients with serious infectious diseases came from all over the [[Soviet Union]] to receive treatments there. Bacteriophages became a routine part of treatment in clinics and hospitals. Ointments for the skin, and pills, drops, and rinses consisting of phages were sold and are still sold at pharmacies throughout [[Eastern Europe]] at low prices.

After the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] declined to join the [[Russian Federation]] and the [[Georgian Civil War]] broke out in 1991, the Tbilisi facility was essentially ruined. The Eliava Institute's facilities were damaged and decades of research on bacteriophage nearly went down the drain. Thousands of bacteriophage samples identified over the years and catalogued in huge, refrigerated "libraries" suffered irreversible damage due to frequent electrical outages. Apparently, the Russians transferred some of the equipment to their territory and built plants for the production of bacteriophages in other locations. Clearly, they recognized the importance of the research and also that of continued bacteriophage therapy. The situation at the Eliava Institute continued to deteriorate until it was on the verge of closure.

However, in 1997, a report on the institute was broadcast by the [[BBC]], sparking a flurry of media interest in the [[Western Bloc|West]]. The headlines drew doctors and scientists to Tbilisi - and also, most importantly, energetic entrepreneurs from around the world who were determined to help save the institute and its stocks and fully explore the potential of this "new" and highly effective therapy. Georgian scientists whose names were connected in some way to the institute saw great opportunity, and some of them emigrated to the West to be part of joint projects. Some of the institute's projects with the rest of the world can be seen on the website of the Georgian Academy of Sciences, the umbrella entity which now includes the Eliava Institute.

Dr. Revaz Adamia is a present director of the Eliava Institute.

==Laboratories==

The Institute includes the following laboratories: Laboratory of Physiology of Microorganisms, Laboratory of Biochemistry, Laboratory of Morphology of Bacteriophages, Laboratory of Immunology (includes the group of Virology), Laboratory of Standardization and Deposing of Bacteriophages (includes the group of Brucella and Anaerobic Bacteriophages), Laboratory of Biotechnology and Gene Engineering (includes the group of Selection and Taxonomy of Bacteriophages), Laboratory of Microbial Ecology, and Laboratory for Genetics of Microorganisms and Bacteriophages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1274">'''Gnarled enamel''' is a description of [[tooth enamel|enamel]] seen in [[histology|histologic]] sections of a [[tooth]] underneath a [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]]. This is optical appearance of enamel. The appearance of enamel appears different and very complex under the cusp, but this is not due to a different arrangement of dental tissues.  Instead, the enamel still has the same arrangement of [[enamel rod]]s.  The strange appearance results from the lines of enamel rods directed vertically under a cusp and from their orientation in a small circumference.

Gnarled enamel can sometimes be a problem for dentists; although experienced dentists have no problem identifying gnarled enamel and making the correct preparations, some inexperienced dentists face problems when performing a standard filling or root canal. The gnarled enamel can cause the drill problems and in some cases the dentist must replace the drill burr. The toughness of gnarled enamel varies from client to client and usually is nothing to be concerned about.

'''Google Fit''' is a health-tracking platform developed by [[Google]] for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system and [[Wear OS]]. It is a single set of [[Application programming interface|APIs]] that blends data from multiple [[mobile app|apps]] and devices.&lt;ref name="developers"/&gt; Google Fit uses sensors in a user's [[activity tracker]] or [[mobile device]] to record [[physical fitness]] activities (such as [[walking]] or [[cycling]]), which are measured against the user's fitness goals to provide a comprehensive view of their fitness.

==History==
Google Fit was announced at the [[Google I/O]] conference on June 25, 2014. A [[software development kit]] for Google Fit was released on August 7, 2014.&lt;ref name="developers"/&gt; Fit launched to the public on October 28, 2014.

In August 2018, Google announced a revamp to its Android Fit platform which adds activity goals based on activity recommendations from the [[American Heart Association]] and the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://blog.google/products/android/introducing-new-google-fit/ |title=Introducing the new Google Fit |website=The Keyword |publisher=Google |last=Hollendoner |first1=Margaret |date=August 21, 2018 |access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The updates are meant to help Fit better provide metrics for activities other than walking, and encourage users to engage in activities that will raise the heart rate without necessarily requiring a trip to the gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17761768/google-fit-redesign-heart-points-aha-whowear-os-android|title=Google Fit is getting redesigned with new health-tracking rings|work=The Verge|access-date=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
Google Fit provides a single set of APIs for apps and device manufacturers to store and access activity data from fitness apps and sensors on Android and other devices (like wearables, heart rate monitors or connected scales). Users can choose who their fitness data is shared with as well as delete this information at any time.&lt;ref name="developers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developers.googleblog.com/2014/08/google-fit-preview-sdk-now-available.html |last1=Ghosh |first1=Angana |website=Google Developers Blog |publisher=Google |title=Google Fit Preview SDK now available |date=August 7, 2014 |access-date=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 [[maternal mortality]] rate per 100,000 births for Guinea Bissau was 1000. This compares with 804.3 in 2008 and 966 in 1990.

'''Hermann Gröhe''' (born 25 February 1961) is a German politician of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) who served as [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|Minister of Health]] in the [[Third Merkel cabinet|third cabinet]] of [[Chancellor of Germany (1949–)|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] from 2013 until 2018.

== Early life and career ==
Gröhe finished law school at the [[University of Cologne]] and was a research assistant at the university 1987-1993. He also worked as a trainee lawyer at a local court in Cologne 1991-1993. He has been a licensed lawyer since 1997.&lt;ref name=cv&gt;[[Curriculum vitae|http://www.hermann-groehe.de/page/57.htm]] Hermann-grohe.de. Retrieved 16 December 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6LukZwjrr Archived] at WebCite.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
Becoming a member of CDU in 1977, Gröhe has represented the party in the [[German Bundestag]] since 1994 and has represented the [[Neuss I]] constituency since 1995. Between 1998 and 2005, he was his parliamentary group’s spokesperson on human rights and humanitarian aid. He subsequently served on the Committee on Foreign Affairs from 2005 until 2008.

From 2008 until 2009, Gröhe briefly served as Minister of State at the Federal Chancellery under Chancellor Angela Merkel. In the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] following the [[German federal election, 2009|2009 federal elections]], he was a member of the working group on economic affairs and energy, led by [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg]] and [[Rainer Brüderle]].

===Secretary General of the CDU, 2009-2013===
As successor of [[Ronald Pofalla]], Gröhe was secretary general of the CDU 2009-2013;&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; serving as the campaign manager in the [[German federal election, 2013]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/introducing-the-new-german-cabinet/g-17297820 Introducing the new German cabinet: Party loyalist] Deutsche Welle. Retrieved 16 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He was credited with marshalling [[Angela Merkel]]’s electoral victory that year, the party’s best result since [[German reunification]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Donahue (December 15, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-15/merkel-s-third-term-cabinet-social-democratic-party-ministers German Chancellor Merkel’s Third-Term Cabinet: List of Ministers] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] following the elections, Gröhe was part of the 15-member leadership circle chaired by Merkel, [[Horst Seehofer]] and [[Sigmar Gabriel]].

===Federal Minister of Health, 2013-2018===
Following the formation of the [[third Merkel cabinet|third cabinet]] of Chancellor Angela Merkel, Gröhe took office as [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|Federal Minister of Health]]. His deputies were Ingrid Fischbach and [[Annette Widmann-Mauz]].

In October 2014, Gröhe's elderly care reform bill, which is supposed to better fit the individual needs of those in care and expected to cost the government a further 1.2 billion euro ($1.5 billion), was passed by the Bundestag.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Schumacher (October 17, 2014), [http://www.dw.de/germany-passes-elderly-care-reform-despite-oppositions-criticism/a-18002085 Germany passes elderly care reform despite opposition's criticism] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, Gröhe was surprisingly contested by [[Jens Spahn]] for a place on the CDU’s ruling council, in a move that was widely seen as crystallizing the generational tensions within the party. Spahn’s election bid was backed by the then 72-year-old finance minister, [[Wolfgang Schäuble]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Wagstyl (December 7, 2014), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/215aad24-7e17-11e4-b7c3-00144feabdc0.html Political upstart challenges Germany’s greying leaders] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the vote at the annual CDU party conference, Gröhe withdrew his candidacy and Spahn was elected.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Wagstyl (December 9, 2014), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ebaac9b8-7fc2-11e4-acf3-00144feabdc0.html Merkel eyes relief for German taxpayers] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in office, Gröhe also focused heavily on [[global health]] issues. Alongside his colleague [[Gerd Müller (politician)|Gerd Müller]], he travelled to [[Ghana]] and [[Liberia]] right after the [[West African Ebola virus epidemic]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Tost (April 8, 2015), [http://www.euractiv.com/section/development-policy/news/german-ministers-visit-west-africa-with-lessons-from-ebola/ German ministers visit West Africa with ‘lessons from Ebola’] ''EurActiv''.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he accompanied Merkel when she spoke at the opening of the annual [[World Health Assembly]] in Geneva on the need for reforming the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) to ensure there is prompt response to health emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Boseley (May 18, 2015), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/angela-merkel-plan-restructure-world-health-organisation Plan to reform WHO after Ebola to be unveiled by Angela Merkel] ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of Germany's [[41st G7 summit|G7 presidency in 2015]], he brought together G7 Health Ministers to adopt a declaration addressing [[antimicrobial resistance]] (AMR).

In March 2016, Gröhe was appointed by [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] to the High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth, which was co-chaired by presidents [[François Hollande]] of [[France]] and [[Jacob Zuma]] of [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/hrh/com-heeg/comm_heeg_commissioners/en/ High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth – Commissioners] [[World Health Organization]].&lt;/ref&gt; He later led Germany's delegation to the [[2016 High Level Meeting on Ending AIDS]] in New York.

Ahead of the [[German federal election, 2017|2017 elections]], Gröhe was elected to lead his party’s campaign in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/hermann-groehe-fuehrt-landesliste-der-nrw-cdu-zur-bundestagswahl-an-aid-1.6616991 Landesvertreterversammlung: Gröhe führt Landesliste der NRW-CDU zur Bundestagswahl an] ''[[Rheinische Post]]'', February 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the negotiations to form a [[Fourth Merkel cabinet|fourth]] coalition government under Merkel, he led the working group on health policy, alongside [[Malu Dreyer]] and [[Georg Nüßlein]]. 

===Later career===
Since March 2018, Gröhe has been serving as deputy chairman of the [[CDU/CSU]] parliamentary group under the leadership of [[Volker Kauder]]. In this capacity, he oversees the group’s initiatives on social affairs and development policy. He was also appointed to the Pension Commission of the [[Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs]], a body mandated to draft recommendations for Germany’s old-age pension system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmas.de/DE/Presse/Meldungen/2018/rentenkommission-verlaesslicher-generationenvertrag-eingesetzt.html Rentenkommission "Verlässlicher Generationenvertrag" vorgestellt] [[Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs]], press release of May 3, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13506">The '''Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions''' ('''HCHDS'''), a research center within the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]], strives to eradicate disparities in health and [[health care]] among racial and [[ethnic group]]s, socioeconomic groups, and geopolitical categories such as urban, rural, and suburban populations.

The HCHDS works collaboratively with community-based organizations, [[historically black colleges and universities|historically black colleges]], and [[Minority Serving Institution|minority serving institutions]] to advance knowledge on the causes of health and health care disparities and develop interventions to eliminate them. Specifically, the HCHDS has collaborated with JHU- based organizational entities as well as the [[National Institute on Aging]], Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology of the Gerontology Research Center; [[Shaw University]]; Operation Reach Out South West (OROSW); and Nora, LLC. The HCHDS has been designated as a national Comprehensive Center of Excellence in Health Disparities by the NCMHD of the National Institutes of Health, and in 2007 was awarded a second 5-year grant to continue its work. The Center has a national focus although much of the actual work takes place in the local [[Baltimore, Maryland]] community.

==History==
The Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions was established in October 2002 with a 5-year grant from the National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCMHD), of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) under the Centers of Excellence in Partnerships for Community Outreach, Research on Health Disparities, and Training program (Project EXPORT).

==Mission ''"Exploration and Intervention for Health Equality..."''==
The mission of the Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions is to generate and disseminate knowledge to reduce racial/ethnic and social class disparities in health status and health care through research, training, community partnerships, and advocacy.

==Research==

===Exploring Health Disparities in Integrated Communities Study (EHDIC)===
This is a large-scale collaborative study consisting of determinants of disparities in chronic conditions. Progress in understanding the nature of health disparities requires  data that are race-comparative while overcoming confounding between race, socioeconomic status (SES), and segregation. The EHDIC study is a multi-cohort study that addresses these confounders by examining the nature of health disparities within racially integrated communities without racial disparities in SES.

===College Health and Wellness Study===
Overweight and obesity is an epidemic in the United States, particularly among minority populations. This epidemic contributes to the development of chronic conditions that occur later in life such as [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes]] and hypertension. The center conducted a [[Cross-sectional study|cross-sectional survey]] among students graduating from a  [[Historically Black Colleges and Universities|Historically Black College]] or University (HBCU) in the Mid-Atlantic Region. Participants were 392 predominately African- American seniors graduating in the spring of 2003. Data were collected using a self-administered paper and pencil questionnaire which focuses on weight, weight management activities, weight history, and health status indicators.

===Measuring Trust in Health Care===
This is a study to examine the validity of the psychometric properties of a new measure of trust/ mistrust of medical care systems. Trust is the foundation of the interrelationships that make [[civil society]] possible and the important of trust within healthcare is no less critical. Patients are inherently vulnerable within medical encounters and must be trustful of the multiple institutional entities and individuals involved in their care. Patients must trust that individual healthcare providers are competent and will have their best interest in mind while making treatment decisions. They must trust that the [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] have developed effective drugs and that the regulatory agencies have adequately monitored them. And, they must trust that the healthcare organization and that its staff will manage their medical information with discretion and confidentially.

===Environmental Influences on Tobacco Use in Urban Hispanic Young Adults===
The Hispanic community in Baltimore City, the [[Baltimore City Health Department]], HCHDS, and other important stakeholders worked together to examine the understanding of contextual factors (i.e., community/neighborhood and societal) that contribute to the high rates of tobacco use in the Hispanic community, with a focus on the population ages 18–24.

===Developing Measures of Parental Knowledge in Physical Activity===
Parental knowledge of child health and development issues can have important effects on child health.  Greater awareness of the content areas in which parents require more guidance can help clinicians devise parent-centered strategies to reduce identified knowledge deficits and may both increase the quality of care and reduce disparities in child health.  The primary goal of this pilot project is to develop a set of parental health knowledge assessment questions relevant to physical activity in children 5 years or younger and to conduct preliminary reliability and validity studies 
of these questions.

==Training and education==
The Kellogg Community Scholars and The Urban Health Institute Fellows are both Postdoctoral training opportunities found at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health that address health disparities-related issues.

===Kellogg Community Scholars===
The goal of the Community Health Scholars Program (CHSP) is to increase the number of faculty at health professional schools, with an emphasis on schools of public health, who possess the capacity to carry out community-based participatory research and teaching and who understand determinants of community health and how to build the capacity of communities, health-related agencies and academic centers to function as equal partners in community-based research, service and education.

===Urban Health Institute Fellows===
The goal of the UHI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship program is to promote future leaders in the field of urban health research. The fellows, each working in tandem with a Hopkins faculty member, carry out scholarly research and publication on such issues as crime, unemployment, poverty, substance abuse, diabetes, hypertension and other chronic diseases.

===Graduate training opportunities===
In addition to offering Doctoral and master's degrees, the Bloomberg School of Public Health also offers certificates of concentration in subspecialties in public health.  Thus, a student can obtain a Doctoral or master's degree from any one of the ten departments that comprise the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and also earn an optional certificate in a specialized topic area. The school currently offers certificates in 21 topic areas, including the [http://commprojects.jhsph.edu/academics/prop.cfm?id=21 Certificate Program in Health Disparities and Health Inequality], established by Drs. LaVeist and Gaskin in 2003. The program is open to students enrolled in any graduate degree program at Johns Hopkins University.

'''In-depth systemics''' is a context independent professional work approach and an extension of the field of systemic therapy and counseling approaches. The following elements are integrated: (a) classical ''[[Systemic therapy (psychotherapy)|systemic (family) therapy]]'', (b) reconstructive work based on the principles of ''[[Hermeneutics#Objective hermeneutics|objective hermeneutics]]'', (c) ''[[coopetition]]'' as an expression of the dialectic relationship of cooperation and competition, and (d) as the central core element, ''[[Vipassana]]''-meditation in the tradition of Sayagyi ''[[Ba Khin|U Ba Khin]]'' as taught by S.N. ''[[Satya Narayan Goenka|Goenka]]''. Vipassana-meditation plays an essential role in the development of mindfulness and inner wisdom about oneself. It is an instrument to coordinate unconscious perceptions to reach a deeper dimension, which cannot be achieved through traditional therapeutic or counseling methods.

== History ==

The development of in-depth systemics derives from therapeutic works of Gerhard Scholz and Sergio Mantovani with drug addicts in the early 1990s in Zürich (Switzerland). They observed that the root cause of drug addiction is a basic addiction to existence itself.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz, G. (1992). ''Vipassana Meditation und Drogensucht. Eine Studie über den Ausstieg aus der Herrschaft der Attraktion Droge.'' Zürich.&lt;/ref&gt; Addiction is not (just) the craving for pharmaceutical substances but rather an existential desire and craving for pleasant physical sensations, which the consummation of drugs can produce. Hence, addiction is a deeply unconscious habitual way of mental reaction: craving for pleasant and aversion against unpleasant physical bodily sensations. These bodily sensations arise through various sensory stimuli and change constantly.

This innovative view of addiction can easily be applied to non-substance related addictions as well, such as gambling, online activities, sexuality, an excessive preoccupation with one’s looks, eating, sports, etc., as well as with secondary phenomena, such as the desire for power or prestige.

After using in-depth systemics in stationary drug therapy since 1992, the model was extended in 2001 and first applied to the field of ''[[Case Management|case management]]'' interventions&lt;ref&gt;Studer, U.M. (2007). Ziel: Zurück ins Arbeitsleben. ''fitimjob-Magazin'', Oct/Nov, 28–31.&lt;/ref&gt; (particularly high cost cases). The goal was not only a recovery from personal deficits but also to support the personal development and autonomy of clients. Later, in-depth systemics was applied to business leadership&lt;ref&gt;Scholz, G. (2015). Tiefensystemische Führung – Humberto Maturana weiter gedacht und gelebt. ''Lernende Organisation – Zeitschrift für relationales Management und Organisation'', 88, 16-29.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the coaching of sport prodigies (competitive athletes). In 2010, a day center for youths and young adults was established, based on the principles of in-depth systemics, with the goal of offering clients a structure to motivate them to work on a long-term professional perspective.

== The in-depth systemics model and its changes ==

While working with heavy drug addicts, a model based on four pillars was designed: (1) daily life as therapy versus therapy as daily life,&lt;ref&gt;Hildenbrand, B. (1992). ''Alltag als Therapie.'' Bern: Huber.&lt;/ref&gt; (2) systemic individual, partner, and family therapy, (3) various(?) self-help concepts, and (4) meditation techniques (Anapana-sati and Vipassana-meditation as taught by S.N. Goenka). The totality of these elements was included in the statutes of the association start again&lt;ref&gt;Statuten des Verein start again soziale Unternehmungen URL: http://www.startagain.ch/files/cms/tiny/Statuten.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and labeled explicitly as ''in-depth systemics''.

The application of the work in various contexts (e.g., case management, business leadership, coaching of prodigies) required a strong redesign and extension of the model. Vipassana-meditation became the central core, because it provides the actual instrument to initiate real personal transformation. It empowers practitioners to perceive themselves in a direct, realistic, and undistorted way - from moment to moment in the here-and-now. The goal is the development of equanimity to counteract the habitual addictive attitude at the existential level: the acceptance of unpleasant sensations and the relinquishing of craving for pleasant physical sensations. As a result, the inner world is perceived accurately and realistically. Mediated through the sensory organs, the outer world is also perceived more accurately and undistorted. As a consequence, individual actions become freer from reactions, since decisions are less influenced by habitual inner reactions than by the particularities of the specific case. The achieved autonomy flows into the application of the principles of coopetition, qualification, and reconstructive understanding.

The extension of the addiction based model required the re-definition of elements: self-help was used to develop the dialectic concept of coopetition. Coopetition means that an individual experiences simultaneously aspects of cooperation as well as competition within every professional context. Both must be integrated in the dialectical sense to act efficiently and effectively professionally.

Systemic therapy was translated into two parts: qualification and relational/reconstructive understanding. Qualification means that the minimum requirement but not the goal of every professional work context is the content-oriented qualification of the individual. Relational/reconstructive understanding on the other hand refers to the reconstructive ability, along the principles of the objective hermeneutics case analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Oevermann, U. (2000). Die Methode der Fallrekonstruktion in der Grundlagenforschung sowie der klinischen und pädagogischen Praxis. In: K. Kraimer (Hrsg.): ''Die Fallrekonstruktion. Sinnverstehen in der sozialwissenschaftlichen Forschung'', 58–156, Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wernet, A. (2000). ''Einführung in die Interpretationstechnik der Objektiven Hermeneutik.'' Wiesbaden: VS-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; to combine all available information of a case to work out its essential challenges.

The described three cornerstones of the model should not to be understood as fixed but might change depending on the particular working context. This is based on the conviction that the application of the model within a new context must be done each time anew to remain sensitive to the particularities of each case. However, the central core element of Vipassana-meditation remains fixed, because only through the practice of Vipassana-meditation and the observation of one’s own bodily sensations with equanimity can personal transformation of one's own mental-somatic models&lt;ref&gt;Gürtler, L., Studer, U. &amp; Scholz, G., (2012). ''Awareness and Wisdom in Addiction Therapy. The In-depth Systemics Treatment of Mental-somatic Models.'' Pariyatti Press.&lt;/ref&gt; be realized.

==  Working procedure ==

Central for in-depth systemics work is the continuous practice of one’s own individual mental-somatic models through the practice of Vipassana-meditation as taught by S.N. Goenka. This ensures that apart from the ongoing development of professional qualifications, reconstructive understanding, and coopetition, the transformative processes in the depth of the mind are maintained. Vipassana-meditation can be learned in initial 10-day retreats, after which individuals can continue to practice the meditation technique autonomously.

== Scientific evaluation ==

Between 1992–1998, a scientific evaluation&lt;ref&gt;Studer, U.M. (1998). ''Verlangen, Süchtigkeit und Tiefensystemik. Fallstudie des Suchttherapiezentrums für Drogensüchtige start again in Männedorf und Zürich von 1992 bis 1998. Bericht an das Bundesamt für Justiz.'' Zürich. URL: https://www.bj.admin.ch/dam/data/bj/sicherheit/smv/modellversuche/evaluationsberichte/37.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of the drug therapy center start again (Zürich/ CH) took place, which is based on in-depth systemics principles. The research study was financially supported by the Swiss federal office of justice. The task was to investigate whether ''therapy instead of prison'' in the context of severe drug addiction has a positive empirical outcome for the target group. A conservative criterion was chosen to define recovery from drug addiction empirically and to measure therapeutic success. The study followed a ''[[Multimethodology|mixed-methods]]'' research design by combining qualitative as well as quantitative methodologies: case reconstructive work based on objective hermeneutical analysis as well as statistical calculations of therapeutic success by means of Bayesian statistics for small samples&lt;ref&gt;Studer, U. (2006). Probability theory and inference: How to draw consistent conclusions from incomplete information. ''Qualitative Research in Psychology'', 3, 329-345.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Studer, U. (1996). ''Wahrscheinlichkeit als Logik: Die formale Struktur konsistenten Schlussfolgerns. Technical Report. Zwischenbericht an das Bundesamt für Justiz (BAJ) vom Dezember 1996.'' Zürich.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main results of the study showed that 2/3 of the clients who completed the whole therapeutic program could be classified as a success in accordance with the chosen conservative criterion for therapeutic success. No significant differences were found between men and women and between clients who participated voluntarily and those who chose a “therapy instead of prison” sentence. Vipassana-meditation was identified as an important predictor for the prevention of serious relapse. However, Vipassana-meditation did not predict therapeutic success. Urban Studer, the author of the study concluded that it is the institution with its in-depth systemics program as a whole that works rather than a single isolated factor.

Between 2007 and 2010, a qualitative catamnestic follow-up study&lt;ref&gt;Gürtler, L., Studer, U., &amp; Scholz, G., (2010). ''Tiefensystemik. Band 1. Lebenspraxis und Theorie. Wege aus Süchtigkeit finden.'' Münster: Monsenstein und Vannerdat.&lt;/ref&gt; with former clients of start again was conducted to reconstruct retrospectively their personal and professional biography after leaving the therapeutic program. Based on objective hermeneutical analyses, a model was developed to describe recovery from drug addiction. The model was applied to the clients’ life course after therapy and allowed the derivation of testable predictions. The model contains the following steps: (1) small steps, (2) small changes, (3) transformation of vulnerabilities to resources, and (4) the dissolution of the dependence on resources as well as vulnerabilities. The studied clients reached level (3) and one client showed evidence of level (4).

A systematic scientific evaluation of in-depth systemics in case management, business leadership, and coaching of sports prodigies has not been conducted yet.

An '''intelligent medical search engine''' is a [[vertical search]] engine that uses [[expert system]] technology to provide personalized medical information.&lt;ref&gt;Luo and Tang, SIGIR 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Searching for medical information on the Web is a challenging task for ordinary Internet users. Often, users are uncertain about their exact medical situations, are unfamiliar with [[medical terminology]], and hence have difficulty in coming up with the right search keywords.&lt;ref&gt;Luo and Tang, ICPR 2008&lt;/ref&gt; An intelligent medical [[search engine]] is specifically designed to address this challenge. It uses several techniques to improve its usability and search result quality. First, it uses an interactive [[questionnaire]]-based query interface to guide users to provide the most important information about their situations. Users perform search by selecting [[symptom]]s and answering questions rather than by typing keyword queries. Second, it uses medical knowledge (e.g., diagnostic [[decision tree]]s) to automatically form multiple queries from a user' answers to the questions. These queries are used to perform search simultaneously. Third, it provides various kinds of help functions.&lt;ref&gt;Luo and Tang, SIGIR 2008; Luo, AAAI 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a user has made incorrect selections, does not know which symptoms to select, or cannot answer a question, he or she can invoke the search engine's help functionality and describe his or her health situation there. Then he or she will see multiple lists of help information, e.g., one list for relevance of unselected symptoms, and another list for relevance of alternate responses (to his or her selections). The contents of those lists are ranked using medical knowledge and specially designed medical [[information retrieval]] techniques.

The '''International Society for Infectious Diseases''' (ISID), established in 1986, is a [[non-profit]] organization that works to control [[infectious disease]] outbreaks and improve the care of patients afflicted with these conditions.

==Work==
The Society recognizes the evolving nature of infectious diseases and their ability to cross regional and national boundaries. Through training and educational opportunities for healthcare professionals, the Society works to overcome these obstacles to improve health on a global scale. ISID seeks to  establish lasting partnerships with all manner of health-related disciplines to develop innovative methods for infectious disease control. With programs such as [[ProMED-mail]], the International Congress on Infectious Diseases, the International Meeting on Emerging Diseases, and the International Journal of Infectious, ISID maintains an active presence in the scientific community.

The main goals of ISID are to:
* Increase the knowledge base of infectious diseases through research and enhance the professional development of individuals in this discipline
* Extend and transfer technical expertise in infectious diseases and microbiology
* Create and foster partnerships for the control and cost-effective management of infectious diseases around the world

== History ==
ISID was created in 1986 by a merger between the International Congress on Infectious Diseases (ICID) and the International Federation on Infectious and Parasitic Diseases (IFIPD). The organization is headquartered in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] USA.

=== The International Congress on Infectious Diseases ===
[[File:16th ICID, Cape Town, South Africa.jpg|thumb|296x296px|16th International Congress on Infectious Diseases held in Cape Town, South Africa.]]
The International Congress on Infectious Diseases (ICID) was established in 1983 as a scientific assembly for the exchange of research and clinical information of infectious diseases. The ICID takes place every two years in a different region of the world to ensure the meeting is accessible to all persons interested in attending. The congress is committed to assisting colleagues from low-resource countries, and draws physicians and microbiologists from a range of backgrounds and countries. Approximately 2,500 clinicians, researchers, academics, public health practitioners, experts and leaders from over 100 countries attend these meetings. Attendees are updated concerning advances and challenges in the area of [[HIV]], respiratory infections including [[pneumonia]] and [[tuberculosis]], [[enteric infections]], [[emerging infectious disease]]s, diagnostic advances, infection control, [[antimicrobial resistance]], [[malaria]], and [[Neglected tropical diseases|neglected infectious diseases]]. Congress events include plenary speakers, symposia, meet-the-expert and poster sessions, all of which provide a platform to network, exchange research findings, and collaborate on problem-solving strategies in the area of global infectious diseases.

=== ProMED-mail ===
{{main|ProMED-mail}}
[[File:ProMED-mai.jpeg|thumb|296x296px]]
[[ProMED-mail]] (also referred to as ProMED for short) is one of the largest publicly available Internet-based disease-reporting platforms. Healthcare professionals can post information related to diseases of human, animal, environmental, and agricultural importance following a [[One Health]] model.

===''The International Journal of Infectious Diseases''===
[[File:International-Journal-of-Infectious-Diseases-2.jpg|thumb|200x200px]]
''The International Journal of Infectious Diseases'' (''IJID)'' is an open-access, peer-reviewed monthly journal that serves to convey information on the [[epidemiology]], clinical evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and control of infections. The journal’s primary audience includes infectious disease researchers and clinicians throughout the world. The Journal seeks to enhance the reader's understanding of the medical and cultural factors that affect infectious diseases in different regions, particularly those of under-resourced countries. This approach provides insight into outbreak characteristics with the opportunity to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases.

=== The International Meeting on Emerging Diseases ===
The International Meeting on Emerging Diseases (IMED) is held every two years and brings together leading scientists, clinicians, and policy makers to present innovative knowledge and breakthroughs in the area of emerging diseases. Meetings primarily focus on the discovery, detection, understanding, response, and preventative measures associated with outbreaks of emerging pathogens. With a central focus on the [[One Health]] model, participants recognize the inextricable link between human, animal, environmental health as they relate to the emergence and spread of diseases.

=== The Guide to Infection Control in the Hospital ===
[[File:Infection Control Guide 5th Edition Cover.jpg|thumb|235x235px|5th edition cover of The Guide to Infection Control in the Hospital]]
The Guide to Infection Control in the Hospital is a practical handbook for the management of nosocomial infections and the development of hospital-based infection control programs. This pocket-sized manual, in its 5th edition, contains 60 chapters that explain key principles and guidelines for reducing the rate of infections. With practical measures intended to improve quality of care, minimize risk, reduce costs, and ultimately save lives, the guide is an invaluable resource for all healthcare facilities. Past editions have been translated into Spanish, Polish, Croatian, Russian, and Chinese.

=== Fellowship and Grant Programs ===
ISID offers several grant programs and fellowship opportunities for healthcare professionals. These programs are designed to assist individuals from low- and middle-income countries while contributing to the general knowledge base of infectious diseases.

====ISID Research Grants Program====
The ISID Research Grants Program was established to fund pilot research projects and train young disease outbreak investigators from resource-limited countries. The goal of the program is to support and foster the professional development of individuals in the field of infectious disease research by helping them to acquire additional skills and data to advance their careers. As of 2015, ISID has awarded 166 grants to recipients from 43 countries including [[Argentina]], [[Cameroon]], [[India]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[South Africa]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Peru]].

====Swiss Society for Infectious Diseases/ISID Infectious Diseases Research Fellowship Program====
ISID and the Swiss Society for Infectious Diseases (SSI) jointly sponsor the SSI/ISID Infectious Diseases Research Fellowship Program. The purpose of this Fellowship Program is to support infectious disease physicians and scientists from low- and middle-income countries through [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary]] clinical and laboratory training at select biomedical institutions in Switzerland. A financial stipend of up to 36,000 SF per year (approximately $35,500 USD) is given to Fellows to cover travel costs and living expenses. The program intends to award two fellowships each year.

==== ISID / European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Fellowship Program ====
The ISID and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) co-sponsor the ISID/ESCMID Fellowship Program, enabling two Fellows per year to perform multidisciplinary clinical and laboratory training abroad. This particular fellowship is intended for applicants from outside Europe.

== ISID Governance ==
The Society is governed by an International Council, which is elected by the membership. The Council is organized according to geographic region to ensure representation from all the areas of the world. The ISID membership also approves an Executive Committee and its officers. The Executive Committee is responsible for the activities of the Society. The Executive Committee appoints an Executive Director who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of Society.

'''Intracytoplasmic sperm injection''' ('''ICSI''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|k|s|i}} {{Respell|IK|see}}) is an [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) procedure in which a single [[spermatozoon|sperm]] cell is injected directly into the cytoplasm of an [[ovum|egg]]. This technique is used in order to prepare the [[gamete]]s for the obtention of embryos that may be transferred to a maternal uterus. With this method [[acrosome reaction]] is skipped.

There are several differences within classic IVF and ICSI. However, the steps to be followed before and after insemination are the same. In terms of insemination, ICSI needs one only sperm cell per [[oocyte]], meanwhile IVF needs between 50 and 100 thousands. This is due to the fact that in IVF acrosome reaction has to take place and thousands of sperm cells have to be involved. Once fertilized, the egg is transformed into a [[proembryo]] and it has to be transferred to the uterus to continue its development.

The first human pregnancy generated by ICS was carried out in 1991 by [[Gianpiero D. Palermo|Gianpiero Palermo]] and his team.

==Round spermatid injection (ROSI)==

Round spermatid injection (ROSI) is a technique of assisted reproduction whereby a round spermatid is injected into oocyte cytoplasm in order to achieve fertilization. This technique can be used to enable genetic fatherhood to some men who have no spermatozoa in the ejaculate (azoospermia) and in whom spermatozoa cannot be obtained surgically from the testicles. This condition is called nonobstructive or secretory azoospermia, as opposed to obstructive azoospermia, in which complete sperm production does occur in the testicles, and potentially fertilizing spermatozoa can be obtained by testicular sperm extraction (TESE) and used for ICSI. In cases of nonobstructive (secretory) azoospermia, on the other hand, testicular sperm production is blocked at different stages of the process of sperm formation (spermatogenesis). In those men in whom spermatogenesis is blocked at the stage of round spermatids, in which meiosis has already been completed, these round cells can successfully fertilize oocytes after being injected into their cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;. Tesarik J, Rolet F, Brami C, Sedbon E, Thorel J, Tibi C, Thébault A. Spermatid injection into human oocytes. II. Clinical application in the treatment of infertility due to non-obstructive azoospermia. Hum Reprod 1996; 11:780-783 &lt;/ref&gt; Before the development of the ROSI technique, men with the arrest of spermatogenesis at the round spermatid stage could only have children with the use of donor spermatozoa.

Even though many technical aspects of ROSI are similar to those of ICSI, there are also significant differences between both techniques. &lt;ref&gt;Tesarik J, Mendoza C. Spermatid injetion into human oocytes. I. Laboratory techniques and special features of zygote development. Hum Reprod 1996; 11:772-779 &lt;/ref&gt; In the first place, as compared to spermatozoa, round spermatids do not possess easily perceptible morphological characteristics and are immotile. Consequently, the distinction between round spermatids and other round cells of similar size, such as leukocytes, is not an easy task. Moreover, the distinction between living round spermatids, to be used in ROSI, and dead round spermatids, to be discarded, needs specific methods and skills, not required in the case of ICSI where sperm cell viability can be easily evaluated on the basis of sperm motility in most cases. &lt;ref&gt;Tesarik J, Mendoza C. Spermatid injetion into human oocytes. I. Laboratory techniques and special features of zygote development. Hum Reprod 1996; 11:772-779 &lt;/ref&gt; The microinjection procedure for ROSI also differs slightly from that of ICSI, since additional stimuli are needed to ensure proper oocyte activation after spermatid injection. If all requirements for round spermatid selection and injection are successfully met, the injected oocytes develop to early embryos and can be transferred to the mother’s uterus to produce pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;. Tesarik J, Rolet F, Brami C, Sedbon E, Thorel J, Tibi C, Thébault A. Spermatid injection into human oocytes. II. Clinical application in the treatment of infertility due to non-obstructive azoospermia. Hum Reprod 1996; 11:780-783 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tesarik J, Mendoza C. Spermatid injetion into human oocytes. I. Laboratory techniques and special features of zygote development. Hum Reprod 1996; 11:772-779 &lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful pregnancies and births with the use of ROSI were achieved in 1995 by Jan Tesarik and his team.&lt;ref&gt;Tesarik J, Mendoza C, Testart J. Viable embryos from injection of round spermatids into oocytes. N Engl J Med 1995; 333:525&lt;/ref&gt;The clinical potential of ROSI in the treatment of male infertility due to the total absence of spermatozoa has been corroborated recently by a publication reporting on the postnatal development of 90 babies born in Japan and 17 in Spain. &lt;ref&gt;Tanaka A, Suzuki K, Nagayoshi M, Tanaka A, Takemoto Y, Watanabe S, Takeda S, Irahara M, Kuji N, Yamagata Z, Yanagimachi R.

==Indications==
[[File:Blausen 0060 AssistedReproductiveTechnology.png|thumb|Schematic image of intracytoplasmic sperm injection in the context of [[in vitro fertilisation|IVF]].]]

This procedure is most commonly used to overcome male [[infertility]] problems, although it may also be used where eggs cannot easily be penetrated by sperm, and occasionally in addition to [[sperm donation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boulet SL, Mehta A, Kissin DM, Warner L, Kawwass JF, Jamieson DJ | title = Trends in use of and reproductive outcomes associated with intracytoplasmic sperm injection| journal = JAMA| volume = 313 | issue = 3 | pages = 255–63 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25602996| doi = 10.1001/jama.2014.17985 | pmc=4343214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be used in [[teratozoospermia]], because once the egg is fertilized, abnormal sperm morphology does not appear to influence [[blastocyst]] development or blastocyst morphology.&lt;ref name="French et al 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=French DB, Sabanegh ES, Goldfarb J, Desai N |title=Does severe teratozoospermia affect blastocyst formation, live birth rate, and other clinical outcome parameters in ICSI cycles? |journal=Fertil Steril |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=1097–1103 |date=March 2010 |pmid=19200957 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.10.051 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with severe teratozoospermia, microscopy can still detect the few sperm cells that have a "normal" morphology, allowing for optimal success rate.&lt;ref name="French et al 2010" /&gt;

==History==

The first child born from a gamete micromanipulation (technique in which special tools and inverted microscopes are used that help embryologists to choose and pick an individual sperm for [http://www.testtubebabyprocess.com/2016/12/icsi-ivf.html ICSI IVF]) was a child in Singapore-born in April 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Third Party Assisted Conception Across Cultures: Social, Legal and Ethical Perspectives|authors=Blyth, Eric; Landau, Ruth|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year= 2004|isbn=9781843100843|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KtMPBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=SUZI+ng+%22april+1989%22#v=onepage&amp;q=SUZI%20ng%20%22april%201989%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique was developed by [[Gianpiero D.

Sharpe ''et al'' comment on the success of ICSI since 1992 saying, "[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. ICSI’s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI’s success depends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barratt | first1 = Christopher L.R. | last2 = De Jonge | first2 = Christopher J. | last3 = Sharpe | first3 = Richard M. | title = 'Man Up': the importance and strategy for placing male reproductive health centre stage in the political and research agenda | journal = [[Human Reproduction (journal)|Human Reproduction]] | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 541–545 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/dey020 | pmid = 29425298 | pmc = 5989613 | date = 7 February 2018 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Knapton | first = Sarah | title = IVF to fix male infertility 'infringes human rights of women' argue scientists | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/03/06/ivf-fix-male-infertility-infringes-human-rights-women-argue/ | work = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date = 6 March 2018 | access-date = 7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
ICSI is generally performed following a transvaginal oocyte retrieval procedure to extract one to several oocytes from a woman.

In ICSI IVF, the male partner or a donor provides a sperm sample on the same day when the eggs are collected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.testtubebabyprocess.com/2016/12/icsi-ivf.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The sample is checked in the lab, and if no sperm is present, doctors will extract sperm from the epididymis or testicle. The extraction of sperm from epididymis is also known as percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA) and extraction of sperm from testicle is also known as testicular sperm aspiration (TESA).
[[File:ICSI Procedure.jpg|thumb|240x240px|A medical animation still showing ICSI procedure.]]
The procedure is done under a [[microscope]] using multiple micromanipulation devices ([[micromanipulator]], [[microinjectors]] and [[micropipettes]]). A holding pipette stabilizes the mature [[oocyte]] with gentle suction applied by a microinjector. From the opposite side a thin, hollow glass micropipette is used to collect a single sperm, having immobilised it by cutting its tail with the point of the micropipette. The oocyte is pierced through the [[oolemma]] and the sperm is directed into the inner part of the oocyte (cytoplasm). The sperm is then released into the oocyte. The pictured oocyte has an extruded [[polar body]] at about 12 o'clock indicating its maturity.  The polar body is positioned at the 12 or 6 o'clock position, to ensure that the inserted micropipette does not disrupt the spindle inside the egg. After the procedure, the oocyte will be placed into cell culture and checked on the following day for signs of [[fertilization]].

In contrast, in natural fertilization sperm compete and when the first sperm penetrates the oolemma, the oolemma hardens to block the entry of any other sperm. Concern has been raised that in ICSI this sperm selection process is bypassed and the sperm is selected by the embryologist without any specific testing. However, in mid-2006 the FDA cleared a device that allows embryologists to select mature sperm for ICSI based on sperm binding to [[hyaluronan]], the main constituent of the gel layer ([[cumulus oophorus]]) surrounding the oocyte.  The device provides microscopic droplets of hyaluronan hydrogel attached to the culture dish.  The embryologist places the prepared sperm on the microdot, selects and captures sperm that bind to the dot.  Basic research on the maturation of sperm shows that hyaluronan-binding sperm are more mature and show fewer DNA strand breaks and significantly lower levels of [[aneuploidy]] than the sperm population from which they were selected. A brand name for one such sperm selection device is PICSI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/07/prweb407895.htm|title=New Sperm Selection Technology for Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Cleared by FDA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent clinical trial showed a sharp reduction in miscarriage with embryos derived from PICSI sperm selection.&lt;ref&gt;K.C.

'Washed' or 'unwashed' sperm may be used in the process.

== Assisted zona hatching (AH) ==
People who have experienced repeated failed implantation or who have a thick [[zona pellucida]] (covering around the embryo) are ideal candidates for [[assisted zona hatching]]. The procedure involves creating a hole in the zona to improve the chances of normal implantation of the embryo in the uterus.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) ===
PGD is a process in which one or two cells from an embryo on Day 3 or Day 5 are extracted and the cells genetically analyzed. Couples who are at a high risk of having abnormal number of [[chromosome]]s or who have an history of single gene defects or chromosome defects are ideal candidates for this procedure. It is used to diagnose a large number of genetic defects at present.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Success or failure factors ==
One of the areas in which sperm injection can be useful is vasectomy reversal. However, potential factors that may influence [[pregnancy rates]] (and live birth rates) in ICSI include level of [[DNA fragmentation]]&lt;ref name="speyer"&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 2010|title=Fall in implantation rates following ICSI with sperm with high DNA fragmentation|url=|journal=Hum Reprod|volume=25|issue=7|pages=1609–1618|doi=10.1093/humrep/deq116|pmid=20495207|vauthors=Speyer BE, Pizzey AR, Ranieri M, Joshi R, Delhanty JD, Serhal P}}&lt;/ref&gt; as measured e.g. by [[comet assay]], [[advanced maternal age]] and [[semen quality]].

A systematic meta-analysis of 24 estimates of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] based on a variety of techniques concluded that [[sperm]] DNA damage negatively affects clinical pregnancy following ICSI.&lt;ref name="pmid27345006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Simon L, Zini A, Dyachenko A, Ciampi A, Carrell DT |title=A systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of sperm DNA damage on in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection outcome |journal=Asian J. Androl. |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=80–90 |year=2017 |pmid=27345006 |pmc=5227680 |doi=10.4103/1008-682X.182822 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==
{{See also|In vitro fertilisation#Complications}}

There is some suggestion that [[birth defects]] are increased with the use of IVF in general, and ICSI specifically, though different studies show contradictory results. In a summary position paper, the Practice Committee of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine has said it considers ICSI safe and effective therapy for male factor infertility, but may carry an increased risk for the transmission of selected genetic abnormalities to offspring, either through the procedure itself or through the increased inherent risk of such abnormalities in parents undergoing the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = 2006| title = Genetic considerations related to intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) | url = | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 86 | issue = 5| pages = S103–S105 | doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2006.07.1489| pmid =  17055799| author1 =  Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine| author2 =  Practice Committee of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is not enough evidence to say that ICSI procedures are safe in females with [[hepatitis B]] in regard to vertical transmission to the offspring, since the puncture of the oocyte can potentially avail for [[vertical transmission]] to the offspring.&lt;ref name=Lutgens2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lutgens | first1 = S. P. M. | last2 = Nelissen | first2 = E. C. M. | last3 = Van Loo | first3 = I. H. M. | last4 = Koek | first4 = G. H. | last5 = Derhaag | first5 = J. G. | last6 = Dunselman | first6 = G. A.

== Follow-up on fetus==
In addition to regular [[prenatal care]], [[prenatal aneuploidy screening]] based on [[maternal age]], [[nuchal translucency]] scan and biomarkers is appropriate. However, biomarkers seem to be altered for pregnancies resulting from ICSI, causing a higher false-positive rate. Correction factors have been developed and should be used when screening for [[Down syndrome]] in singleton pregnancies after ICSI,&lt;ref name=Gjerris2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gjerris|first=Anne Catherine|author2=Ann Tabor |author3=Anne Loft |author4=Michael Christiansen |author5=Anja Pinborg |title=First trimester prenatal screening among women pregnant after IVF/ICSI|journal=Human Reproduction Update|year=2012|volume=18|issue=4|pages=350–359|doi=10.1093/humupd/dms010|pmid=22523111}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in twin pregnancies such correction factors have not been fully elucidated.&lt;ref name=Gjerris2012/&gt; In [[vanishing twin]] pregnancies with a second gestational sac with a dead fetus, first trimester screening should be based solely on the maternal age and the nuchal translucency scan as biomarkers are significantly altered in these cases.&lt;ref name=Gjerris2012/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2051">'''Invoke Image Display''' (IID) is an IHE Integration Profile that simplifies the task of integrating non-image-aware systems like EHRs, EMRs, PHRs, RIS and other information systems with image-aware systems like [[Picture Archiving and Communications Systems|PACS]], [[Vendor Neutral Archive|VNA]] and Image Sharing solutions, by providing a standard mechanism to request that imaging studies be displayed.

==Implementation==
'''IID''' defines a simple HTTP GET request that contains in the URL either a patient identifier or a list of study identifiers, and a small set of additional parameters to dictate display behavior.

The profile specifies requirements for the display to provide interactive viewing of a complete set of diagnostic images, if requested. The interactivity required includes windowing, zooming and panning as well as image navigation.

Security is addressed through normal HTTP mechanisms.

The display can take the form of a browser based viewer, a separate applet, plugin or thick client based viewer or even a separate physical machine; the invocation remains the same and is agnostic to the viewer implementation mechanism.

==Specification==

The profile is defined as part of the [http://www.ihe.net/Resources/Technical_Frameworks/#radiology IHE Radiology Technical Framework].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Radiology Technical Committee|first=IHE|title=Invoke Image Display (IID) - Trial Implementation|url=http://www.ihe.net/Technical_Framework/upload/IHE_RAD_Suppl_IID.pdf|accessdate=2017-07-03|date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Iranian National Museum of Medical Sciences History''' is the first medical museum established in Iran by a joint project between the Iranian Cultural Heritage Organization, the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Iranian Academy of Medical Sciences, and Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

[[File:Iranian national Museum of Medical Sciences; Tehran; Iran-2.jpg|thumb]]

In spring 1997 and during a meeting with presence of Dr. Mohammad Frahadi (the former Minister of Health and Medical Education), Dr. Eiraj Fazel (the former head of the [[Iranian Academy of Medical Sciences]]), [[Sayyed Mohammad Beheshti]] (the former head of the [[Iranian Cultural Heritage Organization]]) and Dr. Mohammad Reza Zafarqandi (the former head of [[Tehran University of Medical Sciences]]) and many other officials, Dr. [[Maziar Ashrafian Bonab]] appointed as the head of the project and the museum.

During the first two years of the project a very beautiful historic building which dates back to the late Qajar era and located in North Amir Abad (Tehran) allocated and prepared for this museum. At the same time, several scientific research were performed by groups of researchers and scientist under supervision of Dr. [[Maziar Ashrafian Bonab]], to find, locate and collect all objects, documents, manuscripts and even art works related to the medical history of the country.

Inaugurated in September 2002 by [[Dr. Mohammad Farhadi]], [[Dr. Mohammad-Reza Zafarqandi]] and [[Sayyed Mohammad Beheshti]] and Dr. Maziar Ashrafian Bonab the museum is jointly operated by [[Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization of Iran|ICHO]] and [[Tehran University of Medical Sciences]]. Since 2002 Dr. Shams Shariate Torbaqan has been the head of the museum.

The building of the museum, and is located in [[Amir Abad]] in Tehran. The National Museum of Medical Sciences History has the following sections:

* Ancient and historic tools used in medicine
* Manuscripts and medical documents
* Iran’s famous physicians
* History of nursing and midwifery in Iran
* History of veterinary medicine in Iran
* History of dentistry in Iran
* Herbal medicine
* Traditional medicine
* Embryology

The goals of the museum are as the following:

* Developing and organizing research activities to introduce the valuable heritage of the great masters of medicine to the present and future generations,and to promote the public culture, and furnish a clear picture of the glorious past of medicine in Iran.
* Discovering, studying, collecting,repairing, and maintaining works, tools, devices, and documents related to medicine from the ancient times to the present day, and their presentation to encourage research, and study.

The term [[isomorphism]] literally means sameness (iso) of form (morphism). In [[Gestalt psychology]], Isomorphism is the idea that perception and the underlying physiological representation are similar because of related Gestalt qualities. Isomorphism refers to a correspondence between a stimulus array and the brain state created by that stimulus, and is based on the idea that the objective brain processes underlying and correlated with particular phenomenological experiences functionally have the same form and structure as those subjective experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Wertheimer|Wertheimer, M.]] 2010. Isomorphism. Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, W. (1920/1955). Die physischen Gestalten in Ruhe und im stationaren Zustand.  Abridged trans. in W.D. Ellis (Ed.), A source book of gestalt psychology. (pp. 71-88). New York: The Humanities Press. (Original work published in 1920).&lt;/ref&gt;

Isomorphism can also be described as the similarity in the gestalt patterning of a stimulus and the activity in the brain while perceiving the stimulus. More generally, this concept is an expression of the materialist view that the properties of mind and consciousness are a direct consequence of the electrochemical interactions within the physical brain.&lt;ref&gt;Lehar, S. (1999). Gestalt Isomorphism and the Quantification of Spatial Perception. Gestalt Theory, 21(2). Retrieved November 1, 2012, from http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/isomorph/isomorph.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly used example of isomorphism is the [[phi phenomenon]], in which a row of lights flashing in sequence creates the illusion of motion. It is argued that the brain state created by this stimulus matches the brain state created by a patch of light moving from one location to another. The stimulus is perceived as motion because the subjective percept of spatial structure is correlated with electric fields in the brain whose spatial pattern mirrors the spatial structure in the perceived world.&lt;ref&gt;Luchins, A. S., &amp; Luchins, E. H. (1999). Isomorphism in Gestalt Theory: Comparison of Wertheimer's and Köhler's Concepts. Gestalt Theory, 21(3).

'''Dr John Cunningham Lilly''' (January 6, 1915 – September 30, 2001) was an American physician, [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]], [[psychoanalyst]], [[Psychonautics|psychonaut]], philosopher, writer and inventor. He was a member of a generation of counterculture scientists and thinkers that included [[Ram Dass]], [[Werner Erhard]] and [[Timothy Leary]], all frequent visitors to the Lilly home. He never failed to stir controversy, especially among mainstream scientists. He gained renown in the 1950s after developing the [[isolation tank]]. He saw the tanks, in which users are isolated from almost all external stimuli, as a means to explore the nature of human consciousness. He later combined that work with his efforts to communicate with dolphins, as well as experiments with psychedelics.

&lt;blockquote&gt;During a session in an isolation tank, constructed over a pool where dolphins were swimming, I participated in a conversation between the dolphins. It drove me crazy, there was too much information, they communicated so fast.&lt;ref&gt;"Inventor Studied Dophin Communications",Washington Post, October 4, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His work inspired two Hollywood movies, "[[The Day of the Dolphin]]" and "[[Altered States]]".

He was a graduate of the California Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania medical school. He conducted high-altitude research during World War II and later trained as a psychoanalyst.

In the 1950s, he began studying how bottlenose dolphins vocalize, establishing centers in the U.S. Virgin Islands and, later, San Francisco to study dolphins. A decade later, he began experimenting with psychedelics, including LSD, often while floating in isolation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Mental Effects of Reduction of Ordinary Levels of Physical Stimuli on Intact, Healthy Persons |last=Lilly |first=John C. |work=Psychiatric Research Reports. |volume=5 |year=1956 |pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
Lilly was born to a wealthy family on January 6, 1915, in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]. His father was Richard Coyle Lilly, president of the First National Bank of St. Paul. His mother was Rachel Lenor Cunningham, whose family owned the Cunningham &amp; Haas Company, a large stockyards company in St. Paul. Lilly had an older brother, Richard Lilly Jr., and a younger brother, David Maher Lilly. A fourth child, Mary Catherine Lilly, died in infancy.

Lilly showed an interest in science at an early age. At thirteen years old, he was an avid chemistry hobbyist, supplementing his makeshift basement laboratory with chemicals given to him by a pharmacist friend. Students at his parochial Catholic grade school called him "Einstein Jr."&lt;ref name="John Lilly, so far..."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffrey|first1=Francis|title=John Lilly, so far...|date=April 19, 1989 |publisher=Jeremy P. Tarcher, Inc |location=Los Angeles, CA |isbn=0874775396 |pages=278 |edition=First}}{{rp|17}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 14 he enrolled at St. Paul Academy, a college preparatory academy for boys, where his teachers encouraged him to pursue science further and conduct his experiments in the school laboratory after hours.

While at SPA, Lilly also further developed his interest in philosophy. He studied the works of many of the great philosophers, finding himself especially attracted to the [[subjective idealism]] of Anglo-Irish theologian and philosopher [[George Berkeley]].

Despite his father's wish that he go to an eastern [[Ivy League]] university to become a banker, Lilly received a scholarship at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in [[Pasadena, California]] where he studied biology. He was the president of the ski club, a member of the drama club and lived in one of the Blacker Houses.&lt;ref&gt;http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/2256/1/1938.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; After his first year,  Caltech learned that Lilly was from a wealthy family and cancelled his scholarship, forcing him to go to his father for help. Dick Lilly set up a trust fund to pay the tuition and eventually became a benefactor of the college. Lilly continued to draw on his family wealth to fund his scientific pursuits throughout his life.

In 1934, Lilly read [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]].'' The pharmacological control methods of Huxley's dystopia and the links between physical chemical processes of the brain and subjective experiences of the mind helped inspire Lilly to give up his study of physics and pursue biology, eventually focusing on [[neurophysiology]].

Lilly was engaged to Mary Crouch at the beginning of his junior year at Caltech. Months before their wedding, he took a job with a lumber company in the Northwest to soothe a bout of "nervous exhaustion" brought on by the pressures of academia and his upcoming marriage. During this sabbatical he was hospitalised after injuring his foot with an axe while cutting brush. His time in the trauma ward inspired him to become a doctor of medicine.&lt;ref name="John Lilly, so far..."/&gt;

In 1937, while Lilly was looking for a good medical school, his wealthy and well-connected father arranged a meeting between Lilly and [[Charles Horace Mayo]] of the famous [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]]. Following Mayo's advice, Lilly applied and was accepted to [[Dartmouth Medical School]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], where he became good friends with Mayo's son, [[Charles William Mayo]]. Lilly graduated from Caltech with a Bachelor of Science degree on June 10, 1938, and enrolled at Dartmouth the following September.

At Dartmouth, Lilly launched into the study of anatomy, performing dissections on 32 cadavers during his time there. He once stretched out an entire intestinal tract across the length of a room to determine its actual length with certainty.

During the summer after his first year at Dartmouth, Lilly returned to Pasadena to participate in an experiment with his former Caltech biochemistry professor Henry Borsook. The purpose of the experiment was to study the creation of [[glycocyamine]], a major source of muscle power in the human body. The experiment involved putting Lilly on a completely protein-free diet while administering measured doses of [[glycine]] and [[arginine]], the two amino acids that Borsook hypothesized were involved in the creation of glycocyamine. The experiments pushed Lilly to extreme physical and mental limits; he became increasingly weak and delirious as the weeks went on. The results of the experiment confirmed Borsook's hypothesis and Lilly's name was included among the authors, making it the first published research paper of his career. It was also one of the first instances of a lifelong pattern of experimenting on his own body to the point of endangering his health.

After two years at Dartmouth, Lilly decided that he wanted to pursue a career in medical research, rather than therapeutic practice as was standard for Dartmouth medical students at that time. He decided to transfer to the medical school at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] which would provide him with better opportunities for conducting research.

At the University of Pennsylvania, Lilly met Professor H. Cuthbert Bazett, a protege of British physiologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]]. Bazett introduced Lilly to Haldane's view that scientists should never conduct an experiment or procedure on another person that they have not first conducted on themselves, a view Lilly embraced and attempted to exemplify throughout his career. Bazett took a liking to the young, enthusiastic graduate student, and set Lilly up with his own research laboratory. While working under Bazett, Lilly created his first invention, the electrical capacitance diaphragm manometer, a device for measuring blood pressure. While designing the instrument, he received electrical engineering advice from biophysics pioneer [[Britton Chance]]. Chance also introduced Lilly to the world of computers, which was still in its infancy.

While finishing his degree at the University of Pennsylvania, Lilly enrolled in a class entitled "How to Build an Atomic Bomb". He and several other students transcribed their notes from the class into a book with the same title. The director of the Manhattan Project, [[Leslie Groves|General Leslie Groves]], attempted to suppress publication of the book, but was unable to because no classified data was used in writing the book.

Lilly graduated with a medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1942.

==Career overview==
Lilly was a physician and [[psychoanalyst]]. He made contributions in the fields of [[biophysics]], [[neurophysiology]], [[electronics]], [[computer science]], and [[neuroanatomy]]. He invented and promoted the use of an [[isolation tank]] as a means of [[sensory deprivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Deep Self: The Tank Method of Physical Isolation |first=John C. |last=Lilly |year=1977 |location=New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also attempted [[Human–animal communication#John Lilly and cetacean communication|communication between humans and dolphins.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mentalfloss.com/article/26483/4-bizarre-experiments-should-never-be-repeated 4 Bizarre Experiments That Should Never Be Repeated : Mental_Floss]&lt;/ref&gt; His work helped the creation of the United States [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972]].

Lilly's eclectic career began as a conventional scientist doing research for universities and government. Gradually, however, he began researching unconventional topics. He published several books and had two Hollywood movies based partly on his work. He also developed theories for flotation.

Lilly published 19 books, including ''The Center of the Cyclone'', which describes his own LSD experiences, and ''Man and Dolphin'' and ''The Mind of the Dolphin'', which describe his work with dolphins.

In the 1980s Lilly directed a project that attempted to teach dolphins a computer-synthesised language. Lilly designed a future "communications laboratory" that would be a floating living room where humans and dolphins could chat as equals and develop a common language.

Lilly envisioned a time when all killing of whales and dolphins would cease, "not from a law being passed, but from each human understanding innately that these are ancient, sentient earth residents, with tremendous intelligence and enormous life force. Not someone to kill, but someone to learn from."&lt;ref&gt;John C. Lilly Dies at 86. Written as a message to visitors on John Lilly's personal website (www.johnclilly.com), and quoted in the New York Times Obituary by Andrew C. Revkin October 7, 2001. Retrieved October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1990s Lilly moved to [[Maui]], Hawaii, where he lived most of the remainder of his life.

Lilly's literary rights and scientific discoveries were owned by Human Software, Inc., while his philanthropic endeavors were owned by the Human Dolphin Foundation. The John C. Lilly Research Institute, Inc. continues to research topics of interest to Lilly and carry on his legacy.

=== Research ===
During World War II, Lilly researched the physiology of high-altitude flying and invented instruments for measuring gas pressure. After the war, he trained in psychoanalysis at the University of Pennsylvania, where he began researching the physical structures of the brain and [[consciousness]]. In 1951 he published a paper showing how he could display patterns of brain electrical activity on a cathode ray display screen using electrodes he devised specially for insertion into a living brain. Furthermore, Lilly's work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LILLY|first1=JC|author2=AUSTIN, GM; CHAMBERS, WW|title=Threshold movements produced by excitation of cerebral cortex and efferent fibers with some parametric regions of rectangular current pulses (cats and monkeys).|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=July 1952|volume=15|issue=4|pages=319–41|pmid=14955703}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[electrical stimulation]] of the nervous system gave rise to [[Biphasic pulse|biphasic]] [[Charge (physics)|charge]] balanced [[electrical stimulation]] pulses (later known as "Lilly's wave" or "Lilly's pulses"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Donaldson|first1=ND|author2=Donaldson, PE|title=When are actively balanced biphasic ('Lilly') stimulating pulses necessary in a neurological prosthesis?

=== Development of the sensory deprivation tank ===
[[Image:Ginsberg-leary-lilly.jpg|thumb|right|[[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Timothy Leary]], and John C. Lilly in 1991 ]]
In 1953, Lilly began a job studying [[neurophysiology]] with the US Public Health Service Commissioned Officers Corps. At the [[National Institute of Mental Health|N.I.M.H.]] in 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Black|first=David|date=December 10, 1979|title=Lie down in darkness|journal=New York Magazine|volume=12|issue=48|pages=60|issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gelb (2007), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lilly|first=John Cunningham |title=The Scientist: A Novel Autobiography|publisher=Lippincott; 1st edition |year=1978|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Streatfeild|first=Dominic |title=Brainwash: The Secret History of Mind Control|publisher=Macmillan|year=2008|edition=reprint|pages=116|isbn=0-312-42792-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of isolating a brain from external stimulation, he devised the first [[isolation tank]], a dark soundproof tank of warm salt water in which subjects could float for long periods in sensory isolation. Lilly and a research colleague were the first subjects of this research. What had been known as perceptual isolation or sensory deprivation was reconceptualized as Restricted Environmental Stimulation Technique (R.E.S.T.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baruss|first=Imants|title=Alterations of Consciousness|year=2003|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lilly later studied other large-brained mammals and during the late 1950s he established a facility devoted to fostering human-dolphin communication: the Communication Research Institute on St. Thomas in the [[Virgin Islands]]. During the early 1960s, Lilly and coworkers published several papers reporting that dolphins could mimic human speech patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Vocal Behavior of the Bottlenose Dolphin |first=J. C. |last=Lilly |work=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Vocal Exchanges between Dolphins |first1=J. C. |last1=Lilly |first2=A. M. |last2=Miller |work=Science |year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== S.E.T.I. ===
Lilly was interested in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ([[SETI]]) project. In 1961 a group of scientists including Lilly gathered at the [[Green Bank Telescope|Green Bank Observatory]] to discuss the possibility of using the techniques of radio astronomy to detect evidence of intelligent life outside the solar system. They called themselves ''The Order of the Dolphin'' after Lilly's work with dolphins. They discussed the [[Drake equation]], used to estimate the number of communicative civilizations in our galaxy.&lt;ref name="Astrobiology Magazine"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.astrobio.net/alien-life/the-drake-equation-revisited-part-i/ | title=The Drake Equation Revisited: Part I | work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] | date=Sep 29, 2003 | accessdate=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exploration of human consciousness ===
In the early 1960s, Lilly was introduced to [[psychedelic drug]]s such as [[LSD]] and (later) [[ketamine]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/the-ketamine-secrets-of-segas-ecco-the-dolphin-347 /the-ketamine-secrets-of-segas-ecco-the-dolphin]&lt;/ref&gt; and began a series of experiments in which he ingested a psychedelic drug either in an isolation tank or in the company of dolphins. These events are described in his books ''Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer: Theory and Experiments'' and ''The Center of the Cyclone'', both published in 1972. Following advice from [[Ram Dass]], Lilly studied [[Patanjali]]'s system of [[yoga]] (finding [[I. K. Taimni]]'s ''Science of Yoga'', a modernized interpretation of the [[Sanskrit]] text, most suited to his goals). He also paid special attention to [[self-enquiry]] meditation advocated by [[Ramana Maharshi]], and reformulated the principles of this exercise with reference to his [[human biocomputer]] paradigm (described in ''Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer: Theory and Experiments'' and ''The Center of the Cyclone'').

Lilly later traveled to [[Chile]] and trained with the spiritual leader [[Oscar Ichazo]] (whose attitude to metaphysical consciousness exploration Lilly characterized as "empirical" in his book ''The Center of the Cyclone''). Lilly claimed to have achieved the maximum degree of [[satori]]-[[samādhi]] consciousness during his training.

Lilly's maxim: "In the province of the mind what one believes to be true, either is true or becomes true within certain limits. These limits are to be found experimentally and experientially. When so found these limits turn out to be further beliefs to be transcended. In the province of the mind there are no limits. However, in the province of the body there are definite limits not to be transcended."&lt;ref&gt;John C Lilly – ''The Human Biocomputer'' (1974) {{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solid State Intelligence===
Solid State Intelligence (S.S.I.) is a malevolent entity described by Lilly (see ''The Scientist''). According to Lilly, the network of computation-capable [[solid|solid state]] systems ([[electronics]]) engineered by humans will eventually develop (or has already developed) into an autonomous bioform. Since the optimal [[Survival of the fittest|survival]] conditions for this bioform (low-temperature [[vacuum]]) are drastically different from those humans need (room temperature aerial atmosphere and adequate water supply), Lilly predicted (or "prophesied", based on his [[ketamine]]-induced visions) a dramatic conflict between the two forms of intelligence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Earth Coincidence Control Office (E.C.C.O.)===
In 1974, Lilly's research using various [[psychoactive drugs]] led him to believe in the existence of a certain hierarchical group of [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings|cosmic entities]], the lowest of which he later dubbed Earth Coincidence Control Office (E.C.C.O.) in an autobiography published jointly with his wife Antonietta (often called Toni). To elaborate, "There exists a Cosmic Coincidence Control Center (CCCC) with a Galactic substation called Galactic Coincidence Control (GCC). Within GCC is the Solar System Control Unit (SSCU), within which is the Earth Coincidence Control Office (ECCO)."&lt;ref&gt;John C. Lilly ''The Dyadic Cyclone: The autobiography of a couple. with Antonietta Lilly (1st ed.). Simon and Schuster.'' (1976) p20&lt;/ref&gt;

Lilly also wrote that there are nine conditions that should be followed by people who seek to experience coincidence in their own lives:

# You must know/assume/simulate our existence in E.C.C.O.
# You must be willing to accept our responsibility for control of your coincidences.
# You must exert your best capabilities for your survival programs and your own development as an advancing/advanced member of E.C.C.O.'s earthside corps of controlled coincidence workers. You are expected to use your best intelligence in this service.
# You are expected to expect the unexpected every minute, every hour of every day and of every night.
# You must be able to maintain conscious/thinking/reasoning no matter what events we arrange to happen to you. Some of these events will seem cataclysmic/catastrophic/overwhelming: remember stay aware, no matter what happens/apparently happens to you.
# You are in our training program for life: there is no escape from it. We (not you) control the long-term coincidences; you (not we) control the shorter-term coincidences by your own efforts.
# Your major mission on earth is to discover/create that which we do to control the long-term coincidence patterns: you are being trained on Earth to do this job.
# When your mission on planet Earth is completed, you will no longer be required to remain/return there.
# Remember the motto passed to us (from G.C.C. via S.S.C.U.): ''"Cosmic Love is absolutely Ruthless and Highly Indifferent: it teaches its lessons whether you like/dislike them or not."''&lt;ref&gt;John C. Lilly ''The Dyadic Cyclone: The autobiography of a couple. with Antonietta Lilly (1st ed.). Simon and Schuster.'' (1976) p20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Lilly died of heart failure at age 86 in Los Angeles on September 30, 2001. His remains were [[cremated]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/695/000173176/ John C.

==In popular culture==
Lilly's work with dolphins and the development of the sensory deprivation tank have been referenced in movies, music and television productions. ''[[Dolphin Island (novel)|Dolphin Island: A Story of the People of the Sea]]'' is a 1963 novel by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] set in a strange and fascinating research community where a brilliant professor tries to communicate with dolphins. In the 1972 novel ''[[The Listeners (novel)|The Listeners]]'', Lilly and the other scientists who were members of the ''[[Order of the Dolphin]]'' are mentioned as pioneers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Gunn | first = James E. | title = The Listeners | publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons p. 58 | year = 1972 | location = New York | pages = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1973 movie ''[[The Day of the Dolphin]]'', [[George C. Scott]] portrayed a Lilly-esque scientist, known to the dolphins as "Pa", who succeeds in teaching a dolphin to speak elementary English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=980DEEDF1039E73ABC4851DFB4678388669EDE |title=''The Day of the Dolphin'' (1973) Film: Underwater Talkie: Scott Stars in Nichols's 'Day of the Dolphin' The Cast |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 20, 1973 |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980 movie ''[[Altered States]]'', based on [[Paddy Chayefsky]]'s novel of the same name, features actor [[William Hurt]] regressing to a simian form by ingesting [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|psychoactive substances]] and then experiencing the effects of prolonged occupation of a sensory deprivation chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19800101/REVIEWS/1010302/1023 |title=Altered States |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=January 1, 1980 |accessdate=March 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hooper |first=Judith |title=John Lilly: Altered States |work=[[Omni Magazine]] |date=January 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=David E. |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7119/is_200803/ai_n32264929/ |title=Head Trip |work=[[American Cinematographer]] |date=March 2008 |accessdate=March 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110212808/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7119/is_200803/ai_n32264929/ |archivedate=November 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1992 [[Sega]] [[video game]] ''[[Ecco the Dolphin]]'', the player guides an intelligent dolphin through increasingly surreal psychedelic challenges. The game's producer, [[Ed Annunziata]], has confirmed being an avid reader of Lilly's works.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/cavernsofhope/posts/519280751425243%20So&lt;/ref&gt;

Layer 09 of the 1998 Japanese animation series ''[[Serial Experiments Lain]]'' makes reference to E.C.C.O. and Lilly's work with dolphins. The episode deals with the development of Protocol 7, a modification of The Wired, which is expected to network all humans without need of a device. The result will be that Earth's consciousness will awaken as people become linked nodes in The Wired network. This is compared to Lilly's view that dolphin communication is a form of long-distance networking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/serial-experiments-lain/protocol-layer-09-231784 |title=tv.com Protocol – Layer 9 | accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oysterhead]]'s 2001 album, ''[[The Grand Pecking Order]]'', includes the song "Oz is Ever Floating", which includes numerous references to Lilly.

In the popular TV series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', brilliant but unstable scientist [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter Bishop]] develops a method for contacting dead relations by using ketamine and LSD-25 inside a deprivation tank.

== Balconing ==

Segura-Sampedro and his team first described the [[balconing]] phenomenon in 2017 and published their data in a paper entitled "Balconing: An alcohol-induced craze that injures tourists. Characterization of the phenomenon." in the journal [[Injury (journal)|Injury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Segura-Sampedro|first=Juan José|last2=Pineño-Flores|first2=Cristina|last3=García-Pérez|first3=Jose María|last4=Jiménez-Morillas|first4=Patricia|last5=Morales-Soriano|first5=Rafael|last6=González-Argente|first6=Xavier|date=July 2017|title=Balconing: An alcohol-induced craze that injures tourists.

He also pointed out that Irish and British were the most likely to suffer this kind of trauma, triggering different campaigns against alcohol during holidays&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.es/20180723/dangerous-craze-surgeon-warns-on-balcony-jumping-trauma-in-balearic-islands|title=Dangerous craze: surgeon warns on balcony-jumping trauma in Balearic Islands|date=2018-07-23|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and close to balconies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/booze-and-balconies-don-t-mix|title=Booze and Balconies Don’t Mix|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Ireland, United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/3342546/0/doctor-segura-campana-balconing-reino-unido-chicos-sanos-destrozan-vida/|title=El doctor Segura impulsa una campaña contra el 'balconing' en Reino Unido: "Son chicos sanos que destrozan su vida"|last=20Minutos|work=20minutos.es - Últimas Noticias|access-date=2018-11-17|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/spanish-authorities-struggle-to-counter-balconing-trend-1.3589068|title=Spanish authorities struggle to counter ‘balconing’ trend|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the paper results, a preventive campaign was developed in collaboration with the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign office]] where Segura-Sampedro talked to the British youth on how to avoid injuries and not to be a victim of this phenomenon. After this, Segura-Sampedro also participated in similar campaigns in the Irish [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Watch The dangers of 'balconing' {{!}} Prime Time  online|url=https://www.rte.ie/player/es/show/prime-time-extras-30003379/10899062/|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the British [[BBC]], where he explained the [[balconing]] phenomenon, and the consequences after it at the [[Victoria Derbyshire (TV programme)|Victoria Derbyshire]] show&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bbc72z/victoria-derbyshire-16072018|title=Victoria Derbyshire - 16/07/2018|work=BBC iPlayer|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main discoveries of Segura-Sampedro et al. findings regarding [[balconing]] where the subset of population who suffers it, male tourists from northern [[Europe]], and its relation with [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] and [[substance abuse]]. These findings have conducted [[Balearic Islands|Balearic]] authorities towards new policies to control [[alcohol consumption]] as they look for reducing the spate of accidents. The Balearic government is concerned that “all-in” package holidays, might encourage [[Alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]] and antisocial dangerous behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/spanish-authorities-struggle-to-counter-balconing-trend-1.3589068|title=Spanish authorities struggle to counter ‘balconing’ trend|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="72268">This is a '''list of fatal, unprovoked [[shark attack]]s that occurred in United States''' territorial waters by decade in reverse chronological order.
A &lt;span style="background-color:#ffcccc"&gt;pink&lt;/span&gt; background indicates that the greater weight of the evidence suggests that this victim died from a cause of death other than a shark attack; however, at least one source at some point in time has identified shark attack as the cause of death.

| Joseph Troy, Jr., 16 || July 25, 1936 || Great white shark || Attacked while swimming at HollyWoods Beach, [[Mattapoisett, Massachusetts]], As he swam in the waters off the beach, Joseph Troy Jr., 16, a summer visitor from Dorchester, was grabbed and bitten by a 6-foot shark and dragged underwater less than 50 yards from shore.

The badly injured youth was rushed to St. Luke's Hospital in New Bedford. He died on the operating table that night while surgeons were amputating his left leg.
The boy, along with a family friend, had been swimming out from the beach to meet the Black Cat, a catboat that had just picked up its mooring after a morning sail, when the shark attacked, Smith said.

The Black Cat's owner, Hubert Fisher, jumped into his dinghy and, with the help of the other swimmer, Walter Stiles of Boston, got the boy aboard and took him to the beach.

Using an old wooden door as a stretcher, neighbors carried the badly injured teen to a car and he was rushed to the hospital. The wind had been from the southeast the day before the attack, he said, a condition that roils the bottom and results in poor visibility. That could have been a critical factor, producing an instinctive reaction from the shark when it saw the flash of a swimmer's white leg, Smith said he believes.

The Standard-Times report of the incident said Joseph Troy was still conscious when he was wheeled into the operating room for the amputation.

The attending surgeon, Dr. E.D. Gardner, said the boy told him he was horrified not so much by the bite as the thought of being dragged down while in the grip of the shark.

In the aftermath of the attack, beaches around Buzzards Bay were deserted and swimming came to a halt along much of the Massachusetts coast, the newspaper reported.

Although the attack was without precedent, sharks had previously been observed in Buzzards Bay. Just a week earlier, a 6-foot shark had been caught in Marion harbor.

=== Shift work ===
{{main|Shift work}} 
Those who work the night shift are known to be at increased risk of insomnia, general morbidity, and all cause mortality.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;  Studies of casino shift workers have found increased emotional and behavioral problems in their children as well as six time higher rate of divorce in men with children who have been married less than 5 years.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Presser|first=Harriet B.|date=February 2000|title=Nonstandard Work Schedules and Marital Instability|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00093.x|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|language=en|volume=62|issue=1|pages=93–110|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00093.x|issn=0022-2445}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Women with children were also three times more likely to get divorced while performing shift work at casinos.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  However, there was no increased rate of divorce in couples without children who performed shift work at casinos.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;   Employers should try to minimize this risk by keeping each worker on a consistent shift, rather than rotating them between days and nights.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;  If shift rotation must occur, it is better to rotate employees forward from day into evening shifts.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

=== Slips, trips and falls ===
According to the United States Bureau of Labor and Statistics, slip, trips, and falls were the leading cause of days away from work (DAFW) in 2017 causing 20,000 workers to miss one or more days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/osh_11082018.htm|title=Employer-Reported Workplace Injuries and Illnesses (Annual) News Release|website=bls.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While only 1 in 6 slips and falls will result in missed days of work, those who do miss work are often absent for a lengthy period (11 days on average).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Burns ===
In casinos, these most commonly occur in preparation or delivery of foods, beverages, or oils since liquid or steam at only 155° Fahrenheit can burn or scald the skin.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  These burns can often be avoided with special precautions taken when cleaning deep fryers or pressure cookers.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  If possible full containers of liquids should not be carried as they can spill, especially on slippery or cluttered floors.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Assault and battery ===
Emotions can run high during gambling and this combined with alcohol which is often provided for free while playing can lead patrons to become aggressive and agitated toward the staff or other players.&lt;ref name="hoffmannworkcomp.com" /&gt;  Casinos also frequently have large amounts of money present increasing the possibility of a robbery that can put an employee in a dangerous situation.&lt;ref name="hoffmannworkcomp.com" /&gt;  Since there may be blood after a fight,  employees should be trained how to take appropriate measures to protect against blood born pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oshageneralindustry.com/the-osha-general-industry-casino-rules-and-regulations/|title=The OSHA General Industry Casino Rules and Regulations – OSHA General Industry|website=oshageneralindustry.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gambling addictions ===
{{main|Problem gambling}}
Casino employees are known to be at higher risk for gambling problems than the average person.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;  Employers should offer education as a preventative strategy as well as treatment for employees who become addicted.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;  Casino managers can protect their employees and patrons by tracking and excluding gambling addicts as well as limiting the amount one can lose in any 24 hour period.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

=== Alcoholism ===
{{main|Alcoholism}}
Casino employees are known to be at higher risk for alcohol problems than the average person.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;  Employers should offer education as a preventative strategy as well as treatment for employees who become addicted to alcohol.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

=== Depression ===

Casino employees are known to be at higher risk for depression than the average person.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;  Employers should offer education as a preventative strategy as well as treatment for employees who develop depression.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

=== Metal dust from coin counting ===
In 2000, NIOSH was asked to evaluate a casino for metal dust after employees reported eye, nose, and airway irritation that they thought might be related to the process used to count metal coins.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/reports/pdfs/2001-0109-2835.pdf|title=Health Hazard Evaluation Report 20010109 Lac Vieux Desert Resort and Casino Watersmeet, Michigan|last=Kiefer|first=Max|date=March 2001|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NIOSH evaluated the air and employees for nickel, copper, and zinc because these metals make up the vast majority of modern US coins.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  All levels were below the NIOSH [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL), specifically nickel was 7 μg/m3 (REL 15 μg/m3), copper was 24 μg/m3 (REL 1,000 μg/m3), and zinc was below the limit of detection (REL 5,000 μg/m3).&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

== Best practices to prevent harm ==

=== Card dealers ===
Musculoskeletal injury (MSI) is a common way dealers can be injured performing their routine duties.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Ergonomics tries to prevent these injuries by "fitting the job to the worker."&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  This involves educating workers about how best to safely perform their job and prevent injury as much as it does providing them with any special or protective equipment.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  The human body is less vulnerable to injury when in a neutral posture.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Beware that your risks of overuse injury increase when there are fewer players at the table as the variation in your body motions decrease.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Stretching frequently or shifting your position during breaks in the game will decrease static posture.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; It is worth noting that dealing different card games poses different risks: for example black jack dealers deal more cards per shift than baccarat dealers.&lt;ref name=":103"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kialidster.weebly.com/uploads/2/6/3/6/26364996/worksite_evaluation_-_casino_table_games_dealer.pdf|title=SPPH 565 Worksite Evaluation Casino Table Games Dealers|last=Lidster|first=Kia|date=November 29, 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, a safety determination for one game does not assure a similar safety profile in other similar games.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt;  Rotation of dealers between different tables allows workers to engage different muscle groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/diseases/rmirsi.html|title=(none)|last=Safety|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and|website=ccohs.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common postures that put dealers at risk are listed below along with how best to minimize the risk of harm:[[File:Card_Dealing_Ergonomics.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Card_Dealing_Ergonomics.jpg|thumb|This image shows proper wrist position when dealing cards.  Dealers should keep their wrist straight and deal cards by moving only the middle and index fingers.]]

==== Dealing cards ====
Minimize bending your wrist by flicking the cards forward using your index and middle fingers.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Keep your wrists straight (do not flex or bend them). Turn to face your players or use your peripheral vision, rather than turning your head which can strain your neck.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt;

==== Retrieving cards from the shoe ====
The cards and shoe should be at or just below elbow height and adjusted so that you can keep your elbows close to your body and do not have to move your elbows out to the side to deal or shuffle.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Position the shoe so that you can use it comfortably with players in your line of sight without twisting your back, wrists, or hands.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Alternatively, a shoe below the table allows the dealer to rest their hands on a flat surface.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt;  Keeping your joints in as straight a line as possible will decrease overuse injuries.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;
[[File:Standing_Dealing_Collecting_Cards_Ergonomics.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Standing_Dealing_Collecting_Cards_Ergonomics.jpg|thumb|This picture illustrates how to reduce back strain by using a footrest under the table while dealing or reaching to collect cards after a hand is finished.]]

==== Reaching forward to collect cards or bets while standing ====
Your waist should be even with the height of the table.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; An adjustable height step box for dealers is more appropriate than an adjustable height table, which could put patrons at risk of an awkward posture.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt;  Alternatively, patrons could be provided with chairs that adjust in height.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt;  If possible, use a step/footrest under the table to allow you to lean forward onto the elevated leg as you reach forward.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  A step/footrest also allows you to change your posture regularly to avoid becoming static.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  If cards are beyond your reach, ask players to slide them toward you.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Standing tends to decrease static posture and relieve joint pain throughout the body.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/books-guides/ergonomic-tips-for-the-hospitality-industry/preventing-injuries-to-casino-card-dealers?lang=en&amp;origin=s&amp;returnurl=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/search#q=casino&amp;sort=relevancy&amp;f:language-facet=%5BEnglish%5D|title=WorkSafeBC|website=worksafebc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, standing also increases pressure on your feet.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Therefore, it is a good idea for employers to allow employees to wear supportive footwear.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

==== Reaching forward to collect cards or bets while seated ====
Adjust the chair such that it supports your lower back and your feet are supported with your knees flexed to 90 degrees.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Use a chair that swivels to turn and face the player with whom you are interacting.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;[[File:Seated_Dealing_Cards_Ergonomics.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seated_Dealing_Cards_Ergonomics.jpg|thumb|This picture shows a seated dealer. Note that the head is in a neutral position with the viewing distance 18-24 inches (depending on the person's focal length) and comfortable viewing angle. The dealer's feet are flat on the floor with knees and hips at approximately 90 degrees. This table is too high, which is why the dealer's hands are not resting on it. If they were, then the edge of the table should be padded to provide support to the dealer. Alternatively, the dealer's seat could be raised and a footrest should be used if the dealers feed to not comfortably reach the floor.]]&lt;br /&gt;

=== Croupier ===
Make sure commonly used items are within comfortable reach.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; When handing out or retrieving bets move along the length of the table so that you don't have to twist or reach.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Using your arm to start the wheel spinning and use a "snap" technique to spin the ball in the opposite direction, rather than your wrist.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

=== Bellhops and luggage handlers ===
If work involves lifting or moving objects, then employees should be trained in safe manual handling procedures.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/books-guides/ergonomic-tips-for-the-hospitality-industry/preventing-injuries-when-handling-luggage?lang=en&amp;origin=s&amp;returnurl=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/search#q=Preventing%2520injuries%2520when%2520handling%2520luggage&amp;sort=relevancy&amp;f:language-facet=%5BEnglish%5D|title=WorkSafeBC|website=worksafebc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Be careful to avoid awkward postures when loading or unloading luggage by having your feet facing the luggage and firmly planted on the ground.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  It is important to shorten the distance between you and the luggage by pulling it toward you or moving toward it because the further the weight is from your body, the more strain you put on your back.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Although you may not feel pain while performing the movement, you can still put your joints at risk by lifting luggage awkwardly, especially if it is heavy.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;     Use a luggage cart whenever the luggage does not have wheels or when moving more than 2 bags.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  When loading a luggage cart, attempt to store larger bags upright and on the bottom and medium bags at waist height and on top.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  As often as possible, avoid loading any bags higher than your shoulders as our ability to lift safely decreases substantially at this height.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  Loading the cart in this manner will also allow you to push, rather than pull the cart and will keep your field of vision clear.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  Pushing will protect your back and upper extremity from injury.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  Remember to use both hands touching the cart slightly below elbow level and generate power to push from your legs.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;   If your luggage cart is not functioning properly due to misaligned or malfunctioning wheels, request it be serviced because a malfunctioning cart can lead to awkward forces being applied to your body.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

=== Housekeepers and room attendants ===
It is important to make sure that you can see where you are going.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/books-guides/ergonomic-tips-for-the-hospitality-industry/preventing-injuries-to-room-attendants?lang=en&amp;origin=s&amp;returnurl=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/search#q=Preventing%2520injuries%2520to%2520Room%2520attendants&amp;sort=relevancy&amp;f:language-facet=%5BEnglish%5D|title=WorkSafeBC|website=worksafebc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Push your service cart with both hands just below shoulder level, rather than pulling it behind you.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  If your cart is not functioning properly due to misaligned or malfunctioning wheels, request it be serviced because a malfunctioning cart can lead to awkward forces being applied to your body.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  Use both arms to vary and lessen the load on either arm when doing tasks such as scrubbing, folding, vacuuming, and making beds.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  Employers should allow employees to wear comfortable shoes to reduce strain on their back and knees.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  If your work requires you to kneel, cushion your knees with a mat, towel, or knee pads.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  Maintain a straight back when making a bed by dropping to one knee to tuck in sheets, rather than bending your back.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  When changing duvets or pillows, turn the covers inside out to change them, rather than stuffing them back inside.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  This will reduce the force applied to your arm.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;   Use a tool with a long handle or a step stool to clean hard or awkward to reach places like bathtubs and mirrors that extend above your head.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  When cleaning the shower or tub, stand inside to make it easier to reach.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  To avoid falling, never stand on the toilet or edge of the tub as it can be slippery.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Housekeepers are often expected to clean biological material (blood, vomit, excrement) and if so, workers should receive proper training and protective equipment.&lt;ref name=":132"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.uci.edu/academics/real-life-learning/clinics/pdfs/Banking-on-Unsafe-Working-Conditions-05-17-16.pdf|title=Banking on Unsafe Working Conditions Placing Profits Before Protection of Casino &amp; Hotel Workers’ Human Rights in Deutsche Bank's U.S. Supply Chain|last=Marouf|first=Fatma|date=May 17, 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Housekeepers need to be alert to possible abuse by guests and casino managers need to have a plan in place to keep workers safe from guests.&lt;ref name=":132" /&gt;

=== Front desk staff ===
If standing for a prolonged period of time use anti-fatigue matting under your feet to provide cushioning or stand with one foot elevated to shift your weight periodically from side to side (see illustration above for card dealers).&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/books-guides/ergonomic-tips-for-the-hospitality-industry/preventing-injuries-to-front-desk-agents?lang=en&amp;origin=s&amp;returnurl=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/search#q=Preventing%2520injuries%2520to%2520Front%2520desk%2520agents&amp;sort=relevancy&amp;f:language-facet=%5BEnglish%5D|title=WorkSafeBC|website=worksafebc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Employers should allow employees to wear comfortable shoes that provide them with enough cushioning.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;  If you are too short to comfortably see and reach over the desk, ask for a platform to stand on or an adjustable chair with a footrest that your legs can reach.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;  Make sure that frequently used items are within easy reach and in your line of sight that avoids twisting you back or rotating your neck.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;  The telephone and computer require continuous attention to this recommendation.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;  A goal is to have your computer monitor at or just below eye level and your keyboard just below or even with elbow height.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;  Do not hold the phone by pinching the telephone between your ear and shoulder, but rather hold it or ask for a lightweight headset to prevent developing neck pain.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

=== Hosts, servers and attendants ===
[[File:Serving_Ergonomics.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Serving_Ergonomics.jpg|thumb|This photo emphasizes proper wrist position for servers to avoid musculoskeletal injury.&amp;nbsp; The first pictures shows the serving tray resting on both the hand and forearm to share the weight.&amp;nbsp; The elbow is bent to 90 degrees and the tray is kept close to the body.&amp;nbsp; The second picture shows the wrist flexed awkwardly which can cause injury and the tray above the shoulder which increases the height to which it must be lifted.&amp;nbsp; The final picture shows the tray resting on the fingertips which decreases the surface carrying the load and can strain the smaller muscles of the hand. &amp;nbsp;]]Move toward the customer or around the table if possible to refill drinks or remove plates so as to avoid straining to reach.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/books-guides/ergonomic-tips-for-the-hospitality-industry/preventing-injuries-to-servers?lang=en|title=WorkSafeBC|website=worksafebc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  You are at higher risk when the pitcher or plate are full as they are heavier and your arm is outstretched moving the weight away from your body.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;  Employers should allow employees to wear comfortable shoes to reduce strain on their back and knees which can lead to injury over time.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;  Trays should be carried with the arm in a neutral position, which is typically with your elbow bent to 90° and the palm of your hand facing upward as close to the body as possible.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;  To bring the weight of the tray closer to your body carry the weight on both your forearm and hand, rather than just your hand alone.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;  Avoid awkward positions that can strain your body such as carrying the tray on your finger tips or above your shoulder.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;  To avoid awkward positions or straining muscles unnecessarily, place heavy items close to the center of the tray or closer to your body such that they are over your forearm.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3015">'''Oocyte selection''' is a procedure that is performed prior to [[in vitro fertilization]], in order to use [[oocytes]] with maximal chances of resulting in pregnancy. In contrast, [[embryo selection]] takes place ''after'' fertilization.

==Techniques==
Chromosomal evaluation may be performed. Embryos from rescued in vitro-matured [[metaphase II]] (IVM-MII) oocytes show significantly higher fertilization rates and more blastomeres per embryo compared with those from arrested [[metaphase I]] (MI) oocytes (58.5% vs. 43.9% and 5.7 vs. 5.0, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Strassburger D, Goldstein A, Friedler S, etal |title=The cytogenetic constitution of embryos derived from immature (metaphase I) oocytes obtained after ovarian hyperstimulation |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 94|issue= 3|pages= 971–978|date=June 2009 |pmid=19505687 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.04.035 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, morphological features of the oocyte that can be obtained by standard [[light microscopy|light]] or [[polarized light microscopy]]. However, there is no clear tendency in recent publications to a general increase in predictive value of morphological features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq029| last1 = Rienzi | first1 = L. | last2 = Vajta | first2 = G. | last3 = Ubaldi | first3 = F. | title = Predictive value of oocyte morphology in human IVF: a systematic review of the literature | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–45 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20639518 | pmc = 3001337}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested techniques include ''[[zona pellucida]] imaging'', which can detect differences in [[birefringence]] between eggs, which is a predictor of [[embryo compaction|compaction]], [[blastulation]] and pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ebner T, Balaban B, Moser M, etal |title=Automatic user-independent zona pellucida imaging at the oocyte stage allows for the prediction of preimplantation development |journal=Fertil.

Potentially, [[polar body biopsy]] may be used for molecular analysis, and can be used for [[preimplantation genetic screening]].&lt;ref name="JiaoWoodruff2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiao|first1=Ze-Xu|last2=[[Teresa Woodruff|Woodruff]]|first2=Teresa K.|title=Detection and quantification of maternal-effect gene transcripts in mouse second polar bodies: potential markers of embryo developmental competence|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=99|issue=7|year=2013|pages=2055–2061|issn=0015-0282|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.02.003|pmid=23465709|pmc=3672332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4056">'''Pepero Day''' is held annually on [[November 11]], and is an observance in [[South Korea]] similar to [[Valentine's Day]]. It involves the gifting or exchange of [[Pepero]] snacks, a line of [[chocolate]]-dipped [[cookie]] sticks, with the intention of displaying affection for friends and loved ones. It is held on this day due to the resemblance of Pepero sticks, which are vertical that mirror the shortened date of 11/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2014/11/511_167943.html|title=Pepero Day: Eight things you should know|date=2014-11-11|work=koreatimes|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the story, two female [[middle school]] students in the [[Yeongnam]] region exchanged Pepero wishing that they would both become tall and thin.&lt;ref name="Dict Day"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=68928&amp;cid=386&amp;categoryId=386 |script-title=ko:빼빼로데이 |publisher=Parkmungak |accessdate=November 11, 2013 |language=Korean |trans-title=Pepero Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is some doubt about this story.&lt;ref name="DJC Day"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gale |first=Alastair |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/11/11/on-pepero-day-a-japanese-rival-lurks/ |title=On Pepero Day, a Japanese Rival Lurks |work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company |subscription=yes |date=November 11, 2013 |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the origin was due to the shape of 1’s in the date (November 11 – 11/11) resembling Pepero sticks,&lt;ref name="About Day" /&gt; while some others attribute the similarity of shapes as factors that attributed to the popularity but not its origin.&lt;ref name="Dict Day" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DJC Day" /&gt;

The fad spread with the idea that, for maximum effectiveness for height and thinness, one must eat 11 packets of Pepero on November 11, 11:11am and 11:11pm  at 11 seconds exactly. From 1997, [[Lotte (conglomerate)|Lotte]] started to use the aforementioned school story to successfully promote Pepero Day. The trend led to other companies creating similarly shaped snacks to participate on Pepero Day.&lt;ref name="Dict Day" /&gt; {{As of|2012}}, [[Lotte (conglomerate)|Lotte]] was making 50% of its annual sales on Pepero Day.&lt;ref name="DJC Day" /&gt; {{As of|2013}}, several [[department store]]s including [[Hyundai Department Store]], [[Shinsegae]], and [[Lotte Department Store]] were benefiting for people celebrating the day while stores such as [[E-mart]] and [[Homeplus]] were specially displaying and selling peperos on the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.sportsseoul.com/read/economy/1268607.htm |title= [SS현장] '빼빼로 데이' 일부 소비자 "과소비 조장"…롯데마트 "안 사면 그만" |publisher=Sportsseoul.com |date=November 11, 2013 |language=Korean |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111232204/http://news.sportsseoul.com/read/economy/1268607.htm |archivedate=2013-11-11 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Pepero Day has been criticized for being a business tool of certain [[company|companies]] and for having high [[calorie]]s which is contradictory to its original meaning. Alternatives include "Garaetteok Day", which promotes Farmer’s Day through exchanges of [[garaetteok]] (sticks of white [[tteok]]).&lt;ref name="Dict Day" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6435">'''Ruth Clifford Engs''' is Professor Emeritus, Applied Health Science, [[Indiana University]], Bloomington, IN. Since the mid-1990s she has been engaged in research on [[social movements]] related to health and public health issues with a focus on the  [[Progressive Era]].

==Early years==

Although born in Pennsylvania,  Engs spent her formative years in the small town of [[Bethel, Vermont]]. She went through the local schools until her junior year in high school when she went to [[Cushing Academy]], [[Ashburnham, Massachusetts]] Upon graduation in 1957 she entered the [[University of Vermont]] and graduated in 1961 with a B.A. in Liberal Arts (chemistry major and minors in biology and English literature).

After college graduation she worked as the laboratory assistant in the Bacteriology Department of [[Harvard Medical School]] for two years. Deciding she did not like “bench research” and having the wanderlust, in the fall of 1963 she traveled to Australia on a freighter and returned a year later to [[San Francisco]].  She had noticed on her travels that registered nurses were able to get jobs anywhere, so she entered a two-year nursing program. In the mid-1960s she married her first husband, Bill Engs, whom she had met on a backpacking trip.

After living in the Bay Area for five years, they went to [[Eugene, Oregon]] for graduate work. Although she like nursing she found she liked teaching better. At the [[University of Oregon]] she completed two master's degrees:  counseling psychology and health education. After graduation and a divorce, she taught health education and nursing courses at [[Dalhousie University]], Halifax, Nova Scotia for a year. While there with the help of medical and nursing students, she organized the “Med-Aid Station,” a street clinic, for the many youth who were coming to Canada during this era. Realizing the need for a doctorate, she went to, and graduated from, the [[University of Tennessee]]. For her dissertation she studied the “Personality traits and the health knowledge of telephone crisis intervention volunteers in the state of Tennessee.”

When she graduated from Tennessee, she started working as an assistant professor in the Department of Applied Health Science, Indiana University. She was tenured and promoted to associate and then full professor. She  retired from teaching in 2003. During most of her first twenty years, Professor Engs explored factors for the determinants of behavior focusing upon university student drinking. This focus on alcohol originated from an invitation by the Dean of Student’s Office to develop an alcohol education program. She and her committee organized and produced the film Booz and Yous (1975) and ten years later Drinking and Thinking. She also designed and tested the '''Student Alcohol Questionnaire''' that is now used by hundreds of students and researchers each year around the world.

During her first 20 years she published numerous papers on various aspects of college student drinking practices in the United States and many other countries. Her co-author for many was [[David J. Hanson]], SUNY, Potsdam. She also published several textbooks including '''Responsible Drug and Alcohol Use''' (1979), '''Alcohol and Other Drugs: Self Responsibility''' (1987), and with Molly Wantz '''Teaching Health Education in the Elementary School''' (1978). She was editor for '''Controversies in the Addiction Field '''(1990) and '''Women: Alcohol and Other Drugs''' (1989). During the 1980s and early 1990s she was active on the board of directors of several national organization.

==Later years==

By the early-1990s Engs’ research on the determinants of drinking and health behaviors led to a different vein of research. Taking a more global look, she investigated the origins of drinking attitude and behaviors from antiquity. The resulting article was featured in ''Archeology'' (October 1997). In the United States she discovered that anti-alcohol and pro-health  campaigns with moral undertones had come in cycles. This led to '''Clean Lean Living Movement: American Cycles of Health Reform''' (2000) which was featured in the ''New York Times Science Book Section''. Her next book was  '''The Progressive Era Health Reform Movement: A Historical Dictionary''' (2003), followed by '''The Eugenics Movement: An Encyclopedia''' (2005), and in the fall of 2007 '''Conversations in the Abbey'''. Currently she is working on a biography of Upton Sinclair as a health reformer.

Engs was awarded the School of HPER (now School of Public Health-Bloomingon), Indiana University Outstanding Researcher Award in 2002 and the Robert Kirk Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Tennessee’s Department of Health Education, 1997.

She is an instrument rated pilot and met her husband, Jeffrey Franz, through flying in the late 1980s. They now spend a lot of time working on and driving a Model A Ford.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24161">The '''second plague pandemic''' is a major series of epidemics of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] that started with the [[Black Death]], which reached mainland Europe in 1348 and killed up to a half of the population of Eurasia in the next four years. Although it died out in most places, it became [[epizootic]] and recurred regularly until the nineteenth century. A series of major plagues occurred in the late 17th century and it recurred in some places until the 19th. After this a new strain of the bacterium appeared as the [[Third plague pandemic|third pandemic]].

Plague is caused by the bacterium ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' which exists in the fleas of several species in the wild and particularly rats in human society. In an outbreak it may kill all its immediate hosts and thus die out, but remain active in other hosts which it does not kill and thereby cause a new outbreak years or decades later. It has several means of transmission and infection, including rats carried on board ships or vehicles, fleas hidden in grain, and in its more virulent forms is transmitted by blood and sputum directly between humans.

==Overview==
[[File:World distribution of plague 1998.PNG|thumb|300px|Worldwide distribution of plague-infected animals 1998]]
There have been three major outbreaks of plague. The [[Plague of Justinian]] in the 6th and 7th centuries is the first known attack on record, and marks the first firmly recorded pattern of [[bubonic plague]]. From historical descriptions, as much as 40% of the population of [[Constantinople]] died from the plague. Modern estimates suggest half of Europe's population died as a result of the plague before it disappeared in the 700s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/health-and-human-body/human-diseases/plague-article.html |title=Plague, Plague Information, Black Death Facts, News, Photos |work=National Geographic |accessdate=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 750, major epidemic diseases did not appear again in Europe until the Black Death of the 14th&amp;nbsp;century.{{sfn|Hays|2005| p=23}}

The Second pandemic originated in or near China and was most likely spread by the [[Silk Road]] or by ship.{{sfn|Wade|2010}} It may have reduced [[world population]] from an estimated 450 million down to 350–375 million by the year 1400.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/worldpop/table_history.php |title=Historical Estimates of World Population |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plague returned at intervals with varying [[virulence]] and mortality until the early 19th century. In England, for example, the plague returned in 1360–63 killing 20% of Londoners and in 1369 killing 10–15%.{{sfn|Britannica|1911}} In the 17th-century outbreaks were a series of "great plagues": the [[Great Plague of Seville]] (1647–52); the [[Great Plague of London]] (1665–66);&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://urbanrim.org.uk/plague%20list.htm |title=A list of National epidemics of plague in England 1348–1665 |publisher=Urbanrim.org.uk |accessdate=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Great Plague of Vienna]] (1679). In its virulent form, after the [[Great Plague of Marseille]] in 1720–22,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.beyond.fr/history/plague.html |title=Plague History Provence, – by Provence Beyond |publisher=Beyond.fr |accessdate=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Great Plague of 1738]] (which hit Eastern Europe), and the [[Russian plague of 1770–1772]], it seems to have gradually disappeared from Europe though lingering in Egypt and the Middle East. By the early 19th&amp;nbsp;century, the threat of plague had diminished, but it was quickly replaced by a new disease. The [[First cholera pandemic|Asiatic cholera]] was the first of several [[cholera]] pandemics to sweep through Asia and Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/05/09/f-cholera-outbreaks.html Cholera's seven pandemics]". CBC News. 2 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Third plague pandemic|Third Pandemic]] hit China in the 1890s and devastated India, but was largely contained in the east, though becoming endemic in the Western United States. It still causes sporadic outbreaks.{{sfn|Wade|2010}}

==Black Death==
{{main article|Black Death}}
[[File:Bubonic plague map.PNG|thumb|right|350px|Spread of the Black Death through Europe, 1347-51]]
Arab historians [[Ibn al-Wardi|Ibn Al-Wardni]] and [[Al-Maqrizi|Almaqrizi]] believed the Black Death originated in Mongolia, and Chinese records show a huge outbreak in [[Yuan Mongolia|Mongolia]] in the early 1330s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sean Martin |title=Black Death:Chapter One |publisher=Harpenden, GBR:Pocket Essentials |pages=14 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe was initially protected by a hiatus in the [[Silk Road]], but a 1347 Mongolian [[Siege of Caffa|siege]] at [[Feodosiya#Caffa|Caffa]]—the last Italian outpost on the [[Crimean Peninsula]]—spread it to the defenders, who carried it back with them that winter. It arrived at [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]] in January 1348, while simultaneously spreading through Asia Minor and into Egypt. The [[Bubonic plague|bubonic]] form was described graphically in [[Florence]] in ''[[The Decameron]]'' and [[Guy de Chauliac]] also described the [[Pneumonic plague|pneumonic]] form at [[Avignon]]. It rapidly spread to France and Spain, by 1349 was in England, in 1350 was afflicting eastern Europe and it reached the centre of Russia by 1351. In most parts it blew itself out within about three years, though only temporarily.

The 14th-century eruption of the Black Death had a drastic effect on Europe's population, irrevocably changing the social structure, and resulted in widespread persecution of minorities such as [[Antisemitism|Jews]], foreigners, [[beggar]]s, and [[Leprosy|lepers]] (see [[#Persecutions|Persecutions]]). The uncertainty of daily survival has been seen as creating a general mood of morbidity, influencing people to "live for the moment," as illustrated by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] in ''The Decameron'' (1353).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/decameronintro.html |title=Boccaccio: The Decameron, "Introduction" |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were large epidemics in China in 1331 and 1351-54 in [[Hopei]], [[Shansi]] and other provinces which are considered to have killed between 50% and 90% of the local populations, running into tens of millions. However, there is no proof currently that these were caused by plague though there are indications for the second set of epidemics.{{sfn|McNeill|1998}}

==Recurrence throughout Europe==
The plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries.{{sfn|Parker|2009|p=25}} According to Biraben, plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671.{{sfn|Hays|1998|p=58 }} Subsequent outbreaks, though severe, marked the retreat from most of Europe (18th century) and northern Africa (19th century).{{sfn|Hays|2005| p = 46 }} According to Geoffrey Parker, "[[Early Modern France|France]] alone lost almost a million people to plague in the epidemic of 1628–31."{{sfn|Parker|2001|p=7}}

In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of plague in Paris.{{sfn|Britannica|1911}} During the 16th and 17th centuries, plague visited Paris for almost one year out of three.{{sfn|Harding|2002|p=25}} The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease hit somewhere once every five or six years from 1350 to 1490.{{sfn|Byrne|2004|p=62}} Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665,{{sfn|Harding|2002|p=24 }} reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.history.ac.uk/cmh/epitwig.html Plague in London: spatial and temporal aspects of mortality]", J. A. I. Champion, ''Epidemic Disease in London'', ''Centre for Metropolitan History Working Papers Series'', No. 1 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Over 10% of [[Amsterdam]]'s population died in 1623–1625, and again in 1635–1636, 1655, and 1664.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/351/351-012.htm Geography, climate, population, economy, society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203042756/http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/351/351-012.htm |date=2010-02-03 }}.

In the first half of the 17th century, a plague claimed some 1.7 million victims in Italy, or about 14% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Julius Beloch, ''Bevölkerungsgeschichte Italiens'', volume 3, pp. 359–360.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1654, the Russian plague killed about 700,000 inhabitants&lt;ref&gt;Collins S.

==Disappearance==
The second pandemic never became endemic in Europe. Most epidemics arrived with shipping from the near east and died out after a few years. But the pandemic died out progressively across Europe. One documented case was in 17th century London, where the first proper [[demographer]], [[John Graunt]], failed by just 5 years to see the last recorded death from plague, which happened in 1679, 14 years after the [[Great Plague of London]]. The reasons it died out totally are not well understood. It is tempting to think that the [[Great Fire of London]] the next year destroyed the hiding places of the rats in the roofs. Certainly there isn't a single plague death recorded "within the walls" after 1666. However the city by this time had spread well beyond the walls which contained most of the fire and most of plague cases happened beyond the limits of the fire. Probably more significant was the fact that all buildings after the fire were constructed of brick rather than wood and other flammable materials.

This pattern was broadly followed after major epidemics in northern Italy (1631), south and east Spain (1652), southern Italy and Genoa (1657), Paris (1668).

Appleby{{sfn|Appleby|1980}} considers six possible explanations:
#People developed immunity.
#Improvements in nutrition made people more resistant.
#Improvements in housing, urban [[sanitation]] and personal cleanliness reduced the number of rats and rat fleas.
#Change in dominant rat species. (The brown rat didn't arrive in London until 1727)
#Quarantine methods improved in the 17th century.
#Some rats developed immunity so fleas never left them in droves to humans, non-resistant rats were eliminated and this broke the cycle.

It has been suggested that evolutionary processes may have favored less virulent strains of the pathogen ''Yersinia pestis''.&lt;ref name="Lenski 1988 pp. 473–474"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lenski | first=Richard E. | title=Evolution of plague virulence | journal=Nature | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=334 | issue=6182 | year=1988 | issn=0028-0836 | doi=10.1038/334473a0 | pages=473–474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably most of these have some weight, but the answer is unclear.

The disappearance happened rather later in the Nordic and eastern European countries but there was a similar halt after major epidemics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6465">A '''shifting baseline''' (also known as '''sliding baseline''') is a type of change to how a system is measured, usually against previous reference points (baselines), which themselves may represent significant changes from an even earlier state of the system.  

The concept arose in landscape architect [[Ian McHarg]]'s 1969 manifesto ''Design With Nature''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McHarg|first=Ian|title=Design With Nature|date=1969|publisher=The Natural History Press|pages=67-70}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the modern landscape is compared to that on which ancient people once lived. The concept was then considered by the [[Fisheries science|fisheries scientist]] [[Daniel Pauly]] in his paper "Anecdotes and the shifting baseline [[syndrome]] of fisheries".&lt;ref&gt;Pauly (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Pauly developed the concept in reference to [[fisheries management]] where fisheries scientists sometimes fail to identify the correct "[[wiktionary:baseline|baseline]]" population size (e.g. how abundant a fish species population was ''before'' human exploitation) and thus work with a '''shifted baseline'''. He describes the way that radically depleted fisheries were evaluated by experts who used the state of the fishery at the start of their careers as the baseline, rather than the fishery in its untouched state. Areas that swarmed with a particular species hundreds of years ago, may have experienced long term decline, but it is the level of decades previously that is considered the appropriate reference point for current populations. In this way large declines in ecosystems or species over long periods of time were, and are, masked. There is a loss of [[perception]] of change that occurs when each [[generation]] redefines what is "natural". 

Most modern fisheries stock assessments do not ignore historical fishing and account for it by either including the historical catch or use other techniques to reconstruct the depletion level of the population at the start of the period for which adequate data is available. Anecdotes about historical populations levels can be highly unreliable and result in severe mismanagement of the fishery.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The concept was further refined and applied to the [[ecology]] of [[kelp forest]]s by Paul Dayton and others from the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]]. They used a slightly different version of the term in their paper, "Sliding baselines, ghosts, and reduced expectations in kelp forest communities".&lt;ref&gt;Dayton (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Both terms refer to a shift over time in the expectation of what a healthy ecosystem baseline looks like.

==Broadened meaning==
In 2002, [[filmmaker]] and former [[marine biologist]] Randy Olson broadened the definition of shifting baselines with an [[op-ed]] in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. He explained the relevance of the concept to all aspects of change and the failure to notice change in the world today. He and [[coral reef]] [[ecologist]] [[Jeremy Jackson (scientist)|Jeremy Jackson]] (of [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]]) co-founded ''The Shifting Baselines Ocean Media Project'' [http://www.shiftingbaselines.org] in 2003 to help promote a wider understanding and use of the concept in [[Conservation movement|conservation]] policy.

The Shifting Baselines Ocean Media Project grew from its three founding partners (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, [[The Ocean Conservancy]], and [[Surfrider Foundation]]) to over twenty conservation groups and science organizations.  The project has produced dozens of short films, [[public service announcements]], and Flash videos along with photography, video, and stand-up comedy contests, all intended to promote the term to a broader audience.  The Shifting Baselines Blog, "the cure for planetary amnesia"[http://www.scienceblogs.com/shiftingbaselines] is run by the Shifting Baselines Ocean Media Project on the [[Seed (magazine)]] Science Blogs.

'''Solomon Eliot Asch '''(September 14, 1907 – February 20, 1996) was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt psychologist]] and pioneer in [[social psychology]] in the [[United States]]. He created seminal pieces of work in impression formation, prestige suggestion, conformity, and many other topics in social psychology.  His work follows a common theme of Gestalt psychology that the whole is not only greater than the sum of its parts, but the nature of the whole fundamentally alters the parts. Asch stated: "Most social acts have to be understood in their setting, and lose meaning if isolated. No error in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function" (Asch, 1952, p.&amp;nbsp;61).&lt;ref&gt;Asch, Solomon E. Social Psychology. New York: Prentice-Hall, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; He is most well known for his conformity experiments, in which he demonstrated the influence of group pressure on opinions. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Asch as the 41st most cited psychologist of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haggbloom |first=Steven J. |last2=''et al.'' |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III| displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Asch was born in [[Warsaw]], Poland on September 14, 1907 to a Jewish family. He grew up in a small town, [[Lowicz|Łowicz, Poland]].

In 1920 Asch emigrated at the age of 13 with his family to the United States. They lived on the [[Lower East Side]] of New York, a dense area of many Jewish, Italian and Irish immigrants. His friends called him Shlaym.&lt;ref name="Legacy"&gt;Rock, Irvin. ''The Legacy of Solomon Asch: Essays in Cognition and Social Psychology'', Lawrence Erlbaum, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Asch was shy when he moved to the United States and did not speak English fluently due to being brought up in Poland. He went to the neighborhood public school, P.S. 147, to attend 6th grade. As a result of the language barrier, Asch had a very difficult time understanding in class. He learned English by reading [[Charles Dickens]]. Asch later attended [[Townsend Harris High School]], a very selective high school attached to the [[City College of New York]]. After high school, he attended the [[City College of New York]], majoring in both literature and science. He became interested in psychology towards the end of his undergraduate career after reading the work of [[William James]] and a few philosophers. In 1928, when he was 21 years old, he received his Bachelor of Science.&lt;ref name="Legacy" /&gt;

Asch went on to pursue his graduate degree at [[Columbia University]]. He initially was interested in anthropology, not in social psychology.  With the help of [[Gardner Murphy]], [[Lois Murphy]], [[Franz Boas]], and [[Ruth Benedict]] he gained a summer fellowship and investigated how children become members of their culture. His master's thesis was a statistical analysis of the test scores of 200 children under the supervision of Woodworth. Asch received his master's degree in 1930. His doctoral dissertation examined whether all learning curves have the same form; H.E. Garrett assigned the topic to him. He received his PhD in 1932.&lt;ref name="Legacy" /&gt;

Asch was exposed to Gestalt psychology through [[Gardner Murphy]], then a young faculty member at Columbia. He became much more interested in Gestalt psychology after meeting and working closely with his adviser at Columbia, [[Max Wertheimer]], one of the founders of Gestalt psychology. Asch later became close friend with Wertheimer.&lt;ref name="Legacy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/aschcenter/about/solomon.htm|title=About Solomon Asch|website=www.brynmawr.edu|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family life==
Asch met Florence Miller in a library on East Broadway on the lower East Side in New York City. He married her in 1930. Their relationship was reported as being "easy, good-humored" (Rock, pg. 5).&lt;ref name="Legacy" /&gt; Asch remained married to Florence his entire life. They had their first and only son, Peter, in 1937. Peter Asch became a Professor of Economics at Rutgers University, married Ruth Zindler and had two sons, Eric and David. Peter died of heart failure at age 52 (predeceasing both parents and his wife.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries: Peter Ash, Professor, 52 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/10/obituaries/peter-asch-professor-52.html|accessdate=23 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=10 November 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Asch began his teaching career at [[Brooklyn College]]. In 1947, he moved to [[Swarthmore College]], where he stayed for 19 years (1947-1966). Swarthmore was the major center for scholars of Gestalt psychology at that time in the United States. [[Wolfgang Kohler]], a German immigrant; W. C. H. Prentice, and [[Hans Wallach]] were faculty members at that time as well.

In 1966, Asch left to found the Institute for Cognitive Studies at [[Rutgers University]] (1966-1972). In 1972, Asch moved to the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He taught there as a professor of psychology until he retired in 1979, and was Emeritus until 1996. Asch also had visiting posts at Harvard and MIT.&lt;ref name="Legacy" /&gt;

===Impression formation===
Asch was interested in how humans form impressions of other human beings.  He was intrigued how we are able to easily form impressions of humans even though we have such complex structures. He specifically was interested in how impressions of other people were established and if there were any principles that regulated these impressions. Asch concluded "to know a person is to have a grasp of a particular structure". He demonstrated through his experiments that forming an impression has the following elements:
*1) it is an organized process, 
*2) the characteristics are perceived differently in relation to other characteristics, 
*3) central qualities are discovered, causing a distinction between them and peripheral qualities, 
*4) relations of harmony and contradiction are observed.&lt;ref name="Impressions"&gt;Asch, Solomon E. "Forming impressions of personality", ''The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology'' 41.3 (1946): 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asch conducted many experiments in which he asked participants to form an impression of a hypothetical person based on several characteristics said to belong to them.&lt;ref name="Impressions" /&gt;

'''Central characteristics on impression formation'''
In one experiment, two groups, A and B, were exposed to a list of exactly the same characteristics except one, cold vs. warm. The list of characteristics given to each group are listed below:&lt;ref name="Impressions" /&gt;

Group A: intelligent-skillful-industrious-''warm''-determined-practical-cautious

Group B: intelligent-skillful-industrious-''cold''-determined-practical-cautious

One group of people were told that the person was ''warm'' and another group of people were told the person is "cold". Participants were asked to write a brief description of the impression they formed after hearing these characteristics. The experimenters also produced a check list consisting of pairs of opposite traits, such as generous/ungenerous, shrewd/wise, etc. These words were related to the first list of characteristics they heard. Participants were asked to indicate which of these traits matched with the hypothetical person who had just been described to them.&lt;ref name="Impressions" /&gt;

Asch found that very different impressions were found based on this one characteristic in the list. In general, the "A" impressions were far more positive than the "B" impressions. Based on the results of the written descriptions of the hypothetical person, the meaning of the other characteristics in the list seemed to change, related to whether the hypothetical person was described as a "warm" or "cold" person.&lt;ref name="Impressions" /&gt;

Not all qualities were changed by this word. Words such as "honest", "strong", "serious", and "reliable" were not affected. The words "warm" and "cold" were shown to be of more importance in forming participant's impressions than other characteristics. They were considered to be basic to understanding the person, whereas other characteristics would be considered secondary. Thus, if another characteristic in this list was changed between two subjects, such as manipulating the words "polite" and "blunt", instead of the words "warm" and "cold", it would not affect the impression of the person as much as did "warm" and "cold". Asch called "warm" and "cold" "central" characteristics, and "polite" and "blunt" peripheral characteristics.&lt;ref name="Impressions" /&gt;

'''Order effects on impression formation'''

In another experiment, Asch found that the order in which he presented the traits of a hypothetical person drastically influenced the impression formed by participants formed. For example, participants were read one of the following lists below:&lt;ref name="Impressions" /&gt;

A. intelligent-industrious-impulsive-critical-stubborn-envious

B. envious-stubborn-critical-impulsive-industrious-intelligent

Series A starts with desirable qualities and ends with undesirable qualities, while the reverse is true for Series B. As a result of this slight difference, people perceive person A as someone who is an "able person who possesses certain shortcomings which, do not, however, overshadow his merits". But, people perceive person B as a "problem, whose abilities are hampered by his serious difficulties". The meaning of the other words in this list also change in the majority of subjects between list A and list B. Words such as "impulsive" and "critical" take on a positive meaning with A, but a negative meaning with B.&lt;ref name="Impressions" /&gt;

'''Similarity and difference of impression'''

In another central experiment, Asch presented participants with four groups of characteristics. Each participant was exposed to the group of words listed below.&lt;ref name="Impressions" /&gt;

Set 1: Quick, Skillful, Helpful

Set 2: Quick, Clumsy, Helpful

Set 3: Slow, Skillful, Helpful

Set 4: Slow, Clumsy, Helpful

Notice that only one characteristic, "helpful", is the same throughout all of the four sets.  Participants were asked 1) which of the other three sets most resemble Set I, and 2) which of the other sets most resembles Set 2. In 87 percent of the cases, Set 1 was seen most similar with Set 3. In only 13 percent of the cases, people reported Set 1 to be similar to Set 2. Also, Set 2 was said to resemble Set 4 in 85 percent of the cases and only 9 percent of the cases was it said to resemble Set I was the closest.&lt;ref name="Impressions" /&gt;

However, there are more "identical elements" in Set 1 and 2 and in Set 3 and 4. Notice that two of the three words are the same in Set 1 and 2 and in Set 3 and 4. The similarity in sets can not be based on the number of shared elements in the set. Participants also reported that the word "quick" of set 1 was most similar in meaning to "slow" of set 3. Similarly, "quick" of set 2 was perceived to be most similar in meaning to "slow" of set 4.&lt;ref name="Impressions" /&gt;

Asch reached the following conclusions based on this experiment:

1)The meaning of a characteristic changes based on a change in the "environment" it's in. Thus, the meanings of the words "quick" and "slow" change based on what other words it is presented with or associated with in real life. The meaning of the word "quick" in set 1 is associated more with "one of assurance, of smoothness of movement" while in set 2 the word is associated with "forced quickness, in an effort to be helpful". In everyday life, we perceive a quick, skillful person to be very different from a quick, clumsy person. However, we perceive someone who is "quick and skillful" and "slow and skillful" as being similar and sharing the same quality of being more of an expert.&lt;ref name="Impressions" /&gt;

2)	The change in the meaning of the characteristic is determined by its relationship with other characteristics. "[Set] I is quick because he is skillful; [Set] 2 is clumsy because he is fast"
"In [Set] 3 slowness indicates care, prides in work well-done. Slowness in [Set] 4 indicates sluggishness, poor motor coordinate, some physical retardation" We perceive our overall impression by integrating the relationships of the different qualities of a person. Therefore, we form very different impressions when one of these qualities differ.&lt;ref name="Impressions" /&gt;

3)	"Dynamic consequences are grasped in the interaction of qualities", (Asch, pg. 280). Participants considered "quick" and "skillful" and "slow" and "skillful" as characteristics that cooperate together, but they think of "quick" and "clumsy" as characteristics that cancel one another.&lt;ref name="Impressions" /&gt;

===Prestige suggestion===
As a result of World War II in the 1940s, Asch and other social psychologists were interested in propaganda. They wondered: How do you get people to believe what you want them to believe? How do you get people to believe they should sacrifice for the war effort? &lt;ref name="Legacy" /&gt;

In everyday life, psychologists noticed that people are persuaded by messages differently based on the identity of the author. It seemed that the more prestige the author/speaker has, the more likely the person will believe them.  Many social psychologists prior to Asch had studied this phenomenon. However, Asch disagreed with many of them and critiqued their interpretations. His main conclusion was that a change in evaluation requires a change in the content and meaning of the response as a result of the change in context. Therefore, the meaning of the message is interpreted differently depending on who is the author of the message. He suggests that participants are not blindly accepting a message based on the author, but rather they are making meaning of the quote based on the author.&lt;ref name="Prestige"&gt;Asch S. E. ( 1948). "The doctrine of suggestion, prestige, and imitation in social psychology". Psychological Review, 55, 250-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asch called into question the present theory for the underlying psychological process concerning the effect of group forces on the formation and change of opinions and attitudes. 
Asch critiques the experimental approach of many different psychologists, including Zillig, Moore, Marple, Sherif, Thorndike, and Lorge, in their investigations of evaluation change. Lorge's and Sherif's investigation of the effects of "prestige" on the evaluation of statements were investigated in detail in one of Asch's articles.&lt;ref name="Prestige" /&gt;

The same basic procedure was used by all of the above-mentioned psychologists. A participant makes a judgment about some particular issue. At a later time, they judge the same problem again but with information of how certain groups or prestigious people have evaluated the same problem. If the subject changes his judgment in the same direction as the evaluations of these groups of people or prestigious people, then this is considered a degree of influence that they have exerted on the participant's judgment.&lt;ref name="Prestige" /&gt;

'''Lorge critique'''

Lorge's main finding was that "prestige" can alter evaluations of statements of serious political and economic questions.&lt;ref name="Lorge" /&gt;

In his experiment, subjects rated a set of 50 quotations on a 5-point scale of "agreement" or "disagreement" with the statement. The quotes were followed by the names of two public people. Subjects were informed that one of the names was the author of the true source and were asked to select the true author. After about a month, the subjects again rated the same quotation but with the true author only listed below the quotation. Subjects also rated earlier their "respect for the political opinions of each of these individuals". This was used as a measure of prestige.  Lorge found that the participants rated the same statement differently when it was referred to a different author. More specifically, the rating of a statement tended to rise when it was referred to a more "prestigious" author.&lt;ref name="Lorge"&gt;Lorge, Irving, and Carl C. Curtiss. "Prestige, suggestion, and attitudes". The Journal of Social Psychology 7.4 (1936): 386-402.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Lorge's main conclusions is that "an unchanged object of judgment undergoes a change of evaluation". Therefore, the prestige of the author is viewed as acting arbitrarily on the statement regardless of the content or merit of the statement. Participants simply view the statement as having higher value when the author has higher prestige.&lt;ref name="Lorge" /&gt;

Asch, however, reinterprets Lorge's findings and suggests that there was "a change in the object of judgment, rather than in the judgment of the object" (Asch, 1940). He suggests that a person will redefine the object of judgment based on the content of the evaluations. Therefore, the person will base the meaning of the quote in the context of what he/she believes to be true about the person who said the quote, resulting in different meanings of the statements based on the author.&lt;ref name="Prestige" /&gt;

In evidence of his claims, Asch conducted an experiment in which college students read statements with the name of one author below each statement. They were instructed to describe what the statement meant to them. Two groups of students read the same statements but with different authors associated with them. The main finding was that there was a "cognitive reorganization" of the statement based on what was understood about the author of the statement. Participant's felt the meaning of the quote differed depending on who wrote the statement.&lt;ref name="Principles"&gt;Asch, S E. "Studies in the principles of judgments and attitudes II Determination of judgments by group and by ego standards". ''The Journal of Social Psychology'' 12 (1940): 433-465.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the following quote was presented to both groups of subjects: "Only the willfully blind can fail to see that the old style capitalism of a primitive freebooting period is gone forever. The capitalism of complete laissez-faire, which thrived on low wages and maximum profits for minimum turnover, which rejected collective bargaining and fought against justified public regulation of the competitive process, is a thing of the past." When participants thought that Bridges (a well-known union leader) was the author, they interpreted the passage to be an "expression of the accomplishments of labor in the face of opposition from capital and contained a resolve to defend these gains from attack". However, when Johnston (president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the time) was the author, they interpreted the passage to be "a perspective of policy in the interest of business, especially of 'enlightened' business". Asch conducted a very similar and classic study with participants reading statements either attributed to Jefferson or Lenin.&lt;ref name="Principles" /&gt;

One of the major points that Asch makes is that participants are not completely blind in the experiment and making arbitrary choices based on this bias. Asch claims that participants were acting reasonable in their change of evaluation of the judgment because the context of the judgment and thus the meaning of the judgment had changed. Lorge, however, suggested that if the participants were behaving logical, their evaluations should have remained the same despite the change in author.&lt;ref name="Prestige" /&gt;

'''Sherif critique'''

[[Muzafer Sherif]] conducted an experiment, very similar to Lorge, in which he investigated how prestige affects the evaluation of literary materials. College students were asked to rank a set of prose passages according to their literary quality. Each passage also included the name of a well-known author. However, all of the passages were actually written by the same author.  Participants rated the authors earlier in terms of their literary standing. Sherif found that passages that were identified with highly acclaimed authors received higher rankings.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, Muzafer. "The psychology of social norms". (1936).&lt;/ref&gt;

Asch suggested that Sherif's results could be largely influenced from the environment of a laboratory experiment. Because the experiment was designed to have each of the passages have very few differences between them, participants were faced with a dilemma when asked to distinguish between them. The experimenter and other neighboring participants may appear to find the task obvious, so the participant attends to any clues that might help him make the decision. In fear of looking ridiculous, the participant might now approach the task as, "Which of these am I expected to like and dislike?" With the only information that varies being the author, the participant might make conclusions about the quotes based on this one piece of information that varies.&lt;ref name="Prestige" /&gt;

===Conformity experiments===
Asch is best known for his [[conformity experiments]].  His main finding was that peer pressure can change opinion and even perception.

Asch asked: 1) To what extent do social forces alter people's opinions?   2) Which aspect of the group influence is most important–the size of the majority or unanimity of opinion?&lt;ref name="Conformity" /&gt;

Asch's conformity experiment was conducted using 123 male participants who were told that they would be part of an experiment in visual judgment. Each subject was put into a group with 5 to 7 confederates (people who knew the true aims of the experiment, but were introduced as participants to the naive "real" participant). The group was shown a card with a line on it, followed by another card with 3 lines on it labeled a, b, and c. The participants were then asked to say which line matched in length the line on the first card. Each line question was called a "trial". The "real" participant answered last or penultimately. For the first two trials, the subject would feel at ease in the experiment, as he and the other "participants" gave the obvious, correct answer. However, after the fourth trial, all of the confederates respond with the clearly wrong answer at certain points such that in 12 of the 18 trials they all gave the wrong answer. The 12 trials in which the confederates answered incorrectly were the "critical trials".  The participant could thus either ignore the majority and go with his own senses or he could go along with the majority and ignore the clearly obvious fact. The aim was to see whether the real participant would change his answer and respond the same way as the confederates or stick with what his eyes plainly told him.&lt;ref name="Conformity"&gt;Asch, Solomon E. "Opinions and social pressure". Readings about the social animal (1955): 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asch found that some 1/4 of all subjects successfully withstands this form of social pressure, 1/20 completely succumbs, while the remainder conforms to the majority's manifestly incorrect opinion only in some experimental rounds. Asch suggested that this procedure created a doubt in the participants' mind about the seemingly obvious answer. Participants reported that the correct but rejected line was almost but not quite equal to the standard line. Asch also found that the effectiveness of the group pressure increased significantly from 1 person to 3 people unanimously responding incorrectly. However, there was not much increase after that. He also found that when one confederate responded correctly, the power of the majority to influence the subject decreased substantially.&lt;ref name="Conformity" /&gt;

Asch told his colleagues that his studies of conformity were informed by his childhood experiences in Poland. He recalled being seven years old and staying up for his first Passover night. He recalls seeing his grandmother pour an extra glass of wine. When he asked who the glass of wine was for, she said that it was for the prophet Elijah. He then asked her whether Elijah would really take a sip from the glass and his uncle assured him that he would. His uncle told him to watch very closely when the time came. "Filled with a sense of suggestion and expectation" Asch "thought he saw the level of wine in the cup drop just a bit".&lt;ref name="NYtimesArticle"&gt;Stout, D. (February 29, 1996). [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/29/us/solomon-asch-is-dead-at-88-a-leading-social-psychologist.html Solomon Asch is dead at 88; a leading social psychologists]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, early in life, Asch succumbed to social pressure, an experience which led him to investigate conformity later in life.

===Other work===

'''Metaphors'''

Asch looked at metaphors in a variety of different languages, such as Old Testament Hebrew, Homeric Greek, Chinese, Thai, Malayam, and Hausa. He found that there was a similar meaning for the sensory term, such as "cold" in English, and the corresponding personality trait. He concluded that metaphors, and thus language, reflects a person's attempt to understand the true properties of a person or object.&lt;ref name="Legacy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asch S. E. ( 1955). "On the use of metaphor in the description of persons". In H. Werner (Ed.), On expressive language (29-38). Worcester, MA: Clark University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asch S. E. ( 1958). "The metaphor: a psychological inquiry". In R. Tagiuri &amp; L. Petrullo (Eds.), Person perception and interpersonal behavior (pp.&amp;nbsp;86–94), California: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asch S. E., &amp; Prentice W. C. H. ( 1958). "Paired association with related and unrelated pairs of nonsense figures". American Journal of Psychology, 71, 247-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unitary and nonunitary associations'''

Asch showed that simple properties would enter into associations much easier when they are part of the same unit than when they are from different units.&lt;ref name="Legacy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asch S. E. ( 1962). "A problem in the theory of associations". Psychologische Beitrage, 6, 553-563.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asch S. E. ( 1969). "A reformulation of the problem of associations". American Psychologist, 24, 92-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asch S. E., Ceraso J., &amp; Heimer W. ( 1960). "Perceptual conditions of association". Psychological Monographs, 74( 3), 1-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable influences==
Asch was [[Stanley Milgram]]'s advisor at Princeton University, and Milgram completed his dissertation on national differences under conformity under Asch.&lt;ref&gt;Milgram, Stanley. "Nationality and conformity". Scientific American (1961).&lt;/ref&gt; Asch also largely influenced the theory of many other social psychologists, such as [[Harold Kelley]].&lt;ref&gt;Raven, Bertram H., Albert Pepitone and John Holmes. (2003) Harold Kelley (1921-2003). American Psychologist, 806-807&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

According to Levine (1999), Asch's research has led to four critical ideas that persist in social influence research. First, Asch believed that social interaction reflects the ability of individual people to  synthesize information about group norms, the viewpoints of others and their own perceptions of themselves as group members. This point of view has been manifested in at least two important theories (social identity theory and [[self-categorization theory]]), and has been a source of inspiration for the work of many social psychologists (See Hardin &amp; Higgins, 1996; Weick &amp; Roberts, 1993).

Second, Asch emphasized that independent thought and disagreement among group members is a cornerstone of group functioning. He believed that only by settling our differences with other group members can we actually understand the shortcomings of our own beliefs (Levine, 1999). This notion has been embraced by social scientists like Moscovici, who has pursued this rationale as the basis for his theory of minority influence in group situations, and has also been incorporated into sociocognitive conflict theory.

Asch also believed the relationship between conformity and non-conformity was not as simple as one being the opposite of the other. This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could be a function of how aware a person is that they are being influenced by the group (distortion of perception), the degree to which the person believes that the group consensus is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes (Levine, 1999).

Lastly, Asch suggested that group influence can change how people perceive stimuli (See Asch, 1940 for an example). This is the most obscure of Asch's major ideas, in large part because it has not been cited frequently (Levine, 1999), but is none-the-less important because it speaks to the power of group influence.

In the 1980s, Asch was disappointed and concerned by the direction social psychology was taking. He wrote, "Why do I sense, together with the current expansion, a shrinking of vision, an expansion of surface rather than depth, a failure of imagination?....Why is not social psychology more exciting, more human in the most usual sense of that term? To sum up, is this discipline perhaps on the wrong track?" (Asch, p. x) Asch was worried that social psychologists were not asking the deeper questions that would help change and improve the world.

'''Parable of the Grain of Wheat''' ([[Koine Greek|Greek]]: ὁ κόκκος τοῦ σῑ́του; ''ho kókkos toû sī́tou'') is an [[allegory]] on [[resurrection]], [[sacrifice]], and [[ego death]], given by [[Jesus]] in the [[New Testament]] (The [[Gospel of John]]).

== Narrative ==

From John 12:24-26 ([[King James Version|KJV]])

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Verily, verily, I say unto you, еxcept a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;From the [[New International Version|NIV]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honour the one who serves me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Interpretation ==

[[Jesus]] drew this parable about [[resurrection]] and the [[kingdom of God]] from the everyday circumstances of life. His rural audience could easily understand the principle of "resurrection" produced by dead seeds sown into the earth.&lt;ref name="Parable"&gt;[http://www.rc.net/wcc/parabl20.htm The Parables of Jesus: The Grain of Wheat]&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus uses the metaphor of the grain of wheat to illustrate the importance of ego death in the pursuit of salvation and entering the Kingdom of Heaven. He is suggesting that one must first allow their current convictions and ideas about the world to die and be shed, before they can be reborn with a purer, more virtuous self that is stronger than the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/content/good-word/grain-wheat|title=A Grain of Wheat|date=2009-03-27|work=America Magazine|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of the grain of wheat dying in the earth in order to grow and bear a harvest can be seen also as a metaphor of Jesus' own death and burial in the tomb and his resurrection.&lt;ref name="Parable" /&gt; 

The Rev. William D. Oldland in his sermon "Unless a Grain of Wheat Falls into the Earth and Dies" said:

{{quote|This parable is used by Jesus to teach them three things. First, he teaches them that he must die. Secondly, he shows them God is in control. Finally, he shows them that his death has purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rc.net/wcc/parabl20.htm The Rev. William D. Oldland, Sermon: "Unless a Grain of Wheat Falls into the Earth and Dies"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Apostle Paul]] also says: "What is sown in the earth is subject to decay, what rises is incorruptible" (1 Cor. 15:42).

The '''USMLE Step 1''' (more commonly just '''Step 1''' or colloquially, '''The Boards''') is the first part of the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]]. It aims to assess whether medical school students or graduates can apply important concepts of the foundational sciences fundamental to the practice of medicine. US medical students who wish to seek licensure to practice medicine in the US, typically take Step 1 at the end of the second year of medical school. Graduates of international medical schools (i.e., those outside the US or Canada) must also take Step 1 if they want to practice in the US. Graduates from international medical schools must apply through [[ECFMG]], and the registration fee is $915.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfmg.org/fees.html] ECFMG Fees&lt;/ref&gt; For 2016, the [[National Board of Medical Examiners|NBME]] registration fee for the test is $600, with additional charges for applicants who choose a testing region outside the United States or Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbme.org/Students/examfees.html] USMLE Fees&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to 1992, the NBME Part I examination served as the staple basic science examination for medical students at the end of their second year.  Upon the launch of the three-part [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]], NBME Part I exam was carried forward in its new format, the USMLE Step 1 examination, which has since evolved to become an increasingly clinically-applied examination of the foundational sciences.  The exam became computer based several years later.  In May 2015, the USMLE began emphasizing of concepts regarding patient safety and quality improvement across all parts of the USMLE exam series, including Step 1.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usmle.org/pdfs/Changes_to_USMLE_handout.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

While the USMLE Step 1 has traditionally been taken after students complete foundational sciences and before core [[clinical clerkship]]s, in recent years a number of medical schools have reformed their medical school curriculum, moving to having students take the USMLE Step 1 ''after'' core clinical clerkships or preliminary clinical training. Top allopathic medical schools such as [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Baylor College of Medicine]], [[Weill Cornell Medical College]], [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania]], [[Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons]] at [[Columbia University]], [[Stanford School of Medicine]], [[University of Michigan]], [[Yale School of Medicine]], and [[New York University School of Medicine]] have instituted these changes, requiring completion of the exam in the third year of medical school. &lt;ref&gt;Michelle Daniel; Amy Fleming; Colleen O’Conner Grochowski; Vicky Harnik; Sibel Klimstra; Gail Morrison; Arnyce Pock; Michael L. Schwartz; Sally Santen. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28422816 Why Not Wait? Eight Institutions Share Their Experiences Moving United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 After Core Clinical Clerkships], ''[[Academic Medicine (journal)|Academic Medicine]]'' 2017 Nov;92(11):1515-1524. [[doi:10.1097/ACM.0000000000001714]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The exam is currently an eight-hour computer-based test taken in a single-day, composed of seven 40-question sections with a maximum 280 multiple-choice questions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmle.org/General_Information/announcements.aspx?contentId=45] USMLE General Announcements&lt;/ref&gt; One hour is provided for each section, allotting an average of a minute and thirty seconds to answer each question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmle.org/General_Information/announcements.html#Step1Change] USMLE Announcements&lt;/ref&gt; Between test sections, the test taker is allotted a cumulative 45 minutes (during the test day) for personal breaks. (There is a 15-minute tutorial at the beginning of the exam, which the test-taker can choose to skip and have that time added to break time.)  If the taker finishes any section before the allotted one hour time limit, the unused time is added to the break time total.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmle.org/bulletin/testing/#step12ck3] USMLE Testing Bulletin&lt;/ref&gt;  The test is administered at any of several [[Prometric]] computer testing sites.

==Subjects==
Step 1 is designed to test the knowledge learned during the basic science years of medical school as applied in the form of clinical vignettes. This includes [[anatomy]], [[behavioral sciences]], [[biochemistry]], [[microbiology]], [[pathology]], [[pharmacology]], and [[physiology]], as well as to interdisciplinary areas including [[genetics]], [[aging]], [[immunology]], [[nutrition]], and molecular and [[cell biology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usmle.org/Examinations/step1/step1_content.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epidemiology]], [[medical ethics]] and questions on [[empathy]] are also emphasized.  Each exam is dynamically generated for each test taker; while the general proportion of questions derived from a particular subject is the same, some test takers report that certain subjects are either emphasized or deemphasized.

==Scoring==
Currently, students receive a three-digit score following sitting for the Step 1 examination.  In 1999, the USMLE phased out the use of a [[percentile]]-based system in favor of a three-digit and two-digit scaled scoring system.  In October 2011, two-digit scaled scores were no longer reported to any parties besides the examinees.  In April 2013, the two-digit score was eliminated completely from the score report.

While the USMLE program does not disclose how the three-digit score is calculated, Step 1 scores theoretically range from 1 to 300, most examinees score in the range of 140 to 260, the passing score is 194 and the national mean and standard deviation are approximately 229 and 20, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usmle.org/pdfs/transcripts/USMLE_Step_Examination_Score_Interpretation_Guidelines.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmle.org/transcripts/|title=United States Medical Licensing Examination - Scores &amp; Transcripts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rise in the national mean Step 1 score has been observed with time, as shown in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med-ed.virginia.edu/handbook/academics/licensure.cfm|title=Medical Student Handbook|first=Wellfire|last=Interactive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Resident Matching Program, the mean score for U.S. allopathic seniors who matched to residency programs in 2016 was 233.2 (sd = 17.4).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Charting-Outcomes-US-Allopathic-Seniors-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on residency matching==
The USMLE score is one of many factors considered by residency programs in selecting applicants. However, at present, this test is the ''only'' standardized measure of all applicants. The median USMLE Step 1 scores for graduates of U.S. Medical Schools for various residencies are charted in Chart 6 on page 9 of "Charting Outcomes in the Match" available through [http://www.nrmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Charting-Outcomes-US-Allopathic-Seniors-2016.pdf NRMP Website]

Many residency programs use a "cutoff" score for Step 1, below which applicants are unlikely to be considered, although in some cases individuals with significantly higher Step 2 CK scores may still receive further consideration. The NRMP Residency Program Director survey contains more information, both overall and by specialty, regarding "cutoff" scores (i.e., scores below which programs generally do not grant interviews).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NRMP-2016-Program-Director-Survey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VirtualGym TV''' was a live broadcasting and on-demand online gym, which provided access to hundreds of exercise classes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enterprisehubnetwork.co.uk/case_history/virtualgym_tv.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107040446/http://www.enterprisehubnetwork.co.uk/case_history/virtualgym_tv.html |date=January 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was created to help address the global [[obesity]] crisis, which faces the UK, and the wider general population. Almost 1 in 4 adults in England are currently obese, and if this pattern were to continue in this current manner 9 in 10 adults will be overweight or obese by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Healthimprovement/Obesity/DH_6585 ]{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the key reasons for this is that more than 85% of the adult population, either can't, won't or don't visit a [[gym]] or [[health club]] in order to participate in regular exercise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realbusiness.co.uk/news/leadership/5275551/virtual-gym-for-timepoor-brits.thtml ]{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical barrier reasons to participation are personal reasons such as privacy, self-consciousness, intimidation, cost, flexibility and geography. The "delivery solution" from VirtualGym TV is designed to permit on-demand access to exercise to eliminate these participation barriers.

The company reached out to an audience of in excess of 130,000 retail and corporate users.

==History==
The idea was founded when the now Managing Director, Richard Davis (who found himself clinically obese), was having a conversation with a high level instructor colleague, where at the time, the only real options were to either create a Fitness DVD and distribute it in the normal way, or to broadcast on the television. Coming from a background in Employee Benefits (selling insurance to suckers), Davis developed what is primarily a corporate benefit for large scale, fragmented workforces, but is accessible by the wider genera public as well.&lt;ref name="timesonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/entrepreneur/article3845757.ece|title=Login|publisher=business.timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company had continued to grow and by the summer of 2008 it formed a strategic alliance with the major [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] manufacturer, [[Asics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medway.gov.uk/newsindex/newsmain.htm/newspage?item=79911 ]{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, they had achieved approval from the Department of Health and are a delivery partner of the Change4Life and MoreActive4Life social obesity campaigns ([[National Health Service|NHS]]) before they closed down. They also worked in [[partnership]] with their alcohol limits campaign, and the business awareness campaign with the FIA ([[Fitness Industry Association]]).

==Features==
The core of the product was powered by the 'Virtual Personal Trainer' (VPT) software which was a bespoke facility. The software captured a broad range of physiological and psychological data, which was analysed by the VPT software and appropriate exercise recommendations were prescribed specifically tailored for the individual. The VPT would specifically recommend which sessions the customer should participate in, the frequency with which they should participate and the intensity level that was right for them.&lt;ref name="virtualgym"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualgym.tv/aboutus.aspx|title=VirtualGym TV - The future of fitness &amp;#124; Pilates &amp;#124; Yoga &amp;#124; Aerobics &amp;#124; Boxercise         &amp;#124; The world&amp;rsquo;s first internet broadcasting health &amp;amp; fitness centre|publisher=virtualgym.tv|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The user would then participate in regular exercise from their ever-changing library of exercise content across all exercise areas. This ranged from Aerobics through to Pilates, Stability Ball and very specific pre &amp; post natal content.

It was rumoured that the launch of 'Virtual Personal Trainer 2' (VPT2) software, early in 2010, would see the introduction of new features to increase the accuracy of customers own fitness program, the capturing of live physiological data during exercise, as well as a number of downloadable software applications for mobile handset devices. How sad, it never worked!

==Classes==
Each week no new classes [[class (education)|classes]] are uploaded to the site.&lt;ref name="volomed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volomed.com/index.php?module=Pages&amp;func=display&amp;pageid=23|title=http://www.volomed.com/index.php?module=Pages&amp;func=display&amp;pageid=23|publisher=volomed.com|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bank of classes and tuition classes are no longer delivered through the internet to any past clients. Typical classes used to include [[Aerobics]], Step Aerobics, [[Boxercise]], [[Kick Boxing]], [[Yoga]], [[Pilates]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]], Body Conditioning, [[Circuit Training]], Body Sculpting, [[Medicine Ball]], [[Dance]], Stationary (Spin) Bicycle, [[Treadmill]], [[Interval Training]], and various [[Martial Arts]] training sessions, (including [[meditation]] / [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]]).&lt;ref name="virtualgym2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualgym.tv/archivesession.aspx|title=VirtualGym TV - The future of fitness &amp;#124; Pilates &amp;#124; Yoga &amp;#124; Aerobics &amp;#124; Boxercise         &amp;#124; The world&amp;rsquo;s first internet broadcasting health &amp;amp; fitness centre|publisher=virtualgym.tv|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes were scheduled in a similar fashion to a traditional gym, with shorter energising sessions in the morning and longer sessions in the afternoon and evening, which last between 45 and 60&amp;nbsp;minutes before going off to the pub. Sessions were broadcast across a range of ability standards, so that customers could have chosen the appropriate complexity and [[physical fitness|fitness]] demand that was relevant for them. Customers could also learn a new fitness skill from scratch, with “starter” teaching sessions for those who have never participated in that exercise type before.

==Instructors==
Instructors are accredited with the Register of Exercise Professions (REPS), the governing  body for the health and fitness industry, and the National Register of Personal Trainers. They  are qualified to a minimum level by the relevant professional organisation. Instructors include  Pierre Pozzuto, personal trainer of [[Gordon Ramsay]], [[Christian Slater]] and [[Keira Knightley]].&lt;ref name="marieclaire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/health/features/275656/gym-in-a-box.html|title=Gym in a Box &amp;#124; Marie Claire|publisher=marieclaire.co.uk|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other well known instructors include Dan Little, Jackie Diss and Chris Roberts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5760">The [[World Health Organization]]'s '''global plan of action for workers' health''' delineates common principles by which workplaces should abide by, including the ability for workers to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and favorable working conditions, as well as the prioritization of the prevention of occupational health hazards. The plan was endorsed by the Sixtieth World Health Assembly on May 23, 2007 because of several concerns. First, workers represent a significant contribution to the world's economic and social development. Furthermore, an international disparity between countries of occupational hazard prevention and access to occupational health services was observed. As such, the plan is grounded on both humanitarian and economically practical grounds.&lt;ref name=who&gt;World Health Organization. ''[http://www.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA60/A60_R26-en.pdf Workers' health: global plan of action]''. Sixtieth World Health Assembly, May 23, 2007. Retrieved September 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workers' health: global plan of action==
The plan of action deals with all aspects of workers' health, including primary prevention of occupational hazards, protection and promotion of health at work, employment conditions, and a better response from health systems to workers' health. It is underpinned by certain common principles. All workers should be able to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and favorable working conditions. The workplace should not be detrimental to health and well-being. Primary prevention of occupational health hazards should be given priority. All components of health systems should be involved in an integrated response to the specific health needs of working populations.&lt;ref name=who /&gt;

==Objectives==
The plan lists several actions for the "member states" that adopt it.

===Devise and implement policy instruments on workers' health===
Countries and member states should formulate their national policy frameworks to promote workers' health, strengthening their ministries of health, and integrating workers' health concerns into national health strategies. They also need to minimize the gaps between different groups of workers in terms of levels of risk and health status. High-risk economic sectors and vulnerable working populations, such as younger and older workers, need special consideration and protection.&lt;ref name=who /&gt;

===Protect and promote health at the workplace===
Member states should improve their health risk management. They must adopt basic occupational health standards and make certain that all workplaces comply with minimum requirements. They must work to promote health and prevent noncommunicable diseases in
the workplace, in particular by advocating healthy diet and physical activity among workers, and promoting mental and family health at work. Additionally, the plan suggests that global health threats, such as tuberculosis, [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[malaria]], and [[avian influenza]], can also be prevented and controlled at the workplace.&lt;ref name=who /&gt;

===Improve the performance of and access to occupational health services===
Member states can improve their coverage and quality of occupational health services by integrating their development into national health strategies, health-sector reforms and plans for improving health systems performance; determining standards for organization and coverage of occupational health services; setting targets for increasing the coverage of the working population with occupational health services; creating mechanisms for pooling resources and for financing the delivery of occupational health services; ensuring sufficient and competent human resources; and establishing quality assurance systems.&lt;ref name=who /&gt;

===Provide and communicate evidence for action and practice===
Member states must design systems for surveillance of workers' health. This includes establishing national information systems, building capability to estimate the occupational burden of diseases and injuries, creating registries of exposure to major risks, occupational accidents and occupational diseases, and improving reporting and early detection of such accidents and diseases. Also strategies and tools need to be elaborated for improving communication and raising awareness about workers' health. They should target workers, employers and their organizations, policy-makers, the general public, and the media.&lt;ref name=who /&gt;

===Incorporate workers' health into other policies===
Measures to protect workers' health should be incorporated in economic development policies and poverty reduction strategies. Employment policies should be designed to influence worker health.&lt;ref name=who /&gt;

==Implementation==
The plan suggests that improving the health of workers can be achieved through well-coordinated efforts of society as a whole, under government leadership and with substantial participation of workers and employers. WHO and its partners express in the plan an intention to work with the member states to promote partnership and joint action with [[ILO]] and other organizations of
the [[United Nations]] system, organizations of employers, trade unions, and other stakeholders in civil society and the private sector in order to strengthen international efforts on workers' health. Also to implement the plan the WHO expects to provide guidelines, promote and monitor their use, and contribute to the adoption and implementation of international labor conventions. The plan of action will be reviewed and monitored using a set of national and international indicators of achievement.&lt;ref name=who /&gt;
