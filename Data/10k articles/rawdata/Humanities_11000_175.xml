      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1854">The '''Académie Suisse''' was an art school founded by Charles Suisse, and was located at the corner of the Quai des Orfévres and the Boulevard du Palais, in Paris. From [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] to [[Cézanne]], most major French artists frequented this place to meet colleagues or to study after the models supplied.

==Charles Suisse==
According to Monneret, Charles Suisse was a former model of [[Jacques-Louis David]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;Probably not to be mixed up with the architect [[Charles Suisse]] (1846-1906), formed at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], and since 1897 head of the ''[http://www.mediatheque-patrimoine.culture.gouv.fr/fr/biographies/suisse_charles.html Monuments historiques] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204054639/http://www.mediatheque-patrimoine.culture.gouv.fr/fr/biographies/suisse_charles.html |date=December 4, 2008 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9327">In [[linguistics]] an '''accidental gap''', also known as a '''gap''', '''accidental lexical gap''', '''lexical gap''', '''lacuna''', or '''hole in the pattern''', is a word or other form that does not exist in some language but which would be permitted by the [[Grammar|grammatical rules]] of the language.&lt;ref name=Crystal&gt;{{Cite book |last=Crystal |first=David |title=A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics |location=Malden |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2003 |isbn=0-6312-2664-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accidental gaps differ from systematic gaps, those words or other forms which do not exist in a language due to the boundaries set by phonological, morphological, and other rules of that specific language.

In English, for example, a word pronounced {{IPA|/pfnk/}} cannot exist because it has no vowels and therefore does not obey the word-formation rules of English. This is a systematic gap. In contrast, a word pronounced {{IPA|/peɪ̯k/}} would obey English word-formation rules, but this is not a word in English. Although theoretically such a word could exist, it does not; its absence is therefore an accidental gap.

Various types of accidental gaps exist. Phonological gaps are either words allowed by the [[phonology|phonological system]] of a language which do not actually exist, or sound contrasts missing from one [[pattern|paradigm]] of the phonological system itself. Morphological gaps are non-existent words potentially allowed by the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological system]]. A semantic gap refers to the non-existence of a word to describe a difference in [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] seen in other sets of words within the language.

==Phonological gaps==

Often words that are allowed in the phonological system of a language are absent. For example, in English the [[consonant cluster]] {{IPA|/spr/}} is allowed at the beginning of words such as ''spread'' or ''spring'' and the [[syllable rime]] {{IPA|/ɪk/}} occurs in words such as ''sick'' or ''flicker''. Even so, there is no English word pronounced *{{IPA|/sprɪk/}}. Although this potential word is phonologically [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] according to English [[phonotactics]], it happens to not exist.&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;{{Cite book |last=Trask |first=Robert Lawrence |title=A Dictionary of Phonetics and Phonology |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "phonological gap" is also used to refer to the absence of a [[phonemic contrast]] in part of the phonological system.&lt;ref name=Crystal/&gt; For example, [[Thai language|Thai]] has several sets of [[stop consonant]]s that differ in terms of [[Voice (phonetics)|voicing]] (whether or not the [[vocal cords]] vibrate) and [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] (whether a puff of air is released). Yet the language has no voiced [[velar consonant]] ({{IPA|/ɡ/}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Abramson |first=Arthur S. |title=The Vowels and Tones of Standard Thai: Acoustical Measurements and Experiments |location=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Research Center in Anthropology, Folklore, and Linguistics |year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of an expected distinction is commonly called a "hole in the pattern".&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

|+ Thai stop consonants
|-
! plain voiceless !! aspirated voiceless !! voiced consonant
|-
| p || pʰ || b
|-
| t || tʰ || d
|-
| k || kʰ || 
|}

==Morphological gaps==

A morphological gap is the absence of a word that could exist given the morphological rules of a language, including its [[affix]]es.&lt;ref name=Crystal/&gt; For example, in English a [[deverbal noun]] can be formed by adding either the suffix ''-al'' or ''-(t)ion'' to certain verbs (typically words from [[Latin language|Latin]] through [[Anglo-Norman French]] or [[Old French]]). Some verbs, such as ''recite'' have two related nouns, ''recital'' and ''recitation''. However, in many cases there is only one such noun, as illustrated in the chart below. Although in principle the morphological rules of English allow for other nouns, those words do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Accidental gap |url=http://www2.let.uu.nl/UiL-OTS/Lexicon/zoek.pl?lemma=Accidental+gap&amp;lemmacode=975 |work=Lexicon of Linguistics |editor1=Kerstens, Johan |editor2=Eddy Ruys |editor3=Joost Zwarts |publisher=Utrecht institute of Linguistics OTS |year=2001 |accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! verb !! noun (''-al'') !! noun (''-ion'')

| recite || recital || recitation
|-
| propose || proposal || proposition
|-
| arrive || arrival || 
|-
| refuse || refusal || 
|-
| derive || || derivation
|-
| describe || || description
|}

{{anchor|Potential word}}Many '''potential words''' that could be made following morphological rules of a language do not enter the [[lexicon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aronoff|first=Mark|year=1983|title=Potential words, actual words, productivity and frequency|journal=Proceedings of the 13th International Congress of Linguists|volume=|pages=163-171}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homonymy blocking'' and ''synonymy blocking'' stop some potential words.&lt;ref name="N+N"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5rIXBZFm3AC|title=Productivity in English Word-formation: An Approach to N+N Compounding|last=Fernández-Domínguez|first=Jesús|date=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|year=|isbn=9783039118083|location=Bern|pages=71-74|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[homonym]] of an existing word may be blocked. For example, the word ''liver'' meaning "someone who lives" is not used because the word ''[[liver]]'' (an internal organ) already exists. Likewise, a potential word can be blocked if it is a [[synonym]] of an existing word. An older, more common word blocks a potential synonym, known as ''token-blocking''. For example, the word ''stealer'' ("someone who steals") remains only a potential word because the word ''[[thief]]'' already exists. Not only individual words, but entire [[word formation]] processes may be blocked. For example, the [[suffix]] ''[[wikt:-ness|-ness]]'' is used to form nouns from adjectives. This [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] word-formation pattern blocks many potential nouns that could be formed with ''[[wikt:-ity|-ity]]''. Nouns such as *''calmity'' (a potential synonym of ''calmness'') and *''darkity'' (cf. ''darkness'') are unused potential words. This is known as ''type-blocking''.&lt;ref name="N+N" /&gt;

A [[defective verb]] is a verb that lacks some [[grammatical conjugation]]. For example, several verbs in [[Russian language|Russian]] do not have a [[Grammatical person|first-person]] [[Grammatical number|singular]] form in [[Present tense|non-past tense]]. Although most verbs have such a form (e.g. ''vožu'' "I lead"), about 100 verbs in the [[Russian grammar#Present-future tense|second conjugation]] pattern (e.g. *''derz'u'' "I talk rudely"; the asterisk indicates [[Grammaticality|ungrammaticality]]) do not appear as first-person singular in the present-future tense.&lt;ref name="Halle"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Halle |first=Morris |year=1973 |title=Prolegomena to a theory of word-formation |journal=Linguistic Inquiry |volume=4 |pages=451–464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris Halle called this defective verb paradigm an example of an accidental gap.

The similar case of [[unpaired word]]s occurs where one word is obsolete or rare while another word [[Derivation (linguistics)|derived]] from it is more common. Examples include *''effable'' and ''ineffable'' or *''kempt'' and ''unkempt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Quinion |first=Michael |title=Unpaired words |work=World Wide Words |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/unpaired.htm |date=23 November 1996 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantic gaps==

A gap in [[semantics]] occurs when a particular meaning distinction visible elsewhere in the lexicon is absent. For example, English words describing family members generally show [[gender]] distinction. Yet the English word ''cousin'' can refer to either a male or female cousin.&lt;ref name=Crystal/&gt; Similarly, while there are general terms for siblings and parents, there is no comparable common gender-neutral term for a parent's sibling or a sibling's child.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=nibling_note&gt;In 1951, [[Samuel Martin (linguist)|Samuel Martin]] coined the word ''[[wikt:nibling#English|nibling]]'', which fills the gap for a gender-neutral single word meaning "sibling's child." It remains a rare word that most English speakers are not familiar with.&lt;/ref&gt; The separate words predicted on the basis of this semantic contrast are absent from the language, or at least from many speakers' dialects.

The '''Aden Site''' is an [[archaeological site]] that is the [[type site]] for the Aden Phase (800-900 CE) of Lower Yazoo Basin [[Coles Creek culture]] chronology. It corresponds to Middle Coles Creek, chronologically between the ''[[Bayland Phase]]'' and ''[[Kings Crossing Phase]]''.

==Location==
The Aden Site is located on the south bank of Jeff Davis Bayou, a mile and a half east of  the [[unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] of [[Valley Park, Mississippi|Valley Park]], [[Issaquena County, Mississippi|Issaquena County]], [[Mississippi]], U.S.A., near coordinates {{coord|32.636969|-90.836339|display=inline,title}}.

==Site description==
The site consists of three [[platform mound]]s making a triangular arrangement surrounding a small [[plaza]], with the fourth side of the plaza bordered by [[Jeff Davis Bayou]]. This is considered to be a typical Coles Creek phase settlement pattern. The largest, designated Mound A, on the eastern border of the plaza is {{convert|3|m|ft}} in height, with the summit surface area measuring {{convert|23|m|ft}} by {{convert|17|m|ft}}. The second largest mound, Mound B on the southern border of the plaza, is {{convert|3.5|m|ft}} high, and measuring {{convert|50|m|ft}} by {{convert|35|m|ft}} at its base. Mound C, located on the western border of the plaza, is {{convert|2|m|ft}} high and {{convert|50|m|ft}} in diameter. Mound C has been heavily degraded by cultivation, and may have been larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Phillips|first =Philip|title=[[Archaeological Survey in the Lower Yazoo Basin, Mississippi, 1949-1955]]|publisher=[[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]]|year=1970|pages=365|authorlink= Philip Phillips (archaeologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aden Phase==
Aden Phase (800-900 CE) is a classification of sites and artifacts of the Cole Creek Culture created by [[Philip Phillips (archaeologist)|Phillip Phillips]].

Aden Phase sites are distributed throughout western Mississippi, in the area east of the Mississippi River and North of the Yazoo River except for the Blackely and Haynes Bluff sites which are along the Southern bank of the Yazoo River.

The original Cole Creek site had become better known as the Gordon site and  was considered an example of the late Gordon period of the Plaquemine culture. Sites such as Greenhouse and French Fork showed evidence of multiple occupations over a long period resulting in pottery that from multiple cultures. The Aden Phase was an attempt to create a new baseline for “classic” Cole Creek Culture which could be then be used as a reference when comparing it to other cultures.

Aden Phase sites are distributed throughout western Mississippi, in the area east of the Mississippi River and North of the Yazoo River except for the Blackely and Haynes Bluff sites which are along the Southern bank of the Yazoo River.

==Aden artifacts==
The Aden Phase was originally represented by the pottery styles identified as Baytown Plain, var. Valley Park; Chevalier Stamped, var Chevalier; Coles Creek Incised, vars. Coles and Wade;  Evansville Punctuated, var. Rhinehart; French Fork Incised, var. Larkin ; Marzique Incised, var. Marzique; and Mulberry Creek Cord Marked, var. Smith Creek. The sites now considered the best examples of “typical” Aden Phase are, in descending order of importance  Coles Creek Incised, vars. Coles Creek, Campbellsville, and Macedonia, and French Fork Incised, var Larkin.

Pottery of the Aden Phase tended towards simple designs; regular shapes, unmodified rims and few appendages. Their surfaces were typically light gray, clouded by firing and bits of white material embedded in the earthenware. Triangular, zig zag and crescents were also present as decoration.

==Settlements==
Aden Phase settlements were the first example of the rectangular shaped mounds that have become a hallmark of Cole Creek Culture settlements, though some sites have older conical mounds from the Bayland phase remained in sites that were continually inhabited since that time. In the Aden Phase, settlements began to be built in a planned fashion with three rectangular mounds of approximately equal size forming a ceremonial center to the town with the three mounds forming three sides of a rectangular space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Phillips|first =Philip|title=[[Archaeological Survey in the Lower Yazoo Basin, Mississippi, 1949-1955]]|publisher=[[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]]|year=1970|pages=552|authorlink= Philip Phillips (archaeologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6701">'''Adventure learning''' is a hybrid [[distance education]] approach defined in 2006 by [[Aaron Doering]] of the [[University of Minnesota]].

== History ==
In the early 1990s, explorers such as [[Will Steger]], [[Dan Buettner]], [[Robert Ballard]], [[Lonnie Dupree]], [[Paul Pregont]], and [[Mille Porsild]] began experimenting with ways to use technology to connect classrooms with their experiences on the trail. The Jason program pushed the envelope of transmitting from the field as they communicated while diving the ocean, and [[Classroom Connect]] generated a comprehensive curriculum and learning objectives tied to the field experiences, drawing in learners with their "student-choose-the-route" approach. Advances were made with Arctic Blast 2001, in which schools were able to collaborate online on tasks within a secure space as well as participate in moderated chats with subject-matter experts using [[Lotus Notes]], [[Sametime Chat]], and [[Quickplaces]], earning the [[IBM Beacon Award]] for best educational use worldwide of [[IBM]] technologies in 2002.

In 2006, [[Aaron Doering]] published the first established definition, framework, and guiding principles of adventure learning. The guiding principles were refined by Doering and Charles Miller in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Doering, A., &amp; Miller, C. (2009). Online learning revisited: Adventure learning 2.0. In C. Crawford et al.

A small-scale Adventure Learning activity and its implications for higher education practice and research. ''education, 16''(1).&lt;/ref&gt; was the GoNorth! Adventure Learning Series of circumpolar Arctic dogsledding expeditions, which reached millions of learners worldwide and explored such topics as sustainability, the environment, science, and traditional cultures. Other examples of adventure learning projects include Earthducation, the Jason Project, Ride To Learn with the To Learn Series, and the Quest series of bicycle treks.

Department of History, University of Pennsylvania. Accessed 23 July 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; where he taught the intellectual history of the 17th and 18th centuries. He has received both the Lindback Foundation Award and the Ira Abrams Memorial Award for distinguished college teaching. Kors graduated A.B. [[summa cum laude]] at [[Princeton University]] in 1964, and received his M.A. (1965) and Ph.D. (1968) in European history at [[Harvard University]].
==Career==
Kors has written on the history of [[skepticism|skeptical]], [[atheism|atheistic]], and [[materialism|materialist]] thought in 17th and 18th-century [[France]], on the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in general, on the history of European [[witchcraft]] beliefs, and on academic freedom. He was also the Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment, which was published in four volumes by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://global.oup.com/academic/product/encyclopedia-of-the-enlightenment-9780195104301?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;

Kors co-founded – with [[civil rights]] advocate [[Harvey A. Silverglate]] – and served from 2000 to 2006{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} as chairman of the board of directors of the [[Foundation for Individual Rights in Education]] (FIRE).

He writes pieces for both [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and conservative journals on political matters.  He is an occasional contributor to ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/contrib/show/202.html "Alan Charles Kors." ''Reason''. Accessed 14 March 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; His essay "Can There Be An After Socialism?" was published by the journal ''Social Philosophy &amp; Policy''.&lt;ref&gt;"Social Philosophy &amp; Policy," 2003: Cambridge University Press, pp. 1–17&lt;/ref&gt;

Kors has also been active in the defense of [[free speech]] since his arrival at [[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]]. In the widely covered 1993 "[[water buffalo incident]]", he defended [[Eden Jacobowitz]] against charges that he harassed a group of black sorority sisters. In the early morning hours, as the sorority was celebrating loudly outside the dorms, multiple students yelled from their windows, in various ways, for the sorority to cease. When the police came to question students, Jacobowitz volunteered that he yelled "Shut up, you water buffalo", a slur that was characterized as racist. The sorority members eventually dropped the charges.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Kors later defended another University of Pennsylvania student in 2005 during a controversy surrounding the student's right to take a photo of other University students having sex against a dorm window.&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Pennsylvania controversy]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erinoconnor.org/archives/2005/12/more_on_penn_fr.html Critical Mass]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 President [[George H. W. Bush]] named him to the Council of the National Endowment of the Humanities. He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] and served on the committee for six years.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In 2005, President [[George W. Bush]] awarded Kors the [[National Humanities Medal]] for his "scholarship, devotion to the Humanities, and...defense of academic freedom." In 2006, he was the T.B. Davie Memorial Lecturer on academic freedom at the [[University of Cape Town]], [[South Africa]].

He has served on the boards of The Historical Society and the [[American Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies]] and currently serves as a [[Visitor]] of [[Ralston College]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ralston.ac/ Ralston College]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apple and Orange - they do not compare.jpg|right|thumb|An apple and an orange]]
[[File:Paul Cézanne 179.jpg|Right|thumb|''Apples and Oranges'', by [[Paul Cézanne]].]]

A comparison of '''apples and oranges''' occurs when two items or groups of items are compared that cannot be practically compared.

The [[idiom]], ''comparing apples and oranges'', refers to the apparent differences between items which are popularly thought to be incomparable or [[unit commensurability|incommensurable]], such as [[apple]]s and [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s. The idiom may also be used to indicate that a [[false analogy]] has been made between two items, such as where an ''apple'' is faulted for not being a good ''orange''.

==Variants==
{{multiple issues|
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
{{original research|section|date=August 2014}}}}
The idiom is not unique to English. In [[Quebec French]], it may take the form ''comparer des pommes avec des oranges'' (to compare apples and oranges), while in European French the idiom says ''comparer des pommes et des poires'' (to compare apples and pears). In [[Latin America]]n Spanish, it is usually ''comparar papas y boniatos'' (comparing potatoes and sweet potatoes) or commonly for all [[Spanish dialects and varieties|varieties of Spanish]] ''comparar peras con manzanas'' (comparing pears and apples). In some other languages the term for 'orange' derives from 'apple', suggesting not only that a direct comparison between the two is possible, but that it is implicitly present in their names. Fruit other than apples and oranges can also be compared; for example, apples and [[pear]]s are compared in [[Danish language|Danish]], Dutch, German, Spanish, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], Italian, [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. In fact, in the Spanish-speaking world, a common idiom is ''sumar peras con manzanas'', that is, ''to add pears and apples''; the same thing applies in Italian (''sommare le mele con le pere'') and Romanian (''a aduna merele cu perele''). In Portuguese, the expression is ''comparar laranjas com bananas'' (compare orange to banana).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/esportes/osorio-sobre-o-pan-e-as-olimpiadas-estao-comparando-banana-com-laranja-bxxxe6v1cotxnsrh5vowm64pa Olimpíadas: "Estão comparando banana com laranja"], ''Gazeta do Povo'', 15 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In Czech, the idiom ''míchat jablka s hruškami'' literally means 'to mix apples and pears'.

[[Image:Apples.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Not all apples are alike.]]

Some languages use completely different items, such as the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''Поредити бабе и жабе'' (comparing grandmothers and toads), or the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''baba şi mitraliera'' (the grandmother and the machine gun); ''vaca şi izmenele'' (the cow and the longjohns); or ''țiganul şi carioca'' (the gypsy and the marker), or the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''mor wahanol â mêl a menyn'' (as different as honey and butter), while some languages compare dissimilar properties of dissimilar items. For example, an equivalent [[Danish language|Danish]] idiom, ''Hvad er højest, [[Rundetårn]] eller et tordenskrald?'' means "What is highest, the Round Tower or a thunderclap?", referring to the size of the former and the sound of the latter. In [[Russian language|Russian]], the phrase ''сравнивать тёплое с мягким'' (to compare warm and soft) is used. In [[Argentina]], a common question is ''¿En qué se parecen el amor y el ojo del hacha?'' (What do love and the eye of an axe have in common?) and emphasizes dissimilarity between two subjects; in [[Colombia]], a similar (though more rude) version is common: ''confundir la mierda con la pomada'' (to confuse shit with ointment). In Polish, the expression ''co ma piernik do wiatraka?'' is used, meaning "What has (is) gingerbread to a windmill?". In Chinese, a phrase that has the similar meaning is 风马牛不相及 (fēng mǎ niú bù xiāng jí), literally meaning "horses and cattles won't mate with each other", and later used to describe things that are totally unrelated and incomparable.

A number of more exaggerated comparisons are sometimes made, in cases in which the speaker believes the two objects being compared are radically different. For example, "oranges with orangutans", "apples with dishwashers", and so on. In English, different fruits, such as pears, plums, or lemons are sometimes substituted for oranges in this context.

Sometimes the two words sound similar, for example, Romanian ''merele cu perele'' (apples and pears) and the Hungarian ''szezont a fazonnal'' (the season with the fashion).

==Published comparisons==
===Scientific===
[[Image:OrangeBloss wb.jpg|thumb|right|Oranges, like apples, grow on trees.]]
At least two [[tongue-in-cheek]] scientific studies have been conducted on the subject, each of which concluded that apples can be compared with oranges fairly easily and on a low budget and the two fruits are quite similar.

The first study, conducted by Scott A. Sandford of the [[NASA Ames Research Center]], used [[infrared spectroscopy]] to analyze both apples and oranges. The study, which was published in the satirical science magazine ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'', concluded: "[...] the comparing apples and oranges defense should no longer be considered valid. This is a somewhat startling revelation. It can be anticipated to have a dramatic effect on the strategies used in arguments and discussions in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Scott A.|last=Sandford|url=https://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume1/v1i3/air-1-3-apples.html|title=Apples and Oranges -- A Comparison|magazine=[[Annals of Improbable Research]]|volume=1|issue=3|date=1995|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second study, written by [[Stamford Hospital]]'s [[surgeon]]-in-chief James Barone and published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]],'' noted that the phrase ''apples and oranges'' was appearing with increasing frequency in the medical literature, with some notable articles comparing "[[Desflurane]] and [[propofol]]" and "[[Salmeterol]] and [[ipratropium]]" with "apples and oranges". The study also found that both apples and oranges were sweet, similar in size, weight, and shape, that both are grown in [[orchard]]s, and both may be eaten, juiced, and so on. The only significant differences found were in terms of [[seed]]s (the study used seedless oranges), the involvement of [[Johnny Appleseed]], and color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comparing apples and oranges: a randomised prospective study|first=James E|last=Barone|journal=British Medical Journal|year=2000|volume=321|issue=7276|page=1569|doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1569|pmc=27565|pmid=11124178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Annals of Improbable Research'' subsequently noted that the "earlier investigation was done with more depth, more rigour, and, most importantly, more expensive equipment" than the ''British Medical Journal'' study.&lt;ref name="improbable"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrahams|first1=Marc|title=Apples and oranges have previously been shown to be remarkably similar|journal=BMJ|date=14 April 2001|volume=322|issue=7291|pages=931|pmc=1120087|pmid=11334040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
On [[April Fools' Day]] 2014, ''[[The Economist]]'' compared worldwide production of apples and oranges from 1983 to 2013, however noted them to be "unrelated variables".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/04/daily-chart|title=Daily chart: Comparing apples with oranges|work=The Economist|date=1 April 2014|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In teaching the use of units==
{{unreferenced-section|date=April 2017}}
While references to comparing apples and oranges are often a [[rhetorical device]], references to adding apples and oranges are made in the case of teaching students the proper uses of [[units of measurement|units]]. Here, the admonition not to "add apples and oranges" refers to the requirement that two quantities with different units may not be combined by addition, although they may always be [[dimensional analysis#Dimensional homogeneity|combined in ratio form by multiplication]], so that multiplying ratios of apples and oranges is allowed. Similarly, the concept of this distinction is often used [[metaphor]]ically in [[elementary algebra]].

The admonition is really more of a [[mnemonic]], since in general counts of objects have no intrinsic unit and, for example, a number count of apples may be dimensionless or have dimension ''fruit''; in either of these two cases, apples and oranges may indeed be added.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9536">The archaeological heritage of Sri Lanka is divided in to three ages as [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] (Stone age), [[Protohistory|Protohistoric]] (Iron age) and historical periods. The presence of man activities in Sri Lanka probably dates from 75,000 years ago (late [[Pleistocene]] period). Prehistoric sites which are presently identified in the country are distributed from the maritime belt and the lowland plains of the wet and dry zones to the high plateaus and rain forest in the central and south western mountain region of the island. The protohistoric period expands from about 1000 BC to the historical period at about 500 BC. The main indicators of the distribution of protohistoric and early settlements in the island are the [[Megalith|megalithic]] burials and [[Pottery|pottery]] sites. 

The beginning of the historical period of Sri Lanka is traditionally assigned to the reign of king [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|Devanampiya Tissa]] (307–267 BC) when the [[Buddhism]] was introduced to Sri Lanka by the missionaries sent by the Indian emperor [[Ashoka]]. However the first clear information about the establishment of building and structures are dated back to the time of king [[Pandukabhaya of Anuradhapura|Pandukabhaya]] (437–367 BC).

Sri Lanka's political and religious history is mainly set out by the ancient [[Chronicle|chronicles]] as well as over 4,000 [[Monumental inscription|stone inscriptions]] from 3rd century BC onward. Which give the history in considerable detail from the 3rd century and less reliably back to the 6th century BC.

Sri Lanka has more than 250,000 identified archaeological sites throughout the country&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Department of Archeology|url=http://www.archaeology.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=54&amp;lang=en|publisher=[[Department of Archaeology (Sri Lanka)|Sri Lanka archaeological department]]|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some of them have been declared as archaeological reserves and protected monuments by the [[Department of Archaeology (Sri Lanka)|Sri Lanka archaeological department]]. Archaeological reserves are the sites consist of archaeological remains which are under the direct control of the archaeological department. Protected monuments are privately owned but scheduled under section 18 of the Antiquities Ordinance No.09 of 1940. 
{{TOC right}}

==Declaration of monuments==
According to the sections 16, 17, 18 and 19 of the Antiquities Ordinance No.09 of 1940, the minister who is the in charge of the subject may declare the ancient monuments by notification published in the government [[The Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka|Gazette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploration and Documentation Division#Declaring of Ancient Monuments|url=http://www.archaeology.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=75&amp;Itemid=82&amp;lang=en|publisher=[[Department of Archaeology (Sri Lanka)|Sri Lanka archaeological department]]|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also under sections 16, 17 and 19, ancient buildings and trees on state or private lands, may be declared as ancient monuments to provide safety and protection for them.

Ancient construction with historical and archaeological value which are over 100 years of age can also be declared as ancient monuments in terms of the provisions of the Antiquities (amendment) Act No. 24 of 1988.

[[File:Pantographia.jpg|right|thumb|250px|'''Bastarda type''' in Fry's ''{{lang|la|[[Pantographia]]}}'']]

'''Bastarda''' (or bastard) was a [[blackletter]] script used in France, the Burgundian Netherlands and Germany during the 14th and 15th centuries. The Burgundian variant of script can be seen as the court script of the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]] and was used to produce some of the most magnificent manuscripts of the 15th century.

The early printers produced regional versions in type which were used especially to print texts in the vernacular languages, more rarely for Latin texts. The earliest bastarda type was produced by the German [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]] in 1454–55. The main variety was the one used in France,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} which was also found in Geneva, Antwerp and London {{explain|date=November 2017|reason=why just London?}}. Another local variety was found in the Netherlands; [[William Caxton|Caxton]]'s first types were a rather poor copy of this{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. The French ''{{lang|fr|lettre bâtarde}}'' passed out of use by the mid-16th century but the German variety developed into the national ''{{lang|de|[[Fraktur]]}}'' type which remained in use until the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;A.F.Johnson, ''Type designs, their history and development''. Third edition. (London: 1966) pp.21–23&lt;/ref&gt;

British typeface designer [[Jonathan Barnbrook]] has designed a contemporary interpretation titled [[Bastard (typeface)|Bastard]].

'''Anna Emmaline McDoulet''', known as '''Cattle Annie''' (November 29, 1882 - November 7, 1978),&lt;ref name=fgrave&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/48364497|title=Anna Emmaline "Cattle Annie" McDoulet Roach|publisher=findagrave.com|accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a young American [[outlaw]] in the American [[Old West]], most associated with Jennie Stevens, or [[Little Britches (outlaw)|Little Britches]]. Their exploits are known in part through the fictional film ''[[Cattle Annie and Little Britches]]'' (1981), [[Film director|directed]] by [[Lamont Johnson]] and starring [[Amanda Plummer]] in her film debut as Cattle Annie, with [[Diane Lane]] as Little Britches.

Cattle Annie and Little Britches were [[Sharpshooter|crack shot]]s with both pistol and rifle, but today they are mostly unknown outside of the film. Yet they were once among the most recognized names among outlaws in the [[Oklahoma Territory|Oklahoma]] and [[Indian Territory|Indian]] territories, where they carried out their short-lived criminal ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/la2/daydreams2/CATTLEANNIE.html|title=Cattle Annie's page|publisher=angelfire.com|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embracing the criminal element==

Anna was born in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] in [[Douglas County, Kansas|Douglas County]] in eastern [[Kansas]],&lt;ref name=fgrave/&gt;  one of eight children of James C. and Rebekah McDoulet. When Anna was four years old, the family moved to [[Coyville, Kansas|Coyville]] in [[Wilson County, Kansas|Wilson County]], in southeastern Kansas. Anna worked as a hotel dishwasher and performed other odd jobs. When she was twelve, the family moved to the [[Otoe Reservation]] near [[Skiatook, Oklahoma|Skiatook]] north of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] in the northern Oklahoma Territory, where she turned outlaw. Annie and Little Britches followed tales of the [[Bill Doolin]] gang from reading [[dime novel]]ists like [[Ned Buntline]], who became famous for his mostly fictional account of [[Buffalo Bill|Buffalo Bill Cody]] as a western frontier hero and showman.&lt;ref name=lbrit/&gt;

For two years, Cattle Annie and Little Britches roamed the former Indian Territory, often working together and at other times alone. They stole horses, sold alcohol to the  [[Osage Nation|Osage]] and [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]], and warned outlaw gangs whenever law-enforcement officers were nearby. They wore men's clothing and packed pistols on their hips. Their adventures netted headlines from [[Guthrie, Oklahoma|Guthrie]], the capital of the former Oklahoma Territory, to [[Coffeyville, Kansas|Coffeyville]] in southeastern Kansas,&lt;ref name=lbrit/&gt; where the [[Dalton gang]] attempted to rob two banks simultaneously on October 5, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/daltons.htm|title=The Dalton Gang's Last Raid, 1892|publisher=eyewitnesstohistory.com|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U.S. Marshal]] Steve Burke captured 13-year-old Cattle Annie climbing from a window in 1895.  (Marshal  [[Bill Tilghman]] had a more difficult task apprehending Little Britches, who engaged in a physical confrontation with the famous lawman before he took her into  custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5KLrfdOrI78C&amp;pg=PA325&amp;lpg=PA325&amp;dq=the+outlaw+Little+Britches&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Jt_LI8Fv2D&amp;sig=nzalsFlyseWK7S1pYfrnv_f_fIE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qrLbUPaBM8y_2QXIu4D4CA&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20outlaw%20Little%20Britches&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters, p. 325|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] at [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], [[Oklahoma]] (1979)|ISBN=978-0-8061-2335-6|accessdate=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Annie was sentenced to one year in the [[Massachusetts Correctional Institution – Framingham|Massachusetts Correctional Institution]] in [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]]. Because of health issues, she was soon paroled. She remained in Framingham for some time, having informed corrections officers that, if she returned to Oklahoma, she would likely have fallen  back into her criminal ways. In 1898, she was working as a housekeeper for Mrs. Mary Daniels in [[Sherborn, Massachusetts|Sherborn]] in [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]] south of Framingham.  A few months later, she may have moved to [[New York City]], where she may have died of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name=lbrit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranchdivaoutfitters.com/cattleannielittlebritches.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117175134/http://www.ranchdivaoutfitters.com/cattleannielittlebritches.html|archive-date=January 17, 2012|title=Cattle Annie &amp; Little Britches|publisher=ranchdivaoutfitters.com|accessdate=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Another scenario==

Another legitimate report claims that Annie left Framingham to return to Oklahoma where she wed Earl Frost of [[Perry, Oklahoma|Perry]] on March 13, 1901. The couple had two sons, Robert C. Frost (1903-1993) of Oklahoma City  and Carlos D. Frost, later of [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], [[California]]. The Frosts divorced in [[Noble County, Oklahoma|Noble County]], Oklahoma in October 1909, probably because Annie had joined a [[Wild West show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/C/CA075.html |title=CATTLE ANNIE (Anna Emmaline McDoulet,1882-1978) |publisher=digital.library.okstate.edu |accessdate=August 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208074059/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/C/CA075.html |archivedate=February 8, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical museum in [[Guthrie, Oklahoma|Guthrie]] maintains that, soon after the divorce from Frost, Annie married Whitmore R. Roach (1879-1947), a [[Texas]] native, veteran of [[World War I]], and painting contractor in  [[Oklahoma City]], where they lived after 1912. They had resided from 1910 to 1912 in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. This "Emma McDoulet Roach" is interred at Rose Hill Burial Park in Oklahoma City. She died in 1978, just short of her 96th birthday. Her newspaper obituary makes no mention of her early days or even the first name "Anna" but instead refers to "Emma", the shortened form of "Emmaline". The obituary indicates that she had been a bookkeeper in her later working career. Her services were held in her home church, Olivet [[Baptist]]  in Oklahoma City.&lt;ref name=fgrave/&gt;

Meanwhile, Little Britches also served a short sentence at the reformatory in Framingham, but her whereabouts thereafter are unknown.&lt;ref name=lbrit/&gt; Some reports indicate that Little Britches returned to Tulsa, where she was married, had a family, and led an exemplary life.&lt;ref&gt;Coincidentally, Annie's daughter-in-law, Esther Mae Frost (1907-1983), the wife of Robert C. Frost, had the maiden name of "Plummer", the last name of the actress who played Annie in the film.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

===Film===
Johnson's film, ''Cattle Annie and Little Britches'' (1981), features [[Burt Lancaster]] as an historically inaccurate and much older Bill Doolin, [[Rod Steiger]] as Marshal William Tilghman, [[Scott Glenn]] as [[William M. Dalton|Bill Dalton]], and [[Buck Taylor]], particularly known to audiences as the blacksmith-turned-deputy Newly O'Brien on [[CBS]]'s ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', as the outlaw [[Wild Bunch#Members|Dynamite Dick]], presumably  [[Dan Clifton]], called "Dynamite Dan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082145/fullcredits|title=''Cattle Annie and Little Britches''|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16682">In keeping with the [[Paris Principles]] definition of a child soldier, the Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative defines a ''child pirate''' as any person below 18 years of age who is or who has been recruited or used by a [[pirate]] gang in any capacity, including children - boys and/or girls - used as gunmen in boarding parties, hostage guards, negotiators, ship captains, messengers, spies or for sexual purposes, whether at sea or on land.  It does not only refer to a child who is taking or has taken a direct part in kinetic criminal operations.

Children may volunteer to participate in piratical activities (usually on account of socioeconomic desperation, familial suggestion or peer influence) or they may be forcibly abducted by piratical gangs.

== Causes  ==

There are a number of reasons why an adult pirate commander would view children as being of significant tactical value.  These perceptions render children vulnerable to abduction or forced recruitment.  As noted by Carl Conradi:

:"Like warlords, pirate commanders recruit children because they are vulnerable and easily manipulated; fearless and ignorant of the long-term consequences of their actions; inexpensive to maintain; plentiful in developing countries most afflicted by piracy; small in stature and therefore nimble; easily indoctrinated; largely invulnerable to legal proceedings; and because they pose a moral challenge to their enemies."&lt;ref name="navalreview"&gt;http://www.navalreview.ca/2013/02/the-invisible-phenomenon-of-child-piracy/&lt;/ref&gt;”

In other cases, children may volunteer to participate in piratical activities.  However, as asserted by the Canada-based [[Roméo Dallaire]] Child Soldiers Initiative, "'voluntary' enlistment must be understood in terms of the limited choices and circumstances that may exist in the context of a particular country."&lt;ref name="childsoldiers"&gt;http://www.childsoldiers.org/files/publications/2012-DMPP-Children-Youth-Marine-Piracy.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;’  If a child is extremely poor, has been displaced from his or her home, has been separated from his or her family, has limited educational opportunities or has been exposed to conflict, there is an increased likelihood that he or she will view piracy as a legitimate vehicle for social advancement.

== National and international mechanisms and laws ==

In the absence of specific international legislation on juvenile maritime piracy, the precise age of a child’s criminal responsibility when committing piratical acts differs from country to country.  There are, however, a number of international conventions pertaining to either maritime law or children’s rights that may provide some guidance as to the proper handling of child pirates.

=== United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  ===

While the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS, 1982) does not discuss children’s involvement in maritime criminal activities, it does provide a clear definition of piracy.  According to Article 101, piracy is:

:a) any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft, and directed:
:::i. on the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft;
:::ii. against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any State;
:b) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft;
:c) any act of inciting or intentionally facilitating an act described in subparagraph (a) or (b).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part7.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

UNCLOS does recognise universal jurisdiction over the crime of piracy but it only applies to criminal acts that take place on international waters.  If an act of piracy occurs within a country’s territorial waters, it is a matter of state jurisdiction and prosecution.

=== International Labour Organisation Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention ===

Article 3 of the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] (No. 182, 1999) stipulates that:

:…the term the worst forms of child labour comprises:

:a) all forms of [[slavery]] or practices similar to slavery, such as the sale and [[trafficking of children]], [[debt bondage]] and [[serfdom]] and forced or [[Unfree labour|compulsory labour]], including forced or compulsory [[Military use of children|recruitment of children for use in armed conflict]];
:b) the use, procuring or offering of a child for [[Prostitution of children|prostitution]], for the production of pornography or for pornographic performances;
:c) the use, procuring or offering of a child for illicit activities, in particular for the production and trafficking of drugs defined in the relevant international treaties;
:d) work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C182&lt;/ref&gt;

Insofar as participation in any form of maritime criminality is dangerous (and indeed, potentially lethal), child piracy clearly constitutes a worst form of child labour.

According to the Convention, a child is any person who is below the age of 18.

As of April 2013, eight countries had not signed ILO Convention No. 182.  These include Cuba, Eritrea, India, the Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Palau, Somalia and Tuvalu.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11310:0::NO:11310:P11310_INSTRUMENT_ID:312327:NO&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of these countries – India and Somalia – are currently detaining and prosecuting alleged child pirates.

=== United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child ===

Like ILO Convention No. 182, Article 1 of the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unicef-irc.org/portfolios/crc.html&lt;/ref&gt; (1990) specifies that a child is any human being below the age of 18 years.  However, the same article adds a caveat to the effect that a country’s minimum age of criminal responsibility may be lower than 18, as stipulated by national law.

Other sections that may have some bearing upon the status of child pirates include Article 6, in which, “States Parties recognize that every child has the inherent right to life,” and that, “States Parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child.”

Article 19(1) affirms that, “States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.”  This clause may be particularly relevant in cases where a child’s parents have forced him or her to participate in piratical activity, or where the State is responsible for detaining, interrogating, trying and/or incarcerating a captured child pirate.

Article 32(1) echoes ILO Convention No. 182 by stipulating that, “States Parties recognize the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education, or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.”

Article 35 says that, “State Parties shall take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the abduction of, the sale of or traffic in children for any purpose or in any form.”  When a piratical gang permanently separates a child from his or her family, this may constitute an act of child trafficking.

Article 37(a) affirms that, “No child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age.”  Likewise, Article 37(c) states that, “Every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or her age.  In particular, every child deprived of liberty shall be separated from adults unless it is considered in the child’s best interests not to do so and shall have the right to maintain contact with his or her family through correspondence and visits, save in exceptional circumstances.”

Lastly, Article 39 stipulates that, “State Parties shall take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of: any form of neglect, exploitation or abuse; torture or any other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; or armed conflicts.  Such recovery and reintegration shall take place in an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child.”

=== Other regional mechanisms and conventions ===

The third version of the ''Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy off the Coast of Somalia and in the Arabian Sea Area&lt;ref&gt;http://www.secure-marine.com/bmp3/bpm3_pdf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;'' (June 2010) recommends a sample follow-up report that should be filled by the captain of any vessel that has come under pirate attack.  While the report does solicit certain details concerning the offending raiding party – such as the number of constituent pirate members, their physical appearance and the weapons that were used – it does not ask for the estimated ages of pirates.

The [[Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia]] (ReCAAP) is a multilateral pact that facilitates information sharing between signatory countries.  The reporting mechanism that it establishes does not specifically call for the collection of disaggregated data pertaining to the ages of captured pirates.

According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, the UN [[Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia]] is in the midst of drafting an apprehension and transfer protocol for juvenile pirates who are captured by international navies operating in the Horn of Africa region.

=== National laws and judicial mechanisms ===

All three of the main Somali sub-regions (i.e., [[Somalia|South-Central]], [[Puntland]] and [[Somaliland]]) have signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with the governments of Mauritius and the Seychelles, allowing for the transfer of convicted pirates to prison facilities in Somalia.  These MoUs, however, do not specify clear standard operating procedures for processing and/or transferring pirates who are determined to be under the age of 18.  Kenya is also trying suspected Somali pirates but no prisoner transfer agreement is currently in place.

According to UNICEF-Somalia, some 100 child pirates are currently being detained in a prison in [[Bosaso]], Puntland.  A second prison for juvenile pirates with a capacity of 100 is being built in [[Garoowe]], while a 70-person prison for juvenile pirates is being built in Somaliland.

The Republic of Somaliland’s Juvenile Justice Law (2007) raised the age of criminal responsibility for 14 to 15 years and established separate judicial mechanisms for minors, such as child-specific courts of first instance and appellate courts.  However, Somaliland’s Law on Combating Piracy (2012) does not make any specific reference to persons under the age of 18.

The Somali sub-region of Puntland does not have any specific legislation pertaining to child protection, though as of April 2013, a policy on orphans and other vulnerable children had been tabled in Parliament.

India’s Piracy Bill (2012) does not make any specific reference to persons under the age of 18.

== Incidences ==

=== Nigeria ===

According to the Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative:

:"In Nigeria, young unemployed men, in particular, are frequently enticed into the organized pirate gangs operating in the Delta region by “…promised riches, fancy cars, luxury goods and weapons,” such that these gangs are increasingly composed of younger members.  It has also become recognized that in Nigeria, social mobility and the struggle for survival now necessitate the use of violence as “…society gradually stopped recognizing merit and force became a plausible avenue to the top of social and economic strata with drug trafficking, smuggling and other perceived moneymaking ventures like armed robbery, seen as ways to get rich quickly."&lt;ref name="childsoldiers" /&gt;”’

=== Somalia ===

One of the most egregious instances of child maritime piracy off the coast of Somalia is recounted on the Canadian Naval Review’s Broadsides forum:

:"In March 2011, Indian naval forces operating in the Arabian Sea captured the Mozambique-flagged fishing vessel ''Vega 5''.  Somali pirates had kidnapped the trawler’s original crew several months earlier.  They subsequently refurbished the stolen craft into an operationally significant "mothership".  Of the 61 marauders who were arrested during the Indian raid, an astonishing 25 persons – or some 40% of the entire crew – were determined to be under the age of 15.  Indeed, ensuring reports revealed that four of the pirates could not have been older than 11."&lt;ref name="navalreview" /&gt;'

The ''Vega 5'' hijacking does not appear to be an isolated incident.  The Broadsides article continues to report that:

:"During a recent visit to the autonomous Somali region of Puntland, former UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, Ms. [[Radhika Coomaraswamy]], was told by a jailed adult pirate that his colleagues and superiors were increasingly reliant upon child recruits when attempting seize ships for ransom.  Many of the adults who are responsible for directing piracy operations only do so from their homes on land, rather than from motherships on the high seas.  As such, according to Ms. Coomaraswamy, the individuals actually sent out to, "…do the dangerous stuff are the young children, between the ages of 15, 16 and 17."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabnews.com/node/360064&lt;/ref&gt;"'

The Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative has determined that a significant proportion of those Somali pirates who are currently being tried internationally are actually under the age of 18.  In India, 38 out of 61 pirates (62%) facing trial are juveniles; in Germany, 3 out of 10 (30%) are children; and in the United States of America, all three Somali pirates currently facing trial are under the age of 18.&lt;ref name="childsoldiers" /&gt;

=== Sri Lanka ===

The Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative has noted that:&lt;ref name="childsoldiers" /&gt;

:"As part of its military strategy, the [[LTTE]] [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] maintained “…the most comprehensive naval networks among the [US-designated] foreign terrorist organizations&lt;ref name="asiantribune"&gt;http://www.asiantribune.com/?q=node/16950&lt;/ref&gt;…”.  This branch of operations, called the [[Sea Tigers]], launched a multitude of attacks upon international cargo ships, including several – such as the Greek-registered freighter ''Stillus Limassul'' – that were carrying weapons to be used by the Sri Lankan military.&lt;ref name="asiantribune" /&gt;  Like its army, the LTTE’s naval branch actively recruited and deployed child soldiers.  Indeed, there is evidence that during periods of LTTE-sponsored disarmament of child soldiers, underage members of the Sea Tigers were surreptitiously retained, as they had frequently received resource-intensive training that made them particularly strong military assets."&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, C. L. (2006). ''Child Recruitment in South Asian Conflicts''. Chatham House (The Royal Institute of International Affairs): UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also very common for “…very young Tamils (some as young as 13) [to be] pressed into service to fill the [naval] ranks as the long-running insurgency depleted LTTE manpower.&lt;ref&gt;Povlock, P. A. (2011, September 9). 'A Guerilla War at Sea: The Sri Lankan Civil War'. ''Small Wars Journal''. Retrieved from http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/a-guerilla-war- at-sea-the-sri-lankan-civil-war.&lt;/ref&gt;”'

A '''cultural district''' is traditionally conceived as a well-recognized, labeled, [[mixed-use]] area of a [[Human settlement|settlement]] in which a high concentration of cultural facilities serves as the anchor of attraction.

A debate has emerged on the concept of the cultural district, promoting potentially ground-breaking initiatives, even if most of the literature has concentrated on urban clusters, cities of art and cities of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Creative cities, cultural clusters and local economic development|author1=Cooke, P. |author2= Lazzeretti, L. |last-author-amp=yes |publisher = Edward Elgar|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Cheltenham|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Tourism, creativity and development|last = Richards, G., &amp; Wilson, J. (Eds.)|first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2007|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facilities include: [[performance]] spaces, [[museums]], [[art museum|galleries]], artist studios, arts-related retail shops, music or media production studios, dance studios, high schools or colleges for the arts, libraries, [[arboretum]]s and gardens.{{fact|date=January 2017}}
Because they are [[mixed-use development]]s, cultural districts incorporate other facilities such as office complexes, [[retail]] spaces and, occasionally, [[residential area]]s.

The creation of a cultural district implies [[collaboration]] between the arts and the local community. Cultural districts may be seen by local authorities as a way to revitalize the “brownfields” of the urban core: areas of abandoned buildings that encourage businesses and residents to leave the [[citie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artsusa.org/information_services/research/impact_areas/arts_environments/001.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201051356/http://www.artsusa.org//information_services/research/impact_areas/arts_environments/001.asp |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }} Cultural Districts, Americans for the Arts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Districts, ‘The Arts as a Strategy for Revitalizing our Cities’, Americans for the Arts, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The developing theory of cultural districts increasingly conceives them as development models for local systems, where the term ‘district’ refers to supra-urban area.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Learning to design cultural districts and learning from designing them|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09654313.2015.1133565|journal = European Planning Studies|date = 2016-01-19|issn = 0965-4313|pages = 1–19|volume = 0|issue = 0|doi = 10.1080/09654313.2015.1133565|first = Alberto|last = Francesconi|first2 = Claudia|last2 = Dossena}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sacco, P.

Such a linear top-down approach to analysis and design, however, exhibits many limitations when used for organizational settings characterized by a complex web of interdependencies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The view of a cultural district as a complex adaptive system suggests new ideas and approaches for policy-makers, designers and managers. It also opens up debate on issues of organizational design and change.

==United States activities==
More than 90 cities in the [[United States]] have planned or implemented cultural districts, positioning the arts at the center of their urban revitalization efforts.{{fact|date=January 2017}}
All cultural districts are unique, reflecting their cities’ unique environment, including history of land use, urban growth and cultural development. There is no standard model.
Most cultural districts are built to take advantage of other city attractions such as historic features, [[Convention (meeting)|convention]] spaces and parks and other natural [[amenities]].

Structural considerations within or near the district, [[community]] leadership and social forces all influence the development of a cultural district and the type of [[district]] that results. Factors influencing the siting of cultural districts include: perceived need for urban revitalization, existing investment, property value and preexisting cultural facilities.

Unlike a cultural center or a [[shopping mall]], a cultural district comprises a large number of property owners, both public and private, who control the various properties involved, hence a structural [[complexity]]. The [[effectiveness]] of the coordinating agency in guiding the direction of the cultural district varies according to its size, budget, mandated functions and degree of authority, resulting in widespread variation in the coordinated cultural programming and administration services offered by cultural districts. The coordinated [[Government agency|agency]] appointed for the district must work carefully to ensure inclusiveness of concerns and to balance potentially conflicting interests.

Cultural districts offer two major types of [[tertiary sector of the economy|service]]s: one targets the arts community, providing [[marketing]] /promotion, [[box office]] services and property management; the other targets the district’s business and property owners, offering urban [[design]] and development services or administrative support.

The excitement and attraction of a cultural district is a high mixture of interesting things to do, places to see, and places to visit (both cultural and noncultural), across the day and evening.

Some artist-activists are promoting the concept of a "Naturally Occurring Cultural District," or NOCD, patterned after the demographic concept of a [[naturally occurring retirement community]]. A NOCD "supports existing neighborhood cultural assets rather than imposing arts institutions somewhere new," according to Tamara Greenfield, co-director of NOCD-New York. Co-director Caron Atlas explained: "If a cultural district has emerged 'naturally,' then it grows from, builds on and validates existing community assets rather than importing assets from outside a community."&lt;ref&gt;Urban Omnibus, [http://urbanomnibus.net/2010/11/naturally-occurring-cultural-districts/ Naturally Occurring Cultural Districts], Nov. 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, different conceptions of cultural districts include self-organization and emergence in different degrees (e.g. Lazzeretti, 2003; Le Blanc, 2010; Sacco et al., 2013; Stern &amp; Seifert, 2007). Many authors argue that districtualization is essentially spontaneous and that the conditions for formation can be recognized and sustained, not created from the top.&lt;ref name="Lazzeretti 635–648"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = City of art as a High Culture local system and cultural districtualization processes: the cluster of art restoration in Florence|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2427.00470/abstract|journal = International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|date = 2003-09-01|issn = 1468-2427|pages = 635–648|volume = 27|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/1468-2427.00470|first = Luciana|last = Lazzeretti}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stern, M.

&lt;/ref&gt; If the conception of a cultual district as a complex adaptive system were accepted, the design process would be conceived as something more flexible, dynamic and in evolution. Complexity theory and complex adaptive systems should move understanding of supra-urban cultural districts towards a more holistic and bottom-up approach&lt;ref name="Lazzeretti 635–648"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cultural Districts, A New Strategy for Regional Development?

This does not suggest inhibiting any attempt at prediction or planning. The use of qualitative analysis and rough estimations or agent-based modelling can represent a fertile ground for both future research, policy-making and managerial implications.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

A '''design director''' is a position usually found within the [[advertising]], [[Mass media|media]], [[automotive]] or [[entertainment industry|entertainment]] industries, but may be useful in other creative organizations such as [[web development]] and [[software development]] firms as well. The position has similarities to that of a [[creative director]]. The design director oversees the design of [[brand]]ing and advertising for a client, ensuring that the new branding and advertising fits in with the client's requirements and the image they wish to promote for their company or product. However, unlike a creative director, the design director is not responsible for the overall quality of the final creative work, but merely for the quality of the project's design elements.

Another distinction between the two positions is that advertising creative directors are usually promoted from copywriting or art directing positions. Design directors, on the other hand, are promoted from [[senior designer]] positions.

'''Dramatic theory''' is a term used for works that attempt to form theories about [[theatre]] and [[drama]]. Examples of ancient dramatic theory include [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' from [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Bharata Muni]]'s ''[[Natyasastra]]'' from ancient [[India]].

[[Image:Panorama Gendarmenmarkt-Berlin-Huntke-2008.jpg|thumb|300px|2008 panorama of the Gendarmenmarkt, showing the Konzerthaus, flanked by the German Church (left) and French Church (right)]]
The '''Gendarmenmarkt''' is a square in [[Berlin]] and the site of an architectural ensemble including the [[Konzerthaus Berlin|''Konzerthaus'']] (concert hall) and the [[French Cathedral|French]] and [[German Cathedral|German Churches]]. In the centre of the square stands a [[Schiller Monument (Berlin)|monumental statue]] of Germany's renowned poet [[Friedrich Schiller]]. The square was created by [[Johann Arnold Nering]] at the end of the seventeenth century as the Linden-Markt and reconstructed by [[Georg Christian Unger]] in 1773. The Gendarmenmarkt is named after the [[cuirassier]] regiment ''Gens d'Arme''s, which had stables at the square until 1773.

During [[World War II]], most of the buildings were badly damaged or destroyed. Today all of them have been restored.

==Origins==
Gendarmenmarkt was first built in 1688. It was a marketplace and part of the city's Western expansion of Friedrichstadt, one of Berlin's emerging quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Architecture |url=http://en.konzerthaus.de/konzerthaus-berlin/architektur |website=www.konzerthaus.de |publisher=Konzerthaus Berlin |accessdate=25 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017214101/http://en.konzerthaus.de/konzerthaus-berlin/architektur |archivedate=17 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Französischer Dom ==
The [[French Cathedral|French Church]] (in German: ''Französischer Dom'', where ''Dom'' refers to the "dome" and not to a cathedral. Neither the French nor the German Church was ever the seat of a bishop. The terminology is a relic of francophone [[Frederick the Great]], who was instrumental in enhancing the Gendarmenmarkt) is the older of the two churches, was built by the [[Huguenot]] community between 1701 and 1705. It was modelled after the destroyed Huguenot church in [[Saint-Maurice, Val-de-Marne|Charenton-Saint-Maurice]], France. The tower and [[portico]]es, designed by [[Carl von Gontard]], were added to the building in 1785. The French Church has a viewing platform, a restaurant and a Huguenot museum.

== Deutscher Dom ==
The [[German Cathedral|German Church]] (in German: ''Deutscher Dom'') is located to the south of the Gendarmenmarkt. It has a [[pentagonal]] structure and was designed by [[Martin Grünberg]] and built in 1708 by [[Giovanni Simonetti]]. This church belonged to the [[Lutheran]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gendarmenmarkt - History of the Square|url=http://gendarmenmarkt.de/history-gendarmenmarkt-berlin-mitte-english.htm|website=www.gendarmenmarkt.de|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It too was modified in 1785 by Carl von Gontard, who built the domed tower. The German Church was completely destroyed by fire in 1945, during [[World War II]]. After [[German reunification]] it was rebuilt, finished in 1993 and re-opened in 1996 as a museum of German history.

== Konzerthaus ==
The [[Konzerthaus Berlin]] is the most recent building on the Gendarmenmarkt. It was built by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] in 1821 as the ''Schauspielhaus''. It was based on the ruins of the National Theatre, which had been destroyed by fire in 1817. Parts of the building contain columns and some outside walls from the destroyed building. Like the other buildings on the square, it was also badly damaged during World War II. The reconstruction, finished in 1984, turned the theatre into a concert hall. Today, it is the home of the [[Konzerthausorchester Berlin]].

The Gendarmenmarkt hosts one of Berlin's most popular [[Christmas market]]s.

The '''genealogical method''' is a well-established procedure in [[ethnography]]. It was initiated by early ethnographers to identify all-important links of [[kinship]] determined by [[marriage]] and [[Cultural heritage|descent]].  [[Genealogy]] or kinship commonly plays a crucial role in the structure of non-industrial societies, determining both social relations and group relationship to the past.  Marriage, for example, is frequently pivotal in determining military alliances between [[village]]s, [[clan]]s or [[ethnic groups]].

In the field of [[epistemology]] the term has come to be used, by extension, to characterize the [[philosophy|philosophical]] method employed by such writers as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Michel Foucault]].

In [[mathematics]], two quantities are in the '''golden ratio''' if their [[ratio]] is the same as the ratio of their [[summation|sum]] to the larger of the two quantities. The figure on the right illustrates the geometric relationship. The golden ratio is also called the '''golden mean''' or '''golden section''' (Latin: ''sectio aurea'').{{sfn|Livio|2003|pp=3, 81}}&lt;ref name="Sadowski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dunlap"&gt;Richard A Dunlap, ''The Golden Ratio and Fibonacci Numbers'', World Scientific Publishing, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Other names include '''extreme and mean ratio''',&lt;ref name="Elements 6.3"&gt;Euclid, ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', [https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVI/defVI3.html Book 6, Definition 3].&lt;/ref&gt; '''medial section''', '''divine proportion''', '''divine section''' (Latin: ''sectio divina''), '''golden proportion''', '''golden cut''',&lt;ref&gt;Summerson John, ''Heavenly Mansions: And Other Essays on Architecture'' (New York: W.W. Norton, 1963) p.&amp;nbsp;37. "And the same applies in architecture, to the [[rectangle]]s representing these and other ratios (e.g. the 'golden cut'). The sole value of these ratios is that they are intellectually fruitful and suggest the rhythms of modular design."&lt;/ref&gt; and '''golden number'''.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Hambidge, ''Dynamic Symmetry: The Greek Vase'', New Haven CT: Yale University Press, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Lidwell, Kritina Holden, Jill Butler, ''Universal Principles of Design: A Cross-Disciplinary Reference'', Gloucester MA: Rockport Publishers, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pacioli"&gt;Pacioli, Luca. ''[[De divina proportione]]'', Luca Paganinem de Paganinus de Brescia (Antonio Capella) 1509, Venice.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathematician]]s since [[Euclid]] have studied the properties of the golden ratio, including its appearance in the dimensions of a [[regular pentagon]] and in a golden rectangle, which may be cut into a square and a smaller rectangle with the same [[aspect ratio]]. The golden ratio has also been used to analyze the proportions of natural objects as well as man-made systems such as [[financial market]]s, in some cases based on dubious fits to data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Steven|last=Strogatz|authorlink=Steven Strogatz|title=Me, Myself, and Math: Proportion Control|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 24, 2012|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/proportion-control/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The golden ratio appears in some [[patterns in nature]], including the [[phyllotaxis|spiral arrangement of leaves]] and other plant parts.

Some twentieth-century [[artist]]s and [[architect]]s, including [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Salvador Dalí]], have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio—especially in the form of the [[golden rectangle]], in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio—believing this proportion to be [[aesthetics|aesthetically]] pleasing.

where the Greek letter [[Phi (letter)|phi]] (&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;) represents the golden ratio.{{efn|If the constraint on a and b each being greater than zero is lifted, then there are actually two solutions, one positive and one negative, to this equation. ϕ is defined as the positive solution. The negative solution can be written as &lt;math&gt;\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. The sum of the two solutions is one, and the product of the two solutions is negative one.}} It is an [[irrational number]] with a value of:

The golden ratio has a wide range of demonstrations throughout history. According to [[Mario Livio]]:
{{quote|Some of the greatest mathematical minds of all ages, from [[Pythagoras]] and [[Euclid]] in [[ancient Greece]], through the medieval Italian mathematician &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Fibonacci]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the Renaissance astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]], to present-day scientific figures such as Oxford physicist [[Roger Penrose]], have spent endless hours over this simple ratio and its properties. ... it is probably fair to say that the Golden Ratio has inspired thinkers of all disciplines like no other number in the history of mathematics.{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=6}}}}

==Applications and observations==

===Aesthetics===
{{See also|History of aesthetics (pre-20th-century)|Mathematics and art}}

''De Divina Proportione'', a three-volume work by [[Luca Pacioli]], was published in 1509. Pacioli, a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]], was known mostly as a mathematician, but he was also trained and keenly interested in art. ''De Divina Proportione'' explored the mathematics of the golden ratio. Though it is often said that Pacioli advocated the golden ratio's application to yield pleasing, harmonious proportions, Livio points out that the interpretation has been traced to an error in 1799, and that Pacioli actually advocated the [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] system of rational proportions.{{sfn|Livio|2003|pp=134-35}} Pacioli also saw Catholic religious significance in the ratio, which led to his work's title. ''De Divina Proportione'' contains illustrations of regular solids by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], Pacioli's longtime friend and collaborator; these are not directly linked to the golden ratio.

[[File:7234014 Parthenonas (cropped).jpg|thumb|x150px|right|Many of the proportions of the [[Parthenon]] are alleged to exhibit the golden ratio.]]

The [[Parthenon]]'s façade as well as elements of its façade are said by some to be circumscribed by golden rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., "Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis with a Philosophical Polemic", ''Communication Quarterly'', Vol. 46 No. 2, 1998, pp 194–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars deny that the Greeks had any aesthetic association with the golden ratio. For example, Midhat J. Gazalé says, "It was not until Euclid, however, that the golden ratio's mathematical properties were studied. In the ''Elements'' (308&amp;nbsp;BC) the Greek mathematician merely regarded that number as an interesting irrational number, in connection with the middle and extreme ratios. Its occurrence in regular pentagons and [[decagon]]s was duly observed, as well as in the [[dodecahedron]]".&lt;ref&gt;Midhat J. Gazalé , ''Gnomon'', Princeton University Press, 1999. {{isbn|0-691-00514-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Keith Devlin]] says, "Certainly, the oft repeated assertion that the Parthenon in Athens is based on the golden ratio is not supported by actual measurements. In fact, the entire story about the Greeks and golden ratio seems to be without foundation. The one thing we know for sure is that Euclid, in his famous textbook ''Elements'', written around 300&amp;nbsp;BC, showed how to calculate its value."&lt;ref&gt;Keith J. Devlin ''The Math Instinct: Why You're A Mathematical Genius (Along With Lobsters, Birds, Cats, And Dogs)'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=eRD9gYk2r6oC&amp;pg=PA108 p.&amp;nbsp;108]. New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 2005, {{isbn|1-56025-672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later sources like [[Vitruvius]] exclusively discuss proportions that can be expressed in whole numbers, i.e. commensurate as opposed to irrational proportions. One researcher concluded that the golden ratio was totally absent from Greek architecture of the classical fifth century&amp;nbsp;BC, and almost absent during the following six centuries, based on measurements of 15 temples, 18 monumental tombs, 8 sarcophagi, and 58 grave stelae.&lt;ref&gt;Patrice Foutakis, "Did the Greeks Build According to the Golden Ratio?", ''Cambridge Archaeological Journal'', vol. 24, n° 1, February 2014, pp.&amp;nbsp;71–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent book, author Jason Elliot speculated that the golden ratio was used by the designers of the [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]] and the adjacent Lotfollah mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Jason Elliot | title = Mirrors of the Unseen: Journeys in Iran | year = 2006 | pages = 277, 284 | publisher = Macmillan | isbn = 978-0-312-30191-0 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Gcs4IjUx3-4C&amp;pg=PA284}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 geometrical analysis of earlier research into the [[Mosque of Oqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] reveals a consistent application of the golden ratio throughout the design, according to Boussora and Mazouz.&lt;ref&gt;Boussora, Kenza and Mazouz, Said, ''The Use of the Golden Section in the Great Mosque of Kairouan'', Nexus Network Journal, vol. 6 no. 1 (Spring 2004), [http://www.emis.de/journals/NNJ/BouMaz.html]&lt;/ref&gt; They found ratios close to the golden ratio in the overall proportion of the plan and in the dimensioning of the prayer space, the court, and the [[minaret]]. The authors note, however, that the areas where ratios close to the golden ratio were found are not part of the original construction, and theorize that these elements were added in a reconstruction.

The Swiss [[architect]] [[Le Corbusier]], famous for his contributions to the [[modernism|modern]] [[International Style (architecture)|international style]], centered his design philosophy on systems of harmony and proportion. Le Corbusier's faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden ratio and the Fibonacci series, which he described as "rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages and the learned."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'' p.&amp;nbsp;25, as cited in Padovan, Richard, ''Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture'' (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;316, Taylor and Francis, {{isbn|0-419-22780-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Frings: The Golden Section in Architectural Theory, Nexus Network Journal vol. 4 no. 1 (Winter 2002), available online [http://belveduto.de/text-nnj.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|Leonardo da Vinci's ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'']]
Le Corbusier explicitly used the golden ratio in his [[Modulor]] system for the [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[Proportion (architecture)|architectural proportion]]. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of Vitruvius, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of [[architecture]]. In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier based the system on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], [[Fibonacci number]]s, and the double unit. He took suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the [[Modulor]] system. Le Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in [[Garches]] exemplified the Modulor system's application. The villa's rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'', p.&amp;nbsp;35, as cited in Padovan, Richard, ''Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture'' (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;320. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{isbn|0-419-22780-6}}: "Both the paintings and the architectural designs make use of the golden section".&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Swiss architect, [[Mario Botta]], bases many of his designs on geometric figures. Several private houses he designed in Switzerland are composed of squares and circles, cubes and cylinders. In a house he designed in [[Origlio]], the golden ratio is the proportion between the central section and the side sections of the house.&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, Simon.

===Music===
[[Ernő Lendvai]] analyzes [[Béla Bartók]]'s works as being based on two opposing systems, that of the golden ratio and the [[acoustic scale]],&lt;ref&gt;Lendvai, Ernő (1971). ''Béla Bartók: An Analysis of His Music''. London: Kahn and Averill.&lt;/ref&gt; though other music scholars reject that analysis.{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=190}} French composer [[Erik Satie]] used the golden ratio in several of his pieces, including ''[[Sonneries de la Rose+Croix]]''. The golden ratio is also apparent in the organization of the sections in the music of [[Debussy]]'s ''[[Reflets dans l'eau]] (Reflections in Water)'', from ''Images'' (1st series, 1905), in which "the sequence of keys is marked out by the intervals 34, 21, 13 and 8, and the main climax sits at the phi position".&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Peter F.

The musicologist [[Roy Howat]] has observed that the formal boundaries of Debussy's ''[[La Mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]'' correspond exactly to the golden section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Debussy in Proportion: A Musical Analysis | author = Roy Howat | url = https://books.google.com/?id=4bwKykNp24wC&amp;pg=PA169 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1983 | isbn = 0-521-31145-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trezise finds the intrinsic evidence "remarkable", but cautions that no written or reported evidence suggests that Debussy consciously sought such proportions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Debussy: La Mer | author = Simon Trezise | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-521-44656-2 | page = 53 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=THD1nge_UzcC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=inauthor:Trezise+golden+evidence }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Zeising]], whose main interests were mathematics and philosophy, found the golden ratio expressed in the [[phyllotaxis|arrangement of parts]] such as leaves and branches along the stems of plants and of [[Leaf#Veins|veins]] in leaves. He extended his research to the [[skeleton]]s of animals and the branchings of their veins and nerves, to the proportions of chemical compounds and the geometry of [[crystal]]s, even to the use of proportion in artistic endeavors. In these [[patterns in nature]] he saw the golden ratio operating as a universal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Proportion

In 2010, the journal ''Science'' reported that the golden ratio is present at the atomic scale in the magnetic resonance of spins in cobalt niobate crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-01/haog-grd010510.php |title=Golden ratio discovered in a quantum world |publisher=Eurekalert.org |date=2010-01-07 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1991, several researchers have proposed connections between the golden ratio and [[human genome]] [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Perez (1991), [http://golden-ratio-in-dna.blogspot.com/2008/01/1991-first-publication-related-to.html "Chaos DNA and Neuro-computers: A Golden Link"], in ''Speculations in Science and Technology'' vol. 14 no. 4, {{ISSN|0155-7785}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yamagishi, Michel E.B., and Shimabukuro, Alex I.

However, some have argued that many apparent manifestations of the golden ratio in nature, especially in regard to animal dimensions, are fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;Pommersheim, James E., Tim K. Marks, and [[Erica Flapan|Erica L. Flapan]], eds. 2010. "Number Theory: A Lively Introduction with Proofs, Applications, and Stories". John Wiley and Sons: 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceptual studies===
Studies by psychologists, starting with [[Gustav Fechner]], have been devised to test the idea that the golden ratio plays a role in human perception of [[beauty]]. While Fechner found a preference for rectangle ratios centered on the golden ratio, later attempts to test such a hypothesis have been inconclusive.{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=7}}&lt;ref name=livio/&gt;

===Disputed observations===
Examples of disputed observations of the golden ratio include the following:
*Historian [[John Man (author)|John Man]] states that the pages of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] were "based on the golden section shape". However, according to Man's own measurements, the ratio of height to width was 1.45.&lt;ref&gt;Man, John, ''Gutenberg: How One Man Remade the World with Word'' (2002) pp. 166–167, Wiley, {{isbn|0-471-21823-5}}. "The half-folio page (30.7 × 44.5 cm) was made up of two rectangles—the whole page and its text area—based on the so called 'golden section', which specifies a crucial relationship between short and long sides, and produces an irrational number, as pi is, but is a ratio of about 5:8."&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some specific proportions in the bodies of many animals (including humans)&lt;ref name=pheasant&gt;{{Cite book |first=Stephen |last=Pheasant |title=Bodyspace |location=London |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1998 |isbn=0-7484-0067-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanLaack&gt;{{Cite book |first=Walter |last=van Laack |title=A Better History Of Our World: Volume 1 The Universe |location=Aachen |publisher=van Laach GmbH |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and parts of the shells of mollusks&lt;ref name="dunlap"/&gt; are often claimed to be in the golden ratio. There is a large variation in the real measures of these elements in specific individuals, however, and the proportion in question is often significantly different from the golden ratio.&lt;ref name=pheasant/&gt; The ratio of successive phalangeal bones of the digits and the metacarpal bone has been said to approximate the golden ratio.&lt;ref name=vanLaack/&gt; The [[nautilus]] shell, the construction of which proceeds in a [[logarithmic spiral]], is often cited, usually with the idea that any logarithmic spiral is related to the golden ratio, but sometimes with the claim that each new chamber is proportioned by the golden ratio relative to the previous one;&lt;ref name=moscovich&gt;[[Ivan Moscovich]], ''Ivan Moscovich Mastermind Collection: The Hinged Square &amp; Other Puzzles,'' New York: Sterling, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; however, measurements of nautilus shells do not support this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Sea shell spirals|last=Peterson|first=Ivars|journal=Science News|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/6030/title/Sea_Shell_Spirals}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In investing, some practitioners of [[technical analysis]] use the golden ratio to indicate support of a price level, or resistance to price increases, of a stock or commodity; after significant price changes up or down, new support and resistance levels are supposedly found at or near prices related to the starting price via the golden ratio.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Osler writes that "38.2 percent and 61.8 percent retracements of recent rises or declines are common," in {{Cite journal|author=Osler, Carol|title=Support for Resistance: Technical Analysis and Intraday Exchange Rates|journal=Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review|year=2000|volume=6|issue=2|pages= 53–68| url=http://ftp.ny.frb.org/research/epr/00v06n2/0007osle.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the golden ratio in investing is also related to more complicated patterns described by [[Fibonacci numbers]] (e.g. [[Elliott wave principle]] and [[Fibonacci retracement]]).  However, other market analysts have published analyses suggesting that these percentages and patterns are not supported by the data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roy Batchelor]] and Richard Ramyar, "[https://www.webcitation.org/5reh6NujR?url=http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/media/stories/resources/Magic_Numbers_in_the_Dow.pdf Magic numbers in the Dow]," 25th International Symposium on Forecasting, 2005, p.  13, 31.

====Pyramids====
[[File:Mathematical Pyramid.svg|right|thumb|250px|A regular square pyramid is determined by its medial right triangle, whose edges are the pyramid's apothem (a), semi-base (b), and height (h); the face inclination angle is also marked. Mathematical proportions b:h:a of &lt;math&gt;1:\sqrt{\varphi}:\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3:4:5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1:4/\pi:1.61899&lt;/math&gt; are of particular interest in relation to Egyptian pyramids.]]
Both Egyptian pyramids and the regular [[square pyramid]]s that resemble them can be analyzed with respect to the golden ratio and other ratios.

=====Mathematical pyramids and triangles=====
A pyramid in which the apothem (slant height along the bisector of a face) is equal to {{φ}} times the semi-base (half the base width) is sometimes called a ''golden pyramid''. The isosceles triangle that is the face of such a pyramid can be constructed from the two halves of a diagonally split golden rectangle (of size semi-base by apothem), joining the medium-length edges to make the apothem. The height of this pyramid is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; times the semi-base (that is, the slope of the face is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;); the square of the height is equal to the area of a face, {{φ}} times the square of the semi-base.

The medial [[right triangle]] of this "golden" pyramid (see diagram), with sides &lt;math&gt;1:\sqrt{\varphi}:\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is interesting in its own right, demonstrating via the [[Pythagorean theorem]] the relationship &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi} = \sqrt{\varphi^2 - 1}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\varphi = \sqrt{1 + \varphi}&lt;/math&gt;. This [[Kepler triangle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Best of Astraea: 17 Articles on Science, History and Philosophy | url = https://books.google.com/?id=LDTPvbXLxgQC&amp;pg=PA93 | publisher = Astrea Web Radio | isbn = 1-4259-7040-0 | year = 2006 | author1 = Radio, Astraea Web }}&lt;/ref&gt;
is the only right triangle proportion with edge lengths in [[geometric progression]],&lt;ref name=herz&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Shape of the Great Pyramid | author = Roger Herz-Fischler | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-88920-324-5 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=066T3YLuhA0C&amp;pg=PA81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; just as the 3–4–5 triangle is the only right triangle proportion with edge lengths in [[arithmetic progression]]. The angle with tangent &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the angle that the side of the pyramid makes with respect to the ground, 51.827... degrees (51° 49' 38").&lt;ref&gt;Midhat Gazale, ''Gnomon: From Pharaohs to Fractals'', Princeton Univ. Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

A nearly similar pyramid shape, but with rational proportions, is described in the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] (the source of a large part of modern knowledge of ancient [[Egyptian mathematics]]), based on the 3:4:5 triangle;&lt;ref name = "maor"/&gt; the face slope corresponding to the angle with tangent 4/3 is 53.13 degrees (53 degrees and 8 minutes).&lt;ref name=Herkommer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petrospec-technologies.com/Herkommer/pyramid/pyramid.htm |title=The Great Pyramid, The Great Discovery, and The Great Coincidence |accessdate=2007-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194148/http://www.petrospec-technologies.com/Herkommer/pyramid/pyramid.htm |archivedate=2014-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The slant height or apothem is 5/3 or 1.666... times the semi-base. The Rhind papyrus has another pyramid problem as well, again with rational slope (expressed as run over rise). Egyptian mathematics did not include the notion of irrational numbers,&lt;ref&gt;Lancelot Hogben, ''Mathematics for the Million'', London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1942, p.&amp;nbsp;63., as cited by Dick Teresi, ''Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science—from the Babylonians to the Maya'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2003, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; and the rational inverse slope (run/rise, multiplied by a factor of 7 to convert to their conventional units of palms per cubit) was used in the building of pyramids.&lt;ref name = "maor"/&gt;

Another mathematical pyramid with proportions almost identical to the "golden" one is the one with perimeter equal to 2{{pi}} times the height, or h:b = 4:{{pi}}. This triangle has a face angle of 51.854° (51°51'), very close to the 51.827° of the Kepler triangle. This pyramid relationship corresponds to the [[mathematical coincidences|coincidental relationship]] &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi} \approx 4/\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

Egyptian pyramids very close in proportion to these mathematical pyramids are known.&lt;ref name=Herkommer/&gt;

=====Egyptian pyramids=====
In the mid-nineteenth century, Röber studied various Egyptian pyramids including Khafre, Menkaure and some of the Giza, Sakkara, and Abusir groups, and was interpreted as saying that half the base of the side of the pyramid is the middle mean of the side, forming what other authors identified as the Kepler triangle; many other mathematical theories of the shape of the pyramids have also been explored.&lt;ref name=herz/&gt;

One Egyptian pyramid is remarkably close to a "golden pyramid"—the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu). Its slope of 51° 52' is extremely close to the "golden" pyramid inclination of 51° 50' and the {{pi}}-based pyramid inclination of 51° 51'; other pyramids at Giza (Chephren, 52° 20', and Mycerinus, 50° 47')&lt;ref name="maor"&gt;[[Eli Maor]], ''Trigonometric Delights'', Princeton Univ. Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; are also quite close. Whether the relationship to the golden ratio in these pyramids is by design or by accident remains open to speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Adding fuel to controversy over the architectural authorship of the Great Pyramid, [[Eric Temple Bell]], mathematician and historian, claimed in 1950 that Egyptian mathematics would not have supported the ability to calculate the slant height of the pyramids, or the ratio to the height, except in the case of the 3:4:5 pyramid, since the 3:4:5 triangle was the only right triangle known to the Egyptians and they did not know the Pythagorean theorem, nor any way to reason about irrationals such as {{pi}} or {{φ}}.{{Disputed inline|Egyptian Pyramids|date=November 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bell |first=Eric Temple |title=The Development of Mathematics |location=New York |publisher=Dover |year=1940 |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_5KAnw3QMC8C&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Rice&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Michael, ''Egypt's Legacy: The Archetypes of Western Civilisation, 3000 to 30 B.C'' pp. 24 Routledge, 2003, {{isbn|0-415-26876-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that principal authorities on the history of [[Egyptian architecture]] have argued that the Egyptians were well acquainted with the golden ratio and that it is part of mathematics of the Pyramids, citing Giedon (1957).&lt;ref&gt;S. Giedon, 1957, The Beginnings of Architecture, The A.W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts, 457, as cited in Rice, Michael, ''Egypt's Legacy: The Archetypes of Western Civilisation, 3000 to 30 B.C'' pp.24 Routledge, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Historians of science have always debated whether the Egyptians had any such knowledge or not, contending rather that its appearance in an Egyptian building is the result of chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Markowsky | first = George | date = January 1992 | title = Misconceptions about the Golden Ratio | journal = College Mathematics Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | doi = 10.2307/2686193 | url = http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = | jstor = 2686193 | publisher = Mathematical Association of America | pages = 2–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, the [[Pyramidology|pyramidologist]] [[John Taylor (1781–1864)|John Taylor]] claimed that, in the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], the golden ratio is represented by the ratio of the length of the face (the slope height), inclined at an angle [[θ]] to the ground, to half the length of the side of the square base, equivalent to the [[Cosecant|secant]] of the angle θ.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''The Great Pyramid: Why Was It Built and Who Built It?'', 1859&lt;/ref&gt; The above two lengths were about 186.4 and 115.2 meters respectively. The ratio of these lengths is the golden ratio, accurate to more digits than either of the original measurements. Similarly, [[Richard William Howard Vyse|Howard Vyse]], according to Matila Ghyka,&lt;ref&gt;Matila Ghyka ''The Geometry of Art and Life'', New York: Dover, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; reported the great pyramid height 148.2 m, and half-base 116.4 m, yielding 1.6189 for the ratio of slant height to half-base, again more accurate than the data variability.

==Mathematics==
Usually, the lowercase form of phi (φ or {{math|''φ''}}) is used to symbolize the golden ratio. Sometimes the uppercase form (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;) is used for the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of the golden ratio, 1/{{math|''φ''}}.&lt;ref name="MathWorld GR Conjugate"/&gt;

Two quantities ''a'' and ''b'' are said to be in the ''golden ratio'' {{math|''φ''}} if

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{a+b}{a} = \frac{a}{b} = \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

One method for finding the value of {{math|''φ''}} is to start with the left fraction. Through simplifying the fraction and substituting in b/a = 1/{{math|''φ''}},

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a+b}{a} = \frac{a}{a}+\frac{b}{a} = 1 + \frac{b}{a} = 1 + \frac{1}{\varphi}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt; 1 + \frac{1}{\varphi} = \varphi. &lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by {{math|''φ''}} gives

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi + 1 = \varphi^2&lt;/math&gt;

which can be rearranged to

:&lt;math&gt;{\varphi}^2 - \varphi - 1 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[quadratic formula]], two solutions are obtained:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1.61803\,39887\dots&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = -0.6180\,339887\dots&lt;/math&gt;

Because {{math|''φ''}} is the ratio between positive quantities {{math|''φ''}} is necessarily positive:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1.61803\,39887\dots&lt;/math&gt; .

===Irrationality ===
The golden ratio is an [[irrational number]]. Below are two short proofs of irrationality:

====Contradiction from an expression in lowest terms====
[[File:Whirling squares.svg|thumb|right|If &amp;phi; were [[Rational number|rational]], then it would be the ratio of sides of a rectangle with integer sides (the rectangle comprising the entire diagram). But it would also be a ratio of integer sides of the smaller rectangle (the rightmost portion of the diagram) obtained by deleting a square. The sequence of decreasing integer side lengths formed by deleting squares cannot be continued indefinitely because the integers have a lower bound, so &amp;phi; cannot be rational.]]

Recall that:

: the whole is the longer part plus the shorter part;
: the whole is to the longer part as the longer part is to the shorter part.

If we call the whole ''n'' and the longer part ''m'', then the second statement above becomes

: ''n'' is to ''m'' as ''m'' is to ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'',

or, algebraically

: &lt;math&gt; \frac nm = \frac{m}{n-m}.\qquad (*) &lt;/math&gt;

To say that the golden ratio {{math|''φ''}} is rational means that {{math|''φ''}} is a fraction ''n''/''m'' where ''n'' and ''m'' are integers.  We may take ''n''/''m'' to be in [[lowest terms]] and ''n'' and ''m'' to be positive. But if ''n''/''m'' is in lowest terms, then the identity labeled (*) above says ''m''/(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'') is in still lower terms. That is a contradiction that follows from the assumption that {{math|''φ''}} is rational.

====By irrationality of {{radic|5}}====
Another short proof—perhaps more commonly known—of the irrationality of the golden ratio makes use of the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of rational numbers under addition and multiplication. If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is rational, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle2\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right) - 1= \sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt; is also rational, which is a contradiction if it is already known that the square root of a non-[[square number|square]] [[natural number]] is irrational.

===Minimal polynomial===
The golden ratio is also an [[algebraic number]] and even an [[algebraic integer]]. It has [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]]

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 - x - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Having degree 2, this polynomial actually has two roots, the other being the golden ratio conjugate.

===Golden ratio conjugate===
The conjugate root to the minimal polynomial x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − x − 1 is

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{\varphi}=1-\varphi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = -0.61803\,39887\dots.&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value of this quantity (≈ 0.618) corresponds to the length ratio taken in reverse order (shorter segment length over longer segment length, ''b/a''), and is sometimes referred to as the ''golden ratio conjugate''.&lt;ref name="MathWorld GR Conjugate"&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Golden Ratio Conjugate|urlname=GoldenRatioConjugate}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is denoted here by the capital Phi ('''&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;'''):

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = {1 \over \varphi} = \varphi^{-1} = 0.61803\,39887\ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, '''&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;''' can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = \varphi -1 = 1.61803\,39887\ldots -1 = 0.61803\,39887\ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

This illustrates the unique property of the golden ratio among positive numbers, that

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over \varphi} = \varphi - 1,&lt;/math&gt;

or its inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over \Phi} = \Phi + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

This means 0.61803...:1 = 1:1.61803....

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = [1; 1, 1, 1, \dots] = 1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \ddots}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Convergent (continued fraction)|convergent]]s of these continued fractions (1/1, 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, 8/5, 13/8, ..., or 1/1, 1/2, 2/3, 3/5, 5/8, 8/13, ...) are ratios of successive [[Fibonacci numbers]].

The equation {{math|''φ''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 + {{math|''φ''}} likewise produces the [[Nested radical|continued square root]], or infinite surd, form:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \cdots}}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

An infinite series can be derived to express phi:&lt;ref&gt;Brian Roselle, [http://sites.google.com/site/goldenmeanseries/ "Golden Mean Series"]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi=\frac{13}{8}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{(n+1)}(2n+1)!}{(n+2)!n!4^{(2n+3)}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = {1 \over 2}\csc(\pi/10) = {1 \over 2}\csc 18^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = 2\cos(\pi/5)=2\cos 36^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \varphi = 2\sin(3\pi/10)=2\sin 54^\circ. &lt;/math&gt;

These correspond to the fact that the length of the diagonal of a regular pentagon is {{math|''φ''}} times the length of its side, and similar relations in a [[pentagram]].

The number {{math|''φ''}} turns up frequently in [[geometry]], particularly in figures with pentagonal [[symmetry]].
The length of a regular [[pentagon]]'s [[diagonal]] is {{math|''φ''}} times its side.
The vertices of a regular [[icosahedron]] are those of [[3|three]] mutually [[orthogonal]] golden rectangles.

There is no known general [[algorithm]] to arrange a given number of nodes evenly on a sphere, for any of several definitions of even distribution (see, for example, ''[[Thomson problem]]''). However, a useful approximation results from dividing the sphere into parallel bands of equal [[surface area]] and placing one node in each band at longitudes spaced by a golden section of the circle, i.e. 360°/{{math|''φ''}} ≅ 222.5°.

====Golden triangle, pentagon and pentagram====
[[File:Golden triangle (math).svg|right|thumb|[[Golden triangle (mathematics)|Golden triangle]]. The double-red-arched angle is 36 degrees, or &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{5}&lt;/math&gt; radians.]]

=====Golden triangle=====
The [[Golden triangle (mathematics)|golden triangle]] can be characterized as an [[isosceles triangle]] ABC with the property that [[bisection|bisecting]] the angle C produces a new [[triangle]] CXB which is a [[similar triangle]] to the original.

If angle BCX = α, then XCA = α because of the bisection, and CAB = α because of the similar triangles; ABC = 2α from the original isosceles symmetry, and BXC = 2α by similarity. The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so 5α = 180, giving α = 36°. So the angles of the golden triangle are thus 36°-72°-72°. The angles of the remaining obtuse isosceles triangle AXC (sometimes called the golden gnomon) are 36°-36°-108°.

Suppose XB has length 1, and we call BC length {{math|''φ''}}. Because of the isosceles triangles XC=XA and BC=XC, so these are also length&amp;nbsp;φ. Length AC&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;AB, therefore equals {{math|''φ''}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. But triangle ABC is similar to triangle CXB, so AC/BC&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;BC/BX, AC/{{math|''φ''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;φ/1, and so AC also equals {{math|''φ''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus {{math|''φ''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, confirming that {{math|''φ''}} is indeed the golden ratio.

Similarly, the ratio of the area of the larger triangle AXC to the smaller CXB is equal to {{math|''φ''}}, while the [[Multiplicative inverse|inverse]] ratio is&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

=====Pentagon=====
In a [[pentagon#Regular pentagons|regular pentagon]] the ratio of a diagonal to a side is the golden ratio, while intersecting diagonals section each other in the golden ratio.&lt;ref name = "Pacioli"/&gt;

=====Odom's construction=====
[[File:Odom.svg|thumb|218 px|Let A and B be midpoints of the sides EF and ED of an equilateral triangle DEF. Extend AB to meet the circumcircle of DEF at C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{|AB|}{|BC|}=\tfrac{|AC|}{|AB|}=\phi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[George Phillips Odom, Jr|George Odom]] has given a remarkably simple construction for {{φ}} involving an equilateral triangle: if an equilateral triangle is inscribed in a circle and the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides is produced to intersect the circle in either of two points, then these three points are in golden proportion. This result is a straightforward consequence of the [[intersecting chords theorem]] and can be used to construct a regular pentagon, a construction that attracted the attention of the noted Canadian geometer [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H. S. M. Coxeter]] who published it in Odom's name as a diagram in the ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' accompanied by the single word "Behold!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quandaries and Queries|url=http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/qq/database/QQ.09.02/mary1.html|publisher=Math Central|accessdate=23 October 2011|author=Chris and Penny}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pentagram=====
The golden ratio plays an important role in the geometry of [[pentagram]]s. Each intersection of edges sections other edges in the golden ratio. Also, the ratio of the length of the shorter segment to the segment bounded by the two intersecting edges (a side of the pentagon in the pentagram's center) is {{φ}}, as the four-color illustration shows.

The pentagram includes ten [[isosceles triangle]]s: five [[acute triangle|acute]] and five [[obtuse triangle|obtuse]] isosceles triangles. In all of them, the ratio of the longer side to the shorter side is {{φ}}. The acute triangles are golden triangles. The obtuse isosceles triangles are golden gnomons.

=====Ptolemy's theorem=====
[[File:Ptolemy Pentagon.svg|thumb|The golden ratio in a regular pentagon can be computed using [[Ptolemy's theorem]].]]

The golden ratio properties of a regular pentagon can be confirmed by applying [[Ptolemy's theorem]] to the quadrilateral formed by removing one of its vertices. If the quadrilateral's long edge and diagonals are ''b'', and short edges are ''a'', then Ptolemy's theorem gives ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ab'' which yields

:&lt;math&gt;{b \over a}={{1+\sqrt{5}}\over 2}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Scalenity of triangles====
Consider a [[triangle]] with sides of lengths ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' in decreasing order. Define the "scalenity" of the triangle to be the smaller of the two ratios ''a''/''b'' and ''b''/''c''. The scalenity is always less than {{φ}} and can be made as close as desired to {{φ}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;49–50, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Triangle whose sides form a geometric progression====
If the side lengths of a triangle form a [[geometric progression]] and are in the ratio 1 : ''r'' : ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''r'' is the common ratio, then ''r'' must lie in the range {{φ}}−1 &lt; ''r'' &lt; {{φ}}, which is a consequence of the [[triangle inequality]] (the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be strictly bigger than the length of the third side). If ''r'' = {{φ}} then the shorter two sides are 1 and {{φ}} but their sum is {{φ}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, thus ''r'' &lt; {{φ}}. A similar calculation shows that ''r'' &gt; {{φ}}−1. A triangle whose sides are in the ratio 1 : {{radic|{{φ}}}} : {{φ}} is a right triangle (because 1 + {{φ}} = {{φ}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) known as a [[Kepler triangle]].&lt;ref name=herz/&gt;

====Golden triangle, rhombus, and rhombic triacontahedron====
[[File:GoldenRhombus.svg|thumb|One of the rhombic triacontahedron's rhombi]]

[[File:Rhombictriacontahedron.svg|thumb|All of the faces of the rhombic triacontahedron are golden rhombi]]

A [[golden rhombus]] is a [[rhombus]] whose diagonals are in the golden ratio. The [[rhombic triacontahedron]] is a [[convex polytope]] that has a very special property: all of its faces are golden rhombi.  In the [[rhombic triacontahedron]] the [[dihedral angle]] between any two adjacent rhombi is 144°, which is twice the isosceles angle of a golden triangle and four times its most acute angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Catalan solids derived from three-dimensional-root systems and quaternions|first1=Mehmet|last1=Koca|first2=Nazife Ozdes|last2=Koca|first3=Ramazan|last3=Koç|journal=	Journal of Mathematical Physics|volume=51|year=2010|page=043501|doi=10.1063/1.3356985|arxiv=0908.3272|bibcode=2010JMP....51d3501K}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to Fibonacci sequence===
The mathematics of the golden ratio and of the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]] are intimately interconnected. The Fibonacci sequence is:

:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, ...

A [[closed-form expression]] for the Fibonacci sequence involves the golden ratio:

:&lt;math&gt;F\left(n\right)
 = {{\varphi^n-(1-\varphi)^n} \over {\sqrt 5}}
 = {{\varphi^n-(-\varphi)^{-n}} \over {\sqrt 5}}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Golden Square fractal with T-branching 8.svg|thumb|Golden squares with [[T-square (fractal)|T-branching]]]]
[[File:Golden Square fractal 6.svg|thumb|Golden square fractal]]

The golden ratio is the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the ratios of successive terms of the Fibonacci sequence (or any Fibonacci-like sequence), as originally shown by [[Kepler]]:&lt;ref name="tatt"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}=\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if a Fibonacci number is divided by its immediate predecessor in the sequence, the quotient approximates {{φ}}; e.g., 987/610&amp;nbsp;{{math|≈}}&amp;nbsp;1.6180327868852. These approximations are alternately lower and higher than {{φ}}, and converge to {{φ}} as the Fibonacci numbers increase, and:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|F_n\varphi-F_{n+1}|

= \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F_{n+a}}{F_n} = \varphi^a,&lt;/math&gt;

where above, the ratios of consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence, is a case when &lt;math&gt;a = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the successive powers of {{φ}} obey the Fibonacci [[recurrence relation|recurrence]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^{n+1} = \varphi^n + \varphi^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This identity allows any polynomial in {{φ}} to be reduced to a linear expression. For example:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
3\varphi^3 - 5\varphi^2 + 4 &amp; = 3(\varphi^2 + \varphi) - 5\varphi^2 + 4 \\
&amp; = 3[(\varphi + 1) + \varphi] - 5(\varphi + 1) + 4 \\
&amp; = \varphi + 2 \approx 3.618.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The reduction to a linear expression can be accomplished in one step by using the relationship
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^k=F_k \varphi +F_{k-1},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F_k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k''th Fibonacci number.

However, this is no special property of {{φ}}, because polynomials in any solution ''x'' to a [[quadratic equation]] can be reduced in an analogous manner, by applying:
:&lt;math&gt;x^2=ax+b&lt;/math&gt;
for given coefficients ''a'', ''b'' such that ''x'' satisfies the equation. Even more generally, any [[rational function]] (with rational coefficients) of the root of an irreducible ''n''th-degree polynomial over the rationals can be reduced to a polynomial of degree {{nowrap|''n'' ‒ 1.}}  Phrased in terms of [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], if α is a root of an irreducible ''n''th-degree polynomial, then &lt;math&gt;\Q(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; has degree ''n'' over &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt;, with basis &lt;math&gt;\{1, \alpha, \dots, \alpha^{n-1}\}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Symmetries===
The golden ratio and inverse golden ratio &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\pm = (1\pm \sqrt{5})/2&lt;/math&gt; have a set of symmetries that preserve and interrelate them. They are both preserved by the [[fractional linear transformation]]s &lt;math&gt;x, 1/(1-x), (x-1)/x,&lt;/math&gt; – this fact corresponds to the identity and the definition quadratic equation.
Further, they are interchanged by the three maps &lt;math&gt;1/x, 1-x, x/(x-1)&lt;/math&gt; – they are reciprocals, symmetric about &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;, and (projectively) symmetric about 2.

More deeply, these maps form a subgroup of the [[modular group]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}(2,\mathbf{Z})&lt;/math&gt; isomorphic to the [[symmetric group]] on 3 letters, &lt;math&gt;S_3,&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the [[stabilizer subgroup|stabilizer]] of the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1,\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; of 3 standard points on the [[projective line]], and the symmetries correspond to the quotient map &lt;math&gt;S_3 \to S_2&lt;/math&gt; – the subgroup &lt;math&gt;C_3 &lt; S_3&lt;/math&gt; consisting of the 3-cycles and the identity &lt;math&gt;() (0 1 \infty) (0 \infty 1)&lt;/math&gt; fixes the two numbers, while the 2-cycles interchange these, thus realizing the map.

===Other properties===
The golden ratio has the simplest expression (and slowest convergence) as a continued fraction expansion of any irrational number (see ''Alternate forms'' above). It is, for that reason, one of the [[continued fraction#A property of the golden ratio φ|worst cases]] of [[Lagrange's approximation theorem]] and it is an extremal case of the [[Hurwitz's theorem (number theory)|Hurwitz inequality]] for [[Diophantine approximation]]s. This may be why angles close to the golden ratio often show up in [[phyllotaxis]] (the growth of plants).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibnat2.html Fibonacci Numbers and Nature – Part 2 : Why is the Golden section the "best" arrangement?], from [http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/ Dr. Ron Knott's] [http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/ Fibonacci Numbers and the Golden Section], retrieved 2012-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining quadratic polynomial and the conjugate relationship lead to decimal values that have their fractional part in common with {{φ}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^2 = \varphi + 1 = 2.618\dots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over \varphi} = \varphi - 1 = 0.618\dots.&lt;/math&gt;

The sequence of powers of {{φ}} contains these values 0.618..., 1.0, 1.618..., 2.618...; more generally,
any power of {{φ}} is equal to the sum of the two immediately preceding powers:

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi^n = \varphi^{n-1} + \varphi^{n-2} = \varphi \cdot \operatorname{F}_n + \operatorname{F}_{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

As a result, one can easily decompose any power of {{φ}} into a multiple of {{φ}} and a constant. The multiple and the constant are always adjacent Fibonacci numbers. This leads to another property of the positive powers of {{φ}}:

If &lt;math&gt; \lfloor n/2 - 1 \rfloor = m &lt;/math&gt;, then:

:&lt;math&gt; \!\ \varphi^n = \varphi^{n-1} + \varphi^{n-3} + \cdots + \varphi^{n-1-2m} + \varphi^{n-2-2m} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \!\ \varphi^n - \varphi^{n-1} = \varphi^{n-2} . &lt;/math&gt;

When the golden ratio is used as the base of a [[numeral system]] (see [[Golden ratio base]], sometimes dubbed ''phinary'' or {{φ}}''-nary''), every integer has a terminating representation, despite {{φ}} being irrational, but every fraction has a non-terminating representation.

The golden ratio is a [[Fundamental unit (number theory)|fundamental unit]] of the [[algebraic number field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})&lt;/math&gt; and is a [[Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=PisotNumber |title=Pisot Number}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\varphi^n = {{L_n + F_n \sqrt{5}} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L_n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th [[Lucas number]].

The golden ratio also appears in [[hyperbolic geometry]], as the maximum distance from a point on one side of an [[ideal triangle]] to the closer of the other two sides: this distance, the side length of the [[equilateral triangle]] formed by the points of tangency of a circle inscribed within the ideal triangle, is &lt;math&gt;4\log(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabri.net/abracadabri/GeoNonE/GeoHyper/KBModele/Biss3KB.html Horocycles exinscrits : une propriété hyperbolique remarquable], cabri.net, retrieved 2009-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decimal expansion===
The golden ratio's decimal expansion can be calculated directly from the expression
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = {1+\sqrt{5} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;

with {{radic|5}} ≈ 2.2360679774997896964 {{OEIS2C|id=A002163}}. The [[square root of 5]] can be calculated with the [[Babylonian method]], starting with an initial estimate such as ''x''{{φ}} = 2 and [[iterative method|iterating]]

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{(x_n + 5/x_n)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ..., until the difference between ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; becomes zero, to the desired number of digits.

The Babylonian algorithm for {{radic|5}} is equivalent to [[Newton's method]] for solving the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;5 = 0. In its more general form, Newton's method can be applied directly to any [[algebraic equation]], including the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 = 0 that defines the golden ratio. This gives an iteration that converges to the golden ratio itself,

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n^2 + 1}{2x_n - 1},&lt;/math&gt;

for an appropriate initial estimate ''x''{{φ}} such as ''x''{{φ}} = 1. A slightly faster method is to rewrite the equation as ''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1/''x'' = 0, in which case the Newton iteration becomes

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n^2 + 2x_n}{x_n^2 + 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

These iterations all [[quadratic convergence|converge quadratically]]; that is, each step roughly doubles the number of correct digits. The golden ratio is therefore relatively easy to compute with [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic|arbitrary precision]]. The time needed to compute ''n'' digits of the golden ratio is proportional to the time needed to divide two ''n''-digit numbers. This is considerably faster than known algorithms for the [[transcendental number]]s '''[[pi|{{pi}}]]''' and [[e (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|'''e'''}}]].

An easily programmed alternative using only integer arithmetic is to calculate two large consecutive Fibonacci numbers and divide them. The ratio of Fibonacci numbers ''F'' &lt;sub&gt;25001&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F'' &lt;sub&gt;25000&lt;/sub&gt;, each over 5000 digits, yields over 10,000 significant digits of the golden ratio.

The decimal expansion of the golden ratio {{φ}}&lt;ref name="a001622"/&gt; has been calculated to an accuracy of two trillion ({{val|2|e=12}} = 2,000,000,000,000) digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.numberworld.org/digits/GoldenRatio/ |title=Golden Ratio |first= Alexander J. |last=Yee |date=17 August 2015 |website=numberword.org}}  Independent computations done by Ron Watkins and Dustin Kirkland.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Smile have a nice day sign.jpg|thumb|"Smile have a nice day" sign in [[Millburn, New Jersey]]|alt=photograph]]
'''Have a nice day''' is a commonly spoken expression used to conclude a conversation (whether brief or extensive), or end a message by hoping the person to whom it is addressed experiences a pleasant day. Since it is often uttered by service employees to customers at the end of a transaction, particularly in [[Israel]] and the [[United States]], its repetitious and dutiful usage has resulted in the phrase developing, according to some journalists and scholars, especially outside of these two countries, a cultural connotation of impersonality, lack of interest, [[passive–aggressive behavior]], or [[sarcasm]]. The phrase is generally not used in Europe, as some find it artificial or even offensive. Critics of the phrase characterize it as an imperative, obliging the person to have a nice day. Other critics argue that it is a parting platitude that comes across as pretended. While defenders of the phrase agree that "Have a nice day" can be used insincerely, they consider the phrase to be comforting, in that it improves interactions among people. Others favor the phrase because it does not require a response.

A variant of the phrase—"have a good day"—is first recorded in ''[[Layamon's Brut]]'' (c. 1205) and ''[[King Horn]]''. "Have a nice day" itself first appeared in the 1948&amp;nbsp;film ''[[A Letter to Three Wives]]''.  In the United States, the phrase was first used on a regular basis in the early to mid 1960s by FAA air traffic controllers and pilots.  It was subsequently popularized by truck drivers talking on [[citizens' band radio|CB radios]]. Variations on the phrase include "have a good one" and "have a nice one". In conjunction with the [[smiley|smiley face]], the phrase became a defining cultural emblem of the 1970s and was a key theme in the 1991&amp;nbsp;film ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]''. By 2000, "have a nice day" and "have a good day" were taken metaphorically, synonymous with the parting phrase "goodbye".

==History==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' recorded the earliest uses of one the phrase's variants—"have a good day"—as being "Habbeð alle godne dæie" in ''[[Layamon's Brut]]'' (c. 1205) and "Rymenhild, have wel godne day" in ''[[King Horn]]'' (1225).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50096765 |title=Good day |year=1989 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford }} ''(subscription required)''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roland Dickison of [[California State University]], "have a good day" first appeared in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s 1387&amp;nbsp;''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'': "And hoom wente every man the righte way, there was namoore but 'Fare wel, have a good day{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="Safire"&gt;{{cite news |title=Have A Nice Day' America's Favorite Farewell Is Driving Folks Crazy |author=Safire, William |authorlink=William Safire |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1979-07-08 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19790708&amp;id=RIkwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1_oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6712,2496372 |accessdate=2010-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Routinely employed by Chaucer in his literary works, "have a good day" disappeared for several centuries before its revival.&lt;ref name="Ammer177–178"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ammer|2001|pp=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Safire]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that "have a nice day" first appeared in the 1948&amp;nbsp;film ''[[A Letter to Three Wives]]''.&lt;ref name="Safire"/&gt; ''The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms'' stated that "have a nice day" first came into being in 1920, and the phrase and its variants became widely used after the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Ammer288"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ammer|1997|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Prior to "have a nice day", the most popular valediction was "so long". Other farewell phrases were "see you later" and "see ya later", which evolved into "see ya later, alligator". In the 1960s, during growing abhorrence of the [[Vietnam War]], people parted with the word "peace". Jack Smith of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' lamented that there were no English counterparts to the graceful farewell phrases of other languages; Spanish had "hasta la vista", French had "au revoir", and German had "auf Wiedersehen".&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Inescapable "Nice Day" |author=Smith, Jack |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1973-03-30 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cRIdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MpwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1977,5588934 |accessdate=2010-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} In 1964, [[Carol Reed (weather broadcaster)|Carol Reed]] of [[WCBS-TV]] spread the phrase in the New York metropolitan area by closing her weather reports with "have a happy day", which, according to Safire, is a variant of "have a nice day".&lt;ref name="Safire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shepard"&gt;{{cite news |title=TV Notes: Role of Weathercasters |author=Shepard, Richard F. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1984-03-01 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/01/arts/tv-notes-role-of-weathercasters.html?&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=2010-06-11 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qPuDeGML |archivedate=2010-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s saw the phrase "have a good day" become prevalent and supersede "happy day".&lt;ref name="Safire"/&gt; Numerous hippies, when parting, told each other to "have a nice day" or "have a beautiful day".&lt;ref name="McCleary234"&gt;{{Harvnb|McCleary|2004|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, "have a nice city" was a mayoralty slogan in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Safire"/&gt; In 1972, during the [[Vietnam War]], family members of POW/MIA members of the American armed forces participated in South Boston's [[Saint Patrick's Day]] march.&lt;ref name="Robinson102"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|Dunn|2006|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; They carried a black banner that read "POW/MIA Families Never Have a Nice Day". They received scowls and jeers from a hostile crowd. One woman said, "They should be shot for bringing this here."&lt;ref name="Robinson102"/&gt;

By around 2000, "have a nice day" and "have a good day" were taken metaphorically, morphing into synonyms of the parting phrase "goodbye".&lt;ref name="Ammer177–178"/&gt;

===Smiley face and "have a nice day"===
[[File:Have a Nice Day! styrofoam food container.JPG|thumb|A [[polystyrene]] food container displaying a [[smiley|smiley face]] and the phrase "have a nice day"|alt=photograph]]
Abigail Goldman of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', wrote that the [[smiley|smiley face]] and the expression "have a nice day" "helped to define the '70s".&lt;ref name="Goldman"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wal-Mart Vies for Right to Put On a Happy Face |author=Goldman, Abigail |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2006-03-07 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/07/business/fi-smiley7 |accessdate=2010-07-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rHX4sk9c |archivedate=2010-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, [[Philadelphia]]n brothers Murray and Bernard Spain designed and sold products including [[bumper sticker]]s and [[coffee mug]]s that each contained the yellow [[Smiley|smiley face]], usually attributed to [[Harvey Ball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Who invented the smiley face? |author=Adams, Cecil |authorlink=Cecil Adams |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/961/who-invented-the-smiley-face |newspaper=[[Chicago Reader]] |publisher=[[The Straight Dope]] |date=1993-04-23 |accessdate=2013-05-18 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Gi0oGgjs |archivedate=2013-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They later changed the phrase to "Have a nice day".&lt;ref name="Vincent114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vincent|Fortunati|2009|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Savage"&gt;{{cite news |title=The History of the Smiley Face Symbol |author=Savage, Jon |authorlink=Jon Savage |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2009-02-21 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/21/smiley-face-design-history |accessdate=2010-09-26 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5t1UKcekR |archivedate=2010-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1991&amp;nbsp;film ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' ironically ends with the parting phrase "have a nice day", which for the fourth time invokes the smiley face.&lt;ref name="Hedrick221"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hedrick|Reynolds|2000|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smiley faces represent optimism and appear to ask the characters, who are characterized as "marginal figures", how nice their days are.&lt;ref name="Hedrick222"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hedrick|Reynolds|2000|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; While traveling to Idaho, the protagonists' motorcycle breaks down, and one of the characters, Mike, gazes at the sun on the horizon and links it with the motto "have a nice day". He says, "I've been on this road before. Looks like a fucked-up face. Like it's saying 'have a nice day' or something."&lt;ref name="Hedrick222"/&gt;

In the 1994 film ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', [[title character]] [[Forrest Gump (character)|Forrest]] is jogging down the street when a T-shirt salesman approaches him, asking him to put his face on T-shirts as inspiration to people.&lt;ref name="Kime59"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kime|2003|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the men are jogging, a truck splashes mud into Forrest's face, and the salesman gives him a yellow shirt to wipe the mud off. Forrest rolls up the shirt and hands it back, saying "have a nice day". Unrolling the shirt, the man finds a smiley face outlined on it.&lt;ref name="Kime59"/&gt; Thus the film credits Forrest Gump with inventing the ''Smiley'' logo and the ''have a nice day'' slogan.&lt;ref name="Kime59"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maslin"&gt;{{cite news |title=Forrest Gump (1994) |author=Maslin, Janet |authorlink=Janet Maslin |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1994-07-06 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/gump-re.html |accessdate=2010-09-26 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5t1Wxmlwm |archivedate=2010-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, [[Bon Jovi]] released the album ''[[Have a Nice Day (Bon Jovi album)|Have a Nice Day]]''. The album cover contains a red smiley face which guitarist [[Richie Sambora]] stated echoes [[Have a Nice Day (Bon Jovi song)|its title song]]. Sambora explained that "It's [like] 'Have a nice day; get out of my face'—therefore the smirk. To me, it's much more of a Clint Eastwood 'Have a nice day' than a smiley face 'Have a nice day.'"&lt;ref name="Bream"&gt;{{cite news |title=Have a Bon Jovi day - A smiley face with an edge sets the tone for the New Jersey rockers' new ventures into social commentary and country music |author=Bream, Jon |url=http://samborangel.m78.com/samborablog/archives/2005/11/05-1205press.php |newspaper=[[Star Tribune]] |date=2005-11-05 |accessdate=2011-07-19 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60IdlBYoV |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[File:Have a nice day Friday Arabic.jpg|thumb|"Have a nice day Friday" on a carpet or floormat in English and Arabic|alt=photograph]]
The phrase "have a nice day" is typically spoken by service employees or clerks to customers at the end of a transaction.

Other versions of "have a nice day" are "have a good one"&lt;ref name="Snow32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Snow|1992|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "have a nice one."&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick85"/&gt; The phrase was universalized after 1950 by truck drivers conversing on their [[citizens' band radio|CB radios]].&lt;ref name="Ammer177–178"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick85"/&gt; Scientific studies indicate that people who regularly smile are more likely to say "have a nice day".&lt;ref name="Royko22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Royko|2002|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase can have [[passive–aggressive behavior|passive–aggressive]] connotations,&lt;ref name="Welt167"&gt;{{Harvnb|Welt|Herron|1990|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be caustically used to end transactions with abusive customers.&lt;ref name="McPherson"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sadly, the effort to ban 'Have a nice day' fails |author=McPherson, Les |newspaper=[[The StarPhoenix]] |date=2008-09-25 |url=http://www2.canada.com/components/print.aspx?id=1d087c6b-aa6a-469d-8beb-3511ebd0b305&amp;sponsor= |accessdate=2010-06-11 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qQ0duaN5 |archivedate=2010-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The speaker may also use the phrase [[irony|ironically]], in either a purposeful or unintentional manner.&lt;ref name="Ammer177–178"/&gt;

He wrote that using "you" in imperatives is more common with people under 25.&lt;ref name="Sussex"/&gt; In her 2001 book ''The Facts on File Dictionary of Clichés'', Christina Ammer wrote about the growing usage of "have a good meal" in restaurants. Ammer opined that the phrase "induces teeth-gnashing irritation when voiced by a particularly incompetent waiter".&lt;ref name="Ammer177–178"/&gt;

Academic Sandi Mann's interviews found that the British wished and demanded cordiality from service personnel, more than from their coworkers. Israelis, Americans, and Australians, on the other hand, wanted friendliness from both their coworkers and service personnel. Mann explains that the British do not expect a "smiley" display from colleagues because they have more time to build longer-term relationships. Those in the service industry, though, have to become "one-minute friends" each time they interact with customers.&lt;ref name="Mann34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|1999|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In crime===
On July 14, 1979, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' published an article titled "This is a holdup; have a nice day" about a Minneapolis robber; while robbing the First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Chicago, the man gave a note to the bank teller that said "Thank you, and have a nice day".&lt;ref name="Holdup"&gt;{{cite news |title=This is a holdup; have a nice day  |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1979-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 3, 2007, two robbers equipped with handguns stole money from a [[self-service kiosk|kiosk]] at a Vale, North Carolina store; the ''[[Hickory Daily Record]]'' called them "courteous crooks" because after the theft, they told people to "have a nice day".&lt;ref name="Menster"&gt;{{cite news |title=Courteous crooks tell clerk and customers: 'Have a nice day' |author=Menster, Jennifer |newspaper=[[Hickory Daily Record]] |date=2007-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Israel===
"Have a nice day" is frequently used in the Israeli retail and service industries.&lt;ref name="Levin21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Levin|2005|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Levin (journalist)|Jerry Levin]] wrote in his 2005&amp;nbsp;book ''West Bank Diary: Middle East Violence as Reported by a Former American Hostage'' about a woman in a coffee shop telling him to "have a nice day" after he purchased a sweet roll and coffee.&lt;ref name="Levin21–22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Levin|2005|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levin stated that there is also a "grimmer version of the pervasive pleasantry". After an Israeli soldier destroyed the [[memory card]] of Levin's camera, the soldier told him with a jocular smirk, "have a nice day".&lt;ref name="Levin22–24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Levin|2005|pp=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Mosawa Center for Arab Rights in Israel paid for ads on television and radio stations in Israel. In the television ads, the Arabic phrase for "have a nice day" would flash onto the screen in black letters and on a red background.&lt;ref name="Halkin"&gt;{{cite news |title='Have a nice day' TV campaign aims to stop anti-Arab prejudice |author=Halkin, Talya |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=2005-10-08 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=1440 |accessdate=2010-09-01 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sPcNmtQT |archivedate=2010-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following the Arabic phrase would be a Hebrew phrase that said, "Are you already against it without even knowing what it says? All we wanted to say is have a nice day."&lt;ref name="Halkin"/&gt; Spokeswoman Abir Kopty stated that "[t]he purpose of this campaign was mainly to cause the Israeli public sitting at home, or walking down the street, to ask itself why it had a negative reaction to everything Arab, even if it is the simplest phrase."&lt;ref name="Halkin"/&gt; Kopty further said that the Mosawa Center wanted to encourage Arabs to be more active and more visible in the community.&lt;ref name="Halkin"/&gt;

===In Korea===
According to ''Korean Studies'' published by the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]], "have a nice day" is sometimes used in Korea. ''Korean Studies'' wrote that it "seemed somehow to fit nicely" with the phrase "Caymi posey yo", which is frequently used in Korean shops to say goodbye.&lt;ref name="Korean Studies4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Korean Studies|1983|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Europe===
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center | align = right| width = 33% | quote = Beyond smiling, most Germans consider the phrase "have a nice day" an insincere and superficial bit of nonsense. To an American it's something normal and expected, but the more I hear this, the less I appreciate it. After all, if I'm at the supermarket to buy anti-nausea medicine for a sick child, I may have a nice day after all, but at that point the checker's "polite" have-a-nice-day comment seems even more inappropriate than usual. (Did she not notice I was buying nausea medicine, rather than, say, a six-pack of beer?) This is a true story, and a German friend who was with me that day happens to have a good sense of humor and was mildly amused by this strange American custom.

Europeans generally feel the phrase "have a nice day" is fake and that the speaker is solely interacting with the listener for business purposes.&lt;ref name="Olofsson279"/&gt; It is generally not used in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Olofsson279"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harling|Jenkins|2008|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "have a nice day" spread to Britain from the United States.&lt;ref name="Brewer's"&gt;{{cite book |title=Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable |year=2009 |publisher=[[Chambers Harrap Publishers]] |isbn=0-550-10411-9 |edition=18 |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/brewerphrase/nice |accessdate=2010-09-17 }} ''(subscription required)''&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, the variants "have a fine day" and "have a good day" are frequently used in place of "have a nice day".&lt;ref name="Ammer177–178"/&gt; British customers generally consider it to be obnoxious and overbearing,&lt;ref name="Olofsson279"/&gt; instead usually preferring the gentler expression "enjoy the rest of your afternoon".&lt;ref name="Harling116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harling|Jenkins|2008|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2002 book ''Different Games, Different Rules'', Haru Yamada and [[Deborah Tannen]] recalled teaching a class in London, where a student construed "have a nice day" to be insincere. The student said that Americans "say things like that with this big fake smile on their face, and they don't really mean it".&lt;ref name="YamadaTannen48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yamada|Tannen|2002|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not having the context of the metaphor, the student took the phrase literally and was unable to discern the intended cordiality. Conversely, when Americans visit stores in Britain where the salespeople engage not in "have a nice day" salesmanship, Americans regard British as lacking [[customer service]].&lt;ref name="YamadaTannen48"/&gt;

[[Guy Browning]] penned an article in 2007 titled "How to... have a nice day" for ''[[The Guardian]]'', writing that sarcasm will creep into the discussion if the British say "have a nice day".&lt;ref name="Browning"&gt;{{cite news |title=How to... have a nice day |author=Browning, Guy |authorlink=Guy Browning |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2007-09-08 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/sep/08/weekend.guybrowning |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ssdOJtjY |archivedate=2010-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Browning explained that in Britain, people assume that the day will be horrible—even catastrophic. He wrote that for the United States though, "nice days and the having thereof are written into the constitution".&lt;ref name="Browning"/&gt;

In Germany, "Schönen Tag noch!", the German phrase for "have a nice day", is being used more frequently by its vendors and waiters. German author Hyde Flippo wrote that many Germans deem "have a nice day" to be affected and shallow. Flippo further opined that the phrase is an appropriate example of culturally improper language. He compared it to smiling arbitrarily at a German person which would give the impression that the smiler is a "little simple-minded or not quite 'all there'". Writing that Germans prefer "Auf Wiedersehen!" or "Tschüss!" (both meaning "goodbye")—which German shopkeepers frequently use—to "dubious wishes for a nice day" he opined that that is why Germans generally favor visiting a small shop instead of a large department store.&lt;ref name="Flippo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://german.about.com/library/weekly/aa080299.htm?p=1 |title=Have a Nice Day! |author=Flippo, Hyde |publisher=[[About.com]] |accessdate=2010-10-13 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tSMRSgAC |archivedate=2010-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French also concur that the phrase is insincere. Author Natalie Schorr wrote that the French frequently say "''[[wikt:bonne journée|bonne journée]]''"—"good day" in French—and do not consider it to be insincere. Schorr explains that "''bonne journée''" is a "gracious ''formule de politesse''", similar to ''[[wikt:merci|merci]]'' and ''[[wikt:s'il vous plaît|s'il vous plaît]]''. However, "have a nice day" sounds like a trite phrase spoken by a telemarketer.&lt;ref name="Schorr41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schorr|2009|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden, [[Lennart Fridén]], a [[List of members of the parliament of Sweden, 1994–1998|member]] of the [[Parliament of Sweden]], lamented in a January 1995 speech to Parliament the usage of "ha en bra dag"—"have a nice day" in Swedish. Fridén stated that the increased usage of English [[loanword|loan expressions]] like "ha en bra dag" "impairs our sense of language and style". He proposed a motion that an authoritative body, working in conjunction with linguistic institutions, be delegated the job of "caring for the Swedish language"; the motion did not pass.&lt;ref name="Fridén"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riksdagen.se/Webbnav/?nid=410&amp;dok_id=GI02Kr260 |title=Motion 1994/95:Kr260 Det svenska språket |author=Fridén, Lennart |date=1995-01-25 |publisher=[[Parliament of Sweden]] |accessdate=2011-02-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wdHWmDr3 |archivedate=2011-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boston-born American author Edith Shillue wrote in her 2003&amp;nbsp;book ''Peace Comes Dropping Slow'' that when the Irish stereotyped Americans, they tended to use the phrase "have a nice day".&lt;ref name="Shillue24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shillue|2003|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; While lodging at a house in Ireland, Shillue found a drawing on the wall for American visitors like her. Drawn by her host's daughters, the picture had the phrase "Have&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;______&amp;nbsp;Day", with a smiley faced affixed instead of the word "nice".&lt;ref name="Shillue24"/&gt; Irish author [[Aidan Higgins]] wrote in his 2004 book ''A Bestiary'' that the Americanization of Ireland led the Irish to say phrases like "No problem!" or "Have a nice day!" even when there is drenching rain.&lt;ref name="Higgins734"&gt;{{Harvnb|Higgins|2004|p=734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United States===
In the United States, "good morning", "good afternoon", "good evening", and "good night" were previously the normal farewell addresses for a lengthy period of time. The common valediction has become "have a nice day".&lt;ref name="Ladd17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ladd|1996|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to the ''Handbook of Hispanic Cultures in the United States'', "[t]enga un nice day" is an example of Cuban [[Spanglish]]. This is distinguished from Chicano Spanish, in that the Chicano second-generation and beyond, who are inclined to [[code-switching|code-switch]], generally do not speak in the formal address form of "tenga".&lt;ref name="Kanellos173"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kanellos|Esteva-Fabregat|1994|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a New York courtroom, a judge sentenced a man to a seven- to ten-year jail term at the [[Auburn State Prison]] for committing a robbery. The judge's final words were "You are hereby remanded to the custody of the sheriff's department for delivery to the custody of state officials. Have a nice day."&lt;ref name="Safire"/&gt; Jack Sheehan of [[WKRT]] stated that the convict "almost sank to his knees. The phrase had worked its magic."&lt;ref name="Safire"/&gt;

Jewish-American comedian [[Alan King (comedian)|Alan King]] joked in his book ''Matzo Balls for Breakfast'' that Jews rarely say "'have a nice day', or even have one".&lt;ref name="King77"&gt;{{Harvnb|King|2005|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that "[t]o be honest, I've never heard a Jew say that."&lt;ref name="King77"/&gt;

=="Have a Nice Day" culture==
Sandi Mann, a [[industrial and organizational psychology|business psychologist]] at the [[University of Central Lancashire]], defines the "Have a Nice Day" culture as filled with "fake smiles, forced ''bonhomie'', and meaningless demands by workers to 'have a nice day'".&lt;ref name="Mann21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|1999|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managers compel their employees to be attentive and affable with customers despite the fact that some employees do not feel these emotions.&lt;ref name="Mann22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|1999|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandi Mann concludes from her research that the "Have a Nice Day" culture will prevail, becoming used by more companies and countries.&lt;ref name="Mann36"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|1999|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the service industry, for example, she explains that products have become more uniform over the past few decades. Thus, the sole way for companies to distinguish themselves is to have better customer service.&lt;ref name="Mann31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|1999|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that there are positive and negative effects. A positive effect is that it is beneficial for business and for people who enjoy fake displays.&lt;ref name="Mann36"/&gt; A negative effect is that emotions incompatible with the "Have a Nice Day" culture are repressed, leading to what Mann terms the "Have a Nice Day" syndrome.&lt;ref name="Mann32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|1999|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', an employee of a telemarketing company, was called a [[bitch (insult)#Son of a bitch|son of a bitch]]. Clenching his teeth, he responded "Thank you very much, you have a nice day."&lt;ref name="Milbank"&gt;{{cite news |title='New-Collar' Work: Telephone Sales Reps Do Unrewarding Jobs That Few Can Abide |author=Milbank, Dana |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=1993-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stress of suppressing their feelings and faking cheerfulness caused people like the telemarketer to feel insincere and phony.&lt;ref name="Mann88"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|1999|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals affected by the "Have a Nice Day" syndrome must carry out [[emotional labor]],&lt;ref name="Mann84"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|1999|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could lead to diminished [[self-esteem]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]].&lt;ref name="Mann89"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|1999|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center | align = right| width = 33% | quote = Have a nice day! Sunnybank housewives, and indeed, people from other areas of Brisbane, collectively reeled from the blatant American cliche that had infiltrated our suburbs. Have a nice day! We only heard that on Hollywood movies and American soap operas! Now, poor innocent Aussie teenagers were being forced to say it as if they meant it!

There is no sincere way to say "have a nice day". It's an idiom that's been mashed and mangled over the decades until any semblance of meaning has been wrung out of it. It's as sincere as a game show host, but tragically has a much longer shelf life.| source = [[Andrew Biggs]] of the ''[[Bangkok Post]]''&lt;ref name="Turner"/&gt;}}

Linguistically, "have a nice day" is a command in that the subject, the pronoun you, is intimated.&lt;ref name="Snow33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Snow|1992|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could be regarded as an exhortation to achieve an outcome that the recipient has no power to influence. However, it is also possible to interpret the phrase as a contraction of "''I hope that you'' have a nice day".

Kerry LePage wrote in his 2004&amp;nbsp;book ''Some Day Never Comes'' that he chooses to have a nice day based on his own choice, not that of another person.&lt;ref name="LePage34"&gt;{{Harvnb|LePage|2007|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; J. Broad wrote in his 2007&amp;nbsp;book ''Some Day Never Comes'' that the phrase causes people to feel they have an obligation to have a nice day.&lt;ref name="Broad27"/&gt; [[Mike Royko]] wrote in his 2002 book ''For the Love of Mike'' that people may have a bad day, not a nice one, because they "confront a demanding boss, a nasty customer, a crabby teacher".&lt;ref name="Royko23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Royko|2002|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to author [[John Tschohl]], the tediousness of the phrase is exemplified by employees uttering the words so faintly as to be barely audible.&lt;ref name="Tschohl164"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tschohl|1996|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is occasionally used in an ironic manner when others have been disrespectful or have negatively impacted the speaker.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick85"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kirkpatrick|Kirkpatrick|1999|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Detroit, a supermarket started a program to have its cashiers tell every customer to "have a nice day" after completing their transactions. After conducting surveys, they realized that more than half of the customers were unaware of whether the clerk had said the phrase. In addition, a number of customers commented that they despised being told to "have a nice day".&lt;ref name="Brown22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|1996|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 study, researchers at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]] discovered that people who must smile and say "have a nice day" in their jobs are more prone to illness. [[Flight attendant]]s, [[waiting staff|waiters]], and [[call centre|call center]] operators, as well as others who are forced to act cheerfully, are more likely to become depressed. This can lead to decreased immune system function.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite news |title=Have a nice day — and a short life |author=Hall, Alan |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=2006-03-21 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/dont-worry-be-grumpy/2006/03/20/1142703283846.html |accessdate=2010-08-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s875SRKc |archivedate=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian ''[[Andrew Biggs]]'' of the ''[[Bangkok Post]]'' wrote that in the past, the phrase was heard exclusively in Hollywood movies and American soap operas. He lamented that by the 1970s, Aussie teenagers were compelled to tell customers to "have a nice day", a "blatant American cliche". Biggs stated that "have a nice day" is "an idiom that's been mashed and mangled over the decades".&lt;ref name="Biggs"/&gt;

Jan C. Snow laments that the phrase was trite and indicative of the speaker's lack of vocabulary. She wrote that on Saturdays, people could be asked to "have a relaxing day". People with highly variable jobs such as emergency room nurses may appreciate "have a routine day", while mothers of young children may wish to "have a quiet day".&lt;ref name="Snow33"/&gt; Debbie Lundberg wrote in her 2008&amp;nbsp;book ''Have a Nice Day Is Not Thank You, and No Problem Is Not You're Welcome'' that service people should say "thank you" instead of "have a nice day". She argued that "thank you" is shorter and is a "recognition of the ability you have to thank someone", which adds more worth to the purchase than something that will occur in the future.&lt;ref name="Lundberg12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lundberg|2008|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul V. Marshall, the bishop of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Bethlehem]], concurred, writing in the ''[[Reading Eagle]]'' that he prefers "thank you" to "have a nice day" or "have a great day" even though "thank you" has a "host of socially acceptable responses".&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;{{cite news |title=Let us give thanks |author=Marshall, Paul V. |authorlink=Paul V.

J. Broad wrote that the phrase "have a nice day" is an apt middle ground for the "drop dead" the cashier is thinking and the "come back soon" the owner wants. Broad stated that the phrase is meaningless because it has been castrated by excessive usage and pretense. He compared the phrase to the salutation "How are you?" and the phrase "had a lovely time", which are "conversational space-fillers" that help prevent embarrassing silences.&lt;ref name="Broad28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Broad|2004|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the term has been compared to inserting the phrase "you know" or the word "like" in sentences.&lt;ref name="Snow32"/&gt; In 1982, comedian [[George Carlin]] joked at [[Carnegie Hall]], "That's the trouble with 'Have a nice day'; it puts all the pressure on you. Now you've got to go out and somehow manage to have a good time, all because of some loose-lipped cashier. 'Have a nice day ...' Maybe I don't feel like having a nice day. Maybe, just maybe, I've had 116&amp;nbsp;nice days in a row and I'm ready, by God, for a crappy day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=7 uncensored words about George Carlin |newspaper=[[Times Herald-Record]] |date=2005-10-28 |url=http://archive.recordonline.com/archive/2005/10/28/cover28.htm |accessdate=2010-06-11 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qPztiO3G |archivedate=2010-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Safire]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that when the speaker of the phrase is genuine and maintains [[eye contact]], the act is a "social asset and a note of civility" in a busy world.&lt;ref name="Safire"/&gt; However, he stated that when the phrase is robotically said or said in a tone similar to "get lost", the utterance "comes across with a resounding clank of falsity".&lt;ref name="Safire"/&gt; Marilyn Gardner of ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' wrote that the "bland age of 'Have-a-nice-day' should come to a deserving end". She opined that service could not be "peddled as an image", and that substance is more important than style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=When Service Means More Than a Smile |author=Gardner, Marilyn |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=1993-10-07 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1993/1007/07132.html |accessdate=2010-09-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5snuMSfsW |archivedate=2010-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Satirical commentator [[Russell Baker]] wrote in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that he did not know [[Ma Bell]] was waning until she began using the phrase "have a nice day".&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite news |title=Come back, Ma Bell, please |author=Baker, Russell |authorlink=Russell Baker |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1983-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judith Martin|Miss Manners]] wrote in her 1990&amp;nbsp;book ''Miss Manners' Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium'' that although the phrase was trite, she wondered whether there was "so much deeply felt good will" permeating through the world that shallow friendliness ought to desist. She stated that for her, saying "goodbye" is sufficient because it expresses the same well-wishing farewell sentiment.&lt;ref name="Martin71"&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1990|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leil Lowndes wrote in her 2009&amp;nbsp;book ''How to Instantly Connect with Anyone'' that if someone says "have a nice day", the recipient should refrain from sarcastically responding "Thanks, but I have other plans" or "Gee, I was planning on having a miserable one, but now that you mention it, I think I'll have a nice one." Lowndes suggested that the response merely be "You, too."&lt;ref name="Lowndes219"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lowndes|2009|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carol Swiderski of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote that although saying "have a nice day" may not be sincere, the speaker has acknowledged that the recipient is there. She argued "[h]ave we become so analytic that we can't accept these little niceties without asking ourselves, 'Did he really mean it? Does she really care if I have a nice day?'"&lt;ref name="Swiderski"&gt;{{cite news |title=Once more, with feeling |author=Swiderski, Carol |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1984-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing that society has become so automated that going through a check-out line at a grocery store without having made [[eye contact]] or spoken with the checker is possible, Swiderski favored "insincerely meant human kindness to a robot".&lt;ref name="Swiderski"/&gt; She encouraged people to respond to "have a nice day" with "you have a nice day, too" because she hoped that when a sufficient number of people do this, there could be a time when people will sincerely intend it.&lt;ref name="Swiderski"/&gt;

Jeff Corbett of ''[[The Newcastle Herald]]'' defended "have a nice day" despite his characterization of the phrase as "wincingly American and so patently false in its sing-song delivery" by cashiers.&lt;ref name="Corbett"&gt;{{cite news |title=Put a sock in it, junior |author=Corbett, Jeff |newspaper=[[The Newcastle Herald]] |date=2009-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Corbett favored the phrase to the inquiries of the shopkeepers about his life; he preferred "have a nice day" because it did not entail a response.&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt;

[[Janice Turner]] of ''[[The Times]]'' supported the phrase, writing that she is indifferent to it being used insincerely or 1,000 times a day. She wrote that "have a nice day" is "soothing, even kind", in that it improves the interactions among millions of people crowded together.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite news |title=The nastiness that lies beneath 'have a nice day' |author=Turner, Janice |authorlink=Janice Turner |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=2010-03-27 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/janice_turner/article7078017.ece |accessdate=2010-08-19 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s7087yIc |archivedate=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Farewell", Wyatt said, would feel abnormal and could only be employed in an ironic context. The close of a transaction needed an oral ending.

'''Hermeticism''' in poetry, or '''hermetic poetry''', is a form of obscure and difficult poetry, as of the [[Symbolist]] school, wherein the language and imagery are subjective, and where the suggestive power of the sound of words is as important as their meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. F. Ebeling, ''The secret history of Hermes Trismegistus: Hermeticism from ancient to modern times'' (Transl. D. Lorton), [[Cornell University Press]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The name alludes to the mythical [[Hermes Trismegistus]],  supposed author of mystic doctrines composed in the [[Neoplatonic]] tradition.

Hermeticism was influential in the [[Renaissance]], after the translation of these [[Neoplatonic]] texts by [[Marsilio Ficino]]. Within the [[Novecento Italiano]], Hermetic poetry became an [[Italy|Italian]] literary movement in the 1920s and 1930s, developing between the two world wars.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Major features of this movement were reduction to essentials, abolishment of [[punctuation]], and brief, synthetic compositions, at times resulting in short works of only two or three verses.

==Terminology==
The term '''''ermetismo''''' was coined in [[Italian language|Italian]] by [[literary critic]] [[Francesco Flora]] (although with a very generic and superficial connotation) in 1936 and recalls a mystic conception of the poetic word because it makes reference to the legendary figure of [[Hermes Trismegistus]]  (''Thrice-Great Hermes'') going back to [[hellenistic]] times, with writings such as ''[[Asclepius]]'' and the ''[[Hermetica|Corpus Hermeticum]]'' attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Hermes Trismegistus is described in the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] in a [[Euhemerus|Euhemerist]] fashion, as a man who became a god, or as a man who was the son of a god. During the [[Renaissance]] it was accepted that Hermes Trismegistus was a contemporary of [[Moses]], however after [[Isaac Casaubon|Casaubon’s]] dating of the Hermetic writings as no earlier than the second or third century CE, the whole of Renaissance Hermeticism collapsed. Cf. W. J. Haanegraaff, ''New Age Religion and Western Culture'', Brill, Leiden, [[New York City]], 1996, p.390&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year (1936), [[Italian poetry|Italian poet]] [[Carlo Bo]] published an [[essay]] on the literary [[magazine]] ''[[Il Frontespizio]]'', by the title "Letteratura come vita (Literature as a way of life)", containing the theoretical-methodological fundamentals of hermetic poetry.
[[File:Salvatore Quasimodo 1959.jpg|thumb|Hermetic poet and [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]] [[Salvatore Quasimodo]]]]
On the literary plane, the term ''Hermeticism'' thus highlights a type of poetry which has a ''close'' (i.e., ''[[hermetic seal|hermetic]]'', hidden, sealed)&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Hermetic'' on [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hermetic Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; character, complex in its construction and usually achieved by a sequence of [[analogy|analogies]] difficult to interpret.

At the movement's core—which was modelled after the great [[France|French]] [[decadent movement|decadentist]] poets   [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]], [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]]—was a group of Italian poets, called ''hermeticists'', who followed the style of [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]] and [[Eugenio Montale]].

==Themes and styles==
Rejecting any direct social and political involvement, in order to detach themselves from the [[fascist]] culture, the hermetic group used a difficult and closed style in the analogic form, with a constant emotional introspection. Among these young intellectuals, some took strong [[anti-fascist]] stances, with [[Romano Bilenchi]], [[Elio Vittorini]], [[Alfonso Gatto]] and [[Vasco Pratolini]] being the main dissidents. "Tradition is Hermeticism's best ally".&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo Bo]], in his [[essay]] "Letteratura come vita (Literature as a way of life)", ''[[Frontespizio]]'' 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermetic poetry opposes verbal manipulation and the ease of mass communication, which began taking place during [[Europe]]'s dictatorial years, with the increasing brain-washing [[propaganda]] of the [[nazism|nazi]]-[[fascist]] regimes. Poetry therefore retreats into itself and assumes the task of returning sense to words, giving them back their [[semantics|semantic]] meaning, using them only when strictly necessary.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[Haiku]] poetry may possess similar features and functions.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hermetic poets pursue the ideal of a "pure poesy", an essential composition without educational aims. Their central theme is the desperate sense of loneliness modern man experiences, having lost the ancient values and [[myth]]s of the [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[positivism|positivistic]] [[society]], no longer retaining any certitudes to refer to. Man lives in an incomprehensible world, ravaged by wars and enslaved by dictatorships, therefore the poet has a disheartened vision of life, without illusions, and repudiates the word as an act of communication in order to give it an evocative sense only. So, hermetic poetry is poetry of moods, of interior reflection expressed by a subdued and pensive tone, through a refined and evocative language, concealing direct intimations to experience in a play of allusions.

To describe the fleeting course of human life, [[Salvatore Quasimodo|Quasimodo]] would compose this famous hermetic poem ''"Ed è subito sera"'':
:''Ognuno sta solo sul cuor della terra''
:''trafitto da un raggio di sole''
:''ed è subito sera''&lt;ref&gt;(Approx transl., ''Everyone stands alone on the heart of the earth / transfixed by a ray of sunshine / and it is suddenly night'') by [[Salvatore Quasimodo]], [[Nobel Prize]] 1959. Cf. an anthology of his [http://vagheggiando.blogspot.com/2006/05/uomo-del-mio-tempodi-salvatore.html poems].&lt;/ref&gt;

The hermetic poets took their inspiration from [[Ungaretti]]'s second book, ''[[Ungaretti#Published volumes|Sentimento del Tempo ("The Feeling of Time", 1933)]]'', with its complex analogies: one can thus consider [[Ungaretti]] as ''Hermeticism's'' first exponent.

In the field of hermetic literary critique, [[Carlo Bo]] was its main interpreter, with his discourse ''La letteratura come vita ("Literature as a way of life")'' dated 1938, where he wrote the actual  [[manifesto|hermetic manifesto]] by describing poetry as a moment of [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]. Among the other critics and theoreticians, to be mentioned are [[Oreste Macrì]], [[Giansiro Ferrata]], [[Luciano Anceschi]] and [[Mario Luzi]].

During the second half of the 1930s, and important hermetic group arose in [[Florence]], around the Italian [[magazine]]s  ''Il Frontespizio'' and ''[[Solaria (magazine)|Solaria]]'' who were inspired by the works of [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]], [[Salvatore Quasimodo]] e [[Arturo Onofri]], and directly referred to [[Europe]]an [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], also approaching more recent movements such as [[surrealism]] and [[existentialism]].

'''Italian irredentism in Switzerland''' was a political movement that promoted the unification to [[Italy]] of the Italian-speaking areas of [[Switzerland]] during the [[Risorgimento]].

==History==

In the early 19th century the ideals of unification in a single Nation of all the territories populated by Italian speaking people created the [[Italian irredentism]].

In southern Switzerland those ideals were minimally followed until the creation of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861 and up to [[World War I]].

Following the rise to power of [[Italian Fascism]], however, the initial moderate irredentism started to change to one full of aggression: the same [[Benito Mussolini]] created in the early 1930s the ''Partito Fascista Ticinese'' (Ticino Fascist Party).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpct.ch/pubblicazioni/generale/1986_fraromaeberna.shtml Fra Roma e Berna, di Mauro Cerutti (in Italian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830110602/http://www.fpct.ch/pubblicazioni/generale/1986_fraromaeberna.shtml |date=2011-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main ideal of this party was to bring the Italian frontier up to the [[Gotthard Pass|Gottardo Pass]] (''Catena mediana delle Alpi'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italiasvizzera150.it/img-schede/8-img1.jpg Map of "Catena mediana delle Alpi" as possible northern Italian border in Switzerland]&lt;/ref&gt;)  in the Alps through political unrest and possible referendums (supported, in case of need, by the Italian Army).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiasvizzera150.it/studenti.cfm?target=8|title=Italia-Svizzera: la storia dal 1861 al 2011|first=Contechnet.it massimo|last=rossi|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 was done a small tentative by the Ticino fascists: the March on Bellinzona", similar to the [[March on Rome]]. But it was successfully contrasted by socialist organizations, like "Liberi e Svizzeri" of Guglielmo Canevascini, promoted even by the Swiss government.&lt;ref&gt;M. Cerutti, Fra Roma e Berna. La Svizzera italiana nel ventennio fascista, p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

Successively, in the 1935 elections the fascists obtained just 2% of the votes and since then their movement faded away to less than 100 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wArTkIKE7WAC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=marcia%20su%20bellinzona%201934&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M7NuGyUtLJ&amp;sig=B8Mka8gIAdIpIFTalz1R9NVqWDk&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=UUmFTNraH5qKnAe4v5yTAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=marcia%20su%20bellinzona%201934&amp;f=false|title=Il cattolicesimo ticinese e i fascismi: la Chiesa e il partito conservatore ticinese nel periodo tra le due guerre mondiali|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Saint-Paul|accessdate=12 January 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:RegioniIrredenteItalia.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Italian areas called "irredente" in 1918. Ticino in green]]
Before [[World War II]] the Italian irredentism in Switzerland was reduced to have followers mainly between the descendants of Italians emigrated to Ticino at the end of the 19th century, but was ruled and promoted by a small group of ticino intellectuals with their active newspapers and propaganda.

The most important of these intellectuals was Teresina Bontempi, who created the magazine ''L'Adula''.  She denounced in her writings, together with Rosetta Colombi, the [[germanization]] of Canton Ticino promoted by the Swiss government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ps-ticino.ch/sonvico/mondo/pubblicazioni/Crespi,Ticino%20irredento04.htm  Il sogno irredentista del Ticino (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the German speaking population in Canton Ticino went from  2.6%  in 1837 to 5.34% in 1920 and nearly 10% in 1940.

As a consequence of this political activity she was involved in continuous problems with the Swiss government, that finally jailed her in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Ilse Shneiderfranken.Le industrie del Canton Ticino. Belinzona, 1937&lt;/ref&gt; She was forced to move to Italy as a political refugee after some months.

The most renowned fascist born in Canton Ticino was Aurelio Garobbio, who tried to imitate [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] with his organization called ''Giovani Ticinesi''.&lt;ref&gt;Garobbio, Aurelio. ''Gabriele D'Annunzio e i «Giovani Ticinesi»: le vicende de «L'Adula»'' p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; After 1935 Garobbio was the main responsible of the Italian irredentism in Switzerland and was with Mussolini until his death in spring 1945, when tried to organize a last fascist area of defense in [[Valtellina]] next to Ticino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2m_xg6W8oGUC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=aurelio%20garobbio&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eL5Ipaj9P7&amp;sig=Pn59UpC7B2OtcpxsUeI5toJj08I&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=RG2FTKqQHNOfnQeG4ZTxDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=aurelio%20garobbio&amp;f=false|title=Com'era rossa la mia valle: una storia di antiresistenza in Valtellina|first=Giuseppe|last=Rocco|date=1 January 1992|publisher=GRECO &amp; GRECO Editori|accessdate=12 January 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">'''Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology, and Religious Belief''' ({{lang-de|Vorlesungen und Gespräche über Ästhetik, Psychoanalyse und religiösen Glauben}}) is a series of notes transcribed by [[Yorick Smythies]], [[Rush Rhees]], and James Taylor from assorted lectures by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and published in 1967.&lt;ref name="springerlink"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n254782t5l634186/|title=Lectures and conversations on aesthetics, psychology and religious belief - Springer|accessdate=2014-10-14 | doi=10.1007/BF00137674|volume=3|journal=The Journal of Value Inquiry|pages=63–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lectures, at which [[Casimir Lewy]] was present, contain Wittgenstein's thoughts about [[aesthetics]] and [[religion]], alongside a critique of [[psychoanalysis]]. [[Wittgensteinian fideism]] originates from the remarks in the ''Lectures''. It is noteworthy that Eberhard Bubser in the introduction of the German edition states that: ″Wittgenstein would surely have not approved this release [...]″ (″Wittgenstein hätte diese Ausgabe bestimmt nicht gebilligt [...]″).&lt;ref name = "LWGer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vorlesungen und Gespräche über Ästhetik, Psychologie und Religion.|author1=Wittgenstein, L.| date=1966|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|location=Göttingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lectures on Aesthetics ==
One question Wittgenstein raises in his ''Lectures on Aesthetics'' is how we learn to use and recognize the words used to make an aesthetic judgment, such as ″beautiful″ (″schön″) or ″nice″ or (″fein″).&lt;ref name="LWGer" /&gt; He suggests that these words are firstly and often used like [[interjection]]s or gestures. Wittgenstein also notes that we seldom use these words in everyday language to make aesthetic judgments, but rather use words like ″right″ (″richtig″) or ″correct″ (″korrekt″).&lt;ref name="LWGer" /&gt; With regard to aesthetic pleasures, he also names a question that is recently under debate in aesthetics: How are distinctly aesthetic pleasures different from more ordinary pleasures? He makes a point in stating that ″One uses the same term in both cases [...]″ (″ Man gebraucht in beiden Fällen [...] dasselbe Wort″).&lt;ref name="LWGer" /&gt;

A recurring theme in these lectures is also Wittgenstein's firm rejection of the possibility that [[psychology]] may explain aesthetic experiences or judgments. This opinion is based on Wittgenstein's view that psychological ([[behaviorism|behaviorist]]) experiments would generate results based on mere descriptions of behavior and generalizations across large numbers of observers.

== Lectures on Religious Belief ==
In his Lectures on Religious Belief (''Vorlesungen über den religiösen Glauben''), Wittgenstein argues, among other things, that superficial grammatical similarities in the ''forms'' of both religious and factual statements mislead us into believing that they are fundamentally identical states of "belief."  This grammatical similarity, Wittgenstein argues, is merely a parallel ''expression'' of drastically different processes. "The '''expression''' of belief", Wittgenstein notes, "may play an absolutely minor role."&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology, and Religious Belief|author1=Wittgenstein, L.|author2=Barrett, C.|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520251816|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njMBZkDSjk0C|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4757">'''Lumia''' is a form of [[art]] that uses [[light]]; originally associated with music but was later associated with painting. The term was coined by a 20th-century artist, [[Thomas Wilfred]].&lt;ref name="CFM Collopy Choose this"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collopy|first1=Fred|title=Color, Form, and Motion: Dimensions of a Musical Art of Light|journal=Leonardo|volume=2000|issue=355|pages=355–356|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century artists began to promote colors and light together in their artworks.&lt;ref name="Esk Framework"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eskilan|first1=Stephen|title=Thomas Wilfred and Intermedia: Seeking a Framework for Lumia|journal=Leonardo|volume=2003|issue=65|pages=65–68|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilfred worked towards establishing lumia as a new form of art but the term never caught on. Despite creating the term lumia, Wilfred did not create the use of light in art.

== Thomas Wilfred ==
Thomas Wilfred, (1889–1968), was the first artist in the United States to use light as the sole means of expression for his artwork. He consistently used colored light in his works. Wilfred was born in [[Denmark]] in 1889 and emigrated to the U.S. in 1916. Wilfred explored light and color in art as early as 1905. In 1921, Wilfred created his first portable [[clavilux]], a machine that allowed for the creation and performance of lumia. Clavilux is a term in Latin that means "light played by key". In 1930 Wilfred founded a center for research in lumia, the Art Institute of Light. The institute closed down during World War ll. In the early 1930s he transitioned from the musical aspect of lumia to painting.&lt;ref name=MOMA /&gt; Wilfred planned to turn lumia into a formal art form, an "eighth art"; Wilfred wanted lumia to be its own art form of expression.

== Lumia ==
The three main elements of lumia, defined by Wilfred, are form, color, and motion in a dark space. The most important are said to be form and motion. Wilfred's original contribution to lumia was the introduction of a fourth dimension - time. Since 1924, lumia accompanied music, dance, and drama.&lt;ref name=MOMA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Museum of Modern Art|title=Thomas Wilfred: Lumia|url=https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/4690/releases/MOMA_1971_0127_89A.pdf?2010|website=https://www.moma.org|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Musical aspects ===
In a musical sense, Lumia is used to accompany music by adding a visual effect. Wilfred mentioned that Lumia has three factors, "Form, color, and motion are the three basic factors in lumia - as in all visual experience - and form and motion are the two most important."&lt;ref name="CFM Collopy Choose this" /&gt;

==== Clavilux ====
A term also coined by Thomas Wilfred to refer to his invention that allowed the creation and performance of Lumia. [[Clavilux]] means "light played by key" in Latin. The term used by other artists was known as color organ. 
	
==== Light Organ ====
Louis-Bertrand Castel invented the first light organ in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Synth Collopy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collopy|first1=Fred|title=Improvisational Lumia: Painting along with Musicians|journal=Leonardo|volume=2001|issue=353|page=353|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For more information check [[light organ]] or [[color organ]].

=== Painting aspects ===
There are different forms of art that use light as a medium:
	
==== Light art ====
[[Light art]] is an art form that focuses on the expression of light. Light art includes stained glass which transmits light through colored glass. This type of art dates back to the 4th century. This art is found in churches and mosques with stained glass windows. Another used of light art is shadow puppetry in which shadows can create moving images. This art can be dated back to 380 BC by the use of Plato in the Allegory of the cave. Light art is even used in modern photography and motion pictures which uses artificial light to help captures images. Artists recognized for their use of light include [[James Turrell]], [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]], [[Dan Flavin]],  [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Leo Villareal]], and [[Mel and Dorothy Tanner]].
	
==== Light painting ====
[[Light painting]] is a term used for a photographic technique. It is done by moving a light source or the camera while taking a long exposure photograph to produce a light painting. This creates a photograph that looks like it was painted with light. Painting with a light source dates back to 1889.

The term is also used popularly, if sometimes with subtly different meanings.

==Causes==
Freud argued that the Madonna–whore complex was caused by a split between the affectionate and the sexual currents in male desire.&lt;ref name="Sigmund Freud p. 251"&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7)  p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] and [[castration anxiety]] fears prohibit the affection felt for past incestuous objects from being attached to women who are sensually desired: "The whole sphere of love in such persons remains divided in the two directions personified in art as sacred and profane (or animal) love".&lt;ref name="Sigmund Freud p. 251"/&gt;  In order to minimize anxiety, the man categorizes women into two groups: women he can admire and women he finds sexually attractive. Whereas the man loves women in the former category, he despises and devalues the latter group.&lt;ref name="tuch"&gt;Tuch, Richard (2010). "Murder on the Mind: Tyrannical Power and Other Points along the Perverse Spectrum". ''[[The International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'' '''91''' (1): 141-162. {{doi|10.1111/j.1745-8315.2009.00220.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychoanalyst Richard Tuch suggests that Freud offered at least one alternative explanation for the Madonna–whore complex: &lt;blockquote&gt;This earlier theory is based not on oedipal-based castration anxiety but on man's primary [[Misogyny|hatred of women]], stimulated by the child's sense that he had been made to experience intolerable frustration and/or narcissistic injury at the hands of his [[mother]]. According to this theory, in adulthood the boy-turned-man seeks to avenge these mistreatments through [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] attacks on women who are stand-ins for mother.&lt;ref name="tuch"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is possible that such a split may be exacerbated when the sufferer is raised by a cold but overprotective mother&lt;ref&gt;P. A Sacco, ''Madonna Complex'' (2011) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; – a lack of emotional nurturing paradoxically strengthening an incestuous tie.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism'' (1993) p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Such a man will often court someone with maternal qualities, hoping to fulfill a need for maternal [[intimacy]] unmet in [[childhood]], only for a return of the repressed feelings surrounding the earlier relationship to prevent sexual satisfaction in the new.&lt;ref name="Sigmund Freud p. 251"/&gt;

Another theory claims that the Madonna–whore complex derives from the representations of women as either madonnas or whores in mythology and Judeo-Christian theology rather than developmental disabilities of individual men.&lt;ref name="feinman"&gt;Feinman, Clarice. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hpt7bVYB-fUC&amp;pg=PA3 ''Women in the criminal justice system'']. Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 1994, pp. 3&amp;ndash;4, {{ISBN|978-0-275-94486-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual politics==
[[Naomi Wolf]] considered that the [[sexual revolution]] had paradoxically intensified the importance of the virgin–whore split, leaving women to contend with the worst aspects of both images.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Wolf, ''Promiscuities'' (1997) p. 5 and p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Others consider that both men and women find integrating sensuality and an ideal femininity difficult to do within the same relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly/Marion Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (1999) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2017}}
*[[Alfred Hitchcock]] used the Madonna–whore dichotomy as an important mode of representing women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gay |first1= Volney P. |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Joy and the Objects of Psychoanalysis: Literature, Belief, and Neurosis |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QVoxmNrnRooC&amp;pg=PA109 |series= SUNY series in psychoanalysis and culture |year= 2001 |publisher= State University of New York Press |location= Albany |isbn= 978-0-7914-5099-4 |page= 109 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), for example, [[Kim Novak]] portrays two women that the hero cannot reconcile: a virtuous, blonde, sophisticated, sexually repressed "madonna" and a dark-haired, single, sensual "fallen woman".&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Paul. [https://books.google.com/books?id=UMEMCvyZ54EC&amp;pg=PA90 ''Dial "M" for Mother: A Freudian Hitchcock''].  Madison, N.J.: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2008, pp. 89&amp;ndash;91, {{ISBN|978-0-8386-4133-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Martin Scorsese]] films, ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[Raging Bull]]'', feature sexually obsessed protagonists, both played by [[Robert De Niro]], who exhibit the Madonna–whore complex with the women they interact with.
*In ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum]]'', set in a mental asylum during the 1960s, a time when the field of psychoanalysis was in chaos, the repressed character Dr. Arthur Arden, as portrayed by [[James Cromwell]], is fixated on a seemingly innocent and virtuous nun. When she later sexually propositions him, he bitterly defaces and then destroys a statue of the Virgin Mary (a.k.a. the Madonna), screaming "Whore!" at it accusingly. Earlier in the series, Arden had shown to subscribe to Freudian theory regarding feminine sexuality.
*Pamela Thurschwell highlighted "the range of [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]]'s women, which may often begin with a fine line in madonnas and whores but which often go on to undercut each other in spectacular reversals".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in N. Corcoran ed., ''Do You, Mr Jones?'' (2002) p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', women are strictly categorised and forced to wear a uniform of a specified colour, representative of their status as "Madonna" or "whore". The handmaids, who are disrespected and violated continually, are made to wear red, which is associated with sex and fertility; the protagonist, a Handmaid named June, is objectified and abused by Fred. In contrast, the wives wear blue which is reminiscent of the virgin Mary; Serena, Fred's wife, doesn't get the attention she wants from her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ScreenPrism|title=The Handmaid's Tale is About the Present|date=2018-05-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R45eiu8SXko|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mobile Cook's Galley''', part of the [[Museum of the Riverina]], is an [[heritage register|heritage-listed]] former mobile [[field kitchen]] and now museum collection and museum exhibit located in the [[Wagga Wagga Botanic Gardens]], Baden Powell Drive, [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]], in the [[City of Wagga Wagga]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was designed and built in 1934 by Jim McGilvray and Harold Fife. It is also known as the '''Chaff cutting train'''. The property is owned by [[City of Wagga Wagga]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 24 December 2004.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5053551|Mobile Cook's Galley, Museum of the Riverina|hr=01722|fn=H97/01122/1|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Cook's Galley was a mobile kitchen used to prepare food to feed the [[chaff]] cutting team owned and run by the Fife family during the 1930s and 1940s. Jim McGilvray (carpenter) and Harold Fife made it from recycled materials in 1934.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

It consists of a carriage of four steel wheels with a drawbar for towing. The drawbar was attached to the back of a Roden or McClaren traction engine. On top of the carriage a rectangular cabin was fitted with two single full-length doors and a small window at one end. The kitchen contains a coal stove for cooking, a wooden cupboard for storage (below) and food preparation (above). Elsewhere in the kitchen are a number of wooden packing cases, food bins, cooking and eating utensils, fire tools and pitching forks. 

===History of the Fife family business=== 
The origins of this particular branch of the Fife family go back to William Fife (1802-1880) who lived on a moderate {{convert|12|acre|ha|adj=on|order=flip}} farm at Drumcullion, [[County Fermanagh]], [[Ireland]]. All five surviving children of his first marriage to wife Bessie (nee Nixon 1807-1850) immigrated to New South Wales, Australia between 1859 and 1865. The aftermath of the potato famine, the death of their mother, their father remarrying and better prospects in an overseas colony were all contributing to factors to them leaving Ireland.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

The Keenan family, their neighbours in Ireland, had a daughter in [[Goulburn, New South Wales]], who agreed to sponsor the new migrants - Faithy (1836-1903), Nixon (1840-1916), John (1838-1874), George (1848-1916) and Eliza (1846-1939). Their ages on arrival were 23, 19, 24, 14 and 19 respectively.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt; Harold's great grandfather, Nixon started work as a yardman in a hotel, then became a carrier driving a bullock team between [[Sydney]] and [[Cooma]]. Later he bought and worked land in the vicinity of Goulburn. He married Elizabeth Cole (1849-1879) in 1870 who bore him six children.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

Harold's grandfather, William (1871-1956), the eldest son of Nixon, was the first of the family to operate a chaff cutting business. He also bred horses, worked as a railway line contractor during lean times, and a farmer in later life. He suffered the unfortunate accident of having his left foot crushed by the Buffalo Pitts Traction engine which drove his chaff cutting plant. He married Mary Jane Whittaker (1874-1904) in 1896 and they had two sons William Clyde (1897-1971) and James Nixon (1898-1972), Harold's father and uncle respectively who played a major role in the family's chaff cutting, produce store and bakery businesses in Wagga Wagga.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

It was while working on his father's (William's Snr) chaff cutting plant at Sherwin's Flat, [[Tarago, New South Wales|Tarago]], that Harolds' father met his future wife, and Harold's mother, Myrtle Wyatt.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

In about 1919 Harold's father, William Clyde, moved to Wagga Wagga to work for Les Howard who operated a chaff cutting plant. (Howard also originated from Goulburn). He was paid one shilling per ton and had an average weekly wage of 2 pounds 8 shillings. James Nixon (1898-1972), William's younger brother and Harold's uncle, joined him. Initially they camped in the Jockey's Room at the pony racecourse where Norton Street is now located and on the site which in years to come would house their Chaff Mill and Bulk Store.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

Harold and his mother joined his father and uncle in Wagga and with good prospects in the chaff industry persuaded their Uncle Tom, who lived in Goulburn, to purchase Les Howard's chaff cutting plant.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt; For a number of years they worked for Uncle Tom before buying the plant from him and establishing Fife Bros in 1925. Tom Fife still lived in Goulburn so the sale to his nephews suited him.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt; For almost three decades the family business travelled rural New South Wales cutting hay under contract to [[James Dunn (Australian politician)|James Dunn]] Ltd., Stockman and Kleinig &amp; Co., Kerridge &amp; McMahon Ltd., and E.D. McMahon &amp; Co.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

Chaff cutting at the time was a huge industry as motor trucks were only starting to become widespead and there were big markets for chaff in Sydney, in the coal fields of New South Wales and Roma Street, [[Brisbane]]. In these centres household deliveries were still done by horse drawn vehicles and as the mines were not fully mechanised pit ponies were still in use. With increasing prosperity the family bought their first of three Cliff and Bunting chaff cutters in 1927 and featured it at the Wagga Wagga Show.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

Their first vehicle was a [[Model T Ford]] which Clyde used in the evenings, after completing his daily stint on the plant, to travel between plants to deliver spare parts, bags, provisions and meat. A Chevrolet Utility was purchased from Minty's Dealership, Wagga Wagga in 1927.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

Crop failures, labour strikes and the depression brought difficult times and the chaff cutting plant stood in the backyard of the family's No.9 Shaw Street home for many years. During these tough times Harold's father took labouring work on the roads with the Wagga Wagga Municipal Council and as a fettler with the New South Wales Railways. His mother collected the fat from the Galley and made it into soap and also sold it to the soap works in town to earn much needed income.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt; Around 1940 the brothers purchased the Swan Bakery and soon owned and operated four shops drawing on the labour of various family members.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

Irene Wealand, Harold's aunt, remembers his mother making attractive and warm Wagga rugs from chaff bags for the household beds. The chaff bags were opened and filled with old woollen garments, sandwiched together sewn together and then covered with a heavy patterned material.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

In 1949 the brothers dissolved their business partnership. Harold and his father held onto the chaff cutting plant and the produce store, which had been established in 1945, at 45 Baylis Street, while his uncle (James) took over the two bakehouses and four retail outlets and formed J. N. Fife and Sons with his boys, Ken and Edgar (Ned). The business was expanded with new partners and later known as the Riverina Baking Co. A large bakehouse was built in Edward Street behind the Wagga Flour Mill. A chaff mill was established at [[The Rock, New South Wales|The Rock]] in 1945. This was a result of criticism levelled at the chaff cutters whose machinery due to their heavy steel wheels damaged the roads. A second mill was established at a site in Norton Street which lasted for about five years as difficulties were still experienced with transporting hay from the farms to the mill the authorities been particularly strict on over wide loading. The focus of the business shifted to the produce store and fertiliser.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

At the age of thirteen Harold joined his father in the chaff cutting plant. In his father's words, If he won't go to school, he might as well go to work!&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt; Harold started as a lunch boy and by his fourteenth birthday had moved to the chaff cutter been taught the ropes by the older men. At the age of eighteen (1937) a second plant was purchased and Harold put in charge. The plant was in [[Blayney, New South Wales|Blayney]] when news of the outbreak of the [[World War II]] was made known. Harold enlisted and served for three years. In 1944 he was discharged under the Manpower Act and returned to the cutter. In later years he followed in the footsteps of his father and became a City Councillor and a Deputy Mayor of Wagga Wagga both serving for a period of 21 years. Harold's younger brother [[Wal Fife|Wallace Clyde Fife]] (1929- ) went into politics and became the [[Division of Farrer|Member for Farrer]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

Harold's uncle, James, was badly burnt, in 1939, when the steam box exploded he was working on. Painted with Gentian Violet he spent many weeks recuperating at home.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

===Regional context and details of chaff cutting industry===
Chaff, as petrol is today, was a much-needed fuel when the horse was the primary source of power and transport on Riverina farms between the late 19th century and the end of Second World War. Horse numbers reached their peak in 1919 when there were two million horses in Australia - one horse for every two head of population. Over the next three decades the tractor gradually replaced them. To maintain their health and strength working horses needed to be fed three times per day. The most convenient form of fed was to cut hay into chaff and then mix it with other grains such as oats. One horse consumed about {{convert|5|LT|t|order=flip}} of feed per year. As a result most farmers kept a proportion of their crops for feed which would amount to {{convert|80|LT|t|order=flip}} per annum if they had two 8-horse teams. Others are known to have cut more than {{convert|200|LT|t|order=flip}} a year.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

Chaff was also stocked piled for periods of drought and used to feed cattle and sheep as well as horses. Additional demands for chaff came from teamsters and townspeople that used horses for transport.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt; As a result of these demands for horse feed chaff cutting became a profitable business with a number of firms, of which the Fife brothers were one, operating in the Riverina.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

The hay season usually stretched from early November until the end of January the following year. With the use of {{convert|5|to|8|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} binders, pulled by three horses, the hay was cut, tied into sheaves, and bundles of about ten sheaves, tied together to form a stook and left to dry. The stooks were then collected and carted to a site for the building of a haystack. Chaff cutting teams cut the hay into chaff either directly from the stooks in the paddock or from the haystacks. The Fife family plant consisted of a Roden or McLaren 8 horse power, two-cylinder traction engine, cook's galley, cliff and bunting chaff cutter, dobbin (or wagon), steam box, and water cart.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

Linked together in this order they formed a train which moved from one farm to another around the district. On arriving at a farm the plant was set up next to the haystack(s). The farmer had to supply the wood and water for the steam traction engine which had a capacity of 300 gallons. Up to four Furphy carts of water were used per day. The ratio of wood needed per ton of chaff cut was {{convert|112000|LT|t|order=flip}} of wood for one tonne of chaff. The wood was cut to {{convert|2|ft|9|in|cm|order=flip|adj=on}} lengths for feeding into the furnace.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

Stackmen, armed with pitching forks, passed the sheaves to a man at the steam box who cut the twine holding them together and feed the loose hay, with the help of a conveying mechanism, through the steam box {{convert|30|in|cm|order=flip}} long and {{convert|22|in|cm|order=flip}} wide. Steaming the hay before it was cut prevented it from breaking and greatly improved its quality. The steam was supplied from the steam engine through a pipe. When the hay reached the Chaff Cutter it was fed through a pair of rollers and cut. The cut hay fell onto a type of sieve, called a riddle board, which fed it onto an elevator taking it to a double chute of bagging cylinders. Long pieces of uncut hay fell onto a caving elevator which took it back through the cutters.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

There were two bag sewers who in turn filled and sewed alternate bags. The machine would cut 1 or 2 bags of chaff per minute which after been sewn up were loaded straight onto a truck which depending on its size was allowed to carry 152, 184 or 220 bags. The blades of the cutter had to be sharpened or replaced at regular intervals and Harold prides himself at been able to change and set six knives within three minutes.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

The traction engine supplied the steam box with steam as well as the power for driving the cutter. The pulley belt turning the drive wheels was {{convert|100|ft|m|order=flip}} long and {{convert|6|ft|m|order=flip}} wide and made of a compound of two or three ply leather sewn together with copper rivets. It cost [[Australian pound|A£]]100 (a pound a foot). It also generated a considerable amount of static electricity which made ones hair stand upright if you stood beneath it. The dobbin was either a three wheel or four-wheel cart used to carry new bags, tarpaulins, sleeping equipment and spare parts. A horse drawn Furphy Cart was used to bring dam water to the engine for steaming purposes.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

Drinking water and water used for cooking was stored in a {{convert|100|impgal|l|adj=on|order=flip}} tank and two {{convert|44|impgal|l|adj=on|order=flip}} drums were brought separately to the galley by Clyde Fife. The tank and drums were placed at the back of the galley.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

Time spent on a farm varied from as short as a day to a week. On average the plant cut {{convert|40|LT|t|order=flip}} a day but they could reach {{convert|60|LT|t|order=flip}} if pushed to the limit.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

The normal routine was an eleven hour day, starting at 7:00am, stopping for a short smoke break at 9:00am, dinner between 12 noon and 1:00pm, a ten minute tea break at 3:00pm and calling it a day around 6:00pm. The business operated for all but two weeks in the year and in good times the Fife family owned and operated two plants.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

The routine of the cook was as follows: The wood stove was fired at 5:45am for a 6:30am breakfast to facilitate a 7:00am start. Because of the heavy labour involved breakfast consisted of one pound of sausage per man with toast and tea. Dinner consisted of roast meat, potatoes, carrots, parsnips and turnips with a sweet to end. The evening meal was usually cold meats and salads. Scones, jam tarts and biscuits were served during the mid-morning and mid-afternoon breaks. Tea appeared at all meals.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

When the chaff cutting plant was in full production sixteen men were fed from the galley. When out in the field provisions were usually delivered on a Monday supplemented with fresh bread and meat on a Wednesday due to the absence of refrigeration.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

Rates of pay for the various labourers were as follows:
*Water Joey: 4 pence plus food
*Stackmen: 4 pence plus food
*Steam Box Feeder: 4 pence plus food
*Cutter/Feeder: 5 pence plus food
*Bag Sewers: 6 pence plus food
*Cook: 2 pounds, 1 shilling per week, plus three pence per ton
*Driver: Retainer (not disclosed)
*Hammocks for the Cook and Engine Driver were strung beneath the Galley (chains still present) while the rest of the men made makeshift mattresses from bales of hay. Wagga Rugs were the principal source of warmth.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Mobile Cook's Galley located at the Botanic Gardens site of the Museum of the Riverina (3).jpg|thumb|Interior of Mobile Cook's Galley]]
It consists of a carriage of four steel wheels with a drawbar for towing. The drawbar was attached to the back of a Roden or McClaren traction engine. On top of the carriage a rectangular cabin was fitted with two single full-length doors and a small window at one end. The kitchen contains a coal stove for cooking, a wooden cupboard for storage (below) and food preparation (above). Elsewhere in the kitchen are a number of wooden packing cases, food bins, cooking and eating utensils, fire tools and pitching forks.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

The galley was built in 1935 and operated until 1954.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

=== Condition ===

As at 22 October 2004, the item was intact and in a good, sound condition. With the exception of a number of new wooden planks on its rear platform, a material foot plate at its entrance, and a small number of nuts and bolts in the doors, it remains in original condition.  This adds considerably to its value and importance as i's surfaces and feature retain their unique working characteristics.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

The mobile galley is believed to be one of only two retained in NSW and has been retained substantially in its original built and used condition.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
As at 14 June 2006, the Cook's Galley, as an element of the Fife family chaff cutting plant, was a significant item representing a historical phase of grain harvesting in the Riverina.  It represents a period  between the 1880s and 1940s that saw the dominance of horse-drawn power for rural farm operations and transport generally throughout NSW.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

Chaff cutting provided fuel for horses which were the principle form of power and transport on farms and the cities during the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. They pulled the drays, wagons or a variety implements for the sowing, harvesting or transporting of wheat, machinery, for mining operations, and delivery of other produce.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

With the rest of the chaff cutting plant having been broken up, the Cook's Galley remains a tangible example of the Fife chaff cutting business and about the men who worked this and similar machines on a number of farms in rural New South Wales.  The family, great grandchildren and grandchildren of Irish migrants, contributed to the rural economy and political life of the Riverina.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

The item retains a high level of integrity and significant display and educational roles.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

Mobile Cook's Galley, Museum of the Riverina was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 24 December 2004 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''

The Cook's Galley was part of a larger chaff cutting plant owned and operated by the local Wagga Wagga Fife family.  It represents a distinct stage in the NSW economy where horses played a seminal role in rural, manufacturing, mining and transport industries. In the days before motorised machinery such as tractors and lorries, securing chaff for horse feed was a critical task in servicing the State's animal labour force.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''

The Fife family chaff cutting "trains", that included a mobile cook's galley, played an important role in the harvesting of chaff for a thirty year period.  The teams were a common fixture on rural properties throughout the Riverina, [[Central West (New South Wales)|Central West]] and North West of NSW.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''

The Mobile Galley was an element in a travelling "train" that comprised a steam-powered traction engine that towed the kitchen, a chaff cutting machine, a dobbin (wagon), a steam box and a water cart.  Collectively, the "train" showed a marked level of local ingenuity in the adaptation of existing vehicle types for a specific rural technological need.  The mobile galley was hand built from an original stone wagon, with the introduction of a cabin area fitted out specifically to cook and store food in remote farm areas.  It had to be self-contained and provide 3+ meals a day for periods extending up to seven days.  While subject to harsh conditions, the survival of the vehicle in a near-original form is testimony to the inventiveness and skills of its builders, Jim McGilvray (carpenter) and Harold Fife of Wagga.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

Originating from Ireland and settling in Goulburn between 1859 and 1865, the Fife family remain a prominent family in the Riverina district. The Fife Brothers company was formed in Wagga during 1925, although family members had already settled and been working in the chaff industry there.  The successful family business operated throughout NSW for some thirty years, surviving the [[Great Depression in Australia|Depression years]] and World War Two.  The family diversified into chaff mill, bakery and produce areas, and several members played prominent roles in local and Federal politics.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

Life in the chaff cutting industry involved long hard labour, and the provision of meals and refreshments through the mobile 'canteen's' played an important social role in the servicing and support of the local labour market.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

The galley's integrity and retention by the original family which built and operated the vehicle contributes to its social significance values.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

The Cook's Galley and original chaff cutting "train" has been effectively researched and interpreted and it is unlikely that significant new insights will be documented regarding its impact on past farming and agricultural practices.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

The Cook's Galley is unique in NSW being one of only two known retained examples of a mobile farm kitchen and retains a high level of integrity.  Now a fixture of the respected Museum of the Riverina, the Cook's Galley offers a unique opportunity to examine a past, defunct, way of rural life - the harvesting of chaff to provide feed for the working horse population of NSW.  The importance of this industry is identified with the State's horse population of 1919 being 2.5 million - one for every two people in the State.  With the widespread introduction of mechanized machinery on the farm, particularly following World War Two, the chaff industry was lost to the tide of petroleum and other fuel needs.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''

The mobile cook's galley is today representative of a once commonplace rural activity in the grain harvesting areas of NSW.  The growing, cutting, storage and processing of grains for chaff, supplied necessary horse feed and stock food reserves.  The industry therefore played a significant underlying role in the development and support of the State's rural and general economies at a time that depended on horse-drawn power for many sectors of industry.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1722/&gt;

The '''Monmouth Police Station''' is a [[Grade II listed]] building in the town centre of [[Monmouth]], Monmouthshire, Wales. It is located in the historic [[Glendower Street, Monmouth|Glendower Street]] neighbourhood, within the [[Monmouth Town Walls and Defences|medieval town walls]]. In March 2012, it was announced that the Monmouth Police Station was one of seventeen police stations in [[South East Wales]] that would no longer be open to the public.

==History==

[[File:Monnow street in April 1931.jpg|thumb|240px|right|April 1931 funeral procession for William Bullock, Superintendent of Police]]
Before 1881, the town of Monmouth maintained and staffed its own police station. [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire County]] assumed control of Monmouth for policing in 1881, and Monmouth eliminated its own police force. The county rented a building in Agincourt Street as a police station. In 1895, the [[Monmouthshire County Council]] purchased a building in Glendower Street, and redeveloped it as a police station. The Agincourt Street facility was no longer needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Law times reports: containing all the cases argued and determined in the House of Lords, Volume 87|year=1903|publisher=Law Times Office|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0S4yAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=23+Glendower+Street,+Monmouthshire+County+Council&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TrGQu9YTgN&amp;sig=Th_lOIT0t0IF1dDx57s5xJOkVbg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FanIT4rCGYr22AXYhd3QDQ&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=23%20Glendower%20Street%2C%20Monmouthshire%20County%20Council&amp;f=false|author=Great Britain, Courts|accessdate=4 June 2012|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kelly's Directory]] of Monmouthshire indicates that, in 1901, the Monmouth Police Station on Glendower Street was staffed by Captain Vincent E. Parker, "Superintendent of the Borough County Constabulary," as well as two sergeants and seven constables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire 1901&amp;nbsp;– Monmouth&amp;nbsp;– Part 3: Public Establishments, Military, Poor Relief &amp; Public Officers|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~familyalbum/kmon3.htm|work=freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com|publisher=Hosted by [[Rootsweb]]|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police Superintendent Parker did not live at the police station; rather, he resided in the [[Overmonnow]] area with his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker|first=Vincent C E|title=1901 Wales Census|work=ancestry.com|publisher=Census Returns of England and Wales, 1901.

Police Sergeant John Tucker resided at 13 A Glendower Street with his family. Police constable James Collins boarded there as well.&lt;ref name=tucker&gt;{{cite web|last=Tucker|first=John|title=1901 Wales Census|work=ancestry.com|publisher=Census Returns of England and Wales, 1901.

In 1911, the address of the Monmouth Police Station was recorded as 15 Glendower Street. The station was the residence of Police Sergeant Charles Jones, a native of Herefordshire, and his family. Constables Albert Jenkins and Frederick Dries, of Monmouthshire and Middlesex respectively, boarded there as well.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Charles|title=1911 Wales Census|work=ancestry.com|publisher=Census Returns of England and Wales, 1911.

The National Archives of the UK (as re-printed on Ancestry.com)|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Bullock was Superintendent of Police in 1923. His title was "Superintendent of the County and Borough Constabulary." Two sergeants and six constables were also at Glendower Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.K., City and County Directories, 1600s–1900s|work=ancestry.com|publisher=[[Kelly's Directory]] of Monmouthshire 1923 (as re-printed on Ancestry.com)|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Monmouth Police Station at 19 Glendower Street is a mid 19th-century, [[listed building]]. It is located within the medieval walls of the town, built around 1300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monnow Bridge|url=http://www.cofiadurcahcymru.org.uk/arch/query/page.php?watprn=GGAT01256g&amp;dbname=ggat&amp;tbname=core|work=cofiadurcahcymru.org.uk|publisher=The [[Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust]] [[Historic Environment Record]]|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main building is three storeys with a four-bay elevation, and there is a two-storey extension to the right with a three-bay elevation. The exterior is stucco and there is a [[hip roof|hipped]] tile roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police Station|url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/31994/details/POLICE+STATION/|work=coflein.gov.uk|publisher=[[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]]|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glendower Street, the site of the Monmouth Police Station since 1895, has been partially renumbered since the early 20th century. In 1901, the station (or the building housing some of the police staff) was documented at 13A Glendower Street, the record immediately next to that for the Druid's Head Inn at 19 Glendower Street.&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt; In 1911, the station was at 15 Glendower Street.&lt;ref name=jones/&gt; Decades later, at the time of the heritage listings, at least a portion of the police building was recorded at 17 Glendower Street.&lt;ref name=seventeen/&gt;

There is a separate [[COFLEIN|Coflein]] listing at 19 Glendower Street. It describes an old pub with a two-storey, two-bay elevation and a [[roughcast]] exterior. This is a reference to the [[Druid's Head Inn, Monmouth|Druid's Head Inn]], to the immediate left (southeast) of the police station.

The MOSP began in 2009 in response to the perceived increase in anti-social behaviour of Monmouth youths. When queried, local children had noted the lack of youth facilities in the Monmouth area and had suggested a new skate park. The MOSP team meets regularly and plans fundraising activities to finance the skate park, with the event scheduled for June 2012 a zip line in [[Chepstow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Get extreme for the Monmouth Off Street Project|url=http://www.gwent.police.uk/news/article/article/get-extreme-for-the-monmouth-off-street-project/|work=gwent.police.uk|publisher=Gwent Police|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2012, the ''[[BBC News]]'' reported that as of July of that year, seventeen police stations in [[South East Wales]] would close to the public, with only five still offering front desk service. The closures were reported to be undertaken as part of a program of cost-saving measures at Gwent Police. The Monmouth Police Station was one of the buildings that would no longer be open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gwent Police to close 17 stations to public|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-17350017|accessdate=4 June 2012|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nenana Valley''' is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] site in the [[Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area]] of [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bulletin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYMeAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA290|accessdate=2 May 2013|year=1931|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bigelow1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy H.

The site was first occupied around 11,000 years ago (early [[Holocene]]) and  represents one of the earliest known sites in Arctic North America. The location of artifacts in the stratigraphic column suggests that, originally, the site was not occupied year-round, and that during the last glacial period people would have been travelling back and forth between North America and Russia, using this site as an outpost. Zooarchaeological evidence, such as mammoth and sheep bones, suggest that people were following these paths seasonally for hunting. As the ice age ended, the site would have become a more permanent residence. Points found here suggest that the culture is ancestral to that which created the Clovis points, of which variations can be found across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powers|first1=William|last2=John|first2=Hoffecker|title=Late Pleistocene Settlement in the Nenana Valley, Central Alaska|journal=American Antiquity|date=April 1989|volume=54|issue=2|pages=263–87|doi=10.2307/281707|jstor=10.2307/281707|publisher=Society for American Archeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3941">A '''parade of horribles''' is both a literal [[parade]] and a [[rhetorical device]].

==As a literal parade==
The phrase ''parade of horribles'' originally referred to a literal parade of people wearing comic and grotesque costumes, rather like the [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] [[Mummers Parade]]. It was a traditional feature of [[Fourth of July]] parades in parts of the [[United States]] in the 19th century, and "Horribles Parades" continue to be part of the Independence Day celebration in several [[New England]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-8564729.html "Horribles Parades a weird tradition." ''The Boston Globe'', July 4, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; A 1926 newspaper article about July the Fourth celebrations in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of [[New Hampshire]] notes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Old-time celebrations are to be held tomorrow at [[Littleton, New Hampshire|Littleton]], [[Lancaster, New Hampshire|Lancaster]], [[Colebrook, New Hampshire|Colebrook]], and [[Conway, New Hampshire|Conway]], with all the usual features of street parades of horribles and grotesques, brass bands, decorated automobiles and vehicles, exhibitions by fire departments, basket picnics in convenient groves...&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1926/07/04/archives/mountain-season-early-camp-and-stream-bring-many-visitors-to-new.html "Mountain Season Early. Camp and Stream Bring Many Visitors to New Hampshire Despite Coolness". ''The New York Times'', July 4, 1926, p. X8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Founded in 1926, the [[Ancient and Horribles Parade]] in [[Chepachet, Rhode Island]] continues this tradition.

Other rural New England towns, such as [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts]] and [[Mendon, Massachusetts]] still hold annual Horribles Parades.&lt;ref&gt;http://uptondaily.com/2015/07/02/mendon-to-hold-horribles-parade/&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a rhetorical device==
A parade of horribles is also a [[rhetorical device]] whereby the speaker argues against taking a certain course of action by listing a number of extremely undesirable events which will ostensibly result from the action.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DdU9NHiX3OcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Rhode+Island+Curiosities:+Quirky+Characters,+Roadside+Oddities+%26+Other+Offbeat+Stuff%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yeooTKmwO8O88gb3iL3EDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Brown, Seth. ''Rhode Island Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities &amp; Other Offbeat Stuff'' (Globe Pequot, 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enotalone.com/article/6762.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017085117/http://www.enotalone.com/article/6762.html |archivedate=2010-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its power lies in the emotional impact of the unpleasant predictions; however, a parade of horribles can potentially be a [[fallacy]] if one or more of the following is true:
*The action doesn't actually change the likelihood of the "horribles" occurring. The "horribles" could be unlikely to occur even if the action is taken, or they could be likely to happen anyway even if the action is avoided. This is an [[appeal to probability]], and can be viewed as a [[non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]] insofar as the action has no causal relation to the "horribles". 
*The argument relies solely on the emotional impact of the "horribles" (an [[appeal to emotion]]).
*The "horribles" are not actually bad.
*The "horribles" have a low probability of occurring when compared to the high probability of good occurring.  

A parade of horribles is a type of [[hyperbole]], because it exaggerates the negative results of the action, arguing that "If we do this, ultimately all these horrible things will happen".

A '''pedagogical grammar''' is a modern approach in [[linguistics]] intended to aid in teaching an additional language.  

==Structure==

This method of teaching is divided into the descriptive: grammatical analysis, and the prescriptive: the articulation of a set of rules. Following an analysis of the context in which it is to be used, one grammatical form or arrangement of words will be determined to be the most appropriate.It helps in learning the grammar of foreign languages.  Pedagogical grammars typically require rules that are definite, coherent, non-technical, cumulative and [[heuristics|heuristic]].&lt;ref&gt;Odlin, T., (ed.) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TbI8AdapFNAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Perspectives on Pedagogical Grammar],'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; As the rules themselves accumulate, an [[axiomatic system]] is formed between the two languages that should then enable a native speaker of the first to learn the second.&lt;ref&gt;Thomann, J., ''[https://www.academia.edu/download/31885265/lfg02thomann-num.pdf LFG as a pedagogical grammar],'' in King, T. and Butt, M. (eds.) 'Proceedings of the LFG02 Conference,' (Stanford: CSLI Publications, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Educated at [[Queen's College, Oxford]], he began his career as a meteorologist. Although an [[English people|Englishman]] by birth, he developed a lifelong interest in the history and genealogy of the royal families and nobility of mediaeval [[Wales]]. He learned to read the [[Welsh language]] and went on to publish a compendious series of volumes containing the edited texts of medieval Welsh genealogical tracts and his own detailed reconstructions of family lines. His work is now an essential resource for any serious student of [[History of Wales|early and medieval Welsh history]].

Much of his work has been made available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cadair.aber.ac.uk/dspace/handle/2160/4026  Prosiect Bartrum/Bartrum Project (Aberystwyth University)]

'''Potawatomi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɒ|t|ə|ˈ|w|ɒ|t|ə|m|i}}, also spelled '''Pottawatomie'''; in Potawatomi '''Bodéwadmimwen,''' or '''Bodéwadmi Zheshmowen,''' or '''Neshnabémwen''') is a [[Central Algonquian languages|Central]] [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]]. It was historically spoken by the [[Potawatomi|Pottawatomi people]] who lived around the [[Great Lakes]] in what are now [[Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin]] in the [[United States]], and in southern [[Ontario]] in [[Canada]]. Federally recognized tribes in Michigan and Oklahoma are working to revive the language.

== Language revitalization  ==
Cecilia Miksekwe Jackson, one of the last surviving native speakers of Potawatomi, died in May 2011, at the age of 88. She was known for working to preserve and teach the language. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cjonline.com/news/2011-05-31/tribal-elder-dedicated-language-preservation-dies-88|title = Tribal elder dies at 88: Woman was dedicated to Potawatomi language preservation|date = 31 May 2011|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federally recognized [[Pokégnek Bodéwadmik Pokagon Band of Potawatomi]] started a master-apprentice program in which a "language student (the language apprentice) will be paired with fluent Potawatomi speakers (the language masters)" in January 2013.&lt;ref name="pokagonband" /&gt; In addition, classes in the Potowatomi language are available, including those at the [[Hannahville Indian Community|Hannahville]] summer immersion camp,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Classification==

Potawatomi is a member of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language family]] (itself a member of the larger [[Algic languages|Algic stock]]). It is usually classified as a Central Algonquian language, with languages such as [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Menominee language|Menominee]], [[Miami-Illinois]], [[Shawnee]] and [[Fox language|Fox]]. The label "Central Algonquian" signifies a geographic grouping rather than the group of languages descended from a common ancestor language within the Algonquian family. Of the Central languages, Potawatomi is most similar to [[Ojibwe]], but it also has borrowed a considerable amount of vocabulary from the [[Sauk people|Sauk]].

Generally, in developments since [[Indian Removal]] in the 19th century, Potawatomi has become differentiated in North America among separated populations. It is divided between Northern Potawatomi, spoken in Ontario, Canada; and Michigan and Wisconsin of the United States; and Southern Potawatomi, which is spoken in Kansas and Oklahoma, where certain Pottawatomi ancestors were removed who had formerly lived in Illinois and other areas east of the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.native-languages.org/potawatomi_guide.htm Native Languages of the Americas: Potawatomi Pronunciation and Spelling Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing systems==
===Current writing system===
Though no standard orthography has been agreed upon by the Potawatomi communities, the system most commonly used is the "Pedagogical System" developed by the Wisconsin Native American Languages Program (WNALP). As the name suggests, it was designed to be used in language teaching. The system is based on the [[Roman alphabet]] and is phonemic, with each letter or digraph representing a contrastive sound. The letters used are a b ch d e é g ' h i j k m n o p s sh t w y z zh.

In Kansas, a different system called BWAKA is used. It too is both based on the Roman alphabet and phonemic, with each letter or digraph representing a contrastive sound. The letters used are ' a b c d e e' g h i I j k m n o p s sh t u w y z zh.

===Traditional system===
The [[Great Lakes Algonquian syllabary|traditional system]] used in writing Potawatomi is a form of syllabic writing. Potawatomi, [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]], [[Sac (people)|Sac]], [[Fox (Native American)|Fox]] and [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] communities all used it. Derived from the Roman alphabet, it resembles handwritten Roman text. However, unlike the [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]] or the [[Cherokee language|Cherokee alphabet]], it has not yet been incorporated into the [[Unicode]] standards.

Each Potawatomi syllabic block in the system has at least 2 of the 17 alphabetic letters, which consist of 13 consonants and 4 vowels. Of the 13 phonemic consonantal letters, the /h/, written {{angbr|&lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;}}, is optional.

==Phonology==
Here, the phonology of the Northern dialect is described, which differs somewhat from that of the Southern dialect, spoken in Kansas.

There are 5 vowel [[phoneme]]s, 4 [[diphthong]]s, and 19 consonant phonemes.

{{angbr|é}}, which is often written as {{angbr|e'}}, represents an open-mid front unrounded vowel, {{IPAslink|ɛ}}. {{angbr|e}} represents the [[schwa]], {{IPA|/ə/}}, which has several [[allophone|allophonic]] variants. Before /n/, it becomes {{IPA|[ɪ]}}; before /k/, it becomes {{IPA|/ɡ/}} or {{IPA|/ʔ/}}; and word-finally, it becomes {{IPA|[ʌ]}}.

{{angbr|o}} is pronounced /u/ in Michigan and /o/ elsewhere. When it is in a closed syllable, it is pronounced {{IPA|[ʊ]}}. There are also four diphthongs, {{IPA|/ɛj ɛw əj əw/}}, spelled {{angbr|éy éw ey ew}}. Phonemic {{IPA|/əj əw/}} are realized as {{IPA|[ɪj ʌw]}}.

[[Obstruent]]s, as in many other Algonquian languages, do not have a [[voiceless|voicing]] distinction ''per se'' but what is better termed a "strong"/"weak" distinction. "Strong" consonants, written as [[voiceless]] ({{angbr|p t k kw}}), are always voiceless, often [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]], and longer in duration than the "weak" consonants, which are written as [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] ({{angbr|b d g gw}}) and are often voiced and are not aspirated. [[Nasal stop|Nasals]] before another consonant become [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]], and /t/, /d/, and /n/ are [[dental consonant|dental]]: {{IPA|[t̪ d̪ n̪]}}.

==Morphology==
Potawatomi has six parts of speech: noun, verb, pronoun, prenoun, preverb, and particle.&lt;ref&gt;Buszard-Welcher, L. (2003) "[https://archive.org/details/ConstructionalPolysemyAndMentalSpacesInPotawatomiDiscourse Constructional Polysemy and Mental Spaces in Potawatomi Discourse]". PhD Thesis, U.C. Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronouns===
There are two main types of pronoun: personal pronouns and demonstrative pronouns. As nouns and verbs use inflection to describe [[anaphoric reference]], the main use of the free pronouns is for emphasis.

====Personal pronouns====
Potawatomi Personal Pronouns, due to vowel [[syncope (phonology)|syncope]], resemble [[Ottawa dialect|Odaawaa]], but structurally they resemble closer to the Personal Pronouns used by the [[Swampy Cree language]]:

==Correspondences to Ojibwe==
The relatively-recent split from Ojibwe makes Potawatomi still exhibit strong correspondences, especifically with the ''Odaawaa'' (Ottawa) dialect.

'''Qanun''' is an Arabic word ({{lang-ar|قانون}}, ''qānūn''; {{lang-ota|قانون}}, ''kānūn'', derived from {{lang-grc|κανών}} ''kanōn'', which is also the root for the modern English word "[[canon law|canon]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kanw/n|κανών|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Between God and the Sultan: A History of Islamic Law|author=Knut S.

It is thus frequently translated as "dynastic law". The idea of ''kanun'' first entered the Muslim World in the thirteenth century, as it was borrowed from the [[Mongol Empire]] in the aftermath of their invasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burak |first=Guy |title=The Second Formation of Islamic Law: The Ḥanafī School in the Early Modern Ottoman Empire |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2015 |isbn=978-1-107-09027-9 |pages=17–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10th sultan of the Ottoman Empire, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman]] was known in the Ottoman Empire as Suleiman Kanuni ("the Lawgiver"), due to his code of laws. 

After the fall of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in 1258, a practice known to the [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Mongols]] transformed itself into qanun, which gave power to [[caliphate|caliphs]], [[governor]]s, and sultans alike to "make their own regulations for activities not addressed by the sharia."&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"&gt;Berg, Herbert. "Islamic Law." Berkshire Encyclopedia of World History 3 (2005): 1030. In History Reference Center[database online]. Available from Snowden Library . Retrieved February 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This became increasingly important as the Middle East started to modernize, thus running into the problems of a modern state, which were not covered by sharia. The Qanun began to unfold as early as Umar I (586–644 CE).&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"/&gt; Many of the regulations covered by qanun were based on financial matters or tax systems adapted through the law and regulations of those territories Islam conquered.&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"/&gt;

The term ḳānūn derives itself from the Greek word κανών. Originally having the less abstract meaning of “any straight rod” it then later referred to any “measure or rule” in Greek. The word was then translated into and adopted by the Arabic language after the Ottoman Empire’s conquest of Egypt under Sultan [[Selim I]] (ca. 1516). In the Ottoman empire, the term ḳānūn still carried the word’s original meanings of a system of tax regulation. However, it later came to also refer to “code of regulations” or “state law”, a well-defined secular distinction to “Muslim law” known as the s̲h̲arīʿa. The ḳānūn took on significant importance during the period of modernization in the Ottoman Empire. The ḳānūn and s̲h̲arīʿa did not contradict each other concerning administrative matters, and therefore the ḳānūn was assimilated easily into Ottoman regulatory functions. The ḳānūn promulgated by Ottoman sultans also came to be used for financial and penal law. Under Sultan Mehmed II (1451-1481) the ḳānūn continued to be strictly applied for these practices. However due to the influence of [[Ebussuud Efendi|Abu ʾl-Suʿūd]], [[Grand Mufti|grand muftī]] of Istanbul from 1545 to 1574 the ḳānūn was applied to deal with matters concerning property rights as well. Previously, property rights were exclusively under the jurisdiction of the s̲h̲arīʿa. Despite this seeming contradiction, due to skillful bureaucratic operations, the ḳānūn and the s̲h̲arīʿa existed harmoniously. The ḳānūn has retained its relevance in the Middle East regarding civil, commercial, administrative, and penal laws that were inspired by originally Western legislation. It also has an influence in the ways that provisions of the s̲h̲arīʿa are reproduced.&lt;ref&gt;Linant de Bellefonds, Y., Cahen, Cl., İnalcık, Halil, and Ed. “Ḳānūn”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17579">{{Italic title}}{{canon law}}'''''{{lang|la|Regulæ Juris}}''''', also spelled as '''''{{lang|la|Regulae}} -''''' and '''''- {{lang|la|Iuris}}''''' ({{Language with name/for||2=Latin|3=Rules of Law|links=no}}) is a generic term for general rules or principles serving chiefly for the interpretation of canon laws.

==Canonical use==
{{see also|Interpretation (canon law)}}
In a specific sense, however, ''{{lang|la|regulæ juris}}'' are certain fundamental laws in the form of [[axiom]]s found in the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]'', eleven inserted by [[Pope Gregory IX]] at the end of the fifth Book of [[Decretals]], eighty-eight by [[Pope Boniface VIII]] in the last title of ''Liber Sextus Decretalium''.

These rules are an exposition of several laws on the same subject, conclusions or deductions, rather than principles of law drawn from constitutions or decisions, and consequently reserved to the last title of the two books mentioned, in imitation of [[Justinian]] in the "Digest" (L, l, tit. 17).

While these rules are of great importance, it must be stated that few general statements are without exception. Some of the axioms are applicable in all matters, others are confined to judicial trials, benefices, etc. As examples the following are taken from the Liber Sextus: No one can be held to the impossible (6); Time does not heal what was invalid from the beginning (18); What is not allowed to the defendant, is denied to the plaintiff (32); What one is not permitted to do in his own name, he may not do through another (47).

== The Eighty-Eight by Boniface VIII ==
These 88 legal dicta or maxims known as ''{{lang|la|De Regulis Juris}}'' were promulgated in 1298 by [[Boniface VIII]].

'''Shaik Rafi''' was an Indian author. He is best known for ''Modern Sons of the Pharaohs.''

== Biography ==
He is related to Tobias Leeder and Henry Tucker.  The Leeder side of the family was split into the Leeder family and the Tucker family. The two families left Egypt in 1836 for England.  Tobias's father John was transferred by the army to New Zealand and Henry's father John moved to Wales.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== ''Modern Sons of the Pharaohs'' ==
''Modern Sons of the Pharaohs'' is a study of Egypt's [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christians]], their religious rites and their relationship with Muslims.The author analyses Muslim-Christian relations in Egypt prior to the 1919 Revolution for independence from the British and believes the British occupation has ruined the relationship between Muslims and Copts in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Al-Musawar]]'' Magazine, 23 May 2008 in Arab-West Report, 2008, week 21, art. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was written after the author lived in Egypt and visited several Coptic families in the Delta and [[Upper and Lower Egypt|Upper Egypt]]. The work was published in English in 1918,&lt;ref&gt;An electronic copy of the book is available through http://scholarship.rice.edu/jsp/xml/1911/9178/857/LeeMode.tei-timea.html&lt;/ref&gt; translated into Arabic by Ahmad Mahmūd and published in 2008 by Dar al-Shuruq in Egypt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6690">[[Andrew Sherratt]]'s model of a '''secondary products revolution''' involved a widespread and broadly contemporaneous set of innovations in [[Old World]] [[farming]]. The use of domestic animals for primary carcass products ([[meat]]) was broadened from the 4th-3rd millennia BCE (c. [[Chalcolithic|Middle Chalcolithic]]) to include exploitation for renewable 'secondary' products: [[milk]], [[wool]], [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] (the use of animals to drag ploughs in agriculture), [[Riding animal|riding]] and [[pack transport]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Sherratt, Plough and pastoralism: aspects of the secondary products revolution, in  ''Pattern of the Past: Studies in honour of David Clarke'', edited by I. Hodder, G. Isaac and N. Hammond (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge  1981),  pp. 261–305.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SPR model incorporates two key elements:
# the discovery and diffusion of secondary products innovations
# their systematic application, leading to a transformation of Eurasian economy and society 
 
Many of these innovations first appeared in the Near East during the fourth millennium BCE and spread to Europe and the rest of Asia soon afterwards. They appeared in Europe by the beginning of the third millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Haskel J. Greenfield, The origins of milk and wool production in the Old World: A zooarchaeological perspective from the Central Balkans, ''Current Anthropology'' vol. 29, no 4 (1988), pp. 573-593; Haskel J. Greenfield, A reconsideration of the secondary products revolution: 20 years of research in the central Balkans in ''The Zooarchaeology of Milk and Fats ''(Proceedings of the 9th ICAZ Conference, Durham 2002), edited by [[Jacqui Mulville]] and Alan Outram (Oxford: Oxbow Press 2005), pp. 14-31.&lt;/ref&gt; These innovations became available in [[Europe]] due to the westwards [[diffusion]] of new species ([[horse]], [[donkey]]), breeds (e.g. woolly [[sheep]]), technology ([[wheel]], [[ard (plough)|ard]]) and technological knowledge (e.g. ploughing). Their adoption can be understood in terms of [[pastoralism]], plough [[agriculture]] and animal-based [[transport]] facilitating marginal agricultural colonisation and settlement nucleation. Ultimately it was revolutionary in terms of both origins and consequences. &lt;ref&gt;For Ancient Egypt and neighbouring cultures concerning advances related to the Secondary Products Revolution see Heike Wilde, Interkultureller Austausch Ägyptens mit Palästina an der Schwelle zur Urbanisierung - Globalisierung im orientalischen Chalkolithikum? in Goettinger Miszellen 194 (2003), pp 79-102. For the mediterranean Region: V. Isaakidou, Ploughing with cows: Knossos and the Secondary Products Revolution,  in ''Animals in the Neolithic of Britain and Europe'', edited by D. Serjeantson and D. Field (Oxbow Books: Oxford 2006), pp. 95–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, both the dating and significance of the archaeological evidence cited by Sherratt (and thus the validity of the model) have been questioned by several archaeologists. The dangers of dating the innovations on the basis of evidence such as [[iconography]] and waterlogged organic remains with restricted chronological and geographical availability have been pointed out. Sherratt has himself acknowledged that such dates provide a ''[[terminus ante quem]]'' for the invention of milking and ploughing.&lt;ref&gt;V. Isaakidou, Ploughing with cows: Knossos and the Secondary Products Revolution,  in ''Animals in the Neolithic of Britain and Europe'', edited by D. Serjeantson and D. Field (Oxbow Books: Oxford 2006), pp. 95–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct evidence for how domestic animals were exploited in later prehistoric Europe has grown substantially, in quantity and diversity, since 1981. Initially the concepts of the SPR were tested by analysing the appearance of certain artefact types (e.g. ploughs, wheeled vehicles). By the middle 1980s the most common means of testing the model derived from the more ubiquitous faunal (zooarchaeological) assemblages, through which mortality patterns, herd management and traction-related arthropathies were utilized to confirm or reject the SPR model. Many zooarchaeological studies in both the Near East and Europe have confirmed the veracity of the model.&lt;ref&gt;Haskel J. Greenfield, The origins of milk and wool production in the Old World: A zooarchaeological perspective from the Central Balkans, ''Current Anthropology'' vol. 29, no 4 (1988), pp. 573-593; Haskel J. Greenfield, A reconsideration of the secondary products revolution: 20 years of research in the central Balkans in ''The Zooarchaeology of Milk and Fats ''(Proceedings of the 9th ICAZ Conference, Durham 2002), edited by Jacqui Mulville and Alan Outram (Oxford: Oxbow Press 2005), pp. 14-31; V. Isaakidou, Ploughing with cows: Knossos and the Secondary Products Revolution,  in ''Animals in the Neolithic of Britain and Europe'', edited by D. Serjeantson and D. Field (Oxbow Books: Oxford 2006), pp. 95–112.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However the detection of milk residues in ceramic vessels is now considered the most promising means of detecting the origins of milking. Discovery of such residues has pushed back the earliest date for milking into the Neolithic. A study of more than 2,200 pottery vessels from sites in the Near East and Southeastern Europe indicated that milking had its origins in northwestern Anatolia. The lowland, coastal region around the Sea of Marmara favoured cattle-keeping. Pottery from these sites dating from 6500–5000 BCE showed milk being processed into dairy products.&lt;ref&gt;R.P. Evershed et al., Earliest date for milk use in the Near East and southeastern Europe linked to cattle herding, ''Nature'', vol. 455 (25 September 2008), pp.
528-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Milk residues had already been found in vessels from the British Neolithic, but farming arrived in Britain late (c. 4000 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Copley, R. Berstan, A.J. Mukherjee, S.N. Dudd, V. Straker, S. Payne, R.P. Evershed, Dairying in antiquity: III: Evidence from absorbed lipid residues dating to the British Neolithic, ''Journal of Archaeological Science'', vol. 32 (2005), pp. 523–546. &lt;/ref&gt;

The seeming contradiction between the zooarchaeological and residue studies appears to be a matter of scale. The residues indicate that milking may have played a role in domestic animal exploitation from the later Neolithic. The zooarchaeological studies indicate that there was a massive change in the scale of such production strategies during the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4191">{{Other uses|Standing Room Only (disambiguation){{!}}Standing Room Only}}
{{For|the public transport term|Standing passenger}}

An event is described as '''standing room only''' when it is so well-attended that all of the chairs in the venue are occupied, leaving only flat spaces of pavement or flooring for other attendees to stand, at least those spaces not restricted by occupancy by [[fire safety#fire code|fire codes]] for ingress/egress of crowds. Some venues issue standing-room-only (or '''SRO''') tickets for a reduced cost since it can become uncomfortable to stand through the course of an event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/season/visit/attending.aspx#discount Attending an Opera and Information for Newcomers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some fans prefer standing-room-only tickets as the crowds that gather can be more active than people who are sitting down for much of the event.

For example, standing-room only areas known as [[Terrace (stadium)|terraces]] are very common at [[Association football|football]] matches around the globe and tickets sold as standing area tickets are sometimes the most popular; i.e., they are not sold merely when all seating tickets have been sold out.  However, the periodic occurrence of tragedies related to standing room only areas at football matches such as at [[Hillsborough Disaster|Hillsborough]] and Guatemala City have led to calls to eliminate such arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/1996/10/18/stad.t.php Thomsen, Ian. "Vantage Point : Tragedy in Guatemala: FIFA Must Face Up to Its Duties" International Herald Tribune]&lt;/ref&gt; In England, standing room, once a staple of most football stadiums there, has been practically eliminated at the highest level; all of the major stadiums have been refurbished as [[all-seater]]s. There is a now move towards the provision of [[safe standing]] areas, providing bolt-on, fold-away or rail seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stevens|first=Samuel|title=Celtic reveal new 2,600 capacity safe-standing area with Brendan Rodgers set for first home match as manager|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/scottish/celtic-reveal-new-2600-capacity-safe-standing-area-with-brendan-rodgers-set-for-first-home-match-as-a7136581.html|work=The Independent|date=14 July 2016|access-date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By contrast, standing room tickets are rare at major sports stadiums in the United States and Canada, with only the [[Dallas Cowboys]]' [[AT&amp;T Stadium]], the [[Washington Redskins]] [[FedExField]] and the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] [[Tim Hortons Field]] having such permanent arrangements, though they are usually marketed as part of a 'party deck' where the price of a ticket may come with food and drink along with obstructed [[picnic table]]-style seating, and with other amenities to encourage fans to purchase those tickets. The [[Green Bay Packers]] have also tested out the standing room concept in 2014 in a select section after the completion of renovations at [[Lambeau Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fox6now.com/2014/11/10/it-was-perfect-fans-loving-standing-room-only-ticket-option-for-green-bay-packers-games/|title="It was perfect!"

Lamade Stadium]], able to accommodate 12 times as many spectators on its berms (over 40,000) than it does in the 3,300-seat ballpark proper.

Standing tickets are a key feature of the annual London concert season [[The Proms]], with up to 1,350 "Promenaders" buying cheaper tickets to stand in unreserved space in the arena and gallery of the [[Royal Albert Hall]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Promming? |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3598F306c3KnN6t3x6ThKpN/what-is-promming |publisher=BBC Proms |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Civic Culture''''' or '''''The Civic Culture: Political Attitudes and Democracy in Five Nations''''' is a 1963 political science book by [[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Kendall|title=Germany Transformed: Political Culture and the New Politics|year=181|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674353153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUQGCmSxSXcC&amp;pg=PA320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is credited with popularizing the [[political culture]] sub-field and is considered to be the first systematic study in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Catherine|title=The Politics of Latino Faith|year=2008|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=0814794130|pages=17–18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQIcIRuzif4C&amp;pg=PA18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caramani|first=Daniele|title=Comparative Politics|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199298416|pages=420|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgYF9Us4UNIC&amp;pg=PA420 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In the text Almond and Verba examine the democratic systems in five countries, the United States, Germany, Mexico, Italy, and the United Kingdom. They interviewed about a thousand individuals in each country on their views of government and political life.  As they define it, the "civic culture" (singular) is  "based on communication and persuasion, a culture of consensus and diversity, a culture that [permits] change but [moderates] it" (Almond and Verba 1963, 8). They identify three political structures:  participant, subject, and parochial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crothers|first=Lane|title=Culture and Politics: A Reader|year=2000|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0312233000|pages=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-YEWwAPTtcC&amp;pg=PA51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They consider political culture to be the element that connects individual attitudes with the overall political system structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Franklin|first=Daniel|title=Politics and Film: The Political Culture of Film in the United States|year=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=0742538095|pages=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sv7PFrRzzPgC&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almond and Verba considered the Italian emphasis on the family as the driving main force for society as "amoral" (in the words of [[Edward C. Banfield|Edward Banfield]] (''[[The Moral Basis of a Backward Society]]'', 1958), or "exclusive", and believed that such a culture would impede the culture's potential for developing a "sense of community and civic culture," which they saw as a necessary background for "effective democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kawata|first=Junichi|title=Comparing Political Corruption And Clientelism|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Pub Co|isbn=0754643565|pages=145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X3Tb0Glw3G0C&amp;pg=PA145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and criticisms==
[[Seymour Martin Lipset|Seymour Lipset]] wrote in ''The Democratic Century'' that Almond and Verba "did argue persuasively  that the extent of civic culture could be predicted by structural and historical factors" but that there was also "strong evidence that some aspects of the civic culture were powerfully associated with education levels, across national borders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipset|first=Seymour|title=The Democratic Culture|year=2004|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0806136189|pages=201|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=adE09eMgVjsC&amp;pg=PA201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Civic Culture'' was criticized for having an "Anglo-American bias", with the authors stating that only the United Kingdom and the United States possessed the capability for long term democratic stabilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Axleford|first=Barry|title=Politics: An Introduction|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415110750|pages=58–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also expressed skepticism over the accuracy of depicting a culture based upon individual interviews and that the approach was "ethnocentric and more prescriptive than objective and empirical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrington|first=Lowell|title=Comparative Politics: Structures and Choices|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|isbn=0618493190|pages=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uuAtazupnAC&amp;pg=PA108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The People's Manifesto''' is a [[comedy|comedic]] and [[satirical]] political [[manifesto]], based on an idea by the British satirist and [[political activism|political activist]] [[Mark Thomas]], and created by his [[audience]]s. The manifesto is made up of policies suggested and voted for by members of the public who attended Thomas's stand-up performances. Thomas himself would then go and campaign on the winning policies. As well as forming part of his stand-up shows, the idea transferred to [[radio]], being broadcast as ''Mark Thomas: The Manifesto'' on [[BBC Radio 4]]. A book of the best policies was published on 28 January 2010, entitled ''Mark Thomas Presents The People's Manifesto''.&lt;ref name="BCG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/mark_thomas_manifesto/buy/|title='Mark Thomas: The Manifesto' Merchandise|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=4 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas then announced a contest to find someone to stand in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 UK General Election]] based on the manifesto policies.&lt;ref name="Official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeoplesmanifesto.co.uk/|title=The People's Manifesto|publisher=The People's Manifesto|accessdate=2 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204080428/http://www.thepeoplesmanifesto.co.uk/|archivedate=4 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the competition, Danny Kushlick, stood in [[Bristol West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol West]] and finished sixth out of seven candidates, winning 343 votes, which was 0.6% of the vote.&lt;ref name="Result"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/election2010/results/constituency/a73.stm|title=Election 2010, Britsol West|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=7 May 2010|accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tour==
The People's Manifesto formed a part of Thomas stand-up tour entitled ''It's The Stupid Economy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Thomas|url=http://www.markthomasinfo.com/section_newsblog/default.asp?monthyear=March%202009|title=Newsblog - March 2003|publisher=markthomasinfo.com|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the show and during the interval people wrote down their ideas for policies, with help from the campaign group [[NO2ID]]. Thomas would then go through the policies, deciding which ones would be considered for the manifesto and which ones should be immediately rejected. At the end of the show, the public were asked to vote for the best policy by shouting out loudly in support of the policies, the winning one being formed as part of the manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Thomas|title=Mark Thomas Presents the People's Manifesto|publisher=[[Ebury Press]]|date=28 January 2010|location=[[Reading, Berkshire]]|pages=6|url=http://www.thepeoplesmanifesto.co.uk/|isbn=978-0-09-193796-6|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204080428/http://www.thepeoplesmanifesto.co.uk/|archivedate=4 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas said in an interview with ''[[The List (magazine)|The List]]'': "People innately have lots of solutions. It sounds like an obvious thing, but everyone thinks that they can be [[British Prime Minister|Prime Minister]]; everyone thinks that they can do a better job. They certainly think they can do a better job than [[British House of Commons|their MP]]. Everyone has opinions, and that was how the manifesto show was born. Instead of politicians telling us what we should do, it should be the other way round."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McKay|first=Kenny|url=http://www.list.co.uk/article/23234-the-peoples-manifesto-mark-thomas-interview/|title=The People's Manifesto - Mark Thomas interview|publisher=''[[The List (magazine)|The List]]''|date=18 January 2010|accessdate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour began on 27 March 2009 and finished after the 2010 General Election. Amongst the policies included in the manifesto are:

*"[[Margaret Thatcher]] should pay for [[Death and funeral of Margaret Thatcher|her own funeral]]."
*"The introduction of a [[maximum wage]]."
*"Introduce a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|USA-style 1st Amendment]], to protect free speech."
*"Party [[political manifesto]]s should be legally binding."
*"Anyone in favour of banning [[Immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922|immigration]] should sign a register and they will be banned from travelling abroad."
*"On the voting card there should be a box that says '[[None of the above]].'"
*"That [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] be renamed Lower [[Slough]]."
*"We should build 100,000 [[council house]]s a year."
*"The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' should have to declare on the masthead 'The newspaper that supported [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]!'"
*"There should be a [[Referendums in the United Kingdom|public referendum]] before going to war."

In August 2009, Thomas performed his show at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], in which the winning policies during the Fringe were debated before a selection of [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker |first=Martin |url=http://fringe.scotsgay.co.uk/category/comedy-mark-thomas-the-manifesto/ |title=Comedy: Mark Thomas - The Manifesto |publisher=''[[ScotsGay]]'' |date=31 August 2009 |accessdate=4 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203053418/http://fringe.scotsgay.co.uk/category/comedy-mark-thomas-the-manifesto/ |archivedate=3 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio show==
A two-part radio series based on the People's Manifesto, entitled ''Mark Thomas: The Manifesto'' was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] on 25 June and 2 July 2009. The winning policies in these shows were, "Reform the role of Whips in parliament",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/mark_thomas_manifesto/episodes/1/1/|title=Mark Thomas: The Manifesto - Episode 1.1|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|date=25 June 2009|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, "Banning [[bottled water]] and making [[drinking fountain]]s etc more wide-spread via [[standpipe (street)|standpipe]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/mark_thomas_manifesto/episodes/1/2/|title=Mark Thomas: The Manifesto - Episode 1.2|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|date=2 July 2009|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second series began on 4 February 2010.

==Book==
A book containing a selection of the policies, entitled ''Mark Thomas Presents The People's Manifesto'', was published by [[Ebury Press]] on 28 January 2010.&lt;ref name="BCG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Official"/&gt;

==2010 general election==
To promote ''Mark Thomas Presents The People's Manifesto'', a competition was organised by Thomas and Ebury Press to find a person to stand in the 2010 general election as an [[Independent (politician)#United Kingdom|independent candidate]], based on the policies listed in manifesto.

|ShortSummary=The team are on the trail of a medieval mystery. Founded by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] and built by his son [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], [[Syon Monastery|Syon Abbey]] was a large, wealthy monastery for nuns of an obscure Swedish order. During the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] it vanished. Its remains lie beneath the lawns of modern Syon House, designed by [[Capability Brown]]. What they find is on a huge scale. But there is disagreement as to what kind of building it was. After investigating the foundations of the House, Stewart and Jonathan reach an agreement on the extent of the church. They are joined by buildings historian [[Jonathan Foyle]] and monastic expert Barney Sloane.&lt;ref name="IMDB 1101"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0959238/|title=Time Team - Syon House, London|accessdate=1 October 2015|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|ShortSummary=Next to the beautifully manicured lawns of Whitestaunton Manor in the [[Blackdown Hills]] of Somerset lies a patch of muddy weeds. Coins and pottery have been found here, and it is supposedly the site of a [[Roman villa]]. But archaeology student Freya Bowles thinks differently. The team first have to remove weeds and tree roots without the use of mechanical diggers, as it's a [[scheduled monument]]. They are also extremely limited as to the size of the excavation. Clearly there are Roman remains, but mixed up with Victorian or Edwardian garden features. Gradually the plan of a [[Thermae|Roman bath house]] emerges. The team are joined by mosaic specialist David Neal and buildings historian [[Jonathan Foyle]]. Directed by technological historian Robert Spain, they build a full-size replica [[hypocaust]] complete with under-floor heating.&lt;ref name="IMDB 1102"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0959239/|title=Time Team - Whitestaunton, Somerset|accessdate=1 October 2015|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|ShortSummary=There's a island-ish round area of stones in [[Loch Migdale]] - could it be a [[crannog]]?  200 meters away on the banks is a small (12 m diameter) circular feature - is it a [[henge]]? Time Team rounds up some [[Francis Pryor|experts]] on the [[Miles Russell|prehistoric]] and finds out. They set up a [[Airlift (dredging device)|suction dredge]] to investigate two areas of the loch feature, and find wonderfully preserved timber, proving that it's a built structure and thus a crannog. GPS surveying and a tip from a local farmer finds the [[causeway]], now underwater, leading to it  Trenches within the henge show that the entrance and wooden posts within it pointed towards notable features in the landscape. [[Stewart Ainsworth|Stewart]] looks for the find site of the [[Migdale Hoard]].

|ShortSummary=The team investigate a possible [[Burial in Early Anglo-Saxon England|fifth century cemetery]] in a ploughed field, where they find a metal [[shield boss]]. One male skeleton is holding a drinking vessel. There are hints of much earlier activity as well, including a [[Bronze Age]] [[Tumulus|barrow]]. Using authentic tools, they fashion a Saxon shield. Conservator Dana Goodburn-Brown examines the details in the [[x-rays]] of the shield boss; while Phil and members of ''[[Regia Anglorum]]'' demonstrate how the shields are used in battle. They are joined by bone specialists [[Alice Roberts]] and Margaret Cox, who unearth some coloured beads among the remains.&lt;ref name="IMDB 1104"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0959236/?ref_=ttep_ep4|title=Time Team - South Carlton, Lincolnshire|accessdate=9 July 2015|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|ShortSummary=Nobody knows what happened immediately after the Romans arrived in 43 AD, because no [[Castra|Roman fort]] has been discovered in this part of South East England. ''Time Team'' are on a mission to find the missing link. Local archaeologist Paul Wilkinson believes he has already found a military ditch, which would surround such a fort.&lt;ref name="WMAP 1105"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/8879542/Time-Team-Excavation-Site-Syndale|title=Time Team Excavation Site Syndale|accessdate=9 July 2015|publisher=Wikimapia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's a prime site, right next to [[Watling Street]]. However geophysics cannot find any evidence for a ditch. So begins one of their most frustrating digs, directed by Neil Holbrook. Phil enlists in the [[Ermine Street Guard]] for a day.

|ShortSummary=Green Island in Poole Harbour has already shown that it was a significant centre of [[Iron Age]] activity, with evidence of industrial activity and trading to and from the continental mainland. But it has never been properly excavated. Two huge jetties - now buried - indicate either a port or a defensive structure. The island is a SSSI ([[Site of Special Scientific Interest]]), which means hand-digging only, and replacing the topsoil. Very soon the finds start to multiply. Of particular interest is evidence of shale working for jewelry, and iron smithing. They are joined by Project Director Eileen Wilkes, archaeologist Miles Russell, Iron Age specialist John Collis, and [[Metallurgy|metallurgist]] Roger Doonan. Experimental archaeologist Jake Keenan demonstrates shale working with primitive tools. [[Geomorphology|Geomorphologist]] Vincent May explains that in prehistoric times the water level was two metres lower, and Green Island was much bigger.&lt;ref name="IMDB 1106"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0959233/|title=Time Team - Green Island, Dorset|accessdate=1 October 2015|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|ShortSummary=The team are revisiting the garden of Furnace Cottage in Churnet Valley, where the previous excavation of an Elizabethan [[blast furnace]] produced evidence of much earlier iron-making. Stewart surveys the landscape, to piece together a picture of water flow and other features essential to iron smelting. But John is convinced that there is strong geophysical evidence for a furnace a mile away at Eastwall Farm. It could even be water-powered - a major discovery. They build a medieval style [[bloomery]]. They are joined by historian Pete Brown, and archaeologists David Cranstone, Bill Klemperer, Deb Ford, Gerry McDonnell, Tim Young.&lt;ref name="IMDB 1107"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0946724/|title=Time Team - Oakamoor, Staffordshire|accessdate=29 September 2015|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|ShortSummary=When the tide recedes at this point on the Severn estuary, rare evidence of stone age activity is uncovered. ''Time Team'' are on a three-day mission to help recover some of these relics before they are washed away. It involves excavating and painstakingly examining 15 cubic metres of muddy silt; but time is against them. The [[Mesolithic]] period is poorly understood, because these people were highly mobile hunter-gatherers who did not build permanent structures. They uncover some of the smallest artefacts they have ever handled. Phil and Brigid are fascinated by ancient footprints of adults and children, preserved in the sand. Phil excavates the massive tooth of an [[aurochs]], an extinct giant prey animal. They are joined by Martin Bell of Reading University, Mesolithic specialists Nick Barton and Robin Crompton, and food expert Jacqui Wilson who cooks up a stone age feast.&lt;ref name="IMDB 1108"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0959232/|title=Time Team - Goldcliff, Newport|accessdate=29 September 2015|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|ShortSummary=The British landscape is littered with [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]]s. A local archaeology unit is digging such a hill fort in Oxfordshire, but cannot afford to investigate a neighbouring larger hill, only 200 metres away. Both Roman and Iron Age remains have been found there in the past. But what is its relationship, if any, to the hill fort? The geophysics team identify a potential target, a square enclosure on the side of the hill. But before they can begin, they have to manually search the site for specimens of [[Northern crested newt|great crested newt]], a rare protected species. At the beginning of day two, John's team find something which could be very special, a Roman church, apparently with a semicircular apse. They are joined by Tim Allen of [[Oxford Archaeology]] and [[Bioarchaeology|osteoarchaeologist]] Angela Boyle.&lt;ref name="IMDB 1109"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0959240/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1|title=Time Team - Wittenham Clumps, Oxfordshire|accessdate=29 September 2015|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2004|3|7|df=y}}
|ShortSummary=Digging up fields and car parks and back gardens is all very well, but how could Time Team pass up a chance to dig up a living room? The manor house in [[Nassington]] was purchased in a derelict state, and while restoring it, several massive post holes were investigated that are of a size and spacing to be a Saxon great hall. The pottery finds from the property suggest almost constant occupation from the Iron Age to the present, and the [[Ramsey Abbey|Ramsey Chronicle]] records that [[Cnut]] owned Nassington while king. Up comes the flooring so three trenches can be dug inside the house, while outside, various trenches are dug in the garden. It seems that hall after hall was built where the manor house still stands, but no trace can any longer be found of outbuildings which must have been there. Graeme Lawson visits with a selection of Dark Ages musical instruments, makes a reed pipe of elder wood, and plays out the episode with the Time Team theme music on pipe and lyre.

|ShortSummary=As renowned Suffolk archaeologist [[Basil Brown]] discovered, Castle Hill near Ipswich is named, not after a castle, but a substantial [[Roman villa]]. Brown was unable to complete his excavation, and Time Team have been called in by local schoolchildren to find out more. However, they will need to dig up a few back gardens to do so. Very soon it becomes clear that Brown's measurements were out of kilter. Halfway through day two, Phil makes a breakthrough. But not until 11 trenches are dug in 8 gardens does a full picture emerge. The team are joined by Roman specialist David Neale and site director [[Miles Russell]].&lt;ref name="IMTT1111"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0723694/fullcredits?|title=Time Team - Ipswich, Suffolk|accessdate=3 April 2015|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very soon multiple finds start appearing, and to Tony's delight he is allowed to dig up a little beaker. Archaeologist [[Mike Parker Pearson]] produces a timeline of prehistoric and historic burial practices. Phil's trench is invaded by chickens. Gradually a complex picture emerges of human activity here over thousands of years, including a heated [[Roman villa]] with bath-house.

The '''Tumulus culture''' ({{lang-de|Hügelgräberkultur}}) dominated [[Central Europe]] during the [[European Bronze Age|Middle Bronze Age]] (c. 1600 to 1200 BC).

It was the descendant of the [[Unetice culture]]. Its heartland was the area previously occupied by the Unetice culture besides [[Bavaria]] and [[Württemberg]]. It was succeeded by the Late Bronze Age [[Urnfield culture]].

As the name implies, the Tumulus culture is distinguished by the practice of burying the dead beneath burial mounds ([[Tumulus|tumuli]] or [[kurgan]]s).

In 1902, [[Paul Reinecke]] distinguished a number of cultural horizons based on research of Bronze Age hoards and tumuli in periods covered by these cultural horizons are shown in the table below. The Tumulus culture was prevalent during the Bronze Age periods B, C1, and C2. Tumuli have been used elsewhere in Europe from the Stone Age to the Iron Age; the term "Tumulus culture" specifically refers to the South German variant of the Bronze Age. In the table, Ha designates [[Hallstatt]]. Archaeological horizons Hallstatt A–B are part of the Bronze Age Urnfield culture, while horizons Hallstatt C–D are the type site for the Iron Age [[Hallstatt culture]].

The Tumulus culture was eminently a warrior society which expanded with new chiefdoms eastward into the [[Carpathian Basin]] (up to the river [[Tisza]]), and northward into Polish and central European Únětice territories, with dispersed settlements centred in fortified structures. Some scholars see Tumulus groups from [[southern Germany]] in this context as corresponding to a community that shared an extinct Indo-European linguistic entity, such as the hypothetical [[Italo-Celtic]] group that was ancestral to [[Italic languages|Italic]] and [[Celtic languages|Celtic]].&lt;ref&gt;Kortlandt, Frederik. 2007a. Italo-Celtic origins and prehistoric development of the Irish language (Amsterdam: Rodopi).{{pn|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eska, J. F. 2010. The emergence of the Celtic languages. In The Celtic Languages, second edition edited by M. J. Ball and N. Müller. London: Routledge.{{pn|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular hypothesis, however, conflicts with suggestions by other Indo-Europeanists. For instance, [[David W. Anthony]] suggests that [[Proto-Italic]] (and perhaps also [[Proto-Celtic]]) speakers could have entered northern Italy at an earlier stage, from the east (e.g., the [[Balkan]]/[[Adriatic]] region).&lt;ref&gt;David W. Anthony, 2010, ''The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World '', Princeton University Press, p. 367. &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ursula K Le Guin.JPG|thumb|right|Le Guin at a reading in [[Danville, California]], 2008]]

[[Ursula K. Le Guin]] was an American author of [[speculative fiction]], realistic fiction, non-fiction, [[screenplay]]s, [[libretto]]s, essays, poetry, speeches, translations, literary critiques, [[chapbook]]s, and children's fiction. She was primarily known for her works of speculative fiction. These include works set in the fictional world of [[Earthsea]], stories in the ''[[Hainish Cycle]]'', standalone novels and short stories. Though frequently referred to as an author of [[science fiction]], critics have described her work as being difficult to classify.{{sfn|White|1999|p=1}}

Le Guin came to critical attention with the publication of ''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]'' in 1968, and ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' in 1969. The Earthsea books, of which ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' was the first, have been described as Le Guin's best work by several commentators, while scholar Charlotte Spivack described ''The Left Hand of Darkness'' as having established Le Guin's reputation as a writer of science fiction.{{sfn|Spivack|1984|pp=44–50}} Literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] referred to the books as Le Guin's masterpieces. Several scholars have called the Earthsea books Le Guin's best work.{{sfn|White|1999|p=2}} Her work has received intense critical attention. As of 1999, ten volumes of literary criticism and forty [[Thesis|dissertation]]s had been written about her work: she was referred to by scholar Donna White as a "major figure in American letters".{{sfn|White|1999|p=1}} Her awards include the [[National Book Award]], the [[Newbery Medal]], and multiple [[Hugo Award|Hugo]] and [[Nebula Award]]s.{{sfn|White|1999|p=1}} Feminist critiques of her writing were particularly influential upon Le Guin's later work.{{sfn|White|1999|p=2}} 

Le Guin's first published work was the poem "Folksong from the Montayna Province" in 1959, while her first short story was "An die Musik", in 1961; both were set in her fictional country of [[Orsinia]]. Her first professional publication was the short story "April in Paris" in 1962, while her first published novel was ''[[Rocannon's World]]'', released by [[Ace Books]] in 1966.{{sfn|White|1999|p=9, 123}}{{sfn|Nicholls|Clute|2018}}{{sfn|Erlich|2009|p=25}}&lt;ref name="LOA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Attebery|first1=Brian|title=Ursula K. Le Guin: The Complete Orsinia|url=https://www.loa.org/books/513-the-complete-orsinia|website=Library of America|accessdate=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her last publication was a 2018 collection of non-fiction, titled ''Dreams Must Explain Themselves and Other Essays 1972–2004''.{{sfn|Nicholls|Clute|2018}} This bibliography includes all of Le Guin's published novels, short fiction, translations, edited volumes, and all collections that include material not previously published in book form, as well as any works mentioned in commentary about Le Guin's writings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8207">The '''West American Digest System''' is a system of identifying points of law from reported cases and organizing them by topic and key number. The system was developed by [[Thomson West|West Publishing]] to organize the entire body of [[Law of the United States|American law]]. This extensive [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] makes the process of doing [[case law]] [[legal research]] less time consuming as it directs the researcher to cases that are similar to the legal issue under consideration.

==History==
[[File:American law digests.jpg|thumb|Early digests]]
The problem of finding cases on a particular topic was a large problem for the rapidly growing American legal system of the 19th century. John B. West, the founder of West Publishing, described this problem in his article ''[http://www.hyperlaw.com//90-99-docs/1909-multiplicity_of_reports_jbwest.html A multiplicity of reports]''.  To solve the problem, he developed a system with two major parts.  First, his company published cases in many American jurisdictions in bound volumes called [[Law reports|reporters]] (the West [[National Reporter System]] now covers all state and federal courts). Second, he put together a classification system in which he divided the law into major categories which he called topics (such as "Contracts").  He then created hundreds of subcategories.  To save space in printing, these were given a number called a key number.  He then applied this "topic and key number" system to the cases he published. The key number is identified in the books with a key number and a key symbol graphic.

==How the Digest System works==
Each case published in a West reporter is evaluated by an [[editing|editor]] who identifies the points of law cited or explained in the case.  The editor places the summaries of the points of law covered in the case at the beginning of the case.  These summaries are usually a paragraph long, and are called '''headnotes'''.  Each headnote is then assigned a topic and key number.  The headnotes are arranged according to their topic and key number in multi-volume sets of books called Digests.  A digest serves as a subject index to the case law published in West reporters. Headnotes are merely editorial guides to the points of law discussed or used in the cases, and the headnotes themselves are not legal authority.

West publishes ''West's Analysis of American Law'', which is a complete guide to the topic and key number system, and it is revised periodically.

==Print Digest==
In print, a digest works like an encyclopedia, in that the topics are listed in alphabetical order and printed on the [[bookbinding#Spine conventions|spines]]. The "Descriptive Word Index" provides guidance as to the proper topics and key numbers.

The digest system includes digests for the individual states (except for Delaware, Nevada and Utah).  The U.S. Supreme Court, Bankruptcy Courts, Federal Claims Court, and military courts each have an individual digest, as well as their decisions being included in the '''''Federal Practice Digest''''' with the notes of decisions from the federal [[United States district court|District Courts]] and [[United States Court of Appeals|Courts of Appeals]].  Digests are also published for West's [[National Reporter System]]. Specialty subject digests exist, such as the Education Law Digest, and the Social Security Digest.

For nationwide research, about once a month, West publishes a '''''General Digest''''' volume, which incorporates classified digest notes from all [[law report|reporters]] of the West National Reporter System. These are then cumulated into a '''''Decennial Digest'''''. Decennial implies that this occurs every ten years, but in the past several decades, there have been Decennial Digest Parts I and II (the 11th Series now has Part III [http://west.thomson.com/productdetail/147058/40591956/productdetail.aspx]), so the cumulation is now more frequent. However, the various Decennial Digests are not cumulated. Thus, completing such a search over several decades requires consulting the Decennial Digests, and then updating that work with the most recent series of the General Digest.

Some of the state and topical digests are revised to include the first cases in the jurisdiction, while the spines of the books of some of the other digests indicate that they are from "1933 to date," for instance, indicating that one must consult a prior series for references to earlier cases. The state, federal, regional, and topical digests are updated by interim pamphlets, pocket parts, replacement volumes, or a new series.

==The Digest on Westlaw==
Researchers can also search the digest electronically using [[Westlaw]]:
* with the "Key Number Search Tool," which uses a word search to identify up to five key numbers,
* with the "Key Numbers and Digest" feature (browse by subject using an expandable [[Tree structure|tree]] - no search terms required),
* by a key number search using the "Terms and Connectors" method (with a known topic and key number - in the form of 134k261; topic 134 is Divorce and the key number is 261 for "Enforcement, In general"),
* by using the KeySearch feature (a menu of [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] links that automatically generates a search without the need to see the key numbers or the terms and connectors query), or 
* by finding a relevant case using keyword searching and then using the key number hyperlinks in the document to find related cases.

Most secondary sources published by Thomson West, such as [[Corpus Juris Secundum]] and [[American Jurisprudence]], also have key number hyperlinks in their on-line Westlaw versions.

The "Key Numbers and Digest" feature and the hyperlinks create a "Custom Digest."

The Custom Digest allows:
* selection of the jurisdiction of interest (so that headnotes from cases in that jurisdiction will appear in the results);
* limiting the time frame of the search; and 
* adding additional search terms.

Selecting key numbers and jurisdictions in the "Key Number Search Tool" results in a similar display of digest headnotes.
 
Since all West headnote annotations are merged on Westlaw into a single database from which each Custom Digest is generated, there is no need to consult each separate series of the hard copy Decennial Digest.  Full text of the cases may be accessed from the Custom Digest by clicking on the underlined case citation. The key number search or KeySearch will retrieve entire cases from a case law database.

== Other digest systems ==
Other digest systems exist, including Butterworth's Digest [http://rimer.butterworths.co.uk/webcat/enquiry/product/prodInfo.asp?ProdID=460&amp;Text=First&amp;i=cat&amp;Acca=0] for the [[United Kingdom]] (also containing references to cases decided in other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries), the Canadian Abridgment,[http://www.carswell.com/areasofinterest/law/print/abridgment.htm] digests associated with [[Reporter (law)|official state reports]], such as in [[California]] and [[Wisconsin]], and digests associated with topical reporters, such as the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] Case Digest. Most of these use a topic and section format, while some, like the U.C.C. Case Digest, use a section format based on the statute or rules being annotated. The A.L.R. Digest, accompanying the [[American Law Reports]], formerly had its own classification system, but was replaced in 2004 by ''West's American Law Reports Digest,'' which follows West's topic and key number system.

'''William J. Carpenter''' (April 17, 1827 - February 21, 1921) was a legendary [[West Virginia]] [[outdoorsman]].&lt;ref&gt;John Davison Sutton: ''History of Braxton County and Central West Virginia'', McClain Printing Co., Parsons, W.Va., 1919, pp. 360-361.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Comstock: ''The West Virginia Heritage Encyclopedia'', Richwood, W.Va., 1973-1976, Vol. 4, p. 826.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the Braxton Historical Society'', Vol. 1, No. 1, 1973, cover photo and pp. 1, 2, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Eston Randolph Byrne: ''Tale of the Elk'', West Virginia Publishing Co., Charleston, W.Va., 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to have had "no equal" in skills at hunting and fishing, and to be the best [[long rifle]] [[marksman]] in his community in his younger years—his skill in hitting difficult targets in [[squirrel]] hunting earned him the [[nickname]] "Squirrely Bill."

Carpenter was a descendant of Jeremiah Carpenter, the first white man to settle in the upper [[Elk River (West Virginia)|Elk River]] valley, at or near the mouth of [[Holly River State Park|Holly River]], in the year of 1784.  His father was the first white child born in that section of [[Webster County, West Virginia]], created from [[Greenbrier County, West Virginia|Greenbrier County, Virginia]] in 1788.

Carpenter's extended family is known for producing noteworthy [[raconteur]]s and [[musician]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Milnes: "The Carpenter Legacy" in ''Play of a Fiddle, Traditional Music, Dance, and Folklore in West Virginia'', The University Press of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky., 1999, pp. 35-44.&lt;/ref&gt;
